TLB	Genesis	1	1	When God began creating [ a ] the heavens and the earth ,
TLB	Genesis	1	2	the earth was [ b ] a shapeless , chaotic mass , with the Spirit of God brooding over the dark vapors .
TLB	Genesis	1	3	Then God said , “ Let there be light. ” And light appeared . 4-5 And God was pleased with it and divided the light from the darkness . He called the light “ daytime , ” and the darkness “ nighttime. ” Together they formed the first day . [ c ]
TLB	Genesis	1	6	And God said , “ Let the vapors separate [ d ] to form the sky above and the oceans below. ” 7-8 So God made the sky , dividing the vapor above from the water below . This all happened on the second day . [ e ] 9-10 Then God said , “ Let the water beneath the sky be gathered into oceans so that the dry land will emerge. ” And so it was . Then God named the dry land “ earth , ” and the water “ seas. ” And God was pleased . 11-12 And he said , “ Let the earth burst forth with every sort of grass and seed-bearing plant , and fruit trees with seeds inside the fruit , so that these seeds will produce the kinds of plants and fruits they came from. ” And so it was , and God was pleased .
TLB	Genesis	1	13	This all occurred on the third day . [ f ] 14-15 Then God said , “ Let bright lights appear in the sky to give light to the earth and to identify the day and the night ; they shall bring about the seasons on the earth , and mark the days and years. ” And so it was .
TLB	Genesis	1	16	For God had made two huge lights , the sun and moon , to shine down upon the earth—the larger one , the sun , to preside over the day and the smaller one , the moon , to preside through the night ; he had also made the stars .
TLB	Genesis	1	17	And God set them in the sky to light the earth ,
TLB	Genesis	1	18	and to preside over the day and night , and to divide the light from the darkness . And God was pleased .
TLB	Genesis	1	19	This all happened on the fourth day . [ g ]
TLB	Genesis	1	20	Then God said , “ Let the waters teem with fish and other life , and let the skies be filled with birds of every kind. ” 21-22 So God created great sea animals , and every sort of fish and every kind of bird . And God looked at them with pleasure , and blessed them all . “ Multiply and stock the oceans , ” he told them , and to the birds he said , “ Let your numbers increase . Fill the earth ! ”
TLB	Genesis	1	23	That ended the fifth day . [ h ]
TLB	Genesis	1	24	And God said , “ Let the earth bring forth every kind of animal—cattle and reptiles and wildlife of every kind. ” And so it was .
TLB	Genesis	1	25	God made all sorts of wild animals and cattle and reptiles . And God was pleased with what he had done .
TLB	Genesis	1	26	Then God said , “ Let us make a man [ i ] —someone like ourselves , to be the master of all life upon the earth and in the skies and in the seas. ”
TLB	Genesis	1	27	So God made man like his Maker . Like God did God make man ; Man and maid did he make them .
TLB	Genesis	1	28	And God blessed them and told them , “ Multiply and fill the earth and subdue it ; you are masters of the fish and birds and all the animals .
TLB	Genesis	1	29	And look ! I have given you the seed-bearing plants throughout the earth and all the fruit trees for your food .
TLB	Genesis	1	30	And I ’ ve given all the grass and plants to the animals and birds for their food. ”
TLB	Genesis	1	31	Then God looked over all that he had made , and it was excellent in every way . This ended the sixth day .

TLB	Genesis	2	2	So on the seventh day , having finished his task , God ceased from this work he had been doing ,
TLB	Genesis	2	3	and God blessed the seventh day and declared it holy , because it was the day when he ceased this work of creation .
TLB	Genesis	2	4	Here is a summary of the events in the creation of the heavens and earth when the Lord God made them .
TLB	Genesis	2	5	There were no plants or grain sprouting up across the earth at first , for the Lord God hadn ’ t sent any rain ; nor was there anyone to farm the soil .
TLB	Genesis	2	6	( However , water welled up from the ground at certain places and flowed across the land . )
TLB	Genesis	2	7	The time came when the Lord God formed a man ’ s body from the dust of the ground [ a ] and breathed into it the breath of life . And man became a living person .
TLB	Genesis	2	8	Then the Lord God planted a garden in Eden , to the east , and placed in the garden the man he had formed .
TLB	Genesis	2	9	The Lord God planted all sorts of beautiful trees there in the garden , trees producing the choicest of fruit . At the center of the garden he placed the Tree of Life , and also the Tree of Conscience , giving knowledge of Good and Bad .
TLB	Genesis	2	10	A river from the land of Eden flowed through the garden to water it ; afterwards the river divided into four branches . 11-12 One of these was named the Pishon ; it winds across the entire length of the land of Havilah , [ b ] where nuggets of pure gold are found , also beautiful bdellium and even lapis lazuli .
TLB	Genesis	2	13	The second branch is called the Gihon , crossing the entire length of the land of Cush .
TLB	Genesis	2	14	The third branch is the Tigris , which flows to the east of the city of Asher . And the fourth is the Euphrates .
TLB	Genesis	2	15	The Lord God placed the man in the Garden of Eden as its gardener , to tend and care for it . 16-17 But the Lord God gave the man this warning : “ You may eat any fruit in the garden except fruit from the Tree of Conscience—for its fruit will open your eyes to make you aware of right and wrong , good and bad . If you eat its fruit , you will be doomed to die. ”
TLB	Genesis	2	18	And the Lord God said , “ It isn ’ t good for man to be alone ; I will make a companion for him , a helper suited to his needs. ” 19-20 So the Lord God formed from the soil every kind of animal and bird , and brought them to the man to see what he would call them ; and whatever he called them , that was their name . But still there was no proper helper for the man .
TLB	Genesis	2	21	Then the Lord God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep , and took one of his ribs and closed up the place from which he had removed it ,
TLB	Genesis	2	22	and made the rib into a woman , and brought her to the man .
TLB	Genesis	2	23	“ This is it ! ” Adam exclaimed . “ She is part of my own bone and flesh ! Her name is ‘ woman ’ because she was taken out of a man. ”
TLB	Genesis	2	24	This explains why a man leaves his father and mother and is joined to his wife in such a way that the two become one person . [ c ]
TLB	Genesis	2	25	Now although the man and his wife were both naked , neither of them was embarrassed or ashamed . Footnotes - Genesis 2:7 from the dust of the ground , or “ from a lump of soil , ” or “ from clods in the soil , ” or “ from a clod of clay. ” - Genesis 2:11 the land of Havilah , located along the border of Babylonia . - Genesis 2:24 become one person , literally , “ become one flesh. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Genesis	3	3	The serpent was the craftiest of all the creatures the Lord God had made . So the serpent came to the woman . “ Really ? ” he asked . “ None of the fruit in the garden ? God says you mustn ’ t eat any of it ? ” 2-3 “ Of course we may eat it , ” the woman told him . “ It ’ s only the fruit from the tree at the center of the garden that we are not to eat . God says we mustn ’ t eat it or even touch it , or we will die. ”
TLB	Genesis	3	4	“ That ’ s a lie ! ” the serpent hissed . “ You ’ ll not die !
TLB	Genesis	3	5	God knows very well that the instant you eat it you will become like him , for your eyes will be opened—you will be able to distinguish good from evil ! ”
TLB	Genesis	3	6	The woman was convinced . How lovely and fresh looking it was ! And it would make her so wise ! So she ate some of the fruit and gave some to her husband , and he ate it too .
TLB	Genesis	3	7	And as they ate it , suddenly they became aware of their nakedness , and were embarrassed . So they strung fig leaves together to cover themselves around the hips .
TLB	Genesis	3	8	That evening they heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden ; and they hid themselves among the trees .
TLB	Genesis	3	9	The Lord God called to Adam , “ Why are you hiding ? ” [ a ]
TLB	Genesis	3	10	And Adam replied , “ I heard you coming and didn ’ t want you to see me naked . So I hid. ”
TLB	Genesis	3	11	“ Who told you you were naked ? ” the Lord God asked . “ Have you eaten fruit from the tree I warned you about ? ”
TLB	Genesis	3	12	“ Yes , ” Adam admitted , “ but it was the woman you gave me who brought me some , and I ate it. ”
TLB	Genesis	3	13	Then the Lord God asked the woman , “ How could you do such a thing ? ” “ The serpent tricked me , ” she replied .
TLB	Genesis	3	14	So the Lord God said to the serpent , “ This is your punishment : You are singled out from among all the domestic and wild animals of the whole earth—to be cursed . You shall grovel in the dust as long as you live , crawling along on your belly .
TLB	Genesis	3	15	From now on you and the woman will be enemies , as will your offspring and hers . You will strike his heel , but he will crush your head. ”
TLB	Genesis	3	16	Then God said to the woman , “ You shall bear children in intense pain and suffering ; yet even so , you shall welcome your husband ’ s affections , and he shall be your master. ”
TLB	Genesis	3	17	And to Adam , God said , “ Because you listened to your wife and ate the fruit when I told you not to , I have placed a curse upon the soil . All your life you will struggle to extract a living from it .
TLB	Genesis	3	18	It will grow thorns and thistles for you , and you shall eat its grasses .
TLB	Genesis	3	19	All your life you will sweat to master it , until your dying day . Then you will return to the ground from which you came . For you were made from the ground , and to the ground you will return. ”
TLB	Genesis	3	20	The man named his wife Eve ( meaning “ The life-giving one ” ) , [ b ] for he said , “ She shall become the mother of all mankind ” ;
TLB	Genesis	3	21	and the Lord God clothed Adam and his wife with garments made from skins of animals .
TLB	Genesis	3	22	Then the Lord said , “ Now that the man has become as we are , knowing good from bad , what if he eats the fruit of the Tree of Life and lives forever ? ”
TLB	Genesis	3	23	So the Lord God banished him forever from the Garden of Eden , and sent him out to farm the ground from which he had been taken .
TLB	Genesis	3	24	Thus God expelled him , and placed mighty angels at the east of the Garden of Eden , with a flaming sword to guard the entrance to the Tree of Life . Footnotes - Genesis 3:9 Why are you hiding ? or “ Where are you ? ” - Genesis 3:20 Eve ( meaning “ The life-giving one ” ) . Many Hebrew names are based on puns . In this instance the Hebrew word for Eve sounds similar to a Hebrew word that means “ life-giving. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Genesis	4	4	and Abel brought the fatty cuts of meat from his best lambs , and presented them to the Lord . And the Lord accepted Abel ’ s offering ,
TLB	Genesis	4	2	Her next child was his brother , Abel . Abel became a shepherd , while Cain was a farmer .
TLB	Genesis	4	3	At harvest time Cain brought the Lord a gift of his farm produce ,
TLB	Genesis	4	5	but not Cain ’ s . This made Cain both dejected and very angry , and his face grew dark with fury .
TLB	Genesis	4	6	“ Why are you angry ? ” the Lord asked him . “ Why is your face so dark with rage ?
TLB	Genesis	4	7	It can be bright with joy if you will do what you should ! But if you refuse to obey , watch out . Sin is waiting to attack you , longing to destroy you . But you can conquer it ! ”
TLB	Genesis	4	8	One day Cain suggested to his brother , “ Let ’ s go out into the fields. ” And while they were together there , Cain attacked and killed his brother .
TLB	Genesis	4	9	But afterwards the Lord asked Cain , “ Where is your brother ? Where is Abel ? ” “ How should I know ? ” Cain retorted . “ Am I supposed to keep track of him wherever he goes ? ”
TLB	Genesis	4	10	But the Lord said , “ Your brother ’ s blood calls to me from the ground . What have you done ?
TLB	Genesis	4	11	You are hereby banished from this ground which you have defiled with your brother ’ s blood .
TLB	Genesis	4	12	No longer will it yield crops for you , even if you toil on it forever ! From now on you will be a fugitive and a tramp upon the earth , wandering from place to place. ”
TLB	Genesis	4	13	Cain replied to the Lord , “ My punishment is greater than I can bear .
TLB	Genesis	4	14	For you have banished me from my farm and from you , and made me a fugitive and a tramp ; and everyone who sees me will try to kill me. ”
TLB	Genesis	4	15	The Lord replied , “ They won ’ t kill you , for I will give seven times your punishment to anyone who does. ” Then the Lord put an identifying mark on Cain as a warning not to kill him .
TLB	Genesis	4	16	So Cain went out from the presence of the Lord and settled in the land of Nod , east of Eden .
TLB	Genesis	4	17	Then Cain ’ s wife conceived and presented him with a baby son named Enoch ; so when Cain founded a city , he named it Enoch , after his son .
TLB	Genesis	4	18	Enoch was the father of [ a ] Irad ; Irad was the father of Mehujael ; Mehujael was the father of Methusael ; Methusael was the father of Lamech .
TLB	Genesis	4	19	Lamech married two wives—Adah and Zillah .
TLB	Genesis	4	20	To Adah was born a baby named Jabal . He became the first of the cattlemen and those living in tents .
TLB	Genesis	4	21	His brother ’ s name was Jubal , the first musician—the inventor of the harp and flute . [ b ]
TLB	Genesis	4	22	To Lamech ’ s other wife , Zillah , was born Tubal-cain . He opened the first foundry [ c ] forging instruments of bronze and iron .
TLB	Genesis	4	23	One day Lamech said to Adah and Zillah , “ Listen to me , my wives . I have killed a youth who attacked and wounded me .
TLB	Genesis	4	24	If anyone who kills Cain will be punished seven times , anyone taking revenge against me for killing that youth should be punished seventy-seven times ! ”
TLB	Genesis	4	25	Later on Eve gave birth to another son and named him Seth ( meaning “ Granted ” ) ; for , as Eve put it , “ God has granted me another son for the one Cain killed. ”
TLB	Genesis	4	26	When Seth grew up , he had a son and named him Enosh . It was during his lifetime that men first began to call themselves “ the Lord ’ s people. ” [ d ] Footnotes - Genesis 4:18 Enoch was the father of , or “ the ancestor of , ” and so also in the remainder of the verse . - Genesis 4:21 the inventor of the harp and flute , literally , “ the father of all such as handle the harp and pipe. ” - Genesis 4:22 He opened the first foundry , literally , “ He was the father of all metal workers in bronze and iron. ” - Genesis 4:26 It was during . . . “ the Lord ’ s people , ” literally , “ This man was the first to invoke the name of Jehovah. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Genesis	6	4	In those days , and even afterwards , when the evil beings from the spirit world were sexually involved with human women , their children became giants , of whom so many legends are told .
TLB	Genesis	6	5	When the Lord God saw the extent of human wickedness , and that the trend and direction of men ’ s lives were only towards evil ,
TLB	Genesis	6	7	And he said , “ I will blot out from the face of the earth all mankind that I created . Yes , and the animals too , and the reptiles and the birds . For I am sorry I made them. ”
TLB	Genesis	6	8	But Noah was a pleasure to the Lord . Here is the story of Noah : 9-10 He was the only truly righteous man living on the earth at that time . He tried always to conduct his affairs according to God ’ s will . And he had three sons—Shem , Ham , and Japheth .
TLB	Genesis	6	11	Meanwhile , the crime rate was rising rapidly across the earth , and , as seen by God , the world was rotten to the core . 12-13 As God observed how bad it was , and saw that all mankind was vicious and depraved , he said to Noah , “ I have decided to destroy all mankind ; for the earth is filled with crime because of man . Yes , I will destroy mankind from the earth .
TLB	Genesis	6	14	Make a boat from resinous wood , sealing it with tar ; and construct decks and stalls throughout the ship .
TLB	Genesis	6	15	Make it

TLB	Genesis	6	75	feet wide , and
TLB	Genesis	6	45	feet high .
TLB	Genesis	6	16	Construct a skylight all the way around the ship , eighteen inches below the roof ; and make three decks inside the boat—a bottom , middle , and upper deck—and put a door in the side .
TLB	Genesis	6	17	“ Look ! I am going to cover the earth with a flood and destroy every living being—everything in which there is the breath of life . All will die .
TLB	Genesis	6	18	But I promise to keep you safe in the ship , with your wife and your sons and their wives . 19-20 Bring a pair of every animal—a male and a female—into the boat with you , to keep them alive through the flood . Bring in a pair of each kind of bird and animal and reptile .
TLB	Genesis	6	21	Store away in the boat all the food that they and you will need. ”

TLB	Genesis	7	7	He boarded the boat with his wife and sons and their wives , to escape the flood . 8-9 With him were all the various kinds of animals—those for eating and sacrifice , and those that were not , and the birds and reptiles . They came into the boat in pairs , male and female , just as God commanded Noah . 10-12 One week later , when Noah was
TLB	Genesis	7	2	Bring in the animals , too—a pair of each , except those kinds I have chosen for eating and for sacrifice : take seven pairs of each of them ,
TLB	Genesis	7	3	and seven pairs [ a ] of every kind of bird . Thus there will be every kind of life reproducing again after the flood has ended .
TLB	Genesis	7	4	One week from today I will begin forty days and nights of rain ; and all the animals and birds and reptiles I have made will die. ”
TLB	Genesis	7	5	So Noah did everything the Lord commanded him .
TLB	Genesis	7	6	He was
TLB	Genesis	7	600	years , two months , and seventeen days old , the rain came down in mighty torrents from the sky , and the subterranean waters burst forth upon the earth for forty days and nights .
TLB	Genesis	7	13	But Noah had gone into the boat that very day with his wife and his sons , Shem , Ham , and Japheth , and their wives . 14-15 With them in the boat were pairs of every kind of animal—domestic and wild—and reptiles and birds of every sort .
TLB	Genesis	7	16	Two by two they came , male and female , just as God had commanded . Then the Lord God [ b ] closed the door and shut them in .
TLB	Genesis	7	17	For forty days the roaring floods prevailed , covering the ground and lifting the boat high above the earth .
TLB	Genesis	7	18	As the water rose higher and higher above the ground , the boat floated safely upon it ;
TLB	Genesis	7	19	until finally the water covered all the high mountains under the whole heaven ,
TLB	Genesis	7	20	standing twenty-two feet and more above the highest peaks .
TLB	Genesis	7	21	And all living things upon the earth perished—birds , domestic and wild animals , and reptiles and all mankind—
TLB	Genesis	7	22	everything that breathed and lived upon dry land .
TLB	Genesis	7	23	All existence on the earth was blotted out—man and animals alike , and reptiles and birds . God destroyed them all , leaving only Noah alive , and those with him in the boat .
TLB	Genesis	7	24	And the water covered the earth
TLB	Genesis	7	150	days . Footnotes - Genesis 7:3 seven pairs , literally , “ the male and female. ” - Genesis 7:16 the Lord God , literally , “ Jehovah. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Genesis	8	8	Meanwhile he sent out a dove to see if it could find dry ground ,
TLB	Genesis	8	2	for the subterranean water sources ceased their gushing , and the torrential rains subsided . 3-4 So the flood gradually receded until ,
TLB	Genesis	8	150	days after it began , the boat came to rest upon the mountains of Ararat .
TLB	Genesis	8	5	Three months later , [ a ] as the waters continued to go down , other mountain peaks appeared .
TLB	Genesis	8	6	After another forty days , Noah opened a porthole
TLB	Genesis	8	7	and released a raven that flew back and forth [ b ] until the earth was dry .
TLB	Genesis	8	9	but the dove found no place to light , and returned to Noah , for the water was still too high . So Noah held out his hand and drew the dove back into the boat .
TLB	Genesis	8	10	Seven days later Noah released the dove again ,
TLB	Genesis	8	11	and this time , toward evening , the bird returned to him with an olive leaf in her beak . So Noah knew that the water was almost gone .
TLB	Genesis	8	12	A week later he released the dove again , and this time she didn ’ t come back .
TLB	Genesis	8	13	Twenty-nine days after that , [ c ] Noah opened the door to look , and the water was gone .
TLB	Genesis	8	14	Eight more weeks went by . Then at last the earth was dry . 15-16 Then God told Noah , “ You may all go out .
TLB	Genesis	8	17	Release all the animals , birds , and reptiles , so that they will breed abundantly and reproduce in great numbers. ” 18-19 So the boat was soon empty . Noah , his wife , and his sons and their wives all disembarked , along with all the animals , reptiles , and birds—all left the ark in pairs and groups .

TLB	Genesis	9	9	God blessed Noah and his sons and told them to have many children and to repopulate the earth . 2-3 “ All wild animals and birds and fish will be afraid of you , ” God told him ; “ for I have placed them in your power , and they are yours to use for food , in addition to grain and vegetables .
TLB	Genesis	9	4	But never eat animals unless their life-blood has been drained off . 5-6 And murder is forbidden . Man-killing animals must die , and any man who murders shall be killed ; for to kill a man is to kill one made like God .
TLB	Genesis	9	7	Yes , have many children and repopulate the earth and subdue it. ”
TLB	Genesis	9	8	Then God told Noah and his sons , 9-11 “ I solemnly promise you and your children [ a ] and the animals you brought with you—all these birds and cattle and wild animals—that I will never again send another flood to destroy the earth .
TLB	Genesis	9	12	And I seal this promise with this sign :
TLB	Genesis	9	13	I have placed my rainbow in the clouds as a sign of my promise until the end of time , to you and to all the earth .
TLB	Genesis	9	14	When I send clouds over the earth , the rainbow will be seen in the clouds ,
TLB	Genesis	9	15	and I will remember my promise to you and to every being , that never again will the floods come and destroy all life . 16-17 For I will see the rainbow in the cloud and remember my eternal promise to every living being on the earth. ”
TLB	Genesis	9	18	The names of Noah ’ s three sons were Shem , Ham , and Japheth . ( Ham is the ancestor of the Canaanites . ) [ b ]
TLB	Genesis	9	19	From these three sons of Noah came all the nations of the earth . 20-21 Noah became a farmer and planted a vineyard , and he made wine . One day as he was drunk and lay naked in his tent ,
TLB	Genesis	9	22	Ham , the father of Canaan , saw his father ’ s nakedness and went outside and told his two brothers .
TLB	Genesis	9	23	Then Shem and Japheth took a robe and held it over their shoulders and , walking backwards into the tent , let it fall across their father to cover his nakedness as they looked the other way . 24-25 When Noah awoke from his drunken stupor , and learned what had happened and what Ham , his younger son , had done , he cursed Ham ’ s descendants : [ c ] “ A curse upon the Canaanites , ” he swore . “ May they be the lowest of slaves To the descendants of Shem and Japheth. ” 26-27 Then he said , “ God bless Shem , And may Canaan be his slave . [ d ] God bless Japheth , And let him share the prosperity of Shem , And let Canaan be his slave. ”

TLB	Genesis	10	10	The heart of his empire included Babel , Erech , Accad , and Calneh in the land of Shinar . 11-12 From there he extended his reign to Assyria . He built Nineveh , Rehoboth-Ir , Calah , and Resen ( which is located between Nineveh and Calah ) , the main city of the empire . 13-14 Mizraim was the ancestor [ d ] of the people inhabiting these areas : Ludim , Anamim , Lehabim , Naphtuhim , Pathrusim , Casluhim ( from whom came the Philistines ) , and Caphtorim . 15-19 Canaan ’ s oldest son was Sidon , and he was also the father of Heth ; from Canaan descended these nations : Jebusites , Amorites , Girgashites , Hivites , Arkites , Sinites , Arvadites , Zemarites , Hamathites . Eventually the descendants of Canaan spread from Sidon all the way to Gerar , in the Gaza strip ; and to Sodom , Gomorrah , Admah , and Zeboiim , near Lasha .
TLB	Genesis	10	2	The sons [ a ] of Japheth were : Gomer , Magog , Madai , Javan , Tubal , Meshech , Tiras .
TLB	Genesis	10	3	The sons of Gomer : Ashkenaz , Riphath , Togarmah .
TLB	Genesis	10	4	The sons of Javan : Elishah , Tarshish , Kittim , Dodanim .
TLB	Genesis	10	5	Their descendants became the maritime nations in various lands , each with a separate language .
TLB	Genesis	10	6	The sons of Ham were : Cush , Mizraim , Put , Canaan .
TLB	Genesis	10	7	The sons of Cush were : Seba , Havilah , Sabtah , Raamah , Sabteca . The sons of Raamah were : Sheba , Dedan .
TLB	Genesis	10	8	One of the descendants [ b ] of Cush was Nimrod , who became the first of the kings .
TLB	Genesis	10	9	He was a mighty hunter , blessed of God , [ c ] and his name became proverbial . People would speak of someone as being “ like Nimrod—a mighty hunter , blessed of God. ”
TLB	Genesis	10	20	These , then , were the descendants of Ham , spread abroad in many lands and nations , with many languages .
TLB	Genesis	10	21	Eber descended from Shem , the oldest brother of Japheth .
TLB	Genesis	10	22	Here is a list of Shem ’ s other descendants : Elam , Asshur , Arpachshad , Lud , Aram .
TLB	Genesis	10	23	Aram ’ s sons [ e ] were : Uz , Hul , Gether , Mash .
TLB	Genesis	10	24	Arpachshad ’ s son was Shelah , and Shelah ’ s son was Eber .
TLB	Genesis	10	25	Two sons were born to Eber : Peleg ( meaning “ Division , ” for during his lifetime the people of the world were separated and dispersed ) , and Joktan ( Peleg ’ s brother ) . 26-30 Joktan was the father [ f ] of Almodad , Sheleph , Hazarmaveth , Jerah , Hadoram , Uzal , Diklah , Obal , Abima-el , Sheba , Ophir , Havi-lah , Jobab . These descendants of Joktan lived all the way from Mesha to the eastern hills of Sephar .
TLB	Genesis	10	31	These , then , were the descendants of Shem , classified according to their political groupings , languages , and geographical locations .
TLB	Genesis	10	32	All of the men listed above descended from Noah , through many generations , living in the various nations that developed after the flood .

TLB	Genesis	11	11	At that time all mankind spoke a single language .
TLB	Genesis	11	2	As the population grew and spread eastward , a plain was discovered in the land of Babylon and was soon thickly populated . 3-4 The people who lived there began to talk about building a great city , with a temple-tower reaching to the skies—a proud , eternal monument to themselves . “ This will weld us together , ” they said , “ and keep us from scattering all over the world. ” So they made great piles of hard-burned brick , and collected bitumen to use as mortar .
TLB	Genesis	11	5	But when God came down to see the city and the tower mankind was making ,
TLB	Genesis	11	6	he said , “ Look ! If they are able to accomplish all this when they have just begun to exploit their linguistic and political unity , just think of what they will do later ! Nothing will be unattainable for them ! [ a ]
TLB	Genesis	11	7	Come , let us go down and give them different languages , so that they won ’ t understand each other ’ s words ! ”
TLB	Genesis	11	8	So , in that way , God scattered them all over the earth ; and that ended the building of the city .
TLB	Genesis	11	9	That is why the city was called Babel ( meaning “ confusion ” ) , because it was there that Jehovah confused them by giving them many languages , thus widely scattering them across the face of the earth . 10-11 Shem ’ s line of descendants included Arpachshad , born two years after the flood when Shem was
TLB	Genesis	11	100	years old ; after that he lived another
TLB	Genesis	11	500	years and had many sons and daughters . 12-13 When Arpachshad was thirty-five years old , his son Shelah was born , [ b ] and after that he lived another
TLB	Genesis	11	403	years after that , and had many sons and daughters . 16-17 Eber was thirty-four years old when his son Peleg was born . He lived another
TLB	Genesis	11	430	years afterwards and had many sons and daughters . 18-19 Peleg was thirty years old when his son Reu was born . He lived another
TLB	Genesis	11	209	years afterwards and had many sons and daughters . 20-21 Reu was thirty-two years old when Serug was born . He lived
TLB	Genesis	11	207	years after that , with many sons and daughters . 22-23 Serug was thirty years old when his son Nahor was born . He lived
TLB	Genesis	11	200	years afterwards , with many sons and daughters . 24-25 Nahor was twenty-nine years old at the birth of his son Terah . He lived
TLB	Genesis	11	119	years afterwards and had sons and daughters .
TLB	Genesis	11	26	By the time Terah was seventy years old , he had three sons , Abram , Nahor , and Haran .
TLB	Genesis	11	27	And Haran had a son named Lot .
TLB	Genesis	11	28	But Haran died young , in the land where he was born ( in Ur of the Chaldeans ) , and was survived by his father .
TLB	Genesis	11	29	Meanwhile , Abram married his half sister [ c ] Sarai , while his brother Nahor married their orphaned niece , Milcah , who was the daughter of their brother Haran ; and she had a sister named Iscah .
TLB	Genesis	11	30	But Sarai was barren ; she had no children .
TLB	Genesis	11	31	Then Terah took his son Abram , his grandson Lot ( his son Haran ’ s child ) , and his daughter-in-law Sarai , and left Ur of the Chaldeans to go to the land of Canaan ; but they stopped instead at the city of Haran and settled there .
TLB	Genesis	11	32	And there Terah died at the age of
TLB	Genesis	11	205	, implied . The Samaritan Pentateuch says that Terah died when he was
TLB	Genesis	11	145	years old , so that his death occurred in the year of Abraham ’ s departure from Haran . This is more consistent with 11:26 and 12:4 . See also Acts 7:4 . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Genesis	12	12	God had told Abram , “ Leave your own country behind you , and your own people , and go to the land I will guide you to .
TLB	Genesis	12	2	If you do , I will cause you to become the father of a great nation ; I will bless you and make your name famous , and you will be a blessing to many others . [ a ]
TLB	Genesis	12	3	I will bless those who bless you and curse those who curse you ; and the entire world will be blessed because of you. ” [ b ]
TLB	Genesis	12	4	So Abram departed as the Lord had instructed him , and Lot went too ; Abram was seventy-five years old at that time .
TLB	Genesis	12	5	He took his wife Sarai , his nephew Lot , and all his wealth—the cattle and slaves he had gotten in Haran—and finally arrived in Canaan .
TLB	Genesis	12	6	Traveling through Canaan , they came to a place near Shechem , and set up camp beside the oak at Moreh . ( This area was inhabited by Canaanites at that time . )
TLB	Genesis	12	7	Then Jehovah appeared to Abram and said , “ I am going to give this land to your descendants. ” And Abram built an altar there to commemorate Jehovah ’ s visit .
TLB	Genesis	12	8	Afterwards Abram left that place and traveled southward [ c ] to the hilly country between Bethel on the west and Ai on the east . There he made camp , and made an altar to the Lord and prayed to him .
TLB	Genesis	12	9	Thus he continued slowly southward to the Negeb , pausing frequently .
TLB	Genesis	12	10	There was at that time a terrible famine in the land : and so Abram went on down to Egypt to live . 11-13 But as he was approaching the borders of Egypt , he asked Sarai his wife to tell everyone that she was his sister ! “ You are very beautiful , ” he told her , “ and when the Egyptians see you they will say , ‘ This is his wife . Let ’ s kill him and then we can have her ! ’ But if you say you are my sister , then the Egyptians will treat me well because of you , and spare my life ! ”
TLB	Genesis	12	14	And sure enough , when they arrived in Egypt everyone spoke of her beauty .
TLB	Genesis	12	15	When the palace aides saw her , they praised her to their king , the Pharaoh , and she was taken into his harem . [ d ]
TLB	Genesis	12	16	Then Pharaoh gave Abram many gifts because of her—sheep , oxen , donkeys , men and women slaves , and camels .
TLB	Genesis	12	17	But the Lord sent a terrible plague upon Pharaoh ’ s household on account of her being there .
TLB	Genesis	12	18	Then Pharaoh called Abram before him and accused him sharply . “ What is this you have done to me ? ” he demanded . “ Why didn ’ t you tell me she was your wife ?
TLB	Genesis	12	19	Why were you willing to let me marry her , saying she was your sister ? Here , take her and be gone ! ”
TLB	Genesis	12	20	And Pharaoh sent them out of the country under armed escort—Abram , his wife , and all his household and possessions .

TLB	Genesis	13	13	The men of this area were unusually wicked , and sinned greatly against Jehovah .
TLB	Genesis	13	5	Lot too was very wealthy , with sheep and cattle and many servants . [ a ]
TLB	Genesis	13	6	But the land could not support both Abram and Lot with all their flocks and herds . There were too many animals for the available pasture .
TLB	Genesis	13	7	So fights broke out between the herdsmen of Abram and Lot , despite the danger they all faced [ b ] from the tribes of Canaanites and Perizzites present in the land .
TLB	Genesis	13	8	Then Abram talked it over with Lot . “ This fighting between our men has got to stop , ” he said . “ We can ’ t afford to let a rift develop between our clans . Close relatives such as we are must present a united front !
TLB	Genesis	13	9	I ’ ll tell you what we ’ ll do . Take your choice of any section of the land you want , and we will separate . If you want that part over there to the east , then I ’ ll stay here in the western section . Or , if you want the west , then I ’ ll go over there to the east. ”
TLB	Genesis	13	10	Lot took a long look at the fertile plains of the Jordan River , well watered everywhere ( this was before Jehovah destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah ) ; the whole section was like the Garden of Eden , [ c ] or like the beautiful countryside around Zoar in Egypt .
TLB	Genesis	13	11	So that is what Lot chose—the Jordan Valley to the east of them . He went there with his flocks and servants , and thus he and Abram parted company .
TLB	Genesis	13	12	For Abram stayed in the land of Canaan , while Lot lived among the cities of the plain , settling at a place near the city of Sodom .
TLB	Genesis	13	14	After Lot was gone , the Lord said to Abram , “ Look as far as you can see in every direction ,
TLB	Genesis	13	15	for I am going to give it all to you and your descendants .
TLB	Genesis	13	16	And I am going to give you so many descendants that , like dust , they can ’ t be counted !
TLB	Genesis	13	17	Hike in all directions and explore the new possessions I am giving you. ”
TLB	Genesis	13	18	Then Abram moved his tent to the oaks of Mamre , near Hebron , and built an altar to Jehovah there .

TLB	Genesis	14	14	When Abram learned that Lot had been captured , he called together the men born into his household ,
TLB	Genesis	14	2	fought against : Bera , king of Sodom , Birsha , king of Gomorrah , Shinab , king of Admah , Shemeber , king of Zeboiim , and the king of Bela ( later called Zoar ) .
TLB	Genesis	14	3	These kings ( of Sodom , Gomorrah , Admah , Zeboiim , and Bela ) mobilized their armies in Siddim Valley ( that is , the valley of the Dead Sea ) .
TLB	Genesis	14	4	For twelve years they had all been subject to King Chedorlaomer , but now in the thirteenth year , they rebelled . 5-6 One year later , Chedorlaomer and his allies arrived and the slaughter began . For they were victorious over the following tribes at the places indicated : the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim ; the Zuzim in Ham ; the Emim in the plain of Kiriathaim ; the Horites in Mount Seir , as far as El-paran at the edge of the desert .
TLB	Genesis	14	7	Then they swung around to Enmishpat ( later called Kadesh ) and destroyed the Amalekites , and also the Amorites living in Hazazan-tamar . 8-9 But now the other army , that of the kings of Sodom , Gomorrah , Admah , Zeboiim , and Bela ( Zoar ) , unsuccessfully [ a ] attacked Chedorlaomer and his allies as they were in the Dead Sea Valley ( four kings against five ) .
TLB	Genesis	14	10	As it happened , the valley was full of asphalt pits . And as the army of the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled , some slipped into the pits , and the remainder fled to the mountains .
TLB	Genesis	14	11	Then the victors plundered [ b ] Sodom and Gomorrah and carried off all their wealth and food , and went on their homeward way ,
TLB	Genesis	14	12	taking with them Lot—Abram ’ s nephew [ c ] who lived in Sodom—and all he owned .
TLB	Genesis	14	13	One of the men who escaped came and told Abram the Hebrew , who was camping among the oaks belonging to Mamre the Amorite ( brother of Eshcol and Aner , Abram ’ s allies ) .
TLB	Genesis	14	318	of them in all , and chased after the retiring army as far as Dan .
TLB	Genesis	14	15	He divided his men and attacked during the night from several directions , and pursued the fleeing army to Hobah , north of Damascus ,
TLB	Genesis	14	16	and recovered everything—the loot that had been taken , his relative Lot , and all of Lot ’ s possessions , including the women and other captives .
TLB	Genesis	14	17	As Abram returned from his strike against Chedorlaomer and the other kings at the valley of Shaveh ( later called King ’ s Valley ) , the king of Sodom came out to meet him ,
TLB	Genesis	14	18	and Melchizedek , the king of Salem ( Jerusalem ) , who was a priest of the God of Highest Heaven , brought him bread and wine . 19-20 Then Melchizedek blessed Abram with this blessing : “ The blessing of the supreme God , Creator of heaven and earth , be upon you , Abram ; and blessed be God , who has delivered your enemies over to you. ” Then Abram gave Melchizedek a tenth of all the loot .
TLB	Genesis	14	21	The king of Sodom told him , “ Just give me back my people who were captured ; keep for yourself the booty stolen from my city. ”
TLB	Genesis	14	22	But Abram replied , “ I have solemnly promised Jehovah , the supreme God , Creator of heaven and earth ,
TLB	Genesis	14	23	that I will not take so much as a single thread from you , lest you say , ‘ Abram is rich because of what I gave him ! ’
TLB	Genesis	14	24	All I ’ ll accept is what these young men of mine have eaten ; but give a share of the loot to Aner , Eshcol , and Mamre , my allies. ” Footnotes - Genesis 14:8 unsuccessfully , implied . - Genesis 14:11 the victors plundered , implied . - Genesis 14:12 Abram ’ s nephew , literally , “ Abram ’ s brother ’ s son. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Genesis	15	15	( But you will die in peace , at a ripe old age . )
TLB	Genesis	15	4	Then Jehovah told him , “ No , no one else will be your heir , for you will have a son to inherit everything you own. ”
TLB	Genesis	15	5	Then God brought Abram outside beneath the nighttime sky and told him , “ Look up into the heavens and count the stars if you can . Your descendants will be like that—too many to count ! ”
TLB	Genesis	15	6	And Abram believed God ; then God considered him righteous on account of his faith .
TLB	Genesis	15	7	And he told him , “ I am Jehovah who brought you out of the city of Ur of the Chaldeans , to give you this land. ”
TLB	Genesis	15	8	But Abram replied , “ O Lord Jehovah , how can I be sure that you will give it to me ? ”
TLB	Genesis	15	9	Then Jehovah told him to take a three-year-old heifer , a three-year-old female goat , a three-year-old ram , a turtledove and a young pigeon ,
TLB	Genesis	15	10	and to slay them and to cut them apart down the middle , and to separate the halves , but not to divide the birds .
TLB	Genesis	15	11	And when the vultures came down upon the carcasses , Abram shooed them away .
TLB	Genesis	15	12	That evening as the sun was going down , a deep sleep fell upon Abram , and a vision of terrible foreboding , darkness , and horror .
TLB	Genesis	15	13	Then Jehovah told Abram , “ Your descendants will be oppressed as slaves in a foreign land for
TLB	Genesis	15	400	years .
TLB	Genesis	15	14	But I will punish the nation that enslaves them , and at the end they will come away with great wealth .
TLB	Genesis	15	16	After four generations they will return here to this land ; for the wickedness of the Amorite nations living here now [ b ] will not be ready for punishment until then. ”
TLB	Genesis	15	17	As the sun went down and it was dark , Abram saw a smoking firepot and a flaming torch that passed between the halves of the carcasses .
TLB	Genesis	15	18	So that day Jehovah made this covenant with Abram : “ I have given this land to your descendants from the Wadi-el-Arish [ c ] to the Euphrates River . 19-21 And I give to them these nations : Kenites , Kenizzites , Kadmonites , Hittites , Perizzites , Rephaim , Amorites , Canaanites , Girgashites , Jebusites. ” Footnotes - Genesis 15:2 some other member of my household was Eliezer of Damascus . - Genesis 15:16 Amorite nations living here now , implied . - Genesis 15:18 Wadi-el-Arish , literally , “ River of Egypt , ” at the southern border of Judah .

TLB	Genesis	16	4	So he slept with Hagar , and she conceived ; and when she realized she was pregnant , she became very proud and arrogant toward her mistress Sarai .
TLB	Genesis	16	5	Then Sarai said to Abram , “ It ’ s all your fault . For now this servant girl of mine despises me , though I myself gave her the privilege of being your wife . May the Lord judge you for doing this to me ! ” [ a ]
TLB	Genesis	16	6	“ You have my permission to punish the girl as you see fit , ” Abram replied . So Sarai beat her and she ran away .
TLB	Genesis	16	7	The Angel of the Lord found her beside a desert spring along the road to Shur .
TLB	Genesis	16	8	The Angel : “ Hagar , Sarai ’ s maid , where have you come from , and where are you going ? ” Hagar : “ I am running away from my mistress. ” 9-12 The Angel : “ Return to your mistress and act as you should , for I will make you into a great nation . Yes , you are pregnant and your baby will be a son , and you are to name him Ishmael ( ‘ God hears ’ ) , because God has heard your woes . This son of yours will be a wild one—free and untamed as a wild ass ! He will be against everyone , and everyone will feel the same toward him . But he will live near the rest of his kin. ”
TLB	Genesis	16	13	Thereafter [ b ] Hagar spoke of Jehovah—for it was he who appeared to her—as “ the God who looked upon me , ” for she thought , “ I saw God and lived to tell it. ”
TLB	Genesis	16	14	Later that well was named “ The Well of the Living One Who Sees Me. ” It lies between Kadesh and Bered .

TLB	Genesis	17	13	All must be circumcised . Your bodies will thus be marked as participants in my everlasting covenant .
TLB	Genesis	17	14	Anyone who refuses these terms shall be cut off from his people ; for he has violated my contract. ”
TLB	Genesis	17	15	Then God added , “ Regarding Sarai your wife—her name is no longer ‘ Sarai ’ but ‘ Sarah ’ ( ‘ Princess ’ ) .
TLB	Genesis	17	16	And I will bless her and give you a son from her ! Yes , I will bless her richly , and make her the mother of nations ! Many kings shall be among your posterity. ”
TLB	Genesis	17	90	? ”
TLB	Genesis	17	18	And Abraham said to God , “ Yes , do bless Ishmael ! ”
TLB	Genesis	17	19	“ No , ” God replied , “ that isn ’ t what I said . Sarah shall bear you a son ; and you are to name him Isaac ( ‘ Laughter ’ ) , and I will sign my covenant with him forever , and with his descendants .
TLB	Genesis	17	20	As for Ishmael , all right , I will bless him also , just as you have asked me to . I will cause him to multiply and become a great nation . Twelve princes shall be among his posterity .
TLB	Genesis	17	21	But my contract is with Isaac , who will be born to you and Sarah next year at about this time. ”
TLB	Genesis	17	22	That ended the conversation and God left .
TLB	Genesis	17	23	Then , that very day , Abraham took Ishmael his son and every other male—born in his household or bought from outside—and cut off their foreskins , just as God had told him to . 24-27 Abraham was ninety-nine years old at that time , and Ishmael was thirteen . Both were circumcised the same day , along with all the other men and boys of the household , whether born there or bought as slaves .

TLB	Genesis	18	18	“ For Abraham shall become a mighty nation , and he will be a source of blessing for all the nations of the earth .
TLB	Genesis	18	2	he suddenly noticed three men coming toward him . He sprang up and ran to meet them and welcomed them . 3-4 “ Sirs , ” he said , “ please don ’ t go any farther . Stop awhile and rest here in the shade of this tree while I get water to refresh your feet ,
TLB	Genesis	18	5	and a bite to eat to strengthen you . Do stay awhile before continuing your journey. ” “ All right , ” they said , “ do as you have said. ”
TLB	Genesis	18	6	Then Abraham ran back to the tent and said to Sarah , “ Quick ! Mix up some pancakes ! [ a ] Use your best flour , and make enough for the three of them ! ”
TLB	Genesis	18	7	Then he ran out to the herd and selected a fat calf and told a servant to hurry and butcher it .
TLB	Genesis	18	8	Soon , taking them cheese and milk and the roast veal , he set it before the men and stood beneath the trees beside them as they ate .
TLB	Genesis	18	9	“ Where is Sarah , your wife ? ” they asked him . “ In the tent , ” Abraham replied .
TLB	Genesis	18	10	Then the Lord said , “ Next year [ b ] I will give you and Sarah a son ! ” ( Sarah was listening from the tent door behind him . )
TLB	Genesis	18	11	Now Abraham and Sarah were both very old , and Sarah was long since past the time when she could have a baby .
TLB	Genesis	18	12	So Sarah laughed silently . “ A woman my age have a baby ? ” she scoffed to herself . “ And with a husband as old as mine ? ”
TLB	Genesis	18	13	Then God said to Abraham , “ Why did Sarah laugh ? Why did she say ‘ Can an old woman like me have a baby ? ’
TLB	Genesis	18	14	Is anything too hard for God ? Next year , just as I told you , I will certainly see to it that Sarah has a son. ”
TLB	Genesis	18	15	But Sarah denied it . “ I didn ’ t laugh , ” she lied , for she was afraid .
TLB	Genesis	18	16	Then the men stood up from their meal and started on toward Sodom ; and Abraham went with them part of the way .
TLB	Genesis	18	17	“ Should I hide my plan from Abraham ? ” God asked .
TLB	Genesis	18	19	And I have picked him out to have godly descendants and a godly household—men who are just and good—so that I can do for him all I have promised. ”
TLB	Genesis	18	20	So the Lord told Abraham , “ I have heard that the people of Sodom and Gomorrah are utterly evil , and that everything they do is wicked .
TLB	Genesis	18	21	I am going down to see whether these reports are true or not . Then I will know. ” 22-23 So the other two went on toward Sodom , but the Lord remained with Abraham a while . Then Abraham approached him and said , “ Will you kill good and bad alike ?
TLB	Genesis	18	24	Suppose you find fifty godly people there within the city—will you destroy it , and not spare it for their sakes ?
TLB	Genesis	18	25	That wouldn ’ t be right ! Surely you wouldn ’ t do such a thing , to kill the godly with the wicked ! Why , you would be treating godly and wicked exactly the same ! Surely you wouldn ’ t do that ! Should not the Judge of all the earth be fair ? ”
TLB	Genesis	18	26	And God replied , “ If I find fifty godly people there , I will spare the entire city for their sake. ”
TLB	Genesis	18	27	Then Abraham spoke again . “ Since I have begun , let me go on and speak further to the Lord , though I am but dust and ashes .
TLB	Genesis	18	28	Suppose there are only forty-five ? Will you destroy the city for lack of five ? ” And God said , “ I will not destroy it if I find forty-five. ”
TLB	Genesis	18	29	Then Abraham went further with his request . “ Suppose there are only forty ? ” And God replied , “ I won ’ t destroy it if there are forty. ”
TLB	Genesis	18	30	“ Please don ’ t be angry , ” Abraham pleaded . “ Let me speak : suppose only thirty are found there ? ” And God replied , “ I won ’ t do it if there are thirty there. ”
TLB	Genesis	18	31	Then Abraham said , “ Since I have dared to speak to God , let me continue—suppose there are only twenty ? ” And God said , “ Then I won ’ t destroy it for the sake of the twenty. ”
TLB	Genesis	18	32	Finally , Abraham said , “ Oh , let not the Lord be angry ; I will speak but this once more ! Suppose only ten are found ? ” And God said , “ Then , for the sake of the ten , I won ’ t destroy it. ”
TLB	Genesis	18	33	And the Lord went on his way when he had finished his conversation with Abraham . And Abraham returned to his tent .

TLB	Genesis	19	19	That evening the two angels came to the entrance of the city of Sodom , and Lot was sitting there as they arrived . When he saw them he stood up to meet them , and welcomed them .
TLB	Genesis	19	2	“ Sirs , ” he said , “ come to my home as my guests for the night ; you can get up as early as you like and be on your way again. ” “ Oh , no thanks , ” they said , “ we ’ ll just stretch out here along the street. ”
TLB	Genesis	19	3	But he was very urgent , until at last they went home with him , and he set a great feast before them , complete with freshly baked unleavened bread . After the meal ,
TLB	Genesis	19	4	as they were preparing to retire for the night , the men of the city—yes , Sodomites , young and old from all over the city—surrounded the house
TLB	Genesis	19	5	and shouted to Lot , “ Bring out those men to us so we can rape them. ”
TLB	Genesis	19	6	Lot stepped outside to talk to them , shutting the door behind him .
TLB	Genesis	19	7	“ Please , fellows , ” he begged , “ don ’ t do such a wicked thing .
TLB	Genesis	19	8	Look—I have two virgin daughters , and I ’ ll surrender them to you to do with as you wish . But leave these men alone , for they are under my protection. ”
TLB	Genesis	19	9	“ Stand back , ” they yelled . “ Who do you think you are ? We let this fellow settle among us and now he tries to tell us what to do ! We ’ ll deal with you far worse than with those other men. ” And they lunged at Lot and began breaking down the door .
TLB	Genesis	19	10	But the two men reached out and pulled Lot in and bolted the door
TLB	Genesis	19	11	and temporarily blinded the men of Sodom so that they couldn ’ t find the door .
TLB	Genesis	19	12	“ What relatives do you have here in the city ? ” the men asked . “ Get them out of this place—sons-in-law , sons , daughters , or anyone else .
TLB	Genesis	19	13	For we will destroy the city completely . The stench of the place has reached to heaven and God has sent us to destroy it. ”
TLB	Genesis	19	14	So Lot rushed out to tell his daughters ’ fiancés , “ Quick , get out of the city , for the Lord is going to destroy it. ” But the young men looked at him as though he had lost his senses .
TLB	Genesis	19	15	At dawn the next morning the angels became urgent . “ Hurry , ” they said to Lot , “ take your wife and your two daughters who are here and get out while you can , or you will be caught in the destruction of the city. ”
TLB	Genesis	19	16	When Lot still hesitated , the angels seized his hand and the hands of his wife and two daughters and rushed them to safety , outside the city , for the Lord was merciful .
TLB	Genesis	19	17	“ Flee for your lives , ” the angels told him . “ And don ’ t look back . Escape to the mountains . Don ’ t stay down here on the plain or you will die. ” 18-20 “ Oh no , sirs , please , ” Lot begged , “ since you ’ ve been so kind to me and saved my life , and you ’ ve granted me such mercy , let me flee to that little village over there instead of into the mountains , for I fear disaster in the mountains . See , the village is close by and it is just a small one . Please , please , let me go there instead . Don ’ t you see how small it is ? And my life will be saved. ”
TLB	Genesis	19	21	“ All right , ” the angel said , “ I accept your proposition and won ’ t destroy that little city .
TLB	Genesis	19	22	But hurry ! For I can do nothing until you are there. ” ( From that time on that village was named Zoar , meaning “ Little City. ” )
TLB	Genesis	19	23	The sun was rising as Lot reached the village .
TLB	Genesis	19	24	Then the Lord rained down fire and flaming tar from heaven upon Sodom and Gomorrah ,
TLB	Genesis	19	25	and utterly destroyed them , along with the other cities and villages of the plain , eliminating all life—people , plants , and animals alike .
TLB	Genesis	19	26	But Lot ’ s wife looked back as she was following along behind him and became a pillar of salt .
TLB	Genesis	19	27	That morning Abraham was up early and hurried out to the place where he had stood before the Lord .
TLB	Genesis	19	28	He looked out across the plain to Sodom and Gomorrah and saw columns of smoke and fumes , as from a furnace , rising from the cities there .
TLB	Genesis	19	29	So God heeded Abraham ’ s plea and kept Lot safe , removing him from the maelstrom of death that engulfed the cities .
TLB	Genesis	19	30	Afterwards Lot left Zoar , fearful of the people there , and went to live in a cave in the mountains with his two daughters .
TLB	Genesis	19	31	One day the older girl said to her sister , “ There isn ’ t a man anywhere in this entire area that our father would let us marry . And our father will soon be too old for having children .
TLB	Genesis	19	32	Come , let ’ s fill him with wine and then we will sleep with him , so that our clan will not come to an end. ”
TLB	Genesis	19	33	So they got him drunk that night , and the older girl went in and had sexual intercourse with her father ; but he was unaware of her lying down or getting up again .
TLB	Genesis	19	34	The next morning she said to her younger sister , “ I slept with my father last night . Let ’ s fill him with wine again tonight , and you go in and lie with him , so that our family line will continue. ”
TLB	Genesis	19	35	So they got him drunk again that night , and the younger girl went in and lay with him , and , as before , he didn ’ t know that anyone was there .
TLB	Genesis	19	36	And so it was that both girls became pregnant from their father .
TLB	Genesis	19	37	The older girl ’ s baby was named Moab ; he became the ancestor of the nation of the Moabites .
TLB	Genesis	19	38	The name of the younger girl ’ s baby was Benammi ; he became the ancestor of the nation of the Ammonites . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Genesis	20	20	Now Abraham moved south to the Negeb and settled between Kadesh and Shur . One day , when visiting the city of Gerar ,
TLB	Genesis	20	2	he declared that Sarah was his sister ! Then King Abimelech sent for her , and had her brought to him at his palace .
TLB	Genesis	20	3	But that night God came to him in a dream and told him , “ You are a dead man , for that woman you took is married. ”
TLB	Genesis	20	4	But Abimelech hadn ’ t slept with her yet , so he said , “ Lord , will you slay an innocent man ?
TLB	Genesis	20	5	He told me , ‘ She is my sister , ’ and she herself said , ‘ Yes , he is my brother. ’ I hadn ’ t the slightest intention of doing anything wrong. ”
TLB	Genesis	20	6	“ Yes , I know , ” the Lord replied . “ That is why I held you back from sinning against me ; that is why I didn ’ t let you touch her .
TLB	Genesis	20	7	Now restore her to her husband , and he will pray for you ( for he is a prophet ) and you shall live . But if you don ’ t return her to him , you are doomed to death along with all your household. ”
TLB	Genesis	20	8	The king was up early the next morning , and hastily called a meeting of all the palace personnel and told them what had happened . And great fear swept through the crowd . 9-10 Then the king called for Abraham . “ What is this you ’ ve done to us ? ” he demanded . “ What have I done that deserves treatment like this , to make me and my kingdom guilty of this great sin ? Who would suspect that you would do a thing like this to me ? Whatever made you think of this vile deed ? ” 11-12 “ Well , ” Abraham said , “ I figured this to be a godless place . ‘ They will want my wife and will kill me to get her , ’ I thought . And besides , she is my sister—or at least a half sister ( we both have the same father ) —and I married her .
TLB	Genesis	20	13	And when God sent me traveling far from my childhood home , I told her , ‘ Have the kindness to mention , wherever we come , that you are my sister. ’ ”
TLB	Genesis	20	14	Then King Abimelech took sheep and oxen and servants—both men and women—and gave them to Abraham , and returned Sarah his wife to him .
TLB	Genesis	20	15	“ Look my kingdom over , and choose the place where you want to live , ” the king told him .
TLB	Genesis	20	16	Then he turned to Sarah . “ Look , ” he said , “ I am giving your ‘ brother ’ a thousand silver pieces as damages for what I did , to compensate for any embarrassment and to settle any claim against me regarding this matter . Now justice has been done. ”
TLB	Genesis	20	17	Then Abraham prayed , asking God to cure the king and queen and the other women of the household , so that they could have children ;
TLB	Genesis	20	18	for God had stricken all the women with barrenness to punish Abimelech for taking Abraham ’ s wife . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Genesis	21	21	1-2 Then God did as he had promised , and Sarah became pregnant and gave Abraham a baby son in his old age , at the time God had said ;
TLB	Genesis	21	3	and Abraham named him Isaac ( meaning “ Laughter ! ” ) . 4-5 Eight days after he was born , Abraham circumcised him , as God required . ( Abraham was
TLB	Genesis	21	100	years old at that time . )
TLB	Genesis	21	6	And Sarah declared , “ God has brought me laughter ! All who hear about this shall rejoice with me .
TLB	Genesis	21	7	For who would have dreamed that I would ever have a baby ? Yet I have given Abraham a child in his old age ! ”
TLB	Genesis	21	8	Time went by and the child grew and was weaned ; and Abraham gave a party to celebrate the happy occasion .
TLB	Genesis	21	9	But when Sarah noticed Ishmael—the son of Abraham and the Egyptian girl Hagar—teasing [ a ] Isaac ,
TLB	Genesis	21	10	she turned upon Abraham and demanded , “ Get rid of that slave girl and her son . He is not going to share your property with my son . I won ’ t have it. ”
TLB	Genesis	21	11	This upset Abraham very much , for after all , Ishmael too was his son .
TLB	Genesis	21	12	But God told Abraham , “ Don ’ t be upset over the boy or your slave-girl wife ; do as Sarah says , for Isaac is the son through whom my promise will be fulfilled .
TLB	Genesis	21	13	And I will make a nation of the descendants of the slave girl ’ s son , too , because he also is yours. ”
TLB	Genesis	21	14	So Abraham got up early the next morning , prepared food for the journey , and strapped a canteen of water to Hagar ’ s shoulders and sent her away with their son . She walked out into the wilderness of Beersheba , wandering aimlessly .
TLB	Genesis	21	15	When the water was gone she left the youth in the shade of a bush
TLB	Genesis	21	16	and went off and sat down a hundred yards or so away . “ I don ’ t want to watch him die , ” she said , and burst into tears , sobbing wildly .
TLB	Genesis	21	17	Then God heard the boy crying , and the Angel of God called to Hagar from the sky , “ Hagar , what ’ s wrong ? Don ’ t be afraid ! For God has heard the lad ’ s cries as he is lying there .
TLB	Genesis	21	18	Go and get him and comfort him , for I will make a great nation from his descendants. ”
TLB	Genesis	21	19	Then God opened her eyes and she saw a well ; so she refilled the canteen and gave the lad a drink . 20-21 And God blessed the boy and he grew up in the wilderness of Paran , and became an expert archer . And his mother arranged a marriage for him with a girl from Egypt .
TLB	Genesis	21	22	About this time King Abimelech and Phicol , commander of his troops , came to Abraham and said to him , “ It is evident that God helps you in everything you do ;
TLB	Genesis	21	23	swear to me by God ’ s name that you won ’ t defraud me or my son or my grandson , but that you will be on friendly terms with my country , as I have been toward you. ”
TLB	Genesis	21	24	Abraham replied , “ All right , I swear to it ! ”
TLB	Genesis	21	25	Then Abraham complained to the king about a well the king ’ s servants had taken violently away from Abraham ’ s servants .
TLB	Genesis	21	26	“ This is the first I ’ ve heard of it , ” the king exclaimed , “ and I have no idea who is responsible . Why didn ’ t you tell me before ? ”
TLB	Genesis	21	27	Then Abraham gave sheep and oxen to the king , as sacrifices to seal their pact . 28-29 But when he took seven ewe lambs and set them off by themselves , the king inquired , “ Why are you doing that ? ”
TLB	Genesis	21	30	And Abraham replied , “ They are my gift to you as a public confirmation that this well is mine. ”
TLB	Genesis	21	31	So from that time on the well was called Beer-sheba ( “ Well of the Oath ” ) , because that was the place where they made their covenant .
TLB	Genesis	21	32	Then King Abimelech and Phicol , commander of his army , returned home again .
TLB	Genesis	21	33	And Abraham planted a tamarisk tree beside the well and prayed there to the Lord , calling upon the Eternal God .
TLB	Genesis	21	34	And Abraham lived in the Philistine country for a long time . Footnotes - Genesis 21:9 teasing , or “ mocking , ” whether in innocent fun or otherwise is not clear in the text . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Genesis	22	22	Later on , God tested Abraham ’ s faith and obedience . [ a ] “ Abraham ! ” God called . “ Yes , Lord ? ” he replied .
TLB	Genesis	22	2	“ Take with you your only son—yes , Isaac whom you love so much—and go to the land of Moriah and sacrifice him there as a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I ’ ll point out to you ! ”
TLB	Genesis	22	3	The next morning Abraham got up early , chopped wood for a fire upon the altar , saddled his donkey , and took with him his son Isaac and two young men who were his servants , and started off to the place where God had told him to go .
TLB	Genesis	22	4	On the third day of the journey Abraham saw the place in the distance .
TLB	Genesis	22	5	“ Stay here with the donkey , ” Abraham told the young men , “ and the lad and I will travel yonder and worship , and then come right back. ”
TLB	Genesis	22	6	Abraham placed the wood for the burnt offering upon Isaac ’ s shoulders , while he himself carried the knife and the flint for striking a fire . So the two of them went on together .
TLB	Genesis	22	7	“ Father , ” Isaac asked , “ we have the wood and the flint to make the fire , but where is the lamb for the sacrifice ? ”
TLB	Genesis	22	8	“ God will see to it , my son , ” Abraham replied . And they went on .
TLB	Genesis	22	9	When they arrived at the place where God had told Abraham to go , he built an altar and placed the wood in order , ready for the fire , and then tied Isaac and laid him on the altar over the wood .
TLB	Genesis	22	10	And Abraham took the knife and lifted it up to plunge it into his son , to slay him .
TLB	Genesis	22	11	At that moment the Angel of God shouted to him from heaven , “ Abraham ! Abraham ! ” “ Yes , Lord ! ” he answered .
TLB	Genesis	22	12	“ Lay down the knife ; don ’ t hurt the lad in any way , ” the Angel said , “ for I know that God is first in your life—you have not withheld even your beloved son from me. ”
TLB	Genesis	22	13	Then Abraham noticed a ram caught by its horns in a bush . So he took the ram and sacrificed it , instead of his son , as a burnt offering on the altar .
TLB	Genesis	22	14	Abraham named the place “ Jehovah provides ” —and it still goes by that name to this day .
TLB	Genesis	22	15	Then the Angel of God called again to Abraham from heaven .
TLB	Genesis	22	16	“ I , the Lord , have sworn by myself that because you have obeyed me and have not withheld even your beloved son from me ,
TLB	Genesis	22	17	I will bless you with incredible blessings and multiply your descendants into countless thousands and millions , like the stars above you in the sky , and like the sands along the seashore . They will conquer their enemies ,
TLB	Genesis	22	18	and your offspring [ b ] will be a blessing to all the nations of the earth—all because you have obeyed me. ”
TLB	Genesis	22	19	So they returned to his young men and traveled home again to Beer-sheba . 20-23 After this , a message arrived that Milcah , the wife of Abraham ’ s brother Nahor , had borne him eight sons . Their names were : Uz , the oldest , Buz , the next oldest , Kemuel ( father of Aram ) , Chesed , Hazo , Pildash , Jidlaph , Bethuel ( father of Rebekah ) .
TLB	Genesis	22	24	He also had four other children from his concubine , Reumah : Tebah , Gaham , Tahash , Maacah . Footnotes - Genesis 22:1 faith and obedience , implied . - Genesis 22:18 your offspring , or “ your seed. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Genesis	23	23	1-2 When Sarah was
TLB	Genesis	23	127	years old , she died in Hebron in the land of Canaan ; there Abraham mourned and wept for her .
TLB	Genesis	23	3	Then , standing beside her body , he said to the men of Heth :
TLB	Genesis	23	4	“ Here I am , a visitor in a foreign land , with no place to bury my wife . Please sell me a piece of ground for this purpose. ” 5-6 “ Certainly , ” the men replied , “ for you are an honored prince of God among us ; it will be a privilege to have you choose the finest of our sepulchres , so that you can bury her there. ”
TLB	Genesis	23	7	Then Abraham bowed low before them and said ,
TLB	Genesis	23	8	“ Since this is your feeling in the matter , be so kind as to ask Ephron , Zohar ’ s son ,
TLB	Genesis	23	9	to sell me the cave of Mach-pelah , down at the end of his field . I will of course pay the full price for it , whatever is publicly agreed upon , and it will become a permanent cemetery for my family. ”
TLB	Genesis	23	10	Ephron was sitting there among the others , and now he spoke up , answering Abraham as the others listened , speaking publicly before all the citizens of the town :
TLB	Genesis	23	11	“ Sir , ” he said to Abraham , “ please listen to me . I will give you the cave and the field without any charge . Here in the presence of my people , I give it to you free . Go and bury your dead. ”
TLB	Genesis	23	12	Abraham bowed again to the men of Heth ,
TLB	Genesis	23	13	and replied to Ephron , as all listened : “ No , let me buy it from you . Let me pay the full price of the field , and then I will bury my dead. ” 14-15 “ Well , the land is worth
TLB	Genesis	23	400	pieces of silver , ” Ephron said , “ but what is that between friends ? Go ahead and bury your dead. ”
TLB	Genesis	23	16	So Abraham paid Ephron the price he had suggested—400 pieces of silver , as publicly agreed . 17-18 This is the land he bought : Ephron ’ s field at Mach-pelah , near Mamre , and the cave at the end of the field , and all the trees in the field . They became his permanent possession , by agreement in the presence of the men of Heth at the city gate . 19-20 So Abraham buried Sarah there , in the field and cave deeded to him by the men of Heth as a burial plot .

TLB	Genesis	24	24	“ My father is Bethuel , ” she replied . “ My grandparents are Milcah and Nahor .
TLB	Genesis	24	2	One day Abraham said to his household administrator , who was his oldest servant ,
TLB	Genesis	24	3	“ Swear by Jehovah , the God of heaven and earth , that you will not let my son marry one of these local girls , these Canaanites .
TLB	Genesis	24	4	Go instead to my homeland , to my relatives , and find a wife for him there. ”
TLB	Genesis	24	5	“ But suppose I can ’ t find a girl who will come so far from home ? ” the servant asked . “ Then shall I take Isaac there , to live among your relatives ? ”
TLB	Genesis	24	6	“ No ! ” Abraham warned . “ Be careful that you don ’ t do that under any circumstance .
TLB	Genesis	24	7	For the Lord God of heaven told me to leave that land and my people , and promised to give me and my children this land . He will send his angel on ahead of you , and he will see to it that you find a girl from there to be my son ’ s wife .
TLB	Genesis	24	8	But if you don ’ t succeed , then you are free from this oath ; but under no circumstances are you to take my son there. ”
TLB	Genesis	24	9	So the servant vowed [ a ] to follow Abraham ’ s instructions .
TLB	Genesis	24	10	He took with him ten of Abraham ’ s camels loaded with samples of the best of everything his master owned and journeyed to Iraq , to Nahor ’ s village .
TLB	Genesis	24	11	There he made the camels kneel down outside the town , beside a spring . It was evening , and the women of the village were coming to draw water .
TLB	Genesis	24	12	“ O Jehovah , the God of my master , ” he prayed , “ show kindness to my master Abraham and help me to accomplish the purpose of my journey .
TLB	Genesis	24	13	See , here I am , standing beside this spring , and the girls of the village are coming out to draw water .
TLB	Genesis	24	14	This is my request : When I ask one of them for a drink and she says , ‘ Yes , certainly , and I will water your camels too ! ’ —let her be the one you have appointed as Isaac ’ s wife . That is how I will know. ” 15-16 As he was still speaking to the Lord about this , a beautiful young girl [ b ] named Rebekah arrived with a water jug on her shoulder and filled it at the spring . ( Her father was Bethuel the son of Nahor and his wife Milcah . )
TLB	Genesis	24	17	Running over to her , the servant asked her for a drink .
TLB	Genesis	24	18	“ Certainly , sir , ” she said , and quickly lowered the jug for him to drink .
TLB	Genesis	24	19	Then she said , “ I ’ ll draw water for your camels , too , until they have enough ! ”
TLB	Genesis	24	20	So she emptied the jug into the watering trough and ran down to the spring again and kept carrying water to the camels until they had enough .
TLB	Genesis	24	21	The servant said no more , but watched her carefully to see if she would finish the job , [ c ] so that he would know whether she was the one .
TLB	Genesis	24	22	Then at last , when the camels had finished drinking , he produced a quarter-ounce gold earring [ d ] and two five-ounce gold bracelets for her wrists .
TLB	Genesis	24	23	“ Whose daughter are you , miss ? ” he asked . “ Would your father have any room to put us up for the night ? ”
TLB	Genesis	24	25	Yes , we have plenty of straw and food for the camels , and a guest room. ”
TLB	Genesis	24	26	The man stood there a moment with head bowed , worshiping Jehovah .
TLB	Genesis	24	27	“ Thank you , Lord God of my master Abraham , ” he prayed ; “ thank you for being so kind and true to him , and for leading me straight to the family of my master ’ s relatives. ”
TLB	Genesis	24	28	The girl ran home to tell her folks , [ e ] 29-30 and when her brother Laban saw the ring , and the bracelets on his sister ’ s wrists , and heard her story , he rushed out to the spring where the man was still standing beside his camels , and said to him ,
TLB	Genesis	24	31	“ Come and stay with us , friend ; [ f ] why stand here outside the city when we have a room all ready for you , and a place prepared for the camels ! ”
TLB	Genesis	24	32	So the man went home with Laban , and Laban gave him straw to bed down the camels , and feed for them , and water for the camel drivers to wash their feet .
TLB	Genesis	24	33	Then supper was served . But the old man said , “ I don ’ t want to eat until I have told you why I am here. ” “ All right , ” Laban said , “ tell us your errand. ”
TLB	Genesis	24	34	“ I am Abraham ’ s servant , ” he explained .
TLB	Genesis	24	35	“ And Jehovah has overwhelmed my master with blessings so that he is a great man among the people of his land . God has given him flocks of sheep and herds of cattle , and a fortune in silver and gold , and many slaves and camels and donkeys .
TLB	Genesis	24	36	“ Now when Sarah , my master ’ s wife , was very old , she gave birth to my master ’ s son , and my master has given him everything he owns .
TLB	Genesis	24	37	And my master made me promise not to let Isaac marry one of the local girls , [ g ]
TLB	Genesis	24	38	but to come to his relatives here in this far-off land , to his brother ’ s family , [ h ] and to bring back a girl from here to marry his son .
TLB	Genesis	24	39	‘ But suppose I can ’ t find a girl who will come ? ’ I asked him .
TLB	Genesis	24	40	‘ She will , ’ he told me— ‘ for my Lord , in whose presence I have walked , will send his angel with you and make your mission successful . Yes , find a girl from among my relatives , from my brother ’ s family .
TLB	Genesis	24	41	You are under oath to go and ask . If they won ’ t send anyone , then you are freed from your promise. ’
TLB	Genesis	24	42	“ Well , this afternoon when I came to the spring I prayed this prayer : ‘ O Jehovah , the God of my master Abraham , if you are planning to make my mission a success , please guide me in this way :
TLB	Genesis	24	43	Here I am , standing beside this spring . I will say to some girl who comes out to draw water , “ Please give me a drink of water ! ”
TLB	Genesis	24	44	And she will reply , “ Certainly ! And I ’ ll water your camels too ! ” Let that girl be the one you have selected to be the wife of my master ’ s son. ’
TLB	Genesis	24	45	“ Well , while I was still speaking these words , Rebekah was coming along with her water jug upon her shoulder ; and she went down to the spring and drew water and filled the jug . I said to her , ‘ Please give me a drink. ’
TLB	Genesis	24	46	She quickly lifted the jug down from her shoulder so that I could drink , and told me , ‘ Certainly , sir , and I will water your camels too ! ’ So she did !
TLB	Genesis	24	47	Then I asked her , ‘ Whose family are you from ? ’ And she told me , ‘ Nahor ’ s . My father is Bethuel , the son of Nahor and his wife Milcah. ’ So I gave her the ring and the bracelets .
TLB	Genesis	24	48	Then I bowed my head and worshiped and blessed Jehovah , the God of my master Abraham , because he had led me along just the right path to find a girl from the family of my master ’ s brother . [ i ]
TLB	Genesis	24	49	So tell me , yes or no . Will you or won ’ t you be kind to my master and do what is right ? When you tell me , then I ’ ll know what my next step should be , whether to move this way or that. ”
TLB	Genesis	24	50	Then Laban and Bethuel replied , “ The Lord has obviously brought you here , so what can we say ?
TLB	Genesis	24	51	Take her and go ! Yes , let her be the wife of your master ’ s son , as Jehovah has directed. ”
TLB	Genesis	24	52	At this reply , Abraham ’ s servant fell to his knees before Jehovah .
TLB	Genesis	24	53	Then he brought out jewels set in solid gold and silver for Rebekah , and lovely clothing ; and he gave many valuable presents to her mother and brother .
TLB	Genesis	24	54	Then they had supper , and the servant and the men with him stayed there overnight . But early the next morning he said , “ Send me back to my master ! ”
TLB	Genesis	24	55	“ But we want Rebekah here at least another ten days or so ! ” her mother and brother exclaimed . “ Then she can go. ”
TLB	Genesis	24	56	But he pleaded , “ Don ’ t hinder my return ; the Lord has made my mission successful , and I want to report back to my master. ”
TLB	Genesis	24	57	“ Well , ” they said , “ we ’ ll call the girl and ask her what she thinks. ”
TLB	Genesis	24	58	So they called Rebekah . “ Are you willing to go with this man ? ” they asked her . And she replied , “ Yes , I will go. ”
TLB	Genesis	24	59	So they told her good-bye , sending along the woman who had been her childhood nurse ,
TLB	Genesis	24	60	and blessed her with this blessing as they parted : “ Our sister , May you become The mother of many millions ! May your descendants Overcome all your enemies. ”
TLB	Genesis	24	61	So Rebekah and her servant girls mounted the camels and went with him .
TLB	Genesis	24	62	Meanwhile , Isaac , whose home was in the Negeb , had returned to Beer-lahai-roi .
TLB	Genesis	24	63	One evening as he was taking a walk out in the fields , meditating , he looked up and saw the camels coming .
TLB	Genesis	24	64	Rebekah noticed him and quickly dismounted .
TLB	Genesis	24	65	“ Who is that man walking through the fields to meet us ? ” she asked the servant . And he replied , “ It is my master ’ s son ! ” [ j ] So she covered her face with her veil .
TLB	Genesis	24	66	Then the servant told Isaac the whole story .
TLB	Genesis	24	67	And Isaac brought Rebekah into his mother ’ s tent , and she became his wife . He loved her very much , and she was a special comfort to him after the loss of his mother .

TLB	Genesis	25	25	The first was born so covered with reddish hair that one would think he was wearing a fur coat ! So they called him “ Esau. ” [ d ]
TLB	Genesis	25	3	Jokshan ’ s two sons were Sheba and Dedan . Dedan ’ s sons were Asshurim , Letushim , and Leummim .
TLB	Genesis	25	4	Midian ’ s sons were Ephah , Epher , Hanoch , Abida , and Eldaah . [ a ]
TLB	Genesis	25	5	Abraham deeded everything he owned to Isaac ;
TLB	Genesis	25	6	however , he gave gifts to the sons of his concubines and sent them off into the east , away from Isaac . 7-8 Then Abraham died , at the ripe old age of
TLB	Genesis	25	175	, 9-10 and his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Mach-pelah near Mamre , in the field Abraham had purchased from Ephron the son of Zohar , the Hethite , where Sarah , Abraham ’ s wife , was buried .
TLB	Genesis	25	11	After Abraham ’ s death , God poured out rich blessings upon Isaac . ( Isaac had now moved south to Beer-lahai-roi in the Negeb . ) 12-15 Here is a list , in the order of their births , of the descendants of Ishmael , who was the son of Abraham and Hagar the Egyptian , Sarah ’ s slave girl : Nebaioth , Kedar , Adbeel , Mibsam , Mishma , Dumah , Massa , Hadad , Tema , Jetur , Naphish , Kedemah .
TLB	Genesis	25	16	These twelve sons of his became the founders of twelve tribes that bore their names .
TLB	Genesis	25	17	Ishmael finally died at the age of
TLB	Genesis	25	137	, and joined his ancestors . [ b ]
TLB	Genesis	25	18	These descendants of Ishmael were scattered across the country from Havilah to Shur ( which is a little way to the northeast of the Egyptian border in the direction of Assyria ) . And they were constantly at war with one another .
TLB	Genesis	25	19	This is the story of Isaac ’ s children :
TLB	Genesis	25	20	and
TLB	Genesis	25	21	Isaac pleaded with Jehovah to give Rebekah a child , for even after many years of marriage [ c ] she had no children . Then at last she became pregnant .
TLB	Genesis	25	22	And it seemed as though children were fighting each other inside her ! “ I can ’ t endure this , ” she exclaimed . So she asked the Lord about it .
TLB	Genesis	25	23	And he told her , “ The sons in your womb shall become two rival nations . One will be stronger than the other ; and the older shall be a servant of the younger ! ”
TLB	Genesis	25	24	And sure enough , she had twins .
TLB	Genesis	25	26	. - Genesis 25:25 Esau sounds a little like the Hebrew word for “ hair. ” - Genesis 25:34 indifferent to the loss of the rights he had thrown away , literally , “ thus did Esau consider his birthright to be of no value. ” The Living Bible copyright ©
TLB	Genesis	25	27	As the boys grew , Esau became a skillful hunter , while Jacob was a quiet sort who liked to stay at home .
TLB	Genesis	25	28	Isaac ’ s favorite was Esau , because of the venison he brought home , and Rebekah ’ s favorite was Jacob .
TLB	Genesis	25	29	One day Jacob was cooking stew when Esau arrived home exhausted from the hunt .
TLB	Genesis	25	30	Esau : “ Boy , am I starved ! Give me a bite of that red stuff there ! ” ( From this came his nickname “ Edom , ” which means “ Red Stuff. ” )
TLB	Genesis	25	31	Jacob : “ All right , trade me your birthright for it ! ”
TLB	Genesis	25	32	Esau : “ When a man is dying of starvation , what good is his birthright ? ”
TLB	Genesis	25	33	Jacob : “ Well then , vow to God that it is mine ! ” And Esau vowed , thereby selling all his eldest-son rights to his younger brother .
TLB	Genesis	25	34	Then Jacob gave Esau bread , peas , and stew ; so he ate and drank and went on about his business , indifferent to the loss of the rights he had thrown away .

TLB	Genesis	26	26	One day Isaac had visitors from Gerar . King Abimelech arrived with his advisor , Ahuzzath , and also Phicol , his army commander .
TLB	Genesis	26	2	Jehovah appeared to him there and told him , “ Don ’ t go to Egypt .
TLB	Genesis	26	3	Do as I say and stay here in this land . If you do , I will be with you and bless you , and I will give all this land to you and to your descendants , just as I promised Abraham your father .
TLB	Genesis	26	4	And I will cause your descendants to become as numerous as the stars ! And I will give them all of these lands ; and they shall be a blessing to all the nations of the earth .
TLB	Genesis	26	5	I will do this because Abraham obeyed my commandments and laws. ”
TLB	Genesis	26	6	So Isaac stayed in Gerar .
TLB	Genesis	26	7	And when the men there asked him about Rebekah , he said , “ She is my sister ! ” For he feared for his life if he told them she was his wife ; he was afraid they would kill him to get her , for she was very attractive .
TLB	Genesis	26	8	But sometime later , King Abimelech , king of the Philistines , looked out of a window and saw Isaac and Rebekah making love .
TLB	Genesis	26	9	Abimelech called for Isaac and exclaimed , “ She is your wife ! Why did you say she is your sister ? ” “ Because I was afraid I would be murdered , ” Isaac replied . “ I thought someone would kill me to get her from me. ”
TLB	Genesis	26	10	“ How could you treat us this way ? ” Abimelech exclaimed . “ Someone might carelessly have raped her , and we would be doomed. ”
TLB	Genesis	26	11	Then Abimelech made a public proclamation : “ Anyone harming this man or his wife shall die. ”
TLB	Genesis	26	12	That year Isaac ’ s crops were tremendous—100 times the grain he sowed . For Jehovah blessed him .
TLB	Genesis	26	13	He was soon a man of great wealth and became richer and richer .
TLB	Genesis	26	14	He had large flocks of sheep and goats , great herds of cattle , and many servants . And the Philistines became jealous of him .
TLB	Genesis	26	15	So they filled up his wells with earth—all those dug by the servants of his father Abraham .
TLB	Genesis	26	16	And King Abimelech asked Isaac to leave the country . “ Go somewhere else , ” he said , “ for you have become too rich and powerful for us. ”
TLB	Genesis	26	17	So Isaac moved to Gerar Valley and lived there instead .
TLB	Genesis	26	18	And Isaac redug the wells of his father Abraham , the ones the Philistines had filled after his father ’ s death , and gave them the same names they had had before , when his father had named them .
TLB	Genesis	26	19	His shepherds also dug a new well in Gerar Valley , and found a gushing underground spring .
TLB	Genesis	26	20	Then the local shepherds came and claimed it . “ This is our land and our well , ” they said , and argued over it with Isaac ’ s herdsmen . So he named the well , “ The Well of Argument ! ” [ a ]
TLB	Genesis	26	21	Isaac ’ s men then dug another well , but again there was a fight over it . So he called it , “ The Well of Anger. ” [ b ]
TLB	Genesis	26	22	Abandoning that one , he dug again , and the local residents finally left him alone . So he called it , “ The Well of Room Enough for Us at Last ! ” [ c ] “ For now at last , ” he said , “ the Lord has made room for us and we shall thrive. ”
TLB	Genesis	26	23	When he went to Beer-sheba ,
TLB	Genesis	26	24	Jehovah appeared to him on the night of his arrival . “ I am the God of Abraham your father , ” he said . “ Fear not , for I am with you and will bless you , and will give you so many descendants that they will become a great nation—because of my promise to Abraham , who obeyed me. ”
TLB	Genesis	26	25	Then Isaac built an altar and worshiped Jehovah ; and he settled there , and his servants dug a well .
TLB	Genesis	26	27	“ Why have you come ? ” Isaac asked them . “ This is obviously no friendly visit , since you kicked me out in a most uncivil way. ”
TLB	Genesis	26	28	“ Well , ” they said , “ we can plainly see that Jehovah is blessing you . We ’ ve decided to ask for a treaty between us .
TLB	Genesis	26	29	Promise that you will not harm us , just as we have not harmed you , and in fact , have done only good to you and have sent you away in peace ; we bless you in the name of the Lord. ”
TLB	Genesis	26	30	So Isaac prepared a great feast for them , and they ate and drank in preparation for the treaty ceremonies .
TLB	Genesis	26	31	In the morning , as soon as they were up , they each took solemn oaths to seal a nonaggression pact . Then Isaac sent them happily home again .
TLB	Genesis	26	32	That very same day Isaac ’ s servants came to tell him , “ We have found water ” —in the well they had been digging .
TLB	Genesis	26	33	So he named the well , “ The Well of the Oath , ” [ d ] and the city that grew up there was named “ Oath , ” and is called that to this day .
TLB	Genesis	26	34	Esau , at the age of forty , married a girl named Judith , daughter of Be-eri the Hethite ; and he also married Basemath , daughter of Elon the Hethite .
TLB	Genesis	26	35	But Isaac and Rebekah were bitter about his marrying them .

TLB	Genesis	27	27	One day , in Isaac ’ s old age when he was almost blind , he called for Esau his oldest son . Isaac : “ My son ? ” Esau : “ Yes , Father ? ” 2-4 Isaac : “ I am an old man now , and expect every day to be my last . Take your bow and arrows out into the fields and get me some venison , and prepare it just the way I like it—savory and good—and bring it here for me to eat , and I will give you the blessings that belong to you , my firstborn son , [ a ] before I die. ”
TLB	Genesis	27	5	But Rebekah overheard the conversation . So when Esau left for the field to hunt for the venison , 6-7 she called her son Jacob and told him what his father had said to his brother . 8-10 Rebekah : “ Now do exactly as I tell you . Go out to the flocks and bring me two young goats , and I ’ ll prepare your father ’ s favorite dish from them . Then take it to your father , and after he has enjoyed it he will bless you before his death , instead of Esau ! ” [ b ] 11-12 Jacob : “ But Mother ! He won ’ t be fooled that easily . [ c ] Think how hairy Esau is , and how smooth my skin is ! What if my father feels me ? He ’ ll think I ’ m making a fool of him and curse me instead of blessing me ! ”
TLB	Genesis	27	13	Rebekah : “ Let his curses be on me , dear son . Just do what I tell you . Go out and get the goats. ”
TLB	Genesis	27	14	So Jacob followed his mother ’ s instructions , bringing the dressed kids , which she prepared in his father ’ s favorite way .
TLB	Genesis	27	15	Then she took Esau ’ s best clothes—they were there in the house—and instructed Jacob to put them on .
TLB	Genesis	27	16	And she made him a pair of gloves from the hairy skin of the young goats , and fastened a strip of the hide around his neck ;
TLB	Genesis	27	17	then she gave him the meat , with its rich aroma , and some fresh-baked bread .
TLB	Genesis	27	18	Jacob carried the platter of food into the room where his father was lying . Jacob : “ Father ? ” Isaac : “ Yes ? Who is it , my son—Esau or Jacob ? ”
TLB	Genesis	27	19	Jacob : “ It ’ s Esau , your oldest son . I ’ ve done as you told me to . Here is the delicious venison you wanted . Sit up and eat it , so that you will bless me with all your heart ! ”
TLB	Genesis	27	20	Isaac : “ How were you able to find it so quickly , my son ? ” Jacob : “ Because Jehovah your God put it in my path ! ”
TLB	Genesis	27	21	Isaac : “ Come over here . I want to feel you and be sure it really is Esau ! ”
TLB	Genesis	27	22	( Jacob goes over to his father . He feels him ! ) Isaac : ( to himself ) “ The voice is Jacob ’ s , but the hands are Esau ’ s ! ”
TLB	Genesis	27	23	( The ruse convinces Isaac and he gives Jacob his blessings ) :
TLB	Genesis	27	24	Isaac : “ Are you really Esau ? ” Jacob : “ Yes , of course. ”
TLB	Genesis	27	25	Isaac : “ Then bring me the venison , and I will eat it and bless you with all my heart. ” ( Jacob takes it over to him and Isaac eats ; he also drinks the wine Jacob brings him . )
TLB	Genesis	27	26	Isaac : “ Come here and kiss me , my son ! ” ( Jacob goes over and kisses him on the cheek . Isaac sniffs his clothes , and finally seems convinced . ) 27-29 Isaac : “ The smell of my son is the good smell of the earth and fields that Jehovah has blessed . May God always give you plenty of rain for your crops , and good harvests and grapes . May many nations be your slaves . Be the master of your brothers . May all your relatives bow low before you . Cursed are all who curse you , and blessed are all who bless you. ”
TLB	Genesis	27	30	( As soon as Isaac has blessed Jacob , and almost before Jacob leaves the room , Esau arrives , coming in from his hunting .
TLB	Genesis	27	31	He also has prepared his father ’ s favorite dish and brings it to him . ) Esau : “ Here I am , Father , with the venison . Sit up and eat it so that you can give me your finest blessings ! ”
TLB	Genesis	27	32	Isaac : “ Who is it ? ” Esau : “ Why , it ’ s me , of course ! Esau , your oldest son ! ”
TLB	Genesis	27	33	( Isaac begins to tremble noticeably . ) Isaac : “ Then who is it who was just here with venison , and I have already eaten it and blessed him with irrevocable blessing ? ”
TLB	Genesis	27	34	( Esau begins to sob with deep and bitter sobs . ) Esau : “ O my Father , bless me , bless me too ! ”
TLB	Genesis	27	35	Isaac : “ Your brother was here and tricked me and has carried away your blessing. ”
TLB	Genesis	27	36	Esau : ( bitterly ) “ No wonder they call him ‘ The Cheater. ’ [ d ] For he took my birthright , and now he has stolen my blessing . Oh , haven ’ t you saved even one blessing for me ? ”
TLB	Genesis	27	37	Isaac : “ I have made him your master , and have given him yourself and all of his relatives as his servants . I have guaranteed him abundance of grain and wine—what is there left to give ? ”
TLB	Genesis	27	38	Esau : “ Not one blessing left for me ? O my Father , bless me too. ” ( Isaac says nothing [ e ] as Esau weeps . ) 39-40 Isaac : “ Yours will be no life of ease and luxury , but you shall hew your way with your sword . For a time you will serve your brother , but you will finally shake loose from him and be free. ”
TLB	Genesis	27	41	So Esau hated Jacob because of what he had done to him . He said to himself , “ My father will soon be gone , and then I will kill Jacob. ”
TLB	Genesis	27	42	But someone got wind of what he was planning and reported it to Rebekah . She sent for Jacob and told him that his life was being threatened by Esau .
TLB	Genesis	27	43	“ This is what to do , ” she said . “ Flee to your Uncle Laban in Haran .
TLB	Genesis	27	44	Stay there with him awhile until your brother ’ s fury is spent ,
TLB	Genesis	27	45	and he forgets what you have done . Then I will send for you . For why should I be bereaved of both of you in one day ? ”
TLB	Genesis	27	46	Then Rebekah said to Isaac , “ I ’ m sick and tired of these local girls . I ’ d rather die than see Jacob marry one of them. ” Footnotes - Genesis 27:2 that belong to you , my firstborn son , implied . - Genesis 27:8 instead of Esau , implied . - Genesis 27:11 He won ’ t be fooled that easily , implied . - Genesis 27:36 The Cheater .

TLB	Genesis	28	28	So Isaac called for Jacob and blessed him and said to him , “ Don ’ t marry one of these Canaanite girls .
TLB	Genesis	28	2	Instead , go at once to Paddan-aram , to the house of your grandfather [ a ] Bethuel , and marry one of your cousins—your Uncle Laban ’ s daughters .
TLB	Genesis	28	3	God Almighty bless you and give you many children ; may you become a great nation of many tribes !
TLB	Genesis	28	4	May God pass on to you and to your descendants the mighty blessings promised to Abraham . May you own this land where we now are foreigners , for God has given it to Abraham. ”
TLB	Genesis	28	5	So Isaac sent Jacob away , and he went to Paddan-aram to visit his Uncle Laban , his mother ’ s brother—the son of Bethuel the Aramean . 6-8 Esau realized that his father despised the local girls , and that his father and mother had sent Jacob to Paddan-aram , with his father ’ s blessing , to get a wife from there , and that they had strictly warned him against marrying a Canaanite girl , and that Jacob had agreed and had left for Paddan-aram .
TLB	Genesis	28	9	So Esau went to his Uncle Ishmael ’ s family and married another wife from there , besides the wives he already had . Her name was Mahalath , the sister of Nebaioth , and daughter of Ishmael , Abraham ’ s son .
TLB	Genesis	28	10	So Jacob left Beer-sheba and journeyed toward Haran .
TLB	Genesis	28	11	That night , when he stopped to camp at sundown , he found a rock for a headrest and lay down to sleep ,
TLB	Genesis	28	12	and dreamed that a staircase [ b ] reached from earth to heaven , and he saw the angels of God going up and down upon it .
TLB	Genesis	28	13	At the top of the stairs stood the Lord . “ I am Jehovah , ” he said , “ the God of Abraham , and of your father , Isaac . The ground you are lying on is yours ! I will give it to you and to your descendants .
TLB	Genesis	28	14	For you will have descendants as many as dust ! They will cover the land from east to west and from north to south ; and all the nations of the earth will be blessed through you and your descendants .

This is the awesome entrance to heaven ! ”
TLB	Genesis	28	18	The next morning he got up very early and set his stone headrest upright as a memorial pillar , and poured olive oil over it .
TLB	Genesis	28	19	He named the place Bethel ( “ House of God ” ) , though the previous name of the nearest village [ c ] was Luz .
TLB	Genesis	28	20	And Jacob vowed this vow to God : “ If God will help and protect me on this journey and give me food and clothes ,
TLB	Genesis	28	21	and will bring me back safely to my father , then I will choose Jehovah as my God !
TLB	Genesis	28	22	And this memorial pillar shall become a place for worship ; and I will give you back a tenth of everything you give me ! ” Footnotes - Genesis 28:2 your grandfather , literally , “ your mother ’ s father. ” your Uncle , literally , “ your mother ’ s brother. ” - Genesis 28:12 a staircase , literally , “ a ladder. ” - Genesis 28:19 of the nearest village , literally , “ of the city. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Genesis	29	29	And Laban gave to Rachel a servant girl , Bilhah , to be her maid .
TLB	Genesis	29	2	He saw in the distance three flocks of sheep lying beside a well in an open field , waiting to be watered . But a heavy stone covered the mouth of the well .
TLB	Genesis	29	3	( The custom was that the stone was not removed until all the flocks were there . After watering them , the stone was rolled back over the mouth of the well again . )
TLB	Genesis	29	4	Jacob went over to the shepherds and asked them where they lived . “ At Haran , ” they said .
TLB	Genesis	29	5	“ Do you know a fellow there named Laban , the son of Nahor ? ” “ We sure do. ”
TLB	Genesis	29	6	“ How is he ? ” “ He ’ s well and prosperous . Look , there comes his daughter Rachel with the sheep. ”
TLB	Genesis	29	7	“ Why don ’ t you water the flocks so they can get back to grazing ? ” Jacob asked . “ They ’ ll be hungry if you stop so early in the day ! ”
TLB	Genesis	29	8	“ We don ’ t roll away the stone and begin the watering until all the flocks and shepherds are here , ” they replied .
TLB	Genesis	29	9	As this conversation was going on , Rachel arrived with her father ’ s sheep , for she was a shepherdess .
TLB	Genesis	29	10	And because she was his cousin—the daughter of his mother ’ s brother—and because the sheep were his uncle ’ s , Jacob went over to the well and rolled away the stone and watered his uncle ’ s flock .
TLB	Genesis	29	11	Then Jacob kissed Rachel and started crying ! 12-13 He explained about being her cousin on her father ’ s side , and that he was her Aunt Rebekah ’ s son . She quickly ran and told her father , Laban , and as soon as he heard of Jacob ’ s arrival , he rushed out to meet him and greeted him warmly and brought him home . Then Jacob told him his story .
TLB	Genesis	29	14	“ Just think , my very own flesh and blood , ” Laban exclaimed . After Jacob had been there about a month ,
TLB	Genesis	29	15	Laban said to him one day , “ Just because we are relatives is no reason for you to work for me without pay . How much do you want ? ”
TLB	Genesis	29	16	Now Laban had two daughters , Leah , the older , and her younger sister , Rachel .
TLB	Genesis	29	17	Leah had lovely eyes , but Rachel was shapely , and in every way a beauty .
TLB	Genesis	29	18	Well , Jacob was in love with Rachel . So he told her father , “ I ’ ll work for you seven years if you ’ ll give me Rachel as my wife. ”
TLB	Genesis	29	19	“ Agreed ! ” Laban replied . “ I ’ d rather give her to you than to someone outside the family. ”
TLB	Genesis	29	20	So Jacob spent the next seven years working to pay for Rachel . But they seemed to him but a few days , he was so much in love .
TLB	Genesis	29	21	Finally the time came for him to marry her . “ I have fulfilled my contract , ” Jacob said to Laban . “ Now give me my wife , so that I can sleep with her. ”
TLB	Genesis	29	22	So Laban invited all the men of the settlement to celebrate with Jacob at a big party .
TLB	Genesis	29	23	Afterwards , that night , when it was dark , Laban took Leah to Jacob , and he slept with her .
TLB	Genesis	29	24	( And Laban gave to Leah a servant girl , Zilpah , to be her maid . )
TLB	Genesis	29	25	But in the morning—it was Leah ! “ What sort of trick is this ? ” Jacob raged at Laban . “ I worked for seven years for Rachel . What do you mean by this trickery ? ”
TLB	Genesis	29	26	“ It ’ s not our custom to marry off a younger daughter ahead of her sister , ” Laban replied smoothly . [ a ]
TLB	Genesis	29	27	“ Wait until the bridal week is over and you can have Rachel too—if you promise to work for me another seven years ! ”
TLB	Genesis	29	28	So Jacob agreed to work seven more years . Then Laban gave him Rachel , too .
TLB	Genesis	29	30	So Jacob slept with Rachel , too , and he loved her more than Leah , and stayed and worked the additional seven years .
TLB	Genesis	29	31	But because Jacob was slighting Leah , Jehovah let her have a child , while Rachel was barren .
TLB	Genesis	29	32	So Leah became pregnant and had a son , Reuben ( meaning “ God has noticed my trouble ” ) , for she said , “ Jehovah has noticed my trouble—now my husband will love me. ”
TLB	Genesis	29	33	She soon became pregnant again and had another son and named him Simeon ( meaning “ Jehovah heard ” ) , for she said , “ Jehovah heard that I was unloved , and so he has given me another son. ”
TLB	Genesis	29	34	Again she became pregnant and had a son , and named him Levi ( meaning “ Attachment ” ) for she said , “ Surely now my husband will feel affection for me , since I have given him three sons ! ”
TLB	Genesis	29	35	Once again she was pregnant and had a son and named him Judah ( meaning “ Praise ” ) , for she said , “ Now I will praise Jehovah ! ” And then she stopped having children . Footnotes - Genesis 29:26 Laban replied smoothly , implied from context . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Genesis	30	30	For it was little indeed you had before I came , and your wealth has increased enormously ; Jehovah has blessed you from everything I do ! But now , what about me ? When should I provide for my own family ? ” 31-32 “ What wages do you want ? ” Laban asked again . Jacob replied , “ If you will do one thing , I ’ ll go back to work for you . Let me go out among your flocks today and remove all the goats that are speckled or spotted , and all the black sheep . Give them to me as my wages .
TLB	Genesis	30	2	Jacob flew into a rage . “ Am I God ? ” he flared . “ He is the one who is responsible for your barrenness. ”
TLB	Genesis	30	3	Then Rachel told him , “ Sleep with my servant girl Bilhah , and her children will be mine. ”
TLB	Genesis	30	4	So she gave him Bilhah to be his wife , and he slept with her ,
TLB	Genesis	30	5	and she became pregnant and presented him with a son .
TLB	Genesis	30	6	Rachel named him Dan ( meaning “ Justice ” ) , [ a ] for she said , “ God has given me justice , and heard my plea and given me a son. ”
TLB	Genesis	30	7	Then Bilhah , Rachel ’ s servant girl , became pregnant again and gave Jacob a second son .
TLB	Genesis	30	8	Rachel named him Naphtali ( meaning “ Wrestling ” ) , for she said , “ I am in a fierce contest with my sister and I am winning ! ”
TLB	Genesis	30	9	Meanwhile , when Leah realized that she wasn ’ t getting pregnant anymore , she gave her servant girl Zilpah to Jacob , to be his wife ,
TLB	Genesis	30	10	and soon Zilpah presented him with a son .
TLB	Genesis	30	11	Leah named him Gad ( meaning “ My luck has turned ! ” ) .
TLB	Genesis	30	12	Then Zilpah produced a second son ,
TLB	Genesis	30	13	and Leah named him Asher ( meaning “ Happy ” ) , for she said , “ What joy is mine ! The other women will think me blessed indeed ! ”
TLB	Genesis	30	14	One day during the wheat harvest , Reuben found some mandrakes [ b ] growing in a field and brought them to his mother Leah . Rachel begged Leah to give some of them to her .
TLB	Genesis	30	15	But Leah angrily replied , “ Wasn ’ t it enough to steal my husband ? And now will you steal my son ’ s mandrakes too ? ” Rachel said sadly , “ He will sleep with you tonight because of the mandrakes. ”
TLB	Genesis	30	16	That evening as Jacob was coming home from the fields , Leah went out to meet him . “ You must sleep with me tonight ! ” she said ; “ for I am hiring you with some mandrakes my son has found ! ” So he did .
TLB	Genesis	30	17	And God answered her prayers and she became pregnant again , and gave birth to her fifth son .
TLB	Genesis	30	18	She named him Issachar ( meaning “ Wages ” ) , for she said , “ God has repaid me for giving my slave girl to my husband. ”
TLB	Genesis	30	19	Then once again she became pregnant , with a sixth son .
TLB	Genesis	30	20	She named him Zebulun ( meaning “ Gifts ” ) , for she said , “ God has given me good gifts for my husband . Now he will honor me , for I have given him six sons. ”
TLB	Genesis	30	21	Afterwards she gave birth to a daughter and named her Dinah .
TLB	Genesis	30	22	Then God remembered about Rachel ’ s plight , and answered her prayers by giving her a child . 23-24 For she became pregnant and gave birth to a son . “ God has removed the dark slur against my name , ” she said . And she named him Joseph ( meaning “ May I also have another ! ” ) , for she said , “ May Jehovah give me another son. ”
TLB	Genesis	30	25	Soon after the birth of Joseph to Rachel , Jacob said to Laban , “ I want to go back home .
TLB	Genesis	30	26	Let me take my wives and children—for I earned them from you—and be gone , for you know how fully I have paid for them with my service to you. ”
TLB	Genesis	30	27	“ Please don ’ t leave me , ” Laban replied , “ for a fortune-teller that I consulted [ c ] told me that the many blessings I ’ ve been enjoying are all because of your being here .
TLB	Genesis	30	28	How much of a raise do you need to get you to stay ? Whatever it is , I ’ ll pay it. ”
TLB	Genesis	30	29	Jacob replied , “ You know how faithfully I ’ ve served you through these many years , and how your flocks and herds have grown .
TLB	Genesis	30	33	Then if you ever find any white goats or sheep in my flock , you will know that I have stolen them from you ! ”
TLB	Genesis	30	34	“ All right ! ” Laban replied . “ It shall be as you have said ! ” 35-36 So that very day Laban went out and formed a flock for Jacob of all the male goats that were ringed and spotted , and the females that were speckled and spotted with any white patches , and all of the black sheep . He gave them to Jacob ’ s sons to take them three days ’ distance , and Jacob stayed and cared for Laban ’ s flock .
TLB	Genesis	30	37	Then Jacob took fresh shoots from poplar , almond , and sycamore trees , and peeled white streaks in them ,
TLB	Genesis	30	38	and placed these rods beside the watering troughs so that Laban ’ s flocks would see them when they came to drink ; for that is when they mated . 39-40 So the flocks mated before the white-streaked rods , and their offspring were streaked and spotted , and Jacob added them to his flock . Then he divided out the ewes from Laban ’ s flock and segregated them from the rams , and let them mate only with Jacob ’ s black rams . Thus he built his flocks from Laban ’ s .
TLB	Genesis	30	41	Moreover , he watched for the stronger animals to mate , and placed the peeled branches before them ,
TLB	Genesis	30	42	but didn ’ t with the feebler ones . So the less healthy lambs were Laban ’ s and the stronger ones were Jacob ’ s !
TLB	Genesis	30	43	As a result , Jacob ’ s flocks increased rapidly and he became very wealthy , with many servants , camels , and donkeys . Footnotes - Genesis 30:6 Dan ( meaning “ Justice ” ) . The meaning is not of the actual Hebrew name , but of a Hebrew word sounding like the name . The name given is a Hebrew pun . An example in English might be , “ Because of the large hospital bill the child was named ‘ Bill. ’ ” - Genesis 30:14 mandrakes , a leafy plant eaten by peasant women who supposed this would aid them in becoming pregnant . - Genesis 30:27 a fortune-teller that I consulted , literally , “ I have learned by divination. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Genesis	31	31	“ I sneaked away because I was afraid , ” Jacob answered . “ I said to myself , ‘ He ’ ll take his daughters from me by force. ’
TLB	Genesis	31	2	Soon Jacob noticed a considerable cooling in Laban ’ s attitude toward him .
TLB	Genesis	31	3	Jehovah now spoke to Jacob and told him , “ Return to the land of your fathers , and to your relatives there ; and I will be with you. ”
TLB	Genesis	31	4	So one day Jacob sent for Rachel and Leah to come out to the field where he was with the flocks ,
TLB	Genesis	31	5	to talk things over with them . “ Your father has turned against me , ” he told them , “ and now the God of my fathers has come and spoken to me .
TLB	Genesis	31	6	You know how hard I ’ ve worked for your father ,
TLB	Genesis	31	7	but he has been completely unscrupulous and has broken his wage contract with me again and again and again . But God has not permitted him to do me any harm !
TLB	Genesis	31	8	For if he said the speckled animals would be mine , then all the flock produced speckled ; and when he changed and said I could have the streaked ones , then all the lambs were streaked !
TLB	Genesis	31	9	In this way God has made me wealthy at your father ’ s expense .
TLB	Genesis	31	10	“ And at the mating season , I had a dream , and saw that the he-goats mating with the flock were streaked , speckled , and mottled .
TLB	Genesis	31	11	Then , in my dream , the Angel of God called to me
TLB	Genesis	31	12	and told me that I should mate the white female goats with streaked , speckled , and mottled male goats . [ a ] ‘ For I have seen all that Laban has done to you , ’ the Angel said .
TLB	Genesis	31	13	‘ I am the God you met at Bethel , ’ he continued , ‘ the place where you anointed the pillar and made a vow to serve me . Now leave this country and return to the land of your birth. ’ ”
TLB	Genesis	31	14	Rachel and Leah replied , “ That ’ s fine with us ! There ’ s nothing for us here—none of our father ’ s wealth will come to us anyway !
TLB	Genesis	31	15	. - Genesis 31:39 stolen . . . whether I could help it or not , literally , “ stolen by day or by night. ” - Genesis 31:47 if either of us trespasses across this line , implied . The Living Bible copyright ©
TLB	Genesis	31	16	The riches God has given you from our father were legally ours and our children ’ s to begin with ! So go ahead and do whatever God has told you to. ” 17-20 So one day while Laban was out shearing sheep , Jacob set his wives and sons on camels , and fled without telling Laban his intentions . He drove the flocks before him—Jacob ’ s flocks he had gotten there at Paddan-aram—and took everything he owned and started out to return to his father Isaac in the land of Canaan .
TLB	Genesis	31	21	So he fled with all of his possessions ( and Rachel stole her father ’ s household gods and took them with her ) and crossed the Euphrates River and headed for the territory of Gilead .
TLB	Genesis	31	22	Laban didn ’ t learn of their flight for three days .
TLB	Genesis	31	23	Then , taking several men with him , he set out in hot pursuit and caught up with them seven days later , at Mount Gilead .
TLB	Genesis	31	24	That night God appeared to Laban in a dream . “ Watch out what you say to Jacob , ” he was told . “ Don ’ t give him your blessing and don ’ t curse him. ”
TLB	Genesis	31	25	Laban finally caught up with Jacob as he was camped at the top of a ridge ; Laban , meanwhile , camped below him in the mountains .
TLB	Genesis	31	26	“ What do you mean by sneaking off like this ? ” Laban demanded . “ Are my daughters prisoners , captured in a battle , that you have rushed them away like this ?
TLB	Genesis	31	27	Why didn ’ t you give me a chance to have a farewell party , with singing and orchestra and harp ?
TLB	Genesis	31	28	Why didn ’ t you let me kiss my grandchildren and tell them good-bye ? This is a strange way to act .
TLB	Genesis	31	29	I could crush you , but the God of your father appeared to me last night and told me , ‘ Be careful not to be too hard on Jacob ! ’
TLB	Genesis	31	30	But see here—though you feel you must go , and long so intensely for your childhood home—why have you stolen my idols ? ”
TLB	Genesis	31	32	But as for your household idols , a curse upon anyone who took them . Let him die ! If you find a single thing we ’ ve stolen from you , I swear before all these men , I ’ ll give it back without question. ” For Jacob didn ’ t know that Rachel had taken them .
TLB	Genesis	31	33	Laban went first into Jacob ’ s tent to search there , then into Leah ’ s , and then searched the two tents of the concubines , but didn ’ t find them . Finally he went into Rachel ’ s tent .
TLB	Genesis	31	34	Rachel , remember , was the one who had stolen the idols ; she had stuffed them into her camel saddle and now was sitting on them ! So although Laban searched the tents thoroughly , he didn ’ t find them .
TLB	Genesis	31	35	“ Forgive my not getting up , Father , ” Rachel explained , “ but I ’ m having my monthly period. ” [ b ] So Laban didn ’ t find them . 36-37 Now Jacob got mad . “ What did you find ? ” he demanded of Laban . “ What is my crime ? You have come rushing after me as though you were chasing a criminal and have searched through everything . Now put everything I stole out here in front of us , before your men and mine , for all to see and to decide whose it is !
TLB	Genesis	31	38	Twenty years I ’ ve been with you , and all that time I cared for your ewes and goats so that they produced healthy offspring , and I never touched one ram of yours for food .
TLB	Genesis	31	39	If any were attacked and killed by wild animals , did I show them to you and ask you to reduce the count of your flock ? No , I took the loss . You made me pay for every animal stolen from the flocks , whether I could help it or not . [ c ]
TLB	Genesis	31	40	I worked for you through the scorching heat of the day , and through the cold and sleepless nights .
TLB	Genesis	31	41	Yes , twenty years—fourteen of them earning your two daughters , and six years to get the flock ! And you have reduced my wages ten times !
TLB	Genesis	31	42	In fact , except for the grace of God—the God of my grandfather Abraham , even the glorious God of Isaac , my father—you would have sent me off without a penny to my name . But God has seen your cruelty and my hard work , and that is why he appeared to you last night. ”
TLB	Genesis	31	43	Laban replied , “ These women are my daughters , and these children are mine , and these flocks and all that you have—all are mine . So how could I harm my own daughters and grandchildren ?
TLB	Genesis	31	44	Come now and we will sign a peace pact , you and I , and will live by its terms. ”
TLB	Genesis	31	45	So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a monument ,
TLB	Genesis	31	46	and told his men to gather stones and make a heap , and Jacob and Laban ate together beside the pile of rocks . 47-48 They named it “ The Witness Pile ” — “ Jegar-sahadutha , ” in Laban ’ s language , and “ Galeed ” in Jacob ’ s . “ This pile of stones will stand as a witness against us if either of us trespasses across this line , [ d ] ” Laban said .
TLB	Genesis	31	49	So it was also called “ The Watchtower ” ( Mizpah ) . For Laban said , “ May the Lord see to it that we keep this bargain when we are out of each other ’ s sight .
TLB	Genesis	31	50	And if you are harsh to my daughters , or take other wives , I won ’ t know , but God will see it . 51-52 This heap , ” Laban continued , “ stands between us as a witness of our vows that I will not cross this line to attack you and you will not cross it to attack me .
TLB	Genesis	31	53	I call upon the God of Abraham and Nahor , and of their father , to destroy either one of us who does. ” So Jacob took oath before the mighty God of his father , Isaac , to respect the boundary line .
TLB	Genesis	31	54	Then Jacob presented a sacrifice to God there at the top of the mountain , and invited his companions to a feast , and afterwards spent the night with them on the mountain .
TLB	Genesis	31	55	Laban was up early the next morning and kissed his daughters and grandchildren , and blessed them , and returned home .

TLB	Genesis	32	3	Jacob now sent messengers to his brother , Esau , in Edom , in the land of Seir ,
TLB	Genesis	32	4	with this message : “ Hello from Jacob ! I have been living with Uncle Laban until recently ,
TLB	Genesis	32	5	and now I own oxen , donkeys , sheep , goats , and many servants , both men and women . I have sent these messengers to inform you of my coming , hoping that you will be friendly to us. ”
TLB	Genesis	32	6	The messengers returned with the news that Esau was on the way to meet Jacob—with an army of
TLB	Genesis	32	400	men !
TLB	Genesis	32	7	Jacob was frantic with fear . He divided his household , along with the flocks and herds and camels , into two groups ;
TLB	Genesis	32	8	for he said , “ If Esau attacks one group , perhaps the other can escape. ”
TLB	Genesis	32	9	Then Jacob prayed , “ O God of Abraham my grandfather , and of my father Isaac—O Jehovah who told me to return to the land of my relatives , and said that you would do me good—
TLB	Genesis	32	10	male donkeys .
TLB	Genesis	32	11	O Lord , please deliver me from destruction at the hand of my brother Esau , for I am frightened—terribly afraid that he is coming to kill me and these mothers and my children .
TLB	Genesis	32	12	But you promised to do me good , and to multiply my descendants until they become as the sands along the shores—too many to count. ” 13-15 Jacob stayed where he was for the night , and prepared a present for his brother Esau :
TLB	Genesis	32	200	ewes ,
TLB	Genesis	32	20	Jacob ’ s strategy was to appease Esau with the presents before meeting him face-to-face ! “ Perhaps , ” Jacob hoped , “ he will be friendly to us. ”
TLB	Genesis	32	30	Jacob named the place “ Peniel ” ( “ The Face of God ” ) , for he said , “ I have seen God face to face , and yet my life is spared. ”
TLB	Genesis	32	40	cows ,
TLB	Genesis	32	16	He instructed his servants to drive them on ahead , each group of animals by itself , separated by a distance between .
TLB	Genesis	32	17	He told the men driving the first group that when they met Esau and he asked , “ Where are you going ? Whose servants are you ? Whose animals are these ? ” —
TLB	Genesis	32	18	they should reply : “ These belong to your servant Jacob . They are a present for his master Esau ! He is coming right behind us ! ”
TLB	Genesis	32	19	Jacob gave the same instructions to each driver , with the same message .
TLB	Genesis	32	21	So the presents were sent on ahead , and Jacob spent that night in the camp . 22-24 But during the night he got up and wakened [ c ] his two wives and his two concubines and eleven sons , and sent them across the Jordan River at the Jabbok ford with all his possessions , then returned again to the camp and was there alone ; and a Man wrestled with him until dawn .
TLB	Genesis	32	25	And when the Man saw that he couldn ’ t win the match , he struck Jacob ’ s hip and knocked it out of joint at the socket .
TLB	Genesis	32	26	Then the Man said , “ Let me go , for it is dawn. ” But Jacob panted , “ I will not let you go until you bless me. ”
TLB	Genesis	32	27	“ What is your name ? ” the Man asked . “ Jacob , ” was the reply .
TLB	Genesis	32	28	“ It isn ’ t anymore ! ” the Man told him . “ It is Israel—one who has power with God . Because you have been strong with God , you shall prevail with men. ”
TLB	Genesis	32	29	“ What is your name ? ” Jacob asked him . “ No , you mustn ’ t ask , ” the Man told him . And he blessed him there .
TLB	Genesis	32	31	The sun rose as he started on , and he was limping because of his hip .

TLB	Genesis	33	33	Then , far in the distance , Jacob saw Esau coming with his
TLB	Genesis	33	400	men .
TLB	Genesis	33	2	Jacob now arranged his family into a column , with his two concubines and their children at the head , Leah and her children next , and Rachel and Joseph last .
TLB	Genesis	33	3	Then Jacob went on ahead . As he approached his brother he bowed low seven times before him .
TLB	Genesis	33	4	And then Esau ran to meet him and embraced him affectionately and kissed him ; and both of them were in tears !
TLB	Genesis	33	5	Then Esau looked at the women and children and asked , “ Who are these people with you ? ” “ My children , ” Jacob replied .
TLB	Genesis	33	6	Then the concubines came forward with their children , and bowed low before him .
TLB	Genesis	33	7	Next came Leah with her children , and bowed , and finally Rachel and Joseph came and made their bows .
TLB	Genesis	33	8	“ And what were all the flocks and herds I met as I came ? ” Esau asked . And Jacob replied , “ They are my gifts , to curry your favor ! ”
TLB	Genesis	33	9	“ Brother , I have plenty , ” Esau laughed . “ Keep what you have. ”
TLB	Genesis	33	10	“ No , but please accept them , ” Jacob said , “ for what a relief it is to see your friendly smile ! I was as frightened of you as though approaching God ! [ a ]
TLB	Genesis	33	11	Please take my gifts . For God has been very generous to me and I have enough. ” So Jacob insisted , and finally Esau accepted them .
TLB	Genesis	33	12	“ Well , let ’ s be going , ” Esau said . “ My men and I will stay with you and lead the way. ”
TLB	Genesis	33	13	But Jacob replied , “ As you can see , [ b ] some of the children are small , and the flocks and herds have their young , and if they are driven too hard , they will die .
TLB	Genesis	33	14	So you go on ahead of us and we ’ ll follow at our own pace and meet you at Seir. ”
TLB	Genesis	33	15	“ Well , ” Esau said , “ at least let me leave you some of my men to assist you and be your guides. ” “ No , ” Jacob insisted , “ we ’ ll get along just fine . Please do as I suggest. ”
TLB	Genesis	33	16	So Esau started back to Seir that same day .
TLB	Genesis	33	17	Meanwhile Jacob and his household went as far as Succoth . There he built himself a camp , with pens for his flocks and herds . ( That is why the place is called Succoth , meaning “ huts. ” )
TLB	Genesis	33	18	Then they arrived safely at Shechem , in Canaan , and camped outside the city .

TLB	Genesis	34	34	One day Dinah , Leah ’ s daughter , went out to visit some of the neighborhood girls ,
TLB	Genesis	34	2	but when Shechem , son of King Hamor the Hivite , saw her , he took her and raped her .
TLB	Genesis	34	3	He fell deeply in love with her , and tried to win her affection .
TLB	Genesis	34	4	Then he spoke to his father about it . “ Get this girl for me , ” he demanded . “ I want to marry her. ”
TLB	Genesis	34	5	Word soon reached Jacob of what had happened , but his sons were out in the fields herding cattle , so he did nothing until their return . 6-7 Meanwhile King Hamor , Shechem ’ s father , went to talk with Jacob , arriving just as Jacob ’ s sons came in from the fields , too shocked and angry to overlook the insult , for it was an outrage against all of them .
TLB	Genesis	34	8	Hamor told Jacob , “ My son Shechem is truly in love with your daughter , and longs for her to be his wife . Please let him marry her . 9-10 Moreover , we invite you folks to live here among us and to let your daughters marry our sons , and we will give our daughters as wives for your young men . And you shall live among us wherever you wish and carry on your business among us and become rich ! ”
TLB	Genesis	34	11	Then Shechem addressed Dinah ’ s father and brothers . “ Please be kind to me and let me have her as my wife , ” he begged . “ I will give whatever you require .
TLB	Genesis	34	12	No matter what dowry or gift you demand , I will pay it—only give me the girl as my wife. ”
TLB	Genesis	34	13	Her brothers then lied to Shechem and Hamor , acting dishonorably because of what Shechem had done to their sister .
TLB	Genesis	34	14	They said , “ We couldn ’ t possibly . For you are not circumcised . It would be a disgrace for her to marry such a man .
TLB	Genesis	34	15	I ’ ll tell you what we ’ ll do—if every man of you will be circumcised ,
TLB	Genesis	34	16	then we will intermarry with you and live here and unite with you to become one people .
TLB	Genesis	34	17	Otherwise we will take her and be on our way. ” 18-19 Hamor and Shechem gladly agreed , and lost no time in acting upon this request , for Shechem was very much in love with Dinah , and could , he felt sure , sell the idea to the other men of the city—for he was highly respected and very popular .
TLB	Genesis	34	20	So Hamor and Shechem appeared before the city council [ a ] and presented their request .
TLB	Genesis	34	21	“ Those men are our friends , ” they said . “ Let ’ s invite them to live here among us and ply their trade . For the land is large enough to hold them , and we can intermarry with them .
TLB	Genesis	34	22	But they will only consider staying here on one condition—that every one of us men be circumcised , the same as they are .
TLB	Genesis	34	23	But if we do this , then all they have will become ours and the land will be enriched . Come on , let ’ s agree to this so that they will settle here among us. ”
TLB	Genesis	34	24	So all the men agreed , and all were circumcised .
TLB	Genesis	34	25	But three days later , when their wounds were sore and sensitive to every move they made , two of Dinah ’ s brothers , Simeon and Levi , took their swords , entered the city without opposition , and slaughtered every man there ,
TLB	Genesis	34	26	including Hamor and Shechem . They rescued Dinah from Shechem ’ s house and returned to their camp again .
TLB	Genesis	34	27	Then all of Jacob ’ s sons went over and plundered the city because their sister had been dishonored there .
TLB	Genesis	34	28	They confiscated all the flocks and herds and donkeys—everything they could lay their hands on , both inside the city and outside in the fields ,
TLB	Genesis	34	29	and took all the women and children , and wealth of every kind .
TLB	Genesis	34	30	Then Jacob said to Levi and Simeon , “ You have made me stink among all the people of this land—all the Canaanites and Perizzites . We are so few that they will come and crush us , and we will all be killed. ”
TLB	Genesis	34	31	“ Should he treat our sister like a prostitute ? ” they retorted . Footnotes - Genesis 34:20 appeared before the city council , literally , “ came into the gate of their city. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Genesis	35	35	“ Move on to Bethel now , and settle there , ” God said to Jacob , “ and build an altar to worship me—the God who appeared to you when you fled from your brother Esau. ”
TLB	Genesis	35	2	So Jacob instructed all those in his household to destroy the idols they had brought with them , and to wash themselves and to put on fresh clothing .
TLB	Genesis	35	3	“ For we are going to Bethel , ” he told them , “ and I will build an altar there to the God who answered my prayers in the day of my distress , and was with me on my journey. ”
TLB	Genesis	35	4	So they gave Jacob all their idols and their earrings , and he buried them beneath the oak tree near Shechem .
TLB	Genesis	35	5	Then they started on again . And the terror of God was upon all the cities they journeyed through , so that they were not attacked .
TLB	Genesis	35	6	Finally they arrived at Luz ( also called Bethel ) , in Canaan .
TLB	Genesis	35	7	And Jacob erected an altar there and named it “ the altar to the God who met me here at Bethel ” [ a ] because it was there at Bethel that God appeared to him when he was fleeing from Esau .
TLB	Genesis	35	8	Soon after this [ b ] Rebekah ’ s old nurse , Deborah , died and was buried beneath the oak tree in the valley below Bethel . And ever after it was called “ The Oak of Weeping. ”
TLB	Genesis	35	9	Upon Jacob ’ s arrival at Bethel , en route from Paddan-aram , God appeared to him once again and blessed him .
TLB	Genesis	35	10	And God said to him , “ You shall no longer be called Jacob ( ‘ Grabber ’ ) , but Israel ( ‘ One who prevails with God ’ ) .
TLB	Genesis	35	11	I am God Almighty , ” the Lord said to him , “ and I will cause you to be fertile and to multiply and to become a great nation , yes , many nations ; many kings shall be among your descendants .
TLB	Genesis	35	12	And I will pass on to you the land I gave to Abraham and Isaac . Yes , I will give it to you and to your descendants. ” 13-14 Afterwards Jacob built a stone pillar at the place where God had appeared to him ; and he poured wine over it as an offering to God and then anointed the pillar with olive oil .
TLB	Genesis	35	15	Jacob named the spot Bethel ( “ House of God ” ) , because God had spoken to him there .
TLB	Genesis	35	16	Leaving Bethel , he and his household traveled on toward Ephrath ( Bethlehem ) . But Rachel ’ s pains of childbirth began while they were still a long way away .
TLB	Genesis	35	17	After a very hard delivery , the midwife finally exclaimed , “ Wonderful—another boy ! ”
TLB	Genesis	35	18	And with Rachel ’ s last breath ( for she died ) she named him “ Ben-oni ” ( “ Son of my sorrow ” ) ; but his father called him “ Benjamin ” ( “ Son of my right hand ” ) .
TLB	Genesis	35	19	So Rachel died , and was buried near the road to Ephrath ( also called Bethlehem ) .
TLB	Genesis	35	20	And Jacob set up a monument of stones upon her grave , and it is there to this day .
TLB	Genesis	35	21	Then Israel journeyed on and camped beyond the Tower of Eder .
TLB	Genesis	35	22	It was while he was there that Reuben slept with Bilhah , his father ’ s concubine , and someone told Israel about it . Here are the names of the twelve sons of Jacob :
TLB	Genesis	35	23	The sons of Leah : Reuben , Jacob ’ s oldest child , Simeon , Levi , Judah , Issachar , Zebulun .
TLB	Genesis	35	24	The sons of Rachel : Joseph , Benjamin .
TLB	Genesis	35	25	The sons of Bilhah , Rachel ’ s servant girl : Dan , Naphtali .
TLB	Genesis	35	26	The sons of Zilpah , Leah ’ s servant girl : Gad , Asher . All these were born to him at Paddan-aram .
TLB	Genesis	35	27	So Jacob came at last to Isaac his father at Mamre in Kiriath-arba ( now called Hebron ) , where Abraham too had lived . 28-29 Isaac died soon afterwards , at the ripe old age of
TLB	Genesis	35	180	. And his sons Esau and Jacob buried him . Footnotes - Genesis 35:7 the God who met me here at Bethel , literally , “ the God of Bethel. ” - Genesis 35:8 Soon after this , implied . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Genesis	37	37	So Jacob settled again in the land of Canaan , where his father had lived .
TLB	Genesis	37	2	Jacob ’ s son Joseph was now seventeen years old . His job , along with his half brothers , the sons of his father ’ s wives Bilhah and Zilpah , was to shepherd his father ’ s flocks . But Joseph reported to his father some of the bad things they were doing .
TLB	Genesis	37	3	Now as it happened , Israel loved Joseph more than any of his other children , because Joseph was born to him in his old age . So one day Jacob gave him a special gift—a brightly colored coat . [ a ]
TLB	Genesis	37	4	His brothers of course noticed their father ’ s partiality , and consequently hated Joseph ; they couldn ’ t say a kind word to him .
TLB	Genesis	37	5	One night Joseph had a dream and promptly reported the details to his brothers , causing even deeper hatred .
TLB	Genesis	37	6	“ Listen to this , ” he proudly announced .
TLB	Genesis	37	7	“ We were out in the field binding sheaves , and my sheaf stood up , and your sheaves all gathered around it and bowed low before it ! ”
TLB	Genesis	37	8	“ So you want to be our king , do you ? ” his brothers derided . And they hated him both for the dream and for his cocky attitude .
TLB	Genesis	37	9	Then he had another dream and told it to his brothers . “ Listen to my latest dream , ” he boasted . “ The sun , moon , and eleven stars bowed low before me ! ”
TLB	Genesis	37	10	This time he told his father as well as his brothers ; but his father rebuked him . “ What is this ? ” he asked . “ Shall I indeed , and your mother and brothers come and bow before you ? ”
TLB	Genesis	37	11	His brothers were fit to be tied concerning this affair , but his father gave it quite a bit of thought and wondered what it all meant .
TLB	Genesis	37	12	One day Joseph ’ s brothers took their father ’ s flocks to Shechem to graze them there . 13-14 A few days later Israel called for Joseph , and told him , “ Your brothers are over in Shechem grazing the flocks . Go and see how they are getting along , and how it is with the flocks , and bring me word. ” “ Very good , ” Joseph replied . So he traveled to Shechem from his home at Hebron Valley .
TLB	Genesis	37	15	A man noticed him wandering in the fields . “ Who are you looking for ? ” he asked .
TLB	Genesis	37	16	“ For my brothers and their flocks , ” Joseph replied . “ Have you seen them ? ”
TLB	Genesis	37	17	“ Yes , ” the man told him , “ they are no longer here . I heard your brothers say they were going to Dothan. ” So Joseph followed them to Dothan and found them there .
TLB	Genesis	37	18	But when they saw him coming , recognizing him in the distance , they decided to kill him ! 19-20 “ Here comes that master-dreamer , ” they exclaimed . “ Come on , let ’ s kill him and toss him into a well and tell Father that a wild animal has eaten him . Then we ’ ll see what will become of all his dreams ! ” 21-22 But Reuben hoped to spare Joseph ’ s life . “ Let ’ s not kill him , ” he said ; “ we ’ ll shed no blood—let ’ s throw him alive into this well here ; that way he ’ ll die without our touching him ! ” ( Reuben was planning to get him out later and return him to his father . )
TLB	Genesis	37	23	So when Joseph got there , they pulled off his brightly colored robe ,
TLB	Genesis	37	24	and threw him into an empty well—there was no water in it .
TLB	Genesis	37	25	Then they sat down for supper . Suddenly they noticed a string of camels coming towards them in the distance , probably Ishmaelite traders who were taking gum , spices , and herbs from Gilead to Egypt . 26-27 “ Look there , ” Judah said to the others . “ Here come some Ishmaelites . Let ’ s sell Joseph to them ! Why kill him and have a guilty conscience ? Let ’ s not be responsible for his death , for , after all , he is our brother ! ” And his brothers agreed .
TLB	Genesis	37	28	So when the traders [ b ] came by , his brothers pulled Joseph out of the well and sold him to them for twenty pieces of silver , and they took him along to Egypt .
TLB	Genesis	37	29	Some time later , Reuben ( who was away when the traders came by ) [ c ] returned to get Joseph out of the well . When Joseph wasn ’ t there , he ripped at his clothes in anguish and frustration .
TLB	Genesis	37	30	“ The child is gone ; and I , where shall I go now ? ” he wept to his brothers .
TLB	Genesis	37	31	Then the brothers killed a goat and spattered its blood on Joseph ’ s coat ,
TLB	Genesis	37	32	and took the coat to their father and asked him to identify it . “ We found this in the field , ” they told him . “ Is it Joseph ’ s coat or not ? ”
TLB	Genesis	37	33	Their father recognized it at once . “ Yes , ” he sobbed , “ it is my son ’ s coat . A wild animal has eaten him . Joseph is without doubt torn in pieces. ”
TLB	Genesis	37	34	Then Israel tore his garments and put on sackcloth and mourned for his son in deepest mourning for many weeks .
TLB	Genesis	37	35	His family all tried to comfort him , but it was no use . “ I will die in mourning for my son , ” he would say , and then break down and cry .
TLB	Genesis	37	36	Meanwhile , in Egypt , the traders sold Joseph to Potiphar , an officer of the Pharaoh—the king of Egypt . Potiphar was captain of the palace guard , the chief executioner . Footnotes - Genesis 37:3 a brightly colored coat , more literally , “ an ornamented tunic ” or “ long-sleeved tunic. ” - Genesis 37:28 traders , literally , “ Midianites. ” - Genesis 37:29 who was away when the traders came by , implied .

TLB	Genesis	38	38	About this time , Judah left home and moved to Adullam and lived there with a man named Hirah .
TLB	Genesis	38	2	There he met and married a Canaanite girl—the daughter of Shua . 3-5 They lived at Chezib and had three sons , Er , Onan , and Shelah . These names were given to them by their mother , except for Er , who was named by his father .
TLB	Genesis	38	6	When his oldest son , Er , grew up , Judah arranged for him to marry a girl named Tamar .
TLB	Genesis	38	7	But Er was a wicked man , and so the Lord killed him .
TLB	Genesis	38	8	Then Judah said to Er ’ s brother , Onan , “ You must marry Tamar , as our law requires of a dead man ’ s brother ; so that her sons from you will be your brother ’ s heirs. ”
TLB	Genesis	38	9	But Onan was not willing to have a child who would not be counted as his own , and so , although he married her , [ a ] whenever he went in to sleep with her , he spilled the sperm on the bed to prevent her from having a baby which would be his brother ’ s .
TLB	Genesis	38	10	So far as the Lord was concerned , it was very wrong of him to deny a child to his deceased brother , so he killed him , too .
TLB	Genesis	38	11	Then Judah told Tamar , his daughter-in-law , not to marry again at that time , but to return to her childhood home and to her parents , and to remain a widow there until his youngest son , Shelah , was old enough to marry her . ( But he didn ’ t really intend for Shelah to do this , for fear God would kill him , too , just as he had his two brothers . ) So Tamar went home to her parents .
TLB	Genesis	38	12	In the process of time Judah ’ s wife died . After the time of mourning was over , Judah and his friend Hirah , the Adullamite , went to Timnah to supervise the shearing of his sheep .
TLB	Genesis	38	13	When someone told Tamar that her father-in-law had left for the sheepshearing at Timnah ,
TLB	Genesis	38	14	and realizing by now that she was not going to be permitted to marry Shelah , though he was fully grown , she laid aside her widow ’ s clothing and covered herself with a veil to disguise herself , and sat beside the road at the entrance to the village of Enaim , which is on the way to Timnah .
TLB	Genesis	38	15	Judah noticed her as he went by and thought she was a prostitute , since her face was veiled .
TLB	Genesis	38	16	So he stopped and propositioned her to sleep with him , not realizing of course that she was his own daughter-in-law . “ How much will you pay me ? ” she asked .
TLB	Genesis	38	17	“ I ’ ll send you a young goat from my flock , ” he promised . “ What pledge will you give me , so that I can be sure you will send it ? ” she asked .
TLB	Genesis	38	18	“ Well , what do you want ? ” he inquired . “ Your identification seal and your walking stick , ” she replied . So he gave them to her and she let him come and sleep with her ; and she became pregnant as a result .
TLB	Genesis	38	19	Afterwards she resumed wearing her widow ’ s clothing as usual .
TLB	Genesis	38	20	Judah asked his friend Hirah the Adullamite to take the young goat back to her , and to pick up the pledges he had given her , but Hirah couldn ’ t find her !
TLB	Genesis	38	21	So he asked around of the men of the city , “ Where does the prostitute live who was soliciting out beside the road at the entrance of the village ? ” “ But we ’ ve never had a public prostitute here , ” they replied .
TLB	Genesis	38	22	So he returned to Judah and told him he couldn ’ t find her anywhere , and what the men of the place had told him .
TLB	Genesis	38	23	“ Then let her keep them ! ” Judah exclaimed . “ We tried our best . We ’ d be the laughingstock of the town to go back again. ”
TLB	Genesis	38	24	About three months later word reached Judah that Tamar , his daughter-in-law , was pregnant , obviously as a result of prostitution . “ Bring her out and burn her , ” Judah shouted .
TLB	Genesis	38	25	But as they were taking her out to kill her she sent this message to her father-in-law : “ The man who owns this identification seal and walking stick is the father of my child . Do you recognize them ? ”
TLB	Genesis	38	26	Judah admitted that they were his and said , “ She is more in the right than I am , because I refused to keep my promise to give her to my son Shelah. ” But he did not marry her .
TLB	Genesis	38	27	In due season the time of her delivery arrived and she had twin sons .
TLB	Genesis	38	28	As they were being born , the midwife tied a scarlet thread around the wrist of the child who appeared first ,
TLB	Genesis	38	29	but he drew back his hand and the other baby was actually the first to be born . “ Where did you come from ! ” she exclaimed . And ever after he was called Perez ( meaning “ Bursting Out ” ) .
TLB	Genesis	38	30	Then , soon afterwards , the baby with the scarlet thread on his wrist was born , and he was named Zerah . Footnotes - Genesis 38:9 although he married her , implied . he spilled the sperm on the bed , literally , “ spilled it on the ground. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Genesis	39	39	When Joseph arrived in Egypt as a captive of the Ishmaelite traders , he was purchased from them by Potiphar , a member of the personal staff of Pharaoh , the king of Egypt . Now this man Potiphar was the captain of the king ’ s bodyguard and his chief executioner .
TLB	Genesis	39	2	The Lord greatly blessed Joseph there in the home of his master , so that everything he did succeeded .
TLB	Genesis	39	3	Potiphar noticed this and realized that the Lord was with Joseph in a very special way .
TLB	Genesis	39	4	So Joseph naturally became quite a favorite with him . Soon he was put in charge of the administration of Potiphar ’ s household , and all of his business affairs .
TLB	Genesis	39	5	At once the Lord began blessing Potiphar for Joseph ’ s sake . All his household affairs began to run smoothly , his crops flourished and his flocks multiplied .
TLB	Genesis	39	6	So Potiphar gave Joseph the complete administrative responsibility over everything he owned . He hadn ’ t a worry in the world with Joseph there , except to decide what he wanted to eat ! Joseph , by the way , was a very handsome young man .
TLB	Genesis	39	7	One day at about this time Potiphar ’ s wife began making eyes at Joseph , and suggested that he come and sleep with her .
TLB	Genesis	39	8	Joseph refused . “ Look , ” he told her , “ my master trusts me with everything in the entire household ;
TLB	Genesis	39	9	he himself has no more authority here than I have ! He has held back nothing from me except you yourself because you are his wife . How can I do such a wicked thing as this ? It would be a great sin against God. ”
TLB	Genesis	39	10	But she kept on with her suggestions day after day , even though he refused to listen , and kept out of her way as much as possible .
TLB	Genesis	39	11	Then one day as he was in the house going about his work—as it happened , no one else was around at the time—
TLB	Genesis	39	12	she came and grabbed him by the sleeve [ a ] demanding , “ Sleep with me. ” He tore himself away , but as he did , his jacket slipped off and she was left holding it as he fled from the house .
TLB	Genesis	39	13	When she saw that she had his jacket , and that he had fled , 14-15 she began screaming ; and when the other men around the place came running in to see what had happened , she was crying hysterically . “ My husband had to bring in this Hebrew slave to insult us ! ” she sobbed . “ He tried to rape me , but when I screamed , he ran , and forgot to take his jacket. ”
TLB	Genesis	39	16	She kept the jacket , and when her husband came home that night ,
TLB	Genesis	39	17	she told him her story . “ That Hebrew slave you ’ ve had around here tried to rape me ,
TLB	Genesis	39	18	and I was only saved by my screams . He fled , leaving his jacket behind ! ”
TLB	Genesis	39	19	Well , when her husband heard his wife ’ s story , he was furious .
TLB	Genesis	39	20	He threw Joseph into prison , where the king ’ s prisoners were kept in chains .
TLB	Genesis	39	21	But the Lord was with Joseph there , too , and was kind to him by granting him favor with the chief jailer .
TLB	Genesis	39	22	In fact , the jailer soon handed over the entire prison administration to Joseph , so that all the other prisoners were responsible to him .
TLB	Genesis	39	23	The chief jailer had no more worries after that , for Joseph took care of everything , and the Lord was with him so that everything ran smoothly and well . Footnotes - Genesis 39:12 sleeve . The Hebrew word is not specific . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Genesis	40	40	1-3 Some time later it so happened that the king of Egypt became angry with both his chief baker and his chief butler , so he jailed them both in the prison where Joseph was , in the castle of Potiphar , the captain of the guard , who was the chief executioner .
TLB	Genesis	40	4	They remained under arrest there for quite some time , and Potiphar assigned Joseph to wait on them .
TLB	Genesis	40	5	One night each of them had a dream .
TLB	Genesis	40	6	The next morning Joseph noticed that they looked dejected and sad .
TLB	Genesis	40	7	“ What in the world is the matter ? ” he asked .
TLB	Genesis	40	8	And they replied , “ We both had dreams last night , but there is no one here to tell us what they mean. ” “ Interpreting dreams is God ’ s business , ” Joseph replied . “ Tell me what you saw. ” 9-10 The butler told his dream first . “ In my dream , ” he said , “ I saw a vine with three branches that began to bud and blossom , and soon there were clusters of ripe grapes .
TLB	Genesis	40	11	I was holding Pharaoh ’ s wine cup in my hand , so I took the grapes and squeezed the juice into it , and gave it to him to drink. ”
TLB	Genesis	40	12	“ I know what the dream means , ” Joseph said . “ The three branches mean three days !
TLB	Genesis	40	13	Within three days Pharaoh is going to take you out of prison and give you back your job again as his chief butler .
TLB	Genesis	40	14	And please have some pity on me when you are back in his favor , and mention me to Pharaoh , and ask him to let me out of here .
TLB	Genesis	40	15	For I was kidnapped from my homeland among the Hebrews , and now this—here I am in jail when I did nothing to deserve it. ”
TLB	Genesis	40	16	When the chief baker saw that the first dream had such a good meaning , he told his dream to Joseph , too . “ In my dream , ” he said , “ there were three baskets of pastries on my head .
TLB	Genesis	40	17	In the top basket were all kinds of bakery goods for Pharaoh , but the birds came and ate them. ” 18-19 “ The three baskets mean three days , ” Joseph told him . “ Three days from now Pharaoh will take off your head and impale your body on a pole , and the birds will come and pick off your flesh ! ”
TLB	Genesis	40	20	Pharaoh ’ s birthday came three days later , and he held a party for all of his officials and household staff . He sent for his chief butler and chief baker , and they were brought to him from the prison .
TLB	Genesis	40	21	Then he restored the chief butler to his former position ;
TLB	Genesis	40	22	but he sentenced the chief baker to be impaled , just as Joseph had predicted .
TLB	Genesis	40	23	Pharaoh ’ s wine taster , however , promptly forgot all about Joseph , never giving him a thought . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Genesis	41	41	One night two years later , Pharaoh dreamed that he was standing on the bank of the Nile River ,
TLB	Genesis	41	2	when suddenly , seven sleek , fat cows came up out of the river and began grazing in the grass .
TLB	Genesis	41	3	Then seven other cows came up from the river , but they were very skinny and all their ribs stood out . They went over and stood beside the fat cows .
TLB	Genesis	41	4	Then the skinny cows ate the fat ones ! At which point , Pharaoh woke up !
TLB	Genesis	41	5	Soon he fell asleep again and had a second dream . This time he saw seven heads of grain on one stalk , with every kernel well formed and plump .
TLB	Genesis	41	6	Then , suddenly , seven more heads appeared on the stalk , but these were shriveled and withered by the east wind .
TLB	Genesis	41	7	And these thin heads swallowed up the seven plump , well-formed heads ! Then Pharaoh woke up again and realized it was all a dream .
TLB	Genesis	41	8	Next morning , as he thought about it , he became very concerned as to what the dreams might mean ; he called for all the magicians and sages of Egypt and told them about it , but not one of them could suggest what his dreams meant .
TLB	Genesis	41	9	Then the king ’ s wine taster spoke up . “ Today I remember my sin ! ” he said .
TLB	Genesis	41	10	“ Some time ago when you were angry with a couple of us and put me and the chief baker in jail in the castle of the captain of the guard ,
TLB	Genesis	41	11	the chief baker and I each had a dream one night .
TLB	Genesis	41	12	We told the dreams to a young Hebrew fellow there who was a slave of the captain of the guard , and he told us what our dreams meant .
TLB	Genesis	41	13	And everything happened just as he said : I was restored to my position of wine taster , and the chief baker was executed , and impaled on a pole. ”
TLB	Genesis	41	14	Pharaoh sent at once for Joseph . He was brought hastily from the dungeon , and after a quick shave and change of clothes , came in before Pharaoh .
TLB	Genesis	41	15	“ I had a dream last night , ” Pharaoh told him , “ and none of these men can tell me what it means . But I have heard that you can interpret dreams , and that is why I have called for you. ”
TLB	Genesis	41	16	“ I can ’ t do it by myself , ” Joseph replied , “ but God will tell you what it means ! ”
TLB	Genesis	41	17	So Pharaoh told him the dream . “ I was standing upon the bank of the Nile River , ” he said ,
TLB	Genesis	41	18	“ when suddenly , seven fat , healthy-looking cows came up out of the river and began grazing along the riverbank .
TLB	Genesis	41	19	But then seven other cows came up from the river , very skinny and bony—in fact , I ’ ve never seen such poor-looking specimens in all the land of Egypt .
TLB	Genesis	41	20	And these skinny cattle ate up the seven fat ones that had come out first ,
TLB	Genesis	41	21	and afterwards they were still as skinny as before ! Then I woke up .
TLB	Genesis	41	22	“ A little later I had another dream . This time there were seven heads of grain on one stalk , and all seven heads were plump and full .
TLB	Genesis	41	23	Then , out of the same stalk , came seven withered , thin heads .
TLB	Genesis	41	24	And the thin heads swallowed up the fat ones ! I told all this to my magicians , but not one of them could tell me the meaning. ”
TLB	Genesis	41	25	“ Both dreams mean the same thing , ” Joseph told Pharaoh . “ God was telling you what he is going to do here in the land of Egypt .
TLB	Genesis	41	26	The seven fat cows ( and also the seven fat , well-formed heads of grain ) mean that there are seven years of prosperity ahead .
TLB	Genesis	41	27	The seven skinny cows ( and also the seven thin and withered heads of grain ) indicate that there will be seven years of famine following the seven years of prosperity .
TLB	Genesis	41	28	“ So God has showed you what he is about to do :
TLB	Genesis	41	29	The next seven years will be a period of great prosperity throughout all the land of Egypt ;
TLB	Genesis	41	30	but afterwards there will be seven years of famine so great that all the prosperity will be forgotten and wiped out ; famine will consume the land .
TLB	Genesis	41	31	The famine will be so terrible that even the memory of the good years will be erased .
TLB	Genesis	41	32	The double dream gives double impact , showing that what I have told you is certainly going to happen , for God has decreed it , and it is going to happen soon .
TLB	Genesis	41	33	My suggestion is that you find the wisest man in Egypt and put him in charge of administering a nationwide farm program . 34-35 Let Pharaoh divide Egypt into five administrative districts , [ a ] and let the officials of these districts gather into the royal storehouses all the excess crops of the next seven years ,
TLB	Genesis	41	36	so that there will be enough to eat when the seven years of famine come . Otherwise , disaster will surely strike. ”
TLB	Genesis	41	37	Joseph ’ s suggestions were well received by Pharaoh and his assistants .
TLB	Genesis	41	38	As they discussed who should be appointed for the job , Pharaoh said , “ Who could do it better than Joseph ? For he is a man who is obviously filled with the Spirit of God. ”
TLB	Genesis	41	39	Turning to Joseph , Pharaoh said to him , “ Since God has revealed the meaning of the dreams to you , you are the wisest man in the country !
TLB	Genesis	41	40	I am hereby appointing you to be in charge of this entire project . What you say goes , throughout all the land of Egypt . I alone will outrank you. ” 41-42 Then Pharaoh placed his own signet ring on Joseph ’ s finger as a token of his authority , and dressed him in beautiful clothing and placed the royal gold chain about his neck and declared , “ See , I have placed you in charge of all the land of Egypt. ”
TLB	Genesis	41	43	Pharaoh also gave Joseph the chariot of his second-in-command , and wherever he went the shout arose , “ Kneel down ! ”
TLB	Genesis	41	44	And Pharaoh declared to Joseph , “ I , the king of Egypt , swear that you shall have complete charge over all the land of Egypt. ”
TLB	Genesis	41	45	Pharaoh gave him a name meaning “ He has the godlike power of life and death ! ” [ b ] And he gave him a wife , a girl named Asenath , daughter of Potiphera , priest of Heliopolis . So Joseph became famous throughout the land of Egypt .
TLB	Genesis	41	46	He was thirty years old as he entered the service of the king . Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh and began traveling all across the land .
TLB	Genesis	41	47	And sure enough , for the next seven years there were bumper crops everywhere .
TLB	Genesis	41	48	During those years , Joseph requisitioned for the government a portion of all the crops grown throughout Egypt , storing them in nearby cities .
TLB	Genesis	41	49	After seven years of this , the granaries were full to overflowing , and there was so much that no one kept track of the amount .
TLB	Genesis	41	50	During this time before the arrival of the first of the famine years , two sons were born to Joseph by Asenath , the daughter of Potiphera , priest of the sun god Re of Heliopolis .
TLB	Genesis	41	51	Joseph named his oldest son Manasseh ( meaning “ Made to Forget ” —what he meant was that God had made up to him for all the anguish of his youth , and for the loss of his father ’ s home ) .
TLB	Genesis	41	52	The second boy was named Ephraim ( meaning “ Fruitful ” — “ For God has made me fruitful in this land of my slavery , ” he said ) .
TLB	Genesis	41	53	So at last the seven years of plenty came to an end .
TLB	Genesis	41	54	Then the seven years of famine began , just as Joseph had predicted . There were crop failures in all the surrounding countries , too , but in Egypt there was plenty of grain in the storehouses .
TLB	Genesis	41	55	The people began to starve . They pleaded with Pharaoh for food , and he sent them to Joseph . “ Do whatever he tells you to , ” he instructed them . 56-57 So now , with severe famine all over the world , Joseph opened up the storehouses and sold grain to the Egyptians and to those from other lands who came to Egypt to buy grain from Joseph .

TLB	Genesis	42	42	When Jacob heard that there was grain available in Egypt he said to his sons , “ Why are you standing around looking at one another ?
TLB	Genesis	42	2	I have heard that there is grain available in Egypt . Go down and buy some for us before we all starve to death. ”
TLB	Genesis	42	3	So Joseph ’ s ten older [ a ] brothers went down to Egypt to buy grain .
TLB	Genesis	42	4	However , Jacob wouldn ’ t let Joseph ’ s younger brother Benjamin go with them , for fear some harm might happen to him as it had to his brother Joseph . [ b ]
TLB	Genesis	42	5	So it was that Israel ’ s sons arrived in Egypt along with many others from many lands to buy food , for the famine was as severe in Canaan as it was everywhere else .
TLB	Genesis	42	6	Since Joseph was governor of all Egypt , and in charge of the sale of the grain , it was to him that his brothers came , and bowed low before him , with their faces to the earth .
TLB	Genesis	42	7	Joseph recognized them instantly , but pretended he didn ’ t . “ Where are you from ? ” he demanded roughly . “ From the land of Canaan , ” they replied . “ We have come to buy grain. ” 8-9 Then Joseph remembered the dreams of long ago ! But he said to them , “ You are spies . You have come to see how destitute the famine has made our land. ”
TLB	Genesis	42	10	“ No , no , ” they exclaimed . “ We have come to buy food .
TLB	Genesis	42	11	We are all brothers and honest men , sir ! We are not spies ! ”
TLB	Genesis	42	12	“ Yes , you are , ” he insisted . “ You have come to see how weak we are. ”
TLB	Genesis	42	13	“ Sir , ” they said , “ there are twelve of us brothers , and our father is in the land of Canaan . Our youngest brother is there with our father , and one of our brothers is dead. ”
TLB	Genesis	42	14	“ So ? ” Joseph asked . “ What does that prove ? [ c ] You are spies .
TLB	Genesis	42	15	This is the way I will test your story : I swear by the life of Pharaoh that you are not going to leave Egypt until this youngest brother comes here .
TLB	Genesis	42	16	One of you go and get your brother ! I ’ ll keep the rest of you here , bound in prison . Then we ’ ll find out whether your story is true or not . If it turns out that you don ’ t have a younger brother , then I ’ ll know you are spies. ”
TLB	Genesis	42	17	So he threw them all into jail for three days .
TLB	Genesis	42	18	The third day Joseph said to them , “ I am a God-fearing man and I ’ m going to give you an opportunity to prove yourselves .
TLB	Genesis	42	19	I ’ m going to take a chance that you are honorable ; [ d ] only one of you shall remain in chains in jail , and the rest of you may go on home with grain for your families ;
TLB	Genesis	42	20	but bring your youngest brother back to me . In this way I will know whether you are telling me the truth ; and if you are , I will spare you. ” To this they agreed .
TLB	Genesis	42	21	Speaking among themselves , they said , “ This has all happened because of what we did to Joseph long ago . We saw his terror and anguish and heard his pleadings , but we wouldn ’ t listen. ”
TLB	Genesis	42	22	“ Didn ’ t I tell you not to do it ? ” Reuben asked . “ But you wouldn ’ t listen . And now we are going to die because we murdered him. ”
TLB	Genesis	42	23	Of course they didn ’ t know that Joseph understood them as he was standing there , for he had been speaking to them through an interpreter .
TLB	Genesis	42	24	Now he left the room and found a place where he could weep . Returning , he selected Simeon from among them and had him bound before their eyes .
TLB	Genesis	42	25	Joseph then ordered his servants to fill the men ’ s sacks with grain , but also gave secret instructions to put each brother ’ s payment at the top of his sack ! He also gave them provisions for their journey .
TLB	Genesis	42	26	So they loaded up their donkeys with the grain and started for home .
TLB	Genesis	42	27	But when they stopped for the night and one of them opened his sack to get some grain to feed the donkeys , there was his money in the mouth of the sack !
TLB	Genesis	42	28	“ Look , ” he exclaimed to his brothers , “ my money is here in my sack. ” They were filled with terror . Trembling , they exclaimed to each other . “ What is this that God has done to us ? ”
TLB	Genesis	42	29	So they came to their father , Jacob , in the land of Canaan and told him all that had happened .
TLB	Genesis	42	30	“ The king ’ s chief assistant spoke very roughly to us , ” they told him , “ and took us for spies .
TLB	Genesis	42	31	‘ No , no , ’ we said , ‘ we are honest men , not spies .
TLB	Genesis	42	32	We are twelve brothers , sons of one father ; one is dead , and the youngest is with our father in the land of Canaan. ’
TLB	Genesis	42	33	Then the man told us , ‘ This is the way I will find out if you are what you claim to be . Leave one of your brothers here with me and take grain for your families and go on home ,
TLB	Genesis	42	34	but bring your youngest brother back to me . Then I shall know whether you are spies or honest men ; if you prove to be what you say , then I will give you back your brother and you can come as often as you like to purchase grain. ’ ”
TLB	Genesis	42	35	As they emptied out the sacks , there at the top of each was the money paid for the grain ! Terror gripped them , as it did their father .
TLB	Genesis	42	36	Then Jacob exclaimed , “ You have bereaved me of my children—Joseph didn ’ t come back , Simeon is gone , and now you want to take Benjamin too ! Everything has been against me. ”
TLB	Genesis	42	37	Then Reuben said to his father , “ Kill my two sons if I don ’ t bring Benjamin back to you . I ’ ll be responsible for him. ”
TLB	Genesis	42	38	But Jacob replied , “ My son shall not go down with you , for his brother Joseph is dead and he alone is left of his mother ’ s children . If anything should happen to him , I would die. ” Footnotes - Genesis 42:3 ten older , implied . - Genesis 42:4 as it had to his brother Joseph , implied . - Genesis 42:14 What does that prove ? literally , “ It is as I said : you are spies. ” - Genesis 42:19 I ’ m going to take a chance that you are honorable , literally , “ if you are forthright men. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Genesis	43	43	But there was no relief from the terrible famine throughout the land .
TLB	Genesis	43	2	When the grain they had brought from Egypt was almost gone , their father said to them , “ Go again and buy us a little food. ” 3-5 But Judah told him , “ The man wasn ’ t fooling one bit when he said , ‘ Don ’ t ever come back again unless your brother is with you. ’ We can not go unless you let Benjamin go with us. ”
TLB	Genesis	43	6	“ Why did you ever tell him you had another brother ? ” Israel moaned . “ Why did you have to treat me like that ? ”
TLB	Genesis	43	7	“ But the man specifically asked us about our family , ” they told him . “ He wanted to know whether our father was still living and he asked us if we had another brother , so we told him . How could we know that he was going to say , ‘ Bring me your brother ’ ? ”
TLB	Genesis	43	8	Judah said to his father , “ Send the lad with me and we will be on our way ; otherwise we will all die of starvation—and not only we , but you and all our little ones .
TLB	Genesis	43	9	I guarantee his safety . If I don ’ t bring him back to you , then let me bear the blame forever .
TLB	Genesis	43	10	For we could have gone and returned by this time if you had let him come. ”
TLB	Genesis	43	11	So their father Israel finally said to them , “ If it can ’ t be avoided , then at least do this . Load your donkeys with the best products of the land . Take them to the man as gifts—balm , honey , spices , myrrh , pistachio nuts , and almonds .
TLB	Genesis	43	12	Take double money so that you can pay back what was in the mouths of your sacks , as it was probably someone ’ s mistake ,
TLB	Genesis	43	13	and take your brother and go .
TLB	Genesis	43	14	May God Almighty give you mercy before the man , so that he will release Simeon and return Benjamin . And if I must bear the anguish of their deaths , then so be it. ”
TLB	Genesis	43	15	So they took the gifts and double money and went to Egypt , and stood before Joseph .
TLB	Genesis	43	16	When Joseph saw that Benjamin was with them , he said to the manager of his household , “ These men will eat with me this noon . Take them home and prepare a big feast. ”
TLB	Genesis	43	17	So the man did as he was told and took them to Joseph ’ s palace .
TLB	Genesis	43	18	They were badly frightened when they saw where they were being taken . “ It ’ s because of the money returned to us in our sacks , ” they said . “ He wants to pretend we stole it and seize us as slaves , with our donkeys. ”
TLB	Genesis	43	19	As they arrived at the entrance to the palace , they went over to Joseph ’ s household manager ,
TLB	Genesis	43	20	and said to him , “ O sir , after our first trip to Egypt to buy food ,
TLB	Genesis	43	21	as we were returning home , we stopped for the night and opened our sacks , and the money was there that we had paid for the grain . Here it is ; we have brought it back again ,
TLB	Genesis	43	22	along with additional money to buy more grain . We have no idea how the money got into our sacks. ”
TLB	Genesis	43	23	“ Don ’ t worry about it , ” the household manager told them ; “ your God , even the God of your fathers , must have put it there , for we collected your money all right. ” Then he released Simeon and brought him out to them .
TLB	Genesis	43	24	They were then conducted into the palace and given water to refresh their feet ; and their donkeys were fed .
TLB	Genesis	43	25	Then they got their presents ready for Joseph ’ s arrival at noon , for they were told that they would be eating there .
TLB	Genesis	43	26	When Joseph came home they gave him their presents , bowing low before him .
TLB	Genesis	43	27	He asked how they had been getting along . “ And how is your father—the old man you spoke about ? Is he still alive ? ”
TLB	Genesis	43	28	“ Yes , ” they replied . “ He is alive and well. ” Then again they bowed before him .
TLB	Genesis	43	29	Looking at his brother Benjamin , [ a ] he asked , “ Is this your youngest brother , the one you told me about ? How are you , my son ? God be gracious to you. ”
TLB	Genesis	43	30	Then Joseph made a hasty exit , for he was overcome with love for his brother and had to go out and cry . Going into his bedroom , he wept there .
TLB	Genesis	43	31	Then he washed his face and came out , keeping himself under control . “ Let ’ s eat , ” he said .
TLB	Genesis	43	32	Joseph ate by himself , his brothers were served at a separate table , and the Egyptians at still another ; for Egyptians despise Hebrews and never eat with them .
TLB	Genesis	43	33	He told each of them where to sit , and seated them in the order of their ages , from the oldest to the youngest , much to their amazement !
TLB	Genesis	43	34	Their food was served to them from his own table . He gave the largest serving to Benjamin—five times as much as to any of the others ! They had a wonderful time bantering back and forth , and the wine flowed freely !

TLB	Genesis	44	44	When his brothers were ready to leave , [ a ] Joseph ordered his household manager to fill each of their sacks with as much grain as they could carry—and to put into the mouth of each man ’ s sack the money he had paid !
TLB	Genesis	44	2	He was also told to put Joseph ’ s own silver cup at the top of Benjamin ’ s sack , along with the grain money . So the household manager did as he was told .
TLB	Genesis	44	3	The brothers were up at dawn and on their way with their loaded donkeys .
TLB	Genesis	44	4	But when they were barely out of the city , Joseph said to his household manager , “ Chase after them and stop them and ask them why they are acting like this when their benefactor has been so kind to them ?
TLB	Genesis	44	5	Ask them , ‘ What do you mean by stealing my lord ’ s personal silver drinking cup , which he uses for fortune-telling ? What a wicked thing you have done ! ’ ”
TLB	Genesis	44	6	So he caught up with them and spoke to them along the lines he had been instructed .
TLB	Genesis	44	7	“ What in the world are you talking about ? ” they demanded . “ What kind of people do you think we are , that you accuse us of such a terrible thing as that ?
TLB	Genesis	44	8	Didn ’ t we bring back the money we found in the mouth of our sacks ? Why would we steal silver or gold from your master ’ s house ?
TLB	Genesis	44	9	If you find his cup with any one of us , let that one die . And all the rest of us will be slaves forever to your master. ”
TLB	Genesis	44	10	“ Fair enough , ” the man replied , “ except that only the one who stole it will be a slave , and the rest of you can go free. ”
TLB	Genesis	44	11	They quickly took down their sacks from the backs of their donkeys and opened them .
TLB	Genesis	44	12	He began searching the oldest brother ’ s sack , going on down the line to the youngest . And the cup was found in Benjamin ’ s !
TLB	Genesis	44	13	They ripped their clothing in despair , loaded the donkeys again , and returned to the city .
TLB	Genesis	44	14	Joseph was still home when Judah and his brothers arrived , and they fell to the ground before him .
TLB	Genesis	44	15	“ What were you trying to do ? ” Joseph demanded . “ Didn ’ t you know such a man as I would know who stole it ? ”
TLB	Genesis	44	16	And Judah said , “ Oh , what shall we say to my lord ? How can we plead ? How can we prove our innocence ? God is punishing us for our sins . Sir , we have all returned to be your slaves , both we and he in whose sack the cup was found. ”
TLB	Genesis	44	17	“ No , ” Joseph said . “ Only the man who stole the cup , he shall be my slave . The rest of you can go on home to your father. ”
TLB	Genesis	44	18	Then Judah stepped forward and said , “ O sir , let me say just this one word to you . Be patient with me for a moment , for I know you can doom me in an instant , as though you were Pharaoh himself .
TLB	Genesis	44	19	“ Sir , you asked us if we had a father or a brother ,
TLB	Genesis	44	20	and we said , ‘ Yes , we have a father , an old man , and a child of his old age , a little one . And his brother is dead , and he alone is left of his mother ’ s children , and his father loves him very much. ’
TLB	Genesis	44	21	And you said to us , ‘ Bring him here so that I can see him. ’
TLB	Genesis	44	22	But we said to you , ‘ Sir , the lad can not leave his father , for his father would die. ’
TLB	Genesis	44	23	But you told us , ‘ Don ’ t come back here unless your youngest brother is with you. ’
TLB	Genesis	44	24	So we returned to our father and told him what you had said .
TLB	Genesis	44	25	And when he said , ‘ Go back again and buy us a little food , ’
TLB	Genesis	44	26	we replied , ‘ We can ’ t , unless you let our youngest brother go with us . Only then may we come. ’
TLB	Genesis	44	27	“ Then my father said to us , ‘ You know that my wife had two sons ,
TLB	Genesis	44	28	and that one of them went away and never returned—doubtless torn to pieces by some wild animal ; I have never seen him since .
TLB	Genesis	44	29	And if you take away his brother from me also , and any harm befalls him , I shall die with sorrow. ’
TLB	Genesis	44	30	And now , sir , if I go back to my father and the lad is not with us—seeing that our father ’ s life is bound up in the lad ’ s life—
TLB	Genesis	44	31	when he sees that the boy is not with us , our father will die ; and we will be responsible for bringing down his gray hairs with sorrow to the grave .
TLB	Genesis	44	32	Sir , I pledged my father that I would take care of the lad . I told him , ‘ If I don ’ t bring him back to you , I shall bear the blame forever. ’
TLB	Genesis	44	33	Please sir , let me stay here as a slave instead of the lad , and let the lad return with his brothers .

TLB	Genesis	45	45	Joseph could stand it no longer . “ Out , all of you , ” he cried out to his attendants , and he was left alone with his brothers .
TLB	Genesis	45	2	Then he wept aloud . His sobs could be heard throughout the palace , and the news was quickly carried to Pharaoh ’ s palace .
TLB	Genesis	45	3	“ I am Joseph ! ” he said to his brothers . “ Is my father still alive ? ” But his brothers couldn ’ t say a word , they were so stunned with surprise .
TLB	Genesis	45	4	“ Come over here , ” he said . So they came closer . And he said again , “ I am Joseph , your brother whom you sold into Egypt !
TLB	Genesis	45	5	But don ’ t be angry with yourselves that you did this to me , for God did it ! He sent me here ahead of you to preserve your lives .
TLB	Genesis	45	6	These two years of famine will grow to seven , during which there will be neither plowing nor harvest .
TLB	Genesis	45	7	God has sent me here to keep you and your families alive , so that you will become a great nation .
TLB	Genesis	45	8	Yes , it was God who sent me here , not you ! And he has made me a counselor to Pharaoh , and manager of this entire nation , ruler of all the land of Egypt .
TLB	Genesis	45	9	“ Hurry , return to my father and tell him , ‘ Your son Joseph says , “ God has made me chief of all the land of Egypt . Come down to me right away !
TLB	Genesis	45	10	You shall live in the land of Goshen so that you can be near me with all your children , your grandchildren , your flocks and herds , and all that you have . 11-12 I will take care of you there ” ’ ( you men are witnesses of my promise , and my brother Benjamin has heard me say it ) ‘ “ for there are still five years of famine ahead of us . Otherwise you will come to utter poverty along with all your household. ” ’
TLB	Genesis	45	13	Tell our father about all my power here in Egypt , and how everyone obeys me . And bring him to me quickly. ”
TLB	Genesis	45	14	Then , weeping with joy , he embraced Benjamin and Benjamin began weeping too .
TLB	Genesis	45	15	And he did the same with each of his brothers , who finally found their tongues !
TLB	Genesis	45	16	The news soon reached Pharaoh— “ Joseph ’ s brothers have come ” ; and Pharaoh was very happy to hear it , as were his officials .
TLB	Genesis	45	17	Then Pharaoh said to Joseph , “ Tell your brothers to load their pack animals and return quickly to their homes in Canaan ,
TLB	Genesis	45	18	and to bring your father and all of your families and come here to Egypt to live . Tell them , ‘ Pharaoh will assign to you the very best territory in the land of Egypt . You shall live off the fat of the land ! ’
TLB	Genesis	45	19	And tell your brothers to take wagons from Egypt to carry their wives and little ones , and to bring your father here .
TLB	Genesis	45	20	Don ’ t worry about your property , for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours. ”
TLB	Genesis	45	21	So Joseph gave them wagons , as Pharaoh had commanded , and provisions for the journey ,
TLB	Genesis	45	22	and he gave each of them new clothes—but to Benjamin he gave five changes of clothes and three hundred pieces of silver !
TLB	Genesis	45	23	He sent his father ten donkey-loads of the good things of Egypt , and ten donkeys loaded with grain and all kinds of other food , to eat on his journey .
TLB	Genesis	45	24	So he sent his brothers off . “ Don ’ t quarrel along the way ! ” was his parting shot !
TLB	Genesis	45	25	And leaving , they returned to the land of Canaan , to Jacob their father .
TLB	Genesis	45	26	“ Joseph is alive , ” they shouted to him . “ And he is ruler over all the land of Egypt ! ” But Jacob ’ s heart was like a stone ; he couldn ’ t take it in .
TLB	Genesis	45	27	But when they had given him Joseph ’ s messages , and when he saw the wagons filled with food that Joseph had sent him , his spirit revived .
TLB	Genesis	45	28	And he said , “ It must be true ! Joseph my son is alive ! I will go and see him before I die. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Genesis	46	46	So Israel set out with all his possessions , and came to Beer-sheba , and offered sacrifices there to the God of his father , Isaac .
TLB	Genesis	46	2	During the night God spoke to him in a vision . “ Jacob ! Jacob ! ” he called . “ Yes ? ” Jacob answered . 3-4 “ I am God , ” the voice replied , “ the God of your father . Don ’ t be afraid to go down to Egypt , for I will see to it that you become a great nation there . And I will go down with you into Egypt and I will bring your descendants back again ; but you shall die in Egypt with Joseph at your side. ”
TLB	Genesis	46	5	So Jacob left Beer-sheba , and his sons brought him to Egypt , along with their little ones and their wives , in the wagons Pharaoh had provided for them .
TLB	Genesis	46	6	They brought their livestock , too , and all their belongings accumulated in the land of Canaan , and came to Egypt—Jacob and all his children ,
TLB	Genesis	46	7	sons and daughters , grandsons and granddaughters—all his loved ones . 8-14 Here are the names of his sons and grandchildren who went with him into Egypt : Reuben , his oldest son ; Reuben ’ s sons : Hanoch , Pallu , Hezron , and Carmi . Simeon and his sons : Jemuel , Jamin , Ohad , Jachin , Zohar , and Shaul ( Shaul ’ s mother was a girl from Canaan ) . Levi and his sons : Gershon , Kohath , Merari . Judah and his sons : Er , Onan , Shelah , Perez , Zerah ( however , Er and Onan died while still in Canaan , before Israel went to Egypt ) . The sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul . Issachar and his sons : Tola , Puvah , Iob , Shimron . Zebulun and his sons : Sered , Elon , Jahleel .
TLB	Genesis	46	15	So these descendants of Jacob and Leah , not including their daughter Dinah , born to Jacob in Paddan-aram , were thirty-three in all . 16-17 Also accompanying him were : Gad and his sons : Ziphion , Haggi , Shuni , Ezbon , Eri , Arodi , and Areli . Asher and his sons : Imnah , Ishvah , Ishvi , Beriah , and a sister , Serah . Beriah ’ s sons were Heber and Malchiel .
TLB	Genesis	46	18	These sixteen persons were the sons of Jacob and Zilpah , the slave girl given to Leah by her father , Laban . 19-22 Also in the total of Jacob ’ s household were these fourteen sons and descendants of Jacob and Rachel : Joseph and Benjamin ; Joseph ’ s sons , born in the land of Egypt , were Manasseh and Ephraim ( their mother was Asenath , the daughter of Potiphera , priest of Heliopolis ) ; Benjamin ’ s sons : Bela , Becher , Ashbel , Gera , Naaman , Ehi , Rosh , Muppim , Huppim , and Ard . 23-25 Also in the group were these seven sons and descendants of Jacob and Bilhah , the slave girl given to Rachel by her father , Laban : Dan and his son : Hushim . Naphtali and his sons : Jahzeel , Guni , Jezer , and Shillem .
TLB	Genesis	46	26	So the total number of those going to Egypt , of his own descendants , not counting the wives of Jacob ’ s sons , was sixty-six .
TLB	Genesis	46	27	With Joseph and his two sons included , the total number of people in Jacob ’ s household there in Egypt was seventy .
TLB	Genesis	46	28	Jacob sent Judah on ahead to tell Joseph that they were on the way , and would soon arrive in Goshen—which they did .
TLB	Genesis	46	29	Joseph jumped into his chariot and journeyed to Goshen to meet his father and they fell into each other ’ s arms and wept a long while .
TLB	Genesis	46	30	Then Israel said to Joseph , “ Now let me die , for I have seen you again and know you are alive. ”
TLB	Genesis	46	31	And Joseph said to his brothers and to all their households , “ I ’ ll go and tell Pharaoh that you are here , and that you have come from the land of Canaan to join me .
TLB	Genesis	46	32	And I will tell him , ‘ These men are shepherds . They have brought with them their flocks and herds and everything they own. ’
TLB	Genesis	46	33	So when Pharaoh calls for you and asks you about your occupation ,
TLB	Genesis	46	34	tell him , ‘ We have been shepherds from our youth , as our fathers have been for many generations. ’ When you tell him this , he will let you live here in the land of Goshen. ” For shepherds were despised and hated in other parts of Egypt . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Genesis	47	47	Upon their arrival , Joseph went in to see Pharaoh . “ My father and my brothers are here from Canaan , ” he reported , “ with all their flocks and herds and possessions . They wish to settle in the land of Goshen. ”
TLB	Genesis	47	2	He took five of his brothers with him , and presented them to Pharaoh .
TLB	Genesis	47	3	Pharaoh asked them , “ What is your occupation ? ” And they replied , “ We are shepherds like our ancestors .
TLB	Genesis	47	4	We have come to live here in Egypt , for there is no pasture for our flocks in Canaan—the famine is very bitter there . We request permission to live in the land of Goshen. ” 5-6 And Pharaoh said to Joseph , “ Choose anywhere you like for them to live . Give them the best land of Egypt . The land of Goshen will be fine . And if any of them are capable , put them in charge of my flocks , too. ”
TLB	Genesis	47	7	Then Joseph brought his father Jacob to Pharaoh . And Jacob blessed Pharaoh .
TLB	Genesis	47	8	“ How old are you ? ” Pharaoh asked him .
TLB	Genesis	47	9	Jacob replied , “ I have lived
TLB	Genesis	47	130	long , hard years , and I am not nearly as old as many of my ancestors. ”
TLB	Genesis	47	10	Then Jacob blessed Pharaoh again before he left .
TLB	Genesis	47	11	So Joseph assigned the best land of Egypt—the land of Rameses—to his father and brothers , just as Pharaoh had commanded .
TLB	Genesis	47	12	And Joseph furnished food to them in accordance with the number of their dependents .
TLB	Genesis	47	13	The famine became worse and worse , so that all the land of Egypt and Canaan was starving .
TLB	Genesis	47	14	Joseph collected all the money in Egypt and Canaan in exchange for grain , and he brought the money to Pharaoh ’ s treasure-houses .
TLB	Genesis	47	15	When the people were out of money , they came to Joseph crying again for food . “ Our money is gone , ” they said , “ but give us bread ; for why should we die ? ”
TLB	Genesis	47	16	“ Well then , ” Joseph replied , “ give me your livestock . I will trade you food in exchange. ”
TLB	Genesis	47	17	So they brought their cattle to Joseph in exchange for food . Soon all the horses , flocks , herds , and donkeys of Egypt were in Pharaoh ’ s possession .
TLB	Genesis	47	18	The next year they came again and said , “ Our money is gone , and our cattle are yours , and there is nothing left but our bodies and land .
TLB	Genesis	47	19	Why should we die ? Buy us and our land and we will be serfs to Pharaoh . We will trade ourselves for food , then we will live , and the land won ’ t be abandoned. ”
TLB	Genesis	47	20	percent of all the crops except those produced on the land owned by the temples .
TLB	Genesis	47	21	Thus all the people of Egypt became Pharaoh ’ s serfs .
TLB	Genesis	47	22	The only land he didn ’ t buy was that belonging to the priests , for they were assigned food from Pharaoh and didn ’ t need to sell .
TLB	Genesis	47	23	Then Joseph said to the people , “ See , I have bought you and your land for Pharaoh . Here is grain . Go and sow the land .
TLB	Genesis	47	24	And when you harvest it , a fifth of everything you get belongs to Pharaoh . Keep four parts for yourselves to be used for next year ’ s seed , and as food for yourselves and for your households and little ones. ”
TLB	Genesis	47	25	“ You have saved our lives , ” they said . “ We will gladly be the serfs of Pharaoh. ”
TLB	Genesis	47	26	So Joseph made it a law throughout the land of Egypt—and it is still the law—that Pharaoh should have as his tax
TLB	Genesis	47	27	So Israel lived in the land of Goshen in Egypt , and soon the people of Israel began to prosper , and there was a veritable population explosion among them .
TLB	Genesis	47	28	Jacob lived seventeen years after his arrival , so that he was
TLB	Genesis	47	147	years old at the time of his death .
TLB	Genesis	47	29	As the time drew near for him to die , he called for his son Joseph and said to him , “ Swear to me most solemnly that you will honor this , my last request : do not bury me in Egypt .
TLB	Genesis	47	30	But when I am dead , take me out of Egypt and bury me beside my ancestors. ” And Joseph promised .
TLB	Genesis	47	31	“ Swear that you will do it , ” Jacob insisted . And Joseph did . Soon afterwards Jacob took to his bed . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Genesis	48	48	One day not long after this , word came to Joseph that his father was failing rapidly . So , taking with him his two sons , Manasseh and Ephraim , he went to visit him .
TLB	Genesis	48	2	When Jacob heard that Joseph had arrived , he gathered his strength and sat up in the bed to greet him ,
TLB	Genesis	48	3	and said to him , “ God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan and blessed me ,
TLB	Genesis	48	4	and said to me , ‘ I will make you a great nation and I will give this land of Canaan to you and to your children ’ s children , for an everlasting possession. ’
TLB	Genesis	48	5	And now , as to these two sons of yours , Ephraim and Manasseh , born here in the land of Egypt before I arrived , I am adopting them as my own , and they will inherit from me just as Reuben and Simeon will .
TLB	Genesis	48	6	But any other children born to you shall be your own , and shall inherit Ephraim ’ s and Manasseh ’ s portion from you .
TLB	Genesis	48	7	For your mother , Rachel , died after only two children [ a ] when I came from Paddan-aram , as we were just a short distance from Ephrath , and I buried her beside the road to Bethlehem. ”
TLB	Genesis	48	8	Then Israel looked over at the two boys . “ Are these the ones ? ” he asked .
TLB	Genesis	48	9	“ Yes , ” Joseph told him , “ these are my sons whom God has given me here in Egypt. ” And Israel said , “ Bring them over to me and I will bless them. ”
TLB	Genesis	48	10	Israel was half blind with age , so that he could hardly see . So Joseph brought the boys close to him and he kissed and embraced them .
TLB	Genesis	48	11	And Israel said to Joseph , “ I never thought that I would see you again , but now God has let me see your children too. ” 12-13 Joseph took the boys by the hand , bowed deeply to him , and led the boys to their grandfather ’ s knees—Ephraim at Israel ’ s left hand and Manasseh at his right .
TLB	Genesis	48	14	But Israel crossed his arms as he stretched them out to lay his hands upon the boys ’ heads , so that his right hand was upon the head of Ephraim , the younger boy , and his left hand was upon the head of Manasseh , the older . He did this purposely .
TLB	Genesis	48	15	Then he blessed Joseph with this blessing : “ May God , the God of my fathers Abraham and Isaac , the God who has shepherded me all my life , wonderfully bless these boys .
TLB	Genesis	48	16	He is the Angel who has kept me from all harm . May these boys be an honor to my name and to the names of my fathers Abraham and Isaac ; and may they become a mighty nation. ”
TLB	Genesis	48	17	But Joseph was upset and displeased when he saw that his father had laid his right hand on Ephraim ’ s head ; so he lifted it to place it on Manasseh ’ s head instead .
TLB	Genesis	48	18	“ No , Father , ” he said . “ You ’ ve got your right hand on the wrong head ! This one over here is the older . Put your right hand on him ! ”
TLB	Genesis	48	19	But his father refused . “ I know what I ’ m doing , my son , ” he said . “ Manasseh too shall become a great nation , but his younger brother shall become even greater. ”
TLB	Genesis	48	20	So Jacob blessed the boys that day with this blessing : “ May the people of Israel bless each other by saying , ‘ God make you as prosperous as Ephraim and Manasseh. ’ ” ( Note that he put Ephraim before Manasseh . )
TLB	Genesis	48	21	Then Israel said to Joseph , “ I am about to die , but God will be with you and will bring you again to Canaan , the land of your fathers .
TLB	Genesis	48	22	And I have given the choice land of Shekem to you instead of to your brothers , as your portion of that land which I took from the Amorites with my sword and with my bow. ” Footnotes - Genesis 48:7 after only two children , implied . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Genesis	49	49	Then Jacob called together all his sons and said , “ Gather around me and I will tell you what is going to happen to you in the days to come .
TLB	Genesis	49	2	Listen to me , O sons of Jacob ; listen to Israel your father .
TLB	Genesis	49	3	“ Reuben , you are my oldest son , the child of my vigorous youth . You are the head of the list in rank and in honor .
TLB	Genesis	49	4	But you are unruly as the wild waves of the sea , and you shall be first no longer . I am demoting you , for you slept with one of my wives and thus dishonored me .
TLB	Genesis	49	5	“ Simeon and Levi are two of a kind . They are men of violence and injustice .
TLB	Genesis	49	6	O my soul , stay away from them . May I never be a party to their wicked plans . For in their anger they murdered a man , and maimed oxen just for fun .
TLB	Genesis	49	7	Cursed be their anger , for it is fierce and cruel . Therefore , I will scatter their descendants throughout Israel . [ a ]
TLB	Genesis	49	8	“ Judah , your brothers shall praise you . You shall destroy your enemies . Your father ’ s sons shall bow before you .
TLB	Genesis	49	9	Judah is a young lion that has finished eating its prey . He has settled down as a lion—who will dare to rouse him ?
TLB	Genesis	49	10	The scepter shall not depart from Judah until Shiloh comes , [ b ] whom all people shall obey .
TLB	Genesis	49	11	He has chained his steed to the choicest vine and washed his clothes in wine . [ c ]
TLB	Genesis	49	12	His eyes are darker than wine and his teeth are whiter than milk .
TLB	Genesis	49	13	“ Zebulun shall dwell on the shores of the sea and shall be a harbor for ships , with his borders extending to Sidon .
TLB	Genesis	49	14	“ Issachar is a strong beast of burden resting among the saddlebags .
TLB	Genesis	49	15	When he saw how good the countryside was , how pleasant the land , he willingly bent his shoulder to the task and served his masters with vigor .
TLB	Genesis	49	16	“ Dan shall govern his people like any other tribe in Israel .
TLB	Genesis	49	17	He shall be a serpent in the path that bites the horses ’ heels , so that the rider falls off .
TLB	Genesis	49	18	I trust in your salvation , Lord .
TLB	Genesis	49	19	“ A marauding band shall stamp upon Gad , but he shall rob and pursue them !
TLB	Genesis	49	20	“ Asher shall produce rich foods , fit for kings !
TLB	Genesis	49	21	“ Naphtali is a deer let loose , producing lovely fawns .
TLB	Genesis	49	22	“ Joseph is a fruitful tree beside a fountain . His branches shade the wall .
TLB	Genesis	49	23	He has been severely injured by those who shot at him and persecuted him ,
TLB	Genesis	49	24	but their weapons were shattered by the Mighty One of Jacob , the Shepherd , the Rock of Israel .
TLB	Genesis	49	25	May the God of your fathers , the Almighty , bless you with blessings of heaven above and of the earth beneath—blessings of the breasts and of the womb ,
TLB	Genesis	49	26	blessings of the grain and flowers , blessings reaching to the utmost bounds of the everlasting hills . These shall be the blessings upon the head of Joseph who was exiled from his brothers .
TLB	Genesis	49	27	“ Benjamin is a wolf that prowls . He devours his enemies in the morning , and in the evening divides the loot. ”
TLB	Genesis	49	28	So these are the blessings that Israel , their father , blessed his twelve sons with . 29-30 Then he told them , “ Soon I will die . You must bury me with my fathers in the land of Canaan , in the cave in the field of Mach-pelah , facing Mamre—the field Abraham bought from Ephron the Hethite for a burial ground .
TLB	Genesis	49	31	There they buried Abraham and Sarah , his wife ; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah , his wife ; and there I buried Leah .
TLB	Genesis	49	32	It is the cave which my grandfather Abraham purchased from the sons of Heth. ”
TLB	Genesis	49	33	Then , when Jacob had finished his prophecies to his sons , he lay back in the bed , breathed his last , and died .

TLB	Genesis	50	50	Joseph threw himself upon his father ’ s body and wept over him and kissed him .
TLB	Genesis	50	2	Afterwards he commanded his morticians to embalm the body .
TLB	Genesis	50	3	The embalming process required forty days , with a period of national mourning of seventy days .
TLB	Genesis	50	4	Then , when at last the mourning was over , Joseph approached Pharaoh ’ s staff and requested them to speak to Pharaoh on his behalf .
TLB	Genesis	50	5	“ Tell His Majesty , ” he requested them , “ that Joseph ’ s father made Joseph swear to take his body back to the land of Canaan , to bury him there . Ask His Majesty to permit me to go and bury my father ; assure him that I will return promptly. ”
TLB	Genesis	50	6	Pharaoh agreed . “ Go and bury your father , as you promised , ” he said .
TLB	Genesis	50	7	So Joseph went , and a great number of Pharaoh ’ s counselors and assistants—all the senior officers of the land ,
TLB	Genesis	50	8	as well as all of Joseph ’ s people—his brothers and their families . But they left their little children and flocks and herds in the land of Goshen .
TLB	Genesis	50	9	So a very great number of chariots , cavalry , and people accompanied Joseph .
TLB	Genesis	50	10	When they arrived at Atad [ a ] ( meaning “ Threshing Place of Brambles ” ) , beyond the Jordan River , they held a very great and solemn funeral service , with a seven-day period of lamentation for Joseph ’ s father .
TLB	Genesis	50	11	The local residents , the Canaanites , renamed the place Abel-mizraim ( meaning “ Egyptian Mourners ” ) for they said , “ It is a place of very deep mourning by these Egyptians. ” 12-13 So his sons did as Israel commanded them , and carried his body into the land of Canaan and buried it there in the cave of Mach-pelah—the cave Abraham had bought in the field of Ephron the Hethite , close to Mamre .
TLB	Genesis	50	14	Then Joseph returned to Egypt with his brothers and all who had accompanied him to the funeral of his father .
TLB	Genesis	50	15	But now that their father was dead , Joseph ’ s brothers were frightened . “ Now Joseph will pay us back for all the evil we did to him , ” they said . 16-17 So they sent him this message : “ Before he died , your father instructed us to tell you to forgive us for the great evil we did to you . We servants of the God of your father beg you to forgive us. ” When Joseph read the message , he broke down and cried .
TLB	Genesis	50	18	Then his brothers came and fell down before him and said , “ We are your slaves. ”
TLB	Genesis	50	19	But Joseph told them , “ Don ’ t be afraid of me . Am I God , to judge and punish you ?
TLB	Genesis	50	20	As far as I am concerned , God turned into good what you meant for evil , for he brought me to this high position I have today so that I could save the lives of many people .
TLB	Genesis	50	21	No , don ’ t be afraid . Indeed , I myself will take care of you and your families. ” And he spoke very kindly to them , reassuring them .
TLB	Genesis	50	22	So Joseph and his brothers and their families continued to live in Egypt . Joseph was

TLB	Genesis	50	23	He lived to see the birth of his son Ephraim ’ s children , and the children of Machir , Manasseh ’ s son , who played at his feet .
TLB	Genesis	50	24	“ Soon I will die , ” Joseph told his brothers , “ but God will surely come and get you , and bring you out of this land of Egypt and take you back to the land he promised to the descendants of Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob. ”
TLB	Genesis	50	25	Then Joseph made his brothers promise with an oath that they would take his body back with them when they returned to Canaan .
TLB	Genesis	50	26	So Joseph died at the age of

TLB	Exodus	1	1	1-4 This is the list of the sons of Jacob who accompanied him to Egypt , with their families : Reuben , Simeon , Levi , Judah , Issachar , Zebulun , Benjamin , Dan , Naphtali , Gad , Asher .
TLB	Exodus	1	5	So the total number who went with him was seventy ( for Joseph was already there ) .
TLB	Exodus	1	6	In due season Joseph and each of his brothers died , ending that generation .
TLB	Exodus	1	7	Meanwhile , their descendants were very fertile , increasing rapidly in numbers ; there was a veritable population explosion so that they soon became a large nation , and they filled the land of Goshen .
TLB	Exodus	1	8	Then , eventually , a new king came [ a ] to the throne of Egypt who felt no obligation to the descendants of Joseph .
TLB	Exodus	1	9	He told his people , “ These Israelis are becoming dangerous to us because there are so many of them .
TLB	Exodus	1	10	Let ’ s figure out a way to put an end to this . If we don ’ t , and war breaks out , they will join our enemies and fight against us and escape out of the country. ”
TLB	Exodus	1	11	So the Egyptians made slaves of them and put brutal taskmasters over them to wear them down under heavy burdens while building the cities of Pithom and Rameses as supply centers for the king .
TLB	Exodus	1	12	But the more the Egyptians mistreated and oppressed them , the more the Israelis seemed to multiply ! The Egyptians became alarmed 13-14 and made the Hebrew slavery more bitter still , forcing them to toil long and hard in the fields and to carry heavy loads of mortar and brick . 15-16 Then Pharaoh , the king of Egypt , instructed the Hebrew midwives ( their names were Shiphrah and Puah ) to kill all Hebrew boys as soon as they were born , but to let the girls live .
TLB	Exodus	1	17	But the midwives feared God and didn ’ t obey the king—they let the boys live too .
TLB	Exodus	1	18	The king summoned them before him and demanded , “ Why have you disobeyed my command and let the baby boys live ? ”
TLB	Exodus	1	19	“ Sir , ” they told him , “ the Hebrew women have their babies so quickly that we can ’ t get there in time ! They are not slow like the Egyptian women ! ”
TLB	Exodus	1	20	And God blessed the midwives because they were God-fearing women . [ b ] So the people of Israel continued to multiply and to become a mighty nation .

TLB	Exodus	2	2	1-2 There were at this time a Hebrew fellow and girl of the tribe of Levi who married and had a family , and a baby son was born to them . When the baby ’ s mother saw that he was an unusually beautiful baby , she hid him at home for three months .
TLB	Exodus	2	3	Then , when she could no longer hide him , she made a little boat from papyrus reeds , waterproofed it with tar , put the baby in it , and laid it among the reeds along the river ’ s edge .
TLB	Exodus	2	4	The baby ’ s sister watched from a distance to see what would happen to him .
TLB	Exodus	2	5	Well , this is what happened : A princess , one of Pharaoh ’ s daughters , came down to bathe in the river , and as she and her maids were walking along the riverbank , she spied the little boat among the reeds and sent one of the maids to bring it to her .
TLB	Exodus	2	6	When she opened it , there was a baby ! And he was crying . This touched her heart . “ He must be one of the Hebrew children ! ” she said .
TLB	Exodus	2	7	Then the baby ’ s sister approached the princess and asked her , “ Shall I go and find one of the Hebrew women to nurse the baby for you ? ”
TLB	Exodus	2	8	“ Yes , do ! ” the princess replied . So the little girl rushed home and called her mother !
TLB	Exodus	2	9	“ Take this child home and nurse him for me , ” the princess instructed the baby ’ s mother , “ and I will pay you well ! ” So she took him home and nursed him .
TLB	Exodus	2	10	Later , when he was older , she brought him back to the princess and he became her son . She named him Moses ( meaning “ to draw out ” [ a ] ) because she had drawn him out of the water .
TLB	Exodus	2	11	One day , many years later [ b ] when Moses had grown up and become a man , he went out to visit his fellow Hebrews and saw the terrible conditions they were under . During his visit he saw an Egyptian knock a Hebrew to the ground—one of his own Hebrew brothers !
TLB	Exodus	2	12	Moses looked this way and that to be sure no one was watching , then killed the Egyptian and hid his body in the sand .
TLB	Exodus	2	13	The next day as he was out visiting among the Hebrews again , he saw two of them fighting . “ What are you doing , hitting your own Hebrew brother like that ? ” he said to the one in the wrong .
TLB	Exodus	2	14	“ And who are you ? ” the man demanded . “ I suppose you think you are our prince and judge ! And do you plan to kill me as you did that Egyptian yesterday ? ” When Moses realized that his deed was known , he was frightened .
TLB	Exodus	2	15	And sure enough , when Pharaoh heard about it he ordered Moses arrested and executed . But Moses ran away into the land of Midian . As he was sitting there beside a well ,
TLB	Exodus	2	16	seven girls who were daughters of the priest of Midian came to draw water and fill the water troughs for their father ’ s flocks .
TLB	Exodus	2	17	But the shepherds chased the girls away . Moses then came to their aid and rescued them from the shepherds and watered their flocks .
TLB	Exodus	2	18	When they returned to their father , Reuel , he asked , “ How did you get the flocks watered so quickly today ? ”
TLB	Exodus	2	19	“ An Egyptian defended us against the shepherds , ” they told him ; “ he drew water for us and watered the flocks. ”
TLB	Exodus	2	20	“ Well , where is he ? ” their father demanded . “ Did you just leave him there ? Invite him home for supper. ”
TLB	Exodus	2	21	Moses eventually decided to accept Reuel ’ s invitation to live with them , and Reuel gave him one of the girls , Zipporah , as his wife .
TLB	Exodus	2	22	They had a baby named Gershom ( meaning “ foreigner ” ) , for he said , “ I am a stranger in a foreign land. ”
TLB	Exodus	2	23	Several years later the king of Egypt died . The Israelis were groaning beneath their burdens , in deep trouble because of their slavery , and weeping bitterly before the Lord . He heard their cries from heaven ,
TLB	Exodus	2	24	and remembered his promise to Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob to bring their descendants back into the land of Canaan . [ c ]
TLB	Exodus	2	25	Looking down upon them , he knew that the time had come for their rescue .

TLB	Exodus	3	3	One day as Moses was tending the flock of his father-in-law , Jethro , [ a ] the priest of Midian , out at the edge of the desert near Horeb , the mountain of God ,
TLB	Exodus	3	2	suddenly the Angel of Jehovah appeared to him as a flame of fire in a bush . When Moses saw that the bush was on fire and that it didn ’ t burn up , 3-4 he went over to investigate . Then God called out to him , “ Moses ! Moses ! ” “ Who is it ? ” Moses asked .
TLB	Exodus	3	5	“ Don ’ t come any closer , ” God told him . “ Take off your shoes , for you are standing on holy ground .
TLB	Exodus	3	6	I am the God of your fathers—the God of Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob. ” ( Moses covered his face with his hands , for he was afraid to look at God . )
TLB	Exodus	3	7	Then the Lord told him , “ I have seen the deep sorrows of my people in Egypt and have heard their pleas for freedom from their harsh taskmasters .
TLB	Exodus	3	8	I have come to deliver them from the Egyptians and to take them out of Egypt into a good land , a large land , a land ‘ flowing with milk and honey ’ —the land where the Canaanites , Hittites , Amorites , Perizzites , Hivites , and Jebusites live .
TLB	Exodus	3	9	Yes , the wail of the people of Israel has risen to me in heaven , and I have seen the heavy tasks the Egyptians have oppressed them with .
TLB	Exodus	3	10	Now I am going to send you to Pharaoh , to demand that he let you lead my people out of Egypt. ”
TLB	Exodus	3	11	“ But I ’ m not the person for a job like that ! ” Moses exclaimed .
TLB	Exodus	3	12	Then God told him , “ I will certainly be with you , and this is the proof that I am the one who is sending you : When you have led the people out of Egypt , you shall worship God here upon this mountain ! ”
TLB	Exodus	3	13	But Moses asked , “ If I go to the people of Israel and tell them that their fathers ’ God has sent me , they will ask , ‘ Which God are you talking about ? ’ What shall I tell them ? ”
TLB	Exodus	3	14	“ ‘ The Sovereign God , ’ ” [ b ] was the reply . “ Just say , ‘ I Am has sent me ! ’
TLB	Exodus	3	15	Yes , tell them , ‘ Jehovah , [ c ] the God of your ancestors Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , has sent me to you. ’ ( This is my eternal name , to be used throughout all generations . )
TLB	Exodus	3	16	“ Call together all the elders of Israel , ” God instructed him , “ and tell them about Jehovah appearing to you here in this burning bush and that he said to you , ‘ I have visited my people and have seen what is happening to them there in Egypt .
TLB	Exodus	3	17	I promise to rescue them from the drudgery and humiliation they are undergoing , and to take them to the land now occupied by the Canaanites , Hittites , Amorites , Perizzites , Hivites , and Jebusites , a land “ flowing with milk and honey. ’ ”
TLB	Exodus	3	18	The elders of the people of Israel will accept your message . They must go with you to the king of Egypt and tell him , ‘ Jehovah , the God of the Hebrews , has met with us and instructed us to go three days ’ journey into the desert to sacrifice to him . Give us your permission. ’
TLB	Exodus	3	19	“ But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go except under heavy pressure .
TLB	Exodus	3	20	So I will give him all the pressure he needs ! I will destroy Egypt with my miracles , and then at last he will let you go .
TLB	Exodus	3	21	And I will see to it that the Egyptians load you down with gifts when you leave , so that you will by no means go out empty-handed !
TLB	Exodus	3	22	Every woman will ask for jewels , silver , gold , and the finest of clothes from her Egyptian master ’ s wife and neighbors . You will clothe your sons and daughters with the best of Egypt ! ” Footnotes - Exodus 3:1 his father-in-law , Jethro .

TLB	Exodus	4	4	Then the Lord told him , “ Grab it by the tail ! ” He did , and it became a rod in his hand again !
TLB	Exodus	4	2	“ What do you have there in your hand ? ” the Lord asked him . And he replied , “ A shepherd ’ s rod. ”
TLB	Exodus	4	3	“ Throw it down on the ground , ” the Lord told him . So he threw it down—and it became a serpent , and Moses ran from it !
TLB	Exodus	4	5	“ Do that and they will believe you ! ” the Lord told him . “ Then they will realize that Jehovah , the God of their ancestors Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , has really appeared to you .
TLB	Exodus	4	6	Now reach your hand inside your robe , next to your chest. ” And when he did , and took it out again , it was white with leprosy !
TLB	Exodus	4	7	“ Now put it in again , ” Jehovah said . And when he did , and took it out again , it was normal , just as before !
TLB	Exodus	4	8	“ If they don ’ t believe the first miracle , they will the second , ” the Lord said ,
TLB	Exodus	4	9	“ and if they don ’ t accept you after these two signs , then take water from the Nile River and pour it upon the dry land , and it will turn to blood. ”
TLB	Exodus	4	10	But Moses pleaded , “ O Lord , I ’ m just not a good speaker . I never have been , and I ’ m not now , even after you have spoken to me , for I have a speech impediment. ” [ a ]
TLB	Exodus	4	11	“ Who makes mouths ? ” Jehovah asked him . “ Isn ’ t it I , the Lord ? Who makes a man so that he can speak or not speak , see or not see , hear or not hear ?
TLB	Exodus	4	12	Now go ahead and do as I tell you , for I will help you to speak well , and I will tell you what to say. ”
TLB	Exodus	4	13	But Moses said , “ Lord , please ! Send someone else. ”
TLB	Exodus	4	14	Then the Lord became angry . “ All right , ” he said , “ your brother , Aaron , [ b ] is a good speaker . And he is coming here to look for you and will be very happy when he finds you .
TLB	Exodus	4	15	So I will tell you what to tell him , and I will help both of you to speak well , and I will tell you what to do .
TLB	Exodus	4	16	He will be your spokesman to the people . And you will be as God to him , telling him what to say .
TLB	Exodus	4	17	And be sure to take your rod along so that you can perform the miracles I have shown you. ”
TLB	Exodus	4	18	Moses returned home and talked it over with Jethro , his father-in-law . “ With your permission , ” Moses said , “ I will go back to Egypt and visit my relatives . I don ’ t even know whether they are still alive. ” “ Go with my blessing , ” Jethro replied .
TLB	Exodus	4	19	Before Moses left Midian , Jehovah said to him , “ Don ’ t be afraid to return to Egypt , for all those who wanted to kill you are dead. ”
TLB	Exodus	4	20	So Moses took his wife and sons and put them on a donkey , and returned to the land of Egypt , holding tightly to the “ rod of God ” !
TLB	Exodus	4	21	Jehovah told him , “ When you arrive back in Egypt you are to go to Pharaoh and do the miracles I have shown you , but I will make him stubborn so that he will not let the people go .
TLB	Exodus	4	22	Then you are to tell him , ‘ Jehovah says , “ Israel is my eldest son ,
TLB	Exodus	4	23	and I have commanded you to let him go away and worship me , but you have refused : and now see , I will slay your eldest son. ” ’ ”
TLB	Exodus	4	24	As Moses and his family were traveling along and had stopped for the night , Jehovah appeared to Moses and threatened to kill him . 25-26 Then Zipporah his wife took a flint knife and cut off the foreskin of her young son ’ s penis , and threw it against Moses ’ feet , remarking disgustedly , “ What a blood-smeared husband you ’ ve turned out to be ! ” Then God left him alone .
TLB	Exodus	4	27	Now Jehovah said to Aaron , “ Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. ” So Aaron traveled to Mount Horeb , the mountain of God , and met Moses there , and they greeted each other warmly .
TLB	Exodus	4	28	Moses told Aaron what God had said they must do , and what they were to say , and told him about the miracles they must do before Pharaoh .
TLB	Exodus	4	29	So Moses and Aaron returned to Egypt and summoned the elders of the people of Israel to a council meeting .
TLB	Exodus	4	30	Aaron told them what Jehovah had said to Moses , and Moses performed the miracles as they watched .
TLB	Exodus	4	31	Then the elders believed that God had sent them , and when they heard that Jehovah had visited them and had seen their sorrows , and had decided to rescue them , they all rejoiced and bowed their heads and worshiped .

TLB	Exodus	5	5	After this presentation to the elders , Moses and Aaron went to see Pharaoh . They told him , “ We bring you a message from Jehovah , the God of Israel . He says , ‘ Let my people go , for they must make a holy pilgrimage out into the wilderness , for a religious feast , to worship me there. ’ ”
TLB	Exodus	5	2	“ Is that so ? ” retorted Pharaoh . “ And who is Jehovah , that I should listen to him , and let Israel go ? I don ’ t know Jehovah and I will not let Israel go. ”
TLB	Exodus	5	3	But Aaron and Moses persisted . “ The God of the Hebrews has met with us , ” they declared . “ We must take a three days ’ trip into the wilderness and sacrifice there to Jehovah our God ; if we don ’ t obey him , we face death by plague or sword. ” 4-5 “ Who do you think you are , ” Pharaoh shouted , “ distracting the people from their work ? Get back to your jobs ! ”
TLB	Exodus	5	6	That same day Pharaoh sent this order to the taskmasters and officers he had set over the people of Israel : 7-8 “ Don ’ t give the people any more straw for making bricks ! However , don ’ t reduce their production quotas by a single brick , for they obviously don ’ t have enough to do or else they wouldn ’ t be talking about going out into the wilderness and sacrificing to their God .
TLB	Exodus	5	9	Load them with work and make them sweat ; that will teach them to listen to Moses ’ and Aaron ’ s lies ! ” 10-11 So the taskmasters and officers informed the people : “ Pharaoh has given orders to furnish you with no more straw . Go and find it wherever you can ; but you must produce just as many bricks as before ! ”
TLB	Exodus	5	12	So the people scattered everywhere to gather straw .
TLB	Exodus	5	13	The taskmasters were brutal . “ Fulfill your daily quota just as before , ” they kept demanding .
TLB	Exodus	5	14	Then they whipped the Israeli work-crew bosses . “ Why haven ’ t you fulfilled your quotas either yesterday or today ? ” they roared .
TLB	Exodus	5	15	These foremen went to Pharaoh and pleaded with him . “ Don ’ t treat us like this , ” they begged .
TLB	Exodus	5	16	“ We are given no straw and told to make as many bricks as before , and we are beaten for something that isn ’ t our fault—it is the fault of your taskmasters for making such unreasonable demands. ”
TLB	Exodus	5	17	But Pharaoh replied , “ You don ’ t have enough work , or else you wouldn ’ t be saying , ‘ Let us go and sacrifice to Jehovah. ’
TLB	Exodus	5	18	Get back to work . No straw will be given you , and you must deliver the regular quota of bricks. ”
TLB	Exodus	5	19	Then the foremen saw that they were indeed in a bad situation .
TLB	Exodus	5	20	When they met Moses and Aaron waiting for them outside the palace , as they came out from their meeting with Pharaoh ,
TLB	Exodus	5	21	they swore at them . “ May God judge you for making us stink before Pharaoh and his people , ” they said , “ and for giving them an excuse to kill us. ”
TLB	Exodus	5	22	Then Moses went back to the Lord . “ Lord , ” he protested , “ how can you mistreat your own people like this ? Why did you ever send me if you were going to do this to them ?
TLB	Exodus	5	23	Ever since I gave Pharaoh your message , he has only been more and more brutal to them , and you have not delivered them at all ! ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Exodus	6	6	“ Therefore tell the descendants of Israel that I will use my mighty power and perform great miracles to deliver them from slavery and make them free .
TLB	Exodus	6	4	And I entered into a solemn covenant with them ; under its terms I promised to give them and their descendants the land of Canaan where they were living .
TLB	Exodus	6	5	And now I have heard the groanings of the people of Israel , in slavery now to the Egyptians , and I remember my promise .
TLB	Exodus	6	7	And I will accept them as my people and be their God . And they shall know that I am Jehovah their God who has rescued them from the Egyptians . 8-9 I will bring them into the land I promised to give to Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob . It shall belong to my people. ” So Moses told the people what God had said , but they wouldn ’ t listen anymore because they were too dispirited after the tragic consequence of what he had said before . [ a ]
TLB	Exodus	6	10	Now the Lord spoke to Moses again and told him ,
TLB	Exodus	6	11	“ Go back again to Pharaoh and tell him that he must let the people of Israel go. ”
TLB	Exodus	6	12	“ But look , ” Moses objected , “ my own people won ’ t even listen to me anymore ; how can I expect Pharaoh to ? I ’ m no orator ! ”
TLB	Exodus	6	13	Then the Lord ordered Moses and Aaron to return to the people of Israel and to Pharaoh , king of Egypt , demanding that the people be permitted to leave .
TLB	Exodus	6	14	These are the names of the heads of the clans of the various tribes of Israel : The sons of Reuben , Israel ’ s oldest son : Hanoch , Pallu , Hezron , Carmi .

TLB	Exodus	6	19	. - Exodus 6:20 Amram . See v.
TLB	Exodus	6	20	And Amram [ c ] married Jochebed , his father ’ s sister ; and Aaron and Moses were their sons . Amram lived to the age of

TLB	Exodus	7	7	Moses was eighty years old and Aaron eighty-three at this time of their confrontation with Pharaoh .
TLB	Exodus	7	2	Tell Aaron everything I say to you , and he will announce it to Pharaoh , demanding that the people of Israel be allowed to leave Egypt .
TLB	Exodus	7	3	But I will cause Pharaoh to stubbornly refuse , and I will multiply my miracles in the land of Egypt .
TLB	Exodus	7	4	Yet even then Pharaoh won ’ t listen to you ; so I will crush Egypt with a final major disaster and then lead my people out .
TLB	Exodus	7	5	The Egyptians will find out that I am indeed God when I show them my power and force them to let my people go. ”
TLB	Exodus	7	6	So Moses and Aaron did as the Lord commanded them .
TLB	Exodus	7	8	Then the Lord said to Moses and Aaron ,
TLB	Exodus	7	9	“ Pharaoh will demand that you show him a miracle to prove that God has sent you ; when he does , Aaron is to throw down his rod , and it will become a serpent. ”
TLB	Exodus	7	10	So Moses and Aaron went in to see Pharaoh , and performed the miracle , as Jehovah had instructed them—Aaron threw down his rod before Pharaoh and his court , and it became a serpent .
TLB	Exodus	7	11	Then Pharaoh called in his sorcerers—the magicians of Egypt—and they were able to do the same thing with their magical arts !
TLB	Exodus	7	12	Their rods became serpents , too ! But Aaron ’ s serpent swallowed their serpents !
TLB	Exodus	7	13	Pharaoh ’ s heart was still hard and stubborn , and he wouldn ’ t listen , just as the Lord had predicted .
TLB	Exodus	7	14	The Lord pointed this out to Moses , that Pharaoh ’ s heart had been unmoved , and that he would continue to refuse to let the people go .
TLB	Exodus	7	15	“ Nevertheless , ” the Lord said , “ go back to Pharaoh in the morning , to be there as he goes down to the river . Stand beside the riverbank and meet him there , holding in your hand the rod that turned into a serpent .
TLB	Exodus	7	16	Say to him , ‘ Jehovah , the God of the Hebrews , has sent me back to demand that you let his people go to worship him in the wilderness . You wouldn ’ t listen before ,
TLB	Exodus	7	17	and now the Lord says this : “ You are going to find out that I am God . For I have instructed Moses to hit the water of the Nile with his rod , and the river will turn to blood !
TLB	Exodus	7	18	The fish will die and the river will stink , so that the Egyptians will be unwilling to drink it. ” ’ ”
TLB	Exodus	7	19	Then the Lord instructed Moses : “ Tell Aaron to point his rod toward the waters of Egypt : all its rivers , canals , marshes , and reservoirs , and even the water stored in bowls and pots in the homes will turn to blood. ”
TLB	Exodus	7	20	So Moses and Aaron did as the Lord commanded them . As Pharaoh and all of his officials watched , Aaron hit the surface of the Nile with the rod , and the river turned to blood .
TLB	Exodus	7	21	The fish died and the water became so foul that the Egyptians couldn ’ t drink it ; and there was blood throughout the land of Egypt .
TLB	Exodus	7	22	But then the magicians of Egypt used their secret arts and they , too , turned water into blood ; so Pharaoh ’ s heart remained hard and stubborn , and he wouldn ’ t listen to Moses and Aaron , just as the Lord had predicted ,
TLB	Exodus	7	23	and he returned to his palace , unimpressed .
TLB	Exodus	7	24	Then the Egyptians dug wells along the riverbank to get drinking water , for they couldn ’ t drink from the river .

TLB	Exodus	8	8	Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and begged , “ Plead with God to take the frogs away , and I will let the people go and sacrifice to him. ”
TLB	Exodus	8	2	If you refuse , I will send vast hordes of frogs across your land from one border to the other . 3-4 The Nile River will swarm with them , and they will come out into your houses , even into your bedrooms and right into your beds ! Every home in Egypt will be filled with them . They will fill your ovens and your kneading bowls ; you and your people will be immersed in them ! ” ’ ”
TLB	Exodus	8	5	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Instruct Aaron to point the rod toward all the rivers , streams , and pools of Egypt , so that there will be frogs in every corner of the land. ”
TLB	Exodus	8	6	Aaron did , and frogs covered the nation .
TLB	Exodus	8	7	But the magicians did the same with their secret arts , and they , too , caused frogs to come up on the land .
TLB	Exodus	8	9	“ Be so kind as to tell me when you want them to go , ” Moses said , “ and I will pray that the frogs will die at the time you specify , everywhere except in the river. ”
TLB	Exodus	8	10	“ Do it tomorrow , ” Pharaoh said . “ All right , ” Moses replied , “ it shall be as you have said ; then you will know that there is no one like the Lord our God .
TLB	Exodus	8	11	All the frogs will be destroyed , except those in the river. ”
TLB	Exodus	8	12	So Moses and Aaron went out from the presence of Pharaoh , and Moses pleaded with the Lord concerning the frogs he had sent .
TLB	Exodus	8	13	And the Lord did as Moses promised—dead frogs covered the countryside and filled the nation ’ s homes .
TLB	Exodus	8	14	They were piled into great heaps , making a terrible stench throughout the land .
TLB	Exodus	8	15	But when Pharaoh saw that the frogs were gone , he hardened his heart and refused to let the people go , just as the Lord had predicted .
TLB	Exodus	8	16	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Tell Aaron to strike the dust with his rod , and it will become lice , throughout all the land of Egypt. ”
TLB	Exodus	8	17	So Moses and Aaron did as God commanded , and suddenly lice infested the entire nation , covering the Egyptians and their animals .
TLB	Exodus	8	18	Then the magicians tried to do the same thing with their secret arts , but this time they failed .
TLB	Exodus	8	19	“ This is the finger of God , ” they exclaimed to Pharaoh . But Pharaoh ’ s heart was hard and stubborn , and he wouldn ’ t listen to them , just as the Lord had predicted .
TLB	Exodus	8	20	Next the Lord told Moses , “ Get up early in the morning and meet Pharaoh as he comes out to the river to bathe , and say to him , ‘ Jehovah says , “ Let my people go and worship me .
TLB	Exodus	8	21	If you refuse I will send swarms of flies throughout Egypt . Your homes will be filled with them and the ground will be covered with them .
TLB	Exodus	8	22	But it will be very different in the land of Goshen where the Israelis live . No flies will be there ; thus you will know that I am the Lord God of all the earth ,
TLB	Exodus	8	23	for I will make a distinction between your people and my people . All this will happen tomorrow. ” ’ ”
TLB	Exodus	8	24	And Jehovah did as he had said , so that there were terrible swarms of flies in Pharaoh ’ s palace and in every home in Egypt .
TLB	Exodus	8	25	Pharaoh hastily summoned Moses and Aaron and said , “ All right , go ahead and sacrifice to your God , but do it here in the land . Don ’ t go out into the wilderness. ”
TLB	Exodus	8	26	But Moses replied , “ That won ’ t do ! Our sacrifices to God are hated by the Egyptians , and if we do this right here before their eyes , they will kill us .
TLB	Exodus	8	27	We must take a three-day trip into the wilderness and sacrifice there to Jehovah our God , as he commanded us. ”
TLB	Exodus	8	28	“ All right , go ahead , ” Pharaoh replied , “ but don ’ t go too far away . Now , hurry and plead with God for me. ”
TLB	Exodus	8	29	“ Yes , ” Moses said , “ I will ask him to cause the swarms of flies to disappear . But I am warning you that you must never again lie to us by promising to let the people go and then changing your mind. ”
TLB	Exodus	8	30	So Moses went out from Pharaoh and asked the Lord to get rid of the flies . 31-32 And the Lord did as Moses asked and caused the swarms to disappear , so that not one remained . But Pharaoh hardened his heart again and did not let the people go ! The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Exodus	9	9	They will spread like fine dust over all the land of Egypt and cause boils to break out upon people and animals alike , throughout the land. ”
TLB	Exodus	9	2	If you refuse ,
TLB	Exodus	9	3	the power of God will send a deadly plague to destroy your cattle , horses , donkeys , camels , flocks , and herds .
TLB	Exodus	9	4	But the plague will affect only the cattle of Egypt ; none of the Israeli herds and flocks will even be touched ! ’ ”
TLB	Exodus	9	5	The Lord announced that the plague would begin the very next day ,
TLB	Exodus	9	6	and it did . The next morning all the cattle of the Egyptians began dying , but not one of the Israeli herds was even sick .
TLB	Exodus	9	7	Pharaoh sent to see whether it was true that none of the Israeli cattle were dead , yet when he found out that it was so , even then his mind remained unchanged and he refused to let the people go .
TLB	Exodus	9	8	Then Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron , “ Take ashes from the kiln and have Moses toss them into the sky as Pharaoh watches .
TLB	Exodus	9	10	So they took ashes from the kiln and went to Pharaoh ; as he watched , Moses tossed them toward the sky , and they became boils that broke out on men and animals alike throughout all Egypt .
TLB	Exodus	9	11	And the magicians couldn ’ t stand before Moses because of the boils , for the boils appeared upon them too .
TLB	Exodus	9	12	But Jehovah hardened Pharaoh in his stubbornness , so that he refused to listen , just as the Lord had predicted to Moses .
TLB	Exodus	9	13	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Get up early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh and tell him , ‘ Jehovah the God of the Hebrews says , “ Let my people go to worship me .
TLB	Exodus	9	14	This time I am going to send a plague that will really speak to you and to your servants and to all the Egyptian people , and prove to you there is no other God in all the earth .
TLB	Exodus	9	15	I could have killed you all by now ,
TLB	Exodus	9	16	but I didn ’ t , for I wanted to demonstrate my power to you and to all the earth .
TLB	Exodus	9	17	So you still think you are so great , do you , and defy my power , and refuse to let my people go ?
TLB	Exodus	9	18	Well , tomorrow about this time I will send a hailstorm across the nation such as there has never been since Egypt was founded !
TLB	Exodus	9	19	Quick ! Bring in your cattle from the fields , for every man and animal left out in the fields will die beneath the hail ! ” ’ ”
TLB	Exodus	9	20	Some of the Egyptians , terrified by this threat , brought their cattle and slaves in from the fields ;
TLB	Exodus	9	21	but those who had no regard for the word of Jehovah left them out in the storm .
TLB	Exodus	9	22	Then Jehovah said to Moses , “ Point your hand toward heaven and cause the hail to fall throughout all Egypt , upon the people , animals , and trees. ”
TLB	Exodus	9	23	So Moses held out his hand , and the Lord sent thunder and hail and lightning .
TLB	Exodus	9	24	It was terrible beyond description . Never in all the history of Egypt had there been a storm like that .
TLB	Exodus	9	25	All Egypt lay in ruins . Everything left in the fields , men and animals alike , was killed , and the trees were shattered and the crops were destroyed .
TLB	Exodus	9	26	The only spot in all Egypt without hail that day was the land of Goshen where the people of Israel lived .
TLB	Exodus	9	27	Then Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron . “ I finally see my fault , ” he confessed . “ Jehovah is right , and I and my people have been wrong all along .
TLB	Exodus	9	28	Beg God to end this terrifying thunder and hail , and I will let you go at once. ”
TLB	Exodus	9	29	“ All right , ” Moses replied , “ as soon as I have left the city I will spread out my hands to the Lord , and the thunder and hail will stop . This will prove to you that the earth is controlled by Jehovah .
TLB	Exodus	9	30	But as for you and your officials , I know that even yet you will not obey him. ”
TLB	Exodus	9	31	All the flax and barley were knocked down and destroyed ( for the barley was ripe , and the flax was in bloom ) ,
TLB	Exodus	9	32	but the wheat and the emmer were not destroyed , for they were not yet out of the ground .
TLB	Exodus	9	33	So Moses left Pharaoh and went out of the city and lifted his hands to heaven to the Lord , and the thunder and hail stopped , and the rain ceased pouring down .
TLB	Exodus	9	34	When Pharaoh saw this , he and his officials sinned yet more by their stubborn refusal to do what they had promised ;
TLB	Exodus	9	35	so Pharaoh refused to let the people leave , just as the Lord had predicted to Moses . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Exodus	10	10	“ In the name of God I will not let you take your little ones ! ” Pharaoh retorted . “ I can see your plot !
TLB	Exodus	10	2	What stories you can tell your children and grandchildren about the incredible things I am doing in Egypt ! Tell them what fools I made of the Egyptians , and how I proved to you that I am Jehovah. ”
TLB	Exodus	10	3	So Moses and Aaron requested another audience with Pharaoh and told him : “ Jehovah , the God of the Hebrews , asks , ‘ How long will you refuse to submit to me ? Let my people go so they can worship me . 4-5 If you refuse , tomorrow I will cover the entire nation with a thick layer of locusts so that you won ’ t even be able to see the ground , and they will finish destroying everything that escaped the hail .
TLB	Exodus	10	6	They will fill your palace , and the homes of your officials , and all the houses of Egypt . Never in the history of Egypt has there been a plague like this will be ! ’ ” Then Moses stalked out .
TLB	Exodus	10	7	The court officials now came to Pharaoh and asked him , “ Are you going to destroy us completely ? Don ’ t you know even yet that all Egypt lies in ruins ? Let the men go and serve Jehovah their God ! ”
TLB	Exodus	10	8	So Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh . “ All right , go and serve Jehovah your God ! ” he said . “ But just who is it you want to go ? ”
TLB	Exodus	10	9	“ We will go with our sons and daughters , flocks and herds , ” Moses replied . “ We will take everything with us ; for we must all join in the holy pilgrimage. ”
TLB	Exodus	10	11	Never ! You that are men , go and serve Jehovah , for that is what you asked for. ” And they were driven out from Pharaoh ’ s presence .
TLB	Exodus	10	12	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Hold out your hand over the land of Egypt to bring locusts—they will cover the land and eat everything the hail has left. ”
TLB	Exodus	10	13	So Moses lifted his rod and Jehovah caused an east wind to blow all that day and night ; and when it was morning , the east wind had brought the locusts .
TLB	Exodus	10	14	And the locusts covered the land of Egypt from border to border ; it was the worst locust plague in all Egyptian history ; and there will never again be another like it .
TLB	Exodus	10	15	For the locusts covered the face of the earth and blotted out the sun so that the land was darkened ; and they ate every bit of vegetation the hail had left ; there remained not one green thing—not a tree , not a plant throughout all the land of Egypt .
TLB	Exodus	10	16	Then Pharaoh sent an urgent call for Moses and Aaron and said to them , “ I confess my sin against Jehovah your God and against you .
TLB	Exodus	10	17	Forgive my sin only this once , and beg Jehovah your God to take away this deadly plague . I solemnly promise that I will let you go as soon as the locusts are gone. ”
TLB	Exodus	10	18	So Moses went out from Pharaoh and entreated the Lord ,
TLB	Exodus	10	19	and he sent a very strong west wind that blew the locusts out into the Red Sea , so that there remained not one locust in all the land of Egypt !
TLB	Exodus	10	20	But the Lord hardened Pharaoh ’ s heart and he did not let the people go .
TLB	Exodus	10	21	Then Jehovah said to Moses , “ Lift your hands to heaven , and darkness without a ray of light will descend upon the land of Egypt. ”
TLB	Exodus	10	22	So Moses did , and there was thick darkness over all the land for three days .
TLB	Exodus	10	23	During all that time the people scarcely moved—but all the people of Israel had light as usual .
TLB	Exodus	10	24	Then Pharaoh called for Moses and said , “ Go and worship Jehovah—but let your flocks and herds stay here ; you can even take your children with you. ”
TLB	Exodus	10	25	“ No , ” Moses said , “ we must take our flocks and herds for sacrifices and burnt offerings to Jehovah our God .
TLB	Exodus	10	26	Not a hoof shall be left behind ; for we must have sacrifices for the Lord our God , and we do not know what he will choose until we get there. ”
TLB	Exodus	10	27	So the Lord hardened Pharaoh ’ s heart and he would not let them go .
TLB	Exodus	10	28	“ Get out of here and don ’ t let me ever see you again , ” Pharaoh shouted at Moses . “ The day you do , you shall die. ”
TLB	Exodus	10	29	“ Very well , ” Moses replied . “ I will never see you again. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Exodus	11	11	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ I will send just one more disaster on Pharaoh and his land , and after that he will let you go ; in fact , he will be so anxious to get rid of you that he will practically throw you out of the country .
TLB	Exodus	11	2	Tell all the men and women of Israel to ask their Egyptian neighbors for gold and silver jewelry. ”
TLB	Exodus	11	3	( For God caused the Egyptians to be very favorable to the people of Israel , and Moses was a very great man in the land of Egypt and was revered by Pharaoh ’ s officials and the Egyptian people alike . )
TLB	Exodus	11	4	Now Moses announced to Pharaoh , [ a ] “ Jehovah says , ‘ About midnight I will pass through Egypt .
TLB	Exodus	11	5	And all the oldest sons shall die in every family in Egypt , from the oldest child of Pharaoh , heir to his throne , to the oldest child of his lowliest slave ; and even the firstborn of the animals .
TLB	Exodus	11	6	The wail of death will resound throughout the entire land of Egypt ; never before has there been such anguish , and it will never be again .
TLB	Exodus	11	7	“ ‘ But not a dog shall move his tongue against any of the people of Israel , nor shall any of their animals die . Then you will know that Jehovah makes a distinction between Egyptians and Israelis. ’
TLB	Exodus	11	8	All these officials of yours will come running to me , bowing low and begging , ‘ Please leave at once , and take all your people with you. ’ Only then will I go ! ” Then , red-faced with anger , Moses stomped from the palace . [ b ]
TLB	Exodus	11	9	The Lord had told Moses , “ Pharaoh won ’ t listen , and this will give me the opportunity of doing mighty miracles to demonstrate my power. ”
TLB	Exodus	11	10	So , although Moses and Aaron did these miracles right before Pharaoh ’ s eyes , the Lord hardened his heart so that he wouldn ’ t let the people leave the land .

TLB	Exodus	12	12	For I will pass through the land of Egypt tonight and kill all the oldest sons and firstborn male animals in all the land of Egypt , and execute judgment upon all the gods of Egypt—for I am Jehovah .
TLB	Exodus	12	2	“ From now on , this month will be the first and most important of the entire year . 3-4 Annually , on the tenth day of this month ( announce this to all the people of Israel ) each family shall get a lamb [ a ] ( or , if a family is small , let it share the lamb with another small family in the neighborhood ; whether to share in this way depends on the size of the families ) .
TLB	Exodus	12	5	This animal shall be a year-old male , either a sheep or a goat , without any defects .
TLB	Exodus	12	6	“ On the evening of the fourteenth day of this month , all these lambs shall be killed ,
TLB	Exodus	12	7	and their blood shall be placed on the two side-frames of the door of every home and on the panel above the door . Use the blood of the lamb eaten in that home .
TLB	Exodus	12	8	Everyone shall eat roast lamb that night , with unleavened bread and bitter herbs .
TLB	Exodus	12	9	The meat must not be eaten raw or boiled , but roasted , including the head , legs , heart , and liver . [ b ]
TLB	Exodus	12	10	Don ’ t eat any of it the next day ; if all is not eaten that night , burn what is left .
TLB	Exodus	12	11	“ Eat it with your traveling clothes on , prepared for a long journey , wearing your walking shoes and carrying your walking sticks in your hands ; eat it hurriedly . This observance shall be called the Lord ’ s Passover .
TLB	Exodus	12	13	The blood you have placed on the doorposts will be proof that you obey me , and when I see the blood I will pass over you and I will not destroy your firstborn children when I smite the land of Egypt .
TLB	Exodus	12	14	“ You shall celebrate this event each year ( this is a permanent law ) to remind you of this fatal night .
TLB	Exodus	12	15	The celebration shall last seven days . For that entire period you are to eat only bread made without yeast . Anyone who disobeys this rule at any time during the seven days of the celebration shall be excommunicated from Israel .
TLB	Exodus	12	16	On the first day of the celebration , and again on the seventh day , there will be special religious services for the entire congregation , and no work of any kind may be done on those days except the preparation of food .
TLB	Exodus	12	17	“ This annual ‘ Celebration with Unleavened Bread ’ will cause you always to remember today as the day when I brought you out of the land of Egypt ; so it is a law that you must celebrate this day annually , generation after generation .
TLB	Exodus	12	18	Only bread without yeast may be eaten from the evening of the fourteenth day of the month until the evening of the twenty-first day of the month .
TLB	Exodus	12	19	For these seven days there must be no trace of yeast in your homes ; during that time anyone who eats anything that has yeast in it shall be excommunicated from the congregation of Israel . These same rules apply to foreigners who are living among you just as much as to those born in the land .
TLB	Exodus	12	20	Again I repeat , during those days you must not eat anything made with yeast ; serve only yeastless bread. ”
TLB	Exodus	12	21	Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel and said to them , “ Go and get lambs from your flocks , a lamb for one or more families depending upon the number of persons in the families , and kill the lamb so that God will pass over you and not destroy you .
TLB	Exodus	12	22	Drain the lamb ’ s blood into a basin , and then take a cluster of hyssop branches and dip them into the lamb ’ s blood , and strike the hyssop against the lintel above the door and against the two side panels , so that there will be blood upon them , and none of you shall go outside all night .
TLB	Exodus	12	23	“ For Jehovah will pass through the land and kill the Egyptians ; but when he sees the blood upon the panel at the top of the door and on the two side pieces , he will pass over [ c ] that home and not permit the Destroyer to enter and kill your firstborn .
TLB	Exodus	12	24	And remember , this is a permanent law for you and your posterity .
TLB	Exodus	12	25	And when you come into the land that the Lord will give you , just as he promised , and when you are celebrating the Passover ,
TLB	Exodus	12	26	and your children ask , ‘ What does all this mean ? What is this ceremony about ? ’
TLB	Exodus	12	27	you will reply , ‘ It is the celebration of Jehovah ’ s passing over us , for he passed over the homes of the people of Israel , though he killed the Egyptians ; he passed over our houses and did not come in to destroy us. ’ ” And all the people bowed their heads and worshiped .
TLB	Exodus	12	28	So the people of Israel did as Moses and Aaron had commanded .
TLB	Exodus	12	29	And that night , at midnight , Jehovah killed all the firstborn sons in the land of Egypt , from Pharaoh ’ s oldest son to the oldest son of the captive in the dungeon ; also all the firstborn of the cattle .
TLB	Exodus	12	30	Then Pharaoh and his officials and all the people of Egypt got up in the night ; and there was bitter crying throughout all the land of Egypt , for there was not a house where someone had not died .
TLB	Exodus	12	31	And Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron during the night and said , “ Leave us ; please go away , all of you ; go and serve Jehovah as you said .
TLB	Exodus	12	32	Take your flocks and herds and be gone ; and oh , give me a blessing as you go. ” [ d ]
TLB	Exodus	12	33	And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people of Israel , to get them out of the land as quickly as possible . For they said , “ We are as good as dead. ”
TLB	Exodus	12	34	The Israelis took with them their bread dough without yeast , and bound their kneading troughs into their spare clothes , and carried them on their shoulders .
TLB	Exodus	12	35	And the people of Israel did as Moses said and asked the Egyptians for silver and gold jewelry and for clothing .
TLB	Exodus	12	36	And the Lord gave the Israelis favor with the Egyptians , so that they gave them whatever they wanted . And the Egyptians were practically stripped of everything they owned !
TLB	Exodus	12	37	That night the people of Israel left Rameses and started for Succoth ; there were six hundred thousand of them , besides all the women and children , going on foot .
TLB	Exodus	12	38	People of various sorts [ e ] went with them ; and there were flocks and herds—a vast exodus of cattle .
TLB	Exodus	12	39	When they stopped to eat , they baked bread from the yeastless dough they had brought along . It was yeastless because the people were pushed out of Egypt and didn ’ t have time to wait for bread to rise to take with them on the trip . 40-41 The sons of Jacob and their descendants had lived in Egypt
TLB	Exodus	12	430	years , and it was on the last day of the 430th year that all of Jehovah ’ s people left the land .
TLB	Exodus	12	42	This night was selected by the Lord to bring his people out from the land of Egypt ; so the same night was selected as the date of the annual celebration of God ’ s deliverance .
TLB	Exodus	12	43	Then Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron , “ These are the rules concerning the observance of the Passover . No foreigners shall eat the lamb ,
TLB	Exodus	12	44	but any slave who has been purchased may eat it if he has been circumcised .
TLB	Exodus	12	45	A hired servant or a visiting foreigner may not eat of it .
TLB	Exodus	12	46	You shall , all of you who eat each lamb , eat it together in one house , and not carry it outside ; and you shall not break any of its bones .
TLB	Exodus	12	47	All the congregation of Israel shall observe this memorial at the same time .
TLB	Exodus	12	48	“ As to foreigners , if they are living with you and want to observe the Passover with you , let all the males be circumcised , and then they may come and celebrate with you—then they shall be just as though they had been born among you ; but no uncircumcised person shall ever eat the lamb .
TLB	Exodus	12	49	The same law applies to those born in Israel and to foreigners living among you. ”
TLB	Exodus	12	50	So the people of Israel followed all of Jehovah ’ s instructions to Moses and Aaron .
TLB	Exodus	12	51	That very day the Lord brought out the people of Israel from the land of Egypt , wave after wave of them crossing the border . [ f ] Footnotes - Exodus 12:3 The Hebrew word here translated “ lamb ” can also mean “ kid ” —a baby goat . - Exodus 12:9 liver , literally , “ inner parts. ” - Exodus 12:23 he will pass over , or “ he will pause at the door of. ” - Exodus 12:32 give me a blessing as you go , literally , “ say farewell to me forever. ” - Exodus 12:38 People of various sorts , literally , “ a mixed multitude. ” The meaning is not clear . - Exodus 12:51 wave after wave of them crossing the border , or “ all of the communities of them. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Exodus	13	13	A firstborn donkey may be purchased back from the Lord in exchange for a lamb or baby goat ; but if you decide not to trade , the donkey shall be killed . However , you must buy back your firstborn sons .
TLB	Exodus	13	3	Then Moses said to the people , “ This is a day to remember forever—the day of leaving Egypt and your slavery ; for the Lord has brought you out with mighty miracles . Now remember , during the annual celebration of this event you are to use no yeast ; don ’ t even have any in your homes . 4-5 Celebrate this day of your exodus , at the end of March [ b ] each year , when Jehovah brings you into the land of the Canaanites , Hittites , Amorites , Hivites , and Jebusites—the land he promised your fathers , a land ‘ flowing with milk and honey. ’ 6-7 For seven days you shall eat only bread without yeast , and there must be no yeast in your homes or anywhere within the borders of your land ! Then , on the seventh day , a great feast to the Lord shall be held .
TLB	Exodus	13	8	“ During those celebration days each year you must explain to your children why you are celebrating—it is a celebration of what the Lord did for you when you left Egypt .
TLB	Exodus	13	9	This annual memorial week will brand you as his own unique people , just as though he had branded his mark of ownership upon your hands or your forehead .
TLB	Exodus	13	10	“ So celebrate the event annually in late March . [ c ]
TLB	Exodus	13	11	And remember , when the Lord brings you into the land he promised to your ancestors long ago , where the Canaanites are now living ,
TLB	Exodus	13	12	all firstborn sons and firstborn male animals belong to the Lord , and you shall give them to him .
TLB	Exodus	13	14	“ And in the future , when your children ask you , ‘ What is this all about ? ’ you shall tell them , ‘ With mighty miracles Jehovah brought us out of Egypt from our slavery .
TLB	Exodus	13	15	Pharaoh wouldn ’ t let us go , so Jehovah killed all the firstborn males throughout the land of Egypt , both of men and animals ; that is why we now give all the firstborn males to the Lord—except that all the eldest sons are always bought back. ’
TLB	Exodus	13	16	Again I say , this celebration shall identify you as God ’ s people , just as much as if his brand of ownership were placed upon your foreheads . It is a reminder that the Lord brought us out of Egypt with great power. ” 17-18 So at last Pharaoh let the people go . God did not lead them through the land of the Philistines , although that was the most direct route from Egypt to the Promised Land . The reason was that God felt the people might become discouraged by having to fight their way through , even though they had left Egypt armed ; he thought they might return to Egypt . Instead , God led them along a route through the Red Sea wilderness .
TLB	Exodus	13	19	Moses took the bones of Joseph with them , for Joseph had made the sons of Israel vow before God that they would take his bones with them when God led them out of Egypt—as he was sure God would .
TLB	Exodus	13	20	Leaving Succoth , they camped in Etham at the edge of the wilderness .
TLB	Exodus	13	21	The Lord guided them by a pillar of cloud during the daytime and by a pillar of fire at night . So they could travel either by day or night .
TLB	Exodus	13	22	The cloud and fire were never out of sight .

TLB	Exodus	14	14	The Lord will fight for you , and you won ’ t need to lift a finger ! ” [ a ]
TLB	Exodus	14	2	“ Tell the people to turn toward Piha-hiroth between Migdol and the sea , opposite Baal-zephon , and to camp there along the shore .
TLB	Exodus	14	3	For Pharaoh will think , ‘ Those Israelites are trapped now , between the desert and the sea ! ’
TLB	Exodus	14	4	And once again I will harden Pharaoh ’ s heart and he will chase after you . I have planned this to gain great honor and glory over Pharaoh and all his armies , and the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord. ” So they camped where they were told .
TLB	Exodus	14	5	When word reached the king of Egypt that the Israelis were not planning to return to Egypt after three days , but to keep on going , Pharaoh and his staff became bold again . “ What is this we have done , letting all these slaves get away ? ” they asked .
TLB	Exodus	14	6	So Pharaoh led the chase in his chariot ,
TLB	Exodus	14	7	followed by the pick of Egypt ’ s chariot corps—600 chariots in all—and other chariots driven by Egyptian officers .
TLB	Exodus	14	8	He pursued the people of Israel , for they had taken much of the wealth of Egypt with them .
TLB	Exodus	14	9	Pharaoh ’ s entire cavalry—horses , chariots , and charioteers—was used in the chase ; and the Egyptian army overtook the people of Israel as they were camped beside the shore near Piha-hiroth , across from Baal-zephon .
TLB	Exodus	14	10	As the Egyptian army approached , the people of Israel saw them far in the distance , speeding after them , and they were terribly frightened and cried out to the Lord to help them .
TLB	Exodus	14	11	And they turned against Moses , whining , “ Have you brought us out here to die in the desert because there were not enough graves for us in Egypt ? Why did you make us leave Egypt ?
TLB	Exodus	14	12	Isn ’ t this what we told you , while we were slaves , to leave us alone ? We said it would be better to be slaves to the Egyptians than dead in the wilderness. ”
TLB	Exodus	14	13	But Moses told the people , “ Don ’ t be afraid . Just stand where you are and watch , and you will see the wonderful way the Lord will rescue you today . The Egyptians you are looking at—you will never see them again .
TLB	Exodus	14	15	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Quit praying and get the people moving ! Forward , march !
TLB	Exodus	14	16	Use your rod—hold it out over the water , and the sea will open up a path before you , and all the people of Israel shall walk through on dry ground !
TLB	Exodus	14	17	I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians , and they will go in after you and you will see the honor I will get in defeating Pharaoh and all his armies , chariots , and horsemen .
TLB	Exodus	14	18	And all Egypt shall know that I am Jehovah. ”
TLB	Exodus	14	19	Then the Angel of God , who was leading the people of Israel , moved the cloud around behind them ,
TLB	Exodus	14	20	and it stood between the people of Israel and the Egyptians . And that night , as it changed to a pillar of fire , it gave darkness to the Egyptians but light to the people of Israel ! So the Egyptians couldn ’ t find the Israelis !
TLB	Exodus	14	21	Meanwhile , Moses stretched his rod over the sea , and the Lord opened up a path through the sea , with walls of water on each side ; and a strong east wind blew all that night , drying the sea bottom .
TLB	Exodus	14	22	So the people of Israel walked through the sea on dry ground !
TLB	Exodus	14	23	Then the Egyptians followed them between the walls of water along the bottom of the sea—all of Pharaoh ’ s horses , chariots , and horsemen .
TLB	Exodus	14	24	But in the early morning Jehovah looked down from the cloud of fire upon the array of the Egyptians , and began to harass them .
TLB	Exodus	14	25	Their chariot wheels began coming off , so that their chariots scraped along the dry ground . “ Let ’ s get out of here , ” the Egyptians yelled . “ Jehovah is fighting for them and against us. ”
TLB	Exodus	14	26	When all the Israelites were on the other side , [ b ] the Lord said to Moses , “ Stretch out your hand again over the sea , so that the waters will come back over the Egyptians and their chariots and horsemen. ”
TLB	Exodus	14	27	Moses did , and the sea returned to normal beneath the morning light . The Egyptians tried to flee , but the Lord drowned them in the sea .
TLB	Exodus	14	28	The water covered the path and the chariots and horsemen . And of all the army of Pharaoh that chased after Israel through the sea , not one remained alive .
TLB	Exodus	14	29	The people of Israel had walked through on dry land , and the waters had been walled up on either side of them .
TLB	Exodus	14	30	Thus Jehovah saved Israel that day from the Egyptians ; and the people of Israel saw the Egyptians dead , washed up on the seashore .
TLB	Exodus	14	31	When the people of Israel saw the mighty miracle the Lord had done for them against the Egyptians , they were afraid and revered the Lord , and believed in him and in his servant Moses .

TLB	Exodus	15	15	The leaders of Edom are appalled , The mighty men of Moab tremble ; All the people of Canaan melt with fear .
TLB	Exodus	15	2	The Lord is my strength , my song , and my salvation . He is my God , and I will praise him . He is my father ’ s God—I will exalt him .
TLB	Exodus	15	3	The Lord is a warrior— Yes , Jehovah is his name .
TLB	Exodus	15	4	He has overthrown Pharaoh ’ s chariots and armies , Drowning them in the sea . The famous Egyptian captains are dead beneath the waves .
TLB	Exodus	15	5	The water covers them . They went down into the depths like a stone .
TLB	Exodus	15	6	Your right hand , O Lord , is glorious in power ; It dashes the enemy to pieces .
TLB	Exodus	15	7	In the greatness of your majesty You overthrew all those who rose against you . You sent forth your anger , and it consumed them as fire consumes straw .
TLB	Exodus	15	8	At the blast of your breath The waters divided ! They stood as solid walls to hold the seas apart .
TLB	Exodus	15	9	The enemy said , “ I will chase after them , Catch up with them , destroy them . I will cut them apart with my sword And divide the captured booty. ”
TLB	Exodus	15	10	But God blew with his wind , and the sea covered them . They sank as lead in the mighty waters .
TLB	Exodus	15	11	Who else is like the Lord among the gods ? Who is glorious in holiness like him ? Who is so awesome in splendor , A wonder-working God ?
TLB	Exodus	15	12	You reached out your hand and the earth swallowed them .
TLB	Exodus	15	13	You have led the people you redeemed . But in your loving-kindness You have guided them wonderfully To your holy land .
TLB	Exodus	15	14	The nations heard what happened , and they trembled . Fear has gripped the people of Philistia .
TLB	Exodus	15	16	Terror and dread have overcome them . O Lord , because of your great power they won ’ t attack us ! Your people whom you purchased Will pass by them in safety .
TLB	Exodus	15	17	You will bring them in and plant them on your mountain , Your own homeland , Lord— The sanctuary you made for them to live in .
TLB	Exodus	15	18	Jehovah shall reign forever and forever .
TLB	Exodus	15	19	The horses of Pharaoh , his horsemen , and his chariots Tried to follow through the sea ; But the Lord let down the walls of water on them While the people of Israel walked through on dry land .
TLB	Exodus	15	20	Then Miriam the prophetess , the sister of Aaron , took a tambourine and led the women in dances .
TLB	Exodus	15	21	And Miriam sang this song : Sing to the Lord , for he has triumphed gloriously . The horse and rider have been drowned in the sea .
TLB	Exodus	15	22	Then Moses led the people of Israel on from the Red Sea , and they moved out into the wilderness of Shur and were there three days without water .
TLB	Exodus	15	23	Arriving at Marah , they couldn ’ t drink the water because it was bitter ( that is why the place was called Marah , meaning “ bitter ” ) .
TLB	Exodus	15	24	Then the people turned against Moses . “ Must we die of thirst ? ” they demanded .
TLB	Exodus	15	25	Moses pleaded with the Lord to help them , and the Lord showed him a tree to throw into the water , and the water became sweet . It was there at Marah that the Lord laid before them the following conditions , to test their commitment to him :
TLB	Exodus	15	26	“ If you will listen to the voice of the Lord your God , and obey it , and do what is right , then I will not make you suffer the diseases I sent on the Egyptians , for I am the Lord who heals you. ”
TLB	Exodus	15	27	And they came to Elim where there were twelve springs and seventy palm trees ; and they camped there beside the springs . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Exodus	16	16	Jehovah has said for everyone to gather as much as is needed for his household—about two quarts [ a ] for each person. ”
TLB	Exodus	16	2	There , too , the people spoke bitterly against Moses and Aaron .
TLB	Exodus	16	3	“ Oh , that we were back in Egypt , ” they moaned , “ and that the Lord had killed us there ! For there we had plenty to eat . But now you have brought us into this wilderness to kill us with starvation. ”
TLB	Exodus	16	4	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Look , I ’ m going to rain down food from heaven for them . Everyone can go out each day and gather as much food as he needs . And I will test them in this , to see whether they will follow my instructions or not .
TLB	Exodus	16	5	Tell them to gather twice as much as usual on the sixth day of each week. ”
TLB	Exodus	16	6	Then Moses and Aaron called a meeting of all the people of Israel and told them , “ This evening you will realize that it was the Lord who brought you out of the land of Egypt . 7-9 In the morning you will see more of his glory ; for he has heard your complaints against him ( for you aren ’ t really complaining against us—who are we ? ) . The Lord will give you meat to eat in the evening , and bread in the morning . Come now before Jehovah and hear his reply to your complaints. ”
TLB	Exodus	16	10	So Aaron called them together and suddenly , out toward the wilderness , from within the guiding cloud , there appeared the awesome glory of Jehovah . 11-12 And Jehovah said to Moses , “ I have heard their complaints . Tell them , ‘ In the evening you will have meat and in the morning you will be stuffed with bread , and you shall know that I am Jehovah your God. ’ ”
TLB	Exodus	16	13	That evening vast numbers of quail arrived and covered the camp , and in the morning the desert all around the camp was wet with dew ;
TLB	Exodus	16	14	and when the dew disappeared later in the morning it left thin white flakes that covered the ground like frost .
TLB	Exodus	16	15	When the people of Israel saw it they asked each other , “ What is it ? ” And Moses told them , “ It is the food Jehovah has given you .
TLB	Exodus	16	17	So the people of Israel went out and gathered it—some getting more and some less before it melted on the ground ,
TLB	Exodus	16	18	and there was just enough for everyone . Those who gathered more had nothing left over and those who gathered little had no lack ! Each home had just enough .
TLB	Exodus	16	19	And Moses told them , “ Don ’ t leave it overnight. ”
TLB	Exodus	16	20	But of course some of them wouldn ’ t listen , and left it until morning ; and when they looked , it was full of maggots and had a terrible odor ; and Moses was very angry with them .
TLB	Exodus	16	21	So they gathered the food morning by morning , each home according to its need ; and when the sun became hot upon the ground , the food melted and disappeared .
TLB	Exodus	16	22	On the sixth day there was twice as much as usual on the ground—four quarts instead of two ; the leaders of the people came and asked Moses why this had happened .
TLB	Exodus	16	23	And he told them , “ Because the Lord has appointed tomorrow as a day of seriousness and rest , a holy Sabbath to the Lord when we must refrain from doing our daily tasks . So cook as much as you want to today , and keep what is left for tomorrow. ”
TLB	Exodus	16	24	And the next morning the food was wholesome and good , without maggots or odor .
TLB	Exodus	16	25	Moses said , “ This is your food for today , for today is the Sabbath to Jehovah and there will be no food on the ground today .
TLB	Exodus	16	26	Gather the food for six days , but the seventh is a Sabbath , and there will be none there for you on that day. ”
TLB	Exodus	16	27	But some of the people went out anyway to gather food , even though it was the Sabbath , but there wasn ’ t any . 28-29 “ How long will these people refuse to obey ? ” the Lord asked Moses . “ Don ’ t they realize that I am giving them twice as much on the sixth day , so that there will be enough for two days ? For the Lord has given you the seventh day as a day of Sabbath rest ; stay in your tents and don ’ t go out to pick up food from the ground that day. ”
TLB	Exodus	16	30	So the people rested on the seventh day .
TLB	Exodus	16	31	And the food became known as “ manna ” ( meaning “ What is it ? ” ) ; it was white , like coriander seed , and flat , and tasted like honey bread .
TLB	Exodus	16	32	Then Moses gave them this further instruction from the Lord : they were to take two quarts of it to be kept as a museum specimen forever , so that later generations could see the bread the Lord had fed them in the wilderness , when he brought them from Egypt .
TLB	Exodus	16	33	Moses told Aaron to get a container and put two quarts of manna in it and to keep it in a sacred place from generation to generation .
TLB	Exodus	16	34	Aaron did this , just as the Lord had instructed Moses , and eventually it was kept in the Ark in the Tabernacle .
TLB	Exodus	16	35	So the people of Israel ate the manna forty years until they arrived in the land of Canaan , where there were crops to eat .
TLB	Exodus	16	36	The omer—the container used to measure the manna—held about two quarts ; it is approximately a tenth of a bushel . Footnotes - Exodus 16:16 about two quarts , literally , “ an omer. ” The exact measure is not known . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Exodus	17	17	Now , at God ’ s command , the people of Israel left the Sihn Desert , going by easy stages to Rephidim . But upon arrival , there was no water !
TLB	Exodus	17	2	So once more the people growled and complained to Moses . “ Give us water ! ” they wailed . “ Quiet ! ” Moses commanded . “ Are you trying to test God ’ s patience with you ? ”
TLB	Exodus	17	3	But , tormented by thirst , they cried out , “ Why did you ever take us out of Egypt ? Why did you bring us here to die , with our children and cattle too ? ”
TLB	Exodus	17	4	Then Moses pleaded with Jehovah . “ What shall I do ? For they are almost ready to stone me. ” 5-6 Then Jehovah said to Moses , “ Take the elders of Israel with you and lead the people out to Mount Horeb . I will meet you there at the rock . Strike it with your rod [ a ] —the same one you struck the Nile with—and water will come pouring out , enough for everyone ! ” Moses did as he was told , and the water gushed out !
TLB	Exodus	17	7	Moses named the place Massah ( meaning “ tempting Jehovah to slay us ” ) , and sometimes they referred to it as Meribah ( meaning “ argument ” and “ strife ! ” ) —for it was there that the people of Israel argued against God and tempted him to slay them [ b ] by saying , “ Is Jehovah going to take care of us or not ? ”
TLB	Exodus	17	8	But now the warriors of Amalek came to fight against the people of Israel at Rephidim .
TLB	Exodus	17	9	Moses instructed Joshua to issue a call to arms to the Israelites , to fight the army of Amalek . “ Tomorrow , ” Moses told him , “ I will stand at the top of the hill , with the rod of God in my hand ! ”
TLB	Exodus	17	10	So Joshua and his men went out to fight the army of Amalek . Meanwhile Moses , Aaron , and Hur [ c ] went to the top of the hill .
TLB	Exodus	17	11	And as long as Moses held up the rod in his hands , Israel was winning ; but whenever he rested his arms at his sides , the soldiers of Amalek were winning .
TLB	Exodus	17	12	Moses ’ arms finally became too tired to hold up the rod any longer ; so Aaron and Hur rolled a stone for him to sit on , and they stood on each side , holding up his hands until sunset .
TLB	Exodus	17	13	As a result , Joshua and his troops crushed the army of Amalek , putting them to the sword .
TLB	Exodus	17	14	Then the Lord instructed Moses , “ Write this into a permanent record , to be remembered forever , and announce to Joshua that I will utterly blot out every trace of Amalek. ” 15-16 Moses built an altar there and called it “ Jehovah-nissi ” ( meaning “ Jehovah is my flag ” ) . “ Raise the banner of the Lord ! ” Moses said . “ For the Lord will be at war with Amalek generation after generation. ” Footnotes - Exodus 17:5 Strike it with your rod , implied . - Exodus 17:7 to slay them , implied . - Exodus 17:10 Hur . Hur was a man of Judah , of the family of Hezron , house of Caleb (

TLB	Exodus	18	18	“ You ’ re going to wear yourself out—and if you do , what will happen to the people ? Moses , this job is too heavy a burden for you to try to handle all by yourself . 19-20 Now listen , and let me give you a word of advice , and God will bless you : Be these people ’ s lawyer—their representative before God—bringing him their questions to decide ; you will tell them his decisions , teaching them God ’ s laws , and showing them the principles of godly living .
TLB	Exodus	18	2	Then Jethro took Moses ’ wife , Zipporah , to him ( for he had sent her home ) ,
TLB	Exodus	18	3	along with Moses ’ two sons , Gershom ( meaning “ foreigner , ” for Moses said when he was born , “ I have been wandering in a foreign land ” )
TLB	Exodus	18	4	and Eliezer ( meaning “ God is my help , ” for Moses said at his birth , “ The God of my fathers was my helper and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh ” ) . 5-6 They arrived while Moses and the people were camped at Mount Sinai . [ a ] “ Jethro , your father-in-law , has come to visit you , ” Moses was told , “ and he has brought your wife and your two sons. ”
TLB	Exodus	18	7	Moses went out to meet his father-in-law and greeted him warmly ; they asked about each other ’ s health and then went into Moses ’ tent to talk further .
TLB	Exodus	18	8	Moses related to his father-in-law all that had been happening and what the Lord had done to Pharaoh and the Egyptians in order to deliver Israel , and all the problems there had been along the way , and how the Lord had delivered his people from all of them .
TLB	Exodus	18	9	Jethro was very happy about everything the Lord had done for Israel , and about his bringing them out of Egypt .
TLB	Exodus	18	10	“ Bless the Lord , ” Jethro said , “ for he has saved you from the Egyptians and from Pharaoh , and has rescued Israel .
TLB	Exodus	18	11	I know now that the Lord is greater than any other god because he delivered his people from the proud and cruel Egyptians. ”
TLB	Exodus	18	12	Jethro offered sacrifices to God , [ b ] and afterwards Aaron and the leaders of Israel came to meet Jethro , and they all ate the sacrificial meal together before the Lord .
TLB	Exodus	18	13	The next day Moses sat as usual to hear the people ’ s complaints against each other , from morning to evening .
TLB	Exodus	18	14	When Moses ’ father-in-law saw how much time this was taking , he said , “ Why are you trying to do all this alone , with people standing here all day long to get your help ? ” 15-16 “ Well , because the people come to me with their disputes , to ask for God ’ s decisions , ” Moses told him . “ I am their judge , deciding who is right and who is wrong , and instructing them in God ’ s ways . I apply the laws of God to their particular disputes. ”
TLB	Exodus	18	17	“ It ’ s not right ! ” his father-in-law exclaimed .
TLB	Exodus	18	21	“ Find some capable , godly , honest men who hate bribes , and appoint them as judges , one judge for each
TLB	Exodus	18	1000	people ; he in turn will have ten judges under him , each in charge of a hundred ; and under each of them will be two judges , each responsible for the affairs of fifty people ; and each of these will have five judges beneath him , each counseling ten persons .
TLB	Exodus	18	22	Let these men be responsible to serve the people with justice at all times . Anything that is too important or complicated can be brought to you . But the smaller matters they can take care of themselves . That way it will be easier for you because you will share the burden with them .
TLB	Exodus	18	23	If you follow this advice , and if the Lord agrees , you will be able to endure the pressures , and there will be peace and harmony in the camp. ”
TLB	Exodus	18	24	Moses listened to his father-in-law ’ s advice and followed this suggestion .
TLB	Exodus	18	25	He chose able men from all over Israel and made them judges over the people—thousands , hundreds , fifties , and tens .
TLB	Exodus	18	26	They were constantly available to administer justice . They brought the hard cases to Moses but judged the smaller matters themselves .
TLB	Exodus	18	27	Soon afterwards Moses let his father-in-law return to his own land .

TLB	Exodus	19	19	As the trumpet blast grew louder and louder , Moses spoke and God thundered his reply .
TLB	Exodus	19	4	‘ You have seen what I did to the Egyptians , and how I brought you to myself as though on eagles ’ wings .
TLB	Exodus	19	5	Now if you will obey me and keep your part of my contract with you , you shall be my own little flock from among all the nations of the earth ; for all the earth is mine .
TLB	Exodus	19	6	And you shall be a kingdom of priests to God , a holy nation. ’ ”
TLB	Exodus	19	7	Moses returned from the mountain and called together the leaders of the people and told them what the Lord had said .
TLB	Exodus	19	8	They all responded in unison , “ We will certainly do everything he asks of us. ” Moses reported the words of the people to the Lord .
TLB	Exodus	19	9	Then he said to Moses , “ I am going to come to you in the form of a dark cloud , so that the people themselves can hear me when I talk with you , and then they will always believe you .
TLB	Exodus	19	10	Go down now and see that the people are ready for my visit . Sanctify them today and tomorrow , and have them wash their clothes .
TLB	Exodus	19	11	Then , the day after tomorrow , I will come down upon Mount Sinai as all the people watch .
TLB	Exodus	19	12	Set boundary lines the people may not pass , and tell them , ‘ Beware ! Do not go up into the mountain or even touch its boundaries ; whoever does shall die—
TLB	Exodus	19	13	no hand shall touch him , but he shall be stoned or shot to death with arrows , whether man or animal. ’ Stay away from the mountain entirely until you hear a ram ’ s horn sounding one long blast ; then gather at the foot of the mountain ! ”
TLB	Exodus	19	14	So Moses went down to the people and sanctified them and they washed their clothing .
TLB	Exodus	19	15	He told them , “ Get ready for God ’ s appearance two days from now , and do not have sexual intercourse with your wives. ”
TLB	Exodus	19	16	On the morning of the third day there was a terrific thunder and lightning storm , and a huge cloud came down upon the mountain , and there was a long , loud blast as from a ram ’ s horn ; and all the people trembled .
TLB	Exodus	19	17	Moses led them out from the camp to meet God , and they stood at the foot of the mountain .
TLB	Exodus	19	18	All Mount Sinai was covered with smoke because Jehovah descended upon it in the form of fire ; the smoke billowed into the sky as from a furnace , and the whole mountain shook with a violent earthquake .
TLB	Exodus	19	20	So the Lord came down upon the top of Mount Sinai and called Moses up to the top of the mountain , and Moses ascended to God .
TLB	Exodus	19	21	But the Lord told Moses , “ Go back down and warn the people not to cross the boundaries . They must not come up here to try to see God , for if they do , many of them will die .
TLB	Exodus	19	22	Even the priests on duty [ a ] must sanctify themselves , or else I will destroy them. ”
TLB	Exodus	19	23	“ But the people won ’ t come up into the mountain ! ” Moses protested . “ You told them not to ! You told me to set boundaries around the mountain and to declare it off limits because it is reserved for God. ”
TLB	Exodus	19	24	But Jehovah said , “ Go down and bring Aaron back with you , and don ’ t let the priests and the people break across the boundaries to try to come up here , or I will punish them. ”
TLB	Exodus	19	25	So Moses went down to the people and told them what God had said . Footnotes - Exodus 19:22 the priests on duty , literally , “ the priests who come near to Jehovah. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Exodus	20	20	“ Don ’ t be afraid , ” Moses told them , “ for God has come in this way to show you his awesome power , so that from now on you will be afraid to sin against him ! ”
TLB	Exodus	20	2	“ I am Jehovah your God who liberated you from your slavery in Egypt .
TLB	Exodus	20	3	“ You may worship no other god than me .
TLB	Exodus	20	4	“ You shall not make yourselves any idols : no images of animals , birds , or fish .
TLB	Exodus	20	5	You must never bow or worship it in any way ; for I , the Lord your God , am very possessive . I will not share your affection with any other god ! “ And when I punish people for their sins , the punishment continues upon the children , grandchildren , and great-grandchildren of those who hate me ;
TLB	Exodus	20	6	but I lavish my love upon thousands of those who love me and obey my commandments .
TLB	Exodus	20	7	“ You shall not use the name of Jehovah your God irreverently , [ a ] nor use it to swear to a falsehood . You will not escape punishment if you do .
TLB	Exodus	20	8	“ Remember to observe the Sabbath as a holy day .
TLB	Exodus	20	9	Six days a week are for your daily duties and your regular work ,
TLB	Exodus	20	10	but the seventh day is a day of Sabbath rest before the Lord your God . On that day you are to do no work of any kind , nor shall your son , daughter , or slaves—whether men or women—or your cattle or your house guests .
TLB	Exodus	20	11	For in six days the Lord made the heaven , earth , and sea , and everything in them , and rested the seventh day ; so he blessed the Sabbath day and set it aside for rest . [ b ]
TLB	Exodus	20	12	“ Honor your father and mother , that you may have a long , good life in the land the Lord your God will give you .

TLB	Exodus	20	17	“ You must not be envious of your neighbor ’ s house , or want to sleep with his wife , or want to own his slaves , oxen , donkeys , or anything else he has. ”
TLB	Exodus	20	18	All the people saw the lightning and the smoke billowing from the mountain , and heard the thunder and the long , frightening trumpet blast ; and they stood at a distance , shaking with fear .
TLB	Exodus	20	19	They said to Moses , “ You tell us what God says and we will obey , but don ’ t let God speak directly to us , or it will kill us. ”
TLB	Exodus	20	21	As the people stood in the distance , Moses entered into the deep darkness where God was .
TLB	Exodus	20	22	And the Lord told Moses to be his spokesman to the people of Israel . “ You are witnesses to the fact that I have made known my will to you from heaven .
TLB	Exodus	20	23	Remember , you must not make or worship idols made of silver or gold or of anything else !
TLB	Exodus	20	24	“ The altars you make for me must be simple altars of earth . Offer upon them your sacrifices to me—your burnt offerings and peace offerings of sheep and oxen . Build altars only where I tell you to , and I will come and bless you there .
TLB	Exodus	20	25	You may also build altars from stone , but if you do , then use only uncut stones and boulders . Don ’ t chip or shape the stones with a tool , for that would make them unfit for my altar .

TLB	Exodus	21	21	However , if the slave does not die for a couple of days , then the man shall not be punished—for the slave is his property .
TLB	Exodus	21	2	“ If you buy a Hebrew slave , [ a ] he shall serve only six years and be freed in the seventh year , and need pay nothing to regain his freedom .
TLB	Exodus	21	3	“ If he sold himself as a slave before he married , then if he married afterwards , only he shall be freed ; but if he was married before he became a slave , then his wife shall be freed with him at the same time .
TLB	Exodus	21	4	But if his master gave him a wife while he was a slave , and they have sons or daughters , the wife and children shall still belong to the master , and he shall go out by himself free .
TLB	Exodus	21	5	“ But if the man shall plainly declare , ‘ I prefer my master , my wife , and my children , and I would rather not go free , ’
TLB	Exodus	21	6	then his master shall bring him before the judges and shall publicly bore his ear with an awl , and after that he will be a slave forever .

TLB	Exodus	21	8	If she does not please the man who bought her , then he shall let her be bought back again ; but he has no power to sell her to foreigners , since he has wronged her by no longer wanting her after marrying her .
TLB	Exodus	21	9	And if he arranges an engagement between a Hebrew slave girl and his son , then he may no longer treat her as a slave girl , but must treat her as a daughter .
TLB	Exodus	21	10	If he himself marries her and then takes another wife , he may not reduce her food or clothing , or fail to sleep with her as his wife .

TLB	Exodus	24	24	The Lord now instructed Moses , “ Come up here with Aaron , Nadab , Abihu , and seventy of the elders of Israel . All of you except Moses are to worship at a distance .
TLB	Exodus	24	2	Moses alone shall come near to the Lord ; and remember , none of the ordinary people are permitted to come up into the mountain at all. ”
TLB	Exodus	24	3	Then Moses announced to the people all the laws and regulations God had given him ; and the people answered in unison , “ We will obey them all. ”
TLB	Exodus	24	4	Moses wrote down the laws ; and early the next morning he built an altar at the foot of the mountain , with twelve pillars around the altar because there were twelve tribes of Israel .
TLB	Exodus	24	5	Then he sent some of the young men to sacrifice the burnt offerings and peace offerings to the Lord .
TLB	Exodus	24	6	Moses took half of the blood of these animals and drew it off into basins . The other half he splashed against the altar .
TLB	Exodus	24	7	And he read to the people the Book he had written—the Book of the Covenant—containing God ’ s directions and laws . And the people said again , “ We solemnly promise to obey every one of these rules. ”
TLB	Exodus	24	8	Then Moses threw the blood from the basins toward the people and said , “ This blood confirms and seals the covenant the Lord has made with you in giving you these laws. ”
TLB	Exodus	24	9	Then Moses , Aaron , Nadab , Abihu , and seventy of the elders of Israel went up into the mountain .
TLB	Exodus	24	10	And they saw the God of Israel ; under his feet there seemed to be a pavement of brilliant sapphire stones , as clear as the heavens .
TLB	Exodus	24	11	Yet , even though the elders saw God , he did not destroy them ; and they had a meal together before the Lord .
TLB	Exodus	24	12	And the Lord said to Moses , “ Come up to me into the mountain , and remain until I give you the laws and commandments I have written on tablets of stone , so that you can teach the people from them. ”
TLB	Exodus	24	13	So Moses and Joshua , his assistant , went up into the mountain of God .
TLB	Exodus	24	14	He told the elders , “ Stay here and wait for us until we come back ; if there are any problems while I am gone , consult with Aaron and Hur. ”
TLB	Exodus	24	15	Then Moses went up the mountain and disappeared into the cloud at the top .
TLB	Exodus	24	16	And the glory of the Lord rested upon Mount Sinai , and the cloud covered it six days ; the seventh day he called to Moses from the cloud .
TLB	Exodus	24	17	Those at the bottom of the mountain saw the awesome sight : the glory of the Lord on the mountaintop looked like a raging fire .

TLB	Exodus	28	4	This is the wardrobe they shall make : a chestpiece , an ephod , [ a ] a robe , an embroidered shirt , a turban , and a sash . They shall also make special garments for Aaron ’ s sons . 5-6 “ The ephod shall be made by the most skilled of the workmen , using gold , blue , purple , and scarlet threads of fine linen .
TLB	Exodus	28	7	It will consist of two pieces , front and back , joined at the shoulders .
TLB	Exodus	28	8	And the sash shall be made of the same material—threads of gold , blue , purple , and scarlet fine-twined linen .
TLB	Exodus	28	9	Take two onyx stones and engrave on them the names of the tribes of Israel .
TLB	Exodus	28	10	Six names shall be on each stone , so that all the tribes are named in the order of their births .
TLB	Exodus	28	11	When engraving these names , use the same technique as in making a seal ; and mount the stones in gold settings .
TLB	Exodus	28	12	Fasten the two stones upon the shoulders of the ephod , as memorial stones for the people of Israel : Aaron will carry their names before the Lord as a constant reminder . 13-14 Two chains of pure , twisted gold shall be made and attached to gold clasps on the shoulder of the ephod .
TLB	Exodus	28	15	“ Then , using the most careful workmanship , make a chestpiece to be used as God ’ s oracle ; use the same gold , blue , purple , and scarlet threads of fine-twined linen as you did in the ephod .
TLB	Exodus	28	16	This chestpiece is to be of two folds of cloth , forming a pouch nine inches square .
TLB	Exodus	28	17	Attach to it four rows of stones : A ruby , a topaz , and an emerald shall be in the first row .
TLB	Exodus	28	18	The second row will be carbuncle , a sapphire , and a diamond .
TLB	Exodus	28	19	The third row will be an amber , an agate , and an amethyst .
TLB	Exodus	28	20	The fourth row will be an onyx , a beryl , and a jasper—all set in gold settings .
TLB	Exodus	28	21	Each stone will represent one of the tribes of Israel and the name of that tribe will be engraved upon it like a seal . 22-24 “ Attach the top of the chestpiece to the ephod by means of two twisted cords of pure gold . One end of each cord is attached to gold rings placed at the outer top edge of the chestpiece .
TLB	Exodus	28	25	The other ends of the two cords are attached to the front edges of the two settings of the onyx stones on the shoulder of the ephod .
TLB	Exodus	28	26	Then make two more gold rings and place them on the two lower , inside edges of the chestpiece ;
TLB	Exodus	28	27	also make two other gold rings for the bottom front edge of the ephod at the sash .
TLB	Exodus	28	29	In this way Aaron shall carry the names of the tribes of Israel on the chestpiece over his heart ( it is God ’ s oracle ) when he goes into the Holy Place ; thus Jehovah will be reminded of them continually . 30-31 Insert into the pocket of the chestpiece the Urim and Thummim , [ b ] to be carried over Aaron ’ s heart when he goes in before Jehovah . Thus Aaron shall always be carrying the oracle over his heart when he goes in before the Lord . “ The ephod shall be made of blue cloth ,
TLB	Exodus	28	32	with an opening for Aaron ’ s head . It shall have a woven band around this opening , just as on the neck of a coat of mail , so that it will not fray . 33-34 The bottom edge of the ephod shall be embroidered with blue , purple , and scarlet pomegranates , alternated with gold bells .
TLB	Exodus	28	35	Aaron shall wear the ephod whenever he goes in to minister to the Lord ; the bells will tinkle as he goes in and out of the presence of the Lord in the Holy Place , so that he will not die .
TLB	Exodus	28	36	“ Next , make a plate of pure gold and engrave on it , just as you would upon a seal , ‘ Consecrated to Jehovah. ’ 37-38 This plate is to be attached by means of a blue ribbon to the front of Aaron ’ s turban . In this way Aaron will be wearing it upon his forehead , and thus bear the guilt connected with any errors regarding the offerings of the people of Israel . It shall always be worn when he goes into the presence of the Lord , so that the people will be accepted and forgiven .
TLB	Exodus	28	39	“ Weave Aaron ’ s embroidered shirt from fine-twined linen , using a checkerboard pattern ; make the turban , too , of this linen ; and make him an embroidered sash .
TLB	Exodus	28	40	“ Then , for Aaron ’ s sons , make robes , sashes , and turbans to give them honor and respect .
TLB	Exodus	28	41	Clothe Aaron and his sons with these garments , and then dedicate these men to their ministry by anointing their heads with olive oil , thus sanctifying them as the priests , my ministers .
TLB	Exodus	28	42	Also make linen undershorts for them , to be worn beneath their robes next to their bodies , reaching from hips to knees .
TLB	Exodus	28	43	These are to be worn whenever Aaron and his sons go into the Tabernacle or to the altar in the Holy Place , lest they be guilty and die . This is a permanent ordinance for Aaron and his sons . Footnotes - Exodus 28:4 ephod . Apparently a sort of sleeveless tunic reaching from the shoulders to below the knees . - Exodus 28:30 Urim and Thummim . What they looked like has been lost in antiquity . They were perhaps two gemstones located in the breastplate of the High Priest . They were marked in some way and used by the High Priest to determine God ’ s yes or no on urgent matters .

( The various kinds of bread shall be made with finely ground wheat flour . ) 3-4 Place the bread in a basket and bring it to the entrance of the Tabernacle , along with the young bull and the two rams . “ Bathe Aaron and his sons there at the entrance .

TLB	Exodus	29	8	Next , dress his sons in their robes ,
TLB	Exodus	29	9	with their woven sashes , and place caps on their heads . They will then be priests forever ; thus you shall consecrate Aaron and his sons .
TLB	Exodus	29	10	“ Then bring the young bull to the Tabernacle , and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon its head ;
TLB	Exodus	29	11	and you shall kill it before the Lord , at the entrance of the Tabernacle .
TLB	Exodus	29	12	Place its blood upon the horns of the altar , smearing it on with your finger , and pour the rest at the base of the altar .
TLB	Exodus	29	13	Then take all the fat that covers the inner parts , also the gall bladder and two kidneys , and the fat on them , and burn them upon the altar .
TLB	Exodus	29	14	Then take the body , including the skin and the dung , outside the camp and burn it as a sin offering . 15-16 “ Next , Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon the head of one of the rams as it is killed . Its blood shall also be collected and sprinkled upon the altar .
TLB	Exodus	29	17	Cut up the ram and wash off the entrails and the legs ; place them with the head and the other pieces of the body ,
TLB	Exodus	29	18	and burn it all upon the altar ; it is a burnt offering to the Lord , and very pleasant to him . 19-20 “ Now take the other ram , and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon its head as it is killed . Collect the blood and place some of it upon the tip of the right ear of Aaron and his sons , and upon their right thumbs and the big toes of their right feet ; sprinkle the rest of the blood over the altar .
TLB	Exodus	29	21	Then scrape off some of the blood from the altar and mix it with some of the anointing oil and sprinkle it upon Aaron and his sons and upon their clothes ; and they and their clothing shall be sanctified to the Lord .
TLB	Exodus	29	22	“ Then take the fat of the ram , including the fat tail and the fat that covers the insides , also the gall bladder and the two kidneys and the fat surrounding them , and the right thigh—for this is the ram for ordination of Aaron and his sons—
TLB	Exodus	29	23	and one loaf of bread , one cake of shortening bread , and one wafer from the basket of unleavened bread that was placed before the Lord :
TLB	Exodus	29	24	Place these in the hands of Aaron and his sons , to wave them in a gesture of offering to the Lord .
TLB	Exodus	29	25	Afterwards , take them from their hands and burn them on the altar as a fragrant burnt offering to him .
TLB	Exodus	29	26	Then take the breast of Aaron ’ s ordination ram and wave it before the Lord in a gesture of offering ; afterwards , keep it for yourself .
TLB	Exodus	29	27	“ Give the breast and thigh of the consecration ram
TLB	Exodus	29	28	to Aaron and his sons . The people of Israel must always contribute this portion of their sacrifices—whether peace offerings or thanksgiving offerings—as their contribution to the Lord .
TLB	Exodus	29	30	Whoever is the next High Priest after Aaron shall wear these clothes for seven days before beginning to minister in the Tabernacle and the Holy Place .
TLB	Exodus	29	31	“ Take the ram of consecration—the ram used in the ordination ceremony—and boil its meat in a sacred area .
TLB	Exodus	29	32	Aaron and his sons shall eat the meat , also the bread in the basket , at the door of the Tabernacle .
TLB	Exodus	29	33	They alone shall eat those items used in their atonement ( that is , in their consecration ceremony ) . The ordinary people shall not eat them , for these things are set apart and holy .
TLB	Exodus	29	34	If any of the meat or bread remains until the morning , burn it ; it shall not be eaten , for it is holy .
TLB	Exodus	29	35	“ This , then , is the way you shall ordain Aaron and his sons to their offices . This ordination shall go on for seven days .
TLB	Exodus	29	36	Every day you shall sacrifice a young bull as a sin offering for atonement ; afterwards , [ a ] purge the altar by making atonement for it ; pour olive oil upon it to sanctify it .
TLB	Exodus	29	37	Make atonement for the altar and consecrate it to God every day for seven days . After this the altar shall be exceedingly holy , so that whatever touches it shall be set apart for God . [ b ]
TLB	Exodus	29	38	“ Each day offer two yearling lambs upon the altar ,

TLB	Exodus	30	30	Use it to anoint Aaron and his sons , sanctifying them so that they can minister to me as priests .
TLB	Exodus	30	2	It is to be eighteen inches square and three feet high , with horns carved from the wood of the altar—they are not to be merely separate parts that are attached .
TLB	Exodus	30	3	Overlay the top , sides , and horns of the altar with pure gold , and run a gold molding around the entire altar .
TLB	Exodus	30	4	Beneath the molding , on each of two sides , construct two gold rings to hold the carrying poles .
TLB	Exodus	30	5	The poles are to be made of acacia wood overlaid with gold .
TLB	Exodus	30	6	Place the altar just outside the veil , near the place of mercy that is above the Ark containing the Ten Commandments . I will meet with you there .
TLB	Exodus	30	7	“ Every morning when Aaron trims the lamps , he shall burn sweet spices on the altar ,
TLB	Exodus	30	8	and each evening when he lights the lamps he shall burn the incense before the Lord , and this shall go on from generation to generation .
TLB	Exodus	30	9	Offer no unauthorized incense , burnt offerings , meal offerings , or wine offerings .
TLB	Exodus	30	10	“ Once a year Aaron must sanctify the altar , [ a ] placing upon its horns the blood of the sin offering for atonement . This shall be a regular , annual event from generation to generation , for this is the Lord ’ s supremely holy altar. ” 11-12 And Jehovah said to Moses , “ Whenever you take a census of the people of Israel , each man who is numbered shall give a ransom to the Lord for his soul , so that there will be no plague among the people when you number them .
TLB	Exodus	30	13	His payment shall be half a dollar . [ b ]
TLB	Exodus	30	14	All who have reached their twentieth birthday shall give this offering .
TLB	Exodus	30	15	The rich shall not give more and the poor shall not give less , for it is an offering to the Lord to make atonement for yourselves .
TLB	Exodus	30	16	Use this money for the care of the Tabernacle ; it is to bring you , the people of Israel , to the Lord ’ s attention , and to make atonement for you. ” 17-18 And the Lord said to Moses , “ Make a bronze basin with a bronze pedestal . Put it between the Tabernacle and the altar , and fill it with water .
TLB	Exodus	30	19	Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and feet there ,
TLB	Exodus	30	20	when they go into the Tabernacle to appear before the Lord , or when they approach the altar to burn offerings to the Lord . They must always wash before doing so , or they will die .
TLB	Exodus	30	21	These are instructions to Aaron and his sons from generation to generation. ” 22-23 Then the Lord told Moses to collect the choicest of spices—eighteen pounds of pure myrrh ; half as much of cinnamon and of sweet cane ;
TLB	Exodus	30	24	the same amount of cassia as of myrrh ; and 1-1/2 gallons of olive oil .
TLB	Exodus	30	25	The Lord instructed skilled perfume makers to compound all this into a holy anointing oil . 26-27 “ Use this , ” he said , “ to anoint the Tabernacle , the Ark , the table and all its instruments , the lampstand and all its utensils , the incense altar ,
TLB	Exodus	30	28	the burnt offering altar with all its instruments , and the washbasin and its pedestal .
TLB	Exodus	30	29	Sanctify them , to make them holy ; whatever touches them shall become holy . [ c ]
TLB	Exodus	30	31	And say to the people of Israel , ‘ This shall always be my holy anointing oil .
TLB	Exodus	30	32	It must never be poured upon an ordinary person , and you shall never make any of it yourselves , for it is holy , and it shall be treated by you as holy .
TLB	Exodus	30	33	Anyone who compounds any incense like it or puts any of it upon someone who is not a priest shall be excommunicated. ’ ”
TLB	Exodus	30	34	These were the Lord ’ s directions to Moses concerning the incense : “ Use sweet spices—stacte , onycha , galbanum , and pure frankincense , weighing out the same amounts of each ,
TLB	Exodus	30	35	using the usual techniques of the incense maker , and seasoning it with salt ; it shall be a pure and holy incense .
TLB	Exodus	30	36	Beat some of it very fine and put some of it in front of the Ark where I meet with you in the Tabernacle ; this incense is most holy .
TLB	Exodus	30	37	Never make it for yourselves , for it is reserved for the Lord and you must treat it as holy .
TLB	Exodus	30	38	Anyone making it for himself shall be excommunicated. ” Footnotes - Exodus 30:10 must sanctify the altar , literally , “ shall make an atonement for the altar. ” - Exodus 30:13 half a dollar , literally , “ half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary ( the shekel is twenty gerahs ) , half a shekel for an offering to Jehovah. ” - Exodus 30:29 shall become holy , or “ shall be set apart for God , ” or “ only what is holy may touch them. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Exodus	31	31	1-2 The Lord also said to Moses , “ See , I have appointed Bezalel ( son of Uri , and grandson of Hur , of the tribe of Judah ) ,
TLB	Exodus	31	3	and have filled him with the Spirit of God , giving him great wisdom , ability , and skill in constructing the Tabernacle and everything it contains .
TLB	Exodus	31	4	He is highly capable as an artistic designer of objects made of gold , silver , and bronze .
TLB	Exodus	31	5	He is skilled , too , as a jeweler and in carving wood .
TLB	Exodus	31	6	“ And I have appointed Oholiab ( son of Ahisamach of the tribe of Dan ) to be his assistant ; moreover , I have given special skill to all who are known as experts , so that they can make all the things I have instructed you to make :
TLB	Exodus	31	7	the Tabernacle ; the Ark with the place of mercy upon it ; all the furnishings of the Tabernacle ;
TLB	Exodus	31	8	the table and its instruments ; the pure gold lampstand with its instruments ; the altar of incense ;
TLB	Exodus	31	9	the burnt offering altar with its instruments ; the laver and its pedestal ;
TLB	Exodus	31	10	the beautifully made , holy garments for Aaron the priest , and the garments for his sons , so that they can minister as priests ;
TLB	Exodus	31	11	the anointing oil ; and the sweet-spice incense for the Holy Place . They are to follow exactly the directions I gave you. ” 12-13 The Lord then gave these further instructions to Moses : “ Tell the people of Israel to rest on my Sabbath day , for the Sabbath is a reminder of the covenant between me and you forever ; it helps you to remember that I am Jehovah who makes you holy . 14-15 Yes , rest on the Sabbath , for it is holy . Anyone who does not obey this command must die ; anyone who does any work on that day shall be killed . 16-17 Work six days only , for the seventh day is a special day to remind you of my covenant—a weekly reminder forever of my promises to the people of Israel . For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth , and rested on the seventh day , and was refreshed. ”
TLB	Exodus	31	18	Then , as God finished speaking with Moses on Mount Sinai , he gave him the two tablets of stone on which the Ten Commandments were written with the finger of God . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Exodus	32	32	Yet now if you will only forgive their sin—and if not , then blot me out of the book you have written. ” [ a ]
TLB	Exodus	32	4	Aaron melted the gold , then molded and tooled it into the form of a calf . The people exclaimed , “ O Israel , this is the god that brought you out of Egypt ! ”
TLB	Exodus	32	5	When Aaron saw how happy the people were about it , he built an altar before the calf and announced , “ Tomorrow there will be a feast to Jehovah ! ”
TLB	Exodus	32	6	So they were up early the next morning and began offering burnt offerings and peace offerings to the calf idol ; afterwards they sat down to feast and drink at a wild party , followed by sexual immorality .
TLB	Exodus	32	7	Then the Lord told Moses , “ Quick ! Go on down , for your people that you brought from Egypt have defiled themselves ,
TLB	Exodus	32	8	and have quickly abandoned all my laws . They have molded themselves a calf , and worshiped it , and sacrificed to it , and said , ‘ This is your god , O Israel , that brought you out of Egypt. ’ ”
TLB	Exodus	32	9	Then the Lord said , “ I have seen what a stubborn , rebellious lot these people are .
TLB	Exodus	32	10	Now leave me alone and my anger shall blaze out against them and destroy them all ; and I will make you , Moses , into a great nation instead of them. ”
TLB	Exodus	32	11	But Moses begged God not to do it . “ Lord , ” he pleaded , “ why is your anger so hot against your own people whom you brought from the land of Egypt with such great power and mighty miracles ?
TLB	Exodus	32	12	Do you want the Egyptians to say , ‘ God tricked them into coming to the mountains so that he could slay them , destroying them from off the face of the earth ’ ? Turn back from your fierce wrath . Turn away from this terrible evil you are planning against your people !
TLB	Exodus	32	13	Remember your promise to your servants—to Abraham , Isaac , and Israel . For you swore by your own self , ‘ I will multiply your posterity as the stars of heaven , and I will give them all of this land I have promised to your descendants , and they shall inherit it forever. ’ ”
TLB	Exodus	32	14	So the Lord changed his mind and spared them .
TLB	Exodus	32	15	Then Moses went down the mountain , holding in his hands the Ten Commandments written on both sides of two stone tablets .
TLB	Exodus	32	16	( God himself had written the commandments on the tablets . )
TLB	Exodus	32	17	When Joshua heard the noise below them , of all the people shouting , he exclaimed to Moses , “ It sounds as if they are preparing for war ! ”
TLB	Exodus	32	18	But Moses replied , “ No , it ’ s not a cry of victory or defeat , but singing. ”
TLB	Exodus	32	19	When they came near the camp , Moses saw the calf and the dancing , and in terrible anger he threw the tablets to the ground , and they lay broken at the foot of the mountain .
TLB	Exodus	32	20	He took the calf and melted it in the fire , and when the metal cooled , he ground it into powder and spread it upon the water and made the people drink it .
TLB	Exodus	32	21	Then he turned to Aaron . “ What in the world did the people do to you , ” he demanded , “ to make you bring such a terrible sin upon them ? ”
TLB	Exodus	32	22	“ Don ’ t get so upset , ” Aaron replied . “ You know these people and what a wicked bunch they are .
TLB	Exodus	32	23	They said to me , ‘ Make us a god to lead us , for something has happened to this fellow Moses who led us out of Egypt. ’
TLB	Exodus	32	24	Well , I told them , ‘ Bring me your gold earrings. ’ So they brought them to me and I threw them into the fire , and . . . well . . . this calf came out ! ”
TLB	Exodus	32	25	When Moses saw that the people had been committing adultery—at Aaron ’ s encouragement , and much to the amusement of their enemies—
TLB	Exodus	32	26	he stood at the camp entrance and shouted , “ All of you who are on the Lord ’ s side , come over here and join me. ” And all the Levites came .
TLB	Exodus	32	27	He told them , “ Jehovah the God of Israel says , ‘ Get your swords and go back and forth from one end of the camp to the other and kill even your brothers , friends , and neighbors. ’ ”
TLB	Exodus	32	28	So they did , and about three thousand men died that day .
TLB	Exodus	32	29	Then Moses told the Levites , “ Today you have ordained yourselves for the service of the Lord , for you obeyed him even though it meant killing your own sons and brothers ; now he will give you a great blessing. ”
TLB	Exodus	32	30	The next day Moses said to the people , “ You have sinned a great sin , but I will return to the Lord on the mountain—perhaps I will be able to obtain his forgiveness for you. ”
TLB	Exodus	32	31	So Moses returned to the Lord and said , “ Oh , these people have sinned a great sin and have made themselves gods of gold .
TLB	Exodus	32	33	And the Lord replied to Moses , “ Whoever has sinned against me will be blotted out of my book .
TLB	Exodus	32	34	And now go , lead the people to the place I told you about , and I assure you that my Angel shall travel on ahead of you ; however , when I come to visit these people , I will punish them for their sins. ”
TLB	Exodus	32	35	And the Lord sent a great plague upon the people because they had worshiped Aaron ’ s calf . Footnotes - Exodus 32:32 then blot me out of the book you have written , or “ then kill me instead of them. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Exodus	33	33	The Lord said to Moses , “ Lead these people you brought from Egypt to the land I promised Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob ; for I said , ‘ I will give this land to your descendants. ’
TLB	Exodus	33	2	I will send an Angel before you to drive out the Canaanites , Amorites , Hittites , Perizzites , Hivites , and Jebusites .
TLB	Exodus	33	3	It is a land ‘ flowing with milk and honey ’ ; but I will not travel among you , for you are a stubborn , unruly people , and I would be tempted to destroy you along the way. ”
TLB	Exodus	33	4	When the people heard these stern words , they went into mourning and stripped themselves of their jewelry and ornaments .
TLB	Exodus	33	5	For the Lord had told Moses to tell them , “ You are an unruly , stubborn people . If I were there among you for even a moment , I would exterminate you . Remove your jewelry and ornaments until I decide what to do with you. ”
TLB	Exodus	33	6	So , after that , they wore no jewelry .
TLB	Exodus	33	7	Moses always erected the sacred tent ( the “ Tent for Meeting with God , ” he called it ) far outside the camp , and everyone who wanted to consult with Jehovah went out there .
TLB	Exodus	33	8	Whenever Moses went to the Tabernacle , all the people , when they saw it , stood and would rise and stand in their tent doors .
TLB	Exodus	33	9	As he entered , the pillar of cloud would come down and stand at the door while the Lord spoke with Moses .
TLB	Exodus	33	10	Then all the people worshiped from their tent doors , bowing low to the pillar of cloud .
TLB	Exodus	33	11	Inside the tent the Lord spoke to Moses face-to-face , as a man speaks to his friend . Afterwards Moses would return to the camp , but the young man who assisted him , Joshua ( son of Nun ) , stayed behind in the Tabernacle .
TLB	Exodus	33	12	Moses talked there with the Lord and said to him , “ You have been telling me , ‘ Take these people to the Promised Land , ’ but you haven ’ t told me whom you will send with me . You say you are my friend , [ a ] and that I have found favor before you ;
TLB	Exodus	33	13	please , if this is really so , guide me clearly along the way you want me to travel [ b ] so that I will understand you and walk acceptably before you . For don ’ t forget that this nation is your people. ”
TLB	Exodus	33	14	And the Lord replied , “ I myself will go with you and give you success. ”
TLB	Exodus	33	15	For Moses had said , “ If you aren ’ t going with us , don ’ t let us move a step from this place .
TLB	Exodus	33	16	If you don ’ t go with us , who will ever know that I and my people have found favor with you , and that we are different from any other people upon the face of the earth ? ”
TLB	Exodus	33	17	And the Lord had replied to Moses , “ Yes , I will do what you have asked , for you have certainly found favor with me , and you are my friend. ” [ c ]
TLB	Exodus	33	18	Then Moses asked to see God ’ s glory .
TLB	Exodus	33	19	The Lord replied , “ I will make my goodness pass before you , and I will announce to you the meaning of my name [ d ] Jehovah , the Lord . I show kindness and mercy to anyone I want to .
TLB	Exodus	33	20	But you may not see the glory of my face , for man may not see me and live .

TLB	Exodus	34	3	No one shall come with you and no one must be anywhere on the mountain . Do not let the flocks or herds feed close to the mountain. ”
TLB	Exodus	34	4	So Moses took two tablets of stone like the first ones , and was up early and climbed Mount Sinai , as the Lord had told him to , taking the two stone tablets in his hands . 5-6 Then the Lord descended in the form of a pillar of cloud and stood there with him , and passed in front of him and announced the meaning of his name . [ a ] “ I am Jehovah , the merciful and gracious God , ” he said , “ slow to anger and rich in steadfast love and truth .
TLB	Exodus	34	7	I , Jehovah , show this steadfast love to many thousands by forgiving their sins ; [ b ] or else I refuse to clear the guilty , and require that a father ’ s sins be punished in the sons and grandsons , and even later generations. ”
TLB	Exodus	34	8	Moses fell down before the Lord and worshiped .
TLB	Exodus	34	9	And he said , “ If it is true that I have found favor in your sight , O Lord , then please go with us to the Promised Land ; yes , it is an unruly , stubborn people , but pardon our iniquity and our sins , and accept us as your own. ”
TLB	Exodus	34	10	The Lord replied , “ All right , this is the contract I am going to make with you . I will do miracles such as have never been done before anywhere in all the earth , and all the people of Israel shall see the power of the Lord—the terrible power I will display through you .
TLB	Exodus	34	11	Your part of the agreement is to obey all of my commandments ; then I will drive out from before you the Amorites , Canaanites , Hittites , Perizzites , Hivites , and Jebusites .
TLB	Exodus	34	12	“ Be very , very careful never to compromise with the people there in the land where you are going , for if you do , you will soon be following their evil ways .
TLB	Exodus	34	13	Instead , you must break down their heathen altars , smash the obelisks they worship , and cut down their shameful idols . [ c ]
TLB	Exodus	34	14	For you must worship no other gods , but only Jehovah , for he is a God who claims absolute loyalty and exclusive devotion .
TLB	Exodus	34	15	“ No , do not make a peace treaty of any kind with the people living in the land , for they are spiritual prostitutes , committing adultery against me by sacrificing to their gods . [ d ] If you become friendly with them and one of them invites you to go with him and worship his idol , you are apt to do it .
TLB	Exodus	34	16	And you would accept their daughters , who worship other gods , as wives for your sons—and then your sons would commit adultery against me by worshiping their wives ’ gods .
TLB	Exodus	34	17	You must have nothing to do with idols .
TLB	Exodus	34	18	“ Be sure to celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days , just as I instructed you , at the dates appointed each year in March ; that was the month you left Egypt .
TLB	Exodus	34	19	“ Every firstborn male [ e ] is mine—cattle , sheep , and goats .
TLB	Exodus	34	20	The firstborn colt of a donkey may be redeemed by giving a lamb in its place . If you decide not to redeem it , then its neck must be broken . But your sons must all be redeemed . And no one shall appear before me without a gift .
TLB	Exodus	34	21	“ Even during plowing and harvest times , work only six days , and rest on the seventh .
TLB	Exodus	34	22	“ And you must remember to celebrate these three annual religious festivals : the Festival of Weeks , the Festival of the First Wheat , and the Harvest Festival .
TLB	Exodus	34	23	On each of these three occasions all the men and boys of Israel shall appear before the Lord .
TLB	Exodus	34	24	No one will attack and conquer your land when you go up to appear before the Lord your God those three times each year . For I will drive out the nations from before you and enlarge your boundaries .
TLB	Exodus	34	25	“ You must not use leavened bread with your sacrifices to me , and none of the meat of the Passover lamb may be kept over until the following morning .
TLB	Exodus	34	26	And you must bring the best of the first of each year ’ s crop to the Tabernacle of the Lord your God . You must not cook a young goat in its mother ’ s milk. ”
TLB	Exodus	34	27	And the Lord said to Moses , “ Write down these laws [ f ] that I have given you , for they represent the terms of my covenant with you and with Israel. ”
TLB	Exodus	34	28	Moses was up on the mountain with the Lord for forty days and forty nights , and in all that time he neither ate nor drank . At that time God [ g ] wrote out the Covenant—the Ten Commandments—on the stone tablets .
TLB	Exodus	34	29	Moses didn ’ t realize as he came back down the mountain with the tablets that his face glowed from being in the presence of God .
TLB	Exodus	34	30	Because of this radiance upon his face , Aaron and the people of Israel were afraid to come near him .
TLB	Exodus	34	31	But Moses called them over to him , and Aaron and the leaders of the congregation came and talked with him .
TLB	Exodus	34	32	Afterwards , all the people came to him , and he gave them the commandments the Lord had given him upon the mountain .
TLB	Exodus	34	33	When Moses had finished speaking with them , he put a veil over his face ; [ h ]
TLB	Exodus	34	35	and the people would see his face aglow . Afterwards he would put the veil on again until he returned to speak with God .

TLB	Exodus	35	2	“ Work six days only ; the seventh day is a day of solemn rest , a holy day to be used to worship Jehovah ; anyone working on that day must die .
TLB	Exodus	35	3	Don ’ t even light the fires in your homes that day. ”
TLB	Exodus	35	4	Then Moses said to all the people , “ This is what the Lord has commanded : 5-9 All of you who wish to , all those with generous hearts , may bring these offerings to Jehovah : Gold , silver , and bronze ; Blue , purple , and scarlet cloth , made of fine-twined linen or of goats ’ hair ; Tanned rams ’ skins and specially treated goatskins ; Acacia wood ; Olive oil for the lamps ; Spices for the anointing oil and for the incense ; Onyx stones and stones to be used for the ephod and chestpiece . 10-19 “ Come , all of you who are skilled craftsmen having special talents , and construct what God has commanded us : The Tabernacle-tent , and its coverings , clasps , frames , bars , pillars , and bases ; The Ark and its poles ; The place of mercy ; The curtain to enclose the Holy Place ; The table , its carrying poles , and all of its utensils ; The Bread of the Presence ; Lamp holders , with lamps and oil ; The incense altar and its carrying poles ; The anointing oil and sweet incense ; The curtain for the door of the Tabernacle ; The altar for the burnt offerings ; The bronze grating of the altar , and its carrying poles and utensils ; The basin with its pedestal ; The drapes for the walls of the court ; The pillars and their bases ; Drapes for the entrance to the court ; The posts of the Tabernacle court , and their cords ; The beautiful clothing for the priests , to be used when ministering in the Holy Place ; The holy garments for Aaron the priest , and for his sons. ”
TLB	Exodus	35	20	So all the people went to their tents to prepare their gifts .
TLB	Exodus	35	21	Those whose hearts were stirred by God ’ s Spirit returned with their offerings of materials for the Tabernacle , its equipment , and for the holy garments .
TLB	Exodus	35	22	Both men and women came , all who had willing hearts . They brought to the Lord their offerings of gold , jewelry—earrings , rings from their fingers , necklaces—and gold objects of every kind .
TLB	Exodus	35	23	Others brought blue , purple , and scarlet cloth made from the fine-twined linen or goats ’ hair ; and rams ’ skins dyed red , and specially treated goatskins .
TLB	Exodus	35	24	Others brought silver and bronze as their offering to the Lord ; and some brought the acacia wood needed in the construction .
TLB	Exodus	35	25	The women skilled in sewing and spinning prepared blue , purple , and scarlet thread and cloth , and fine-twined linen , and brought them in .
TLB	Exodus	35	26	Some other women gladly used their special skill to spin the goats ’ hair into cloth .
TLB	Exodus	35	27	The leaders brought onyx stones to be used for the ephod and the chestpiece ;
TLB	Exodus	35	28	and spices , and oil—for the light , and for compounding the anointing oil and the sweet incense .
TLB	Exodus	35	29	So the people of Israel—every man and woman who wanted to assist in the work given to them by the Lord ’ s command to Moses—brought their freewill offerings to him . 30-31 And Moses told them , “ Jehovah has specifically appointed Bezalel ( the son of Uri and grandson of Hur of the tribe of Judah ) as general superintendent of the project .
TLB	Exodus	35	32	He will be able to create beautiful workmanship from gold , silver , and bronze ;
TLB	Exodus	35	33	he can cut and set stones like a jeweler and can do beautiful carving ; in fact , he has every needed skill .
TLB	Exodus	35	34	And God has made him and Oholiab gifted teachers of their skills to others . ( Oholiab is the son of Ahisamach , of the tribe of Dan . )

TLB	Exodus	36	36	The curtain was then attached to four gold hooks set into four posts of acacia wood , overlaid with gold and set into four silver bases .
TLB	Exodus	36	3	Moses gave them the materials donated by the people and additional gifts were received each morning . 4-7 But finally the workmen all left their task to meet with Moses and told him , “ We have more than enough materials on hand now to complete the job ! ” So Moses sent a message throughout the camp announcing that no more donations were needed . Then at last the people were restrained from bringing more ! 8-9 The skilled weavers first made ten sheets from fine linen , then embroidered into them blue , purple , and scarlet Guardian Angels . Each sheet was
TLB	Exodus	36	42	feet long and
TLB	Exodus	36	6	feet wide ) .
TLB	Exodus	36	10	Five of these sheets were attached end to end , then five others similarly attached , forming two long roofsheets . 11-12 Fifty blue ribbons were looped along the edges of these two long sheets , each loop being opposite its mate on the other long sheet .
TLB	Exodus	36	13	Then fifty clasps of gold were made to connect the loops , thus tying the two long sheets together to form the ceiling of the Tabernacle . 14-15 Above the ceiling was a second layer formed by eleven draperies made of goats ’ hair ( uniformly
TLB	Exodus	36	45	feet long and
TLB	Exodus	36	16	Bezalel coupled five of these draperies together to make one long piece , and six others to make another long piece .
TLB	Exodus	36	17	Then he made fifty loops along the end of each
TLB	Exodus	36	18	and fifty small bronze clasps to couple the loops so that the draperies were firmly attached to each other .
TLB	Exodus	36	19	The top layer of the roof was made of rams ’ skins , dyed red , and tanned goatskins .
TLB	Exodus	36	20	For the sides of the Tabernacle he used frames of acacia wood standing on end .
TLB	Exodus	36	21	The height of each frame was
TLB	Exodus	36	15	feet and the width 2-1/4 feet .
TLB	Exodus	36	22	Each frame had two clasps joining it to the next .
TLB	Exodus	36	23	There were twenty frames on the south side ,
TLB	Exodus	36	24	with the bottoms fitting into forty silver bases . Each frame was connected to its base by two clasps . 25-26 There were also twenty frames on the north side of the Tabernacle , with forty silver bases , two for each frame .
TLB	Exodus	36	27	The west side of the Tabernacle , which was its rear , was made from six frames ,
TLB	Exodus	36	28	plus another at each corner .
TLB	Exodus	36	29	These frames , including those at the corners , were linked to each other at both top and bottom by rings .
TLB	Exodus	36	30	So , on the west side , there were a total of eight frames with sixteen silver bases beneath them , two for each frame . 31-32 Then he made five sets of bars from acacia wood to tie the frames together along the sides , five for each side of the Tabernacle .
TLB	Exodus	36	33	The middle bar of the five was halfway up the frames , along each side , running from one end to the other .
TLB	Exodus	36	34	The frames and bars were all overlaid with gold , and the rings were pure gold .
TLB	Exodus	36	35	The blue , purple , and scarlet inner [ a ] curtain was made from woven linen , with Guardian Angels skillfully embroidered into it .
TLB	Exodus	36	37	Then he made a drapery for the entrance to the Tabernacle ; it was woven from finespun linen , embroidered with blue , purple , and scarlet .
TLB	Exodus	36	38	This drapery was connected by five hooks to five posts . The posts and their capitals and rods were overlaid with gold ; their five bases were molded from bronze . Footnotes - Exodus 36:35 inner , implied . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Exodus	37	37	Next Bezalel made the Ark . This was constructed of acacia wood and was 3-3/4 feet long , 2-1/4 feet wide , and 2-1/4 feet high .
TLB	Exodus	37	2	It was plated with pure gold inside and out , and had a molding of gold all the way around the sides .
TLB	Exodus	37	3	feet high , with its corner-horns made as part of the altar so that it was all one piece .
TLB	Exodus	37	4	inches high was constructed around the edges of the table , with a gold molding along the rim .
TLB	Exodus	37	5	and put the poles into the rings at the sides of the Ark , to carry it .
TLB	Exodus	37	6	Then , from pure gold , he made a lid called “ the place of mercy ” ; it was 3-3/4 feet long and 2-1/4 feet wide .
TLB	Exodus	37	7	He made two statues of Guardian Angels of beaten gold and placed them at the two ends of the gold lid .
TLB	Exodus	37	8	They were molded so that they were actually a part of the gold lid—it was all one piece .
TLB	Exodus	37	9	The Guardian Angels faced each other , with outstretched wings that overshadowed the place of mercy , looking down upon it .
TLB	Exodus	37	10	Then he made a table , using acacia wood ,
TLB	Exodus	37	11	It was overlaid with pure gold , with a gold molding all around the edge .
TLB	Exodus	37	12	A rim
TLB	Exodus	37	13	Then he cast four rings of gold and placed them into the four table legs ,
TLB	Exodus	37	14	close to the molding , to hold the carrying poles in place .
TLB	Exodus	37	15	He made the carrying poles of acacia wood covered with gold .
TLB	Exodus	37	16	Next , using pure gold , he made the bowls , flagons , dishes , and spoons to be placed upon this table .
TLB	Exodus	37	17	Then he made the lampstand , again using pure , beaten gold . Its base , shaft , lamp-holders , and decorations of almond flowers were all of one piece .
TLB	Exodus	37	18	inches square and
TLB	Exodus	37	19	Each of the branches was decorated with identical carvings of blossoms . 20-21 The main stem of the lampstand was similarly decorated with almond blossoms , a flower on the stem beneath each pair of branches ; also a flower below the bottom pair and above the top pair , four in all .
TLB	Exodus	37	22	The decorations and branches were all one piece of pure , beaten gold . 23-24 Then he made the seven lamps at the ends of the branches , the snuffers , and the ashtrays , all of pure gold . The entire lampstand weighed
TLB	Exodus	37	107	pounds , all pure gold .
TLB	Exodus	37	25	The incense altar was made of acacia wood . It was
TLB	Exodus	37	26	He overlaid it all with pure gold and ran a gold molding around the edge .
TLB	Exodus	37	27	Two gold rings were placed on each side , beneath this molding , to hold the carrying poles .
TLB	Exodus	37	28	The carrying poles were gold-plated acacia wood .
TLB	Exodus	37	29	Then , from sweet spices , he made the sacred oil for anointing the priests , and the pure incense , using the techniques of the most skilled perfumers . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Exodus	38	38	The burnt-offering altar was also constructed of acacia wood ; it was 7-1/2 feet square at the top , and 4-1/2 feet high .
TLB	Exodus	38	2	There were four horns at the four corners , all of one piece with the rest . This altar was overlaid with bronze .
TLB	Exodus	38	3	Then he made bronze utensils to be used with the altar—the pots , shovels , basins , meat hooks , and fire pans .
TLB	Exodus	38	4	Next he made a bronze grating that rested upon a ledge about halfway up in the firebox . [ a ]
TLB	Exodus	38	5	Four rings were cast for each side of the grating , to insert the carrying poles .
TLB	Exodus	38	6	The carrying poles themselves were made of acacia wood , overlaid with bronze .
TLB	Exodus	38	7	The carrying poles were inserted into the rings at the side of the altar . The altar was hollow , with plank siding .
TLB	Exodus	38	8	The bronze washbasin and its bronze pedestal were cast from the solid bronze mirrors donated by the women who assembled at the entrance to the Tabernacle .
TLB	Exodus	38	9	Then he constructed the courtyard . The south wall was
TLB	Exodus	38	150	feet long , with twenty bronze posts and bases and with silver hooks and rods .
TLB	Exodus	38	10	There were twenty posts to hold drapes , with bases of bronze and with silver hooks and rods .
TLB	Exodus	38	11	The north wall was also
TLB	Exodus	38	12	The west side was
TLB	Exodus	38	75	feet wide . 14-15 The drapes at either side of the entrance were 22-1/2 feet wide , each with three posts and three bases .
TLB	Exodus	38	13	The east side was also
TLB	Exodus	38	16	All the drapes making up the walls of the court were woven of fine-twined linen .
TLB	Exodus	38	17	Each post had a bronze base , and all the hooks and rods were silver ; the tops of the posts were overlaid with silver , and the rods to hold up the drapes were solid silver .
TLB	Exodus	38	18	The drapery covering the entrance to the court was made of fine-twined linen , beautifully embroidered with blue , purple , and scarlet thread . It was
TLB	Exodus	38	30	feet long and 7-1/2 feet wide , just the same as the drapes composing the walls of the court .
TLB	Exodus	38	19	It was supported by four posts , with four bronze bases and with silver hooks and rods ; the tops of the posts were also silver .
TLB	Exodus	38	20	All the nails used in constructing the Tabernacle and court were bronze .
TLB	Exodus	38	21	This summarizes the various steps in building the Tabernacle to house the Ark , so that the Levites could carry on their ministry . All was done in the order designated by Moses and was supervised by Ithamar , son of Aaron the priest .
TLB	Exodus	38	22	Bezalel ( son of Uri and grandson of Hur , of the tribe of Judah ) was the master craftsman ,
TLB	Exodus	38	23	assisted by Oholiab ( son of Ahisamach of the tribe of Dan ) ; he too was a skilled craftsman and also an expert at engraving , weaving , and at embroidering blue , purple , and scarlet threads into fine linen cloth .
TLB	Exodus	38	24	The people brought gifts of 3,140 pounds of gold , all of which was used throughout the Tabernacle . 25-26 The amount of silver used was 9,575 pounds , which came from the fifty-cent head tax collected from all those registered in the census who were twenty years old or older , a total of 603,550 men .
TLB	Exodus	38	27	The bases for the frames of the sanctuary walls and for the posts supporting the veil required 9,500 pounds of silver ,
TLB	Exodus	38	95	pounds , literally , “ a talent. ” The exact weight can not be ascertained . The Living Bible copyright ©
TLB	Exodus	38	28	The silver left over was used for the posts and to overlay their tops , and for the rods and hooks . 29-31 The people brought 7,540 pounds of bronze , which was used for casting the bases for the posts at the entrance to the Tabernacle , and for the bronze altar , the bronze grating , the altar utensils , the bases for the posts supporting the drapes enclosing the court , and for all the nails used in the construction of the Tabernacle and the court .

TLB	Exodus	39	39	Then , for the priests , the people made beautiful garments of blue , purple , and scarlet cloth—garments to be used while ministering in the Holy Place . This same cloth was used for Aaron ’ s sacred garments , in accordance with the Lord ’ s instructions to Moses .
TLB	Exodus	39	2	The ephod was made from this cloth too , woven from fine-twined linen thread .
TLB	Exodus	39	3	Bezalel beat gold into thin plates and cut it into wire threads , to work into the blue , purple , and scarlet linen ; it was a skillful and beautiful piece of workmanship when finished . 4-5 The ephod was held together by shoulder straps at the top and was tied down by an elaborate one-piece woven sash made of the same gold , blue , purple , and scarlet cloth cut from fine-twined linen thread , just as God had directed Moses . 6-7 The two [ a ] onyx stones , attached to the two shoulder straps of the ephod , were set in gold , and the stones were engraved with the names of the tribes of Israel , just as initials are engraved upon a ring . These stones were reminders to Jehovah concerning the people of Israel ; all this was done in accordance with the Lord ’ s instructions to Moses .
TLB	Exodus	39	8	The chestpiece was a beautiful piece of work , just like the ephod , made from the finest gold , blue , purple , and scarlet linen .
TLB	Exodus	39	9	It was a piece nine inches square , doubled over to form a pouch ;
TLB	Exodus	39	10	there were four rows of stones across it . In the first row were a sardius , a topaz , and a carbuncle ;
TLB	Exodus	39	11	in the second row were an emerald , a sapphire , and a diamond .
TLB	Exodus	39	12	In the third row were a jacinth , an agate , and an amethyst .
TLB	Exodus	39	13	In the fourth row , a beryl , an onyx , and a jasper—all set in gold filigree .
TLB	Exodus	39	14	The stones were engraved like a seal , with the names of the twelve tribes of Israel . 15-18 To attach the chestpiece to the ephod , [ b ] a gold ring was placed at the top of each shoulder strap of the ephod , and from these gold rings , two strands of twined gold attached to gold clasps on the top corners of the chestpiece .
TLB	Exodus	39	19	Two gold rings were also set at the lower edge of the chestpiece , on the under side , next to the ephod .
TLB	Exodus	39	20	Two other gold rings were placed low on the shoulder straps of the ephod , close to where the ephod joined its beautifully woven sash .
TLB	Exodus	39	21	The chestpiece was held securely above the beautifully woven sash of the ephod by tying the rings of the chestpiece to the rings of the ephod with a blue ribbon . All this was commanded to Moses by the Lord .
TLB	Exodus	39	22	The main part of the ephod was woven , all of blue ,
TLB	Exodus	39	23	and there was a hole at the center , just as in a coat of mail , for the head to go through , reinforced around the edge so that it would not tear .
TLB	Exodus	39	24	Pomegranates were attached to the bottom edge of the robe ; these were made of linen cloth , embroidered [ c ] with blue , purple , and scarlet . 25-26 Bells of pure gold were placed between the pomegranates along the bottom edge of the skirt , with bells and pomegranates alternating all around the edge . This robe was worn when Aaron ministered to the Lord , just as the Lord had commanded Moses .
TLB	Exodus	39	27	Robes were now made for Aaron and his sons from fine-twined linen thread . 28-29 The chestpiece , the beautiful turbans , and the caps and the underclothes were all made of this linen , and the linen belt was beautifully embroidered with blue , purple , and scarlet threads , just as Jehovah had commanded Moses .
TLB	Exodus	39	30	Finally , they made the holy plate of pure gold to wear on the front of the turban , engraved with the words , “ Consecrated to Jehovah. ”
TLB	Exodus	39	31	It was tied to the turban with a blue cord , just as the Lord had instructed .
TLB	Exodus	39	32	And so at last the Tabernacle was finished , following all of the Lord ’ s instructions to Moses . 33-40 Then they brought the entire Tabernacle to Moses : Furniture ; clasps ; frames ; bars ; Posts ; bases ; layers of covering for the roof and sides—the rams ’ skins dyed red , the specially tanned goatskins , and the entrance drape ; the Ark with the Ten Commandments in it ; The carrying poles ; The place of mercy ; The table and all its utensils ; The Bread of the Presence ; The pure gold [ d ] lampstand with its lamps , utensils , and oil ; The gold altar ; The anointing oil ; The sweet incense ; The curtain-door of the Tabernacle ; The bronze altar ; The bronze grating ; The poles and the utensils ; The washbasin and its base ; The drapes for the walls of the court and the posts holding them up ; The bases and the drapes at the gate of the court ; The cords and nails ; All the utensils used there in the work of the Tabernacle .
TLB	Exodus	39	41	They also brought for his inspection the beautifully tailored garments to be worn while ministering in the Holy Place and the holy garments for Aaron the priest , and those for his sons , to be worn when on duty .
TLB	Exodus	39	42	So the people of Israel followed all the Lord ’ s instructions to Moses .

TLB	Exodus	40	5	“ Place the gold altar for the incense in front of the Ark . Set up the drapes at the entrance of the Tabernacle ,
TLB	Exodus	40	6	and place the altar for burnt offerings in front of the entrance .
TLB	Exodus	40	7	Set the washbasin between the Tabernacle-tent and the altar , and fill it with water .
TLB	Exodus	40	8	Then make the courtyard around the outside of the tent , and hang the curtain-door at the entrance to the courtyard .
TLB	Exodus	40	9	“ Take the anointing oil and sprinkle it here and there upon the Tabernacle and everything in it , upon all of its utensils and parts , and all the furniture , to hallow it ; and it shall become holy .
TLB	Exodus	40	10	Sprinkle the anointing oil upon the altar of burnt offering and its utensils , sanctifying it ; for the altar shall then become most holy .
TLB	Exodus	40	11	Then anoint the washbasin and its pedestal , sanctifying it .
TLB	Exodus	40	12	“ Now bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the Tabernacle and wash them with water ;
TLB	Exodus	40	13	and clothe Aaron with the holy garments and anoint him , sanctifying him to minister to me as a priest .
TLB	Exodus	40	14	Then bring his sons and put their robes upon them ,
TLB	Exodus	40	15	and anoint them as you did their father , that they may minister to me as priests ; their anointing shall be permanent from generation to generation : all their children and children ’ s children shall forever be my priests. ”
TLB	Exodus	40	16	So Moses proceeded to do all as the Lord had commanded him .
TLB	Exodus	40	17	On the first day of the first month , in the second year , the Tabernacle was put together .
TLB	Exodus	40	18	Moses erected it by setting its frames into their bases and attaching the bars .
TLB	Exodus	40	19	Then he spread the coverings over the framework and put on the top layers , just as the Lord had commanded him .
TLB	Exodus	40	20	Inside the Ark he placed the stones with the Ten Commandments engraved on them , and attached the carrying poles to the Ark and installed the gold lid , the place of mercy .
TLB	Exodus	40	21	Then he brought the Ark into the Tabernacle and set up the curtain to screen it , just as the Lord had commanded .
TLB	Exodus	40	22	Next he placed the table at the north side of the room outside the curtain
TLB	Exodus	40	23	and set the Bread of the Presence upon the table before the Lord , just as the Lord had commanded .
TLB	Exodus	40	24	And he placed the lampstand next to the table , on the south side of the Tabernacle .
TLB	Exodus	40	25	Then he lighted the lamps before the Lord , following all the instructions ,
TLB	Exodus	40	26	and placed the gold altar in the Tabernacle next to the curtain ,
TLB	Exodus	40	27	and burned upon it the incense made from sweet spices , just as the Lord had commanded .
TLB	Exodus	40	28	He attached the curtain at the entrance of the Tabernacle ,
TLB	Exodus	40	29	and placed the outside altar for the burnt offerings near the entrance , and offered upon it a burnt offering and a meal offering , just as the Lord had commanded him .
TLB	Exodus	40	30	Next he placed the washbasin between the tent and the altar and filled it with water so that the priests could use it for washing .
TLB	Exodus	40	31	Moses and Aaron and Aaron ’ s sons washed their hands and feet there .
TLB	Exodus	40	32	Whenever they walked past the altar to enter the Tabernacle , they stopped and washed , just as the Lord had commanded Moses .
TLB	Exodus	40	33	Then he erected the enclosure surrounding the tent and the altar , and set up the curtain-door at the entrance of the enclosure . So at last Moses finished the work .
TLB	Exodus	40	34	Then the cloud covered the Tabernacle and the glory of the Lord filled it .
TLB	Exodus	40	35	Moses was not able to enter because the cloud was standing there , and the glory of the Lord filled the Tabernacle .
TLB	Exodus	40	36	Whenever the cloud lifted and moved , the people of Israel journeyed onward , following it .
TLB	Exodus	40	37	But if the cloud stayed , they stayed until it moved .
TLB	Exodus	40	38	The cloud rested upon the Tabernacle during the daytime , and at night there was fire in the cloud so that all the people of Israel could see it . This continued throughout all their journeys . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Leviticus	1	1	The Lord now spoke to Moses from the Tabernacle , 2-3 and commanded him to give the following instructions to the people of Israel : “ When you sacrifice to the Lord , use animals from your herds and flocks . “ If your sacrifice is to be an ox given as a burnt offering , use only a bull with no physical defects . Bring the animal to the entrance of the Tabernacle where the priests will accept your gift for the Lord .
TLB	Leviticus	1	4	The person bringing it is to lay his hand upon its head , and it then becomes his substitute : the death of the animal will be accepted by God instead of the death of the man who brings it , as the penalty for his sins . [ a ]
TLB	Leviticus	1	5	The man shall then kill the animal there before the Lord , and Aaron ’ s sons , the priests , will present the blood before the Lord , sprinkling it upon all sides of the altar at the entrance of the Tabernacle . 6-7 Then the priests will skin [ b ] the animal and quarter it , and build a wood fire upon the altar ,
TLB	Leviticus	1	8	and put the sections of the animal and its head and fat upon the wood .
TLB	Leviticus	1	9	The internal organs and the legs are to be washed , then the priests will burn them upon the altar , and they will be an acceptable burnt offering with which the Lord is pleased . [ c ]
TLB	Leviticus	1	10	“ If the animal used as a burnt offering is a sheep or a goat , it too must be a male , and without any blemishes .
TLB	Leviticus	1	11	The man who brings it will kill it before the Lord on the north side of the altar , and Aaron ’ s sons , the priests , will sprinkle its blood back and forth upon the altar .
TLB	Leviticus	1	12	Then the man will quarter it , and the priests will lay the pieces , with the head and the fat , on top of the wood on the altar .
TLB	Leviticus	1	13	But the internal organs and the legs shall first be washed with water . Then the priests shall burn it all upon the altar as an offering to the Lord ; for burnt offerings give much pleasure to the Lord .
TLB	Leviticus	1	14	“ If anyone wishes to use a bird as his burnt offering , he may choose either turtledoves or young pigeons . 15-17 A priest will take the bird to the altar and wring off its head , and the blood shall be drained out at the side of the altar . Then the priest will remove the crop and the feathers and throw them on the east side of the altar with the ashes . Then , grasping it by the wings , he shall tear it apart , but not completely . And the priest shall burn it upon the altar , and the Lord will have pleasure in this sacrifice .

TLB	Leviticus	2	2	Then he is to take a handful , representing the entire amount , [ a ] to one of the priests to burn , and the Lord will be fully pleased .
TLB	Leviticus	2	3	The remainder of the flour is to be given to Aaron and his sons as their food ; but all of it is counted as a holy burnt offering to the Lord .
TLB	Leviticus	2	4	“ If bread baked in the oven is brought as an offering to the Lord , it must be made from finely ground flour , baked with olive oil but without yeast . Wafers made without yeast and spread with olive oil may also be used as an offering .
TLB	Leviticus	2	5	If the offering is something from the griddle , it shall be made of finely ground flour without yeast , and mingled with olive oil .
TLB	Leviticus	2	6	Break it into pieces and pour oil upon it—it is a form of grain offering .
TLB	Leviticus	2	7	If your offering is cooked in a pan , it too shall be made of fine flour mixed with olive oil .

TLB	Leviticus	2	9	“ The priests are to burn only a representative portion [ b ] of the offering , but all of it will be fully appreciated by the Lord .
TLB	Leviticus	2	10	The remainder belongs to the priests for their own use , but it is all counted as a holy burnt offering to the Lord .
TLB	Leviticus	2	11	“ Use no yeast with your offerings of flour ; for no yeast or honey is permitted in burnt offerings to the Lord .
TLB	Leviticus	2	12	You may offer yeast bread and honey as thanksgiving offerings at harvest time , but not as burnt offerings . [ c ]

TLB	Leviticus	2	15	Put olive oil and incense on the offering , for it is a grain offering .

TLB	Leviticus	4	2	“ Tell the people of Israel that these are the laws concerning anyone who unintentionally breaks any of my commandments .
TLB	Leviticus	4	3	If a priest sins unintentionally and so brings guilt upon the people , he must offer a young bull without defect as a sin offering to the Lord .

TLB	Leviticus	6	8	Then the Lord said to Moses ,
TLB	Leviticus	6	9	“ Give Aaron and his sons these regulations concerning the burnt offering : “ The burnt offering shall be left upon the hearth of the altar all night , with the altar fire kept burning .
TLB	Leviticus	6	10	The next morning the priest shall put on his linen undergarments and his linen outer garments , and clean out the ashes of the burnt offering , and put them beside the altar .

TLB	Leviticus	6	14	“ These are the regulations concerning the grain offering : “ Aaron ’ s sons shall stand in front of the altar to offer it before the Lord .
TLB	Leviticus	6	15	The priest shall then take out a handful of the finely ground flour , with the olive oil and the incense mixed into it , and burn it upon the altar as a representative portion for the Lord ; and it will be received with pleasure by the Lord .
TLB	Leviticus	6	16	After taking out this handful , the remainder of the flour will belong to Aaron and his sons for their food ; it shall be eaten without yeast in the courtyard of the Tabernacle .
TLB	Leviticus	6	17	( Stress this instruction , that if it is baked , it must be without yeast . ) I have given to the priests this part of the burnt offerings made to me . However , all of it is most holy , just as is the entire sin offering and the entire guilt offering .
TLB	Leviticus	6	18	It may be eaten by any male descendant of Aaron , any priest , generation after generation . But only the priests [ a ] may eat these offerings made by fire to the Lord. ” 19-20 And Jehovah said to Moses , “ On the day Aaron and his sons are anointed and inducted into the priesthood , they shall bring to the Lord a regular grain offering—a tenth of a bushel of fine flour , half to be offered in the morning and half in the evening .
TLB	Leviticus	6	21	It shall be cooked on a griddle , using olive oil , and should be well cooked , then brought to the Lord as an offering that pleases him very much . 22-23 As the sons of the priests replace their fathers , they shall be inducted into office by offering this same sacrifice on the day of their anointing . This is a perpetual law . These offerings shall be entirely burned up before the Lord ; none of it shall be eaten. ”
TLB	Leviticus	6	24	Then the Lord said to Moses ,
TLB	Leviticus	6	25	“ Tell Aaron and his sons that these are the instructions concerning the sin offering : “ This sacrifice is most holy , and shall be killed before the Lord at the place where the burnt offerings are killed .

TLB	Leviticus	7	7	“ The same instructions apply to both the sin offering and the guilt offering—the carcass shall be given to the priest who is in charge of the atonement ceremony , for his food .
TLB	Leviticus	7	2	“ The sacrificial animal shall be killed at the place where the burnt offering sacrifices are slain , and its blood shall be sprinkled back and forth upon the altar .

TLB	Leviticus	7	4	the two kidneys and the loin fat , and the gall bladder—all shall be set aside for sacrificing .
TLB	Leviticus	7	5	The priests will burn them upon the altar as a guilt offering to the Lord .

TLB	Leviticus	7	8	( When the offering is a burnt sacrifice , the priest who is in charge shall also be given the animal ’ s hide . )
TLB	Leviticus	7	9	The priests who present the people ’ s grain offerings to the Lord shall be given whatever remains of the sacrifice after the ceremony is completed . This rule applies whether the sacrifice is baked , fried , or grilled .
TLB	Leviticus	7	10	All other grain offerings , whether mixed with olive oil or dry , are the common property of all sons of Aaron .
TLB	Leviticus	7	11	“ Here are the instructions concerning the sacrifices given to the Lord as special peace offerings :
TLB	Leviticus	7	12	“ If it is an offering of thanksgiving , unleavened short bread [ a ] shall be included with the sacrifice , along with unleavened wafers spread with olive oil and loaves from a batter of flour mixed with olive oil .
TLB	Leviticus	7	13	This thanksgiving peace offering shall be accompanied with loaves of leavened bread .
TLB	Leviticus	7	14	Part of this sacrifice shall be presented to the Lord by a gesture of waving it before the altar , then it shall be given to the assisting priest , the one who sprinkles the blood of the animal presented for the sacrifice .
TLB	Leviticus	7	15	After the animal has been sacrificed and presented to the Lord as a peace offering to show special appreciation and thanksgiving to him , its meat is to be eaten that same day , and none left to be eaten the next day .
TLB	Leviticus	7	16	“ However , if someone brings a sacrifice that is not for thanksgiving , but is because of a vow or is simply a voluntary offering to the Lord , any portion of the sacrifice that is not eaten the day it is sacrificed may be eaten the next day . 17-18 But anything left over until the third day shall be burned . For if any of it is eaten on the third day , the Lord will not accept it ; it will have no value as a sacrifice , and there will be no credit to the one who brought it to be offered ; and the priest who eats it shall be guilty , for it is detestable to the Lord , and the person who eats it must answer for his sin .
TLB	Leviticus	7	19	“ Any meat that comes into contact with anything that is ceremonially unclean shall not be eaten , but burned ; and as for the meat that may be eaten , it may be eaten only by a person who is ceremonially clean .
TLB	Leviticus	7	20	Any priest who is ceremonially unclean but eats the thanksgiving offering anyway , shall be cut off from his people , for he has defiled what is sacred . [ b ]
TLB	Leviticus	7	21	Anyone who touches anything that is ceremonially unclean , whether it is uncleanness from man or beast , and then eats the peace offering , shall be cut off from his people , for he has defiled what is holy. ”
TLB	Leviticus	7	22	Then the Lord said to Moses ,
TLB	Leviticus	7	23	“ Tell the people of Israel never to eat fat , whether from oxen , sheep , or goats .
TLB	Leviticus	7	24	The fat of an animal that dies of disease , or is attacked and killed by wild animals , may be used for other purposes , but never eaten .
TLB	Leviticus	7	25	Anyone who eats fat from an offering sacrificed by fire to the Lord shall be outlawed from his people . 26-27 “ Never eat blood , whether of birds or animals . Anyone who does shall be excommunicated from his people. ”
TLB	Leviticus	7	28	And the Lord said to Moses ,
TLB	Leviticus	7	29	“ Tell the people of Israel that anyone bringing a thanksgiving offering to the Lord must bring it personally with his own hands .
TLB	Leviticus	7	30	He shall bring the offering of the fat and breast , which is to be presented to the Lord by waving it before the altar .
TLB	Leviticus	7	31	Then the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar , but the breast shall belong to Aaron and his sons , 32-33 while the right thigh shall be given to the officiating priest .
TLB	Leviticus	7	34	For I have designated the breast and thigh as donations from the people of Israel to the sons of Aaron . Aaron and his sons must always be given this portion of the sacrifice .
TLB	Leviticus	7	35	This is their pay ! It is to be set apart from the burnt offerings , and given to all who have been appointed to minister to the Lord as priests—to Aaron and to his sons .
TLB	Leviticus	7	36	For on the day the Lord anointed them , he commanded that the people of Israel give these portions to them ; it is their right forever throughout all their generations. ”
TLB	Leviticus	7	37	These were the instructions concerning the burnt offering , grain offering , sin offering , and guilt offering , and concerning the consecration offering and the peace offering ;
TLB	Leviticus	7	38	these instructions were given to Moses by the Lord on Mount Sinai , to be passed on to the people of Israel so that they would know how to offer their sacrifices to God in the Sinai Desert .

TLB	Leviticus	8	8	Then he put on him the chestpiece and deposited the Urim and the Thummim [ a ] inside its pouch ;
TLB	Leviticus	8	4	So all the people assembled ,
TLB	Leviticus	8	5	and Moses said to them , “ What I am now going to do has been commanded by Jehovah. ”
TLB	Leviticus	8	6	Then he took Aaron and his sons and washed them with water ,
TLB	Leviticus	8	7	and he clothed Aaron with the special coat , sash , robe , and the ephod-jacket with its beautifully woven belt .
TLB	Leviticus	8	9	and placed on Aaron ’ s head the turban with the sacred gold plate at its front—the holy crown—as the Lord had commanded Moses .
TLB	Leviticus	8	10	Then Moses took the anointing oil and sprinkled it upon the Tabernacle itself and on each item in it , sanctifying them .
TLB	Leviticus	8	11	When he came to the altar he sprinkled it seven times , and also sprinkled the utensils of the altar and the washbasin and its pedestal , to sanctify them .
TLB	Leviticus	8	12	Then he poured the anointing oil upon Aaron ’ s head , thus setting him apart for his work .
TLB	Leviticus	8	13	Next Moses placed the robes on Aaron ’ s sons , with the belts and caps , as the Lord had commanded him .
TLB	Leviticus	8	14	Then he took the young bull for the sin offering , and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon its head 15-16 as Moses killed it . He smeared some of the blood with his finger upon the four horns of the altar and upon the altar itself , to sanctify it , and poured out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar ; thus he sanctified the altar , making atonement for it . He took all the fat covering the entrails , the fatty mass above the liver , and the two kidneys and their fat , and burned them all on the altar .
TLB	Leviticus	8	17	The carcass of the young bull , with its hide and dung , was burned outside the camp , as the Lord had commanded Moses .
TLB	Leviticus	8	18	Then he presented to the Lord the ram for the burnt offering . Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon its head ,
TLB	Leviticus	8	19	and Moses killed it and sprinkled the blood back and forth upon the altar .
TLB	Leviticus	8	20	Next he quartered the ram and burned the pieces , the head and the fat .
TLB	Leviticus	8	21	He then washed the insides and the legs with water , and burned them upon the altar , so that the entire ram was consumed before the Lord ; it was a burnt offering that pleased the Lord very much , for Jehovah ’ s directions to Moses were followed in every detail .
TLB	Leviticus	8	22	Then Moses presented the other ram , the ram of consecration ; Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon its head .
TLB	Leviticus	8	23	Moses killed it and took some of its blood and smeared it upon the lobe of Aaron ’ s right ear and the thumb of his right hand and upon the big toe of his right foot .
TLB	Leviticus	8	24	Next he smeared some of the blood upon Aaron ’ s sons—upon the lobes of their right ears , upon their right thumbs , and upon the big toes of their right feet . The rest of the blood he sprinkled back and forth upon the altar . [ b ]
TLB	Leviticus	8	25	Then he took the fat , the tail , the fat upon the inner organs , the gall bladder , the two kidneys with their fat , and the right shoulder ,
TLB	Leviticus	8	26	and placed on top of these one unleavened wafer , one wafer spread with olive oil , and a slice of bread , all taken from the basket that had been placed there before the Lord .
TLB	Leviticus	8	27	All this was placed in the hands of Aaron and his sons to present to the Lord by a gesture of waving them before the altar .
TLB	Leviticus	8	28	Moses then took it all back from them and burned it upon the altar , along with the burnt offering [ c ] to the Lord ; and Jehovah was pleased by the offering .
TLB	Leviticus	8	29	Now Moses took the breast and presented it to the Lord by waving it before the altar ; this was Moses ’ portion of the ram of consecration , just as the Lord had instructed him .
TLB	Leviticus	8	30	Next he took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood that had been sprinkled upon the altar , and sprinkled it upon Aaron and upon his clothes and upon his sons and upon their clothes , thus consecrating to the Lord ’ s use Aaron and his sons and their clothes .
TLB	Leviticus	8	31	Then Moses said to Aaron and his sons , “ Boil the meat at the entrance of the Tabernacle , and eat it along with the bread that is in the basket of consecration , just as I instructed you to do .
TLB	Leviticus	8	32	Anything left of the meat and bread must be burned. ”
TLB	Leviticus	8	33	Next he told them not to leave the Tabernacle entrance for seven days , after which time their consecration would be completed—for it takes seven days .
TLB	Leviticus	8	34	Then Moses stated again that all he had done that day had been commanded by the Lord in order to make atonement for them .
TLB	Leviticus	8	35	And again he warned Aaron and his sons to stay at the entrance of the Tabernacle day and night for seven days . “ If you leave , ” he told them , “ you will die—this is what the Lord has said. ”
TLB	Leviticus	8	36	So Aaron and his sons did all that the Lord had commanded Moses . Footnotes - Leviticus 8:8 the Urim and the Thummim .

TLB	Leviticus	9	9	his sons caught the blood for him , and he dipped his finger in it and smeared it upon the horns of the altar , and poured out the rest at the base of the altar .
TLB	Leviticus	9	2	and told Aaron to take a bull calf from the herd for a sin offering , and a ram without bodily defect for a burnt offering , and to offer them before the Lord .
TLB	Leviticus	9	3	“ And tell the people of Israel , ” Moses instructed , “ to select a male goat for their sin offering , also a yearling calf and a yearling lamb , all without bodily defect , for their burnt offering .
TLB	Leviticus	9	4	In addition , the people are to bring to the Lord a peace offering sacrifice—an ox and a ram , and a grain offering—flour mingled with olive oil . For today , ” Moses said , “ Jehovah will appear to them. ”
TLB	Leviticus	9	5	So they brought all these things to the entrance of the Tabernacle , as Moses had commanded , and the people came and stood there before the Lord .
TLB	Leviticus	9	6	Moses told them , “ When you have followed the Lord ’ s instructions , his glory will appear to you. ”
TLB	Leviticus	9	7	Moses then told Aaron to proceed to the altar and to offer the sin offering and the burnt offering , making atonement for himself first , and then for the people , as the Lord had commanded .
TLB	Leviticus	9	8	So Aaron went up to the altar and killed the calf as a sacrifice for his own sin ;
TLB	Leviticus	9	10	Then he burned upon the altar the fat , kidneys , and gall bladder from this sin offering , as the Lord had commanded Moses ,
TLB	Leviticus	9	11	but he burned the meat and hide outside the camp .
TLB	Leviticus	9	12	Next he killed the burnt offering animal , and his sons caught the blood , and he sprinkled it back and forth upon the altar ;
TLB	Leviticus	9	13	they brought the animal to him piece by piece , including the head , and he burned each part upon the altar .
TLB	Leviticus	9	14	Then he washed the insides and the legs , and offered these also upon the altar as a burnt offering .
TLB	Leviticus	9	15	Next he sacrificed the people ’ s offering ; he killed the goat and offered it in just the same way as he had the sin offering for himself . [ a ]
TLB	Leviticus	9	16	Thus he sacrificed their burnt offering to the Lord , in accordance with the instructions God had given .
TLB	Leviticus	9	17	Then he presented the grain offering , taking a handful and burning it upon the altar in addition to the regular morning offering .
TLB	Leviticus	9	18	Next he killed the ox and ram—the people ’ s peace offering sacrifice ; and Aaron ’ s sons brought the blood to him , and he sprinkled it back and forth upon the altar .
TLB	Leviticus	9	19	Then he collected the fat of the ox and the ram—the fat from their tails and the fat covering the inner organs—and the kidneys and gall bladders .
TLB	Leviticus	9	20	The fat was placed upon the breasts of these animals , and Aaron burned it upon the altar ;
TLB	Leviticus	9	21	but he waved the breasts and right shoulders slowly before the Lord as a gesture of offering it to him , just as Moses had commanded .
TLB	Leviticus	9	22	Then , with hands spread out toward the people , Aaron blessed them and came down from the altar .
TLB	Leviticus	9	23	Moses and Aaron went into the Tabernacle , and when they came out again they blessed the people ; and the glory of the Lord appeared to the whole assembly .
TLB	Leviticus	9	24	Then fire came from the Lord and consumed the burnt offering and fat on the altar ; and when the people saw it , they all shouted and fell flat upon the ground before the Lord . Footnotes - Leviticus 9:15 the sin offering for himself . See vv . 8-11 . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Leviticus	10	10	Your duties will be to arbitrate for the people , to teach them the difference between what is holy and what is ordinary , what is pure and what is impure ;
TLB	Leviticus	10	2	So fire blazed forth from the presence of the Lord and destroyed them .
TLB	Leviticus	10	3	Then Moses said to Aaron , “ This is what the Lord meant when he said , ‘ I will show myself holy among those who approach me , and I will be glorified before all the people. ’ ” And Aaron was speechless .
TLB	Leviticus	10	4	Then Moses called for Mishael and Elzaphon , Aaron ’ s cousins , the sons of Uzziel , and told them , “ Go and get the charred bodies from before the Tabernacle , and carry them outside the camp. ”
TLB	Leviticus	10	5	So they went over and got them , and carried them out in their coats as Moses had told them to .
TLB	Leviticus	10	6	Then Moses said to Aaron and his sons Eleazar and Ithamar , “ Do not mourn—do not let your hair hang loose as a sign of your mourning , and do not tear your clothes . If you do , God will strike you dead too , and his wrath will come upon all the people of Israel . But the rest of the people of Israel may lament the death of Nadab and Abihu , and mourn because of the terrible fire the Lord has sent .
TLB	Leviticus	10	7	But you are not to leave the Tabernacle under penalty of death , for the anointing oil of Jehovah is upon you. ” And they did as Moses commanded . 8-9 Now the Lord instructed Aaron , “ Never drink wine or strong drink when you go into the Tabernacle , lest you die ; and this rule applies to your sons and to all your descendants from generation to generation .
TLB	Leviticus	10	11	and to teach them all the laws Jehovah has given through Moses. ”
TLB	Leviticus	10	12	Then Moses said to Aaron and to his sons who were left , Eleazar and Ithamar , “ Take the grain offering—the food that remains after the handful has been offered to the Lord by burning it on the altar—make sure there is no leaven in it , and eat it beside the altar . The offering is most holy ;
TLB	Leviticus	10	13	therefore , you must eat it in the sanctuary , in a holy place . It belongs to you and to your sons , from the offerings to Jehovah made by fire ; for so I am commanded .
TLB	Leviticus	10	14	But the breast and the thigh , which have been offered to the Lord by the gesture of waving it before him , may be eaten in any holy place . It belongs to you and to your sons and daughters for your food . It is your portion of the peace offering sacrifices of the people of Israel .
TLB	Leviticus	10	15	“ The people are to bring the thigh that was set aside , along with the breast that was offered when the fat was burned , and they shall be presented before the Lord by the gesture of waving them . And afterwards they shall belong to you and your family , for the Lord has commanded this. ”
TLB	Leviticus	10	16	Then Moses searched everywhere for the goat of the sin offering and discovered that it had been burned ! He was very angry about this with Eleazar and Ithamar , the remaining sons of Aaron .
TLB	Leviticus	10	17	“ Why haven ’ t you eaten the sin offering in the sanctuary , since it is most holy , and God has given it to you to take away the iniquity and guilt of the people , to make atonement for them before the Lord ? ” he demanded .
TLB	Leviticus	10	18	“ Since its blood was not taken inside the sanctuary , you should certainly have eaten it there , as I ordered you. ”
TLB	Leviticus	10	19	But Aaron interceded with Moses . “ They offered their sin offering and burnt offering before the Lord , ” he said , “ but if I had eaten the sin offering on such a day as this , would it have pleased the Lord ? ”
TLB	Leviticus	10	20	And when Moses heard that , he was satisfied .

TLB	Leviticus	12	12	The Lord told Moses to give these instructions to the people of Israel :
TLB	Leviticus	12	2	“ When a baby boy is born , the mother shall be ceremonially defiled for seven days , and under the same restrictions as during her monthly menstrual periods .
TLB	Leviticus	12	3	On the eighth day , her son must be circumcised .

TLB	Leviticus	12	7	and the priest will offer them before the Lord and make atonement for her ; then she will be ceremonially clean again after her bleeding at childbirth . “ These , then , are the procedures after childbirth .
TLB	Leviticus	12	8	But if she is too poor to bring a lamb , then she must bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons . One will be for a burnt offering and the other for a sin offering .

TLB	Leviticus	13	13	then the priest shall pronounce him cured of leprosy , for it has all turned white ; he is cured . 14-15 But if there is raw flesh anywhere , the man shall be declared a leper . It is proved by the raw flesh . 16-17 But if the raw flesh later changes to white , the leper will return to the priest to be examined again . If the spot has indeed turned completely white , then the priest will pronounce him cured .
TLB	Leviticus	13	3	for the spot to be examined . If the hair in this spot turns white , and if the spot looks to be more than skin-deep , it is leprosy , and the priest must declare him a leper . [ a ]
TLB	Leviticus	13	4	“ But if the white spot in the skin does not seem to be deeper than the skin and the hair in the spot has not turned white , the priest shall quarantine him for seven days .
TLB	Leviticus	13	5	At the end of that time , on the seventh day , the priest will examine him again , and if the spot has not changed and has not spread in the skin , then the priest must quarantine him seven days more .
TLB	Leviticus	13	6	Again on the seventh day the priest will examine him , and if the marks of the disease have become fainter and have not spread , then the priest shall pronounce him cured ; it was only a scab , and the man need only wash his clothes and everything will be normal again .
TLB	Leviticus	13	7	But if the spot spreads in the skin after he has come to the priest to be examined , he must come back to the priest again ,
TLB	Leviticus	13	8	and the priest shall look again , and if the spot has spread , then the priest must pronounce him a leper . 9-10 “ When anyone suspected of having leprosy is brought to the priest , the priest is to look to see if there is a white swelling in the skin with white hairs in the spot , and an ulcer developing .
TLB	Leviticus	13	11	If he finds these symptoms , it is an established case of leprosy , and the priest must pronounce him defiled . The man is not to be quarantined for further observation , for he is definitely diseased .
TLB	Leviticus	13	12	But if the priest sees that the leprosy has erupted and spread all over his body from head to foot wherever he looks ,
TLB	Leviticus	13	18	“ In the case of a man who has a boil in his skin which heals ,
TLB	Leviticus	13	19	but which leaves a white swelling or a bright spot , sort of reddish white , the man must go to the priest for examination .
TLB	Leviticus	13	20	If the priest sees that the trouble seems to be down under the skin , and if the hair at the spot has turned white , then the priest shall declare him defiled , for leprosy has broken out from the boil .
TLB	Leviticus	13	21	But if the priest sees that there are no white hairs in this spot , and the spot does not appear to be deeper than the skin , and if the color is gray , then the priest shall quarantine him for seven days .
TLB	Leviticus	13	22	If during that time the spot spreads , the priest must declare him a leper .
TLB	Leviticus	13	23	But if the bright spot grows no larger and does not spread , it is merely the scar from the boil , and the priest shall declare that all is well .
TLB	Leviticus	13	24	“ If a man is burned in some way , and the burned place becomes bright reddish white or white ,
TLB	Leviticus	13	25	then the priest must examine the spot . If the hair in the bright spot turns white and the problem seems to be more than skin-deep , it is leprosy that has broken out from the burn , and the priest must pronounce him a leper . [ b ]

TLB	Leviticus	13	28	But if the bright spot does not move or spread in the skin , and is fading , it is simply a scar from the burn , and the priest shall declare that he does not have leprosy . 29-30 “ If a man or woman has a sore on the head or chin , the priest must examine him ; if the infection seems to be below the skin and yellow hair is found in the sore , the priest must pronounce him a leper .
TLB	Leviticus	13	31	But if the priest ’ s examination reveals that the spot seems to be only in the skin but there is healthy hair in it , then he shall be quarantined for seven days ,

TLB	Leviticus	13	33	he shall shave off all the hair around the spot ( but not on the spot itself ) and the priest shall quarantine him for another seven days .
TLB	Leviticus	13	34	He shall be examined again on the seventh day , and if the spot has not spread , and it appears to be no deeper than the skin , the priest shall pronounce him well , and after washing his clothes , he is free . [ c ]
TLB	Leviticus	13	35	But if , later on , this spot begins to spread ,
TLB	Leviticus	13	36	then the priest must examine him again and , without waiting to see if any yellow hair develops , declare him a leper .
TLB	Leviticus	13	37	But if it appears that the spreading has stopped and black hairs are found in the spot , then he is healed and is not a leper , and the priest shall declare him healed .
TLB	Leviticus	13	38	“ If a man or a woman has white , transparent areas in the skin ,
TLB	Leviticus	13	39	but these spots are growing dimmer , this is not leprosy , but an ordinary infection that has broken out in the skin .
TLB	Leviticus	13	40	“ If a man ’ s hair is gone , this does not make him a leper even though he is bald !
TLB	Leviticus	13	41	If the hair is gone from the front part of his head , he simply has a bald forehead , but this is not leprosy .
TLB	Leviticus	13	42	However , if in the baldness there is a reddish white spot , it may be leprosy breaking out .
TLB	Leviticus	13	43	In that case the priest shall examine him , and if there is a reddish white lump that looks like leprosy ,
TLB	Leviticus	13	44	then he is a leper , and the priest must pronounce him such .
TLB	Leviticus	13	45	“ Anyone who is discovered to have leprosy must tear his clothes and let his hair grow in wild disarray , and cover his upper lip and call out as he goes , “ I am a leper , I am a leper. ” [ d ]
TLB	Leviticus	13	46	As long as the disease lasts , he is defiled and must live outside the camp . 47-48 “ If leprosy is suspected in a woolen or linen garment or fabric , or in a piece of leather or leatherwork ,
TLB	Leviticus	13	49	and there is a greenish or a reddish spot in it , it is probably leprosy , and must be taken to the priest to be examined .

TLB	Leviticus	13	51	and look at it again on the seventh day . If the spot has spread , it is a contagious leprosy ,
TLB	Leviticus	13	52	and he must burn the clothing , fabric , linen or woolen covering , or leather article , for it is contagious and must be destroyed by fire .
TLB	Leviticus	13	53	“ But if when he examines it again on the seventh day the spot has not spread ,
TLB	Leviticus	13	54	the priest shall order the suspected article to be washed , then isolated for seven more days .
TLB	Leviticus	13	55	If after that time the spot has not changed its color , even though it has not spread , it is leprosy and shall be burned , for the article is infected through and through . [ e ]
TLB	Leviticus	13	56	But if the priest sees that the spot has faded after the washing , then he shall cut it out from the garment or leather goods or whatever it is in .
TLB	Leviticus	13	57	However , if it then reappears , it is leprosy and he must burn it .
TLB	Leviticus	13	58	But if after washing it there is no further trouble , it can be put back into service after another washing. ”

TLB	Leviticus	14	14	The priest shall take the blood from this guilt offering and smear some of it upon the tip of the right ear of the man being cleansed , and upon the thumb of his right hand , and upon the big toe of his right foot .
TLB	Leviticus	14	3	“ The priest shall go out of the camp to examine him . If the priest sees that the leprosy is gone ,
TLB	Leviticus	14	4	he shall require two living birds of a kind permitted for food , and shall take some cedar wood , a scarlet string , and some hyssop branches , to be used for the purification ceremony of the one who is healed .
TLB	Leviticus	14	5	The priest shall then order one of the birds killed in an earthenware pot held above running water .
TLB	Leviticus	14	6	The other bird , still living , shall be dipped in the blood , along with the cedar wood , the scarlet thread , and the hyssop branch .
TLB	Leviticus	14	7	Then the priest shall sprinkle the blood seven times upon the man cured of his leprosy , and the priest shall pronounce him cured , and shall let the living bird fly into the open field .
TLB	Leviticus	14	8	“ Then the man who is cured shall wash his clothes , shave off all his hair , and bathe himself , and return to live inside the camp ; however , he must stay outside his tent for seven days .
TLB	Leviticus	14	9	The seventh day he shall again shave all the hair from his head , beard , and eyebrows , and wash his clothes and bathe , and shall then be declared fully cured of his leprosy .
TLB	Leviticus	14	10	“ The next day , the eighth day , he shall take two male lambs without physical defect , one yearling ewe-lamb without physical defect , ten quarts of finely ground flour mixed with olive oil , and a pint of olive oil ;
TLB	Leviticus	14	11	then the priest who examines him shall place the man and his offerings before the Lord at the entrance of the Tabernacle .
TLB	Leviticus	14	12	The priest shall take one of the lambs and the pint of olive oil and offer them to the Lord as a guilt offering by the gesture of waving them before the altar .
TLB	Leviticus	14	13	Then he shall kill the lamb at the place where sin offerings and burnt offerings are killed , there at the Tabernacle ; this guilt offering shall then be given to the priest for food , as in the case of a sin offering . It is a most holy offering .
TLB	Leviticus	14	15	“ Then the priest shall take the olive oil and pour it into the palm of his left hand ,
TLB	Leviticus	14	16	and dip his right finger into it , and sprinkle it with his finger seven times before the Lord .
TLB	Leviticus	14	17	Some of the oil remaining in his left hand shall then be placed by the priest upon the tip of the man ’ s right ear and the thumb of his right hand and the big toe of his right foot—just as he did with the blood of the guilt offering .
TLB	Leviticus	14	18	The remainder of the oil in his hand shall be used to anoint the man ’ s head . Thus the priest shall make atonement for him before the Lord .
TLB	Leviticus	14	19	“ Then the priest must offer the sin offering and again [ a ] perform the rite of atonement for the person being cleansed from his leprosy ; and afterwards the priest shall kill the burnt offering ,
TLB	Leviticus	14	20	and offer it along with the grain offering upon the altar , making atonement for the man , who shall then be pronounced finally cleansed .
TLB	Leviticus	14	21	“ If he is so poor that he can not afford two lambs , then he shall bring only one , a male lamb for the guilt offering , to be presented to the Lord in the rite of atonement by waving it before the altar ; and only three quarts of fine white flour , mixed with olive oil , for a grain offering , and a pint of olive oil .
TLB	Leviticus	14	22	“ He shall also bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons—whichever he is able to afford—and use one of the pair for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering .
TLB	Leviticus	14	23	He shall bring them to the priest at the entrance of the Tabernacle on the eighth day , for his ceremony of cleansing before the Lord .
TLB	Leviticus	14	24	The priest shall take the lamb for the guilt offering , and the pint of oil , and wave them before the altar as a gesture of offering to the Lord .
TLB	Leviticus	14	25	Then he shall kill the lamb for the guilt offering and smear some of its blood upon the tip of the man ’ s right ear—the man on whose behalf the ceremony is being performed—and upon the thumb of his right hand and upon the big toe of his right foot .
TLB	Leviticus	14	26	“ The priest shall then pour the olive oil into the palm of his own left hand ,
TLB	Leviticus	14	27	and with his right finger he is to sprinkle some of it seven times before the Lord .
TLB	Leviticus	14	28	Then he must put some of the olive oil from his hand upon the tip of the man ’ s right ear , and upon the thumb of his right hand , and upon the big toe of his right foot , just as he did with the blood of the guilt offering .
TLB	Leviticus	14	29	The remaining oil in his hand shall be placed upon the head of the man being cleansed , to make atonement for him before the Lord .
TLB	Leviticus	14	30	“ Then he must offer the two turtledoves or two young pigeons ( whichever pair he is able to afford ) .
TLB	Leviticus	14	31	One of the pair is for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering , to be sacrificed along with the grain offering ; and the priest shall make atonement for the man before the Lord. ”
TLB	Leviticus	14	32	These , then , are the laws concerning those who are cleansed of leprosy but are not able to bring the sacrifices normally required for the ceremony of cleansing . 33-34 Then the Lord said to Moses and Aaron , “ When you arrive in the land of Canaan which I have given you , and I place leprosy in some house there ,
TLB	Leviticus	14	35	then the owner of the house shall come and report to the priest , ‘ It seems to me that there may be leprosy in my house ! ’
TLB	Leviticus	14	36	“ The priest shall order the house to be emptied before he examines it , so that everything in the house will not be declared contaminated if he decides that there is leprosy there .
TLB	Leviticus	14	37	If he finds greenish or reddish streaks in the walls of the house which seem to be beneath the surface of the wall ,
TLB	Leviticus	14	38	he shall close up the house for seven days ,
TLB	Leviticus	14	39	and return the seventh day to look at it again . If the spots have spread in the wall ,
TLB	Leviticus	14	40	then the priest shall order the removal of the spotted section of wall , and the material must be thrown into a defiled place outside the city .
TLB	Leviticus	14	41	Then he shall order the inside walls of the house scraped thoroughly and the scrapings dumped in a defiled place outside the city .
TLB	Leviticus	14	42	Other stones shall be brought to replace those that have been removed , new mortar used , and the house replastered .
TLB	Leviticus	14	43	“ But if the spots appear again ,
TLB	Leviticus	14	44	the priest shall come again and look , and if he sees that the spots have spread , it is leprosy , and the house is defiled .
TLB	Leviticus	14	45	Then he shall order the destruction of the house—all its stones , timbers , and mortar shall be carried out of the city to a defiled place .
TLB	Leviticus	14	46	Anyone entering the house while it is closed shall be defiled until evening .
TLB	Leviticus	14	47	Anyone who lies down or eats in the house shall wash his clothing .
TLB	Leviticus	14	48	“ But if , when the priest comes again to look , the spots have not reappeared after the fresh plastering , then he will pronounce the house cleansed and declare the leprosy gone .
TLB	Leviticus	14	49	He shall also perform the ceremony of cleansing , using two birds , cedar wood , scarlet thread , and hyssop branches .
TLB	Leviticus	14	50	He shall kill one of the birds over fresh water in an earthenware bowl , 51-52 and dip the cedar wood , hyssop branch , and scarlet thread , as well as the living bird , into the blood of the bird that was killed over the fresh water , and shall sprinkle the house seven times . In this way the house shall be cleansed .
TLB	Leviticus	14	53	Then he shall let the live bird fly away into an open field outside the city . This is the method for making atonement for the house and cleansing it. ”
TLB	Leviticus	14	54	These , then , are the laws concerning the various places where leprosy may appear :
TLB	Leviticus	14	55	in a garment or in a house ,
TLB	Leviticus	14	56	or in any swelling in one ’ s skin , or a scab from a burn , or a bright spot .
TLB	Leviticus	14	57	In this way you will know whether or not it is actually leprosy . That is why these laws are given . Footnotes - Leviticus 14:19 and again , implied . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Leviticus	15	15	The priest shall sacrifice them there , one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering ; thus the priest shall make atonement before the Lord for the man because of his discharge .
TLB	Leviticus	15	3	This applies not only while the discharge is active , but also for a time after it heals .
TLB	Leviticus	15	4	Any bed he lies on and anything he sits on is contaminated :
TLB	Leviticus	15	5	so anyone touching the man ’ s bed is ceremonially defiled until evening , and must wash his clothes and bathe himself .
TLB	Leviticus	15	6	Anyone sitting on a seat the man has sat upon while defiled is himself ceremonially impure until evening , and must wash his clothes and bathe himself .
TLB	Leviticus	15	7	The same instructions apply to anyone touching him .
TLB	Leviticus	15	8	Anyone he spits on is ceremonially impure until evening , and must wash his clothes and bathe himself .
TLB	Leviticus	15	9	Any saddle he rides on is defiled .
TLB	Leviticus	15	10	Anyone touching or carrying anything else that was beneath him shall be defiled until evening , and must wash his clothes and bathe himself .
TLB	Leviticus	15	11	If the defiled man touches anyone without first rinsing his hands , that person must wash his clothes and bathe himself and be defiled until evening .
TLB	Leviticus	15	12	Any earthen pot touched by the defiled man must be broken , and every wooden utensil must be rinsed in water .
TLB	Leviticus	15	13	“ When the discharge stops , he shall begin a seven-day cleansing ceremony by washing his clothes and bathing in running water .
TLB	Leviticus	15	14	On the eighth day he shall take two turtledoves or two young pigeons and come before the Lord at the entrance of the Tabernacle , and give them to the priest .
TLB	Leviticus	15	16	“ Whenever a man ’ s semen goes out from him , he shall take a complete bath and be ceremonially impure until the evening .
TLB	Leviticus	15	17	Any clothing or bedding the semen spills on must be washed and remain ceremonially defiled until evening .
TLB	Leviticus	15	18	After sexual intercourse , the woman as well as the man must bathe , and they are ceremonially defiled until the next evening .
TLB	Leviticus	15	19	“ Whenever a woman menstruates , she shall be in a state of ceremonial defilement for seven days afterwards , and during that time anyone touching her shall be defiled until evening .
TLB	Leviticus	15	20	Anything she lies on or sits on during that time shall be defiled . 21-23 Anyone touching her bed or anything she sits upon shall wash his clothes and bathe himself and be ceremonially defiled until evening .
TLB	Leviticus	15	24	A man having sexual intercourse with her during this time is ceremonially defiled for seven days , and every bed he lies upon shall be defiled .
TLB	Leviticus	15	25	“ If the menstrual flow continues after the normal time , or at some irregular time during the month , the same rules apply as indicated above ,
TLB	Leviticus	15	26	so that anything she lies upon during that time is defiled , just as it would be during her normal menstrual period , and everything she sits on is in a similar state of defilement .
TLB	Leviticus	15	27	Anyone touching her bed or anything she sits on shall be defiled , and shall wash his clothes and bathe and be defiled until evening .
TLB	Leviticus	15	28	Seven days after the menstruating stops , she is no longer ceremonially defiled .
TLB	Leviticus	15	29	“ On the eighth day , she shall take two turtledoves or two young pigeons and bring them to the priest at the entrance of the Tabernacle ,
TLB	Leviticus	15	30	and the priest shall offer one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering , and make atonement for her before the Lord for her menstrual defilement .
TLB	Leviticus	15	31	In this way you shall cleanse the people of Israel from their defilement , lest they die because of defiling my Tabernacle that is among them. ”
TLB	Leviticus	15	32	This , then , is the law for the man who is defiled by a genital disease [ b ] or by a seminal emission ;
TLB	Leviticus	15	33	and for a woman ’ s menstrual period ; and for anyone who has sexual intercourse with her while she is in her period of defilement afterwards .

TLB	Leviticus	16	16	Thus he shall make atonement for the holy place because it is defiled by the sins of the people of Israel , and for the Tabernacle , located right among them and surrounded by their defilement .
TLB	Leviticus	16	3	“ Here are the conditions for his entering there : He must bring a young bull for a sin offering , and a ram for a burnt offering .
TLB	Leviticus	16	4	He must bathe himself and put on the sacred linen coat , shorts , belt , and turban .
TLB	Leviticus	16	5	The people of Israel shall then bring him two male goats for their sin offering , and a ram for their burnt offering .
TLB	Leviticus	16	6	First he shall present to the Lord the young bull as a sin offering for himself , making atonement for himself and his family .
TLB	Leviticus	16	7	Then he shall bring the two goats before the Lord at the entrance of the Tabernacle ,
TLB	Leviticus	16	8	and cast lots to determine which is the Lord ’ s and which is to be sent away . [ a ]
TLB	Leviticus	16	9	The goat allotted to the Lord shall then be sacrificed by Aaron as a sin offering .
TLB	Leviticus	16	10	The other goat shall be kept alive and placed before the Lord . The rite of atonement shall be performed over it , and it shall then be sent out into the desert as a scapegoat .
TLB	Leviticus	16	11	“ After Aaron has sacrificed the young bull as a sin offering for himself and his family ,
TLB	Leviticus	16	12	he shall take a censer full of live coals from the altar of the Lord , and fill his hands with sweet incense beaten into fine powder , and bring it inside the veil .
TLB	Leviticus	16	13	There before the Lord he shall put the incense upon the coals , so that a cloud of incense will cover the mercy place above the Ark ( containing the stone tablets of the Ten Commandments ) ; thus he will not die .
TLB	Leviticus	16	14	And he shall bring some of the blood of the young bull and sprinkle it with his finger upon the east side of the mercy place , and then seven times in front of it .
TLB	Leviticus	16	15	“ Then he must go out [ b ] and sacrifice the people ’ s sin offering goat , and bring its blood within the veil , and sprinkle it upon the place of mercy and in front of it , just as he did with the blood of the young bull .
TLB	Leviticus	16	17	Not another soul shall be inside the Tabernacle when Aaron enters to make atonement in the Holy Place—not until after he comes out again and has made atonement for himself and his household and for all the people of Israel .
TLB	Leviticus	16	18	Then he shall go out to the altar before the Lord and make atonement for it . He must smear the blood of the young bull and the goat on the horns of the altar ,
TLB	Leviticus	16	19	and sprinkle blood upon the altar seven times with his finger , thus cleansing it from the sinfulness of Israel and making it holy . [ c ]
TLB	Leviticus	16	20	“ When he has completed the rite of atonement for the Holy Place , the entire Tabernacle , and the altar , he shall bring the live goat and ,
TLB	Leviticus	16	21	laying both hands upon its head , confess over it all the sins of the people of Israel . He shall lay all their sins upon the head of the goat and send it into the desert , led by a man appointed for the task .
TLB	Leviticus	16	22	So the goat shall carry all the sins of the people into a land where no one lives , [ d ] and the man shall let it loose in the wilderness .
TLB	Leviticus	16	23	“ Then Aaron shall go into the Tabernacle again and take off the linen garments he wore when he went behind the veil , and leave them there in the Tabernacle .
TLB	Leviticus	16	24	Then he shall bathe in a sacred place , put on his clothes again , and go out and sacrifice his own burnt offering for the people , making atonement for himself and for them .
TLB	Leviticus	16	25	He shall also burn upon the altar the fat for the sin offering .
TLB	Leviticus	16	26	“ The man who took the goat out into the desert [ e ] shall afterwards wash his clothes and bathe himself and then come back into the camp .
TLB	Leviticus	16	27	And the young bull and the goat used for the sin offering ( their blood was taken into the Holy Place by Aaron , to make atonement ) shall be carried outside the camp and burned , including the hides and internal organs .
TLB	Leviticus	16	28	Afterwards , the person doing the burning shall wash his clothes and bathe himself and then return to camp . 29-30 “ This is a permanent law : You must do no work on the twenty-fifth day of September , [ f ] but must spend the day in self-examination and humility . This applies whether you are born in the land or are a foreigner living among the people of Israel ; for this is the day commemorating the atonement , cleansing you in the Lord ’ s eyes from all of your sins .
TLB	Leviticus	16	31	It is a Sabbath of solemn rest for you , and you shall spend the day in quiet humility ; [ g ] this is a permanent law .
TLB	Leviticus	16	32	This ceremony , in later generations , shall be performed by the anointed High Priest , consecrated in place of his ancestor Aaron ; he shall be the one to put on the holy linen garments ,
TLB	Leviticus	16	33	and make atonement for the holy sanctuary , the Tabernacle , the altar , the priests , and the people .
TLB	Leviticus	16	34	This shall be an everlasting law for you , to make atonement for the people of Israel once each year , because of their sins. ” And Aaron followed all these instructions that the Lord gave to Moses .

TLB	Leviticus	17	17	1-2 The Lord gave to Moses these additional instructions for Aaron and the priests and for all the people of Israel : 3-4 “ Any Israelite who sacrifices [ a ] an ox , lamb , or goat anywhere except at the Tabernacle is guilty of murder and shall be excommunicated from his nation .
TLB	Leviticus	17	5	The purpose of this law is to stop the people of Israel from sacrificing in the open fields , and to cause them to bring their sacrifices to the priest at the entrance of the Tabernacle , and to burn the fat as a savor the Lord will appreciate and enjoy—
TLB	Leviticus	17	6	for in this way the priest will be able to sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the Lord at the entrance of the Tabernacle , and to burn the fat as a savor the Lord will appreciate and enjoy—
TLB	Leviticus	17	7	instead of the people ’ s sacrificing to evil spirits [ b ] out in the fields . This shall be a permanent law for you , from generation to generation . 8-9 I repeat : Anyone , whether an Israelite or a foreigner living among you who offers a burnt offering or a sacrifice anywhere other than at the entrance of the Tabernacle , where it will be sacrificed to the Lord , shall be excommunicated .
TLB	Leviticus	17	10	“ And I will turn my face against anyone , whether an Israelite or a foreigner living among you , who eats blood in any form . I will excommunicate him from his people .
TLB	Leviticus	17	11	For the life of the flesh is in the blood , and I have given you the blood to sprinkle upon the altar as an atonement for your souls ; it is the blood that makes atonement because it is the life . [ c ]
TLB	Leviticus	17	12	That is the reasoning behind my decree to the people of Israel , that neither they , nor any foreigner living among them , may eat blood .
TLB	Leviticus	17	13	Anyone , whether an Israelite or a foreigner living among you , who goes hunting and kills an animal or bird of a kind permitted for food , must pour out the blood and cover it with dust ,
TLB	Leviticus	17	14	for the blood is the life . That is why I told the people of Israel never to eat it , for the life of every bird and animal [ d ] is its blood . Therefore , anyone who eats blood must be excommunicated .
TLB	Leviticus	17	15	“ And anyone—native born or foreigner—who eats the dead body of an animal that dies a natural death , or is killed by wild animals , must wash his clothes and bathe himself and be defiled until evening ; after that he shall be declared cleansed .
TLB	Leviticus	17	16	But if he does not wash his clothes and bathe , he shall suffer the consequence. ” Footnotes - Leviticus 17:3 sacrifices , literally , “ slaughters. ” - Leviticus 17:7 evil spirits , literally , “ hairy ones. ” - Leviticus 17:11 because it is the life , implied . - Leviticus 17:14 every bird and animal , literally , “ every creature. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Leviticus	19	7	For any of it eaten on the third day is repulsive to me and will not be accepted .

TLB	Leviticus	21	21	although he is a descendant of Aaron—he is not permitted to offer the fire sacrifices to the Lord because of his physical defect .
TLB	Leviticus	21	4	For the priest is a leader among his people , and he may not ceremonially defile himself as an ordinary person can .
TLB	Leviticus	21	5	“ The priests shall not clip bald spots in their hair or beards , nor cut their flesh .
TLB	Leviticus	21	6	They shall be holy unto their God and shall not dishonor and profane his name ; otherwise they will be unfit to make food offerings by fire to the Lord their God .
TLB	Leviticus	21	7	A priest shall not marry a prostitute , nor a woman of another tribe , and he shall not marry a divorced woman , for he is a holy man of God .
TLB	Leviticus	21	8	The priest is set apart to offer the sacrifices of your God ; he is holy , for I , the Lord who sanctifies you , am holy .
TLB	Leviticus	21	9	The daughter of any priest who becomes a prostitute , thus violating her father ’ s holiness as well as her own , shall be burned alive .
TLB	Leviticus	21	10	“ The High Priest—anointed with the special anointing oil and wearing the special garments—must not let his hair hang loose in mourning , nor tear his clothing ,
TLB	Leviticus	21	11	nor be in the presence of any dead person—not even his father or mother . [ b ]
TLB	Leviticus	21	12	He shall not leave the sanctuary when on duty , [ c ] nor treat my Tabernacle like an ordinary house , for the consecration of the anointing oil of his God is upon him ; I am Jehovah .
TLB	Leviticus	21	13	He must marry a virgin . 14-15 He may not marry a widow , nor a woman who is divorced , nor a prostitute . She must be a virgin from his own tribe , for he must not be the father of children of mixed blood—half priestly and half ordinary. ” [ d ] 16-17 And the Lord said to Moses , “ Tell Aaron that any of his descendants from generation to generation who have any bodily defect may not offer the sacrifices to God .
TLB	Leviticus	21	18	For instance , if a man is blind or lame , or has a broken nose or any extra fingers or toes ,
TLB	Leviticus	21	19	or has a broken foot or hand ,
TLB	Leviticus	21	20	or has a humped back , or is a dwarf , or has a defect in his eye , or has pimples or scabby skin , or has imperfect testicles—
TLB	Leviticus	21	22	However , he shall be fed with the food of the priests from the offerings sacrificed to God , both from the holy and most holy offerings .
TLB	Leviticus	21	23	But he shall not go in behind the veil , nor come near the altar , because of the physical defect ; this would defile my sanctuary , for it is Jehovah who sanctifies it. ”

TLB	Leviticus	22	3	From now on and forever , if a priest who is ceremonially defiled sacrifices the animals brought by the people or handles the gifts dedicated to Jehovah , he shall be discharged from the priesthood . For I am Jehovah !
TLB	Leviticus	22	4	“ No priest who is a leper or who has a running sore may eat the holy sacrifices until healed . And any priest who touches a dead person , or who is defiled by a seminal emission ,
TLB	Leviticus	22	5	or who touches any reptile or other forbidden thing , or who touches anyone who is ceremonially defiled for any reason—
TLB	Leviticus	22	6	that priest shall be defiled until evening and shall not eat of the holy sacrifices until after he has bathed that evening .
TLB	Leviticus	22	7	When the sun is down , then he shall be purified again and may eat the holy food , for it is his source of life .
TLB	Leviticus	22	8	He may not eat any animal that dies of itself or is torn by wild animals , for this will defile him . I am Jehovah .
TLB	Leviticus	22	9	Warn the priests to follow these instructions carefully , lest they be declared guilty and die for violating these rules . I am the Lord who sanctifies them .
TLB	Leviticus	22	10	“ No one may eat of the holy sacrifices unless he is a priest ; no one visiting the priest , for instance , nor a hired servant , may eat this food .
TLB	Leviticus	22	11	However , there is one exception—if the priest buys a slave with his own money , that slave may eat it , and any slave children born in his household may eat it .
TLB	Leviticus	22	12	If a priest ’ s daughter is married outside the tribe , she may not eat the sacred offerings . [ a ]
TLB	Leviticus	22	13	But if she is a widow or divorced and has no son to support her , and has returned home to her father ’ s household , she may eat of her father ’ s food again . But otherwise , no one who is not in the priestly families may eat this food .
TLB	Leviticus	22	14	“ If someone should eat of the holy sacrifices without realizing it , he shall return to the priest the amount he has used , with
TLB	Leviticus	22	20	Anything that has a defect must not be offered , for it will not be accepted .
TLB	Leviticus	22	15	for the holy sacrifices brought by the people of Israel must not be defiled by being eaten by unauthorized persons , for these sacrifices have been offered to the Lord .
TLB	Leviticus	22	16	Anyone who violates this law is guilty and is in great danger because he has eaten the sacred offerings ; for I am Jehovah who sanctifies the offerings. ” 17-18 And the Lord said to Moses , “ Tell Aaron and his sons and all the people of Israel that if an Israelite or other person living among you offers a burnt offering sacrifice to the Lord—whether it is to fulfill a promise or is a spontaneous freewill offering—
TLB	Leviticus	22	19	it will only be acceptable to the Lord if it is a male animal without defect ; it must be a young bull or a sheep or a goat .
TLB	Leviticus	22	21	“ Anyone sacrificing a peace offering to the Lord from the herd or flock , whether to fulfill a vow or as a voluntary offering , must sacrifice an animal that has no defect , or it will not be accepted :
TLB	Leviticus	22	23	If the young bull or lamb presented to the Lord has anything superfluous or lacking in its body parts , it may be offered as a freewill offering , but not for a vow .
TLB	Leviticus	22	24	An animal that has injured genitals—crushed or castrated—shall not be offered to the Lord at any time .
TLB	Leviticus	22	25	This restriction applies to the sacrifices made by foreigners among you as well as those made by yourselves , for no defective animal is acceptable for this sacrifice. ” 26-27 And the Lord said to Moses , “ When a bullock , sheep , or goat is born , it shall be left with its mother for seven days , but from the eighth day onward it is acceptable as a sacrifice by fire to the Lord .
TLB	Leviticus	22	28	You shall not slaughter a mother animal and her offspring the same day , whether she is a cow or ewe . 29-30 When you offer the Lord a sacrifice of thanksgiving , you must do it in the right way , eating the sacrificial animal the same day it is slain . Leave none of it for the following day . I am the Lord .

TLB	Leviticus	23	23	1-2 The Lord said to Moses , “ Announce to the people of Israel that they are to celebrate several annual festivals of the Lord—times when all Israel will assemble and worship me .
TLB	Leviticus	23	3	( These are in addition to your Sabbaths [ a ] —the seventh day of every week—which are always days of rest in every home , times for assembling to worship , and for resting from the normal business of the week . )
TLB	Leviticus	23	4	These are the holy festivals which are to be observed each year :
TLB	Leviticus	23	5	“ The Passover of the Lord : This is to be celebrated on the first day of April , [ b ] beginning at sundown .
TLB	Leviticus	23	6	“ The Festival of Unleavened Bread : This is to be celebrated beginning the day following the Passover , and for seven days you must not eat any bread made with yeast .
TLB	Leviticus	23	7	On the first day of this festival , you shall gather the people for worship , and all ordinary work shall cease . [ c ]
TLB	Leviticus	23	8	You shall do the same on the seventh day of the festival . On each of the intervening days you shall make an offering by fire to the Lord . 9-11 “ The Festival of First Fruits : When you arrive in the land I will give you and you reap your first harvest , bring the first sheaf of the harvest to the priest on the day after the Sabbath . He shall wave it before the Lord in a gesture of offering , and it will be accepted by the Lord as your gift .
TLB	Leviticus	23	12	That same day you shall sacrifice to the Lord a male yearling lamb without defect as a burnt offering .
TLB	Leviticus	23	13	A grain offering shall accompany it , consisting of a fifth of a bushel of finely ground flour mixed with olive oil , to be offered by fire to the Lord ; this will be very pleasant to him . Also offer a drink offering consisting of three pints of wine .
TLB	Leviticus	23	14	Until this is done you must not eat any of the harvest for yourselves—neither fresh kernels nor bread nor parched grain . This is a permanent law throughout your nation . 15-16 “ The Harvest Festival ( Festival of Pentecost ) : Fifty days later you shall bring to the Lord an offering of a sample of the new grain of your later crops .
TLB	Leviticus	23	17	This shall consist of two loaves of bread from your homes to be waved before the Lord in a gesture of offering . Bake this bread from a fifth of a bushel of fine flour containing yeast . It is an offering to the Lord of the first sampling of your later crops . [ d ]
TLB	Leviticus	23	18	Along with the bread and the wine , you shall sacrifice as burnt offerings to the Lord seven yearling lambs without defects , one young bull , and two rams . All are fire offerings , very acceptable to Jehovah . [ e ]
TLB	Leviticus	23	19	And you shall offer one male goat for a sin offering and two male yearling lambs for a peace offering .
TLB	Leviticus	23	20	“ The priests shall wave these offerings before the Lord along with the loaves representing the first sampling of your later crops . They are holy to the Lord and will be given to the priests as food .
TLB	Leviticus	23	21	That day shall be announced as a time of sacred convocation of all the people ; don ’ t do any work that day . This is a law to be honored from generation to generation .
TLB	Leviticus	23	22	( When you reap your harvests , you must not thoroughly reap all the corners of the fields , nor pick up the fallen grain ; leave it for the poor and for foreigners living among you who have no land of their own ; I am Jehovah your God ! ) 23-24 “ The Festival of Trumpets : Mid-September [ f ] is a time for all the people to meet together for worship ; it is a time of remembrance , and is to be announced by loud blowing of trumpets .
TLB	Leviticus	23	25	Don ’ t do any hard work on that day , but offer a sacrifice by fire to the Lord . 26-27 “ The Day of Atonement follows nine days later : [ g ] All the people are to come together before the Lord , saddened by their sin ; and they shall offer sacrifices by fire to the Lord .
TLB	Leviticus	23	28	Don ’ t do any work that day , for it is a special day for making atonement before the Lord your God .
TLB	Leviticus	23	29	Anyone who does not spend the day in repentance and sorrow for sin shall be excommunicated from his people . 30-31 And I will put to death anyone who does any kind of work that day . This is a law of Israel from generation to generation .
TLB	Leviticus	23	32	For this is a Sabbath of rest , and in it you shall go without food and be filled with sorrow ; this time for atonement begins in the evening and continues through the next day . 33-34 “ The Festival of Shelters : Five days later , on the last day of September , [ h ] is the Festival of Shelters to be celebrated before the Lord for seven days .
TLB	Leviticus	23	35	On the first day there will be a sacred assembly of all the people ; don ’ t do any hard work that day .
TLB	Leviticus	23	36	On each of the seven days of the festival you are to sacrifice an offering by fire to the Lord . The eighth day requires another sacred convocation of all the people , at which time there will again be an offering by fire to the Lord . It is the closing assembly , and no regular work is permitted .
TLB	Leviticus	23	37	“ ( These , then , are the regular annual festivals—sacred convocations of all people—when offerings to the Lord are to be made by fire .
TLB	Leviticus	23	38	These annual festivals are in addition to your regular Sabbaths—the weekly days of holy rest . The sacrifices made during the festivals are to be in addition to your regular giving and normal fulfillment of your vows . )
TLB	Leviticus	23	39	“ This last day of September , at the end of your harvesting , is the time to begin to celebrate this seven-day festival before the Lord . Remember that the first and last days of the festival are special days of rest .
TLB	Leviticus	23	40	On the first day , take boughs of fruit trees laden with fruit , and palm fronds , and the boughs of leafy trees—such as willows that grow by the brooks—and build shelters with them , [ i ] rejoicing before the Lord your God for seven days .
TLB	Leviticus	23	41	This seven-day annual feast is a law from generation to generation .
TLB	Leviticus	23	42	During those seven days , all of you who are native Israelites are to live in these shelters .
TLB	Leviticus	23	43	The purpose of this is to remind the people of Israel , generation after generation , that I rescued you from Egypt , and caused you to live in shelters . I am Jehovah your God. ”

TLB	Leviticus	24	24	1-2 The Lord said to Moses , “ Tell the people of Israel to bring you pure olive oil for an eternal flame 3-4 in the lampstand of pure gold which stands outside the veil that secludes the Holy of Holies . Each morning and evening Aaron shall supply it with fresh oil and trim the wicks . It will be an eternal flame before the Lord from generation to generation . 5-8 “ Every Sabbath day the High Priest shall place twelve loaves of bread in two rows upon the gold table that stands before the Lord . These loaves shall be baked from finely ground flour , using a fifth of a bushel for each . Pure frankincense shall be sprinkled along each row . This will be a memorial offering made by fire to the Lord , in memory of his everlasting covenant with the people of Israel .
TLB	Leviticus	24	9	The bread shall be eaten by Aaron and his sons , in a place set apart for the purpose . For these are offerings made by fire to the Lord under a permanent law of God and are most holy. ”
TLB	Leviticus	24	10	Out in the camp one day , a young man whose mother was an Israelite and whose father was an Egyptian got into a fight with one of the men of Israel .
TLB	Leviticus	24	11	During the fight the Egyptian man ’ s son [ a ] cursed God , and was brought to Moses for judgment . ( His mother ’ s name was Shelomith , daughter of Dibri of the tribe of Dan . )
TLB	Leviticus	24	12	He was put in jail until the Lord would indicate what to do with him . 13-14 And the Lord said to Moses , “ Take him outside the camp and tell all who heard him to lay their hands upon his head ; then all the people are to execute him by stoning . 15-16 And tell the people of Israel that anyone who curses his God must pay the penalty : he must die . All the congregation shall stone him ; this law applies to the foreigner as well as to the Israelite who blasphemes the name of Jehovah . He must die .
TLB	Leviticus	24	17	“ Also , all murderers must be executed .
TLB	Leviticus	24	18	Anyone who kills an animal that isn ’ t his [ b ] shall replace it .
TLB	Leviticus	24	19	The penalty for injuring anyone is to be injured in exactly the same way :
TLB	Leviticus	24	20	fracture for fracture , eye for eye , tooth for tooth . Whatever anyone does to another shall be done to him .
TLB	Leviticus	24	21	“ To repeat , whoever kills an animal must replace it , and whoever kills a man must die .
TLB	Leviticus	24	22	You shall have the same law for the foreigner as for the home-born citizen , for I am Jehovah your God. ”
TLB	Leviticus	24	23	So they took the youth out of the camp and stoned him until he died , as Jehovah had commanded Moses .

TLB	Leviticus	25	3	For six years you may sow your field and prune your vineyards and harvest your crops ,
TLB	Leviticus	25	4	but during the seventh year the land is to lie fallow before the Lord , uncultivated . Don ’ t sow your crops and don ’ t prune your vineyards during that entire year .
TLB	Leviticus	25	5	Don ’ t even reap for yourself the volunteer crops that come up , and don ’ t gather the grapes for yourself ; for it is a year of rest for the land . 6-7 Any crops that do grow that year shall be free to all—for you , your servants , your slaves , and any foreigners living among you . Cattle and wild animals alike shall be allowed to graze there .
TLB	Leviticus	25	8	“ Every fiftieth year ,
TLB	Leviticus	25	9	on the Day of Atonement , [ a ] let the trumpets blow loud and long throughout the land .
TLB	Leviticus	25	10	For the fiftieth year shall be holy , a time to proclaim liberty throughout the land to all enslaved debtors , and a time for the canceling of all public and private debts . It shall be a year when all the family estates sold to others shall be returned to the original owners or their heirs .
TLB	Leviticus	25	11	“ What a happy year it will be ! In it you shall not sow , nor gather crops nor grapes ;
TLB	Leviticus	25	12	for it is a holy Year of Jubilee for you . That year your food shall be the volunteer crops that grow wild in the fields .
TLB	Leviticus	25	13	Yes , during the Year of Jubilee everyone shall return home to his original family possession ; if he has sold it , it shall be his again ! 14-16 Because of this , if the land is sold or bought during the preceding forty-nine years , a fair price shall be arrived at by counting the number of years until the Jubilee . If the Jubilee is many years away , the price will be high ; if few years , the price will be low ; for what you are really doing is selling the number of crops the new owner will get from the land before it is returned to you . 17-18 “ You must fear your God and not overcharge ! For I am Jehovah . Obey my laws if you want to live safely in the land .
TLB	Leviticus	25	19	When you obey , the land will yield bumper crops and you can eat your fill in safety .
TLB	Leviticus	25	20	But you will ask , ‘ What shall we eat the seventh year , since we are not allowed to plant or harvest crops that year ? ’ 21-22 The answer is , ‘ I will bless you with bumper crops the sixth year that will last you until the crops of the eighth year are harvested ! ’
TLB	Leviticus	25	23	And remember , the land is mine , so you may not sell it permanently . You are merely my tenants and sharecroppers !
TLB	Leviticus	25	24	“ In every contract of sale there must be a stipulation that the land can be redeemed at any time by the seller .
TLB	Leviticus	25	26	If there is no one else to redeem it , and he himself gets together enough money ,
TLB	Leviticus	25	27	then he may always buy it back at a price proportionate to the number of harvests until the Jubilee , and the owner must accept the money and return the land to him .
TLB	Leviticus	25	28	But if the original owner is not able to redeem it , then it shall belong to the new owner until the Year of Jubilee ; but at the Jubilee year it must be returned again .
TLB	Leviticus	25	29	“ If a man sells a house in the city , [ b ] he has up to one year to redeem it , with full right of redemption during that time .
TLB	Leviticus	25	30	But if it is not redeemed within the year , then it will belong permanently to the new owner—it does not return to the original owner in the Year of Jubilee .
TLB	Leviticus	25	31	But village houses—a village is a settlement without fortifying walls around it—are like farmland , redeemable at any time , and are always returned to the original owner in the Year of Jubilee .
TLB	Leviticus	25	32	“ There is one exception : The homes of the Levites , even though in walled cities , may be redeemed at any time ,
TLB	Leviticus	25	33	and must be returned to the original owners in the Year of Jubilee ; for the Levites will not be given farmland like the other tribes , but will receive only houses in their cities , and the surrounding fields . [ c ]
TLB	Leviticus	25	34	The Levites are not permitted to sell the fields of common land surrounding their cities , for these are their permanent possession , and they must belong to no one else .
TLB	Leviticus	25	35	“ If your brother becomes poor , you are responsible to help him ; invite him to live with you as a guest in your home .
TLB	Leviticus	25	36	Fear your God and let your brother live with you ; and don ’ t charge him interest on the money you lend him .
TLB	Leviticus	25	37	Remember—no interest ; and give him what he needs , at your cost : don ’ t try to make a profit !
TLB	Leviticus	25	38	For I , the Lord your God , brought you out of the land of Egypt to give you the land of Canaan , and to be your God .
TLB	Leviticus	25	39	“ If a fellow Israelite becomes poor and sells himself to you , you must not treat him as an ordinary slave ,
TLB	Leviticus	25	40	but rather as a hired servant or as a guest ; and he shall serve you only until the Year of Jubilee .
TLB	Leviticus	25	41	At that time he can leave with his children and return to his own family and possessions .
TLB	Leviticus	25	42	For I brought you from the land of Egypt , and you are my servants ; so you may not be sold as ordinary slaves
TLB	Leviticus	25	43	or treated harshly ; fear your God .
TLB	Leviticus	25	44	“ However , you may purchase slaves from the foreign nations living around you ,
TLB	Leviticus	25	45	and you may purchase the children of the foreigners living among you , even though they have been born in your land .
TLB	Leviticus	25	46	They will be permanent slaves for you to pass on to your children after you ; but your brothers , the people of Israel , shall not be treated so .
TLB	Leviticus	25	47	“ If a foreigner living among you becomes rich , and an Israelite becomes poor and sells himself to the foreigner or to the foreigner ’ s family ,
TLB	Leviticus	25	48	he may be redeemed by one of his brothers ,
TLB	Leviticus	25	49	his uncle , nephew , or anyone else who is a near relative . He may also redeem himself if he can find the money .
TLB	Leviticus	25	50	The price of his freedom shall be in proportion to the number of years left before the Year of Jubilee—whatever it would cost to hire a servant for that number of years .
TLB	Leviticus	25	51	If there are still many years until the Jubilee , he shall pay almost the amount he received when he sold himself ;
TLB	Leviticus	25	52	if the years have passed and only a few remain until the Jubilee , then he will repay only a small part of the amount he received when he sold himself .
TLB	Leviticus	25	53	If he sells himself to a foreigner , the foreigner must treat him as a hired servant rather than as a slave or as property .
TLB	Leviticus	25	54	If he has not been redeemed by the time the Year of Jubilee arrives , then he and his children shall be freed at that time .
TLB	Leviticus	25	55	For the people of Israel are my servants ; I brought them from the land of Egypt ; I am the Lord your God .

TLB	Leviticus	26	26	I will destroy your food supply so that one oven will be large enough to bake all the bread available for ten entire families ; and you will still be hungry after your pittance has been doled out to you .
TLB	Leviticus	26	2	You must obey my Sabbath laws of rest , and reverence my Tabernacle , for I am the Lord .
TLB	Leviticus	26	3	“ If you obey all of my commandments , 4-5 I will give you regular rains , and the land will yield bumper crops , and the trees will be loaded with fruit long after the normal time ! [ a ] And grapes will still be ripening when sowing time comes again . You shall eat your fill , and live safely in the land ,
TLB	Leviticus	26	6	for I will give you peace , and you will go to sleep without fear . I will chase away the dangerous animals .
TLB	Leviticus	26	7	You will chase your enemies ; they will die beneath your swords .
TLB	Leviticus	26	8	Five of you will chase a hundred , and a hundred of you , ten thousand ! You will defeat all of your enemies .
TLB	Leviticus	26	9	I will look after you , and multiply you , and fulfill my covenant with you .
TLB	Leviticus	26	10	You will have such a surplus of crops that you won ’ t know what to do with them when the new harvest is ready !
TLB	Leviticus	26	11	And I will live among you and not despise you .
TLB	Leviticus	26	12	I will walk among you and be your God , and you shall be my people .
TLB	Leviticus	26	13	For I am the Lord your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt , so that you would be slaves no longer ; I have broken your chains so that you can walk with dignity . [ b ]
TLB	Leviticus	26	14	“ But if you will not listen to me or obey me ,
TLB	Leviticus	26	15	but reject my laws ,
TLB	Leviticus	26	16	this is what I will do to you : I will punish you with sudden terrors and panic , and with tuberculosis and burning fever ; your eyes shall be consumed and your life shall ebb away ; you will sow your crops in vain , for your enemies will eat them .
TLB	Leviticus	26	17	I will set my face against you and you will flee before your attackers ; those who hate you will rule you ; you will even run when no one is chasing you !
TLB	Leviticus	26	18	“ And if you still disobey me , I will punish you seven times more severely for your sins .
TLB	Leviticus	26	19	I will break your proud power and make your heavens as iron and your earth as bronze .
TLB	Leviticus	26	20	Your strength shall be spent in vain ; for your land shall not yield its crops , nor your trees their fruit .
TLB	Leviticus	26	21	“ And if even then you will not obey me and listen to me , I will send you seven times more plagues because of your sins .
TLB	Leviticus	26	22	I will send wild animals to kill your children and destroy your cattle and reduce your numbers so that your roads will be deserted .
TLB	Leviticus	26	23	“ And if even this will not reform you , but you continue to walk against my wishes ,
TLB	Leviticus	26	24	then I will walk against your wishes , and I , even I , will personally smite you seven times for your sin .
TLB	Leviticus	26	25	I will revenge the breaking of my covenant by bringing war against you . You will flee to your cities , and I will send a plague among you there ; and you will be conquered by your enemies .
TLB	Leviticus	26	27	“ And if you still won ’ t listen to me or obey me ,
TLB	Leviticus	26	28	then I will let loose my great anger and send you seven times greater punishment for your sins .
TLB	Leviticus	26	29	You shall eat your own sons and daughters ,
TLB	Leviticus	26	30	and I will destroy the altars on the hills where you worship your idols , and I will cut down your incense altars , leaving your dead bodies to rot among your idols ; and I will abhor you .
TLB	Leviticus	26	31	I will make your cities desolate , and destroy your places of worship , and will not respond to your incense offerings .
TLB	Leviticus	26	32	Yes , I will desolate your land ; your enemies shall live in it , utterly amazed at what I have done to you .
TLB	Leviticus	26	33	“ I will scatter you out among the nations , destroying you with war as you go . Your land shall be desolate and your cities destroyed . 34-35 Then at last the land will rest and make up for the many years you refused to let it lie idle ; for it will lie desolate all the years that you are captives in enemy lands . Yes , then the land will rest and enjoy its Sabbaths ! It will make up for the rest you didn ’ t give it every seventh year when you lived upon it .
TLB	Leviticus	26	36	“ And for those who are left alive , I will cause them to be dragged away to distant lands as prisoners of war and slaves . There they will live in constant fear . The sound of a leaf driven in the wind will send them fleeing as though chased by a man with a sword ; they shall fall when no one is pursuing them .
TLB	Leviticus	26	37	Yes , though none pursue they shall stumble over each other in flight , as though fleeing in battle , with no power to stand before their enemies .
TLB	Leviticus	26	38	You shall perish among the nations and be destroyed among your enemies .
TLB	Leviticus	26	39	Those left shall pine away in enemy lands because of their sins , the same sins as those of their fathers . 40-41 “ But at last they shall confess their sins and their fathers ’ sins of treachery against me . ( Because they were against me , I was against them , and brought them into the land of their enemies . ) When at last their evil hearts are humbled and they accept the punishment I send them for their sins ,
TLB	Leviticus	26	42	then I will remember again my promises to Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , and I will remember the land ( and its desolation ) .
TLB	Leviticus	26	43	For the land shall enjoy its Sabbaths as it lies desolate . But then at last they shall accept their punishment for rejecting my laws and for despising my rule .
TLB	Leviticus	26	44	But despite all they have done , I will not utterly destroy them and my covenant with them , for I am Jehovah their God .
TLB	Leviticus	26	45	For their sakes I will remember my promises to their ancestors to be their God . For I brought their forefathers out of Egypt as all the nations watched in wonder . I am Jehovah. ”

TLB	Leviticus	27	13	If the animal is a kind that may be offered as a sacrifice , [ b ] but the man wants to redeem it , then he shall pay

TLB	Numbers	1	1	It was on the fifteenth day of April [ a ] of the second year after the Israelis left Egypt that the Lord issued the following instructions to Moses . ( He was in the Tabernacle at the camp of Israel on the Sinai peninsula at the time . ) 2-15 “ Take a census of all the men twenty years old and older who are able to go to war , indicating their tribe and family . You and Aaron are to direct the project , assisted by these leaders from each tribe ” : |Tribe||Leader| |Reuben||Elizur ( son of Shedeur ) | |Simeon||Shelumiel ( son of Zurishaddai ) | |Judah||Nahshon ( son of Amminadab ) | |Issachar||Nethanel ( son of Zuar ) | |Zebulun||Eliab ( son of Helon ) | |Ephraim ( son of Joseph ) ||Elishama ( son of Ammihud ) | |Manasseh ( son of Joseph ) ||Gamaliel ( son of Pedahzur ) | |Benjamin||Abidan ( son of Gideoni ) | |Dan||Ahiezer ( son of Ammishaddai ) | |Asher||Pagiel ( son of Ochran ) | |Gad||Eliasaph ( son of Deuel ) | |Naphtali||Ahira ( son of Enan ) |
TLB	Numbers	1	16	These were the tribal leaders elected from among the people . 17-19 [ b ] On the same day Moses and Aaron and the above-named leaders summoned all the men of Israel who were twenty years old or older to come and register , each man indicating his tribe and family , as the Lord had commanded Moses . 20-46 Here is the final tabulation : |Tribe||Total| |Reuben ( the oldest son of Jacob ) ||46,500| |Simeon||59,300| |Gad||45,650| |Judah||74,600| |Issachar||54,400| |Zebulun||57,400| |Joseph : Ephraim ( son of Joseph ) ||40,500| |Joseph : Manasseh ( son of Joseph ) ||32,200| |Benjamin||35,400| |Dan||62,700| |Asher||41,500| |Naphtali||53,400| Grand Total : 603,550 47-49 This total does not include the Levites , for the Lord had said to Moses , “ Exempt the entire tribe of Levi from the draft , and do not include their number in the census .
TLB	Numbers	1	50	For the Levites are assigned for the work connected with the Tabernacle and its transportation . They are to live near the Tabernacle ,
TLB	Numbers	1	51	and whenever the Tabernacle is moved , the Levites are to take it down and set it up again ; anyone else touching it shall be executed .
TLB	Numbers	1	52	Each tribe of Israel shall have a separate camping area with its own flag .
TLB	Numbers	1	53	The Levites ’ tents shall be clustered around the Tabernacle as a wall between the people of Israel and God ’ s wrath—to protect them from his fierce anger against their sins. ”
TLB	Numbers	1	54	So all these instructions of the Lord to Moses were put into effect . Footnotes - Numbers 1:1 fifteenth day of April , literally , “ on the first day of the second month ” ( of the Jewish calendar ) . So also for vv . 17-19 On the same day . - Numbers 1:17 Added in the Hebrew text is this sentence : “ So he numbered them in the wilderness of Sinai. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Numbers	2	2	1-2 The Lord gave these further instructions to Moses and Aaron : “ Each tribe will have its own tent area , with its flagpole and tribal banner ; and at the center of these tribal compounds will be the Tabernacle. ” 3-31 Here are the tribal locations : [ a ] |Tribe : ||Leader : ||Location : ||Census : | |Judah||Nahshon ( son of Amminadab ) ||East side of Tabernacle||74,600| |Issachar||Nethanel ( son of Zuar ) ||Next to Judah||54,400| |Zebulun||Eliab ( son of Helon ) ||Next to Issachar||57,400| So the total of all those on Judah ’ s side of the camp was 186,400 . These three tribes led the way whenever the Israelites traveled to a new campsite . |Tribe : ||Leader : ||Location : ||Census : | |Reuben||Elizur ( son of Shedeur ) ||South side of Tabernacle||46,500| |Simeon||Shelumiel ( son of Zurishaddai ) ||Next to Reuben||59,300| |Gad||Eliasaph ( son of Reuel ) ||Next to Simeon||45,650| So the total of the Reuben side of the camp was 151,450 . These three tribes were next in line whenever the Israelis traveled . Next in the line of march was the Tabernacle , with the Levites . When traveling , each tribe stayed together under its own flag , just as each was separate from the others in camp . |Tribe : ||Leader : ||Location : ||Census : | |Ephraim||Elishama ( son of Ammihud ) ||West side of Tabernacle||40,500| |Manasseh||Gamaliel ( son of Pedahzur ) ||Next to Ephraim||32,200| |Benjamin||Abidan ( son of Gideoni ) ||Next to Manasseh||35,400| So the total on the Ephraim side of the camp was 108,100 , and they were next in the line of march . |Tribe : ||Leader : ||Location : ||Census : | |Dan||Ahiezer ( son of Ammishaddai ) ||North side of Tabernacle||62,700| |Asher||Pagiel ( son of Ochran ) ||Next to Dan||41,500| |Naphtali||Ahira ( son of Enan ) ||Next to Asher||53,400| So the total on Dan ’ s side of the camp was 157,600 . They brought up the rear whenever Israel traveled . 32-33 In summary , the armies of Israel totaled 603,550 ( not including the Levites , who were exempted by Jehovah ’ s commandment to Moses ) .
TLB	Numbers	2	34	So the people of Israel set up their camps , each tribe under its own banner , in the locations indicated by the Lord to Moses . Footnotes - Numbers 2:3 Here are the tribal locations , implied . Reuel . Deuel in ch .

TLB	Numbers	3	3	All were anointed as priests and set apart to minister at the Tabernacle .
TLB	Numbers	3	2	Aaron ’ s sons were : [ a ] Nadab ( his oldest ) , Abihu , Eleazar , Ithamar .
TLB	Numbers	3	4	But Nadab and Abihu died before the Lord in the wilderness of Sinai when they used unholy fire . And since they had no children , this left only Eleazar and Ithamar to assist their father , Aaron .
TLB	Numbers	3	5	Then the Lord said to Moses ,
TLB	Numbers	3	6	“ Summon the tribe of Levi and present them to Aaron as his assistants . 7-9 They will follow his instructions and perform the sacred duties at the Tabernacle on behalf of all the people of Israel . For they are assigned to him as representatives of all the people of Israel . They are in charge of all the furnishings and maintenance of the Tabernacle .
TLB	Numbers	3	10	However , only Aaron and his sons may carry out the duties of the priesthood ; anyone else who presumes to assume this office shall be executed. ” 11-12 And the Lord said to Moses , “ I have accepted the Levites in substitution for all the oldest sons of the people of Israel . The Levites are mine
TLB	Numbers	3	13	in exchange for all the oldest sons . From the day I killed all the oldest sons of the Egyptians , I took for myself all the firstborn in Israel of both men and animals ! They are mine ; I am Jehovah. ” 14-15 The Lord now spoke again to Moses at the Sinai peninsula , telling him , “ Take a census of the tribe of Levi , indicating each person ’ s clan ; count every male down to one month old. ” 16-24 So Moses did : |Levi ’ s son||Levi ’ s grandsons ( clan names ) ||Census||Leader||Camp Location| |Gershon||Libni , Shimei||7,500||Elisaph ( son of Lael ) ||West side of Tabernacle| 25-30 Responsibilities : The responsibility of these two clans of Levites was the care of the Tabernacle : its coverings , its entry drapes , the drapes covering the fence surrounding the courtyard , the screen at the entrance of the courtyard surrounding the Tabernacle , the altar , and all the ropes used in tying the Tabernacle together . |Levi ’ s son||Levi ’ s grandsons ( clan names ) ||Census||Leader||Camp Location| |Kohath||Amran , Izhar , Hebron , Uzziel||8,600||Elizaphan ( son of Uzziel ) ||South side of Tabernacle| 31-35 Responsibilities : The responsibility of these four clans of Levites was the care of the Ark , the table , the lampstand , the altars , the various utensils used in the Tabernacle , the veil , and any repairs needed on any of these items . ( Note : Eleazar , Aaron ’ s son , shall be the chief administrator over the leaders of the Levites , with special responsibility for the oversight of the sanctuary . ) |Levi ’ s son||Levi ’ s grandsons ( clan names ) ||Census||Leader||Camp Location| |Merari||Mahli , Mushi||6,200||Zuriel ( son of Abihail ) ||North side of Tabernacle| 36-37 Responsibilities : The responsibility of these two clans was the care of the frames of the Tabernacle building ; the posts ; the bases for the posts , and all of the equipment needed for their use ; the posts around the courtyard and their bases , pegs , and ropes .
TLB	Numbers	3	38	The area east of the Tabernacle was reserved for the tents of Moses and of Aaron and his sons , who had the final responsibility for the Tabernacle on behalf of the people of Israel . ( Anyone who was not a priest or Levite , but came into the Tabernacle , was to be executed . )
TLB	Numbers	3	39	So all the Levites , as numbered by Moses and Aaron at the command of the Lord , were 22,000 males one month old and older .
TLB	Numbers	3	40	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Now take a census of all the eldest sons in Israel who are one month old and older , and register each name .
TLB	Numbers	3	41	The Levites shall be mine ( I am Jehovah ) as substitutes for the eldest sons of Israel ; and the Levites ’ cattle are mine as substitutes for the firstborn cattle of the whole nation. ”
TLB	Numbers	3	42	So Moses took a census of the eldest sons of the people of Israel , as the Lord had commanded ,
TLB	Numbers	3	43	and found the total number of eldest sons one month old and older to be 22,273 .
TLB	Numbers	3	44	Now the Lord said to Moses ,
TLB	Numbers	3	45	“ Give me the Levites instead of the eldest sons of the people of Israel ; and give me the cattle of the Levites instead of the firstborn cattle of the people of Israel ; yes , the Levites shall be mine ; I am Jehovah .
TLB	Numbers	3	46	To redeem the
TLB	Numbers	3	273	eldest sons of Israel who were in excess of the number of Levites . ( All the others were redeemed because the Levites had been given to the Lord in their place . )
TLB	Numbers	3	49	So Moses received redemption money for the
TLB	Numbers	3	50	The money collected came to a total of $ 1,365 . Footnotes - Numbers 3:2 Aaron ’ s sons were , literally , “ These are the generations of Aaron and Moses. ” - Numbers 3:50 $ 1,365 , literally , “ 1,365 shekels after the shekel of the sanctuary. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Numbers	4	4	These are their sacred duties :
TLB	Numbers	4	3	This census will be of all males from ages thirty to fifty who are able to work in the Tabernacle .
TLB	Numbers	4	5	“ When the camp moves , Aaron and his sons will enter the Tabernacle first and take down the veil and cover the Ark with it .
TLB	Numbers	4	6	Then they will cover the veil with goatskin leather , cover the goatskins with a blue cloth , and place the carrying poles of the Ark in their rings .
TLB	Numbers	4	7	“ Next they must spread a blue cloth over the table where the Bread of the Presence is displayed , and place the dishes , spoons , bowls , cups , and the Bread upon the cloth .
TLB	Numbers	4	8	They will spread a scarlet cloth over that , and finally a covering of goatskin leather on top of the scarlet cloth . Then they shall insert the carrying poles into the table .
TLB	Numbers	4	9	“ Next they must cover with a blue cloth the lampstand , the lamps , snuffers , trays , and the reservoir of olive oil .
TLB	Numbers	4	10	This entire group of objects shall then be covered with goatskin leather , and the bundle shall be placed upon a carrying frame .
TLB	Numbers	4	11	“ They must then spread a blue cloth over the gold altar , cover it with a covering of goatskin leather , and insert the carrying poles into the altar .
TLB	Numbers	4	12	All of the remaining utensils of the Tabernacle are to be wrapped in a blue cloth , covered with goatskin leather , and placed on the carrying frame .
TLB	Numbers	4	13	“ The ashes are to be removed from the altar , and the altar shall be covered with a purple cloth .
TLB	Numbers	4	14	All of the altar utensils are to be placed upon the cloth—the firepans , hooks , shovels , basins , and other containers—and a cover of goatskin leather will be spread over them . Finally , the carrying poles are to be put in place .
TLB	Numbers	4	15	When Aaron and his sons have finished packing the sanctuary and all the utensils , the clan of Kohath shall come and carry the units to wherever the camp is traveling ; but they must not touch the holy items , lest they die . This , then , is the sacred work of the sons of Kohath .
TLB	Numbers	4	16	“ Aaron ’ s son Eleazar shall be responsible for the oil for the light , the sweet incense , the daily grain offering , and the anointing oil—in fact , the supervision of the entire Tabernacle and everything in it will be his responsibility. ” 17-19 Then the Lord said to Moses and Aaron , “ Don ’ t let the families of Kohath destroy themselves ! This is what you must do so that they will not die when they carry the most holy things : Aaron and his sons shall go in with them and point out what each is to carry .
TLB	Numbers	4	20	Otherwise they must never enter the sanctuary for even a moment , lest they look at the sacred objects there and die. ” 21-23 And the Lord said to Moses , “ Take a census of the Gershonite division of the tribe of Levi , all of the men between the ages of thirty and fifty who are eligible for the sacred work of the Tabernacle .
TLB	Numbers	4	24	These will be their duties :
TLB	Numbers	4	25	“ They will carry the curtains of the Tabernacle , the Tabernacle itself with its coverings , the goatskin leather roof , and the curtain for the Tabernacle entrance .
TLB	Numbers	4	26	They are also to carry the drapes covering the courtyard fence , and the curtain across the entrance to the courtyard that surrounds the altar and the Tabernacle . They will also carry the altar , the ropes , and all of the accessories . They are fully responsible for the transportation of these items .
TLB	Numbers	4	27	Aaron or any of his sons may assign the Gershonites ’ tasks to them ,
TLB	Numbers	4	28	but the Gershonites will be directly responsible to Aaron ’ s son Ithamar .
TLB	Numbers	4	29	“ Now take a census of the Merari division of the Levite tribe , all of the men from thirty to fifty who are eligible for the Tabernacle service . 30-31 When the Tabernacle is moved , they are to carry the frames of the Tabernacle , the bars , the bases ,
TLB	Numbers	4	32	the frames for the courtyard fence with their bases , pegs , cords , and everything else connected with their use and repair . Assign duties to each man by name .
TLB	Numbers	4	33	The Merari division will also report to Aaron ’ s son Ithamar. ”
TLB	Numbers	4	34	So Moses and Aaron and the other leaders took a census of the Kohath division ,
TLB	Numbers	4	35	including all of the men thirty to fifty years of age who were eligible for the Tabernacle service ,
TLB	Numbers	4	36	and found that the total number was 2,750 .
TLB	Numbers	4	37	All this was done to carry out the Lord ’ s instructions to Moses . 38-41 A similar census of the Gershon division totaled 2,630 . 42-45 And of the Merari division , 3,200 . 46-48 Thus Moses and Aaron and the leaders of Israel found that the total of all the Levites who were thirty to fifty years old and who were eligible for the Tabernacle service and transportation was 8,580 .

TLB	Numbers	5	5	1-2 These are further instructions from the Lord to Moses : “ Inform the people of Israel that they must expel all lepers from the camp , and all who have open sores , or who have been defiled by touching a dead person .
TLB	Numbers	5	3	This applies to men and women alike . Remove them so that they will not defile the camp where I live among you. ”
TLB	Numbers	5	4	These instructions were put into effect . 5-6 Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Tell the people of Israel that when anyone , man or woman , betrays the Lord by betraying a trust , it is sin .
TLB	Numbers	5	7	He must confess his sin and make full repayment for what he has stolen , [ a ] adding
TLB	Numbers	5	20	But if you have committed adultery , 21-22 then Jehovah shall make you a curse among your people , for he will make your thigh rot away and your body swell. ’ And the woman shall be required to say , ‘ Yes , let it be so. ’
TLB	Numbers	5	8	But if the person he wronged is dead , [ b ] and there is no near relative to whom the payment can be made , it must be given to the priest , along with a lamb for atonement . 9-10 When the people of Israel bring a gift to the Lord it shall go to the priests. ” 11-12 And the Lord said to Moses , “ Tell the people of Israel that if a man ’ s wife commits adultery ,
TLB	Numbers	5	13	but there is no proof , there being no witness ,
TLB	Numbers	5	14	and he is jealous and suspicious ,
TLB	Numbers	5	15	the man shall bring his wife to the priest with an offering for her of a tenth of a bushel of barley meal without oil or frankincense mingled with it—for it is a suspicion offering—to bring out the truth [ c ] as to whether or not she is guilty .
TLB	Numbers	5	16	“ The priest shall bring her before the Lord ,
TLB	Numbers	5	17	and take holy water in a clay jar and mix into it dust from the floor of the Tabernacle .
TLB	Numbers	5	18	He shall unbind her hair and place the suspicion offering in her hands to determine whether or not her husband ’ s suspicions are justified . The priest shall stand before her holding the jar of bitter water that brings a curse .
TLB	Numbers	5	19	He shall require her to swear that she is innocent , and then he shall say to her , ‘ If no man has slept with you except your husband , be free from the effects of this bitter water that causes the curse .
TLB	Numbers	5	23	Then the priest shall write these curses in a book and wash them off into the bitter water .
TLB	Numbers	5	24	( When he requires the woman to drink the water , it becomes bitter within her if she is guilty . [ d ] )
TLB	Numbers	5	25	“ Then the priest shall take the suspicion offering from the woman ’ s hand and wave it before Jehovah , and carry it to the altar .
TLB	Numbers	5	26	He shall take a handful , representing all of it , and burn the handful upon the altar , and then require the woman to drink the water .
TLB	Numbers	5	27	If she has been defiled , having committed adultery against her husband , the water will become bitter within her , and her body will swell and her thigh will rot , and she shall be a curse among her people .
TLB	Numbers	5	28	But if she is pure and has not committed adultery , she shall be unharmed and will soon become pregnant .
TLB	Numbers	5	29	“ This , then , is the law concerning a wayward wife—or a husband ’ s suspicions against his wife—
TLB	Numbers	5	30	to determine whether or not she has been unfaithful to him . He shall bring her before the Lord and the priest shall handle the situation as outlined above .
TLB	Numbers	5	31	Her husband shall not be brought to trial for causing her horrible disease , for she is responsible. ” Footnotes - Numbers 5:7 for what he has stolen , literally , “ for his wrong. ” - Numbers 5:8 But if the person he wronged is dead , implied . - Numbers 5:15 a suspicion offering—to bring out the truth , literally , “ an offering of remembrance. ” - Numbers 5:24 if she is guilty , implied .

TLB	Numbers	6	6	1-2 The Lord gave Moses these further instructions for the people of Israel : “ When either a man or a woman takes the special vow of a Nazirite , consecrating himself to the Lord in a special way , 3-4 he must not thereafter , during the entire period of his special consecration to the Lord , taste strong drink or wine or even fresh wine , grape juice , grapes , or raisins ! He may eat nothing that comes from grapevines , not even the seeds or skins !
TLB	Numbers	6	5	“ Throughout that time he must never cut his hair , for he is holy and consecrated to the Lord ; that is why he must let his hair grow . 6-7 “ And he may not go near any dead body during the entire period of his vow , even if it is the body of his father , mother , brother , or sister ; for his vow of consecration remains in effect ,
TLB	Numbers	6	8	and he is consecrated to the Lord throughout the entire period .
TLB	Numbers	6	9	If he is defiled by having someone fall dead beside him , then seven days later he shall shave his defiled head ; he will then be cleansed from the contamination of being in the presence of death .
TLB	Numbers	6	10	The next day , the eighth day , he must bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons to the priest at the entrance of the Tabernacle .
TLB	Numbers	6	11	The priest shall offer one of the birds for a sin offering , and the other for a burnt offering , and make atonement for his defilement . And he must renew his vows that day and let his hair begin to grow again .
TLB	Numbers	6	12	The days of his vow that were fulfilled before his defilement no longer count . He must begin all over again with a new vow , and must bring a male lamb a year old for a guilt offering .
TLB	Numbers	6	13	“ At the conclusion of the period of his vow of separation to the Lord , he must go to the entrance of the Tabernacle
TLB	Numbers	6	14	and offer a burnt sacrifice to the Lord , a year-old lamb without defect . He must also offer a sin offering , a yearling ewe lamb without defect ; a peace offering , a ram without defect ;
TLB	Numbers	6	15	a basket of bread made without yeast ; pancakes made of fine flour mixed with olive oil ; unleavened wafers spread with oil ; and the accompanying grain offering and drink offerings .
TLB	Numbers	6	16	The priest shall present these offerings before the Lord : first the sin offering and the burnt offering ;
TLB	Numbers	6	17	then the ram for a peace offering , along with the basket of bread made without yeast ; and finally the grain offering along with the drink offering .
TLB	Numbers	6	18	“ Then the Nazirite shall shave his long hair—the sign of his vow of separation . This shall be done at the entrance of the Tabernacle , after which the hair shall be put in the fire under the peace offering sacrifice .
TLB	Numbers	6	19	After the man ’ s head has been shaved , the priest shall take the roasted shoulder of the lamb , one of the pancakes ( made without yeast ) , and one of the wafers ( also made without yeast ) , and put them all into the man ’ s hands .
TLB	Numbers	6	20	The priest shall then wave it all back and forth before the Lord in a gesture of offering ; all of it is a holy portion for the priest , as are the rib piece and shoulder that were waved before the Lord . After that the Nazirite may again drink wine , for he is freed from his vow .
TLB	Numbers	6	21	“ These are the regulations concerning a Nazirite and his sacrifices at the conclusion of his period of special dedication . In addition to these sacrifices he must bring any further offering he promised at the time he took his vow to become a Nazirite. ” 22-23 Now the Lord said to Moses , “ Tell Aaron and his sons that they are to give this special blessing to the people of Israel : 24-26 ‘ May the Lord bless and protect you ; may the Lord ’ s face radiate with joy because of you ; may he be gracious to you , show you his favor , and give you his peace. ’
TLB	Numbers	6	27	This is how Aaron and his sons shall call down my blessings [ a ] upon the people of Israel ; and I myself will personally bless them. ” Footnotes - Numbers 6:27 shall call down my blessings , literally , “ shall put my name upon the people of Israel. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Numbers	7	7	Two wagons and four oxen were given to the Gershon division for their use ,
TLB	Numbers	7	2	Then the leaders of Israel—the chiefs of the tribes , the men who had organized the census—brought their offerings .
TLB	Numbers	7	3	They brought six covered wagons , each drawn by two oxen—a wagon for every two leaders and an ox for each one ; and they presented them to the Lord in front of the Tabernacle . 4-5 “ Accept their gifts , ” the Lord told Moses , “ and use these wagons for the work of the Tabernacle . Give them to the Levites for whatever needs they may have. ”
TLB	Numbers	7	6	So Moses presented the wagons and the oxen to the Levites .
TLB	Numbers	7	8	and four wagons and eight oxen were given to the Merari division , which was under the leadership of Ithamar , Aaron ’ s son .
TLB	Numbers	7	9	None of the wagons or teams was given to the Kohath division , for they were required to carry their portion of the Tabernacle upon their shoulders .
TLB	Numbers	7	10	The leaders also presented dedication gifts on the day the altar was anointed , placing them before the altar .
TLB	Numbers	7	11	The Lord said to Moses , “ Let each of them bring his gift on a different day for the dedication of the altar. ”
TLB	Numbers	7	12	male goats .
TLB	Numbers	7	13	It consisted of a silver platter weighing three pounds and a silver bowl of about two pounds , both filled with grain offerings of fine flour mixed with oil .
TLB	Numbers	7	14	He also brought a tiny [ a ] gold box of incense which weighed only about four ounces .
TLB	Numbers	7	15	He brought a young bull , a ram , and a male yearling lamb as burnt offerings ;
TLB	Numbers	7	16	a male goat for a sin offering ;
TLB	Numbers	7	17	and for the peace offerings two oxen , five rams , five male goats , and five male yearling lambs . 18-23 The next day Nethanel , the son of Zuar , chief of the tribe of Issachar , brought his gifts and offerings . They were exactly the same as Nahshon had presented on the previous day . [ b ] 24-29 On the third day Eliab , the son of Helon , chief of the tribe of Zebulun , came with his offerings—the same as those presented on the previous days . 30-35 On the fourth day the gifts were presented by Elizur , son of Shedeur , chief of the tribe of Reuben ; his gifts and offerings were the same as those given on the previous days . 36-41 On the fifth day came Shelumiel , the son of Zurishaddai , chief of the tribe of Simeon , with the same gifts . 42-47 The next day it was Eliasaph ’ s turn , son of Deuel , chief of the tribe of Gad . He , too , offered the same gifts and sacrifices . 48-53 On the seventh day , Elishama , the son of Ammihud , chief of the tribe of Ephraim , brought his gifts , the same as those presented on the previous days . 54-59 Gamaliel , son of Pedahzur , prince of the tribe of Manasseh , came the eighth day with the same offerings . 60-65 On the ninth day it was Abidan the son of Gideoni , chief of the tribe of Benjamin , with his gifts , the same as those offered by the others . 66-71 Ahiezer , the son of Ammishaddai , brought his gifts on the tenth day . He was the chief of the tribe of Dan and his offerings were the same as those on the previous days . 72-77 Pagiel , son of Ochran , chief of the tribe of Asher , brought his gifts on the eleventh day—the same gifts and offerings as the others . 78-83 On the twelfth day came Ahira , son of Enan , chief of the tribe of Naphtali , with his offerings ; they were identical to those brought by the others . 84-86 So , beginning the day the altar was anointed , it was dedicated by these gifts from the chiefs of the tribes of Israel . Their combined offerings were as follows :
TLB	Numbers	7	87	For the burnt offerings they brought :
TLB	Numbers	7	88	For the peace offerings they brought :
TLB	Numbers	7	24	young bulls ,
TLB	Numbers	7	60	male lambs one year old .
TLB	Numbers	7	89	When Moses went into the Tabernacle to speak with God , he heard the Voice speaking to him from above the place of mercy over the Ark , between the statues of the two Guardian Angels .

TLB	Numbers	8	8	Have them bring a young bull and a grain offering of fine flour mingled with oil , along with another young bull for a sin offering .
TLB	Numbers	8	2	“ Tell Aaron that when he lights the seven lamps in the lampstand , he is to set them so that they will throw their light forward. ”
TLB	Numbers	8	3	So Aaron did this .
TLB	Numbers	8	4	The lampstand , including the floral decorations on the base and branches , was made entirely of beaten gold . It was constructed according to the exact design the Lord had shown Moses . 5-6 Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Now set apart the Levites from the other people of Israel .
TLB	Numbers	8	7	Do this by sprinkling water of purification upon them , then having them shave their entire bodies and wash their clothing and themselves .
TLB	Numbers	8	9	Then bring the Levites to the door of the Tabernacle as all the people watch .
TLB	Numbers	8	10	There the leaders [ a ] of the tribes shall lay their hands upon them ,
TLB	Numbers	8	11	and Aaron , with a gesture of offering , shall present them to the Lord as a gift from the entire nation of Israel . The Levites will represent all the people in serving the Lord .
TLB	Numbers	8	12	. The Living Bible copyright ©
TLB	Numbers	8	13	Then the Levites are to be presented to Aaron and his sons , just as any other gift to the Lord is given to the priests !
TLB	Numbers	8	14	In this way you will dedicate the Levites from among the rest of the people of Israel , and the Levites shall be mine .
TLB	Numbers	8	15	After you have sanctified them and presented them in this way , they shall go in and out of the Tabernacle to do their work .
TLB	Numbers	8	16	“ They are mine from among all the people of Israel , and I have accepted them in place of all the firstborn children of the Israelites : I have taken the Levites as their substitutes .
TLB	Numbers	8	17	For all the firstborn among the people of Israel are mine , both men and animals ; I claimed them for myself the night I killed all the firstborn Egyptians .
TLB	Numbers	8	18	Yes , I have accepted the Levites in place of all the eldest sons of Israel .
TLB	Numbers	8	19	And I will give the Levites as a gift to Aaron and his sons . The Levites will carry out the sacred duties required of the people of Israel in the Tabernacle , and will offer the people ’ s sacrifices , making atonement for them . There will be no plague among the Israelites—as there would be if the ordinary people entered the Tabernacle. ”
TLB	Numbers	8	20	So Moses and Aaron and all the people of Israel dedicated the Levites , carefully following Jehovah ’ s instructions to Moses .
TLB	Numbers	8	21	The Levites purified themselves and washed their clothes , and Aaron presented them to the Lord in a gesture of offering . He then performed the rite of atonement over them to purify them .
TLB	Numbers	8	22	After that they went into the Tabernacle as assistants to Aaron and his sons ; everything was done just as the Lord had commanded Moses . 23-24 The Lord also instructed Moses , “ The Levites are to begin serving in the Tabernacle at the age of twenty-five , and are to retire at the age of fifty . 25-26 After retirement they can assist with various light duties in the Tabernacle , but will have no regular responsibilities. ” Footnotes - Numbers 8:10 There the leaders , implied .

TLB	Numbers	9	9	and this was God ’ s reply :
TLB	Numbers	9	8	Moses said he would ask the Lord about it ,
TLB	Numbers	9	10	“ If any of the people of Israel , now or in the generations to come , are defiled at Passover time because of touching a dead body , or if they are on a journey and can not be present , they may still celebrate the Passover , but one month later ,
TLB	Numbers	9	11	on May first , [ b ] beginning in the evening . They are to eat the lamb at that time , with unleavened bread and bitter herbs .
TLB	Numbers	9	12	They must not leave any of it until the next morning , and must not break a bone of it , and must follow all the regular instructions concerning the Passover .
TLB	Numbers	9	13	“ But anyone who is not defiled , and anyone who is not away on a trip , and yet refuses to celebrate the Passover at the regular time , shall be excommunicated from the people of Israel for refusing to sacrifice to Jehovah at the proper time ; he must bear his guilt .
TLB	Numbers	9	14	And if a foreigner is living among you and wants to celebrate the Passover to the Lord , he shall follow all these same instructions . There is one law for all. ”
TLB	Numbers	9	15	On the day the Tabernacle was raised the Cloud covered it ; and that evening the Cloud changed to the appearance of fire , and stayed that way throughout the night .
TLB	Numbers	9	16	It was always so—the daytime Cloud changing to the appearance of fire at night .
TLB	Numbers	9	17	When the Cloud lifted , the people of Israel moved on to wherever it stopped , and camped there .
TLB	Numbers	9	18	In this way they journeyed at the command of the Lord and stopped where he told them to , then remained there as long as the Cloud stayed .
TLB	Numbers	9	19	If it stayed a long time , then they stayed a long time . But if it stayed only a few days , then they remained only a few days ; for so the Lord had instructed them . 20-21 Sometimes the fire-cloud stayed only during the night and moved on the next morning . But day or night , when it moved , the people broke camp and followed .
TLB	Numbers	9	22	If the Cloud stayed above the Tabernacle two days , a month , or a year , that is how long the people of Israel stayed ; but as soon as it moved , they moved .
TLB	Numbers	9	23	So it was that they camped or traveled at the commandment of the Lord ; and whatever the Lord told Moses they should do , they did .

TLB	Numbers	10	10	Use the trumpets in times of gladness , too , blowing them at your annual festivals and at the beginning of each month to rejoice over your burnt offerings and peace offerings . And God will be reminded of his covenant with you . For I am Jehovah , your God. ”
TLB	Numbers	10	3	When both trumpets are blown , the people will know that they are to gather at the entrance of the Tabernacle .
TLB	Numbers	10	4	But if only one is blown , then only the chiefs of the tribes of Israel shall come to you . 5-7 “ Different trumpet blasts will be necessary to distinguish between the summons to assemble and the signal to break camp and move onward . [ a ] When the travel signal is blown , the tribes camped on the east side of the Tabernacle shall leave first ; at the second signal , the tribes on the south shall go .
TLB	Numbers	10	8	Only the priests are permitted to blow the trumpets . This is a permanent instruction to be followed from generation to generation .
TLB	Numbers	10	9	“ When you arrive in the Promised Land and go to war against your enemies , God will hear you and save you from your enemies when you sound the alarm with these trumpets .
TLB	Numbers	10	11	The Cloud lifted from the Tabernacle on the twentieth day of the second month [ b ] of the second year of Israel ’ s leaving Egypt ;
TLB	Numbers	10	12	so the Israelites left the wilderness of Sinai , and followed the Cloud until it stopped in the wilderness of Paran .
TLB	Numbers	10	13	This was their first journey after having received the Lord ’ s travel instructions to Moses .
TLB	Numbers	10	14	At the head of the march was the tribe of Judah grouped behind its flag and led by Nahshon , the son of Amminadab .
TLB	Numbers	10	15	Next came the tribe of Issachar , led by Nethanel , the son of Zuar ,
TLB	Numbers	10	16	and the tribe of Zebulun , led by Eliab , the son of Helon .
TLB	Numbers	10	17	The Tabernacle was taken down and the men of the Gershon and Merari divisions of the tribe of Levi were next in the line of march , carrying the Tabernacle upon their shoulders .
TLB	Numbers	10	18	Then came the flag of the camp of Reuben , with Elizur the son of Shedeur leading his people .
TLB	Numbers	10	19	Next was the tribe of Simeon headed by Shelumiel , the son of Zurishaddai ;
TLB	Numbers	10	20	and the tribe of Gad led by Eliasaph , the son of Deuel .
TLB	Numbers	10	21	Next came the Kohathites carrying the items from the inner sanctuary . ( The Tabernacle was already erected in its new location by the time they arrived . )
TLB	Numbers	10	22	Next in line was the tribe of Ephraim behind its flag , led by Elishama , the son of Ammihud ;
TLB	Numbers	10	23	and the tribe of Manasseh led by Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur ;
TLB	Numbers	10	24	and the tribe of Benjamin , led by Abidan the son of Gideoni .
TLB	Numbers	10	25	Last of all were the tribes headed by the flag of the tribe of Dan under the leadership of Ahiezer , the son of Ammishaddai ;
TLB	Numbers	10	26	the tribe of Asher , led by Pagiel , the son of Ochran ;
TLB	Numbers	10	27	and the tribe of Naphtali , led by Ahira , the son of Enan .
TLB	Numbers	10	28	That was the order in which the tribes traveled .
TLB	Numbers	10	29	One day Moses said to his brother-in-law , Hobab ( son of Reuel , the Midianite ) , “ At last we are on our way to the Promised Land . Come with us and we will do you good ; for the Lord has given wonderful promises to Israel ! ”
TLB	Numbers	10	30	But his brother-in-law replied , “ No , I must return to my own land and kinfolk. ”

TLB	Numbers	10	33	They traveled for three days after leaving Mount Sinai , [ d ] with the Ark at the front of the column to choose a place for them to stop .
TLB	Numbers	10	34	It was daytime when they left , with the Cloud moving along ahead of them as they began their march .
TLB	Numbers	10	35	As the Ark was carried forward , Moses cried out , “ Arise , O Lord , and scatter your enemies ; let them flee before you. ”

TLB	Numbers	11	11	Moses said to the Lord , “ Why pick on me , to give me the burden of a people like this ?
TLB	Numbers	11	2	They screamed to Moses for help , and when he prayed for them the fire stopped .
TLB	Numbers	11	3	Ever after , the area was known as “ The Place of Burning , ” [ a ] because the fire from the Lord burned among them there . 4-5 Then the Egyptians who had come with them began to long for the good things of Egypt . This added to the discontent of the people of Israel and they wept , “ Oh , for a few bites of meat ! Oh , that we had some of the delicious fish we enjoyed so much in Egypt , and the wonderful cucumbers and melons , leeks , onions , and garlic !
TLB	Numbers	11	6	But now our strength is gone , and day after day we have to face this manna ! ”
TLB	Numbers	11	7	The manna was the size of small seeds , whitish yellow in color .
TLB	Numbers	11	8	The people gathered it from the ground and pounded it into flour , then boiled it , and then made pancakes from it—they tasted like pancakes fried in vegetable oil . [ b ]
TLB	Numbers	11	9	The manna fell with the dew during the night .
TLB	Numbers	11	10	Moses heard all the families standing around their tent doors weeping , and the anger of the Lord grew hot ; Moses too was highly displeased .
TLB	Numbers	11	12	Are they my children ? Am I their father ? Is that why you have given me the job of nursing them along like babies until we get to the land you promised their ancestors ?
TLB	Numbers	11	13	Where am I supposed to get meat for all these people ? For they weep to me saying , ‘ Give us meat ! ’
TLB	Numbers	11	14	I can ’ t carry this nation by myself ! The load is far too heavy !
TLB	Numbers	11	15	If you are going to treat me like this , please kill me right now ; it will be a kindness ! Let me out of this impossible situation ! ”
TLB	Numbers	11	16	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Summon before me seventy of the leaders of Israel ; bring them to the Tabernacle , to stand there with you .
TLB	Numbers	11	17	I will come down and talk with you there , and I will take of the Spirit which is on you and will put it upon them also ; they shall bear the burden of the people along with you , so that you will not have the task alone .
TLB	Numbers	11	18	“ And tell the people to purify themselves , for tomorrow they shall have meat to eat . Tell them , ‘ The Lord has heard your tearful complaints about all you left behind in Egypt , and he is going to give you meat . You shall eat it , 19-20 not for just a day or two , or five or ten or even twenty ! For one whole month you will have meat until you vomit it from your noses ; for you have rejected the Lord who is here among you , and you have wept for Egypt. ’ ”
TLB	Numbers	11	21	But Moses said , “ There are 600,000 men alone besides all the women and children , [ c ] and yet you promise them meat for a whole month !
TLB	Numbers	11	22	If we butcher all our flocks and herds it won ’ t be enough ! We would have to catch every fish in the ocean to fulfill your promise ! ”
TLB	Numbers	11	23	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ When did I become weak ? Now you shall see whether my word comes true or not ! ”
TLB	Numbers	11	24	So Moses left the Tabernacle and reported Jehovah ’ s words to the people ; and he gathered the seventy elders and placed them around the Tabernacle .
TLB	Numbers	11	25	And the Lord came down in the Cloud and talked with Moses , and the Lord took of the Spirit that was upon Moses and put it upon the seventy elders ; and when the Spirit rested upon them , they prophesied for some time .
TLB	Numbers	11	26	But two of the seventy—Eldad and Medad—were still in the camp , and when the Spirit rested upon them , they prophesied there .
TLB	Numbers	11	27	Some young men ran and told Moses what was happening ,
TLB	Numbers	11	28	and Joshua ( the son of Nun ) , one of Moses ’ personally chosen assistants , protested , “ Sir , make them stop ! ”
TLB	Numbers	11	29	But Moses replied , “ Are you jealous for my sake ? I only wish that all of the Lord ’ s people were prophets , and that the Lord would put his Spirit upon them all ! ”
TLB	Numbers	11	30	Then Moses returned to the camp with the elders of Israel .
TLB	Numbers	11	31	The Lord sent a wind that brought quail from the sea and let them fall into the camp and all around it ! As far as one could walk in a day in any direction , there were quail flying three or four feet above the ground . [ d ]
TLB	Numbers	11	32	So the people caught and killed quail all that day and through the night and all the next day too ! The least anyone gathered was
TLB	Numbers	11	100	bushels ! Quail were spread out all around [ e ] the camp .
TLB	Numbers	11	33	But as everyone began eating the meat , the anger of the Lord rose against the people and he killed large numbers of them with a plague .
TLB	Numbers	11	34	So the name of that place was called , “ The Place of the Graves Caused by Lust , ” [ f ] because they buried the people there who had lusted for meat and for Egypt .
TLB	Numbers	11	35	And from that place they journeyed to Hazeroth , where they stayed awhile . Footnotes - Numbers 11:3 The Place of Burning , literally , “ Taberah. ” - Numbers 11:8 vegetable oil , literally , “ olive oil. ” - Numbers 11:21 besides all the women and children , implied . - Numbers 11:31 there were quail flying three or four feet above the ground , or “ The ground was covered with them , three feet thick. ” - Numbers 11:32 quail were spread out all around .

TLB	Numbers	12	12	Don ’ t let her be as one dead , whose body is half rotted away at birth. ”
TLB	Numbers	12	2	and they said , “ Has the Lord spoken only through Moses ? Hasn ’ t he spoken through us , too ? ” But the Lord heard them . 3-4 Immediately he summoned Moses , Aaron , and Miriam to the Tabernacle : “ Come here , you three , ” he commanded . So they stood before the Lord . ( Now Moses was the humblest man on earth . )
TLB	Numbers	12	5	Then the Lord descended in the Cloud and stood at the entrance of the Tabernacle . “ Aaron and Miriam , step forward , ” he commanded ; and they did .
TLB	Numbers	12	6	And the Lord said to them , “ Even with a prophet , I would communicate by visions and dreams ; 7-8 but that is not how I communicate with my servant Moses . He is completely at home in my house ! With him I speak face-to-face ! And he shall see the very form of God ! Why then were you not afraid to criticize him ? ”
TLB	Numbers	12	9	Then the anger of the Lord grew hot against them , and he departed .
TLB	Numbers	12	10	As the Cloud moved from above the Tabernacle , Miriam suddenly became white with leprosy . When Aaron saw what had happened ,
TLB	Numbers	12	11	he cried out to Moses , “ Oh , sir , do not punish us for this sin ; we were fools to do such a thing .
TLB	Numbers	12	13	And Moses cried out to the Lord , “ Heal her , O God , I beg you ! ”
TLB	Numbers	12	14	And the Lord said to Moses , “ If her father had but spit in her face she would be defiled seven days . Let her be banished from the camp for seven days , and after that she can come back again. ”
TLB	Numbers	12	15	So Miriam was excluded from the camp for seven days , and the people waited until she was brought back in before they traveled again .
TLB	Numbers	12	16	Afterwards they left Hazeroth and camped in the wilderness of Paran . Footnotes - Numbers 12:1 Cushite woman , literally , “ because of the Cushite woman he had married. ” Apparently they were referring to his wife Zipporah , the Midianite daughter of Reuel ( Exodus 2:21 ) ; for the land of Midian from which she came was sometimes called Cush . But areas of Ethiopia and Babylon were also known as Cush , so it is possible that the reference is to a second wife of Moses . It is indeterminate from the text whether she was criticized for being a Gentile , or ( if she was a Cushite from Ethiopia ) because of her color . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Numbers	13	13	Jehovah now instructed Moses ,
TLB	Numbers	13	2	“ Send spies into the land of Canaan—the land I am giving to Israel ; send one leader from each tribe. ” 3-15 ( The Israelis were camped in the wilderness of Paran at the time . ) Moses did as the Lord had commanded and sent these twelve tribal leaders : Shammua , son of Zaccur , from the tribe of Reuben ; Shaphat , son of Hori , from the tribe of Simeon ; Caleb , son of Jephunneh , from the tribe of Judah ; Igal , son of Joseph , from the tribe of Issachar ; Hoshea , [ a ] son of Nun , from the half-tribe of Ephraim ; Palti , son of Raphu , from the tribe of Benjamin ; Gaddiel , son of Sodi , from the tribe of Zebulun ; Gaddi , son of Susi , from the tribe of Joseph ( actually , the half-tribe of Manasseh ) ; Ammiel , son of Gemalli , from the tribe of Dan ; Sethur , son of Michael , from the tribe of Asher ; Nahbi , son of Vophsi , from the tribe of Naphtali ; Geuel , son of Machi , from the tribe of Gad .
TLB	Numbers	13	16	. - Numbers 13:16 Moses changed Hoshea ’ s name to Joshua . Hoshea means “ salvation ” ; Joshua means “ Jehovah is salvation. ” Joshua is the same name in Hebrew as the Greek name “ Jesus. ” - Numbers 13:22 Tanis , or “ Zoan , ” also known as “ Avaris , ” was built ca .
TLB	Numbers	13	17	Moses sent them out with these instructions : “ Go northward into the hill country of the Negeb ,
TLB	Numbers	13	18	and see what the land is like ; see also what the people are like who live there , whether they are strong or weak , many or few ;
TLB	Numbers	13	19	and whether the land is fertile or not ; and what cities there are , and whether they are villages or are fortified ;
TLB	Numbers	13	20	whether the land is rich or poor , and whether there are many trees . Don ’ t be afraid , and bring back some samples of the crops you see. ” ( The first of the grapes were being harvested at that time . )
TLB	Numbers	13	21	So they spied out the land all the way from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob near Hamath .
TLB	Numbers	13	22	Going northward , they passed first through the Negeb and arrived at Hebron . There they saw the Ahimanites , Sheshites , and Talmites , all families descended from Anak . ( By the way , Hebron was very ancient , having been founded seven years before Tanis [ c ] in Egypt . )
TLB	Numbers	13	23	Then they came to what is now known as the valley of Eshcol where they cut down a single cluster of grapes so large that it took two of them to carry it on a pole between them ! They also took some samples of the pomegranates and figs .
TLB	Numbers	13	24	The Israelis named the valley “ Eshcol ” at that time ( meaning “ Cluster ” ) because of the cluster of grapes they found !
TLB	Numbers	13	25	After forty days of exploration they returned from their tour .
TLB	Numbers	13	26	They made their report to Moses , Aaron , and all the people of Israel in the wilderness of Paran at Kadesh , and they showed the fruit they had brought with them .
TLB	Numbers	13	27	This was their report : “ We arrived in the land you sent us to see , and it is indeed a magnificent country—a land ‘ flowing with milk and honey. ’ Here is some fruit we have brought as proof .
TLB	Numbers	13	28	But the people living there are powerful , and their cities are fortified and very large ; and what ’ s more , we saw Anakim giants there !
TLB	Numbers	13	29	The Amalekites live in the south , while in the hill country there are the Hittites , Jebusites , and Amorites ; down along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea and in the Jordan River Valley are the Canaanites. ”
TLB	Numbers	13	30	But Caleb reassured the people as they stood before Moses . “ Let us go up at once and possess it , ” he said , “ for we are well able to conquer it ! ”
TLB	Numbers	13	31	“ Not against people as strong as they are ! ” the other spies said . “ They would crush us ! ”
TLB	Numbers	13	32	So the majority report of the spies was negative : “ The land is full of warriors , the people are powerfully built ,
TLB	Numbers	13	33	and we saw some of the Anakim there , descendants of the ancient race of giants . We felt like grasshoppers before them , they were so tall ! ” Footnotes - Numbers 13:3 Hoshea , or “ Joshua. ” See v.

TLB	Numbers	14	14	They have told this to the inhabitants of this land , who are well aware that you are with Israel and that you talk with her face-to-face . They see the pillar of cloud and fire standing above us , and they know that you lead and protect us day and night .
TLB	Numbers	14	2	Their voices rose in a great chorus of complaint against Moses and Aaron . “ We wish we had died in Egypt , ” they wailed , “ or even here in the wilderness ,
TLB	Numbers	14	3	rather than be taken into this country ahead of us . Jehovah will kill us there , and our wives and little ones will become slaves . Let ’ s get out of here and return to Egypt ! ”
TLB	Numbers	14	4	The idea swept the camp . “ Let ’ s elect a leader to take us back to Egypt ! ” they shouted .
TLB	Numbers	14	5	Then Moses and Aaron fell face downward on the ground before the people of Israel .
TLB	Numbers	14	6	Two of the spies , Joshua ( the son of Nun ) , and Caleb ( the son of Jephunneh ) , ripped their clothing
TLB	Numbers	14	7	and said to all the people , “ It is a wonderful country ahead ,
TLB	Numbers	14	8	and the Lord loves us . He will bring us safely into the land and give it to us . It is very fertile , a land ‘ flowing with milk and honey ’ !
TLB	Numbers	14	9	Oh , do not rebel against the Lord , and do not fear the people of the land . For they are but bread for us to eat ! The Lord is with us and he has removed his protection from them ! Don ’ t be afraid of them ! ” 10-11 But the only response of the people was to talk of stoning them . Then the glory of the Lord appeared , and the Lord said to Moses , “ How long will these people despise me ? Will they never believe me , even after all the miracles I have done among them ?
TLB	Numbers	14	12	I will disinherit them and destroy them with a plague , and I will make you into a nation far greater and mightier than they are ! ”
TLB	Numbers	14	13	“ But what will the Egyptians think when they hear about it ? ” Moses pleaded with the Lord . “ They know full well the power you displayed in rescuing your people .
TLB	Numbers	14	15	Now if you kill all your people , the nations that have heard your fame will say ,
TLB	Numbers	14	16	‘ The Lord had to kill them because he wasn ’ t able to take care of them in the wilderness . He wasn ’ t strong enough to bring them into the land he swore he would give them. ’ 17-18 “ Oh , please , show the great power of your patience [ a ] by forgiving our sins and showing us your steadfast love . Forgive us , even though you have said that you don ’ t let sin go unpunished , and that you punish the father ’ s fault in the children to the third and fourth generation .
TLB	Numbers	14	19	Oh , I plead with you , pardon the sins of this people because of your magnificent , steadfast love , just as you have forgiven them all the time from when we left Egypt until now. ” 20-21 Then the Lord said , “ All right , I will pardon them as you have requested . But I vow by my own name that just as it is true that all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord ,
TLB	Numbers	14	22	so it is true that not one of the men who has seen my glory and the miracles I did both in Egypt and in the wilderness—and ten times refused to trust me and obey me—
TLB	Numbers	14	23	shall even see the land I promised to this people ’ s ancestors .
TLB	Numbers	14	24	But my servant Caleb is a different kind of man—he has obeyed me fully . I will bring him into the land he entered as a spy , and his descendants shall have their full share in it .
TLB	Numbers	14	25	But now , since the people of Israel are so afraid of the Amalekites and the Canaanites living in the valleys , tomorrow you must turn back into the wilderness in the direction of the Red Sea. ” 26-27 Then the Lord said to Moses and to Aaron , “ How long will this wicked nation complain about me ? For I have heard all that they have been saying .
TLB	Numbers	14	28	Tell them , ‘ The Lord vows to do to you what you feared :
TLB	Numbers	14	29	You will all die here in this wilderness ! Not a single one of you twenty years old and older , who has complained against me ,
TLB	Numbers	14	30	shall enter the Promised Land . Only Caleb ( son of Jephunneh ) and Joshua ( son of Nun ) are permitted to enter it .
TLB	Numbers	14	31	“ ‘ You said your children would become slaves of the people of the land . Well , instead I will bring them safely into the land and they shall inherit what you have despised .
TLB	Numbers	14	32	But as for you , your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness .
TLB	Numbers	14	33	You must wander in the desert like nomads for forty years . In this way you will pay for your faithlessness , until the last of you lies dead in the desert . 34-35 “ ‘ Since the spies were in the land for forty days , you must wander in the wilderness for forty years—a year for each day , bearing the burden of your sins . I will teach you what it means to reject me . I , Jehovah , have spoken . Every one of you who has conspired against me shall die here in this wilderness. ’ ” 36-38 Then the ten spies who had incited the rebellion against Jehovah by striking fear into the hearts of the people were struck dead before the Lord . Of all the spies , only Joshua and Caleb remained alive .
TLB	Numbers	14	39	What sorrow there was throughout the camp when Moses reported God ’ s words to the people !
TLB	Numbers	14	40	They were up early the next morning and started toward the Promised Land . “ Here we are ! ” they said . “ We realize that we have sinned , but now we are ready to go on into the land the Lord has promised us. ”
TLB	Numbers	14	41	But Moses said , “ It ’ s too late . Now you are disobeying the Lord ’ s orders to return to the wilderness .
TLB	Numbers	14	42	Don ’ t go ahead with your plan or you will be crushed by your enemies , for the Lord is not with you .
TLB	Numbers	14	43	Don ’ t you remember ? The Amalekites and the Canaanites are there ! You have deserted the Lord , and now he will desert you. ”
TLB	Numbers	14	44	But they went ahead into the hill country , despite the fact that neither the Ark nor Moses left the camp .
TLB	Numbers	14	45	Then the Amalekites and the Canaanites who lived in the hills came down and attacked them and chased them to Hormah . Footnotes - Numbers 14:17 of your patience , implied . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Numbers	15	15	1-2 The Lord told Moses to give these instructions to the people of Israel : “ When your children finally live in the land I am going to give them , 3-4 and they want to please the Lord with a burnt offering or any other offering by fire , their sacrifice must be an animal from their flocks of sheep and goats , or from their herds of cattle . Each sacrifice—whether an ordinary one , or a sacrifice to fulfill a vow , or a freewill offering , or a special sacrifice at any of the annual festivals—must be accompanied by a grain offering . If a lamb is being sacrificed , use three quarts of fine flour mixed with three pints of oil ,
TLB	Numbers	15	5	accompanied by three pints of wine for a drink offering .
TLB	Numbers	15	6	“ If the sacrifice is a ram , use six quarts of fine flour mixed with four pints of oil ,
TLB	Numbers	15	7	and four pints of wine for a drink offering . This will be a sacrifice that is a pleasing fragrance to the Lord . 8-9 “ If the sacrifice is a young bull , then the grain offering accompanying it must consist of nine quarts of fine flour mixed with three quarts of oil ,
TLB	Numbers	15	10	plus three quarts of wine for the drink offering . This shall be offered by fire as a pleasing fragrance to the Lord . 11-12 “ These are the instructions for what is to accompany each sacrificial bull , ram , lamb , or young goat . 13-14 These instructions apply both to native-born Israelis and to foreigners living among you who want to please the Lord with sacrifices offered by fire ; 15-16 for there is the same law for all , native-born or foreigner , and this shall be true forever from generation to generation ; all are the same before the Lord . [ a ] Yes , one law for all ! ” 17-18 The Lord also said to Moses at this time , “ Instruct the people of Israel that when they arrive in the land that I am going to give them , 19-21 they must present to the Lord a sample of each year ’ s new crops by making a loaf , using coarse flour from the first grain that is cut each year . This loaf must be waved back and forth before the altar in a gesture of offering to the Lord . It is an annual offering from your threshing floor and must be observed from generation to generation .
TLB	Numbers	15	22	“ If by mistake you or future generations fail to carry out all of these regulations that the Lord has given you over the years through Moses , 23-24 then when the people realize their error , they must offer one young bull for a burnt offering . It will be a pleasant odor before the Lord , and must be offered along with the usual grain offering and drink offering , and one male goat for a sin offering .
TLB	Numbers	15	25	And the priest shall make atonement for all of the people of Israel and they shall be forgiven ; for it was an error , and they have corrected it with their sacrifice made by fire before the Lord , and by their sin offering .
TLB	Numbers	15	26	All the people shall be forgiven , including the foreigners living among them , for the entire population is involved in such error and forgiveness .
TLB	Numbers	15	27	“ If the error is made by a single individual , then he shall sacrifice a one-year-old female goat for a sin offering ,
TLB	Numbers	15	28	and the priest shall make atonement for him before the Lord , and he shall be forgiven .
TLB	Numbers	15	29	This same law applies to individual foreigners who are living among you .
TLB	Numbers	15	30	“ But anyone who deliberately makes the ‘ mistake , ’ whether he is a native Israeli or a foreigner , is blaspheming Jehovah , and shall be cut off from among his people .
TLB	Numbers	15	31	For he has despised the commandment of the Lord and deliberately failed to obey his law ; he must be executed [ b ] and die in his sin. ”
TLB	Numbers	15	32	One day while the people of Israel were in the wilderness , one of them was caught gathering wood on the Sabbath day .
TLB	Numbers	15	33	He was arrested and taken before Moses and Aaron and the other judges . [ c ]
TLB	Numbers	15	34	They jailed him until they could find out the Lord ’ s mind concerning him .
TLB	Numbers	15	35	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ The man must die—all the people shall stone him to death outside the camp. ”
TLB	Numbers	15	36	So they took him outside the camp and killed him as the Lord had commanded . 37-38 The Lord said to Moses , “ Tell the people of Israel to make tassels for the hems of their clothes ( this is a permanent regulation from generation to generation ) and to attach the tassels to their clothes with a blue cord .
TLB	Numbers	15	39	The purpose of this regulation is to remind you , whenever you notice the tassels , of the commandments of the Lord , and that you are to obey his laws instead of following your own desires and going your own ways , as you used to do in serving other gods .
TLB	Numbers	15	40	It will remind you to be holy to your God .
TLB	Numbers	15	41	For I am Jehovah your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt ; yes , I am the Lord , your God. ” Footnotes - Numbers 15:15 all are the same before the Lord , literally , “ as you are , so shall the foreigner be before Jehovah. ” - Numbers 15:31 he must be executed , literally , “ that soul shall be utterly cut off ; his iniquity shall be upon him. ” - Numbers 15:33 before Moses and Aaron and the other judges , literally , “ to all the congregation. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Numbers	16	16	And Moses said to Korah , “ Come here tomorrow before the Lord with all your friends ; Aaron will be here too .
TLB	Numbers	16	2	to incite a rebellion against Moses . Two hundred and fifty popular leaders , all members of the Assembly , were involved .
TLB	Numbers	16	3	They went to Moses and Aaron and said , “ We have had enough of your presumption ; you are no better than anyone else ; everyone in Israel has been chosen of the Lord , and he is with all of us . What right do you have to put yourselves forward , claiming that we must obey you , and acting as though you were greater than anyone else among all these people of the Lord ? ”
TLB	Numbers	16	4	When Moses heard what they were saying he fell face downward to the ground .
TLB	Numbers	16	5	Then he said to Korah and to those who were with him , “ In the morning the Lord will show you who are his , and who is holy , and whom he has chosen as his priest . 6-7 Do this : You , Korah , and all those with you , take censers tomorrow and light them , and put incense upon them before the Lord , and we will find out whom the Lord has chosen . [ a ] You are the presumptuous ones , you sons of Levi. ” 8-9 Then Moses spoke again to Korah : “ Does it seem a small thing to you that the God of Israel has chosen you from among all the people of Israel to be near to himself as you work in the Tabernacle of Jehovah , and to stand before the people to minister to them ?
TLB	Numbers	16	10	Is it nothing to you that he has given this task to only you Levites ? And now are you demanding the priesthood also ? 11-12 That is what you are really after ! That is why you are revolting against Jehovah . And what has Aaron done , that you are dissatisfied with him ? ” Then Moses summoned Dathan and Abiram ( the sons of Eliab ) , but they refused to come .
TLB	Numbers	16	13	“ Is it a small thing , ” they mimicked , [ b ] “ that you brought us out of lovely Egypt to kill us here in this terrible wilderness , and that now you want to make yourself our king ?
TLB	Numbers	16	14	What ’ s more , you haven ’ t brought us into the wonderful country you promised , nor given us fields and vineyards . Whom are you trying to fool ? We refuse to come. ”
TLB	Numbers	16	15	Then Moses was very angry and said to the Lord , “ Do not accept their sacrifices ! I have never stolen so much as a donkey from them and have not hurt one of them. ”
TLB	Numbers	16	17	Be sure to bring your censers with incense on them ; a censer for each man ,
TLB	Numbers	16	250	bronze censers and beat them out into a sheet of metal to cover the altar ,
TLB	Numbers	16	18	So they did . They came with their censers and lit them and placed the incense on them , and stood at the entrance of the Tabernacle with Moses and Aaron .
TLB	Numbers	16	19	Meanwhile , Korah had stirred up the entire nation against Moses and Aaron , and they all assembled to watch . Then the glory of Jehovah appeared to all the people ,
TLB	Numbers	16	20	and Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron ,
TLB	Numbers	16	21	“ Get away from these people so that I may instantly destroy them. ”
TLB	Numbers	16	22	But Moses and Aaron fell face downward to the ground before the Lord . “ O God , the God of all mankind , ” they pleaded , “ must you be angry with all the people when one man sins ? ” 23-24 And the Lord said to Moses , “ Then tell the people to get away from the tents of Korah , Dathan , and Abiram. ”
TLB	Numbers	16	25	So Moses rushed over to the tents of Dathan and Abiram , followed closely by the
TLB	Numbers	16	26	“ Quick ! ” he told the people , “ get away from the tents of these wicked men , and don ’ t touch anything that belongs to them , lest you be included in their sins and be destroyed with them . [ c ] ”
TLB	Numbers	16	27	So all the people stood back from the tents of Korah , Dathan , and Abiram . And Dathan and Abiram came out and stood at the entrances of their tents with their wives and sons and little ones .
TLB	Numbers	16	28	And Moses said , “ By this you shall know that Jehovah has sent me to do all these things that I have done—for I have not done them on my own .
TLB	Numbers	16	29	If these men die a natural death or from some ordinary accident or disease , then Jehovah has not sent me .
TLB	Numbers	16	30	But if the Lord does a miracle and the ground opens up and swallows them and everything that belongs to them , and they go down alive into Sheol , then you will know that these men have despised the Lord. ”
TLB	Numbers	16	31	He had hardly finished speaking the words when the ground suddenly split open beneath them ,
TLB	Numbers	16	32	and a great fissure swallowed them up , along with their tents and families and the friends who were standing with them , and everything they owned .
TLB	Numbers	16	33	So they went down alive into Sheol and the earth closed upon them , and they perished .
TLB	Numbers	16	34	All of the people of Israel fled at their screams , fearing that the earth would swallow them too .
TLB	Numbers	16	35	Then fire came from Jehovah and burned up the
TLB	Numbers	16	38	from the censers of these men who have sinned at the cost of their lives . He shall then beat the metal into a sheet as a covering for the altar , for these censers are holy because they were used before the Lord ; and the altar sheet shall be a reminder to the people of Israel. ”
TLB	Numbers	16	39	So Eleazar the priest took the
TLB	Numbers	16	40	to be a reminder to the people of Israel that no unauthorized person—no one who is not a descendant of Aaron—may come before the Lord to burn incense , lest the same thing happen to him as happened to Korah and his associates . Thus the Lord ’ s directions to Moses were carried out .
TLB	Numbers	16	41	But the very next morning all the people began muttering again against Moses and Aaron , saying , “ You have killed the Lord ’ s people. ”
TLB	Numbers	16	42	Soon a great , sullen mob formed ; suddenly , as they looked toward the Tabernacle , the Cloud appeared and the awesome glory of the Lord was seen . 43-44 Moses and Aaron came and stood at the entrance of the Tabernacle , and the Lord said to Moses ,
TLB	Numbers	16	45	“ Get away from these people so that I can instantly destroy them. ” But Moses and Aaron fell face downward to the earth before the Lord .
TLB	Numbers	16	46	And Moses said to Aaron , “ Quick , take a censer and place fire in it from the altar ; lay incense on it , and carry it quickly among the people and make atonement for them ; for God ’ s anger has gone out among them—the plague has already begun. ”
TLB	Numbers	16	47	Aaron did as Moses had told him to , and ran among the people , for the plague had indeed already begun ; and he put on the incense and made atonement for them .
TLB	Numbers	16	48	And he stood between the living and the dead , and the plague was stopped ,
TLB	Numbers	16	49	but not before 14,700 people had died ( in addition to those who had died the previous day with Korah ) .
TLB	Numbers	16	50	Then Aaron returned to Moses at the entrance of the Tabernacle ; and so the plague was stopped .

TLB	Numbers	17	17	1-3 Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Tell the people of Israel that each of their tribal chiefs is to bring you a wooden rod with his name inscribed upon it . Aaron ’ s name is to be on the rod of the tribe of Levi .
TLB	Numbers	17	4	Put these rods in the inner room of the Tabernacle where I meet with you , in front of the Ark .
TLB	Numbers	17	5	I will use these rods to identify the man I have chosen : for buds will grow on his rod ! Then at last this murmuring and complaining against you will stop ! ”
TLB	Numbers	17	6	So Moses gave the instructions to the people , and each of the twelve chiefs ( including Aaron ) brought him a rod .
TLB	Numbers	17	7	He put them before the Lord in the inner room of the Tabernacle ,
TLB	Numbers	17	8	and when he went in the next day , he found that Aaron ’ s rod , representing the tribe of Levi , had budded and was blossoming , and had ripe almonds hanging from it !
TLB	Numbers	17	9	When Moses brought them out to show the others , they stared in disbelief ! Then each man except Aaron claimed his rod .
TLB	Numbers	17	10	The Lord told Moses to place Aaron ’ s rod permanently beside the Ark as a reminder of this rebellion . He was to bring it out and show it to the people again [ a ] if there were any further complaints about Aaron ’ s authority ; this would ward off further catastrophe to the people .
TLB	Numbers	17	11	So Moses did as the Lord commanded him . 12-13 But the people of Israel only grumbled the more . “ We are as good as dead , ” they whined . “ Everyone who even comes close to the Tabernacle dies . Must we all perish ? ” Footnotes - Numbers 17:10 bring it out and show it to the people again , implied . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Numbers	18	18	The meat of these animals shall be yours , including the breast and right thigh that are presented to the Lord by the gesture of waving before the altar .
TLB	Numbers	18	4	No one who is not a member of the tribe of Levi shall assist you in any way .
TLB	Numbers	18	5	Remember , only the priests are to perform the sacred duties within the sanctuary and at the altar . If you follow these instructions , the wrath of God will never again fall upon any of the people of Israel for violating this law .
TLB	Numbers	18	6	I say it again—your kinsmen the Levites are your assistants for the work of the Tabernacle . They are a gift to you from the Lord .
TLB	Numbers	18	7	But you and your sons , the priests , shall personally handle all the sacred service , including the altar and all that is within the veil , for the priesthood is your special gift of service . Anyone else who attempts to perform these duties shall die. ”
TLB	Numbers	18	8	The Lord gave these further instructions to Aaron : “ I have given the priests all the gifts which are brought to the Lord by the people ; all these offerings presented to the Lord by the gesture of waving them before the altar belong to you and your sons , by permanent law .
TLB	Numbers	18	9	The grain offerings , the sin offerings , and the guilt offerings are yours , except for the sample presented to the Lord by burning upon the altar . All these are most holy offerings .
TLB	Numbers	18	10	They are to be eaten only in a most holy place , and only by males .
TLB	Numbers	18	11	All other gifts presented to me by the gesture of waving them before the altar are for you and your families , sons and daughters alike . For all the members of your families may eat these unless anyone is ceremonially impure at the time .
TLB	Numbers	18	12	“ Yours also are the first-of-the-harvest gifts the people bring as offerings to the Lord—the best of the olive oil , wine , grain ,
TLB	Numbers	18	13	and every other crop . Your families may eat these unless they are ceremonially defiled at the time . 14-15 So everything that is dedicated to the Lord shall be yours , including the firstborn sons of the people of Israel , and the firstborn of their animals .
TLB	Numbers	18	16	However , you may never accept the firstborn sons , nor the firstborn of any animals that I do not permit for food . Instead , there must be a payment of two and a half dollars made for each firstborn child . It is to be brought when he is one month old .
TLB	Numbers	18	17	“ However , the firstborn of cows , sheep , or goats may not be bought back ; they must be sacrificed to the Lord . [ a ] Their blood is to be sprinkled upon the altar , and their fat shall be burned as a fire offering ; it is very pleasant to the Lord .
TLB	Numbers	18	19	Yes , I have given to you all of these ‘ wave offerings ’ brought by the people of Israel to the Lord ; they are for you and your families as food ; this is a permanent contract [ b ] between the Lord and you and your descendants .
TLB	Numbers	18	20	“ You priests may own no property nor have any other income , for I am all that you need .
TLB	Numbers	18	21	“ As for the tribe of Levi , your relatives , they shall be paid for their service with the tithes from the entire land of Israel .
TLB	Numbers	18	22	“ From now on , Israelites other than the priests and Levites shall not enter the sanctuary lest they be judged guilty and die .
TLB	Numbers	18	23	Only the Levites shall do the work there , and they shall be guilty if they fail . This is a permanent law among you , that the Levites shall own no property in Israel ,
TLB	Numbers	18	24	for the people ’ s tithes , offered to the Lord by the gesture of waving before the altar , shall belong to the Levites ; these are their inheritance , and so they have no need for property. ” 25-26 The Lord also said to Moses , “ Tell the Levites to give to the Lord a tenth of the tithes they receive—a tithe of the tithe , to be presented to the Lord by the gesture of waving before the altar .
TLB	Numbers	18	27	The Lord will consider this as your first-of-the-harvest offering to him of grain and wine , as though it were from your own property . 28-29 This tithe of the tithe shall be selected from the choicest part of the tithes you receive as the Lord ’ s portion , and shall be given to Aaron the priest .
TLB	Numbers	18	30	It shall be credited to you just as though it were from your own threshing floor and winepress .
TLB	Numbers	18	31	Aaron and his sons and their families may eat it in their homes or anywhere they wish , for it is their compensation for their service in the Tabernacle .
TLB	Numbers	18	32	You Levites will not be held guilty for accepting the Lord ’ s tithes if you then give the best tenth to the priests . But beware that you do not treat the holy gifts of the people of Israel as though they were common , lest you die. ” Footnotes - Numbers 18:17 they must be sacrificed to the Lord , literally , “ they are holy. ” - Numbers 18:19 a permanent contract , literally , “ a covenant of salt. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Numbers	19	13	Anyone who touches a dead person and does not purify himself in the manner specified has defiled the Tabernacle of the Lord , and shall be excommunicated from Israel . The cleansing water was not sprinkled upon him , so the defilement continues .

TLB	Numbers	20	20	But the king of Edom was adamant . “ Stay out ! ” he warned , and , mobilizing his army , he marched to the frontier with a great force . 21-22 Because Edom refused to allow Israel to pass through their country , Israel turned back and journeyed from Kadesh to Mount Hor .
TLB	Numbers	20	2	There was not enough water to drink at that place , so the people again rebelled against Moses and Aaron . A great mob formed ,
TLB	Numbers	20	3	and they held a protest meeting . “ Would that we too had died with our dear brothers the Lord killed ! ” they shouted at Moses .
TLB	Numbers	20	4	“ You have deliberately brought us into this wilderness to get rid of us , along with our flocks and herds .
TLB	Numbers	20	5	Why did you ever make us leave Egypt and bring us here to this evil place ? Where is the fertile land of wonderful crops—the figs , vines , and pomegranates you told us about ? Why , there isn ’ t even water enough to drink ! ”
TLB	Numbers	20	6	Moses and Aaron turned away and went to the entrance of the Tabernacle , where they fell face downward before the Lord ; and the glory of Jehovah appeared to them .
TLB	Numbers	20	7	And he said to Moses ,
TLB	Numbers	20	8	“ Get Aaron ’ s rod ; [ b ] then you and Aaron must summon the people . As they watch , speak to that rock over there and tell it to pour out its water ! You will give them water from a rock , enough for all the people and all their cattle ! ”
TLB	Numbers	20	9	So Moses did as instructed . He took the rod from the place where it was kept before the Lord ;
TLB	Numbers	20	10	then Moses and Aaron summoned the people to come and gather at the rock ; and he said to them , “ Listen , you rebels ! Must we bring you water from this rock ? ”
TLB	Numbers	20	11	Then Moses lifted the rod and struck the rock twice , and water gushed out ; and the people and their cattle drank .
TLB	Numbers	20	12	But the Lord said to Moses and Aaron , “ Because you did not believe me [ c ] and did not sanctify me in the eyes of the people of Israel , you shall not bring them into the land I have promised them ! ”
TLB	Numbers	20	13	This place was named Meribah ( meaning “ Rebel Waters ” ) , because it was where the people of Israel fought against Jehovah , and where he showed himself to be holy before them .
TLB	Numbers	20	14	While Moses was at Kadesh he sent messengers to the king of Edom : “ We are the descendants of your brother , Israel , ” [ d ] he declared . “ You know our sad history ,
TLB	Numbers	20	15	how our ancestors went down to visit Egypt and stayed there so long , and became slaves of the Egyptians .
TLB	Numbers	20	16	But when we cried to the Lord he heard us and sent an Angel who brought us out of Egypt , and now we are here at Kadesh , encamped on the borders of your land .
TLB	Numbers	20	17	Please let us pass through your country . We will be careful not to go through your planted fields , nor through your vineyards ; we won ’ t even drink water from your wells , but will stay on the main road and not leave it until we have crossed your border on the other side. ”
TLB	Numbers	20	18	But the king of Edom said , “ Stay out ! If you attempt to enter my land , I will meet you with an army ! ”
TLB	Numbers	20	19	“ But , sir , ” protested the Israeli ambassadors , “ we will stay on the main road and will not even drink your water unless we pay whatever you demand for it . We only want to pass through and nothing else. ”
TLB	Numbers	20	23	Then the Lord said to Moses and Aaron at the border of the land of Edom ,
TLB	Numbers	20	24	“ The time has come for Aaron to die—for he shall not enter the land I have given the people of Israel , for the two of you rebelled against my instructions concerning the water at Meribah .
TLB	Numbers	20	25	Now take Aaron and his son Eleazar and lead them up onto Mount Hor .
TLB	Numbers	20	26	There you shall remove Aaron ’ s priestly garments from him and put them on Eleazar his son ; and Aaron shall die there. ”
TLB	Numbers	20	27	So Moses did as the Lord commanded him . The three [ e ] of them went up together into Mount Hor as all the people watched .
TLB	Numbers	20	28	When they reached the summit , Moses removed the priestly garments from Aaron and put them on his son Eleazar ; and Aaron died on the top of the mountain . Moses and Eleazar returned ,
TLB	Numbers	20	29	and when the people were informed of Aaron ’ s death , they mourned for him for thirty days .

TLB	Numbers	21	21	Israel now sent ambassadors to King Sihon of the Amorites .
TLB	Numbers	21	2	Then the people of Israel vowed to the Lord that if he would help them conquer the king of Arad and his people , they would completely annihilate all the cities of that area .
TLB	Numbers	21	3	The Lord heeded their request and defeated the Canaanites ; and the Israelis completely destroyed them and their cities . The name of the region was thereafter called Hormah ( meaning “ Utterly Destroyed ” ) .
TLB	Numbers	21	4	Then the people of Israel returned to Mount Hor , and from there continued southward along the road to the Red Sea in order to go around the land of Edom . The people were very discouraged ;
TLB	Numbers	21	5	they began to murmur against God and to complain against Moses . “ Why have you brought us out of Egypt to die here in the wilderness ? ” they whined . “ There is nothing to eat here , and nothing to drink , and we hate this insipid manna. ”
TLB	Numbers	21	6	So the Lord sent poisonous snakes among them to punish them , and many of them were bitten and died .
TLB	Numbers	21	7	Then the people came to Moses and cried out , “ We have sinned , for we have spoken against Jehovah and against you . Pray to him to take away the snakes. ” So Moses prayed for the people .
TLB	Numbers	21	8	Then the Lord told him , “ Make a bronze replica [ a ] of one of these snakes and attach it to the top of a pole ; anyone who is bitten shall live if he simply looks at it ! ”
TLB	Numbers	21	9	So Moses made the replica , and whenever anyone who had been bitten looked at the bronze snake , he recovered !
TLB	Numbers	21	10	Israel journeyed next to Oboth and camped there .
TLB	Numbers	21	11	Then they went on to Iyeabarim , in the wilderness , a short distance east of Moab ,
TLB	Numbers	21	12	and from there they traveled to the valley of the brook Zared and set up camp .
TLB	Numbers	21	13	Then they moved to the far side of the Arnon River , near the borders of the Amorites . ( The Arnon River is the boundary line between the Moabites and the Amorites .
TLB	Numbers	21	14	This fact is mentioned in The Book of the Wars of Jehovah , where it is stated that the valley of the Arnon River and the city of Waheb
TLB	Numbers	21	15	lie between the Amorites and the people of Moab . )
TLB	Numbers	21	16	Then Israel traveled to Beer ( meaning “ A Well ” ) . This is the place where the Lord told Moses , “ Summon the people , and I will give them water. ” 17-18 What happened is described in this song the people sang : Spring up , O well ! Sing of the water ! This is a well The leaders dug . It was hollowed With their staves And shovels . Then they left the desert and proceeded on through Mattanah ,
TLB	Numbers	21	19	Nahaliel , and Bamoth ;
TLB	Numbers	21	20	then to the valley in the plateau of Moab , which overlooks the desert with Mount Pisgah in the distance .
TLB	Numbers	21	22	“ Let us travel through your land , ” they requested . “ We will not leave the road until we have passed beyond your borders . We won ’ t trample your fields or touch your vineyards or drink your water. ”
TLB	Numbers	21	23	But King Sihon refused . Instead he mobilized his army and attacked Israel in the wilderness , battling them at Jahaz .
TLB	Numbers	21	24	But Israel slaughtered them and occupied their land from the Arnon River to the Jabbok River , as far as the borders of the Ammonites ; but they were stopped there by the rugged terrain . [ b ] 25-26 So Israel captured all the cities of the Amorites and lived in them , including the city of Heshbon , which had been King Sihon ’ s capital . 27-30 The ancient poets had referred to King Sihon in this poem : Come to Heshbon , King Sihon ’ s capital , For a fire has flamed forth And devoured The city of Ar in Moab , On the heights of the Arnon River . Woe to Moab ! You are finished , O people of Chemosh ; Your sons have fled , And your daughters are captured By King Sihon of the Amorites . He has destroyed The little children And the men and women As far as Dibon , Nophah , and Medeba . 31-32 While Israel was there in the Amorite country , Moses sent spies to look over the Jazer area ; he followed up with an armed attack , capturing all of the towns and driving out the Amorites .
TLB	Numbers	21	33	They next turned their attention to the city of Bashan , but King Og of Bashan met them with his army at Edrei .
TLB	Numbers	21	34	The Lord told Moses not to fear—that the enemy was already conquered ! “ The same thing will happen to King Og as happened to King Sihon at Heshbon , ” the Lord assured him .
TLB	Numbers	21	35	And sure enough , Israel was victorious and killed King Og , his sons , and his subjects , so that not a single survivor remained ; and Israel occupied the land . Footnotes - Numbers 21:8 Make a bronze replica , literally , “ Make a fiery serpent. ” - Numbers 21:24 but they were stopped there by the rugged terrain , literally , “ for the border of the children of Ammon was strong. ” Deuteronomy 2:19 indicates that God had promised the land of the Ammonites to the descendants of Lot .

TLB	Numbers	22	22	The people of Israel now traveled to the plains of Moab and camped east of the Jordan River opposite Jericho . 2-3 When King Balak of Moab ( the son of Zippor ) realized how many of them there were , and when he learned what they had done to the Amorites , he and his people were terrified .
TLB	Numbers	22	4	They quickly consulted with the leaders of Midian . “ This mob will eat us like an ox eats grass , ” they exclaimed . So King Balak 5-6 sent messengers to Balaam ( son of Beor ) who was living in his native land of Pethor , near the Euphrates River . He begged Balaam to come and help him . “ A vast horde of people has arrived from Egypt , and they cover the face of the earth and are headed toward me , ” he frantically explained . “ Please come and curse them for me , so that I can drive them out of my land ; for I know what fantastic blessings fall on those whom you bless , and I also know that those whom you curse are doomed. ”
TLB	Numbers	22	7	The messengers he sent were some of the top leaders of Moab and Midian . They went to Balaam with money in hand and urgently explained to him what Balak wanted .
TLB	Numbers	22	8	“ Stay here overnight , ” Balaam said , “ and I ’ ll tell you in the morning whatever the Lord directs me to say. ” So they did .
TLB	Numbers	22	9	That night God came to Balaam and asked him , “ Who are these men ? ”
TLB	Numbers	22	10	“ They have come from King Balak of Moab , ” he replied .
TLB	Numbers	22	11	“ The king says that a vast horde of people from Egypt has arrived at his border , and he wants me to go at once and curse them , in the hope that he can battle them successfully. ”
TLB	Numbers	22	12	“ Don ’ t do it ! ” God told him . “ You are not to curse them , for I have blessed them ! ”
TLB	Numbers	22	13	The next morning Balaam told the men , “ Go on home ! The Lord won ’ t let me do it. ”
TLB	Numbers	22	14	So King Balak ’ s ambassadors returned without him and reported his refusal .
TLB	Numbers	22	15	Balak tried again . This time he sent a larger number of even more distinguished ambassadors than the former group . 16-17 They came to Balaam with this message : “ King Balak pleads with you to come . He promises you great honors plus any payment you ask . Name your own figure ! Only come and curse these people for us. ”
TLB	Numbers	22	18	But Balaam replied , “ If he were to give me a palace filled with silver and gold , I could do nothing contrary to the command of the Lord my God .
TLB	Numbers	22	19	However , stay here tonight so that I can find out whether the Lord will add anything to what he said before. ”
TLB	Numbers	22	20	That night God told Balaam , “ You may get up and go with these men , but be sure to say only what I tell you to. ”
TLB	Numbers	22	21	So the next morning he saddled his donkey and started off with them . 22-23 But God was angry about Balaam ’ s eager attitude , [ a ] so he sent an Angel to stand in the road to kill him . As Balaam and two servants were riding along , Balaam ’ s donkey suddenly saw the Angel of the Lord standing in the road with a drawn sword . She bolted off the road into a field , but Balaam beat her back onto the road .
TLB	Numbers	22	24	Now the Angel of the Lord stood at a place where the road went between two vineyard walls .
TLB	Numbers	22	25	When the donkey saw him standing there , she squirmed past by pressing against the wall , crushing Balaam ’ s foot in the process . So he beat her again .
TLB	Numbers	22	26	Then the Angel of the Lord moved farther down the road and stood in a place so narrow that the donkey couldn ’ t get by at all .
TLB	Numbers	22	27	So she lay down in the road ! In a great fit of temper Balaam beat her again with his staff .
TLB	Numbers	22	28	Then the Lord caused the donkey to speak ! “ What have I done that deserves your beating me these three times ? ” she asked .
TLB	Numbers	22	29	“ Because you have made me look like a fool ! ” Balaam shouted . “ I wish I had a sword with me , for I would kill you. ”
TLB	Numbers	22	30	“ Have I ever done anything like this before in my entire life ? ” the donkey asked . “ No , ” he admitted .
TLB	Numbers	22	31	Then the Lord opened Balaam ’ s eyes and he saw the Angel standing in the roadway with drawn sword , and he fell flat on the ground before him .
TLB	Numbers	22	32	“ Why did you beat your donkey those three times ? ” the Angel demanded . “ I have come to stop you because you are headed for destruction .
TLB	Numbers	22	33	Three times the donkey saw me and shied away from me ; otherwise I would certainly have killed you by now and spared her. ”
TLB	Numbers	22	34	Then Balaam confessed , “ I have sinned . I didn ’ t realize you were there . I will go back home if you don ’ t want me to go on. ”
TLB	Numbers	22	35	But the Angel told him , “ Go with the men , but say only what I tell you to say. ” So Balaam went on with them .
TLB	Numbers	22	36	When King Balak heard that Balaam was on the way , he left the capital and went out to meet him at the Arnon River , at the border of his land .
TLB	Numbers	22	37	“ Why did you delay so long ? ” he asked Balaam . “ Didn ’ t you believe me when I said I would give you great honors ? ”
TLB	Numbers	22	38	Balaam replied , “ I have come , but I have no power to say anything except what God tells me to say ; and that is what I shall speak. ”
TLB	Numbers	22	39	Balaam accompanied the king to Kiriathhuzoth ,
TLB	Numbers	22	40	where King Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep , and gave animals to Balaam and the ambassadors for their sacrifices .
TLB	Numbers	22	41	The next morning Balak took Balaam to the top of Mount Bamoth-baal , from which he could see the people of Israel spread out before him . Footnotes - Numbers 22:22 God was angry about Balaam ’ s eager attitude , literally , “ God was angry because he went. ” He said much more than God had told him to . See 25:1-3 ; 31:16 .

TLB	Numbers	23	23	Balaam said to the king , “ Build seven altars here , and prepare seven young bulls and seven rams for sacrifice. ”
TLB	Numbers	23	2	Balak followed his instructions , and a young bull and a ram were sacrificed on each altar . 3-4 Then Balaam said to the king , “ Stand here by your burnt offerings and I will see if the Lord will meet me ; and I will tell you what he says to me. ” So he went up to a barren height , and God met him there . Balaam told the Lord , “ I have prepared seven altars and have sacrificed a young bull and a ram on each. ”
TLB	Numbers	23	5	Then the Lord gave Balaam a message for King Balak .
TLB	Numbers	23	6	When Balaam returned , the king was standing beside the burnt offerings with all the princes of Moab . 7-10 This was Balaam ’ s message : “ King Balak , king of Moab , has brought me From the land of Aram , From the eastern mountains . ‘ Come , ’ he told me , ‘ curse Jacob for me ! Let your anger rise on Israel. ’ But how can I curse What God has not cursed ? How can I denounce A people God has not denounced ? I see them from the cliff tops , I watch them from the hills . They live alone , And prefer to remain distinct From every other nation . They are as numerous as dust ! They are beyond numbering . If only I could die as happy as an Israelite ! Oh , that my end might be like theirs ! ”
TLB	Numbers	23	11	“ What have you done to me ? ” demanded King Balak . “ I told you to curse my enemies , and now you have blessed them ! ”
TLB	Numbers	23	12	But Balaam replied , “ Can I say anything except what Jehovah tells me to ? ”
TLB	Numbers	23	13	Then Balak told him , “ Come with me to another place ; there you will see only a portion of the nation of Israel . Curse at least that many ! ”
TLB	Numbers	23	14	So King Balak took Balaam into the fields of Zophim at the top of Mount Pisgah , and built seven altars there ; and he offered up a young bull and a ram on each altar .
TLB	Numbers	23	15	Then Balaam said to the king , “ Stand here by your burnt offering while I go to meet the Lord. ”
TLB	Numbers	23	16	And the Lord met Balaam and told him what to say .
TLB	Numbers	23	17	So he returned to where the king and the princes of Moab were standing beside their burnt offerings . “ What has Jehovah said ? ” the king eagerly inquired . 18-24 And he replied , “ Rise up , Balak , and hear : Listen to me , you son of Zippor . God is not a man , that he should lie ; He doesn ’ t change his mind like humans do . Has he ever promised , Without doing what he said ? Look ! I have received a command to bless them , For God has blessed them , And I can not reverse it ! He has not seen sin in Jacob . He will not trouble Israel ! Jehovah their God is with them . He is their king ! God has brought them out of Egypt . Israel has the strength of a wild ox . No curse can be placed on Jacob , And no magic shall be done against him . For now it shall be said of Israel , ‘ What wonders God has done for them ! ’ These people rise up as a lion ; They shall not lie down Until they have eaten what they capture And have drunk the blood of the slain ! ”
TLB	Numbers	23	25	“ If you aren ’ t going to curse them , at least don ’ t bless them ! ” the king exclaimed to Balaam .
TLB	Numbers	23	26	But Balaam replied , “ Didn ’ t I tell you that I must say whatever Jehovah tells me to ? ”
TLB	Numbers	23	27	Then the king said to Balaam , “ I will take you to yet another place . Perhaps it will please God to let you curse them from there. ”
TLB	Numbers	23	28	So King Balak took Balaam to the top of Mount Peor , overlooking the desert .
TLB	Numbers	23	29	Balaam again told the king to build seven altars , and to prepare seven young bulls and seven rams for the sacrifice .
TLB	Numbers	23	30	The king did as Balaam said , and offered a young bull and ram on every altar . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Numbers	24	24	Balaam realized by now that Jehovah planned to bless Israel , so he didn ’ t even go to meet the Lord as he had earlier . Instead , he went at once and looked out toward the camp of Israel
TLB	Numbers	24	2	which stretched away across the plains , divided by tribal areas . Then the Spirit of God came upon him , 3-9 and he spoke this prophecy concerning them : “ Balaam the son of Beor says— The man whose eyes are open says— ‘ I have listened to the word of God , I have seen what God Almighty showed me ; I fell , and my eyes were opened : Oh , the joys awaiting Israel , Joys in the homes of Jacob . I see them spread before me as green valleys , And fruitful gardens by the riverside ; As aloes planted by the Lord himself ; As cedar trees beside the waters . They shall be blessed with an abundance of water , And they shall live in many places . Their king will be greater than Agag ; Their kingdom is exalted . God has brought them from Egypt . Israel has the strength of a wild ox , And shall eat up the nations that oppose him ; He shall break their bones in pieces , And shall shoot them with many arrows . Israel sleeps as a lion or a lioness— Who dares arouse him ? Blessed is everyone who blesses you , O Israel , And curses shall fall upon everyone who curses you. ’ ”
TLB	Numbers	24	10	King Balak was livid with rage by now . Striking his hands together in anger and disgust he shouted , “ I called you to curse my enemies and instead you have blessed them three times .
TLB	Numbers	24	11	Get out of here ! Go back home ! I had planned to promote you to great honor , but Jehovah has kept you from it ! ”
TLB	Numbers	24	12	Balaam replied , “ Didn ’ t I tell your messengers
TLB	Numbers	24	13	that even if you gave me a palace filled with silver and gold , I could not go beyond the words of Jehovah , and could not say a word of my own ? I said that I would say only what Jehovah says !
TLB	Numbers	24	14	Yes , I shall return now to my own people . But first , let me tell you what the Israelites are going to do to your people ! ” 15-19 So he spoke this prophecy to him : “ Balaam the son of Beor is the man Whose eyes are open ! He hears the words of God And has knowledge from the Most High ; He sees what Almighty God has shown him ; He fell , and his eyes were opened : I see in the future of Israel , Far down the distant trail , That there shall come a star from Jacob ! This ruler of Israel Shall smite the people of Moab , And destroy the sons of Sheth . Israel shall possess all Edom and Seir . They shall overcome their enemies . Jacob shall arise in power And shall destroy many cities. ”
TLB	Numbers	24	20	Then Balaam looked over at the homes of the people of Amalek and prophesied : “ Amalek was the first of the nations , But its destiny is destruction ! ” 21-22 Then he looked over at the Kenites : “ Yes , you are strongly situated , Your nest is set in the rocks ! But the Kenites shall be destroyed , And the mighty army of the king of Assyria shall deport you from this land ! ” 23-24 He concluded his prophecies by saying : “ Alas , who can live when God does this ? Ships shall come from the coasts of Cyprus , And shall oppress both Eber and Assyria . They too must be destroyed. ”
TLB	Numbers	24	25	So Balaam and Balak returned to their homes . [ a ] Footnotes - Numbers 24:25 So Balaam and Balak returned to their homes . But not before Balaam gave insidious advice that brought about the situation described in 25:1-3 . See 31:16 . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Numbers	25	25	While Israel was camped at Acacia , some of the young men began going to wild parties with the local Moabite girls .
TLB	Numbers	25	2	These girls also invited them to attend the sacrifices to their gods , and soon the men were not only attending the feasts , but also bowing down and worshiping the idols .
TLB	Numbers	25	3	Before long all Israel was joining freely in the worship of Baal , the god of Moab ; and the anger of the Lord was hot against his people .
TLB	Numbers	25	4	He issued the following command to Moses : “ Execute all the tribal leaders of Israel . Hang them up before the Lord in broad daylight , so that his fierce anger will turn away from the people. ”
TLB	Numbers	25	5	So Moses ordered the judges to execute all who had worshiped Baal .
TLB	Numbers	25	6	But one of the Israeli men insolently brought a Midianite girl into the camp , right before the eyes of Moses and all the people , as they were weeping at the door of the Tabernacle .
TLB	Numbers	25	7	When Phinehas ( son of Eleazar and grandson of Aaron the priest ) saw this , he jumped up , grabbed a spear ,
TLB	Numbers	25	8	and rushed after the man into his tent , where he had taken the girl . He thrust the spear all the way through the man ’ s body and into her stomach . So the plague was stopped ,
TLB	Numbers	25	9	but only after 24,000 people had already died . 10-11 Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Phinehas ( son of Eleazar and grandson of Aaron the priest ) has turned away my anger for he was angry with my anger , and would not tolerate the worship of any God but me . So I have stopped destroying all Israel as I had intended . 12-13 Now because of what he has done—because of his zeal for his God , and because he has made atonement for the people of Israel by what he did—I promise that he and his descendants shall be priests forever. ”
TLB	Numbers	25	14	The name of the man who was killed with the Midianite girl was Zimri , son of Salu , a leader of the tribe of Simeon .
TLB	Numbers	25	15	The girl ’ s name was Cozbi , daughter of Zur , a Midianite prince . 16-17 Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Destroy the Midianites ,
TLB	Numbers	25	18	for they are destroying you with their wiles . They are causing you to worship Baal , and they are leading you astray , as you have just seen by the death of Cozbi. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Numbers	26	26	After the plague had ended , Jehovah said to Moses and to Eleazar ( son of Aaron the priest ) ,
TLB	Numbers	26	2	“ Take a census of all the men of Israel who are twenty years old or older , to find out how many of each tribe and clan are able to go to war. ” 3-4 So Moses and Eleazar issued census instructions to the leaders of Israel . ( The entire nation was camped in the plains of Moab beside the Jordan River , opposite Jericho . ) Here are the results of the census : 5-11 The tribe of Reuben : 43,730 .

( A subclan of the Shuthelahites was the Eranites , named after their ancestor Eran , a son of Shuthelah . ) The Becherites , named after their ancestor Becher . The Tahanites , named after their ancestor Tahan . 38-41 The tribe of Benjamin : 45,600 .

TLB	Numbers	26	51	So the total number of the men of draft age throughout Israel was 601,730 . 52-53 Then the Lord told Moses to divide the land among the tribes in proportion to their population , as indicated by the census—
TLB	Numbers	26	54	the larger tribes to be given more land , the smaller tribes less land . 55-56 “ Let the representatives of the larger tribes have a lottery , drawing for the larger sections , ” the Lord instructed , “ and let the smaller tribes draw for the smaller sections. ”
TLB	Numbers	26	57	These are the clans of the Levites numbered in the census : The Gershonites , named after their ancestor Gershon . The Kohathites , named after their ancestor Kohath . The Merarites , named after their ancestor Merari . 58-59 These are the families of the tribe of Levi : the Libnites , the Hebronites , the Mahlites , the Mushites , the Korahites . While Levi was in Egypt , a daughter , Jochebed , was born to him and she became the wife of Amram , son of Kohath . They were the parents of Aaron , Moses , and Miriam .
TLB	Numbers	26	60	To Aaron were born Nadab , Abihu , Eleazar , and Ithamar .
TLB	Numbers	26	61	But Nadab and Abihu died when they offered unauthorized incense before the Lord .
TLB	Numbers	26	62	The total number of Levites in the census was 23,000 , counting all the males a month old and upward . But the Levites were not included in the total census figure of the people of Israel , for the Levites were given no land when it was divided among the tribes .
TLB	Numbers	26	63	So these are the census figures as prepared by Moses and Eleazar the priest , in the plains of Moab beside the Jordan River , across from Jericho . 64-65 Not one person in this entire census had been counted in the previous census [ a ] taken in the wilderness of Sinai ! For all who had been counted then had died , as the Lord had decreed when he said of them , “ They shall die in the wilderness. ” The only exceptions were Caleb ( son of Jephunneh ) and Joshua ( son of Nun ) . Footnotes - Numbers 26:64 Not one person . . . had been counted in the previous census . Forty years earlier , at the time of the first census , they had been under twenty years of age , and so were not counted . All who at that time were older than twenty years of age were now dead .

TLB	Numbers	27	27	1-2 One day the daughters of Zelophehad came to the entrance of the Tabernacle to give a petition to Moses , Eleazar the priest , the tribal leaders , and others who were there . The names of these women were Mahlah , Noah , Hoglah , Milcah , and Tirzah . They were members of the half-tribe of Manasseh ( a son of Joseph ) . Their ancestor was Machir , son of Manasseh . Manasseh ’ s son Gilead was their great-grandfather , his son Hepher was their grandfather , and his son Zelophehad was their father . 3-4 “ Our father died in the wilderness , ” they said , “ and he was not one of those who perished in Korah ’ s revolt against the Lord—it was a natural death , but he had no sons . Why should the name of our father disappear just because he had no son ? We feel that we should be given property along with our father ’ s brothers. ”
TLB	Numbers	27	5	So Moses brought their case before the Lord . 6-7 And the Lord replied to Moses , “ The daughters of Zelophehad are correct . Give them land along with their uncles ; give them the property that would have been given to their father if he had lived .
TLB	Numbers	27	8	Moreover , this is a general law among you , that if a man dies and has no sons , then his inheritance shall be passed on to his daughters .
TLB	Numbers	27	9	And if he has no daughter , it shall belong to his brothers .
TLB	Numbers	27	10	And if he has no brother , then it shall go to his uncles .
TLB	Numbers	27	11	But if he has no uncles , then it shall go to the nearest relative. ”
TLB	Numbers	27	12	One day the Lord said to Moses , “ Go up into Mount Abarim and look across the river to the land I have given to the people of Israel .
TLB	Numbers	27	13	After you have seen it , you shall die as Aaron your brother did ,
TLB	Numbers	27	14	for you rebelled against my instructions in the wilderness of Zin . When the people of Israel rebelled , you did not glorify me [ a ] before them by following my instructions to order water to come out of the rock. ” He was referring to the incident at the waters of Meribah ( “ Place of Strife ” ) in Kadesh , in the wilderness of Zin .
TLB	Numbers	27	15	Then Moses said to the Lord ,
TLB	Numbers	27	16	“ O Jehovah , the God of the spirits of all mankind , before I am taken away [ b ] please appoint a new leader for the people ,
TLB	Numbers	27	17	a man who will lead them into battle and care for them , so that the people of the Lord will not be as sheep without a shepherd. ”
TLB	Numbers	27	18	The Lord replied , “ Go and get Joshua ( son of Nun ) , who has the Spirit in him ,
TLB	Numbers	27	19	and take him to Eleazar the priest , and as all the people watch , charge him with the responsibility of leading the people .
TLB	Numbers	27	20	Publicly give him your authority so that all the people of Israel will obey him .
TLB	Numbers	27	21	He shall be the one to consult with Eleazar the priest in order to get directions from the Lord . The Lord will speak to Eleazar through the use of the Urim , and Eleazar will pass on these instructions to Joshua and the people . In this way the Lord will continue to give them guidance. ”
TLB	Numbers	27	22	So Moses did as Jehovah commanded and took Joshua to Eleazar the priest . As the people watched ,
TLB	Numbers	27	23	Moses laid his hands upon him and dedicated him to his responsibilities , as the Lord had commanded . Footnotes - Numbers 27:14 you did not glorify me , implied . - Numbers 27:16 before I am taken away , implied . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Numbers	28	28	1-2 The Lord gave Moses these instructions to give to the people of Israel : “ The offerings which you burn on the altar for me are my food , and are a pleasure to me ; so see to it that they are brought regularly and are offered as I have instructed you .
TLB	Numbers	28	3	“ When you make offerings by fire , you shall use yearling male lambs—each without defect . Two of them shall be offered each day as a regular burnt offering .
TLB	Numbers	28	4	One lamb shall be sacrificed in the morning , the other in the evening .
TLB	Numbers	28	5	With them shall be offered a grain offering of three quarts of finely ground flour mixed with three pints of oil .
TLB	Numbers	28	6	This is the burnt offering ordained at Mount Sinai , to be regularly offered as a fragrant odor , an offering made by fire to the Lord .
TLB	Numbers	28	7	Along with it shall be the drink offering , consisting of three pints of strong wine with each lamb , poured out in the holy place before the Lord .
TLB	Numbers	28	8	Offer the second lamb in the evening with the same grain offering and drink offering . It too is a fragrant odor to the Lord , an offering made by fire . 9-10 “ On the Sabbath day , sacrifice two yearling male lambs—both without defect—in addition to the regular offerings . They are to be accompanied by a grain offering of six quarts of fine flour mixed with oil , and the usual drink offering .

TLB	Numbers	28	12	Accompany them with nine quarts of finely ground flour mixed with oil as a grain offering with each bull ; and six quarts of finely ground flour mixed with oil as a grain offering for the ram ;
TLB	Numbers	28	13	and for each lamb , three quarts of finely ground flour mixed with oil for a grain offering . This burnt offering shall be presented by fire and will please the Lord very much .
TLB	Numbers	28	14	Along with each sacrifice shall be a drink offering—six pints of wine with each bull , four pints for a ram , and three pints for a lamb . This , then , will be the burnt offering each month throughout the year .

TLB	Numbers	30	30	1-2 Now Moses summoned the leaders of the tribes and told them , “ The Lord has commanded that when anyone makes a promise to the Lord , either to do something or to quit doing something , that vow must not be broken : the person making the vow must do exactly as he has promised .
TLB	Numbers	30	3	“ If a woman promises the Lord to do or not do something , and she is still a girl at home in her father ’ s home ,
TLB	Numbers	30	4	and her father hears that she has made a vow with penalties , but says nothing , then her vow shall stand .
TLB	Numbers	30	5	But if her father refuses to let her make the vow , or feels that the penalties she has agreed to are too harsh , then her promise will automatically become invalid . Her father must state his disagreement on the first day he hears about it ; and then Jehovah will forgive her because her father would not let her do it .
TLB	Numbers	30	6	“ If she takes a vow or makes a foolish pledge , and later marries ,
TLB	Numbers	30	7	and her husband learns of her vow and says nothing on the day he hears of it , her vow shall stand .
TLB	Numbers	30	8	But if her husband refuses to accept her vow or foolish pledge , his disagreement makes it void , and Jehovah will forgive her .
TLB	Numbers	30	9	“ But if the woman is a widow or is divorced , she must fulfill her vow .
TLB	Numbers	30	10	“ If she is married and living in her husband ’ s home when she makes the vow ,
TLB	Numbers	30	11	and her husband hears of it and does nothing , the vow shall stand ;
TLB	Numbers	30	12	but if he refuses to allow it on the first day he hears of it , her vow is void and Jehovah will forgive her .
TLB	Numbers	30	13	So her husband may either confirm or nullify her vow ,
TLB	Numbers	30	14	but if he says nothing for a day , then he has already agreed to it .
TLB	Numbers	30	15	If he waits more than a day and then refuses to permit the vow , whatever penalties to which she agreed shall come upon him—he shall be responsible. ”
TLB	Numbers	30	16	These , then , are the commandments the Lord gave Moses concerning relationships between a man and his wife and between a father and his daughter who is living at home . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Numbers	31	31	So Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the Lord commanded . 32-35 The total booty ( besides the jewelry , clothing , etc. , which the soldiers kept for themselves ) was 675,000 sheep ; 72,000 oxen ; 61,000 donkeys ; and 32,000 young girls . 36-40 So the half given to the army totaled : 337,500 sheep ( of which
TLB	Numbers	31	3	Moses said to the people , “ Some of you must take arms to wage Jehovah ’ s war against Midian . 4-5 Conscript 1,000 men from each tribe. ” So this was done ; and out of the many thousands of Israel , 12,000 armed men were sent to battle by Moses .
TLB	Numbers	31	6	Phinehas ( son of Eleazar the priest ) led them into battle , accompanied by the Ark , [ a ] with trumpets blaring .
TLB	Numbers	31	7	And every man of Midian was killed .
TLB	Numbers	31	8	Among those killed were all five of the Midianite kings—Evi , Rekem , Zur , Hur , and Reba . Balaam , the son of Beor , was also killed . 9-11 Then the Israeli army took as captives all the women and children , and seized the cattle and flocks and a lot of miscellaneous booty . All of the cities , towns , and villages of Midian were then burned .
TLB	Numbers	31	12	The captives and other war loot were brought to Moses and Eleazar the priest , and to the rest of the people of Israel who were camped on the plains of Moab beside the Jordan River , across from Jericho .
TLB	Numbers	31	13	Moses and Eleazar the priest and all the leaders of the people went out to meet the victorious army ,
TLB	Numbers	31	14	but Moses was very angry with the army officers and battalion leaders .
TLB	Numbers	31	15	“ Why have you let all the women live ? ” he demanded .
TLB	Numbers	31	16	“ These are the very ones who followed Balaam ’ s advice and caused the people of Israel to worship idols on Mount Peor , and they are the cause of the plague that destroyed us .
TLB	Numbers	31	17	Now kill all the boys and all the women who have had sexual intercourse .
TLB	Numbers	31	18	Only the little girls may live ; you may keep them for yourselves .
TLB	Numbers	31	19	Now stay outside of the camp for seven days , all of you who have killed anyone or touched a dead body . Then purify yourselves and your captives on the third and seventh days .
TLB	Numbers	31	20	Remember also to purify all your garments and everything made of leather , goat ’ s hair , or wood. ”
TLB	Numbers	31	21	Then Eleazar the priest said to the men who were in the battle , “ This is the commandment Jehovah has given Moses :
TLB	Numbers	31	22	‘ Anything that will stand heat—such as gold , silver , bronze , iron , tin , or lead—
TLB	Numbers	31	23	shall be passed through fire in order to be made ceremonially pure ; it must then be further purified with the purification water . But anything that won ’ t stand heat shall be purified by the water alone. ’
TLB	Numbers	31	24	On the seventh day you must wash your clothes and be purified , and then you may come back into the camp. ”
TLB	Numbers	31	25	And the Lord said to Moses ,
TLB	Numbers	31	26	“ You and Eleazar the priest and the leaders of the tribes are to make a list of all the loot , including the people and animals ;
TLB	Numbers	31	27	then divide it into two parts . Half of it is for the men who were in the battle , and the other half is to be given to the people of Israel .
TLB	Numbers	31	28	But first , the Lord gets a share of all the captives , oxen , donkeys , and flocks kept by the army . His share is one out of every five hundred .
TLB	Numbers	31	29	Give this share to Eleazar the priest to be presented to the Lord by the gesture of waving before the altar .
TLB	Numbers	31	30	Also levy a
TLB	Numbers	31	2	percent of these to the Levites . 48-49 Then the officers and battalion leaders came to Moses and said , “ We have accounted for all the men who went out to battle , and not one of us is missing !
TLB	Numbers	31	675	were given to the Lord ) ; 36,000 oxen ( of which
TLB	Numbers	31	72	were given to the Lord ) ; 30,500 donkeys ( of which
TLB	Numbers	31	61	were given to the Lord ) ; 16,000 girls ( of whom
TLB	Numbers	31	32	went to the Levites [ b ] ) .
TLB	Numbers	31	41	All of the Lord ’ s portion was given to Eleazar the priest , as the Lord had directed Moses . 42-46 The half of the booty assigned to the people of Israel—Moses had separated it from the half belonging to the warriors—amounted to : 337,500 sheep , 36,000 oxen , 30,500 donkeys , and 16,000 girls .
TLB	Numbers	31	47	In accordance with the Lord ’ s directions , Moses gave
TLB	Numbers	31	50	So we have brought a special thank offering to the Lord from our loot—gold jewelry , bracelets , anklets , rings , earrings , and necklaces . This is to make atonement for our souls before the Lord. ” 51-52 Moses and Eleazar the priest received this special offering from the captains and battalion leaders and company commanders , and found its total value to be more than $ 300,000 .
TLB	Numbers	31	53	( The soldiers had also kept personal loot for themselves . )
TLB	Numbers	31	54	The offering was taken into the Tabernacle and kept there before the Lord as a memorial of the people of Israel .

TLB	Numbers	32	32	we will follow the Lord fully armed into Canaan , but our own land shall be here on this side of the Jordan. ”
TLB	Numbers	32	2	So they came to Moses and Eleazar the priest and the other tribal leaders and said , 3-4 “ The Lord has used Israel to destroy the population of this whole countryside—Ataroth , Dibon , Jazer , Nimrah , Heshbon , Elealeh , Sebam , Nebo , and Beon . And it is all wonderful sheep country , ideal for our flocks .
TLB	Numbers	32	5	Please let us have this land as our portion instead of the land on the other side of the Jordan River. ”
TLB	Numbers	32	6	“ You mean you want to sit here while your brothers go across and do all the fighting ? ” Moses demanded .
TLB	Numbers	32	7	“ Are you trying to discourage the rest of the people from going across to the land that the Lord has given them ?
TLB	Numbers	32	8	This is the same kind of thing your fathers did ! I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to spy out the land ,
TLB	Numbers	32	9	but when they finished their survey and returned from the valley of Eshcol , they discouraged the people from going on into the Promised Land . 10-11 And the Lord ’ s anger was hot against them , and he swore that of all those he had rescued from Egypt , no one over twenty years of age would ever see the land he promised Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , for they had refused to do what he wanted them to .
TLB	Numbers	32	12	“ The only exceptions were Caleb ( son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite ) and Joshua ( son of Nun ) —for they wholeheartedly followed the Lord and urged the people to go on into the Promised Land .
TLB	Numbers	32	13	“ The Lord made us wander back and forth in the wilderness for forty years until all that evil generation died .
TLB	Numbers	32	14	But here you are , a brood of sinners doing exactly the same thing ! Only there are more of you , so Jehovah ’ s anger against Israel will be even fiercer this time .
TLB	Numbers	32	15	If you turn away from God like this , he will make the people stay even longer in the wilderness , and you will be responsible for destroying his people and bringing disaster to this entire nation ! ”
TLB	Numbers	32	16	“ Not at all ! ” they explained . “ We will build sheepfolds for our flocks and cities for our little ones ,
TLB	Numbers	32	17	but we ourselves will go over armed , ahead of the rest of the people of Israel , until we have brought them safely to their inheritance . But first we will need to build walled cities here for our families , to keep them safe from attack by the local inhabitants .
TLB	Numbers	32	18	We will not settle down here until all the people of Israel have received their inheritance .
TLB	Numbers	32	19	We don ’ t want land on the other side of the Jordan ; we would rather have it on this side , on the east. ”
TLB	Numbers	32	20	Then Moses said , “ All right , if you will do what you have said and arm yourselves for Jehovah ’ s war ,
TLB	Numbers	32	21	and keep your troops across the Jordan until the Lord has driven out his enemies ,
TLB	Numbers	32	22	then , when the land is finally subdued before the Lord , you may return . Then you will have discharged your duty to the Lord and to the rest of the people of Israel . And the land on the eastern side shall be your possession from the Lord .
TLB	Numbers	32	23	But if you don ’ t do as you have said , then you will have sinned against the Lord , and you may be sure that your sin will catch up with you .
TLB	Numbers	32	24	Go ahead and build cities for your families and sheepfolds for your sheep , and do all you have said. ”
TLB	Numbers	32	25	“ We will follow your instructions exactly , ” the people of Gad and Reuben replied .
TLB	Numbers	32	26	“ Our children , wives , flocks , and cattle shall stay here in the cities of Gilead .
TLB	Numbers	32	27	But all of us who are conscripted will go over to battle for the Lord , just as you have said. ”
TLB	Numbers	32	28	So Moses gave his approval by saying to Eleazar , Joshua , and the tribal leaders of Israel ,
TLB	Numbers	32	29	“ If all the men of the tribes of Gad and Reuben who are conscripted for the Lord ’ s battles go with you over the Jordan , then , when the land is conquered , you must give them the land of Gilead ;
TLB	Numbers	32	30	but if they refuse , then they must accept land among the rest of you in the land of Canaan. ”
TLB	Numbers	32	31	The tribes of Gad and Reuben said again , “ As the Lord has commanded , so we will do—
TLB	Numbers	32	33	So Moses assigned the territory of King Sihon of the Amorites , and of King Og of Bashan—all the land and cities—to the tribes of Gad , Reuben , and the half-tribe of Manasseh ( son of Joseph ) . 34-36 The people of Gad built these cities : Dibon , Ataroth , Aroer , Atroth-shophan , Jazer , Jogbehah , Beth-nimrah , Beth-haran . They were all fortified cities with sheepfolds . 37-38 The children of Reuben built the following cities : Heshbon , Elealeh , Kiriathaim , Nebo , Baal-meon , Sibmah . ( The Israelites later changed the names of some of these cities they had conquered and rebuilt . )
TLB	Numbers	32	39	Then the clan of Machir of the tribe of Manasseh went to Gilead and conquered it , and drove out the Amorites who were living there .
TLB	Numbers	32	40	So Moses gave Gilead to the Machirites , and they lived there .
TLB	Numbers	32	41	The men of Jair , another clan of the tribe of Manasseh , occupied many of the towns in Gilead , and changed the name of their area to Havroth-jair .
TLB	Numbers	32	42	Meanwhile , a man named Nobah led an army [ a ] to Kenath and its surrounding villages , and occupied them , and he called the area Nobah , after his own name . Footnotes - Numbers 32:42 led an army , implied . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Numbers	33	33	This is the itinerary of the nation of Israel from the time Moses and Aaron led them out of Egypt .
TLB	Numbers	33	2	Moses had written down their movements as the Lord had instructed him . 3-4 They left the city of Rameses , Egypt , on the first day of April , [ a ] the day after the night of the Passover . They left proudly , hurried along by the Egyptians who were burying all their eldest sons , killed by the Lord the night before . The Lord had certainly defeated all the gods of Egypt that night ! 5-6 After leaving Rameses , they stayed in Succoth , Etham ( at the edge of the wilderness ) , and
TLB	Numbers	33	7	Pihahiroth ( near Baal-zephon , where they camped at the foot of Mount Migdol ) .
TLB	Numbers	33	8	From there they went through the middle of the Red Sea and on for three days into the wilderness of Etham , camping at Marah .
TLB	Numbers	33	9	Leaving Marah , they came to Elim , where there are twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees ; they stayed there for quite a long time .
TLB	Numbers	33	10	Leaving Elim , they camped beside the Red Sea ,
TLB	Numbers	33	11	and then in the wilderness of Sihn .
TLB	Numbers	33	12	Next was Dophkah ,
TLB	Numbers	33	13	and then Alush ;
TLB	Numbers	33	14	then on to Rephidim ( where there was no water for the people to drink ) . 15-37 From Rephidim they went to the wilderness of Sinai ; from the wilderness of Sinai to Kibroth-hattaavah ; From Kibroth-hattaavah to Hazeroth ; From Hazeroth to Rithmah ; From Rithmah to Rimmon-parez ; From Rimmon-parez to Libnah ; From Libnah to Rissah ; From Rissah to Kehelathah ; From Kehelathah to Mount Shepher ; From Mount Shepher to Haradah ; From Haradah to Makheloth ; From Makheloth to Tahath ; From Tahath to Terah ; From Terah to Mithkah ; From Mithkah to Hashmonah ; From Hashmonah to Moseroth ; From Moseroth to Bene-jaakan ; From Bene-jaakan to Hor-haggidgad ; From Hor-haggidgad to Jotbathah ; From Jotbathah to Abronah ; From Abronah to Ezion-geber ; From Ezion-geber to Kadesh ( in the wilderness of Zin ) ; From Kadesh to Mount Hor ( at the edge of the land of Edom ) . 38-39 While they were at the foot of Mount Hor , Aaron the priest was directed by the Lord to go up into the mountain , and there he died . This occurred during the fortieth year after the people of Israel had left Egypt . The date of his death was July

TLB	Numbers	33	123	years old .
TLB	Numbers	33	40	It was then that the Canaanite king of Arad , who lived in the Negeb , in the land of Canaan , heard that the people of Israel were approaching his land .
TLB	Numbers	33	41	After dealing with him , the Israelis journeyed from Mount Hor and camped in Zalmonah ,
TLB	Numbers	33	42	then at Punon ,
TLB	Numbers	33	43	then at Oboth ,
TLB	Numbers	33	44	then Iyeabarim ( at the border of Moab ) .
TLB	Numbers	33	45	From there they went to Dibon-gad ,
TLB	Numbers	33	46	and then to Almon-diblathaim ,
TLB	Numbers	33	47	and on into the mountains of Abarim , near Mount Nebo ,
TLB	Numbers	33	48	and finally to the plains of Moab beside the river Jordan , opposite Jericho .
TLB	Numbers	33	49	While in that area they camped at various places along the Jordan River , from Bethjeshimoth as far as Abel-shittim , on the plains of Moab . 50-51 It was while they were camped there that the Lord told Moses to tell the people of Israel , “ When you pass across the Jordan River into the land of Canaan ,
TLB	Numbers	33	52	you must drive out all the people living there and destroy all their idols—their carved stones , molten images , and the open-air sanctuaries in the hills where they worship their idols .
TLB	Numbers	33	53	I have given the land to you ; take it and live there .
TLB	Numbers	33	54	You will be given land in proportion to the size of your tribes . The larger sections of land will be divided by lot among the larger tribes , and the smaller sections will be allotted to the smaller tribes .
TLB	Numbers	33	55	But if you refuse to drive out the people living there , those who remain will be as cinders in your eyes and thorns in your sides .
TLB	Numbers	33	56	And I will destroy you as I had planned for you to destroy them. ” Footnotes - Numbers 33:3 on the first day of April , literally , “ on the fifteenth day of the first month ” ( of the Hebrew calendar ) . - Numbers 33:38 July

TLB	Numbers	34	34	1-2 The Lord told Moses to tell the people of Israel , “ When you come into the land of Canaan ( I am giving you the entire land as your homeland ) ,
TLB	Numbers	34	3	the southern portion of the country will be the wilderness of Zin , along the edge of Edom . The southern boundary will begin at the Dead Sea ,
TLB	Numbers	34	4	and will continue south past Scorpion Pass [ a ] in the direction of Zin . Its southernmost point will be Kadesh-barnea , from which it will go to Hazaraddar , and on to Azmon .
TLB	Numbers	34	5	From Azmon the boundary will follow the brook of Egypt down to the Mediterranean Sea .
TLB	Numbers	34	6	“ Your western boundary will be the coastline of the Mediterranean Sea . 7-9 “ Your northern border will begin at the Mediterranean Sea and will proceed eastward to Mount Hor , then to Lebo-Hamath , and on through Zedad and Ziphron to Hazar-enan . 10-11 “ The eastern border will be from Hazar-enan south to Shepham , then on to Riblah at the east side of Ain . From there it will make a large half-circle , first going south and then westward until it touches the southernmost tip of the Sea of Galilee ,
TLB	Numbers	34	12	and then along the Jordan River , ending at the Dead Sea. ”
TLB	Numbers	34	13	“ This is the territory you are to apportion among yourselves by lot , ” Moses said . “ It is to be divided up among the nine and one-half tribes , 14-15 for the tribes of Reuben and Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh have already been assigned land on the east side of the Jordan , opposite Jericho. ” 16-28 And the Lord said to Moses , “ These are the names of the men I have appointed to handle the dividing up of the land : Eleazar the priest , Joshua ( son of Nun ) , and one leader from each tribe , as listed below : |Tribe||Leader| |Judah||Caleb ( son of Jephunneh ) | |Simeon||Shemuel ( son of Ammihud ) | |Benjamin||Elidad ( son of Chislon ) | |Dan||Bukki ( son of Jogli ) | |Manasseh||Hanniel ( son of Ephod ) | |Ephraim||Kemuel ( son of Shiphtan ) | |Zebulun||Elizaphan ( son of Parnach ) | |Issachar||Paltiel ( son of Azzan ) | |Asher||Ahihud ( son of Shelomi ) | |Naphtali||Pedahel ( son of Ammihud ) |

TLB	Numbers	35	35	While Israel was camped beside the Jordan on the plains of Moab , opposite Jericho , the Lord said to Moses ,
TLB	Numbers	35	2	“ Instruct the people of Israel to give to the Levites as their inheritance certain cities and surrounding pasturelands .
TLB	Numbers	35	3	These cities are for their homes , and the surrounding lands for their cattle , flocks , and other livestock . 4-5 Their gardens and vineyards shall extend
TLB	Numbers	35	1500	feet beyond that for pastureland .

TLB	Numbers	35	7	In all , there shall be forty-eight cities with the surrounding pastureland given to the Levites .
TLB	Numbers	35	8	These cities shall be in various parts of the nation ; the larger tribes with many cities will give several to the Levites , while the smaller tribes will give fewer. ” 9-10 And the Lord said to Moses , “ Tell the people that when they arrive in the land ,
TLB	Numbers	35	11	Cities of Refuge shall be designated for anyone to flee into if he has killed someone accidentally .
TLB	Numbers	35	12	These cities will be places of protection from the dead man ’ s relatives who want to avenge his death ; for the slayer must not be killed unless a fair trial establishes his guilt . 13-14 Three of these six Cities of Refuge are to be located in the land of Canaan , and three on the east side of the Jordan River .
TLB	Numbers	35	15	These are not only for the protection of Israelites , but also for foreigners and travelers .
TLB	Numbers	35	16	“ But if someone is struck and killed by a piece of iron , it must be presumed to be murder , and the murderer must be executed .
TLB	Numbers	35	17	Or if the slain man was struck down with a large stone , it is murder , and the murderer shall die .
TLB	Numbers	35	18	The same is true if he is killed with a wooden weapon .
TLB	Numbers	35	19	The avenger of his death shall personally kill the murderer when he meets him .
TLB	Numbers	35	20	So if anyone kills another out of hatred by throwing something at him , or ambushing him ,
TLB	Numbers	35	21	or angrily striking him with his fist so that he dies , he is a murderer ; and the murderer shall be executed by the avenger . 22-23 “ But if it is an accident—a case in which something is thrown unintentionally , or in which a stone is thrown without anger , without realizing it will hit anyone , and without wanting to harm an enemy—yet the man dies ,
TLB	Numbers	35	24	then the people shall judge whether or not it was an accident , and whether or not to hand the killer over to the avenger of the dead man .
TLB	Numbers	35	25	If it is decided that it was accidental , then the people shall save the killer from the avenger ; the killer shall be permitted to stay in the City of Refuge ; and he must live there until the death of the High Priest .
TLB	Numbers	35	26	“ If the slayer leaves the city ,
TLB	Numbers	35	27	and the avenger finds him outside and kills him , it is not murder ,
TLB	Numbers	35	28	for the man should have stayed inside the city until the death of the High Priest . But after the death of the High Priest , the man may return to his own land and home .
TLB	Numbers	35	29	These are permanent laws for all Israel from generation to generation .
TLB	Numbers	35	30	“ All murderers must be executed , but only if there is more than one witness ; no man shall die with only one person testifying against him .
TLB	Numbers	35	31	Whenever anyone is judged guilty of murder , he must die—no ransom may be accepted for him .
TLB	Numbers	35	32	Nor may a payment be accepted from a refugee in a City of Refuge , permitting him to return to his home before the death of the High Priest .
TLB	Numbers	35	33	In this way the land will not be polluted , for murder pollutes the land , and no atonement can be made for murder except by the execution of the murderer .
TLB	Numbers	35	34	You shall not defile the land where you are going to live , for I , Jehovah , will be living there. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Numbers	36	36	1-2 Then the heads of the subclan of Gilead ( of the clan of Machir , of the tribe of Manasseh , one of the sons of Joseph ) came to Moses and the leaders of Israel with a petition : “ The Lord instructed you to divide the land by lot among the people of Israel , ” they reminded Moses , “ and to give the inheritance of our brother Zelophehad to his daughters .
TLB	Numbers	36	3	But if they marry into another tribe , their land will go with them to the tribe into which they marry . In this way the total area of our tribe will be reduced
TLB	Numbers	36	4	and will not be returned at the Year of Jubilee. ”
TLB	Numbers	36	5	Then Moses replied publicly , giving them these instructions from the Lord : “ The men of the tribe of Joseph have a proper complaint .
TLB	Numbers	36	6	This is what the Lord has further commanded concerning the daughters of Zelophehad : ‘ Let them be married to anyone they like , so long as it is within their own tribe .
TLB	Numbers	36	7	In this way none of the land of the tribe will shift to any other tribe , for the inheritance of every tribe is to remain permanently as it was first allotted .
TLB	Numbers	36	8	The girls throughout the tribes of Israel who are heiresses must marry within their own tribe , so that their land won ’ t leave the tribe .
TLB	Numbers	36	9	In this way no inheritance shall move from one tribe to another. ’ ”
TLB	Numbers	36	10	The daughters of Zelophehad did as the Lord commanded Moses . 11-12 These girls , Mahlah , Tirzah , Hoglah , Milcah , and Noah , were married to men in their own tribe of Manasseh ( son of Joseph ) ; so their inheritance remained in their tribe .

TLB	Deuteronomy	1	1	1-5 This book records Moses ’ address to the people of Israel when they were camped in the valley of the Arabah in the wilderness of Moab , east of the Jordan River . ( Cities in the area included Suph , Paran , Tophel , Laban , Hazeroth , and Dizahab . ) The speech was given on February
TLB	Deuteronomy	1	15	, literally , “ the first day of the eleventh month ” ( of the Hebrew calendar ) . eleven days to travel by foot from Mount Horeb to Kadesh-barnea . Kadesh-barnea was at the southern edge of the Promised Land . - Deuteronomy 1:19 on the border of the Promised Land , implied . The Living Bible copyright ©
TLB	Deuteronomy	1	6	“ It was forty years ago , at Mount Horeb , that Jehovah our God told us , ‘ You have stayed here long enough .
TLB	Deuteronomy	1	7	Now go and occupy the hill country of the Amorites , the valley of the Arabah , and the Negeb , and all the land of Canaan and Lebanon—the entire area from the shores of the Mediterranean Sea to the Euphrates River .
TLB	Deuteronomy	1	8	I am giving all of it to you ! Go in and possess it , for it is the land the Lord promised to your ancestors Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , and all of their descendants. ’
TLB	Deuteronomy	1	9	“ At that time I told the people , ‘ I need help ! You are a great burden for me to carry all by myself ,
TLB	Deuteronomy	1	10	for the Lord has multiplied you to become as many as the stars !
TLB	Deuteronomy	1	11	And may he multiply you a thousand times more and bless you as he promised ,
TLB	Deuteronomy	1	12	but what can one man do to settle all your quarrels and problems ?
TLB	Deuteronomy	1	13	So choose some men from each tribe who are wise , experienced , and understanding , and I will appoint them as your leaders. ’
TLB	Deuteronomy	1	14	“ They agreed to this ;
TLB	Deuteronomy	1	16	I instructed them to be perfectly fair at all times , even to foreigners .
TLB	Deuteronomy	1	17	‘ When giving your decisions , ’ I told them , ‘ never favor a man because he is rich ; be fair to great and small alike . Don ’ t fear their displeasure , for you are judging in the place of God . Bring me any cases too difficult for you , and I will handle them. ’
TLB	Deuteronomy	1	18	And I gave them other instructions at that time also . 19-21 “ Then we left Mount Horeb and traveled through the great and terrible desert , finally arriving among the Amorite hills to which the Lord our God had directed us . We were then at Kadesh-barnea on the border of the Promised Land [ b ] and I said to the people , ‘ The Lord God has given us this land . Go and possess it as he told us to . Don ’ t be afraid ! Don ’ t even doubt ! ’
TLB	Deuteronomy	1	22	“ But they replied , ‘ First let ’ s send out spies to discover the best route of entry , and to decide which cities we should capture first. ’
TLB	Deuteronomy	1	23	“ This seemed like a good idea , so I chose twelve spies , one from each tribe . 24-25 They crossed into the hills and came to the valley of Eshcol , and returned with samples of the local fruit . One look was enough to convince us that it was indeed a good land the Lord our God had given us .
TLB	Deuteronomy	1	26	But the people refused to go in and rebelled against the Lord ’ s command .
TLB	Deuteronomy	1	27	“ They murmured and complained in their tents and said , ‘ The Lord must hate us , bringing us here from Egypt to be slaughtered by these Amorites .
TLB	Deuteronomy	1	28	What are we getting into ? Our brothers who spied out the land have frightened us with their report . They say that the people of the land are tall and powerful , and that the walls of their cities rise high into the sky ! They have even seen giants there—the descendants of the Anakim ! ’
TLB	Deuteronomy	1	29	“ But I said to them , ‘ Don ’ t be afraid !
TLB	Deuteronomy	1	30	The Lord God is your leader , and he will fight for you with his mighty miracles , just as you saw him do in Egypt .
TLB	Deuteronomy	1	31	And you know how he has cared for you again and again here in the wilderness , just as a father cares for his child ! ’
TLB	Deuteronomy	1	32	But nothing I said did any good . “ They refused to believe the Lord our God
TLB	Deuteronomy	1	33	who had led them all the way , and had selected the best places for them to camp , and had guided them by a pillar of fire at night and a pillar of cloud during the day . 34-35 “ Well , the Lord heard their complaining and was very angry . He vowed that not one person in that entire generation would live to see the good land he had promised their fathers ,
TLB	Deuteronomy	1	36	except Caleb ( the son of Jephunneh ) , who , because he had wholly followed the Lord , would receive as his personal inheritance some of the land he had walked over .
TLB	Deuteronomy	1	37	“ And the Lord was even angry with me because of them and said to me , ‘ You shall not enter the Promised Land !
TLB	Deuteronomy	1	38	Instead , your assistant , Joshua ( the son of Nun ) , shall lead the people . Encourage him as he prepares to take over the leadership .
TLB	Deuteronomy	1	39	I will give the land to the children they said would die in the wilderness .
TLB	Deuteronomy	1	40	But as for you of the older generation , turn around now and go on back across the desert toward the Red Sea. ’
TLB	Deuteronomy	1	41	“ Then they confessed , ‘ We have sinned ! We will go into the land and fight for it as the Lord our God has told us to. ’ So they strapped on their weapons and thought it would be easy to conquer the whole area .
TLB	Deuteronomy	1	42	“ But the Lord said to me , ‘ Tell them not to do it , for I will not go with them ; they will be struck down before their enemies. ’
TLB	Deuteronomy	1	43	“ I told them , but they wouldn ’ t listen . Instead , they rebelled again against the Lord ’ s commandment and went on up into the hill country to fight .
TLB	Deuteronomy	1	44	But the Amorites who lived there came out against them and chased them like bees and killed them from Seir to Hormah .
TLB	Deuteronomy	1	45	Then they returned and wept before the Lord , but he wouldn ’ t listen .
TLB	Deuteronomy	1	46	So they stayed there at Kadesh for a long time . Footnotes - Deuteronomy 1:1 February

TLB	Deuteronomy	2	2	Then at last the Lord said ,
TLB	Deuteronomy	2	3	‘ You have stayed here long enough . Turn northward .
TLB	Deuteronomy	2	4	Inform the people that they will be passing through the country belonging to their brothers the Edomites , the descendants of Esau who live in Seir ; the Edomites will be nervous , so be careful .
TLB	Deuteronomy	2	5	Don ’ t start a fight ! For I have given them all the Mount Seir hill country as their permanent possession , and I will not give you even a tiny piece of their land .
TLB	Deuteronomy	2	6	Pay them for whatever food or water you use .
TLB	Deuteronomy	2	7	The Lord your God has watched over you and blessed you every step of the way for all these forty years as you have wandered around in this great wilderness ; and you have lacked nothing in all that time. ’
TLB	Deuteronomy	2	8	“ So we passed through Edom where our brothers lived , crossing the Arabah Road that goes south to Elath and Ezion-geber , and traveling northward toward the wilderness of Moab .
TLB	Deuteronomy	2	9	“ Then the Lord warned us , ‘ Don ’ t attack the Moabites either , for I will not give you any of their land ; I have given it to the descendants of Lot. ’
TLB	Deuteronomy	2	10	“ ( The Emim used to live in that area , a very large tribe , tall as the giants of Anakim ;
TLB	Deuteronomy	2	11	both the Emim and the Anakim are often referred to as the Rephaim , but the Moabites call them Emim .
TLB	Deuteronomy	2	12	In earlier days the Horites lived in Seir , but they were driven out and displaced by the Edomites , the descendants of Esau , just as Israel would displace the peoples of Canaan , whose land had been assigned to Israel by the Lord . )
TLB	Deuteronomy	2	13	“ ‘ Now cross Zered Brook , ’ the Lord said ; and we did . 14-15 “ So it took us thirty-eight years to finally get across Zered Brook from Kadesh ! For the Lord had decreed that this could not happen until all the men , who thirty-eight years earlier were old enough to bear arms , had died . Yes , the hand of the Lord was against them until finally all were dead . 16-17 “ Then at last the Lord said to me ,
TLB	Deuteronomy	2	18	‘ Today Israel shall cross the borders of Moab at Ar ,
TLB	Deuteronomy	2	19	into the land of the Ammonites . But do not attack them , for I will not give you any of their land . I have given it to the descendants of Lot. ’
TLB	Deuteronomy	2	20	“ ( That area , too , used to be inhabited by the Rephaim , called ‘ Zamzummim ’ by the Ammonites .
TLB	Deuteronomy	2	21	They were a large and powerful tribe , as tall as the Anakim ; but Jehovah destroyed them as the Ammonites came in , and the Ammonites lived there in their place .
TLB	Deuteronomy	2	22	The Lord had similarly helped the descendants of Esau at Mount Seir , for he destroyed the Horites who were living there before them .
TLB	Deuteronomy	2	23	Another similar situation occurred when the people of Caphtor invaded and destroyed the tribe of Avvim living in villages scattered across the countryside as far away as Gaza . )
TLB	Deuteronomy	2	24	“ Then the Lord said , ‘ Cross the Arnon River into the land of King Sihon the Amorite , king of Heshbon . War against him and begin to take possession of his land .
TLB	Deuteronomy	2	25	Beginning today I will make people throughout the whole earth tremble with fear because of you , and dread your arrival. ’
TLB	Deuteronomy	2	26	“ Then from the wilderness of Kedemoth I sent ambassadors to King Sihon of Heshbon with a proposal of peace .
TLB	Deuteronomy	2	27	‘ Let us pass through your land , ’ we said . ‘ We will stay on the main road and won ’ t turn off into the fields on either side .
TLB	Deuteronomy	2	28	We will not steal food as we go , but will purchase every bite we eat and everything we drink ; all we want is permission to pass through .
TLB	Deuteronomy	2	29	The Edomites at Seir allowed us to go through their country , and so did the Moabites , whose capital is at Ar . We are on our way across the Jordan into the land the Lord our God has given us. ’
TLB	Deuteronomy	2	30	“ But King Sihon refused because Jehovah your God made him obstinate , so that he could destroy Sihon by the hands of Israel , as has now been done .
TLB	Deuteronomy	2	31	“ Then the Lord said to me , ‘ I have begun to give you the land of King Sihon ; when you possess it , it shall belong to Israel forever. ’
TLB	Deuteronomy	2	32	“ King Sihon then declared war on us and mobilized his forces at Jahaz . 33-34 But the Lord our God crushed him , and we conquered all his cities and utterly destroyed everything , including the women and babies . We left nothing alive 35-36 except the cattle , which we took as our reward , along with the booty gained from ransacking the cities we had taken . We conquered everything from Aroer to Gilead—from the edge of the Arnon River Valley , and including all the cities in the valley . Not one city was too strong for us , for the Lord our God gave all of them to us .
TLB	Deuteronomy	2	37	However , we stayed away from the people of Ammon and from the Jabbok River and the hill country cities , the places Jehovah our God had forbidden us to enter . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Deuteronomy	3	3	So the Lord helped us fight against King Og and his people , and we killed them all .
TLB	Deuteronomy	3	4	We conquered all sixty of his cities , the entire Argob region of Bashan .
TLB	Deuteronomy	3	5	These were well-fortified cities with high walls and barred gates . Of course we also took all of the unwalled towns .
TLB	Deuteronomy	3	6	We utterly destroyed the kingdom of Bashan just as we had destroyed King Sihon ’ s kingdom at Heshbon , killing the entire population—men , women , and children alike .
TLB	Deuteronomy	3	7	But we kept the cattle and loot for ourselves .
TLB	Deuteronomy	3	8	“ We now possessed all the land of the two kings of the Amorites east of the Jordan River—all the land from the valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon .
TLB	Deuteronomy	3	9	( The Sidonians called Mount Hermon ‘ Sirion , ’ while the Amorites called it ‘ Senir. ’ )
TLB	Deuteronomy	3	10	We had now conquered all the cities on the plateau , and all of Gilead and Bashan as far as the cities of Salecah and Edrei .
TLB	Deuteronomy	3	11	“ Incidentally , King Og of Bashan was the last of the giant Rephaim . His iron bedstead is kept in a museum at Rabbah , one of the cities of the Ammonites , and measures thirteen and a half feet long by six feet wide .
TLB	Deuteronomy	3	12	“ At that time I gave the conquered land to the tribes of Reuben , Gad , and the half-tribe of Manasseh . To the tribes of Reuben and Gad I gave the area beginning at Aroer on the Arnon River , plus half of Mount Gilead , including its cities .
TLB	Deuteronomy	3	13	The half-tribe of Manasseh received the remainder of Gilead and all of the former kingdom of King Og , the Argob region . ( Bashan is sometimes called ‘ The Land of the Rephaim. ’ )
TLB	Deuteronomy	3	14	The clan of Jair , of the tribe of Manasseh , took over the whole Argob region ( Bashan ) to the borders of the Geshurites and Maacathites . They renamed their country after themselves , calling it Havvoth-jair ( meaning ‘ Jair ’ s Villages ’ ) as it is still known today .
TLB	Deuteronomy	3	15	Then I gave Gilead to the clan of Machir .
TLB	Deuteronomy	3	16	The tribes of Reuben and Gad received the area extending from the Jabbok River in Gilead ( which was the Ammonite frontier ) to the middle of the valley of the Arnon River .
TLB	Deuteronomy	3	17	They also received the Arabah ( or wasteland ) , bounded by the Jordan River on the west , from Chinnereth to Mount Pisgah and the Dead Sea ( also called the Sea of the Arabah ) .
TLB	Deuteronomy	3	18	“ At that time I reminded the tribes of Reuben and Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh that , although the Lord had given them the land , they could not begin settling down until their armed men led the other tribes across the Jordan to the land the Lord was giving them .
TLB	Deuteronomy	3	19	“ ‘ But your wives and children , ’ I told them , ‘ may live here in the cities the Lord has given you , caring for your many cattle
TLB	Deuteronomy	3	20	until you return after the Lord has given victory to the other tribes too . When they conquer the land the Lord your God has given them across the Jordan River , then you may return here to your own land. ’
TLB	Deuteronomy	3	21	“ Then I said to Joshua , ‘ You have seen what the Lord your God has done to those two kings . You will do the same to all the kingdoms on the other side of the Jordan .
TLB	Deuteronomy	3	22	Don ’ t be afraid of the nations there , for the Lord your God will fight for you. ’ 23-25 “ At that time I made this plea to God : ‘ O Lord God , please let me cross over into the Promised Land—the good land beyond the Jordan River with its rolling hills—and Lebanon . I want to see the result of all the greatness and power you have been showing us ; for what God in all of heaven or earth can do what you have done for us ? ’
TLB	Deuteronomy	3	26	“ But the Lord was angry with me because of you and would not let me cross over . ‘ Speak of it no more , ’ he ordered ,
TLB	Deuteronomy	3	27	‘ but go to the top of Mount Pisgah where you can look out in every direction , and there you will see the land in the distance . But you shall not cross the Jordan River .
TLB	Deuteronomy	3	28	Commission Joshua to replace you , and then encourage him , for he shall lead the people across to conquer the land you will see from the mountaintop. ’
TLB	Deuteronomy	3	29	“ So we remained in the valley near Beth-peor . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Deuteronomy	4	4	But all of you who were faithful to the Lord your God are still alive today .
TLB	Deuteronomy	4	2	Do not add other laws or subtract from these ; just obey them , for they are from the Lord your God .
TLB	Deuteronomy	4	3	You have seen what the Lord did to you at Baalpeor , where he destroyed many people for worshiping idols .
TLB	Deuteronomy	4	5	“ These are the laws for you to obey when you arrive in the land where you will live . They are from the Lord our God . He has given them to me to pass on to you .
TLB	Deuteronomy	4	6	If you obey them , they will give you a reputation for wisdom and intelligence . When the surrounding nations hear these laws , they will exclaim , ‘ What other nation is as wise and prudent as Israel ! ’
TLB	Deuteronomy	4	7	For what other nation , great or small , has God among them , as the Lord our God is here among us whenever we call upon him ?
TLB	Deuteronomy	4	8	And what nation , no matter how great , has laws as fair as these I am giving you today ?
TLB	Deuteronomy	4	9	“ But watch out ! Be very careful never to forget what you have seen God doing for you . May his miracles have a deep and permanent effect upon your lives ! Tell your children and your grandchildren about the glorious miracles he did .
TLB	Deuteronomy	4	10	Tell them especially about the day you stood before the Lord at Mount Horeb , and he told me , ‘ Summon the people before me and I will instruct them , so that they will learn always to reverence me , and so that they can teach my laws to their children. ’
TLB	Deuteronomy	4	11	You stood at the foot of the mountain , and the mountain burned with fire ; flames shot far into the sky , surrounded by black clouds and deep darkness .
TLB	Deuteronomy	4	12	And the Lord spoke to you from the fire ; you heard his words but didn ’ t see him .
TLB	Deuteronomy	4	13	He proclaimed the laws you must obey—the Ten Commandments—and wrote them on two stone tablets .
TLB	Deuteronomy	4	14	Yes , it was at that time that the Lord commanded me to issue the laws you must obey when you arrive in the Promised Land .
TLB	Deuteronomy	4	15	“ But beware ! You didn ’ t see the form of God that day as he spoke to you from the fire at Mount Horeb , 16-17 so do not defile yourselves by trying to make a statue of God—an idol in any form , whether of a man , woman , animal , bird ,
TLB	Deuteronomy	4	18	a small animal that runs along the ground , or a fish .
TLB	Deuteronomy	4	19	And do not look up into the sky to worship the sun , moon , or stars . The Lord may permit other nations to get away with this , but not you .
TLB	Deuteronomy	4	20	The Lord has rescued you from prison—Egypt—to be his special people , his own inheritance ; this is what you are today . 21-22 But he was angry with me because of you ; he vowed that I could not go over the Jordan River into the good land he has given you as your inheritance . I must die here on this side of the river .
TLB	Deuteronomy	4	23	Beware lest you break the contract the Lord your God has made with you ! You will break it if you make any idols , for the Lord your God has utterly forbidden this .
TLB	Deuteronomy	4	24	He is a devouring fire , a jealous God .
TLB	Deuteronomy	4	25	“ In the future , when your children and grandchildren are born and you have been in the land a long time , and you have defiled yourselves by making idols , and the Lord your God is very angry because of your sin ,
TLB	Deuteronomy	4	26	heaven and earth are witnesses that you shall be quickly destroyed from the land . Soon now you will cross the Jordan River and conquer that land . But your days there will be brief ; you will then be utterly destroyed .
TLB	Deuteronomy	4	27	For the Lord will scatter you among the nations , and you will be but few in number .
TLB	Deuteronomy	4	28	There , far away , you will worship idols made from wood and stone , idols that neither see nor hear nor eat nor smell .
TLB	Deuteronomy	4	29	“ But you will also begin to search again for Jehovah your God , and you will find him when you search for him with all your heart and soul .
TLB	Deuteronomy	4	30	When those bitter days have come upon you in the latter times , you will finally return to the Lord your God and listen to what he tells you .
TLB	Deuteronomy	4	31	For the Lord your God is merciful—he will not abandon you nor destroy you nor forget the promises he has made to your ancestors .
TLB	Deuteronomy	4	32	“ In all history , going back to the time when God created man upon the earth , search from one end of the heavens to the other to see if you can find anything like this :
TLB	Deuteronomy	4	33	An entire nation heard the voice of God speaking to it from fire , as you did , and lived !
TLB	Deuteronomy	4	34	Where else will you ever find another example of God ’ s removing a nation from its slavery by sending terrible plagues , mighty miracles , war , and terror ? Yet that is what the Lord your God did for you in Egypt , right before your very eyes .
TLB	Deuteronomy	4	35	He did these things so you would realize that Jehovah is God , and that there is no one else like him .
TLB	Deuteronomy	4	36	He let you hear his voice instructing you from heaven , and he let you see his great pillar of fire upon the earth ; you even heard his words from the center of the fire .
TLB	Deuteronomy	4	37	“ It was because he loved your ancestors and chose to bless their descendants that he personally brought you out from Egypt with a great display of power .
TLB	Deuteronomy	4	38	He drove away other nations greater by far than you and gave you their land as an inheritance , as it is today .
TLB	Deuteronomy	4	39	This is your wonderful thought for the day : Jehovah is God both in heaven and down here upon the earth ; and there is no God other than him !
TLB	Deuteronomy	4	40	You must obey these laws that I will tell you today , so that all will be well with you and your children , and so that you will live forever in the land the Lord your God is giving you. ”
TLB	Deuteronomy	4	41	Then Moses instructed the people of Israel to set apart three cities east of the Jordan River ,
TLB	Deuteronomy	4	42	where anyone who accidentally killed someone could flee for safety .
TLB	Deuteronomy	4	43	These cities were Bezer , on the plateau in the wilderness , for the tribe of Reuben ; Ramoth , in Gilead , for the tribe of Gad ; and Golan , in Bashan , for the tribe of Manasseh . 44-46 Listed below are the laws Moses issued to the people of Israel when they left Egypt , and as they were camped east of the Jordan River near the city of Beth-peor . ( This was the land formerly occupied by the Amorites under King Sihon , whose capital was Heshbon ; he and his people were destroyed by Moses and the Israelis .
TLB	Deuteronomy	4	47	Israel conquered his land and that of King Og of Bashan—they were two Amorite kings east of the Jordan .
TLB	Deuteronomy	4	48	Israel also conquered all the area from Aroer at the edge of the Arnon River Valley to Mount Sirion , or Mount Hermon , as it is sometimes called ;
TLB	Deuteronomy	4	49	and all the Arabah east of the Jordan River over to the Dead Sea , below the slopes of Mount Pisgah . ) The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Deuteronomy	5	8	“ ‘ Never make idols ; don ’ t worship images , whether of birds , animals , or fish . 9-10 You shall not bow down to any images nor worship them in any way , for I am the Lord your God . I am a jealous God , and I will bring the curse of a father ’ s sins upon even the third and fourth generation of the children of those who hate me ; but I will show kindness to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments .
TLB	Deuteronomy	5	11	“ ‘ You must never use my name to make a vow you don ’ t intend to keep . [ a ] I will not overlook that .
TLB	Deuteronomy	5	12	“ ‘ Keep the Sabbath day holy . This is my command .
TLB	Deuteronomy	5	13	Work the other six days ,
TLB	Deuteronomy	5	14	but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God ; no work shall be done that day by you or by any of your household—your sons , daughters , servants , oxen , donkeys , or cattle ; even foreigners living among you must obey this law . Everybody must rest as you do .
TLB	Deuteronomy	5	15	Why should you keep the Sabbath ? It is because you were slaves in Egypt , and the Lord your God brought you out with a great display of miracles .
TLB	Deuteronomy	5	16	“ ‘ Honor your father and mother ( remember , this is a commandment of the Lord your God ) ; if you do so , you shall have a long , prosperous life in the land he is giving you .
TLB	Deuteronomy	5	17	“ ‘ You must not murder .
TLB	Deuteronomy	5	18	“ ‘ You must not commit adultery .
TLB	Deuteronomy	5	19	“ ‘ You must not steal .
TLB	Deuteronomy	5	20	“ ‘ You must not tell lies .
TLB	Deuteronomy	5	21	“ ‘ You must not burn with desire for another man ’ s wife , nor envy him for his home , land , servants , oxen , donkeys , nor anything else he owns. ’
TLB	Deuteronomy	5	22	“ The Lord has given these laws to each one of you from the heart of the fire , surrounded by the clouds and thick darkness that engulfed Mount Sinai . Those were the only commandments he gave you at that time , [ b ] and he wrote them out on two stone tablets and gave them to me .
TLB	Deuteronomy	5	23	But when you heard the loud voice from the darkness and saw the terrible fire at the top of the mountain , all your tribal leaders came to me
TLB	Deuteronomy	5	24	and pleaded , ‘ Today the Lord our God has shown us his glory and greatness ; we have even heard his voice from the heart of the fire . Now we know that a man may speak to God and not die ;
TLB	Deuteronomy	5	25	but we will surely die if he speaks to us again . This awesome fire will consume us . 26-27 What man can hear , as we have , the voice of the living God speaking from the heart of the fire , and live ? You go and listen to all that God says , then come and tell us , and we will listen and obey. ’
TLB	Deuteronomy	5	28	“ And the Lord agreed to your request and said to me , ‘ I have heard what the people have said to you , and I agree .
TLB	Deuteronomy	5	29	Oh , that they would always have such a heart for me , wanting to obey my commandments . Then all would go well with them in the future , and with their children throughout all generations !
TLB	Deuteronomy	5	30	Go and tell them to return to their tents .
TLB	Deuteronomy	5	31	Then you come back and stand here beside me , and I will give you all my commandments , and you shall teach them to the people ; and they will obey them in the land I am giving to them. ’ ”
TLB	Deuteronomy	5	32	So Moses told the people , “ You must obey all the commandments of the Lord your God , following his directions in every detail , going the whole way he has laid out for you ;
TLB	Deuteronomy	5	33	only then will you live long and prosperous lives in the land you are to enter and possess . Footnotes - Deuteronomy 5:11 You must never use my name to make a vow you don ’ t intend to keep , literally , “ You must not utter the name of the Lord your God to misuse it. ” - Deuteronomy 5:22 Those were the only commandments he gave you at that time , literally , “ And he added no more. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Deuteronomy	6	6	And you must think constantly about these commandments I am giving you today .
TLB	Deuteronomy	6	2	The purpose of these laws is to cause you , your sons , and your grandsons to reverence the Lord your God by obeying all of his instructions as long as you live ; if you do , you will have long , prosperous years ahead of you .
TLB	Deuteronomy	6	3	Therefore , O Israel , listen closely to each command and be careful to obey it , so that all will go well with you , and so that you will have many children . If you obey these commands , you will become a great nation in a glorious land ‘ flowing with milk and honey , ’ even as the God of your fathers promised you .
TLB	Deuteronomy	6	4	“ O Israel , listen : Jehovah is our God , Jehovah alone .
TLB	Deuteronomy	6	5	You must love him with all your heart , soul , and might .
TLB	Deuteronomy	6	7	You must teach them to your children and talk about them when you are at home or out for a walk ; at bedtime and the first thing in the morning .
TLB	Deuteronomy	6	8	Tie them on your finger , wear them on your forehead ,
TLB	Deuteronomy	6	9	and write them on the doorposts of your house ! 10-12 “ When the Lord your God has brought you into the land he promised your ancestors , Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , and when he has given you great cities full of good things—cities you didn ’ t build , wells you didn ’ t dig , and vineyards and olive trees you didn ’ t plant—and when you have eaten until you can hold no more , then beware lest you forget the Lord who brought you out of the land of Egypt , the land of slavery .
TLB	Deuteronomy	6	13	When you are full , don ’ t forget to be reverent to him and to serve him and to use his name alone to endorse your promises .
TLB	Deuteronomy	6	14	“ You must not worship the gods of the neighboring nations ,
TLB	Deuteronomy	6	15	for Jehovah your God who lives among you is a jealous God , and his anger may rise quickly against you , and wipe you off the face of the earth .
TLB	Deuteronomy	6	16	You must not provoke him and try his patience as you did when you complained against him at Massah .
TLB	Deuteronomy	6	17	You must actively obey him in everything he commands .
TLB	Deuteronomy	6	18	Only then will you be doing what is right and good in the Lord ’ s eyes . If you obey him , all will go well for you , and you will be able to go in and possess the good land that the Lord promised your ancestors .
TLB	Deuteronomy	6	19	You will also be able to throw out all the enemies living in your land , as the Lord agreed to help you do .
TLB	Deuteronomy	6	20	“ In the years to come when your son asks you , ‘ What is the purpose of these laws which the Lord our God has given us ? ’
TLB	Deuteronomy	6	21	you must tell him , ‘ We were Pharaoh ’ s slaves in Egypt , and the Lord brought us out of Egypt with great power
TLB	Deuteronomy	6	22	and mighty miracles—with terrible blows against Egypt and Pharaoh and all his people . We saw it all with our own eyes .
TLB	Deuteronomy	6	23	He brought us out of Egypt so that he could give us this land he had promised to our ancestors .
TLB	Deuteronomy	6	24	And he has commanded us to obey all of these laws and to reverence him so that he can preserve us alive as he has until now .
TLB	Deuteronomy	6	25	For it always goes well with us when we obey all the laws of the Lord our God. ’ The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Deuteronomy	7	7	He didn ’ t choose you and pour out his love upon you because you were a larger nation than any other , for you were the smallest of all !
TLB	Deuteronomy	7	2	“ When the Lord your God delivers them over to you to be destroyed , do a complete job of it—don ’ t make any treaties or show them mercy ; utterly wipe them out .
TLB	Deuteronomy	7	3	Do not intermarry with them , nor let your sons and daughters marry their sons and daughters .
TLB	Deuteronomy	7	4	That would surely result in your young people ’ s beginning to worship their gods . Then the anger of the Lord would be hot against you , and he would surely destroy you .
TLB	Deuteronomy	7	5	“ You must break down the heathen altars and shatter the obelisks and cut up the shameful images and burn the idols .
TLB	Deuteronomy	7	6	“ For you are a holy people , dedicated to the Lord your God . He has chosen you from all the people on the face of the whole earth to be his own chosen ones .
TLB	Deuteronomy	7	8	It was just because he loves you , and because he kept his promise to your ancestors . That is why he brought you out of slavery in Egypt with such amazing power and mighty miracles .
TLB	Deuteronomy	7	9	“ Understand , therefore , that the Lord your God is the faithful God who for a thousand generations keeps his promises and constantly loves those who love him and who obey his commands .
TLB	Deuteronomy	7	10	But those who hate him shall be punished publicly and destroyed . He will deal with them personally .
TLB	Deuteronomy	7	11	Therefore , obey all these commandments I am giving you today .
TLB	Deuteronomy	7	12	Because of your obedience , the Lord your God will keep his part of the contract which , in his tender love , he made with your fathers .
TLB	Deuteronomy	7	13	And he will love you and bless you and make you into a great nation . He will make you fertile and give fertility to your ground and to your animals , so that you will have large crops of grain , grapes , and olives , and great flocks of cattle , sheep , and goats when you arrive in the land he promised your fathers to give you .
TLB	Deuteronomy	7	14	You will be blessed above all the nations of the earth ; not one of you , whether male or female , shall be barren , not even your cattle .
TLB	Deuteronomy	7	15	And the Lord will take away all your sickness and will not let you suffer any of the diseases of Egypt you remember so well ; he will give them all to your enemies !
TLB	Deuteronomy	7	16	“ You must destroy all the nations the Lord your God delivers into your hands . Have no pity , and do not worship their gods ; if you do , it will be a sad day for you .
TLB	Deuteronomy	7	17	Perhaps you will think to yourself , ‘ How can we ever conquer these nations that are so much more powerful than we are ? ’
TLB	Deuteronomy	7	18	But don ’ t be afraid of them ! Just remember what the Lord your God did to Pharaoh and to all the land of Egypt .
TLB	Deuteronomy	7	19	Do you remember the terrors the Lord sent upon them—your parents saw it with their own eyes—and the mighty miracles and wonders , and the power and strength of Almighty God that he used to bring you out of Egypt ? Well , the Lord your God will use this same might against the people you fear .
TLB	Deuteronomy	7	20	Moreover , the Lord your God will send hornets to drive out those who hide from you !
TLB	Deuteronomy	7	21	“ No , do not be afraid of those nations , for the Lord your God is among you , and he is a great and awesome God .
TLB	Deuteronomy	7	22	He will cast them out a little at a time ; he will not do it all at once , for if he did , the wild animals would multiply too quickly and become dangerous .
TLB	Deuteronomy	7	23	He will do it gradually , and you will move in against those nations and destroy them .
TLB	Deuteronomy	7	24	He will deliver their kings into your hands , and you will erase their names from the face of the earth . No one will be able to stand against you .
TLB	Deuteronomy	7	25	“ Burn their idols and do not touch the silver or gold they are made of . Do not take it or it will be a snare to you , for it is horrible to the Lord your God .
TLB	Deuteronomy	7	26	Do not bring an idol into your home and worship it , for then your doom is sealed . Utterly detest it , for it is a cursed thing . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Deuteronomy	8	8	it is a land of wheat and barley , of grapevines , fig trees , pomegranates , olives , and honey ;
TLB	Deuteronomy	8	2	Do you remember how the Lord led you through the wilderness for all those forty years , humbling you and testing you to find out how you would respond , and whether or not you would really obey him ?
TLB	Deuteronomy	8	3	Yes , he humbled you by letting you go hungry and then feeding you with manna , a food previously unknown to both you and your ancestors . He did it to help you realize that food isn ’ t everything , and that real life comes by obeying every command of God .
TLB	Deuteronomy	8	4	For all these forty years your clothes haven ’ t grown old , and your feet haven ’ t been blistered or swollen .
TLB	Deuteronomy	8	5	So you should realize that , as a man punishes his son , the Lord punishes you to help you .
TLB	Deuteronomy	8	6	“ Obey the laws of the Lord your God . Walk in his ways and fear him .
TLB	Deuteronomy	8	7	For the Lord your God is bringing you into a good land of brooks , pools , gushing springs , valleys , and hills ;
TLB	Deuteronomy	8	9	it is a land where food is plentiful , and nothing is lacking ; it is a land where iron is as common as stone , and copper is abundant in the hills .
TLB	Deuteronomy	8	10	When you have eaten your fill , bless the Lord your God for the good land he has given you .
TLB	Deuteronomy	8	11	“ But that is the time to be careful ! Beware that in your plenty [ a ] you don ’ t forget the Lord your God and begin to disobey him . 12-13 For when you have become full and prosperous and have built fine homes to live in , and when your flocks and herds have become very large , and your silver and gold have multiplied ,
TLB	Deuteronomy	8	14	that is the time to watch out that you don ’ t become proud and forget the Lord your God who brought you out of your slavery in the land of Egypt .
TLB	Deuteronomy	8	15	Beware that you don ’ t forget the God who led you through the great and terrible wilderness with the dangerous snakes and scorpions , where it was so hot and dry . He gave you water from the rock !
TLB	Deuteronomy	8	16	He fed you with manna in the wilderness ( it was a kind of bread unknown before ) so that you would become humble and so that your trust in him would grow , and he could do you good .
TLB	Deuteronomy	8	17	He did it so that you would never feel that it was your own power and might that made you wealthy .
TLB	Deuteronomy	8	18	Always remember that it is the Lord your God who gives you power to become rich , and he does it to fulfill his promise to your ancestors .
TLB	Deuteronomy	8	19	“ But if you forget about the Lord your God and worship other gods instead , and follow evil ways , you shall certainly perish ,

TLB	Deuteronomy	9	9	I was on the mountain at the time , receiving the contract which Jehovah had made with you—the stone tablets with the laws inscribed upon them . I was there for forty days and forty nights , and all that time I ate nothing . I didn ’ t even take a drink of water . 10-11 At the end of those forty days and nights the Lord gave me the contract , the tablets on which he had written the commandments he had spoken from the fire-covered mountain while the people had watched below .
TLB	Deuteronomy	9	3	But the Lord your God will go before you as a devouring fire to destroy them , so that you will quickly conquer them and drive them out .
TLB	Deuteronomy	9	4	“ Then , when the Lord has done this for you , don ’ t say to yourselves , ‘ The Lord has helped us because we are so good ! ’ No , it is because of the wickedness of the other nations that he is doing it .
TLB	Deuteronomy	9	5	It is not at all because you are such fine , upright people that the Lord will drive them out from before you ! I say it again , it is only because of the wickedness of the other nations , and because of his promises to your ancestors , Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , that he will do it .
TLB	Deuteronomy	9	6	I say it yet again : Jehovah your God is not giving you this good land because you are good , for you are not—you are a wicked , stubborn people .
TLB	Deuteronomy	9	7	“ Don ’ t you remember ( oh , never forget it ! ) how continually angry you made the Lord your God out in the wilderness , from the day you left Egypt until now ? For all this time you have constantly rebelled against him .
TLB	Deuteronomy	9	8	“ Don ’ t you remember how angry you made him at Mount Horeb ? He was ready to destroy you .
TLB	Deuteronomy	9	12	He told me to go down quickly because the people I had led out of Egypt had defiled themselves , quickly turning away from the laws of God , and had made an idol from molten metal . 13-14 “ ‘ Let me alone that I may destroy this evil , stubborn people ! ’ the Lord told me , ‘ and I will blot out their name from under heaven , and I will make a mighty nation of you , mightier and greater than they are. ’
TLB	Deuteronomy	9	15	“ I came down from the burning mountain , holding in my hands the two tablets inscribed with the laws of God .
TLB	Deuteronomy	9	16	There below me I could see the calf you had made in your terrible sin against the Lord your God . How quickly you turned away from him !
TLB	Deuteronomy	9	17	I lifted the tablets high above my head and dashed them to the ground ! I smashed them before your eyes !
TLB	Deuteronomy	9	18	Then , for another forty days and nights I lay before the Lord , neither eating bread nor drinking water , for you had done what the Lord hated most , thus provoking him to great anger .
TLB	Deuteronomy	9	19	How I feared for you—for the Lord was ready to destroy you . But that time , too , he listened to me .
TLB	Deuteronomy	9	20	Aaron was in great danger because the Lord was so angry with him ; but I prayed , and the Lord spared him .
TLB	Deuteronomy	9	21	I took your sin—the calf you had made—and burned it and ground it into fine dust , and threw it into the stream that cascaded out of the mountain .
TLB	Deuteronomy	9	22	“ Again at Taberah and once again at Massah you angered the Lord , and yet again at Kibroth-hattaavah .
TLB	Deuteronomy	9	23	At Kadesh-barnea , when the Lord told you to enter the land he had given you , you rebelled and wouldn ’ t believe that he would help you ; you refused to obey him .
TLB	Deuteronomy	9	24	Yes , you have been rebellious against the Lord from the first day I knew you .
TLB	Deuteronomy	9	25	That is why I fell down before him for forty days and nights when the Lord was ready to destroy you .
TLB	Deuteronomy	9	26	“ I prayed to him , ‘ O Lord God , don ’ t destroy your own people . They are your inheritance saved from Egypt by your mighty power and glorious strength .
TLB	Deuteronomy	9	27	Don ’ t notice the rebellion and stubbornness of these people , but remember instead your promises to your servants Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob . Oh , please overlook the awful wickedness and sin of these people .
TLB	Deuteronomy	9	28	For if you destroy them , the Egyptians will say , “ It is because the Lord wasn ’ t able to bring them to the land he promised them , ” or “ He destroyed them because he hated them : he brought them into the wilderness to slay them. ”
TLB	Deuteronomy	9	29	They are your people and your inheritance that you brought from Egypt by your great power and your mighty arm. ’ The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Deuteronomy	10	10	“ As I said before , I stayed on the mountain before the Lord for forty days and nights the second time , just as I had the first , and the Lord again yielded to my pleas and didn ’ t destroy you .
TLB	Deuteronomy	10	2	He said he would rewrite on the tablets the same commandments that were on the tablets I had smashed , and that I should place them in the Ark .
TLB	Deuteronomy	10	3	So I made an Ark of acacia wood and hewed out two stone tablets like the first two , and took the tablets up on the mountain to God .
TLB	Deuteronomy	10	4	He again wrote the Ten Commandments on them and gave them to me . ( They were the same commandments he had given you from the heart of the fire on the mountain as you all watched below . )
TLB	Deuteronomy	10	5	Then I came down and placed the tablets in the Ark I had made , where they are to this day , just as the Lord commanded me .
TLB	Deuteronomy	10	6	“ The people of Israel then journeyed from Beeroth of Bene-jaakan to Moserah , where Aaron died and was buried . His son Eleazar became the next priest .
TLB	Deuteronomy	10	7	“ Then they journeyed to Gudgodah , and from there to Jotbathah , a land of brooks and water .
TLB	Deuteronomy	10	8	It was there that Jehovah set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the Ark containing the Ten Commandments of Jehovah , and to stand before the Lord and to do his work and to bless his name , just as is done today .
TLB	Deuteronomy	10	9	( That is why the tribe of Levi does not have a portion of land reserved for it in the Promised Land , as their brother tribes do ; for as the Lord told them , he himself is their inheritance . )
TLB	Deuteronomy	10	11	“ But he said to me , ‘ Arise and lead the people to the land I promised their fathers . It is time to go in and possess it. ’ 12-13 “ And now , Israel , what does the Lord your God require of you except to listen carefully to all he says to you , and to obey for your own good the commandments I am giving you today , and to love him , and to worship him with all your hearts and souls ?
TLB	Deuteronomy	10	14	Earth and highest heaven belong to the Lord your God .
TLB	Deuteronomy	10	15	And yet he rejoiced in your fathers and loved them so much that he chose you , their children , to be above every other nation , as is evident today .

TLB	Deuteronomy	11	2	Listen ! I am not talking now to your children who have never experienced the Lord ’ s punishments or seen his greatness and his awesome power .
TLB	Deuteronomy	11	3	They weren ’ t there to see the miracles he did in Egypt against Pharaoh and all his land .
TLB	Deuteronomy	11	4	They didn ’ t see what God did to the armies of Egypt and to their horses and chariots—how he drowned them in the Red Sea as they were chasing you , and how the Lord has kept them powerless against you until this very day !
TLB	Deuteronomy	11	5	They didn ’ t see how the Lord cared for you time and again through all the years you were wandering in the wilderness , until your arrival here .

TLB	Deuteronomy	11	17	For if you do , the anger of the Lord will be hot against you , and he will shut the heavens—there will be no rain and no harvest , and you will quickly perish from the good land the Lord has given you .

TLB	Deuteronomy	12	9	( for these laws don ’ t go into effect until you arrive in the place of rest the Lord will give to you ) .
TLB	Deuteronomy	12	10	But when you cross the Jordan River and live in the Promised Land , and the Lord gives you rest and keeps you safe from all your enemies ,
TLB	Deuteronomy	12	11	then you must bring all your burnt sacrifices and other offerings to his sanctuary , the place he will choose as his home .
TLB	Deuteronomy	12	13	“ You are not to sacrifice your burnt offerings just anywhere ;
TLB	Deuteronomy	12	14	you may only do so in the place the Lord will choose . He will pick a place in the territory allotted to one of the tribes . Only there may you offer your sacrifices and bring your offerings .
TLB	Deuteronomy	12	15	However , the meat you eat may be butchered anywhere , just as you do now with gazelle and deer . Eat as much of this meat as you wish and as often as you are able to obtain it , because the Lord has prospered you . Those who are ceremonially defiled may eat it too .
TLB	Deuteronomy	12	16	The only restriction is that you are not to eat the blood—pour it out on the ground , like water .
TLB	Deuteronomy	12	17	“ But none of the offerings may be eaten at home . Neither the tithe of your grain and new wine and olive oil , nor the firstborn of your flocks and herds , nor anything you have vowed to give the Lord , nor your freewill offerings , nor the offerings to be presented to the Lord by waving them before his altar .
TLB	Deuteronomy	12	18	All these must be brought to the central altar where you , your children , and the Levites shall eat them before the Lord your God . He will tell you where this altar must be located . Rejoice before the Lord your God in everything you do .
TLB	Deuteronomy	12	19	( By the way , be very careful not to forget about the Levites . Share with them . ) 20-23 “ If , when the Lord enlarges your borders , the central altar is too far away from you , then your flocks and herds may be butchered on your own farms , just as you do now with gazelle and deer . And even persons who are ceremonially defiled may eat them . The only restriction is never to eat the blood , for the blood is the life , and you shall not eat the life with the meat . 24-25 Instead , pour the blood out upon the earth . If you do , all will be well with you and your children . 26-27 Only your gifts to the Lord , and the offerings you have promised in your vows , and your burnt offerings need be taken to the central altar . These may only be sacrificed upon the altar of the Lord your God . The blood will be poured out upon the altar , and you will eat the meat .
TLB	Deuteronomy	12	28	“ Be careful to obey all of these commandments . If you do what is right in the eyes of the Lord your God , all will go well with you and your children forever .
TLB	Deuteronomy	12	29	When he destroys the nations in the land where you will live ,
TLB	Deuteronomy	12	30	don ’ t follow their example in worshiping their gods . Do not ask , ‘ How do these nations worship their gods ? ’ and then go and worship as they do !
TLB	Deuteronomy	12	31	You must not insult the Lord your God like that ! These nations have done horrible things that he hates , all in the name of their religion . They have even roasted their sons and daughters in front of their gods .
TLB	Deuteronomy	12	32	Obey all the commandments I give you . Do not add to or subtract from them . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Deuteronomy	13	13	“ If there is a prophet among you , or one who claims to foretell the future by dreams ,
TLB	Deuteronomy	13	2	and if his predictions come true but he says , ‘ Come , let us worship the gods of the other nations , ’
TLB	Deuteronomy	13	3	don ’ t listen to him . For the Lord is testing you to find out whether or not you really love him with all your heart and soul .
TLB	Deuteronomy	13	4	You must never worship any God but Jehovah ; obey only his commands and cling to him .
TLB	Deuteronomy	13	5	“ The prophet who tries to lead you astray must be executed , for he has attempted to foment rebellion against the Lord your God who brought you out of slavery in the land of Egypt . By executing him you will clear out the evil from among you . 6-7 “ If your nearest relative or closest friend , even a brother , son , daughter , or beloved wife whispers to you to come and worship these foreign gods ,
TLB	Deuteronomy	13	8	do not consent or listen , and have no pity : Do not spare that person from the penalty ; don ’ t conceal his horrible suggestion .
TLB	Deuteronomy	13	9	Execute him ! Your own hand shall be the first upon him to put him to death , then the hands of all the people .
TLB	Deuteronomy	13	10	Stone him to death because he has tried to draw you away from the Lord your God who brought you from the land of Egypt , the place of slavery .
TLB	Deuteronomy	13	11	Then all Israel will hear about his evil deed and will fear such wickedness as this among you . 12-14 “ If you ever hear it said about one of the cities of Israel that some worthless rabble have led their fellow citizens astray with the suggestion that they worship foreign gods , first check the facts to see if the rumor is true . If you find that it is , that it is certain that such a horrible thing is happening among you in one of the cities the Lord has given you ,
TLB	Deuteronomy	13	15	you must without fail declare war against that city and utterly destroy all of its inhabitants , and even all of the cattle .
TLB	Deuteronomy	13	16	Afterwards you must pile all the booty into the middle of the street and burn it , then put the entire city to the torch , as a burnt offering to Jehovah your God . That city shall forever remain a lifeless mound and may never be rebuilt .
TLB	Deuteronomy	13	17	Keep none of the booty ! Then the Lord will turn from his fierce anger and be merciful to you , and have compassion upon you , and make you a great nation just as he promised your ancestors .
TLB	Deuteronomy	13	18	“ Of course , the Lord your God will be merciful only if you have been obedient to him and to his commandments that I am giving you today , and if you have been doing that which is right in the eyes of the Lord . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Deuteronomy	14	2	You belong exclusively to the Lord your God , and he has chosen you to be his own possession , more so than any other nation on the face of the earth . 3-5 “ You are not to eat any animal I have declared to be ceremonially defiled . These are the animals you may eat : the ox , the sheep , the goat , the deer , the gazelle , the roebuck , the wild goat , the ibex , the antelope , and the mountain sheep .
TLB	Deuteronomy	14	6	“ Any animal that has cloven hooves and chews the cud may be eaten ,
TLB	Deuteronomy	14	7	but if the animal doesn ’ t have both , it may not be eaten . So you may not eat the camel , the hare , or the coney . They chew the cud but do not have cloven hooves .
TLB	Deuteronomy	14	8	Pigs may not be eaten because , although they have cloven hooves , they don ’ t chew the cud . You may not even touch the dead bodies of such animals .
TLB	Deuteronomy	14	9	“ Only sea animals with fins and scales may be eaten ;
TLB	Deuteronomy	14	10	all other kinds are ceremonially defiled . 11-18 “ You may eat any bird except the following : the eagle , the vulture , the osprey , the buzzard , the falcon ( any variety ) , the raven ( any variety ) , the ostrich , the nighthawk , the sea gull , the hawk ( any variety ) , the screech owl , the great owl , the horned owl , the pelican , the vulture , the cormorant , the stork , the heron ( any variety ) , the hoopoe , the bat . 19-20 “ With certain exceptions , [ b ] insects are a defilement to you and may not be eaten .
TLB	Deuteronomy	14	21	“ Don ’ t eat anything that has died a natural death . However , a foreigner among you may eat it . You may give it or sell it to him , but don ’ t eat it yourself , for you are holy to the Lord your God . “ You must not boil a young goat in its mother ’ s milk .
TLB	Deuteronomy	14	22	“ You must tithe all of your crops every year .
TLB	Deuteronomy	14	23	Bring this tithe to eat before the Lord your God at the place he shall choose as his sanctuary ; this applies to your tithes of grain , new wine , olive oil , and the firstborn of your flocks and herds . The purpose of tithing is to teach you always to put God first in your lives .
TLB	Deuteronomy	14	24	If the place the Lord chooses for his sanctuary is so far away that it isn ’ t convenient to carry your tithes to that place ,
TLB	Deuteronomy	14	25	then you may sell the tithe portion of your crops and herds and take the money to the Lord ’ s sanctuary .
TLB	Deuteronomy	14	26	When you arrive , use the money to buy an ox , a sheep , some wine , or beer , to feast there before the Lord your God , and to rejoice with your household .
TLB	Deuteronomy	14	27	“ Don ’ t forget to share your income with the Levites in your community , for they have no property or crops as you do .
TLB	Deuteronomy	14	28	“ Every third year you are to use your entire tithe for local welfare programs :
TLB	Deuteronomy	14	29	Give it to the Levites who have no inheritance among you , or to foreigners , or to widows and orphans within your city , so that they can eat and be satisfied ; and then Jehovah your God will bless you and your work .

TLB	Deuteronomy	15	15	Remember that you were slaves in the land of Egypt and the Lord your God rescued you ! That is why I am giving you this command .
TLB	Deuteronomy	15	2	Every creditor shall write ‘ Paid in full ’ on any promissory note he holds against a fellow Israelite , for the Lord has released everyone from his obligation .
TLB	Deuteronomy	15	3	( This release does not apply to foreigners . ) 4-5 No one will become poor because of this , for the Lord will greatly bless you in the land he is giving you if you obey this command . The only prerequisite for his blessing is that you carefully heed all the commands of the Lord your God that I am giving you today .
TLB	Deuteronomy	15	6	He will bless you as he has promised . You shall lend money to many nations but will never need to borrow ! You shall rule many nations , but they shall not rule over you !
TLB	Deuteronomy	15	7	“ But if , when you arrive in the land the Lord will give you , there are any among you who are poor , you must not shut your heart or hand against them ;
TLB	Deuteronomy	15	8	you must lend them as much as they need .
TLB	Deuteronomy	15	9	Beware ! Don ’ t refuse a loan because the year of debt cancellation is close at hand ! If you refuse to make the loan and the needy man cries out to the Lord , it will be counted against you as a sin .
TLB	Deuteronomy	15	10	You must lend him what he needs , and don ’ t moan about it either ! For the Lord will prosper you in everything you do because of this !
TLB	Deuteronomy	15	11	There will always be some among you who are poor ; that is why this commandment is necessary . You must lend to them liberally .
TLB	Deuteronomy	15	12	“ If you buy a Hebrew slave , whether a man or woman , you must free him at the end of the sixth year you have owned him ,
TLB	Deuteronomy	15	13	and don ’ t send him away empty-handed !
TLB	Deuteronomy	15	14	Give him a large farewell present from your flock , your olive press , and your winepress . Share with him in proportion as the Lord your God has blessed you .
TLB	Deuteronomy	15	16	“ But if your Hebrew slave doesn ’ t want to leave—if he says he loves you and enjoys your pleasant home and gets along well with you—
TLB	Deuteronomy	15	17	then take an awl and pierce his ear into the door , and after that he shall be your slave forever . Do the same with your women slaves .
TLB	Deuteronomy	15	18	But when you free a slave you must not feel bad , for remember that for six years he has cost you less than half the price of a hired hand ! And the Lord your God will prosper all you do because you have released him !
TLB	Deuteronomy	15	19	“ You shall set aside for God all the firstborn males from your flocks and herds . Do not use the firstborn of your herds to work your fields , and do not shear the firstborn of your flocks of sheep and goats .
TLB	Deuteronomy	15	20	Instead , you and your family shall eat these animals before the Lord your God each year at his sanctuary .
TLB	Deuteronomy	15	21	However , if this firstborn animal has any defect such as being lame or blind , or if anything else is wrong with it , you shall not sacrifice it .
TLB	Deuteronomy	15	22	Instead , use it for food for your family at home . Anyone , even if ceremonially defiled at the time , may eat it , just as anyone may eat a gazelle or deer .

TLB	Deuteronomy	16	2	Your Passover sacrifice shall be either a lamb or an ox , sacrificed to the Lord your God at his sanctuary .
TLB	Deuteronomy	16	3	Eat the sacrifice with unleavened bread . Eat unleavened bread for seven days as a reminder of the bread you ate as you escaped from Egypt . This is to remind you that you left Egypt in such a hurry that there was no time for the bread to rise . [ b ] Remember that day all the rest of your lives !
TLB	Deuteronomy	16	4	For seven days no trace of yeast shall be in your homes , and none of the Passover lamb shall be left until the next morning .
TLB	Deuteronomy	16	5	“ The Passover is not to be eaten in your homes .
TLB	Deuteronomy	16	6	It must be eaten at the place the Lord shall choose as his sanctuary . Sacrifice it there on the anniversary evening just as the sun goes down .
TLB	Deuteronomy	16	7	Roast the lamb and eat it , then start back to your homes the next morning .
TLB	Deuteronomy	16	8	For the following six days you shall eat no bread made with yeast . On the seventh day there shall be a quiet gathering of the people of each city before the Lord your God . Don ’ t do any work that day .
TLB	Deuteronomy	16	9	“ Seven weeks after the harvest begins ,
TLB	Deuteronomy	16	10	there shall be another festival before the Lord your God called the Festival of Weeks . At that time bring to him a freewill offering proportionate in size to his blessing upon you as judged by the amount of your harvest .
TLB	Deuteronomy	16	11	It is a time to rejoice before the Lord with your family and household . And don ’ t forget to include the local Levites , foreigners , widows , and orphans . Invite them to accompany you to the celebration at the sanctuary .
TLB	Deuteronomy	16	12	Remember ! You were a slave in Egypt , so be sure to carry out this command .
TLB	Deuteronomy	16	13	“ Another celebration , the Festival of Shelters , must be observed for seven days at the end of the harvest season , after the grain is threshed and the grapes have been pressed .
TLB	Deuteronomy	16	14	This will be a happy time of rejoicing together with your family and servants . And don ’ t forget to include the Levites , foreigners , orphans , and widows of your town .
TLB	Deuteronomy	16	15	“ This feast will be held at the sanctuary , which will be located at the place the Lord will designate . It is a time of deep thanksgiving to the Lord for blessing you with a good harvest and in so many other ways ; it shall be a time of great joy .
TLB	Deuteronomy	16	17	Give as you are able , according as the Lord has blessed you .
TLB	Deuteronomy	16	18	“ Appoint judges and administrative officials for all the cities the Lord your God is giving you . They will administer justice in every part of the land .
TLB	Deuteronomy	16	19	Never twist justice to benefit a rich man , and never accept bribes . For bribes blind the eyes of the wisest and corrupt their decisions .
TLB	Deuteronomy	16	20	Justice must prevail . “ That is the only way you will be successful in the land that the Lord your God is giving you .
TLB	Deuteronomy	16	21	“ Never , under any circumstances , are you to erect shameful images beside the altar of the Lord your God .

TLB	Deuteronomy	17	4	first check the rumor very carefully ; if there is no doubt it is true ,
TLB	Deuteronomy	17	5	then that man or woman shall be taken outside the city and shall be stoned to death .
TLB	Deuteronomy	17	6	However , never put a man to death on the testimony of only one witness ; there must be at least two or three .
TLB	Deuteronomy	17	7	The witnesses shall throw the first stones , and then all the people shall join in . In this way you will purge all evil from among you .
TLB	Deuteronomy	17	8	“ If a case arises that is too hard for you to decide—for instance , whether someone is guilty of murder when there is insufficient evidence , or whether someone ’ s rights have been violated—you shall take the case to the sanctuary of the Lord your God ,
TLB	Deuteronomy	17	9	to the priests and Levites , and the chief judge on duty at the time will make the decision .
TLB	Deuteronomy	17	10	His decision is without appeal and is to be followed to the letter .
TLB	Deuteronomy	17	11	The sentence he imposes is to be fully executed .
TLB	Deuteronomy	17	12	If the defendant refuses to accept the decision of the priest or judge appointed by God for this purpose , the penalty is death . Such sinners must be purged from Israel .
TLB	Deuteronomy	17	13	Then everyone will hear about what happened to the man who refused God ’ s verdict , and they will be afraid to defy a court ’ s judgment .
TLB	Deuteronomy	17	14	“ When you arrive in the land the Lord your God will give you , and have conquered it , and begin to think , ‘ We ought to have a king like the other nations around us ’ —
TLB	Deuteronomy	17	15	be sure that you select as king the man the Lord your God shall choose . He must be an Israelite , not a foreigner .
TLB	Deuteronomy	17	16	Be sure that he doesn ’ t build up a large stable of horses for himself , nor send his men to Egypt to raise horses for him there , for the Lord has told you , ‘ Never return to Egypt again. ’
TLB	Deuteronomy	17	18	“ And when he has been crowned and sits upon his throne as king , then he must copy these laws from the book kept by the Levite-priests .
TLB	Deuteronomy	17	19	That copy of the laws shall be his constant companion . He must read from it every day of his life so that he will learn to respect the Lord his God by obeying all of his commands .
TLB	Deuteronomy	17	20	This regular reading of God ’ s laws will prevent him from feeling that he is better than his fellow citizens . It will also prevent him from turning away from God ’ s laws in the slightest respect and will ensure his having a long , good reign . His sons will then follow him upon the throne .

TLB	Deuteronomy	18	3	The shoulder , the cheeks , and the stomach of every ox or sheep brought for sacrifice must be given to the priests .
TLB	Deuteronomy	18	4	In addition , the priests shall receive the harvest samples brought in thanksgiving to the Lord—the first of the grain , the new wine , the olive oil , and of the fleece at shearing time .
TLB	Deuteronomy	18	5	For the Lord your God has chosen the tribe of Levi , of all the tribes , to minister to the Lord from generation to generation . 6-7 “ Any Levite , no matter where he lives in the land of Israel , has the right to come to the sanctuary at any time and minister in the name of the Lord , just like his brother Levites who work there regularly .
TLB	Deuteronomy	18	8	He shall be given his share of the sacrifices and offerings as his right , not just if he is in need .
TLB	Deuteronomy	18	9	“ When you arrive in the Promised Land you must be very careful lest you be corrupted by the horrible customs of the nations now living there .
TLB	Deuteronomy	18	10	For example , any Israeli who presents his child to be burned to death as a sacrifice to heathen gods must be killed . [ a ] No Israeli may practice black magic , or call on the evil spirits for aid , or be a fortune-teller ,
TLB	Deuteronomy	18	11	or be a serpent charmer , medium , or wizard , or call forth the spirits of the dead .
TLB	Deuteronomy	18	12	Anyone doing these things is an object of horror and disgust to the Lord , and it is because the nations do these things that the Lord your God will displace them .
TLB	Deuteronomy	18	13	You must walk blamelessly before the Lord your God .
TLB	Deuteronomy	18	14	The nations you replace all do these evil things , but the Lord your God will not permit you to do such things .
TLB	Deuteronomy	18	15	“ Instead , he will raise up for you a prophet like me , an Israeli , a man to whom you must listen and whom you must obey .
TLB	Deuteronomy	18	16	For this is what you yourselves begged of God at Mount Horeb . There at the foot of the mountain you begged that you might not have to listen to the terrifying voice of God again , or see the awesome fire on the mountain , lest you die .

TLB	Deuteronomy	18	21	If you wonder , ‘ How shall we know whether the prophecy is from the Lord or not ? ’

TLB	Deuteronomy	19	5	If a man goes into the forest with his neighbor to chop wood , and the axhead flies off the handle and kills the man ’ s neighbor , he may flee to one of those cities and be safe . 6-7 Anyone seeking to avenge the death will not be able to . These cities must be scattered so that one of them will be reasonably close to everyone ; otherwise the angry avenger might catch and kill the innocent slayer , even though he should not have died since he had not killed deliberately .

TLB	Deuteronomy	19	9	( whether he does this depends on your obedience to all these commandments I am giving you today—loving the Lord your God and walking his paths ) , then you must designate three additional Cities of Refuge .

TLB	Deuteronomy	20	18	The purpose of this command is to prevent the people of the land from luring you into idol worship and into participation in their loathsome customs , thus sinning deeply against the Lord your God .
TLB	Deuteronomy	20	19	“ When you besiege a city , don ’ t destroy the fruit trees . Eat all the fruit you wish ; just don ’ t cut down the trees . They aren ’ t enemies who need to be slaughtered !

TLB	Deuteronomy	21	2	the elders and judges shall measure from the body to the nearest city .
TLB	Deuteronomy	21	3	Then the elders of that city shall take a heifer that has never been yoked ,
TLB	Deuteronomy	21	4	and lead it to a valley where there is running water—a valley neither plowed nor sowed—and there break its neck .
TLB	Deuteronomy	21	5	“ Then the priests shall come ( for the Lord your God has chosen them to minister before him and to pronounce his blessings and decide lawsuits and punishments ) ,
TLB	Deuteronomy	21	6	and shall wash their hands over the heifer ,
TLB	Deuteronomy	21	7	and say , ‘ Our hands have not shed this blood , neither have our eyes seen it .
TLB	Deuteronomy	21	8	O Lord , forgive your people Israel whom you have redeemed , and do not charge them with murdering an innocent man . Forgive us the guilt of this man ’ s blood. ’
TLB	Deuteronomy	21	9	In this way you will put away the guilt from among you by following the Lord ’ s directions .
TLB	Deuteronomy	21	10	“ When you go to war and the Lord your God delivers your enemies to you ,
TLB	Deuteronomy	21	11	and you see among the captives a beautiful girl you want as your wife ,
TLB	Deuteronomy	21	12	take her home with you . She must shave her head and pare her nails
TLB	Deuteronomy	21	13	and change her clothing , laying aside that which she was wearing when she was captured , then remain in your home in mourning for her father and mother for a full month . After that you may marry her .
TLB	Deuteronomy	21	14	However , if after marrying her you decide you don ’ t like her , you must let her go free—you may not sell her or treat her as a slave , for you have humiliated her .
TLB	Deuteronomy	21	15	“ If a man has two wives but loves one and not the other , and both have borne him children , and the mother of his oldest son is the wife he doesn ’ t love ,
TLB	Deuteronomy	21	16	he may not give a larger inheritance to his younger son , the son of the wife he loves .
TLB	Deuteronomy	21	17	He must give the customary double portion to his oldest son , who is the beginning of his strength and who owns the rights of a firstborn son , even though he is the son of the wife his father doesn ’ t love .
TLB	Deuteronomy	21	18	“ If a man has a stubborn , rebellious son who will not obey his father or mother , even though they punish him ,
TLB	Deuteronomy	21	19	then his father and mother shall take him before the elders of the city
TLB	Deuteronomy	21	20	and declare , ‘ This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious and won ’ t obey ; he is a worthless drunkard. ’
TLB	Deuteronomy	21	22	“ If a man has committed a crime worthy of death , and is executed and then hanged on a tree ,

TLB	Deuteronomy	22	22	“ If a man is discovered committing adultery , both he and the other man ’ s wife must be killed ; in this way evil will be cleansed from Israel . 23-24 If a girl who is engaged is seduced within the walls of a city , both she and the man who seduced her shall be taken outside the gates and stoned to death—the girl because she didn ’ t scream for help , and the man because he has violated the virginity of another man ’ s fiancée . 25-27 In this way you will reduce crime among you . But if this deed takes place out in the country , only the man shall die . The girl is as innocent as a murder victim ; for it must be assumed that she screamed , but there was no one to hear and rescue her out in the field . 28-29 If a man rapes a girl who is not engaged and is caught in the act , he must pay a fine [ d ] to the girl ’ s father and marry her ; he may never divorce her .
TLB	Deuteronomy	22	2	If you don ’ t know who the owner is , take it to your farm and keep it there until the owner comes looking for it , and then give it to him .
TLB	Deuteronomy	22	3	The same applies to donkeys , clothing , or anything else you find . Keep it for its owner .
TLB	Deuteronomy	22	4	“ If you see someone trying to get an ox or donkey onto its feet when it has slipped beneath its load , [ a ] don ’ t look the other way . Go and help !
TLB	Deuteronomy	22	5	“ A woman must not wear men ’ s clothing , and a man must not wear women ’ s clothing . This is abhorrent to the Lord your God .
TLB	Deuteronomy	22	6	“ If a bird ’ s nest is lying on the ground , or if you spy one in a tree , and there are young ones or eggs in it with the mother sitting in the nest , don ’ t take the mother with the young .
TLB	Deuteronomy	22	7	Let her go , and take only the young . The Lord will bless you for it .
TLB	Deuteronomy	22	8	“ Every new house must have a guardrail around the edge of the flat rooftop to prevent anyone from falling off and bringing guilt to both the house and its owner .
TLB	Deuteronomy	22	9	“ Do not sow other crops in the rows of your vineyard . If you do , both the crops and the grapes shall be confiscated by the priests . [ b ]

TLB	Deuteronomy	22	11	“ Don ’ t wear clothing woven from two kinds of thread : for instance , wool and linen .
TLB	Deuteronomy	22	12	“ You must sew tassels on the four corners of your cloaks . 13-14 “ If a man marries a girl , then after sleeping with her accuses her of having had premarital intercourse with another man , saying , ‘ She was not a virgin when I married her , ’
TLB	Deuteronomy	22	15	then the girl ’ s father and mother shall bring the proof of her virginity to the city judges .
TLB	Deuteronomy	22	16	“ Her father shall tell them , ‘ I gave my daughter to this man to be his wife , and now he despises her 17-18 and has accused her of shameful things , claiming that she was not a virgin when she married ; yet here is the proof. ’ And they shall spread before the judges the blood-stained sheet from her marriage bed . The judges shall sentence the man to be whipped ,
TLB	Deuteronomy	22	19	and fine him one hundred dollars [ c ] to be given to the girl ’ s father , for he has falsely accused a virgin of Israel . She shall remain his wife and he may never divorce her .
TLB	Deuteronomy	22	20	But if the man ’ s accusations are true , and she was not a virgin ,
TLB	Deuteronomy	22	21	the judges shall take the girl to the door of her father ’ s home where the men of the city shall stone her to death . She has defiled Israel by flagrant crime , being a prostitute while living at home with her parents ; and such evil must be cleansed from among you .

TLB	Deuteronomy	23	2	A bastard may not enter the sanctuary , nor any of his descendants for ten generations .
TLB	Deuteronomy	23	3	“ No Ammonite or Moabite may ever enter the sanctuary , even after the tenth generation .
TLB	Deuteronomy	23	4	The reason for this law is that these nations did not welcome you with food and water when you came out of Egypt ; they even tried to hire Balaam , the son of Beor from Pethor , Mesopotamia , to curse you .
TLB	Deuteronomy	23	5	But the Lord wouldn ’ t listen to Balaam ; instead , he turned the intended curse into a blessing for you because the Lord loves you .
TLB	Deuteronomy	23	6	You must never , as long as you live , try to help the Ammonites or the Moabites in any way .
TLB	Deuteronomy	23	7	But don ’ t look down on the Edomites and the Egyptians ; the Edomites are your brothers and you lived among the Egyptians .
TLB	Deuteronomy	23	8	The grandchildren of the Egyptians who came with you from Egypt may enter the sanctuary of the Lord . 9-10 “ When you are at war , the men in the camps must stay away from all evil . Any man who becomes ceremonially defiled because of a seminal emission during the night must leave the camp
TLB	Deuteronomy	23	11	and stay outside until the evening ; then he shall bathe himself and return at sunset .
TLB	Deuteronomy	23	12	The toilet area shall be outside the camp .
TLB	Deuteronomy	23	13	Each man must have a spade as part of his equipment ; after every bowel movement he must dig a hole with the spade and cover the excrement .
TLB	Deuteronomy	23	14	The camp must be holy , for the Lord walks among you to protect you and to cause your enemies to fall before you ; and the Lord does not want to see anything indecent lest he turn away from you . 15-16 “ If a slave escapes from his master , you must not force him to return ; let him live among you in whatever town he shall choose , and do not oppress him . 17-18 “ No prostitutes are permitted in Israel , either men or women ; you must not bring to the Lord any offering from the earnings of a prostitute or a homosexual , for both are detestable to the Lord your God .
TLB	Deuteronomy	23	19	“ Don ’ t demand interest on loans you make to a brother Israelite , whether it is in the form of money , food , or anything else .
TLB	Deuteronomy	23	20	You may take interest from a foreigner , but not from an Israeli . For if you take interest from a brother , an Israeli , the Lord your God won ’ t bless you when you arrive in the Promised Land .
TLB	Deuteronomy	23	21	“ When you make a vow to the Lord , be prompt in doing whatever it is you promised him , for the Lord demands that you promptly fulfill your vows ; it is a sin if you don ’ t .

TLB	Deuteronomy	23	24	“ You may eat your fill of the grapes from another man ’ s vineyard , but do not take any away in a container .

TLB	Deuteronomy	24	2	If she then remarries
TLB	Deuteronomy	24	3	and the second husband also divorces her or dies ,
TLB	Deuteronomy	24	4	the former husband may not marry her again , for she has been defiled ; this would bring guilt upon the land the Lord your God is giving you .
TLB	Deuteronomy	24	5	“ A newly married man is not to be drafted into the army nor given any other special responsibilities ; for a year he shall be free to be at home , happy with his wife .

TLB	Deuteronomy	24	10	“ If you lend anything to another man , you must not enter his house to get his security .
TLB	Deuteronomy	24	11	Stand outside ! The owner will bring it out to you . 12-13 If the man is poor and gives you his cloak as security , you are not to sleep in it . Take it back to him at sundown so that he can use it through the night and bless you ; and the Lord your God will count it as righteousness for you . 14-15 “ Never oppress a poor hired man , whether a fellow Israelite or a foreigner living in your town . Pay him his wage each day before sunset , for since he is poor he needs it right away ; otherwise he may cry out to the Lord against you and it would be counted as a sin against you .
TLB	Deuteronomy	24	16	“ Fathers shall not be put to death for the sins of their sons nor the sons for the sins of their fathers ; every man worthy of death shall be executed for his own crime .
TLB	Deuteronomy	24	17	“ Justice must be given to migrants and orphans , and you must never accept a widow ’ s garment in pledge of her debt .
TLB	Deuteronomy	24	18	Always remember that you were slaves in Egypt and that the Lord your God rescued you ; that is why I have given you this command .
TLB	Deuteronomy	24	19	If , when reaping your harvest , you forget to bring in a sheaf from the field , don ’ t go back after it . Leave it for the migrants , orphans , and widows ; then the Lord your God will bless and prosper all you do .
TLB	Deuteronomy	24	20	When you beat the olives from your olive trees , don ’ t go over the boughs twice ; leave anything remaining for the migrants , orphans , and widows .

TLB	Deuteronomy	25	7	But if the dead man ’ s brother refuses to do his duty in this matter , refusing to marry the widow , then she shall go to the city elders and say to them , ‘ My husband ’ s brother refuses to let his brother ’ s name continue—he refuses to marry me. ’
TLB	Deuteronomy	25	8	The elders of the city will then summon him and talk it over with him , and if he still refuses ,

Bring it in a basket and hand it to the priest on duty and say to him , ‘ This gift is my acknowledgment that the Lord my God has brought me to the land he promised our ancestors. ’
TLB	Deuteronomy	26	4	The priest will then take the basket from your hand and set it before the altar .
TLB	Deuteronomy	26	5	You shall then say before the Lord your God , ‘ My ancestors were migrant Arameans who went to Egypt for refuge . They were few in number , but in Egypt they became a mighty nation . 6-7 The Egyptians mistreated us and we cried to the Lord God . He heard us and saw our hardship , toil , and oppression ,

TLB	Deuteronomy	28	33	A foreign nation you have not even heard of will eat the crops you will have worked so hard to grow . You will always be oppressed and crushed .
TLB	Deuteronomy	28	34	You will go mad because of all the tragedy you see around you .
TLB	Deuteronomy	28	35	The Lord will cover you with boils from head to foot .
TLB	Deuteronomy	28	36	“ He will exile you and the king you will choose to a nation to which neither you nor your ancestors gave a second thought ; and while in exile you shall worship gods of wood and stone !
TLB	Deuteronomy	28	37	You will become an object of horror , a proverb and a byword among all the nations , for the Lord will thrust you away .
TLB	Deuteronomy	28	38	“ You will sow much but reap little , for the locusts will eat your crops .
TLB	Deuteronomy	28	39	You will plant vineyards and care for them , but you won ’ t eat the grapes or drink the wine , for worms will destroy the vines .
TLB	Deuteronomy	28	40	Olive trees will be growing everywhere , but there won ’ t be enough olive oil to anoint yourselves ! For the trees will drop their fruit before it is matured .
TLB	Deuteronomy	28	41	Your sons and daughters will be snatched away from you as slaves .
TLB	Deuteronomy	28	42	The locusts shall destroy your trees and vines .
TLB	Deuteronomy	28	43	Foreigners living among you shall become richer and richer while you become poorer and poorer .
TLB	Deuteronomy	28	44	They shall lend to you , not you to them ! They shall be the head and you shall be the tail !
TLB	Deuteronomy	28	45	“ All these curses shall pursue and overtake you until you are destroyed—all because you refuse to listen to the Lord your God .
TLB	Deuteronomy	28	46	These horrors shall befall you and your descendants as a warning : 47-48 You will become slaves to your enemies because of your failure to praise God for all that he has given you . The Lord will send your enemies against you , and you will be hungry , thirsty , naked , and in want of everything . A yoke of iron shall be placed around your neck until you are destroyed !
TLB	Deuteronomy	28	49	“ The Lord will bring a distant nation against you , swooping down upon you like an eagle ; a nation whose language you don ’ t understand—
TLB	Deuteronomy	28	50	a nation of fierce and angry men who will have no mercy upon young or old .
TLB	Deuteronomy	28	51	They will eat you out of house and home until your cattle and crops are gone . Your grain , new wine , olive oil , calves , and lambs will all disappear .
TLB	Deuteronomy	28	52	That nation will lay siege to your cities and knock down your highest walls—the walls you will trust to protect you .
TLB	Deuteronomy	28	53	You will even eat the flesh of your own sons and daughters in the terrible days of siege that lie ahead .
TLB	Deuteronomy	28	54	The most tenderhearted man among you will be utterly callous toward his own brother and his beloved wife and his children who are still alive .
TLB	Deuteronomy	28	55	He will refuse to give them a share of the flesh he is devouring—the flesh of his own children—because he is starving in the midst of the siege of your cities . 56-57 The most tender and delicate woman among you—the one who would not so much as touch her feet to the ground—will refuse to share with her beloved husband , son , and daughter . She will hide from them the afterbirth and the new baby she has borne , so that she herself can eat them : so terrible will be the hunger during the siege and the awful distress caused by your enemies at your gates . 58-59 “ If you refuse to obey all the laws written in this book , thus refusing reverence to the glorious and fearful name of Jehovah your God , then Jehovah will send perpetual plagues upon you and upon your children .
TLB	Deuteronomy	28	60	He will bring upon you all the diseases of Egypt that you feared so much , and they shall plague the land .
TLB	Deuteronomy	28	61	And that is not all ! The Lord will bring upon you every sickness and plague there is , even those not mentioned in this book , until you are destroyed .
TLB	Deuteronomy	28	62	There will be few of you left , though before you were as numerous as stars . All this if you do not listen to the Lord your God .
TLB	Deuteronomy	28	63	“ Just as the Lord has rejoiced over you and has done such wonderful things for you and has multiplied you , so the Lord at that time will rejoice in destroying you ; and you shall disappear from the land .
TLB	Deuteronomy	28	64	For the Lord will scatter you among all the nations from one end of the earth to the other . There you will worship heathen gods that neither you nor your ancestors have known , gods made of wood and stone !
TLB	Deuteronomy	28	65	There among those nations you shall find no rest , but the Lord will give you trembling hearts , darkness , and bodies wasted from sorrow and fear .
TLB	Deuteronomy	28	66	Your lives will hang in doubt . You will live night and day in fear , and will have no reason to believe that you will see the morning light .
TLB	Deuteronomy	28	67	In the morning you will say , ‘ Oh , that night were here ! ’ And in the evening you will say , ‘ Oh , that morning were here ! ’ You will say this because of the awesome horrors surrounding you .
TLB	Deuteronomy	28	68	Then the Lord will send you back to Egypt in ships , a journey I promised you would never need to make again ; and there you will offer to sell yourselves to your enemies as slaves—but no one will even want to buy you. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Deuteronomy	29	29	“ There are secrets the Lord your God has not revealed to us , but these words that he has revealed are for us and our children to obey forever . The Living Bible copyright ©
TLB	Deuteronomy	29	4	But even yet the Lord hasn ’ t given you hearts that understand or eyes that see or ears that hear !
TLB	Deuteronomy	29	5	For forty years God has led you through the wilderness , yet your clothes haven ’ t become old , and your shoes haven ’ t worn out !
TLB	Deuteronomy	29	6	The reason he hasn ’ t let you settle down to grow grain for bread or grapes for wine and strong drink is so that you would realize that it is the Lord your God who has been caring for you .
TLB	Deuteronomy	29	7	“ When we came here , King Sihon of Heshbon and King Og of Bashan came out against us in battle , but we destroyed them ,
TLB	Deuteronomy	29	8	and took their land and gave it to the tribes of Reuben and Gad and to the half-tribe of Manasseh as their inheritance .
TLB	Deuteronomy	29	9	Therefore , obey the terms of this covenant so that you will prosper in everything you do .
TLB	Deuteronomy	29	10	All of you—your leaders , the people , your judges , and your administrative officers—are standing today before the Lord your God ,
TLB	Deuteronomy	29	11	along with your little ones and your wives and the foreigners that are among you—those who chop your wood and carry your water .
TLB	Deuteronomy	29	12	You are standing here to enter into a contract with Jehovah your God , a contract he is making with you today .
TLB	Deuteronomy	29	13	He wants to confirm you today as his people , and to confirm that he is your God , just as he promised your ancestors , Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob . 14-15 This contract is not with you alone as you stand before him today , but with all future generations of Israel as well .
TLB	Deuteronomy	29	16	“ Surely you remember how we lived in the land of Egypt , and how as we left , we came safely through the territory of enemy nations .
TLB	Deuteronomy	29	17	And you have seen their heathen idols made of wood , stone , silver , and gold .
TLB	Deuteronomy	29	18	The day that any of you—man or woman , family or tribe of Israel—begins to turn away from the Lord our God and desires to worship these gods of other nations , that day a root will be planted that will grow bitter and poisonous fruit .
TLB	Deuteronomy	29	19	“ Let no one blithely think , when he hears the warnings of this curse , ‘ I shall prosper even though I walk in my own stubborn way ! ’
TLB	Deuteronomy	29	20	For the Lord will not pardon ! His anger and jealousy will be hot against that man . And all the curses written in this book shall lie heavily upon him , and the Lord will blot out his name from under heaven .
TLB	Deuteronomy	29	21	The Lord will separate that man from all the tribes of Israel , to pour out upon him all the curses ( which are recorded in this book ) that befall those who break this contract .
TLB	Deuteronomy	29	22	Then your children and the generations to come and the foreigners that pass by from distant lands shall see the devastation of the land and the diseases the Lord will have sent upon it .
TLB	Deuteronomy	29	23	They will see that the whole land is alkali and salt , a burned over wasteland , unsown , without crops , without a shred of vegetation—just like Sodom and Gomorrah and Admah and Zeboiim , destroyed by the Lord in his anger .
TLB	Deuteronomy	29	24	“ ‘ Why has the Lord done this to his land ? ’ the nations will ask . ‘ Why was he so angry ? ’
TLB	Deuteronomy	29	25	“ And they will be told , ‘ Because the people of the land broke the contract made with them by Jehovah , the God of their ancestors , when he brought them out of the land of Egypt .
TLB	Deuteronomy	29	26	For they worshiped other gods , violating his express command .
TLB	Deuteronomy	29	27	That is why the anger of the Lord was hot against this land , so that all his curses ( which are recorded in this book ) broke forth upon them .
TLB	Deuteronomy	29	28	In great anger the Lord rooted them out of their land and threw them away into another land , where they still live today ! ’

TLB	Deuteronomy	30	30	“ When all these things have happened to you—the blessings and the curses I have listed—you will meditate upon them as you are living among the nations where the Lord your God will have driven you .
TLB	Deuteronomy	30	2	If at that time you want to return to the Lord your God , and you and your children have begun wholeheartedly to obey all of the commandments I have given you today ,
TLB	Deuteronomy	30	3	then the Lord your God will rescue you from your captivity ! He will have mercy upon you and come and gather you out of all the nations where he will have scattered you .
TLB	Deuteronomy	30	4	Though you are at the ends of the earth , he will go and find you and bring you back again
TLB	Deuteronomy	30	5	to the land of your ancestors . You shall possess the land again , and he will do you good and bless you even more than he did your ancestors !
TLB	Deuteronomy	30	6	He will cleanse your hearts and the hearts of your children and of your children ’ s children so that you will love the Lord your God with all your hearts and souls , and Israel shall come alive again ! 7-8 “ If you return to the Lord and obey all the commandments that I command you today , the Lord your God will take his curses and turn them against your enemies—against those who hate you and persecute you .
TLB	Deuteronomy	30	9	The Lord your God will prosper everything you do and give you many children and much cattle and wonderful crops ; for the Lord will again rejoice over you as he did over your fathers .
TLB	Deuteronomy	30	10	He will rejoice if you but obey the commandments written in this book of the law , and if you turn to the Lord your God with all your hearts and souls .
TLB	Deuteronomy	30	11	“ Obeying these commandments is not something beyond your strength and reach ;
TLB	Deuteronomy	30	12	for these laws are not in the far heavens , so distant that you can ’ t hear and obey them , and with no one to bring them down to you ;
TLB	Deuteronomy	30	13	nor are they beyond the ocean , so far that no one can bring you their message ;
TLB	Deuteronomy	30	14	but they are very close at hand—in your hearts and on your lips—so obey them .
TLB	Deuteronomy	30	15	“ Look , today I have set before you life and death , depending on whether you obey or disobey .
TLB	Deuteronomy	30	16	I have commanded you today to love the Lord your God and to follow his paths and to keep his laws , so that you will live and become a great nation , and so that the Lord your God will bless you and the land you are about to possess .
TLB	Deuteronomy	30	17	But if your hearts turn away and you won ’ t listen—if you are drawn away to worship other gods—
TLB	Deuteronomy	30	18	then I declare to you this day that you shall surely perish ; you will not have a long , good life in the land you are going in to possess .
TLB	Deuteronomy	30	19	“ I call heaven and earth to witness against you that today I have set before you life or death , blessing or curse . Oh , that you would choose life ; that you and your children might live !
TLB	Deuteronomy	30	20	Choose to love the Lord your God and to obey him and to cling to him , for he is your life and the length of your days . You will then be able to live safely in the land the Lord promised your ancestors , Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Deuteronomy	31	31	After Moses had said all these things to the people of Israel ,
TLB	Deuteronomy	31	2	he told them , “ I am now
TLB	Deuteronomy	31	120	years old ! I am no longer able to lead you , [ a ] for the Lord has told me that I shall not cross the Jordan River .
TLB	Deuteronomy	31	3	But the Lord himself will lead you and will destroy the nations living there , and you shall overcome them . Joshua is your new commander , as the Lord has instructed .
TLB	Deuteronomy	31	4	The Lord will destroy the nations living in the land , just as he destroyed Sihon and Og , the kings of the Amorites .
TLB	Deuteronomy	31	5	The Lord will deliver over to you the people living there , and you shall destroy them as I have commanded you .
TLB	Deuteronomy	31	6	Be strong ! Be courageous ! Do not be afraid of them ! For the Lord your God will be with you . He will neither fail you nor forsake you. ”
TLB	Deuteronomy	31	7	Then Moses called for Joshua and said to him , as all Israel watched , “ Be strong ! Be courageous ! For you shall lead these people into the land promised by the Lord to their ancestors ; see to it that they conquer it .
TLB	Deuteronomy	31	8	Don ’ t be afraid , for the Lord will go before you and will be with you ; he will not fail nor forsake you. ”
TLB	Deuteronomy	31	9	Then Moses wrote out the laws he had already delivered to the people and gave them to the priests , the sons of Levi , who carried the Ark containing the Ten Commandments of the Lord . Moses also gave copies of the laws to the elders of Israel . 10-11 The Lord commanded that these laws be read to all the people at the end of every seventh year—the Year of Release—at the Festival of Tabernacles , when all Israel would assemble before the Lord at the sanctuary .
TLB	Deuteronomy	31	12	“ Call them all together , ” the Lord instructed , “ —men , women , children , and foreigners living among you—to hear the laws of God and to learn his will , so that you will reverence the Lord your God and obey his laws .
TLB	Deuteronomy	31	13	Do this so that your little children who have not known these laws will hear them and learn how to revere the Lord your God as long as you live in the Promised Land. ”
TLB	Deuteronomy	31	14	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ The time has come when you must die . Summon Joshua and come into the Tabernacle where I can give him his instructions. ” So Moses and Joshua came and stood before the Lord .
TLB	Deuteronomy	31	15	He appeared to them in a great cloud at the Tabernacle entrance ,
TLB	Deuteronomy	31	16	and said to Moses , “ You shall die and join your ancestors . After you are gone , these people will begin worshiping foreign gods in the Promised Land . They will forget about me and break the contract I have made with them .
TLB	Deuteronomy	31	17	Then my anger will flame out against them and I will abandon them , hiding my face from them , and they shall be destroyed . Terrible trouble will come upon them , so that they will say , ‘ God is no longer among us ! ’
TLB	Deuteronomy	31	18	I will turn away from them because of their sins in worshiping other gods .
TLB	Deuteronomy	31	19	“ Now write down the words of this song , and teach it to the people of Israel as my warning to them .
TLB	Deuteronomy	31	20	When I have brought them into the land I promised their ancestors—a land ‘ flowing with milk and honey ’ —and when they have become fat and prosperous , and worship other gods and despise me and break my contract ,
TLB	Deuteronomy	31	21	and great disasters come upon them , then this song will remind them of the reason for their woes . ( For this song will live from generation to generation . ) I know now , even before they enter the land , what these people are like. ”
TLB	Deuteronomy	31	22	So , on that very day , Moses wrote down the words of the song and taught it to the Israelites .
TLB	Deuteronomy	31	23	Then he charged Joshua ( son of Nun ) to be strong and courageous and said to him , “ You must bring the people of Israel into the land the Lord promised them ; for the Lord says , ‘ I will be with you. ’ ”
TLB	Deuteronomy	31	24	When Moses had finished writing down all the laws that are recorded in this book ,
TLB	Deuteronomy	31	25	he instructed the Levites who carried the Ark containing the Ten Commandments
TLB	Deuteronomy	31	26	to put this book of the law beside the Ark , as a solemn warning to the people of Israel .
TLB	Deuteronomy	31	27	“ For I know how rebellious and stubborn you are , ” Moses told them . “ If even today , while I am still here with you , you are defiant rebels against the Lord , how much more rebellious will you be after my death !
TLB	Deuteronomy	31	28	Now summon all the elders and officers of your tribes so that I can speak to them , and call heaven and earth to witness against them .
TLB	Deuteronomy	31	29	I know that after my death you will utterly defile yourselves and turn away from God and his commands ; and in the days to come evil will crush you for you will do what the Lord says is evil , making him very angry. ”
TLB	Deuteronomy	31	30	So Moses recited this entire song to the whole assembly of Israel : Footnotes - Deuteronomy 31:2 I am no longer able to lead you , literally , “ I am no longer able to go out and come in. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Deuteronomy	32	32	They act like men of Sodom and Gomorrah : Their deeds [ d ] are bitter with poison ;
TLB	Deuteronomy	32	2	My words shall fall upon you Like the gentle rain and dew , Like rain upon the tender grass , Like showers on the hillside .
TLB	Deuteronomy	32	3	I will proclaim the greatness of the Lord . How glorious he is !
TLB	Deuteronomy	32	4	He is the Rock . His work is perfect . Everything he does is just and fair . He is faithful , without sin .
TLB	Deuteronomy	32	5	But Israel has become corrupt , Smeared with sin . They are no longer his ; They are a stubborn , twisted generation .
TLB	Deuteronomy	32	6	Is this the way you treat Jehovah ? O foolish people , Is not God your Father ? Has he not created you ? Has he not established you and made you strong ?
TLB	Deuteronomy	32	7	Remember the days of long ago ! ( Ask your father and the aged men ; They will tell you all about it . )
TLB	Deuteronomy	32	8	When God divided up the world among the nations , He gave each of them a supervising angel !
TLB	Deuteronomy	32	9	But he appointed none for Israel ; For Israel was God ’ s own personal possession !
TLB	Deuteronomy	32	10	God protected them in the howling wilderness As though they were the apple of his eye .
TLB	Deuteronomy	32	11	He spreads his wings over them , Even as an eagle overspreads her young . She carries them upon her wings— As does the Lord his people !
TLB	Deuteronomy	32	12	When the Lord alone was leading them , And they lived without foreign gods ,
TLB	Deuteronomy	32	13	God gave them fertile hilltops , Rolling , fertile fields , Honey from the rock , And olive oil from stony ground ! [ a ]
TLB	Deuteronomy	32	14	He gave them milk and meat— Choice Bashan rams , and goats— And the finest of the wheat ; They drank the sparkling wine .
TLB	Deuteronomy	32	15	But Israel [ b ] was soon overfed ; Yes , fat and bloated ; Then , in plenty , they forsook their God . They shrugged away the Rock of their salvation .
TLB	Deuteronomy	32	16	Israel began to follow foreign gods , And Jehovah was very angry ; He was jealous of his people .
TLB	Deuteronomy	32	17	They sacrificed to heathen gods , To new gods never before worshiped .
TLB	Deuteronomy	32	18	They spurned the Rock who had made them , Forgetting it was God who had given them birth .
TLB	Deuteronomy	32	19	God saw what they were doing , And detested them ! His sons and daughters were insulting him .
TLB	Deuteronomy	32	20	He said , ‘ I will abandon them ; See what happens to them then ! For they are a stubborn , faithless generation .
TLB	Deuteronomy	32	21	They have made me very jealous of their idols , Which are not gods at all . Now I , in turn , will make them jealous By giving my affections To the foolish Gentile nations of the world .
TLB	Deuteronomy	32	22	For my anger has kindled a fire That burns to the depths of the underworld , Consuming the earth and all of its crops , And setting its mountains on fire .
TLB	Deuteronomy	32	23	I will heap evils upon them And shoot them down with my arrows .
TLB	Deuteronomy	32	24	I will waste them with hunger , Burning fever , and fatal disease . I will devour them ! I will set wild beasts upon them , To rip them apart with their teeth ; And deadly serpents Crawling in the dust .
TLB	Deuteronomy	32	25	Outside , the enemies ’ sword— Inside , the plague [ c ] — Shall terrorize young men and girls alike ; The baby nursing at the breast , And aged men .
TLB	Deuteronomy	32	26	I had decided to scatter them to distant lands , So that even the memory of them Would disappear .
TLB	Deuteronomy	32	27	But then I thought , “ My enemies will boast , ‘ Israel is destroyed by our own might ; It was not the Lord Who did it ! ’ ”
TLB	Deuteronomy	32	28	Israel is a stupid nation ; Foolish , without understanding .
TLB	Deuteronomy	32	29	Oh , that they were wise ! Oh , that they could understand ! Oh , that they would know what they are getting into !
TLB	Deuteronomy	32	30	How could one single enemy chase a thousand of them , And two put ten thousand to flight , Unless their Rock had abandoned them , Unless the Lord had destroyed them ?
TLB	Deuteronomy	32	31	But the rock of other nations Is not like our Rock ; Prayers to their gods are valueless .
TLB	Deuteronomy	32	33	They drink the wine of serpent venom .
TLB	Deuteronomy	32	34	But Israel [ e ] is my special people , Sealed as jewels within my treasury .
TLB	Deuteronomy	32	35	Vengeance is mine , And I decree the punishment of all her enemies : Their doom is sealed .
TLB	Deuteronomy	32	36	The Lord will see his people righted , And will have compassion on them when they slip . He will watch their power ebb away , Both slave and free .
TLB	Deuteronomy	32	37	Then God will ask , ‘ Where are their gods— The rocks they claimed to be their refuge ?
TLB	Deuteronomy	32	38	Where are these gods now , To whom they sacrificed their fat and wine ? Let those gods arise , And help them !
TLB	Deuteronomy	32	39	Don ’ t you see that I alone am God ? I kill and make live . I wound and heal— No one delivers from my power . 40-41 I raise my hand to heaven And vow by my existence , That I will whet the lightning of my sword ! And hurl my punishments upon my enemies !
TLB	Deuteronomy	32	42	My arrows shall be drunk with blood ! My sword devours the flesh and blood Of all the slain and captives . The heads of the enemy Are gory with blood. ’
TLB	Deuteronomy	32	43	Praise his people , Gentile nations , For he will avenge his people , Taking vengeance on his enemies , Purifying his land And his people. ” 44-45 When Moses and Joshua had recited all the words of this song to the people ,
TLB	Deuteronomy	32	46	Moses made these comments : “ Meditate upon all the laws I have given you today , and pass them on to your children .
TLB	Deuteronomy	32	47	These laws are not mere words—they are your life ! Through obeying them you will live long , plentiful lives in the land you are going to possess across the Jordan River. ”
TLB	Deuteronomy	32	48	That same day , the Lord said to Moses ,
TLB	Deuteronomy	32	49	“ Go to Mount Nebo in the mountains of Abarim , in the land of Moab across from Jericho . Climb to its heights and look out across the land of Canaan , the land I am giving to the people of Israel .
TLB	Deuteronomy	32	50	After you see the land , you must die and join your ancestors , just as Aaron , your brother , died in Mount Hor and joined them .
TLB	Deuteronomy	32	51	For you dishonored me among the people of Israel at the springs of Meribah-kadesh , in the wilderness of Zin .
TLB	Deuteronomy	32	52	You will see spread out before you the land I am giving the people of Israel , but you will not enter it. ” Footnotes - Deuteronomy 32:13 oil from stony ground , or “ oil from flinty rocks. ” - Deuteronomy 32:15 Israel , literally , “ Jeshurun. ” - Deuteronomy 32:25 the plague , implied . - Deuteronomy 32:32 deeds , literally , “ grapes. ” - Deuteronomy 32:34 Israel , implied .

TLB	Deuteronomy	33	33	This is the blessing Moses , the man of God , gave to the people of Israel before his death :
TLB	Deuteronomy	33	2	“ The Lord came to us at Mount Sinai , And dawned upon us from Mount Seir ; He shone from Mount Paran , Surrounded by ten thousands of holy angels , [ a ] And with flaming fire at his right hand .
TLB	Deuteronomy	33	3	How he loves his people— His holy ones are in his hands . They followed in your steps , O Lord . They have received their directions from you .
TLB	Deuteronomy	33	4	The laws I have given Are your precious possession .
TLB	Deuteronomy	33	5	The Lord became king in Jerusalem , Elected by a convocation of the leaders of the tribes !
TLB	Deuteronomy	33	6	Let Reuben live forever And may his tribe increase ! ”
TLB	Deuteronomy	33	7	And Moses said of Judah : “ O Lord , hear the cry of Judah And unite him with Israel ; Fight for him against his enemies. ”
TLB	Deuteronomy	33	8	Then Moses said concerning the tribe of Levi : “ Give to godly Levi Your Urim and your Thummim . You tested Levi at Massah and at Meribah ;
TLB	Deuteronomy	33	9	He obeyed your instructions and destroyed many sinners , [ b ] Even his own children , brothers , fathers , and mothers .
TLB	Deuteronomy	33	10	The Levites shall teach God ’ s laws to Israel And shall work before you at the incense altar And the altar of burnt offering .
TLB	Deuteronomy	33	11	O Lord , prosper the Levites And accept the work they do for you . Crush those who are their enemies ; Don ’ t let them rise again. ”
TLB	Deuteronomy	33	12	Concerning the tribe of Benjamin , Moses said : “ He is beloved of God And lives in safety beside him . God surrounds him with his loving care , And preserves him from every harm. ”
TLB	Deuteronomy	33	13	Concerning the tribe of Joseph , he said : “ May his land be blessed by God With the choicest gifts of heaven And of the earth that lies below .
TLB	Deuteronomy	33	14	May he be blessed With the best of what the sun makes grow ; Growing richly month by month ,
TLB	Deuteronomy	33	15	With the finest of mountain crops And of the everlasting hills .
TLB	Deuteronomy	33	16	May he be blessed with the best gifts Of the earth and its fullness , And with the favor of God who appeared In the burning bush . Let all these blessings come upon Joseph , The prince among his brothers .
TLB	Deuteronomy	33	17	He is a young bull in strength and splendor , With the strong horns of a wild ox To push against the nations everywhere ; This is my blessing on the multitudes of Ephraim And the thousands of Manasseh. ”
TLB	Deuteronomy	33	18	Of the tribe of Zebulun , Moses said : “ Rejoice , O Zebulun , you outdoorsmen , And Issachar , you lovers of your tents ;
TLB	Deuteronomy	33	19	They shall summon the people To celebrate their sacrifices with them . Lo , they taste the riches of the sea And the treasures of the sand. ”
TLB	Deuteronomy	33	20	Concerning the tribe of Gad , Moses said : “ A blessing upon those who help Gad . He crouches like a lion , With savage arm and face and head .

TLB	Deuteronomy	34	34	Then Moses climbed from the plains of Moab to Pisgah Peak in Mount Nebo , across from Jericho . And the Lord pointed out to him the Promised Land , as they gazed out across Gilead as far as Dan :
TLB	Deuteronomy	34	2	“ There is Naphtali ; and there is Ephraim and Manasseh ; and across there , Judah , extending to the Mediterranean Sea ;
TLB	Deuteronomy	34	3	there is the Negeb ; and the Jordan Valley ; and Jericho , the city of palm trees ; and Zoar , ” the Lord told him .
TLB	Deuteronomy	34	4	“ It is the Promised Land , ” the Lord told Moses . “ I promised Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob that I would give it to their descendants . Now you have seen it , but you will not enter it. ”
TLB	Deuteronomy	34	5	So Moses , the disciple of the Lord , died in the land of Moab as the Lord had said .
TLB	Deuteronomy	34	6	The Lord buried him in a valley near Beth-peor in Moab , but no one knows the exact place .
TLB	Deuteronomy	34	7	Moses was
TLB	Deuteronomy	34	120	years old when he died , yet his eyesight was perfect and he was as strong as a young man .
TLB	Deuteronomy	34	8	The people of Israel mourned for him for thirty days on the plains of Moab .
TLB	Deuteronomy	34	9	Joshua ( son of Nun ) was full of the spirit of wisdom , for Moses had laid his hands upon him ; so the people of Israel obeyed him and followed the commandments the Lord had given to Moses .
TLB	Deuteronomy	34	10	There has never been another prophet like Moses , for the Lord talked to him face to face . 11-12 And at God ’ s command he performed amazing miracles that have never been equaled . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Joshua	1	1	After the death of Moses , the Lord ’ s disciple , God spoke to Moses ’ assistant , whose name was Joshua ( the son of Nun ) , and said to him ,
TLB	Joshua	1	2	“ Now that my disciple is dead , you are the new leader of Israel . [ a ] Lead my people across the Jordan River into the Promised Land .
TLB	Joshua	1	3	I say to you what I said to Moses : ‘ Wherever you go will be part of the land of Israel—
TLB	Joshua	1	4	all the way from the Negeb Desert in the south to the Lebanon mountains in the north , and from the Mediterranean Sea in the west to the Euphrates River in the east , including all the land of the Hittites. ’
TLB	Joshua	1	5	No one will be able to oppose you as long as you live , for I will be with you just as I was with Moses ; I will not abandon you or fail to help you .
TLB	Joshua	1	6	“ Be strong and brave , for you will be a successful leader of my people ; and they shall conquer all the land I promised to their ancestors .
TLB	Joshua	1	7	You need only to be strong and courageous and to obey to the letter every law Moses gave you , for if you are careful to obey every one of them , you will be successful in everything you do .
TLB	Joshua	1	8	Constantly remind the people about these laws , and you yourself must think about them every day and every night so that you will be sure to obey all of them . For only then will you succeed .
TLB	Joshua	1	9	Yes , be bold and strong ! Banish fear and doubt ! For remember , the Lord your God is with you wherever you go. ” 10-11 Then Joshua issued instructions to the leaders of Israel to tell the people to get ready to cross the Jordan River . “ In three days we will go across and conquer and live in the land which God has given us ! ” he told them . 12-13 Then he summoned the leaders of the tribes of Reuben , Gad , and the half-tribe of Manasseh and reminded them of their agreement with Moses : “ The Lord your God has given you a homeland here on the east side of the Jordan River , ” Moses had told them ,
TLB	Joshua	1	14	“ so your wives and children and cattle may remain here , but your troops , fully armed , must lead the other tribes across the Jordan River to help them conquer their territory on the other side ;
TLB	Joshua	1	15	stay with them until they complete the conquest . Only then may you settle down here on the east side of the Jordan. ”
TLB	Joshua	1	16	To this they fully agreed and pledged themselves to obey Joshua as their commander-in-chief . 17-18 “ We will obey you just as we obeyed Moses , ” they assured him , “ and may the Lord your God be with you as he was with Moses . If anyone , no matter who , rebels against your commands , he shall die . So lead on with courage and strength ! ” Footnotes - Joshua 1:2 you are the new leader of Israel , implied .

TLB	Joshua	2	2	but someone informed the king of Jericho that two Israelis who were suspected of being spies had arrived in the city that evening .
TLB	Joshua	2	3	He dispatched a police squadron to Rahab ’ s home , demanding that she surrender them . “ They are spies , ” he explained . “ They have been sent by the Israeli leaders to discover the best way to attack us. ”
TLB	Joshua	2	4	But she had hidden them , so she told the officer in charge , “ The men were here earlier , but I didn ’ t know they were spies .
TLB	Joshua	2	5	They left the city at dusk as the city gates were about to close , and I don ’ t know where they went . If you hurry , you can probably catch up with them ! ”
TLB	Joshua	2	6	But actually she had taken them up to the roof and hidden them beneath piles of flax that were drying there .
TLB	Joshua	2	7	So the constable and his men went all the way to the Jordan River looking for them ; meanwhile , the city gates were kept shut .
TLB	Joshua	2	8	Rahab went up to talk to the men before they retired for the night .
TLB	Joshua	2	9	“ I know perfectly well that your God is going to give my country to you , ” she told them . “ We are all afraid of you ; everyone is terrified if the word Israel is even mentioned .
TLB	Joshua	2	10	For we have heard how the Lord made a path through the Red Sea for you when you left Egypt ! And we know what you did to Sihon and Og , the two Amorite kings east of the Jordan , and how you ruined their land and completely destroyed their people .
TLB	Joshua	2	11	No wonder we are afraid of you ! No one has any fight left in him after hearing things like that , for your God is the supreme God of heaven , not just an ordinary god . 12-13 Now I beg for this one thing : Swear to me by the sacred name of your God that when Jericho is conquered you will let me live , along with my father and mother , my brothers and sisters , and all their families . This is only fair after the way I have helped you. ”
TLB	Joshua	2	14	The men agreed . “ If you won ’ t betray us , we ’ ll see to it that you and your family aren ’ t harmed , ” they promised .
TLB	Joshua	2	15	“ We ’ ll defend you with our lives. ” Then , since her house was on top of the city wall , she let them down by a rope from a window .
TLB	Joshua	2	16	“ Escape to the mountains , ” she told them . “ Hide there for three days until the men who are searching for you have returned ; then go on your way. ” 17-18 But before they left , the men had said to her , “ We can not be responsible for what happens to you unless this rope is hanging from this window and unless all your relatives—your father , mother , brothers , and anyone else—are here inside the house .
TLB	Joshua	2	19	If they go out into the street , we assume no responsibility whatsoever ; but we swear that no one inside this house will be killed or injured .
TLB	Joshua	2	20	However , if you betray us , then this oath will no longer bind us in any way. ”
TLB	Joshua	2	21	“ I accept your terms , ” she replied . And she left the scarlet rope hanging from the window .
TLB	Joshua	2	22	The spies went up into the mountains and stayed there three days , until the men who were chasing them had returned to the city after searching everywhere along the road without success .
TLB	Joshua	2	23	Then the two spies came down from the mountains and crossed the river and reported to Joshua all that had happened to them .
TLB	Joshua	2	24	“ The Lord will certainly give us the entire land , ” they said , “ for all the people over there are scared to death of us. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Joshua	3	3	Early the next morning Joshua and all the people of Israel left Acacia and arrived that evening at the banks of the Jordan River , where they camped for a few days before crossing . 2-4 On the third day officers went through the camp giving these instructions : “ When you see the priests carrying the Ark of God , [ a ] follow them . You have never before been where we are going now , so they will guide you . However , stay about a half mile behind , with a clear space between you and the Ark ; be sure that you don ’ t get any closer. ”
TLB	Joshua	3	5	Then Joshua told the people to purify themselves . “ For tomorrow , ” he said , “ the Lord will do a great miracle. ”
TLB	Joshua	3	6	In the morning Joshua ordered the priests , “ Take up the Ark and lead us across the river ! ” And so they started out .
TLB	Joshua	3	7	“ Today , ” the Lord told Joshua , “ I will give you great honor , so that all Israel will know that I am with you just as I was with Moses .
TLB	Joshua	3	8	Instruct the priests who are carrying the Ark to stop at the edge of the river. ”
TLB	Joshua	3	9	Then Joshua summoned all the people and told them , “ Come and listen to what the Lord your God has said .
TLB	Joshua	3	10	Today you are going to know for sure that the living God is among you and that he will , without fail , drive out the Canaanites , Hittites , Hivites , Perizzites , Girgashites , Amorites , and Jebusites—all the people who now live in the land you will soon occupy .
TLB	Joshua	3	11	Think of it ! The Ark of God , who is Lord of the whole earth , will lead you across the river !
TLB	Joshua	3	12	“ Now select twelve men , one from each tribe , for a special task . [ b ] 13-14 When the priests who are carrying the Ark touch the water with their feet , the river will stop flowing as though held back by a dam , and will pile up as though against an invisible wall ! ” Now it was the harvest season and the Jordan was overflowing all its banks ; but as the people set out to cross the river and as the feet of the priests who were carrying the Ark touched the water at the river ’ s edge , 15-16 suddenly , far up the river at the city of Adam , near Zarethan , the water began piling up as though against a dam ! And the water below that point flowed on to the Dead Sea until the riverbed was empty . Then all the people crossed at a spot where the river was close to the city of Jericho ,
TLB	Joshua	3	17	and the priests who were carrying the Ark stood on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan and waited as all the people passed by .

TLB	Joshua	4	4	So Joshua summoned the twelve men
TLB	Joshua	4	5	and told them , “ Go out into the middle of the Jordan where the Ark is . Each of you is to carry out a stone on your shoulder—twelve stones in all , one for each of the twelve tribes .
TLB	Joshua	4	6	We will use them to build a monument so that in the future , when your children ask , ‘ What is this monument for ? ’
TLB	Joshua	4	7	you can tell them , ‘ It is to remind us that the Jordan River stopped flowing when the Ark of God went across ! ’ The monument will be a permanent reminder to the people of Israel of this amazing miracle. ”
TLB	Joshua	4	8	So the men did as Joshua told them . They took twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan River—one for each tribe , just as the Lord had commanded Joshua . They carried them to the place where they were camped for the night and constructed a monument there .
TLB	Joshua	4	9	Joshua also built another monument of twelve stones in the middle of the river , at the place where the priests were standing ; and it is there to this day .
TLB	Joshua	4	10	The priests who were carrying the Ark stood in the middle of the river until all these instructions of the Lord , which had been given to Joshua by Moses , had been carried out . Meanwhile , the people had hurried across the riverbed ,
TLB	Joshua	4	11	and when everyone was over , the people watched the priests carry the Ark up out of the riverbed . 12-13 The troops of Reuben , Gad , and the half-tribe of Manasseh—fully armed as Moses had instructed , and forty thousand strong—led the other tribes of the Lord ’ s army across to the plains of Jericho .
TLB	Joshua	4	14	It was a tremendous day for Joshua ! The Lord made him great in the eyes of all the people of Israel , and they revered him as much as they had Moses and respected him deeply all the rest of his life . 15-16 For it was Joshua who , at the Lord ’ s command , issued the orders to the priests carrying the Ark . “ Come up from the riverbed , ” the Lord now told him to command them .
TLB	Joshua	4	17	So Joshua issued the order .
TLB	Joshua	4	18	And as soon as the priests came out , the water poured down again as usual and overflowed the banks of the river as before !
TLB	Joshua	4	19	This miracle occurred on the 25th of March . [ a ] That day the entire nation crossed the Jordan River and camped in Gilgal at the eastern edge of the city of Jericho ;
TLB	Joshua	4	20	and there the twelve stones from the Jordan were piled up as a monument .
TLB	Joshua	4	21	Then Joshua explained again the purpose of the stones : “ In the future , ” he said , “ when your children ask you why these stones are here and what they mean ,
TLB	Joshua	4	22	you are to tell them that these stones are a reminder of this amazing miracle—that the nation of Israel crossed the Jordan River on dry ground !
TLB	Joshua	4	23	Tell them how the Lord our God dried up the river right before our eyes and then kept it dry until we were all across ! It is the same thing the Lord did forty years ago [ b ] at the Red Sea !
TLB	Joshua	4	24	He did this so that all the nations of the earth will realize that Jehovah is the mighty God , and so that all of you will worship him forever. ” Footnotes - Joshua 4:19 the 25th of March , literally , “ The tenth day of the first month ” ( of the Jewish calendar ) . - Joshua 4:23 forty years ago , implied .

TLB	Joshua	5	5	When the nations west of the Jordan River—the Amorites and Canaanites who lived along the Mediterranean coast—heard that the Lord had dried up the Jordan River so the people of Israel could cross , their courage melted away completely and they were paralyzed with fear . 2-3 The Lord then told Joshua to set aside a day to circumcise the entire male population of Israel . ( It was the second time in Israel ’ s history that this was done . ) The Lord instructed them to manufacture flint knives for this purpose . The place where the circumcision rite took place was named “ The Hill of the Foreskins. ” 4-5 The reason for this second circumcision ceremony was that although when Israel left Egypt all of the men who had been old enough to bear arms had been circumcised , that entire generation had died during the years in the wilderness , and none of the boys born since that time had been circumcised .
TLB	Joshua	5	6	For the nation of Israel had traveled back and forth across the wilderness for forty years until all the men who had been old enough to bear arms when they left Egypt were dead ; they had not obeyed the Lord , and he vowed that he wouldn ’ t let them enter the land he had promised to Israel—a land that “ flowed with milk and honey. ”
TLB	Joshua	5	7	So now Joshua circumcised their children—the men who had grown up to take their fathers ’ places . 8-9 And the Lord said to Joshua , “ Today I have ended your shame of not being circumcised. ” [ a ] So the place where this was done was called Gilgal ( meaning , “ to end ” ) , and is still called that today . After the ceremony the entire nation rested in camp until the raw flesh of their wounds had been healed .
TLB	Joshua	5	10	While they were camped at Gilgal on the plains of Jericho , they celebrated the Passover during the evening of April first . [ b ] 11-12 The next day they began to eat from the gardens and grain fields which they invaded , and they made unleavened bread . The following day no manna fell , and it was never seen again ! So from that time on they lived on the crops of Canaan .
TLB	Joshua	5	13	As Joshua was sizing up the city of Jericho , a man appeared nearby with a drawn sword . Joshua strode over to him and demanded , “ Are you friend or foe ? ”
TLB	Joshua	5	14	“ I am the Commander-in-Chief of the Lord ’ s army , ” he replied . Joshua fell to the ground before him and worshiped him and said , “ Give me your commands. ”
TLB	Joshua	5	15	“ Take off your shoes , ” the Commander told him , “ for this is holy ground. ” And Joshua did .

TLB	Joshua	6	6	The gates of Jericho were kept tightly shut because the people were afraid of the Israelis ; no one was allowed to go in or out .
TLB	Joshua	6	2	But the Lord said to Joshua , “ Jericho and its king and all its mighty warriors are already defeated , for I have given them to you ! 3-4 Your entire army is to walk around the city once a day for six days , followed by seven priests walking ahead of the Ark , each carrying a trumpet made from a ram ’ s horn . On the seventh day you are to walk around the city seven times , with the priests blowing their trumpets .
TLB	Joshua	6	5	Then , when they give one long , loud blast , all the people are to give a mighty shout , and the walls of the city will fall down ; then move in upon the city from every direction. ” 6-9 So Joshua summoned the priests and gave them their instructions : the armed men would lead the procession , followed by seven priests blowing continually on their trumpets . Behind them would come the priests carrying the Ark , followed by a rear guard .
TLB	Joshua	6	10	“ Let there be complete silence except for the trumpets , ” Joshua commanded . “ Not a single word from any of you until I tell you to shout ; then shout ! ”
TLB	Joshua	6	11	The Ark was carried around the city once that day , after which everyone returned to the camp again and spent the night there . 12-14 At dawn the next morning they went around again and returned again to the camp . They followed this pattern for six days .
TLB	Joshua	6	15	At dawn of the seventh day they started out again , but this time they went around the city not once , but seven times .
TLB	Joshua	6	16	The seventh time , as the priests blew a long , loud trumpet blast , Joshua yelled to the people , “ Shout ! The Lord has given us the city ! ”
TLB	Joshua	6	17	( He had told them previously , “ Kill everyone except Rahab the prostitute and anyone in her house , for she protected our spies .
TLB	Joshua	6	18	Don ’ t take any loot , for everything is to be destroyed . If it isn ’ t , disaster will fall upon the entire nation of Israel .
TLB	Joshua	6	19	But all the silver and gold and the utensils of bronze and iron will be dedicated to the Lord and must be brought into his treasury. ” )
TLB	Joshua	6	20	So when the people heard the trumpet blast , they shouted as loud as they could . And suddenly the walls of Jericho crumbled and fell before them , and the people of Israel poured into the city from every side and captured it !
TLB	Joshua	6	21	They destroyed everything in it—men and women , young and old ; oxen ; sheep ; donkeys—everything .
TLB	Joshua	6	22	Meanwhile Joshua had said to the two spies , “ Keep your promise . Go and rescue the prostitute and everyone with her. ”
TLB	Joshua	6	23	The young men found her and rescued her , along with her father , mother , brothers , and other relatives who were with her . Arrangements were made for them to live outside the camp of Israel .
TLB	Joshua	6	24	Then the Israelis burned the city and everything in it except that the silver and gold and the bronze and iron utensils were kept for the Lord ’ s treasury .
TLB	Joshua	6	25	Thus Joshua saved Rahab the prostitute and her relatives who were with her in the house , and they still live among the Israelites because she hid the spies sent to Jericho by Joshua .
TLB	Joshua	6	26	Then Joshua declared a terrible curse upon anyone who might rebuild Jericho , warning that when the foundation was laid , the builder ’ s oldest son would die , and when the gates were set up , his youngest son would die . [ a ]
TLB	Joshua	6	27	So the Lord was with Joshua , and his name became famous everywhere . Footnotes - Joshua 6:26 See

TLB	Joshua	7	7	Joshua cried out to the Lord , “ O Jehovah , why have you brought us over the Jordan River if you are going to let the Amorites kill us ? Why weren ’ t we content with what we had ? Why didn ’ t we stay on the other side ?
TLB	Joshua	7	2	Soon after Jericho ’ s defeat , Joshua sent some of his men to spy on the city of Ai , east of Bethel .
TLB	Joshua	7	3	Upon their return they told Joshua , “ It ’ s a small city and it won ’ t take more than two or three thousand of us to destroy it ; there ’ s no point in all of us going there. ”
TLB	Joshua	7	4	So approximately three thousand soldiers were sent—and they were soundly defeated .
TLB	Joshua	7	5	About thirty-six of the Israelis were killed during the attack , and many others died while being chased by the men of Ai as far as the quarries . The Israeli army was paralyzed with fear at this turn of events .
TLB	Joshua	7	6	Joshua and the elders of Israel tore their clothing and lay prostrate before the Ark of the Lord until evening , with dust on their heads .
TLB	Joshua	7	8	O Lord , what am I to do now that Israel has fled from her enemies !
TLB	Joshua	7	9	For when the Canaanites and the other nearby nations hear about it , they will surround us and attack us and wipe us out . And then what will happen to the honor of your great name ? ” 10-11 But the Lord said to Joshua , “ Get up off your face ! Israel has sinned and disobeyed my commandment and has taken loot when I said it was not to be taken ; and they have not only taken it , they have lied about it and have hidden it among their belongings .
TLB	Joshua	7	12	That is why the people of Israel are being defeated . That is why your men are running from their enemies—for they are cursed . [ a ] I will not stay with you any longer unless you completely rid yourselves of this sin .
TLB	Joshua	7	13	“ Get up ! Tell the people , ‘ Each of you must undergo purification rites in preparation for tomorrow , for the Lord your God of Israel says that someone has stolen from him , and you can not defeat your enemies until you deal with this sin .
TLB	Joshua	7	14	In the morning you must come by tribes , and the Lord will point out the tribe to which the guilty man belongs . And that tribe must come by its clans and the Lord will point out the guilty clan ; and the clan must come by its families , and then each member of the guilty family must come one by one .
TLB	Joshua	7	15	And the one who has stolen that which belongs to the Lord shall be burned with fire , along with everything he has , for he has violated the covenant of the Lord and has brought calamity upon all of Israel. ’ ”
TLB	Joshua	7	16	So , early the next morning , Joshua brought the tribes of Israel before the Lord , and the tribe of Judah was indicated .
TLB	Joshua	7	17	Then he brought the clans of Judah , and the clan of Zerah was singled out . Then the families of that clan were brought before the Lord and the family of Zabdi was indicated .
TLB	Joshua	7	18	Zabdi ’ s family was brought man by man , and his grandson Achan was found to be the guilty one .
TLB	Joshua	7	19	Joshua said to Achan , “ My son , give glory to the God of Israel and make your confession . Tell me what you have done. ”
TLB	Joshua	7	20	Achan replied , “ I have sinned against the Lord , the God of Israel .
TLB	Joshua	7	21	For I saw a beautiful robe imported from Babylon , and some silver worth $
TLB	Joshua	7	200	, and a bar of gold worth $
TLB	Joshua	7	500	. I wanted them so much that I took them , and they are hidden in the ground beneath my tent , with the silver buried deeper than the rest. ”
TLB	Joshua	7	22	So Joshua sent some men to search for the loot . They ran to the tent and found the stolen goods hidden there just as Achan had said , with the silver buried beneath the rest .
TLB	Joshua	7	23	They brought it all to Joshua and laid it on the ground in front of him .
TLB	Joshua	7	24	Then Joshua and all the Israelites took Achan , the silver , the robe , the wedge of gold , his sons , his daughters , his oxen , donkeys , sheep , his tent , and everything he had , and brought them to the valley of Achor .
TLB	Joshua	7	25	Then Joshua said to Achan , “ Why have you brought calamity upon us ? The Lord will now bring calamity upon you. ” And the men of Israel stoned them to death and burned their bodies ,
TLB	Joshua	7	26	and piled a great heap of stones upon them . The stones are still there to this day , and even today that place is called “ The Valley of Calamity. ” And so the fierce anger of the Lord was ended .

TLB	Joshua	8	8	Set the city on fire , as the Lord has commanded . You now have your instructions. ”
TLB	Joshua	8	2	You shall do to them as you did to Jericho and her king ; but this time you may keep the loot and the cattle for yourselves . Set an ambush behind the city. ” 3-4 Before the main army left for Ai , Joshua sent thirty thousand of his bravest troops to hide in ambush close behind the city , alert for action .
TLB	Joshua	8	5	“ This is the plan , ” he explained to them . “ When our main army attacks , the men of Ai will come out to fight as they did before , and we will run away .
TLB	Joshua	8	6	We will let them chase us until they have all left the city ; for they will say , ‘ The Israelis are running away again just as they did before ! ’
TLB	Joshua	8	7	Then you will jump up from your ambush and enter the city , for the Lord will give it to you .
TLB	Joshua	8	9	So they left that night and lay in ambush between Bethel and the west side of Ai ; but Joshua and the rest of the army remained in the camp at Jericho .
TLB	Joshua	8	10	Early the next morning Joshua roused his men and started toward Ai , accompanied by the elders of Israel , 11-13 and stopped at the edge of a valley north of the city . That night Joshua sent another five thousand men [ a ] to join the troops in ambush on the west side of the city . He himself spent the night in the valley .
TLB	Joshua	8	14	The king of Ai , seeing the Israelis across the valley , went out early the next morning and attacked at the plain of the Arabah . But of course he didn ’ t realize that there was an ambush behind the city .

TLB	Joshua	8	18	Then the Lord said to Joshua , “ Point your spear toward Ai , for I will give you the city. ” Joshua did .
TLB	Joshua	8	19	And when the men in ambush saw his signal , they jumped up and poured into the city and set it on fire . 20-21 When the men of Ai looked behind them , smoke from the city was filling the sky , and they had nowhere to go . When Joshua and the troops who were with him saw the smoke , they knew that their men who had been in ambush were inside the city , so they turned upon their pursuers and began killing them .
TLB	Joshua	8	22	Then the Israelis who were inside the city came out and began destroying the enemy from the rear . So the men of Ai were caught in a trap and all of them died ; not one man survived or escaped ,
TLB	Joshua	8	23	except for the king of Ai , who was captured and brought to Joshua .
TLB	Joshua	8	24	When the army of Israel had finished slaughtering all the men outside the city , they went back and finished off everyone left inside .
TLB	Joshua	8	25	So the entire population of Ai , twelve thousand in all , was wiped out that day .
TLB	Joshua	8	26	For Joshua kept his spear pointed toward Ai until the last person was dead .
TLB	Joshua	8	27	Only the cattle and the loot were not destroyed , for the armies of Israel kept these for themselves . ( The Lord had told Joshua they could . )
TLB	Joshua	8	28	So Ai became a desolate mound of refuse , as it still is today .
TLB	Joshua	8	29	Joshua hanged the king of Ai on a tree until evening , but as the sun was going down , he took down the body and threw it in front of the city gate . There he piled a great heap of stones over it , which can still be seen .
TLB	Joshua	8	30	Then Joshua built an altar to the Lord God of Israel at Mount Ebal ,
TLB	Joshua	8	31	as Moses had commanded [ b ] in the book of his laws : “ Make me an altar of boulders that have neither been broken nor carved , ” the Lord had said concerning Mount Ebal . Then the priests offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings to the Lord on the altar .
TLB	Joshua	8	32	And as the people of Israel watched , Joshua carved upon the stones of the altar each of the Ten Commandments . [ c ]
TLB	Joshua	8	33	Then all the people of Israel—including the elders , officers , judges , and the foreigners living among them—divided into two groups , half of them standing at the foot of Mount Gerizim and half at the foot of Mount Ebal . Between them stood the priests with the Ark , ready to pronounce their blessing . ( This was all done in accordance with the instructions given long before by Moses . )
TLB	Joshua	8	34	Joshua then read to them all of the statements of blessing and curses that Moses had written in the book of God ’ s laws .
TLB	Joshua	8	35	Every commandment Moses had ever given was read before the entire assembly , including the women and children and the foreigners who lived among the Israelis .

TLB	Joshua	9	9	And they told him , “ We are from a very distant country ; we have heard of the might of the Lord your God and of all that he did in Egypt ,
TLB	Joshua	9	6	When they arrived at the camp of Israel at Gilgal , they told Joshua and the men of Israel , “ We have come from a distant land to ask for a peace treaty with you. ”
TLB	Joshua	9	7	The Israelis replied to these Hivites , “ How do we know you don ’ t live nearby ? For if you do , we can not make a treaty with you. ”
TLB	Joshua	9	8	They replied , “ We will be your slaves. ” “ But who are you ? ” Joshua demanded . “ Where do you come from ? ”
TLB	Joshua	9	10	and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites—Sihon , king of Heshbon , and Og , king of Bashan .
TLB	Joshua	9	11	So our elders and our people instructed us , ‘ Prepare for a long journey ; go to the people of Israel and declare our nation to be their servants , and ask for peace. ’
TLB	Joshua	9	12	This bread was hot from the ovens when we left , but now as you see , it is dry and moldy ;
TLB	Joshua	9	13	these wineskins were new , but now they are old and cracked ; our clothing and shoes have become worn out from our long , hard trip. ” 14-15 Joshua and the other leaders finally believed them . They did not bother to ask the Lord but went ahead and signed a peace treaty . And the leaders of Israel ratified the agreement with a binding oath .
TLB	Joshua	9	16	Three days later the facts came out—these men were close neighbors .
TLB	Joshua	9	17	The Israeli army set out at once to investigate and reached their cities in three days . ( The names of the cities were Gibeon , Chephirah , Beeroth , and Kiriath-jearim . )
TLB	Joshua	9	18	But the cities were not harmed because of the vow which the leaders of Israel had made before the Lord God . The people of Israel were angry with their leaders because of the peace treaty .
TLB	Joshua	9	19	But the leaders replied , “ We have sworn before the Lord God of Israel that we will not touch them , and we won ’ t .
TLB	Joshua	9	20	We must let them live , for if we break our oath , the wrath of Jehovah will be upon us. ”
TLB	Joshua	9	21	So they became servants of the Israelis , chopping their wood and carrying their water .
TLB	Joshua	9	22	Joshua summoned their leaders and demanded , “ Why have you lied to us by saying that you lived in a distant land , when you were actually living right here among us ?
TLB	Joshua	9	23	Now a curse shall be upon you ! From this moment you must always furnish us with servants to chop wood and carry water for the service of our God. ”
TLB	Joshua	9	24	They replied , “ We did it because we were told that Jehovah instructed his disciple Moses to conquer this entire land and destroy all the people living in it . So we feared for our lives because of you ; that is why we have done it .
TLB	Joshua	9	25	But now we are in your hands ; you may do with us as you wish. ”
TLB	Joshua	9	26	So Joshua would not allow the people of Israel to kill them ,
TLB	Joshua	9	27	but they became woodchoppers and water-carriers for the people of Israel and for the altar of the Lord—wherever it would be built ( for the Lord hadn ’ t yet told them where to build it ) . This arrangement is still in force at the time of this writing . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Joshua	10	10	Then the Lord threw them into a panic so that the army of Israel slaughtered great numbers of them at Gibeon and chased the others all the way to Beth-horon and Azekah and Makkedah , killing them along the way .
TLB	Joshua	10	2	he was very frightened . For Gibeon was a great city—as great as the royal cities and much larger than Ai—and its men were known as hard fighters .
TLB	Joshua	10	3	So King Adoni-zedek of Jerusalem sent messengers to several other kings : King Hoham of Hebron , King Piram of Jarmuth , King Japhia of Lachish , King Debir of Eglon .
TLB	Joshua	10	4	“ Come and help me destroy Gibeon , ” he urged them , “ for they have made peace with Joshua and the people of Israel. ”
TLB	Joshua	10	5	So these five Amorite kings combined their armies for a united attack on Gibeon .
TLB	Joshua	10	6	The men of Gibeon hurriedly sent messengers to Joshua at Gilgal . “ Come and help your servants ! ” they demanded . “ Come quickly and save us ! For all the kings of the Amorites who live in the hills are here with their armies. ”
TLB	Joshua	10	7	So Joshua and the Israeli army left Gilgal and went to rescue Gibeon .
TLB	Joshua	10	8	“ Don ’ t be afraid of them , ” the Lord said to Joshua , “ for they are already defeated ! I have given them to you to destroy . Not a single one of them will be able to stand up to you. ”
TLB	Joshua	10	9	Joshua traveled all night from Gilgal and took the enemy armies by surprise .
TLB	Joshua	10	11	And as the enemy was racing down the hill to Beth-horon , the Lord destroyed them with a great hailstorm that continued all the way to Azekah ; in fact , more men died from the hail than by the swords of the Israelis .
TLB	Joshua	10	12	As the men of Israel were pursuing and harassing the foe , Joshua prayed aloud , “ Let the sun stand still over Gibeon , and let the moon stand in its place over the valley of Aijalon ! ”
TLB	Joshua	10	13	And the sun and the moon didn ’ t move until the Israeli army had finished the destruction of its enemies ! This is described in greater detail in The Book of Jashar . So the sun stopped in the heavens and stayed there for almost twenty-four hours !
TLB	Joshua	10	14	There had never been such a day before , and there has never been another since , when the Lord stopped the sun and moon—all because of the prayer of one man . But the Lord was fighting for Israel .
TLB	Joshua	10	15	( Afterwards Joshua and the Israeli army returned to Gilgal . )
TLB	Joshua	10	16	During the battle the five kings escaped and hid in a cave at Makkedah .
TLB	Joshua	10	17	When the news was brought to Joshua that they had been found ,
TLB	Joshua	10	18	he issued a command that a great stone be rolled against the mouth of the cave and that guards be placed there to keep the kings inside .
TLB	Joshua	10	19	Then Joshua commanded the rest of the army , “ Go on chasing the enemy and cut them down from the rear . Don ’ t let them get back to their cities , for the Lord will help you to completely destroy them. ”
TLB	Joshua	10	20	So Joshua and the Israeli army continued the slaughter and wiped out the five armies except for a tiny remnant that managed to reach their fortified cities .
TLB	Joshua	10	21	Then the Israelis returned to their camp at Makkedah without having lost a single man ! And after that no one dared to attack Israel . 22-23 Joshua now instructed his men to remove the stone from the mouth of the cave and to bring out the five kings—of Jerusalem , Hebron , Jarmuth , Lachish , and Eglon .
TLB	Joshua	10	24	Joshua told the captains of his army to put their feet on the kings ’ necks .
TLB	Joshua	10	25	“ Don ’ t ever be afraid or discouraged , ” Joshua said to his men . “ Be strong and courageous , for the Lord is going to do this to all of your enemies. ”
TLB	Joshua	10	26	With that , Joshua plunged his sword into each of the five kings , killing them . He then hanged them on five trees until evening .
TLB	Joshua	10	27	As the sun was going down , Joshua instructed that their bodies be taken down and thrown into the cave where they had been hiding ; and a great pile of stones was placed at the mouth of the cave . ( The pile is still there today . )
TLB	Joshua	10	28	On that same day Joshua destroyed the city of Makkedah and killed its king and everyone in it . Not one person in the entire city was left alive .
TLB	Joshua	10	29	Then the Israelis went to Libnah .
TLB	Joshua	10	30	There , too , the Lord gave them the city and its king . Every last person was slaughtered , just as at Jericho .
TLB	Joshua	10	31	From Libnah they went to Lachish and attacked it .
TLB	Joshua	10	32	And the Lord gave it to them on the second day ; here , too , the entire population was slaughtered , just as at Libnah .
TLB	Joshua	10	33	During the attack on Lachish , King Horam of Gezer arrived with his army to try to help defend the city , but Joshua ’ s men killed him and destroyed his entire army . 34-35 The Israeli army then captured Eglon on the first day and , as at Lachish , they killed everyone in the city .
TLB	Joshua	10	36	After leaving Eglon they went to Hebron
TLB	Joshua	10	37	and captured it and all of its surrounding villages , slaughtering the entire population . Not one person was left alive .
TLB	Joshua	10	38	Then they turned back to Debir ,
TLB	Joshua	10	39	which they quickly captured with all of its outlying villages . And they killed everyone just as they had at Libnah .
TLB	Joshua	10	40	So Joshua and his army conquered the whole country—the nations and kings of the hill country , the Negeb , the lowlands , and the mountain slopes . They destroyed everyone in the land , just as the Lord God of Israel had commanded ,
TLB	Joshua	10	41	slaughtering them from Kadesh-barnea to Gaza , and from Goshen to Gibeon .
TLB	Joshua	10	42	This was all accomplished in one campaign , for the Lord God of Israel was fighting for his people .

TLB	Joshua	11	11	Every person there was killed and the city was burned .
TLB	Joshua	11	4	All these kings responded by mobilizing their armies and uniting to crush Israel . Their combined troops , along with a vast array of horses and chariots , covered the landscape around the springs of Merom as far as one could see ;
TLB	Joshua	11	5	for they established their camp at the springs of Merom .
TLB	Joshua	11	6	But the Lord said to Joshua , “ Don ’ t be afraid of them , for by this time tomorrow they will all be dead ! Hamstring their horses and burn their chariots. ”
TLB	Joshua	11	7	Joshua and his troops arrived suddenly at the springs of Merom and attacked .
TLB	Joshua	11	8	And the Lord gave all that vast army to the Israelis , who chased them as far as Great Sidon and a place called the Salt Pits , and eastward into the valley of Mizpah ; so not one enemy troop survived the battle .
TLB	Joshua	11	9	Then Joshua and his men did as the Lord had instructed , for they hamstrung the horses and burned all the chariots .
TLB	Joshua	11	10	On the way back , Joshua captured Hazor and killed its king . ( Hazor had at one time been the capital of the federation of all those kingdoms . )
TLB	Joshua	11	12	Then he attacked and destroyed all the other cities of those kings . All the people were slaughtered , just as Moses had commanded long before .
TLB	Joshua	11	13	( However , Joshua did not burn any of the cities built on mounds except for Hazor . )
TLB	Joshua	11	14	All the loot and cattle of the ravaged cities were taken by the Israelis for themselves , but they killed all the people .
TLB	Joshua	11	15	For so the Lord had commanded his disciple Moses ; and Moses had passed the commandment on to Joshua , who did as he had been told : he carefully obeyed all of the Lord ’ s instructions to Moses .
TLB	Joshua	11	16	So Joshua conquered the entire land—the hill country , the Negeb , the land of Goshen , the lowlands , the Arabah , and the hills and lowlands of Israel .
TLB	Joshua	11	17	The Israeli territory now extended all the way from Mount Halak , near Seir , to Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon , at the foot of Mount Hermon . And Joshua killed all the kings of those territories .
TLB	Joshua	11	18	It took seven years [ a ] of war to accomplish all of this .
TLB	Joshua	11	19	None of the cities was given a peace treaty except the Hivites of Gibeon ; all of the others were destroyed .
TLB	Joshua	11	20	For the Lord made the enemy kings want to fight the Israelis instead of asking for peace ; so they were mercilessly killed , as the Lord had commanded Moses .
TLB	Joshua	11	21	During this period Joshua routed all of the giants—the descendants of Anak who lived in the hill country in Hebron , Debir , Anab , Judah , and Israel ; he killed them all and completely destroyed their cities .
TLB	Joshua	11	22	None was left in all the land of Israel , though some still remained in Gaza , Gath , and Ashdod .
TLB	Joshua	11	23	So Joshua took the entire land just as the Lord had instructed Moses ; and he gave it to the people of Israel as their inheritance , dividing the land among the tribes . So the land finally rested from its war . Footnotes - Joshua 11:18 It took seven years , implied in other text , literally , “ a long time. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Joshua	12	4	King Og of Bashan , the last of the Rephaim , who lived at Ashtaroth and Edrei :

His kingdom also stretched south to include the northern half of Gilead where the boundary touched the border of the kingdom of Sihon , king of Heshbon .

TLB	Joshua	13	8	The other half of the tribe of Manasseh and the tribes of Reuben and Gad had already received their inheritance on the east side of the Jordan , for Moses had previously assigned this land to them .
TLB	Joshua	13	9	Their territory ran from Aroer , on the edge of the valley of the Arnon River , included the city in the valley , and crossed the tableland of Medeba to Dibon ;
TLB	Joshua	13	10	it also included all the cities of King Sihon of the Amorites , who reigned in Heshbon , and extended as far as the borders of Ammon .

TLB	Joshua	13	14	The Territorial Assignments The Land Given to the Tribe of Levi : Moses hadn ’ t assigned any land to the tribe of Levi : instead , they were given the offerings brought to the Lord .
TLB	Joshua	13	15	The Land Given to the Tribe of Reuben : Fitting the size of its territory to the size of its population , [ b ] Moses had assigned the following area to the tribe of Reuben :
TLB	Joshua	13	16	Their land extended from Aroer on the edge of the valley of the Arnon River , past the city of Arnon in the middle of the valley , to beyond the tableland near Medeba .

TLB	Joshua	13	22	The people of Israel also killed Balaam the magician , the son of Beor .
TLB	Joshua	13	23	The Jordan River was the western boundary of the tribe of Reuben .
TLB	Joshua	13	24	The Land Given to the Tribe of Gad : Moses also assigned land to the tribe of Gad in proportion to its population . [ c ]
TLB	Joshua	13	25	This territory included Jazer , all the cities of Gilead , and half of the land of Ammon as far as Aroer near Rabbah .
TLB	Joshua	13	26	It also extended from Heshbon to Ramath-mizpeh and Betonim , and from Mahanaim to Lodebar . 27-28 In the valley were Beth-haram , and Beth-nimrah , Succoth , Zaphon , and the rest of the kingdom of King Sihon of Heshbon .

TLB	Joshua	13	32	That was how Moses divided the land east of the Jordan River where the people were camped at that time across from Jericho .

TLB	Joshua	14	14	1-2 The conquered lands of Canaan were allotted to the remaining nine and a half tribes of Israel . The decision as to which tribe would receive which area was decided by throwing dice [ a ] before the Lord , and he caused them to turn up in the ways he wanted . Eleazar the priest , Joshua , and the tribal leaders supervised the lottery . 3-4 ( Moses had already given land to the two and a half tribes on the east side of the Jordan River . The tribe of Joseph had become two separate tribes , Manasseh and Ephraim , and the Levites were given no land at all , except cities in which to live and the surrounding pasturelands for their cattle .
TLB	Joshua	14	5	So the distribution of the land was in strict accordance with the Lord ’ s directions to Moses . )
TLB	Joshua	14	6	The Land Given to Caleb : A delegation from the tribe of Judah , led by Caleb , came to Joshua in Gilgal . “ Remember what the Lord said to Moses about you and me when we were at Kadesh-barnea ? ” Caleb asked Joshua .
TLB	Joshua	14	7	“ I was forty years old at the time , and Moses had sent us from Kadesh-barnea to spy out the land of Canaan . I reported what I felt was the truth ,
TLB	Joshua	14	8	but our brothers who went with us frightened the people and discouraged them from entering the Promised Land . But since I had followed the Lord my God ,
TLB	Joshua	14	9	Moses told me , ‘ The section of Canaan you were just in shall belong to you and your descendants forever. ’
TLB	Joshua	14	10	“ Now , as you see , from that time until now the Lord has kept me alive and well for all these forty-five years since crisscrossing the wilderness , and today I am eighty-five years old .
TLB	Joshua	14	11	I am as strong now as I was when Moses sent us on that journey , and I can still travel and fight as well as I could then !
TLB	Joshua	14	12	So I ’ m asking that you give me the hill country that the Lord promised me . You will remember that as spies we found the Anakim living there in great , walled cities , but if the Lord is with me , I shall drive them out of the land. ” 13-14 So Joshua blessed him and gave him Hebron as a permanent inheritance because he had followed the Lord God of Israel .

TLB	Joshua	15	15	Then he fought against the people living in the city of Debir ( formerly called Kiriath-sepher ) .
TLB	Joshua	15	5	The eastern boundary extended along the Dead Sea to the mouth of the Jordan River . The northern boundary began at the bay where the Jordan River empties into the Salt Sea ,
TLB	Joshua	15	6	crossed to Beth-hoglah , then proceeded north of Beth-arabah to the stone of Bohan ( son of Reuben ) .
TLB	Joshua	15	7	From that point it went through the valley of Achor to Debir , where it turned northwest toward Gilgal , opposite the slopes of Adummim on the south side of the valley . From there the border extended to the springs at En-shemesh and on to En-rogel .
TLB	Joshua	15	8	The boundary then passed through the valley of Hinnom , along the southern shoulder of Jebus ( where the city of Jerusalem is located ) , then west to the top of the mountain above the valley of Hinnom , and on up to the northern end of the valley of Rephaim .
TLB	Joshua	15	9	From there the border extended from the top of the mountain to the spring of Nephtoah , and from there to the cities of Mount Ephron before it turned northward to circle around Baalah ( which is another name for Kiriath-jearim ) . 10-11 Then the border circled west of Baalah to Mount Seir , passed along to the town of Chesalon on the northern shoulder of Mount Jearim , and went down to Beth-shemesh . Turning northwest again , the boundary line proceeded past the south of Timnah to the shoulder of the hill north of Ekron , where it bent to the left , passing south of Shikkeron and Mount Baalah . Turning again to the north , it passed Jabneel and ended at the Mediterranean Sea .
TLB	Joshua	15	12	The western border was the shoreline of the Mediterranean .
TLB	Joshua	15	13	The Land Given to Caleb : The Lord instructed Joshua to assign some of Judah ’ s territory to Caleb ( son of Jephunneh ) , so he was given the city of Arba ( also called Hebron ) , which had been named after Anak ’ s father .
TLB	Joshua	15	14	Caleb drove out the descendants of the three sons of Anak : Talmai , Sheshai , and Ahiman .
TLB	Joshua	15	16	Caleb said that he would give his daughter Achsah to be the wife of anyone who would go and capture Kiriath-sepher .
TLB	Joshua	15	17	Othniel ( son of Kenaz ) , Caleb ’ s nephew , was the one who conquered it , so Achsah became Othniel ’ s wife . 18-19 As she was leaving with him , she urged him to ask her father for an additional field as a wedding present . [ a ] She got off her donkey to speak to Caleb about this . “ What is it ? What can I do for you ? ” he asked . And she replied , “ Give me another present ! For the land you gave me is a desert . Give us some springs too ! ” Then he gave her the upper and lower springs .
TLB	Joshua	15	20	So this was the assignment of land to the tribe of Judah : 21-32 The cities of Judah which were situated along the borders of Edom in the Negeb , namely : Kabzeel , Eder , Jagur , Kinah , Dimonah , Adadah , Kedesh , Hazor , Ithnan , Ziph , Telem , Bealoth , Hazor-hadattah , Kerioth-hezron ( or , Hazor ) , Amam , Shema , Moladah , Hazar-gaddah , Heshmon , Beth-pelet , Hazar-shual , Beer-sheba , Biziothiah , Baalah , Iim , Ezem , Eltolad , Chesil , Hormah , Ziklag , Madmannah , Sansannah , Lebaoth , Shilhim , Ain , and Rimmon .

TLB	Joshua	16	16	1-4 The Southern Boundary of the Tribes of Joseph ( Ephraim and the half-tribe of Manasseh ) : This boundary extended from the Jordan River at Jericho through the wilderness and the hill country to Bethel . It then went from Bethel to Luz , then on to Ataroth , in the territory of the Archites ; and west to the border of the Japhletites as far as Lower Beth-horon , then to Gezer and on over to the Mediterranean . 5-6 The Land Given to the Tribe of Ephraim : The eastern boundary began at Ataroth-addar . From there it ran to Upper Beth-horon , then on to the Mediterranean Sea . The northern boundary began at the Sea , ran east past Michmethath , then continued on past Taanath-shiloh and Janoah .
TLB	Joshua	16	7	From Janoah it turned southward to Ataroth and Naarah , touched Jericho , and ended at the Jordan River .
TLB	Joshua	16	8	The western half of the northern boundary [ a ] went from Tappuah and followed along Kanah Brook to the Mediterranean Sea .
TLB	Joshua	16	9	Ephraim was also given some of the cities in the territory of the half-tribe of Manasseh .

TLB	Joshua	17	17	The Land Given to the Half-Tribe of Manasseh ( Joseph ’ s oldest son ) : The clan of Machir ( Manasseh ’ s oldest son who was the father of Gilead ) had already been given the land of Gilead and Bashan on the east side of the Jordan River , [ a ] for they were great warriors .
TLB	Joshua	17	2	So now , land on the west side of the Jordan [ b ] was given to the clans of Abiezer , Helek , Asriel , Shechem , Shemida , and Hepher .
TLB	Joshua	17	3	However , Hepher ’ s son Zelophehad ( grandson of Gilead , great-grandson of Machir , and great-great-grandson of Manasseh ) had no sons . He had only five daughters whose names were Mahlah , Noah , Hoglah , Milcah , and Tirzah .
TLB	Joshua	17	4	These women came to Eleazar the priest and to Joshua and the Israeli leaders and reminded them , “ The Lord told Moses that we were to receive as much property as the men of our tribe. ” [ c ] 5-6 So , as the Lord had commanded through Moses , these five women were given an inheritance along with their five great-uncles , and the total inheritance came to ten sections of land ( in addition to the land of Gilead and Bashan across the Jordan River ) .
TLB	Joshua	17	7	The northern boundary of the tribe of Manasseh extended southward from the border of Asher to Michmethath , which is east of Shechem . On the south the boundary went from Michmethath to the spring of Tappuah .
TLB	Joshua	17	8	( The land of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh , but the city of Tappuah , on the border of Manasseh ’ s land , belonged to the tribe of Ephraim . )
TLB	Joshua	17	9	From the spring of Tappuah the border of Manasseh followed the north bank of Kanah Brook to the Mediterranean Sea . ( Several cities south of the brook belonged to the tribe of Ephraim , though they were located in Manasseh ’ s territory . )
TLB	Joshua	17	10	The land south of the brook and as far west as the Mediterranean Sea was assigned to Ephraim , and the land north of the brook and east of the sea went to Manasseh . Manasseh ’ s northern boundary was the territory of Asher , and the eastern boundary was the territory of Issachar .
TLB	Joshua	17	11	The half-tribe of Manasseh was also given the following cities , which were situated in the areas assigned to Issachar and Asher : Beth-shean , Ibleam , Dor , En-dor , Taanach , Megiddo ( where there are the three cliffs ) , with their respective villages .
TLB	Joshua	17	12	But since the descendants of Manasseh could not drive out the people who lived in those cities , the Canaanites remained .
TLB	Joshua	17	13	Later on , however , when the Israelis became strong enough , they forced the Canaanites to work as slaves .
TLB	Joshua	17	14	Then the two tribes of Joseph came to Joshua and asked , “ Why have you given us only one portion of land when the Lord has given us such large populations ? ”
TLB	Joshua	17	15	“ If the hill country of Ephraim is not large enough for you , ” Joshua replied , “ and if you are able to do it , you may clear out the forest land where the Perizzites and Rephaim live. ” 16-18 “ Fine , ” said the tribes of Joseph , “ for the Canaanites in the lowlands around Beth-shean and the valley of Jezreel have iron chariots and are too strong for us. ” “ Then you shall have the mountain forests , ” Joshua replied , “ and since you are such a large , strong tribe you will surely be able to clear it all and live there . And I ’ m sure you can drive out the Canaanites from the valleys , too , even though they are strong and have iron chariots. ” Footnotes - Joshua 17:1 on the east side of the Jordan River , implied . - Joshua 17:2 on the west side of the Jordan , implied . - Joshua 17:4 as much property as the men of our tribe , see Numbers 27:5-7 .

TLB	Joshua	18	18	where it passed along the north edge of the Arabah . The border then went down into the Arabah ,
TLB	Joshua	18	3	Then Joshua asked them , “ How long are you going to wait before clearing out the people living in the land that the Lord your God has given to you ?
TLB	Joshua	18	4	Select three men from each tribe , and I will send them to scout the unconquered territory and bring back a report of its size and natural divisions so that I can divide it for you . 5-6 The scouts will map it into seven sections , and then I will throw the sacred dice to decide which section will be assigned to each tribe .
TLB	Joshua	18	7	However , remember that the Levites won ’ t receive any land ; they are priests of the Lord . That is their wonderful heritage . And of course the tribes of Gad and Reuben and the half-tribe of Manasseh won ’ t receive any more , for they already have land on the east side of the Jordan where Moses promised them that they could settle. ”
TLB	Joshua	18	8	So the scouts went out to map the country and to bring back their report to Joshua . Then the Lord could assign the sections of land to the tribes by the throw of the sacred dice .
TLB	Joshua	18	9	The men did as they were told and divided the entire territory into seven sections , listing the cities in each section . Then they returned to Joshua and the camp at Shiloh .
TLB	Joshua	18	10	There at the Tabernacle at Shiloh the Lord showed Joshua by the sacred lottery which tribe should have each section :
TLB	Joshua	18	11	The Land Given to the Tribe of Benjamin : The section of land assigned to the families of the tribe of Benjamin lay between the territory previously assigned to the tribes of Judah and Joseph .
TLB	Joshua	18	12	The northern boundary began at the Jordan River , went north of Jericho , then west through the hill country and the wilderness of Beth-aven .
TLB	Joshua	18	13	From there the boundary went south to Luz ( also called Bethel ) and proceeded down to Ataroth-addar in the hill country south of Lower Beth-horon .
TLB	Joshua	18	14	There the border turned south , passing the mountain near Beth-horon and ending at the village of Kiriath-baal ( sometimes called Kiriath-jearim ) , one of the cities of the tribe of Judah . This was the western boundary .
TLB	Joshua	18	15	The southern border ran from the edge of Kiriath-baal , over Mount Ephron to the spring of Naphtoah ,
TLB	Joshua	18	16	and down to the base of the mountain beside the valley of Hinnom , north of the valley of Rephaim . From there it continued across the valley of Hinnom , crossed south of the old city of Jerusalem [ a ] where the Jebusites lived , and continued down to En-rogel .
TLB	Joshua	18	17	From En-rogel the boundary proceeded northeast to En-shemesh and on to Geliloth ( which is opposite the slope of Adummim ) . Then it went down to the Stone of Bohan ( who was a son of Reuben ) ,
TLB	Joshua	18	19	ran south past Beth-hoglah , and ended at the north bay of the Dead Sea—which is the southern end of the Jordan River .
TLB	Joshua	18	20	The eastern border was the Jordan River . This was the land assigned to the tribe of Benjamin . 21-28 These twenty-six cities were included in the land [ b ] given to the tribe of Benjamin : Jericho , Beth-hoglah , Emek-keziz , Beth-arabah , Zimaraim , Bethel , Avvim , Parah , Ophrah , Chephar-ammoni , Ophni , Geba , Gibeon , Ramah , Beeroth , Mizpeh , Chephirah , Mozah , Rekem , Irpeel , Taralah , Zela , Haeleph , Jebus ( or Jerusalem ) , Gibeah , and Kiriath-jearim . All of these cities and their surrounding villages were given to the tribe of Benjamin .

TLB	Joshua	19	19	The Land Given to the Tribe of Simeon : The tribe of Simeon received the next assignment of land—including part of the land previously assigned to Judah . 2-7 Their inheritance included these seventeen cities [ a ] with their respective villages : Beer-sheba , Sheba , Moladah , Hazar-shual , Balah , Ezem , Eltolad , Bethul , Hormah , Ziklag , Beth-marcaboth , Hazar-susah , Beth-lebaoth , Sharuhen , En-rimmon , Ether , and Ashan .
TLB	Joshua	19	8	The cities as far south as Baalath-beer ( also known as Ramah-in-the-Negeb ) were also given to the tribe of Simeon .
TLB	Joshua	19	9	So the Simeon tribe ’ s inheritance came from what had earlier been given to Judah , for Judah ’ s section had been too large for them .
TLB	Joshua	19	10	The Land Given to the Tribe of Zebulun : The third tribe to receive its assignment of land was Zebulun . Its boundary started on the south side of Sarid .
TLB	Joshua	19	11	From there it circled to the west , going near Mareal and Dabbesheth until it reached the brook east of Jokneam .
TLB	Joshua	19	12	In the other direction , the boundary line went east to the border of Chisloth-tabor , and from there to Daberath and Japhia ;
TLB	Joshua	19	13	then it continued east of Gath-hepher , Ethkazin , and Rimmon and turned toward Neah .
TLB	Joshua	19	14	The northern boundary of Zebulun passed Hannathon and ended at the valley of Iphtahel . 15-16 The cities in these areas , besides those already mentioned , [ b ] included Kattath , Nahalal , Shimron , Idalah , Bethlehem , and each of their surrounding villages . Altogether there were twelve of these cities . 17-23 The Land Given to the Tribe of Issachar : The fourth tribe to be assigned its land was Issachar . Its boundaries included the following cities : Jezreel , Chesulloth , Shunem , Hapharaim , Shion , Anaharath , Rabbith , Kishion , Ebez , Remeth , En-gannim , En-haddah , Beth-pazzez , Tabor , Shahazumah , and Beth-shemesh—sixteen cities in all , each with its surrounding villages . The boundary of Issachar ended at the Jordan River . 24-26 The Land Given to the Tribe of Asher : The fifth tribe to be assigned its land was Asher . The boundaries included these cities : Helkath , Hali , Beten , Achshaph , Allammelech , Amad , and Mishal . The boundary on the west side went from Carmel to Shihor-libnath ,
TLB	Joshua	19	27	turned east toward Beth-dagon , and ran as far as Zebulun in the valley of Iphtahel , running north of Beth-emek and Neiel . It then passed to the east of Kabul ,
TLB	Joshua	19	28	Ebron , Rehob , Hammon , Kanah , and Greater Sidon .
TLB	Joshua	19	29	Then the boundary turned toward Ramah and the fortified city of Tyre and came to the Mediterranean Sea at Hosah . The territory also included Mahalab , Achzib , 30-31 Ummah , Aphek , and Rehob—an overall total of twenty-two cities and their surrounding villages .
TLB	Joshua	19	32	The Land Given to the Tribe of Naphtali : The sixth tribe to receive its assignment was the tribe of Naphtali .
TLB	Joshua	19	33	Its boundary began at Judah , at the oak in Zaanannim , and extended across to Adami-nekeb , Jabneel , and Lakkum , ending at the Jordan River .
TLB	Joshua	19	34	The western boundary began near Heleph and ran past Aznoth-tabor , then to Hukkok , and coincided with the Zebulun boundary in the south , and with the boundary of Asher on the west , and with the Jordan River at the east . 35-39 The fortified cities included in this territory were : Ziddim , Zer , Hammath , Rakkath , Chinnereth , Adamah , Ramah , Hazor , Kedesh , Edrei , Enhazor , Yiron , Migdal-el , Horem , Beth-anath , and Beth-shemesh . So altogether the territory included nineteen cities with their surrounding villages .
TLB	Joshua	19	40	The Land Given to the Tribe of Dan : The last tribe to be assigned its land was Dan . 41-46 The cities within its area included : Zorah , Eshtaol , Ir-shemesh , Shaalabbin , Aijalon , Ithlah , Elon , Timnah , Ekron , Eltekeh , Gibbethon , Baalath , Jehud , Bene-berak , Gath-rimmon , Me-jarkon , and Rakkon , also the territory near Joppa . 47-48 But some of this territory proved impossible to conquer , so the tribe of Dan captured the city of Leshem , slaughtered its people , and lived there ; and they called the city “ Dan , ” naming it after their ancestor .
TLB	Joshua	19	49	So all the land was divided among the tribes , with the boundaries indicated ; and the nation of Israel gave a special piece of land to Joshua ,
TLB	Joshua	19	50	for the Lord had said that he could have any city he wanted . He chose Timnath-serah in the hill country of Ephraim ; he rebuilt it and lived there .
TLB	Joshua	19	51	Eleazar the priest , Joshua , and the leaders of the tribes of Israel supervised the sacred lottery to divide the land among the tribes .

TLB	Joshua	20	4	When the innocent killer reaches any of these cities , he will meet with the city council and explain what happened , and they must let him come in and must give him a place to live among them .

TLB	Joshua	20	7	The cities chosen as Cities of Refuge were Kedesh of Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali ; Shechem , in the hill country of Ephraim ; and Kiriath-arba ( also known as Hebron ) in the hill country of Judah .
TLB	Joshua	20	8	The Lord also instructed that three cities be set aside for this purpose on the east side of the Jordan River , across from Jericho . They were Bezer , in the wilderness of the land of the tribe of Reuben ; Ramoth of Gilead , in the territory of the tribe of Gad ; and Golan of Bashan , in the land of the tribe of Manasseh .
TLB	Joshua	20	9	These Cities of Refuge were for foreigners living in Israel as well as for the Israelis themselves , so that anyone who accidentally killed another man could run to that place for a trial and not be killed in revenge . Footnotes - Joshua 20:2 as I instructed Moses , see Numbers

TLB	Joshua	21	21	Then the leaders of the tribe of Levi came to Shiloh to consult with Eleazar the priest and with Joshua and the leaders of the various tribes .
TLB	Joshua	21	2	“ The Lord instructed Moses to give cities to us Levites for our homes , and pastureland for our cattle , ” they said .
TLB	Joshua	21	3	So they were given some of the recently conquered cities with their pasturelands .
TLB	Joshua	21	4	Thirteen of these cities had been assigned originally to the tribes of Judah , Simeon , and Benjamin . These were given to some of the priests of the Kohath division ( of the tribe of Levi , descendants of Aaron ) .
TLB	Joshua	21	5	The other families of the Kohath division were given ten cities from the territories of Ephraim , Dan , and the half-tribe of Manasseh .
TLB	Joshua	21	6	The Gershon division received thirteen cities , selected by sacred lot in the area of Bashan . These cities were given by the tribes of Issachar , Asher , Naphtali , and the half-tribe of Manasseh .
TLB	Joshua	21	7	The Merari division received twelve cities from the tribes of Reuben , Gad , and Zebulun .
TLB	Joshua	21	8	So the Lord ’ s command to Moses was obeyed , and the cities and pasturelands were assigned by the toss of the sacred dice . 9-16 First to receive their assignment were the priests—the descendants of Aaron , who was a member of the Kohath division of the Levites . The tribes of Judah and Simeon gave them the nine cities [ a ] listed below , with their surrounding pasturelands : Hebron , in the Judean hills , as a City of Refuge—it was also called Kiriath-arba ( Arba was the father of Anak ) —although the fields beyond the city and the surrounding villages were given to Caleb , the son of Jephunneh ; Libnah , Jattir , Eshtemoa , Holon , Debir , Ain , Juttah , and Beth-shemesh . 17-18 The tribe of Benjamin gave them these four cities and their pasturelands : Gibeon , Gaba , Anathoth , and Almon .
TLB	Joshua	21	19	So in all , thirteen cities were given to the priests—the descendants of Aaron . 20-22 The other families of the Kohath division received four cities [ b ] and pasturelands from the tribe of Ephraim : Shechem ( a City of Refuge ) , Gezer , Kibza-im , and Beth-horon . 23-24 The following four cities and pasturelands were given by the tribe of Dan : Elteke , Gibbethon , Aijalon , and Gath-rimmon .
TLB	Joshua	21	25	The half-tribe of Manasseh gave the cities of Taanach and Gath-rimmon with their surrounding pasturelands .
TLB	Joshua	21	26	So the total number of cities and pasturelands given to the remainder of the Kohath division was ten .
TLB	Joshua	21	27	The descendants of Gershon , another division of the Levites , received two cities and pasturelands from the half-tribe of Manasseh : Golan , in Bashan ( a City of Refuge ) , and Beeshterah . 28-29 The tribe of Issachar gave four cities : Kishion , Daberath , Jarmuth , and Engannim . 30-31 The tribe of Asher gave four cities and pasturelands : Mishal , Abdon , Helkath , and Rehob .
TLB	Joshua	21	32	The tribe of Naphtali gave : Kedesh , in Galilee ( a City of Refuge ) , Hammoth-dor , and Kartan .
TLB	Joshua	21	33	So thirteen cities with their pasturelands were assigned to the division of Gershon . 34-35 The remainder of the Levites—the Merari division—were given four cities by the tribe of Zebulun : Jokneam , Kartah , Dimnah , and Nahalal . 36-37 Reuben gave them : Bezer , Jahaz , Kedemoth , and Mephaath . 38-39 Gad gave them four cities with pasturelands : Ramoth ( a City of Refuge ) , Mahanaim , Heshbon , and Jazer .
TLB	Joshua	21	40	So the Merari division of the Levites was given twelve cities in all . 41-42 The total number of cities and pasturelands given to the Levites came to forty-eight .
TLB	Joshua	21	43	So in this way the Lord gave to Israel all the land he had promised to their ancestors , and they went in and conquered it and lived there .
TLB	Joshua	21	44	And the Lord gave them peace , just as he had promised , and no one could stand against them ; the Lord helped them destroy all their enemies .

TLB	Joshua	22	22	Joshua now called together the troops from the tribes of Reuben , Gad , and the half-tribe of Manasseh , 2-3 and addressed them as follows : “ You have done as the Lord ’ s disciple Moses commanded you , and have obeyed every order I have given you—every order of the Lord your God . You have not deserted your brother tribes , even though the campaign has lasted for such a long time .
TLB	Joshua	22	4	And now the Lord our God has given us success and rest as he promised he would . So go home now to the land given you by the Lord ’ s servant Moses , on the other side of the Jordan River .
TLB	Joshua	22	5	Be sure to continue to obey all of the commandments Moses gave you . Love the Lord and follow his plan for your lives . Cling to him and serve him enthusiastically. ”
TLB	Joshua	22	6	So Joshua blessed them and sent them home . 7-8 ( Moses had assigned the land of Bashan to the half-tribe of Manasseh , although the other half of the tribe was given land on the west side of the Jordan . ) As Joshua sent away these troops , he blessed them and told them to share their great wealth with their relatives back home—their loot of cattle , silver , gold , bronze , iron , and clothing .
TLB	Joshua	22	9	So the troops of Reuben , Gad , and the half-tribe of Manasseh left the army of Israel at Shiloh in Canaan and crossed the Jordan River to their own homeland of Gilead .
TLB	Joshua	22	10	Before they went across , while they were still in Canaan , they built a large monument for everyone to see , in the shape of an altar .
TLB	Joshua	22	11	But when the rest of Israel heard about what they had done ,
TLB	Joshua	22	12	they mustered an army at Shiloh and prepared to go to war against their brother tribes .
TLB	Joshua	22	13	First , however , they sent a delegation led by Phinehas , the son of Eleazar the priest . They crossed the river and talked to the tribes of Reuben , Gad , and Manasseh .
TLB	Joshua	22	14	In this delegation were ten high officials of Israel , one from each of the ten tribes , and each a clan leader .
TLB	Joshua	22	15	When they arrived in the land of Gilead they said to the tribes of Reuben , Gad , and the half-tribe of Manasseh ,
TLB	Joshua	22	16	“ The whole congregation of the Lord demands to know why you are sinning against the God of Israel by turning away from him and building an altar of rebellion against the Lord . 17-18 Was our guilt at Peor—from which we have not even yet been cleansed despite the plague that tormented us—so little that you must rebel again ? For you know that if you rebel today the Lord will be angry with all of us tomorrow .
TLB	Joshua	22	19	If you need the altar because your land is defiled , then join us on our side of the river where the Lord lives among us in his Tabernacle , and we will share our land with you . But do not rebel against the Lord by building another altar in addition to the only true altar of our God .
TLB	Joshua	22	20	Don ’ t you remember that when Achan , the son of Zerah , sinned against the Lord , the entire nation was punished in addition to the one man who had sinned ? ”
TLB	Joshua	22	21	This was the reply of the people of Reuben , Gad , and the half-tribe of Manasseh to these high officials : 22-23 “ We swear by Jehovah , the God of gods , that we have not built the altar in rebellion against the Lord . He knows ( and let all Israel know it too ) that we have not built the altar to sacrifice burnt offerings or grain offerings or peace offerings—may the curse of God be on us if we did . 24-25 We have done it because we love the Lord and because we fear that in the future your children will say to ours , ‘ What right do you have to worship the Lord God of Israel ? The Lord has placed the Jordan River as a barrier between our people and your people ! You have no part in the Lord. ’ And your children may make our children stop worshiping him . 26-27 So we decided to build the altar as a symbol to show our children and your children that we , too , may worship the Lord with our burnt offerings and peace offerings and sacrifices , and your children will not be able to say to ours , ‘ You have no part in the Lord our God. ’
TLB	Joshua	22	28	If they say this , our children can reply , ‘ Look at the altar of the Lord that our fathers made , patterned after the altar of Jehovah . It is not for burnt offerings or sacrifices but is a symbol of the relationship with God that both of us have. ’
TLB	Joshua	22	29	Far be it from us to turn away from the Lord or to rebel against him by building our own altar for burnt offerings , grain offerings , or sacrifices . Only the altar in front of the Tabernacle may be used for that. ”
TLB	Joshua	22	30	When Phinehas the priest and the high officials heard this from the tribes of Reuben , Gad , and Manasseh , they were very happy .
TLB	Joshua	22	31	Phinehas replied to them , “ Today we know that the Lord is among us because you have not sinned against the Lord as we thought ; instead , you have saved us from destruction ! ”
TLB	Joshua	22	32	Then Phinehas and the ten ambassadors went back to the people of Israel and told them what had happened ,
TLB	Joshua	22	33	and all Israel rejoiced and praised God and spoke no more of war against Reuben and Gad .
TLB	Joshua	22	34	The people of Reuben and Gad named the altar “ The Altar of Witness , ” for they said , “ It is a witness between us and them that Jehovah is our God too. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Joshua	23	23	Long after this , when the Lord had given success to the people of Israel against their enemies and when Joshua was very old ,
TLB	Joshua	23	2	he called for the leaders of Israel—the elders , judges , and officers—and said to them , “ I am an old man now ,
TLB	Joshua	23	3	and you have seen all that the Lord your God has done for you during my lifetime . He has fought for you against your enemies and has given you their land . 4-5 And I have divided to you the land of the nations yet unconquered as well as the land of those you have already destroyed . All the land from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea shall be yours , for the Lord your God will drive out all the people living there now , and you will live there instead , just as he has promised you .
TLB	Joshua	23	6	“ But be very sure to follow all the instructions written in the book of the laws of Moses ; do not deviate from them the least little bit .
TLB	Joshua	23	7	Be sure that you do not mix with the heathen people still remaining in the land ; do not even mention the names of their gods , much less swear by them or worship them .
TLB	Joshua	23	8	But follow the Lord your God just as you have until now .
TLB	Joshua	23	9	He has driven out great , strong nations from before you , and no one has been able to defeat you .
TLB	Joshua	23	10	Each one of you has put to flight a thousand of the enemy , for the Lord your God fights for you , just as he has promised .
TLB	Joshua	23	11	So be very careful to keep on loving him .
TLB	Joshua	23	12	“ If you don ’ t , and if you begin to intermarry with the nations around you ,
TLB	Joshua	23	13	then know for a certainty that the Lord your God will no longer chase those nations from your land . Instead , they will be a snare and a trap to you , a pain in your side and a thorn in your eyes , and you will disappear from this good land which the Lord your God has given you .
TLB	Joshua	23	14	“ Soon I will be going the way of all the earth—I am going to die . “ You know very well that God ’ s promises to you have all come true . 15-16 But as certainly as the Lord has given you the good things he promised , just as certainly he will bring evil upon you if you disobey him . For if you worship other gods , he will completely wipe you out from this good land that the Lord has given you . His anger will rise hot against you , and you will quickly perish. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Joshua	24	24	The people replied to Joshua , “ Yes , we will worship and obey the Lord alone. ”
TLB	Joshua	24	2	Then Joshua addressed them as follows : “ The Lord God of Israel says , ‘ Your ancestors , including Terah the father of Abraham and Nahor , lived east of the Euphrates River ; and they worshiped other gods .
TLB	Joshua	24	3	But I took your father Abraham from that land across the river and led him into the land of Canaan and gave him many descendants through Isaac , his son .
TLB	Joshua	24	4	Isaac ’ s children , whom I gave him , were Jacob and Esau . To Esau I gave the area around Mount Seir while Jacob and his children went into Egypt .
TLB	Joshua	24	5	“ ‘ Then I sent Moses and Aaron to bring terrible plagues upon Egypt ; and afterwards I brought my people out as free men .
TLB	Joshua	24	6	But when they arrived at the Red Sea , the Egyptians chased after them with chariots and cavalry .
TLB	Joshua	24	7	Then Israel cried out to me and I put darkness between them and the Egyptians ; and I brought the sea crashing in upon the Egyptians , drowning them . You saw what I did . Then Israel lived in the wilderness for many years .
TLB	Joshua	24	8	“ ‘ Finally I brought you into the land of the Amorites on the other side of the Jordan ; and they fought against you , but I destroyed them and gave you their land .
TLB	Joshua	24	9	Then King Balak of Moab started a war against Israel , and he asked Balaam , the son of Beor , to curse you .
TLB	Joshua	24	10	But I wouldn ’ t listen to him . Instead I made him bless you ; and so I delivered Israel from him .
TLB	Joshua	24	11	“ ‘ Then you crossed the Jordan River and came to Jericho . The men of Jericho fought against you , and so did many others—the Perizzites , the Canaanites , the Hittites , the Girgashites , the Hivites , and the Jebusites . Each in turn fought against you , but I destroyed them all .
TLB	Joshua	24	12	And I sent hornets ahead of you to drive out the two kings of the Amorites and their people . It was not your swords or bows that brought you victory !
TLB	Joshua	24	13	I gave you land you had not worked for and cities you did not build—these cities where you are now living . I gave you vineyards and olive groves for food , though you did not plant them. ’
TLB	Joshua	24	14	“ So revere Jehovah and serve him in sincerity and truth . Put away forever the idols your ancestors worshiped when they lived beyond the Euphrates River and in Egypt . Worship the Lord alone .
TLB	Joshua	24	15	But if you are unwilling to obey the Lord , then decide today whom you will obey . Will it be the gods of your ancestors beyond the Euphrates or the gods of the Amorites here in this land ? But as for me and my family , we will serve the Lord. ”
TLB	Joshua	24	16	And the people replied , “ We would never forsake the Lord and worship other gods !
TLB	Joshua	24	17	For the Lord our God is the one who rescued our fathers from their slavery in the land of Egypt . He is the God who did mighty miracles before the eyes of Israel , as we traveled through the wilderness , and preserved us from our enemies when we passed through their land .
TLB	Joshua	24	18	It was the Lord who drove out the Amorites and the other nations living here in the land . Yes , we choose the Lord , for he alone is our God. ”
TLB	Joshua	24	19	But Joshua replied to the people , “ You can ’ t worship the Lord God , for he is holy and jealous ; he will not forgive your rebellion and sins .
TLB	Joshua	24	20	If you forsake him and worship other gods , he will turn upon you and destroy you , even though he has taken care of you for such a long time. ”
TLB	Joshua	24	21	But the people answered , “ We choose the Lord ! ”
TLB	Joshua	24	22	“ You have heard yourselves say it , ” Joshua said . “ You have chosen to obey the Lord. ” “ Yes , ” they replied , “ we are witnesses. ”
TLB	Joshua	24	23	“ All right , ” he said , “ then you must destroy all the idols you now own , and you must obey the Lord God of Israel. ”
TLB	Joshua	24	25	So Joshua made a covenant with them that day at Shechem , committing them to a permanent and binding contract between themselves and God .
TLB	Joshua	24	26	Joshua recorded the people ’ s reply in the book of the laws of God and took a huge stone as a reminder and rolled it beneath the oak tree that was beside the Tabernacle .
TLB	Joshua	24	27	Then Joshua said to all the people , “ This stone has heard everything the Lord said , so it will be a witness to testify against you if you go back on your word. ”
TLB	Joshua	24	28	Then Joshua sent the people away to their own sections of the country .
TLB	Joshua	24	29	Soon after this he died at the age of
TLB	Joshua	24	110	.
TLB	Joshua	24	30	He was buried on his own estate at Timnath-serah , in the hill country of Ephraim , on the north side of the mountains of Gaash .
TLB	Joshua	24	31	Israel obeyed the Lord throughout the lifetimes of Joshua and the other old men who had personally witnessed the amazing deeds the Lord had done for Israel .
TLB	Joshua	24	32	The bones of Joseph , which the people of Israel had brought along when they left Egypt , were buried in Shechem , in the parcel of ground Jacob had bought [ a ] from the sons of Hamor . ( The land was located in the territory assigned to the tribes of Joseph . )
TLB	Joshua	24	33	Eleazar , the son of Aaron , also died ; he was buried in the hill country of Ephraim , at Gibeah , the city that had been given to his son Phinehas . Footnotes - Joshua 24:32 had bought , literally , “ had bought for

TLB	Judges	1	1	After Joshua died , the nation of Israel went to the Lord to receive his instructions . “ Which of our tribes should be the first to go to war against the Canaanites ? ” they inquired .
TLB	Judges	1	2	God ’ s answer came , “ Judah . And I will give them a great victory. ”
TLB	Judges	1	3	The leaders of the tribe of Judah , however , asked help from the tribe of Simeon . “ Join us in clearing out the people living in the territory allotted to us , ” they said , “ and then we will help you conquer yours. ” So the army of Simeon went with the army of Judah . 4-6 And the Lord helped them defeat the Canaanites and Perizzites , so that ten thousand of the enemy were slain at Bezek . King Adoni-bezek escaped , but the Israeli army soon captured him and cut off his thumbs and big toes .
TLB	Judges	1	7	“ I have treated seventy kings in this same manner and have fed them the scraps under my table ! ” King Adoni-bezek said . “ Now God has paid me back. ” He was taken to Jerusalem and died there .
TLB	Judges	1	8	( Judah had conquered Jerusalem and massacred its people , setting the city on fire . )
TLB	Judges	1	9	Afterward the army of Judah fought the Canaanites in the hill country and in the Negeb , as well as on the coastal plains .
TLB	Judges	1	10	Then Judah marched against the Canaanites in Hebron ( formerly called Kiriath-arba ) , destroying the cities of Sheshai , Ahiman , and Talmai .
TLB	Judges	1	11	Later they attacked the city of Debir ( formerly called Kiriath-sepher ) .
TLB	Judges	1	12	“ Who will lead the attack against Debir ? ” Caleb challenged them . “ Whoever conquers it shall have my daughter Achsah as his wife ! ”
TLB	Judges	1	13	Caleb ’ s nephew , Othniel , son of his younger brother Kenaz , volunteered to lead the attack ; and he conquered the city and won Achsah as his bride .
TLB	Judges	1	14	As they were leaving for their new home , [ a ] she urged him to ask her father for an additional piece of land . She dismounted from her donkey to speak to Caleb about it . “ What do you wish ? ” he asked .
TLB	Judges	1	15	And she replied , “ You have been kind enough to give me land in the Negeb , but please give us springs of water too. ” So Caleb gave her the upper and lower springs .
TLB	Judges	1	16	When the tribe of Judah moved into its new land in the Negeb Desert south of Arad , the descendants of Moses ’ father-in-law—members of the Kenite tribe—accompanied them . They left their homes in Jericho , “ The City of Palm Trees , ” and the two tribes lived together after that .
TLB	Judges	1	17	Afterwards the army of Judah joined Simeon ’ s , and they fought the Canaanites at the city of Zephath and massacred all its people . So now the city is named Hormah ( meaning , “ massacred ” ) .
TLB	Judges	1	18	The army of Judah also conquered the cities of Gaza , Ashkelon , and Ekron , with their surrounding villages .
TLB	Judges	1	19	The Lord helped the tribe of Judah exterminate the people of the hill country , though they failed in their attempt to conquer the people of the valley , who had iron chariots .
TLB	Judges	1	20	The city of Hebron was given to Caleb as the Lord had promised ; so Caleb drove out the inhabitants of the city ; they were descendants of the three sons of Anak .
TLB	Judges	1	21	The tribe of Benjamin failed to exterminate the Jebusites living in their part of the city of Jerusalem , so they still live there today , mingled with the Israelis . 22-23 As for the tribe of Joseph , they attacked the city of Bethel , formerly known as Luz , and the Lord was with them . First they sent scouts ,
TLB	Judges	1	24	who captured a man coming out of the city . They offered to spare his life and that of his family if he would show them the entrance passage through the wall . [ b ]
TLB	Judges	1	25	So he showed them how to get in , and they massacred the entire population except for this man and his family .
TLB	Judges	1	26	Later the man moved to Syria and founded a city there , naming it Luz , too , as it is still known today .
TLB	Judges	1	27	The tribe of Manasseh failed to drive out the people living in Beth-shean , Taanach , Dor , Ibleam , Megiddo , with their surrounding towns ; so the Canaanites stayed there .
TLB	Judges	1	28	In later years when the Israelis were stronger , they put the Canaanites to work as slaves , but never did force them to leave the country .
TLB	Judges	1	29	This was also true of the Canaanites living in Gezer ; they still live among the tribe of Ephraim .
TLB	Judges	1	30	And the tribe of Zebulun did not massacre the people of Kitron or Nahalol , but made them their slaves ; 31-32 nor did the tribe of Asher drive out the residents of Acco , Sidon , Ahlab , Achzib , Helbah , Aphik , or Rehob ; so the Israelis still live among the Canaanites , who were the original people of that land .
TLB	Judges	1	33	And the tribe of Naphtali did not drive out the people of Beth-shemesh or of Beth-anath , so these people continue to live among them as servants .
TLB	Judges	1	34	As for the tribe of Dan , the Amorites forced them into the hill country and wouldn ’ t let them come down into the valley ;
TLB	Judges	1	35	but when the Amorites later spread into Mount Heres , Aijalon , and Shaalbim , the tribe of Joseph conquered them and made them their slaves .
TLB	Judges	1	36	The boundary of the Amorites begins at the ascent of Scorpion Pass , runs to a spot called The Rock , and continues upward from there . Footnotes - Judges 1:14 As they were leaving for their new home , literally , “ When she came to him. ” for an additional , implied . - Judges 1:24 the entrance passage through the wall , literally , “ the way into the city. ” Obviously , this does not mean via the city gates .

TLB	Judges	2	2	if you , on your part , would make no peace treaties with the people living in this land ; I told you to destroy their heathen altars . Why have you not obeyed ?
TLB	Judges	2	3	And now since you have broken the contract , it is no longer in effect , and I no longer promise to destroy the nations living in your land ; rather , they shall be thorns in your sides , and their gods will be a constant temptation to you. ”
TLB	Judges	2	4	The people broke into tears as the Angel finished speaking ;
TLB	Judges	2	5	so the name of that place was called “ Bochim ” ( meaning , “ the place where people wept ” ) . Then they offered sacrifices to the Lord .
TLB	Judges	2	6	When Joshua finally disbanded the armies of Israel , the tribes moved into their new territories and took possession of the land . 7-9 Joshua , the man of God , died at the age of
TLB	Judges	2	110	and was buried at the edge of his property in Timnath-heres , in the hill country of Ephraim , north of Mount Gaash . The people had remained true to the Lord throughout Joshua ’ s lifetime , and as long afterward as the old men of his generation were still living—those who had seen the mighty miracles the Lord had done for Israel .
TLB	Judges	2	10	But finally all that generation died ; and the next generation did not worship Jehovah as their God and did not care about the mighty miracles he had done for Israel .
TLB	Judges	2	11	They did many things that the Lord had expressly forbidden , including the worshiping of heathen gods . 12-14 They abandoned Jehovah , the God loved and worshiped by their ancestors—the God who had brought them out of Egypt . Instead , they were worshiping and bowing low before the idols of the neighboring nations . So the anger of the Lord flamed out against all Israel . He left them to the mercy of their enemies , for they had departed from Jehovah and were worshiping Baal and the Ashtaroth idols .
TLB	Judges	2	15	So now when the nation of Israel went out to battle against its enemies , the Lord blocked their path . He had warned them about this , and in fact had vowed that he would do it . But when the people were in this terrible plight ,
TLB	Judges	2	16	the Lord raised up judges to save them from their enemies .
TLB	Judges	2	17	Yet even then Israel would not listen to the judges , but broke faith with Jehovah by worshiping other gods instead . How quickly they turned away from the true faith of their ancestors , for they refused to obey God ’ s commands .
TLB	Judges	2	18	Each judge rescued the people of Israel from their enemies throughout his lifetime , for the Lord was moved to pity by the groaning of his people under their crushing oppressions ; so he helped them as long as that judge lived .
TLB	Judges	2	19	But when the judge died , the people turned from doing right and behaved even worse than their ancestors had . They prayed to heathen gods again , throwing themselves to the ground in humble worship . They stubbornly returned to the evil customs of the nations around them .
TLB	Judges	2	20	Then the anger of the Lord would flame out against Israel again . He declared , “ Because these people have violated the treaty I made with their ancestors ,
TLB	Judges	2	21	I will no longer drive out the nations left unconquered by Joshua when he died .
TLB	Judges	2	22	Instead , I will use these nations to test my people , to see whether or not they will obey the Lord as their ancestors did. ”
TLB	Judges	2	23	So the Lord left those nations in the land and did not drive them out , nor let Israel destroy them . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Judges	3	3	1-3 Here is a list of the nations the Lord left in the land to test the new generation of Israel who had not experienced the wars of Canaan . For God wanted to give opportunity to the youth of Israel to exercise faith and obedience [ a ] in conquering their enemies : the Philistines ( five cities ) , the Canaanites , the Sidonians , the Hivites living in Mount Lebanon , from Baal-hermon to the entrance of Hamath .
TLB	Judges	3	4	These people were a test to the new generation of Israel , to see whether they would obey the commandments the Lord had given to them through Moses .
TLB	Judges	3	5	So Israel lived among the Canaanites , Hittites , Hivites , Perizzites , Amorites , and Jebusites .
TLB	Judges	3	6	But instead of destroying them , the people of Israel intermarried with them . The young men of Israel took their girls as wives , and the Israeli girls married their men . And soon Israel was worshiping their gods .
TLB	Judges	3	7	So the people of Israel were very evil in God ’ s sight , for they turned against Jehovah their God and worshiped Baal and the Asheroth idols .
TLB	Judges	3	8	Then the anger of the Lord flamed out against Israel , and he let King Cushan-rishathaim of eastern Syria conquer them . They were under his rule for eight years .
TLB	Judges	3	9	But when Israel cried out to the Lord , he gave them Caleb ’ s nephew , Othniel ( son of Kenaz , Caleb ’ s younger brother ) to save them .
TLB	Judges	3	10	The Spirit of the Lord took control of him , and he reformed and purged Israel so that when he led the forces of Israel against the army of King Cushan-rishathaim , the Lord helped Israel conquer him completely .
TLB	Judges	3	11	Then , for forty years under Othniel , there was peace in the land . But when Othniel died ,
TLB	Judges	3	12	the people of Israel turned once again to their sinful ways , so God helped King Eglon of Moab to conquer part of Israel at that time .
TLB	Judges	3	13	Allied with him were the armies of the Ammonites and the Amalekites . These forces defeated the Israelis and took possession of Jericho , often called “ The City of Palm Trees. ”
TLB	Judges	3	14	For the next eighteen years the people of Israel were required to pay crushing taxes to King Eglon .
TLB	Judges	3	15	But when they cried to the Lord , he sent them a savior , Ehud ( son of Gera , a Benjaminite ) , who was left-handed . Ehud was the man chosen to carry Israel ’ s annual tax money to the Moabite capital .
TLB	Judges	3	16	Before he went on this journey , he made himself a double-edged dagger eighteen inches long and hid it in his clothing , strapped against his right thigh . 17-19 After delivering the money to King Eglon ( who , by the way , was very fat ! ) , he started home again . But outside the city , at the quarries of Gilgal , he sent his companions on and returned alone to the king . “ I have a secret message for you , ” he told him . The king immediately dismissed all those who were with him so that he could have a private interview .
TLB	Judges	3	20	Ehud walked over to him as he was sitting in a cool upstairs room and said to him , “ It is a message from God ! ” King Eglon stood up at once to receive it ,
TLB	Judges	3	21	whereupon Ehud reached beneath his robe with his strong left hand , pulled out the double-bladed dagger strapped against his right thigh , and plunged it deep into the king ’ s belly . 22-23 The hilt of the dagger disappeared beneath the flesh , and the fat closed over it as the entrails oozed out . Leaving the dagger there , Ehud locked the doors behind him and escaped across an upstairs porch .
TLB	Judges	3	24	When the king ’ s servants returned and saw that the doors were locked , they waited , thinking that perhaps he was using the bathroom .
TLB	Judges	3	25	But when , after a long time , he still didn ’ t come out , they became concerned and got a key . And when they opened the door , they found their master dead on the floor .
TLB	Judges	3	26	Meanwhile Ehud had escaped past the quarries to Seirah .
TLB	Judges	3	27	When he arrived in the hill country of Ephraim , he blew a trumpet as a call to arms and mustered an army under his own command .
TLB	Judges	3	28	“ Follow me , ” he told them , “ for the Lord has put your enemies , the Moabites , at your mercy ! ” The army then proceeded to seize the fords of the Jordan River near Moab , preventing anyone from crossing .
TLB	Judges	3	29	Then they attacked the Moabites and killed about ten thousand of the strongest and most skillful of their fighting men , letting not one escape .
TLB	Judges	3	30	So Moab was conquered by Israel that day , and the land was at peace for the next eighty years .
TLB	Judges	3	31	The next judge after Ehud was Shamgar ( son of Anath ) . He once killed six hundred Philistines with an ox goad , thereby saving Israel from disaster .

TLB	Judges	4	4	Israel ’ s leader at that time , the one who was responsible for bringing the people back to God , was Deborah , a prophetess , the wife of Lappidoth .
TLB	Judges	4	5	She held court at a place now called “ Deborah ’ s Palm Tree , ” between Ramah and Bethel , in the hill country of Ephraim ; and the Israelites came to her to decide their disputes . [ a ]
TLB	Judges	4	6	One day she summoned Barak ( son of Abinoam ) , who lived in Kedesh , in the land of Naphtali , and said to him , “ The Lord God of Israel has commanded you to mobilize ten thousand men from the tribes of Naphtali and Zebulun . Lead them to Mount Tabor
TLB	Judges	4	7	to fight King Jabin ’ s mighty army with all his chariots , under General Sisera ’ s command . The Lord says , ‘ I will draw them to the Kishon River , and you will defeat them there. ’ ”
TLB	Judges	4	8	“ I ’ ll go , but only if you go with me ! ” Barak told her .
TLB	Judges	4	9	“ All right , ” she replied , “ I ’ ll go with you ; but I ’ m warning you now that the honor of conquering Sisera will go to a woman instead of to you ! ” So she went with him to Kedesh .
TLB	Judges	4	10	When Barak summoned the men of Zebulun and Naphtali to mobilize at Kedesh , ten thousand men volunteered . And Deborah marched with them .
TLB	Judges	4	11	( Heber , the Kenite—the Kenites were the descendants of Moses ’ father-in-law Hobab—had moved away from the rest of his clan , and had been living in various places as far away as the Oak of Zaanannim , near Kedesh . )
TLB	Judges	4	12	When General Sisera was told that Barak and his army were camped at Mount Tabor ,
TLB	Judges	4	13	he mobilized his entire army , including the nine hundred iron chariots , and marched from Harosheth-hagoiim to the Kishon River .
TLB	Judges	4	14	Then Deborah said to Barak , “ Now is the time for action ! The Lord leads on ! He has already delivered Sisera into your hand ! ” So Barak led his ten thousand men down the slopes of Mount Tabor into battle .
TLB	Judges	4	15	Then the Lord threw the enemy into a panic , both the soldiers and the charioteers , and Sisera leaped from his chariot and escaped on foot .
TLB	Judges	4	16	Barak and his men chased the enemy and the chariots as far as Harosheth-hagoiim , until all of Sisera ’ s army was destroyed ; not one man was left alive .
TLB	Judges	4	17	Meanwhile , Sisera had escaped to the tent of Jael , the wife of Heber the Kenite , for there was a mutual-assistance agreement between King Jabin of Hazor and the clan of Heber .
TLB	Judges	4	18	Jael went out to meet Sisera and said to him , “ Come into my tent , sir . You will be safe here in our protection . Don ’ t be afraid. ” So he went into her tent , and she covered him with a blanket .
TLB	Judges	4	19	“ Please give me some water , ” he said , “ for I am very thirsty. ” So she gave him some milk and covered him again .
TLB	Judges	4	20	“ Stand in the door of the tent , ” he told her , “ and if anyone comes by , looking for me , tell them that no one is here. ”
TLB	Judges	4	21	Then Jael took a sharp tent peg and a hammer and , quietly creeping up to him as he slept , she drove the peg through his temples and into the ground ; and so he died , for he was fast asleep from weariness .
TLB	Judges	4	22	When Barak came by looking for Sisera , Jael went out to meet him and said , “ Come , and I will show you the man you are looking for. ” So he followed her into the tent and found Sisera lying there dead , with the tent peg through his temples .
TLB	Judges	4	23	So that day the Lord used Israel to subdue King Jabin of Canaan .
TLB	Judges	4	24	And from that time on Israel became stronger and stronger against King Jabin , until he and all his people were destroyed . Footnotes - Judges 4:5 to decide their disputes , or “ to listen to her speak to them about God. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Judges	5	3	Listen , O you kings and princes , For I shall sing about the Lord , The God of Israel .
TLB	Judges	5	4	When you led us out from Seir , Out across the fields of Edom , The earth trembled And the sky poured down its rain .
TLB	Judges	5	6	In the days of Shamgar and of Jael , The main roads were deserted . Travelers used the narrow , crooked side paths .
TLB	Judges	5	7	Israel ’ s population dwindled , Until Deborah became a mother to Israel .
TLB	Judges	5	8	When Israel chose new gods , Everything collapsed . Our masters would not let us have A shield or spear . Among forty thousand men of Israel , Not a weapon could be found !
TLB	Judges	5	9	How I rejoice In the leaders of Israel Who offered themselves so willingly ! Praise the Lord !
TLB	Judges	5	10	Let all Israel , rich and poor , Join in his praises— Those who ride on white donkeys And sit on rich carpets , And those who are poor and must walk .
TLB	Judges	5	11	The village musicians Gather at the village well To sing of the triumphs of the Lord . Again and again they sing the ballad Of how the Lord saved Israel With an army of peasants ! The people of the Lord Marched through the gates !
TLB	Judges	5	12	Awake , O Deborah , and sing ! Arise , O Barak ! O son of Abinoam , lead away your captives ! 13-14 Down from Mount Tabor marched the noble remnant . The people of the Lord Marched down against great odds . They came from Ephraim and Benjamin , From Machir and from Zebulun .
TLB	Judges	5	15	Down into the valley Went the princes of Issachar With Deborah and Barak . At God ’ s command they rushed into the valley . ( But the tribe of Reuben didn ’ t go .
TLB	Judges	5	16	Why did you sit at home among the sheepfolds , Playing your shepherd pipes ? Yes , the tribe of Reuben has an uneasy conscience .
TLB	Judges	5	17	Why did Gilead remain across the Jordan , And why did Dan remain with his ships ? And why did Asher sit unmoved Upon the seashore , At ease beside his harbors ? )

TLB	Judges	6	6	Then the people of Israel began once again to worship other gods , and once again the Lord let their enemies harass them . This time it was by the people of Midian , for seven years .
TLB	Judges	6	2	The Midianites were so cruel that the Israelis took to the mountains , living in caves and dens . 3-4 When they planted their seed , marauders from Midian , Amalek , and other neighboring nations came and destroyed their crops and plundered the countryside as far away as Gaza , leaving nothing to eat and taking away all their sheep , oxen , and donkeys .
TLB	Judges	6	5	These enemy hordes arrived on droves of camels too numerous to count and stayed until the land was completely stripped and devastated . 6-7 So Israel was reduced to abject poverty because of the Midianites . Then at last the people of Israel began to cry out to the Lord for help .
TLB	Judges	6	8	However , the Lord ’ s reply through the prophet he sent to them was this : “ The Lord God of Israel brought you out of slavery in Egypt ,
TLB	Judges	6	9	and rescued you from the Egyptians and from all who were cruel to you , and drove out your enemies before you , and gave you their land .
TLB	Judges	6	10	He told you he is the Lord your God , and you must not worship the gods of the Amorites who live around you on every side . But you have not listened to him. ”
TLB	Judges	6	11	But one day the Angel of the Lord came and sat beneath the oak tree at Ophrah , on the farm of Joash the Abiezrite . Joash ’ s son , Gideon , had been threshing wheat by hand in the bottom of a grape press—a pit where grapes were pressed to make wine—for he was hiding from the Midianites .
TLB	Judges	6	12	The Angel of the Lord appeared to him and said , “ Mighty soldier , the Lord is with you ! ”
TLB	Judges	6	13	) will now do it again , rescuing Israel from Midian . - Judges 6:32 Let Baal take care of himself , literally , “ Let Baal bring charges , ” or used mockingly , “ Let Baal be honored ! ” The Living Bible copyright ©
TLB	Judges	6	14	Then the Lord turned to him and said , “ I will make you strong ! Go and save Israel from the Midianites ! I am sending you ! ”
TLB	Judges	6	15	But Gideon replied , “ Sir , how can I save Israel ? My family is the poorest in the whole tribe of Manasseh , and I am the least thought of in the entire family ! ”
TLB	Judges	6	16	Whereupon the Lord said to him , “ But I , Jehovah , [ a ] will be with you ! And you shall quickly destroy the Midianite hordes ! ”
TLB	Judges	6	17	Gideon replied , “ If it is really true that you are going to help me like that , then do some miracle to prove it ! Prove that it is really Jehovah who is talking to me !
TLB	Judges	6	18	But stay here until I go and get a present for you. ” “ All right , ” the Angel agreed . “ I ’ ll stay here until you return. ”
TLB	Judges	6	19	Gideon hurried home and roasted a young goat and baked some unleavened bread from a bushel of flour . Then , carrying the meat in a basket and broth in a pot , he took it out to the Angel , who was beneath the oak tree , and presented it to him .
TLB	Judges	6	20	The Angel said to him , “ Place the meat and the bread upon that rock over there , and pour the broth over it. ” When Gideon had followed these instructions ,
TLB	Judges	6	21	the Angel touched the meat and bread with his staff , and fire flamed up from the rock and consumed them ! And suddenly the Angel was gone !
TLB	Judges	6	22	When Gideon realized that it had indeed been the Angel of the Lord , he cried out , “ Alas , O Lord God , for I have seen the Angel of the Lord face-to-face ! ”
TLB	Judges	6	23	“ It ’ s all right , ” the Lord replied . “ Don ’ t be afraid ! You shall not die. ”
TLB	Judges	6	24	And Gideon built an altar there and named it “ The Altar of Peace with Jehovah. ” ( The altar is still there in Ophrah in the land of the Abiezrites . )
TLB	Judges	6	25	That night the Lord told Gideon to hitch his father ’ s best ox to the family altar of Baal and pull it down , and to cut down the wooden idol of the goddess Asherah that stood nearby .
TLB	Judges	6	26	“ Replace it with an altar for the Lord your God , built here on this hill , laying the stones carefully . Then sacrifice the ox as a burnt offering to the Lord , using the wooden idol as wood for the fire on the altar. ”
TLB	Judges	6	27	So Gideon took ten of his servants and did as the Lord had commanded . But he did it at night for fear of the other members of his father ’ s household , and for fear of the men of the city ; for he knew what would happen if they found out who did it !
TLB	Judges	6	28	Early the next morning , as the city began to stir , someone discovered that the altar of Baal was knocked apart , the idol beside it was gone , and a new altar had been built instead , with the remains of a sacrifice on it .
TLB	Judges	6	29	“ Who did this ? ” everyone demanded . Finally they learned that it was Gideon , the son of Joash .
TLB	Judges	6	30	“ Bring out your son , ” they shouted to Joash . “ He must die for insulting the altar of Baal and for cutting down the Asherah idol. ”
TLB	Judges	6	31	But Joash retorted to the whole mob , “ Does Baal need your help ? What an insult to a god ! You are the ones who should die for insulting Baal ! If Baal is really a god , let him take care of himself and destroy the one who broke apart his altar ! ”
TLB	Judges	6	32	From then on Gideon was called “ Jerubbaal , ” a nickname meaning “ Let Baal take care of himself ! ” [ b ]
TLB	Judges	6	33	Soon afterward the armies of Midian , Amalek , and other neighboring nations united in one vast alliance against Israel . They crossed the Jordan and camped in the valley of Jezreel .
TLB	Judges	6	34	Then the Spirit of the Lord came upon Gideon , and he blew a trumpet as a call to arms , and the men of Abiezer came to him .
TLB	Judges	6	35	He also sent messengers throughout Manasseh , Asher , Zebulun , and Naphtali , summoning their fighting forces , and all of them responded .
TLB	Judges	6	36	Then Gideon said to God , “ If you are really going to use me to save Israel as you promised ,
TLB	Judges	6	37	prove it to me in this way : I ’ ll put some wool on the threshing floor tonight , and if , in the morning , the fleece is wet and the ground is dry , I will know you are going to help me ! ”
TLB	Judges	6	38	And it happened just that way ! When he got up the next morning , he pressed the fleece together and wrung out a whole bowlful of water !
TLB	Judges	6	39	Then Gideon said to the Lord , “ Please don ’ t be angry with me , but let me make one more test : this time let the fleece remain dry while the ground around it is wet ! ”
TLB	Judges	6	40	So the Lord did as he asked ; that night the fleece stayed dry , but the ground was covered with dew ! Footnotes - Judges 6:16 But I , Jehovah , literally , “ I Am will be with you. ” The same name is used here as in Exodus 3:14 .

TLB	Judges	7	7	“ I ’ ll conquer the Midianites with these three hundred ! ” the Lord told Gideon . “ Send all the others home ! ” 8-9 So after Gideon had collected all the clay jars and trumpets they had among them , he sent them home , leaving only three hundred men with him . During the night , with the Midianites camped in the valley just below , the Lord said to Gideon , “ Get up ! Take your troops and attack the Midianites , for I will cause you to defeat them !
TLB	Judges	7	2	will be those who kneel , with their mouths in the stream. ” Only three hundred of the men drank from their hands ; all the others drank with their mouths to the stream .
TLB	Judges	7	3	Send home any of your men who are timid and frightened. ” So twenty-two thousand of them left , and only ten thousand remained who were willing to fight .
TLB	Judges	7	4	But the Lord told Gideon , “ There are still too many ! Bring them down to the spring and I ’ ll show you which ones shall go with you and which ones shall not. ” 5-6 So Gideon assembled them at the water . There the Lord told him , “ Divide them into two groups decided by the way they drink . In Group
TLB	Judges	7	1	will be all the men who cup the water in their hands to get it to their mouths and lap it like dogs . In Group
TLB	Judges	7	10	But if you are afraid , first go down to the camp alone—take along your servant Purah if you like—
TLB	Judges	7	11	and listen to what they are saying down there ! You will be greatly encouraged and be eager to attack ! ” So he took Purah and crept down through the darkness to the outposts of the enemy camp . 12-13 The vast armies of Midian , Amalek , and the other nations of the Mideast were crowded across the valley like locusts—yes , like the sand upon the seashore—and there were too many camels even to count ! Gideon crept up to one of the tents just as a man inside had wakened from a nightmare and was telling his tent-mate about it . “ I had this strange dream , ” he was saying , “ and there was this huge loaf of barley bread that came tumbling down into our camp . It hit our tent and knocked it flat ! ”
TLB	Judges	7	14	The other soldier replied , “ Your dream can mean only one thing ! Gideon , the son of Joash , the Israeli , is going to come and massacre all the allied forces of Midian ! ”
TLB	Judges	7	15	When Gideon heard the dream and the interpretation , all he could do was just stand there worshiping God ! Then he returned to his men and shouted , “ Get up ! For the Lord is going to use you to conquer all the vast armies of Midian ! ”
TLB	Judges	7	16	He divided the three hundred men into three groups and gave each man a trumpet and a clay jar with a torch in it .
TLB	Judges	7	17	Then he explained his plan . “ When we arrive at the outer guardposts of the camp , ” he told them , “ do just as I do .
TLB	Judges	7	18	As soon as I and the men in my group blow our trumpets , you blow yours on all sides of the camp and shout , ‘ We fight for God and for Gideon ! ’ ” 19-20 It was just after midnight and the change of guards when Gideon and the hundred men with him crept to the outer edge of the camp of Midian . Suddenly they blew their trumpets and broke their clay jars so that their torches blazed into the night . Then the other two hundred of his men did the same , blowing the trumpets in their right hands , and holding the flaming torches in their left hands , all shouting , “ For the Lord and for Gideon ! ” [ a ]
TLB	Judges	7	21	Then they just stood and watched as the whole vast enemy army began rushing around in a panic , shouting and running away .
TLB	Judges	7	22	For in the confusion the Lord caused the enemy troops to begin fighting and killing each other from one end of the camp to the other , and they fled into the night to places as far away as Beth-shittah near Zererah , and to the border of Abel-meholah near Tabbath .
TLB	Judges	7	23	Then Gideon sent for the troops of Naphtali , Asher , and Manasseh and told them to come and chase and destroy the fleeing army of Midian .
TLB	Judges	7	24	Gideon also sent messengers throughout the hill country of Ephraim summoning troops who seized the fords of the Jordan River at Beth-barah , thus preventing the Midianites from escaping by going across .
TLB	Judges	7	25	Oreb and Zeeb , the two generals of Midian , were captured . Oreb was killed at the rock now known by his name , and Zeeb at the winepress of Zeeb , as it is now called ; and the Israelis took the heads of Oreb and Zeeb across the Jordan to Gideon .

TLB	Judges	8	8	Then he went up to Penuel and asked for food there , but got the same answer .
TLB	Judges	8	4	Gideon now crossed the Jordan River with his three hundred men . They were very tired , but still chasing the enemy .
TLB	Judges	8	5	He asked the men of Succoth for food . “ We are weary from chasing after Zebah and Zalmunna , the kings of Midian , ” he said .
TLB	Judges	8	6	But the leaders of Succoth replied , “ You haven ’ t caught them yet ! [ b ] If we feed you and you fail , they ’ ll return and destroy us. ”
TLB	Judges	8	7	Then Gideon warned them , “ When the Lord has delivered them to us , I will return and tear your flesh with the thorns and briars of the wilderness. ”
TLB	Judges	8	9	And he said to them also , “ When this is all over , I will return and break down this tower. ”
TLB	Judges	8	10	By this time King Zebah and King Zalmunna with a remnant of fifteen thousand troops were in Karkor . That was all that was left of the allied armies of the east ; for one hundred twenty thousand had already been killed .
TLB	Judges	8	11	Then Gideon circled around by the caravan route east of Nobah and Jogbehah , striking at the Midianite army in surprise raids .
TLB	Judges	8	12	The two kings fled , but Gideon chased and captured them , routing their entire force .
TLB	Judges	8	13	Later , Gideon returned by way of Heres Pass .
TLB	Judges	8	14	There he captured a young fellow from Succoth and demanded that he write down the names of all the seventy-seven political and religious leaders of the city .
TLB	Judges	8	15	He then returned to Succoth . “ You taunted me that I would never catch King Zebah and King Zalmunna , and you refused to give us food when we were tired and hungry , ” he said . “ Well , here they are ! ”
TLB	Judges	8	16	Then he took the leaders of the city and scraped them to death [ c ] with wild thorns and briars .
TLB	Judges	8	17	He also went to Penuel and knocked down the city tower and killed the entire male population .
TLB	Judges	8	18	Then Gideon asked King Zebah and King Zalmunna , “ The men you killed at Tabor—what were they like ? ” They replied , “ They were dressed just like you—like sons of kings ! ”
TLB	Judges	8	19	“ They must have been my brothers ! ” Gideon exclaimed . “ I swear that if you hadn ’ t killed them I wouldn ’ t kill you. ”
TLB	Judges	8	20	Then , turning to Jether , his oldest son , he instructed him to kill them . But the boy was only a lad and was afraid to .
TLB	Judges	8	21	Then Zebah and Zalmunna said to Gideon , “ You do it ; we ’ d rather be killed by a man ! ” [ d ] So Gideon killed them and took the ornaments from their camels ’ necks .
TLB	Judges	8	22	Now the men of Israel said to Gideon , “ Be our king ! You and your sons and all your descendants shall be our rulers , for you have saved us from Midian. ” 23-24 But Gideon replied , “ I will not be your king , nor shall my son ; the Lord is your King ! However , I have one request . Give me all the earrings collected from your fallen foes ” —for the troops of Midian , being Ishmaelites , all wore gold earrings .
TLB	Judges	8	25	“ Gladly ! ” they replied , and spread out a sheet for everyone to throw in the gold earrings he had gathered .
TLB	Judges	8	26	Their value was estimated at $ 25,000 , not including the crescents and pendants , or the royal clothing of the kings , or the chains around the camels ’ necks .
TLB	Judges	8	27	Gideon made an ephod [ e ] from the gold and put it in Ophrah , his hometown . But all Israel soon began worshiping it , so it became an evil deed that Gideon and his family did .
TLB	Judges	8	28	That is the true account of how Midian was subdued by Israel . Midian never recovered , and the land was at peace for forty years—all during Gideon ’ s lifetime .
TLB	Judges	8	29	He returned home
TLB	Judges	8	30	and eventually had seventy sons , for he married many wives .
TLB	Judges	8	31	He also had a concubine in Shechem , who presented him with a son named Abimelech .
TLB	Judges	8	32	Gideon finally died , an old , old man , and was buried in the sepulcher of his father , Joash , in Ophrah , in the land of the Abiezrites .
TLB	Judges	8	33	But as soon as Gideon was dead , the Israelis began to worship the idols Baal and Baal-berith .
TLB	Judges	8	34	They no longer considered the Lord as their God , though he had rescued them from all their enemies on every side .
TLB	Judges	8	35	Nor did they show any kindness to the family of Gideon despite all he had done for them .

TLB	Judges	9	9	but it refused . “ ‘ Should I quit producing the olive oil that blesses God and man , just to wave to and fro over the other trees ? ’ it asked .
TLB	Judges	9	2	“ Go and talk to the leaders of Shechem , ” he requested , “ and ask them whether they want to be ruled by seventy kings—Gideon ’ s seventy sons—or by one man—meaning me , your own flesh and blood ! ” [ a ]
TLB	Judges	9	3	So his uncles went to the leaders of the city and proposed Abimelech ’ s scheme ; and they decided that since his mother was a native of their town they would go along with it .
TLB	Judges	9	4	They gave him money from the temple offerings of the idol Baal-berith , which he used to hire some worthless loafers who agreed to do whatever he told them to .
TLB	Judges	9	5	He took them to his father ’ s home at Ophrah and there , upon one stone , they slaughtered all seventy of his half brothers , except for the youngest , Jotham , who escaped and hid .
TLB	Judges	9	6	Then the citizens of Shechem and Beth-millo called a meeting under the oak beside the garrison at Shechem , and Abimelech was acclaimed king of Israel .
TLB	Judges	9	7	When Jotham heard about this , he stood at the top of Mount Gerizim and shouted across to the men of Shechem , “ If you want God ’ s blessing , listen to me !
TLB	Judges	9	8	Once upon a time the trees decided to elect a king . First they asked the olive tree ,
TLB	Judges	9	10	“ Then they said to the fig tree , ‘ You be our king ! ’
TLB	Judges	9	11	“ But the fig tree also refused . ‘ Should I quit producing sweetness and fruit just to lift my head above all the other trees ? ’ it asked .
TLB	Judges	9	12	“ Then they said to the grapevine , ‘ You reign over us ! ’
TLB	Judges	9	13	“ But the grapevine replied , ‘ Shall I quit producing the wine that cheers both God and man , just to be mightier than all the other trees ? ’
TLB	Judges	9	14	“ Then all the trees finally turned to the thorn bush . ‘ You be our king ! ’ they exclaimed .
TLB	Judges	9	15	“ And the thorn bush replied , ‘ If you really want me , come and humble yourselves beneath my shade ! If you refuse , let fire flame forth from me and burn down the great cedars of Lebanon ! ’
TLB	Judges	9	16	“ Now make sure that you have done the right thing in making Abimelech your king , that you have done right by Gideon and all of his descendants .
TLB	Judges	9	17	For my father fought for you and risked his life and delivered you from the Midianites ,
TLB	Judges	9	18	yet you have revolted against him and killed his seventy sons upon one stone . And now you have chosen his slave girl ’ s son , Abimelech , to be your king just because he is your relative .
TLB	Judges	9	19	If you are sure that you have done right by Gideon and his descendants , then may you and Abimelech have a long and happy life together .
TLB	Judges	9	20	But if you have not been fair to Gideon , then may Abimelech destroy the citizens of Shechem and Beth-millo ; and may they destroy Abimelech ! ”
TLB	Judges	9	21	Then Jotham escaped and lived in Beer for fear of his brother , Abimelech . 22-23 Three years later God stirred up trouble between King Abimelech and the citizens of Shechem , and they revolted .
TLB	Judges	9	24	In the events that followed , both Abimelech and the citizens of Shechem who aided him in butchering Gideon ’ s seventy sons were given their just punishment for these murders .
TLB	Judges	9	25	For the men of Shechem set an ambush for Abimelech along the trail at the top of the mountain . ( While they were waiting for him to come along , they robbed everyone else who passed that way . ) But someone warned Abimelech about their plot .
TLB	Judges	9	26	At that time Gaal ( the son of Ebed ) moved to Shechem with his brothers , and he became one of the leading citizens .
TLB	Judges	9	27	During the harvest feast at Shechem that year , held in the temple of the local god , the wine flowed freely and everyone began cursing Abimelech .
TLB	Judges	9	28	“ Who is Abimelech , ” Gaal shouted , “ and why should he be our king ? Why should we be his servants ? He and his friend Zebul should be our servants . Down with Abimelech !
TLB	Judges	9	29	Make me your king and you ’ ll soon see what happens to Abimelech ! I ’ ll tell Abimelech , ‘ Get up an army and come on out and fight ! ’ ”
TLB	Judges	9	30	But when Zebul , the mayor of the city , heard what Gaal was saying , he was furious .
TLB	Judges	9	31	He sent messengers to Abimelech in Arumah telling him , “ Gaal , son of Ebed , and his relatives have come to live in Shechem , and now they are arousing the city to rebellion against you .
TLB	Judges	9	32	Come by night with an army and hide out in the fields ;
TLB	Judges	9	33	and in the morning , as soon as it is daylight , storm the city . When he and those who are with him come out against you , you can do with them as you wish ! ”
TLB	Judges	9	34	So Abimelech and his men marched through the night and split into four groups , stationing themselves around the city .
TLB	Judges	9	35	The next morning as Gaal sat at the city gates , discussing various issues with the local leaders , Abimelech and his men began their march upon the city .
TLB	Judges	9	36	When Gaal saw them , he exclaimed to Zebul , “ Look over at that mountain ! Doesn ’ t it look like people coming down ? ” “ No ! ” Zebul said . “ You ’ re just seeing shadows that look like men ! ”
TLB	Judges	9	37	“ No , look over there , ” Gaal said . “ I ’ m sure I see people coming toward us . And look ! There are others coming along the road past the oak of Meonenim ! ”
TLB	Judges	9	38	Then Zebul turned on him triumphantly . “ Now where is that big mouth of yours ? ” he demanded . “ Who was it who said , ‘ Who is Abimelech , and why should he be our king ? ’ The men you taunted and cursed are right outside the city ! Go on out and fight ! ”
TLB	Judges	9	39	So Gaal led the men of Shechem into the battle and fought with Abimelech ,
TLB	Judges	9	40	but was defeated , and many of the men of Shechem were left wounded all the way to the city gate .
TLB	Judges	9	41	Abimelech was living at Arumah at this time , and Zebul drove Gaal and his relatives out of Shechem and wouldn ’ t let them live there any longer .
TLB	Judges	9	42	The next day the men of Shechem went out to battle again . However , someone had told Abimelech about their plans ,
TLB	Judges	9	43	so he had divided his men into three groups hiding in the fields . And when the men of the city went out to attack , he and his men jumped up from their hiding places and began killing them .
TLB	Judges	9	44	Abimelech stormed the city gate to keep the men of Shechem from getting back in , while his other two groups cut them down in the fields .
TLB	Judges	9	45	The battle went on all day before Abimelech finally captured the city , killed its people , and leveled it to the ground .
TLB	Judges	9	46	The people at the nearby town of Migdal saw what was happening and took refuge in the fort next to the temple of Baal-berith . 47-48 When Abimelech learned of this , he led his forces to Mount Zalmon where he began chopping a bundle of firewood , and placed it upon his shoulder . “ Do as I have done , ” he told his men .
TLB	Judges	9	49	So each of them quickly cut a bundle and carried it back to the town where , following Abimelech ’ s example , the bundles were piled against the walls of the fort and set on fire . So all the people inside died , about a thousand men and women .
TLB	Judges	9	50	Abimelech next attacked the city of Thebez , and captured it .
TLB	Judges	9	51	However , there was a fort inside the city and the entire population fled into it , barricaded the gates , and climbed to the top of the roof to watch .
TLB	Judges	9	52	But as Abimelech was preparing to burn it ,
TLB	Judges	9	53	a woman on the roof threw down a millstone . It landed on Abimelech ’ s head , crushing his skull .
TLB	Judges	9	54	“ Kill me ! ” he groaned to his youthful armor bearer . “ Never let it be said that a woman killed Abimelech ! ” So the young man pierced him with his sword , and he died .
TLB	Judges	9	55	When his men saw that he was dead , they disbanded and returned to their homes . 56-57 Thus God punished both Abimelech and the men of Shechem for their sin of murdering Gideon ’ s seventy sons . So the curse of Jotham , Gideon ’ s son , came true . Footnotes - Judges 9:2 meaning me , your own flesh and blood . Of all Gideon ’ s wives , only Abimelech ’ s mother was from Shechem ( 8:30-31 ) , so Abimelech felt his close kinship there . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Judges	10	10	Finally the Israelis turned to Jehovah again and begged him to save them . “ We have sinned against you and have forsaken you as our God and have worshiped idols , ” they confessed .
TLB	Judges	10	2	He was Israel ’ s judge for twenty-three years . When he died , he was buried in Shamir ,
TLB	Judges	10	3	and was succeeded by Jair , a man from Gilead , who judged Israel for twenty-two years .
TLB	Judges	10	4	His thirty sons rode around together on thirty donkeys , and they owned thirty cities in the land of Gilead which are still called “ The Cities of Jair. ”
TLB	Judges	10	5	When Jair died he was buried in Kamon .
TLB	Judges	10	6	Then the people of Israel turned away from the Lord again and worshiped the heathen gods Baal and Ashtaroth , and the gods of Syria , Sidon , Moab , Ammon , and Philistia . Not only this , but they no longer worshiped Jehovah at all . 7-8 This made Jehovah very angry with his people , so he immediately permitted the Philistines and the Ammonites to begin tormenting them . These attacks took place east of the Jordan River in the land of the Amorites ( that is , in Gilead ) ,
TLB	Judges	10	9	and also in Judah , Benjamin , and Ephraim . For the Ammonites crossed the Jordan to attack the Israelis . This went on for eighteen years .
TLB	Judges	10	11	But the Lord replied , “ Didn ’ t I save you from the Egyptians , the Amorites , the Ammonites , the Philistines ,
TLB	Judges	10	12	the Sidonians , the Amalekites , and the Maonites ? Has there ever been a time when you cried out to me that I haven ’ t rescued you ?
TLB	Judges	10	13	Yet you continue to abandon me and to worship other gods . So go away ; I won ’ t save you anymore .
TLB	Judges	10	14	Go and cry to the new gods you have chosen ! Let them save you in your hour of distress ! ”
TLB	Judges	10	15	But they pleaded with him again and said , “ We have sinned . Punish us in any way you think best , only save us once more from our enemies. ”
TLB	Judges	10	16	Then they destroyed their foreign gods and worshiped only the Lord ; and he was grieved by their misery .
TLB	Judges	10	17	The armies of Ammon were mobilized in Gilead at that time , preparing to attack Israel ’ s army at Mizpah .
TLB	Judges	10	18	“ Who will lead our forces against the Ammonites ? ” the leaders of Gilead asked each other . “ Whoever volunteers shall be our king ! ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Judges	11	11	So Jephthah accepted the commission and was made commander-in-chief and king . The contract was ratified before the Lord in Mizpah at a general assembly of all the people .
TLB	Judges	11	3	So Jephthah fled from his father ’ s home and lived in the land of Tob . Soon he had quite a band of malcontents as his followers , living off the land as bandits .
TLB	Judges	11	4	It was about this time that the Ammonites began their war against Israel .
TLB	Judges	11	5	The leaders of Gilead sent for Jephthah ,
TLB	Judges	11	6	begging him to come and lead their army against the Ammonites .
TLB	Judges	11	7	But Jephthah said to them , “ Why do you come to me when you hate me and have driven me out of my father ’ s house ? Why come now when you ’ re in trouble ? ”
TLB	Judges	11	8	“ Because we need you , ” they replied . “ If you will be our commander-in-chief against the Ammonites , we will make you the king of Gilead. ”
TLB	Judges	11	9	“ Sure ! ” Jephthah exclaimed . “ Do you expect me to believe that ? ”
TLB	Judges	11	10	“ We swear it , ” they replied . “ We promise with a solemn oath. ”
TLB	Judges	11	12	Then Jephthah sent messengers to the king of Ammon , demanding to know why Israel was being attacked .
TLB	Judges	11	13	The king of Ammon replied that the land belonged to the people of Ammon ; it had been stolen from them , he said , when the Israelis came from Egypt ; the whole territory from the Arnon River to the Jabbok and the Jordan was his , he claimed . “ Give us back our land peaceably , ” he demanded . 14-15 Jephthah replied , “ Israel did not steal the land .
TLB	Judges	11	16	What happened was this : When the people of Israel arrived at Kadesh , on their journey from Egypt after crossing the Red Sea ,
TLB	Judges	11	17	they sent a message to the king of Edom asking permission to pass through his land . But their petition was denied . Then they asked the king of Moab for similar permission . It was the same story there , so the people of Israel stayed in Kadesh .
TLB	Judges	11	18	“ Finally they went around Edom and Moab through the wilderness , and traveled along the eastern border until at last they arrived beyond the boundary of Moab at the Arnon River ; but they never once crossed into Moab .
TLB	Judges	11	19	Then Israel sent messengers to King Sihon of the Amorites , who lived in Heshbon , and asked permission to cross through his land to get to their destination .
TLB	Judges	11	20	“ But King Sihon didn ’ t trust Israel , so he mobilized an army at Jahaz and attacked them . 21-22 But the Lord our God helped Israel defeat King Sihon and all your people , so Israel took over all of your land from the Arnon River to the Jabbok , and from the wilderness to the Jordan River .
TLB	Judges	11	23	“ So you see , it was the Lord God of Israel who took away the land from the Amorites and gave it to Israel . Why , then , should we return it to you ?
TLB	Judges	11	24	You keep whatever your god Chemosh gives you , and we will keep whatever Jehovah our God gives us !
TLB	Judges	11	25	And besides , just who do you think you are ? Are you better than King Balak , the king of Moab ? Did he try to recover his land after Israel defeated him ? No , of course not .
TLB	Judges	11	26	But now after three hundred years you make an issue of this ! Israel has been living here for all that time , spread across the land from Heshbon to Aroer , and all along the Arnon River . Why have you made no effort to recover it before now ?
TLB	Judges	11	27	No , I have not sinned against you ; rather , you have wronged me by coming to war against me ; but Jehovah the Judge will soon show which of us is right—Israel or Ammon. ”
TLB	Judges	11	28	But the king of Ammon paid no attention to Jephthah ’ s message .
TLB	Judges	11	29	At that time the Spirit of the Lord came upon Jephthah , and he led his army across the land of Gilead and Manasseh , past Mizpah in Gilead , and attacked the army of Ammon . 30-31 Meanwhile Jephthah had vowed to the Lord that if God would help Israel conquer the Ammonites , then when he returned home in peace , the first person coming out of his house to meet him would be sacrificed as a burnt offering to the Lord !
TLB	Judges	11	32	So Jephthah led his army against the Ammonites , and the Lord gave him the victory .
TLB	Judges	11	33	He destroyed the Ammonites with a terrible slaughter all the way from Aroer to Minnith , including twenty cities , and as far away as Vineyard Meadow . Thus the Ammonites were subdued by the people of Israel .
TLB	Judges	11	34	When Jephthah returned home his daughter—his only child—ran out to meet him , playing on a tambourine and dancing for joy .
TLB	Judges	11	35	When he saw her , he tore his clothes in anguish . “ Alas , my daughter ! ” he cried out . “ You have brought me to the dust . For I have made a vow to the Lord and I can not take it back. ”
TLB	Judges	11	36	And she said , “ Father , you must do whatever you promised the Lord , for he has given you a great victory over your enemies , the Ammonites .
TLB	Judges	11	37	But first let me go up into the hills and roam with my girlfriends for two months , weeping because I ’ ll never marry. ”
TLB	Judges	11	38	“ Yes , ” he said . “ Go. ” And so she did , bewailing her fate with her friends for two months .
TLB	Judges	11	39	Then she returned to her father , who did as he had vowed . So she was never married . [ a ] And after that it became a custom in Israel
TLB	Judges	11	40	that the young girls went away for four days each year to lament the fate of Jephthah ’ s daughter . Footnotes - Judges 11:39 So she was never married . It is not clear whether he killed her or satisfied his vow by consecrating her to perpetual virginity . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Judges	12	12	Then the tribe of Ephraim mobilized its army at Zaphon and sent this message to Jephthah : “ Why didn ’ t you call for us to help you fight against Ammon ? We are going to burn down your house , with you in it ! ”
TLB	Judges	12	2	“ I summoned you , but you refused to come ! ” Jephthah retorted . “ You failed to help us in our time of need ,
TLB	Judges	12	3	so I risked my life and went to battle without you , and the Lord helped me to conquer the enemy . Is that anything for you to fight us about ? ”
TLB	Judges	12	4	Then Jephthah , furious at the taunt of Ephraim that the men of Gilead were mere outcasts [ a ] and the scum of the earth , mobilized his army and attacked the army of Ephraim .
TLB	Judges	12	5	He captured the fords of the Jordan behind the army of Ephraim , and whenever a fugitive from Ephraim tried to cross the river , the Gilead guards challenged him . “ Are you a member of the tribe of Ephraim ? ” they asked . If the man replied that he was not ,
TLB	Judges	12	6	then they demanded , “ Say ‘ Shibboleth. ’ ” But if he couldn ’ t pronounce the H and said , “ Sibboleth ” instead of “ Shibboleth , ” he was dragged away and killed . So forty-two thousand people of Ephraim died there at that time .
TLB	Judges	12	7	Jephthah was Israel ’ s judge for six years . At his death he was buried in one of the cities of Gilead .
TLB	Judges	12	8	The next judge was Ibzan , who lived in Bethlehem . 9-10 He had thirty sons and thirty daughters . He married his daughters to men outside his clan and brought in thirty girls to marry his sons . He judged Israel for seven years before he died , and was buried at Bethlehem . 11-12 The next judge was Elon from Zebulun . He judged Israel for ten years and was buried at Aijalon in Zebulun .
TLB	Judges	12	13	Next was Abdon ( son of Hillel ) from Pirathon .
TLB	Judges	12	14	He had forty sons and thirty grandsons , who rode on seventy donkeys . He was Israel ’ s judge for eight years .
TLB	Judges	12	15	Then he died and was buried in Pirathon , in Ephraim , in the hill country of the Amalekites . Footnotes - Judges 12:4 mere outcasts , literally , “ fugitives of Ephraim. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Judges	13	13	Once again Israel sinned by worshiping other gods , so the Lord let them be conquered by the Philistines , who kept them in subjection for forty years . 2-3 Then one day the Angel of the Lord appeared to the wife of Manoah , of the tribe of Dan , who lived in the city of Zorah . She had no children , but the Angel said to her , “ Even though you have been barren so long , you will soon conceive and have a son !
TLB	Judges	13	4	Don ’ t drink any wine or beer and don ’ t eat any food that isn ’ t kosher .
TLB	Judges	13	5	Your son ’ s hair must never be cut , for he shall be a Nazirite , a special servant of God from the time of his birth ; and he will begin to rescue Israel from the Philistines. ”
TLB	Judges	13	6	The woman ran and told her husband , “ A man from God appeared to me and I think he must be the Angel of the Lord , for he was almost too glorious to look at . I didn ’ t ask where he was from , and he didn ’ t tell me his name ,
TLB	Judges	13	7	but he told me , ‘ You are going to have a baby boy ! ’ And he told me not to drink any wine or beer and not to eat food that isn ’ t kosher , for the baby is going to be a Nazirite—he will be dedicated to God from the moment of his birth until the day of his death ! ”
TLB	Judges	13	8	Then Manoah prayed , “ O Lord , please let the man from God come back to us again and give us more instructions about the child you are going to give us. ”
TLB	Judges	13	9	The Lord answered his prayer , and the Angel of God appeared once again to his wife as she was sitting in the field . But again she was alone—Manoah was not with her—
TLB	Judges	13	10	so she quickly ran and found her husband and told him , “ The same man is here again ! ”
TLB	Judges	13	11	Manoah ran back with his wife and asked , “ Are you the man who talked to my wife the other day ? ” “ Yes , ” he replied , “ I am. ”
TLB	Judges	13	12	So Manoah asked him , “ Can you give us any special instructions about how we should raise the baby after he is born ? ” 13-14 And the Angel replied , “ Be sure that your wife follows the instructions I gave her . She must not eat grapes or raisins , or drink any wine or beer , or eat anything that isn ’ t kosher. ”
TLB	Judges	13	15	Then Manoah said to the Angel , “ Please stay here until we can get you something to eat. ”
TLB	Judges	13	16	“ I ’ ll stay , ” the Angel replied , “ but I ’ ll not eat anything . However , if you wish to bring something , bring an offering to sacrifice to the Lord. ” ( Manoah didn ’ t yet realize that he was the Angel of the Lord . )
TLB	Judges	13	17	Then Manoah asked him for his name . “ When all this comes true and the baby is born , ” he said to the Angel , “ we will certainly want to tell everyone that you predicted it ! ”
TLB	Judges	13	18	“ Don ’ t even ask my name , ” the Angel replied , “ for it is a secret. ”
TLB	Judges	13	19	Then Manoah took a young goat and a grain offering and offered it as a sacrifice to the Lord ; and the Angel did a strange and wonderful thing ,
TLB	Judges	13	20	for as the flames from the altar were leaping up toward the sky , and as Manoah and his wife watched , the Angel ascended in the fire ! Manoah and his wife fell face downward to the ground ,
TLB	Judges	13	21	and that was the last they ever saw of him . It was then that Manoah finally realized that it had been the Angel of the Lord .
TLB	Judges	13	22	“ We will die , ” Manoah cried out to his wife , “ for we have seen God ! ”
TLB	Judges	13	23	But his wife said , “ If the Lord were going to kill us , he wouldn ’ t have accepted our burnt offerings and wouldn ’ t have appeared to us and told us this wonderful thing and done these miracles. ”
TLB	Judges	13	24	When her son was born they named him Samson , and the Lord blessed him as he grew up .
TLB	Judges	13	25	And the Spirit of the Lord began to excite him whenever he visited the parade grounds of the army of the tribe of Dan , located between the cities of Zorah and Eshtaol . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Judges	14	14	This was his riddle : “ Food came out of the eater , and sweetness from the strong ! ” Three days later they were still trying to figure it out .
TLB	Judges	14	2	and when he got home he told his father and mother that he wanted to marry her .
TLB	Judges	14	3	They objected strenuously . “ Why don ’ t you marry a Jewish girl ? ” they asked . “ Why must you go and get a wife from these heathen Philistines ? Isn ’ t there one girl among all the people of Israel you could marry ? ” But Samson told his father , “ She is the one I want . Get her for me. ”
TLB	Judges	14	4	His father and mother didn ’ t realize that the Lord was behind the request , for God was setting a trap for the Philistines , who at that time were the rulers of Israel .
TLB	Judges	14	5	As Samson and his parents were going to Timnah , a young lion attacked Samson in the vineyards on the outskirts of the town .
TLB	Judges	14	6	At that moment the Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him and since he had no weapon , he ripped the lion ’ s jaws apart and did it as easily as though it were a young goat ! But he didn ’ t tell his father or mother about it .
TLB	Judges	14	7	Upon arriving at Timnah , he talked with the girl and found her to be just what he wanted , so the arrangements were made . [ a ]
TLB	Judges	14	8	When he returned for the wedding , he turned off the path to look at the carcass of the lion . And he found a swarm of bees in it and some honey !
TLB	Judges	14	9	He took some of the honey with him , eating as he went , and gave some of it to his father and mother . But he didn ’ t tell them where he had gotten it . 10-11 As his father was making final arrangements for the marriage , Samson threw a party for thirty young men of the village , as was the custom of the day .
TLB	Judges	14	12	When Samson asked if they would like to hear a riddle , they replied that they would . “ If you solve my riddle during these seven days of the celebration , ” he said , “ I ’ ll give you thirty plain robes and thirty fancy robes .
TLB	Judges	14	13	But if you can ’ t solve it , then you must give the robes to me ! ” “ All right , ” they agreed , “ let ’ s hear it. ”
TLB	Judges	14	15	On the fourth day they said to his new wife , “ Get the answer from your husband , or we ’ ll burn down your father ’ s house with you in it . Were we invited to this party just to make us poor ? ”
TLB	Judges	14	16	So Samson ’ s wife broke down in tears before him and said , “ You don ’ t love me at all ; you hate me , for you have told a riddle to my people and haven ’ t told me the answer ! ” “ I haven ’ t even told it to my father or mother ; why should I tell you ? ” he replied .
TLB	Judges	14	17	So she cried whenever she was with him and kept it up for the remainder of the celebration . At last , on the seventh day , he told her the answer and she , of course , gave the answer to the young men .
TLB	Judges	14	18	So before sunset of the seventh day they gave him their reply . “ What is sweeter than honey ? ” they asked , “ and what is stronger than a lion ? ” “ If you hadn ’ t plowed with my heifer , you wouldn ’ t have found the answer to my riddle ! ” he retorted .
TLB	Judges	14	19	Then the Spirit of the Lord came upon him and he went to the city of Ashkelon , killed thirty men , took their clothing , and gave it to the young men who had told him the answer to his riddle . But he was furious about it and abandoned his wife and went back home to live with his father and mother .
TLB	Judges	14	20	So his wife was married instead to the fellow who had been best man at Samson ’ s wedding . Footnotes - Judges 14:7 so the arrangements were made , implied . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Judges	15	15	Then he picked up a donkey ’ s jawbone that was lying on the ground and killed a thousand Philistines with it . 16-17 Tossing away the jawbone , he remarked , “ Heaps upon heaps , All with a donkey ’ s jaw ! I ’ ve killed a thousand men , All with a donkey ’ s jaw ! ” ( The place has been called “ Jawbone Hill ” ever since . )
TLB	Judges	15	2	“ I really thought you hated her , ” he explained , “ so I married her to your best man . But look , her sister is prettier than she is . Marry her instead. ”
TLB	Judges	15	3	Samson was furious . “ You can ’ t blame me for whatever happens now , ” he shouted .
TLB	Judges	15	4	So he went out and caught three hundred foxes and tied their tails together in pairs , with a torch between each pair .
TLB	Judges	15	5	Then he lit the torches and let the foxes run through the fields of the Philistines , burning the grain to the ground along with all the sheaves and shocks of grain , and destroying the olive trees .
TLB	Judges	15	6	“ Who did this ? ” the Philistines demanded . “ Samson , ” was the reply , “ because his wife ’ s father gave her to another man. ” So the Philistines came and got the girl and her father and burned them alive .
TLB	Judges	15	7	“ Now my vengeance will strike again ! ” Samson vowed .
TLB	Judges	15	8	So he attacked them with great fury and killed many of them . Then he went to live in a cave in the rock of Etam .
TLB	Judges	15	9	The Philistines in turn sent a huge posse into Judah and raided Lehi .
TLB	Judges	15	10	“ Why have you come here ? ” the men of Judah asked . And the Philistines replied , “ To capture Samson and do to him as he has done to us. ”
TLB	Judges	15	11	So three thousand men of Judah went down to get Samson at the cave in the rock of Etam . “ What are you doing to us ? ” they demanded of him . “ Don ’ t you realize that the Philistines are our rulers ? ” But Samson replied , “ I only paid them back for what they did to me. ” 12-13 “ We have come to capture you and take you to the Philistines , ” the men of Judah told him . “ All right , ” Samson said , “ but promise me that you won ’ t kill me yourselves. ” “ No , ” they replied , “ we won ’ t do that. ” So they tied him with two new ropes and led him away .
TLB	Judges	15	14	As Samson and his captors arrived at Lehi , the Philistines shouted with glee ; but then the strength of the Lord came upon Samson , and the ropes with which he was tied snapped like thread and fell from his wrists !
TLB	Judges	15	18	But now he was very thirsty and he prayed to the Lord and said , “ You have given Israel such a wonderful deliverance through me today ! Must I now die of thirst and fall to the mercy of these heathen ? ”
TLB	Judges	15	19	So the Lord caused water to gush out from a hollow in the ground , and Samson ’ s spirit was revived as he drank . Then he named the place “ The Spring of the Man Who Prayed , ” and the spring is still there today .

TLB	Judges	16	16	One day Samson went to the Philistine city of Gaza and spent the night with a prostitute .
TLB	Judges	16	2	Word soon spread that he had been seen in the city , so the police were alerted and many men of the city lay in wait all night at the city gate to capture him if he tried to leave . “ In the morning , ” they thought , “ when there is enough light , we ’ ll find him and kill him. ”
TLB	Judges	16	3	Samson stayed in bed with the girl until midnight , then went out to the city gates and lifted them , with the two gateposts , right out of the ground . He put them on his shoulders and carried them to the top of the mountain across from Hebron !
TLB	Judges	16	4	Later on he fell in love with a girl named Delilah over in the valley of Sorek .
TLB	Judges	16	5	The five heads of the Philistine nation went personally to her and demanded that she find out from Samson what made him so strong , so that they would know how to overpower and subdue him and put him in chains . “ Each of us will give you a thousand dollars for this job , ” they promised .
TLB	Judges	16	6	So Delilah begged Samson to tell her his secret . “ Please tell me , Samson , why you are so strong , ” she pleaded . “ I don ’ t think anyone could ever capture you ! ”
TLB	Judges	16	7	“ Well , ” Samson replied , “ if I were tied with seven raw-leather bowstrings , I would become as weak as anyone else. ”
TLB	Judges	16	8	So they brought her the seven bowstrings , and while he slept [ a ] she tied him with them .
TLB	Judges	16	9	Some men were hiding in the next room , so as soon as she had tied him up she exclaimed , “ Samson ! The Philistines are here ! ” Then he snapped the bowstrings like cotton thread , [ b ] and so his secret was not discovered .
TLB	Judges	16	10	Afterward Delilah said to him , “ You are making fun of me ! You told me a lie ! Please tell me how you can be captured ! ”
TLB	Judges	16	11	“ Well , ” he said , “ if I am tied with brand new ropes which have never been used , I will be as weak as other men. ”
TLB	Judges	16	12	So that time , as he slept , [ c ] Delilah took new ropes and tied him with them . The men were hiding in the next room , as before . Again Delilah exclaimed , “ Samson ! The Philistines have come to capture you ! ” But he broke the ropes from his arms like spiderwebs !
TLB	Judges	16	13	“ You have mocked me again and told me more lies ! ” Delilah complained . “ Now tell me how you can really be captured. ” “ Well , ” he said , “ if you weave my hair into your loom . . . ! ”
TLB	Judges	16	14	. - Judges 16:9 like cotton thread , literally , “ like a string of tow snaps when it touches the fire. ” - Judges 16:12 as he slept , implied . - Judges 16:27 in the balconies , literally , “ on the roof. ” The Living Bible copyright ©
TLB	Judges	16	15	“ How can you say you love me when you don ’ t confide in me ? ” she whined . “ You ’ ve made fun of me three times now , and you still haven ’ t told me what makes you so strong ! ” 16-17 She nagged at him every day until he couldn ’ t stand it any longer and finally told her his secret . “ My hair has never been cut , ” he confessed , “ for I ’ ve been a Nazirite to God since before my birth . If my hair were cut , my strength would leave me , and I would become as weak as anyone else. ”
TLB	Judges	16	18	Delilah realized that he had finally told her the truth , so she sent for the five Philistine leaders . “ Come just this once more , ” she said , “ for this time he has told me everything. ” So they brought the money with them .
TLB	Judges	16	19	She lulled him to sleep with his head in her lap , and they brought in a barber and cut off his hair . Delilah began to hit him , but she could see that his strength was leaving him .
TLB	Judges	16	20	Then she screamed , “ The Philistines are here to capture you , Samson ! ” And he woke up and thought , “ I will do as before ; I ’ ll just shake myself free. ” But he didn ’ t realize that the Lord had left him .
TLB	Judges	16	21	So the Philistines captured him and gouged out his eyes and took him to Gaza , where he was bound with bronze chains and made to grind grain in the prison .
TLB	Judges	16	22	But before long his hair began to grow again . 23-24 The Philistine leaders declared a great festival to celebrate the capture of Samson . The people made sacrifices to their god Dagon and excitedly praised him . “ Our god has delivered our enemy Samson to us ! ” they gloated as they saw him there in chains . “ The scourge of our nation who killed so many of us is now in our power ! ” 25-26 Half drunk by now , the people demanded , “ Bring out Samson so we can have some fun with him ! ” So he was brought from the prison and made to stand at the center of the temple , between the two pillars supporting the roof . Samson said to the boy who was leading him by the hand , “ Place my hands against the two pillars . I want to rest against them. ”
TLB	Judges	16	27	By then the temple was completely filled with people . The five Philistine leaders were there as well as three thousand people in the balconies [ d ] who were watching Samson and making fun of him .
TLB	Judges	16	28	Then Samson prayed to the Lord and said , “ O Lord Jehovah , remember me again—please strengthen me one more time , so that I may pay back the Philistines for the loss of at least one of my eyes. ”

TLB	Judges	17	17	In the hill country of Ephraim lived a man named Micah .
TLB	Judges	17	2	One day he said to his mother , “ That thousand dollars you thought was stolen from you , and you were cursing about—well , I stole it ! ” “ God bless you for confessing it , ” his mother replied .
TLB	Judges	17	3	So he returned the money to her . “ I am going to give it to the Lord as a credit for your account , ” she declared . “ I ’ ll have an idol carved for you and plate it with the silver. ” 4-5 So his mother took a fifth of it to a silversmith , and the idol he made from it was placed in Micah ’ s shrine . Micah had many idols in his collection , also an ephod and some teraphim , and he installed one of his sons as the priest .
TLB	Judges	17	6	( For in those days Israel had no king , so everyone did whatever he wanted to—whatever seemed right in his own eyes . ) 7-8 One day a young priest [ a ] from the town of Bethlehem , in Judah , arrived in that area of Ephraim , looking for a good place to live . He happened to stop at Micah ’ s house as he was traveling through .
TLB	Judges	17	9	“ Where are you from ? ” Micah asked him . And he replied , “ I am a priest from Bethlehem , in Judah , and I am looking for a place to live. ” 10-11 “ Well , stay here with me , ” Micah said , “ and you can be my priest . I will give you one hundred dollars a year plus a new suit and your board and room. ” The young man agreed to this and became as one of Micah ’ s sons .
TLB	Judges	17	12	So Micah consecrated him as his personal priest .
TLB	Judges	17	13	“ I know the Lord will really bless me now , ” Micah exclaimed , “ because now I have a genuine priest working for me ! ” [ b ] Footnotes - Judges 17:7 a young priest , literally , “ a Levite. ” - Judges 17:13 a genuine priest , literally , “ a Levite as a priest. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Judges	18	18	“ What are you doing ? ” the young priest demanded when he saw them carrying them out .
TLB	Judges	18	2	So the men of Dan chose five army heroes from the cities of Zorah and Eshtaol as scouts to go and spy out the land they were supposed to settle in . Arriving in the hill country of Ephraim , they stayed at Micah ’ s home .
TLB	Judges	18	3	Noticing the young Levite ’ s accent , they took him aside and asked him , “ What are you doing here ? Why did you come ? ”
TLB	Judges	18	4	He told them about his contract with Micah , and that he was his personal priest .
TLB	Judges	18	5	“ Well , then , ” they said , “ ask God whether or not our trip will be successful. ”
TLB	Judges	18	6	“ Yes , ” the priest replied , “ all is well . The Lord is taking care of you. ”
TLB	Judges	18	7	So the five men went on to the town of Laish and noticed how secure everyone felt . Their manner of life was Phoenician , and they were wealthy . They lived quietly and were unprepared for an attack , for there were no tribes in the area strong enough to try it . They lived a great distance from their relatives in Sidon , and had little or no contact with the nearby villages .
TLB	Judges	18	8	So the spies returned to their people in Zorah and Eshtaol . “ What about it ? ” they were asked . “ What did you find ? ” 9-10 And the men replied , “ Let ’ s attack ! We have seen the land and it is ours for the taking—a broad , fertile , wonderful place—a real paradise . The people aren ’ t even prepared to defend themselves ! Come on , let ’ s go ! For God has given it to us ! ”
TLB	Judges	18	11	So six hundred armed troops of the tribe of Dan set out from Zorah and Eshtaol .
TLB	Judges	18	12	They camped first at a place west of Kiriath-jearim in Judah ( which is still called “ The Camp of Dan ” ) ,
TLB	Judges	18	13	then they went on up into the hill country of Ephraim . As they passed the home of Micah ,
TLB	Judges	18	14	the five spies told the others . “ There is a shrine in there with an ephod , some teraphim , and many plated idols . It ’ s obvious what we ought to do ! ” 15-16 So the five men went over to the house and with all of the armed men standing just outside the gate , they talked to the young priest and asked him how he was getting along .
TLB	Judges	18	17	Then the five spies entered the shrine and took the idols , the ephod , and the teraphim .
TLB	Judges	18	19	“ Be quiet and come with us , ” they said . “ Be a priest to all of us . Isn ’ t it better for you to be a priest to a whole tribe in Israel instead of just to one man in his private home ? ”
TLB	Judges	18	20	The young priest was then quite happy to go with them , and he took along the ephod , the teraphim , and the idols .
TLB	Judges	18	21	They started on their way again , placing their children , cattle , and household goods at the front of the column .
TLB	Judges	18	22	When they were quite a distance from Micah ’ s home , Micah and some of his neighbors came chasing after them ,
TLB	Judges	18	23	yelling at them to stop . “ What do you want , chasing after us like this ? ” the men of Dan demanded .
TLB	Judges	18	24	“ What do you mean , ‘ What do I want ’ ! ” Micah retorted . “ You ’ ve taken away all my gods and my priest , and I have nothing left ! ”
TLB	Judges	18	25	“ Be careful how you talk , mister , ” the men of Dan replied . “ Somebody ’ s apt to get angry and kill every one of you. ”
TLB	Judges	18	26	So the men of Dan kept going . When Micah saw that there were too many of them for him to handle , he turned back home .
TLB	Judges	18	27	Then , with Micah ’ s idols and the priest , the men of Dan arrived at the city of Laish . There weren ’ t even any guards , so they went in and slaughtered all the people and burned the city to the ground .
TLB	Judges	18	28	There was no one to help the inhabitants , for they were too far away from Sidon , and they had no local allies , for they had no dealings with anyone . This happened in the valley next to Beth-rehob . Then the people of the tribe of Dan rebuilt the city and lived there .
TLB	Judges	18	29	The city was named “ Dan ” after their ancestor , Israel ’ s son , but it had originally been called Laish .
TLB	Judges	18	30	Then they set up the idols and appointed a man named Jonathan ( son of Gershom and grandson of Moses ! ) and his sons as their priests . This family continued as priests until the city was finally conquered by its enemies .
TLB	Judges	18	31	So Micah ’ s idols were worshiped by the tribe of Dan as long as the Tabernacle remained at Shiloh . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Judges	19	19	even though we have fodder for our donkeys and plenty of food and wine for ourselves. ”
TLB	Judges	19	2	But she became angry with him and ran away , and returned to her father ’ s home in Bethlehem , and was there about four months .
TLB	Judges	19	3	Then her husband , taking along a servant and an extra donkey , went to see her to try to win her back again . When he arrived at her home , she let him in and introduced him to her father , who was delighted to meet him .
TLB	Judges	19	4	Her father urged him to stay awhile , so he stayed three days , and they all had a very pleasant time .
TLB	Judges	19	5	On the fourth day they were up early , ready to leave , but the girl ’ s father insisted on their having breakfast first .
TLB	Judges	19	6	Then he pleaded with him to stay one more day , as they were having such a good time .
TLB	Judges	19	7	At first the man refused , but his father-in-law kept urging him until finally he gave in .
TLB	Judges	19	8	The next morning they were up early again , and again the girl ’ s father pleaded , “ Stay just today and leave sometime this evening. ” So they had another day of feasting .
TLB	Judges	19	9	That afternoon as he and his wife and servant were preparing to leave , his father-in-law said , “ Look , it ’ s getting late . Stay just tonight , and we will have a pleasant evening together and tomorrow you can get up early and be on your way. ”
TLB	Judges	19	10	But this time the man was adamant , so they left , getting as far as Jerusalem ( also called Jebus ) before dark .
TLB	Judges	19	11	His servant said to him , “ It ’ s getting too late to travel ; let ’ s stay here tonight. ” 12-13 “ No , ” his master said , “ we can ’ t stay in this heathen city where there are no Israelites—we will go on to Gibeah , or possibly Ramah. ”
TLB	Judges	19	14	So they went on . The sun was setting just as they came to Gibeah , a village of the tribe of Benjamin ,
TLB	Judges	19	15	so they went there for the night . But as no one invited them in , they camped in the village square .
TLB	Judges	19	16	Just then an old man came by on his way home from his work in the fields . ( He was originally from the hill country of Ephraim , but was living now in Gibeah , even though it was in the territory of Benjamin . )
TLB	Judges	19	17	When he saw the travelers camped in the square , he asked them where they were from and where they were going .
TLB	Judges	19	18	“ We ’ re on the way home from Bethlehem , in Judah , ” the man replied . “ I live on the far edge of the Ephraim hill country , near Shiloh . But no one has taken us in for the night ,
TLB	Judges	19	20	“ Don ’ t worry , ” the old man said , “ be my guests ; for you mustn ’ t stay here in the square . It ’ s too dangerous. ”
TLB	Judges	19	21	So he took them home with him . He fed their donkeys while they rested , and afterward they had supper together .
TLB	Judges	19	22	Just as they were beginning to warm to the occasion , a gang of sex perverts gathered around the house and began beating at the door and yelling at the old man to bring out the man who was staying with him , so they could rape him .
TLB	Judges	19	23	The old man stepped outside to talk to them . “ No , my brothers , don ’ t do such a dastardly act , ” he begged , “ for he is my guest .
TLB	Judges	19	24	Here , take my virgin daughter and this man ’ s wife . I ’ ll bring them out and you can do whatever you like to them—but don ’ t do such a thing to this man. ”
TLB	Judges	19	25	But they wouldn ’ t listen to him . Then the girl ’ s husband pushed her out to them , and they abused her all night , taking turns raping her until morning . Finally , just at dawn , they let her go .
TLB	Judges	19	26	She fell down at the door of the house and lay there until it was light .
TLB	Judges	19	27	When her husband opened the door to be on his way , he found her there , fallen down in front of the door with her hands digging into the threshold .
TLB	Judges	19	28	“ Well , come on , ” he said . “ Let ’ s get going. ” But there was no answer , for she was dead ; so he threw her across the donkey ’ s back and took her home .
TLB	Judges	19	29	When he got there he took a knife and cut her body into twelve parts and sent one piece to each tribe of Israel .
TLB	Judges	19	30	Then the entire nation was roused to action against the men of Benjamin because of this awful deed . “ There hasn ’ t been such a horrible crime since Israel left Egypt , ” everyone said . “ We ’ ve got to do something about it. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Judges	20	20	1-2 Then the entire nation of Israel sent their leaders and 450,000 troops to assemble with one mind before the Lord at Mizpah . They came from as far away as Dan and Beersheba , and everywhere between , and from across the Jordan in the land of Gilead .
TLB	Judges	20	3	( Word of the mobilization of the Israeli forces at Mizpah soon reached the land of Benjamin . ) The chiefs of Israel now called for the murdered woman ’ s husband and asked him just what had happened .
TLB	Judges	20	4	“ We arrived one evening at Gibeah , a village in Benjamin , ” he began .
TLB	Judges	20	5	“ That night the men of Gibeah surrounded the house , planning to kill me , and they raped my wife until she was dead .
TLB	Judges	20	6	So I cut her body into twelve pieces and sent the pieces throughout the land of Israel , for these men have committed a terrible crime .
TLB	Judges	20	7	Now then , sons of Israel , express your mind and give me your counsel ! ” 8-10 And as one man they replied , “ Not one of us will return home until we have punished the village of Gibeah . A tenth of the army will be selected by lot as a supply line to bring us food , and the rest of us will destroy Gibeah for this horrible deed. ”
TLB	Judges	20	11	So the whole nation united in this task .
TLB	Judges	20	12	Then messengers were sent to the tribe of Benjamin , asking , “ Did you know about the terrible thing that was done among you ?
TLB	Judges	20	13	Give up these evil men from the city of Gibeah so that we can execute them and purge Israel of her evil. ” But the people of Benjamin wouldn ’ t listen . 14-15 Instead , 26,000 of them arrived in Gibeah to join the
TLB	Judges	20	700	men who were left-handed sharpshooters . They could hit a target within a hair ’ s breadth , never missing ! )
TLB	Judges	20	16	( Among all these there were
TLB	Judges	20	17	The army of Israel , not counting the men of Benjamin , numbered 400,000 men .
TLB	Judges	20	18	Before the battle the Israeli army went to Bethel first to ask counsel from God . “ Which tribe shall lead us against the people of Benjamin ? ” they asked . And the Lord replied , “ Judah shall go first. ” 19-20 So the entire army left early the next morning to go to Gibeah , to attack the men of Benjamin .
TLB	Judges	20	21	But the men defending the village stormed out and killed 22,000 Israelis that day . 22-24 Then the Israeli army wept before the Lord until evening and asked him , “ Shall we fight further against our brother Benjamin ? ” And the Lord said , “ Yes. ” So the men of Israel took courage and went out again the next day to fight at the same place .
TLB	Judges	20	25	And that day they lost another 18,000 men , all experienced swordsmen .
TLB	Judges	20	26	Then the entire army went up to Bethel and wept before the Lord and fasted until evening , offering burnt sacrifices and peace offerings . 27-28 ( The Ark of God was in Bethel in those days . Phinehas , the son of Eleazar and grandson of Aaron , was the priest . ) The men of Israel asked the Lord , “ Shall we go out again and fight against our brother Benjamin , or shall we stop ? ” And the Lord said , “ Go , for tomorrow I will see to it that you defeat the men of Benjamin. ”
TLB	Judges	20	29	So the Israeli army set an ambush all around the village ,
TLB	Judges	20	30	and went out again on the third day and set themselves in their usual battle formation .
TLB	Judges	20	31	When the army of Benjamin came out of the town to attack , the Israeli forces retreated and Benjamin was drawn away from the town as they chased after Israel . And as they had done previously , Benjamin began to kill the men of Israel along the roadway running between Bethel and Gibeah , so that about thirty of them died .
TLB	Judges	20	32	Then the army of Benjamin shouted , “ We ’ re defeating them again ! ” But the armies of Israel had agreed in advance to run away so that the army of Benjamin would chase them and be drawn away from the town .
TLB	Judges	20	33	But when the main army of Israel reached Baal-tamar , it turned and attacked , and the 10,000 men in ambush west of Geba jumped up from where they were
TLB	Judges	20	34	and advanced against the rear of the army of Benjamin , who still didn ’ t realize the impending disaster . 35-39 So the Lord helped Israel defeat Benjamin , and the Israeli army killed 25,100 men of Benjamin that day , leaving but a tiny remnant of their forces . Summary of the Battle : The army of Israel retreated from the men of Benjamin in order to give the ambush more room for maneuvering . When the men of Benjamin had killed about thirty of the Israelis , they were confident of a massive slaughter just as on the previous days . But then the men in ambush rushed into the village and slaughtered everyone in it , and set it on fire . The great cloud of smoke pouring into the sky was the signal for the Israeli army to turn around and attack the army of Benjamin , 40-41 who now looked behind them and were terrified to discover that their city was on fire , and that they were in serious trouble .
TLB	Judges	20	42	So they ran toward the wilderness , but the Israelis chased after them , and the men who had set the ambush came out and joined the slaughter from the rear .
TLB	Judges	20	43	They encircled the army of Benjamin east of Gibeah , and killed most of them there .
TLB	Judges	20	44	Eighteen thousand of the Benjamin troops died in that day ’ s battle .
TLB	Judges	20	45	The rest of the army fled into the wilderness toward the rock of Rimmon , but 5,000 were killed along the way , and 2,000 more near Gidom . 46-47 So the tribe of Benjamin lost 25,000 brave warriors that day , leaving only
TLB	Judges	20	600	men who escaped to the rock of Rimmon , where they lived for four months .
TLB	Judges	20	48	Then the Israeli army returned and slaughtered the entire population of the tribe of Benjamin—men , women , children , and cattle—and burned down every city and village in the entire land . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Judges	21	21	and when the girls of Shiloh come out for their dances , rush out and catch them and take them home with you to be your wives !
TLB	Judges	21	2	And now the Israeli leaders met at Bethel and sat before God until evening , weeping bitterly .
TLB	Judges	21	3	“ O Lord God of Israel , ” they cried out , “ why has this happened , that now one of our tribes is missing ? ”
TLB	Judges	21	4	The next morning they were up early and built an altar , and offered sacrifices and peace offerings on it .
TLB	Judges	21	5	And they said among themselves , “ Was any tribe of Israel not represented when we held our council before the Lord at Mizpah ? ” For at that time it was agreed by solemn oath that anyone who refused to come must die .
TLB	Judges	21	6	There was deep sadness throughout all Israel for the loss of their brother tribe , Benjamin . “ Gone , ” they kept saying to themselves , “ gone—an entire tribe of Israel has been cut off and is gone .
TLB	Judges	21	7	And how shall we get wives for the few who remain , since we have sworn by the Lord that we will not give them our daughters ? ” 8-9 Then they thought again of their oath to kill anyone who refused to come to Mizpah and discovered that no one had attended from Jabesh-gilead . 10-12 So they sent 12,000 of their best soldiers to destroy the people of Jabesh-gilead . All the men , married women , and children were slain , but the young virgins of marriageable age were saved . There were
TLB	Judges	21	400	girls were given to them as wives , and they returned to their homes ; but there were not enough of these girls for all of them .
TLB	Judges	21	13	Then Israel sent a peace delegation to the little remnant of the men of Benjamin at Rimmon Rock .
TLB	Judges	21	14	The
TLB	Judges	21	15	( What a sad time it was in Israel in those days because the Lord had made a breach in the tribes of Israel . )
TLB	Judges	21	16	“ What shall we do for wives for the others , since all the women of the tribe of Benjamin are dead ? ” the leaders of Israel asked .
TLB	Judges	21	17	“ There must be some way to get wives for them , so that an entire tribe of Israel will not be lost forever .
TLB	Judges	21	18	But we can ’ t give them our own daughters . We have sworn with a solemn oath that anyone who does this shall be cursed of God. ”
TLB	Judges	21	19	Suddenly someone thought of the annual religious festival held in the fields of Shiloh , between Lebonah and Bethel , along the east side of the road that goes from Bethel to Shechem .
TLB	Judges	21	20	They told the men of Benjamin who still needed wives , “ Go and hide in the vineyards ,
TLB	Judges	21	22	And when their fathers and brothers come to us in protest , we will tell them , ‘ Please be understanding and let them have your daughters , for we didn ’ t find enough wives for them when we destroyed Jabesh-gilead , and you couldn ’ t have given your daughters to them without being guilty. ’ ”
TLB	Judges	21	23	So the men of Benjamin did as they were told and kidnapped the girls who took part in the celebration , and carried them off to their own land . Then they rebuilt their cities and lived in them .
TLB	Judges	21	24	So the people of Israel returned to their homes .

TLB	Ruth	1	1	1-2 Long ago when judges ruled in Israel , a man named Elimelech , from Bethlehem , [ a ] left the country because of a famine and moved to the land of Moab . With him were his wife , Naomi , and his two sons , Mahlon and Chilion .
TLB	Ruth	1	3	During the time of their residence there , Elimelech died and Naomi was left with her two sons . 4-5 These young men , Mahlon and Chilion , married girls of Moab , Orpah and Ruth . But later , both men died , so that Naomi was left alone , without her husband or sons . 6-7 She decided to return to Israel with her daughters-in-law , for she had heard that the Lord had blessed his people by giving them good crops again .
TLB	Ruth	1	8	But after they had begun their homeward journey , she changed her mind and said to her two daughters-in-law , “ Why don ’ t you return to your parents ’ homes instead of coming with me ? And may the Lord reward you for your faithfulness to your husbands and to me .
TLB	Ruth	1	9	And may he bless you with another happy marriage. ” Then she kissed them , and they all broke down and cried .
TLB	Ruth	1	10	“ No , ” they said . “ We want to go with you to your people. ”
TLB	Ruth	1	11	But Naomi replied , “ It is better for you to return to your own people . Do I have younger sons who could grow up to be your husbands ? [ b ]
TLB	Ruth	1	12	No , my daughters , return to your parents ’ homes , for I am too old to have a husband . And even if that were possible , and I became pregnant tonight , and bore sons
TLB	Ruth	1	13	would you wait for them to grow up ? No , of course not , my daughters ; oh , how I grieve for you that the Lord has punished me in a way that injures you. ”
TLB	Ruth	1	14	And again they cried together , and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law good-bye , and returned to her childhood home ; but Ruth insisted on staying with Naomi .
TLB	Ruth	1	15	“ See , ” Naomi said to her , “ your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her gods ; you should do the same. ”
TLB	Ruth	1	16	But Ruth replied , “ Don ’ t make me leave you , for I want to go wherever you go and to live wherever you live ; your people shall be my people , and your God shall be my God ;
TLB	Ruth	1	17	I want to die where you die and be buried there . May the Lord do terrible things to me if I allow anything but death to separate us. ”
TLB	Ruth	1	18	And when Naomi saw that Ruth had made up her mind and could not be persuaded otherwise , she stopped urging her .
TLB	Ruth	1	19	So they both came to Bethlehem , and the entire village was stirred by their arrival . “ Is it really Naomi ? ” the women asked .
TLB	Ruth	1	20	But she told them , “ Don ’ t call me Naomi . Call me Mara , ” ( Naomi means “ pleasant ” ; Mara means “ bitter ” ) “ for Almighty God has dealt me bitter blows .
TLB	Ruth	1	21	I went out full and the Lord has brought me home empty ; why should you call me Naomi when the Lord has turned his back on me and sent such calamity ! ”

TLB	Ruth	2	2	One day Ruth said to Naomi , “ Perhaps I can go out into the fields of some kind man to glean the free grain [ a ] behind his reapers. ” And Naomi said , “ All right , dear daughter . Go ahead. ”
TLB	Ruth	2	3	So she did . And as it happened , the field where she found herself belonged to Boaz , this relative of Naomi ’ s husband . 4-5 Boaz arrived from the city while she was there . After exchanging greetings with the reapers he said to his foreman , “ Hey , who ’ s that girl over there ? ”
TLB	Ruth	2	6	And the foreman replied , “ It ’ s that girl from the land of Moab who came back with Naomi .
TLB	Ruth	2	7	She asked me this morning if she could pick up the grains dropped by the reapers , and she has been at it ever since except for a few minutes ’ rest over there in the shade. ” 8-9 Boaz went over and talked to her . “ Listen , my child , ” he said to her . “ Stay right here with us to glean ; don ’ t think of going to any other fields . Stay right behind my women workers ; I have warned the young men not to bother you ; when you are thirsty , go and help yourself to the water. ” 10-11 She thanked him warmly . “ How can you be so kind to me ? ” she asked . “ You must know I am only a foreigner. ” “ Yes , I know , ” Boaz replied , “ and I also know about all the love and kindness you have shown your mother-in-law since the death of your husband , and how you left your father and mother in your own land and have come here to live among strangers .
TLB	Ruth	2	12	May the Lord God of Israel , under whose wings you have come to take refuge , bless you for it. ”
TLB	Ruth	2	13	“ Oh , thank you , sir , ” she replied . “ You are so good to me , and I ’ m not even one of your workers ! ”
TLB	Ruth	2	14	At lunchtime Boaz called to her , “ Come and eat with us. ” So she sat with his reapers and he gave her food , [ b ] more than she could eat .
TLB	Ruth	2	15	And when she went back to work again , Boaz told his young men to let her glean right among the sheaves without stopping her ,
TLB	Ruth	2	16	and to snap off some heads of barley and drop them on purpose for her to glean , and not to make any remarks .
TLB	Ruth	2	17	So she worked there all day , and in the evening when she had beaten out the barley she had gleaned , it came to a whole bushel !
TLB	Ruth	2	18	She carried it back into the city and gave it to her mother-in-law , with what was left of her lunch .
TLB	Ruth	2	19	“ So much ! ” Naomi exclaimed . “ Where in the world did you glean today ? Praise the Lord for whoever was so kind to you. ” So Ruth told her mother-in-law all about it and mentioned that the owner of the field was Boaz .
TLB	Ruth	2	20	“ Praise the Lord for a man like that ! God has continued his kindness to us as well as to your dead husband ! ” Naomi cried excitedly . “ Why , that man is one of our closest relatives ! ” [ c ]
TLB	Ruth	2	21	“ Well , ” Ruth told her , “ he said to come back and stay close behind his reapers until the entire field is harvested. ”
TLB	Ruth	2	22	“ This is wonderful ! ” Naomi exclaimed . “ Do as he has said . Stay with his girls right through the whole harvest ; you will be safer there than in any other field ! ”

TLB	Ruth	3	3	Now do what I tell you—bathe and put on some perfume and some nice clothes and go on down to the threshing floor , but don ’ t let him see you until he has finished his supper .
TLB	Ruth	3	2	The man I ’ m thinking of is Boaz ! He has been so kind to us and is a close relative . I happen to know that he will be winnowing barley tonight out on the threshing floor .
TLB	Ruth	3	4	Notice where he lies down to sleep ; then go and lift the cover off his feet and lie down there , and he will tell you what to do concerning marriage. ”
TLB	Ruth	3	5	And Ruth replied , “ All right . I ’ ll do whatever you say. ” 6-7 So she went down to the threshing floor that night and followed her mother-in-law ’ s instructions . After Boaz had finished a good meal , he lay down very contentedly beside a heap of grain and went to sleep . Then Ruth came quietly and lifted the covering off his feet and lay there .
TLB	Ruth	3	8	Suddenly , around midnight , he wakened and sat up , startled . There was a woman lying at his feet !
TLB	Ruth	3	9	“ Who are you ? ” he demanded . “ It ’ s I , sir—Ruth , ” she replied . “ Make me your wife according to God ’ s law , for you are my close relative. ”
TLB	Ruth	3	10	“ Thank God for a girl like you ! ” he exclaimed . “ For you are being even kinder to Naomi now than before . Naturally you ’ d prefer a younger man , even though poor . But you have put aside your personal desires .
TLB	Ruth	3	11	Now don ’ t worry about a thing , my child ; I ’ ll handle all the details , for everyone knows what a wonderful person you are .
TLB	Ruth	3	12	But there is one problem . It ’ s true that I am a close relative , but there is someone else who is more closely related to you than I am .
TLB	Ruth	3	13	Stay here tonight , and in the morning I ’ ll talk to him , and if he will marry you , fine ; let him do his duty ; but if he won ’ t , then I will , I swear by Jehovah ; lie down until the morning. ”
TLB	Ruth	3	14	So she lay at his feet until the morning and was up early , before daybreak , for he had said to her , “ Don ’ t let it be known that a woman was here at the threshing floor. ” 15-18 “ Bring your shawl , ” he told her . Then he tied up a bushel and a half of barley in it as a present for her mother-in-law and laid it on her back . Then she returned to the city . “ Well , what happened , dear ? ” Naomi asked her when she arrived home . She told Naomi everything and gave her the barley from Boaz , and mentioned his remark that she mustn ’ t go home without a present . Then Naomi said to her , “ Just be patient until we hear what happens , for Boaz won ’ t rest until he has followed through on this . He ’ ll settle it today. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Ruth	4	4	I felt that I should speak to you about it so that you can buy it if you wish , with these respected men as witnesses . If you want it , [ b ] let me know right away , for if you don ’ t take it , I will . You have the first right to purchase it and I am next. ” The man replied , “ All right , I ’ ll buy it. ”
TLB	Ruth	4	2	Then Boaz called for ten of the chief men of the village and asked them to sit as witnesses .
TLB	Ruth	4	3	Boaz said to his relative , “ You know Naomi , who came back to us from Moab . She is selling our brother Elimelech ’ s property .
TLB	Ruth	4	5	Then Boaz told him , “ Your purchase of the land from Naomi requires your marriage to Ruth so that she can have children to carry on her husband ’ s name and to inherit the land. ”
TLB	Ruth	4	6	“ Then I can ’ t do it , ” the man replied . “ For her son would become an heir to my property too ; [ c ] you buy it. ”
TLB	Ruth	4	7	In those days it was the custom in Israel for a man transferring a right of purchase to pull off his sandal and hand it to the other party ; this publicly validated the transaction .
TLB	Ruth	4	8	So , as the man said to Boaz , “ You buy it for yourself , ” he drew off his sandal .
TLB	Ruth	4	9	Then Boaz said to the witnesses and to the crowd standing around , “ You have seen that today I have bought all the property of Elimelech , Chilion , and Mahlon , from Naomi ,
TLB	Ruth	4	10	and that with it I have purchased Ruth the Moabitess , the widow of Mahlon , to be my wife , so that she can have a son to carry on the family name of her dead husband. ”
TLB	Ruth	4	11	And all the people standing there and the witnesses replied , “ We are witnesses . May the Lord make this woman , who has now come into your home , as fertile as Rachel and Leah , from whom all the nation of Israel descended ! May you be a great and successful man in Bethlehem ,
TLB	Ruth	4	12	and may the descendants the Lord will give you from this young woman be as numerous and honorable as those of our ancestor Perez , the son of Tamar and Judah. ”
TLB	Ruth	4	13	So Boaz married Ruth , and when he slept with her , the Lord gave her a son .
TLB	Ruth	4	14	And the women of the city said to Naomi , “ Bless the Lord who has given you this little grandson ; may he be famous in Israel .
TLB	Ruth	4	15	May he restore your youth and take care of you in your old age ; for he is the son of your daughter-in-law who loves you so much , and who has been kinder to you than seven sons ! ” 16-17 Naomi took care of the baby , and the neighbor women said , “ Now at last Naomi has a son again ! ” And they named him Obed . He was the father of Jesse and grandfather of King David . 18-22 This is the family tree of Boaz , beginning with his ancestor Perez : Perez , Hezron , Ram , Amminadab , Nashon , Salmon , Boaz , Obed , Jesse , David .

TLB	1%20Samuel	1	1	Samuel 1:19 named him Samuel ( meaning “ asked of God ” ) . This was a play on words . The word Samuel in Hebrew sounds like the word “ to ask. ” The Living Bible copyright ©
TLB	1%20Samuel	1	2	He had two wives , Hannah and Peninnah . Peninnah had some children , but Hannah didn ’ t .
TLB	1%20Samuel	1	3	Each year Elkanah and his families journeyed to the Tabernacle at Shiloh to worship the Lord of the heavens and to sacrifice to him . ( The priests on duty at that time were the two sons of Eli—Hophni and Phinehas . )
TLB	1%20Samuel	1	4	On the day he presented his sacrifice , Elkanah would celebrate the happy occasion by giving presents to Peninnah and her children ;
TLB	1%20Samuel	1	5	but although he loved Hannah very much , he could give her only one present , for the Lord had sealed her womb ; so she had no children to give presents to .
TLB	1%20Samuel	1	6	Peninnah made matters worse by taunting Hannah because of her barrenness .
TLB	1%20Samuel	1	7	Every year it was the same—Peninnah scoffing and laughing at her as they went to Shiloh , making her cry so much she couldn ’ t eat .
TLB	1%20Samuel	1	8	“ What ’ s the matter , Hannah ? ” Elkanah would exclaim . “ Why aren ’ t you eating ? Why make such a fuss over having no children ? Isn ’ t having me better than having ten sons ? ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	1	9	One evening after supper , when they were at Shiloh , Hannah went over to the Tabernacle . Eli the priest was sitting at his customary place beside the entrance .
TLB	1%20Samuel	1	10	She was in deep anguish and was crying bitterly as she prayed to the Lord .
TLB	1%20Samuel	1	11	And she made this vow : “ O Lord of heaven , if you will look down upon my sorrow and answer my prayer and give me a son , then I will give him back to you , and he ’ ll be yours for his entire lifetime , and his hair shall never be cut. ” [ a ] 12-13 Eli noticed her mouth moving as she was praying silently and , hearing no sound , thought she had been drinking .
TLB	1%20Samuel	1	14	“ Must you come here drunk ? ” he demanded . “ Throw away your bottle. ” 15-16 “ Oh no , sir ! ” she replied , “ I ’ m not drunk ! But I am very sad and I was pouring out my heart to the Lord . Please don ’ t think that I am just some drunken bum ! ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	1	17	“ In that case , ” Eli said , “ cheer up ! May the Lord of Israel grant you your petition , whatever it is ! ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	1	18	“ Oh , thank you , sir ! ” she exclaimed , and went happily back , and began to take her meals again . 19-20 The entire family was up early the next morning and went to the Tabernacle to worship the Lord once more . Then they returned home to Ramah , and when Elkanah slept with Hannah , the Lord remembered her petition ; in the process of time , a baby boy was born to her . She named him Samuel ( meaning “ asked of God ” ) [ b ] because , as she said , “ I asked the Lord for him. ” 21-22 The next year Elkanah and Peninnah and her children went on the annual trip to the Tabernacle without Hannah , for she told her husband , “ Wait until the baby is weaned , and then I will take him to the Tabernacle and leave him there. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	1	23	“ Well , whatever you think best , ” Elkanah agreed . “ May the Lord ’ s will be done. ” So she stayed home until the baby was weaned .
TLB	1%20Samuel	1	24	Then , though he was still so small , they took him to the Tabernacle in Shiloh , along with a three-year-old bull for the sacrifice , and a bushel of flour and some wine .
TLB	1%20Samuel	1	25	After the sacrifice they took the child to Eli .
TLB	1%20Samuel	1	26	“ Sir , do you remember me ? ” Hannah asked him . “ I am the woman who stood here that time praying to the Lord !
TLB	1%20Samuel	1	27	I asked him to give me this child , and he has given me my request ;
TLB	1%20Samuel	1	28	and now I am giving him to the Lord for as long as he lives. ” So she left him there at the Tabernacle for the Lord to use . Footnotes -

TLB	1%20Samuel	2	1	Samuel 2:28 a priestly robe , literally , “ an ephod. ” The Living Bible copyright ©
TLB	1%20Samuel	2	2	No one is as holy as the Lord ! There is no other God , Nor any Rock like our God .
TLB	1%20Samuel	2	3	Quit acting so proud and arrogant ! The Lord knows what you have done , And he will judge your deeds .
TLB	1%20Samuel	2	4	Those who were mighty are mighty no more ! Those who were weak are now strong .
TLB	1%20Samuel	2	5	Those who were well are now starving ; Those who were starving are fed . The barren woman now has seven children ; She with many children has no more !
TLB	1%20Samuel	2	6	The Lord kills , The Lord gives life .
TLB	1%20Samuel	2	7	Some he causes to be poor And others to be rich . He cuts one down And lifts another up .
TLB	1%20Samuel	2	8	He lifts the poor from the dust— Yes , from a pile of ashes— And treats them as princes Sitting in the seats of honor . For all the earth is the Lord ’ s And he has set the world in order .
TLB	1%20Samuel	2	9	He will protect his godly ones , But the wicked shall be silenced in darkness . No one shall succeed by strength alone .
TLB	1%20Samuel	2	10	Those who fight against the Lord shall be broken ; He thunders against them from heaven . He judges throughout the earth . He gives mighty strength to his king , And gives great glory to his anointed one. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	2	11	So they returned home to Ramah without Samuel ; and the child became the Lord ’ s helper , for he assisted Eli the priest .
TLB	1%20Samuel	2	12	Now the sons of Eli were evil men who didn ’ t love the Lord . 13-14 It was their regular practice to send out a servant whenever anyone was offering a sacrifice , and while the flesh of the sacrificed animal was boiling , the servant would put a three-pronged flesh hook into the pot and demand that whatever it brought up be given to Eli ’ s sons . They treated all of the Israelites in this way when they came to Shiloh to worship .
TLB	1%20Samuel	2	15	Sometimes the servant would come even before the rite of burning the fat on the altar had been performed , and he would demand raw meat before it was boiled , so that it could be used for roasting .
TLB	1%20Samuel	2	16	If the man offering the sacrifice replied , “ Take as much as you want , but the fat must first be burned as the law requires , [ a ] ” then the servant would say , “ No , give it to me now or I ’ ll take it by force. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	2	17	So the sin of these young men was very great in the eyes of the Lord ; for they treated the people ’ s offerings to the Lord with contempt .
TLB	1%20Samuel	2	18	Samuel , though only a child , was the Lord ’ s helper and wore a little linen robe just like the priest ’ s . [ b ]
TLB	1%20Samuel	2	19	Each year his mother made a little coat for him and brought it to him when she came with her husband for the sacrifice .
TLB	1%20Samuel	2	20	Before they returned home Eli would bless Elkanah and Hannah and ask God to give them other children to take the place of this one they had given to the Lord .
TLB	1%20Samuel	2	21	And the Lord gave Hannah three sons and two daughters . Meanwhile Samuel grew up in the service of the Lord .
TLB	1%20Samuel	2	22	Eli was now very old , but he was aware of what was going on around him . He knew , for instance , that his sons were seducing the young women who assisted at the entrance of the Tabernacle . 23-25 “ I have been hearing terrible reports from the Lord ’ s people about what you are doing , ” Eli told his sons . “ It is an awful thing to make the Lord ’ s people sin . Ordinary sin receives heavy punishment , but how much more this sin of yours that has been committed against the Lord ! ” But they wouldn ’ t listen to their father , for the Lord was already planning to kill them .
TLB	1%20Samuel	2	26	Little Samuel was growing in two ways—he was getting taller , and he was becoming everyone ’ s favorite ( and he was a favorite of the Lord ’ s , too ! ) .
TLB	1%20Samuel	2	27	One day a prophet [ c ] came to Eli and gave him this message from the Lord : “ Didn ’ t I demonstrate my power when the people of Israel were slaves in Egypt ?
TLB	1%20Samuel	2	28	Didn ’ t I choose your ancestor Levi from among all his brothers to be my priest , and to sacrifice upon my altar , and to burn incense , and to wear a priestly robe [ d ] as he served me ? And didn ’ t I assign the sacrificial offerings to you priests ?
TLB	1%20Samuel	2	29	Then why are you so greedy for all the other offerings which are brought to me ? Why have you honored your sons more than me—for you and they have become fat from the best of the offerings of my people !
TLB	1%20Samuel	2	30	“ Therefore , I , the Lord God of Israel , declare that although I promised that your branch of the tribe of Levi could always be my priests , it is ridiculous to think that what you are doing can continue . I will honor only those who honor me , and I will despise those who despise me .
TLB	1%20Samuel	2	31	I will put an end to your family , so that it will no longer serve as priests . Every member will die before his time . None shall live to be old .
TLB	1%20Samuel	2	32	You will envy the prosperity I will give my people , but you and your family will be in distress and need . Not one of them will live out his days .
TLB	1%20Samuel	2	33	Those who are left alive will live in sadness and grief ; and their children shall die by the sword .
TLB	1%20Samuel	2	34	And to prove that what I have said will come true , I will cause your two sons , Hophni and Phinehas , to die on the same day !
TLB	1%20Samuel	2	35	“ Then I will raise up a faithful priest who will serve me and do whatever I tell him to do . I will bless his descendants , and his family shall be priests to my kings forever .
TLB	1%20Samuel	2	36	Then all of your descendants shall bow before him , begging for money and food . ‘ Please , ’ they will say , ‘ give me a job among the priests so that I will have enough to eat. ’ ” Footnotes -

TLB	1%20Samuel	3	1	Samuel 3:7 Samuel had never had a message from Jehovah before , literally , “ Samuel did not yet know Jehovah. ” The Living Bible copyright ©
TLB	1%20Samuel	3	3	Meanwhile little Samuel was helping the Lord by assisting Eli . Messages from the Lord were very rare in those days , 2-3 but one night after Eli had gone to bed ( he was almost blind with age by now ) , and Samuel was sleeping in the Temple near the Ark , 4-5 the Lord called out , “ Samuel ! Samuel ! ” “ Yes ? ” Samuel replied . “ What is it ? ” He jumped up and ran to Eli . “ Here I am . What do you want ? ” he asked . “ I didn ’ t call you , ” Eli said . “ Go on back to bed. ” So he did .
TLB	1%20Samuel	3	6	Then the Lord called again , “ Samuel ! ” And again Samuel jumped up and ran to Eli . “ Yes ? ” he asked . “ What do you need ? ” “ No , I didn ’ t call you , my son , ” Eli said . “ Go on back to bed. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	3	7	( Samuel had never had a message from Jehovah before . [ a ] )
TLB	1%20Samuel	3	8	So now the Lord called the third time , and once more Samuel jumped up and ran to Eli . “ Yes ? ” he asked . “ What do you need ? ” Then Eli realized it was the Lord who had spoken to the child .
TLB	1%20Samuel	3	9	So he said to Samuel , “ Go and lie down again , and if he calls again , say , ‘ Yes , Lord , I ’ m listening. ’ ” So Samuel went back to bed .
TLB	1%20Samuel	3	10	And the Lord came and called as before , “ Samuel ! Samuel ! ” And Samuel replied , “ Yes , I ’ m listening. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	3	11	Then the Lord said to Samuel , “ I am going to do a shocking thing in Israel .
TLB	1%20Samuel	3	12	I am going to do all of the dreadful things I warned Eli about .
TLB	1%20Samuel	3	13	I have continually threatened him and his entire family with punishment because his sons are blaspheming God , and he doesn ’ t stop them .
TLB	1%20Samuel	3	14	So I have vowed that the sins of Eli and of his sons shall never be forgiven by sacrifices and offerings. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	3	15	Samuel stayed in bed until morning , then opened the doors of the Temple as usual , for he was afraid to tell Eli what the Lord had said to him . 16-17 But Eli called him . “ My son , ” he said , “ what did the Lord say to you ? Tell me everything . And may God punish you if you hide anything from me ! ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	3	18	So Samuel told him what the Lord had said . “ It is the Lord ’ s will , ” Eli replied ; “ let him do what he thinks best. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	3	19	As Samuel grew , the Lord was with him and people listened carefully to his advice .
TLB	1%20Samuel	3	20	And all Israel from one end of the land to the other knew that Samuel was going to be a prophet of the Lord .
TLB	1%20Samuel	3	21	Then the Lord began to give messages to him there at the Tabernacle in Shiloh , Footnotes -

TLB	1%20Samuel	4	1	Samuel 4:12 clothes torn and dirt on his head . This was a common expression of grief in that day . The Living Bible copyright ©
TLB	1%20Samuel	4	4	So they sent for the Ark of the Lord of heaven who is enthroned above the angels . Hophni and Phinehas , the sons of Eli , accompanied it into the battle .
TLB	1%20Samuel	4	2	And the Philistines defeated Israel , killing four thousand of them .
TLB	1%20Samuel	4	3	After the battle was over , the army of Israel returned to their camp and their leaders discussed why the Lord had let them be defeated . “ Let ’ s bring the Ark here from Shiloh , ” they said . “ If we carry it into battle with us , the Lord will be among us and he will surely save us from our enemies. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	4	5	When the Israelis saw the Ark coming , their shout of joy was so loud that it almost made the ground shake !
TLB	1%20Samuel	4	6	“ What ’ s going on ? ” the Philistines asked . “ What ’ s all the shouting about over in the camp of the Hebrews ? ” When they were told it was because the Ark of the Lord had arrived ,
TLB	1%20Samuel	4	7	they panicked . “ God has come into their camp ! ” they cried out . “ Woe upon us , for we have never had to face anything like this before !
TLB	1%20Samuel	4	8	Who can save us from these mighty gods of Israel ? They are the same gods who destroyed the Egyptians with plagues when Israel was in the wilderness .
TLB	1%20Samuel	4	9	Fight as you never have before , O Philistines , or we will become their slaves just as they have been ours. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	4	10	So the Philistines fought desperately and Israel was defeated again . Thirty thousand men of Israel died that day , and the remainder fled to their tents .
TLB	1%20Samuel	4	11	And the Ark of God was captured , and Hophni and Phinehas were killed .
TLB	1%20Samuel	4	12	A man from the tribe of Benjamin ran from the battle and arrived at Shiloh the same day with his clothes torn and dirt on his head . [ a ]
TLB	1%20Samuel	4	13	Eli was waiting beside the road to hear the news of the battle , for his heart trembled for the safety of the Ark of God . As the messenger from the battlefront arrived and told what had happened , a great cry arose throughout the city .
TLB	1%20Samuel	4	14	“ What is all the noise about ? ” Eli asked . And the messenger rushed over to Eli and told him what had happened .
TLB	1%20Samuel	4	15	( Eli was ninety-eight years old and was blind . )
TLB	1%20Samuel	4	16	“ I have just come from the battle—I was there today , ” he told Eli ,
TLB	1%20Samuel	4	17	“ and Israel has been defeated and thousands of the Israeli troops are dead on the battlefield . Hophni and Phinehas were killed too , and the Ark has been captured. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	4	18	When the messenger mentioned what had happened to the Ark , Eli fell backward from his seat beside the gate and his neck was broken by the fall , and he died ( for he was old and fat ) . He had judged Israel for forty years .
TLB	1%20Samuel	4	19	When Eli ’ s daughter-in-law , Phinehas ’ wife , who was pregnant , heard that the Ark had been captured and that her husband and father-in-law were dead , her labor pains suddenly began .
TLB	1%20Samuel	4	20	Just before she died , the women who were attending her told her that everything was all right and that the baby was a boy . But she did not reply or respond in any way . 21-22 Then she murmured , “ Name the child ‘ Ichabod , ’ for Israel ’ s glory is gone. ” ( Ichabod means “ there is no glory. ” She named him this because the Ark of God had been captured and because her husband and her father-in-law were dead . ) Footnotes -

TLB	1%20Samuel	5	1	Samuel
TLB	1%20Samuel	5	5	( That is why to this day neither the priests of Dagon nor his worshipers will walk on the threshold of the temple of Dagon in Ashdod . )
TLB	1%20Samuel	5	3	But when the local citizens went to see it the next morning , Dagon had fallen with his face to the ground before the Ark of Jehovah ! They set him up again ,
TLB	1%20Samuel	5	4	but the next morning the same thing had happened—the idol had fallen face down before the Ark of the Lord again . This time his head and hands had been cut off and were lying in the doorway ; only the trunk of his body was left intact .
TLB	1%20Samuel	5	6	Then the Lord began to destroy the people of Ashdod and the nearby villages with bubonic plague .
TLB	1%20Samuel	5	7	When the people realized what was happening , they exclaimed , “ We can ’ t keep the Ark of the God of Israel here any longer . We will all perish along with our god Dagon. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	5	8	So they called a conference of the mayors of the five cities of the Philistines to decide how to dispose of the Ark . The decision was to take it to Gath .
TLB	1%20Samuel	5	9	But when the Ark arrived at Gath , the Lord began destroying its people , young and old , with the plague , and there was a great panic .
TLB	1%20Samuel	5	10	So they sent the Ark to Ekron , but when the people of Ekron saw it coming they cried out , “ They are bringing the Ark of the God of Israel here to kill us too ! ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	5	11	So they summoned the mayors again and begged them to send the Ark back to its own country , lest the entire city die . For the plague had already begun , and great fear was sweeping across the city .
TLB	1%20Samuel	5	12	Those who didn ’ t die were deathly ill ; and there was weeping everywhere . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	1%20Samuel	6	1	Samuel 6:9 return to their calves , implied . The Living Bible copyright ©
TLB	1%20Samuel	6	6	Don ’ t be stubborn and rebellious as Pharaoh and the Egyptians were . They wouldn ’ t let Israel go until God had destroyed them with dreadful plagues .
TLB	1%20Samuel	6	2	Then the Philistines called for their priests and diviners and asked them , “ What shall we do about the Ark of God ? What sort of gift shall we send with it when we return it to its own land ? ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	6	3	“ Yes , send it back with a gift , ” they were told . “ Send a guilt offering so that the plague will stop . Then , if it doesn ’ t , you will know God didn ’ t send the plague upon you after all. ” 4-5 “ What guilt offering shall we send ? ” they asked . And they were told , “ Send five gold models of the tumor caused by the plague , and five gold models of the rats that have ravaged the whole land—the capital cities and villages alike . If you send these gifts and then praise the God of Israel , perhaps he will stop persecuting you and your god .
TLB	1%20Samuel	6	7	Now build a new cart and hitch to it two cows that have just had calves—cows that never before have been yoked—and shut their calves away from them in the barn .
TLB	1%20Samuel	6	8	Place the Ark of God on the cart beside a chest containing the gold models of the rats and tumors , and let the cows go wherever they want to .
TLB	1%20Samuel	6	9	If they cross the border of our land and go into Beth-shemesh , then you will know that it was God who brought this great evil upon us ; if they don ’ t but return to their calves , [ a ] then we will know that the plague was simply a coincidence and was not sent by God at all. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	6	10	So these instructions were carried out . Two cows with newborn calves were hitched to the cart and their calves were shut up in the barn .
TLB	1%20Samuel	6	11	Then the Ark of the Lord and the chest containing the gold rats and tumors were placed upon the cart .
TLB	1%20Samuel	6	12	And sure enough , the cows went straight along the road toward Beth-shemesh , lowing as they went ; and the Philistine mayors followed them as far as the border of Beth-shemesh .
TLB	1%20Samuel	6	13	The people of Beth-shemesh were reaping wheat in the valley , and when they saw the Ark , they went wild with joy !
TLB	1%20Samuel	6	14	The cart came into the field of a man named Joshua and stopped beside a large rock . So the people broke up the wood of the cart for a fire and killed the cows and sacrificed them to the Lord as a burnt offering .
TLB	1%20Samuel	6	15	Several men of the tribe of Levi lifted the Ark and the chest containing the gold rats and tumors from the cart and laid them on the rock . And many burnt offerings and sacrifices were offered to the Lord that day by the men of Beth-shemesh .
TLB	1%20Samuel	6	16	After the five Philistine mayors had watched for a while , they returned to Ekron that same day .
TLB	1%20Samuel	6	17	The five gold models of tumors which had been sent by the Philistines as a guilt offering to the Lord were gifts from the mayors of the capital cities , Ashdod , Gaza , Ashkelon , Gath , and Ekron .
TLB	1%20Samuel	6	18	The gold rats were to placate God for the other Philistine cities , both the fortified cities and the country villages controlled by the five capitals . ( By the way , that large rock at Beth-shemesh can still be seen in the field of Joshua . )
TLB	1%20Samuel	6	19	But the Lord killed seventy of the men of Beth-shemesh because they looked into the Ark . And the people mourned because of the many people whom the Lord had killed .
TLB	1%20Samuel	6	20	“ Who is able to stand before Jehovah , this holy God ? ” they cried out . “ Where can we send the Ark from here ? ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	6	21	So they sent messengers to the people at Kiriath-jearim and told them that the Philistines had brought back the Ark of the Lord . “ Come and get it ! ” they begged . Footnotes -

TLB	1%20Samuel	7	1	Samuel
TLB	1%20Samuel	7	7	When the Philistine leaders heard about the great crowds at Mizpah , they mobilized their army and advanced . The Israelis were badly frightened when they learned that the Philistines were approaching .
TLB	1%20Samuel	7	2	The Ark remained there for twenty years , and during that time all Israel was in sorrow because the Lord had seemingly abandoned them .
TLB	1%20Samuel	7	3	At that time Samuel said to them , “ If you are really serious about wanting to return to the Lord , get rid of your foreign gods and your Ashtaroth idols . Determine to obey only the Lord ; then he will rescue you from the Philistines. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	7	4	So they destroyed their idols of Baal and Ashtaroth and worshiped only the Lord .
TLB	1%20Samuel	7	5	Then Samuel told them , “ Come to Mizpah , all of you , and I will pray to the Lord for you. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	7	6	So they gathered there and , in a great ceremony , drew water from the well and poured it out before the Lord . They also went without food all day as a sign of sorrow for their sins . So it was at Mizpah that Samuel became Israel ’ s judge .
TLB	1%20Samuel	7	8	“ Plead with God to save us ! ” they begged Samuel .
TLB	1%20Samuel	7	9	So Samuel took a suckling lamb and offered it to the Lord as a whole burnt offering and pleaded with him to help Israel . And the Lord responded .
TLB	1%20Samuel	7	10	Just as Samuel was sacrificing the burnt offering , the Philistines arrived for battle , but the Lord spoke with a mighty voice of thunder from heaven , and they were thrown into confusion , and the Israelis routed them
TLB	1%20Samuel	7	11	and chased them from Mizpah to Beth-car , killing them all along the way .
TLB	1%20Samuel	7	12	Samuel then took a stone and placed it between Mizpah and Jeshanah and named it Ebenezer ( meaning , “ the Stone of Help ” ) , for he said , “ The Lord has certainly helped us ! ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	7	13	So the Philistines were subdued and didn ’ t invade Israel again at that time because the Lord was against them throughout the remainder of Samuel ’ s lifetime .
TLB	1%20Samuel	7	14	The Israeli cities between Ekron and Gath , which had been conquered by the Philistines , were now returned to Israel , for the Israeli army rescued them from their Philistine captors . And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites in those days .
TLB	1%20Samuel	7	15	Samuel continued as Israel ’ s judge for the remainder of his life .
TLB	1%20Samuel	7	16	He rode circuit annually , setting up his court first at Bethel , then Gilgal , and then Mizpah , and cases of dispute were brought to him in each of those three cities from all the surrounding territory .
TLB	1%20Samuel	7	17	Then he would come back to Ramah , for his home was there , and he would hear cases there too . And he built an altar to the Lord at Ramah . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	1%20Samuel	8	1	Samuel
TLB	1%20Samuel	8	8	Ever since I brought them from Egypt they have continually forsaken me and followed other gods . And now they are giving you the same treatment .
TLB	1%20Samuel	8	2	Joel and Abijah , his oldest sons , held court in Beersheba ;
TLB	1%20Samuel	8	3	but they were not like their father , for they were greedy for money . They accepted bribes and were very corrupt in the administration of justice .
TLB	1%20Samuel	8	4	Finally the leaders of Israel met in Ramah to discuss the matter with Samuel .
TLB	1%20Samuel	8	5	They told him that since his retirement things hadn ’ t been the same , for his sons were not good men . “ Give us a king like all the other nations have , ” they pleaded .
TLB	1%20Samuel	8	6	Samuel was terribly upset and went to the Lord for advice .
TLB	1%20Samuel	8	7	“ Do as they say , ” the Lord replied , “ for I am the one they are rejecting , not you—they don ’ t want me to be their king any longer .
TLB	1%20Samuel	8	9	Do as they ask , but warn them about what it will be like to have a king ! ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	8	10	So Samuel told the people what the Lord had said :
TLB	1%20Samuel	8	11	“ If you insist on having a king , he will conscript your sons and make them run before his chariots ;
TLB	1%20Samuel	8	12	some will be made to lead his troops into battle , while others will be slave laborers ; they will be forced to plow in the royal fields and harvest his crops without pay , and make his weapons and chariot equipment .
TLB	1%20Samuel	8	13	He will take your daughters from you and force them to cook and bake and make perfumes for him .
TLB	1%20Samuel	8	14	He will take away the best of your fields and vineyards and olive groves and give them to his friends .
TLB	1%20Samuel	8	15	He will take a tenth of your harvest and distribute it to his favorites .
TLB	1%20Samuel	8	16	He will demand your slaves and the finest of your youth and will use your animals for his personal gain .
TLB	1%20Samuel	8	17	He will demand a tenth of your flocks , and you shall be his slaves .
TLB	1%20Samuel	8	18	You will shed bitter tears because of this king you are demanding , but the Lord will not help you. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	8	19	But the people refused to listen to Samuel ’ s warning . “ Even so , we still want a king , ” they said ,
TLB	1%20Samuel	8	20	“ for we want to be like the nations around us . He will govern us and lead us to battle. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	8	21	So Samuel told the Lord what the people had said ,
TLB	1%20Samuel	8	22	and the Lord replied again , “ Then do as they say and give them a king. ” So Samuel agreed and sent the men home again . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	1%20Samuel	9	1	Samuel
TLB	1%20Samuel	9	9	Kish was a rich , influential man from the tribe of Benjamin . He was the son of Abiel , grandson of Zeror , great-grandson of Becorath , and great-great-grandson of Aphiah .
TLB	1%20Samuel	9	2	His son Saul was the most handsome man in Israel . And he was head and shoulders taller than anyone else in the land !
TLB	1%20Samuel	9	3	One day Kish ’ s donkeys strayed away , so he sent Saul and a servant to look for them .
TLB	1%20Samuel	9	4	They traveled all through the hill country of Ephraim , the land of Shalisha , the Shaalim area , and the entire land of Benjamin , but couldn ’ t find them anywhere .
TLB	1%20Samuel	9	5	Finally , after searching in the land of Zuph , Saul said to the servant , “ Let ’ s go home ; by now my father will be more worried about us than about the donkeys ! ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	9	6	But the servant said , “ I ’ ve just thought of something ! There is a prophet who lives here in this city ; he is held in high honor by all the people because everything he says comes true ; let ’ s go and find him , and perhaps he can tell us where the donkeys are. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	9	7	“ But we don ’ t have anything to pay him with , ” Saul replied . “ Even our food is gone , and we don ’ t have a thing to give him. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	9	8	“ Well , ” the servant said , “ I have a dollar ! We can at least offer it to him and see what happens ! ” 9-11 “ All right , ” Saul agreed , “ let ’ s try it ! ” So they started into the city where the prophet lived . As they were climbing a hill toward the city , they saw some young girls going out to draw water and asked them if they knew whether the seer was in town . ( In those days prophets were called seers . “ Let ’ s go and ask the seer , ” people would say , rather than , “ Let ’ s go and ask the prophet , ” as we would say now . ) 12-13 “ Yes , ” they replied , “ stay right on this road . He lives just inside the city gates . He has just arrived back from a trip to take part in a public sacrifice up on the hill . So hurry , because he ’ ll probably be leaving about the time you get there ; the guests can ’ t eat until he arrives and blesses the food. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	9	14	So they went into the city , and as they were entering the gates they saw Samuel coming out toward them to go up the hill .
TLB	1%20Samuel	9	15	The Lord had told Samuel the previous day ,
TLB	1%20Samuel	9	16	“ About this time tomorrow I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin . You are to anoint him as the leader of my people . He will save them from the Philistines , for I have looked down on them in mercy and have heard their cry. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	9	17	When Samuel saw Saul , the Lord said , “ That ’ s the man I told you about ! He will rule my people. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	9	18	Just then Saul approached Samuel and asked , “ Can you please tell me where the seer ’ s house is ? ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	9	19	“ I am the seer ! ” Samuel replied . “ Go on up the hill ahead of me and we ’ ll eat together ; in the morning I will tell you what you want to know and send you on your way .
TLB	1%20Samuel	9	20	And don ’ t worry about those donkeys that were lost three days ago , for they have been found . And anyway , you own all the wealth of Israel now ! ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	9	21	“ Pardon me , sir , ” Saul replied . “ I ’ m from the tribe of Benjamin , the smallest in Israel , and my family is the least important of all the families of the tribe ! You must have the wrong man ! ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	9	22	Then Samuel took Saul and his servant into the great hall and placed them at the head of the table , honoring them above the thirty special guests .
TLB	1%20Samuel	9	23	Samuel then instructed the chef to bring Saul the choicest cut of meat , the piece that had been set aside for the guest of honor .
TLB	1%20Samuel	9	24	So the chef brought it in and placed it before Saul . “ Go ahead and eat it , ” Samuel said , “ for I was saving it for you , even before I invited these others ! ” So Saul ate with Samuel .
TLB	1%20Samuel	9	25	After the feast , when they had returned to the city , Samuel took Saul up to the porch on the roof and talked with him there . 26-27 At daybreak the next morning , Samuel called up to him , “ Get up ; it ’ s time you were on your way ! ” So Saul got up , and Samuel accompanied him to the edge of the city . When they reached the city walls , Samuel told Saul to send the servant on ahead . Then he told him , “ I have received a special message for you from the Lord. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	1%20Samuel	10	1	Samuel 10:12 Is Saul a prophet too ? This was an expression of surprise concerning worldly Saul becoming religious , equivalent to our “ He ’ s got religion ? ” The Living Bible copyright ©
TLB	1%20Samuel	10	10	When Saul and the servant arrived at the Hill of God , they saw the prophets coming toward them , and the Spirit of God came upon him , and he too began to prophesy .
TLB	1%20Samuel	10	2	When you leave me , you will see two men beside Rachel ’ s tomb at Zelzah , in the land of Benjamin ; they will tell you that the donkeys have been found and that your father is worried about you and is asking , ‘ How am I to find my son ? ’
TLB	1%20Samuel	10	3	And when you get to the oak of Tabor , you will see three men coming toward you who are on their way to worship God at the altar at Bethel ; one will be bringing three young goats , another will have three loaves of bread , and the third will have a bottle of wine .
TLB	1%20Samuel	10	4	They will greet you and offer you two of the loaves , which you are to accept .
TLB	1%20Samuel	10	5	After that you will come to Gibeath-elohim , also known as “ God ’ s Hill , ” where the garrison of the Philistines is . As you arrive there you will meet a band of prophets coming down the hill playing a psaltery , a timbrel , a flute , and a harp , and prophesying as they come .
TLB	1%20Samuel	10	6	“ At that time the Spirit of the Lord will come mightily upon you and you will prophesy with them , and you will feel and act like a different person .
TLB	1%20Samuel	10	7	From that time on your decisions should be based on whatever seems best under the circumstances , for the Lord will guide you .
TLB	1%20Samuel	10	8	Go to Gilgal and wait there seven days for me , for I will be coming to sacrifice burnt offerings and peace offerings . I will give you further instructions when I arrive. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	10	9	As Saul said good-bye and started to go , God gave him a new attitude , and all of Samuel ’ s prophecies came true that day .
TLB	1%20Samuel	10	11	When his friends heard about it , they exclaimed , “ What ? Saul a prophet ? ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	10	12	And one of the neighbors added , “ With a father like his ? ” So that is the origin of the proverb , “ Is Saul a prophet too ? ” [ a ]
TLB	1%20Samuel	10	13	When Saul had finished prophesying he climbed the hill to the altar .
TLB	1%20Samuel	10	14	“ Where in the world did you go ? ” Saul ’ s uncle asked him . And Saul replied , “ We went to look for the donkeys , but we couldn ’ t find them ; so we went to the prophet Samuel to ask him where they were. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	10	15	“ Oh ? And what did he say ? ” his uncle asked .
TLB	1%20Samuel	10	16	“ He said the donkeys had been found ! ” Saul replied . ( But he didn ’ t tell him that he had been anointed as king ! )
TLB	1%20Samuel	10	17	Samuel now called a convocation of all Israel at Mizpah 18-19 and gave them this message from the Lord God : “ I brought you from Egypt and rescued you from the Egyptians and from all of the nations that were torturing you . But although I have done so much for you , you have rejected me and have said , ‘ We want a king instead ! ’ All right , then , present yourselves before the Lord by tribes and clans. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	10	20	So Samuel called the tribal leaders together before the Lord , and the tribe of Benjamin was chosen by sacred lot .
TLB	1%20Samuel	10	21	Then he brought each family of the tribe of Benjamin before the Lord , and the family of the Matrites was chosen . And finally the sacred lot selected Saul , the son of Kish . But when they looked for him , he had disappeared !
TLB	1%20Samuel	10	22	So they asked the Lord , “ Where is he ? Is he here among us ? ” And the Lord replied , “ He is hiding in the baggage. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	10	23	So they found him and brought him out , and he stood head and shoulders above anyone else .
TLB	1%20Samuel	10	24	Then Samuel said to all the people , “ This is the man the Lord has chosen as your king . There isn ’ t his equal in all of Israel ! ” And all the people shouted , “ Long live the king ! ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	10	25	Then Samuel told the people again what the rights and duties of a king were ; he wrote them in a book and put it in a special place before the Lord . Then Samuel sent the people home again .
TLB	1%20Samuel	10	26	When Saul returned to his home at Gibeah , a band of men whose hearts the Lord had touched became his constant companions .
TLB	1%20Samuel	10	27	There were , however , some bums and loafers who exclaimed , “ How can this man save us ? ” And they despised him and refused to bring him presents , but he took no notice . Footnotes -

TLB	1%20Samuel	11	1	Samuel
TLB	1%20Samuel	11	11	But early the next morning Saul arrived , having divided his army into three detachments , and launched a surprise attack against the Ammonites and slaughtered them all morning . The remnant of their army was so badly scattered that no two of them were left together .
TLB	1%20Samuel	11	2	“ All right , ” Nahash said , “ but only on one condition : I will gouge out the right eye of every one of you as a disgrace upon all Israel ! ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	11	3	“ Give us seven days to see if we can get some help ! ” replied the elders of Jabesh . “ If none of our brothers will come and save us , we will agree to your terms. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	11	4	When a messenger came to Gibeah , Saul ’ s hometown , and told the people about their plight , everyone broke into tears .
TLB	1%20Samuel	11	5	Saul was plowing in the field , and when he returned to town he asked , “ What ’ s the matter ? Why is everyone crying ? ” So they told him about the message from Jabesh .
TLB	1%20Samuel	11	6	Then the Spirit of God came strongly upon Saul and he became very angry .
TLB	1%20Samuel	11	7	He took two oxen and cut them into pieces and sent messengers to carry them throughout all Israel . “ This is what will happen to the oxen of anyone who refuses to follow Saul and Samuel to battle ! ” he announced . And God caused the people to be afraid of Saul ’ s anger , and they came to him as one man .
TLB	1%20Samuel	11	8	He counted them in Bezek and found that there were three hundred thousand of them in addition to thirty thousand from Judah .
TLB	1%20Samuel	11	9	So he sent the messengers back to Jabesh-gilead to say , “ We will rescue you before tomorrow noon ! ” What joy there was throughout the city when that message arrived !
TLB	1%20Samuel	11	10	The men of Jabesh then told their enemies , “ We surrender . Tomorrow we will come out to you and you can do to us as you wish. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	11	12	Then the people exclaimed to Samuel , “ Where are those men who said that Saul shouldn ’ t be our king ? Bring them here and we will kill them ! ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	11	13	But Saul replied , “ No one will be executed today ; for today the Lord has rescued Israel ! ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	11	14	Then Samuel said to the people , “ Come , let us all go to Gilgal and reconfirm Saul as our king. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	11	15	So they went to Gilgal and in a solemn ceremony before the Lord they crowned him king . Then they offered peace offerings to the Lord , and Saul and all Israel were very happy . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	1%20Samuel	12	1	Samuel
TLB	1%20Samuel	12	12	“ But when you were afraid of Nahash , the king of Ammon , you came to me and said that you wanted a king to reign over you . But the Lord your God was already your King , for he has always been your King .
TLB	1%20Samuel	12	2	I have selected him ahead of my own sons and now I stand here , an old , gray-haired man who has been in public service from the time he was a lad .
TLB	1%20Samuel	12	3	Now tell me as I stand before the Lord and before his anointed king—whose ox or donkey have I stolen ? Have I ever defrauded you ? Have I ever oppressed you ? Have I ever taken a bribe ? Tell me and I will make right whatever I have done wrong. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	12	4	“ No , ” they replied , “ you have never defrauded or oppressed us in any way and you have never taken even one single bribe. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	12	5	“ The Lord and his anointed king are my witnesses , ” Samuel declared , “ that you can never accuse me of robbing you. ” “ Yes , it is true , ” they replied .
TLB	1%20Samuel	12	6	“ It was the Lord who appointed Moses and Aaron , ” Samuel continued . “ He brought your ancestors out of the land of Egypt .
TLB	1%20Samuel	12	7	“ Now stand here quietly before the Lord as I remind you of all the good things he has done for you and for your ancestors :
TLB	1%20Samuel	12	8	“ When the Israelites were in Egypt and cried out to the Lord , he sent Moses and Aaron to bring them into this land .
TLB	1%20Samuel	12	9	But they soon forgot about the Lord their God , so he let them be conquered by Sisera , the general of King Hazor ’ s army , and by the Philistines and the king of Moab .
TLB	1%20Samuel	12	10	“ Then they cried to the Lord again and confessed that they had sinned by turning away from him and worshiping the Baal and Ashtaroth idols . And they pleaded , ‘ We will worship you and you alone if you will only rescue us from our enemies. ’
TLB	1%20Samuel	12	11	Then the Lord sent Gideon , Barak , Jephthah , and Samuel to save you , and you lived in safety .
TLB	1%20Samuel	12	13	All right , here is the king you have chosen . Look him over . You have asked for him , and the Lord has answered your request .
TLB	1%20Samuel	12	14	“ Now if you will fear and worship the Lord , and listen to his commandments and not rebel against the Lord , and if both you and your king follow the Lord your God , then all will be well .
TLB	1%20Samuel	12	15	But if you rebel against the Lord ’ s commandments and refuse to listen to him , then his hand will be as heavy upon you as it was upon your ancestors .
TLB	1%20Samuel	12	16	“ Now watch as the Lord does great miracles .
TLB	1%20Samuel	12	17	You know that it does not rain at this time of the year , during the wheat harvest ; I will pray for the Lord to send thunder and rain today , so that you will realize the extent of your wickedness in asking for a king ! ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	12	18	So Samuel called to the Lord , and the Lord sent thunder and rain ; and all the people were very much afraid of the Lord and of Samuel .
TLB	1%20Samuel	12	19	“ Pray for us lest we die ! ” they cried out to Samuel . “ For now we have added to all our other sins by asking for a king. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	12	20	“ Don ’ t be frightened , ” Samuel reassured them . “ You have certainly done wrong , but make sure now that you worship the Lord with true enthusiasm , and that you don ’ t turn your back on him in any way .
TLB	1%20Samuel	12	21	Other gods can ’ t help you .
TLB	1%20Samuel	12	22	The Lord will not abandon his chosen people , for that would dishonor his great name . He made you a special nation for himself—just because he wanted to !
TLB	1%20Samuel	12	23	“ As for me , I will certainly not sin against the Lord by ending my prayers for you ; and I will continue to teach you those things which are good and right .
TLB	1%20Samuel	12	24	“ Trust the Lord and sincerely worship him ; think of all the tremendous things he has done for you .
TLB	1%20Samuel	12	25	But if you continue to sin , you and your king will be destroyed. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	1%20Samuel	13	1	Samuel 13:1 Saul had reigned for one year . The Hebrew , from which the numbers have evidently dropped out in copying , reads : “ Saul was . . . years old when he began to reign , and he reigned . . . and two years over Israel. ” The Living Bible copyright ©
TLB	1%20Samuel	13	13	“ You fool ! ” Samuel exclaimed . “ You have disobeyed the commandment of the Lord your God . He was planning to make you and your descendants kings of Israel forever ,
TLB	1%20Samuel	13	2	he selected three thousand special troops and took two thousand of them with him to Michmash and Mount Bethel while the other thousand remained with Jonathan , Saul ’ s son , in Gibeah in the land of Benjamin . The rest of the army was sent home . 3-4 Then Jonathan attacked and destroyed the garrison of the Philistines at Geba . The news spread quickly throughout the land of the Philistines , and Saul sounded the call to arms throughout Israel . He announced that he had destroyed the Philistine garrison and warned his men that the army of Israel stank to high heaven as far as the Philistines were concerned . So the entire Israeli army mobilized again and joined at Gilgal .
TLB	1%20Samuel	13	5	The Philistines recruited a mighty army of three thousand chariots , six thousand horsemen , and so many soldiers that they were as thick as sand along the seashore ; and they camped at Michmash east of Beth-aven .
TLB	1%20Samuel	13	6	When the men of Israel saw the vast mass of enemy troops , they lost their nerve entirely and tried to hide in caves , thickets , coverts , among the rocks , and even in tombs and cisterns .
TLB	1%20Samuel	13	7	Some of them crossed the Jordan River and escaped to the land of Gad and Gilead . Meanwhile , Saul stayed at Gilgal , and those who were with him trembled with fear at what awaited them .
TLB	1%20Samuel	13	8	Samuel had told Saul earlier to wait seven days for his arrival , but when he still didn ’ t come , and Saul ’ s troops were rapidly slipping away ,
TLB	1%20Samuel	13	9	he decided to sacrifice the burnt offering and the peace offerings himself .
TLB	1%20Samuel	13	10	But just as he was finishing , Samuel arrived . Saul went out to meet him and to receive his blessing ,
TLB	1%20Samuel	13	11	but Samuel said , “ What is this you have done ? ” “ Well , ” Saul replied , “ when I saw that my men were scattering from me , and that you hadn ’ t arrived by the time you said you would , and that the Philistines were at Michmash , ready for battle ,
TLB	1%20Samuel	13	12	I said , ‘ The Philistines are ready to march against us and I haven ’ t even asked for the Lord ’ s help ! ’ So I reluctantly offered the burnt offering without waiting for you to arrive. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	13	14	but now your dynasty must end ; for the Lord wants a man who will obey him . And he has discovered the man he wants and has already appointed him as king over his people ; for you have not obeyed the Lord ’ s commandment. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	13	15	Samuel then left Gilgal and went to Gibeah in the land of Benjamin . When Saul counted the soldiers who were still with him , he found only six hundred left !
TLB	1%20Samuel	13	16	Saul and Jonathan and these six hundred men set up their camp in Geba in the land of Benjamin ; but the Philistines stayed at Michmash .
TLB	1%20Samuel	13	17	Three companies of raiders soon left the camp of the Philistines ; one went toward Ophrah in the land of Shual ,
TLB	1%20Samuel	13	18	another went to Beth-horon , and the third moved toward the border above the valley of Zeboim near the desert .
TLB	1%20Samuel	13	19	There were no blacksmiths at all in the land of Israel in those days , for the Philistines wouldn ’ t allow them for fear of their making swords and spears for the Hebrews .
TLB	1%20Samuel	13	20	So whenever the Israelites needed to sharpen their plowshares , discs , axes , or sickles , they had to take them to a Philistine blacksmith .
TLB	1%20Samuel	13	21	The schedule of charges was as follows : For sharpening a plow point , 60¢ For sharpening a disc , 60¢ For sharpening an ax , 30¢ For sharpening a sickle , 30¢ For sharpening an ox goad , 30¢
TLB	1%20Samuel	13	22	So there was not a single sword or spear in the entire “ army ” of Israel that day , except for Saul ’ s and Jonathan ’ s .
TLB	1%20Samuel	13	23	The mountain pass at Michmash had meanwhile been secured by a contingent of the Philistine army . Footnotes -

TLB	1%20Samuel	14	14	about twenty men in all , and their bodies were scattered over about half an acre of land .
TLB	1%20Samuel	14	2	Saul and his six hundred men were camped at the edge of Gibeah , around the pomegranate tree at Migron .
TLB	1%20Samuel	14	3	Among his men was Ahijah the priest ( the son of Ahitub , Ichabod ’ s brother ; Ahitub was the son of Phinehas and the grandson of Eli , the priest of the Lord in Shiloh ) . No one realized that Jonathan had gone .
TLB	1%20Samuel	14	4	To reach the Philistine garrison , Jonathan had to go over a narrow pass between two rocky crags which had been named Bozez and Seneh .
TLB	1%20Samuel	14	5	The crag on the north was in front of Michmash and the southern one was in front of Geba .
TLB	1%20Samuel	14	6	“ Yes , let ’ s go across to those heathen , ” Jonathan had said to his bodyguard . “ Perhaps the Lord will do a miracle for us . For it makes no difference to him how many enemy troops there are ! ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	14	7	“ Fine ! ” the youth replied . “ Do as you think best ; I ’ m with you heart and soul , whatever you decide. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	14	8	“ All right , then this is what we ’ ll do , ” Jonathan told him .
TLB	1%20Samuel	14	9	“ When they see us , if they say , ‘ Stay where you are or we ’ ll kill you ! ’ then we will stop and wait for them .
TLB	1%20Samuel	14	10	But if they say , ‘ Come on up and fight ! ’ then we will do just that ; for it will be God ’ s signal that he will help us defeat them ! ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	14	11	When the Philistines saw them coming they shouted , “ Look ! The Israelis are crawling out of their holes ! ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	14	12	Then they shouted to Jonathan , “ Come on up here and we ’ ll show you how to fight ! ” “ Come on , climb right behind me , ” Jonathan exclaimed to his bodyguard , “ for the Lord will help us defeat them ! ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	14	13	So they clambered up on their hands and knees , and the Philistines fell back as Jonathan and the lad killed them right and left ,
TLB	1%20Samuel	14	15	Suddenly panic broke out throughout the entire Philistine army , and even among the raiders . And just then there was a great earthquake , increasing the terror .
TLB	1%20Samuel	14	16	Saul ’ s lookouts in Gibeah saw a strange sight—the vast army of the Philistines began to melt away in all directions .
TLB	1%20Samuel	14	17	“ Find out who isn ’ t here , ” Saul ordered . And when they had checked , they found that Jonathan and his bodyguard were gone .
TLB	1%20Samuel	14	18	“ Bring the Ark of God , ” Saul shouted to Ahijah . ( For the Ark was among the people of Israel at that time . )
TLB	1%20Samuel	14	19	But while Saul was talking to the priest , the shouting and the tumult in the camp of the Philistines grew louder and louder . “ Quick ! What does God say ? ” Saul demanded .
TLB	1%20Samuel	14	20	Then Saul and his six hundred men rushed out to the battle and found the Philistines killing each other , and there was terrible confusion everywhere .
TLB	1%20Samuel	14	21	And now the Hebrews who had been drafted into the Philistine army revolted and joined with the Israelis .
TLB	1%20Samuel	14	22	Finally even the men hiding in the hills joined the chase when they saw that the Philistines were running away .
TLB	1%20Samuel	14	23	So the Lord saved Israel that day , and the battle continued out beyond Beth-aven . 24-25 Saul had declared , “ A curse upon anyone who eats anything before evening—before I have full revenge on my enemies. ” So no one ate anything all day , even though they found honeycomb on the ground in the forest ,
TLB	1%20Samuel	14	26	for they all feared Saul ’ s curse .
TLB	1%20Samuel	14	27	Jonathan , however , had not heard his father ’ s command ; so he dipped a stick into a honeycomb , and when he had eaten the honey he felt much better .
TLB	1%20Samuel	14	28	Then someone told him that his father had laid a curse upon anyone who ate food that day , and everyone was weary and faint as a result .
TLB	1%20Samuel	14	29	“ That ’ s ridiculous ! ” Jonathan exclaimed . “ A command like that only hurts us . See how much better I feel now that I have eaten this little bit of honey .
TLB	1%20Samuel	14	30	If the people had been allowed to eat freely from the food they found among our enemies , think how many more we could have slaughtered ! ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	14	31	But hungry as they were , they chased and killed the Philistines all day from Michmash to Aijalon , growing more and more faint .
TLB	1%20Samuel	14	32	That evening [ a ] they flew upon the battle loot and butchered the sheep , oxen , and calves , and ate the raw , bloody meat .
TLB	1%20Samuel	14	33	Someone reported to Saul what was happening , that the people were sinning against the Lord by eating blood . “ That is very wrong , ” Saul said . “ Roll a great stone over here ,
TLB	1%20Samuel	14	34	and go out among the troops and tell them to bring the oxen and sheep here to kill and drain them , and not to sin against the Lord by eating the blood. ” So that is what they did .
TLB	1%20Samuel	14	35	And Saul built an altar to the Lord—his first .
TLB	1%20Samuel	14	36	Afterwards Saul said , “ Let ’ s chase the Philistines all night and destroy every last one of them. ” “ Fine ! ” his men replied . “ Do as you think best. ” But the priest said , “ Let ’ s ask God first. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	14	37	So Saul asked God , “ Shall we go after the Philistines ? Will you help us defeat them ? ” But the Lord made no reply all night .
TLB	1%20Samuel	14	38	Then Saul said to the leaders , “ Something ’ s wrong ! [ b ] We must find out what sin was committed today .
TLB	1%20Samuel	14	39	I vow by the name of the God who saved Israel that though the sinner be my own son Jonathan , he shall surely die ! ” But no one would tell him what the trouble was .
TLB	1%20Samuel	14	40	Then Saul proposed , “ Jonathan and I will stand over here , and all of you stand over there. ” And the people agreed .
TLB	1%20Samuel	14	41	Then Saul said , “ O Lord God of Israel , why haven ’ t you answered my question ? What is wrong ? Are Jonathan and I guilty , or is the sin among the others ? O Lord God , show us who is guilty. ” And Jonathan and Saul were chosen by sacred lot as the guilty ones , and the people were declared innocent .
TLB	1%20Samuel	14	42	Then Saul said , “ Now draw lots between me and Jonathan. ” And Jonathan was chosen as the guilty one .
TLB	1%20Samuel	14	43	“ Tell me what you ’ ve done , ” Saul demanded of Jonathan . “ I tasted a little honey , ” Jonathan admitted . “ It was only a little bit on the end of a stick ; but now I must die. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	14	44	“ Yes , Jonathan , ” Saul said , “ you must die ; may God strike me dead if you are not executed for this. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	14	45	But the troops retorted , “ Jonathan , who saved Israel today , shall die ? Far from it ! We vow by the life of God that not one hair on his head will be touched , for he has been used of God to do a mighty miracle today. ” So the people rescued Jonathan .
TLB	1%20Samuel	14	46	Then Saul called back the army , and the Philistines returned home .
TLB	1%20Samuel	14	47	And now , since he was securely in the saddle as king of Israel , Saul sent the Israeli army out in every direction against Moab , Ammon , Edom , the kings of Zobah , and the Philistines . And wherever he turned , he was successful .
TLB	1%20Samuel	14	48	He did great deeds and conquered the Amalekites and saved Israel from all those who had been their conquerors .
TLB	1%20Samuel	14	49	Saul had three sons , Jonathan , Ishvi , and Malchishua ; and two daughters , Merab and Michal . 50-51 Saul ’ s wife was Ahinoam , the daughter of Ahimaaz . And the general-in-chief of his army was his cousin Abner , his uncle Ner ’ s son . ( Abner ’ s father , Ner , and Saul ’ s father , Kish , were brothers ; both were the sons of Abiel . )
TLB	1%20Samuel	14	52	The Israelis fought constantly with the Philistines throughout Saul ’ s lifetime . And whenever Saul saw any brave , strong young man , he conscripted him into his army . Footnotes -

TLB	1%20Samuel	15	1	Samuel
TLB	1%20Samuel	15	15	“ It ’ s true that the army spared the best of the sheep and oxen , ” Saul admitted , “ but they are going to sacrifice them to the Lord your God ; and we have destroyed everything else. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	15	2	Here is his commandment to you : ‘ I have decided to settle accounts with the nation of Amalek for refusing to allow my people to cross their territory when Israel came from Egypt .
TLB	1%20Samuel	15	3	Now go and completely destroy the entire Amalek nation—men , women , babies , little children , oxen , sheep , camels , and donkeys. ’ ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	15	4	So Saul mobilized his army at Telaim . There were two hundred thousand troops in addition to ten thousand men from Judah .
TLB	1%20Samuel	15	5	The Amalekites were camped in the valley below them .
TLB	1%20Samuel	15	6	Saul sent a message to the Kenites , telling them to get out from among the Amalekites or else die with them . “ For you were kind to the people of Israel when they came out of the land of Egypt , ” he explained . So the Kenites packed up and left .
TLB	1%20Samuel	15	7	Then Saul butchered the Amalekites from Havilah all the way to Shur , east of Egypt .
TLB	1%20Samuel	15	8	He captured Agag , the king of the Amalekites , but killed everyone else .
TLB	1%20Samuel	15	9	However , Saul and his men kept the best of the sheep and oxen and the fattest of the lambs—everything , in fact , that appealed to them . They destroyed only what was worthless or of poor quality .
TLB	1%20Samuel	15	10	Then the Lord said to Samuel ,
TLB	1%20Samuel	15	11	“ I am sorry that I ever made Saul king , for he has again refused to obey me. ” Samuel was so deeply moved when he heard what God was saying , that he cried to the Lord all night .
TLB	1%20Samuel	15	12	Early the next morning he went out to find Saul . Someone said that he had gone to Mount Carmel to erect a monument to himself and had then gone on to Gilgal .
TLB	1%20Samuel	15	13	When Samuel finally found him , Saul greeted him cheerfully . “ Hello there , ” he said . “ Well , I have carried out the Lord ’ s command ! ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	15	14	“ Then what was all the bleating of sheep and lowing of oxen I heard ? ” Samuel demanded .
TLB	1%20Samuel	15	16	Then Samuel said to Saul , “ Stop ! Listen to what the Lord told me last night ! ” “ What was it ? ” Saul asked .
TLB	1%20Samuel	15	17	And Samuel told him , “ When you didn ’ t think much of yourself , God made you king of Israel .
TLB	1%20Samuel	15	18	And he sent you on an errand and told you , ‘ Go and completely destroy the sinners , the Amalekites , until they are all dead. ’
TLB	1%20Samuel	15	19	Then why didn ’ t you obey the Lord ? Why did you rush for the loot and do exactly what God said not to ? ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	15	20	“ But I have obeyed the Lord , ” Saul insisted . “ I did what he told me to ; and I brought King Agag but killed everyone else .
TLB	1%20Samuel	15	21	And it was only when my troops demanded it that I let them keep the best of the sheep and oxen and loot to sacrifice to the Lord. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	15	22	Samuel replied , “ Has the Lord as much pleasure in your burnt offerings and sacrifices as in your obedience ? Obedience is far better than sacrifice . He is much more interested in your listening to him than in your offering the fat of rams to him .
TLB	1%20Samuel	15	23	For rebellion is as bad as the sin of witchcraft , and stubbornness is as bad as worshiping idols . And now because you have rejected the word of Jehovah , he has rejected you from being king. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	15	24	“ I have sinned , ” Saul finally admitted . “ Yes , I have disobeyed your instructions and the command of the Lord , for I was afraid of the people and did what they demanded .
TLB	1%20Samuel	15	25	Oh , please pardon my sin now and go with me to worship the Lord. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	15	26	But Samuel replied , “ It ’ s no use ! Since you have rejected the commandment of the Lord , he has rejected you from being the king of Israel. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	15	27	As Samuel turned to go , Saul grabbed at him to try to hold him back and tore his robe .
TLB	1%20Samuel	15	28	And Samuel said to him , “ See ? The Lord has torn the kingdom of Israel from you today and has given it to a countryman of yours who is better than you are .
TLB	1%20Samuel	15	29	And he who is the glory of Israel is not lying , nor will he change his mind , for he is not a man ! ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	15	30	Then Saul pleaded again , “ I have sinned ; but oh , at least honor me before the leaders and before my people by going with me to worship the Lord your God. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	15	31	So Samuel finally agreed and went with him .
TLB	1%20Samuel	15	32	Then Samuel said , “ Bring King Agag to me. ” Agag arrived all full of smiles , for he thought , “ Surely the worst is over and I have been spared ! ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	15	33	But Samuel said , “ As your sword has killed the sons of many mothers , now your mother shall be childless. ” And Samuel chopped him in pieces before the Lord at Gilgal .
TLB	1%20Samuel	15	34	Then Samuel went home to Ramah , and Saul returned to Gibeah .
TLB	1%20Samuel	15	35	Samuel never saw Saul again , but he mourned constantly for him ; and the Lord was sorry that he had ever made Saul king of Israel . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	1%20Samuel	16	1	Samuel
TLB	1%20Samuel	16	16	Finally the Lord said to Samuel , “ You have mourned long enough for Saul , for I have rejected him as king of Israel . Now take a vial of olive oil and go to Bethlehem and find a man named Jesse , for I have selected one of his sons to be the new king. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	16	2	But Samuel asked , “ How can I do that ? If Saul hears about it , he will kill me. ” “ Take a heifer with you , ” the Lord replied , “ and say that you have come to make a sacrifice to the Lord .
TLB	1%20Samuel	16	3	Then call Jesse to the sacrifice , and I will show you which of his sons to anoint. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	16	4	So Samuel did as the Lord had told him to . When he arrived at Bethlehem , the elders of the city came trembling to meet him . “ What is wrong ? ” they asked . “ Why have you come ? ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	16	5	But he replied , “ All is well . I have come to sacrifice to the Lord . Purify yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice. ” And he performed the purification rite on Jesse and his sons , and invited them too .
TLB	1%20Samuel	16	6	When they arrived , Samuel took one look at Eliab and thought , “ Surely this is the man the Lord has chosen ! ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	16	7	But the Lord said to Samuel , “ Don ’ t judge by a man ’ s face or height , for this is not the one . I don ’ t make decisions the way you do ! Men judge by outward appearance , but I look at a man ’ s thoughts and intentions. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	16	8	Then Jesse told his son Abinadab to step forward and walk in front of Samuel . But the Lord said , “ This is not the right man either. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	16	9	Next Jesse summoned Shammah , but the Lord said , “ No , this is not the one. ” In the same way all seven of his sons presented themselves to Samuel and were rejected . 10-11 “ The Lord has not chosen any of them , ” Samuel told Jesse . “ Are these all there are ? ” “ Well , there is the youngest , ” Jesse replied . “ But he ’ s out in the fields watching the sheep. ” “ Send for him at once , ” Samuel said , “ for we will not sit down to eat until he arrives. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	16	12	So Jesse sent for him . He was a fine looking boy , ruddy-faced , and with pleasant eyes . And the Lord said , “ This is the one ; anoint him. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	16	13	So as David stood there among his brothers , Samuel took the olive oil he had brought and poured it upon David ’ s head ; and the Spirit of Jehovah came upon him and gave him great power from that day onward . Then Samuel returned to Ramah .
TLB	1%20Samuel	16	14	But the Spirit of the Lord had left Saul , and instead , the Lord had sent a tormenting spirit that filled him with depression and fear . 15-16 Some of Saul ’ s aides suggested a cure . “ We ’ ll find a good harpist to play for you whenever the tormenting spirit is bothering you , ” they said . “ The harp music will quiet you and you ’ ll soon be well again. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	16	17	“ All right , ” Saul said . “ Find me a harpist. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	16	18	One of them said he knew a young fellow in Bethlehem , the son of a man named Jesse , who was not only a talented harp player , but was handsome , brave , and strong , and had good , solid judgment . “ What ’ s more , ” he added , “ the Lord is with him. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	16	19	So Saul sent messengers to Jesse , asking that he send his son David the shepherd .
TLB	1%20Samuel	16	20	Jesse responded by sending not only David but a young goat and a donkey carrying a load of food and wine .
TLB	1%20Samuel	16	21	From the instant he saw David , Saul admired and loved him ; and David became his bodyguard .
TLB	1%20Samuel	16	22	Then Saul wrote to Jesse , “ Please let David join my staff , for I am very fond of him. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	16	23	And whenever the tormenting spirit from God troubled Saul , David would play the harp and Saul would feel better , and the evil spirit would go away . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	1%20Samuel	17	1	Samuel 17:55 what sort of family does this young fellow come from ? literally , “ Whose son is this ? ” Since David was , if successful , scheduled to marry Saul ’ s daughter , Saul wanted to know more about his family ! The other explanation of this confusing passage is that Saul ’ s mental condition caused forgetfulness , so that he didn ’ t recognize David . The Living Bible copyright ©
TLB	1%20Samuel	17	17	One day Jesse said to David , “ Take this bushel of roasted grain and these ten loaves of bread to your brothers .
TLB	1%20Samuel	17	2	Saul countered with a buildup of forces at Elah Valley .
TLB	1%20Samuel	17	3	So the Philistines and Israelis faced each other on opposite hills , with the valley between them . 4-7 Then Goliath , a Philistine champion from Gath , came out of the Philistine ranks to face the forces of Israel . He was a giant of a man , measuring over nine feet tall ! He wore a bronze helmet , a two-hundred-pound coat of mail , bronze leggings , and carried a bronze javelin several inches thick , tipped with a twenty-five-pound iron spearhead , and his armor bearer walked ahead of him with a huge shield .
TLB	1%20Samuel	17	8	He stood and shouted across to the Israelis , “ Do you need a whole army to settle this ? I will represent the Philistines , and you choose someone to represent you , and we will settle this in single combat !
TLB	1%20Samuel	17	9	If your man is able to kill me , then we will be your slaves . But if I kill him , then you must be our slaves !
TLB	1%20Samuel	17	10	I defy the armies of Israel ! Send me a man who will fight with me ! ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	17	11	When Saul [ a ] and the Israeli army heard this , they were dismayed and frightened .
TLB	1%20Samuel	17	12	David ( the son of aging Jesse , a member of the tribe of Judah who lived in Bethlehem ) had seven older brothers .
TLB	1%20Samuel	17	13	The three oldest—Eliab , Abinadab , and Shammah—had already volunteered for Saul ’ s army to fight the Philistines . 14-15 David was the youngest son and was on Saul ’ s staff on a part-time basis . He went back and forth to Bethlehem to help his father with the sheep .
TLB	1%20Samuel	17	16	For forty days , twice a day , morning and evening the Philistine giant strutted before the armies of Israel .
TLB	1%20Samuel	17	18	Give this cheese to their captain and see how the boys are getting along ; and bring us back a letter [ b ] from them ! ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	17	19	( Saul and the Israeli army were camped at the valley of Elah . )
TLB	1%20Samuel	17	20	So David left the sheep with another shepherd and took off early the next morning with the gifts . He arrived at the outskirts of the camp just as the Israeli army was leaving for the battlefield with shouts and battle cries .
TLB	1%20Samuel	17	21	Soon the Israeli and Philistine forces stood facing each other , army against army .
TLB	1%20Samuel	17	22	David left his luggage with a baggage officer and hurried out to the ranks to find his brothers .
TLB	1%20Samuel	17	23	As he was talking with them , he saw Goliath the giant step out from the Philistine troops and shout his challenge to the army of Israel .
TLB	1%20Samuel	17	24	As soon as they saw him the Israeli army began to run away in fright .
TLB	1%20Samuel	17	25	“ Have you seen the giant ? ” the soldiers were asking . “ He has insulted the entire army of Israel . And have you heard about the huge reward the king has offered to anyone who kills him ? And the king will give him one of his daughters for a wife , and his whole family will be exempted from paying taxes ! ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	17	26	David talked to some others standing there to verify the report . “ What will a man get for killing this Philistine and ending his insults to Israel ? ” he asked them . “ Who is this heathen Philistine , anyway , that he is allowed to defy the armies of the living God ? ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	17	27	And he received the same reply as before .
TLB	1%20Samuel	17	28	But when David ’ s oldest brother , Eliab , heard David talking like that , he was angry . “ What are you doing around here , anyway ? ” he demanded . “ What about the sheep you ’ re supposed to be taking care of ? I know what a cocky brat you are ; you just want to see the battle ! ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	17	29	“ What have I done now ? ” David replied . “ I was only asking a question ! ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	17	30	And he walked over to some others and asked them the same thing and received the same answer .
TLB	1%20Samuel	17	31	When it was finally realized what David meant , someone told King Saul , and the king sent for him .
TLB	1%20Samuel	17	32	“ Don ’ t worry about a thing , ” David told him . “ I ’ ll take care of this Philistine ! ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	17	33	“ Don ’ t be ridiculous ! ” Saul replied . “ How can a kid like you fight with a man like him ? You are only a boy , and he has been in the army since he was a boy ! ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	17	34	But David persisted . “ When I am taking care of my father ’ s sheep , ” he said , “ and a lion or a bear comes and grabs a lamb from the flock ,
TLB	1%20Samuel	17	35	I go after it with a club and take the lamb from its mouth . If it turns on me , I catch it by the jaw and club it to death .
TLB	1%20Samuel	17	36	I have done this to both lions and bears , and I ’ ll do it to this heathen Philistine too , for he has defied the armies of the living God !
TLB	1%20Samuel	17	37	The Lord who saved me from the claws and teeth of the lion and the bear will save me from this Philistine ! ” Saul finally consented , “ All right , go ahead , ” he said , “ and may the Lord be with you ! ” 38-39 Then Saul gave David his own armor—a bronze helmet and a coat of mail . David put it on , strapped the sword over it , and took a step or two to see what it was like , for he had never worn such things before . “ I can hardly move ! ” he exclaimed , and took them off again .
TLB	1%20Samuel	17	40	Then he picked up five smooth stones from a stream and put them in his shepherd ’ s bag and , armed only with his shepherd ’ s staff and sling , started across to Goliath . 41-42 Goliath walked out toward David with his shield-bearer ahead of him , sneering in contempt at this nice little red-cheeked boy !
TLB	1%20Samuel	17	43	“ Am I a dog , ” he roared at David , “ that you come at me with a stick ? ” And he cursed David by the names of his gods .
TLB	1%20Samuel	17	44	“ Come over here and I ’ ll give your flesh to the birds and wild animals , ” Goliath yelled .
TLB	1%20Samuel	17	45	David shouted in reply , “ You come to me with a sword and a spear , but I come to you in the name of the Lord of the armies of heaven and of Israel—the very God whom you have defied .
TLB	1%20Samuel	17	46	Today the Lord will conquer you , and I will kill you and cut off your head ; and then I will give the dead bodies of your men to the birds and wild animals , and the whole world will know that there is a God in Israel !
TLB	1%20Samuel	17	47	And Israel will learn that the Lord does not depend on weapons to fulfill his plans—he works without regard to human means ! He will give you to us ! ” 48-49 As Goliath approached , David ran out to meet him and , reaching into his shepherd ’ s bag , took out a stone , hurled it from his sling , and hit the Philistine in the forehead . The stone sank in , and the man fell on his face to the ground . 50-51 So David conquered the Philistine giant with a sling and a stone . Since he had no sword , he ran over and pulled Goliath ’ s from its sheath and killed him with it , and then cut off his head . When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead , they turned and ran .
TLB	1%20Samuel	17	52	Then the Israelis gave a great shout of triumph and rushed after the Philistines , chasing them as far as Gath and the gates of Ekron . The bodies of the dead and wounded Philistines were strewn all along the road to Shaaraim .
TLB	1%20Samuel	17	53	Then the Israeli army returned and plundered the deserted Philistine camp .
TLB	1%20Samuel	17	54	( Later David took Goliath ’ s head to Jerusalem , but stored his armor in his tent . )
TLB	1%20Samuel	17	55	As Saul was watching David go out to fight Goliath , he asked Abner , the general of his army , “ Abner , what sort of family does this young fellow come from ? ” [ c ] “ I really don ’ t know , ” Abner said .
TLB	1%20Samuel	17	56	“ Well , find out ! ” the king told him .
TLB	1%20Samuel	17	57	After David had killed Goliath , Abner brought him to Saul with the Philistine ’ s head still in his hand .
TLB	1%20Samuel	17	58	“ Tell me about your father , my boy , ” Saul said . And David replied , “ His name is Jesse and we live in Bethlehem. ” Footnotes -

TLB	1%20Samuel	18	18	“ Who am I that I should be the king ’ s son-in-law ? ” David exclaimed . “ My father ’ s family is nothing ! ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	18	4	and sealed the pact by giving him his robe , sword , bow , and belt . King Saul now kept David with him and wouldn ’ t let him return home anymore .
TLB	1%20Samuel	18	5	He was Saul ’ s special assistant , and he always carried out his assignments successfully . So Saul made him commander of his troops , an appointment that was applauded by the army and general public alike .
TLB	1%20Samuel	18	6	But something had happened when the victorious Israeli army was returning home after David had killed Goliath . Women came out from all the towns along the way to celebrate and to cheer for King Saul , and were singing and dancing for joy with tambourines and cymbals .
TLB	1%20Samuel	18	7	However , this was their song : “ Saul has slain his thousands , and David his ten thousands ! ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	18	8	Of course Saul was very angry . “ What ’ s this ? ” he said to himself . “ They credit David with ten thousands and me with only thousands . Next they ’ ll be making him their king ! ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	18	9	So from that time on King Saul kept a jealous watch on David .
TLB	1%20Samuel	18	10	The very next day , in fact , a tormenting spirit from God overwhelmed Saul , and he began to rave like a madman . David began to soothe him by playing the harp , as he did whenever this happened . But Saul , who was fiddling with his spear , 11-12 suddenly hurled it at David , intending to pin him to the wall . But David jumped aside and escaped . This happened another time , too , for Saul was afraid of him and jealous because the Lord had left him and was now with David .
TLB	1%20Samuel	18	13	Finally Saul banned him from his presence and demoted him to the rank of captain . But the controversy put David more than ever in the public eye .
TLB	1%20Samuel	18	14	David continued to succeed in everything he undertook , for the Lord was with him . 15-16 When King Saul saw this , he became even more afraid of him ; but all Israel and Judah loved him , for he was as one of them .
TLB	1%20Samuel	18	17	One day Saul said to David , “ I am ready to give you my oldest daughter Merab as your wife . But first you must prove yourself to be a real soldier by fighting the Lord ’ s battles. ” For Saul thought to himself , “ I ’ ll send him out against the Philistines and let them kill him rather than doing it myself. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	18	19	But when the time arrived for the wedding , Saul married her to Adriel , a man from Meholath , instead .
TLB	1%20Samuel	18	20	In the meantime Saul ’ s daughter Michal had fallen in love with David , and Saul was delighted when he heard about it .
TLB	1%20Samuel	18	21	“ Here ’ s another opportunity to see him killed by the Philistines ! ” Saul said to himself . But to David he said , “ You can be my son-in-law after all , for I will give you my youngest daughter. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	18	22	Then Saul instructed his men to say confidentially to David that the king really liked him a lot , and that they all loved him and thought he should accept the king ’ s proposition and become his son-in-law .
TLB	1%20Samuel	18	23	But David replied , “ How can a poor man like me from an unknown family find enough dowry to marry the daughter of a king ? ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	18	24	When Saul ’ s men reported this back to him ,
TLB	1%20Samuel	18	25	he told them , “ Tell David that the only dowry I need is one hundred dead Philistines ! [ a ] Vengeance on my enemies is all I want. ” But what Saul had in mind was that David would be killed in the fight .
TLB	1%20Samuel	18	26	David was delighted to accept the offer . So , before the time limit expired ,
TLB	1%20Samuel	18	27	he and his men went out and killed two hundred Philistines and presented their foreskins to King Saul . So Saul gave Michal to him .
TLB	1%20Samuel	18	28	When the king realized how much the Lord was with David and how immensely popular he was with all the people ,
TLB	1%20Samuel	18	29	he became even more afraid of him and grew to hate him more with every passing day .
TLB	1%20Samuel	18	30	Whenever the Philistine army attacked , David was more successful against them than all the rest of Saul ’ s officers . So David ’ s name became very famous throughout the land . Footnotes -

TLB	1%20Samuel	19	19	When the report reached Saul that David was at Naioth in Ramah ,
TLB	1%20Samuel	19	2	told him what his father was planning . “ Tomorrow morning , ” he warned him , “ you must find a hiding place out in the fields .
TLB	1%20Samuel	19	3	I ’ ll ask my father to go out there with me , and I ’ ll talk to him about you ; then I ’ ll tell you everything I can find out. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	19	4	The next morning [ a ] as Jonathan and his father were talking together , he spoke well of David and begged him not to be against David . “ He ’ s never done anything to harm you , ” Jonathan pleaded . “ He has always helped you in any way he could .
TLB	1%20Samuel	19	5	Have you forgotten about the time he risked his life to kill Goliath , and how the Lord brought a great victory to Israel as a result ? You were certainly happy about it then . Why should you now murder an innocent man ? There is no reason for it at all ! ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	19	6	Finally Saul agreed and vowed , “ As the Lord lives , he shall not be killed. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	19	7	Afterwards Jonathan called David and told him what had happened . Then he took David to Saul and everything was as it had been before .
TLB	1%20Samuel	19	8	War broke out shortly after that , and David led his troops against the Philistines and slaughtered many of them , and put to flight their entire army . 9-10 But one day as Saul was sitting at home , listening to David playing the harp , suddenly the tormenting spirit from the Lord attacked him . He had his spear in his hand and hurled it at David in an attempt to kill him . But David dodged out of the way and fled into the night , leaving the spear imbedded in the timber of the wall .
TLB	1%20Samuel	19	11	Saul sent troops to watch David ’ s house and kill him when he came out in the morning . “ If you don ’ t get away tonight , ” Michal warned him , “ you ’ ll be dead by morning. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	19	12	So she helped him get down to the ground through a window .
TLB	1%20Samuel	19	13	Then she took an idol [ b ] and put it in his bed , and covered it with blankets , with its head on a pillow of goat ’ s hair .
TLB	1%20Samuel	19	14	When the soldiers came to arrest David and take him to Saul , [ c ] she told them he was sick and couldn ’ t get out of bed .
TLB	1%20Samuel	19	15	Saul said to bring him in his bed , then , so that he could kill him .
TLB	1%20Samuel	19	16	But when they came to carry him out , they discovered that it was only an idol !
TLB	1%20Samuel	19	17	“ Why have you deceived me and let my enemy escape ? ” Saul demanded of Michal . “ I had to , ” Michal replied . “ He threatened to kill me if I didn ’ t help him. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	19	18	In that way David got away and went to Ramah to see Samuel , and told him all that Saul had done to him . So Samuel took David with him to live at Naioth .
TLB	1%20Samuel	19	20	he sent soldiers to capture him ; but when they arrived and saw Samuel and the other prophets prophesying , the Spirit of God came upon them and they also began to prophesy .
TLB	1%20Samuel	19	21	When Saul heard what had happened , he sent other soldiers , but they too prophesied ! The same thing happened a third time !
TLB	1%20Samuel	19	22	Then Saul himself went to Ramah and arrived at the great well in Secu . “ Where are Samuel and David ? ” he demanded . Someone told him they were at Naioth .
TLB	1%20Samuel	19	23	But on the way to Naioth the Spirit of God came upon Saul , and he too began to prophesy !
TLB	1%20Samuel	19	24	He tore off his clothes and lay naked all day and all night , prophesying with Samuel ’ s prophets . Saul ’ s men were incredulous ! “ What ! ” they exclaimed . “ Is Saul a prophet too ? ” [ d ] Footnotes -

TLB	1%20Samuel	20	20	I will come out and shoot three arrows in front of the pile as though I were shooting at a target .
TLB	1%20Samuel	20	2	“ That ’ s not true ! ” Jonathan protested . “ I ’ m sure he ’ s not planning any such thing , for he always tells me everything he ’ s going to do , even little things , and I know he wouldn ’ t hide something like this from me . It just isn ’ t so. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	20	3	“ Of course you don ’ t know about it ! ” David fumed . “ Your father knows perfectly well about our friendship , so he has said to himself , ‘ I ’ ll not tell Jonathan—why should I hurt him ? ’ But the truth is that I am only a step away from death ! I swear it by the Lord and by your own soul ! ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	20	4	“ Tell me what I can do , ” Jonathan begged .
TLB	1%20Samuel	20	5	And David replied , “ Tomorrow is the beginning of the celebration of the new moon . Always before , I ’ ve been with your father for this occasion , but tomorrow I ’ ll hide in the field and stay there until the evening of the third day .
TLB	1%20Samuel	20	6	If your father asks where I am , tell him that I asked permission to go home to Bethlehem for an annual family reunion .
TLB	1%20Samuel	20	7	If he says , ‘ Fine ! ’ then I ’ ll know that all is well . But if he is angry , then I ’ ll know that he is planning to kill me .
TLB	1%20Samuel	20	8	Do this for me as my sworn brother . Or else kill me yourself if I have sinned against your father , but don ’ t betray me to him ! ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	20	9	“ Of course not ! ” Jonathan exclaimed . “ Look , wouldn ’ t I say so if I knew that my father was planning to kill you ? ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	20	10	Then David asked , “ How will I know whether or not your father is angry ? ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	20	11	“ Come out to the field with me , ” Jonathan replied . And they went out there together .
TLB	1%20Samuel	20	12	Then Jonathan told David , “ I promise by the Lord God of Israel that about this time tomorrow , or the next day at the latest , I will talk to my father about you and let you know at once how he feels about you .
TLB	1%20Samuel	20	13	If he is angry and wants you killed , then may the Lord kill me if I don ’ t tell you , so you can escape and live . May the Lord be with you as he used to be with my father .
TLB	1%20Samuel	20	14	And remember , you must demonstrate the love and kindness of the Lord not only to me during my own lifetime ,
TLB	1%20Samuel	20	15	but also to my children after the Lord has destroyed all of your enemies. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	20	16	So Jonathan made a covenant with the family of David , and David swore to it with a terrible curse against himself and his descendants , should he be unfaithful to his promise .
TLB	1%20Samuel	20	17	But Jonathan made David swear to it again , this time by his love for him , for he loved him as much as he loved himself .
TLB	1%20Samuel	20	18	Then Jonathan said , “ Yes , they will miss you tomorrow when your place at the table is empty .
TLB	1%20Samuel	20	19	By the day after tomorrow , everyone will be asking about you , so be at the hideout where you were before , over by the stone pile .
TLB	1%20Samuel	20	21	Then I ’ ll send a lad to bring the arrows back . If you hear me tell him , ‘ They ’ re on this side , ’ then you will know that all is well and that there is no trouble .
TLB	1%20Samuel	20	22	But if I tell him , ‘ Go farther—the arrows are still ahead of you , ’ then it will mean that you must leave immediately .
TLB	1%20Samuel	20	23	And may the Lord make us keep our promises to each other , for he has witnessed them. ” [ a ] 24-25 So David hid himself in the field . When the new moon celebration began , the king sat down to eat at his usual place against the wall . Jonathan sat opposite him and Abner was sitting beside Saul , but David ’ s place was empty .
TLB	1%20Samuel	20	26	Saul didn ’ t say anything about it that day , for he supposed that something had happened so that David was ceremonially impure . Yes , surely that must be it !
TLB	1%20Samuel	20	27	But when his place was still empty the next day , Saul asked Jonathan , “ Why hasn ’ t David been here for dinner either yesterday or today ? ” 28-29 “ He asked me if he could go to Bethlehem to take part in a family celebration , ” Jonathan replied . “ His brother demanded that he be there , so I told him to go ahead. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	20	30	Saul boiled with rage . “ You fool ! ” [ b ] he yelled at him . “ Do you think I don ’ t know that you want this son of a nobody to be king in your place , shaming yourself and your mother ?
TLB	1%20Samuel	20	31	As long as that fellow is alive , you ’ ll never be king . Now go and get him so I can kill him ! ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	20	32	“ But what has he done ? ” Jonathan demanded . “ Why should he be put to death ? ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	20	33	Then Saul hurled his spear at Jonathan , intending to kill him ; so at last Jonathan realized that his father really meant it when he said David must die .
TLB	1%20Samuel	20	34	Jonathan left the table in fierce anger and refused to eat all that day , for he was crushed by his father ’ s shameful behavior toward David .
TLB	1%20Samuel	20	35	The next morning , as agreed , Jonathan went out into the field and took a young boy with him to gather his arrows .
TLB	1%20Samuel	20	36	“ Start running , ” he told the boy , “ so that you can find the arrows as I shoot them. ” So the boy ran and Jonathan shot an arrow beyond him .
TLB	1%20Samuel	20	37	When the boy had almost reached the arrow , Jonathan shouted , “ The arrow is still ahead of you .
TLB	1%20Samuel	20	38	Hurry , hurry , don ’ t wait. ” So the boy quickly gathered up the arrows and ran back to his master .
TLB	1%20Samuel	20	39	He , of course , didn ’ t understand what Jonathan meant ; only Jonathan and David knew .
TLB	1%20Samuel	20	40	Then Jonathan gave his bow and arrows to the boy and told him to take them back to the city .
TLB	1%20Samuel	20	41	As soon as he was gone , David came out from where he had been hiding near the south edge of the field . Both of them were crying as they said good-bye , especially David . [ c ]
TLB	1%20Samuel	20	42	At last Jonathan said to David , “ Cheer up , for we have entrusted each other and each other ’ s children into God ’ s hands forever. ” So they parted , David going away and Jonathan returning to the city . Footnotes -

TLB	1%20Samuel	21	1	Samuel 21:9 in the clothes closet , literally , “ behind the ephod. ” The Living Bible copyright ©
TLB	1%20Samuel	21	21	David went to the city of Nob to see Ahimelech , the priest . Ahimelech trembled when he saw him . “ Why are you alone ? ” he asked . “ Why is no one with you ? ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	21	2	“ The king has sent me on a private matter , ” David lied . “ He told me not to tell anybody why I am here . I have told my men where to meet me later .
TLB	1%20Samuel	21	3	Now , what is there to eat ? Give me five loaves of bread or anything else you can. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	21	4	“ We don ’ t have any regular bread , ” the priest replied , “ but there is the holy bread , which I guess you can have if only your young men have not slept with any women for a while. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	21	5	“ Rest assured , ” David replied . “ I never let my men run wild when they are on an expedition , and since they stay clean even on ordinary trips , how much more so on this one ! ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	21	6	So , since there was no other food available , the priest gave him the holy bread—the Bread of the Presence that was placed before the Lord in the Tabernacle . It had just been replaced that day with fresh bread .
TLB	1%20Samuel	21	7	( Incidentally , Doeg the Edomite , Saul ’ s chief herdsman , was there at that time for ceremonial purification . [ a ] )
TLB	1%20Samuel	21	8	David asked Ahimelech if he had a spear or sword he could use . “ The king ’ s business required such haste , and I left in such a rush that I came away without a weapon ! ” David explained .
TLB	1%20Samuel	21	9	“ Well , ” the priest replied , “ I have the sword of Goliath , the Philistine—the fellow you killed in the valley of Elah . It is wrapped in a cloth in the clothes closet . [ b ] Take that if you want it , for there is nothing else here. ” “ Just the thing ! ” David replied . “ Give it to me ! ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	21	10	Then David hurried on , for he was fearful of Saul , and went to King Achish of Gath .
TLB	1%20Samuel	21	11	But Achish ’ s officers weren ’ t happy about his being there . “ Isn ’ t he the top leader of Israel ? ” they asked . “ Isn ’ t he the one the people honor at their dances , singing , ‘ Saul has slain his thousands and David his ten thousands ’ ? ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	21	12	David heard these comments and was afraid of what King Achish might do to him ,
TLB	1%20Samuel	21	13	so he pretended to be insane ! He scratched on doors and let his spittle flow down his beard , 14-15 until finally King Achish said to his men , “ Must you bring me a madman ? We already have enough of them around here ! Should such a fellow as this be my guest ? ” Footnotes -

TLB	1%20Samuel	22	22	David exclaimed , “ I knew it ! When I saw Doeg there , I knew he would tell Saul . Now I have caused the death of all of your father ’ s family .
TLB	1%20Samuel	22	2	Then others began coming—those who were in any kind of trouble , such as being in debt , or merely discontented—until David was the leader of about four hundred men .
TLB	1%20Samuel	22	3	( Later David went to Mizpeh in Moab to ask permission of the king for his father and mother to live there under royal protection until David knew what God was going to do for him .
TLB	1%20Samuel	22	4	They stayed in Moab during the entire period when David was living in the cave . )
TLB	1%20Samuel	22	5	One day the prophet Gad told David to leave the cave and return to the land of Judah . So David went to the forest of Hereth .
TLB	1%20Samuel	22	6	The news of his arrival in Judah soon reached Saul . He was in Gibeah at the time , sitting beneath an oak tree playing with his spear , surrounded by his officers .
TLB	1%20Samuel	22	7	“ Listen here , you men of Benjamin ! ” Saul exclaimed when he heard the news . “ Has David promised you fields and vineyards and commissions in his army ?
TLB	1%20Samuel	22	8	Is that why you are against me ? For not one of you has ever told me that my own son is on David ’ s side . You ’ re not even sorry for me . Think of it ! My own son—encouraging David to come and kill me ! ” 9-10 Then Doeg the Edomite , who was standing there with Saul ’ s men , spoke up . “ When I was at Nob , ” he said , “ I saw David talking to Ahimelech the priest . Ahimelech consulted the Lord to find out what David should do , and then gave him food and the sword of Goliath the Philistine. ” 11-12 King Saul immediately summoned Ahimelech and all his family and all the other priests at Nob . When they arrived Saul shouted at him , “ Listen to me , you son of Ahitub ! ” “ What is it ? ” quavered Ahimelech .
TLB	1%20Samuel	22	13	“ Why have you and David conspired against me ? ” Saul demanded . “ Why did you give him food and a sword and talk to God for him ? Why did you encourage him to revolt against me and to come here and attack me ? ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	22	14	“ But sir , ” Ahimelech replied , “ is there anyone among all your servants who is as faithful as David your son-in-law ? Why , he is the captain of your bodyguard and a highly honored member of your own household !
TLB	1%20Samuel	22	15	This was certainly not the first time I had consulted God for him ! It ’ s unfair for you to accuse me and my family in this matter , for we knew nothing of any plot against you. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	22	16	“ You shall die , Ahimelech , along with your entire family ! ” the king shouted .
TLB	1%20Samuel	22	17	He ordered his bodyguards , “ Kill these priests , for they are allies and conspirators with David ; they knew he was running away from me , but they didn ’ t tell me ! ” But the soldiers refused to harm the clergy .
TLB	1%20Samuel	22	18	Then the king said to Doeg , “ You do it. ” So Doeg turned on them and killed them , eighty-five priests in all , all wearing their priestly robes .
TLB	1%20Samuel	22	19	Then he went to Nob , the city of the priests , and killed the priests ’ families—men , women , children , and babies , and also all the oxen , donkeys , and sheep .
TLB	1%20Samuel	22	20	Only Abiathar , one of the sons of Ahimelech , escaped and fled to David .
TLB	1%20Samuel	22	21	When he told him what Saul had done ,

TLB	1%20Samuel	23	1	Samuel
TLB	1%20Samuel	23	23	Discover his hiding places and then come back and give me a more definite report . Then I ’ ll go with you . And if he is in the area at all , I ’ ll find him if I have to search every inch of the entire land ! ” 24-25 So the men of Ziph returned home . But when David heard that Saul was on his way to Ziph , he and his men went even further into the wilderness of Maon in the south of the desert . But Saul followed them there .
TLB	1%20Samuel	23	2	David asked the Lord , “ Shall I go and attack them ? ” “ Yes , go and save Keilah , ” the Lord told him .
TLB	1%20Samuel	23	3	But David ’ s men said , “ We ’ re afraid even here in Judah ; we certainly don ’ t want to go to Keilah to fight the whole Philistine army ! ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	23	4	David asked the Lord again , and the Lord again replied , “ Go down to Keilah , for I will help you conquer the Philistines. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	23	5	They went to Keilah and slaughtered the Philistines and confiscated their cattle , and so the people of Keilah were saved .
TLB	1%20Samuel	23	6	( Abiathar the priest went to Keilah with David , taking his ephod with him to get answers for David from the Lord . )
TLB	1%20Samuel	23	7	Saul soon learned that David was at Keilah . “ Good ! ” he exclaimed . “ We ’ ve got him now ! God has delivered him to me , for he has trapped himself in a walled city ! ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	23	8	So Saul mobilized his entire army to march to Keilah and besiege David and his men .
TLB	1%20Samuel	23	9	But David learned of Saul ’ s plan and told Abiathar the priest to bring the ephod and to ask the Lord what he should do .
TLB	1%20Samuel	23	10	“ O Lord God of Israel , ” David said , “ I have heard that Saul is planning to come and destroy Keilah because I am here .
TLB	1%20Samuel	23	11	Will the men of Keilah surrender me to him ? And will Saul actually come , as I have heard ? O Lord God of Israel , please tell me. ” And the Lord said , “ He will come. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	23	12	“ And will these men of Keilah betray me to Saul ? ” David persisted . And the Lord replied , “ Yes , they will betray you. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	23	13	So David and his men—about six hundred of them now—left Keilah and began roaming the countryside . Word soon reached Saul that David had escaped , so he didn ’ t go there after all . 14-15 David now lived in the wilderness caves in the hill country of Ziph . One day near Horesh he received the news that Saul was on the way to Ziph to search for him and kill him . Saul hunted him day after day , but the Lord didn ’ t let him find him .
TLB	1%20Samuel	23	16	( Prince Jonathan now went to find David ; he met him at Horesh and encouraged him in his faith in God .
TLB	1%20Samuel	23	17	“ Don ’ t be afraid , ” Jonathan reassured him . “ My father will never find you ! You are going to be the king of Israel and I will be next to you , as my father is well aware. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	23	18	So the two of them renewed their pact of friendship ; and David stayed at Horesh while Jonathan returned home . )
TLB	1%20Samuel	23	19	But now the men of Ziph went to Saul in Gibeah and betrayed David to him . “ We know where he is hiding , ” they said . “ He is in the caves of Horesh on Hachilah Hill , down in the southern part of the wilderness .
TLB	1%20Samuel	23	20	Come on down , sir , and we will catch him for you and your fondest wish will be fulfilled ! ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	23	21	“ Well , praise the Lord ! ” Saul said . “ At last someone has had pity on me !
TLB	1%20Samuel	23	22	Go and check again to be sure of where he is staying and who has seen him there , for I know that he is very crafty .
TLB	1%20Samuel	23	26	He and David were now on opposite sides of a mountain . As Saul and his men began to close in , David tried his best to escape , but it was no use .
TLB	1%20Samuel	23	27	But just then a message reached Saul that the Philistines were raiding Israel again ,
TLB	1%20Samuel	23	28	so Saul quit the chase and returned to fight the Philistines . Ever since that time the place where David was camped has been called , “ The Rock of Escape. ”

TLB	1%20Samuel	24	1	Samuel
TLB	1%20Samuel	24	24	After Saul ’ s return from his battle with the Philistines , he was told that David had gone into the wilderness of Engedi ;
TLB	1%20Samuel	24	2	so he took three thousand special troops and went to search for him among the rocks and wild goats of the desert .
TLB	1%20Samuel	24	3	At the place where the road passes some sheepfolds , Saul went into a cave to go to the bathroom , but as it happened , David and his men were hiding in the cave !
TLB	1%20Samuel	24	4	“ Now ’ s your time ! ” David ’ s men whispered to him . “ Today is the day the Lord was talking about when he said , ‘ I will certainly put Saul into your power , to do with as you wish ’ ! ” Then David crept forward and quietly slit off the bottom of Saul ’ s robe !
TLB	1%20Samuel	24	5	But then his conscience began bothering him .
TLB	1%20Samuel	24	6	“ I shouldn ’ t have done it , ” he said to his men . “ It is a serious sin to attack God ’ s chosen king in any way. ” 7-8 These words of David persuaded his men not to kill Saul . After Saul had left the cave and gone on his way , David came out and shouted after him , “ My lord the king ! ” And when Saul looked around , David bowed low before him . 9-10 Then he shouted to Saul , “ Why do you listen to the people who say I am trying to harm you ? This very day you have seen it isn ’ t true . For the Lord placed you at my mercy back there in the cave , and some of my men told me to kill you , but I spared you . For I said , ‘ I will never harm him—he is the Lord ’ s chosen king. ’
TLB	1%20Samuel	24	11	See what I have in my hand ? It is the hem of your robe ! I cut it off , but I didn ’ t kill you ! Doesn ’ t this convince you that I am not trying to harm you and that I have not sinned against you , even though you have been hunting for my life ?
TLB	1%20Samuel	24	12	“ The Lord will decide between us . Perhaps he will kill you for what you are trying to do to me , but I will never harm you .
TLB	1%20Samuel	24	13	As that old proverb says , ‘ Wicked is as wicked does , ’ but despite your wickedness , I ’ ll not touch you .
TLB	1%20Samuel	24	14	And who is the king of Israel trying to catch , anyway ? Should he spend his time chasing one who is as worthless as a dead dog or a flea ?
TLB	1%20Samuel	24	15	May the Lord judge as to which of us is right and punish whichever one of us is guilty . He is my lawyer and defender , and he will rescue me from your power ! ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	24	16	Saul called back , “ Is it really you , my son David ? ” Then he began to cry .
TLB	1%20Samuel	24	17	And he said to David , “ You are a better man than I am , for you have repaid me good for evil .
TLB	1%20Samuel	24	18	Yes , you have been wonderfully kind to me today , for when the Lord delivered me into your hand , you didn ’ t kill me .
TLB	1%20Samuel	24	19	Who else in all the world would let his enemy get away when he had him in his power ? May the Lord reward you well for the kindness you have shown me today .
TLB	1%20Samuel	24	20	And now I realize that you are surely going to be king , and Israel shall be yours to rule .
TLB	1%20Samuel	24	21	Oh , swear to me by the Lord that when that happens you will not kill my family and destroy my line of descendants ! ”

TLB	1%20Samuel	25	25	Nabal is a bad-tempered boor , but please don ’ t pay any attention to what he said . He is a fool—just like his name means . But I didn ’ t see the messengers you sent .
TLB	1%20Samuel	25	2	A wealthy man from Maon owned a sheep ranch there , near the village of Carmel . He had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats , and was at his ranch at this time for the sheepshearing .
TLB	1%20Samuel	25	3	His name was Nabal and his wife , a beautiful and very intelligent woman , was named Abigail . But the man , who was a descendant of Caleb , was uncouth , churlish , stubborn , and ill-mannered .
TLB	1%20Samuel	25	4	When David heard that Nabal was shearing his sheep ,
TLB	1%20Samuel	25	5	he sent ten of his young men to Carmel to give him this message :
TLB	1%20Samuel	25	6	“ May God prosper you and your family and multiply everything you own .
TLB	1%20Samuel	25	7	I am told that you are shearing your sheep and goats . While your shepherds have lived among us , we have never harmed them , nor stolen anything from them the whole time they have been in Carmel .
TLB	1%20Samuel	25	8	Ask your young men and they will tell you whether or not this is true . Now I have sent my men to ask for a little contribution from you , for we have come at a happy time of holiday . Please give us a present of whatever is at hand. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	25	9	The young men gave David ’ s message to Nabal and waited for his reply .
TLB	1%20Samuel	25	10	“ Who is this fellow David ? ” he sneered . “ Who does this son of Jesse think he is ? There are lots of servants these days who run away from their masters .
TLB	1%20Samuel	25	11	Should I take my bread and my water and my meat that I ’ ve slaughtered for my shearers and give it to a gang who comes from God knows where ? ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	25	12	So David ’ s messengers returned and told him what Nabal had said .
TLB	1%20Samuel	25	13	“ Get your swords ! ” was David ’ s reply as he strapped on his own . Four hundred of them started off with David and two hundred remained behind to guard their gear .
TLB	1%20Samuel	25	14	Meanwhile , one of Nabal ’ s men went and told Abigail , “ David sent men from the wilderness to talk to our master , but he insulted them and railed at them . 15-16 But David ’ s men were very good to us and we never suffered any harm from them ; in fact , day and night they were like a wall of protection to us and the sheep , and nothing was stolen from us the whole time they were with us .
TLB	1%20Samuel	25	17	You ’ d better think fast , for there is going to be trouble for our master and his whole family—he ’ s such a stubborn lout that no one can even talk to him ! ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	25	18	Then Abigail hurriedly took two hundred loaves of bread , two barrels of wine , five dressed sheep , two bushels of roasted grain , one hundred raisin cakes , and two hundred fig cakes , and packed them onto donkeys .
TLB	1%20Samuel	25	19	“ Go on ahead , ” she said to her young men , “ and I will follow. ” But she didn ’ t tell her husband what she was doing .
TLB	1%20Samuel	25	20	As she was riding down the trail on her donkey , she met David coming toward her .
TLB	1%20Samuel	25	21	David had been saying to himself , “ A lot of good it did us to help this fellow . We protected his flocks in the wilderness so that not one thing was lost or stolen , but he has repaid me bad for good . All that I get for my trouble is insults .
TLB	1%20Samuel	25	22	May God curse me if even one of his men remains alive by tomorrow morning ! ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	25	23	When Abigail saw David , she quickly dismounted and bowed low before him .
TLB	1%20Samuel	25	24	“ I accept all blame in this matter , my lord , ” she said . “ Please listen to what I want to say .
TLB	1%20Samuel	25	26	Sir , since the Lord has kept you from murdering and taking vengeance into your own hands , I pray by the life of God , and by your own life too , that all your enemies shall be as cursed as Nabal is .
TLB	1%20Samuel	25	27	And now , here is a present I have brought to you and your young men .
TLB	1%20Samuel	25	28	Forgive me for my boldness in coming out here . The Lord will surely reward you with eternal royalty for your descendants , for you are fighting his battles ; and you will never do wrong throughout your entire life .
TLB	1%20Samuel	25	29	Even when you are chased by those who seek your life , you are safe in the care of the Lord your God , just as though you were safe inside his purse ! But the lives of your enemies shall disappear like stones from a sling ! 30-31 When the Lord has done all the good things he promised you and has made you king of Israel , you won ’ t want the conscience of a murderer who took the law into his own hands ! And when the Lord has done these great things for you , please remember me ! ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	25	32	David replied to Abigail , “ Bless the Lord God of Israel who has sent you to meet me today !
TLB	1%20Samuel	25	33	Thank God for your good sense ! Bless you for keeping me from murdering the man and carrying out vengeance with my own hands .
TLB	1%20Samuel	25	34	For I swear by the Lord , the God of Israel who has kept me from hurting you , that if you had not come out to meet me , not one of Nabal ’ s men would be alive tomorrow morning. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	25	35	Then David accepted her gifts and told her to return home without fear , for he would not kill her husband .
TLB	1%20Samuel	25	36	When she arrived home she found that Nabal had thrown a big party . He was roaring drunk , so she didn ’ t tell him anything about her meeting with David until the next morning . 37-38 By that time he was sober , and when his wife told him what had happened , he had a stroke and lay paralyzed [ a ] for about ten days , then died , for the Lord killed him .
TLB	1%20Samuel	25	39	When David heard that Nabal was dead , he said , “ Praise the Lord ! God has paid back Nabal and kept me from doing it myself ; he has received his punishment for his sin. ” Then David wasted no time in sending messengers to Abigail to ask her to become his wife .
TLB	1%20Samuel	25	40	When the messengers arrived at Carmel and told her why they had come ,
TLB	1%20Samuel	25	41	she readily agreed to his request .
TLB	1%20Samuel	25	42	Quickly getting ready , she took along five of her serving girls as attendants , mounted her donkey , and followed the men back to David . So she became his wife .
TLB	1%20Samuel	25	43	David also married Ahinoam from Jezreel .
TLB	1%20Samuel	25	44	King Saul , meanwhile , had forced David ’ s wife Michal , Saul ’ s daughter , to marry a man from Gallim named Palti ( the son of Laish ) . Footnotes -

TLB	1%20Samuel	26	1	Samuel
TLB	1%20Samuel	26	26	Now the men from Ziph came back to Saul at Gibeah to tell him that David had returned to the wilderness and was hiding on Hachilah Hill .
TLB	1%20Samuel	26	2	So Saul took his elite corps of three thousand troops and went to hunt him down . 3-4 Saul camped along the road at the edge of the wilderness where David was hiding , but David knew of Saul ’ s arrival and sent out spies to watch his movements . 5-7 David slipped over to Saul ’ s camp one night to look around . King Saul and General Abner were sleeping inside a ring formed by the slumbering soldiers . “ Any volunteers to go down there with me ? ” David asked Ahimelech ( the Hittite ) and Abishai ( Joab ’ s brother and the son of Zeruiah ) . “ I ’ ll go with you , ” Abishai replied . So David and Abishai went to Saul ’ s camp and found him asleep , with his spear in the ground beside his head .
TLB	1%20Samuel	26	8	“ God has put your enemy within your power this time for sure , ” Abishai whispered to David . “ Let me go and put that spear through him . I ’ ll pin him to the earth with it—I ’ ll not need to strike a second time ! ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	26	9	“ No , ” David said . “ Don ’ t kill him , for who can remain innocent after attacking the Lord ’ s chosen king ?
TLB	1%20Samuel	26	10	Surely God will strike him down some day , or he will die in battle or of old age .
TLB	1%20Samuel	26	11	But God forbid that I should kill the man he has chosen to be king ! But I ’ ll tell you what—we ’ ll take his spear and his jug of water and then get out of here ! ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	26	12	So David took the spear and jug of water , and they got away without anyone seeing them or even waking up , because the Lord had put them sound asleep .
TLB	1%20Samuel	26	13	They climbed the mountain slope opposite the camp until they were at a safe distance .
TLB	1%20Samuel	26	14	Then David shouted down to Abner and Saul , “ Wake up , Abner ! ” “ Who is it ? ” Abner demanded .
TLB	1%20Samuel	26	15	“ Well , Abner , you ’ re a great fellow , aren ’ t you ? ” David taunted . “ Where in all Israel is there anyone as wonderful ? So why haven ’ t you guarded your master the king when someone came to kill him ?
TLB	1%20Samuel	26	16	This isn ’ t good at all ! I swear by the Lord that you ought to die for your carelessness . Where is the king ’ s spear and the jug of water that was beside his head ? Look and see ! ” 17-18 Saul recognized David ’ s voice and said , “ Is that you , my son David ? ” And David replied , “ Yes , sir , it is . Why are you chasing me ? What have I done ? What is my crime ?
TLB	1%20Samuel	26	19	If the Lord has stirred you up against me , then let him accept my peace offering . But if this is simply the scheme of a man , then may he be cursed by God . For you have driven me out of my home so that I can ’ t be with the Lord ’ s people , and you have sent me away to worship heathen gods .
TLB	1%20Samuel	26	20	Must I die on foreign soil , far from the presence of Jehovah ? Why should the king of Israel come out to hunt my life like a partridge on the mountains ? ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	26	21	Then Saul confessed , “ I have done wrong . Come back home , my son , and I ’ ll no longer try to harm you ; for you saved my life today . I have been a fool , and very , very wrong. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	26	22	“ Here is your spear , sir , ” David replied . “ Let one of your young men come over and get it .
TLB	1%20Samuel	26	23	The Lord gives his own reward for doing good and for being loyal , and I refused to kill you even when the Lord placed you in my power .
TLB	1%20Samuel	26	24	Now may the Lord save my life , even as I have saved yours today . May he rescue me from all my troubles. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	26	25	And Saul said to David , “ Blessings on you , my son David . You shall do heroic deeds and be a great conqueror. ” Then David went away and Saul returned home . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	1%20Samuel	27	1	Samuel
TLB	1%20Samuel	27	27	But David kept thinking to himself , “ Someday Saul is going to get me . I ’ ll try my luck among the Philistines until Saul gives up and quits hunting for me ; then I will finally be safe again. ” 2-3 So David took his six hundred men and their families to live at Gath under the protection of King Achish . He had his two wives with him—Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail of Carmel , Nabal ’ s widow .
TLB	1%20Samuel	27	4	Word soon reached Saul that David had fled to Gath , so he quit hunting for him .
TLB	1%20Samuel	27	5	One day David said to Achish , “ My lord , if it is all right with you , we would rather live in one of the country towns instead of here in the royal city. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	27	6	So Achish gave him Ziklag ( which still belongs to the kings of Judah to this day ) ,
TLB	1%20Samuel	27	7	and they lived there among the Philistines for a year and four months .
TLB	1%20Samuel	27	8	He and his men spent their time raiding the Geshurites , the Girzites , and the Amalekites—people who had lived near Shur along the road to Egypt ever since ancient times .
TLB	1%20Samuel	27	9	They didn ’ t leave one person alive in the villages they hit and took for themselves the sheep , oxen , donkeys , camels , and clothing before returning to their homes .
TLB	1%20Samuel	27	10	“ Where did you make your raid today ? ” Achish would ask . And David would reply , “ Against the south of Judah and the people of Jerahmeel and the Kenites. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	27	11	No one was left alive to come to Gath and tell where he had really been . This happened again and again while he was living among the Philistines .
TLB	1%20Samuel	27	12	Achish believed David and thought that the people of Israel must hate him bitterly by now . “ Now he will have to stay here and serve me forever ! ” the king thought . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	1%20Samuel	28	28	About that time the Philistines mustered their armies for another war with Israel . “ Come and help us fight , ” King Achish said to David and his men .
TLB	1%20Samuel	28	2	“ Good , ” David agreed . “ You will soon see what a help we can be to you. ” “ If you are , you shall be my personal bodyguard for life , ” Achish told him .
TLB	1%20Samuel	28	3	( Meanwhile , Samuel had died and all Israel had mourned for him . He was buried in Ramah , his hometown . King Saul had banned all mediums and wizards from the land of Israel . )
TLB	1%20Samuel	28	4	The Philistines set up their camp at Shunem , and Saul and the armies of Israel were at Gilboa . 5-6 When Saul saw the vast army of the Philistines , he was frantic with fear and asked the Lord what he should do . But the Lord refused to answer him , either by dreams , or by Urim , [ a ] or by the prophets . 7-8 Saul then instructed his aides to try to find a medium so that he could ask her what to do , and they found one at Endor . Saul disguised himself by wearing ordinary clothing instead of his royal robes . He went to the woman ’ s home at night , accompanied by two of his men . “ I ’ ve got to talk to a dead man , ” he pleaded . “ Will you bring his spirit up ? ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	28	9	“ Are you trying to get me killed ? ” the woman demanded . “ You know that Saul has had all of the mediums and fortune-tellers executed . You are spying on me. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	28	10	But Saul took a solemn oath that he wouldn ’ t betray her .
TLB	1%20Samuel	28	11	Finally the woman said , “ Well , whom do you want me to bring up ? ” “ Bring me Samuel , ” Saul replied .
TLB	1%20Samuel	28	12	When the woman saw Samuel , she screamed , “ You ’ ve deceived me ! You are Saul ! ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	28	13	“ Don ’ t be frightened ! ” the king told her . “ What do you see ? ” “ I see a specter coming up out of the earth , ” she said .
TLB	1%20Samuel	28	14	“ What does he look like ? ” “ He is an old man wrapped in a robe. ” Saul realized that it was Samuel and bowed low before him .
TLB	1%20Samuel	28	15	“ Why have you disturbed me by bringing me back ? ” Samuel asked Saul . “ Because I am in deep trouble , ” he replied . “ The Philistines are at war with us , and God has left me and won ’ t reply by prophets or dreams ; so I have called for you to ask you what to do. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	28	16	But Samuel replied , “ Why ask me if the Lord has left you and has become your enemy ?
TLB	1%20Samuel	28	17	He has done just as he said he would and has taken the kingdom from you and given it to your rival , David .
TLB	1%20Samuel	28	18	All this has come upon you because you did not obey the Lord ’ s instructions when he was so angry with Amalek .
TLB	1%20Samuel	28	19	What ’ s more , the entire Israeli army will be routed and destroyed by the Philistines tomorrow , and you and your sons will be here with me. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	28	20	Saul now fell full length upon the ground , paralyzed with fright because of Samuel ’ s words . He was also faint with hunger , for he had eaten nothing all day .
TLB	1%20Samuel	28	21	When the woman saw how distraught he was , she said , “ Sir , I obeyed your command at the risk of my life .
TLB	1%20Samuel	28	22	Now do what I say , and let me give you something to eat so you ’ ll regain your strength for the trip back. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	28	23	But he refused . The men who were with him added their pleas to that of the woman until he finally yielded and got up and sat on the bed .
TLB	1%20Samuel	28	24	The woman had been fattening a calf , so she hurried out and killed it and kneaded dough and baked unleavened bread .
TLB	1%20Samuel	28	25	She brought the meal to the king and his men , and they ate it . Then they went out into the night . Footnotes -

TLB	1%20Samuel	29	1	Samuel
TLB	1%20Samuel	29	29	The Philistine army now mobilized at Aphek , and the Israelis camped at the springs in Jezreel .
TLB	1%20Samuel	29	2	As the Philistine captains were leading out their troops by battalions and companies , David and his men marched at the rear with King Achish .
TLB	1%20Samuel	29	3	But the Philistine commanders demanded , “ What are these Israelis doing here ? ” And King Achish told them , “ This is David , the runaway servant of King Saul of Israel . He ’ s been with me for years , and I ’ ve never found one fault in him since he arrived. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	29	4	But the Philistine leaders were angry . “ Send them back ! ” they demanded . “ They aren ’ t going into the battle with us—they ’ ll turn against us . Is there any better way for him to reconcile himself with his master than by turning against us in the battle ?
TLB	1%20Samuel	29	5	This is the same man the women of Israel sang about in their dances : ‘ Saul has slain his thousands and David his ten thousands ! ’ ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	29	6	So Achish finally summoned David and his men . “ I swear by the Lord , ” he told them , “ you are some of the finest men I ’ ve ever met , and I think you should go with us , but my commanders say no .
TLB	1%20Samuel	29	7	Please don ’ t upset them , but go back quietly. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	29	8	“ What have I done to deserve this treatment ? ” David demanded . “ Why can ’ t I fight your enemies ? ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	29	9	But Achish insisted , “ As far as I ’ m concerned , you ’ re as perfect as an angel of God . But my commanders are afraid to have you with them in the battle .
TLB	1%20Samuel	29	10	Now get up early in the morning and leave as soon as it is light. ”

TLB	1%20Samuel	30	1	Samuel
TLB	1%20Samuel	30	30	Three days later , when David and his men arrived home at their city of Ziklag , they found that the Amalekites had raided the city and burned it to the ground ,
TLB	1%20Samuel	30	2	carrying off all the women and children .
TLB	1%20Samuel	30	3	As David and his men looked at the ruins and realized what had happened to their families ,
TLB	1%20Samuel	30	4	they wept until they could weep no more .
TLB	1%20Samuel	30	5	( David ’ s two wives , Ahinoam and Abigail , were among those who had been captured . )
TLB	1%20Samuel	30	6	David was seriously worried , for in their bitter grief for their children , his men began talking of killing him . But David took strength from the Lord .
TLB	1%20Samuel	30	7	Then he said to Abiathar the priest , “ Bring me the ephod ! ” So Abiathar brought it .
TLB	1%20Samuel	30	8	David asked the Lord , “ Shall I chase them ? Will I catch them ? ” And the Lord told him , “ Yes , go after them ; you will recover everything that was taken from you ! ” 9-10 So David and his six hundred men set out after the Amalekites . When they reached Besor Brook , two hundred of the men were too exhausted to cross , but the other four hundred kept going . 11-12 Along the way they found an Egyptian youth in a field and brought him to David . He had not had anything to eat or drink for three days and nights , so they gave him part of a fig cake , two clusters of raisins , and some water , and his strength soon returned .
TLB	1%20Samuel	30	13	“ Who are you and where do you come from ? ” David asked him . “ I am an Egyptian—the servant of an Amalekite , ” he replied . “ My master left me behind three days ago because I was sick .
TLB	1%20Samuel	30	14	We were on our way back from raiding the Cherethites in the Negeb , and had raided the south of Judah and the land of Caleb , and had burned Ziklag. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	30	15	“ Can you tell me where they went ? ” David asked . The young man replied , “ If you swear by God ’ s name that you will not kill me or give me back to my master , then I will guide you to them. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	30	16	So he led them to the Amalekite encampment . They were spread out across the fields , eating and drinking and dancing with joy because of the vast amount of loot they had taken from the Philistines and from the men of Judah .
TLB	1%20Samuel	30	17	David and his men rushed in among them and slaughtered them all that night and the entire next day until evening . No one escaped except four hundred young men who fled on camels . 18-19 David got back everything they had taken . The men recovered their families and all of their belongings , and David rescued his two wives .
TLB	1%20Samuel	30	20	His troops rounded up all the flocks and herds and drove them on ahead of them . “ These are all yours personally , as your reward ! ” they told David .
TLB	1%20Samuel	30	21	When they reached Besor Brook and the two hundred men who had been too exhausted to go on , David greeted them joyfully .
TLB	1%20Samuel	30	22	But some of the ruffians among David ’ s men declared , “ They didn ’ t go with us , so they can ’ t have any of the loot . Give them their wives and their children and tell them to be gone. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	30	23	But David said , “ No , my brothers ! The Lord has kept us safe and helped us defeat the enemy .
TLB	1%20Samuel	30	24	Do you think that anyone will listen to you when you talk like this ? We share and share alike—those who go to battle and those who guard the equipment. ”
TLB	1%20Samuel	30	25	From then on David made this a law for all of Israel , and it is still followed .
TLB	1%20Samuel	30	26	When he arrived at Ziklag , he sent part of the loot to the elders of Judah . “ Here is a present for you , taken from the Lord ’ s enemies , ” he wrote them . 27-31 The gifts were sent to the elders in the following cities where David and his men had been : Bethel , South Ramoth , Jattir , Aroer , Siphmoth , Eshtemoa , Racal , the cities of the Jerahmeelites , the cities of the Kenites , Hormah , Borashan , Athach , Hebron .

TLB	1%20Samuel	31	31	Meanwhile the Philistines had begun the battle against Israel , and the Israelis fled from them and were slaughtered wholesale on Mount Gilboa .
TLB	1%20Samuel	31	2	The Philistines closed in on Saul and killed his sons Jonathan , Abinidab , and Malchishua . 3-4 Then the archers overtook Saul and wounded him badly . He groaned to his armor bearer , “ Kill me with your sword before these heathen Philistines capture me and torture me. ” But his armor bearer was afraid to , so Saul took his own sword and fell upon the point of the blade , and it pierced him through .
TLB	1%20Samuel	31	5	When his armor bearer saw that he was dead , he also fell upon his sword and died with him .
TLB	1%20Samuel	31	6	So Saul , his armor bearer , his three sons , and his troops died together that same day .
TLB	1%20Samuel	31	7	When the Israelis on the other side of the valley and beyond the Jordan heard that their comrades had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead , they abandoned their cities ; and the Philistines lived in them .
TLB	1%20Samuel	31	8	The next day when the Philistines went out to strip the dead , they found the bodies of Saul and his three sons on Mount Gilboa .
TLB	1%20Samuel	31	9	They cut off Saul ’ s head and stripped off his armor and sent the wonderful news of Saul ’ s death to their idols and to the people throughout their land .
TLB	1%20Samuel	31	10	His armor was placed in the temple of Ashtaroth , and his body was fastened to the wall of Beth-shan .
TLB	1%20Samuel	31	11	But when the people of Jabesh-gilead heard what the Philistines had done ,
TLB	1%20Samuel	31	12	warriors from that town traveled all night to Beth-shan and took down the bodies of Saul and his sons from the wall and brought them to Jabesh , where they cremated them .
TLB	1%20Samuel	31	13	Then they buried their remains beneath the oak tree at Jabesh and fasted for seven days . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	2%20Samuel	1	1	Samuel 31:3 for the true account . Probably he had found Saul dead upon the field and thought David would reward him for killing his rival . -
TLB	2%20Samuel	1	3	“ Where do you come from ? ” David asked . “ From the Israeli army , ” he replied .
TLB	2%20Samuel	1	4	“ What happened ? ” David demanded . “ Tell me how the battle went. ” And the man replied , “ Our entire army fled . Thousands of men are dead and wounded on the field , and Saul and his son Jonathan have been killed. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	1	5	“ How do you know they are dead ? ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	1	6	“ Because I was on Mount Gilboa and saw Saul leaning against his spear with the enemy chariots closing in upon him .
TLB	2%20Samuel	1	7	When he saw me he cried out for me to come to him .
TLB	2%20Samuel	1	8	“ ‘ Who are you ? ’ he asked . “ ‘ An Amalekite , ’ I replied .
TLB	2%20Samuel	1	9	“ ‘ Come and put me out of my misery , ’ he begged , ‘ for I am in terrible pain but life lingers on. ’
TLB	2%20Samuel	1	10	“ So I killed him , [ a ] for I knew he couldn ’ t live . Then I took his crown and one of his bracelets to bring to you , my lord. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	1	11	David and his men tore their clothes in sorrow when they heard the news .
TLB	2%20Samuel	1	12	They mourned and wept and fasted all day for Saul and his son Jonathan , and for the Lord ’ s people , and for the men of Israel who had died that day .
TLB	2%20Samuel	1	13	Then David said to the young man who had brought the news , “ Where are you from ? ” And he replied , “ I am an Amalekite. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	1	14	“ Why did you kill God ’ s chosen king ? ” David demanded .
TLB	2%20Samuel	1	15	Then he said to one of his young men , “ Kill him ! ” So he ran him through with his sword and he died .
TLB	2%20Samuel	1	16	“ You die self-condemned , ” David said , “ for you yourself confessed that you killed God ’ s appointed king. ” 17-18 Then David composed a dirge for Saul and Jonathan and afterward commanded that it be sung throughout Israel . It is quoted here from the book Heroic Ballads .
TLB	2%20Samuel	1	19	O Israel , your pride and joy lies dead upon the hills ; Mighty heroes have fallen .
TLB	2%20Samuel	1	20	Don ’ t tell the Philistines , lest they rejoice . Hide it from the cities of Gath and Ashkelon , Lest the heathen nations laugh in triumph .
TLB	2%20Samuel	1	21	O Mount Gilboa , Let there be no dew nor rain upon you , Let no crops of grain grow on your slopes . [ b ] For there the mighty Saul has died ; He is God ’ s appointed king no more .
TLB	2%20Samuel	1	22	Both Saul and Jonathan slew their strongest foes , And did not return from battle empty-handed .
TLB	2%20Samuel	1	23	How much they were loved , how wonderful they were— Both Saul and Jonathan ! They were together in life and in death . They were swifter than eagles , stronger than lions .
TLB	2%20Samuel	1	24	But now , O women of Israel , weep for Saul ; He enriched you With fine clothing and gold ornaments .
TLB	2%20Samuel	1	25	These mighty heroes have fallen in the midst of the battle . Jonathan is slain upon the hills .
TLB	2%20Samuel	1	26	How I weep for you , my brother Jonathan ; How much I loved you ! And your love for me was deeper Than the love of women !
TLB	2%20Samuel	1	27	The mighty ones have fallen , Stripped of their weapons , and dead . Footnotes -

TLB	2%20Samuel	2	2	Samuel 2:17 by Joab , implied . The Living Bible copyright ©
TLB	2%20Samuel	2	3	and his men and their families all moved to Hebron .
TLB	2%20Samuel	2	4	Then the leaders of Judah came to David and crowned him king of the Judean confederacy . When David heard that the men of Jabesh-gilead had buried Saul ,
TLB	2%20Samuel	2	5	he sent them this message : “ May the Lord bless you for being so loyal to your king and giving him a decent burial .
TLB	2%20Samuel	2	6	May the Lord be loyal to you in return and reward you with many demonstrations of his love ! And I too will be kind to you because of what you have done .
TLB	2%20Samuel	2	7	And now I ask you to be my strong and loyal subjects , now that Saul is dead . Be like the tribe of Judah who have appointed me as their new king. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	2	8	But Abner , Saul ’ s commander-in-chief , had gone to Mahanaim to crown Saul ’ s son Ish-bosheth as king .
TLB	2%20Samuel	2	9	His territory included Gilead , Ashuri , Jezreel , Ephraim , the tribe of Benjamin , and all the rest of Israel . 10-11 Ish-bosheth was forty years old at the time . He reigned in Mahanaim for two years ; meanwhile , David was reigning in Hebron and was king of the Judean confederacy for seven and a half years .
TLB	2%20Samuel	2	12	One day General Abner led some of Ish-bosheth ’ s troops to Gibeon from Mahanaim ,
TLB	2%20Samuel	2	13	and General Joab ( the son of Zeruiah ) led David ’ s troops out to meet them . They met at the pool of Gibeon , where they sat facing each other on opposite sides of the pool .
TLB	2%20Samuel	2	14	Then Abner suggested to Joab , “ Let ’ s watch some sword play between our young men ! ” Joab agreed ,
TLB	2%20Samuel	2	15	so twelve men were chosen from each side to fight in mortal combat .
TLB	2%20Samuel	2	16	Each one grabbed his opponent by the hair and thrust his sword into the other ’ s side , so that all of them died . The place has been known ever since as Sword Field .
TLB	2%20Samuel	2	17	The two armies then began to fight each other , and by the end of the day Abner and the men of Israel had been defeated by Joab [ a ] and the forces of David .
TLB	2%20Samuel	2	18	Joab ’ s brothers , Abishai and Asahel , were also in the battle . Asahel could run like a deer ,
TLB	2%20Samuel	2	19	and he began chasing Abner . He wouldn ’ t stop for anything , but kept on , single-minded , after Abner alone .
TLB	2%20Samuel	2	20	When Abner looked behind and saw him coming , he called out to him , “ Is that you , Asahel ? ” “ Yes , ” he called back , “ it is. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	2	21	“ Go after someone else ! ” Abner warned . But Asahel refused and kept on coming .
TLB	2%20Samuel	2	22	Again Abner shouted to him , “ Get away from here . I could never face your brother Joab if I have to kill you ! ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	2	23	But he refused to turn away , so Abner pierced him through the belly with the butt end of his spear . It went right through his body and came out his back . He stumbled to the ground and died there , and everyone stopped when they came to the place where he lay .
TLB	2%20Samuel	2	24	Now Joab and Abishai set out after Abner . The sun was just going down as they arrived at Ammah Hill near Giah , along the road into the Gibeon Desert .
TLB	2%20Samuel	2	25	Abner ’ s troops from the tribe of Benjamin regrouped there at the top of the hill ,
TLB	2%20Samuel	2	26	and Abner shouted down to Joab , “ Must our swords continue to kill each other forever ? How long will it be before you call off your people from chasing their brothers ? ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	2	27	Joab shouted back , “ I swear by God that even if you hadn ’ t spoken , we would all have gone home tomorrow morning. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	2	28	Then he blew his trumpet and his men stopped chasing the troops of Israel .
TLB	2%20Samuel	2	29	That night Abner and his men retreated across the Jordan Valley , crossed the river , and traveled all the next morning until they arrived at Mahanaim .
TLB	2%20Samuel	2	30	Joab and the men who were with him returned home , too , and when he counted his casualties , he learned that only nineteen men were missing , in addition to Asahel .
TLB	2%20Samuel	2	31	But three hundred and sixty of Abner ’ s men ( all from the tribe of Benjamin ) were dead .
TLB	2%20Samuel	2	32	Joab and his men took Asahel ’ s body to Bethlehem and buried him beside his father ; then they traveled all night and reached Hebron at daybreak . Footnotes -

TLB	2%20Samuel	3	2	Samuel 3:15 Palti , see
TLB	2%20Samuel	3	3	His second son , Chileab , was born to Abigail , the widow of Nabal of Carmel . The third was Absalom , born to Maacah , the daughter of King Talmai of Geshur .
TLB	2%20Samuel	3	4	The fourth was Adonijah , who was born to Haggith . Then Shephatiah was born to Abital , and
TLB	2%20Samuel	3	5	Ithream was born to Eglah .
TLB	2%20Samuel	3	6	As the war went on , Abner became a very powerful political leader among the followers of Saul .
TLB	2%20Samuel	3	7	He took advantage of his position by sleeping with one of Saul ’ s concubines , a girl named Rizpah . But when Ish-bosheth accused Abner of this ,
TLB	2%20Samuel	3	8	Abner was furious . “ Am I a Judean dog to be kicked around like this ? ” he shouted . “ After all I have done for you and for your father by not betraying you to David , is this my reward—to find fault with me about some woman ? 9-10 May God curse me if I don ’ t do everything I can to take away the entire kingdom from you , all the way from Dan to Beersheba , and give it to David , just as the Lord predicted. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	3	11	Ish-bosheth made no reply , for he was afraid of Abner .
TLB	2%20Samuel	3	12	Then Abner sent messengers to David to discuss a deal—to surrender the kingdom of Israel to him in exchange for becoming commander-in-chief of the combined armies of Israel and Judah .
TLB	2%20Samuel	3	13	“ All right , ” David replied , “ but I will not negotiate with you unless you bring me my wife Michal , Saul ’ s daughter. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	3	14	David then sent this message to Ish-bosheth : “ Give me back my wife Michal , for I bought her with the lives of one hundred Philistines. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	3	15	So Ish-bosheth took her away from her husband Palti . [ a ]
TLB	2%20Samuel	3	16	He followed along behind her as far as Behurim , weeping as he went . Then Abner told him , “ Go on home now. ” So he returned .
TLB	2%20Samuel	3	17	Meanwhile , Abner consulted with the leaders of Israel and reminded them that for a long time they had wanted David as their king .
TLB	2%20Samuel	3	18	“ Now is the time ! ” he told them . “ For the Lord has said , ‘ It is David by whom I will save my people from the Philistines and from all their other enemies. ’ ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	3	19	Abner also talked to the leaders of the tribe of Benjamin ; then he went to Hebron and reported to David his progress with the people of Israel and Benjamin .
TLB	2%20Samuel	3	20	Twenty men accompanied him , and David entertained them with a feast .
TLB	2%20Samuel	3	21	As Abner left , he promised David , “ When I get back I will call a convention of all the people of Israel , and they will elect you as their king , as you ’ ve so long desired. ” So David let Abner return in safety .
TLB	2%20Samuel	3	22	But just after Abner left , Joab and some of David ’ s troops returned from a raid , bringing much loot with them .
TLB	2%20Samuel	3	23	When Joab was told that Abner had just been there visiting the king and had been sent away in peace , 24-25 he rushed to the king , demanding , “ What have you done ? What do you mean by letting him get away ? You know perfectly well that he came to spy on us and that he plans to return and attack us ! ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	3	26	Then Joab sent messengers to catch up with Abner and tell him to come back . They found him at the well of Sirah and he returned with them ; but David knew nothing about it .
TLB	2%20Samuel	3	27	When Abner arrived at Hebron , Joab took him aside at the city gate as if to speak with him privately ; but then he pulled out a dagger and killed him in revenge for the death of his brother Asahel .
TLB	2%20Samuel	3	28	When David heard about it he declared , “ I vow by the Lord that I and my people are innocent of this crime against Abner .
TLB	2%20Samuel	3	29	Joab and his family are the guilty ones . May each of his children be victims of cancer , or be lepers , or be sterile , or die of starvation , or be killed by the sword ! ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	3	30	So Joab and his brother , Abishai , killed Abner because of the death of their brother , Asahel , at the battle of Gibeon .
TLB	2%20Samuel	3	31	Then David said to Joab and to all those who were with him , “ Go into deep mourning for Abner. ” And King David accompanied the bier to the cemetery .
TLB	2%20Samuel	3	32	They buried Abner in Hebron . And the king and all the people wept at the graveside . 33-34 “ Should Abner have died like a fool ? ” the king lamented . “ Your hands were not bound , Your feet were not tied— You were murdered— The victim of a wicked plot. ” And all the people wept again for him . 35-36 David had refused to eat anything the day of the funeral , and now everyone begged him to take a bite of supper . But David vowed that he would eat nothing until sundown . This pleased his people , just as everything else he did pleased them !
TLB	2%20Samuel	3	37	Thus the whole nation , both Judah and Israel , understood from David ’ s actions that he was in no way responsible for Abner ’ s death .
TLB	2%20Samuel	3	38	And David said to his people , “ A great leader and a great man has fallen today in Israel ;
TLB	2%20Samuel	3	39	and even though I am God ’ s chosen king , I can do nothing with these two sons of Zeruiah . May the Lord repay wicked men for their wicked deeds. ” Footnotes -

TLB	2%20Samuel	4	4	( There was a little lame grandson of King Saul ’ s named Mephibosheth , who was the son of Prince Jonathan . He was five years old at the time Saul and Jonathan were killed at the battle of Jezreel . When the news of the outcome of the battle reached the capital , the child ’ s nurse grabbed him and fled , but she fell and dropped him as she was running , and he became lame . )
TLB	2%20Samuel	4	5	Rechab and Baanah arrived at King Ish-bosheth ’ s home one noon as he was taking a nap . 6-7 They walked into the kitchen as though to get a sack of wheat , but then sneaked into his bedroom and murdered him and cut off his head . Taking his head with them , they fled across the desert that night and escaped .
TLB	2%20Samuel	4	8	They presented the head to David at Hebron . “ Look ! ” they exclaimed . “ Here is the head of Ish-bosheth , the son of your enemy Saul who tried to kill you . Today the Lord has given you revenge upon Saul and upon his entire family ! ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	4	9	But David replied , “ I swear by the Lord who saved me from my enemies ,
TLB	2%20Samuel	4	10	that when someone told me , ‘ Saul is dead , ’ thinking he was bringing me good news , I killed him ; that is how I rewarded him for his ‘ glad tidings. ’
TLB	2%20Samuel	4	11	And how much more shall I do to wicked men who kill a good man in his own house and on his bed ! Shall I not demand your lives ? ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	4	12	So David ordered his young men to kill them , and they did . They cut off their hands and feet and hanged their bodies beside the pool in Hebron . And they took Ish-bosheth ’ s head and buried it in Abner ’ s tomb in Hebron . Footnotes -

TLB	2%20Samuel	5	2	“ And even when Saul was our king you were our real leader . The Lord has said that you should be the shepherd and leader of his people. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	5	5	Representatives of all the tribes of Israel now came to David at Hebron and gave him their pledge of loyalty . “ We are your blood brothers , ” they said .
TLB	2%20Samuel	5	3	So David made a contract before the Lord with the leaders of Israel there at Hebron , and they crowned him king of Israel . 4-5 ( He had already been the king of Judah for seven years , since the age of thirty . He then ruled thirty-three years in Jerusalem as king of both Israel and Judah ; so he reigned for forty years altogether . )
TLB	2%20Samuel	5	6	David now led his troops to Jerusalem to fight against the Jebusites who lived there . “ You ’ ll never come in here , ” they told him . “ Even the blind and lame could keep you out ! ” For they thought they were safe .
TLB	2%20Samuel	5	7	But David and his troops defeated them and captured the stronghold of Zion , now called the City of David .
TLB	2%20Samuel	5	8	When the insulting message from the defenders of the city reached David , he told his troops , “ Go up through the water tunnel into the city and destroy those ‘ lame ’ and ‘ blind ’ Jebusites . How I hate them. ” ( That is the origin of the saying , “ Even the blind and the lame could conquer you ! ” )
TLB	2%20Samuel	5	9	So David made the stronghold of Zion ( also called the City of David ) his headquarters . Then , beginning at the old Millo section of the city , he built northward toward the present city center .
TLB	2%20Samuel	5	10	So David became greater and greater , for the Lord God of heaven was with him .
TLB	2%20Samuel	5	11	Then King Hiram of Tyre sent cedar lumber , carpenters , and masons to build a palace for David .
TLB	2%20Samuel	5	12	David now realized why the Lord had made him the king and blessed his kingdom so greatly—it was because God wanted to pour out his kindness on Israel , his chosen people .
TLB	2%20Samuel	5	13	After moving from Hebron to Jerusalem , David married additional wives and concubines , and had many sons and daughters . 14-16 These are his children who were born at Jerusalem : Shammua , Shobab , Nathan , Solomon , Ibhar , Elishua , Nepheg , Japhia , Elishama , Eliada , Eliphelet .
TLB	2%20Samuel	5	17	When the Philistines heard that David had been crowned king of Israel , they tried to capture him ; but David was told that they were coming and went into the stronghold .
TLB	2%20Samuel	5	18	The Philistines arrived and spread out across the valley of Rephaim .
TLB	2%20Samuel	5	19	Then David asked the Lord , “ Shall I go out and fight against them ? Will you defeat them for me ? ” And the Lord replied , “ Yes , go ahead , for I will give them to you. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	5	20	So David went out and fought with them at Baal-perazim and defeated them . “ The Lord did it ! ” he exclaimed . “ He burst through my enemies like a raging flood. ” So he named the place “ Bursting. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	5	21	At that time David and his troops confiscated many idols that had been abandoned by the Philistines .
TLB	2%20Samuel	5	22	But the Philistines returned and again spread out across the valley of Rephaim .
TLB	2%20Samuel	5	23	When David asked the Lord what to do , he replied , “ Don ’ t make a frontal attack . Go behind them and come out by the balsam trees .
TLB	2%20Samuel	5	24	When you hear a sound like marching feet in the tops of the balsam trees , attack ! For it will signify that the Lord has prepared the way for you and will destroy them. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	5	25	So David did as the Lord had instructed him and destroyed the Philistines all the way from Geba to Gezer . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	2%20Samuel	6	6	But when they arrived at the threshing floor of Nacon , the oxen stumbled and Uzzah put out his hand to steady the Ark .
TLB	2%20Samuel	6	3	The Ark was placed upon a new cart and taken from the hillside home of Abinadab . It was driven by Abinadab ’ s sons , Uzzah and Ahio .
TLB	2%20Samuel	6	4	Ahio was walking in front
TLB	2%20Samuel	6	5	and was followed by David and the other leaders of Israel , who were joyously waving branches of juniper trees and playing every sort of musical instrument before the Lord—lyres , harps , tambourines , castanets , and cymbals .
TLB	2%20Samuel	6	7	Then the anger of the Lord flared out against Uzzah and he killed him for doing this , so he died there beside the Ark .
TLB	2%20Samuel	6	8	David was angry at what the Lord had done , and named the spot “ The Place of Wrath upon Uzzah ” ( which it is still called to this day ) .
TLB	2%20Samuel	6	9	David was now afraid of the Lord and asked , “ How can I ever bring the Ark home ? ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	6	10	So he decided against taking it into the City of David , but carried it instead to the home of Obed-edom , who had come from Gath .
TLB	2%20Samuel	6	11	It remained there for three months , and the Lord blessed Obed-edom and all his household .
TLB	2%20Samuel	6	12	When David heard this , he brought the Ark to the City of David with a great celebration .
TLB	2%20Samuel	6	13	After the men who were carrying it had gone six paces , they stopped and waited so that he could sacrifice an ox and a fat lamb .
TLB	2%20Samuel	6	14	And David danced before the Lord with all his might and was wearing priests ’ clothing . [ a ]
TLB	2%20Samuel	6	15	So Israel brought home the Ark of the Lord with much shouting and blowing of trumpets .
TLB	2%20Samuel	6	16	( But as the procession came into the city , Michal , Saul ’ s daughter , watched from a window and saw King David leaping and dancing before the Lord ; and she was filled with contempt for him . )
TLB	2%20Samuel	6	17	The Ark was placed inside the tent that David had prepared for it ; and he sacrificed burnt offerings and peace offerings to the Lord .
TLB	2%20Samuel	6	18	Then he blessed the people in the name of the Lord of heaven
TLB	2%20Samuel	6	19	and gave a present to everyone—men and women alike—of a loaf of bread , some wine , and a cake of raisins . When it was all over , and everyone had gone home ,
TLB	2%20Samuel	6	20	David returned to bless his family . But Michal came out to meet him and exclaimed in disgust , “ How glorious the king of Israel looked today ! He exposed himself to the girls along the street like a common pervert ! ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	6	21	David retorted , “ I was dancing before the Lord who chose me above your father and his family and who appointed me as leader of Israel , the people of the Lord ! So I am willing to act like a fool in order to show my joy in the Lord .
TLB	2%20Samuel	6	22	Yes , and I am willing to look even more foolish than this , but I will be respected by the girls of whom you spoke ! ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	6	23	So Michal was childless throughout her life . Footnotes -

TLB	2%20Samuel	7	7	And I have never once complained to Israel ’ s leaders , the shepherds of my people . Have I ever asked them , ‘ Why haven ’ t you built me a beautiful cedar temple ? ’
TLB	2%20Samuel	7	3	“ Go ahead with what you have in mind , ” Nathan replied , “ for the Lord is with you. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	7	4	But that night the Lord said to Nathan ,
TLB	2%20Samuel	7	5	“ Tell my servant David not to do it ! [ a ]
TLB	2%20Samuel	7	6	For I have never lived in a temple . My home has been a tent ever since the time I brought Israel out of Egypt .
TLB	2%20Samuel	7	8	“ Now go and give this message to David from the Lord of heaven : ‘ I chose you to be the leader of my people Israel when you were a mere shepherd , tending your sheep in the pastureland .
TLB	2%20Samuel	7	9	I have been with you wherever you have gone and have destroyed your enemies . And I will make your name greater yet , so that you will be one of the most famous men in the world ! 10-11 I have selected a homeland for my people from which they will never have to move . It will be their own land where the heathen nations won ’ t bother them as they did when the judges ruled my people . There will be no more wars against you ; and your descendants shall rule this land for generations to come !
TLB	2%20Samuel	7	12	For when you die , I will put one of your sons upon your throne , and I will make his kingdom strong .
TLB	2%20Samuel	7	13	He is the one who shall build me a temple . And I will continue his kingdom into eternity .
TLB	2%20Samuel	7	14	I will be his father and he shall be my son . If he sins , I will use other nations to punish him ,
TLB	2%20Samuel	7	15	but my love and kindness shall not leave him as I took it from Saul , your predecessor .
TLB	2%20Samuel	7	16	Your family shall rule my kingdom forever. ’ ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	7	17	So Nathan went back to David and told him everything the Lord had said .
TLB	2%20Samuel	7	18	Then David went into the Tabernacle and sat before the Lord and prayed , “ O Lord God , why have you showered your blessings on such an insignificant person as I am ?
TLB	2%20Samuel	7	19	And now , in addition to everything else , you speak of giving me an eternal dynasty ! Such generosity is far beyond any human standard ! O Lord God !
TLB	2%20Samuel	7	20	What can I say ? For you know what I am like !
TLB	2%20Samuel	7	21	You are doing all these things just because you promised to and because you want to !
TLB	2%20Samuel	7	22	How great you are , Lord God ! We have never heard of any other God like you . And there is no other God .
TLB	2%20Samuel	7	23	What other nation in all the earth has received such blessings as Israel , your people ? For you have rescued your chosen nation in order to bring glory to your name . You have done great miracles to destroy Egypt and its gods .
TLB	2%20Samuel	7	24	You chose Israel to be your people forever , and you became our God .
TLB	2%20Samuel	7	25	“ And now , Lord God , do as you have promised concerning me and my family .
TLB	2%20Samuel	7	26	And may you be eternally honored when you have established Israel as your people and have established my dynasty before you .
TLB	2%20Samuel	7	27	For you have revealed to me , O Lord of heaven , God of Israel , that I am the first of a dynasty which will rule your people forever ; that is why I have been bold enough to pray this prayer of acceptance .
TLB	2%20Samuel	7	28	For you are indeed God , and your words are truth ; and you have promised me these good things—
TLB	2%20Samuel	7	29	so do as you have promised ! Bless me and my family forever ! May our dynasty continue on and on before you ; for you , Lord God , have promised it. ” Footnotes -

TLB	2%20Samuel	8	2	Samuel 8:18 captain of his bodyguard , literally , “ the Cherethites and Pelethites. ” were his assistants , literally , “ were priests ” ; see
TLB	2%20Samuel	8	8	He also carried back to Jerusalem a very large amount of bronze from Hadadezer ’ s cities of Betah and Berothai .
TLB	2%20Samuel	8	3	He also destroyed the forces of King Hadadezer ( son of Rehob ) of Zobah in a battle at the Euphrates River , for Hadadezer had attempted to regain his power .
TLB	2%20Samuel	8	4	David captured seventeen hundred cavalry and twenty thousand infantry ; then he lamed all of the chariot horses except for one hundred teams .
TLB	2%20Samuel	8	5	He also slaughtered twenty-two thousand Syrians from Damascus when they came to help Hadadezer .
TLB	2%20Samuel	8	6	David placed several army garrisons in Damascus , and the Syrians became David ’ s subjects and brought him annual tribute money . So the Lord gave him victories wherever he turned .
TLB	2%20Samuel	8	7	David brought the gold shields to Jerusalem which King Hadadezer ’ s officers had used .
TLB	2%20Samuel	8	9	When King Toi of Hamath heard about David ’ s victory over the army of Hadadezer ,
TLB	2%20Samuel	8	10	he sent his son Joram to congratulate him , for Hadadezer and Toi were enemies . He gave David presents made from silver , gold , and bronze . 11-12 David dedicated all of these to the Lord , along with the silver and gold he had taken from Syria , Moab , Ammon , the Philistines , Amalek , and King Hadadezer .
TLB	2%20Samuel	8	13	So David became very famous . After his return he destroyed eighteen thousand Edomites [ a ] in Salt Valley ,
TLB	2%20Samuel	8	14	and then placed garrisons throughout Edom , so that the entire nation was forced to pay tribute to Israel—another example of the way the Lord made him victorious wherever he went .
TLB	2%20Samuel	8	15	David reigned with justice over Israel and was fair to everyone .
TLB	2%20Samuel	8	16	The general of his army was Joab ( son of Zeruiah ) , and his secretary of state was Jehoshaphat ( son of Ahilud ) .
TLB	2%20Samuel	8	17	Zadok ( son of Ahitub ) and Ahimelech ( son of Abiathar ) were the High Priests , and Seraiah was the king ’ s private secretary .
TLB	2%20Samuel	8	18	Benaiah ( son of Jehoiada ) was captain of his bodyguard , [ b ] and David ’ s sons were his assistants . Footnotes -

TLB	2%20Samuel	9	2	He heard about a man named Ziba , who had been one of Saul ’ s servants , and summoned him . “ Are you Ziba ? ” the king asked . “ Yes , sir , I am , ” he replied .
TLB	2%20Samuel	9	9	Then the king summoned Saul ’ s servant Ziba . “ I have given your master ’ s grandson everything that belonged to Saul and his family , ” he said . 10-11 “ You and your sons and servants are to farm the land for him , to produce food for his family ; but he will live here with me. ” Ziba , who had fifteen sons and twenty servants , replied , “ Sir , I will do all you have commanded. ” And from that time on , Mephibosheth ate regularly with King David , as though he were one of his own sons .
TLB	2%20Samuel	9	3	The king then asked him , “ Is anyone left from Saul ’ s family ? If so , I want to fulfill a sacred vow by being kind to him. ” “ Yes , ” Ziba replied , “ Jonathan ’ s lame son is still alive. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	9	4	“ Where is he ? ” the king asked . “ In Lo-debar , ” Ziba told him . “ At the home of Machir. ” 5-6 So King David sent for Mephibosheth—Jonathan ’ s son and Saul ’ s grandson . Mephibosheth arrived in great fear and greeted the king in deep humility , bowing low before him .
TLB	2%20Samuel	9	7	But David said , “ Don ’ t be afraid ! I ’ ve asked you to come so that I can be kind to you because of my vow to your father Jonathan . I will restore to you all the land of your grandfather Saul , and you shall live here at the palace ! ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	9	8	Mephibosheth fell to the ground before the king . “ Should the king show kindness to a dead dog like me ? ” he exclaimed .
TLB	2%20Samuel	9	12	Mephibosheth had a young son , Mica . All the household of Ziba became Mephibosheth ’ s servants ,
TLB	2%20Samuel	9	13	but Mephibosheth ( who was lame in both feet ) moved to Jerusalem to live at the palace . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	2%20Samuel	10	2	“ I am going to show special respect for him , ” David said , “ because his father , Nahash , was always so loyal and kind to me. ” So David sent ambassadors to express regrets to Hanun about his father ’ s death .
TLB	2%20Samuel	10	10	He left the rest of the army to his brother Abishai , who was to attack the city .
TLB	2%20Samuel	10	3	But Hanun ’ s officers told him , “ These men aren ’ t here to honor your father ! David has sent them to spy out the city before attacking it ! ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	10	4	So Hanun took David ’ s men and shaved off half their beards and cut their robes off at the buttocks and sent them home half naked .
TLB	2%20Samuel	10	5	When David heard what had happened he told them to stay at Jericho until their beards grew out ; for the men were very embarrassed over their appearance .
TLB	2%20Samuel	10	6	Now the people of Ammon realized how seriously they had angered David , so they hired twenty thousand Syrian mercenaries from the lands of Rehob and Zobah , one thousand from the king of Maacah , and ten thousand from the land of Tob . 7-8 When David heard about this , he sent Joab and the entire Israeli army to attack them . The Ammonites defended the gates of their city while the Syrians from Zobah , Rehob , Tob , and Maacah fought in the fields .
TLB	2%20Samuel	10	9	When Joab realized that he would have to fight on two fronts , he selected the best fighters in his army , placed them under his personal command , and took them out to fight the Syrians in the fields .
TLB	2%20Samuel	10	11	“ If I need assistance against the Syrians , come out and help me , ” Joab instructed him . “ And if the Ammonites are too strong for you , I will come and help you .
TLB	2%20Samuel	10	12	Courage ! We must really act like men today if we are going to save our people and the cities of our God . May the Lord ’ s will be done. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	10	13	And when Joab and his troops attacked , the Syrians began to run away .
TLB	2%20Samuel	10	14	Then , when the Ammonites saw the Syrians running , they ran too , and retreated into the city . Afterwards Joab returned to Jerusalem . 15-16 The Syrians now realized that they were no match for Israel . So when they regrouped , they were joined by additional Syrian troops summoned by Hadadezer from the other side of the Euphrates River . These troops arrived at Helam under the command of Shobach , the commander-in-chief of all of Hadadezer ’ s forces .
TLB	2%20Samuel	10	17	When David heard what was happening , he personally led the Israeli army to Helam , where the Syrians attacked him .
TLB	2%20Samuel	10	18	But again the Syrians fled from the Israelis , this time leaving seven hundred charioteers dead on the field , also forty thousand cavalrymen , including General Shobach .
TLB	2%20Samuel	10	19	When Hadadezer ’ s allies saw that the Syrians had been defeated , they surrendered to David and became his servants . And the Syrians were afraid to help the Ammonites anymore after that . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	2%20Samuel	11	11	Uriah replied , “ The Ark and the armies and the general and his officers are camping out in open fields , and should I go home to wine and dine and sleep with my wife ? I swear that I will never be guilty of acting like that. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	11	3	He sent to find out who she was and was told that she was Bathsheba , the daughter of Eliam and the wife of Uriah .
TLB	2%20Samuel	11	4	Then David sent for her and when she came he slept with her . ( She had just completed the purification rites after menstruation . ) Then she returned home .
TLB	2%20Samuel	11	5	When she found that he had gotten her pregnant she sent a message to inform him .
TLB	2%20Samuel	11	6	So David dispatched a memo to Joab : “ Send me Uriah the Hittite. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	11	7	When he arrived , David asked him how Joab and the army were getting along and how the war was prospering .
TLB	2%20Samuel	11	8	Then he told him to go home and relax , and he sent a present to him at his home .
TLB	2%20Samuel	11	9	But Uriah didn ’ t go there . He stayed that night at the gateway of the palace with the other servants of the king .
TLB	2%20Samuel	11	10	When David heard what Uriah had done , he summoned him and asked him , “ What ’ s the matter with you ? Why didn ’ t you go home to your wife last night after being away for so long ? ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	11	12	“ Well , stay here tonight , ” David told him , “ and tomorrow you may return to the army. ” So Uriah stayed around the palace .
TLB	2%20Samuel	11	13	David invited him to dinner and got him drunk ; but even so he didn ’ t go home that night , but again he slept at the entry to the palace .
TLB	2%20Samuel	11	14	Finally the next morning David wrote a letter to Joab and gave it to Uriah to deliver .
TLB	2%20Samuel	11	15	The letter instructed Joab to put Uriah at the front of the hottest part of the battle—and then pull back and leave him there to die !
TLB	2%20Samuel	11	16	So Joab assigned Uriah to a spot close to the besieged city where he knew that the enemies ’ best men were fighting ;
TLB	2%20Samuel	11	17	and Uriah was killed along with several other Israeli soldiers .
TLB	2%20Samuel	11	18	When Joab sent a report to David of how the battle was going , 19-21 he told his messenger , “ If the king is angry and asks , ‘ Why did the troops go so close to the city ? Didn ’ t they know there would be shooting from the walls ? Wasn ’ t Abimelech killed at Thebez by a woman who threw down a millstone on him ? ’ —then tell him , ‘ Uriah was killed too. ’ ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	11	22	So the messenger arrived at Jerusalem and gave the report to David .
TLB	2%20Samuel	11	23	“ The enemy came out against us , ” he said , “ and as we chased them back to the city gates ,
TLB	2%20Samuel	11	24	the men on the wall attacked us ; and some of our men were killed , and Uriah the Hittite is dead too. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	11	25	“ Well , tell Joab not to be discouraged , ” David said . “ The sword kills one as well as another ! [ b ] Fight harder next time , and conquer the city ; tell him he is doing well. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	11	26	When Bathsheba heard that her husband was dead , she mourned for him ;
TLB	2%20Samuel	11	27	then , when the period of mourning was over , David sent for her and brought her to the palace and she became one of his wives ; and she gave birth to his son . But the Lord was very displeased with what David had done . Footnotes -

TLB	2%20Samuel	12	12	You did it secretly , but I will do this to you openly , in the sight of all Israel. ’ ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	12	3	and the other very poor , owning nothing but a little lamb he had managed to buy . It was his children ’ s pet , and he fed it from his own plate and let it drink from his own cup ; he cuddled it in his arms like a baby daughter .
TLB	2%20Samuel	12	4	Recently a guest arrived at the home of the rich man . But instead of killing a lamb from his own flocks for food for the traveler , he took the poor man ’ s lamb and roasted it and served it. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	12	5	David was furious . “ I swear by the living God , ” he vowed , “ any man who would do a thing like that should be put to death ;
TLB	2%20Samuel	12	6	he shall repay four lambs to the poor man for the one he stole and for having no pity. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	12	7	Then Nathan said to David , “ You are that rich man ! The Lord God of Israel says , ‘ I made you king of Israel and saved you from the power of Saul .
TLB	2%20Samuel	12	8	I gave you his palace and his wives and the kingdoms of Israel and Judah ; and if that had not been enough , I would have given you much , much more .
TLB	2%20Samuel	12	9	Why , then , have you despised the laws of God and done this horrible deed ? For you have murdered Uriah and stolen his wife .
TLB	2%20Samuel	12	10	Therefore murder shall be a constant threat in your family from this time on because you have insulted me by taking Uriah ’ s wife .
TLB	2%20Samuel	12	11	I vow that because of what you have done , I will cause your own household to rebel against you . I will give your wives to another man , and he will go to bed with them in public view . [ a ]
TLB	2%20Samuel	12	13	“ I have sinned against the Lord , ” David confessed to Nathan . Then Nathan replied , “ Yes , but the Lord has forgiven you , and you won ’ t die for this sin .
TLB	2%20Samuel	12	14	But you have given great opportunity to the enemies of the Lord to despise and blaspheme him , so your child shall die. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	12	15	Then Nathan returned to his home . And the Lord made Bathsheba ’ s baby deathly sick .
TLB	2%20Samuel	12	16	David begged him to spare the child and went without food , and lay all night before the Lord on the bare earth .
TLB	2%20Samuel	12	17	The leaders of the nation pleaded with him to get up and eat with them , but he refused .
TLB	2%20Samuel	12	18	Then , on the seventh day , the baby died . David ’ s aides were afraid to tell him . “ He was so broken up about the baby being sick , ” they said , “ what will he do to himself when we tell him the child is dead ? ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	12	19	But when David saw them whispering , he realized what had happened . “ Is the baby dead ? ” he asked . “ Yes , ” they replied , “ he is. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	12	20	Then David got up off the ground , washed himself , brushed his hair , changed his clothes , and went into the Tabernacle and worshiped the Lord . Then he returned to the palace and ate .
TLB	2%20Samuel	12	21	His aides were amazed . “ We don ’ t understand you , ” they told him . “ While the baby was still living , you wept and refused to eat ; but now that the baby is dead , you have stopped your mourning and are eating again. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	12	22	David replied , “ I fasted and wept while the child was alive , for I said , ‘ Perhaps the Lord will be gracious to me and let the child live. ’
TLB	2%20Samuel	12	23	But why should I fast when he is dead ? Can I bring him back again ? I shall go to him , but he shall not return to me. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	12	24	Then David comforted Bathsheba ; and when he slept with her , she conceived and gave birth to a son and named him Solomon . And the Lord loved the baby ,
TLB	2%20Samuel	12	25	and sent congratulations [ b ] and blessings through Nathan the prophet . David nicknamed the baby Jedidiah ( meaning , “ Beloved of Jehovah ” ) because of the Lord ’ s interest . 26-27 Meanwhile Joab and the Israeli army were successfully ending their siege of Rabbah the capital of Ammon . Joab sent messengers to tell David , “ Rabbah and its beautiful harbor are ours ! [ c ]
TLB	2%20Samuel	12	28	Now bring the rest of the army and finish the job , so that you will get the credit for the victory instead of me. ” 29-30 So David led his army to Rabbah and captured it . Tremendous amounts of loot were carried back to Jerusalem , and David took the king of Rabbah ’ s crown—a $ 50,000 treasure made from solid gold set with gems—and placed it on his own head .
TLB	2%20Samuel	12	31	He made slaves of the people of the city and made them labor with saws , picks , and axes and work in the brick kilns ; [ d ] that is the way he treated all of the cities of the Ammonites . Then David and the army returned to Jerusalem . Footnotes -

TLB	2%20Samuel	13	13	Where could I go in my shame ? And you would be called one of the greatest fools in Israel . Please , just speak to the king about it , for he will let you marry me. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	13	3	But Amnon had a very crafty friend—his cousin Jonadab ( the son of David ’ s brother Shimeah ) .
TLB	2%20Samuel	13	4	One day Jonadab said to Amnon , “ What ’ s the trouble ? Why should the son of a king look so haggard morning after morning ? ” So Amnon told him , “ I am in love with Tamar , my half sister. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	13	5	“ Well , ” Jonadab said , “ I ’ ll tell you what to do . Go back to bed and pretend you are sick ; when your father comes to see you , ask him to let Tamar come and prepare some food for you . Tell him you ’ ll feel better if she feeds you. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	13	6	So Amnon did . And when the king came to see him , Amnon asked him for this favor—that his sister Tamar be permitted to come and cook a little something for him to eat .
TLB	2%20Samuel	13	7	David agreed and sent word to Tamar to go to Amnon ’ s quarters and prepare some food for him .
TLB	2%20Samuel	13	8	So she did and went into his bedroom so that he could watch her mix some dough ; then she baked some special bread for him .
TLB	2%20Samuel	13	9	But when she set the serving tray before him , he refused to eat ! “ Everyone get out of here , ” he told his servants ; so they all left the apartment .
TLB	2%20Samuel	13	10	Then he said to Tamar , “ Now bring me the food again here in my bedroom and feed it to me. ” So Tamar took it to him .
TLB	2%20Samuel	13	11	But as she was standing there before him , he grabbed her and demanded , “ Come to bed with me , my darling. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	13	12	“ Oh , Amnon , ” she cried . “ Don ’ t be foolish ! Don ’ t do this to me ! You know what a serious crime it is in Israel . [ b ]
TLB	2%20Samuel	13	14	But he wouldn ’ t listen to her ; and since he was stronger than she , he forced her .
TLB	2%20Samuel	13	15	Then suddenly his love turned to hate , and now he hated her more than he had loved her . “ Get out of here ! ” he snarled at her .
TLB	2%20Samuel	13	16	“ No , no ! ” she cried . “ To reject me now is a greater crime than the other you did to me. ” But he wouldn ’ t listen to her . 17-18 He shouted for his valet and demanded , “ Throw this woman out and lock the door behind her. ” So he put her out . She was wearing a long robe with sleeves , as was the custom in those days for virgin daughters of the king .
TLB	2%20Samuel	13	19	Now she tore the robe and put ashes on her head and with her head in her hands went away crying .
TLB	2%20Samuel	13	20	Her brother Absalom asked her , “ Is it true that Amnon raped you ? Don ’ t be so upset , since it ’ s all in the family anyway . It ’ s not anything to worry about ! ” So Tamar lived as a desolate woman in her brother Absalom ’ s quarters . 21-24 When King David heard what had happened , he was very angry , but Absalom said nothing one way or the other about this to Amnon . However , he hated him with a deep hatred because of what he had done to his sister . Then , two years later , when Absalom ’ s sheep were being sheared at Baal-hazor in Ephraim , Absalom invited his father and all his brothers to come to a feast to celebrate the occasion .
TLB	2%20Samuel	13	25	The king replied , “ No , my boy ; if we all came , we would be too much of a burden on you. ” Absalom pressed him , but he wouldn ’ t come , though he sent his thanks .
TLB	2%20Samuel	13	26	“ Well , then , ” Absalom said , “ if you can ’ t come , how about sending my brother Amnon instead ? ” “ Why Amnon ? ” the king asked .
TLB	2%20Samuel	13	27	Absalom kept on urging the matter until finally the king agreed and let all of his sons attend , including Amnon .
TLB	2%20Samuel	13	28	Absalom told his men , “ Wait until Amnon gets drunk , then , at my signal , kill him ! Don ’ t be afraid . I ’ m the one who gives the orders around here , and this is a command . Take courage and do it ! ” 29-30 So they murdered Amnon . Then the other sons of the king jumped on their mules and fled . As they were on the way back to Jerusalem , the report reached David : “ Absalom has killed all of your sons , and not one is left alive ! ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	13	31	The king jumped up , ripped off his robe , and fell prostrate to the ground . His aides also tore their clothes in horror and sorrow . 32-33 But just then Jonadab ( the son of David ’ s brother Shimeah ) arrived and said , “ No , not all have been killed ! It was only Amnon ! Absalom has been plotting this ever since Amnon raped Tamar . No , no ! Your sons aren ’ t all dead ! It was only Amnon. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	13	34	Meanwhile Absalom escaped . Now the watchman on the Jerusalem wall saw a great crowd coming toward the city along the road at the side of the hill .
TLB	2%20Samuel	13	35	“ See ! ” Jonadab told the king . “ There they are now ! Your sons are coming , just as I said. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	13	36	They soon arrived , weeping and sobbing , and the king and his officials wept with them . 37-39 Absalom fled to King Talmai of Geshur [ c ] ( the son of Ammihud ) and stayed there three years . Meanwhile David , now reconciled to Amnon ’ s death , longed day after day for fellowship with his son Absalom . Footnotes -

[ a ] 15-16 But I have come to plead with you for my son because my life and my son ’ s life have been threatened , and I said to myself , ‘ Perhaps the king will listen to me and rescue us from those who would end our existence in Israel .
TLB	2%20Samuel	14	4	When the woman approached the king , she fell face downward on the floor in front of him , and cried out , “ O king ! Help me ! ” 5-6 “ What ’ s the trouble ? ” he asked . “ I am a widow , ” she replied , “ and my two sons had a fight out in the field , and since no one was there to part them , one of them was killed .
TLB	2%20Samuel	14	7	Now the rest of the family is demanding that I surrender my other son to them to be executed for murdering his brother . But if I do that , I will have no one left , and my husband ’ s name will be destroyed from the face of the earth. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	14	8	“ Leave it with me , ” the king told her . “ I ’ ll see to it that no one touches him. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	14	9	“ Oh , thank you , my lord , ” she replied . “ And I ’ ll take the responsibility if you are criticized for helping me like this. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	14	10	“ Don ’ t worry about that ! ” the king replied . “ If anyone objects , bring him to me ; I can assure you he will never complain again ! ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	14	11	Then she said , “ Please swear to me by God that you won ’ t let anyone harm my son . I want no more bloodshed. ” “ I vow by God , ” he replied , “ that not a hair of your son ’ s head shall be disturbed ! ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	14	12	“ Please let me ask one more thing of you ! ” she said . “ Go ahead , ” he replied . “ Speak ! ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	14	13	“ Why don ’ t you do as much for all the people of God as you have promised to do for me ? ” she asked . “ You have convicted yourself in making this decision , because you have refused to bring home your own banished son .
TLB	2%20Samuel	14	17	Yes , the king will give us peace again. ’ I know that you are like an angel of God and can discern good from evil . May God be with you. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	14	18	“ I want to know one thing , ” the king replied . “ Yes , my lord ? ” she asked .
TLB	2%20Samuel	14	19	“ Did Joab send you here ? ” And the woman replied , “ How can I deny it ? Yes , Joab sent me and told me what to say .
TLB	2%20Samuel	14	20	He did it in order to place the matter before you in a different light . But you are as wise as an angel of God , and you know everything that happens ! ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	14	21	So the king sent for Joab and told him , “ All right , go and bring back Absalom. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	14	22	Joab fell to the ground before the king and blessed him and said , “ At last I know that you like me ! For you have granted me this request ! ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	14	23	Then Joab went to Geshur and brought Absalom back to Jerusalem .
TLB	2%20Samuel	14	24	“ He may go to his own quarters , ” the king ordered , “ but he must never come here . I refuse to see him. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	14	25	Now no one in Israel was such a handsome specimen of manhood as Absalom , and no one else received such praise .
TLB	2%20Samuel	14	26	He cut his hair only once a year—and then only because it weighed three pounds and was too much of a load to carry around !
TLB	2%20Samuel	14	27	He had three sons and one daughter , Tamar , who was a very beautiful girl .
TLB	2%20Samuel	14	28	After Absalom had been in Jerusalem for two years and had not yet seen the king ,
TLB	2%20Samuel	14	29	he sent for Joab to ask him to intercede for him ; but Joab wouldn ’ t come . Absalom sent for him again , but again he refused to come .
TLB	2%20Samuel	14	30	So Absalom said to his servants , “ Go and set fire to that barley field of Joab ’ s next to mine , ” and they did .
TLB	2%20Samuel	14	31	Then Joab came to Absalom and demanded , “ Why did your servants set my field on fire ? ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	14	32	And Absalom replied , “ Because I wanted you to ask the king why he brought me back from Geshur if he didn ’ t intend to see me . I might as well have stayed there . Let me have an interview with the king ; then if he finds that I am guilty of murder , let him execute me. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	14	33	So Joab told the king what Absalom had said . Then at last David summoned Absalom , and he came and bowed low before the king , and David kissed him . Footnotes -

TLB	2%20Samuel	15	2	Samuel 15:9 So Absalom went to Hebron . Hebron was King David ’ s first capital , and it was also Absalom ’ s hometown , whose people doubtless were very proud of him . The Living Bible copyright ©
TLB	2%20Samuel	15	15	“ We are with you , ” his aides replied . “ Do as you think best. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	15	3	He would say , “ I can see that you are right in this matter ; it ’ s unfortunate that the king doesn ’ t have anyone to assist him in hearing these cases .
TLB	2%20Samuel	15	4	I surely wish I were the judge ; then anyone with a lawsuit could come to me , and I would give him justice ! ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	15	5	And when anyone came to bow to him , Absalom wouldn ’ t let him , but shook his hand instead ! [ a ]
TLB	2%20Samuel	15	6	So in this way Absalom stole the hearts of all the people of Israel . 7-8 After four years , Absalom said to the king , “ Let me go to Hebron to sacrifice to the Lord in fulfillment of a vow I made to him while I was at Geshur—that if he would bring me back to Jerusalem , I would sacrifice to him. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	15	9	“ All right , ” the king told him , “ go and fulfill your vow. ” So Absalom went to Hebron . [ b ]
TLB	2%20Samuel	15	10	But while he was there , he sent spies to every part of Israel to incite rebellion against the king . “ As soon as you hear the trumpets , ” his message read , “ you will know that Absalom has been crowned in Hebron. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	15	11	He took two hundred men from Jerusalem with him as guests , but they knew nothing of his intentions .
TLB	2%20Samuel	15	12	While he was offering the sacrifice , he sent for Ahithophel , one of David ’ s counselors who lived in Giloh . Ahithophel declared for Absalom , as did more and more others . So the conspiracy became very strong .
TLB	2%20Samuel	15	13	A messenger soon arrived in Jerusalem to tell King David , “ All Israel has joined Absalom in a conspiracy against you ! ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	15	14	“ Then we must flee at once or it will be too late ! ” was David ’ s instant response to his men . “ If we get out of the city before he arrives , both we and the city of Jerusalem will be saved. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	15	16	So the king and his household set out at once . He left no one behind except ten of his young wives to keep the palace in order . 17-18 David paused at the edge of the city to let his troops move past him to lead the way—six hundred Gittites who had come with him from Gath , and the Cherethites and Pelethites . 19-20 But suddenly the king turned to Ittai , the captain of the six hundred Gittites , and said to him , “ What are you doing here ? Go on back with your men to Jerusalem , to your king , for you are a guest in Israel , a foreigner in exile . It seems but yesterday that you arrived , and now today should I force you to wander with us , who knows where ? Go on back and take your troops with you , and may the Lord be merciful to you. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	15	21	But Ittai replied , “ I vow by God and by your own life that wherever you go , I will go , no matter what happens—whether it means life or death. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	15	22	So David replied , “ All right , come with us. ” Then Ittai and his six hundred men and their families went along .
TLB	2%20Samuel	15	23	There was deep sadness throughout the city as the king and his retinue passed by , crossed Kidron Brook , and went out into the country .
TLB	2%20Samuel	15	24	Abiathar and Zadok and the Levites took the Ark of the Covenant of God and set it down beside the road until everyone had passed . 25-26 Then , following David ’ s instructions , Zadok took the Ark back into the city . “ If the Lord sees fit , ” David said , “ he will bring me back to see the Ark and the Tabernacle again . But if he is through with me , well , let him do what seems best to him. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	15	27	Then the king told Zadok , “ Look , here is my plan . Return quietly to the city with your son Ahimaaz and Abiathar ’ s son Jonathan .
TLB	2%20Samuel	15	28	I will stop at the ford of the Jordan River and wait there for a message from you . Let me know what happens in Jerusalem before I disappear into the wilderness. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	15	29	So Zadok and Abiathar carried the Ark of God back into the city and stayed there .
TLB	2%20Samuel	15	30	David walked up the road that led to the Mount of Olives , weeping as he went . His head was covered and his feet were bare as a sign of mourning . And the people who were with him covered their heads and wept as they climbed the mountain .
TLB	2%20Samuel	15	31	When someone told David that Ahithophel , his advisor , was backing Absalom , David prayed , “ O Lord , please make Ahithophel give Absalom foolish advice ! ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	15	32	As they reached the spot at the top of the Mount of Olives where people worshiped God , David found Hushai the Archite waiting for him with torn clothing and earth upon his head . 33-34 But David told him , “ If you go with me , you will only be a burden ; return to Jerusalem and tell Absalom , ‘ I will counsel you as I did your father. ’ Then you can frustrate and counter Ahithophel ’ s advice . 35-36 Zadok and Abiathar , the priests , are there . Tell them the plans that are being made to capture me , and they will send their sons Ahimaaz and Jonathan to find me and tell me what is going on. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	15	37	So David ’ s friend Hushai returned to the city , getting there just as Absalom arrived . Footnotes -

TLB	2%20Samuel	16	2	Samuel 16:21 they will all close ranks behind you , literally , “ the hands of all who are with you will be strengthened. ” The Living Bible copyright ©
TLB	2%20Samuel	16	16	When David ’ s friend , Hushai the Archite , arrived , he went immediately to see Absalom . “ Long live the king ! ” he exclaimed . “ Long live the king ! ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	16	3	“ And where is Mephibosheth ? ” the king asked him . “ He stayed at Jerusalem , ” Ziba replied . “ He said , ‘ Now I ’ ll get to be king ! Today I will get back the kingdom of my father , Saul. ’ ” [ a ]
TLB	2%20Samuel	16	4	“ In that case , ” the king told Ziba , “ I give you everything he owns. ” “ Thank you , thank you , sir , ” Ziba replied .
TLB	2%20Samuel	16	5	As David and his party passed Bahurim , a man came out of the village cursing them . It was Shimei , the son of Gera , a member of Saul ’ s family .
TLB	2%20Samuel	16	6	He threw stones at the king and the king ’ s officers and all the mighty warriors who surrounded them ! 7-8 “ Get out of here , you murderer , you scoundrel ! ” he shouted at David . “ The Lord is paying you back for murdering King Saul and his family ; you stole his throne and now the Lord has given it to your son Absalom ! At last you will taste some of your own medicine , you murderer ! ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	16	9	“ Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king ? ” Abishai demanded . “ Let me go over and strike off his head ! ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	16	10	“ No ! ” the king said . “ If the Lord has told him to curse me , who am I to say no ?
TLB	2%20Samuel	16	11	My own son is trying to kill me , and this Benjaminite is merely cursing me . Leave him alone , for no doubt the Lord has told him to do it .
TLB	2%20Samuel	16	12	And perhaps the Lord will see that I am being wronged and will bless me because of these curses. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	16	13	So David and his men continued on , and Shimei kept pace with them on a nearby hillside , cursing as he went and throwing stones at David and tossing dust into the air .
TLB	2%20Samuel	16	14	The king and all those who were with him were weary by the time they reached Bahurim , so they stayed there awhile and rested .
TLB	2%20Samuel	16	15	Meanwhile , Absalom and his men arrived at Jerusalem , accompanied by Ahithophel .
TLB	2%20Samuel	16	17	“ Is this the way to treat your friend David ? ” Absalom asked him . “ Why aren ’ t you with him ? ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	16	18	“ Because I work for the man who is chosen by the Lord and by Israel , ” Hushai replied .
TLB	2%20Samuel	16	19	“ And anyway , why shouldn ’ t I ? I helped your father and now I will help you ! ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	16	20	Then Absalom turned to Ahithophel and asked him , “ What shall I do next ? ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	16	21	Ahithophel told him , “ Go and sleep with your father ’ s wives , for he has left them here to keep the house . Then all Israel will know that you have insulted him beyond the possibility of reconciliation , and they will all close ranks behind you. ” [ b ]
TLB	2%20Samuel	16	22	So a tent was erected on the roof of the palace where everybody could see it , and Absalom went into the tent to lie with his father ’ s wives .
TLB	2%20Samuel	16	23	( Absalom did whatever Ahithophel told him to , just as David had ; for every word Ahithophel spoke seemed as wise as though it had come directly from the mouth of God . ) Footnotes -

TLB	2%20Samuel	17	2	Samuel
TLB	2%20Samuel	17	17	Jonathan and Ahimaaz had been staying at En-rogel so as not to be seen entering and leaving the city . Arrangements had been made for a servant girl to carry to them the messages they were to take to King David .
TLB	2%20Samuel	17	4	Absalom and all the elders of Israel approved of the plan ,
TLB	2%20Samuel	17	5	but Absalom said , “ Ask Hushai the Archite what he thinks about this. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	17	6	When Hushai arrived , Absalom told him what Ahithophel had said . “ What is your opinion ? ” Absalom asked him . “ Should we follow Ahithophel ’ s advice ? If not , speak up. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	17	7	“ Well , ” Hushai replied , “ this time I think Ahithophel has made a mistake .
TLB	2%20Samuel	17	8	You know your father and his men ; they are mighty warriors and are probably as upset as a mother bear who has been robbed of her cubs . And your father is an old soldier and isn ’ t going to be spending the night among the troops ;
TLB	2%20Samuel	17	9	he has probably already hidden in some pit or cave . And when he comes out and attacks and a few of your men fall , there will be panic among your troops and everyone will start shouting that your men are being slaughtered .
TLB	2%20Samuel	17	10	Then even the bravest of them , though they have hearts of lions , will be paralyzed with fear ; for all Israel knows what a mighty man your father is and how courageous his soldiers are .
TLB	2%20Samuel	17	11	“ What I suggest is that you mobilize the entire army of Israel , bringing them from as far away as Dan and Beersheba , so that you will have a huge force . And I think that you should personally lead the troops .
TLB	2%20Samuel	17	12	Then when we find him we can destroy his entire army so that not one of them is left alive .
TLB	2%20Samuel	17	13	And if David has escaped into some city , you will have the entire army of Israel there at your command , and we can take ropes and drag the walls of the city into the nearest valley until every stone is torn down. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	17	14	Then Absalom and all the men of Israel said , “ Hushai ’ s advice is better than Ahithophel ’ s. ” For the Lord had arranged to defeat the counsel of Ahithophel , which really was the better plan , so that he could bring disaster upon Absalom !
TLB	2%20Samuel	17	15	Then Hushai reported to Zadok and Abiathar , the priests , what Ahithophel had said and what he himself had suggested instead .
TLB	2%20Samuel	17	16	“ Quick ! ” he told them . “ Find David and urge him not to stay at the ford of the Jordan River tonight . He must go across at once into the wilderness beyond ; otherwise he will die , and his entire army with him. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	17	18	But a boy saw them leaving En-rogel to go to David , and he told Absalom about it . Meanwhile , they escaped to Bahurim where a man hid them inside a well in his backyard .
TLB	2%20Samuel	17	19	The man ’ s wife put a cloth over the top of the well with grain on it to dry in the sun ; so no one suspected they were there .
TLB	2%20Samuel	17	20	When Absalom ’ s men arrived and asked her if she had seen Ahimaaz and Jonathan , she said they had crossed the brook and were gone . They looked for them without success and returned to Jerusalem .
TLB	2%20Samuel	17	21	Then the two men crawled out of the well and hurried on to King David . “ Quick ! ” they told him , “ cross the Jordan tonight ! ” And they told him how Ahithophel had advised that he be captured and killed .
TLB	2%20Samuel	17	22	So David and all the people with him went across during the night and were all on the other bank before dawn .
TLB	2%20Samuel	17	23	Meanwhile , Ahithophel—publicly disgraced when Absalom refused his advice—saddled his donkey , went to his hometown , set his affairs in order , and hanged himself ; so he died and was buried beside his father .
TLB	2%20Samuel	17	24	David soon arrived at Mahanaim . Meanwhile , Absalom had mobilized the entire army of Israel and was leading the men across the Jordan River .
TLB	2%20Samuel	17	25	Absalom had appointed Amasa as general of the army , replacing Joab . ( Amasa was Joab ’ s second cousin ; his father was Ithra , an Ishmaelite , and his mother was Abigail , the daughter of Nahash , who was the sister of Joab ’ s mother , Zeruiah . )
TLB	2%20Samuel	17	26	Absalom and the Israeli army now camped in the land of Gilead .
TLB	2%20Samuel	17	27	When David arrived at Mahanaim , he was warmly greeted by Shobi ( son of Nahash of Rabbah , an Ammonite ) and Machir ( son of Ammiel of Lodebar ) and Barzillai ( a Gileadite of Rogelim ) . 28-29 They brought him and those who were with him mats to sleep on , cooking pots , serving bowls , wheat and barley flour , parched grain , beans , lentils , honey , butter , and cheese . For they said , “ You must be very tired and hungry and thirsty after your long march through the wilderness. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	2%20Samuel	18	2	Samuel 18:29 I didn ’ t know what was happening . Ahimaaz apparently was afraid to tell the king what actually had happened . The Living Bible copyright ©
TLB	2%20Samuel	18	18	( Absalom had built a monument to himself in the King ’ s Valley , for he said , “ I have no sons to carry on my name. ” He called it “ Absalom ’ s Monument , ” as it is still known today . )
TLB	2%20Samuel	18	3	“ You mustn ’ t do it , ” they said , “ for if we have to turn and run , and half of us die , it will make no difference to them—they will be looking only for you . You are worth ten thousand of us , and it is better that you stay here in the city and send us help if we need it. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	18	4	“ Well , whatever you think best , ” the king finally replied . So he stood at the gate of the city as all the troops passed by .
TLB	2%20Samuel	18	5	And the king commanded Joab , Abishai , and Ittai , “ For my sake , deal gently with young Absalom. ” And all the troops heard the king give them this charge .
TLB	2%20Samuel	18	6	So the battle began in the forest of Ephraim ,
TLB	2%20Samuel	18	7	and the Israeli troops were beaten back by David ’ s men . There was a great slaughter and twenty thousand men laid down their lives that day .
TLB	2%20Samuel	18	8	The battle raged all across the countryside , and more men disappeared in the forest than were killed .
TLB	2%20Samuel	18	9	During the battle Absalom came upon some of David ’ s men and as he fled [ a ] on his mule , it went beneath the thick boughs of a great oak tree , and his hair caught in the branches . His mule went on , leaving him dangling in the air .
TLB	2%20Samuel	18	10	One of David ’ s men saw him and told Joab .
TLB	2%20Samuel	18	11	“ What ? You saw him there and didn ’ t kill him ? ” Joab demanded . “ I would have rewarded you handsomely and made you a commissioned officer. ” [ b ]
TLB	2%20Samuel	18	12	“ For a million dollars I wouldn ’ t do it , ” the man replied . “ We all heard the king say to you and Abishai and Ittai , ‘ For my sake , please don ’ t harm young Absalom. ’
TLB	2%20Samuel	18	13	And if I had betrayed the king by killing his son ( and the king would certainly find out who did it ) , you yourself would be the first to accuse me. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	18	14	“ Enough of this nonsense , ” Joab said . Then he took three daggers and plunged them into the heart of Absalom as he dangled alive from the oak .
TLB	2%20Samuel	18	15	Ten of Joab ’ s young armor bearers then surrounded Absalom and finished him off .
TLB	2%20Samuel	18	16	Then Joab blew the trumpet , and his men returned from chasing the army of Israel .
TLB	2%20Samuel	18	17	They threw Absalom ’ s body into a deep pit in the forest and piled a great heap of stones over it . And the army of Israel fled to their homes .
TLB	2%20Samuel	18	19	Then Zadok ’ s son Ahimaaz said , “ Let me run to King David with the good news that the Lord has saved him from his enemy Absalom. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	18	20	“ No , ” Joab told him , “ it wouldn ’ t be good news to the king that his son is dead . You can be my messenger some other time. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	18	21	Then Joab said to a man from Cush , “ Go tell the king what you have seen. ” The man bowed and ran off .
TLB	2%20Samuel	18	22	But Ahimaaz pleaded with Joab , “ Please let me go too. ” “ No , we don ’ t need you now , my boy , ” Joab replied . “ There is no further news to send. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	18	23	“ Yes , but let me go anyway , ” he begged . And Joab finally said , “ All right , go ahead. ” Then Ahimaaz took a shortcut across the plain and got there ahead of the man from Cush .
TLB	2%20Samuel	18	24	David was sitting at the gate of the city . When the watchman climbed the stairs to his post at the top of the wall , he saw a lone man running toward them .
TLB	2%20Samuel	18	25	He shouted the news down to David , and the king replied , “ If he is alone , he has news. ” As the messenger came closer ,
TLB	2%20Samuel	18	26	the watchman saw another man running toward them . He shouted down , “ Here comes another one. ” And the king replied , “ He will have more news. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	18	27	“ The first man looks like Ahimaaz , the son of Zadok , ” the watchman said . “ He is a good man and comes with good news , ” the king replied .
TLB	2%20Samuel	18	28	Then Ahimaaz cried out to the king , “ All is well ! ” He bowed low with his face to the ground and said , “ Blessed be the Lord your God who has destroyed the rebels who dared to stand against you. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	18	29	“ What of young Absalom ? ” the king demanded . “ Is he all right ? ” “ When Joab told me to come , there was a lot of shouting ; but I didn ’ t know what was happening , ” [ c ] Ahimaaz answered .
TLB	2%20Samuel	18	30	“ Wait here , ” the king told him . So Ahimaaz stepped aside .
TLB	2%20Samuel	18	31	Then the man from Cush arrived and said , “ I have good news for my lord the king . Today Jehovah has rescued you from all those who rebelled against you. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	18	32	“ What about young Absalom ? Is he all right ? ” the king demanded . And the man replied , “ May all of your enemies be as that young man is ! ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	18	33	Then the king broke into tears , and went up to his room over the gate , crying as he went . “ O my son Absalom , my son , my son Absalom . If only I could have died for you ! O Absalom , my son , my son. ” Footnotes -

TLB	2%20Samuel	19	19	and pleaded , “ My lord the king , please forgive me and forget the terrible thing I did when you left Jerusalem ;
TLB	2%20Samuel	19	3	The entire army crept back into the city as though they were ashamed and had been beaten in battle .
TLB	2%20Samuel	19	4	The king covered his face with his hands and kept on weeping , “ O my son Absalom ! O Absalom my son , my son ! ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	19	5	Then Joab went to the king ’ s room and said to him , “ We saved your life today and the lives of your sons , your daughters , your wives , and concubines ; and yet you act like this , making us feel ashamed , as though we had done something wrong .
TLB	2%20Samuel	19	6	You seem to love those who hate you , and hate those who love you . Apparently we don ’ t mean anything to you ; if Absalom had lived and all of us had died , you would be happy .
TLB	2%20Samuel	19	7	Now go out there and congratulate the troops , for I swear by Jehovah that if you don ’ t , not a single one of them will remain here during the night ; then you will be worse off than you have ever been in your entire life. ” 8-10 So the king went out and sat at the city gates , and as the news spread throughout the city that he was there , everyone went to him . Meanwhile , there was much discussion and argument going on all across the nation : “ Why aren ’ t we talking about bringing the king back ? ” was the great topic everywhere . “ For he saved us from our enemies , the Philistines ; and Absalom , whom we made our king instead , chased him out of the country , but now Absalom is dead . Let ’ s ask David to return and be our king again. ” 11-12 Then David sent Zadok and Abiathar the priests to say to the elders of Judah , “ Why are you the last ones to reinstate the king ? For all Israel is ready , and only you are holding out . Yet you are my own brothers , my own tribe , my own flesh and blood ! ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	19	13	And he told them to tell Amasa , “ Since you are my nephew , may God strike me dead if I do not appoint you as commander-in-chief of my army in place of Joab. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	19	14	Then Amasa convinced all the leaders of Judah , and they responded as one man . They sent word to the king , “ Return to us and bring back all those who are with you. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	19	15	So the king started back to Jerusalem . And when he arrived at the Jordan River , it seemed as if everyone in Judah had come to Gilgal to meet him and escort him across the river !
TLB	2%20Samuel	19	16	Then Shimei ( the son of Gera the Benjaminite ) , the man from Bahurim , hurried across with the men of Judah to welcome King David .
TLB	2%20Samuel	19	17	A thousand men from the tribe of Benjamin were with him , including Ziba , the servant of Saul , and Ziba ’ s fifteen sons and twenty servants ; they rushed down to the Jordan to arrive ahead of the king .
TLB	2%20Samuel	19	18	They all worked hard ferrying the king ’ s household and troops across , and helped them in every way they could . As the king was crossing , Shimei fell down before him ,
TLB	2%20Samuel	19	20	for I know very well how much I sinned . That is why I have come here today , the very first person in all the tribe of Joseph to greet you. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	19	21	Abishai asked , “ Shall not Shimei die , for he cursed the Lord ’ s chosen king ! ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	19	22	“ Don ’ t talk to me like that ! ” David exclaimed . “ This is not a day for execution but for celebration ! I am once more king of Israel ! ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	19	23	Then , turning to Shimei , he vowed , “ Your life is spared. ” 24-25 Now Mephibosheth , Saul ’ s grandson , arrived from Jerusalem to meet the king . He had not washed his feet or clothes nor trimmed his beard since the day the king left Jerusalem . “ Why didn ’ t you come with me , Mephibosheth ? ” the king asked him .
TLB	2%20Samuel	19	26	And he replied , “ My lord , O king , my servant Ziba deceived me . I told him , ‘ Saddle my donkey so that I can go with the king. ’ For as you know I am lame .
TLB	2%20Samuel	19	27	But Ziba has slandered me by saying that I refused to come . [ a ] But I know that you are as an angel of God , so do what you think best .
TLB	2%20Samuel	19	28	I and all my relatives could expect only death from you , but instead you have honored me among all those who eat at your own table ! So how can I complain ? ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	19	29	“ All right , ” David replied . “ My decision is that you and Ziba will divide the land equally between you. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	19	30	“ Give him all of it , ” Mephibosheth said . “ I am content just to have you back again ! ” 31-32 Barzillai , who had fed the king and his army during their exile in Mahanaim , arrived from Rogelim to conduct the king across the river . He was very old now , about eighty , and very wealthy .
TLB	2%20Samuel	19	33	“ Come across with me and live in Jerusalem , ” the king said to Barzillai . “ I will take care of you there. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	19	34	“ No , ” he replied , “ I am far too old for that .
TLB	2%20Samuel	19	35	I am eighty years old today , and life has lost its excitement . [ b ] Food and wine are no longer tasty , and entertainment is not much fun ; I would only be a burden to my lord the king .
TLB	2%20Samuel	19	36	Just to go across the river with you is all the honor I need !
TLB	2%20Samuel	19	37	Then let me return again to die in my own city , where my father and mother are buried . But here is Chimham . [ c ] Let him go with you and receive whatever good things you want to give him. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	19	38	“ Good , ” the king agreed . “ Chimham shall go with me , and I will do for him whatever I would have done for you. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	19	39	So all the people crossed the Jordan with the king ; and after David had kissed and blessed Barzillai , he returned home .
TLB	2%20Samuel	19	40	The king then went on to Gilgal , taking Chimham with him . And most of Judah and half of Israel were there to greet him .
TLB	2%20Samuel	19	41	But the men of Israel complained to the king because only men from Judah had ferried him and his household across the Jordan .
TLB	2%20Samuel	19	42	“ Why not ? ” the men of Judah replied . “ The king is one of our own tribe . Why should this make you angry ? We have charged him nothing—he hasn ’ t fed us or given us gifts ! ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	19	43	“ But there are ten tribes in Israel , ” the others replied , “ so we have ten times as much right in the king as you do ; why didn ’ t you invite the rest of us ? And , remember , we were the first to speak of bringing him back to be our king again. ” The argument continued back and forth , and the men of Judah were very rough in their replies . Footnotes -

TLB	2%20Samuel	20	20	And Joab replied , “ That isn ’ t it at all .
TLB	2%20Samuel	20	3	When he arrived at his palace in Jerusalem , the king instructed that his ten wives he had left to keep house should be placed in seclusion . Their needs were to be cared for , he said , but he would no longer sleep with them as his wives . So they remained in virtual widowhood until their deaths .
TLB	2%20Samuel	20	4	Then the king instructed Amasa to mobilize the army of Judah within three days and to report back at that time .
TLB	2%20Samuel	20	5	So Amasa went out to notify the troops , but it took him longer than the three days he had been given .
TLB	2%20Samuel	20	6	Then David said to Abishai , “ That fellow Sheba is going to hurt us more than Absalom did . Quick , take my bodyguard and chase after him before he gets into a fortified city where we can ’ t reach him. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	20	7	So Abishai and Joab set out after Sheba with an elite guard from Joab ’ s army and the king ’ s own bodyguard . 8-10 As they arrived at the great stone in Gibeon , they came face-to-face with Amasa . Joab was wearing his uniform with a dagger strapped to his side . As he stepped forward to greet Amasa , he stealthily slipped the dagger from its sheath . “ I ’ m glad to see you , my brother , ” Joab said , and took him by the beard with his right hand as though to kiss him . Amasa didn ’ t notice the dagger in his left hand , and Joab stabbed him in the stomach with it , so that his bowels gushed out onto the ground . He did not need to strike again , and he died there . Joab and his brother , Abishai , left him lying there and continued after Sheba .
TLB	2%20Samuel	20	11	One of Joab ’ s young officers shouted to Amasa ’ s troops , “ If you are for David , come and follow Joab. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	20	12	But Amasa lay in his blood in the middle of the road , and when Joab ’ s young officers saw that a crowd was gathering around to stare at him , they dragged him off the road into a field and threw a garment over him .
TLB	2%20Samuel	20	13	With the body out of the way , everyone went on with Joab to capture Sheba .
TLB	2%20Samuel	20	14	Meanwhile Sheba had traveled across Israel to mobilize his own clan of Bichri at the city of Abel in Beth-maacah .
TLB	2%20Samuel	20	15	When Joab ’ s forces arrived , they besieged Abel and built a mound to the top of the city wall and began battering it down .
TLB	2%20Samuel	20	16	But a wise woman in the city called out to Joab , “ Listen to me , Joab . Come over here so I can talk to you. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	20	17	As he approached , the woman asked , “ Are you Joab ? ” And he replied , “ I am. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	20	18	So she told him , “ There used to be a saying , ‘ If you want to settle an argument , ask advice at Abel. ’ For we always give wise counsel .
TLB	2%20Samuel	20	19	You are destroying an ancient , peace-loving city , loyal to Israel . Should you destroy what is the Lord ’ s ? ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	20	21	All I want is a man named Sheba from the hill country of Ephraim , who has revolted against King David . If you will deliver him to me , we will leave the city in peace. ” “ All right , ” the woman replied , “ we will throw his head over the wall to you. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	20	22	Then the woman went to the people with her wise advice , and they cut off Sheba ’ s head and threw it out to Joab . And he blew the trumpet and called his troops back from the attack , and they returned to the king at Jerusalem .
TLB	2%20Samuel	20	23	Joab was commander-in-chief of the army , and Benaiah was in charge of the king ’ s bodyguard . [ a ]
TLB	2%20Samuel	20	24	Adoram was in charge of the forced labor battalions , and Jehoshaphat was the historian who kept the records .
TLB	2%20Samuel	20	25	Sheva was the secretary , and Zadok and Abiathar were the chief priests .

TLB	2%20Samuel	21	2	Samuel 21:19 the brother of Goliath the Gittite , literally , “ slew Goliath of Gath. ” See
TLB	2%20Samuel	21	21	There was a famine during David ’ s reign that lasted year after year for three years , and David spent much time in prayer about it . Then the Lord said , “ The famine is because of the guilt of Saul and his family , for they murdered the Gibeonites. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	21	3	David asked them , “ What can I do for you to rid ourselves of this guilt and to induce you to ask God to bless us ? ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	21	4	“ Well , money won ’ t do it , ” the Gibeonites replied , “ and we don ’ t want to see Israelites executed in revenge. ” “ What can I do , then ? ” David asked . “ Just tell me and I will do it for you. ” 5-6 “ Well , then , ” they replied , “ give us seven of Saul ’ s sons—the sons of the man who did his best to destroy us . We will hang them before the Lord in Gibeon , the city of King Saul. ” “ All right , ” the king said , “ I will do it. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	21	7	He spared Jonathan ’ s son Mephibosheth , who was Saul ’ s grandson , because of the oath between himself and Jonathan .
TLB	2%20Samuel	21	8	But he gave them Saul ’ s two sons Armoni and Mephibosheth , whose mother was Rizpah , the daughter of Aiah . He also gave them the five adopted sons of Michal that she brought up for Saul ’ s daughter Merab , the wife of Adriel .
TLB	2%20Samuel	21	9	The men of Gibeon impaled them in the mountain before the Lord . So all seven of them died together at the beginning of the barley harvest .
TLB	2%20Samuel	21	10	Then Rizpah , the mother of two of the men , [ a ] spread sackcloth upon a rock and stayed there through the entire harvest season to prevent the vultures from tearing at their bodies during the day and the wild animals from eating them at night .
TLB	2%20Samuel	21	11	When David learned what she had done , 12-14 he arranged for the men ’ s bones to be buried in the grave of Saul ’ s father , Kish . At the same time he sent a request to the men of Jabesh-gilead , asking them to bring him the bones of Saul and Jonathan . They had stolen their bodies from the public square at Beth-shan where the Philistines had impaled them after they had died in battle on Mount Gilboa . So their bones were brought to him . Then at last God answered prayer and ended the famine .
TLB	2%20Samuel	21	15	Once when the Philistines were at war with Israel , and David and his men were in the thick of the battle , David became weak and exhausted .
TLB	2%20Samuel	21	16	Ishbi-benob , a giant whose speartip weighed more than twelve pounds and who was sporting a new suit of armor , closed in on David and was about to kill him .
TLB	2%20Samuel	21	17	But Abishai , the son of Zeruiah , came to his rescue and killed the Philistine . After that David ’ s men declared , “ You are not going out to battle again ! Why should we risk snuffing out the light of Israel ? ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	21	18	Later , during a war with the Philistines at Gob , Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Saph , another giant .
TLB	2%20Samuel	21	19	At still another time and at the same place , Elhanan killed the brother of Goliath the Gittite , [ b ] whose spear handle was as huge as a weaver ’ s beam ! 20-21 And once when the Philistines and the Israelis were fighting at Gath , a giant with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot defied Israel , and David ’ s nephew Jonathan—the son of David ’ s brother Shimei—killed him .
TLB	2%20Samuel	21	22	These four were from the tribe of giants in Gath and were killed by David ’ s troops . Footnotes -

TLB	2%20Samuel	22	6	I was trapped and bound By hell and death ;
TLB	2%20Samuel	22	7	But I called upon the Lord in my distress , And he heard me from his Temple . My cry reached his ears .

TLB	2%20Samuel	22	11	He rode upon the glorious— On the wings of the wind .
TLB	2%20Samuel	22	12	Darkness surrounded him , And clouds were thick around him ;
TLB	2%20Samuel	22	13	The earth was radiant with his brightness .
TLB	2%20Samuel	22	14	The Lord thundered from heaven ; The God above all gods gave out a mighty shout .
TLB	2%20Samuel	22	15	He shot forth his arrows of lightning And routed his enemies .
TLB	2%20Samuel	22	16	By the blast of his breath Was the sea split in two . The bottom of the sea appeared .
TLB	2%20Samuel	22	17	From above , he rescued me . He drew me out from the waters ;
TLB	2%20Samuel	22	18	He saved me from powerful enemies , From those who hated me And from those who were too strong for me .
TLB	2%20Samuel	22	19	They came upon me In the day of my calamity , But the Lord was my salvation .
TLB	2%20Samuel	22	20	He set me free and rescued me , For I was his delight .

TLB	2%20Samuel	22	23	I knew his laws , And I obeyed them .
TLB	2%20Samuel	22	24	I was perfect in obedience And kept myself from sin .
TLB	2%20Samuel	22	25	That is why the Lord has done so much for me , For he sees that I am clean .
TLB	2%20Samuel	22	26	You are merciful to the merciful ; You show your perfections To the blameless .
TLB	2%20Samuel	22	27	To those who are pure , You show yourself pure ; But you destroy those who are evil .
TLB	2%20Samuel	22	28	You will save those in trouble , But you bring down the haughty ; For you watch their every move .
TLB	2%20Samuel	22	29	O Lord , you are my light ! You make my darkness bright .
TLB	2%20Samuel	22	30	By your power I can crush an army ; By your strength I leap over a wall .
TLB	2%20Samuel	22	31	As for God , his way is perfect ; The word of the Lord is true . He shields all who hide behind him .

TLB	2%20Samuel	23	23	He was one of the greatest of the Thirty , but was not actually one of the Top Three . And David made him chief of his bodyguard . 24-39 Asahel , the brother of Joab , was also one of the Thirty . Others were : Elhanan ( son of Dodo ) from Bethlehem ; Shammah from Harod ; Elika from Harod ; Helez from Palti ; Ira ( son of Ikkesh ) from Tekoa ; Abiezer from Anathoth ; Mebunnai from Hushath ; Zalmon from Ahoh ; Maharai from Netophah ; Heleb ( son of Baanah ) from Netophah ; Ittai ( son of Ribai ) from Gibeah , of the tribe of Benjamin ; Benaiah of Pirathon ; Hiddai from the brooks of Gaash ; Abi-albon from Arbath ; Azmaveth from Bahurim ; Eliahba from Shaalbon ; The sons of Jashen ; Jonathan ; Shammah from Harar ; Ahiam ( the son of Sharar ) from Harar ; Eliphelet ( son of Ahasbai ) from Maacah ; Eliam ( the son of Ahithophel ) from Gilo ; Hezro from Carmel ; Paarai from Arba ; Igal ( son of Nathan ) from Zobah ; Bani from Gad ; Zelek from Ammon ; Naharai from Beeroth , the armor bearer of Joab ( son of Zeruiah ) ; Ira from Ithra ; Gareb from Ithra ; Uriah the Hittite—thirty-seven in all .

TLB	2%20Samuel	23	3	The Rock of Israel said to me : ‘ One shall come who rules righteously , Who rules in the fear of God .
TLB	2%20Samuel	23	4	He shall be as the light of the morning ; A cloudless sunrise When the tender grass Springs forth upon the earth ; As sunshine after rain. ’
TLB	2%20Samuel	23	5	And it is my family He has chosen ! Yes , God has made An everlasting covenant with me ; His agreement is eternal , final , sealed . He will constantly look after My safety and success . [ a ]
TLB	2%20Samuel	23	6	But the godless are as thorns to be thrown away , For they tear the hand that touches them .
TLB	2%20Samuel	23	7	One must be armed to chop them down ; They shall be burned. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	23	8	These are the names of the Top Three—the most heroic men in David ’ s army : the first was Josheb-basshebeth from Tahchemon , known also as Adino , the Eznite . He once killed eight hundred men in one battle .
TLB	2%20Samuel	23	9	Next in rank was Eleazar , the son of Dodo and grandson of Ahohi . He was one of the three men who , with David , held back the Philistines that time when the rest of the Israeli army fled .
TLB	2%20Samuel	23	10	He killed the Philistines until his hand was too tired to hold his sword ; and the Lord gave him a great victory . ( The rest of the army did not return until it was time to collect the loot ! ) 11-12 After him was Shammah , the son of Agee from Harar . Once during a Philistine attack , when all his men deserted him and fled , he stood alone at the center of a field of lentils and beat back the Philistines ; and God gave him a great victory .
TLB	2%20Samuel	23	13	One time when David was living in the cave of Adullam and the invading Philistines were at the valley of Rephaim , three of the Thirty—the top-ranking officers of the Israeli army—went down at harvest time to visit him .
TLB	2%20Samuel	23	14	David was in the stronghold at the time , for Philistine marauders had occupied the nearby city of Bethlehem .
TLB	2%20Samuel	23	15	David remarked , “ How thirsty I am for some of that good water in the city well ! ” ( The well was near the city gate . )
TLB	2%20Samuel	23	16	So the three men broke through the Philistine ranks and drew water from the well and brought it to David . But he refused to drink it ! Instead , he poured it out before the Lord .
TLB	2%20Samuel	23	17	“ No , my God , ” he exclaimed , “ I can not do it ! This is the blood of these men who have risked their lives. ” 18-19 Of those three men , Abishai , the brother of Joab ( son of Zeruiah ) , was the greatest . Once he took on three hundred of the enemy single-handed and killed them all . It was by such feats that he earned a reputation equal to the Three , though he was not actually one of them . But he was the greatest of the Thirty—the top-ranking officers of the army—and was their leader .
TLB	2%20Samuel	23	20	There was also Benaiah ( son of Jehoiada ) , a heroic soldier from Kabzeel . Benaiah killed two giants , [ b ] sons of Ariel of Moab . Another time he went down into a pit and , despite the slippery snow on the ground , took on a lion that was caught there and killed it .
TLB	2%20Samuel	23	21	Another time , armed only with a staff , he killed an Egyptian warrior who was armed with a spear ; he wrenched the spear from the Egyptian ’ s hand and killed him with it .
TLB	2%20Samuel	23	22	These were some of the deeds that gave Benaiah almost as much renown as the Top Three .

TLB	2%20Samuel	24	24	But the king said to Araunah , “ No , I will not have it as a gift . I will buy it , for I don ’ t want to offer to the Lord my God burnt offerings that have cost me nothing. ” So David paid him [ b ] for the threshing floor and the oxen .
TLB	2%20Samuel	24	3	But Joab replied , “ God grant that you will live to see the day when there will be a hundred times as many people in your kingdom as there are now ! But you have no right to rejoice in their strength. ” [ a ]
TLB	2%20Samuel	24	4	But the king ’ s command overcame Joab ’ s remonstrance ; so Joab and the other army officers went out to count the people of Israel .
TLB	2%20Samuel	24	5	First they crossed the Jordan and camped at Aroer , south of the city that lies in the middle of the valley of Gad , near Jazer ;
TLB	2%20Samuel	24	6	then they went to Gilead in the land of Tahtim-hodshi and to Dan-jaan and around to Sidon ;
TLB	2%20Samuel	24	7	and then to the stronghold of Tyre , and all the cities of the Hivites and Canaanites , and south to Judah as far as Beersheba .
TLB	2%20Samuel	24	8	Having gone through the entire land , they completed their task in nine months and twenty days .
TLB	2%20Samuel	24	9	And Joab reported the number of the people to the king—800,000 men of conscription age in Israel and 500,000 in Judah .
TLB	2%20Samuel	24	10	But after he had taken the census , David ’ s conscience began to bother him , and he said to the Lord , “ What I did was very wrong . Please forgive this foolish wickedness of mine. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	24	11	The next morning the word of the Lord came to the prophet Gad , who was David ’ s contact with God . The Lord said to Gad ,
TLB	2%20Samuel	24	12	“ Tell David that I will give him three choices. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	24	13	So Gad came to David and asked him , “ Will you choose seven years of famine across the land , or to flee for three months before your enemies , or to submit to three days of plague ? Think this over and let me know what answer to give to God. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	24	14	“ This is a hard decision , ” David replied , “ but it is better to fall into the hand of the Lord ( for his mercy is great ) than into the hands of men. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	24	15	So the Lord sent a plague upon Israel that morning , and it lasted for three days ; and seventy thousand men died throughout the nation .
TLB	2%20Samuel	24	16	But as the death angel was preparing to destroy Jerusalem , the Lord was sorry for what was happening and told him to stop . He was by the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite at the time .
TLB	2%20Samuel	24	17	When David saw the angel , he said to the Lord , “ Look , I am the one who has sinned ! What have these sheep done ? Let your anger be only against me and my family. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	24	18	That day Gad came to David and said to him , “ Go and build an altar to the Lord on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	24	19	So David went to do what the Lord had commanded him .
TLB	2%20Samuel	24	20	When Araunah saw the king and his men coming toward him , he came forward and fell flat on the ground with his face in the dust .
TLB	2%20Samuel	24	21	“ Why have you come ? ” Araunah asked . And David replied , “ To buy your threshing floor , so that I can build an altar to the Lord , and he will stop the plague. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	24	22	“ Use anything you like , ” Araunah told the king . “ Here are oxen for the burnt offering , and you can use the threshing instruments and ox yokes for wood to build a fire on the altar .
TLB	2%20Samuel	24	23	I will give it all to you , and may the Lord God accept your sacrifice. ”
TLB	2%20Samuel	24	25	And David built an altar there to the Lord and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings . And the Lord answered his prayer , and the plague was stopped . Footnotes -

TLB	1%20Kings	1	1	Kings 1:31 bowed low before him , literally , “ did reverence to the king. ” The Living Bible copyright ©
TLB	1%20Kings	1	2	“ The cure for this , ” his aides told him , “ is to find a young virgin to be your concubine and nurse . She will lie in your arms and keep you warm. ” 3-4 So they searched the country from one end to the other to find the most beautiful girl in all the land . Abishag , from Shunam , was finally selected . They brought her to the king , and she lay in his arms to warm him ( but he had no sexual relations with her ) .
TLB	1%20Kings	1	5	At about that time , David ’ s son [ a ] Adonijah ( his mother was Haggith ) decided to crown himself king in place of his aged father . So he hired chariots and drivers and recruited fifty men to run down the streets before him as royal footmen .
TLB	1%20Kings	1	6	Now his father , King David , had never disciplined him at any time—not so much as by a single scolding ! He was a very handsome man and was Absalom ’ s younger brother .
TLB	1%20Kings	1	7	He took General Joab and Abiathar the priest into his confidence , and they agreed to help him become king .
TLB	1%20Kings	1	8	But among those who remained loyal to King David and refused to endorse Adonijah were the priests Zadok and Benaiah , the prophet Nathan , Shimei , Rei , and David ’ s army chiefs .
TLB	1%20Kings	1	9	Adonijah went to En-rogel where he sacrificed sheep , oxen , and fat young goats at the Serpent ’ s Stone . Then he summoned all of his brothers—the other sons of King David—and all the royal officials of Judah , requesting that they come to his coronation .
TLB	1%20Kings	1	10	But he didn ’ t invite Nathan the prophet , Benaiah , the loyal army officers , or his brother Solomon .
TLB	1%20Kings	1	11	Then Nathan the prophet went to Bathsheba , Solomon ’ s mother , and asked her , “ Do you realize that Haggith ’ s son , Adonijah , is now the king and that our lord David doesn ’ t even know about it ?
TLB	1%20Kings	1	12	If you want to save your own life and the life of your son Solomon—do exactly as I say !
TLB	1%20Kings	1	13	Go at once to King David and ask him , ‘ My lord , didn ’ t you promise me that my son Solomon would be the next king and would sit upon your throne ? Then why is Adonijah reigning ? ’
TLB	1%20Kings	1	14	And while you are still talking with him , I ’ ll come and confirm everything you ’ ve said. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	1	15	So Bathsheba went into the king ’ s bedroom . He was an old , old man now , and Abishag was caring for him .
TLB	1%20Kings	1	16	Bathsheba bowed low before him . “ What do you want ? ” he asked her .
TLB	1%20Kings	1	17	She replied , “ My lord , you vowed to me by the Lord your God that my son Solomon would be the next king and would sit upon your throne .
TLB	1%20Kings	1	18	But instead , Adonijah is the new king , and you don ’ t even know about it .
TLB	1%20Kings	1	19	He has celebrated his coronation by sacrificing oxen , fat goats , and many sheep and has invited all your sons and Abiathar the priest and General Joab . But he didn ’ t invite Solomon .
TLB	1%20Kings	1	20	And now , my lord the king , all Israel is waiting for your decision as to whether Adonijah is the one you have chosen to succeed you .
TLB	1%20Kings	1	21	If you don ’ t act , my son Solomon and I will be arrested and executed as criminals as soon as you are dead. ” 22-23 While she was speaking , the king ’ s aides told him , “ Nathan the prophet is here to see you. ” Nathan came in and bowed low before the king ,
TLB	1%20Kings	1	24	and asked , “ My lord , have you appointed Adonijah to be the next king ? Is he the one you have selected to sit upon your throne ?
TLB	1%20Kings	1	25	Today he celebrated his coronation by sacrificing oxen , fat goats , and many sheep , and has invited your sons to attend the festivities . He also invited General Joab and Abiathar the priest ; and they are feasting and drinking with him and shouting , ‘ Long live King Adonijah ! ’
TLB	1%20Kings	1	26	But Zadok the priest and Benaiah and Solomon and I weren ’ t invited .
TLB	1%20Kings	1	27	Has this been done with your knowledge ? For you haven ’ t said a word as to which of your sons you have chosen to be the next king. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	1	28	“ Call Bathsheba , ” David said . So she came back in and stood before the king .
TLB	1%20Kings	1	29	And the king vowed , “ As the Lord lives who has rescued me from every danger ,
TLB	1%20Kings	1	30	I decree that your son Solomon shall be the next king and shall sit upon my throne , just as I swore to you before by the Lord God of Israel. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	1	31	Then Bathsheba bowed low before him [ b ] again and exclaimed , “ Oh , thank you , sir . May my lord the king live forever ! ”
TLB	1%20Kings	1	32	“ Call Zadok the priest , ” the king ordered , “ and Nathan the prophet , and Benaiah. ” When they arrived ,
TLB	1%20Kings	1	33	he said to them , “ Take Solomon and my officers to Gihon . Solomon is to ride on my personal mule ,
TLB	1%20Kings	1	34	and Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet are to anoint him there as king of Israel . Then blow the trumpets and shout , ‘ Long live King Solomon ! ’
TLB	1%20Kings	1	35	When you bring him back here , place him upon my throne as the new king ; for I have appointed him king of Israel and Judah. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	1	36	“ Amen ! Praise God ! ” replied Benaiah , and added ,
TLB	1%20Kings	1	37	“ May the Lord be with Solomon as he has been with you , and may God make Solomon ’ s reign even greater than yours ! ”
TLB	1%20Kings	1	38	So Zadok the priest , Nathan the prophet , Benaiah , and David ’ s bodyguard took Solomon to Gihon , riding on King David ’ s own mule .
TLB	1%20Kings	1	39	At Gihon , Zadok took a flask of sacred oil from the Tabernacle and poured it over Solomon ; and the trumpets were blown and all the people shouted , “ Long live King Solomon ! ”
TLB	1%20Kings	1	40	Then they all returned with him to Jerusalem , making a joyous and noisy celebration all along the way .
TLB	1%20Kings	1	41	Adonijah and his guests heard the commotion and shouting just as they were finishing their banquet . “ What ’ s going on ? ” Joab demanded . “ Why is the city in such an uproar ? ”
TLB	1%20Kings	1	42	And while he was still speaking , Jonathan , the son of Abiathar the priest , rushed in . “ Come in , ” Adonijah said to him , “ for you are a good man ; you must have good news. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	1	43	“ Our lord King David has declared Solomon as king ! ” Jonathan shouted . 44-45 “ The king sent him to Gihon with Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet and Benaiah , protected by the king ’ s own bodyguard ; and he rode on the king ’ s own mule . And Zadok and Nathan have anointed him as the new king ! They have just returned , and the whole city is celebrating and rejoicing . That ’ s what all the noise is . 46-47 Solomon is sitting on the throne , and all the people are congratulating King David , saying , ‘ May God bless you even more through Solomon than he has blessed you personally ! May God make Solomon ’ s reign even greater than yours ! ’ And the king is lying in bed , acknowledging their blessings .
TLB	1%20Kings	1	48	He is saying , ‘ Blessed be the Lord God of Israel who has selected one of my sons to sit upon my throne while I am still alive to see it. ’ ” 49-50 Then Adonijah and his guests jumped up from the banquet table and fled in panic ; for they were fearful for their lives . Adonijah rushed into the Tabernacle and caught hold of the horns of the sacred altar .
TLB	1%20Kings	1	51	When word reached Solomon that Adonijah was claiming sanctuary in the Tabernacle , and pleading for clemency ,
TLB	1%20Kings	1	52	Solomon replied , “ If he behaves himself , he will not be harmed ; but if he does not , he shall die. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	1	53	So King Solomon summoned him , and they brought him down from the altar . He came to bow low before the king ; and then Solomon curtly dismissed him . “ Go on home , ” he said . Footnotes -

TLB	1%20Kings	2	1	Samuel 2:31-35 . The Living Bible copyright ©
TLB	1%20Kings	2	2	“ I am going where every man on earth must some day go . I am counting on you to be a strong and worthy successor .
TLB	1%20Kings	2	3	Obey the laws of God and follow all his ways ; keep each of his commands written in the law of Moses so that you will prosper in everything you do , wherever you turn .
TLB	1%20Kings	2	4	If you do this , then the Lord will fulfill the promise he gave me , that if my children and their descendants watch their step and are faithful to God , one of them shall always be the king of Israel—my dynasty will never end .
TLB	1%20Kings	2	5	“ Now listen to my instructions . You know that Joab murdered my two generals , Abner and Amasa . He pretended that it was an act of war , but it was done in a time of peace .
TLB	1%20Kings	2	6	You are a wise man and will know what to do—don ’ t let him die in peace .
TLB	1%20Kings	2	7	But be kind to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite . Make them permanent guests of the king , for they took care of me when I fled from your brother Absalom .
TLB	1%20Kings	2	8	And do you remember Shimei , the son of Gera the Benjaminite from Bahurim ? He cursed me with a terrible curse as I was going to Mahanaim ; but when he came down to meet me at the Jordan River , I promised I wouldn ’ t kill him .
TLB	1%20Kings	2	9	But that promise doesn ’ t bind you ! You are a wise man , and you will know how to arrange a bloody death for him. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	2	10	Then David died and was buried in Jerusalem .
TLB	1%20Kings	2	11	He had reigned over Israel for forty years , seven of them in Hebron and thirty-three in Jerusalem .
TLB	1%20Kings	2	12	And Solomon became the new king , replacing his father David ; and his kingdom prospered .
TLB	1%20Kings	2	13	One day Adonijah , the son of Haggith , came to see Solomon ’ s mother , Bathsheba . “ Have you come to make trouble ? ” she asked him . “ No , ” he replied , “ I come in peace .
TLB	1%20Kings	2	14	As a matter of fact , I have a favor to ask of you. ” “ What is it ? ” she asked .
TLB	1%20Kings	2	15	“ Everything was going well for me , ” he said , “ and the kingdom was mine : everyone expected me to be the next king . But the tables are turned , and everything went to my brother instead ; for that is the way the Lord wanted it .
TLB	1%20Kings	2	16	But now I have just a small favor to ask of you ; please don ’ t turn me down. ” “ What is it ? ” she asked .
TLB	1%20Kings	2	17	He replied , “ Speak to King Solomon on my behalf ( for I know he will do anything you request ) and ask him to give me Abishag , the Shunammite , as my wife. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	2	18	“ All right , ” Bathsheba replied , “ I ’ ll ask him. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	2	19	So she went to ask the favor of King Solomon . The king stood up from his throne as she entered and bowed low to her . He ordered that a throne for his mother be placed beside his ; so she sat at his right hand .
TLB	1%20Kings	2	20	“ I have one small request to make of you , ” she said . “ I hope you won ’ t turn me down. ” “ What is it , my mother ? ” he asked . “ You know I won ’ t refuse you. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	2	21	“ Then let your brother Adonijah marry Abishag , ” she replied .
TLB	1%20Kings	2	22	“ Are you crazy ? ” he demanded . “ If I were to give him Abishag , I would be giving him the kingdom too ! For he is my older brother ! He and Abiathar the priest and General Joab would take over ! ” 23-24 Then King Solomon swore with a great oath , “ May God strike me dead if Adonijah does not die this very day for this plot against me ! I swear it by the living God who has given me the throne of my father David and this kingdom he promised me. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	2	25	So King Solomon sent Benaiah to execute him , and he killed him with a sword .
TLB	1%20Kings	2	26	Then the king said to Abiathar the priest , “ Go back to your home in Anathoth . You should be killed , too , but I won ’ t do it now . For you carried the Ark of the Lord during my father ’ s reign , and you suffered right along with him in all of his troubles. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	2	27	So Solomon forced Abiathar to give up his position as the priest of the Lord , thereby fulfilling the decree of Jehovah at Shiloh concerning the descendants of Eli . [ a ]
TLB	1%20Kings	2	28	When Joab heard about Adonijah ’ s death ( Joab had joined Adonijah ’ s revolt , though not Absalom ’ s ) he ran to the Tabernacle for sanctuary and caught hold of the horns of the altar .
TLB	1%20Kings	2	29	When news of this reached King Solomon , he sent Benaiah to execute him .
TLB	1%20Kings	2	30	Benaiah went into the Tabernacle and said to Joab , “ The king says to come out ! ” “ No , ” he said , “ I ’ ll die here. ” So Benaiah returned to the king for further instructions .
TLB	1%20Kings	2	31	“ Do as he says , ” the king replied . “ Kill him there beside the altar and bury him . This will remove the guilt of his senseless murders from me and from my father ’ s family .
TLB	1%20Kings	2	32	Then Jehovah will hold him personally responsible for the murders of two men who were better than he . For my father was no party to the deaths of General Abner , commander-in-chief of the army of Israel , and General Amasa , commander-in-chief of the army of Judah .
TLB	1%20Kings	2	33	May Joab and his descendants be forever guilty of these murders , and may the Lord declare David and his descendants guiltless concerning their deaths. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	2	34	So Benaiah returned to the Tabernacle and killed Joab ; and he was buried beside his house in the desert .
TLB	1%20Kings	2	35	Then the king appointed Benaiah as commander-in-chief , and Zadok as priest instead of Abiathar . 36-37 The king now sent for Shimei and told him , “ Build a house here in Jerusalem , and don ’ t step outside the city on pain of death . The moment you go beyond Kidron Brook , you die ; and it will be your own fault. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	2	38	“ All right , ” Shimei replied , “ whatever you say. ” So he lived in Jerusalem for a long time .
TLB	1%20Kings	2	39	But three years later two of Shimei ’ s slaves escaped to King Achish of Gath . When Shimei learned where they were ,
TLB	1%20Kings	2	40	he saddled a donkey and went to Gath to visit the king . And when he had found his slaves , he took them back to Jerusalem .
TLB	1%20Kings	2	41	When Solomon heard that Shimei had left Jerusalem and had gone to Gath and returned ,
TLB	1%20Kings	2	42	he sent for him and demanded , “ Didn ’ t I command you in the name of God to stay in Jerusalem or die ? You replied , ‘ Very well , I will do as you say. ’
TLB	1%20Kings	2	43	Then why have you not kept your agreement and obeyed my commandment ?
TLB	1%20Kings	2	44	And what about all the wicked things you did to my father , King David ? May the Lord take revenge on you ,
TLB	1%20Kings	2	45	but may I receive God ’ s rich blessings , and may one of David ’ s descendants always sit upon this throne. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	2	46	Then , at the king ’ s command , Benaiah took Shimei outside and killed him . So Solomon ’ s grip upon the kingdom became secure . Footnotes -

TLB	1%20Kings	3	1	Kings
TLB	1%20Kings	3	3	( Solomon loved the Lord and followed all of his father David ’ s instructions except that he continued to sacrifice in the hills and to offer incense there . )
TLB	1%20Kings	3	2	At that time the people of Israel sacrificed their offerings on altars in the hills , for the Temple of the Lord hadn ’ t yet been built .
TLB	1%20Kings	3	4	The most famous of the hilltop altars was at Gibeon , and now the king went there and sacrificed one thousand burnt offerings !
TLB	1%20Kings	3	5	The Lord appeared to him in a dream that night and told him to ask for anything he wanted , and it would be given to him !
TLB	1%20Kings	3	6	Solomon replied , “ You were wonderfully kind to my father David because he was honest and true and faithful to you , and obeyed your commands . And you have continued your kindness to him by giving him a son to succeed him .
TLB	1%20Kings	3	7	O Lord my God , now you have made me the king instead of my father David , but I am as a little child who doesn ’ t know his way around .
TLB	1%20Kings	3	8	And here I am among your own chosen people , a nation so great that there are almost too many people to count !
TLB	1%20Kings	3	9	Give me an understanding mind so that I can govern your people well and know the difference between what is right and what is wrong . For who by himself is able to carry such a heavy responsibility ? ”
TLB	1%20Kings	3	10	The Lord was pleased with his reply and was glad that Solomon had asked for wisdom .
TLB	1%20Kings	3	11	So he replied , “ Because you have asked for wisdom in governing my people and haven ’ t asked for a long life , or riches for yourself , or the defeat of your enemies—
TLB	1%20Kings	3	12	yes , I ’ ll give you what you asked for ! I will give you a wiser mind than anyone else has ever had or ever will have !
TLB	1%20Kings	3	13	And I will also give you what you didn ’ t ask for—riches and honor ! And no one in all the world will be as rich and famous as you for the rest of your life !
TLB	1%20Kings	3	14	And I will give you a long life if you follow me and obey my laws as your father David did. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	3	15	Then Solomon woke up and realized it had been a dream . He returned to Jerusalem and went into the Tabernacle . And as he stood before the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord , he sacrificed burnt offerings and peace offerings . Then he invited all of his officials to a great banquet .
TLB	1%20Kings	3	16	Soon afterwards two young prostitutes came to the king to have an argument settled . 17-18 “ Sir , ” one of them began , “ we live in the same house , just the two of us , and recently I had a baby . When it was three days old , this woman ’ s baby was born too .
TLB	1%20Kings	3	19	But her baby died during the night when she rolled over on it in her sleep and smothered it .
TLB	1%20Kings	3	20	Then she got up in the night and took my son from beside me while I was asleep , and laid her dead child in my arms and took mine to sleep beside her .
TLB	1%20Kings	3	21	And in the morning when I tried to feed my baby it was dead ! But when it became light outside , I saw that it wasn ’ t my son at all. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	3	22	Then the other woman interrupted , “ It certainly was her son , and the living child is mine. ” “ No , ” the first woman said , “ the dead one is yours and the living one is mine. ” And so they argued back and forth before the king .
TLB	1%20Kings	3	23	Then the king said , “ Let ’ s get the facts straight : both of you claim the living child , and each says that the dead child belongs to the other .
TLB	1%20Kings	3	24	All right , bring me a sword. ” So a sword was brought to the king .
TLB	1%20Kings	3	25	Then he said , “ Divide the living child in two and give half to each of these women ! ”
TLB	1%20Kings	3	26	Then the woman who really was the mother of the child , and who loved him very much , cried out , “ Oh no , sir ! Give her the child—don ’ t kill him ! ” But the other woman said , “ All right , it will be neither yours nor mine ; divide it between us ! ”
TLB	1%20Kings	3	27	Then the king said , “ Give the baby to the woman who wants him to live , for she is the mother ! ”
TLB	1%20Kings	3	28	Word of the king ’ s decision spread quickly throughout the entire nation , and all the people were awed as they realized the great wisdom God had given him . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	1%20Kings	4	7	There were also twelve officials of Solomon ’ s court—one man from each tribe—responsible for requisitioning food from the people for the king ’ s household . Each of them arranged provisions for one month of the year . 8-19 The names of these twelve officers were : Ben-hur , whose area for this taxation was the hill country of Ephraim ; Ben-deker , whose area was Makaz , Shaalbim , Beth-shemesh , and Elon-beth-hanan ; Ben-hesed , whose area was Arubboth , including Socoh and all the land of Hepher ; Ben-abinadab ( who married Solomon ’ s daughter , the princess Taphath ) , whose area was the highlands of Dor ; Baana ( son of Ahilud ) , whose area was Taanach and Megiddo , all of Beth-shean near Zarethan below Jezreel , and all the territory from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah and over to Jokmeam ; Ben-geber , whose area was Ramoth-gilead , including the villages of Jair ( the son of Manasseh ) in Gilead ; and the region of Argob in Bashan , including sixty walled cities with bronze gates ; Ahinadab ( the son of Iddo ) , whose area was Mahanaim ; Ahimaaz ( who married Princess Basemath , another of Solomon ’ s daughters ) , whose area was Naphtali ; Baana ( son of Hushai ) , whose areas were Asher and Bealoth ; Jehoshaphat ( son of Paruah ) , whose area was Issachar ; Shimei ( son of Ela ) , whose area was Benjamin ; Geber ( son of Uri ) , whose area was Gilead , including the territories of King Sihon of the Amorites and King Og of Bashan . A general manager supervised these officials and their work .

TLB	1%20Kings	4	21	King Solomon ruled the whole area from the Euphrates River to the land of the Philistines and down to the borders of Egypt . The conquered peoples of those lands sent taxes to Solomon and continued to serve him throughout his lifetime .
TLB	1%20Kings	4	22	The daily food requirements for the palace were
TLB	1%20Kings	4	195	bushels of fine flour ,
TLB	1%20Kings	4	390	bushels of meal ,

TLB	1%20Kings	4	10	oxen from the fattening pens ,

TLB	1%20Kings	4	24	His dominion extended over all the kingdoms west of the Euphrates River , from Tiphsah to Gaza . And there was peace throughout the land .
TLB	1%20Kings	4	25	Throughout the lifetime of Solomon , all of Judah and Israel lived in peace and safety ; and each family had its own home and garden .
TLB	1%20Kings	4	26	Solomon owned forty thousand chariot horses and employed twelve thousand charioteers .
TLB	1%20Kings	4	27	Each month the tax officials provided food for King Solomon and his court ,
TLB	1%20Kings	4	28	also the barley and straw for the royal horses in the stables .
TLB	1%20Kings	4	29	God gave Solomon great wisdom and understanding , and a mind with broad interests .
TLB	1%20Kings	4	30	In fact , his wisdom excelled that of any of the wise men of the East , including those in Egypt .
TLB	1%20Kings	4	31	He was wiser than Ethan the Ezrahite and Heman , Calcol , and Darda , the sons of Mahol ; and he was famous among all the surrounding nations .
TLB	1%20Kings	4	32	He was the author of 3,000 proverbs and wrote 1,005 songs .
TLB	1%20Kings	4	33	He was a great naturalist , with interest in animals , birds , snakes , fish , and trees—from the great cedars of Lebanon down to the tiny hyssop which grows in cracks in the wall .

TLB	1%20Kings	5	5	So I am planning to build a Temple for the Lord my God , just as he instructed my father that I should do . For the Lord told him , ‘ Your son , whom I will place upon your throne , shall build me a Temple. ’
TLB	1%20Kings	5	4	“ But now , ” Solomon said to Hiram , “ the Lord my God has given Israel peace on every side ; I have no foreign enemies or internal rebellions .

TLB	1%20Kings	5	7	Hiram was very pleased with the message from Solomon . “ Praise God for giving David a wise son to be king of the great nation of Israel , ” he said .
TLB	1%20Kings	5	8	Then he sent this reply to Solomon : “ I have received your message and I will do as you have asked concerning the timber . I can supply both cedar and cypress .
TLB	1%20Kings	5	9	My men will bring the logs from the Lebanon mountains to the Mediterranean Sea and build them into rafts . We will float them along the coast to wherever you need them ; then we will break the rafts apart and deliver the timber to you . You can pay me with food for my household. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	5	10	So Hiram produced for Solomon as much cedar and cypress timber as he desired ,
TLB	1%20Kings	5	11	and in return Solomon sent him an annual payment of 125,000 bushels of wheat for his household and
TLB	1%20Kings	5	96	gallons of pure olive oil .
TLB	1%20Kings	5	12	So the Lord gave great wisdom to Solomon just as he had promised . And Hiram and Solomon made a formal alliance of peace .
TLB	1%20Kings	5	13	Then Solomon drafted thirty thousand laborers from all over Israel ,
TLB	1%20Kings	5	14	and rotated them to Lebanon , ten thousand a month , so that each man was a month in Lebanon and two months at home . Adoniram was the general superintendent of this labor camp .
TLB	1%20Kings	5	15	Solomon also had seventy thousand additional laborers , eighty thousand stonecutters in the hill country ,
TLB	1%20Kings	5	16	and thirty-three hundred foremen .
TLB	1%20Kings	5	17	The stonecutters quarried and shaped huge blocks of stone—a very expensive job—for the foundation of the Temple .
TLB	1%20Kings	5	18	Men from Gebal helped Solomon ’ s and Hiram ’ s builders in cutting the timber and making the boards , and in preparing the stone for the Temple . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	1%20Kings	6	1	Kings 6:23 placed two statues of Guardian Angels , literally , “ made two cherubim. ” The Living Bible copyright ©
TLB	1%20Kings	6	6	These rooms were three stories high , the lower floor being 7-1/2 feet wide , the second floor
TLB	1%20Kings	6	480	years after the people of Israel left their slavery in Egypt . )
TLB	1%20Kings	6	2	The Temple was ninety feet long , thirty feet wide , and forty-five feet high .
TLB	1%20Kings	6	3	All along the front of the Temple was a porch thirty feet long and fifteen feet deep .
TLB	1%20Kings	6	4	Narrow windows were used throughout .
TLB	1%20Kings	6	5	An annex of rooms was built along the full length of both sides of the Temple against the outer walls .
TLB	1%20Kings	6	9	After completing the Temple , Solomon paneled it all , including the beams and pillars , with cedar .
TLB	1%20Kings	6	7	The stones used in the construction of the Temple were prefinished at the quarry , so the entire structure was built without the sound of hammer , ax , or any other tool at the building site .
TLB	1%20Kings	6	8	The bottom floor of the side rooms was entered from the right side of the Temple , and there were winding stairs going up to the second floor ; another flight of stairs led from the second to the third .
TLB	1%20Kings	6	10	As already stated , there was an annex on each side of the building , attached to the Temple walls by cedar timbers . Each story of the annex was 7-1/2 feet high . 11-12 Then the Lord sent this message to Solomon concerning the Temple he was building : “ If you do as I tell you to and follow all of my commandments and instructions , I will do what I told your father David I would do :
TLB	1%20Kings	6	13	I will live among the people of Israel and never forsake them. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	6	14	At last the Temple was finished .
TLB	1%20Kings	6	15	The entire inside , from floor to ceiling , was paneled with cedar , and the floors were made of cypress boards .
TLB	1%20Kings	6	16	The thirty-foot inner room at the far end of the Temple—the Most Holy Place—was also paneled from the floor to the ceiling with cedar boards .
TLB	1%20Kings	6	17	The remainder of the Temple—other than the Most Holy Place—was sixty feet long .
TLB	1%20Kings	6	18	Throughout the Temple the cedar paneling laid over the stone walls was carved with designs of rosebuds and open flowers .
TLB	1%20Kings	6	19	The inner room was where the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord was placed .
TLB	1%20Kings	6	20	This inner sanctuary was thirty feet long , thirty feet wide , and thirty feet high . Its walls and ceiling were overlaid with pure gold , and Solomon made a cedar-wood altar for this room . 21-22 Then he overlaid the interior of the remainder of the Temple—including the cedar altar—with pure gold ; and he made gold chains to protect the entrance to the Most Holy Place . 23-28 Within the inner sanctuary Solomon placed two statues of Guardian Angels [ a ] made from olive wood , each fifteen feet high . They were placed so that their outspread wings reached from wall to wall , while their inner wings touched each other at the center of the room ; each wing was 7-1/2 feet long , so each Angel measured fifteen feet from wing tip to wing tip . The two Angels were identical in all dimensions , and each was overlaid with gold .
TLB	1%20Kings	6	29	Figures of Guardian Angels , palm trees , and open flowers were carved on all the walls of both rooms of the Temple ,
TLB	1%20Kings	6	30	and the floor of both rooms was overlaid with gold .
TLB	1%20Kings	6	31	The doorway to the inner sanctuary was a five-sided opening ,
TLB	1%20Kings	6	32	and its two olive-wood doors were carved with Guardian Angels , palm trees , and open flowers , all overlaid with gold .
TLB	1%20Kings	6	33	Then he made square doorposts of olive wood for the entrance to the Temple .
TLB	1%20Kings	6	34	There were two folding doors of cypress wood , and each door was hinged to fold back upon itself .
TLB	1%20Kings	6	35	Angels , palm trees , and open flowers were carved on these doors and carefully overlaid with gold .
TLB	1%20Kings	6	36	The wall of the inner court had three layers of hewn stone and one layer of cedar beams .
TLB	1%20Kings	6	37	The foundation of the Temple was laid in the month of May in the fourth year of Solomon ’ s reign ,
TLB	1%20Kings	6	38	and the entire building was completed in every detail in November of the eleventh year of his reign . So it took seven years to build . Footnotes -

TLB	1%20Kings	7	1	Kings 7:27 square , implied in v.
TLB	1%20Kings	7	7	There was also the Throne Room or Judgment Hall , where Solomon sat to hear legal matters ; it was paneled with cedar from the floor to the rafters .
TLB	1%20Kings	7	2	One of the rooms in the palace was called the Hall of the Forest of Lebanon . It was huge—measuring
TLB	1%20Kings	7	150	feet long ,
TLB	1%20Kings	7	75	feet wide , and
TLB	1%20Kings	7	45	feet in circumference .
TLB	1%20Kings	7	5	Each of the doorways and windows had a square frame .
TLB	1%20Kings	7	6	feet square and 4-1/2 feet high . They were constructed with undercarriages braced with square [ d ] crosspieces . These crosspieces were decorated with carved lions , oxen , and Guardian Angels . Above and below the lions and oxen were wreath decorations . Each of these movable stands had four bronze wheels and bronze axles , and at each corner of the stands were supporting posts made of bronze and decorated with wreaths on each side .
TLB	1%20Kings	7	8	His cedar-paneled living quarters surrounded a courtyard behind this hall . ( He designed similar living quarters , the same size , in the palace that he built for Pharaoh ’ s daughter—one of his wives . )
TLB	1%20Kings	7	9	These buildings were constructed entirely from huge , expensive stones , cut to measure .
TLB	1%20Kings	7	10	The foundation stones were twelve to fifteen feet across .
TLB	1%20Kings	7	11	The huge stones in the walls were also cut to measure and were topped with cedar beams .
TLB	1%20Kings	7	12	The Great Court had three courses of hewn stone in its walls , topped with cedar beams , just like the inner court of the Temple and the porch of the palace .
TLB	1%20Kings	7	13	King Solomon then asked for a man named Hiram to come from Tyre , for he was a skilled craftsman in bronze work .
TLB	1%20Kings	7	14	He was half Jewish , being the son of a widow of the tribe of Naphtali , and his father had been a foundry worker from Tyre . So he came to work for King Solomon .
TLB	1%20Kings	7	15	feet from brim to brim ;
TLB	1%20Kings	7	23	Then Hiram cast a round bronze tank , 7-1/2 feet high and
TLB	1%20Kings	7	24	On the underside of the rim were two rows of ornaments an inch or two apart , [ b ] which were cast along with the tank .
TLB	1%20Kings	7	25	It rested on twelve bronze [ c ] oxen standing tail to tail , three facing north , three west , three south , and three east .
TLB	1%20Kings	7	26	The sides of the tank were four inches thick ; its brim was shaped like a goblet , and it had a twelve thousand gallon capacity . 27-30 Then he made ten four-wheeled movable stands , each
TLB	1%20Kings	7	31	. The Living Bible copyright ©
TLB	1%20Kings	7	32	The stands rode on four wheels which were connected to axles that had been cast as part of the stands . The wheels were twenty-seven inches high
TLB	1%20Kings	7	33	and were similar to chariot wheels . All the parts of the stands were cast from molten bronze , including the axles , spokes , rims , and hubs .
TLB	1%20Kings	7	34	There were supports at each of the four corners of the stands , and these , too , were cast with the stands .
TLB	1%20Kings	7	35	A nine-inch rim surrounded the tip of each stand , banded with lugs . All was cast as one unit with the stand .
TLB	1%20Kings	7	36	Guardian Angels , lions , and palm trees surrounded by wreaths were engraved on the borders of the band wherever there was room .
TLB	1%20Kings	7	37	All ten stands were the same size and were made alike , for each was cast from the same mold .
TLB	1%20Kings	7	38	Then he made ten brass vats , and placed them on the stands . Each vat was six feet square and contained
TLB	1%20Kings	7	240	gallons of water .
TLB	1%20Kings	7	39	Five of these vats were arranged on the left and five on the right-hand side of the room . The tank was in the southeast corner , on the right-hand side of the room .
TLB	1%20Kings	7	40	Hiram also made the necessary pots , shovels , and basins and at last completed the work in the Temple of the Lord that had been assigned to him by King Solomon . 41-46 Here is a list of the items he made : Two pillars ; A capital at the top of each pillar ; Latticework covering the bases of the capitals of each pillar ; Four hundred pomegranates in two rows on the latticework , to cover the bases of the two capitals ; Ten movable stands holding ten vats ; One large tank and twelve oxen supporting it ; Pots ; Shovels ; Basins . All these items were made of burnished bronze and were cast at the plains of the Jordan River between Succoth and Zarethan .
TLB	1%20Kings	7	47	The total weight of these pieces was not known because they were too heavy to weigh !
TLB	1%20Kings	7	48	All the utensils and furniture used in the Temple were made of solid gold . This included the altar , the table where the Bread of the Presence of God was displayed ,
TLB	1%20Kings	7	49	the lampstands ( five on the right-hand side and five on the left , in front of the Most Holy Place ) , the flowers , lamps , tongs ,
TLB	1%20Kings	7	50	cups , snuffers , basins , spoons , firepans , the hinges of the doors to the Most Holy Place , and the main entrance doors of the Temple . Each of these was made of solid gold .
TLB	1%20Kings	7	51	When the Temple was finally finished , Solomon took into the treasury of the Temple the silver , the gold , and all the vessels dedicated for that purpose by his father David . Footnotes -

TLB	1%20Kings	8	8	The poles were so long that they stuck out past the Angels and could be seen from the next room , but not from the outer court ; and they remain there to this day .
TLB	1%20Kings	8	2	This celebration occurred at the time of the Tabernacle Festival in the month of October . 3-4 During the festivities the priests carried the Ark to the Temple , along with all the sacred vessels that had previously been in the Tabernacle .
TLB	1%20Kings	8	5	King Solomon and all the people gathered before the Ark , sacrificing uncounted sheep and oxen .
TLB	1%20Kings	8	6	Then the priests took the Ark into the inner sanctuary of the Temple—the Most Holy Place—and placed it under the wings of the statues of the Guardian Angels .
TLB	1%20Kings	8	7	The Angels had been constructed in such a manner that their wings spread out over the spot where the Ark would be placed ; so now their wings overshadowed the Ark and its carrying poles .
TLB	1%20Kings	8	9	There was nothing in the Ark at that time except the two stone tablets that Moses had placed there at Mount Horeb at the time the Lord made his covenant with the people of Israel after they left Egypt .
TLB	1%20Kings	8	10	Look ! As the priests are returning from the inner sanctuary , a bright cloud fills the Temple !
TLB	1%20Kings	8	11	The priests have to go outside because the glory of the Lord is filling the entire building ! 12-13 Now King Solomon prayed this invocation : “ The Lord has said that he would live in the thick darkness ; But , O Lord , I have built you a lovely home on earth , a place for you to live forever. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	8	14	Then the king turned around and faced the people as they stood before him , and blessed them .
TLB	1%20Kings	8	15	“ Blessed be the Lord God of Israel , ” he said , “ who has done today what he promised my father David :
TLB	1%20Kings	8	16	for he said to him , ‘ When I brought my people from Egypt , I didn ’ t appoint a place for my Temple , but I appointed a man to be my people ’ s leader. ’
TLB	1%20Kings	8	17	This man was my father David . He wanted to build a Temple for the Lord God of Israel ,
TLB	1%20Kings	8	18	but the Lord told him not to . ‘ I am glad you want to do it , ’ he said ,
TLB	1%20Kings	8	19	‘ but your son is the one who shall build my Temple. ’
TLB	1%20Kings	8	20	And now the Lord has done what he promised ; for I have followed my father as king of Israel , and now this Temple has been built for the Lord God of Israel .
TLB	1%20Kings	8	21	And I have prepared a place in the Temple for the Ark that contains the covenant made by the Lord with our fathers , at the time that he brought them out of the land of Egypt. ” 22-23 Then , as all the people watched , Solomon stood before the altar of the Lord with his hands spread out toward heaven and said , “ O Lord God of Israel , there is no god like you in heaven or earth , for you are loving and kind and you keep your promises to your people if they do their best to do your will .
TLB	1%20Kings	8	24	Today you have fulfilled your promise to my father David , who was your servant ;
TLB	1%20Kings	8	25	and now , O Lord God of Israel , fulfill your further promise to him : that if his descendants follow your ways and try to do your will as he did , one of them shall always sit upon the throne of Israel .
TLB	1%20Kings	8	26	Yes , O God of Israel , fulfill this promise too .
TLB	1%20Kings	8	27	“ But is it possible that God would really live on earth ? Why , even the skies and the highest heavens can not contain you , much less this Temple I have built !
TLB	1%20Kings	8	28	And yet , O Lord my God , you have heard and answered my request :
TLB	1%20Kings	8	29	Please watch over this Temple night and day—this place you have promised to live in—and as I face toward the Temple and pray , whether by night or by day , please listen to me and answer my requests .
TLB	1%20Kings	8	30	Listen to every plea of the people of Israel whenever they face this place to pray ; yes , hear in heaven where you live , and when you hear , forgive .
TLB	1%20Kings	8	31	“ If a man is accused of doing something wrong and then , standing here before your altar , swears that he didn ’ t do it ,
TLB	1%20Kings	8	32	hear him in heaven and do what is right ; judge whether or not he did it . 33-34 “ And when your people sin and their enemies defeat them , hear them from heaven and forgive them if they turn to you again and confess that you are their God . Bring them back again to this land which you have given to their fathers . 35-36 “ And when the skies are shut up and there is no rain because of their sin , hear them from heaven and forgive them when they pray toward this place and confess your name . And after you have punished them , help them to follow the good ways in which they should walk , and send rain upon the land that you have given your people .
TLB	1%20Kings	8	37	“ If there is a famine in the land caused by plant disease or locusts or caterpillars , or if Israel ’ s enemies besiege one of her cities , or if the people are struck by an epidemic or plague—or whatever the problem is—
TLB	1%20Kings	8	38	then when the people realize their sin and pray toward this Temple ,
TLB	1%20Kings	8	39	hear them from heaven and forgive and answer all who have made an honest confession ; for you know each heart .
TLB	1%20Kings	8	40	In this way they will always learn to reverence you as they continue to live in this land that you have given their fathers . 41-42 “ And when foreigners hear of your great name and come from distant lands to worship you ( for they shall hear of your great name and mighty miracles ) and pray toward this Temple ,
TLB	1%20Kings	8	43	hear them from heaven and answer their prayers . And all the nations of the earth will know and fear your name just as your own people Israel do ; and all the earth will know that this is your Temple .
TLB	1%20Kings	8	44	“ When you send your people out to battle against their enemies and they pray to you , looking toward your chosen city of Jerusalem and toward this Temple that I have built in your name ,
TLB	1%20Kings	8	45	hear their prayer and help them .
TLB	1%20Kings	8	46	“ If they sin against you ( and who doesn ’ t ? ) and you become angry with them and let their enemies lead them away as captives to some foreign land , whether far or near ,
TLB	1%20Kings	8	47	and they come to their senses and turn to you and cry to you saying , ‘ We have sinned , we have done wrong ’ ;
TLB	1%20Kings	8	48	if they honestly return to you and pray toward this land that you have given their fathers , and toward this city of Jerusalem that you have chosen , and toward this Temple that I have built for your name ,
TLB	1%20Kings	8	49	hear their prayers and pleadings from heaven where you live , and come to their assistance .
TLB	1%20Kings	8	50	“ Forgive your people for all of their evil deeds , and make their captors merciful to them ;
TLB	1%20Kings	8	51	for they are your people—your inheritance that you brought out from the Egyptian furnace .
TLB	1%20Kings	8	52	May your eyes be open and your ears listening to their pleas . O Lord , hear and answer them whenever they cry out to you ,
TLB	1%20Kings	8	53	for when you brought our fathers out of the land of Egypt , you told your servant Moses that you had chosen Israel from among all the nations of the earth to be your own special people. ” 54-55 Solomon had been kneeling with his hands outstretched toward heaven . As he finished this prayer , he rose from before the altar of Jehovah and cried out this blessing upon all the people of Israel :
TLB	1%20Kings	8	56	“ Blessed be the Lord who has fulfilled his promise and given rest to his people Israel ; not one word has failed of all the wonderful promises proclaimed by his servant Moses .
TLB	1%20Kings	8	57	May the Lord our God be with us as he was with our fathers ; may he never forsake us .
TLB	1%20Kings	8	58	May he give us the desire to do his will in everything , and to obey all the commandments and instructions he has given our ancestors .
TLB	1%20Kings	8	59	And may these words of my prayer be constantly before him day and night , so that he helps me and all of Israel in accordance with our daily needs .
TLB	1%20Kings	8	60	May people all over the earth know that the Lord is God and that there is no other god at all .
TLB	1%20Kings	8	61	O my people , may you live good and perfect lives before the Lord our God ; may you always obey his laws and commandments , just as you are doing today. ” 62-63 Then the king and all the people dedicated the Temple by sacrificing peace offerings to the Lord—a total of 22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep and goats !
TLB	1%20Kings	8	64	As a temporary measure the king sanctified the court in front of the Temple for the burnt offerings , grain offerings , and the fat of the peace offerings : for the bronze altar was too small to handle so much .
TLB	1%20Kings	8	65	The celebration lasted for fourteen days , and a great crowd came from one end of the land to the other .
TLB	1%20Kings	8	66	Afterwards Solomon sent the people home , happy for all the goodness that the Lord had shown to his servant David and to his people Israel . And they blessed the king . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	1%20Kings	9	9	And the answer will be , ‘ The people of Israel abandoned the Lord their God who brought them out of the land of Egypt ; they worshiped other gods instead . That is why the Lord has brought this evil upon them. ’ ”
TLB	1%20Kings	9	4	And if you live in honesty and truth as your father David did , always obeying me ,
TLB	1%20Kings	9	5	then I will cause your descendants to be the kings of Israel forever , just as I promised your father David when I told him , ‘ One of your sons shall always be upon the throne of Israel. ’
TLB	1%20Kings	9	6	“ However , if you or your children turn away from me and worship other gods and do not obey my laws ,
TLB	1%20Kings	9	7	then I will take away the people of Israel from this land that I have given them . I will take them from this Temple which I have hallowed for my name , and I will cast them out of my sight ; and Israel will become a joke to the nations and an example and proverb of sudden disaster .
TLB	1%20Kings	9	8	This Temple will become a heap of ruins , and everyone passing by will be amazed and will whistle with astonishment , asking , ‘ Why has the Lord done such things to this land and this Temple ? ’
TLB	1%20Kings	9	10	At the end of the twenty years during which Solomon built the Temple and the palace , 11-12 he gave twenty cities in the land of Galilee to King Hiram of Tyre as payment for all the cedar and cypress lumber and gold he had furnished for the construction of the palace and Temple . Hiram came from Tyre to see the cities , but he wasn ’ t at all pleased with them .
TLB	1%20Kings	9	13	“ What sort of deal is this , my brother ? ” he asked . “ These cities are a wasteland ! ” ( And they are still known as “ The Wasteland ” today . )
TLB	1%20Kings	9	14	For Hiram had sent gold to Solomon valued at $ 3,500,000 !
TLB	1%20Kings	9	15	Solomon had conscripted forced labor to build the Temple , his palace , Fort Millo , the wall of Jerusalem , and the cities of Hazor , Megiddo , and Gezer .
TLB	1%20Kings	9	16	Gezer was the city the king of Egypt conquered and burned , killing the Israeli population ; later he had given the city to his daughter as a dowry—she was one of Solomon ’ s wives . 17-18 So now Solomon rebuilt Gezer along with Lower Beth-horon , Baalath , and Tamar , a desert city .
TLB	1%20Kings	9	19	He also built cities for grain storage , cities in which to keep his chariots , cities for homes for his cavalry and chariot drivers , and resort cities near Jerusalem and in the Lebanon mountains and elsewhere throughout the land . 20-21 Solomon conscripted his labor forces from those who survived in the nations he conquered—the Amorites , Hittites , Perizzites , Hivites , and Jebusites . For the people of Israel had not been able to wipe them out completely at the time of the invasion and conquest of Israel , and they continue as slaves even today .
TLB	1%20Kings	9	22	Solomon didn ’ t conscript any Israelis for this work , although they became soldiers , officials , army officers , chariot commanders , and cavalrymen .
TLB	1%20Kings	9	23	And there were
TLB	1%20Kings	9	550	men of Israel who were overseers of the labor forces . Miscellaneous Notes :
TLB	1%20Kings	9	24	King Solomon moved Pharaoh ’ s daughter from the City of David—the old sector of Jerusalem—to the new quarters he had built for her in the palace . Then he built Fort Millo .
TLB	1%20Kings	9	25	After the Temple was completed , Solomon offered burnt offerings and peace offerings three times a year on the altar he had built . And he also burned incense upon it .
TLB	1%20Kings	9	26	King Solomon had a shipyard in Ezion-geber near Eloth on the Red Sea in the land of Edom , where he built a fleet of ships . 27-28 King Hiram supplied experienced sailors to accompany Solomon ’ s crews . They used to sail back and forth from Ophir , bringing gold to King Solomon , the total value of which was several million dollars each trip . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	1%20Kings	10	10	Then she gave the king a gift of $ 3,500,000 in gold , along with a huge quantity of spices and precious gems ; in fact , it was the largest single gift of spices King Solomon had ever received .
TLB	1%20Kings	10	2	She arrived in Jerusalem with a long train of camels carrying spices , gold , and jewels ; and she told him all her problems .
TLB	1%20Kings	10	3	Solomon answered all her questions ; nothing was too difficult for him , for the Lord gave him the right answers every time . [ b ]
TLB	1%20Kings	10	4	She soon realized that everything she had ever heard about his great wisdom was true . She also saw the beautiful palace he had built ,
TLB	1%20Kings	10	5	and when she saw the wonderful foods on his table , the great number of servants and aides who stood around in splendid uniforms , his cupbearers , and the many offerings he sacrificed by fire to the Lord—well , there was no more spirit in her !
TLB	1%20Kings	10	6	She exclaimed to him , “ Everything I heard in my own country about your wisdom and about the wonderful things going on here is all true .
TLB	1%20Kings	10	7	I didn ’ t believe it until I came , but now I have seen it for myself ! And really ! The half had not been told me ! Your wisdom and prosperity are far greater than anything I ’ ve ever heard of !
TLB	1%20Kings	10	8	Your people are happy and your palace aides are content—but how could it be otherwise , for they stand here day after day listening to your wisdom !
TLB	1%20Kings	10	9	Blessed be the Lord your God who chose you and set you on the throne of Israel . How the Lord must love Israel—for he gave you to them as their king ! And you give your people a just , good government ! ”
TLB	1%20Kings	10	11	( And when King Hiram ’ s ships brought gold to Solomon from Ophir , they also brought along a great supply of algum trees and gems .
TLB	1%20Kings	10	12	Solomon used the algum wood to make pillars for the Temple and the palace , and for harps and harpsichords for his choirs . Never before or since has there been such a supply of beautiful wood . )
TLB	1%20Kings	10	13	In exchange for the gifts from the queen of Sheba , King Solomon gave her everything she asked him for , besides the presents he had already planned . Then she and her servants returned to their own land .
TLB	1%20Kings	10	14	Each year Solomon received gold worth a quarter of a billion dollars ,
TLB	1%20Kings	10	15	besides sales taxes and profits from trade with the kings of Arabia and the other surrounding territories . 16-17 Solomon had some of the gold beaten into two hundred pieces of armor ( gold worth $ 6,000 went into each piece ) and three hundred shields ( $ 1,800 worth of gold in each ) . And he kept them in his palace in the Hall of the Forest of Lebanon .
TLB	1%20Kings	10	18	He also made a huge ivory throne and overlaid it with pure gold .
TLB	1%20Kings	10	19	It had six steps and a rounded back , with arm rests ; and a lion standing on each side .
TLB	1%20Kings	10	20	And there were two lions on each step—twelve in all . There was no other throne in all the world so splendid as that one .
TLB	1%20Kings	10	21	All of King Solomon ’ s cups were of solid gold , and in the Hall of the Forest of Lebanon his entire dining service was made of solid gold . ( Silver wasn ’ t used because it wasn ’ t considered to be of much value ! )
TLB	1%20Kings	10	22	King Solomon ’ s merchant fleet was in partnership with King Hiram ’ s , and once every three years a great load of gold , silver , ivory , apes , and peacocks arrived at the Israeli ports .
TLB	1%20Kings	10	23	So King Solomon was richer and wiser than all the kings of the earth .
TLB	1%20Kings	10	24	Great men from many lands came to interview him and listen to his God-given wisdom .
TLB	1%20Kings	10	25	They brought him annual tribute of silver and gold dishes , beautiful cloth , myrrh , spices , horses , and mules .
TLB	1%20Kings	10	26	Solomon built up a great stable of horses with a vast number of chariots and cavalry—1,400 chariots in all and 12,000 cavalrymen , who lived in the chariot cities and with the king at Jerusalem .
TLB	1%20Kings	10	27	Silver was as common as stones in Jerusalem in those days , and cedar was of no greater value than the common sycamore !
TLB	1%20Kings	10	28	Solomon ’ s horses were brought to him from Egypt and southern Turkey , where his agents purchased them at wholesale prices .
TLB	1%20Kings	10	29	An Egyptian chariot delivered to Jerusalem cost $
TLB	1%20Kings	10	400	, and the horses were valued at $
TLB	1%20Kings	10	150	each . Many of these were then resold to the Hittite and Syrian kings . Footnotes -

TLB	1%20Kings	11	1	Kings 11:32 I will leave him one tribe . Of the twelve tribes , Judah and Benjamin were left to Solomon ’ s son . These two tribes were often called “ Judah , ” the larger of the two . The Living Bible copyright ©
TLB	1%20Kings	11	11	so now the Lord said to him , “ Since you have not kept our agreement and have not obeyed my laws , I will tear the kingdom away from you and your family and give it to someone else . 12-13 However , for the sake of your father David , I won ’ t do this while you are still alive . I will take the kingdom away from your son . And even so I will let him be king of one tribe , for David ’ s sake and for the sake of Jerusalem , my chosen city. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	11	2	even though the Lord had clearly instructed his people not to marry into those nations , because the women they married would get them started worshiping their gods . Yet Solomon did it anyway .
TLB	1%20Kings	11	3	He had seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines ; and sure enough , they turned his heart away from the Lord ,
TLB	1%20Kings	11	4	especially in his old age . They encouraged him to worship their gods instead of trusting completely in the Lord as his father David had done .
TLB	1%20Kings	11	5	Solomon worshiped Ashtoreth , the goddess of the Sidonians , and Milcom , the horrible god of the Ammonites .
TLB	1%20Kings	11	6	Thus Solomon did what was clearly wrong and refused to follow the Lord as his father David did .
TLB	1%20Kings	11	7	He even built a temple on the Mount of Olives , across the valley from Jerusalem , for Chemosh , the depraved god of Moab , and another for Molech , the unutterably vile god of the Ammonites .
TLB	1%20Kings	11	8	Solomon built temples for these foreign wives to use for burning incense and sacrificing to their gods . 9-10 Jehovah was very angry with Solomon about this , for now Solomon was no longer interested in the Lord God of Israel who had appeared to him twice to warn him specifically against worshiping other gods . But he hadn ’ t listened ,
TLB	1%20Kings	11	14	So the Lord caused Hadad the Edomite to grow in power . And Solomon became apprehensive , for Hadad was a member of the royal family of Edom .
TLB	1%20Kings	11	15	Years before , when David had been in Edom with Joab to arrange for the burial of some Israeli soldiers who had died in battle , the Israeli army had killed nearly every male in the entire country . 16-18 It took six months to accomplish this , but they finally killed all except Hadad and a few royal officials who took him to Egypt ( he was a very small child at the time ) . They slipped out of Midian and went to Paran , where others joined them and accompanied them to Egypt , and Pharaoh had given them homes and food .
TLB	1%20Kings	11	19	Hadad became one of Pharaoh ’ s closest friends , and he gave him a wife—the sister of Queen Tahpenes .
TLB	1%20Kings	11	20	She presented him with a son , Genubath , who was brought up in Pharaoh ’ s palace among Pharaoh ’ s own sons .
TLB	1%20Kings	11	21	When Hadad , there in Egypt , heard that David and Joab were both dead , he asked Pharaoh for permission to return to Edom .
TLB	1%20Kings	11	22	“ Why ? ” Pharaoh asked him . “ What do you lack here ? How have we disappointed you ? ” “ Everything is wonderful , ” he replied , “ but even so , I ’ d like to go back home. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	11	23	Another of Solomon ’ s enemies whom God raised to power was Rezon , one of the officials of King Hadadezer of Zobah who had deserted his post and fled the country .
TLB	1%20Kings	11	24	He had become the leader of a gang of bandits—men who fled with him to Damascus ( where he later became king ) when David destroyed Zobah .
TLB	1%20Kings	11	25	During Solomon ’ s entire lifetime , Rezon and Hadad were his enemies , for they hated Israel intensely .
TLB	1%20Kings	11	26	Another rebel leader was Jeroboam ( the son of Nebat ) , who came from the city of Zeredah in Ephraim ; his mother was Zeruah , a widow . 27-28 Here is the story of his rebellion : Solomon was rebuilding Fort Millo , repairing the walls of this city his father had built . Jeroboam was very able , and when Solomon saw how industrious he was , he put him in charge of his labor battalions from the tribe of Joseph .
TLB	1%20Kings	11	29	One day as Jeroboam was leaving Jerusalem , the prophet Ahijah from Shiloh ( who had put on a new robe for the occasion ) met him and called him aside to talk to him . And as the two of them were alone in the field ,
TLB	1%20Kings	11	30	Ahijah tore his new robe into twelve parts
TLB	1%20Kings	11	31	and said to Jeroboam , “ Take ten of these pieces , for the Lord God of Israel says , ‘ I will tear the kingdom from the hand of Solomon and give ten of the tribes to you !
TLB	1%20Kings	11	32	But I will leave him one tribe [ b ] for the sake of my servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem , which I have chosen above all the other cities of Israel .
TLB	1%20Kings	11	33	For Solomon has forsaken me and worships Ashtoreth , the goddess of the Sidonians ; and Chemosh , the god of Moab ; and Milcom , the god of the Ammonites . He has not followed my paths and has not done what I consider right ; he has not kept my laws and instructions as his father David did .
TLB	1%20Kings	11	34	I will not take the kingdom from him now , however ; for the sake of my servant David , my chosen one who obeyed my commandments , I will let Solomon reign for the rest of his life .
TLB	1%20Kings	11	35	“ ‘ But I will take away the kingdom from his son and give ten of the tribes to you .
TLB	1%20Kings	11	36	His son shall have the other one so that the descendants of David will continue to reign in Jerusalem , the city I have chosen to be the place for my name to be enshrined .
TLB	1%20Kings	11	37	And I will place you on the throne of Israel and give you absolute power .
TLB	1%20Kings	11	38	If you listen to what I tell you and walk in my path and do whatever I consider right , obeying my commandments as my servant David did , then I will bless you ; and your descendants shall rule Israel forever . ( I once made this same promise to David .
TLB	1%20Kings	11	39	But because of Solomon ’ s sin , I will punish the descendants of David—though not forever . ) ’ ”
TLB	1%20Kings	11	40	Solomon tried to kill Jeroboam , but he fled to King Shishak of Egypt and stayed there until the death of Solomon .
TLB	1%20Kings	11	41	The rest of what Solomon did and said is written in the book The Acts of Solomon .
TLB	1%20Kings	11	42	He ruled in Jerusalem for forty years ,
TLB	1%20Kings	11	43	and then died and was buried in the city of his father David ; and his son Rehoboam reigned in his place . Footnotes -

TLB	1%20Kings	12	1	Kings 12:32 on the first of November , literally , “ on the fifteenth day of the eighth month ” ( of the Hebrew calendar ) . This was a month later than the annual celebration in Jerusalem , which God had ordained . The Living Bible copyright ©
TLB	1%20Kings	12	12	So when Jeroboam and the people returned three days later , 13-14 the new king answered them roughly . He ignored the old men ’ s advice and followed that of the young men ;
TLB	1%20Kings	12	5	“ Give me three days to think this over , ” Rehoboam replied . “ Come back then for my answer. ” So the people left .
TLB	1%20Kings	12	6	Rehoboam talked it over with the old men who had counseled his father Solomon . “ What do you think I should do ? ” he asked them .
TLB	1%20Kings	12	7	And they replied , “ If you give them a pleasant reply and agree to be good to them and serve them well , you can be their king forever. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	12	8	But Rehoboam refused the old men ’ s counsel and called in the young men with whom he had grown up .
TLB	1%20Kings	12	9	“ What do you think I should do ? ” he asked them .
TLB	1%20Kings	12	10	And the young men replied , “ Tell them , ‘ If you think my father was hard on you , well , I ’ ll be harder !
TLB	1%20Kings	12	11	Yes , my father was harsh , but I ’ ll be even harsher ! My father used whips on you , but I ’ ll use scorpions ! ’ ”
TLB	1%20Kings	12	15	so the king refused the people ’ s demands . ( But the Lord ’ s hand was in it—he caused the new king to do this in order to fulfill his promise to Jeroboam , made through Ahijah , the prophet from Shiloh . ) 16-17 When the people realized that the king meant what he said and was refusing to listen to them , they began shouting , “ Down with David and all his relatives ! Let ’ s go home ! Let Rehoboam be king of his own family ! ” And they all deserted him except for the tribe of Judah , who remained loyal and accepted Rehoboam as their king .
TLB	1%20Kings	12	18	When King Rehoboam sent Adoram ( who was in charge of the draft ) to conscript men from the other tribes , a great mob stoned him to death . But King Rehoboam escaped by chariot and fled to Jerusalem .
TLB	1%20Kings	12	19	And Israel has been in rebellion against the dynasty of David to this day .
TLB	1%20Kings	12	20	When the people of Israel learned of Jeroboam ’ s return from Egypt , he was asked to come before an open meeting of all the people ; and there he was made king of Israel . Only the tribe of Judah [ a ] continued under the kingship of the family of David .
TLB	1%20Kings	12	21	When King Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem , he summoned his army—all the able-bodied men of Judah and Benjamin : 180,000 special troops—to force the rest of Israel to acknowledge him as their king .
TLB	1%20Kings	12	22	But God sent this message to Shemaiah , the prophet : 23-24 “ Tell Rehoboam the son of Solomon , king of Judah , and all the people of Judah and Benjamin that they must not fight against their brothers , the people of Israel . Tell them to disband and go home , for what has happened to Rehoboam is according to my wish. ” So the army went home as the Lord had commanded .
TLB	1%20Kings	12	25	Jeroboam now built the city of Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim , and it became his capital . Later he built Penuel .
TLB	1%20Kings	12	26	Jeroboam thought , “ Unless I ’ m careful , the people will want a descendant of David as their king .
TLB	1%20Kings	12	27	When they go to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices at the Temple , they will become friendly with King Rehoboam ; then they will kill me and ask him to be their king instead. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	12	28	So on the advice of his counselors , the king had two golden calf idols made and told the people , “ It ’ s too much trouble to go to Jerusalem to worship ; from now on these will be your gods—they rescued you from your captivity in Egypt ! ”
TLB	1%20Kings	12	29	One of these calf idols was placed in Bethel and the other in Dan .
TLB	1%20Kings	12	30	This was of course a great sin , for the people worshiped them .
TLB	1%20Kings	12	31	He also made shrines on the hills and ordained priests from the rank and file of the people—even those who were not from the priestly tribe of Levi . 32-33 Jeroboam also announced that the annual Tabernacle Festival would be held at Bethel on the first of November [ b ] ( a date he decided upon himself ) , similar to the annual festival at Jerusalem ; he himself offered sacrifices upon the altar to the calves at Bethel and burned incense to them . And it was there at Bethel that he ordained priests for the shrines on the hills . Footnotes -

TLB	1%20Kings	13	1	Kings
TLB	1%20Kings	13	13	“ Quick , saddle the donkey , ” the old man said . And when they had saddled the donkey for him ,
TLB	1%20Kings	13	2	Then , at the Lord ’ s command , the prophet shouted , “ O altar , the Lord says that a child named Josiah shall be born into the family line of David , and he shall sacrifice upon you the priests from the shrines on the hills who come here to burn incense ; and men ’ s bones shall be burned upon you. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	13	3	Then he gave this proof that his message was from the Lord : “ This altar will split apart , and the ashes on it will spill to the ground. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	13	4	The king was very angry with the prophet for saying this . He shouted to his guards , “ Arrest that man ! ” and shook his fist at him . Instantly the king ’ s arm became paralyzed in that position ; he couldn ’ t pull it back again !
TLB	1%20Kings	13	5	At the same moment a wide crack appeared in the altar and the ashes poured out , just as the prophet had said would happen . For this was the prophet ’ s proof that God had been speaking through him .
TLB	1%20Kings	13	6	“ Oh , please , please , ” the king cried out to the prophet , “ beg the Lord your God to restore my arm again. ” So he prayed to the Lord , and the king ’ s arm became normal again .
TLB	1%20Kings	13	7	Then the king said to the prophet , “ Come to the palace with me and rest awhile and have some food ; and I ’ ll give you a reward because you healed my arm. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	13	8	But the prophet said to the king , “ Even if you gave me half your palace , I wouldn ’ t go into it ; nor would I eat or drink even water in this place !
TLB	1%20Kings	13	9	For the Lord has given me strict orders not to eat anything or drink any water while I ’ m here , and not to return to Judah by the road I came on. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	13	10	So he went back another way .
TLB	1%20Kings	13	11	As it happened , there was an old prophet living in Bethel , and his sons went home and told him what the prophet from Judah had done and what he had said to the king .
TLB	1%20Kings	13	12	“ Which way did he go ? ” the old prophet asked . So they told him .
TLB	1%20Kings	13	14	he rode after the prophet and found him sitting under an oak tree . “ Are you the prophet who came from Judah ? ” he asked him . “ Yes , ” he replied , “ I am. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	13	15	Then the old man said to the prophet , “ Come home with me and eat. ” 16-17 “ No , ” he replied , “ I can ’ t ; for I am not allowed to eat anything or to drink any water at Bethel . The Lord strictly warned me against it ; and he also told me not to return home by the same road I came on. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	13	18	But the old man said , “ I am a prophet too , just as you are ; and an angel gave me a message from the Lord . I am to take you home with me and give you food and water. ” But the old man was lying to him .
TLB	1%20Kings	13	19	So they went back together , and the prophet ate some food and drank some water at the old man ’ s home .
TLB	1%20Kings	13	20	Then , suddenly , while they were sitting at the table , a message from the Lord came to the old man , 21-22 and he shouted at the prophet from Judah , “ The Lord says that because you have been disobedient to his clear command and have come here , and have eaten and drunk water in the place he told you not to , therefore your body shall not be buried in the grave of your fathers. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	13	23	After finishing the meal , the old man saddled the prophet ’ s donkey , 24-25 and the prophet started off again . But as he was traveling along , a lion came out and killed him . His body lay there on the road , with the donkey and the lion standing beside it . Those who came by and saw the body lying in the road and the lion standing quietly beside it , reported it in Bethel where the old prophet lived .
TLB	1%20Kings	13	26	When he heard what had happened he exclaimed , “ It is the prophet who disobeyed the Lord ’ s command ; the Lord fulfilled his warning by causing the lion to kill him. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	13	27	Then he said to his sons , “ Saddle my donkey ! ” And they did .
TLB	1%20Kings	13	28	He found the prophet ’ s body lying in the road ; and the donkey and lion were still standing there beside it , for the lion had not eaten the body nor attacked the donkey .
TLB	1%20Kings	13	29	So the prophet laid the body upon the donkey and took it back to the city to mourn over it and bury it .
TLB	1%20Kings	13	30	He laid the body in his own grave , exclaiming , “ Alas , my brother ! ”
TLB	1%20Kings	13	31	Afterwards he said to his sons , “ When I die , bury me in the grave where the prophet is buried . Lay my bones beside his bones .
TLB	1%20Kings	13	32	For the Lord told him to shout against the altar in Bethel , and his curse against the shrines in the cities of Samaria shall surely be fulfilled. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	13	33	Despite the prophet ’ s warning , Jeroboam did not turn away from his evil ways ; instead , he made more priests than ever from the common people , to offer sacrifices to idols in the shrines on the hills . Anyone who wanted to could be a priest .
TLB	1%20Kings	13	34	This was a great sin and resulted in the destruction of Jeroboam ’ s kingdom and the death of all of his family . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	1%20Kings	14	1	Kings 14:10 this boy who is sick and all those who are well , literally , “ every male , both bond and free. ” The Living Bible copyright ©
TLB	1%20Kings	14	14	And the Lord will raise up a king over Israel who will destroy the family of Jeroboam .
TLB	1%20Kings	14	2	Jeroboam told his wife , “ Disguise yourself so that no one will recognize you as the queen , and go to Ahijah the prophet at Shiloh—the man who told me that I would become king .
TLB	1%20Kings	14	3	Take him a gift of ten loaves of bread , some fig bars , and a jar of honey , and ask him whether the boy will recover. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	14	4	So his wife went to Ahijah ’ s home at Shiloh . He was an old man now and could no longer see .
TLB	1%20Kings	14	5	But the Lord told him that the queen , pretending to be someone else , would come to ask about her son , for he was very sick . And the Lord told him what to tell her .
TLB	1%20Kings	14	6	So when Ahijah heard her at the door , he called out , “ Come in , wife of Jeroboam ! Why are you pretending to be someone else ? ” Then he told her , “ I have sad news for you .
TLB	1%20Kings	14	7	Give your husband this message from the Lord God of Israel : ‘ I promoted you from the ranks of the common people and made you king of Israel .
TLB	1%20Kings	14	8	I ripped the kingdom away from the family of David and gave it to you , but you have not obeyed my commandments as my servant David did . His heart ’ s desire was always to obey me and to do whatever I wanted him to .
TLB	1%20Kings	14	9	But you have done more evil than all the other kings before you ; you have made other gods and have made me furious with your gold calves . And since you have refused to acknowledge me ,
TLB	1%20Kings	14	10	I will bring disaster upon your home and will destroy all of your sons—this boy who is sick and all those who are well . [ a ] I will sweep away your family as a stable hand shovels out manure .
TLB	1%20Kings	14	11	I vow that those of your family who die in the city shall be eaten by dogs , and those who die in the field shall be eaten by birds. ’ ”
TLB	1%20Kings	14	12	Then Ahijah said to Jeroboam ’ s wife , “ Go on home , and when you step into the city , the child will die .
TLB	1%20Kings	14	13	All of Israel will mourn for him and bury him , but he is the only member of your family who will come to a quiet end . For this child is the only good thing that the Lord God of Israel sees in the entire family of Jeroboam .
TLB	1%20Kings	14	15	Then the Lord will shake Israel like a reed whipped about in a stream ; he will uproot the people of Israel from this good land of their fathers and scatter them beyond the Euphrates River , for they have angered the Lord by worshiping idol-gods .
TLB	1%20Kings	14	16	He will abandon Israel because Jeroboam sinned and made all of Israel sin along with him. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	14	17	So Jeroboam ’ s wife returned to Tirzah ; and the child died just as she walked through the door of her home .
TLB	1%20Kings	14	18	And there was mourning for him throughout the land , just as the Lord had predicted through Ahijah .
TLB	1%20Kings	14	19	The rest of Jeroboam ’ s activities—his wars and the other events of his reign—are recorded in The Annals of the Kings of Israel .
TLB	1%20Kings	14	20	Jeroboam reigned twenty-two years , and when he died , his son Nadab took the throne .
TLB	1%20Kings	14	21	Meanwhile , Rehoboam the son of Solomon was king in Judah . He was forty-one years old when he began to reign , and he was on the throne seventeen years in Jerusalem , the city which , among all the cities of Israel , the Lord had chosen to live in . ( Rehoboam ’ s mother was Naamah , an Ammonite woman . )
TLB	1%20Kings	14	22	During his reign the people of Judah , like those in Israel , did wrong and angered the Lord with their sin , for it was even worse than that of their ancestors .
TLB	1%20Kings	14	23	They built shrines and obelisks and idols on every high hill and under every green tree .
TLB	1%20Kings	14	24	There was homosexuality throughout the land , and the people of Judah became as depraved as the heathen nations which the Lord drove out to make room for his people .
TLB	1%20Kings	14	25	In the fifth year of Rehoboam ’ s reign , King Shishak of Egypt attacked and conquered Jerusalem .
TLB	1%20Kings	14	26	He ransacked the Temple and the palace and stole everything , including all the gold shields Solomon had made .
TLB	1%20Kings	14	27	Afterwards Rehoboam made bronze shields as substitutes , and the palace guards used these instead .
TLB	1%20Kings	14	28	Whenever the king went to the Temple , the guards paraded before him and then took the shields back to the guard chamber .
TLB	1%20Kings	14	29	The other events in Rehoboam ’ s reign are written in The Annals of the Kings of Judah .
TLB	1%20Kings	14	30	There was constant war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam .
TLB	1%20Kings	14	31	When Rehoboam died—his mother was Naamah the Ammonitess—he was buried among his ancestors in Jerusalem , and his son Abijam took the throne . Footnotes -

TLB	1%20Kings	15	15	He made permanent exhibits in the Temple of the bronze shields his grandfather had dedicated , [ d ] along with the silver and gold vessels he himself had donated .
TLB	1%20Kings	15	3	He was as great a sinner as his father was , and his heart was not right with God , as King David ’ s was .
TLB	1%20Kings	15	4	But despite Abijam ’ s sin , the Lord remembered David ’ s love [ a ] and did not end the line of David ’ s royal descendants .
TLB	1%20Kings	15	5	For David had obeyed God during his entire life except for the affair concerning Uriah the Hittite .
TLB	1%20Kings	15	6	During Abijam ’ s reign there was constant war between Israel and Judah . [ b ]
TLB	1%20Kings	15	7	The rest of Abijam ’ s history is recorded in The Annals of the Kings of Judah .
TLB	1%20Kings	15	8	When he died he was buried in Jerusalem , and his son Asa reigned in his place .
TLB	1%20Kings	15	9	Asa became king of Judah , in Jerusalem , in the twentieth year of the reign of Jeroboam over Israel ,
TLB	1%20Kings	15	10	and reigned forty-one years . ( His grandmother was Maacah , the daughter of Abishalom . )
TLB	1%20Kings	15	11	He pleased the Lord like his ancestor King David .
TLB	1%20Kings	15	12	He executed the male prostitutes and removed all the idols his father had made .
TLB	1%20Kings	15	13	He deposed his grandmother Maacah as queen mother because she had made an idol—which he cut down and burned at Kidron Brook .
TLB	1%20Kings	15	14	However , the shrines on the hills were not removed , for Asa did not realize that these were wrong . [ c ]
TLB	1%20Kings	15	16	There was lifelong war between King Asa of Judah and King Baasha of Israel .
TLB	1%20Kings	15	17	King Baasha built the fortress city of Ramah in an attempt to cut off all trade with Jerusalem .
TLB	1%20Kings	15	18	Then Asa took all the silver and gold left in the Temple treasury and all the treasures of the palace , and gave them to his officials to take to Damascus , to King Ben-hadad of Syria , with this message :
TLB	1%20Kings	15	19	“ Let us be allies just as our fathers were . I am sending you a present of gold and silver . Now break your alliance with King Baasha of Israel so that he will leave me alone. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	15	20	Ben-hadad agreed and sent his armies against some of the cities of Israel ; and he destroyed Ijon , Dan , Abel-beth-maacah , all of Chinneroth , and all the cities in the land of Naphtali .
TLB	1%20Kings	15	21	When Baasha received word of the attack , he discontinued building the city of Ramah and returned to Tirzah .
TLB	1%20Kings	15	22	Then King Asa made a proclamation to all Judah , asking every able-bodied man to help demolish Ramah and haul away its stones and timbers . And King Asa used these materials to build the city of Geba in Benjamin and the city of Mizpah .
TLB	1%20Kings	15	23	The rest of Asa ’ s biography—his conquests and deeds and the names of the cities he built—is found in The Annals of the Kings of Judah . In his old age his feet became diseased ,
TLB	1%20Kings	15	24	and when he died , he was buried in the royal cemetery in Jerusalem . Then his son Jehoshaphat became the new king of Judah .
TLB	1%20Kings	15	25	Meanwhile over in Israel , Nadab , the son of Jeroboam , had become king . He reigned two years , beginning in the second year of the reign of King Asa of Judah .
TLB	1%20Kings	15	26	But he was not a good king ; like his father , he worshiped many idols and led all of Israel into sin .
TLB	1%20Kings	15	27	Then Baasha ( the son of Ahijah , from the tribe of Issachar ) plotted against him and assassinated him while he was with the Israeli army laying siege to the Philistine city of Gibbethon .
TLB	1%20Kings	15	28	So Baasha replaced Nadab as the king of Israel in Tirzah during the third year of the reign of King Asa of Judah .
TLB	1%20Kings	15	29	He immediately killed all of the descendants of King Jeroboam , so that not one of the royal family was left , just as the Lord had said would happen when he spoke through Ahijah , the prophet from Shiloh .
TLB	1%20Kings	15	30	This was done because Jeroboam had angered the Lord God of Israel by sinning and leading the rest of Israel into sin .
TLB	1%20Kings	15	31	Further details of Baasha ’ s reign are recorded in The Annals of the Kings of Israel . 32-33 There was continuous warfare between King Asa of Judah and King Baasha of Israel . Baasha reigned for twenty-four years ,
TLB	1%20Kings	15	34	but all that time he continually disobeyed the Lord . He followed the evil paths of Jeroboam , for he led the people of Israel into the sin of worshiping idols . Footnotes -

TLB	1%20Kings	16	1	Kings 16:34 the Lord ’ s curse upon Jericho , see Joshua 6:26 . The Living Bible copyright ©
TLB	1%20Kings	16	16	A message of condemnation from the Lord was delivered to King Baasha at this time by the prophet Jehu :
TLB	1%20Kings	16	2	“ I lifted you out of the dust , ” the message said , “ to make you king of my people Israel ; but you have walked in the evil paths of Jeroboam . You have made my people sin , and I am angry !
TLB	1%20Kings	16	3	So now I will destroy you and your family , just as I did the descendants of Jeroboam . 4-7 Those of your family who die in the city will be eaten by dogs , and those who die in the fields will be eaten by the birds. ” The message was sent to Baasha and his family because he had angered the Lord by all his evil deeds . He was as evil as Jeroboam despite the fact that the Lord had destroyed all of Jeroboam ’ s descendants for their sins . The rest of Baasha ’ s biography—his deeds and conquests—are written in The Annals of the Kings of Israel .
TLB	1%20Kings	16	8	Elah , Baasha ’ s son , began reigning during the twenty-sixth year of the reign of King Asa of Judah , but he reigned only two years .
TLB	1%20Kings	16	9	Then General Zimri , who had charge of half the royal chariot troops , plotted against him . One day King Elah was half drunk at the home of Arza , the superintendent of the palace , in the capital city of Tirzah .
TLB	1%20Kings	16	10	Zimri simply walked in and struck him down and killed him . ( This occurred during the twenty-seventh year of the reign of King Asa of Judah . ) Then Zimri declared himself to be the new king of Israel .
TLB	1%20Kings	16	11	He immediately killed the entire royal family—leaving not a single male child . He even destroyed distant relatives and friends .
TLB	1%20Kings	16	12	This destruction of the descendants of Baasha was in line with what the Lord had predicted through the prophet Jehu .
TLB	1%20Kings	16	13	The tragedy occurred because of the sins of Baasha and his son Elah ; for they had led Israel into worshiping idols , and the Lord was very angry about it .
TLB	1%20Kings	16	14	The rest of the history of Elah ’ s reign is written in The Annals of the Kings of Israel . 15-16 But Zimri lasted only seven days ; for when the army of Israel , which was then engaged in attacking the Philistine city of Gibbethon , heard that Zimri had assassinated the king , they decided on General Omri , commander-in-chief of the army , as their new ruler .
TLB	1%20Kings	16	17	So Omri led the army of Gibbethon to besiege Tirzah , Israel ’ s capital .
TLB	1%20Kings	16	18	When Zimri saw that the city had been taken , he went into the palace and burned it over him and died in the flames .
TLB	1%20Kings	16	19	For he , too , had sinned like Jeroboam ; he had worshiped idols and had led the people of Israel to sin with him .
TLB	1%20Kings	16	20	The rest of the story of Zimri and his treason are written in The Annals of the Kings of Israel .
TLB	1%20Kings	16	21	But now the kingdom of Israel was split in two ; half the people were loyal to General Omri , and the other half followed Tibni , the son of Ginath .
TLB	1%20Kings	16	22	But General Omri won and Tibni was killed ; so Omri reigned without opposition .
TLB	1%20Kings	16	23	King Asa of Judah had been on the throne thirty-one years when Omri began his reign over Israel , which lasted twelve years , six of them in Tirzah .
TLB	1%20Kings	16	24	Then Omri bought the hill now known as Samaria from its owner , Shemer , for $ 4,000 and built a city on it , calling it Samaria in honor of Shemer .
TLB	1%20Kings	16	25	But Omri was worse than any of the kings before him ;
TLB	1%20Kings	16	26	he worshiped idols as Jeroboam had and led Israel into this same sin . So God was very angry .
TLB	1%20Kings	16	27	The rest of Omri ’ s history is recorded in The Annals of the Kings of Israel .
TLB	1%20Kings	16	28	When Omri died he was buried in Samaria , and his son Ahab became king in his place .
TLB	1%20Kings	16	29	King Asa of Judah had been on the throne thirty-eight years when Ahab became the king of Israel ; and Ahab reigned for twenty-two years .
TLB	1%20Kings	16	30	But he was even more wicked than his father Omri ; he was worse than any other king of Israel !
TLB	1%20Kings	16	31	And as though that were not enough , he married Jezebel , the daughter of King Ethbaal of the Sidonians , and then began worshiping Baal .
TLB	1%20Kings	16	32	First he built a temple and an altar for Baal in Samaria .
TLB	1%20Kings	16	33	Then he made other idols and did more to anger the Lord God of Israel than any of the other kings of Israel before him .
TLB	1%20Kings	16	34	( It was during his reign that Hiel , a man from Bethel , rebuilt Jericho . When he laid the foundations , his oldest son , Abiram , died ; and when he finally completed it by setting up the gates , his youngest son , Segub , died . For this was the Lord ’ s curse upon Jericho [ a ] as declared by Joshua , the son of Nun . ) Footnotes -

TLB	1%20Kings	17	1	Kings 17:24 she told him afterward , implied . The Living Bible copyright ©
TLB	1%20Kings	17	17	But one day the woman ’ s son became sick and died .
TLB	1%20Kings	17	2	Then the Lord said to Elijah ,
TLB	1%20Kings	17	3	“ Go to the east and hide by Cherith Brook at a place east of where it enters the Jordan River .
TLB	1%20Kings	17	4	Drink from the brook and eat what the ravens bring you , for I have commanded them to feed you. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	17	5	So he did as the Lord had told him to and camped beside the brook .
TLB	1%20Kings	17	6	The ravens brought him bread and meat each morning and evening , and he drank from the brook .
TLB	1%20Kings	17	7	But after a while the brook dried up , for there was no rainfall anywhere in the land . 8-9 Then the Lord said to him , “ Go and live in the village of Zarephath , near the city of Sidon . There is a widow there who will feed you . I have given her my instructions. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	17	10	So he went to Zarephath . As he arrived at the gates of the city he saw a widow gathering sticks ; and he asked her for a cup of water .
TLB	1%20Kings	17	11	As she was going to get it , he called to her , “ Bring me a bite of bread too. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	17	12	But she said , “ I swear by the Lord your God that I haven ’ t a single piece of bread in the house . And I have only a handful of flour left and a little cooking oil in the bottom of the jar . I was just gathering a few sticks to cook this last meal , and then my son and I must die of starvation. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	17	13	But Elijah said to her , “ Don ’ t be afraid ! Go ahead and cook that ‘ last meal , ’ but bake me a little loaf of bread first ; and afterwards there will still be enough food for you and your son .
TLB	1%20Kings	17	14	For the Lord God of Israel says that there will always be plenty of flour and oil left in your containers until the time when the Lord sends rain and the crops grow again ! ”
TLB	1%20Kings	17	15	So she did as Elijah said , and she and Elijah and her son continued to eat from her supply of flour and oil as long as it was needed .
TLB	1%20Kings	17	16	For no matter how much they used , there was always plenty left in the containers , just as the Lord had promised through Elijah !
TLB	1%20Kings	17	18	“ O man of God , ” she cried , “ what have you done to me ? Have you come here to punish my sins by killing my son ? ”
TLB	1%20Kings	17	19	“ Give him to me , ” Elijah replied . And he took the boy ’ s body from her and carried it upstairs to the guest room where he lived , and laid the body on his bed ,
TLB	1%20Kings	17	20	and then cried out to the Lord , “ O Lord my God , why have you killed the son of this widow with whom I am staying ? ”
TLB	1%20Kings	17	21	And he stretched himself upon the child three times and cried out to the Lord , “ O Lord my God , please let this child ’ s spirit return to him. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	17	22	And the Lord heard Elijah ’ s prayer ; and the spirit of the child returned , and he became alive again !
TLB	1%20Kings	17	23	Then Elijah took him downstairs and gave him to his mother . “ See ! He ’ s alive ! ” he beamed .
TLB	1%20Kings	17	24	“ Now I know for sure that you are a prophet , ” she told him afterward , [ b ] “ and that whatever you say is from the Lord ! ” Footnotes -

TLB	1%20Kings	18	1	Kings 18:32 three feet wide , literally , “ as great as would contain two measures of seed. ” The Living Bible copyright ©
TLB	1%20Kings	18	18	“ You ’ re talking about yourself , ” Elijah answered . “ For you and your family have refused to obey the Lord and have worshiped Baal instead .
TLB	1%20Kings	18	2	So Elijah went to tell him . Meanwhile the famine had become very severe in Samaria . 3-4 The man in charge of Ahab ’ s household affairs was Obadiah , who was a devoted follower of the Lord . Once when Queen Jezebel had tried to kill all of the Lord ’ s prophets , Obadiah had hidden one hundred of them in two caves—fifty in each—and had fed them with bread and water .
TLB	1%20Kings	18	5	That same day , while Elijah was on the way to see King Ahab , [ a ] the king said to Obadiah , “ We must check every stream and brook to see if we can find enough grass to save at least some of my horses and mules . You go one way and I ’ ll go the other , and we will search the entire land. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	18	6	So they did , each going alone .
TLB	1%20Kings	18	7	Suddenly Obadiah saw Elijah coming toward him ! Obadiah recognized him at once and fell to the ground before him . “ Is it really you , my lord Elijah ? ” he asked .
TLB	1%20Kings	18	8	“ Yes , it is , ” Elijah replied . “ Now go and tell the king I am here. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	18	9	“ Oh , sir , ” Obadiah protested , “ what harm have I done to you that you are sending me to my death ?
TLB	1%20Kings	18	10	For I swear by God that the king has searched every nation and kingdom on earth from end to end to find you . And each time when he was told ‘ Elijah isn ’ t here , ’ King Ahab forced the king of that nation to swear to the truth of his claim .
TLB	1%20Kings	18	11	And now you say , ‘ Go and tell him Elijah is here ’ !
TLB	1%20Kings	18	12	But as soon as I leave you , the Spirit of the Lord will carry you away , who knows where , and when Ahab comes and can ’ t find you , he will kill me ; yet I have been a true servant of the Lord all my life .
TLB	1%20Kings	18	13	Has no one told you about the time when Queen Jezebel was trying to kill the Lord ’ s prophets , and I hid a hundred of them in two caves and fed them with bread and water ?
TLB	1%20Kings	18	14	And now you say , ‘ Go tell the king that Elijah is here ’ ! Sir , if I do that , I ’ m dead ! ”
TLB	1%20Kings	18	15	But Elijah said , “ I swear by the Lord God of the armies of heaven , in whose presence I stand , that I will present myself to Ahab today. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	18	16	So Obadiah went to tell Ahab that Elijah had come ; and Ahab went out to meet him .
TLB	1%20Kings	18	17	“ So it ’ s you , is it ? —the man who brought this disaster upon Israel ! ” Ahab exclaimed when he saw him .
TLB	1%20Kings	18	19	Now bring all the people of Israel to Mount Carmel , with all
TLB	1%20Kings	18	450	prophets .
TLB	1%20Kings	18	400	prophets of Asherah who are supported by Jezebel. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	18	20	So Ahab summoned all the people and the prophets to Mount Carmel .
TLB	1%20Kings	18	21	Then Elijah talked to them . “ How long are you going to waver between two opinions ? ” he asked the people . “ If the Lord is God , follow him ! But if Baal is God , then follow him ! ”
TLB	1%20Kings	18	22	Then Elijah spoke again . “ I am the only prophet of the Lord who is left , ” he told them , “ but Baal has
TLB	1%20Kings	18	23	Now bring two young bulls . The prophets of Baal may choose whichever one they wish and cut it into pieces and lay it on the wood of their altar , but without putting any fire under the wood ; and I will prepare the other young bull and lay it on the wood on the Lord ’ s altar , with no fire under it .
TLB	1%20Kings	18	24	Then pray to your god , and I will pray to the Lord ; and the god who answers by sending fire to light the wood is the true God ! ” And all the people agreed to this test .
TLB	1%20Kings	18	25	Then Elijah turned to the prophets of Baal . “ You first , ” he said , “ for there are many of you ; choose one of the bulls and prepare it and call to your god ; but don ’ t put any fire under the wood. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	18	26	So they prepared one of the young bulls and placed it on the altar ; and they called to Baal all morning , shouting , “ O Baal , hear us ! ” But there was no reply of any kind . Then they began to dance around the altar .
TLB	1%20Kings	18	27	About noontime , Elijah began mocking them . “ You ’ ll have to shout louder than that , ” he scoffed , “ to catch the attention of your god ! Perhaps he is talking to someone , or is out sitting on the toilet , or maybe he is away on a trip , or is asleep and needs to be wakened ! ”
TLB	1%20Kings	18	28	So they shouted louder and , as was their custom , cut themselves with knives and swords until the blood gushed out .
TLB	1%20Kings	18	29	They raved all afternoon until the time of the evening sacrifice , but there was no reply , no voice , no answer .
TLB	1%20Kings	18	30	Then Elijah called to the people , “ Come over here. ” And they all crowded around him as he repaired the altar of the Lord that had been torn down .
TLB	1%20Kings	18	31	He took twelve stones , one to represent each of the tribes of Israel , [ b ]
TLB	1%20Kings	18	32	and used the stones to rebuild the Lord ’ s altar . Then he dug a trench about three feet wide [ c ] around the altar .
TLB	1%20Kings	18	33	He piled wood upon the altar and cut the young bull into pieces and laid the pieces on the wood . “ Fill four barrels with water , ” he said , “ and pour the water over the carcass and the wood. ” After they had done this he said ,
TLB	1%20Kings	18	34	“ Do it again. ” And they did . “ Now , do it once more ! ” And they did ;
TLB	1%20Kings	18	35	and the water ran off the altar and filled the trench .
TLB	1%20Kings	18	36	At the customary time for offering the evening sacrifice , Elijah walked up to the altar and prayed , “ O Lord God of Abraham , Isaac , and Israel , prove today that you are the God of Israel and that I am your servant ; prove that I have done all this at your command .
TLB	1%20Kings	18	37	O Lord , answer me ! Answer me so these people will know that you are God and that you have brought them back to yourself. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	18	38	Then , suddenly , fire flashed down from heaven and burned up the young bull , the wood , the stones , the dust , and even evaporated all the water in the ditch !
TLB	1%20Kings	18	39	And when the people saw it , they fell to their faces upon the ground shouting , “ Jehovah is God ! Jehovah is God ! ”
TLB	1%20Kings	18	40	Then Elijah told them to grab the prophets of Baal . “ Don ’ t let a single one escape , ” he commanded . So they seized them all , and Elijah took them to Kishon Brook and killed them there .
TLB	1%20Kings	18	41	Then Elijah said to Ahab , “ Go and enjoy a good meal ! For I hear a mighty rainstorm coming ! ”
TLB	1%20Kings	18	42	So Ahab prepared a feast . But Elijah climbed to the top of Mount Carmel and got down on his knees , with his face between his knees ,
TLB	1%20Kings	18	43	and said to his servant , “ Go and look out toward the sea. ” He did , but returned to Elijah and told him , “ I didn ’ t see anything. ” Then Elijah told him , “ Go again , and again , and again , seven times ! ”
TLB	1%20Kings	18	44	Finally , the seventh time , his servant told him , “ I saw a little cloud about the size of a man ’ s hand rising from the sea. ” Then Elijah shouted , “ Hurry to Ahab and tell him to get into his chariot and get down the mountain , or he ’ ll be stopped by the rain ! ”
TLB	1%20Kings	18	45	And sure enough , the sky was soon black with clouds , and a heavy wind brought a terrific rainstorm . Ahab left hastily for Jezreel ,
TLB	1%20Kings	18	46	and the Lord gave special strength to Elijah so that he was able to run ahead of Ahab ’ s chariot to the entrance of the city ! Footnotes -

TLB	1%20Kings	19	1	Kings 19:19 and walked away again , implied . The Living Bible copyright ©
TLB	1%20Kings	19	19	So Elijah went and found Elisha who was plowing a field with eleven other teams ahead of him ; he was at the end of the line with the last team . Elijah went over to him and threw his coat across his shoulders and walked away again . [ b ]
TLB	1%20Kings	19	2	she sent this message to Elijah : “ You killed my prophets , and now I swear by the gods that I am going to kill you by this time tomorrow night. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	19	3	So Elijah fled for his life ; he went to Beersheba , a city of Judah , and left his servant there .
TLB	1%20Kings	19	4	Then he went on alone into the wilderness , traveling all day , and sat down under a broom bush and prayed that he might die . “ I ’ ve had enough , ” he told the Lord . “ Take away my life . I ’ ve got to die sometime , and it might as well be now. ” [ a ]
TLB	1%20Kings	19	5	Then he lay down and slept beneath the broom bush . But as he was sleeping , an Angel touched him and told him to get up and eat !
TLB	1%20Kings	19	6	He looked around and saw some bread baking on hot stones and a jar of water ! So he ate and drank and lay down again .
TLB	1%20Kings	19	7	Then the Angel of the Lord came again and touched him and said , “ Get up and eat some more , for there is a long journey ahead of you. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	19	8	So he got up and ate and drank , and the food gave him enough strength to travel forty days and forty nights to Mount Horeb , the mountain of God ,
TLB	1%20Kings	19	9	where he lived in a cave . But the Lord said to him , “ What are you doing here , Elijah ? ”
TLB	1%20Kings	19	10	He replied , “ I have worked very hard for the Lord God of the heavens ; but the people of Israel have broken their covenant with you and torn down your altars and killed your prophets , and only I am left ; and now they are trying to kill me too. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	19	11	“ Go out and stand before me on the mountain , ” the Lord told him . And as Elijah stood there the Lord passed by , and a mighty windstorm hit the mountain ; it was such a terrible blast that the rocks were torn loose , but the Lord was not in the wind . After the wind , there was an earthquake , but the Lord was not in the earthquake .
TLB	1%20Kings	19	12	And after the earthquake , there was a fire , but the Lord was not in the fire . And after the fire , there was the sound of a gentle whisper .
TLB	1%20Kings	19	13	When Elijah heard it , he wrapped his face in his scarf and went out and stood at the entrance of the cave . And a voice said , “ Why are you here , Elijah ? ”
TLB	1%20Kings	19	14	He replied again , “ I have been working very hard for the Lord God of the armies of heaven , but the people have broken their covenant and have torn down your altars ; they have killed every one of your prophets except me ; and now they are trying to kill me too. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	19	15	Then the Lord told him , “ Go back by the desert road to Damascus , and when you arrive , anoint Hazael to be king of Syria .
TLB	1%20Kings	19	16	Then anoint Jehu ( son of Nimshi ) to be king of Israel , and anoint Elisha ( the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah ) to replace you as my prophet .
TLB	1%20Kings	19	17	Anyone who escapes from Hazael shall be killed by Jehu , and those who escape Jehu shall be killed by Elisha !
TLB	1%20Kings	19	18	And incidentally , there are 7,000 men in Israel who have never bowed to Baal nor kissed him ! ”
TLB	1%20Kings	19	20	Elisha left the oxen standing there and ran after Elijah and said to him , “ First let me go and say good-bye to my father and mother , and then I ’ ll go with you ! ” Elijah replied , “ Go on back ! Why all the excitement ? ”
TLB	1%20Kings	19	21	Elisha then returned to his oxen , killed them , and used wood from the plow to build a fire to roast their flesh . He passed around the meat to the other plowmen , and they all had a great feast . Then he went with Elijah , as his assistant . Footnotes -

TLB	1%20Kings	20	1	Kings 20:9 your men may not search the palace and the homes of the people , literally , “ this thing I can not do. ” The Living Bible copyright ©
TLB	1%20Kings	20	20	Each one killed a Syrian soldier , and suddenly the entire Syrian army panicked and fled . The Israelis chased them , but King Ben-hadad and a few others escaped on horses .
TLB	1%20Kings	20	4	“ All right , my lord , ” Ahab replied . “ All that I have is yours ! ” 5-6 Soon Ben-hadad ’ s messengers returned again with another message : “ You must not only give me your silver , gold , wives , and children , but about this time tomorrow I will send my men to search your palace and the homes of your people , and they will take away whatever they like ! ”
TLB	1%20Kings	20	7	Then Ahab summoned his advisors . “ Look what this man is doing , ” he complained to them . “ He is stirring up trouble despite the fact that I have already told him he could have my wives and children and silver and gold , just as he demanded. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	20	8	“ Don ’ t give him anything more , ” the elders advised .
TLB	1%20Kings	20	9	So he told the messengers from Ben-hadad , “ Tell my lord the king , ‘ I will give you everything you asked for the first time , but your men may not search the palace and the homes of the people. ’ ” [ a ] So the messengers returned to Ben-hadad .
TLB	1%20Kings	20	10	Then the Syrian king sent this message to Ahab : “ May the gods do more to me than I am going to do to you if I don ’ t turn Samaria into handfuls of dust ! ”
TLB	1%20Kings	20	11	The king of Israel retorted , “ Don ’ t count your chickens before they hatch ! ”
TLB	1%20Kings	20	12	This reply of Ahab ’ s reached Ben-hadad and the other kings as they were drinking in their tents . “ Prepare to attack ! ” Ben-hadad commanded his officers .
TLB	1%20Kings	20	13	Then a prophet came to see King Ahab and gave him this message from the Lord : “ Do you see all these enemy forces ? I will deliver them all to you today . Then at last you will know that I am the Lord. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	20	14	Ahab asked , “ How will he do it ? ” And the prophet replied , “ The Lord says , ‘ By the troops from the provinces. ’ ” “ Shall we attack first ? ” Ahab asked . “ Yes , ” the prophet answered .
TLB	1%20Kings	20	15	So he mustered the troops from the provinces ,
TLB	1%20Kings	20	232	of them , then the rest of his army of 7,000 men .
TLB	1%20Kings	20	16	About noontime , as Ben-hadad and the thirty-two allied kings were still drinking themselves drunk , the first of Ahab ’ s troops marched out of the city .
TLB	1%20Kings	20	17	As they approached , Ben-hadad ’ s scouts reported to him , “ Some troops are coming ! ”
TLB	1%20Kings	20	18	“ Take them alive , ” Ben-hadad commanded , “ whether they have come for truce or for war. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	20	19	By now Ahab ’ s entire army had joined the attack .
TLB	1%20Kings	20	21	However , the great bulk of the horses and chariots were captured , and most of the Syrian army was killed in a great slaughter .
TLB	1%20Kings	20	22	Then the prophet approached King Ahab and said , “ Get ready for another attack by the king of Syria. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	20	23	For after their defeat , Ben-hadad ’ s officers said to him , “ The Israeli God is a god of the hills ; that is why they won . But we can beat them easily on the plains .
TLB	1%20Kings	20	24	Only this time replace the kings with generals !
TLB	1%20Kings	20	25	Recruit another army like the one you lost ; give us the same number of horses , chariots , and men , and we will fight against them in the plains ; there ’ s not a shadow of a doubt that we will beat them. ” So King Ben-hadad did as they suggested .
TLB	1%20Kings	20	26	The following year he called up the Syrian army and marched out against Israel again , this time at Aphek .
TLB	1%20Kings	20	27	Israel then mustered its army , set up supply lines , and moved into the battle ; but the Israeli army looked like two little flocks of baby goats in comparison to the vast Syrian forces that filled the countryside !
TLB	1%20Kings	20	28	Then a prophet went to the king of Israel with this message from the Lord : “ Because the Syrians have declared , ‘ The Lord is a God of the hills and not of the plains , ’ I will help you defeat this vast army , and you shall know that I am indeed the Lord. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	20	29	The two armies camped opposite each other for seven days , and on the seventh day the battle began . And the Israelis killed 100,000 Syrian infantrymen that first day .
TLB	1%20Kings	20	30	The rest fled behind the walls of Aphek , but the wall fell on them and killed another 27,000 . Ben-hadad fled into the city and hid in the inner room of one of the houses .
TLB	1%20Kings	20	31	“ Sir , ” his officers said to him , “ we have heard that the kings of Israel are very merciful . Let us wear sackcloth and put ropes on our heads and go out to King Ahab to see if he will let you live. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	20	32	So they went to the king of Israel and begged , “ Your servant Ben-hadad pleads , ‘ Let me live ! ’ ” “ Oh , is he still alive ? ” the king of Israel asked . “ He is my brother ! ”
TLB	1%20Kings	20	33	The men were quick to grab this straw of hope and hurried to clinch the matter by exclaiming , “ Yes , your brother Ben-hadad ! ” “ Go and get him , ” the king of Israel told them . And when Ben-hadad arrived , he invited him up into his chariot !
TLB	1%20Kings	20	34	Ben-hadad told him , “ I will restore the cities my father took from your father , and you may establish trading posts in Damascus , as my father did in Samaria. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	20	35	Meanwhile , the Lord instructed one of the prophets to say to another man , “ Strike me with your sword ! ” But the man refused .
TLB	1%20Kings	20	36	Then the prophet told him , “ Because you have not obeyed the voice of the Lord , a lion shall kill you as soon as you leave me. ” And sure enough , as he turned to go a lion attacked and killed him .
TLB	1%20Kings	20	37	Then the prophet turned to another man and said , “ Strike me with your sword. ” And he did , wounding him .
TLB	1%20Kings	20	38	The prophet waited for the king beside the road , having placed a bandage over his eyes to disguise himself .
TLB	1%20Kings	20	39	As the king passed by , the prophet called out to him , “ Sir , I was in the battle , and a man brought me a prisoner and said , ‘ Keep this man ; if he gets away , you must die , or else pay me $ 2,000 ! ’
TLB	1%20Kings	20	40	But while I was busy doing something else , the prisoner disappeared ! ” “ Well , it ’ s your own fault , ” the king replied . “ You ’ ll have to pay. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	20	41	Then the prophet yanked off the bandage from his eyes , and the king recognized him as one of the prophets .
TLB	1%20Kings	20	42	Then the prophet told him , “ The Lord says , ‘ Because you have spared the man I said must die , now you must die in his place , and your people shall perish instead of his. ’ ”
TLB	1%20Kings	20	43	So the king of Israel went home to Samaria angry and sullen . Footnotes -

TLB	1%20Kings	21	21	The Lord is going to bring great harm to you and sweep you away ; he will not let a single one of your male descendants survive !
TLB	1%20Kings	21	2	One day the king talked to him about selling him this land . “ I want it for a garden , ” the king explained , “ because it ’ s so convenient to the palace. ” He offered cash or , if Naboth preferred , a piece of better land in trade .
TLB	1%20Kings	21	3	But Naboth replied , “ Not on your life ! That land has been in my family for generations. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	21	4	So Ahab went back to the palace angry and sullen . He refused to eat and went to bed with his face to the wall !
TLB	1%20Kings	21	5	“ What in the world is the matter ? ” his wife , Jezebel , asked him . “ Why aren ’ t you eating ? What has made you so upset and angry ? ”
TLB	1%20Kings	21	6	“ I asked Naboth to sell me his vineyard or to trade it , and he refused ! ” Ahab told her .
TLB	1%20Kings	21	7	“ Are you the king of Israel or not ? ” Jezebel demanded . “ Get up and eat and don ’ t worry about it . I ’ ll get you Naboth ’ s vineyard ! ”
TLB	1%20Kings	21	8	So she wrote letters in Ahab ’ s name , sealed them with his seal , and addressed them to the civic leaders of Jezreel , where Naboth lived .
TLB	1%20Kings	21	9	In her letter she commanded : “ Call the citizens together for fasting and prayer . [ a ] Then summon Naboth ,
TLB	1%20Kings	21	10	and find two scoundrels who will accuse him of cursing God and the king . Then take him out and execute him. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	21	11	The city fathers followed the queen ’ s instructions .
TLB	1%20Kings	21	12	They called the meeting and put Naboth on trial .
TLB	1%20Kings	21	13	Then two men who had no conscience accused him of cursing God and the king ; and he was dragged outside the city and stoned to death .
TLB	1%20Kings	21	14	The city officials then sent word to Jezebel that Naboth was dead .
TLB	1%20Kings	21	15	When Jezebel heard the news , she said to Ahab , “ You know the vineyard Naboth wouldn ’ t sell you ? Well , you can have it now ! He ’ s dead ! ”
TLB	1%20Kings	21	16	So Ahab went down to the vineyard to claim it .
TLB	1%20Kings	21	17	But the Lord said to Elijah ,
TLB	1%20Kings	21	18	“ Go to Samaria to meet King Ahab . He will be at Naboth ’ s vineyard , taking possession of it .
TLB	1%20Kings	21	19	Give him this message from me : ‘ Isn ’ t killing Naboth bad enough ? Must you rob him too ? Because you have done this , dogs shall lick your blood outside the city just as they licked the blood of Naboth ! ’ ”
TLB	1%20Kings	21	20	“ So my enemy has found me ! ” Ahab exclaimed to Elijah . “ Yes , ” Elijah answered , “ I have come to place God ’ s curse upon you because you have sold yourself to the devil . [ b ]
TLB	1%20Kings	21	22	He is going to destroy your family as he did the family of King Jeroboam and the family of King Baasha , for you have made him very angry and have led all of Israel into sin .
TLB	1%20Kings	21	23	The Lord has also told me that the dogs of Jezreel shall tear apart the body of your wife , Jezebel .
TLB	1%20Kings	21	24	The members of your family who die in the city shall be eaten by dogs , and those who die in the country shall be eaten by vultures. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	21	25	No one else was so completely sold out to the devil as Ahab , for his wife , Jezebel , encouraged him to do every sort of evil .
TLB	1%20Kings	21	26	He was especially guilty because he worshiped idols just as the Amorites did—the people whom the Lord had chased out of the land to make room for the people of Israel .
TLB	1%20Kings	21	27	When Ahab heard these prophecies , he tore his clothing , put on rags , fasted , slept in sackcloth , and went about in deep humility .
TLB	1%20Kings	21	28	Then another message came to Elijah :
TLB	1%20Kings	21	29	“ Do you see how Ahab has humbled himself before me ? Because he has done this , I will not do what I promised during his lifetime ; it will happen to his sons ; I will destroy his descendants. ” Footnotes -

TLB	1%20Kings	22	22	“ ‘ How ? ’ the Lord asked . “ And he replied , ‘ I will go as a lying spirit in the mouths of all his prophets. ’ “ And the Lord said , ‘ That will do it ; you will succeed . Go ahead. ’
TLB	1%20Kings	22	2	But during the third year , while King Jehoshaphat of Judah was visiting King Ahab of Israel ,
TLB	1%20Kings	22	3	Ahab said to his officials , “ Do you realize that the Syrians are still occupying our city of Ramoth-gilead ? And we ’ re sitting here without doing a thing about it ! ”
TLB	1%20Kings	22	4	Then he turned to Jehoshaphat and asked him , “ Will you send your army with mine to recover Ramoth-gilead ? ” And King Jehoshaphat of Judah replied , “ Of course ! You and I are brothers ; my people are yours to command , and my horses are at your service .
TLB	1%20Kings	22	5	But , ” he added , “ we should ask the Lord first , to be sure of what he wants us to do. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	22	6	So King Ahab summoned his
TLB	1%20Kings	22	400	Asherah priests left alive by Elijah at Carmel , though the
TLB	1%20Kings	22	7	But Jehoshaphat asked , “ Isn ’ t there a prophet of the Lord here ? I ’ d like to ask him too. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	22	8	“ Well , there ’ s one , ” King Ahab replied , “ but I hate him , for he never prophesies anything good . He always has something gloomy to say . His name is Micaiah , the son of Imlah. ” “ Oh , come now ! ” Jehoshaphat replied . “ Don ’ t talk like that ! ”
TLB	1%20Kings	22	9	So King Ahab called to one of his aides , “ Go get Micaiah . Hurry ! ”
TLB	1%20Kings	22	10	Meanwhile , all the prophets continued prophesying before the two kings , who were dressed in their royal robes and were sitting on thrones placed on the threshing floor near the city gate .
TLB	1%20Kings	22	11	One of the prophets , Zedekiah ( son of Chenaanah ) , made some iron horns and declared , “ The Lord promises that you will push the Syrians around with these horns until they are destroyed. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	22	12	And all the others agreed . “ Go ahead and attack Ramoth-gilead , ” they said , “ for the Lord will cause you to triumph ! ”
TLB	1%20Kings	22	13	The messenger who went to get Micaiah told him what the other prophets were saying and urged him to say the same thing .
TLB	1%20Kings	22	14	But Micaiah told him , “ This I vow , that I will say only what the Lord tells me to ! ”
TLB	1%20Kings	22	15	When he arrived , the king asked him , “ Micaiah , shall we attack Ramoth-gilead , or not ? ” “ Why , of course ! Go right ahead ! ” Micaiah told him . “ You will have a great victory , for the Lord will cause you to conquer ! ”
TLB	1%20Kings	22	16	“ How many times must I tell you to speak only what the Lord tells you to ? ” the king demanded .
TLB	1%20Kings	22	17	Then Micaiah told him , “ I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains as sheep without a shepherd . And the Lord said , ‘ Their king is dead ; send them to their homes. ’ ”
TLB	1%20Kings	22	18	Turning to Jehoshaphat , Ahab complained , “ Didn ’ t I tell you this would happen ? He never tells me anything good . It ’ s always bad. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	22	19	Then Micaiah said , “ Listen to this further word from the Lord . I saw the Lord sitting on his throne , and the armies of heaven stood around him .
TLB	1%20Kings	22	20	“ Then the Lord said , ‘ Who will entice Ahab to go and die at Ramoth-gilead ? ’ “ Various suggestions were made ,
TLB	1%20Kings	22	21	until one angel approached the Lord and said , ‘ I ’ ll do it ! ’
TLB	1%20Kings	22	23	“ Don ’ t you see ? The Lord has put a lying spirit in the mouths of all these prophets , but the fact of the matter is that the Lord has decreed disaster upon you. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	22	24	Then Zedekiah ( son of Chenaanah ) walked over and slapped Micaiah on the face . “ When did the Spirit of the Lord leave me and speak to you ? ” he demanded .
TLB	1%20Kings	22	25	And Micaiah replied , “ You will have the answer to your question when you find yourself hiding in an inner room. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	22	26	Then King Ahab ordered Micaiah ’ s arrest . “ Take him to Amon , the mayor of the city , and to my son Joash .
TLB	1%20Kings	22	27	Tell them , ‘ The king says to put this fellow in jail and feed him with bread and water—and only enough to keep him alive [ b ] —until I return in peace. ’ ”
TLB	1%20Kings	22	28	“ If you return in peace , ” Micaiah replied , “ it will prove that the Lord has not spoken through me. ” Then he turned to the people standing nearby and said , “ Take note of what I ’ ve said. ”
TLB	1%20Kings	22	29	So King Ahab of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah led their armies to Ramoth-gilead .
TLB	1%20Kings	22	30	Ahab said to Jehoshaphat , “ You wear your royal robes , but I ’ ll not wear mine ! ” So Ahab went into the battle disguised in an ordinary soldier ’ s uniform .
TLB	1%20Kings	22	31	For the king of Syria had commanded his thirty-two chariot captains to fight no one except King Ahab himself . 32-33 When they saw King Jehoshaphat in his royal robes , they thought , “ That ’ s the man we ’ re after. ” So they wheeled around to attack him . But when Jehoshaphat shouted out to identify himself , [ c ] they turned back !
TLB	1%20Kings	22	34	However , someone shot an arrow at random and it struck King Ahab between the joints of his armor . “ Take me out of the battle , for I am badly wounded , ” he groaned to his chariot driver .
TLB	1%20Kings	22	35	The battle became more and more intense as the day wore on , and King Ahab went back in , propped up in his chariot with the blood from his wound running down onto the floorboards . Finally , toward evening , he died . 36-37 Just as the sun was going down the cry ran through his troops . “ It ’ s all over—return home ! The king is dead ! ” And his body was taken to Samaria and buried there .
TLB	1%20Kings	22	38	When his chariot and armor were washed beside the pool of Samaria , where the prostitutes bathed , dogs came and licked the king ’ s blood just as the Lord had said would happen .
TLB	1%20Kings	22	39	The rest of Ahab ’ s history—including the story of the ivory palace and the cities he built—is written in The Annals of the Kings of Israel .
TLB	1%20Kings	22	40	. -
TLB	1%20Kings	22	41	Meanwhile , over in Judah , Jehoshaphat the son of Asa had become king during the fourth year of the reign of King Ahab of Israel .
TLB	1%20Kings	22	42	Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he ascended the throne , and he reigned in Jerusalem for twenty-five years . His mother was Azubah , the daughter of Shilhi .
TLB	1%20Kings	22	43	He did as his father Asa had done , obeying the Lord in all but one thing : he did not destroy the shrines on the hills , so the people sacrificed and burned incense there .
TLB	1%20Kings	22	44	He also made peace with Ahab , the king of Israel .
TLB	1%20Kings	22	45	The rest of the deeds of Jehoshaphat and his heroic achievements and his wars are described in The Annals of the Kings of Judah .
TLB	1%20Kings	22	46	He also closed all the houses of male prostitution that still continued from the days of his father Asa .
TLB	1%20Kings	22	47	( There was no king in Edom at that time , only a deputy . )
TLB	1%20Kings	22	48	King Jehoshaphat built great freighters to sail to Ophir for gold ; but they never arrived , for they were wrecked at Ezion-geber .
TLB	1%20Kings	22	49	Ahaziah , King Ahab ’ s son and successor , had proposed to Jehoshaphat that his men go , too , but Jehoshaphat had refused the offer .
TLB	1%20Kings	22	50	When King Jehoshaphat died he was buried with his ancestors in Jerusalem , the city of his forefather David ; and his son Jehoram took the throne .
TLB	1%20Kings	22	51	It was during the seventeenth year of the reign of King Jehoshaphat of Judah that Ahaziah , Ahab ’ s son , began to reign over Israel in Samaria ; and he reigned two years . 52-53 But he was not a good king , for he followed in the footsteps of his father and mother and of Jeroboam , who had led Israel into the sin of worshiping idols . So Ahaziah made the Lord God of Israel very angry . Footnotes -

TLB	2%20Kings	1	1	After King Ahab ’ s death the nation of Moab declared its independence and refused to pay tribute to Israel any longer .
TLB	2%20Kings	1	3	But the Angel of the Lord told Elijah the prophet , [ a ] “ Go and meet the messengers and ask them , ‘ Is it true that there is no God in Israel ? Is that why you are going to Baal-zebub , the god of Ekron , to ask whether the king will get well ? 4-5 Because King Ahaziah has done this , the Lord says that he will never leave the bed he is lying on ; he will surely die. ’ ” When Elijah told the messengers this , they returned immediately to the king . “ Why have you returned so soon ? ” he asked them .
TLB	2%20Kings	1	6	“ A man came up to us , ” they said , “ and told us to go back to the king and tell him , ‘ The Lord wants to know why you are asking questions of Baal-zebub , the god of Ekron . Is it because there is no God in Israel ? Now , since you have done this , you will not leave the bed you are lying on ; you will surely die. ’ ”
TLB	2%20Kings	1	7	“ Who was this fellow ? ” the king demanded . “ What did he look like ? ”
TLB	2%20Kings	1	8	“ He was a hairy man , ” they replied , “ with a wide leather belt. ” “ It was Elijah the prophet ! ” the king exclaimed .
TLB	2%20Kings	1	9	Then he sent an army captain with fifty soldiers to arrest him . They found him sitting on top of a hill . The captain said to him , “ O man of God , the king has commanded you to come along with us. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	1	10	But Elijah replied , “ If I am a man of God , let fire come down from heaven and destroy you and your fifty men ! ” Then lightning struck them and killed them all !
TLB	2%20Kings	1	11	So the king sent another captain with fifty men to demand , “ O man of God , the king says that you must come down right away. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	1	12	Elijah replied , “ If I am a man of God , let fire come down from heaven and destroy you and your fifty men. ” And again the fire from God burned them up .
TLB	2%20Kings	1	13	Once more the king sent fifty men , but this time the captain fell to his knees before Elijah and pleaded with him , “ O man of God , please spare my life and the lives of these , your fifty servants .
TLB	2%20Kings	1	14	Have mercy on us ! Don ’ t destroy us as you did the others. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	1	15	Then the Angel of the Lord said to Elijah , “ Don ’ t be afraid . Go with him. ” So Elijah went to the king .
TLB	2%20Kings	1	16	“ Why did you send messengers to Baal-zebub , the god of Ekron , to ask about your sickness ? ” Elijah demanded . “ Is it because there is no God in Israel to ask ? Because you have done this , you shall not leave this bed ; you will surely die. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	1	17	So Ahaziah died as the Lord had predicted through Elijah , and his brother Joram [ b ] became the new king—for Ahaziah did not have a son to succeed him . This occurred in the second year of the reign of King Jehoram ( son of Jehoshaphat ) of Judah .

TLB	2%20Kings	2	3	There the young prophets of Bethel Seminary came out to meet them and asked Elisha , “ Did you know that the Lord is going to take Elijah away from you today ? ” “ Quiet ! ” Elisha snapped . “ Of course I know it. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	2	4	Then Elijah said to Elisha , “ Please stay here in Bethel , for the Lord has sent me to Jericho. ” But Elisha replied again , “ I swear to God that I won ’ t leave you. ” So they went on together to Jericho .
TLB	2%20Kings	2	5	Then the students at Jericho Seminary came to Elisha and asked him , “ Do you know that the Lord is going to take away your master today ? ” “ Will you please be quiet ? ” he commanded . “ Of course I know it ! ” 6-7 Then Elijah said to Elisha , “ Please stay here , for the Lord has sent me to the Jordan River. ” But Elisha replied as before , “ I swear to God that I won ’ t leave you. ” So they went on together and stood beside the Jordan River as fifty of the young prophets watched from a distance .
TLB	2%20Kings	2	8	Then Elijah folded his cloak together and struck the water with it ; and the river divided and they went across on dry ground !
TLB	2%20Kings	2	9	When they arrived on the other side Elijah said to Elisha , “ What wish shall I grant you before I am taken away ? ” And Elisha replied , “ Please grant me twice as much prophetic power as you have had. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	2	10	“ You have asked a hard thing , ” Elijah replied . “ If you see me when I am taken from you , then you will get your request . But if not , then you won ’ t. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	2	11	As they were walking along , talking , suddenly a chariot of fire , drawn by horses of fire , appeared and drove between them , separating them , and Elijah was carried by a whirlwind into heaven .
TLB	2%20Kings	2	12	Elisha saw it and cried out , “ My father ! My father ! The chariot of Israel and the charioteers ! ” As they disappeared from sight he tore his robe . 13-14 Then he picked up Elijah ’ s cloak and returned to the bank of the Jordan River , and struck the water with it . “ Where is the Lord God of Elijah ? ” he cried out . And the water parted and Elisha went across !
TLB	2%20Kings	2	15	When the young prophets of Jericho saw what had happened , they exclaimed , “ The spirit of Elijah rests upon Elisha ! ” And they went to meet him and greeted him respectfully .
TLB	2%20Kings	2	16	“ Sir , ” they said , “ just say the word and fifty of our best athletes will search the wilderness for your master ; perhaps the Spirit of the Lord has left him on some mountain or in some ravine. ” “ No , ” Elisha said , “ don ’ t bother. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	2	17	But they kept urging until he was embarrassed and finally said , “ All right , go ahead. ” Then fifty men searched for three days , but didn ’ t find him .
TLB	2%20Kings	2	18	Elisha was still at Jericho when they returned . “ Didn ’ t I tell you not to go ? ” he growled .
TLB	2%20Kings	2	19	Now a delegation of the city officials of Jericho visited Elisha . “ We have a problem , ” they told him . “ This city is located in beautiful natural surroundings , as you can see ; but the water is bad and causes our women to have miscarriages. ” [ a ]
TLB	2%20Kings	2	20	“ Well , ” he said , “ bring me a new bowl filled with salt. ” So they brought it to him .

TLB	2%20Kings	2	22	And sure enough ! The water was purified , just as Elisha had said .
TLB	2%20Kings	2	23	From Jericho he went to Bethel . As he was walking along the road , a gang of young men from the city began mocking and making fun of him because of his bald head .
TLB	2%20Kings	2	24	He turned around and cursed them in the name of the Lord ; and two female bears came out of the woods and tore forty-two of them .

TLB	2%20Kings	3	4	King Mesha of Moab and his people were sheep ranchers . They paid Israel an annual tribute of 100,000 lambs and the wool of 100,000 rams ;
TLB	2%20Kings	3	5	but after Ahab ’ s death , the king of Moab rebelled against Israel . 6-8 So King Joram mustered the Israeli army and sent this message to King Jehoshaphat of Judah : “ The king of Moab has rebelled against me . Will you help me fight him ? ” “ Of course I will , ” Jehoshaphat replied . “ My people and horses are yours to command . What are your battle plans ? ” “ We ’ ll attack from the wilderness of Edom , ” Joram replied .
TLB	2%20Kings	3	9	So their two armies , now joined also by troops from Edom , moved along a roundabout route through the wilderness for seven days ; but there was no water for the men or their pack animals .
TLB	2%20Kings	3	10	“ Oh , what shall we do ? ” the king of Israel cried out . “ The Lord has brought us here to let the king of Moab defeat us. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	3	11	But Jehoshaphat , the king of Judah , asked , “ Isn ’ t there a prophet of the Lord with us ? If so , we can find out what to do ! ” “ Elisha is here , ” one of the king of Israel ’ s officers replied . Then he added , “ He was Elijah ’ s assistant. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	3	12	“ Fine , ” Jehoshaphat said . “ He ’ s just the man we want. ” [ b ] So the kings of Israel , Judah , and Edom went to consult Elisha .
TLB	2%20Kings	3	13	“ I want no part of you , ” Elisha snarled at King Joram of Israel . “ Go to the false prophets of your father and mother ! ” But King Joram replied , “ No ! For it is the Lord who has called us here to be destroyed by the king of Moab ! ”
TLB	2%20Kings	3	14	“ I swear by the Lord God that I wouldn ’ t bother with you except for the presence of King Jehoshaphat of Judah , ” Elisha replied .
TLB	2%20Kings	3	15	“ Now bring me someone to play the lute. ” And as the lute was played , the message of the Lord came to Elisha :
TLB	2%20Kings	3	16	“ The Lord says to fill this dry valley with trenches to hold the water he will send .
TLB	2%20Kings	3	17	You won ’ t see wind nor rain , but this valley will be filled with water , and you will have plenty for yourselves and for your animals !
TLB	2%20Kings	3	18	But this is only the beginning , for the Lord will make you victorious over the army of Moab !
TLB	2%20Kings	3	19	You will conquer the best of their cities—even those that are fortified—and ruin all the good land with stones. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	3	20	And sure enough , the next day at about the time when the morning sacrifice was offered—look ! Water ! It was flowing from the direction of Edom , and soon there was water everywhere .
TLB	2%20Kings	3	21	Meanwhile , when the people of Moab heard about the three armies marching against them , they mobilized every man who could fight , old and young , and stationed themselves along their frontier .
TLB	2%20Kings	3	22	But early the next morning the sun looked red as it shone across the water !
TLB	2%20Kings	3	23	“ Blood ! ” they exclaimed . “ The three armies have attacked and killed each other ! Let ’ s go and collect the loot ! ”
TLB	2%20Kings	3	24	But when they arrived at the Israeli camp , the army of Israel rushed out and began killing them ; and the army of Moab fled . Then the men of Israel moved forward into the land of Moab , destroying everything as they went .
TLB	2%20Kings	3	25	They destroyed the cities , threw stones on every good piece of land , stopped up the wells , and felled the fruit trees ; finally , only Fort Kir-hareseth was left , but even that finally fell to them . [ c ]
TLB	2%20Kings	3	26	When the king of Moab saw that the battle had been lost , he led
TLB	2%20Kings	3	700	of his swordsmen in a last desperate attempt to break through to the king of Edom ; but he failed .
TLB	2%20Kings	3	27	Then he took his oldest son , who was to have been the next king , and to the horror of the Israeli army , killed him and sacrificed him as a burnt offering upon the wall . So the army of Israel turned back in disgust to their own land . Footnotes -

TLB	2%20Kings	4	4	“ Go into your house with your sons and shut the door behind you . Then pour olive oil from your jar into the pots and pans , setting them aside as they are filled ! ”
TLB	2%20Kings	4	3	“ Then borrow many pots and pans from your friends and neighbors ! ” he instructed .
TLB	2%20Kings	4	5	So she did . Her sons brought the pots and pans to her , and she filled one after another !
TLB	2%20Kings	4	6	Soon every container was full to the brim ! “ Bring me another jar , ” she said to her sons . “ There aren ’ t any more ! ” they told her . And then the oil stopped flowing !
TLB	2%20Kings	4	7	When she told the prophet what had happened , he said to her , “ Go and sell the oil and pay your debt , and there will be enough money left for you and your sons to live on ! ”
TLB	2%20Kings	4	8	One day Elisha went to Shunem . A prominent woman of the city invited him in to eat , and afterwards , whenever he passed that way , he stopped for dinner .
TLB	2%20Kings	4	9	She said to her husband , “ I ’ m sure this man who stops in from time to time is a holy prophet .
TLB	2%20Kings	4	10	Let ’ s make a little room for him on the roof ; we can put in a bed , a table , a chair , and a lamp , and he will have a place to stay whenever he comes by. ” 11-12 Once when he was resting in the room he said to his servant Gehazi , “ Tell the woman I want to speak to her. ” When she came ,
TLB	2%20Kings	4	13	he said to Gehazi , “ Tell her that we appreciate her kindness to us . Now ask her what we can do for her . Does she want me to put in a good word for her to the king or to the general of the army ? ” “ No , ” she replied , “ I am perfectly content. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	4	14	“ What can we do for her ? ” he asked Gehazi afterwards . He suggested , “ She doesn ’ t have a son , and her husband is an old man. ” 15-16 “ Call her back again , ” Elisha told him . When she returned , he talked to her as she stood in the doorway . “ Next year at about this time you shall have a son ! ” “ O man of God , ” she exclaimed , “ don ’ t lie to me like that ! ”
TLB	2%20Kings	4	17	But it was true ; the woman soon conceived and had a baby boy the following year , just as Elisha had predicted .
TLB	2%20Kings	4	18	One day when her child was older , he went out to visit his father , who was working with the reapers .
TLB	2%20Kings	4	19	He complained about a headache and soon was moaning in pain . His father said to one of the servants , “ Carry him home to his mother. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	4	20	So he took him home , and his mother held him on her lap ; but around noontime he died .
TLB	2%20Kings	4	21	She carried him up to the bed of the prophet and shut the door ;
TLB	2%20Kings	4	22	then she sent a message to her husband : “ Send one of the servants and a donkey so that I can hurry to the prophet and come right back. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	4	23	“ Why today ? ” he asked . “ This isn ’ t a religious holiday. ” But she said , “ It ’ s important . I must go. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	4	24	So she saddled the donkey and said to the servant , “ Hurry ! Don ’ t slow down for my comfort unless I tell you to. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	4	25	As she approached Mount Carmel , Elisha saw her in the distance and said to Gehazi , “ Look , that woman from Shunem is coming .
TLB	2%20Kings	4	26	Run and meet her and ask her what the trouble is . See if her husband is all right and if the child is well. ” “ Yes , ” she told Gehazi , “ everything is fine. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	4	27	But when she came to Elisha at the mountain she fell to the ground before him and caught hold of his feet . Gehazi began to push her away , but the prophet said , “ Leave her alone ; something is deeply troubling her and the Lord hasn ’ t told me what it is. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	4	28	Then she said , “ It was you who said I ’ d have a son . And I begged you not to lie to me ! ”
TLB	2%20Kings	4	29	Then he said to Gehazi , “ Quick , take my staff ! Don ’ t talk to anyone along the way . Hurry ! Lay the staff upon the child ’ s face. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	4	30	But the boy ’ s mother said , “ I swear to God that I won ’ t go home without you. ” So Elisha returned with her .
TLB	2%20Kings	4	31	Gehazi went on ahead and laid the staff upon the child ’ s face , but nothing happened . There was no sign of life . He returned to meet Elisha and told him , “ The child is still dead. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	4	32	When Elisha arrived , the child was indeed dead , lying there upon the prophet ’ s bed .
TLB	2%20Kings	4	33	He went in and shut the door behind him and prayed to the Lord .
TLB	2%20Kings	4	34	Then he lay upon the child ’ s body , placing his mouth upon the child ’ s mouth , and his eyes upon the child ’ s eyes , and his hands upon the child ’ s hands . And the child ’ s body began to grow warm again !
TLB	2%20Kings	4	35	Then the prophet went down and walked back and forth in the house a few times ; returning upstairs , he stretched himself again upon the child . This time the little boy sneezed seven times and opened his eyes !
TLB	2%20Kings	4	36	Then the prophet summoned Gehazi . “ Call her ! ” he said . And when she came in , he said , “ Here ’ s your son ! ”
TLB	2%20Kings	4	37	She fell to the floor at his feet and then picked up her son and went out .
TLB	2%20Kings	4	38	Elisha now returned to Gilgal , but there was a famine in the land . One day as he was teaching the young prophets , he said to Gehazi , “ Make some stew for supper for these men. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	4	39	One of the young men went out into the field to gather vegetables and came back with some wild gourds . He shredded them and put them into a kettle without realizing that they were poisonous .
TLB	2%20Kings	4	40	But after the men had eaten a bite or two they cried out , “ Oh , sir , there ’ s poison in this stew ! ”
TLB	2%20Kings	4	41	“ Bring me some meal , ” Elisha said . He threw it into the kettle and said , “ Now it ’ s all right ! Go ahead and eat ! ” And then it didn ’ t harm them .
TLB	2%20Kings	4	42	One day a man from Baal-shalishah brought Elisha a sack of fresh corn [ a ] and twenty individual loaves of barley bread made from the first grain of his harvest . Elisha told Gehazi to use it to feed the young prophets .
TLB	2%20Kings	4	43	“ What ? ” Gehazi exclaimed . “ Feed one hundred men with only this ? ” But Elisha said , “ Go ahead , for the Lord says there will be plenty for all , and some will even be left over ! ”
TLB	2%20Kings	4	44	And sure enough , there was , just as the Lord had said ! Footnotes -

TLB	2%20Kings	5	5	“ Go and visit the prophet , ” the king told him . “ I will send a letter of introduction for you to carry to the king of Israel. ” So Naaman started out , taking gifts of $ 20,000 in silver , $ 60,000 in gold , and ten suits of clothing .
TLB	2%20Kings	5	3	One day the little girl said to her mistress , “ I wish my master would go to see the prophet in Samaria . He would heal him of his leprosy ! ”
TLB	2%20Kings	5	4	Naaman told the king what the little girl had said .
TLB	2%20Kings	5	6	The letter to the king of Israel said : “ The man bringing this letter is my servant Naaman ; I want you to heal him of his leprosy. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	5	7	When the king of Israel read it , he tore his clothes and said , “ This man sends me a leper to heal ! Am I God , that I can kill and give life ? He is only trying to get an excuse to invade us again. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	5	8	But when Elisha the prophet heard about the king of Israel ’ s plight , he sent this message to him : “ Why are you so upset ? Send Naaman to me , and he will learn that there is a true prophet of God here in Israel. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	5	9	So Naaman arrived with his horses and chariots and stood at the door of Elisha ’ s home .
TLB	2%20Kings	5	10	Elisha sent a messenger out to tell him to go and wash in the Jordan River seven times and he would be healed of every trace of his leprosy !
TLB	2%20Kings	5	11	But Naaman was angry and stalked away . “ Look , ” he said , “ I thought at least he would come out and talk to me ! I expected him to wave his hand over the leprosy and call upon the name of the Lord his God and heal me !
TLB	2%20Kings	5	12	Aren ’ t the Abana River and Pharpar River of Damascus better than all the rivers of Israel put together ? If it ’ s rivers I need , I ’ ll wash at home and get rid of my leprosy. ” So he went away in a rage .
TLB	2%20Kings	5	13	But his officers tried to reason with him and said , “ If the prophet had told you to do some great thing , wouldn ’ t you have done it ? So you should certainly obey him when he says simply to go and wash and be cured ! ”
TLB	2%20Kings	5	14	So Naaman went down to the Jordan River and dipped himself seven times , as the prophet had told him to . And his flesh became as healthy as a little child ’ s , and he was healed !
TLB	2%20Kings	5	15	Then he and his entire party went back to find the prophet ; they stood humbly before him and Naaman said , “ I know at last that there is no God in all the world except in Israel ; now please accept my gifts. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	5	16	But Elisha replied , “ I swear by Jehovah my God that I will not accept them. ” Naaman urged him to take them , but he absolutely refused .
TLB	2%20Kings	5	17	“ Well , ” Naaman said , “ all right . But please give me two muleloads of earth to take back with me , for from now on I will never again offer any burnt offerings or sacrifices to any other god except the Lord . [ a ]
TLB	2%20Kings	5	18	However , may the Lord pardon me this one thing—when my master the king goes into the temple of the god Rimmon to worship there and leans on my arm , may the Lord pardon me when I bow too. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	5	19	“ All right , ” Elisha said . So Naaman started home again .
TLB	2%20Kings	5	20	But Gehazi , Elisha ’ s servant , said to himself , “ My master shouldn ’ t have let this fellow get away without taking his gifts . I will chase after him and get something from him. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	5	21	So Gehazi caught up with him . When Naaman saw him coming , he jumped down from his chariot and ran to meet him . “ Is everything all right ? ” he asked .
TLB	2%20Kings	5	22	“ Yes , ” he said , “ but my master has sent me to tell you that two young prophets from the hills of Ephraim have just arrived , and he would like $ 2,000 in silver and two suits to give to them. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	5	23	“ Take $ 4,000 , ” Naaman insisted . He gave him two expensive robes , tied up the money in two bags , and gave them to two of his servants to carry back with Gehazi .
TLB	2%20Kings	5	24	But when they arrived at the hill where Elisha lived , [ b ] Gehazi took the bags from the servants and sent the men back . Then he hid the money in his house .
TLB	2%20Kings	5	25	When he went in to his master , Elisha asked him , “ Where have you been , Gehazi ? ” “ I haven ’ t been anywhere , ” he replied .
TLB	2%20Kings	5	26	But Elisha asked him , “ Don ’ t you realize that I was there in thought when Naaman stepped down from his chariot to meet you ? Is this the time to receive money and clothing and olive farms and vineyards and sheep and oxen and servants ?
TLB	2%20Kings	5	27	Because you have done this , Naaman ’ s leprosy shall be upon you and upon your children and your children ’ s children forever. ” And Gehazi walked from the room a leper , his skin as white as snow . Footnotes -

TLB	2%20Kings	6	6	“ Where did it fall ? ” the prophet asked . The youth showed him the place , and Elisha cut a stick and threw it into the water ; and the axhead rose to the surface and floated !
TLB	2%20Kings	6	3	“ Please , sir , come with us , ” someone suggested . “ I will , ” he said .
TLB	2%20Kings	6	4	When they arrived at the Jordan , they began cutting down trees ;
TLB	2%20Kings	6	5	but as one of them was chopping , his axhead fell into the river . “ Oh , sir , ” he cried , “ it was borrowed ! ”
TLB	2%20Kings	6	7	“ Grab it , ” Elisha said to him ; and he did .
TLB	2%20Kings	6	8	Once when the king of Syria was at war with Israel , he said to his officers , “ We will mobilize our forces at ____ ” ( naming the place ) .
TLB	2%20Kings	6	9	Immediately Elisha warned the king of Israel , “ Don ’ t go near ____ ” ( naming the same place ) “ for the Syrians are planning to mobilize their troops there ! ”
TLB	2%20Kings	6	10	The king sent a scout to see if Elisha was right , and sure enough , he had saved him from disaster . This happened several times .
TLB	2%20Kings	6	11	The king of Syria was puzzled . He called together his officers and demanded , “ Which of you is the traitor ? Who has been informing the king of Israel about my plans ? ”
TLB	2%20Kings	6	12	“ It ’ s not us , sir , ” one of the officers replied . “ Elisha , the prophet , tells the king of Israel even the words you speak in the privacy of your bedroom ! ”
TLB	2%20Kings	6	13	“ Go and find out where he is , and we ’ ll send troops to seize him , ” the king exclaimed . And the report came back , “ Elisha is at Dothan. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	6	14	So one night the king of Syria sent a great army with many chariots and horses to surround the city .
TLB	2%20Kings	6	15	When the prophet ’ s servant got up early the next morning and went outside , there were troops , horses , and chariots everywhere . “ Alas , my master , what shall we do now ? ” he cried out to Elisha .
TLB	2%20Kings	6	16	“ Don ’ t be afraid ! ” Elisha told him . “ For our army is bigger than theirs ! ”
TLB	2%20Kings	6	17	Then Elisha prayed , “ Lord , open his eyes and let him see ! ” And the Lord opened the young man ’ s eyes so that he could see horses of fire and chariots of fire everywhere upon the mountain !
TLB	2%20Kings	6	18	As the Syrian army advanced upon them , Elisha prayed , “ Lord , please make them blind. ” And he did .
TLB	2%20Kings	6	19	Then Elisha went out and told them , “ You ’ ve come the wrong way ! This isn ’ t the right city ! Follow me and I will take you to the man you ’ re looking for. ” And he led them to Samaria !
TLB	2%20Kings	6	20	As soon as they arrived Elisha prayed , “ Lord , now open their eyes and let them see. ” And the Lord did , and they discovered that they were in Samaria , the capital city of Israel !
TLB	2%20Kings	6	21	When the king of Israel saw them , he shouted to Elisha , “ Oh , sir , shall I kill them ? Shall I kill them ? ”
TLB	2%20Kings	6	22	“ Of course not ! ” Elisha told him . “ Do we kill prisoners of war ? Give them food and drink and send them home again. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	6	23	So the king made a great feast for them and then sent them home to their king . And after that the Syrian raiders stayed away from the land of Israel .
TLB	2%20Kings	6	24	Later on , however , King Ben-hadad of Syria mustered his entire army and besieged Samaria .
TLB	2%20Kings	6	25	As a result there was a great famine in the city , and after a long while even a donkey ’ s head sold for fifty dollars and a pint of dove ’ s dung brought three dollars ! 26-30 One day as the king of Israel was walking along the wall of the city , a woman called to him , “ Help , my lord the king ! ” “ If the Lord doesn ’ t help you , what can I do ? ” he retorted . “ I have neither food nor wine to give you . However , what ’ s the matter ? ” She replied , “ This woman proposed that we eat my son one day and her son the next . So we boiled my son and ate him , but the next day when I said , ‘ Kill your son so we can eat him , ’ she hid him. ” When the king heard this he tore his clothes . ( The people watching noticed through the rip he tore in them that he was wearing an inner robe made of sackcloth next to his flesh . )
TLB	2%20Kings	6	31	“ May God kill me if I don ’ t execute Elisha this very day , ” the king vowed .
TLB	2%20Kings	6	32	Elisha was sitting in his house at a meeting with the elders of Israel when the king sent a messenger to summon him . But before the messenger arrived Elisha said to the elders , “ This murderer has sent a man to kill me . When he arrives , shut the door and keep him out , for his master will soon follow him. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	6	33	While Elisha was still saying this , the messenger arrived followed by the king . [ a ] “ The Lord has caused this mess , ” the king stormed . “ Why should I expect any help from him ? ” Footnotes -

TLB	2%20Kings	7	2	The officer assisting the king said , “ That couldn ’ t happen if the Lord made windows in the sky ! ” But Elisha replied , “ You will see it happen , but you won ’ t be able to buy any of it ! ”
TLB	2%20Kings	7	7	So they panicked and fled into the night , abandoning their tents , horses , donkeys , and everything else . )
TLB	2%20Kings	7	3	Now there were four lepers sitting outside the city gates . “ Why sit here until we die ? ” they asked each other .
TLB	2%20Kings	7	4	“ We will starve if we stay here and we will starve if we go back into the city ; so we might as well go out and surrender to the Syrian army . If they let us live , so much the better ; but if they kill us , we would have died anyway. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	7	5	So that evening they went out to the camp of the Syrians , but there was no one there !
TLB	2%20Kings	7	6	( For the Lord had made the whole Syrian army hear the clatter of speeding chariots and a loud galloping of horses and the sounds of a great army approaching . “ The king of Israel has hired the Hittites and Egyptians to attack us , ” they cried out .
TLB	2%20Kings	7	8	When the lepers arrived at the edge of the camp they went into one tent after another , eating , drinking wine , and carrying out silver and gold and clothing and hiding it .
TLB	2%20Kings	7	9	Finally they said to each other , “ This isn ’ t right . This is wonderful news , and we aren ’ t sharing it with anyone ! Even if we wait until morning , some terrible calamity will certainly fall upon us ; come on , let ’ s go back and tell the people at the palace. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	7	10	So they went back to the city and told the watchmen what had happened—they had gone out to the Syrian camp and no one was there ! The horses and donkeys were tethered and the tents were all in order , but there was not a soul around .
TLB	2%20Kings	7	11	Then the watchmen shouted the news to those in the palace .
TLB	2%20Kings	7	12	The king got out of bed and told his officers , “ I know what has happened . The Syrians know we are starving , so they have left their camp and have hidden in the fields , thinking that we will be lured out of the city . Then they will attack us and make slaves of us and get in. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	7	13	One of his officers replied , “ We ’ d better send out scouts to see . Let them take five of the remaining horses—if something happens to the animals it won ’ t be any greater loss than if they stay here and die with the rest of us ! ”
TLB	2%20Kings	7	14	Four chariot horses were found and the king sent out two charioteers to see where the Syrians had gone .
TLB	2%20Kings	7	15	They followed a trail of clothing and equipment all the way to the Jordan River—thrown away by the Syrians in their haste . The scouts returned and told the king ,
TLB	2%20Kings	7	16	and the people of Samaria rushed out and plundered the camp of the Syrians . So it was true that two gallons of flour and four gallons of barley were sold that day for one dollar , just as the Lord had said !
TLB	2%20Kings	7	17	The king appointed his special assistant to control the traffic at the gate , but he was knocked down and trampled and killed as the people rushed out . This is what Elisha had predicted on the previous day when the king had come to arrest him ,
TLB	2%20Kings	7	18	and the prophet had told the king that flour and barley would sell for so little on the following day .
TLB	2%20Kings	7	19	The king ’ s officer had replied , “ That couldn ’ t happen even if the Lord opened the windows of heaven ! ” And the prophet had said , “ You will see it happen , but you won ’ t be able to buy any of it ! ”
TLB	2%20Kings	7	20	And he couldn ’ t , for the people trampled him to death at the gate ! The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	2%20Kings	8	8	Elisha had told the woman whose son he had brought back to life , “ Take your family and move to some other country , for the Lord has called down a famine on Israel that will last for seven years. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	8	3	After the famine ended , she returned to the land of Israel and went to see the king about getting back her house and land .
TLB	2%20Kings	8	4	Just as she came in , the king was talking with Gehazi , Elisha ’ s servant , and saying , “ Tell me some stories of the great things Elisha has done. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	8	5	And Gehazi was telling the king about the time when Elisha brought a little boy back to life . At that very moment , the mother of the boy walked in ! “ Oh , sir ! ” Gehazi exclaimed . “ Here is the woman now , and this is her son—the very one Elisha brought back to life ! ”
TLB	2%20Kings	8	6	“ Is this true ? ” the king asked her . And she told him that it was . So he directed one of his officials to see to it that everything she had owned was restored to her , plus the value of any crops that had been harvested during her absence .
TLB	2%20Kings	8	7	Afterwards Elisha went to Damascus ( the capital of Syria ) , where King Ben-hadad lay sick . Someone told the king that the prophet had come . 8-9 When the king heard the news , he said to Hazael , “ Take a present to the man of God and tell him to ask the Lord whether I will get well again. ” So Hazael took forty camel-loads of the best produce of the land as presents for Elisha and said to him , “ Your son Ben-hadad , the king of Syria , has sent me to ask you whether he will recover. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	8	10	And Elisha replied , “ Tell him , ‘ Yes. ’ But the Lord has shown me that he will surely die ! ”
TLB	2%20Kings	8	11	Elisha stared at Hazael until he became embarrassed , and then Elisha started crying .
TLB	2%20Kings	8	12	“ What ’ s the matter , sir ? ” Hazael asked him . Elisha replied , “ I know the terrible things you will do to the people of Israel : you will burn their forts , kill the young men , dash their babies against the rocks , and rip open the bellies of the pregnant women ! ”
TLB	2%20Kings	8	13	“ Am I a dog ? ” Hazael asked him . “ I would never do that sort of thing. ” But Elisha replied , “ The Lord has shown me that you are going to be the king of Syria. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	8	14	When Hazael went back , the king asked him , “ What did he tell you ? ” And Hazael replied , “ He told me that you would recover. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	8	15	But the next day Hazael took a blanket and dipped it in water and held it over the king ’ s face until he smothered to death . And Hazael became king instead .
TLB	2%20Kings	8	16	King Jehoram , the son of King Jehoshaphat of Judah , began his reign during the fifth year of the reign of King Joram of Israel , the son of Ahab .
TLB	2%20Kings	8	17	Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king , and he reigned in Jerusalem for eight years .
TLB	2%20Kings	8	18	But he was as wicked as Ahab and the other kings of Israel ; he even married one of Ahab ’ s daughters .
TLB	2%20Kings	8	19	Nevertheless , because God had promised his servant David that he would watch over and guide his descendants , he did not destroy Judah .
TLB	2%20Kings	8	20	During Jehoram ’ s reign , the people in Edom revolted from Judah and appointed their own king .
TLB	2%20Kings	8	21	King Jehoram [ a ] tried unsuccessfully to crush the rebellion : he crossed the Jordan River and attacked the city of Zair , but was quickly surrounded by the army of Edom . Under cover of night he broke through their ranks , but his army deserted him and fled .
TLB	2%20Kings	8	22	So Edom has maintained its independence to this day . Libnah also rebelled at that time .

TLB	2%20Kings	8	26	Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he began to reign , but he reigned only one year in Jerusalem . His mother was Athaliah , the granddaughter of King Omri of Israel .
TLB	2%20Kings	8	27	He was an evil king , just as all of King Ahab ’ s descendants were—for he was related to Ahab by marriage .
TLB	2%20Kings	8	28	He joined King Joram of Israel ( son of Ahab ) in his war against Hazael , the king of Syria , at Ramoth-gilead . King Joram was wounded in the battle ,
TLB	2%20Kings	8	29	so he went to Jezreel to rest and recover from his wounds . While he was there , King Ahaziah of Judah ( son of Jehoram ) came to visit him . Footnotes -

TLB	2%20Kings	9	2	Kings 9:29 twelfth year , implied in 8:25 ; literally , “ eleventh. ” The Living Bible copyright ©
TLB	2%20Kings	9	9	I will destroy the family of Ahab as I destroyed the families of Jeroboam ( son of Nebat ) and of Baasha ( son of Ahijah ) .
TLB	2%20Kings	9	3	and pour the oil over his head . Tell him that the Lord has anointed him to be the king of Israel ; then run for your life ! ”
TLB	2%20Kings	9	4	So the young prophet did as he was told . When he arrived in Ramoth-gilead ,
TLB	2%20Kings	9	5	he found Jehu sitting around with the other army officers . “ I have a message for you , sir , ” he said . “ For which one of us ? ” Jehu asked . “ For you , ” he replied .
TLB	2%20Kings	9	6	So Jehu left the others and went into the house , and the young man poured the oil over his head and said , “ The Lord God of Israel says , ‘ I anoint you king of the Lord ’ s people , Israel .
TLB	2%20Kings	9	7	You are to destroy the family of Ahab ; you will avenge the murder of my prophets and of all my other people who were killed by Jezebel .
TLB	2%20Kings	9	8	The entire family of Ahab must be wiped out—every male , no matter who .
TLB	2%20Kings	9	10	Dogs shall eat Ahab ’ s wife Jezebel at Jezreel , and no one will bury her. ’ ” Then he opened the door and ran .
TLB	2%20Kings	9	11	Jehu went back to his friends and one of them asked him , “ What did that crazy fellow want ? Is everything all right ? ” “ You know very well who he was and what he wanted , ” Jehu replied .
TLB	2%20Kings	9	12	“ No , we don ’ t , ” they said . “ Tell us. ” So he told them what the man had said and that he had been anointed king of Israel !
TLB	2%20Kings	9	13	They quickly carpeted the bare steps with their coats and blew a trumpet , shouting , “ Jehu is king ! ”
TLB	2%20Kings	9	14	That is how Jehu ( son of Jehoshaphat , son of Nimshi ) rebelled against King Joram . ( King Joram had been with the army at Ramoth-gilead , defending Israel against the forces of King Hazael of Syria .
TLB	2%20Kings	9	15	But he had returned to Jezreel to recover from his wounds . ) “ Since you want me to be king , ” Jehu told the men who were with him , “ don ’ t let anyone escape to Jezreel to report what we have done. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	9	16	Then Jehu jumped into a chariot and rode to Jezreel himself to find King Joram , who was lying there wounded . ( King Ahaziah of Judah was there too , for he had gone to visit him . )
TLB	2%20Kings	9	17	The watchman on the Tower of Jezreel saw Jehu and his company approaching and shouted , “ Someone is coming. ” “ Send out a rider and find out if he is friend or foe , ” King Joram shouted back .
TLB	2%20Kings	9	18	So a soldier rode out to meet Jehu . “ The king wants to know whether you are friend or foe , ” he demanded . “ Do you come in peace ? ” Jehu replied , “ What do you know about peace ? Get behind me ! ” The watchman called out to the king that the messenger had met them but was not returning .
TLB	2%20Kings	9	19	So the king sent out a second rider . He rode up to them and demanded in the name of the king to know whether their intentions were friendly or not . Jehu answered , “ What do you know about friendliness ? Get behind me ! ”
TLB	2%20Kings	9	20	“ He isn ’ t returning either ! ” the watchman exclaimed . “ It must be Jehu , for he is driving so furiously. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	9	21	“ Quick ! Get my chariot ready ! ” King Joram commanded . Then he and King Ahaziah of Judah rode out to meet Jehu . They met him at the field of Naboth ,
TLB	2%20Kings	9	22	and King Joram demanded , “ Do you come as a friend , Jehu ? ” Jehu replied , “ How can there be friendship as long as the evils of your mother Jezebel are all around us ? ”
TLB	2%20Kings	9	23	Then King Joram reined the chariot horses around and fled , shouting to King Ahaziah , “ There is treachery , Ahaziah ! Treason ! ”
TLB	2%20Kings	9	24	Then Jehu drew his bow with his full strength and shot Joram between the shoulders ; and the arrow pierced his heart , and he sank down dead in his chariot .
TLB	2%20Kings	9	25	Jehu said to Bidkar , his assistant , “ Throw him into the field of Naboth , for once when you and I were riding along behind his father Ahab , the Lord revealed this prophecy to me :
TLB	2%20Kings	9	26	‘ I will repay him here on Naboth ’ s property for the murder of Naboth and his sons. ’ So throw him out on Naboth ’ s field , just as the Lord said. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	9	27	Meanwhile , King Ahaziah of Judah had fled along the road to Beth-haggan . Jehu rode after him , shouting , “ Shoot him too. ” So they shot him in his chariot at the place where the road climbs to Gur , near Ibleam . He was able to go on as far as Megiddo , but died there .
TLB	2%20Kings	9	28	His officials took him by chariot to Jerusalem where they buried him in the royal cemetery .
TLB	2%20Kings	9	29	( Ahaziah ’ s reign over Judah had begun in the twelfth year [ a ] of the reign of King Joram of Israel . )
TLB	2%20Kings	9	30	When Jezebel heard that Jehu had come to Jezreel , she painted her eyelids and fixed her hair and sat at a window .
TLB	2%20Kings	9	31	When Jehu entered the gate of the palace , she shouted at him , “ How are you today , you murderer ! You son of a Zimri who murdered his master ! ”
TLB	2%20Kings	9	32	He looked up and saw her at the window and shouted , “ Who is on my side ? ” And two or three eunuchs looked out at him .
TLB	2%20Kings	9	33	“ Throw her down ! ” he yelled . So they threw her out the window , and her blood spattered against the wall and on the horses ; and she was trampled by the horses ’ hoofs .
TLB	2%20Kings	9	34	Then Jehu went into the palace for lunch . Afterwards he said , “ Someone go and bury this cursed woman , for she is the daughter of a king. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	9	35	But when they went out to bury her , they found only her skull , her feet , and her hands .
TLB	2%20Kings	9	36	When they returned and told him , he remarked , “ That is just what the Lord said would happen . He told Elijah the prophet that dogs would eat her flesh
TLB	2%20Kings	9	37	and that her body would be scattered like manure upon the field , so that no one could tell whose it was. ” Footnotes -

TLB	2%20Kings	10	2	Kings 10:13 brothers , literally , “ kinsmen. ” The Living Bible copyright ©
TLB	2%20Kings	10	10	Then Jehu wrote a letter to the city council of Samaria and to the guardians of Ahab ’ s seventy sons—all of whom were living there . 2-3 “ Upon receipt of this letter , select the best one of Ahab ’ s sons to be your king , and prepare to fight for his throne . For you have chariots and horses and a fortified city and an armory. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	10	4	But they were too frightened to do it . “ Two kings couldn ’ t stand against this man ! What can we do ? ” they said .
TLB	2%20Kings	10	5	So the manager of palace affairs and the city manager , together with the city council and the guardians of Ahab ’ s sons , sent him this message : “ Jehu , we are your servants and will do anything you tell us to . We have decided that you should be our king instead of one of Ahab ’ s sons. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	10	6	Jehu responded with this message : “ If you are on my side and are going to obey me , bring the heads of your master ’ s sons to me at Jezreel at about this time tomorrow. ” ( These seventy sons of King Ahab were living in the homes of the chief men of the city , where they had been raised since childhood . )
TLB	2%20Kings	10	7	When the letter arrived , all seventy of them were murdered , and their heads were packed into baskets and presented to Jehu at Jezreel .
TLB	2%20Kings	10	8	When a messenger told Jehu that the heads of the king ’ s sons had arrived , he said to pile them in two heaps at the entrance of the city gate , and to leave them there until the next morning . 9-10 In the morning he went out and spoke to the crowd that had gathered around them . “ You aren ’ t to blame , ” he told them . “ I conspired against my master and killed him , but I didn ’ t kill his sons ! The Lord has done that , for everything he says comes true . He declared through his servant Elijah that this would happen to Ahab ’ s descendants. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	10	11	Jehu then killed all the rest of the members of the family of Ahab who were in Jezreel , as well as all of his important officials , personal friends , and private chaplains . Finally , no one was left who had been close to him in any way . [ a ]
TLB	2%20Kings	10	12	Then he set out for Samaria and stayed overnight at a shepherd ’ s inn along the way .
TLB	2%20Kings	10	13	While he was there he met the brothers of King Ahaziah of Judah . “ Who are you ? ” he asked them . And they replied , “ We are brothers [ b ] of King Ahaziah . We are going to Samaria to visit the sons of King Ahab and of the Queen Mother , Jezebel. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	10	14	“ Grab them ! ” Jehu shouted to his men . And he took them out to the cistern and killed all forty-two of them .
TLB	2%20Kings	10	15	As he left the inn , he met Jehonadab , the son of Rechab , who was coming to meet him . After they had greeted each other , Jehu said to him , “ Are you as loyal to me as I am to you ? ” “ Yes , ” Jehonadab replied . “ Then give me your hand , ” Jehu said , and he helped him into the royal chariot .
TLB	2%20Kings	10	16	“ Now come along with me , ” Jehu said , “ and see how much I have done for the Lord. ” So Jehonadab rode along with him .
TLB	2%20Kings	10	17	When he arrived in Samaria he butchered all of Ahab ’ s friends and relatives , just as Elijah , speaking for the Lord , had predicted . Then Jehu called a meeting of all the people of the city and said to them , “ Ahab hardly worshiped Baal at all in comparison to the way I am going to ! 18-19 Summon all the prophets and priests of Baal , and call together all his worshipers . See to it that every one of them comes , for we worshipers of Baal are going to have a great celebration to praise him . Any of Baal ’ s worshipers who don ’ t come will be put to death. ” But Jehu ’ s plan was to exterminate them . 20-21 He sent messengers throughout all Israel summoning those who worshiped Baal ; and they all came and filled the temple of Baal from one end to the other .
TLB	2%20Kings	10	22	He instructed the head of the robing room , “ Be sure that every worshiper wears one of the special robes. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	10	23	Then Jehu and Jehonadab ( son of Rechab ) went into the temple to address the people : “ Check to be sure that only those who worship Baal are here ; don ’ t let anyone in who worships the Lord ! ”
TLB	2%20Kings	10	24	As the priests of Baal began offering sacrifices and burnt offerings , Jehu surrounded the building with eighty of his men and told them , “ If you let anyone escape , you ’ ll pay for it with your own life. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	10	25	As soon as he had finished sacrificing the burnt offering , Jehu went out and told his officers and men , “ Go in and kill the whole bunch of them . Don ’ t let a single one escape. ” So they slaughtered them all and dragged their bodies outside . Then Jehu ’ s men went into the inner temple ,
TLB	2%20Kings	10	26	dragged out the pillar used for the worship of Baal , and burned it .
TLB	2%20Kings	10	27	They wrecked the temple and converted it into a public toilet , which it still is today .
TLB	2%20Kings	10	28	Thus Jehu destroyed every trace of Baal from Israel .
TLB	2%20Kings	10	29	However , he didn ’ t destroy the gold calves at Bethel and Dan—this was the great sin of Jeroboam ( son of Nebat ) , for it resulted in all Israel sinning .
TLB	2%20Kings	10	30	Afterwards the Lord said to Jehu , “ You have done well in following my instructions to destroy the dynasty of Ahab . Because of this I will cause your son , your grandson , and your great-grandson to be the kings of Israel. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	10	31	But Jehu didn ’ t follow the Lord God of Israel with all his heart , for he continued to worship Jeroboam ’ s gold calves that had been the cause of such great sin in Israel . 32-33 At about that time the Lord began to whittle down the size of Israel . King Hazael conquered several sections of the country east of the Jordan River , as well as all of Gilead , Gad , and Reuben ; he also conquered parts of Manasseh from the Aroer River in the valley of the Arnon as far as Gilead and Bashan .
TLB	2%20Kings	10	34	The rest of Jehu ’ s activities are recorded in The Annals of the Kings of Israel .
TLB	2%20Kings	10	35	When Jehu died , he was buried in Samaria ; and his son Jehoahaz became the new king .
TLB	2%20Kings	10	36	In all , Jehu reigned as king of Israel , in Samaria , for twenty-eight years . Footnotes -

TLB	2%20Kings	11	2	Kings 11:4 the priest , implied . The Living Bible copyright ©
TLB	2%20Kings	11	11	The guards , with weapons ready , stood across the front of the sanctuary and surrounded the altar , which was near Joash ’ s hideaway .
TLB	2%20Kings	11	4	In the seventh year of Queen Athaliah ’ s reign , Jehoiada the priest [ b ] summoned the officers of the palace guard and the queen ’ s bodyguard . He met them in the Temple , swore them to secrecy , and showed them the king ’ s son .
TLB	2%20Kings	11	5	Then he gave them their instructions : “ A third of those who are on duty on the Sabbath are to guard the palace . 6-8 The other two-thirds shall stand guard at the Temple ; surround the king , weapons in hand , and kill anyone who tries to break through . Stay with the king at all times. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	11	9	So the officers followed Jehoiada ’ s instructions . They brought to Jehoiada the men who were going off duty on the Sabbath and those who were coming on duty ,
TLB	2%20Kings	11	10	and he armed them from the Temple ’ s supply of spears and shields that had belonged to King David .
TLB	2%20Kings	11	12	Then Jehoiada brought out the young prince and put the crown upon his head and gave him a copy of the Ten Commandments , and anointed him as king . Then everyone clapped and shouted , “ Long live the king ! ” 13-14 When Athaliah heard all the noise , she ran into the Temple and saw the new king standing beside the pillar , as was the custom at times of coronation , surrounded by her bodyguard and many trumpeters ; and everyone was rejoicing and blowing trumpets . “ Treason ! Treason ! ” she screamed , and began to tear her clothes .
TLB	2%20Kings	11	15	“ Get her out of here , ” shouted Jehoiada to the officers of the guard . “ Don ’ t kill her here in the Temple . But kill anyone who tries to come to her rescue. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	11	16	So they dragged her to the palace stables and killed her there .
TLB	2%20Kings	11	17	Jehoiada made a treaty between the Lord , the king , and the people , that they would be the Lord ’ s people . He also made a contract between the king and the people .
TLB	2%20Kings	11	18	Everyone went over to the temple of Baal and tore it down , breaking the altars and images and killing Mattan , the priest of Baal , in front of the altar . And Jehoiada set guards at the Temple of the Lord .
TLB	2%20Kings	11	19	Then he and the officers and the guard and all the people led the king from the Temple , past the guardhouse , and into the palace . And he sat upon the king ’ s throne .
TLB	2%20Kings	11	20	So everyone was happy , and the city settled back into quietness after Athaliah ’ s death .

TLB	2%20Kings	12	2	Kings 12:21 both trusted aides , literally , “ his servants. ” The Living Bible copyright ©
TLB	2%20Kings	12	12	It was seven years after Jehu had become the king of Israel that Joash became king of Judah . He reigned in Jerusalem for forty years . ( His mother was Zibiah , from Beersheba . )
TLB	2%20Kings	12	3	Yet even so he didn ’ t destroy the shrines on the hills—the people still sacrificed and burned incense there . 4-5 One day King Joash said to Jehoiada , “ The Temple building needs repairing . Whenever anyone brings a contribution to the Lord , whether it is a regular assessment or some special gift , use it to pay for whatever repairs are needed. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	12	6	But in the twenty-third year of his reign the Temple was still in disrepair .
TLB	2%20Kings	12	7	So Joash called for Jehoiada and the other priests and asked them , “ Why haven ’ t you done anything about the Temple ? Now don ’ t use any more money for your own needs ; from now on it must all be spent on getting the Temple into good condition. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	12	8	So the priests agreed to set up a special repair fund that would not go through their hands , lest it be diverted to care for their personal needs .
TLB	2%20Kings	12	9	Jehoiada the priest bored a hole in the lid of a large chest and set it on the right-hand side of the altar at the Temple entrance . The doorkeepers put all of the people ’ s contributions into it .
TLB	2%20Kings	12	10	Whenever the chest became full , the king ’ s financial secretary and the High Priest counted it , put it into bags , 11-12 and gave it to the construction superintendents to pay the carpenters , stonemasons , quarrymen , timber dealers , and stone merchants , and to buy the other materials needed to repair the Temple of the Lord . 13-14 It was not used to buy silver cups , gold snuffers , bowls , trumpets , or similar articles , but only for repairs to the building .
TLB	2%20Kings	12	15	No accounting was required from the construction superintendents , for they were honest and faithful men .
TLB	2%20Kings	12	16	However , the money that was contributed for guilt offerings and sin offerings was given to the priests for their own use . It was not put into the chest .
TLB	2%20Kings	12	17	About this time , King Hazael of Syria went to war against Gath and captured it ; then he moved on toward Jerusalem to attack it .
TLB	2%20Kings	12	18	King Joash took all the sacred objects that his ancestors—Jehoshaphat , Jehoram , and Ahaziah , the kings of Judah—had dedicated , along with what he himself had dedicated , and all the gold in the treasuries of the Temple and the palace , and sent it to Hazael . So Hazael called off the attack .
TLB	2%20Kings	12	19	The rest of the history of Joash is recorded in The Annals of the Kings of Judah .
TLB	2%20Kings	12	20	But his officers plotted against him and assassinated him in his royal residence at Millo on the road to Silla .
TLB	2%20Kings	12	21	The assassins were Jozachar , the son of Shimeath , and Jehozabad , the son of Shomer—both trusted aides . [ a ] He was buried in the royal cemetery in Jerusalem , and his son Amaziah became the new king . Footnotes -

TLB	2%20Kings	13	2	Kings 13:25 of Israel , implied . The Living Bible copyright ©
TLB	2%20Kings	13	13	Joash died and was buried in Samaria with the other kings of Israel ; and Jeroboam II became the new king .
TLB	2%20Kings	13	3	So the Lord was very angry with Israel , and he continually allowed King Hazael of Syria and his son Ben-hadad to conquer them .
TLB	2%20Kings	13	4	But Jehoahaz prayed for the Lord ’ s help , and the Lord listened to him ; for the Lord saw how terribly the king of Syria was oppressing Israel .
TLB	2%20Kings	13	5	So the Lord raised up leaders among the Israelis to rescue them from the tyranny of the Syrians ; and then Israel lived in safety again as they had in former days .
TLB	2%20Kings	13	6	But they continued to sin , following the evil ways of Jeroboam ; and they continued to worship the goddess Asherah at Samaria .
TLB	2%20Kings	13	7	Finally the Lord reduced Jehoahaz ’ s army to fifty mounted troops , ten chariots , and ten thousand infantry ; for the king of Syria had destroyed the others as though they were dust beneath his feet .
TLB	2%20Kings	13	8	The rest of the history of Jehoahaz is recorded in The Annals of the Kings of Israel . 9-10 Jehoahaz died and was buried in Samaria , and his son Joash reigned in Samaria for sixteen years . He came to the throne in the thirty-seventh year of the reign of King Joash of Judah .
TLB	2%20Kings	13	11	But he was an evil man , for , like Jeroboam , he encouraged the people to worship idols and led them into sin .
TLB	2%20Kings	13	12	The rest of the history of the reign of Joash , including his wars against King Amaziah of Judah , are written in The Annals of the Kings of Israel .
TLB	2%20Kings	13	14	When Elisha was in his last illness , King Joash visited him and wept over him . “ My father ! My father ! You are the strength of Israel ! ” [ a ] he cried .
TLB	2%20Kings	13	15	Elisha told him , “ Get a bow and some arrows , ” and he did . 16-17 “ Open that eastern window , ” he instructed . Then he told the king to put his hand upon the bow , and Elisha laid his own hands upon the king ’ s hands . “ Shoot ! ” Elisha commanded , and he did . Then Elisha proclaimed , “ This is the Lord ’ s arrow , full of victory over Syria ; for you will completely conquer the Syrians at Aphek .
TLB	2%20Kings	13	18	Now pick up the other arrows and strike them against the floor. ” So the king picked them up and struck the floor three times .
TLB	2%20Kings	13	19	But the prophet was angry with him . “ You should have struck the floor five or six times , ” he exclaimed , “ for then you would have beaten Syria until they were entirely destroyed ; now you will be victorious only three times. ” 20-21 So Elisha died and was buried . In those days bandit gangs of Moabites used to invade the land each spring . Once some men who were burying a friend spied these marauders so they hastily threw his body into the tomb of Elisha . And as soon as the body touched Elisha ’ s bones , the dead man revived and jumped to his feet !
TLB	2%20Kings	13	22	King Hazael of Syria had oppressed Israel during the entire reign of King Jehoahaz .
TLB	2%20Kings	13	23	But the Lord was gracious to the people of Israel , and they were not totally destroyed . For God pitied them , and also he was honoring his contract with Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob . And this is still true .
TLB	2%20Kings	13	24	Then King Hazael of Syria died , and his son Ben-hadad reigned in his place .
TLB	2%20Kings	13	25	King Joash of Israel [ b ] ( the son of Jehoahaz ) was successful on three occasions in reconquering the cities that his father had lost to Ben-hadad . Footnotes -

TLB	2%20Kings	14	2	Amaziah was twenty-five years old at the time , and he reigned in Jerusalem for twenty-nine years . ( His mother was Jehoaddin , a native of Jerusalem . )
TLB	2%20Kings	14	14	King Joash took many hostages and all the gold and silver from the Temple and palace treasury , also the gold cups . Then he returned to Samaria .
TLB	2%20Kings	14	3	He was a good king in the Lord ’ s sight , though not quite like his ancestor David ; but he was as good a king as his father Joash .
TLB	2%20Kings	14	4	However , he didn ’ t destroy the shrines on the hills , so the people still sacrificed and burned incense there .
TLB	2%20Kings	14	5	As soon as he had a firm grip on the kingdom , he killed the men who had assassinated his father ;
TLB	2%20Kings	14	6	but he didn ’ t kill their children , for the Lord had commanded through the law of Moses that fathers shall not be killed for their children , nor children for the sins of their fathers : everyone must pay the penalty for his own sins .
TLB	2%20Kings	14	7	Once Amaziah killed ten thousand Edomites in Salt Valley ; he also conquered Sela and changed its name to Joktheel , as it is called to this day .
TLB	2%20Kings	14	8	One day he sent a message to King Joash of Israel ( the son of Jehoahaz and the grandson of Jehu ) , daring him to mobilize his army and come out and fight .
TLB	2%20Kings	14	9	But King Joash replied , “ The thistle of Lebanon demanded of the mighty cedar tree , ‘ Give your daughter to be a wife for my son. ’ But just then a wild animal passed by and stepped on the thistle and trod it into the ground !
TLB	2%20Kings	14	10	You have destroyed Edom and are very proud about it ; but my advice to you is , be content with your glory and stay home ! Why provoke disaster for both yourself and Judah ? ”
TLB	2%20Kings	14	11	But Amaziah refused to listen , so King Joash of Israel mustered his army . The battle began at Beth-shemesh , one of the cities of Judah ,
TLB	2%20Kings	14	12	and Judah was defeated and the army fled home .
TLB	2%20Kings	14	13	King Amaziah was captured , and the army of Israel marched on Jerusalem and broke down its wall from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate , a distance of about six hundred feet .
TLB	2%20Kings	14	15	The rest of the history of Joash and his war with King Amaziah of Judah are recorded in The Annals of the Kings of Israel .
TLB	2%20Kings	14	16	When Joash died , he was buried in Samaria with the other kings of Israel . And his son Jeroboam became the new king .
TLB	2%20Kings	14	17	Amaziah lived fifteen years longer than Joash ,
TLB	2%20Kings	14	18	and the rest of his biography is recorded in The Annals of the Kings of Judah .
TLB	2%20Kings	14	19	There was a plot against his life in Jerusalem , and he fled to Lachish ; but his enemies sent assassins and killed him there .
TLB	2%20Kings	14	20	His body was returned on horses , and he was buried in the royal cemetery , in the City of David section of Jerusalem .
TLB	2%20Kings	14	21	Then his son Azariah became the new king at the age of sixteen .
TLB	2%20Kings	14	22	After his father ’ s death , he built Elath and restored it to Judah .
TLB	2%20Kings	14	23	Meanwhile , over in Israel , Jeroboam II had become king during the fifteenth year of the reign of King Amaziah of Judah . Jeroboam ’ s reign lasted forty-one years .
TLB	2%20Kings	14	24	But he was as evil as Jeroboam I ( the son of Nebat ) , who had led Israel into the sin of worshiping idols .
TLB	2%20Kings	14	25	Jeroboam II recovered the lost territories of Israel between Hamath and the Dead Sea , just as the Lord God of Israel had predicted through Jonah ( son of Amittai ) the prophet from Gathhepher .
TLB	2%20Kings	14	26	For the Lord saw the bitter plight of Israel—she had no one to help her .
TLB	2%20Kings	14	27	And he had not said that he would blot out the name of Israel , so he used King Jeroboam II to save her .
TLB	2%20Kings	14	28	The rest of Jeroboam ’ s biography—all that he did , and his great power , and his wars , and how he recovered Damascus and Hamath ( which had been captured by Judah ) —is recorded in The Annals of the Kings of Israel .

TLB	2%20Kings	16	16	Uriah the priest did as King Ahaz instructed him .
TLB	2%20Kings	16	20	When Ahaz died he was buried in the royal cemetery , in the City of David sector of Jerusalem , and his son Hezekiah became the new king . Footnotes -
TLB	2%20Kings	16	17	Then the king dismantled the wheeled stands in the Temple , removed their crosspieces and the water vats they supported , and removed the great tank from the backs of the bronze oxen and placed it upon the stone pavement .
TLB	2%20Kings	16	3	he was as wicked as the kings of Israel . He even killed his own son by offering him as a burnt sacrifice to the gods , following the heathen customs of the nations around Judah—nations that the Lord destroyed when the people of Israel entered the land .
TLB	2%20Kings	16	4	He also sacrificed and burned incense at the shrines on the hills and at the numerous altars in the groves of trees .
TLB	2%20Kings	16	5	Then King Rezin of Syria and King Pekah ( son of Remaliah ) of Israel declared war on Ahaz and besieged Jerusalem ; but they did not conquer it .
TLB	2%20Kings	16	6	However , at that time King Rezin of Syria recovered the city of Elath for Syria ; he drove out the Jews and sent Syrians to live there , as they do to this day .
TLB	2%20Kings	16	7	King Ahaz sent a messenger to King Tiglath-pileser of Assyria , begging him to help him fight the attacking armies of Syria and Israel . [ a ]
TLB	2%20Kings	16	8	Ahaz took the silver and gold from the Temple and from the royal vaults and sent it as a payment to the Assyrian king .
TLB	2%20Kings	16	9	So the Assyrians attacked Damascus , the capital of Syria . They took away the population of the city as captives , resettling them in Kir , and King Rezin of Syria was killed .
TLB	2%20Kings	16	10	King Ahaz now went to Damascus to meet with King Tiglath-pileser , and while he was there he noticed an unusual altar in a heathen temple . [ b ] He jotted down its dimensions and made a sketch and sent it back to Uriah the priest with a detailed description . 11-12 Uriah built one just like it by following these directions and had it ready for the king , who , upon his return from Damascus , inaugurated it with an offering .
TLB	2%20Kings	16	13	The king presented a burnt offering and a grain offering , poured a drink offering over it , and sprinkled the blood of peace offerings upon it .
TLB	2%20Kings	16	14	Then he removed the old bronze altar from the front of the Temple ( it had stood between the Temple entrance and the new altar ) , and placed it on the north side of the new altar .
TLB	2%20Kings	16	15	He instructed Uriah the priest to use the new altar for the sacrifices of burnt offering , the evening grain offering , the king ’ s burnt offering and grain offering , and the offerings of the people , including their drink offerings . The blood from the burnt offerings and sacrifices was also to be sprinkled over the new altar . So the old altar was used only for purposes of divination . “ The old bronze altar , ” he said , “ will be only for my personal use. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	16	18	In deference to the king of Assyria he also removed the festive passageway he had constructed between the palace and the Temple . [ c ]

TLB	2%20Kings	17	2	Kings 17:20 descendants of Jacob , literally , “ descendants of Israel. ” The Living Bible copyright ©
TLB	2%20Kings	17	17	They even burned their own sons and daughters to death on the altars of Molech ; they consulted fortune-tellers and used magic and sold themselves to evil . So the Lord was very angry .
TLB	2%20Kings	17	9	The people of Israel had also secretly done many things that were wrong , and they had built altars to other gods throughout the land . [ a ]
TLB	2%20Kings	17	12	Yes , they worshiped idols , despite the Lord ’ s specific and repeated warnings .
TLB	2%20Kings	17	3	King Shalmaneser of Assyria attacked and defeated King Hoshea , so Israel had to pay heavy annual taxes to Assyria .
TLB	2%20Kings	17	4	Then Hoshea conspired against the king of Assyria by asking King So of Egypt to help him shake free of Assyria ’ s power , but this treachery was discovered . At the same time he refused to pay the annual tribute to Assyria . So the king of Assyria put him in prison and in chains for his rebellion .
TLB	2%20Kings	17	5	Now the land of Israel was filled with Assyrian troops for three years besieging Samaria , the capital city of Israel .
TLB	2%20Kings	17	6	Finally , in the ninth year of King Hoshea ’ s reign , Samaria fell and the people of Israel were exiled to Assyria . They were placed in colonies in the city of Halah and along the banks of the Habor River in Gozan , and among the cities of the Medes .
TLB	2%20Kings	17	7	This disaster came upon the nation of Israel because the people worshiped other gods , thus sinning against the Lord their God who had brought them safely out of their slavery in Egypt .
TLB	2%20Kings	17	8	They had followed the evil customs of the nations which the Lord had cast out from before them .
TLB	2%20Kings	17	10	They had placed obelisks and idols at the top of every hill and under every green tree ;
TLB	2%20Kings	17	11	and they had burned incense to the gods of the very nations which the Lord had cleared out of the land when Israel came in . So the people of Israel had done many evil things , and the Lord was very angry .
TLB	2%20Kings	17	13	Again and again the Lord had sent prophets to warn both Israel and Judah to turn from their evil ways ; he had warned them to obey his commandments which he had given to their ancestors through these prophets ,
TLB	2%20Kings	17	14	but Israel wouldn ’ t listen . The people were as stubborn as their ancestors and refused to believe in the Lord their God .
TLB	2%20Kings	17	15	They rejected his laws and the covenant he had made with their ancestors , and despised all his warnings . In their foolishness they worshiped heathen idols despite the Lord ’ s stern warnings .
TLB	2%20Kings	17	16	They defied all the commandments of the Lord their God and made two calves from molten gold . They made detestable , shameful idols and worshiped Baal and the sun , moon , and stars .
TLB	2%20Kings	17	18	He swept them from his sight until only the tribe of Judah remained in the land .
TLB	2%20Kings	17	19	But even Judah refused to obey the commandments of the Lord their God ; they too walked in the same evil paths as Israel had .
TLB	2%20Kings	17	20	So the Lord rejected all the descendants of Jacob . [ b ] He punished them by delivering them to their attackers until they were destroyed .
TLB	2%20Kings	17	21	For Israel split off from the kingdom of David and chose Jeroboam I ( the son of Nebat ) as its king . Then Jeroboam drew Israel away from following the Lord . He made them sin a great sin ,
TLB	2%20Kings	17	22	and the people of Israel never quit doing the evil things that Jeroboam led them into ,
TLB	2%20Kings	17	23	until the Lord finally swept them away , just as all his prophets had warned would happen . So Israel was carried off to the land of Assyria where they remain to this day .
TLB	2%20Kings	17	24	And the king of Assyria transported colonies of people from Babylon , Cuthah , Avva , Hamath , and Sepharvaim and resettled them in the cities of Samaria , replacing the people of Israel . So the Assyrians took over Samaria and the other cities of Israel .
TLB	2%20Kings	17	25	But since these Assyrian colonists did not worship the Lord when they first arrived , the Lord sent lions among them to kill some of them .
TLB	2%20Kings	17	26	Then they sent a message to the king of Assyria : “ We colonists here in Israel don ’ t know the laws of the god of the land , and he has sent lions among us to destroy us because we have not worshiped him. ” 27-28 The king of Assyria then decreed that one of the exiled priests from Samaria should return to Israel and teach the new residents the laws of the god of the land . So one of them returned to Bethel and taught the colonists from Babylon how to worship the Lord .
TLB	2%20Kings	17	29	But these foreigners also worshiped their own gods . They placed them in the shrines on the hills near their cities .
TLB	2%20Kings	17	30	Those from Babylon worshiped idols of their god Succoth-benoth ; those from Cuth worshiped their god Nergal ; and the men of Hamath worshiped Ashima .
TLB	2%20Kings	17	31	The gods Nibhaz and Tartak were worshiped by the Avvites , and the people from Sephar even burned their own children on the altars of their gods Adrammelech and Anammelech .
TLB	2%20Kings	17	32	They also worshiped the Lord , and they appointed from among themselves priests to sacrifice to the Lord on the hilltop altars .
TLB	2%20Kings	17	33	But they continued to follow the religious customs of the nations from which they came .
TLB	2%20Kings	17	34	And this is still going on among them today—they follow their former practices instead of truly worshiping the Lord or obeying the laws he gave to the descendants of Jacob ( whose name was later changed to Israel ) . 35-36 For the Lord had made a contract with them—that they were never to worship or make sacrifices to any heathen gods . They were to worship only the Lord who had brought them out of the land of Egypt with such tremendous miracles and power .
TLB	2%20Kings	17	37	The descendants of Jacob were to obey all of God ’ s laws and never worship other gods .
TLB	2%20Kings	17	38	For God had said , “ You must never forget the covenant I made with you ; never worship other gods .
TLB	2%20Kings	17	39	You must worship only the Lord ; he will save you from all your enemies. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	17	40	But Israel didn ’ t listen , and the people continued to worship other gods .
TLB	2%20Kings	17	41	These colonists from Babylon worshiped the Lord , yes—but they also worshiped their idols . And to this day their descendants do the same thing . Footnotes -

TLB	2%20Kings	18	18	They demanded that King Hezekiah come out to speak to them , but instead he sent a truce delegation of the following men : Eliakim , his business manager ; Shebnah , his secretary ; and Joah , his royal historian .
TLB	2%20Kings	18	25	And do you think we have come here on our own ? No ! The Lord sent us and told us , ‘ Go and destroy this nation ! ’ ”
TLB	2%20Kings	18	29	‘ Don ’ t let King Hezekiah fool you . He will never be able to save you from my power .
TLB	2%20Kings	18	3	years
TLB	2%20Kings	18	4	He removed the shrines on the hills , broke down the obelisks , knocked down the shameful idols of Asherah , and broke up the bronze serpent that Moses had made , because the people of Israel had begun to worship it by burning incense to it ; even though , as King Hezekiah [ a ] pointed out to them , it was merely a piece of bronze .
TLB	2%20Kings	18	5	He trusted very strongly in the Lord God of Israel . In fact , none of the kings before or after him were as close to God as he was .
TLB	2%20Kings	18	6	For he followed the Lord in everything , and carefully obeyed all of God ’ s commands to Moses .
TLB	2%20Kings	18	7	So the Lord was with him and prospered everything he did . Then he rebelled against the king of Assyria and refused to pay tribute any longer .
TLB	2%20Kings	18	8	He also conquered the Philistines as far distant as Gaza and its suburbs , destroying cities both large and small . [ b ]
TLB	2%20Kings	18	9	It was during the fourth year of his reign ( which was the seventh year of the reign of King Hoshea in Israel ) that King Shalmaneser of Assyria attacked Israel and began a siege on the city of Samaria .
TLB	2%20Kings	18	10	Three years later ( during the sixth year of the reign of King Hezekiah and the ninth year of the reign of King Hoshea of Israel ) Samaria fell .
TLB	2%20Kings	18	11	It was at that time that the king of Assyria transported the Israelis to Assyria and put them in colonies in the city of Halath and along the banks of the Habor River in Gozan , and in the cities of the Medes .
TLB	2%20Kings	18	12	For they had refused to listen to the Lord their God or to do what he wanted them to do . Instead , they had transgressed his covenant and disobeyed all the laws given to them by Moses the servant of the Lord .
TLB	2%20Kings	18	13	Later , during the fourteenth year of the reign of King Hezekiah , King Sennacherib of Assyria besieged and captured all the fortified cities of Judah .
TLB	2%20Kings	18	14	King Hezekiah sued for peace and sent this message to the king of Assyria at Lachish : “ I have done wrong . I will pay whatever tribute you demand if you will only go away. ” The king of Assyria then demanded a settlement of $ 1,500,000 .
TLB	2%20Kings	18	15	To gather this amount , King Hezekiah used all the silver stored in the Temple and in the palace treasury .
TLB	2%20Kings	18	16	He even stripped off the gold from the Temple doors , and from the doorposts he had overlaid with gold , and gave it all to the Assyrian king .
TLB	2%20Kings	18	17	Nevertheless the king of Assyria sent his field marshal , his chief treasurer , and his chief of staff from Lachish with a great army ; and they camped along the highway beside the field where cloth was bleached , near the conduit of the upper pool .
TLB	2%20Kings	18	19	Then the Assyrian general sent this message to King Hezekiah : “ The great king of Assyria says , ‘ No one can save you from my power ! 20-21 You need more than mere promises of help before rebelling against me . But which of your allies will give you more than words ? Egypt ? If you lean on Egypt , you will find her to be a stick that breaks beneath your weight and pierces your hand . The Egyptian Pharaoh is totally unreliable !
TLB	2%20Kings	18	22	And if you say , “ We ’ re trusting the Lord to rescue us ” —just remember that he is the very one whose hilltop altars you ’ ve destroyed . For you require everyone to worship at the altar in Jerusalem ! ’
TLB	2%20Kings	18	23	I ’ ll tell you what : Make a bet with my master , the king of Assyria ! If you have two thousand men left who can ride horses , we ’ ll furnish the horses !
TLB	2%20Kings	18	24	And with an army as small as yours , [ c ] you are no threat to even the least lieutenant in charge of the smallest contingent in my master ’ s army . Even if Egypt supplies you with horses and chariots , it will do no good .
TLB	2%20Kings	18	26	Then Eliakim , Shebnah , and Joah said to them , “ Please speak in Aramaic , for we understand it . Don ’ t use Hebrew , for the people standing on the walls will hear you. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	18	27	But the Assyrian general replied , “ Has my master sent me to speak only to you and to your master ? Hasn ’ t he sent me to the people on the walls too ? For they are doomed with you to eat their own excrement and drink their own urine ! ”
TLB	2%20Kings	18	28	Then the Assyrian ambassador shouted in Hebrew to the people on the wall , “ Listen to the great king of Assyria !
TLB	2%20Kings	18	30	Don ’ t let him fool you into trusting in the Lord to rescue you . 31-32 Don ’ t listen to King Hezekiah . Surrender ! You can live in peace here in your own land until I take you to another land just like this one—with plentiful crops , grain , grapes , olive trees , and honey . All of this instead of death ! Don ’ t listen to King Hezekiah when he tries to persuade you that the Lord will deliver you .
TLB	2%20Kings	18	33	Have any of the gods of the other nations ever delivered their people from the king of Assyria ?
TLB	2%20Kings	18	34	What happened to the gods of Hamath , Arpad , Sepharvaim , Hena , and Ivvah ? Did they rescue Samaria ?
TLB	2%20Kings	18	35	What god has ever been able to save any nation from my power ? So what makes you think the Lord can save Jerusalem ? ’ ”
TLB	2%20Kings	18	36	But the people on the wall remained silent , for the king had instructed them to say nothing .
TLB	2%20Kings	18	37	Then Eliakim ( son of Hilkiah ) the business manager , and Shebnah the king ’ s secretary , and Joah ( son of Asaph ) the historian went to King Hezekiah with their clothes torn and told him what the Assyrian general had said . Footnotes -

TLB	2%20Kings	19	19	O Lord our God , we plead with you to save us from his power ; then all the kingdoms of the earth will know that you alone are God. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	19	3	“ King Hezekiah says , ‘ This is a day of trouble , insult , and dishonor . It is as when a child is ready to be born , but the mother has no strength to deliver it .
TLB	2%20Kings	19	4	Yet perhaps the Lord your God has heard the Assyrian general defying the living God and will rebuke him . Oh , pray for the few of us who are left. ’ ” 5-6 Isaiah replied , “ The Lord says , ‘ Tell your master not to be troubled by the sneers these Assyrians have made against me. ’
TLB	2%20Kings	19	7	For the king of Assyria will receive bad news from home and will decide to return ; and the Lord will see to it that he is killed when he arrives there. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	19	8	Then the Assyrian general returned to his king at Libnah ( for he received word that he had left Lachish ) .
TLB	2%20Kings	19	9	Soon afterwards news reached the king that King Tirhakah of Ethiopia was coming to attack him . Before leaving to meet the attack , he sent back this message to King Hezekiah :
TLB	2%20Kings	19	10	“ Don ’ t be fooled by that god you trust in . Don ’ t believe it when he says that I won ’ t conquer Jerusalem .
TLB	2%20Kings	19	11	You know perfectly well what the kings of Assyria have done wherever they have gone ; they have completely destroyed everything . Why would you be any different ?
TLB	2%20Kings	19	12	Have the gods of the other nations delivered them—such nations as Gozan , Haran , Rezeph , and Eden in the land of Telassar ? The former kings of Assyria destroyed them all !

TLB	2%20Kings	19	14	Hezekiah took the letter from the messengers , read it , and went over to the Temple and spread it out before the Lord .
TLB	2%20Kings	19	15	Then he prayed this prayer : “ O Lord God of Israel , sitting on your throne high above the angels , [ a ] you alone are the God of all the kingdoms of the earth . You created the heavens and the earth .
TLB	2%20Kings	19	16	Bend low , O Lord , and listen . Open your eyes , O Lord , and see . Listen to this man ’ s defiance of the living God .
TLB	2%20Kings	19	17	Lord , it is true that the kings of Assyria have destroyed all those nations
TLB	2%20Kings	19	18	and have burned their idol-gods . But they weren ’ t gods at all ; they were destroyed because they were only things that men had made of wood and stone .
TLB	2%20Kings	19	20	Then Isaiah sent this message to Hezekiah : “ The Lord God of Israel says , ‘ I have heard you !
TLB	2%20Kings	19	21	And this is my reply to King Sennacherib : The virgin daughter of Zion isn ’ t afraid of you ! The daughter of Jerusalem scorns and mocks at you .
TLB	2%20Kings	19	22	Whom have you defied and blasphemed ? And toward whom have you felt so cocky ? It is the Holy One of Israel !
TLB	2%20Kings	19	23	“ ‘ You have boasted , “ My chariots have conquered the highest mountains , yes , the peaks of Lebanon . I have cut down the tallest cedars and choicest cypress trees and have conquered the farthest borders .
TLB	2%20Kings	19	24	I have been refreshed at many conquered wells , and I destroyed the strength of Egypt just by walking by ! ”
TLB	2%20Kings	19	25	“ ‘ Why haven ’ t you realized long before this that it is I , the Lord , who lets you do these things ? I decreed your conquest of all those fortified cities !
TLB	2%20Kings	19	26	So of course the nations you conquered had no power against you ! They were like grass shriveling beneath the hot sun , and like grain blighted before it is half grown .
TLB	2%20Kings	19	27	I know everything about you . I know all your plans and where you are going next ; and I also know the evil things you have said about me .
TLB	2%20Kings	19	28	And because of your arrogance against me , I am going to put a hook in your nose and a bridle in your mouth and turn you back on the road by which you came .
TLB	2%20Kings	19	29	And this is the proof that I will do as I have promised : This year my people will eat the volunteer wheat and use it as seed for next year ’ s crop ; and in the third year they will have a bountiful harvest .
TLB	2%20Kings	19	30	“ ‘ O my people Judah , those of you who have escaped the ravages of the siege shall become a great nation again ; you shall be rooted deeply in the soil and bear fruit for God .
TLB	2%20Kings	19	31	A remnant of my people shall become strong in Jerusalem . The Lord is eager to cause this to happen .
TLB	2%20Kings	19	32	“ ‘ And my command concerning the king of Assyria is that he shall not enter this city . He shall not stand before it with a shield , nor build a ramp against its wall , nor even shoot an arrow into it .
TLB	2%20Kings	19	33	He shall return by the road he came ,
TLB	2%20Kings	19	34	for I will defend and save this city for the sake of my own name and for the sake of my servant David. ’ ”
TLB	2%20Kings	19	35	That very night the Angel of the Lord killed 185,000 Assyrian troops , and dead bodies were seen all across the landscape in the morning .
TLB	2%20Kings	19	36	Then King Sennacherib returned to Nineveh ;
TLB	2%20Kings	19	37	and as he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch , his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer killed him . They escaped into eastern Turkey—the land of Ararat—and his son Esarhaddon became the new king . Footnotes -

TLB	2%20Kings	20	20	The rest of the history of Hezekiah and his great deeds—including the pool and conduit he made and how he brought water into the city—are recorded in The Annals of the Kings of Judah .
TLB	2%20Kings	20	3	“ O Lord , ” he pleaded , “ remember how I ’ ve always tried to obey you and to please you in everything I do . . . . ” Then he broke down and cried .
TLB	2%20Kings	20	4	So before Isaiah had left the courtyard , the Lord spoke to him again .
TLB	2%20Kings	20	5	“ Go back to Hezekiah , the leader of my people , and tell him that the Lord God of his ancestor David has heard his prayer and seen his tears . I will heal him , and three days from now he will be out of bed and at the Temple !
TLB	2%20Kings	20	6	I will add fifteen years to his life and save him and this city from the king of Assyria . And it will all be done for the glory of my own name and for the sake of my servant David. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	20	7	Isaiah then instructed Hezekiah to boil some dried figs and to make a paste of them and spread it on the boil . And he recovered !
TLB	2%20Kings	20	8	Meanwhile , King Hezekiah had said to Isaiah , “ Do a miracle to prove to me that the Lord will heal me and that I will be able to go to the Temple again three days from now. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	20	9	“ All right , the Lord will give you a proof , ” Isaiah told him . “ Do you want the shadow on the sundial to go forward ten points or backward ten points ? ”
TLB	2%20Kings	20	10	“ The shadow always moves forward , ” Hezekiah replied ; “ make it go backward. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	20	11	So Isaiah asked the Lord to do this , and he caused the shadow to move ten points backward on the sundial of Ahaz ! [ a ]
TLB	2%20Kings	20	12	At that time Merodach-baladan ( the son of King Baladan of Babylon ) sent ambassadors with greetings and a present to Hezekiah , for he had learned of his sickness .
TLB	2%20Kings	20	13	Hezekiah welcomed them and showed them all his treasures—the silver , gold , spices , aromatic oils , the armory—everything .
TLB	2%20Kings	20	14	Then Isaiah went to King Hezekiah and asked him , “ What did these men want ? Where are they from ? ” “ From far away in Babylon , ” Hezekiah replied .
TLB	2%20Kings	20	15	“ What have they seen in your palace ? ” Isaiah asked . And Hezekiah replied , “ Everything . I showed them all my treasures. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	20	16	Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah , “ Listen to the word of the Lord :
TLB	2%20Kings	20	17	The time will come when everything in this palace shall be carried to Babylon . All the treasures of your ancestors will be taken—nothing shall be left .
TLB	2%20Kings	20	18	Some of your own sons will be taken away and made into eunuchs who will serve in the palace of the king of Babylon. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	20	19	“ All right , ” Hezekiah replied , “ if this is what the Lord wants , it is good. ” But he was really thinking , “ At least there will be peace and security during the remainder of my own life ! ”

TLB	2%20Kings	21	2	years , in Jerusalem Mother ’ s name : Meshullemeth ( daughter of Haruz , of Jotbah ) Character of his reign : evil
TLB	2%20Kings	21	21	He did all the evil things his father had done : he worshiped the same idols
TLB	2%20Kings	21	12	I will bring such evil upon Jerusalem and Judah that the ears of those who hear about it will tingle with horror .
TLB	2%20Kings	21	55	years , in Jerusalem Mother ’ s name : Hephzibah Character of his reign : evil ; he did the same things the nations had done that were thrown out of the land to make room for the people of Israel 3-5 He rebuilt the hilltop shrines that his father Hezekiah had destroyed . He built altars for Baal and made a shameful Asherah idol , just as Ahab the king of Israel had done . Heathen altars to the sun god , moon god , and the gods of the stars were placed even in the Temple of the Lord—in the very city and building that the Lord had selected to honor his own name .
TLB	2%20Kings	21	6	And he sacrificed one of his sons as a burnt offering on a heathen altar . He practiced black magic and used fortune-telling , and patronized mediums and wizards . So the Lord was very angry , for Manasseh was an evil man , in God ’ s sight .
TLB	2%20Kings	21	7	Manasseh even set up a shameful Asherah idol in the Temple—the very place that the Lord had spoken to David and Solomon about when he said , “ I will place my name forever in this Temple , and in Jerusalem—the city I have chosen from among all the cities of the tribes of Israel .
TLB	2%20Kings	21	8	If the people of Israel will only follow the instructions I gave them through Moses , I will never again expel them from this land of their fathers. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	21	9	But the people did not listen to the Lord , and Manasseh enticed them to do even more evil than the surrounding nations had done , even though Jehovah had destroyed those nations for their evil ways when the people of Israel entered the land .
TLB	2%20Kings	21	10	Then the Lord declared through the prophets ,
TLB	2%20Kings	21	11	“ Because King Manasseh has done these evil things and is even more wicked than the Amorites who were in this land long ago , and because he has led the people of Judah into idolatry :
TLB	2%20Kings	21	13	I will punish Jerusalem as I did Samaria , and as I did King Ahab of Israel and his descendants . I will wipe away the people of Jerusalem as a man wipes a dish and turns it upside down to dry .
TLB	2%20Kings	21	14	Then I will reject even those few of my people who are left , and I will hand them over to their enemies .
TLB	2%20Kings	21	15	For they have done great evil and have angered me ever since I brought their ancestors from Egypt. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	21	16	In addition to the idolatry which God hated and into which Manasseh led the people of Judah , he murdered great numbers of innocent people . And Jerusalem was filled from one end to the other with the bodies of his victims .
TLB	2%20Kings	21	17	The rest of the history of Manasseh ’ s sinful reign is recorded in The Annals of the Kings of Judah .
TLB	2%20Kings	21	18	When he died he was buried in the garden of his palace at Uzza , and his son Amon became the new king . 19-20 New king of Judah : Amon His age at the beginning of his reign :
TLB	2%20Kings	21	22	and turned his back on the Lord God of his ancestors . He refused to listen to God ’ s instructions .
TLB	2%20Kings	21	23	But his aides conspired against him and killed him in the palace .
TLB	2%20Kings	21	24	Then a posse of civilians killed all the assassins and placed Amon ’ s son Josiah upon the throne .

TLB	2%20Kings	22	22	1-2 New king of Judah : Josiah His age at the beginning of his reign :
TLB	2%20Kings	22	8	One day Hilkiah the High Priest went to Shaphan the secretary and exclaimed , “ I have discovered a scroll in the Temple , with God ’ s laws written on it ! ” He gave the scroll to Shaphan to read . 9-10 When Shaphan reported to the king about the progress of the repairs at the Temple , he also mentioned the scroll found by Hilkiah . Then Shaphan read it to the king .
TLB	2%20Kings	22	31	years , in Jerusalem Mother ’ s name : Jedidah ( daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath ) Character of his reign : good ; he followed in the steps of his ancestor King David , obeying the Lord completely 3-4 In the eighteenth year of his reign , King Josiah sent his secretary Shaphan ( son of Azaliah , son of Meshullam ) to the Temple to give instruction to Hilkiah , the High Priest : “ Collect the money given to the priests at the door of the Temple when the people come to worship . 5-6 Give this money to the building superintendents so that they can hire carpenters and masons to repair the Temple , and to buy lumber and stone. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	22	7	( The building superintendents were not required to keep account of their expenditures , for they were honest men . )
TLB	2%20Kings	22	11	When the king heard what was written in it , he tore his clothes in terror . 12-13 He commanded Hilkiah the priest , and Shaphan , and Asaiah , the king ’ s assistant , and Ahikam ( Shaphan ’ s son ) , and Achbor ( Michaiah ’ s son ) to ask the Lord , “ What shall we do ? For we have not been following the instructions of this book : you must be very angry with us , for neither we nor our ancestors have followed your commands. ”
TLB	2%20Kings	22	14	So Hilkiah the priest , and Ahikam , and Achbor , and Shaphan , and Asaiah went to the Mishneh section of Jerusalem to find Huldah the prophetess . ( She was the wife of Shallum—son of Tikvah , son of Harhas—who was in charge of the palace tailor shop . ) 15-16 She gave them this message from the Lord God of Israel : “ Tell the man who sent you to me that I am going to destroy this city and its people , just as I stated in that book you read .
TLB	2%20Kings	22	17	For the people of Judah have thrown me aside and have worshiped other gods and have made me very angry ; and my anger can ’ t be stopped . 18-19 But because you were sorry and concerned and humbled yourself before the Lord when you read the book and its warnings that this land would be cursed and become desolate , and because you have torn your clothing and wept before me in contrition , I will listen to your plea .
TLB	2%20Kings	22	20	The death of this nation will not occur until after you die—you will not see the evil that I will bring upon this place. ” So they took the message to the king . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	2%20Kings	23	4	Then the king instructed Hilkiah the High Priest and the rest of the priests and the guards of the Temple to destroy all the equipment used in the worship of Baal , Asherah , and the sun , moon , and stars . The king had it all burned in the fields of the Kidron Valley outside Jerusalem , and he carried the ashes to Bethel .
TLB	2%20Kings	23	5	He killed the heathen priests who had been appointed by the previous kings of Judah , for they had burned incense in the shrines on the hills throughout Judah and even in Jerusalem . They had also offered incense to Baal and to the sun , moon , stars , and planets .
TLB	2%20Kings	23	6	He removed the shameful idol of Asherah from the Temple and took it outside Jerusalem to Kidron Brook ; there he burned it and beat it to dust and threw the dust on the graves of the common people .
TLB	2%20Kings	23	7	He also tore down the houses of male prostitution around the Temple , where the women wove robes for the Asherah idol .
TLB	2%20Kings	23	8	He brought back to Jerusalem the priests of the Lord , who were living in other cities of Judah , and tore down all the shrines on the hills where they had burned incense , even those as far away as Geba and Beersheba . He also destroyed the shrines at the entrance of the palace of Joshua , the former mayor of Jerusalem , located on the left side as one enters the city gate .
TLB	2%20Kings	23	9	However , these priests [ a ] did not serve at the altar of the Lord in Jerusalem , even though they ate with the other priests .
TLB	2%20Kings	23	10	Then the king destroyed the altar of Topheth in the valley of the sons of Hinnom , so that no one could ever again use it to burn his son or daughter to death as a sacrifice to Molech .

TLB	2%20Kings	23	12	Then he tore down the altars that the kings of Judah had built on the palace roof above the Ahaz Room . He also destroyed the altars that Manasseh had built in the two courts of the Temple ; he smashed them to bits and scattered the pieces in Kidron Valley .
TLB	2%20Kings	23	13	Next he removed the shrines on the hills east of Jerusalem and south of Destruction Mountain . ( Solomon had built these shrines for Ashtoreth , the evil goddess of the Sidonians ; and for Chemosh , the evil god of Moab ; and for Milcom , the evil god of the Ammonites . )
TLB	2%20Kings	23	14	He smashed the obelisks and cut down the shameful idols of Asherah ; then he defiled these places by scattering human bones over them .
TLB	2%20Kings	23	15	He also tore down the altar and shrine at Bethel that Jeroboam I had made when he led Israel into sin . He crushed the stones to dust and burned the shameful idol of Asherah .
TLB	2%20Kings	23	16	As Josiah was looking around , he noticed several graves in the side of the mountain . He ordered his men to bring out the bones in them and to burn them there upon the altar at Bethel to defile it , just as the Lord ’ s prophet had declared would happen to Jeroboam ’ s altar . [ b ]
TLB	2%20Kings	23	17	“ What is that monument over there ? ” he asked . And the men of the city told him , “ It is the grave of the prophet who came from Judah and proclaimed that what you have just done would happen here at the altar at Bethel ! ”
TLB	2%20Kings	23	18	So King Josiah replied , “ Leave it alone . Don ’ t disturb his bones. ” So they didn ’ t burn his bones or those of the prophet from Samaria . [ c ]
TLB	2%20Kings	23	19	Josiah demolished the shrines on the hills in all of Samaria . They had been built by the various kings of Israel and had made the Lord very angry . But now he crushed them into dust , just as he had done at Bethel .
TLB	2%20Kings	23	20	He executed the priests of the heathen shrines upon their own altars , and he burned human bones upon the altars to defile them . Finally he returned to Jerusalem .
TLB	2%20Kings	23	21	The king then issued orders for his people to observe the Passover ceremonies as recorded by the Lord their God in The Book of the Covenant .
TLB	2%20Kings	23	22	There had not been a Passover celebration like that since the days of the judges of Israel , and there was never another like it in all the years of the kings of Israel and Judah .
TLB	2%20Kings	23	24	Josiah also exterminated the mediums and wizards , and every kind of idol worship , both in Jerusalem and throughout the land . For Josiah wanted to follow all the laws that were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest had found in the Temple .
TLB	2%20Kings	23	25	years old Length of reign :
TLB	2%20Kings	23	26	But the Lord still did not hold back his great anger against Judah , caused by the evils of King Manasseh .

TLB	2%20Kings	23	30	His officers took his body back in a chariot from Megiddo to Jerusalem and buried him in the grave he had selected . And his son Jehoahaz was chosen by the nation as its new king . 31-32 New king of Judah : Jehoahaz His age at the beginning of his reign :
TLB	2%20Kings	23	33	Pharaoh Neco jailed him at Riblah in Hamath to prevent his reigning in Jerusalem , and he levied a tax against Judah totaling $ 230,000 .

TLB	2%20Kings	25	7	He was forced to watch as his sons were killed before his eyes ; then his eyes were put out , and he was bound with chains and taken away to Babylon .
TLB	2%20Kings	25	8	General Nebuzaradan , the captain of the royal bodyguard , arrived at Jerusalem from Babylon on July
TLB	2%20Kings	25	22	Then King Nebuchadnezzar appointed Gedaliah ( the son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan ) as governor over the people left in Judah .
TLB	2%20Kings	25	9	He burned down the Temple , the palace , and all the other houses of any worth .
TLB	2%20Kings	25	10	He then supervised the Babylonian army in tearing down the walls of Jerusalem .
TLB	2%20Kings	25	11	The remainder of the people in the city and the Jewish deserters who had declared their allegiance to the king of Babylon were all taken as exiles to Babylon .
TLB	2%20Kings	25	12	But the poorest of the people were left to farm the land .
TLB	2%20Kings	25	13	The Babylonians broke up the bronze pillars of the Temple and the bronze tank and its bases and carried all the bronze to Babylon . 14-15 They also took all the pots , shovels , firepans , snuffers , spoons , and other bronze instruments used for the sacrifices .

David made him captain of his bodyguard . 26-47 Other famous warriors among David ’ s men were : Asahel ( Joab ’ s brother ) ; Elhanan , the son of Dodo from Bethlehem ; Shammoth from Harod ; Helez from Pelon ; Ira ( son of Ikkesh ) from Tekoa ; Abiezer from Anathoth ; Sibbecai from Hushath ; Ilai from Ahoh ; Maharai from Netophah ; Heled ( son of Baanah ) from Netophah ; Ithai ( son of Ribai ) a Benjaminite from Gibeah ; Benaiah from Pirathon ; Hurai from near the brooks of Gaash ; Abiel from Arbath ; Azmaveth from Baharum ; Eliahba from Shaalbon ; The sons [ d ] of Hashem from Gizon ; Jonathan ( son of Shagee ) from Harar ; Ahiam ( son of Sacher ) from Harar ; Eliphal ( son of Ur ) ; Hepher from Mecherath ; Ahijah from Pelon ; Hezro from Carmel ; Naarai ( son of Ezbai ) ; Joel ( brother of Nathan ) ; Mibhar ( son of Hagri ) ; Zelek from Ammon ; Naharai from Beeroth—he was General Joab ’ s armor bearer ; Ira from Ithra ; Gareb from Ithra ; Uriah the Hittite ; Zabad ( son of Ahlai ) ; Adina ( son of Shiza ) from the tribe of Reuben—he was among the thirty-one leaders of the tribe of Reuben ; Hanan ( son of Maacah ) ; Joshaphat from Mithna ; Uzzia from Ashterath ; Shama and Jeiel ( sons of Hotham ) from Aroer ; Jediael ( son of Shimri ) ; Joha ( his brother ) from Tiza ; Eliel from Mahavi ; Jeribai and Joshaviah ( sons of Elnaam ) ; Ithmah from Moab ; Eliel ; Obed ; Jaasiel from Mezoba .

TLB	1%20Chronicles	12	12	These are the names of the famous warriors who joined David at Ziklag while he was hiding from King Saul . [ a ]
TLB	1%20Chronicles	12	2	All of them were expert archers and slingers , and they could use their left hands as readily as their right ! Like King Saul , they were all of the tribe of Benjamin . 3-7 Their chief was Ahiezer , son of Shemaah from Gibeah . The others were : His brother Joash ; Jeziel and Pelet , sons of Azmaveth ; Beracah ; Jehu from Anathoth ; Ishmaiah from Gibeon ( a brave warrior rated as high or higher than The Thirty ) ; Jeremiah ; Jahaziel ; Johanan ; Jozabad from Gederah ; Eluzai ; Jerimoth ; Bealiah ; Shemariah ; Shephatiah from Haruph ; Elkanah , Isshiah , Azarel , Joezer , Jashobeam—all Korahites ; Joelah and Zebadiah ( sons of Jeroham from Gedor ) . 8-13 Great and brave warriors from the tribe of Gad also went to David in the wilderness . They were experts with both shield and spear and were “ lion-faced men , swift as deer upon the mountains. ” Ezer was the chief ; Obadiah was second in command ; Eliab was third in command ; Mishmannah was fourth in command ; Jeremiah was fifth in command ; Attai was sixth in command ; Eliel was seventh in command ; Johanan was eighth in command ; Elzabad was ninth in command ; Jeremiah was tenth in command ; Machbannai was eleventh in command .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	12	14	These men were army officers ; the weakest was worth a hundred normal troops , and the greatest was worth a thousand !
TLB	1%20Chronicles	12	15	They crossed the Jordan River during its seasonal flooding and conquered the lowlands on both the east and west banks .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	12	16	Others came to David from Benjamin and Judah .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	12	17	David went out to meet them and said , “ If you have come to help me , we are friends ; but if you have come to betray me to my enemies when I am innocent , then may the God of our fathers see and judge you. ”
TLB	1%20Chronicles	12	18	Then the Holy Spirit came upon them , and Amasai , a leader of The Thirty , replied , “ We are yours , David ; We are on your side , son of Jesse . Peace , peace be unto you , And peace to all who aid you ; For your God is with you. ” So David let them join him , and he made them captains of his army .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	12	19	Some men from Manasseh deserted the Israeli army and joined David just as he was going into battle with the Philistines against King Saul . But as it turned out , the Philistine generals refused to let David and his men go with them . After much discussion they sent them back , for they were afraid that David and his men would imperil them by deserting to King Saul .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	12	20	Here is a list of the men from Manasseh who deserted to David as he was en route to Ziklag : Adnah , Jozabad , Jediael , Michael , Jozabad , Elihu , Zillethai . Each was a high-ranking officer of Manasseh ’ s troops .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	12	21	They were brave and able warriors , and they assisted David when he fought against the Amalek raiders at Ziklag . [ b ]
TLB	1%20Chronicles	12	22	More men joined David almost every day until he had a tremendous army—the army of God .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	12	23	Here is the registry of recruits who joined David at Hebron . They were all anxious to see David become king instead of Saul , just as the Lord had said would happen . 24-37 From Judah , 6,800 troops armed with shields and spears . From the tribe of Simeon , 7,100 outstanding warriors . From the Levites , 4,600 . From the priests—descendants of Aaron—there were 3,700 troops under the command of Zadok , a young man of unusual courage , and Jehoiada . ( He and twenty-two members of his family were officers of the fighting priests . ) From the tribe of Benjamin , the same tribe Saul was from , there were 3,000 . ( Most of that tribe retained its allegiance to Saul . ) From the tribe of Ephraim , 20,800 mighty warriors , each famous in his respective clan . From the half-tribe of Manasseh , 18,000 were sent for the express purpose of helping David become king . From the tribe of Issachar there were
TLB	1%20Chronicles	12	200	leaders of the tribe with their relatives—all men who understood the temper of the times and knew the best course for Israel to take . From the tribe of Zebulun there were 50,000 trained warriors ; they were fully armed and totally loyal to David . From Naphtali there were 1,000 officers and 37,000 troops equipped with shields and spears . From the tribe of Dan there were 28,600 troops , all of them prepared for war . From the tribe of Asher , there were 40,000 trained and ready troops . From the other side of the Jordan River—where the tribes of Reuben and Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh lived—there were 120,000 troops equipped with every kind of weapon .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	12	38	All these men came in battle array to Hebron with the single purpose of making David the king of Israel . In fact , all of Israel was ready for this change .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	12	39	They feasted and drank with David for three days , for preparations had been made for their arrival .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	12	40	People from nearby and from as far away as Issachar , Zebulun , and Naphtali brought food on donkeys , camels , mules , and oxen . Vast supplies of flour , fig cakes , raisins , wine , oil , cattle , and sheep were brought to the celebration , for joy had spread throughout the land . Footnotes -

TLB	1%20Chronicles	13	13	Finally he decided to take it to the home of Obed-edom the Gittite instead of bringing it to the City of David .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	13	2	he addressed the assembled men of Israel as follows : “ Since you think that I should be your king , and since the Lord our God has given his approval , let us send messages to our brothers throughout the land of Israel , including the priests and Levites , inviting them to come and join us .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	13	3	And let us bring back the Ark of our God , for we have been neglecting it ever since Saul became king. ”
TLB	1%20Chronicles	13	4	There was unanimous consent , for everyone agreed with him .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	13	5	So David summoned the people of Israel from all across the nation [ a ] so that they could be present when the Ark of God was brought from Kiriath-jearim .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	13	6	Then David and all Israel went to Baalah ( i.e. , Kiriath-jearim ) in Judah to bring back the Ark of the Lord God enthroned above the Guardian Angels . [ b ]
TLB	1%20Chronicles	13	7	It was taken from the house of Abinadab on a new cart . Uzza and Ahio drove the oxen .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	13	8	Then David and all the people danced before the Lord with great enthusiasm , accompanied by singing and by zithers , harps , tambourines , cymbals , and trumpets .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	13	9	But as they arrived at the threshing floor of Chidon , the oxen stumbled and Uzza reached out his hand to steady the Ark .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	13	10	Then the anger of the Lord blazed out against Uzza , and killed him because he had touched the Ark . And so he died there before God .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	13	11	David was angry at the Lord for what he had done to Uzza and he named the place “ The Outbreak Against Uzza. ” And it is still called that today .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	13	12	Now David was afraid of God and asked , “ How shall I ever get the Ark of God home ? ”
TLB	1%20Chronicles	13	14	The Ark remained there with the family of Obed-edom for three months , and the Lord blessed him and his family . Footnotes -

TLB	1%20Chronicles	14	14	and again David asked God what to do . The Lord replied , “ Go around by the mulberry trees and attack from there .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	14	2	David now realized why the Lord had made him king and why he had made his kingdom so great ; it was for a special reason—to give joy to God ’ s people !
TLB	1%20Chronicles	14	3	After David moved to Jerusalem , he married additional wives and became the father of many sons and daughters . 4-7 These are the names of the sons born to him in Jerusalem : Shammua , Shobab , Nathan , Solomon , Ibhar , Elishua , Elpelet , Nogah , Nepheg , Japhia , Elishama , Beeliada , Eliphelet .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	14	8	When the Philistines heard that David was Israel ’ s new king , they mobilized their forces to capture him . But David learned that they were on the way , so he called together his army .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	14	9	The Philistines were raiding the valley of Rephaim ,
TLB	1%20Chronicles	14	10	and David asked the Lord , “ If I go out and fight them , will you give me the victory ? ” And the Lord replied , “ Yes , I will. ”
TLB	1%20Chronicles	14	11	So he attacked them at Baal-perazim and wiped them out . He exulted , “ God has used me to sweep away my enemies like water bursting through a dam ! ” That is why the place has been known as Baal-perazim ever since ( meaning , “ The Place of Breaking Through ” ) .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	14	12	After the battle the Israelis picked up many idols left by the Philistines , but David ordered them burned .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	14	13	Later the Philistines raided the valley again ,
TLB	1%20Chronicles	14	15	When you hear a sound like marching in the tops of the mulberry trees , that is your signal to attack , for God will go before you and destroy the enemy. ”
TLB	1%20Chronicles	14	16	So David did as the Lord commanded him ; and he cut down the army of the Philistines all the way from Gibeon to Gezer .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	14	17	David ’ s fame spread everywhere , and the Lord caused all the nations to fear him . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	1%20Chronicles	15	1	Chronicles 15:21 were the harpists , literally , “ were to lead with zithers ( or harps ) set to the Shiminith. ” The meaning is uncertain . The Living Bible copyright ©
TLB	1%20Chronicles	15	15	Then the Levites carried the Ark on their shoulders with its carrying poles , just as the Lord had instructed Moses .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	15	2	and issued these instructions : “ When we transfer the Ark to its new home , [ a ] no one except the Levites may carry it , for God has chosen them for this purpose ; they are to minister to him forever. ”
TLB	1%20Chronicles	15	3	Then David summoned all Israel to Jerusalem to celebrate the bringing of the Ark into the new Tabernacle . 4-10 These were the priests and Levites present :
TLB	1%20Chronicles	15	120	from the clan of Kohath ; with Uriel as their leader ;
TLB	1%20Chronicles	15	220	from the clan of Merari ; with Asaiah as their leader ;
TLB	1%20Chronicles	15	130	from the clan of Gershom ; with Joel as their leader ;
TLB	1%20Chronicles	15	200	from the subclan of Elizaphan ; with Shemaiah as their leader ;
TLB	1%20Chronicles	15	80	from the subclan of Hebron ; with Eliel as their leader ;
TLB	1%20Chronicles	15	112	from the subclan of Uzziel ; with Amminadab as their leader .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	15	11	Then David called for Zadok and Abiathar , the High Priests , and for the Levite leaders : Uriel , Asaiah , Joel , Shemaiah , Eliel , and Amminadab .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	15	12	“ You are the leaders of the clans of the Levites , ” he told them . “ Now sanctify yourselves with all your brothers so that you may bring the Ark of Jehovah , the God of Israel , to the place I have prepared for it .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	15	13	The Lord destroyed us before because we handled the matter improperly—you were not carrying it. ”
TLB	1%20Chronicles	15	14	So the priests and the Levites underwent the ceremonies of sanctification in preparation for bringing home the Ark of Jehovah , the God of Israel .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	15	16	King David also ordered the Levite leaders to organize the singers into an orchestra , and they played loudly and joyously upon psaltries , harps , and cymbals .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	15	17	Heman ( son of Joel ) , Asaph ( son of Berechiah ) , and Ethan ( son of Kushaiah ) from the clan of Merari were the heads of the musicians .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	15	18	The following men were chosen as their assistants : Zechariah , Jaaziel , Shemiramoth , Jehiel , Unni , Eliab , Benaiah , Maaseiah , Mattithiah , Eliphelehu , Mikneiah , Obed-edom and Jeiel , the doorkeepers .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	15	19	Heman , Asaph , and Ethan were chosen to sound the bronze cymbals ;
TLB	1%20Chronicles	15	20	and Zechariah , Aziel , Shemiramoth , Jehiel , Unni , Eliab , Maaseiah , and Benaiah comprised an octet accompanied by harps . [ b ]
TLB	1%20Chronicles	15	21	Mattithiah , Eliphelehu , Mikneiah , Obed-edom , Jeiel , and Azaziah were the harpists . [ c ]
TLB	1%20Chronicles	15	22	The song leader was Chenaniah , the chief of the Levites , who was selected for his skill .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	15	23	Berechiah and Elkanah were guards for the Ark .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	15	24	Shebaniah , Joshaphat , Nethanel , Amasai , Zechariah , Benaiah , and Eliezer—all of whom were priests—formed a bugle corps to march at the head of the procession . And Obed-edom and Jehiah guarded the Ark .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	15	25	Then David and the elders of Israel and the high officers of the army went with great joy to the home of Obed-edom to take the Ark to Jerusalem .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	15	26	And because God didn ’ t destroy the Levites who were carrying the Ark , they sacrificed seven bulls and seven lambs .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	15	27	David , the Levites carrying the Ark , the singers , and Chenaniah the song leader were all dressed in linen robes . David also wore a linen ephod .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	15	28	So the leaders of Israel took the Ark to Jerusalem with shouts of joy , the blowing of horns and trumpets , the crashing of cymbals , and loud playing on the harps and zithers .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	15	29	( But as the Ark arrived in Jerusalem , David ’ s wife Michal , the daughter of King Saul , felt a deep disgust for David as she watched from the window and saw him dancing like a madman . ) Footnotes -

TLB	1%20Chronicles	16	16	His agreement with Abraham , And his oath to Isaac ,
TLB	1%20Chronicles	16	2	At the conclusion of these offerings David blessed the people in the name of the Lord ;
TLB	1%20Chronicles	16	3	then he gave every person present [ a ] ( men and women alike ) a loaf of bread , some wine , and a cake of raisins .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	16	4	He appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the Ark by giving constant praise and thanks to the Lord God of Israel and by asking for his blessings upon his people . These are the names of those given this assignment :
TLB	1%20Chronicles	16	5	Asaph , the leader of this detail , sounded the cymbals . His associates were Zechariah , Jeiel , Shemiramoth , Jehiel , Mattithiah , Eliab , Benaiah , Obed-edom , and Jeiel ; they played the harps and zithers .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	16	6	The priests Benaiah and Jahaziel played their trumpets regularly before the Ark .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	16	7	At that time David began the custom of using choirs in the Tabernacle to sing thanksgiving to the Lord . Asaph was the director of this choral group of priests .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	16	8	“ Oh , give thanks to the Lord and pray to him , ” they sang . “ Tell the peoples of the world About his mighty doings .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	16	9	Sing to him ; yes , sing his praises And tell of his marvelous works .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	16	10	Glory in his holy name ; Let all rejoice who seek the Lord .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	16	11	Seek the Lord ; yes , seek his strength And seek his face untiringly . 12-13 O descendants of his servant Abraham , O chosen sons of Jacob , Remember his mighty miracles And his marvelous miracles And his authority :
TLB	1%20Chronicles	16	14	He is the Lord our God ! His authority is seen throughout the earth .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	16	15	Remember his covenant forever— The words he commanded To a thousand generations :
TLB	1%20Chronicles	16	17	And his confirmation to Jacob . He promised Israel With an everlasting promise :
TLB	1%20Chronicles	16	18	‘ I will give you the land of Canaan As your inheritance. ’
TLB	1%20Chronicles	16	19	When Israel was few in number—oh , so few— And merely strangers in the Promised Land ;
TLB	1%20Chronicles	16	20	When they wandered from country to country , From one kingdom to another—
TLB	1%20Chronicles	16	21	God didn ’ t let anyone harm them . Even kings were killed who sought to hurt them .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	16	22	‘ Don ’ t harm my chosen people , ’ he declared . ‘ These are my prophets—touch them not. ’
TLB	1%20Chronicles	16	23	Sing to the Lord , O Earth , Declare each day that he is the one who saves !
TLB	1%20Chronicles	16	24	Show his glory to the nations ! Tell everyone about his miracles .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	16	25	For the Lord is great and should be highly praised ; He is to be held in awe above all gods .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	16	26	The other so-called gods are demons , But the Lord made the heavens .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	16	27	Majesty and honor march before him , Strength and gladness walk beside him .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	16	28	O people of all nations of the earth , Ascribe great strength and glory to his name !
TLB	1%20Chronicles	16	29	Yes , ascribe to the Lord The glory due his name ! Bring an offering and come before him ; Worship the Lord when clothed with holiness !
TLB	1%20Chronicles	16	30	Tremble before him , all the earth ! The world stands unmoved .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	16	31	Let the heavens be glad , the earth rejoice ; Let all the nations say , ‘ It is the Lord who reigns. ’
TLB	1%20Chronicles	16	32	Let the vast seas roar , Let the countryside and everything in it rejoice !
TLB	1%20Chronicles	16	33	Let the trees in the woods sing for joy before the Lord , For he comes to judge the earth .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	16	34	Oh , give thanks to the Lord , for he is good ; His love and his kindness go on forever .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	16	35	Cry out to him , ‘ Oh , save us , God of our salvation ; Bring us safely back from among the nations . Then we will thank your holy name , And triumph in your praise. ’
TLB	1%20Chronicles	16	36	Blessed be Jehovah , God of Israel , Forever and forevermore. ” And all the people shouted “ Amen ! ” and praised the Lord .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	16	37	David arranged for Asaph and his fellow Levites to minister regularly at the Tabernacle , [ b ] doing each day whatever needed to be done .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	16	38	This group included Obed-edom ( the son of Jeduthun ) , Hosah , and sixty-eight of their colleagues as guards .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	16	39	Meanwhile the old Tabernacle of the Lord on the hill of Gibeon continued to be active . David left Zadok the priest and his fellow priests to minister to the Lord there .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	16	40	They sacrificed burnt offerings to the Lord each morning and evening upon the altar set aside for that purpose , just as the Lord had commanded Israel .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	16	41	David also appointed Heman , Jeduthun , and several others who were chosen by name to give thanks to the Lord for his constant love and mercy .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	16	42	They used their trumpets and cymbals to accompany the singers with loud praises to God . And Jeduthun ’ s sons were appointed as guards .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	16	43	At last the celebration ended and the people returned to their homes , and David returned to bless his own household . Footnotes -

TLB	1%20Chronicles	17	1	Chronicles
TLB	1%20Chronicles	17	17	For all the great things you have already done for me are nothing in comparison to what you have promised to do in the future ! For now , O Lord God , you are speaking of future generations of my children being kings too ! You speak as though I were someone very great .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	17	2	And Nathan replied , “ Carry out your plan in every detail , for it is the will of the Lord. ”
TLB	1%20Chronicles	17	3	But that same night God said to Nathan ,
TLB	1%20Chronicles	17	4	“ Go and give my servant David this message : ‘ You are not to build my temple !
TLB	1%20Chronicles	17	5	I ’ ve gone from tent to tent as my home from the time I brought Israel out of Egypt .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	17	6	In all that time I never suggested to any of the leaders of Israel—the shepherds I appointed to care for my people—that they should build me a cedar-lined temple. ’
TLB	1%20Chronicles	17	7	“ Tell my servant David , ‘ The Lord of heaven says to you , I took you from being a shepherd and made you the king of my people .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	17	8	And I have been with you everywhere you ’ ve gone ; I have destroyed your enemies , and I will make your name as great as the greatest of the earth .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	17	9	And I will give a permanent home to my people Israel and will plant them in their land . They will not be disturbed again ; the wicked nations won ’ t conquer them as they did before
TLB	1%20Chronicles	17	10	when the judges ruled them . I will subdue all of your enemies . And I now declare that I will cause your descendants to be kings of Israel just as you are .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	17	11	“ ‘ When your time here on earth is over and you die , I will place one of your sons upon your throne ; and I will make his kingdom strong .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	17	12	He is the one who shall build me a temple , and I will establish his royal line of descent forever .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	17	13	I will be his father , and he shall be my son ; I will never remove my mercy and love from him as I did from Saul .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	17	14	I will place him over my people and over the kingdom of Israel forever—and his descendants will always be kings. ’ ”
TLB	1%20Chronicles	17	15	So Nathan told King David everything the Lord had said .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	17	16	Then King David went in and sat before the Lord and said , “ Who am I , O Lord God , and what is my family that you have given me all this ?
TLB	1%20Chronicles	17	18	What else can I say ? You know that I am but a dog , yet you have decided to honor me !
TLB	1%20Chronicles	17	19	O Lord , you have given me these wonderful promises just because you want to be kind to me , because of your own great heart .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	17	20	O Lord , there is no one like you—there is no other God . In fact , we have never even heard of another god like you !
TLB	1%20Chronicles	17	21	“ And what other nation in all the earth is like Israel ? You have made a unique nation and have redeemed it from Egypt so that the people could be your people . And you made a great name for yourself when you did glorious miracles in driving out the nations from before your people .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	17	22	You have declared that your people Israel belong to you forever , and you have become their God .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	17	23	“ And now I accept your promise , Lord , that I and my children will always rule this nation .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	17	24	And may this bring eternal honor to your name as everyone realizes that you always do what you say . They will exclaim , ‘ The Lord of heaven is indeed the God of Israel ! ’ And Israel shall always be ruled by my children and their posterity !
TLB	1%20Chronicles	17	25	Now I have the courage to pray to you , for you have revealed this to me .

TLB	1%20Chronicles	18	18	David finally subdued the Philistines and conquered Gath and its surrounding towns .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	18	2	He also conquered Moab and required its people to send him a large sum of money every year .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	18	3	He conquered the dominion of King Hadadezer of Zobah ( as far as Hamath ) at the time Hadadezer went to tighten his grip along the Euphrates River .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	18	4	David captured a thousand of his chariots , seven thousand cavalry , and twenty thousand troops . He crippled all the chariot teams except a hundred that he kept for his own use .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	18	5	When the Syrians arrived from Damascus to help King Hadadezer , David killed twenty-two thousand of them ;
TLB	1%20Chronicles	18	6	then he placed a garrison of his troops in Damascus , the Syrian capital . So the Syrians , too , were forced to send him large amounts of money every year . And the Lord gave David victory everywhere he went .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	18	7	He brought the gold shields of King Hadadezer ’ s officers to Jerusalem ,
TLB	1%20Chronicles	18	8	as well as a great amount of bronze from Hadadezer ’ s cities of Tibhath and Cun . ( King Solomon later melted the bronze and used it for the Temple . He molded it into the bronze tank , the pillars , and the instruments used in offering sacrifices on the altar . )
TLB	1%20Chronicles	18	9	When King Tou of Hamath learned that King David had destroyed Hadadezer ’ s army ,
TLB	1%20Chronicles	18	10	he sent his son Hadoram to greet and congratulate King David on his success and to present him with many gifts of gold , silver , and bronze , seeking an alliance . For Hadadezer and Tou had been enemies and there had been many wars between them .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	18	11	King David dedicated these gifts to the Lord , as he did the silver and gold he took from the nations of Edom , Moab , Ammon , Amalek , and the Philistines .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	18	12	Abishai ( son of Zeruiah ) then destroyed eighteen thousand Edomites in Salt Valley .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	18	13	He put garrisons in Edom and forced the Edomites to pay large sums of money annually to David . This is just another example of how the Lord gave David victory after victory .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	18	14	David reigned over all of Israel and was a just ruler .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	18	15	Joab ( son of Zeruiah ) was commander-in-chief of the army ; Jehoshaphat ( son of Ahilud ) was the historian ;
TLB	1%20Chronicles	18	16	Zadok ( son of Ahitub ) and Ahimelech ( son of Abiathar ) were the head priests ; Shavsha was the king ’ s special assistant ; [ a ]

TLB	1%20Chronicles	19	19	Then King Hadadezer ’ s troops surrendered to King David and became his subjects . And never again did the Syrians aid the Ammonites in their battles . The Living Bible copyright ©
TLB	1%20Chronicles	19	4	So King Hanun insulted King David ’ s ambassadors by shaving their beards and cutting their robes off at the middle to expose their buttocks ; then he sent them back to David in shame .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	19	5	When David heard what had happened , he sent a message to his embarrassed emissaries , telling them to stay at Jericho until their beards had grown out again .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	19	6	When King Hanun realized his mistake he sent $ 2,000,000 to enlist mercenary troops , chariots , and cavalry from Mesopotamia , Aram-maacah , and Zobah .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	19	7	He hired thirty-two thousand chariots , as well as the support of the king of Maacah and his entire army . These forces camped at Medeba where they were joined by the troops King Hanun had recruited from his cities .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	19	8	When David learned of this , he sent Joab and the mightiest warriors of Israel .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	19	9	The army of Ammon went out to meet them and began the battle at the gates of the city of Medeba . Meanwhile , the mercenary forces were out in the field .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	19	10	When Joab realized that the enemy forces were both in front and behind him , he divided his army and sent one group to engage the Syrians .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	19	11	The other group , under the command of his brother Abishai , moved against the Ammonites .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	19	12	“ If the Syrians are too strong for me , come and help me , ” Joab told his brother ; “ and if the Ammonites are too strong for you , I ’ ll come and help you .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	19	13	Be courageous and let us act like men to save our people and the cities of our God . And may the Lord do what is best. ”
TLB	1%20Chronicles	19	14	So Joab and his troops attacked the Syrians , and the Syrians turned and fled .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	19	15	When the Ammonites , under attack by Abishai ’ s troops , saw that the Syrians were retreating , they fled into the city . Then Joab returned to Jerusalem .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	19	16	After their defeat , the Syrians summoned additional troops from east of the Euphrates River , led personally by Shophach , King Hadadezer ’ s commander-in-chief . 17-18 When this news reached David , he mobilized all Israel , crossed the Jordan River , and engaged the enemy troops in battle . But the Syrians again fled from David , and he killed seven thousand charioteers and forty thousand of their troops . He also killed Shophach , the commander-in-chief of the Syrian army .

TLB	1%20Chronicles	20	20	The following spring ( spring was the season when wars usually began ) Joab led the Israeli army in successful attacks against the cities and villages of the people of Ammon . After destroying them , he laid siege to Rabbah and conquered it . Meanwhile , David had stayed in Jerusalem .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	20	2	When David arrived on the scene , he removed the crown from the head of King Milcom [ a ] of Rabbah and placed it upon his own head . It was made of gold inlaid with gems and weighed seventy-five pounds ! David also took great amounts of plunder from the city .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	20	3	He drove the people from the city and set them to work with saws , [ b ] iron picks , and axes , as was his custom with all the conquered Ammonite peoples . Then David and all his army returned to Jerusalem .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	20	4	The next war was against the Philistines again , at Gezer . But Sibbecai , a man from Hushath , killed one of the sons of the giant , Sippai , and so the Philistines surrendered .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	20	5	During another war with the Philistines , Elhanan ( the son of Jair ) killed Lahmi , the brother of Goliath the giant ; the handle of his spear was like a weaver ’ s beam ! 6-7 During another battle , at Gath , a giant with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot ( his father was also a giant ) defied and taunted Israel ; but he was killed by David ’ s nephew Jonathan , the son of David ’ s brother Shimea .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	20	8	These giants were descendants of the giants of Gath , and they were killed by David and his soldiers . Footnotes -

TLB	1%20Chronicles	21	1	Chronicles 21:25 $ 4,300 in gold , literally , “
TLB	1%20Chronicles	21	21	Then Ornan saw the king approaching . So he left the threshing floor and bowed to the ground before King David .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	21	2	“ Take a complete census throughout the land [ a ] and bring me the totals , ” he told Joab and the other leaders .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	21	3	But Joab objected . “ If the Lord were to multiply his people a hundred times , would they not all be yours ? So why are you asking us to do this ? Why must you cause Israel to sin ? ”
TLB	1%20Chronicles	21	4	But the king won the argument , and Joab did as he was told ; he traveled all through Israel and returned to Jerusalem .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	21	5	The total population figure which he gave came to 1,100,000 men of military age in Israel and 470,000 in Judah .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	21	6	But he didn ’ t include the tribes of Levi and Benjamin in his figures because he was so distressed at what the king had made him do .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	21	7	And God , too , was displeased with the census and punished Israel for it .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	21	8	But David said to God , “ I am the one who has sinned . Please forgive me , for I realize now how wrong I was to do this. ”
TLB	1%20Chronicles	21	9	Then the Lord said to Gad , David ’ s personal prophet , 10-11 “ Go and tell David , ‘ The Lord has offered you three choices . Which will you choose ?
TLB	1%20Chronicles	21	12	You may have three years of famine , or three months of destruction by the enemies of Israel , or three days of deadly plague as the Angel of the Lord brings destruction to the land . Think it over and let me know what answer to return to the one who sent me. ’ ”
TLB	1%20Chronicles	21	13	“ This is a terrible decision to make , ” David replied , “ but let me fall into the hands of the Lord rather than into the power of men , for God ’ s mercies are very great. ”
TLB	1%20Chronicles	21	14	So the Lord sent a plague upon Israel and 70,000 men died as a result .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	21	15	During the plague God sent an Angel to destroy Jerusalem ; but then he felt such compassion that he changed his mind and commanded the destroying Angel , “ Stop ! It is enough ! ” ( The Angel of the Lord was standing at the time by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite . )
TLB	1%20Chronicles	21	16	When David saw the Angel of the Lord standing between heaven and earth with his sword drawn , pointing toward Jerusalem , he and the elders of Israel clothed themselves in sackcloth and fell to the ground before the Lord .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	21	17	And David said to God , “ I am the one who sinned by ordering the census . But what have these sheep done ? O Lord my God , destroy me and my family , but do not destroy your people. ”
TLB	1%20Chronicles	21	18	Then the Angel of the Lord told Gad to instruct David to build an altar to the Lord at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite . 19-20 So David went to see Ornan , who was threshing wheat at the time . Ornan saw the Angel as he turned , and his four sons ran and hid .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	21	22	David said to Ornan , “ Let me buy this threshing floor from you at its full price ; then I will build an altar to the Lord and the plague will stop. ”
TLB	1%20Chronicles	21	23	“ Take it , my lord , and use it as you wish , ” Ornan said to David . “ Take the oxen , too , for burnt offerings ; use the threshing instruments for wood for the fire and use the wheat for the grain offering . I give it all to you. ”
TLB	1%20Chronicles	21	24	“ No , ” the king replied , “ I will buy it for the full price ; I can not take what is yours and give it to the Lord . I will not offer a burnt offering that has cost me nothing ! ”

TLB	1%20Chronicles	22	22	Then David said , “ Right here at Ornan ’ s threshing floor is the place where I ’ ll build the Temple of the Lord and construct the altar for Israel ’ s burnt offering ! ”
TLB	1%20Chronicles	22	2	David now drafted all the resident aliens in Israel to prepare blocks of squared stone for the Temple .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	22	3	They also manufactured iron into the great quantity of nails needed for the doors in the gates and for the clamps ; and they smelted so much bronze that it was too much to weigh .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	22	4	The men of Tyre and Sidon brought great rafts of cedar logs to David .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	22	5	“ Solomon my son is young and tender , ” David said , “ and the Temple of the Lord must be a marvelous structure , famous and glorious throughout the world ; so I will begin the preparations for it now. ” So David collected the construction materials before his death .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	22	6	He now commanded his son Solomon to build a Temple for the Lord God of Israel .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	22	7	“ I wanted to build it myself , ” David told him ,
TLB	1%20Chronicles	22	8	“ but the Lord said not to do it . ‘ You have killed too many men in great wars , ’ he told me . ‘ You have reddened the ground before me with blood : so you are not to build my Temple .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	22	9	But I will give you a son , ’ he told me , ‘ who will be a man of peace , for I will give him peace with his enemies in the surrounding lands . His name shall be Solomon ( meaning “ Peaceful ” ) , and I will give peace and quietness to Israel during his reign .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	22	10	He shall build my Temple , and he shall be as my own son and I will be his father ; and I will cause his sons and his descendants to reign over every generation of Israel. ’
TLB	1%20Chronicles	22	11	“ So now , my son , may the Lord be with you and prosper you as you do what he told you to do and build the Temple of the Lord .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	22	12	And may the Lord give you the good judgment to follow all his laws when he makes you king of Israel .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	22	13	For if you carefully obey the rules and regulations that he gave to Israel through Moses , you will prosper . Be strong and courageous , fearless and enthusiastic !
TLB	1%20Chronicles	22	14	“ By hard work I have collected several billion dollars worth of gold bullion , millions in silver , [ a ] and so much iron and bronze that I haven ’ t even weighed it ; I have also gathered timber and stone for the walls . This is at least a beginning , something with which to start .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	22	15	And you have many skilled stonemasons and carpenters and craftsmen of every kind .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	22	16	They are expert gold and silver smiths and bronze and iron workers . So get to work , and may the Lord be with you ! ”
TLB	1%20Chronicles	22	17	Then David ordered all the leaders of Israel to assist his son in this project .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	22	18	“ The Lord your God is with you , ” he declared . “ He has given you peace with the surrounding nations , for I have conquered them in the name of the Lord and for his people .

TLB	1%20Chronicles	23	23	By this time David was an old , old man , so he stepped down from the throne and appointed his son Solomon as the new king of Israel .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	23	2	He summoned all the political and religious leaders of Israel for the coronation ceremony .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	23	3	At this time a census was taken of the men of the tribe of Levi who were thirty years or older . The total came to 38,000 . 4-5 “ Twenty-four thousand of them will supervise the work at the Temple , ” David instructed , “ 6,000 are to be bailiffs and judges , 4,000 will be Temple guards , and 4,000 will praise the Lord with the musical instruments I have made. ”
TLB	1%20Chronicles	23	6	Then David divided them into three main divisions named after the sons of Levi—the

TLB	1%20Chronicles	23	18	The sons of Izhar were led by Shelomith .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	23	19	The sons of Hebron were led by Jeriah . Amariah was second in command , Jahaziel was third , and Jekameam was fourth .

TLB	1%20Chronicles	23	21	The sons of Merari were
TLB	1%20Chronicles	23	24	In the census , all the men of Levi who were twenty years old or older were classified under the names of these clans and subclans ; and they were all assigned to the ministry at the Temple .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	23	25	For David said , “ The Lord God of Israel has given us peace , and he will always live in Jerusalem .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	23	26	Now the Levites will no longer need to carry the Tabernacle and its instruments from place to place. ”
TLB	1%20Chronicles	23	27	( This census of the tribe of Levi was one of the last things David did before his death . )
TLB	1%20Chronicles	23	28	The work of the Levites was to assist the priests—the descendants of Aaron—in the sacrifices at the Temple ; they also did the custodial work and helped perform the ceremonies of purification .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	23	29	They provided the Bread of the Presence , the flour for the grain offerings , and the wafers made without yeast ( either fried or mixed with olive oil ) ; they also checked all the weights and measures .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	23	30	Each morning and evening they stood before the Lord to sing thanks and praise to him .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	23	31	They assisted in the special sacrifices of burnt offerings , the Sabbath sacrifices , the new moon celebrations , and at all the festivals . There were always as many Levites present as were required for the occasion .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	23	32	And they took care of the Tabernacle and the Temple and assisted the priests in whatever way they were needed . Footnotes -

TLB	1%20Chronicles	24	24	1-2 The priests ( the descendants of Aaron ) were placed into two divisions named after Aaron ’ s sons , Nadab and Abihu were also sons of Aaron , but they died before their father did and had no children ; so only Eleazar and Ithamar were left to carry on .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	24	3	David consulted with Zadok , who represented the Eleazar clan , and with Ahimelech , who represented the Ithamar clan ; then he divided Aaron ’ s descendants into many groups to serve at various times .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	24	4	Eleazar ’ s descendants were divided into sixteen groups and Ithamar ’ s into eight ( for there was more leadership ability among the descendants of Eleazar ) .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	24	5	All tasks were assigned to the various groups by coin-toss [ a ] so that there would be no preference , for there were many famous men and high officials of the Temple in each division .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	24	6	Shemaiah , a Levite and the son of Nethanel , acted as recording secretary and wrote down the names and assignments in the presence of the king and of these leaders : Zadok the priest , Ahimelech the son of Abiathar , and the heads of the priests and Levites . Two groups from the division of Eleazar and one from the division of Ithamar were assigned to each task . 7-18 The work was assigned ( by coin-toss ) in this order : First , the group led by Jehoiarib ; Second , the group led by Jedaiah ; Third , the group led by Harim ; Fourth , the group led by Seorim ; Fifth , the group led by Malchijah ; Sixth , the group led by Mijamin ; Seventh , the group led by Hakkoz ; Eighth , the group led by Ahijah ; Ninth , the group led by Jeshua ; Tenth , the group led by Shecaniah ; Eleventh , the group led by Eliashib ; Twelfth , the group led by Jakim ; Thirteenth , the group led by Huppah ; Fourteenth , the group led by Jeshebeab ; Fifteenth , the group led by Bilgah ; Sixteenth , the group led by Immer ; Seventeenth , the group led by Hezir ; Eighteenth , the group led by Happizzez ; Nineteenth , the group led by Pethahiah ; Twentieth , the group led by Jehezkel ; Twenty-first , the group led by Jachin ; Twenty-second , the group led by Gamul ; Twenty-third , the group led by Delaiah ; Twenty-fourth , the group led by Maaziah .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	24	19	Each group carried out the Temple duties as originally assigned by God through their ancestor Aaron .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	24	20	These were the other descendants of Levi : Amram ; his descendant Shubael ; and Shubael ’ s descendant Jehdeiah ;
TLB	1%20Chronicles	24	21	the Rehabiah group , led by his oldest son Isshiah ;
TLB	1%20Chronicles	24	22	the Izhar group , consisting of Shelamoth and his descendant Jahath .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	24	23	The Hebron group : Jeriah , Hebron ’ s oldest son ; Amariah , his second son ; Jahaziel , his third son ; Jekameam , his fourth son . 24-25 The Uzziel group was led by his son Micah and his grandsons Shamir and Isshiah , and by Isshiah ’ s son Zechariah . 26-27 The Merari group was led by his sons : These were the descendants of Levi in their various clans .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	24	31	Like the descendants of Aaron , they were assigned to their duties by coin-toss without distinction as to age or rank . It was done in the presence of King David , Zadok , Ahimelech , and the leaders of the priests and the Levites . Footnotes -

TLB	1%20Chronicles	28	28	David now summoned all of his officials to Jerusalem—the political leaders , the commanders of the twelve army divisions , the other army officers , those in charge of his property and livestock , and all the other men of authority in his kingdom .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	28	2	He rose and stood before them and addressed them as follows : “ My brothers and my people ! It was my desire to build a temple in which the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord could rest—a place for our God to live in . [ a ] I have now collected everything that is necessary for the building ,
TLB	1%20Chronicles	28	3	but God has told me , ‘ You are not to build my temple , for you are a warrior and have shed much blood. ’
TLB	1%20Chronicles	28	4	“ Nevertheless , the Lord God of Israel has chosen me from among all my father ’ s family to begin a dynasty that will rule Israel forever ; he has chosen the tribe of Judah , and from among the families of Judah , my father ’ s family ; and from among his sons , the Lord took pleasure in me and has made me king over all Israel .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	28	5	And from among my sons—the Lord has given me many children—he has chosen Solomon to succeed me on the throne of his kingdom of Israel .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	28	6	He has told me , ‘ Your son Solomon shall build my Temple ; for I have chosen him as my son and I will be his father .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	28	7	And if he continues to obey my commandments and instructions as he has until now , I will make his kingdom last forever. ’ ”
TLB	1%20Chronicles	28	8	Then David turned to Solomon and said : [ b ] “ Here before the leaders of Israel , the people of God , and in the sight of our God , I am instructing you to search out every commandment of the Lord so that you may continue to rule this good land and leave it to your children to rule forever .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	28	9	Solomon , my son , get to know the God of your fathers . Worship and serve him with a clean heart and a willing mind , for the Lord sees every heart and understands and knows every thought . If you seek him , you will find him ; but if you forsake him , he will permanently throw you aside .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	28	10	So be very careful , for the Lord has chosen you to build his holy Temple . Be strong and do as he commands. ”
TLB	1%20Chronicles	28	11	Then David gave Solomon the blueprint of the Temple and its surroundings—the treasuries , the upstairs rooms , the inside rooms , and the sanctuary for the place of mercy .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	28	12	He also gave Solomon his plans for the outer court , the outside rooms , the Temple storage areas , and the treasuries for the gifts dedicated by famous persons . For the Holy Spirit had given David all these plans .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	28	13	The king also passed on to Solomon the instructions concerning the work of the various groups of priests and Levites ; and he gave specifications for each item in the Temple which was to be used for worship and sacrifice .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	28	14	David weighed out enough gold and silver to make these various items ,
TLB	1%20Chronicles	28	15	as well as the specific amount of gold needed for the lampstands and lamps . He also weighed out enough silver for the silver candlesticks and lamps , each according to its use .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	28	16	He weighed out the gold for the table on which the Bread of the Presence would be placed and for the other gold tables , and he weighed the silver for the silver tables .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	28	17	Then he weighed out the gold for the solid gold hooks used in handling the sacrificial meat and for the basins , cups , and bowls of gold and silver .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	28	18	Finally , he weighed out the refined gold for the altar of incense and for the gold Guardian Angels whose wings were stretched over the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	28	19	“ Every part of this blueprint , ” David told Solomon , “ was given to me in writing from the hand of the Lord. ”
TLB	1%20Chronicles	28	20	Then he continued , “ Be strong and courageous and get to work . Don ’ t be frightened by the size of the task , for the Lord my God is with you ; he will not forsake you . He will see to it that everything is finished correctly .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	28	21	And these various groups of priests and Levites will serve in the Temple . Others with skills of every kind will volunteer , and the army and the entire nation are at your command. ” Footnotes -

TLB	1%20Chronicles	29	2	Using every resource at my command , I have gathered as much as I could for building it—enough gold , silver , bronze , iron , wood , and great quantities of onyx , other precious stones , costly jewels , and marble .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	29	3	And now , because of my devotion to the Temple of God , I am giving all of my own private treasures to aid in the construction . This is in addition to the building materials I have already collected . 4-5 These personal contributions consist of millions of dollars of gold from Ophir and huge amounts of silver to be used for overlaying the walls of the buildings . It will also be used for the articles made of gold and silver and for the artistic decorations . Now then , who will follow my example ? Who will give himself and all that he has to the Lord ? ” 6-7 Then the clan leaders , the heads of the tribes , the army officers , and the administrative officers of the king pledged huge sums of gold , silver , and foreign currency , also
TLB	1%20Chronicles	29	675	tons of bronze and 3,750 tons of iron .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	29	8	They also contributed great amounts of jewelry , which were deposited at the Temple treasury with Jehiel ( a descendant of Gershom ) .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	29	9	Everyone was excited and happy for this opportunity of service , and King David was moved with deep joy .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	29	10	While still in the presence of the whole assembly , David expressed his praises to the Lord : “ O Lord God of our father Israel , praise your name for ever and ever !
TLB	1%20Chronicles	29	11	Yours is the mighty power and glory and victory and majesty . Everything in the heavens and earth is yours , O Lord , and this is your kingdom . We adore you as being in control of everything .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	29	12	Riches and honor come from you alone , and you are the ruler of all mankind ; your hand controls power and might , and it is at your discretion that men are made great and given strength .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	29	13	O our God , we thank you and praise your glorious name ,
TLB	1%20Chronicles	29	14	but who am I and who are my people that we should be permitted to give anything to you ? Everything we have has come from you , and we only give you what is yours already !
TLB	1%20Chronicles	29	15	For we are here for but a moment , strangers in the land as our fathers were before us ; our days on earth are like a shadow , gone so soon , without a trace .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	29	16	O Lord our God , all of this material that we have gathered to build a temple for your holy name comes from you ! It all belongs to you !
TLB	1%20Chronicles	29	17	I know , my God , that you test men to see if they are good ; for you enjoy good men . I have done all this with good motives , and I have watched your people offer their gifts willingly and joyously .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	29	18	“ O Lord , God of our fathers Abraham , Isaac , and Israel ! Make your people always want to obey you , and see to it that their love for you never changes .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	29	19	Give my son Solomon a good heart toward God , so that he will want to obey you in the smallest detail and will look forward eagerly to finishing the building of your Temple , for which I have made all of these preparations. ”
TLB	1%20Chronicles	29	20	Then David said to all the people , “ Give praise to the Lord your God ! ” And they did , bowing low before the Lord and the king .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	29	21	The next day they brought a thousand young bulls , a thousand rams , and a thousand lambs as burnt offerings to the Lord ; they also offered drink offerings and many other sacrifices on behalf of all Israel .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	29	22	Then they feasted and drank before the Lord with great joy . And again [ a ] they crowned King David ’ s son Solomon as their king . They anointed him before the Lord as their leader , and they anointed Zadok as their priest .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	29	23	So God appointed Solomon to take the throne of his father David ; and he prospered greatly , and all Israel obeyed him .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	29	24	The national leaders , the army officers , and his brothers all pledged their allegiance to King Solomon .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	29	25	And the Lord gave him great popularity with all the people of Israel , and he amassed even greater wealth and honor than his father . 26-27 David was king of the land of Israel for forty years ; seven of them during his reign in Hebron and thirty-three in Jerusalem .
TLB	1%20Chronicles	29	28	He died at an old age , wealthy and honored ; and his son Solomon reigned in his place .

TLB	2%20Chronicles	1	1	King David ’ s son Solomon was now the undisputed ruler of Israel , for the Lord his God had made him a powerful monarch . 2-3 He summoned all the army officers and judges to Gibeon [ a ] as well as all the political and religious leaders of Israel . He led them up the hill to the old Tabernacle constructed by Moses , the Lord ’ s assistant , while he was in the wilderness .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	1	4	( There was a later Tabernacle in Jerusalem , built by King David for the Ark of God when he removed it from Kiriath-jearim . ) 5-6 The bronze altar made by Bezalel ( son of Uri , son of Hur ) still stood in front of the old Tabernacle , and now Solomon and those he had invited assembled themselves before it , as he sacrificed upon it 1,000 burnt offerings to the Lord .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	1	7	That night God appeared to Solomon and told him , “ Ask me for anything , and I will give it to you ! ”
TLB	2%20Chronicles	1	8	Solomon replied , “ O God , you have been so kind and good to my father David , and now you have given me the kingdom—
TLB	2%20Chronicles	1	9	this is all I want ! For you have fulfilled your promise to David my father and have made me king over a nation as full of people as the earth is full of dust !
TLB	2%20Chronicles	1	10	Now give me wisdom and knowledge to rule them properly , for who is able to govern by himself such a great nation as this one of yours ? ”
TLB	2%20Chronicles	1	11	God replied , “ Because your greatest desire is to help your people , and you haven ’ t asked for personal wealth and honor , and you haven ’ t asked me to curse your enemies , and you haven ’ t asked for a long life , but for wisdom and knowledge to properly guide my people—
TLB	2%20Chronicles	1	12	yes , I am giving you the wisdom and knowledge you asked for ! And I am also giving you riches , wealth , and honor such as no other king has ever had before you ! And there will never again be so great a king in all the world ! ”
TLB	2%20Chronicles	1	13	Solomon then left the Tabernacle , returned down the hill , and went back to Jerusalem to rule Israel .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	1	14	He built up a huge force of 1,400 chariots and recruited 12,000 cavalry to guard the cities where the chariots were garaged , though some , of course , were stationed at Jerusalem near the king .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	1	15	During Solomon ’ s reign , silver and gold were as plentiful in Jerusalem as rocks on the road ! And expensive cedar lumber was used like common sycamore !
TLB	2%20Chronicles	1	16	Solomon sent horse traders to Egypt to purchase entire herds at wholesale prices .

For God wants Israel always to celebrate these special occasions .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	2	5	It is going to be a wonderful temple because he is a great God , greater than any other .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	2	6	But who can ever build him a worthy home ? Not even the highest heaven would be beautiful enough ! And who am I to be allowed to build a temple for God ? But it will be a place to worship him . [ a ]
TLB	2%20Chronicles	2	7	“ So send me skilled craftsmen—goldsmiths and silversmiths , brass and iron workers ; and send me weavers to make purple , crimson , and blue cloth ; and skilled engravers to work beside the craftsmen of Judah and Jerusalem who were selected by my father David .

TLB	2%20Chronicles	2	9	An immense amount of lumber will be needed , for the temple I am going to build will be large and incredibly beautiful .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	2	10	As to the financial arrangements , I will pay your men 20,000 sacks of crushed wheat , 20,000 barrels of barley , 20,000 barrels of wine , and 20,000 barrels of olive oil. ”
TLB	2%20Chronicles	2	11	King Hiram replied to King Solomon : “ It is because the Lord loves his people that he has made you their king !
TLB	2%20Chronicles	2	12	Blessed be the Lord God of Israel who made the heavens and the earth and who has given to David such a wise , intelligent , and understanding son to build God ’ s Temple and a royal palace for himself .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	2	13	“ I am sending you a master craftsman—my famous Huramabi ! He is a brilliant man ,
TLB	2%20Chronicles	2	14	the son of a Jewish woman from Dan in Israel ; his father is from here in Tyre . He is a skillful goldsmith and silversmith , and also does exquisite work with brass and iron and knows all about stonework , carpentry , and weaving ; and he is an expert in the dyeing of purple and blue linen and crimson cloth . He is an engraver besides , and an inventor ! He will work with your craftsmen and those appointed by my lord David , your father .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	2	15	So send along the wheat , barley , olive oil , and wine you mentioned ,
TLB	2%20Chronicles	2	16	and we will begin cutting wood from the Lebanon mountains , as much as you need , and bring it to you in log floats across the sea to Joppa , and from there you can take them inland to Jerusalem. ”
TLB	2%20Chronicles	2	17	Solomon now took a census of all foreigners in the country ( just as his father David had done ) and found that there were 153,600 of them .

TLB	2%20Chronicles	4	45	feet around .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	4	3	The tank was encircled at its base by two rows of gourd designs , cast as part of the tank .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	4	5	The walls of the tank were five inches thick , flaring out like the cup of a lily . It held 3,000 barrels of water .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	4	6	He also constructed ten vats for water to wash the offerings , five to the right of the huge tank and five to the left . The priests used the tank , and not the vats , for their own washing .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	4	7	Carefully following God ’ s instructions , he then cast ten gold lampstands and placed them in the Temple , five against each wall ;
TLB	2%20Chronicles	4	8	he also built ten tables and placed five against each wall on the right and left . And he molded
TLB	2%20Chronicles	4	100	solid gold bowls .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	4	9	Then he constructed a court for the priests , also the public court , and overlaid the doors of these courts with bronze .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	4	10	The huge tank was in the southeast corner of the outer room of the Temple .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	4	11	Huramabi also made the necessary pots , shovels , and basins for use in connection with the sacrifices . So at last he completed the work assigned to him by King Solomon : 12-16 The construction of the two pillars , The two flared capitals on the tops of the pillars , The two sets of chains on the capitals , The
TLB	2%20Chronicles	4	400	pomegranates hanging from the two sets of chains on the capitals , The bases for the vats and the vats themselves , The huge tank and the twelve oxen under it , The pots , shovels , and fleshhooks . This skillful craftsman , Huramabi , made all of the above-mentioned items for King Solomon using polished bronze . 17-18 The king did the casting at the claybanks of the Jordan Valley between Succoth and Zeredah . Great quantities of bronze were used , too heavy to weigh .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	4	19	Solomon commanded that all of the furnishings of the Temple—the utensils , the altar , and the table for the Bread of the Presence must be made of gold ;
TLB	2%20Chronicles	4	20	also the lamps and lampstands ,
TLB	2%20Chronicles	4	21	the floral decorations , tongs ,
TLB	2%20Chronicles	4	22	lamp snuffers , basins , spoons , and firepans—all were made of solid gold . Even the doorway of the Temple , the main door , and the inner doors to the Holy of Holies were overlaid with gold . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	2%20Chronicles	5	5	So the Temple was finally finished . Then Solomon brought in the gifts dedicated to the Lord by his father , King David . They were stored in the Temple treasuries .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	5	3	This celebration took place in October at the annual Festival of Tabernacles . 4-5 As the leaders of Israel watched , the Levites lifted the Ark and carried it out of the Tabernacle , along with all the other sacred vessels .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	5	6	King Solomon and the others sacrificed sheep and oxen before the Ark in such numbers that no one tried to keep count ! 7-8 Then the priests carried the Ark into the inner room of the Temple—the Holy of Holies—and placed it beneath the wings of the Guardian Angels ; their wings spread over the Ark and its carrying poles .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	5	9	These carrying poles were so long that their ends could be seen from the outer room , but not from the outside doorway . The Ark is still there at the time of this writing .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	5	10	Nothing was in the Ark except the two stone tablets that Moses had put there at Mount Horeb , when the Lord made a covenant with the people of Israel as they were leaving Egypt . 11-12 When the priests had undergone the purification rites for themselves , they all took part in the ceremonies without regard to their normal duties . And how the Levites were praising the Lord as the priests came out of the Holy of Holies ! The singers were Asaph , Heman , Jeduthun , and all their sons and brothers , dressed in finespun linen robes and standing at the east side of the altar . The choir was accompanied by
TLB	2%20Chronicles	5	120	priests who were trumpeters , while others played the cymbals , lyres , and harps . 13-14 The band and chorus united as one to praise and thank the Lord ; their selections were interspersed with trumpet obbligatos , the clashing of cymbals , and the loud playing of other musical instruments—all praising and thanking the Lord . Their theme was “ He is so good ! His loving-kindness lasts forever ! ” And at that moment the glory of the Lord , coming as a bright cloud , filled the Temple so that the priests could not continue their work . Footnotes -

TLB	2%20Chronicles	6	6	1-2 This is the prayer prayed by Solomon on that occasion : “ The Lord has said that he would live in the thick darkness , But I have made a Temple for you , O Lord , to live in forever ! ”
TLB	2%20Chronicles	6	3	Then the king turned around to the people and they stood to receive his blessing :
TLB	2%20Chronicles	6	4	“ Blessed be the Lord God of Israel , ” he said to them , “ the God who talked personally to my father David and has now fulfilled the promise he made to him . For he told him , 5-6 ‘ I have never before , since bringing my people from the land of Egypt , chosen a city anywhere in Israel as the location of my Temple where my name will be glorified ; and never before have I chosen a king for my people Israel . But now I have chosen Jerusalem as that city , and David as that king. ’
TLB	2%20Chronicles	6	7	“ My father David wanted to build this Temple ,
TLB	2%20Chronicles	6	8	but the Lord said not to . It was good to have the desire , the Lord told him ,
TLB	2%20Chronicles	6	9	but he was not the one to build it : his son was chosen for that task .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	6	10	And now the Lord has done what he promised , for I have become king in my father ’ s place , and I have built the Temple for the name of the Lord God of Israel
TLB	2%20Chronicles	6	11	and placed the Ark there . And in the Ark is the Covenant between the Lord and his people Israel. ” 12-13 As he spoke , Solomon was standing before the people on a platform in the center of the outer court , in front of the altar of the Lord . The platform was made of bronze , 7-1/2 feet square and 4-1/2 feet high . Now , as all the people watched , he knelt down , reached out his arms toward heaven , and prayed this prayer :
TLB	2%20Chronicles	6	14	“ O Lord God of Israel , there is no God like you in all of heaven and earth . You are the God who keeps his kind promises to all those who obey you and who are anxious to do your will .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	6	15	And you have kept your promise to my father David , [ a ] as is evident today .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	6	16	And now , O God of Israel , carry out your further promise to him that ‘ your descendants shall always reign over Israel if they will obey my laws as you have. ’
TLB	2%20Chronicles	6	17	Yes , Lord God of Israel , please fulfill this promise too .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	6	18	But will God really live upon the earth with men ? Why , even the heaven and the heaven of heavens can not contain you—how much less this Temple I have built !
TLB	2%20Chronicles	6	19	“ How I pray that you will heed my prayers , O Lord my God ! Listen to my prayer that I am praying to you now ! 20-21 Look down with favor day and night upon this Temple—upon this place where you have said that you would put your name . May you always hear and answer the prayers I will pray to you as I face toward this place . Listen to my prayers and to those of your people Israel when they pray toward this Temple ; yes , hear us from heaven , and when you hear , forgive .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	6	22	“ Whenever someone commits a crime and is required to swear to his innocence before this altar ,
TLB	2%20Chronicles	6	23	then hear from heaven and punish him if he is lying , or else declare him innocent .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	6	24	“ If your people Israel are destroyed before their enemies because they have sinned against you , and if they turn to you and call themselves your people , and pray to you here in this Temple ,
TLB	2%20Chronicles	6	25	then listen to them from heaven and forgive their sins and give them back this land you gave to their fathers .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	6	26	“ When the skies are shut and there is no rain because of our sins , and then we pray toward this Temple and claim you as our God , and turn from our sins because you have punished us ,
TLB	2%20Chronicles	6	27	then listen from heaven and forgive the sins of your people , and teach them what is right ; and send rain upon this land that you have given to your people as their own property .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	6	28	“ If there is a famine in the land , or plagues , or crop disease , or attacks of locusts or caterpillars , or if your people ’ s enemies are in the land besieging our cities—whatever the trouble is—
TLB	2%20Chronicles	6	29	listen to every individual ’ s prayer concerning his private sorrow , as well as all the public prayers .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	6	30	Hear from heaven where you live and forgive , and give each one whatever he deserves , for you know the hearts of all mankind .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	6	31	Then they will reverence you forever and will continually walk where you tell them to go . [ b ]
TLB	2%20Chronicles	6	32	“ And when foreigners hear of your power , and come from distant lands to worship your great name , and to pray toward this Temple ,
TLB	2%20Chronicles	6	33	hear them from heaven where you live , and do what they request of you . Then all the peoples of the earth will hear of your fame and will reverence you , just as your people Israel do ; and they too will know that this Temple I have built is truly yours .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	6	34	“ If your people go out at your command to fight their enemies , and they pray toward this city of Jerusalem that you have chosen , and this Temple that I have built for your name ,
TLB	2%20Chronicles	6	35	then hear their prayers from heaven and give them success .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	6	36	“ If they sin against you ( and who has never sinned ? ) and you become angry with them , and you let their enemies defeat them and take them away as captives to some foreign nation near or far ; 37-38 and if in that land of exile they turn to you again , and face toward this land you gave their fathers and this city and your Temple I have built , and plead with you with all their hearts to forgive them ,
TLB	2%20Chronicles	6	39	then hear from heaven where you live and help them , and forgive your people who have sinned against you .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	6	40	“ Yes , O my God , be wide awake and attentive to all the prayers made to you in this place .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	6	41	And now , O Lord God , arise and enter this resting place of yours where the Ark of your strength has been placed . Let your priests , O Lord God , be clothed with salvation , and let your people rejoice in your kind deeds .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	6	42	O Lord God , do not ignore me—do not turn your face away from me , your anointed one . Oh , remember your love for David and your kindness to him. ” Footnotes -

TLB	2%20Chronicles	7	7	he sent the people home , joyful and happy because the Lord had been so good to David and Solomon and to his people Israel .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	7	3	All the people had been watching , and now they fell flat on the pavement and worshiped and thanked the Lord . “ How good he is ! ” they exclaimed . “ He is always so loving and kind. ” 4-5 Then the king and all the people dedicated the Temple by sacrificing burnt offerings to the Lord . King Solomon ’ s contribution for this purpose was 22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	7	6	The priests were standing at their posts of duty , and the Levites were playing their thanksgiving song , “ His Loving-Kindness Is Forever , ” using the musical instruments King David himself had made and had used to praise the Lord . Then , when the priests blew the trumpets , all the people stood again .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	7	8	For the next seven days they celebrated the Tabernacle Festival , with large crowds coming in from all over Israel ; they arrived from as far away as Hamath at one end of the country to the brook of Egypt at the other .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	7	9	A final religious service was held on the eighth day .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	7	10	Then on October
TLB	2%20Chronicles	7	11	So Solomon finished building the Temple as well as his own palace . He completed what he had planned to do .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	7	12	One night the Lord appeared to Solomon and told him , “ I have heard your prayer and have chosen this Temple as the place where I want you to sacrifice to me .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	7	13	If I shut up the heavens so that there is no rain , or if I command the locust swarms to eat up all of your crops , or if I send an epidemic among you ,
TLB	2%20Chronicles	7	14	then if my people will humble themselves and pray , and search for me , and turn from their wicked ways , I will hear them from heaven and forgive their sins and heal their land .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	7	15	I will listen , wide awake , to every prayer made in this place .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	7	16	For I have chosen this Temple and sanctified it to be my home forever ; my eyes and my heart shall always be here .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	7	17	“ As for yourself , if you follow me as your father David did ,
TLB	2%20Chronicles	7	18	then I will see to it that you and your descendants will always be the kings of Israel ;
TLB	2%20Chronicles	7	19	but if you don ’ t follow me , if you refuse the laws I have given you and worship idols ,
TLB	2%20Chronicles	7	20	then I will destroy my people from this land of mine that I have given them , and this Temple shall be destroyed even though I have sanctified it for myself . Instead , I will make it a public horror and disgrace .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	7	21	Instead of its being famous , all who pass by will be incredulous . “ ‘ Why has the Lord done such a terrible thing to this land and to this Temple ? ’ they will ask .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	7	22	“ And the answer will be , ‘ Because his people abandoned the Lord God of their fathers , the God who brought them out of the land of Egypt , and they worshiped other gods instead . That is why he has done all this to them. ’ ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	2%20Chronicles	8	2	He now turned his energies to rebuilding the cities that King Hiram of Tyre had given to him , and he relocated some of the people of Israel into them .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	8	8	It was now twenty years since Solomon had become king , and the great building projects of the Lord ’ s Temple and his own royal palace were completed .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	8	3	It was at this time , too , that Solomon fought against the city of Hamath-zobah and conquered it .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	8	4	He built Tadmor in the desert and built cities in Hamath as supply centers .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	8	5	He fortified the cities of upper Beth-horon and lower Beth-horon , both being supply centers , building their walls and installing barred gates .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	8	6	He also built Baalath and other supply centers at this time and constructed cities where his chariots and horses were kept . He built to his heart ’ s desire in Jerusalem and Lebanon and throughout the entire realm . 7-8 He began the practice that still continues of conscripting as slave laborers the Hittites , Amorites , Perizzites , Hivites , and Jebusites—the descendants of those nations that the Israelis had not completely wiped out .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	8	9	However , he didn ’ t make slaves of any of the Israeli citizens , but used them as soldiers , officers , charioteers , and cavalrymen ;
TLB	2%20Chronicles	8	10	also ,
TLB	2%20Chronicles	8	250	of them were government officials who administered all public affairs .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	8	11	Solomon now moved his wife ( she was Pharaoh ’ s daughter ) from the City of David sector of Jerusalem to the new palace he had built for her . For he said , “ She must not live in King David ’ s palace for the Ark of the Lord was there , and it is holy ground. ”
TLB	2%20Chronicles	8	12	Then Solomon sacrificed burnt offerings to the Lord on the altar he had built in front of the porch of the Temple .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	8	13	The number of sacrifices differed from day to day in accordance with the instructions Moses had given ; there were extra sacrifices on the Sabbaths , on new moon festivals , and at the three annual festivals—the Passover celebration , the Festival of Weeks , and the Festival of Tabernacles .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	8	14	In assigning the priests to their posts of duty he followed the organizational chart prepared by his father David ; he also assigned the Levites to their work of praise and of helping the priests in each day ’ s duties ; and he assigned the gatekeepers to their gates .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	8	15	Solomon did not deviate in any way from David ’ s instructions concerning these matters and concerning the treasury personnel .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	8	16	Thus Solomon successfully completed the construction of the Temple . 17-18 Then he went to the seaport towns of Ezion-geber and Eloth , in Edom , to launch a fleet presented to him by King Hiram . These ships , with King Hiram ’ s experienced crews working alongside Solomon ’ s men , went to Ophir and brought back to him several million dollars worth of gold on each trip !

TLB	2%20Chronicles	9	2	And Solomon answered all her problems . Nothing was hidden from him ; he could explain everything to her .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	9	9	She gave the king a gift of over a million dollars in gold , and great quantities of spices of incomparable quality , and many , many jewels .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	9	3	When she discovered how wise he really was , and how breathtaking the beauty of his palace ,
TLB	2%20Chronicles	9	4	and how wonderful the food at his tables , and how many servants and aides he had , and when she saw their spectacular uniforms and his stewards in full regalia , and saw the size of the men in his bodyguard , she could scarcely believe it !
TLB	2%20Chronicles	9	5	Finally she exclaimed to the king , “ Everything I heard about you in my own country is true !
TLB	2%20Chronicles	9	6	I didn ’ t believe it until I got here and saw it with my own eyes . Your wisdom is far greater than I could ever have imagined .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	9	7	What a privilege for these men of yours to stand here and listen to you talk !
TLB	2%20Chronicles	9	8	Blessed be the Lord your God ! How he must love Israel to give them a just king like you ! He wants them to be a great , strong nation forever. ”
TLB	2%20Chronicles	9	10	King Hiram ’ s and King Solomon ’ s crews brought gold from Ophir , also sandalwood and jewels .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	9	11	The king used the sandalwood to make terraced steps for the Temple and the palace and to construct harps and lyres for the choir . Never before had there been such beautiful instruments in all the land of Judah .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	9	12	King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba gifts of the same value as she had brought to him , plus everything else she asked for ! Then she and her retinue returned to their own land . 13-14 Solomon received a quarter of a billion dollars worth of gold each year from the kings of Arabia and many other lands that paid annual tribute to him . In addition , there was a trade balance from the exports of his merchants .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	9	15	He used some of the gold to make
TLB	2%20Chronicles	9	200	large shields , each worth $ 100,000 ,
TLB	2%20Chronicles	9	16	and
TLB	2%20Chronicles	9	300	smaller shields , each worth $ 50,000 . The king placed these in the Forest of Lebanon Room in his palace .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	9	17	He also made a huge ivory throne overlaid with pure gold .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	9	18	It had six gold steps and a footstool of gold ; also gold armrests , each flanked by a gold lion .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	9	19	Gold lions also stood at each side of each step . No other throne in all the world could be compared with it !
TLB	2%20Chronicles	9	20	All of King Solomon ’ s cups were solid gold , as were all the furnishings in the Forest of Lebanon Room . Silver was too cheap to count for much in those days !
TLB	2%20Chronicles	9	21	Every three years the king sent his ships to Tarshish , using sailors supplied by King Hiram , to bring back gold , silver , ivory , apes , and peacocks .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	9	22	So King Solomon was richer and wiser than any other king in all the earth .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	9	23	Kings from every nation came to visit him and to hear the wisdom God had put into his heart .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	9	24	Each brought him annual tribute of silver and gold bowls , clothing , armor , spices , horses , and mules .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	9	25	In addition , Solomon had 4,000 stalls of horses and chariots , and 12,000 cavalrymen stationed in the chariot cities as well as in Jerusalem to protect the king .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	9	26	He ruled over all kings and kingdoms from the Euphrates River to the land of the Philistines and as far away as the border of Egypt .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	9	27	He made silver become as plentiful in Jerusalem as stones in the road ! And cedar was used as though it were common sycamore .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	9	28	Horses were brought to him from Egypt and other countries .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	9	29	The rest of Solomon ’ s biography is written in the history of Nathan the prophet and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite , and also in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	9	30	So Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all of Israel for forty years .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	9	31	Then he died and was buried in Jerusalem , and his son Rehoboam became the new king . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	2%20Chronicles	10	2	Chronicles 10:15 to fulfill his prediction , see
TLB	2%20Chronicles	10	10	“ No ! ” they replied . “ Tell them , ‘ If you think my father was hard on you , just wait and see what I ’ ll be like ! ’ Tell them , ‘ My little finger is thicker than my father ’ s loins !
TLB	2%20Chronicles	10	4	“ Your father was a hard master , ” they said . “ Be easier on us than he was , and we will let you be our king ! ”
TLB	2%20Chronicles	10	5	Rehoboam told them to return in three days for his decision .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	10	6	He discussed their demand with the old men who had counseled his father Solomon . “ What shall I tell them ? ” he asked .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	10	7	“ If you want to be their king , ” they replied , “ you will have to give them a favorable reply and treat them with kindness. ” 8-9 But he rejected their advice and asked the opinion of the young men who had grown up with him . “ What do you fellows think I should do ? ” he asked . “ Shall I be easier on them than my father was ? ”
TLB	2%20Chronicles	10	11	I am going to be tougher on you , not easier ! My father used whips on you , but I ’ ll use scorpions ! ’ ”
TLB	2%20Chronicles	10	12	So when Jeroboam and the people returned in three days to hear King Rehoboam ’ s decision ,
TLB	2%20Chronicles	10	13	he spoke roughly to them ; for he refused the advice of the old men
TLB	2%20Chronicles	10	14	and followed the counsel of the younger ones . “ My father gave you heavy burdens , but I will give you heavier ! ” he told them . “ My father punished you with whips , but I will punish you with scorpions ! ”
TLB	2%20Chronicles	10	15	So the king turned down the people ’ s demands . ( God caused him to do it in order to fulfill his prediction [ a ] spoken to Jeroboam by Ahijah the Shilonite . )
TLB	2%20Chronicles	10	16	When the people realized what the king was saying , they turned their backs and deserted him . “ Forget David and his dynasty ! ” they shouted angrily . “ We ’ ll get someone else to be our king . Let Rehoboam rule his own tribe of Judah ! Let ’ s go home ! ” So they did .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	10	17	The people of the tribe of Judah , however , remained loyal to Rehoboam .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	10	18	Afterwards , when King Rehoboam sent Hadoram to draft forced labor from the other tribes of Israel , the people stoned him to death . When this news reached King Rehoboam , he jumped into his chariot and fled to Jerusalem .

TLB	2%20Chronicles	11	11	He also rebuilt and strengthened the forts , and manned them with companies of soldiers under their officers , and stored them with food , olive oil , and wine .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	11	3	“ Go and say to King Rehoboam of Judah , Solomon ’ s son , and to the people of Judah and of Benjamin :
TLB	2%20Chronicles	11	4	“ ‘ The Lord says , Do not fight against your brothers . Go home , for I am behind their rebellion. ’ ” So they obeyed the Lord and refused to fight against Jeroboam . 5-10 Rehoboam stayed in Jerusalem and fortified these cities of Judah with walls and gates to protect himself : Bethlehem , Etam , Tekoa , Beth-zur , Soco , Adullam , Gath , Mareshah , Ziph , Adoraim , Lachish , Azekah , Zorah , Aijalon , and Hebron .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	11	12	Shields and spears were placed in armories in every city as a further safety measure . For only Judah and Benjamin remained loyal to him . 13-14 However , the priests and Levites from the other tribes now abandoned their homes and moved to Judah and Jerusalem , for King Jeroboam had fired them , telling them to stop being priests of the Lord .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	11	15	He had appointed other priests instead who encouraged the people to worship idols instead of God and to sacrifice to carved statues of goats and calves , which he placed on the hills .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	11	16	Laymen , too , from all over Israel began moving to Jerusalem where they could freely worship the Lord God of their fathers and sacrifice to him .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	11	17	This strengthened the kingdom of Judah , so King Rehoboam survived for three years without difficulty ; for during those years there was an earnest effort to obey the Lord as King David and King Solomon had done . [ a ]
TLB	2%20Chronicles	11	18	Rehoboam married his cousin [ b ] Mahalath . She was the daughter of David ’ s son Jerimoth and of Abihail , the daughter of David ’ s brother Eliab .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	11	19	Three sons were born from this marriage—Jeush , Shemariah , and Zaham .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	11	20	Later he married Maacah , the daughter of Absalom . The children she bore him were Abijah , Attai , Ziza , and Shelomith .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	11	21	He loved Maacah more than any of his other wives and concubines ( he had eighteen wives and sixty concubines—with twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters ) .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	11	22	Maacah ’ s son Abijah was his favorite , and he intended to make him the next king .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	11	23	He very wisely scattered his other sons in the fortified cities throughout the land of Judah and Benjamin , and gave them large allowances and arranged for them to have several wives apiece . Footnotes -

TLB	2%20Chronicles	12	2	As a result , King Shishak of Egypt attacked Jerusalem in the fifth year of King Rehoboam ’ s reign
TLB	2%20Chronicles	12	12	When the king humbled himself , the Lord ’ s anger was turned aside and he didn ’ t send total destruction ; in fact , even after Shishak ’ s invasion , the economy of Judah remained strong .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	12	3	with 1,200 chariots , 60,000 cavalrymen and an unnumbered host of infantrymen—Egyptians , Libyans , Sukkiim , and Ethiopians .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	12	4	He quickly conquered Judah ’ s fortified cities and soon arrived at Jerusalem .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	12	5	The prophet Shemaiah now met with Rehoboam and the Judean leaders from every part of the nation ( they had fled to Jerusalem for safety ) and told them , “ The Lord says , ‘ You have forsaken me , so I have forsaken you and abandoned you to Shishak. ’ ”
TLB	2%20Chronicles	12	6	Then the king and the leaders of Israel confessed their sins and exclaimed , “ The Lord is right in doing this to us ! ”
TLB	2%20Chronicles	12	7	And when the Lord saw them humble themselves , he sent Shemaiah to tell them , “ Because you have humbled yourselves , I will not completely destroy you ; some will escape . I will not use Shishak to pour out my anger upon Jerusalem .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	12	8	But you must pay annual tribute to him . Then you will realize how much better it is to serve me than to serve him ! ”
TLB	2%20Chronicles	12	9	So King Shishak of Egypt conquered Jerusalem and took away all the treasures of the Temple and of the palace , also all of Solomon ’ s gold shields .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	12	10	King Rehoboam replaced them with bronze shields and committed them to the care of the captain of his bodyguard .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	12	11	Whenever the king went to the Temple , the guards would carry them and afterwards return them to the armory .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	12	13	King Rehoboam reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem , the city God had chosen as his residence after considering all the other cities of Israel . He had become king at the age of forty-one , and his mother ’ s name was Naamah the Ammonitess .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	12	14	But he was an evil king , for he never did decide really to please the Lord .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	12	15	The complete biography of Rehoboam is recorded in the histories written by Shemaiah the prophet and by Iddo the seer and in The Genealogical Register . There were continual wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam .

TLB	2%20Chronicles	13	2	Chronicles
TLB	2%20Chronicles	13	13	1-2 Abijah became the new king of Judah in Jerusalem in the eighteenth year of the reign of King Jeroboam of Israel . He lasted three years . His mother ’ s name was Micaiah ( daughter of Uriel of Gibeah ) . Early in his reign war broke out between Judah and Israel .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	13	3	Judah , led by King Abijah , fielded 400,000 seasoned warriors against twice as many Israeli troops—strong , courageous men led by King Jeroboam .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	13	4	When the army of Judah arrived at Mount Zemaraim , in the hill country of Ephraim , King Abijah shouted to King Jeroboam and the Israeli army :
TLB	2%20Chronicles	13	5	“ Listen ! Don ’ t you realize that the Lord God of Israel swore that David ’ s descendants would always be the kings of Israel ?
TLB	2%20Chronicles	13	6	Your King Jeroboam is a mere servant of David ’ s son and was a traitor to his master .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	13	7	Then a whole gang of worthless rebels joined him , defying Solomon ’ s son Rehoboam , for he was young and frightened and couldn ’ t stand up to them .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	13	8	Do you really think you can defeat the kingdom of the Lord that is led by a descendant of David ? Your army is twice as large as mine , but you are cursed with those gold calves you have with you that Jeroboam made for you—he calls them your gods !
TLB	2%20Chronicles	13	9	And you have driven away the priests of the Lord and the Levites and have appointed heathen priests instead . Just like the people of other lands , you accept as priests anybody who comes along with a young bullock and seven rams for consecration . Anyone at all can be a priest of these no-gods of yours !
TLB	2%20Chronicles	13	10	“ But as for us , the Lord is our God and we have not forsaken him . Only the descendants of Aaron are our priests , and the Levites alone may help them in their work .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	13	11	They burn sacrifices to the Lord every morning and evening—burnt offerings and sweet incense ; and they place the Bread of the Presence upon the holy table . The gold lampstand is lighted every night , for we are careful to follow the instructions of the Lord our God ; but you have forsaken him .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	13	12	So you see , God is with us ; he is our leader . His priests , trumpeting as they go , will lead us into battle against you . O people of Israel , do not fight against the Lord God of your fathers , for you will not succeed ! ” 13-14 Meanwhile , Jeroboam had secretly sent part of his army around behind the men of Judah to ambush them ; so Judah was surrounded , with the enemy before and behind them . Then they cried out to the Lord for mercy , and the priests blew the trumpets . 15-16 The men of Judah began to shout . And as they shouted , God used King Abijah and the men of Judah to turn the tide of battle against King Jeroboam and the army of Israel ,
TLB	2%20Chronicles	13	17	and they slaughtered 500,000 elite troops of Israel that day . 18-19 So Judah , depending upon the Lord God of their fathers , defeated Israel , and chased King Jeroboam ’ s troops , and captured some of his cities—Bethel , Jeshanah , Ephron , and their suburbs .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	13	20	King Jeroboam of Israel never regained his power during Abijah ’ s lifetime , and eventually the Lord struck him and he died .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	13	21	Meanwhile , King Abijah of Judah became very strong . He married fourteen wives and had twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	13	22	His complete biography and speeches are recorded in the prophet Iddo ’ s History of Judah . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	2%20Chronicles	14	2	for Asa was careful to obey the Lord his God .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	14	14	While they were at Gerar they attacked all the cities in that area , and terror from the Lord came upon the residents . As a result , additional vast quantities of plunder were collected from these cities too .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	14	3	He demolished the heathen altars on the hills , and broke down the obelisks , and chopped down the shameful Asherim idols ,
TLB	2%20Chronicles	14	4	and demanded that the entire nation obey the commandments of the Lord God of their ancestors .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	14	5	Also , he removed the sun images from the hills and the incense altars from every one of Judah ’ s cities . That is why God gave his kingdom peace .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	14	6	This made it possible for him to build walled cities throughout Judah .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	14	7	“ Now is the time to do it , while the Lord is blessing us with peace because of our obedience to him , ” he told his people . “ Let us build and fortify cities now , with walls , towers , gates , and bars. ” So they went ahead with these projects very successfully .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	14	8	King Asa ’ s Judean army was 300,000 strong , equipped with light shields and spears . His army of Benjaminites numbered 280,000 , armed with large shields and bows . Both armies were composed of well-trained , brave men . 9-10 But now he was attacked by an army of 1,000,000 troops from Ethiopia with
TLB	2%20Chronicles	14	300	chariots , under the leadership of General Zerah . They advanced to the city of Mareshah , in the valley of Zephathah , and King Asa sent his troops to battle with them there .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	14	11	“ O Lord , ” he cried out to God , “ no one else can help us ! Here we are , powerless against this mighty army . Oh , help us , Lord our God ! For we trust in you alone to rescue us , and in your name we attack this vast horde . Don ’ t let mere men defeat you ! ”
TLB	2%20Chronicles	14	12	Then the Lord defeated the Ethiopians , and Asa and the army of Judah triumphed as the Ethiopians fled .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	14	13	They chased them as far as Gerar , and the entire Ethiopian army was wiped out so that not one man remained ; for the Lord and his army destroyed them all . Then the army of Judah carried off vast quantities of plunder .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	14	15	They not only plundered the cities but destroyed the cattle tents and captured great herds of sheep and camels before finally returning to Jerusalem . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	2%20Chronicles	15	2	and he went out to meet King Asa as he was returning from the battle . “ Listen to me , Asa ! Listen , armies of Judah and Benjamin ! ” he shouted . “ The Lord will stay with you as long as you stay with him ! Whenever you look for him , you will find him . But if you forsake him , he will forsake you .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	15	15	All were happy for this covenant with God , for they had entered into it with all their hearts and wills and wanted him above everything else , and they found him ! And he gave them peace throughout the nation .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	15	3	For a long time now , over in Israel , the people haven ’ t worshiped the true God and have not had a true priest to teach them . They have lived without God ’ s laws .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	15	4	But whenever they have turned again to the Lord God of Israel in their distress and searched for him he has helped them .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	15	5	In their times of rebellion against God there was no peace . Problems troubled the nation on every hand . Crime was on the increase everywhere .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	15	6	There were external wars and internal fighting of city against city , for God was plaguing them with all sorts of trouble .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	15	7	But you men of Judah , keep up the good work and don ’ t get discouraged , for you will be rewarded. ”
TLB	2%20Chronicles	15	8	When King Asa heard this message from God , he took courage and destroyed all the idols in the land of Judah and Benjamin and in the cities he had captured in the hill country of Ephraim , and he rebuilt the altar of the Lord in front of the Temple .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	15	9	Then he summoned all the people of Judah and Benjamin and the immigrants from Israel ( for many had come from the territories of Ephraim , Manasseh , and Simeon in Israel when they saw that the Lord God was with King Asa ) .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	15	10	They all came to Jerusalem in June of the fifteenth year of King Asa ’ s reign
TLB	2%20Chronicles	15	11	and sacrificed to the Lord seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep—it was part of the plunder they had captured in the battle .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	15	12	Then they entered into a contract to worship only the Lord God of their fathers
TLB	2%20Chronicles	15	13	and agreed that anyone who refused to do this must die—whether old or young , man or woman .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	15	14	They shouted out their oath of loyalty to God with trumpets blaring and horns sounding .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	15	16	King Asa even removed his mother Maacah from being the queen mother because she made an Asherah idol ; he cut down the idol and crushed and burned it at Kidron Brook .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	15	17	Over in Israel the idol-temples were not removed . But here in Judah and Benjamin the heart of King Asa was perfect before God throughout his lifetime .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	15	18	He brought back into the Temple the silver and gold bowls that he and his father had dedicated to the Lord .

TLB	2%20Chronicles	16	2	Chronicles 16:1 the fortress , literally , “ the high places. ” The Living Bible copyright ©
TLB	2%20Chronicles	16	16	In the thirty-sixth year of King Asa ’ s reign , King Baasha of Israel declared war on him and built the fortress [ a ] of Ramah in order to control the road to Judah .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	16	3	“ Let us renew the mutual security pact that there was between your father and my father . See , here is silver and gold to induce you to break your alliance with King Baasha of Israel , so that he will leave me alone. ”
TLB	2%20Chronicles	16	4	Ben-hadad agreed to King Asa ’ s request and mobilized his armies to attack Israel . They destroyed the cities of Ijon , Dan , Abel-maim and all of the supply centers in Naphtali .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	16	5	As soon as King Baasha of Israel heard what was happening , he discontinued building Ramah and gave up his plan to attack Judah .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	16	6	Then King Asa and the people of Judah went out to Ramah and carried away the building stones and timbers and used them to build Geba and Mizpah instead .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	16	7	About that time the prophet Hanani came to King Asa and told him , “ Because you have put your trust in the king of Syria instead of in the Lord your God , the army of the king of Syria has escaped from you .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	16	8	Don ’ t you remember what happened to the Ethiopians and Libyans and their vast army , with all of their chariots and cavalrymen ? But you relied then on the Lord , and he delivered them all into your hand .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	16	9	For the eyes of the Lord search back and forth across the whole earth , looking for people whose hearts are perfect toward him , so that he can show his great power in helping them . What a fool you have been ! From now on you shall have wars. ”
TLB	2%20Chronicles	16	10	Asa was so angry with the prophet for saying this that he threw him into jail . And Asa oppressed all the people at that time .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	16	11	The rest of the biography of Asa is written in The Annals of the Kings of Israel and Judah .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	16	12	In the thirty-ninth year of his reign , Asa became seriously diseased in his feet , but he didn ’ t go to the Lord with the problem but to the doctors . 13-14 So he died in the forty-first year of his reign and was buried in his own vault that he had hewn out for himself in Jerusalem . He was laid on a bed perfumed with sweet spices and ointments , and his people made a very great burning of incense for him at his funeral . Footnotes -

TLB	2%20Chronicles	17	2	He placed garrisons in all of the fortified cities of Judah , in various other places throughout the country , and in the cities of Ephraim that his father had conquered .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	17	17	Benjamin supplied 200,000 men equipped with bows and shields under the command of Eliada , a great general .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	17	3	The Lord was with Jehoshaphat because he followed in the good footsteps of his father ’ s early years and did not worship idols .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	17	4	He obeyed the commandments of his father ’ s God—quite unlike the people across the border in the land of Israel .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	17	5	So the Lord strengthened his position as king of Judah . All the people of Judah cooperated by paying their taxes , so he became very wealthy as well as being very popular .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	17	6	He boldly followed the paths of God—even knocking down the heathen altars on the hills and destroying the Asherim idols . 7-9 In the third year of his reign he began a nationwide religious education program . He sent out top government officials as teachers in all the cities of Judah . These men included Ben-hail , Obadiah , Zechariah , Nethanel , and Micaiah . He also used the Levites for this purpose , including Shemaiah , Nethaniah , Zebadiah , Asahel , Shemiramoth , Jehonathan , Adonijah , Tobijah , and Tobadonijah ; also the priests , Elishama and Jehoram . They took copies of The Book of the Law of the Lord to all the cities of Judah to teach the Scriptures to the people .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	17	10	Then the fear of the Lord fell upon all the surrounding kingdoms so that none of them declared war on King Jehoshaphat .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	17	11	Even some of the Philistines brought him presents and annual tribute , and the Arabs donated 7,700 rams and 7,700 male goats .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	17	12	So Jehoshaphat became very strong and built fortresses and supply cities throughout Judah .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	17	13	His public works program was also extensive , and he had a huge army stationed at Jerusalem , his capital . 14-15 Three hundred thousand Judean troops were there under General Adnah . Next in command was Jehohanan with an army of 280,000 men .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	17	16	Next was Amasiah ( son of Zichri ) , a man of unusual piety , with 200,000 troops .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	17	18	His second in command was Jehozabad , with 180,000 trained men .

TLB	2%20Chronicles	18	18	“ Listen to what else the Lord has told me , ” Micaiah continued . “ I saw him upon his throne surrounded by vast throngs of angels . 19-20 “ And the Lord said , ‘ Who can get King Ahab to go to battle against Ramoth-gilead and be killed there ? ’ “ There were many suggestions , but finally a spirit stepped forward before the Lord and said , ‘ I can do it ! ’ “ ‘ How ? ’ the Lord asked him .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	18	400	of his heathen prophets and asked them , “ Shall we go to war with Ramoth-gilead or not ? ” And they replied , “ Go ahead , for God will give you a great victory ! ” 6-7 But Jehoshaphat wasn ’ t satisfied . “ Isn ’ t there some prophet of the Lord around here too ? ” he asked . “ I ’ d like to ask him the same question. ” “ Well , ” Ahab told him , “ there is one , but I hate him , for he never prophesies anything but evil ! His name is Micaiah ( son of Imlah ) . ” “ Oh , come now , don ’ t talk like that ! ” Jehoshaphat exclaimed . “ Let ’ s hear what he has to say. ”
TLB	2%20Chronicles	18	8	So the king of Israel called one of his aides . “ Quick ! Go and get Micaiah ( son of Imlah ) , ” he ordered .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	18	9	The two kings were sitting on thrones in full regalia at an open place near the Samaria gate , and all the “ prophets ” were prophesying before them .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	18	10	One of them , Zedekiah ( son of Chenaanah ) , made some iron horns for the occasion and proclaimed , “ The Lord says you will gore the Syrians to death with these ! ”
TLB	2%20Chronicles	18	11	And all the others agreed . “ Yes , ” they chorused , “ go up to Ramoth-gilead and prosper , for the Lord will cause you to conquer. ”
TLB	2%20Chronicles	18	12	The man who went to get Micaiah told him what was happening and what all the prophets were saying—that the war would end in triumph for the king . “ I hope you will agree with them and give the king a favorable reading , ” the man ventured .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	18	13	But Micaiah replied , “ I vow by God that whatever God says is what I will say. ”
TLB	2%20Chronicles	18	14	When he arrived before the king , the king asked him , “ Micaiah , shall we go to war against Ramoth-gilead or not ? ” And Micaiah replied , “ Sure , go ahead ! It will be a glorious victory ! ”
TLB	2%20Chronicles	18	15	“ Look here , ” the king said sharply , “ how many times must I tell you to speak nothing except what the Lord tells you to ? ”
TLB	2%20Chronicles	18	16	Then Micaiah told him , “ In my vision I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountain as sheep without a shepherd . And the Lord said , ‘ Their master has been killed . Send them home. ’ ”
TLB	2%20Chronicles	18	17	“ Didn ’ t I tell you ? ” the king of Israel exclaimed to Jehoshaphat . “ He does it every time . He never prophesies anything but evil against me. ”
TLB	2%20Chronicles	18	21	“ He replied , ‘ I will be a lying spirit in the mouths of all of the king ’ s prophets ! ’ “ ‘ It will work , ’ the Lord said ; ‘ go and do it. ’
TLB	2%20Chronicles	18	22	“ So you see , the Lord has put a lying spirit in the mouths of these prophets of yours , when actually he has determined just the opposite of what they are telling you ! ”
TLB	2%20Chronicles	18	23	Then Zedekiah ( son of Chenaanah ) walked up to Micaiah and slapped him across the face . “ You liar ! ” he yelled . “ When did the Spirit of the Lord leave me and enter you ? ”
TLB	2%20Chronicles	18	24	“ You ’ ll find out soon enough , ” Micaiah replied , “ when you are hiding in an inner room ! ”
TLB	2%20Chronicles	18	25	“ Arrest this man and take him back to Governor Amon and to my son Joash , ” the king of Israel ordered .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	18	26	“ Tell them , ‘ The king says to put this fellow in prison and feed him with bread and water until I return safely from the battle ! ’ ”
TLB	2%20Chronicles	18	27	Micaiah replied , “ If you return safely , the Lord has not spoken through me. ” Then , turning to those around them , he remarked , “ Take note of what I have said. ”
TLB	2%20Chronicles	18	28	So the king of Israel and the king of Judah led their armies to Ramoth-gilead .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	18	29	The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat , “ I ’ ll disguise myself so that no one will recognize me , but you put on your royal robes ! ” So that is what they did .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	18	30	Now the king of Syria had issued these instructions to his charioteers : “ Ignore everyone but the king of Israel ! ”
TLB	2%20Chronicles	18	31	So when the Syrian charioteers saw King Jehoshaphat of Judah in his royal robes , they went for him , supposing that he was the man they were after . But Jehoshaphat cried out to the Lord to save him , and the Lord made the charioteers see their mistake and leave him .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	18	32	For as soon as they realized he was not the king of Israel , they stopped chasing him .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	18	33	But one of the Syrian soldiers shot an arrow haphazardly at the Israeli troops , and it struck the king of Israel at the opening where the lower armor and the breastplate meet . “ Get me out of here , ” he groaned to the driver of his chariot , “ for I am badly wounded. ”
TLB	2%20Chronicles	18	34	The battle grew hotter and hotter all that day , and King Ahab went back in , propped up in his chariot , to fight the Syrians , but just as the sun sank into the western skies , he died . Footnotes -

TLB	2%20Chronicles	19	2	the prophet Jehu ( son of Hanani ) went out to meet him . “ Should you be helping the wicked , and loving those who hate the Lord ? ” he asked him . “ Because of what you have done , God ’ s wrath is upon you .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	19	19	As King Jehoshaphat of Judah returned home , uninjured ,
TLB	2%20Chronicles	19	3	But there are some good things about you in that you got rid of the shameful idols throughout the land , and you have tried to be faithful to God. ”
TLB	2%20Chronicles	19	4	So Jehoshaphat made no more trips to Israel after that but remained quietly at Jerusalem . Later he went out again among the people , traveling from Beersheba to the hill country of Ephraim to encourage them to worship the God of their ancestors .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	19	5	He appointed judges throughout the nation in all the larger cities ,
TLB	2%20Chronicles	19	6	and instructed them : “ Watch your step—I have not appointed you—God has ; and he will stand beside you and help you give justice in each case that comes before you .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	19	7	Be very much afraid to give any other decision than what God tells you to . For there must be no injustice among God ’ s judges , no partiality , no taking of bribes. ”
TLB	2%20Chronicles	19	8	Jehoshaphat set up courts in Jerusalem , too , with the Levites and priests and clan leaders and judges .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	19	9	These were his instructions to them : “ You are to act always in the fear of God , with honest hearts .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	19	10	Whenever a case is referred to you by the judges out in the provinces , whether murder cases or other violations of the laws and ordinances of God , you are to clarify the evidence for them and help them to decide justly , lest the wrath of God come down upon you and them ; if you do this , you will discharge your responsibility. ”
TLB	2%20Chronicles	19	11	Then he appointed Amariah the High Priest to be the court of final appeal in cases involving violation of sacred affairs ; and Zebadiah ( son of Ishmael ) , a ruler in Judah , as the court of final appeal in all civil cases ; with the Levites as their assistants . “ Be fearless in your stand for truth and honesty . And may God use you to defend the innocent , ” was his final word to them . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	2%20Chronicles	20	2	Word reached Jehoshaphat that “ a vast army is marching against you from beyond the Dead Sea from Syria . It is already at Hazazon-tamar ” ( also called Engedi ) .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	20	20	Early the next morning the army of Judah went out into the wilderness of Tekoa . On the way Jehoshaphat stopped and called them to attention . “ Listen to me , O people of Judah and Jerusalem , ” he said . “ Believe in the Lord your God and you shall have success ! Believe his prophets and everything will be all right ! ”
TLB	2%20Chronicles	20	3	Jehoshaphat was badly shaken by this news and determined to beg for help from the Lord ; so he announced that all the people of Judah should go without food for a time , in penitence and intercession before God .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	20	4	People from all across the nation came to Jerusalem to plead unitedly with him .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	20	5	Jehoshaphat stood among them as they gathered at the new court of the Temple and prayed this prayer :
TLB	2%20Chronicles	20	6	“ O Lord God of our fathers—the only God in all the heavens , the ruler of all the kingdoms of the earth—you are so powerful , so mighty . Who can stand against you ?
TLB	2%20Chronicles	20	7	O our God , didn ’ t you drive out the heathen who lived in this land when your people arrived ? And didn ’ t you give this land forever to the descendants of your friend Abraham ?
TLB	2%20Chronicles	20	8	Your people settled here and built this Temple for you ,
TLB	2%20Chronicles	20	9	truly believing that in a time like this—whenever we are faced with any calamity such as war , disease , or famine—we can stand here before this Temple and before you—for you are here in this Temple—and cry out to you to save us ; and that you will hear us and rescue us .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	20	10	“ And now see what the armies of Ammon , Moab , and Mount Seir are doing . You wouldn ’ t let our ancestors invade those nations when Israel left Egypt , so we went around and didn ’ t destroy them .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	20	11	Now see how they reward us ! For they have come to throw us out of your land which you have given us .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	20	12	O our God , won ’ t you stop them ? We have no way to protect ourselves against this mighty army . We don ’ t know what to do , but we are looking to you. ”
TLB	2%20Chronicles	20	13	As the people from every part of Judah stood before the Lord with their little ones , wives , and children ,
TLB	2%20Chronicles	20	14	the Spirit of the Lord came upon one of the men standing there—Jahaziel ( son of Zechariah , son of Benaiah , son of Jeiel , son of Mattaniah the Levite , who was one of the sons of Asaph ) .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	20	15	“ Listen to me , all you people of Judah and Jerusalem , and you , O king Jehoshaphat ! ” he exclaimed . “ The Lord says , ‘ Don ’ t be afraid ! Don ’ t be paralyzed by this mighty army ! For the battle is not yours , but God ’ s !
TLB	2%20Chronicles	20	16	Tomorrow , go down and attack them ! You will find them coming up the slopes of Ziz at the end of the valley that opens into the wilderness of Jeruel .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	20	17	But you will not need to fight ! Take your places ; stand quietly and see the incredible rescue operation God will perform for you , O people of Judah and Jerusalem ! Don ’ t be afraid or discouraged ! Go out there tomorrow , for the Lord is with you ! ’ ”
TLB	2%20Chronicles	20	18	Then King Jehoshaphat fell to the ground with his face to the earth , and all the people of Judah and the people of Jerusalem did the same , worshiping the Lord .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	20	19	Then the Levites of the Kohath clan and the Korah clan stood to praise the Lord God of Israel with songs of praise that rang out strong and clear .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	20	21	After consultation with the leaders of the people , he determined that there should be a choir leading the march , clothed in sanctified garments and singing the song “ His Loving-Kindness Is Forever ” as they walked along praising and thanking the Lord !
TLB	2%20Chronicles	20	22	And at the moment they began to sing and to praise , the Lord caused the armies of Ammon , Moab , and Mount Seir to begin fighting among themselves , and they destroyed each other !
TLB	2%20Chronicles	20	23	For the Ammonites and Moabites turned against their allies from Mount Seir and killed every one of them . And when they had finished that job , they turned against each other !
TLB	2%20Chronicles	20	24	So , when the army of Judah arrived at the watchtower that looks out over the wilderness , as far as they could look there were dead bodies lying on the ground—not a single one of the enemy had escaped .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	20	25	King Jehoshaphat and his people went out to plunder the bodies and came away loaded with money , garments , and jewels stripped from the corpses—so much that it took them three days to cart it all away !
TLB	2%20Chronicles	20	26	On the fourth day they gathered in the Valley of Blessing , as it is called today , and how they praised the Lord !
TLB	2%20Chronicles	20	27	Then they returned to Jerusalem , with Jehoshaphat leading them , full of joy that the Lord had given them this marvelous rescue from their enemies .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	20	28	They marched into Jerusalem accompanied by a band of harps , lyres , and trumpets and proceeded to the Temple .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	20	29	And as had happened before , when the surrounding kingdoms heard that the Lord himself had fought against the enemies of Israel , the fear of God fell upon them .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	20	30	So Jehoshaphat ’ s kingdom was quiet , for his God had given him rest .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	20	31	A thumbnail sketch of King Jehoshaphat : He became king of Judah when he was thirty-five years old and reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem . His mother ’ s name was Azubah , the daughter of Shilhi .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	20	32	He was a good king , just as his father Asa was . He continually tried to follow the Lord
TLB	2%20Chronicles	20	33	with the exception that he did not destroy the idol shrines on the hills , nor had the people as yet really decided to follow the God of their ancestors .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	20	34	The details of Jehoshaphat ’ s reign from first to last are written in the history of Jehu the son of Hanani , which is inserted in The Annals of the Kings of Israel .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	20	35	But at the close of his life , Jehoshaphat , king of Judah , went into partnership with Ahaziah , king of Israel , who was a very wicked man .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	20	36	They made ships in Ezion-geber to sail to Tarshish .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	20	37	Then Eliezer , son of Dodavahu from Mareshah , prophesied against Jehoshaphat , telling him , “ Because you have allied yourself with King Ahaziah , the Lord has destroyed your work. ” So the ships met disaster and never arrived at Tarshish . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	2%20Chronicles	21	2	Chronicles 21:9 Jehoram attacked him . . . and almost , literally , “ Jehoram . . . struck down the Edomites . . . . Nevertheless Edom . . . revolted. ” The Living Bible copyright ©
TLB	2%20Chronicles	21	21	When Jehoshaphat died , he was buried in the cemetery of the kings in Jerusalem , and his son Jehoram became the new ruler of Judah .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	21	5	He was thirty-two years old when he began to reign , and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	21	6	But he was as wicked as the kings who were over in Israel . Yes , as wicked as Ahab , for Jehoram had married one of the daughters of Ahab , and his whole life was one constant binge of doing evil .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	21	7	However , the Lord was unwilling to end the dynasty of David , for he had made a covenant with David always to have one of his descendants upon the throne .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	21	8	At that time the king of Edom revolted , declaring his independence of Judah .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	21	9	Jehoram attacked him with his full army and with all of his chariots , marching by night , and almost [ a ] managed to subdue him .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	21	10	But to this day Edom has been successful in throwing off the yoke of Judah . Libnah revolted too because Jehoram had turned away from the Lord God of his fathers .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	21	11	What ’ s more , Jehoram constructed idol shrines in the mountains of Judah and led the people of Jerusalem in worshiping idols ; in fact , he compelled his people to worship them .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	21	12	Then Elijah the prophet wrote him this letter : “ The Lord God of your ancestor David says that because you have not followed in the good ways of your father Jehoshaphat , nor the good ways of King Asa ,
TLB	2%20Chronicles	21	13	but you have been as evil as the kings over in Israel and have made the people of Jerusalem and Judah worship idols just as in the times of King Ahab , and because you have killed your brothers who were better than you ,
TLB	2%20Chronicles	21	14	now the Lord will destroy your nation with a great plague . You , your children , your wives , and all that you have will be struck down .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	21	15	You will be stricken with an intestinal disease and your bowels will rot away. ”
TLB	2%20Chronicles	21	16	Then the Lord stirred up the Philistines and the Arabs living next to the Ethiopians to attack Jehoram .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	21	17	They marched against Judah , broke across the border , and carried away everything of value in the king ’ s palace , including his sons and his wives ; only his youngest son , Jehoahaz , escaped .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	21	18	It was after this that Jehovah struck him down with the incurable bowel disease .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	21	19	In the process of time , at the end of two years , his intestines came out , and he died in terrible suffering . ( The customary pomp and ceremony was omitted at his funeral . )
TLB	2%20Chronicles	21	20	He was thirty-two years old when he began to reign , and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years and died unmourned . He was buried in Jerusalem , but not in the royal cemetery . Footnotes -

TLB	2%20Chronicles	22	2	Chronicles 22:11 King Ahaziah ’ s sister , literally , “ the king ’ s daughter , ” i.e. , King Jehoram ’ s daughter . The Living Bible copyright ©
TLB	2%20Chronicles	22	22	Then the people of Jerusalem chose Ahaziah , [ a ] his youngest son , as their new king ( for the marauding bands of Arabs had killed his older sons ) .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	22	3	He , too , walked in the evil ways of Ahab , for his mother encouraged him in doing wrong .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	22	4	Yes , he was as evil as Ahab , for Ahab ’ s family became his advisors after his father ’ s death , and they led him on to ruin .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	22	5	Following their evil advice , Ahaziah made an alliance with King Joram of Israel ( the son of Ahab ) , who was at war with King Hazael of Syria at Ramoth-gilead . Ahaziah led his army there to join the battle . King Joram of Israel was wounded
TLB	2%20Chronicles	22	6	and returned to Jezreel to recover . Ahaziah went to visit him ,
TLB	2%20Chronicles	22	7	but this turned out to be a fatal mistake ; for God had decided to punish Ahaziah for his alliance with Joram . It was during this visit that Ahaziah went out with Joram to challenge Jehu ( son of Nimshi ) , whom the Lord had appointed to end the dynasty of Ahab .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	22	8	While Jehu was hunting down and killing the family and friends of Ahab , he met King Ahaziah ’ s nephews , the princes of Judah , and killed them .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	22	9	As he and his men were searching for Ahaziah , they found him hiding in the city of Samaria and brought him to Jehu , who killed him . Even so , Ahaziah was given a royal burial because he was the grandson of King Jehoshaphat—a man who enthusiastically served the Lord . None of his sons , however , except for Joash , lived to succeed him as king ,
TLB	2%20Chronicles	22	10	for their grandmother Athaliah killed them when she heard the news of her son Ahaziah ’ s death .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	22	11	Joash was rescued by his Aunt Jehoshabeath , who was King Ahaziah ’ s sister , [ c ] and was hidden away in a storage room in the Temple . She was a daughter of King Jehoram and the wife of Jehoiada the priest .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	22	12	Joash remained hidden in the Temple for six years while Athaliah reigned as queen . He was cared for by his nurse and by his aunt and uncle . Footnotes -

TLB	2%20Chronicles	23	2	Chronicles
TLB	2%20Chronicles	23	23	In the seventh year of the reign of Queen Athaliah , Jehoiada the priest got up his courage and took some of the army officers into his confidence : Azariah ( son of Jeroham ) , Ishmael ( son of Jehohanan ) , Azariah ( son of Obed ) , Maaseiah ( son of Adaiah ) , and Elishaphat ( son of Zichri ) . 2-3 These men traveled out across the nation secretly to tell the Levites and clan leaders about his plans and to summon them to Jerusalem . On arrival they swore allegiance to the young king , who was still in hiding at the Temple . “ At last the time has come for the king ’ s son to reign ! ” Jehoiada exclaimed . “ The Lord ’ s promise—that a descendant of King David shall be our king—will be true again .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	23	4	This is how we ’ ll proceed : A third of you priests and Levites who come off duty on the Sabbath will stay at the entrance as guards . 5-6 Another third will go over to the palace , and a third will be at the Lower Gate . Everyone else must stay in the outer courts of the Temple , as required by God ’ s laws . For only the priests and Levites on duty may enter the Temple itself , for they are sanctified .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	23	7	You Levites , form a bodyguard for the king , weapons in hand , and kill any unauthorized person entering the Temple . Stay right beside the king. ”
TLB	2%20Chronicles	23	8	So all the arrangements were made . Each of the three leaders led a third of the priests arriving for duty that Sabbath , and a third of those whose week ’ s work was done and were going off duty—for Jehoiada the chief priest didn ’ t release them to go home .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	23	9	Then Jehoiada issued spears and shields to all the army officers . These had once belonged to King David and were stored in the Temple .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	23	10	These officers , fully armed , formed a line from one side to the other in front of the Temple and around the altar in the outer court .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	23	11	Then they brought out the little prince and placed the crown upon his head , and handed him a copy of the law of God , and proclaimed him king . A great shout went up , “ Long live the king ! ” as Jehoiada and his sons anointed him .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	23	12	When Queen Athaliah heard all the noise and commotion and the shouts of praise to the king , she rushed over to the Temple to see what was going on—and there stood the king by his pillar at the entrance , with the army officers and the trumpeters surrounding him , and people from all over the land rejoicing and blowing trumpets , and the singers singing , accompanied by an orchestra leading the people in a great psalm of praise . Athaliah ripped her clothes and screamed , “ Treason ! Treason ! ” 13-14 “ Take her out and kill her , ” Jehoiada the priest shouted to the army officers . “ Don ’ t do it here at the Temple . And kill anyone who tries to help her. ” 15-17 So the crowd opened up for them to take her out , and they killed her at the palace stables . Then Jehoiada made a solemn contract that he and the king and the people would be the Lord ’ s . And all the people rushed over to the temple of Baal and knocked it down , and broke up the altars , and knocked down the idols , and killed Mattan the priest of Baal before his altar .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	23	18	Jehoiada now appointed the Levite priests as guards , and to sacrifice the burnt offering to the Lord as prescribed in the law of Moses . He made the identical assignments of the Levite clans that King David had . They sang with joy as they worked .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	23	19	The guards at the Temple gates kept out everything that was not consecrated and all unauthorized personnel .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	23	20	Then the army officers , nobles , governors , and all the people escorted the king from the Temple , wending their way from the Upper Gate to the palace , and seated the king upon his throne .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	23	21	So all the people of the land rejoiced , and the city was quiet and peaceful because Queen Athaliah was dead . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	2%20Chronicles	24	2	Joash tried hard to please the Lord all during the lifetime of Jehoiada the priest .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	24	24	It was a great triumph for the tiny Syrian army , but the Lord let the great army of Judah be conquered by them because they had forsaken the Lord God of their ancestors . In that way God executed judgment upon Joash .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	24	3	Jehoiada arranged two marriages for him , and he had sons and daughters .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	24	4	Later on Joash decided to repair and recondition the Temple .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	24	5	He summoned the priests and Levites and gave them these instructions : “ Go to all the cities of Judah and collect offerings for the building fund so that we can maintain the Temple in good repair . Get at it right away . Don ’ t delay. ” But the Levites took their time .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	24	6	So the king called for Jehoiada the High Priest and asked him , “ Why haven ’ t you demanded that the Levites go out and collect the Temple taxes from the cities of Judah and from Jerusalem ? The tax law enacted by Moses the servant of the Lord must be enforced so that the Temple can be repaired. ” 7-8 ( The followers of wicked Athaliah had ravaged the Temple , and everything dedicated to the worship of God had been removed to the temple of Baalim . ) So now the king instructed that a chest be made and set outside the Temple gate .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	24	9	Then a proclamation was sent to all the cities of Judah and throughout Jerusalem telling the people to bring to the Lord the tax that Moses the servant of God had assessed upon Israel .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	24	10	And all the leaders and the people were glad , and brought the money and placed it in the chest until it was full .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	24	11	Then the Levites carried the chest to the king ’ s accounting office , where the recording secretary and the representative of the High Priest counted the money and took the chest back to the Temple again . This went on day after day , and money continued to pour in .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	24	12	The king and Jehoiada gave the money to the building superintendents , who hired masons and carpenters to restore the Temple , and to foundrymen , who made articles of iron and brass .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	24	13	So the work went forward , and finally the Temple was in much better condition than before .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	24	14	When all was finished , the remaining money was brought to the king and Jehoiada , and it was agreed to use it for making the gold and silver spoons and bowls used for incense , and for making the instruments used in the sacrifices and offerings . Burnt offerings were sacrificed continually during the lifetime of Jehoiada the priest .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	24	15	He lived to a very old age , finally dying at
TLB	2%20Chronicles	24	130	.
TLB	2%20Chronicles	24	16	He was buried in the City of David among the kings because he had done so much good for Israel , for God , and for the Temple . 17-18 But after his death , the leaders of Judah came to King Joash and induced him to abandon the Temple of the God of their ancestors and to worship shameful idols instead ! So the wrath of God came down upon Judah and Jerusalem again .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	24	19	God sent prophets to bring them back to the Lord , but the people wouldn ’ t listen .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	24	20	Then the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah , Jehoiada ’ s son . He called a meeting of all the people . Standing before them upon a platform , he said to them , “ God wants to know why you are disobeying his commandments . For when you do , everything you try fails . You have forsaken the Lord , and now he has forsaken you. ”
TLB	2%20Chronicles	24	21	Then the leaders plotted to kill Zechariah , and finally King Joash himself ordered him executed in the court of the Temple .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	24	22	That was how King Joash repaid Jehoiada for his love and loyalty—by killing his son . Zechariah ’ s last words as he died were , “ Lord , see what they are doing and pay them back. ”
TLB	2%20Chronicles	24	23	A few months later the Syrian army arrived and conquered Judah and Jerusalem , killing all the leaders of the nation and sending back great quantities of booty to the king of Damascus .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	24	25	When the Syrians left—leaving Joash severely wounded—his own officials decided to kill him for murdering the son of Jehoiada the priest . They assassinated him as he lay in bed , and buried him in the City of David , but not in the cemetery of the kings .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	24	26	The conspirators were Zabad , whose mother was Shimeath , a woman from Ammon ; and Jehozabad , whose mother was Shimrith , a woman from Moab .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	24	27	If you want to read about the sons of Joash and the curses laid upon Joash , and about the restoration of the Temple , see The Annals of the Kings . When Joash died , his son Amaziah became the new king . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	2%20Chronicles	25	2	He did what was right , but sometimes resented it !
TLB	2%20Chronicles	25	25	However , King Amaziah of Judah lived on for fifteen years after the death of King Joash of Israel .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	25	3	When he was well established as the new king , he executed the men who had assassinated his father .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	25	4	However , he didn ’ t kill their children but followed the command of the Lord written in the law of Moses , that the fathers shall not die for the children ’ s sins , nor the children for the father ’ s sins . No , everyone must pay for his own sins . 5-6 Another thing Amaziah did was to organize the army , assigning leaders to each clan from Judah and Benjamin . Then he took a census and found that he had an army of 300,000 men twenty years old and older , all trained and highly skilled in the use of spear and sword . He also paid $ 200,000 to hire 100,000 experienced mercenaries from Israel .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	25	7	But a prophet arrived with this message from the Lord : “ Sir , do not hire troops from Israel , for the Lord is not with them .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	25	8	If you let them go with your troops to battle , you will be defeated no matter how well you fight ; for God has power to help or to frustrate. ”
TLB	2%20Chronicles	25	9	“ But the money ! ” Amaziah whined . “ What shall I do about that ? ” And the prophet replied , “ The Lord is able to give you much more than this ! ”
TLB	2%20Chronicles	25	10	So Amaziah sent them home again to Ephraim , which made them very angry and insulted .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	25	11	Then Amaziah took courage and led his army to Salt Valley and there killed 10,000 men from Seir .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	25	12	Another 10,000 were taken alive to the top of a cliff and thrown over so that they were crushed upon the rocks below .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	25	13	Meanwhile , the army of Israel that had been sent home raided several of the cities of Judah in the vicinity of Beth-horon toward Samaria , killing 3,000 people and carrying off great quantities of booty .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	25	14	When King Amaziah returned from this slaughter of the Edomites , he brought with him idols taken from the people of Seir , set them up as gods , bowed before them , and burned incense to them !
TLB	2%20Chronicles	25	15	This made the Lord very angry , and he sent a prophet to demand , “ Why have you worshiped gods who couldn ’ t even save their own people from you ? ”
TLB	2%20Chronicles	25	16	“ Since when have I asked your advice ? ” the king retorted . “ Be quiet now before I have you killed. ” The prophet left with this parting warning : “ I know that God has determined to destroy you because you have worshiped these idols and have not accepted my counsel. ”
TLB	2%20Chronicles	25	17	King Amaziah of Judah now took the advice of his counselors and declared war on King Joash of Israel ( son of Jehoahaz , grandson of Jehu ) .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	25	18	King Joash replied with this parable : “ Out in the Lebanon mountains a thistle demanded of a cedar tree , ‘ Give your daughter in marriage to my son. ’ Just then a wild animal came by and stepped on the thistle , crushing it !
TLB	2%20Chronicles	25	19	You are very proud about your conquest of Edom , but my advice is to stay home and don ’ t meddle with me , lest you and all Judah get badly hurt. ”
TLB	2%20Chronicles	25	20	But Amaziah wouldn ’ t listen for God was arranging to destroy him for worshiping the gods of Edom .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	25	21	The armies met at Beth-shemesh in Judah ,
TLB	2%20Chronicles	25	22	and Judah was defeated and its army fled home .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	25	23	King Joash of Israel captured the defeated King Amaziah of Judah and took him as a prisoner to Jerusalem . Then King Joash ordered
TLB	2%20Chronicles	25	200	yards of the walls of Jerusalem dismantled , from the gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	25	24	He carried off all the treasures and gold bowls from the Temple , as well as the treasures from the palace ; and he took hostages , including Obed-edom , and returned to Samaria .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	25	26	The complete biography of King Amaziah is written in The Annals of the Kings of Judah and Israel .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	25	27	This account includes a report of Amaziah ’ s turning away from God , how his people conspired against him in Jerusalem , and how he fled to Lachish—but they went after him and killed him there .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	25	28	And they brought him back on horses to Jerusalem and buried him in the royal cemetery . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	2%20Chronicles	26	2	After his father ’ s death , he rebuilt the city of Eloth and restored it to Judah .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	26	26	The people of Judah now crowned sixteen-year-old Uzziah as their new king .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	26	3	In all , he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem . His mother ’ s name was Jecoliah , from Jerusalem .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	26	4	He followed in the footsteps of his father Amaziah and was , in general , a good king in the Lord ’ s sight .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	26	5	While Zechariah was alive Uzziah was always eager to please God . Zechariah was a man who had special revelations from God . And as long as the king followed the paths of God , he prospered , for God blessed him .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	26	6	He declared war on the Philistines and captured the city of Gath and broke down its walls , also those of Jabneh and Ashdod . Then he built new cities in the Ashdod area and in other parts of the Philistine country .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	26	7	God helped him not only with his wars against the Philistines but also in his battles with the Arabs of Gur-baal and in his wars with the Meunites .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	26	8	The Ammonites paid annual tribute to him , and his fame spread even to Egypt , for he was very powerful .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	26	9	He built fortified towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate , and the Valley Gate , and at the turning of the wall .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	26	10	He also constructed forts in the Negeb and made many water reservoirs , for he had great herds of cattle out in the valleys and on the plains . He was a man who loved the soil and had many farms and vineyards , both on the hillsides and in the fertile valleys .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	26	11	He organized his army into regiments to which men were drafted under quotas set by Jeiel , the secretary of the army , and his assistant , Maaseiah . The commander-in-chief was General Hananiah .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	26	12	Twenty-six hundred brave clan leaders commanded these regiments .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	26	13	The army consisted of 307,500 men , all elite troops .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	26	14	Uzziah issued to them shields , spears , helmets , coats of mail , bows , and sling stones .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	26	15	And he produced engines of war manufactured in Jerusalem , invented by brilliant men to shoot arrows and huge stones from the towers and battlements . So he became very famous , for the Lord helped him wonderfully until he was very powerful .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	26	16	But at that point he became proud—and corrupt . He sinned against the Lord his God by entering the forbidden sanctuary of the Temple and personally burning incense upon the altar . 17-18 Azariah the High Priest went in after him with eighty other priests , all brave men , and demanded that he get out . “ It is not for you , Uzziah , to burn incense , ” they declared . “ That is the work of the priests alone , the sons of Aaron who are consecrated to this work . Get out , for you have trespassed , and the Lord is not going to honor you for this ! ”
TLB	2%20Chronicles	26	19	Uzziah was furious and refused to set down the incense burner he was holding . But look ! Suddenly—leprosy appeared on his forehead !
TLB	2%20Chronicles	26	20	When Azariah and the others saw it , they rushed him out ; in fact , he himself was as anxious to get out as they were to get him out because the Lord had struck him .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	26	21	So King Uzziah was a leper until the day of his death and lived in isolation , cut off from his people and from the Temple . His son Jotham became vice-regent , in charge of the king ’ s affairs and of the judging of the people of the land .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	26	22	The other details of Uzziah ’ s reign from first to last are recorded by the prophet Isaiah ( son of Amoz ) .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	26	23	When Uzziah died , he was buried in the royal cemetery even though he was a leper , and his son Jotham became the new king . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	2%20Chronicles	27	2	He followed the generally good example of his father , Uzziah—who had , however , sinned by invading the Temple—but even so his people became very corrupt .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	27	27	Jotham was twenty-five years old at the time he became king , and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem . His mother was Jerushah , daughter of Zadok .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	27	3	He built the Upper Gate of the Temple and also did extensive rebuilding of the walls on the hill where the Temple was situated .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	27	4	And he built cities in the hill country of Judah and erected fortresses and towers on the wooded hills .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	27	5	His war against the Ammonites was successful so that for the next three years he received from them an annual tribute of $ 200,000 in silver , 10,000 sacks of wheat , and 10,000 sacks of barley .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	27	6	King Jotham became powerful because he was careful to follow the path of the Lord his God .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	27	7	The remainder of his history , including his wars and other activities , is written in The Annals of the Kings of Israel and Judah .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	27	8	In summary , then , he was twenty-five years old when he began to reign , and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	27	9	When he died , he was buried in Jerusalem , and his son Ahaz became the new king . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	2%20Chronicles	28	2	Chronicles 28:19 King Ahaz of Israel . King Ahaz ruled two tribes of Israel—Judah and Benjamin—and so is referred to here in this unusual way as a king of Israel . The Living Bible copyright ©
TLB	2%20Chronicles	28	28	Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king , and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem . But he was an evil king , unlike his ancestor King David .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	28	3	He even went out to the valley of Hinnom , and it was not just to burn incense to the idols , for he even sacrificed his own children in the fire , just like the heathen nations that were thrown out of the land by the Lord to make room for Israel .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	28	4	Yes , he sacrificed and burned incense at the idol shrines on the hills and under every green tree .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	28	5	That is why the Lord God allowed the king of Syria to defeat him and deport large numbers of his people to Damascus . The armies from Israel also slaughtered great numbers of his troops .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	28	6	On a single day Pekah , the son of Remaliah , killed 120,000 of his bravest soldiers because they had turned away from the Lord God of their fathers .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	28	7	Then Zichri , a great warrior from Ephraim , killed the king ’ s son Maaseiah , the king ’ s administrator Azrikam , and the king ’ s second-in-command Elkanah .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	28	8	The armies from Israel also captured 200,000 Judean women and children and tremendous amounts of booty , which they took to Samaria .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	28	9	But Oded , a prophet of the Lord , was there in Samaria , and he went out to meet the returning army . “ Look ! ” he exclaimed . “ The Lord God of your fathers was angry with Judah and let you capture them , but you have butchered them without mercy , and all heaven is disturbed .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	28	10	And now are you going to make slaves of these people from Judah and Jerusalem ? What about your own sins against the Lord your God ?
TLB	2%20Chronicles	28	11	Listen to me and return these relatives of yours to their homes , for now the fierce anger of the Lord is upon you. ”
TLB	2%20Chronicles	28	12	Some of the top leaders of Ephraim also added their opposition . These men were Azariah the son of Johanan , Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth , Jehizkiah the son of Shallum , and Amasa the son of Hadlai .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	28	13	“ You must not bring the captives here ! ” they declared . “ If you do , the Lord will be angry , and this sin will be added to our many others . We are in enough trouble with God as it is. ”
TLB	2%20Chronicles	28	14	So the army officers turned over the captives and booty to the political leaders to decide what to do .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	28	15	Then the four men already mentioned distributed captured stores of clothing to the women and children who needed it and gave them shoes , food , and wine , and put those who were sick and old on donkeys , and took them back to their families in Jericho , the City of Palm Trees . Then their escorts returned to Samaria .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	28	16	About that time King Ahaz of Judah asked the king of Assyria to be his ally in his war against the armies of Edom . For Edom was invading Judah and capturing many people as slaves . 17-18 Meanwhile , the Philistines had invaded the lowland cities and the Negeb and had already captured Beth-shemesh , Aijalon , Gederoth , Soco , Timnah , and Gimzo with their surrounding villages , and were living there .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	28	19	For the Lord brought Judah very low on account of the evil deeds of King Ahaz of Israel , [ a ] for he had destroyed the spiritual fiber of Judah and had been faithless to the Lord .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	28	20	But when Tilgath-pilneser , king of Assyria , arrived , he caused trouble for King Ahaz instead of helping him .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	28	21	So even though Ahaz had given him the Temple gold and the palace treasures , it did no good .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	28	22	In this time of deep trial , King Ahaz collapsed spiritually .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	28	23	He sacrificed to the gods of the people of Damascus who had defeated him , for he felt that since these gods had helped the kings of Syria , they would help him too if he sacrificed to them . But instead , they were his ruin , and that of all his people .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	28	24	The king took the gold bowls from the Temple and slashed them to pieces , and nailed the door of the Temple shut so that no one could worship there , and made altars to the heathen gods in every corner of Jerusalem .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	28	25	And he did the same in every city of Judah , thus angering the Lord God of his fathers .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	28	26	The other details of his life and activities are recorded in The Annals of the Kings of Judah and Israel .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	28	27	When King Ahaz died , he was buried in Jerusalem but not in the royal tombs , and his son Hezekiah became the new king . Footnotes -

TLB	2%20Chronicles	29	2	His reign was generally good in the Lord ’ s sight , just as his ancestor David ’ s had been .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	29	29	Afterwards the king and his aides bowed low before the Lord in worship .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	29	3	In the very first month of the first year of his reign , he reopened the doors of the Temple and repaired them . 4-5 He summoned the priests and Levites to meet him at the open space east of the Temple and addressed them thus : “ Listen to me , you Levites . Sanctify yourselves and sanctify the Temple of the Lord God of your ancestors—clean all the debris from the holy place .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	29	6	For our fathers have committed a deep sin before the Lord our God ; they abandoned the Lord and his Temple and turned their backs on it .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	29	7	The doors have been shut tight , the perpetual flame has been put out , and the incense and burnt offerings have not been offered .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	29	8	Therefore , the wrath of the Lord has been upon Judah and Jerusalem . He has caused us to be objects of horror , amazement , and contempt , as you see us today .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	29	9	Our fathers have been killed in war , and our sons and daughters and wives are in captivity because of this .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	29	10	“ But now I want to make a covenant with the Lord God of Israel so that his fierce anger will turn away from us .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	29	11	My children , don ’ t neglect your duties any longer , for the Lord has chosen you to minister to him and to burn incense. ” 12-14 Then the Levites went into action : From the Kohath clan , Mahath ( son of Amasai ) and Joel ( son of Azariah ) ; From the Merari clan , Kish ( son of Abdi ) and Azariah ( son of Jehallelel ) ; From the Gershon clan , Joah ( son of Zimmah ) and Eden ( son of Joah ) . From the Elizaphan clan , Shimri and Jeuel ; From the Asaph clan , Zechariah and Mattaniah ; From the Hemanite clan , Jehuel and Shimei ; From the Jeduthun clan , Shemaiah and Uzziel .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	29	15	They in turn summoned their fellow Levites and sanctified themselves , and began to clean up and sanctify the Temple , as the king ( who was speaking for the Lord ) had commanded them .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	29	16	The priests cleaned up the inner room of the Temple and brought out into the court all the filth and decay they found there . The Levites then carted it out to Kidron Brook .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	29	17	This all began on the first day of April , and by the eighth day they had reached the outer court , which took eight days to clean up , so the entire job was completed in sixteen days .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	29	18	Then they went back to the palace and reported to King Hezekiah , “ We have completed the cleansing of the Temple and of the altar of burnt offerings and of its accessories , also the table of the Bread of the Presence and its equipment .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	29	19	What ’ s more , we have recovered and sanctified all the utensils thrown away by King Ahaz when he closed the Temple . They are beside the altar of the Lord. ”
TLB	2%20Chronicles	29	20	Early the next morning King Hezekiah went to the Temple with the city officials ,
TLB	2%20Chronicles	29	21	taking seven young bulls , seven rams , seven lambs , and seven male goats for a sin offering for the nation and for the Temple . He instructed the priests , the sons of Aaron , to sacrifice them on the altar of the Lord .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	29	22	So they killed the young bulls , and the priests took the blood and sprinkled it on the altar , and they killed the rams and sprinkled their blood upon the altar , and did the same with the lambs .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	29	23	The male goats for the sin offering were then brought before the king and his officials , who laid their hands upon them .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	29	24	Then the priests killed the animals and made a sin offering with their blood upon the altar to make atonement for all Israel , as the king had commanded—for the king had specified that the burnt offering and sin offering must be sacrificed for the entire nation . 25-26 He organized Levites at the Temple into an orchestral group , using cymbals , psalteries , and harps . This was in accordance with the directions of David and the prophets Gad and Nathan , who had received their instructions from the Lord . The priests formed a trumpet corps .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	29	27	Then Hezekiah ordered the burnt offering to be placed upon the altar , and as the sacrifice began , the instruments of music began to play the songs of the Lord , accompanied by the trumpets .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	29	28	Throughout the entire ceremony everyone worshiped the Lord as the singers sang and the trumpets blew .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	29	30	Then King Hezekiah ordered the Levites to sing before the Lord some of the psalms of David and of the prophet Asaph , which they gladly did , and bowed their heads and worshiped .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	29	31	“ The consecration ceremony is now ended , ” Hezekiah said . “ Now bring your sacrifices and thank offerings. ” So the people from every part of the nation brought their sacrifices and thank offerings , and those who wished to brought burnt offerings too . 32-33 In all , there were
TLB	2%20Chronicles	29	70	young bulls for burnt offerings ,
TLB	2%20Chronicles	29	100	rams , and
TLB	2%20Chronicles	29	200	lambs . In addition ,
TLB	2%20Chronicles	29	600	oxen and 3,000 sheep were brought as holy gifts .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	29	34	But there were too few priests to prepare the burnt offerings , so their brothers the Levites helped them until the work was finished—and until more priests had reported to work—for the Levites were much more ready to sanctify themselves than the priests were .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	29	35	There was an abundance of burnt offerings , and the usual drink offering with each , and many peace offerings . So it was that the Temple was restored to service , and the sacrifices offered again .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	29	36	And Hezekiah and all the people were very happy because of what God had accomplished so quickly . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	2%20Chronicles	30	2	Chronicles 30:5 They had not kept it in great numbers as prescribed , or “ The Passover had not been celebrated by the northern tribes of Israel for a long time ; only a faithful few had been doing it in the proper way. ” The Living Bible copyright ©
TLB	2%20Chronicles	30	30	King Hezekiah now sent letters throughout all of Israel , Judah , Ephraim , and Manasseh , inviting everyone to come to the Temple at Jerusalem for the annual Passover celebration . 2-3 The king , his aides , and all the assembly of Jerusalem had voted to celebrate the Passover in May this time , rather than at the normal time in April , because not enough priests were sanctified at the earlier date , and there wasn ’ t enough time to get notices out .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	30	4	The king and his advisors were in complete agreement in this matter ,
TLB	2%20Chronicles	30	5	so they sent a Passover proclamation throughout Israel , from Dan to Beersheba , inviting everyone . They had not kept it in great numbers as prescribed . [ a ]
TLB	2%20Chronicles	30	6	“ Come back to the Lord God of Abraham , Isaac , and Israel , ” the king ’ s letter said , “ so that he will return to us who have escaped from the power of the kings of Assyria .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	30	7	Do not be like your fathers and brothers who sinned against the Lord God of their fathers and were destroyed .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	30	8	Do not be stubborn , as they were , but yield yourselves to the Lord and come to his Temple which he has sanctified forever , and worship the Lord your God so that his fierce anger will turn away from you .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	30	9	For if you turn to the Lord again , your brothers and your children will be treated mercifully by their captors , and they will be able to return to this land . For the Lord your God is full of kindness and mercy and will not continue to turn away his face from you if you return to him. ”
TLB	2%20Chronicles	30	10	So the messengers went from city to city throughout Ephraim and Manasseh and as far as Zebulun . But for the most part they were received with laughter and scorn !
TLB	2%20Chronicles	30	11	However , some from the tribes of Asher , Manasseh , and Zebulun turned to God and came to Jerusalem .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	30	12	But in Judah the entire nation felt a strong , God-given desire to obey the Lord ’ s direction as commanded by the king and his officers .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	30	13	And so it was that a very large crowd assembled at Jerusalem in the month of May for the Passover celebration .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	30	14	They set to work and destroyed the heathen altars in Jerusalem , and knocked down all the incense altars , and threw them into Kidron Brook .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	30	15	On the first day of May the people killed their Passover lambs . Then the priests and Levites became ashamed of themselves for not taking a more active part , so they sanctified themselves and brought burnt offerings into the Temple .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	30	16	They stood at their posts as instructed by the law of Moses the man of God ; and the priests sprinkled the blood received from the Levites . 17-19 Since many of the people arriving from Ephraim , Manasseh , Issachar , and Zebulun were ceremonially impure because they had not undergone the purification rites , the Levites killed their Passover lambs for them , to sanctify them . Then King Hezekiah prayed for them , and they were permitted to eat the Passover anyway , even though this was contrary to God ’ s rules . But Hezekiah said , “ May the good Lord pardon everyone who determines to follow the Lord God of his fathers , even though he is not properly sanctified for the ceremony. ”
TLB	2%20Chronicles	30	20	And the Lord listened to Hezekiah ’ s prayer and did not destroy them .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	30	21	So the people of Israel celebrated the Passover at Jerusalem for seven days with great joy . Meanwhile the Levites and priests praised the Lord with music and cymbals day after day .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	30	22	( King Hezekiah spoke very appreciatively to the Levites of their excellent music . ) So for seven days the observance continued , and peace offerings were sacrificed , and the people confessed their sins to the Lord God of their fathers .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	30	23	The enthusiasm continued , so it was unanimously decided to continue the observance for another seven days .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	30	24	King Hezekiah gave the people 1,000 young bulls for offerings and 7,000 sheep ; and the princes donated 1,000 young bulls and 10,000 sheep . And at this time another large group of priests stepped forward and sanctified themselves .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	30	25	Then the people of Judah , together with the priests , the Levites , the foreign residents , and the visitors from Israel , were filled with deep joy .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	30	26	For Jerusalem hadn ’ t seen a celebration like this one since the days of King David ’ s son Solomon .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	30	27	Then the priests and Levites stood and blessed the people , and the Lord heard their prayers from his holy temple in heaven . Footnotes -

TLB	2%20Chronicles	31	31	Afterwards a massive campaign against idol worship was begun . Those who were at Jerusalem for the Passover went out to the cities of Judah , Benjamin , Ephraim , and Manasseh and tore down the idol altars , the obelisks , the shameful images , and other heathen centers of worship . Then the people who had come to the Passover from the northern tribes returned again to their own homes .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	31	3	He also made a personal contribution of animals for the daily morning and evening burnt offerings , as well as for the weekly Sabbath and monthly new moon festivals , and for the other annual feasts as required in the law of God .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	31	4	In addition , he required the people in Jerusalem to bring their tithes to the priests and Levites so that they wouldn ’ t need other employment but could apply themselves fully to their duties as required in the law of God . 5-6 The people responded immediately and generously with the first of their crops and grain , new wine , olive oil , honey , and everything else—a tithe of all they owned , as required by law to be given to the Lord their God . Everything was laid out in great piles . The people who had moved to Judah from the northern tribes and the people of Judah living in the provinces also brought in the tithes of their cattle and sheep , and brought a tithe of the dedicated things to give to the Lord , and piled them up in great heaps . 7-8 The first of these tithes arrived in June , and the piles continued to grow until October . When Hezekiah and his officials came and saw these huge piles , how they blessed the Lord and praised his people !
TLB	2%20Chronicles	31	9	“ Where did all this come from ? ” Hezekiah asked the priests and Levites .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	31	10	And Azariah the High Priest from the clan of Zadok replied , “ These are tithes ! We have been eating from these stores of food for many weeks , but all this is left over , for the Lord has blessed his people. ”
TLB	2%20Chronicles	31	11	Hezekiah decided to prepare storerooms in the Temple . 12-13 All the dedicated supplies were brought into the Lord ’ s house . Conaniah the Levite was put in charge , assisted by his brother Shimei and the following aides : Jehiel , Azaziah , Nahath , Asahel , Jerimoth , Jozabad , Eliel , Ismachiah , Mahath , Benaiah . These appointments were made by King Hezekiah and Azariah the High Priest . 14-15 Kore ( son of Imnah , the Levite ) , who was the gatekeeper at the East Gate , was put in charge of distributing the offerings to the priests . His faithful assistants were Eden , Miniamin , Jeshua , Shemaiah , Amariah , and Shecaniah . They distributed the gifts to the clans of priests in their cities , dividing them to young and old alike .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	31	16	However , the priests on duty at the Temple and their families [ a ] were supplied directly from there , so they were not included in this distribution . 17-18 The priests were listed in the genealogical register by clans , and the Levites twenty years old and older were listed under the names of their work corps . A regular food allotment was given to all families of properly registered priests , for they had no other source of income because their time and energies were devoted to the service of the Temple .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	31	19	One of the priests was appointed in each of the cities of the priests to issue food and other supplies to all priests in the area and to all registered Levites .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	31	20	In this way King Hezekiah handled the distribution throughout all Judah , doing what was just and fair in the sight of the Lord his God .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	31	21	He worked very hard to encourage respect for the Temple , the law , and godly living , and was very successful . Footnotes -

TLB	2%20Chronicles	32	2	When it was clear that Sennacherib was intending to attack Jerusalem ,
TLB	2%20Chronicles	32	32	The rest of the story of Hezekiah and all of the good things he did are written in The Book of Isaiah ( the prophet , the son of Amoz ) , and in The Annals of the Kings of Judah and Israel .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	32	3	Hezekiah summoned his princes and officers for a council of war , and it was decided to plug the springs outside the city .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	32	4	They organized a huge work crew to block them and to cut off the brook running through the fields . “ Why should the king of Assyria come and find water ? ” they asked .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	32	5	Then Hezekiah further strengthened his defenses by repairing the wall wherever it was broken down , and by adding to the fortifications , and constructing a second wall outside it . He also reinforced Fort Millo in the City of David and manufactured large numbers of weapons and shields .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	32	6	He recruited an army and appointed officers , and summoned them to the plains before the city , and encouraged them with this address :
TLB	2%20Chronicles	32	7	“ Be strong , be brave , and do not be afraid of the king of Assyria or his mighty army , for there is someone with us who is far greater than he is !
TLB	2%20Chronicles	32	8	He has a great army , but they are all mere men , while we have the Lord our God to fight our battles for us ! ” This greatly encouraged them .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	32	9	Then King Sennacherib of Assyria , while still besieging the city of Lachish , sent ambassadors with this message to King Hezekiah and the citizens of Jerusalem :
TLB	2%20Chronicles	32	10	“ King Sennacherib of Assyria asks , ‘ Do you think you can survive my siege of Jerusalem ?
TLB	2%20Chronicles	32	11	King Hezekiah is trying to persuade you to commit suicide by staying there—to die by famine and thirst—while he promises that “ the Lord our God will deliver us from the king of Assyria ” !
TLB	2%20Chronicles	32	12	Don ’ t you realize that Hezekiah is the very person who destroyed all the idols , and commanded Judah and Jerusalem to use only the one altar at the Temple , and to burn incense upon it alone ?
TLB	2%20Chronicles	32	13	Don ’ t you realize that I and the other kings of Assyria before me have never yet failed to conquer a nation we attacked ? The gods of those nations weren ’ t able to do a thing to save their lands !
TLB	2%20Chronicles	32	14	Name just one time when anyone , anywhere , was able to resist us successfully . What makes you think your God can do any better ?
TLB	2%20Chronicles	32	15	Don ’ t let Hezekiah fool you ! Don ’ t believe him . I say it again—no god of any nation has ever yet been able to rescue his people from me or my ancestors ; how much less your God ! ’ ”
TLB	2%20Chronicles	32	16	Thus the ambassador mocked the Lord God and God ’ s servant Hezekiah , heaping up insults .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	32	17	King Sennacherib also sent letters scorning the Lord God of Israel . “ The gods of all the other nations failed to save their people from my hand , and the God of Hezekiah will fail too , ” he wrote .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	32	18	The messengers who brought the letters shouted threats in the Jewish language to the people gathered on the walls of the city , trying to frighten and dishearten them .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	32	19	These messengers talked about the God of Jerusalem just as though he were one of the heathen gods—a handmade idol !
TLB	2%20Chronicles	32	20	Then King Hezekiah and Isaiah the prophet ( son of Amoz ) cried out in prayer to God in heaven ,
TLB	2%20Chronicles	32	21	and the Lord sent an angel who destroyed the Assyrian army with all its officers and generals ! So Sennacherib returned home in deep shame to his own land . And when he arrived at the temple of his god , some of his own sons killed him there .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	32	22	That is how the Lord saved Hezekiah and the people of Jerusalem . And now there was peace at last throughout his realm .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	32	23	From then on King Hezekiah became immensely respected among the surrounding nations , and many gifts for the Lord arrived at Jerusalem , with valuable presents for King Hezekiah too .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	32	24	But about that time Hezekiah became deathly sick , and he prayed to the Lord , and the Lord replied with a miracle .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	32	25	However , Hezekiah didn ’ t respond with true thanksgiving and praise for he had become proud , and so the anger of God was upon him and upon Judah and Jerusalem .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	32	26	But finally Hezekiah and the residents of Jerusalem humbled themselves , so the wrath of the Lord did not fall upon them during Hezekiah ’ s lifetime .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	32	27	So Hezekiah became very wealthy and was highly honored . He had to construct special treasury buildings for his silver , gold , precious stones , and spices , and for his shields and gold bowls . 28-29 He also built many storehouses for his grain , new wine , and olive oil , with many stalls for his animals and folds for the great flocks of sheep and goats he purchased ; and he acquired many towns , for God had given him great wealth .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	32	30	He dammed up Gihon ’ s Upper Spring and brought the water down through an aqueduct to the west side of the City of David sector in Jerusalem . He prospered in everything he did .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	32	31	However , when ambassadors arrived from Babylon to find out about the miracle of his being healed , God left him to himself in order to test him and to see what he was really like .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	32	33	When Hezekiah died , he was buried in the royal hillside cemetery among the other kings , and all Judah and Jerusalem honored him at his death . Then his son Manasseh became the new king . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	2%20Chronicles	33	2	But it was an evil reign , for he encouraged his people to worship the idols of the heathen nations destroyed by the Lord when the people of Israel entered the land .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	33	33	Manasseh was only twelve years old when he became king , and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	33	3	He rebuilt the heathen altars his father Hezekiah had destroyed—the altars of Baal , and of the shameful images , and of the sun , moon , and stars . 4-5 He even constructed heathen altars in both courts of the Temple of the Lord for worshiping the sun , moon , and stars—in the very place where the Lord had said that he would be honored forever .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	33	6	And Manasseh sacrificed his own children as burnt offerings in the valley of Hinnom . He consulted spirit-mediums , too , and fortune-tellers and sorcerers , and encouraged every sort of evil , making the Lord very angry .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	33	7	Think of it ! He placed an idol in the very Temple of God , where God had told David and his son Solomon , “ I will be honored here in this Temple and in Jerusalem—the city I have chosen to be honored forever above all the other cities of Israel .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	33	8	And if you will only obey my commands—all the laws and instructions given to you by Moses—I won ’ t ever again exile Israel from this land which I gave your ancestors. ”
TLB	2%20Chronicles	33	9	But Manasseh encouraged the people of Judah and Jerusalem to do even more evil than the nations the Lord destroyed when Israel entered the land .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	33	10	Warnings from the Lord were ignored by both Manasseh and his people .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	33	11	So God sent the Assyrian armies , and they seized him with hooks and bound him with bronze chains and carted him away to Babylon .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	33	12	Then at last he came to his senses and cried out humbly to God for help .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	33	13	And the Lord listened and answered his plea by returning him to Jerusalem and to his kingdom ! At that point Manasseh finally realized that the Lord was really God !
TLB	2%20Chronicles	33	14	It was after this that he rebuilt the outer wall of the City of David and the wall from west of the spring of Gihon in the Kidron Valley , and then to the Fish Gate , and around Citadel Hill , where it was built very high . And he stationed his army generals in all of the fortified cities of Judah .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	33	15	He also removed the foreign gods from the hills and took his idol from the Temple , and tore down the altars he had built on the mountain , where the Temple stood , and the altars that were in Jerusalem , and dumped them outside the city .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	33	16	Then he rebuilt the altar of the Lord and offered sacrifices upon it—peace offerings and thanksgiving offerings—and demanded that the people of Judah worship the Lord God of Israel .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	33	17	However , the people still sacrificed upon the altars on the hills , but only to the Lord their God .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	33	18	The rest of Manasseh ’ s deeds , and his prayer to God , and God ’ s reply through the prophets—this is all written in The Annals of the Kings of Israel .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	33	19	His prayer , and the way God answered , and a frank account of his sins and errors , including a list of the locations where he built idols on the hills and set up shameful and graven images ( this of course was before the great change in his attitude ) , are recorded in The Annals of the Prophets . 20-21 When Manasseh died , he was buried beneath his own palace , and his son Amon became the new king . Amon was twenty-two years old when he began to reign in Jerusalem , but he lasted for only two years .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	33	22	It was an evil reign like the early years of his father Manasseh ; for Amon sacrificed to all the idols just as his father had .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	33	23	But he didn ’ t change as his father did ; instead he sinned more and more .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	33	24	At last his own officers assassinated him in his palace .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	33	25	But some public-spirited citizens killed all of those who assassinated him and declared his son Josiah to be the new king . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	2%20Chronicles	34	2	His was a good reign , as he carefully followed the good example of his ancestor King David .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	34	34	Josiah was only eight years old when he became king . He reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	34	3	For when he was sixteen years old , in the eighth year of his reign , he began to search for the God of his ancestor David ; and four years later he began to clean up Judah and Jerusalem , destroying the heathen altars and the shameful idols on the hills .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	34	4	He went out personally to watch as the altars of Baal were knocked apart , the obelisks above the altars chopped down , and the shameful idols ground into dust and scattered over the graves of those who had sacrificed to them .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	34	5	Then he burned the bones of the heathen priests upon their own altars , feeling that this action would clear the people of Judah and Jerusalem from the guilt of their sin of idol worship .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	34	6	Then he went to the cities of Manasseh , Ephraim , and Simeon , even to distant Naphtali , and did the same thing there .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	34	7	He broke down the heathen altars , ground to powder the shameful idols , and chopped down the obelisks . He did this everywhere throughout the whole land of Israel before returning to Jerusalem .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	34	8	During the eighteenth year of his reign , after he had purged the land and cleaned up the situation at the Temple , he appointed Shaphan ( son of Azaliah ) and Maaseiah , governor of Jerusalem , and Joah ( son of Joahaz ) , the city treasurer , to repair the Temple .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	34	9	They set up a collection system for gifts for the Temple . The money was collected at the Temple gates by the Levites on guard duty there . Gifts were brought by the people coming from Manasseh , Ephraim , and other parts of the remnant of Israel , as well as from the people of Jerusalem . The money was taken to Hilkiah the High Priest for accounting , 10-11 and then used by the Levites to pay the carpenters and stonemasons and to purchase building materials—stone building blocks , timber , lumber , and beams . He now rebuilt what earlier kings of Judah had torn down .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	34	12	The workmen were energetic under the leadership of Jahath and Obadiah , Levites of the subclan of Merari . Zechariah and Meshullam , of the subclan of Kohath , were the building superintendents . The Levites who were skilled musicians played background music while the work progressed .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	34	13	Other Levites superintended the unskilled laborers who carried in the materials to the workmen . Still others assisted as accountants , supervisors , and carriers .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	34	14	One day when Hilkiah the High Priest was at the Temple recording the money collected at the gates , he found an old scroll that turned out to be the laws of God as given to Moses ! 15-16 “ Look ! ” Hilkiah exclaimed to Shaphan , the king ’ s secretary . “ See what I have found in the Temple ! These are the laws of God ! ” Hilkiah gave the scroll to Shaphan , and Shaphan took it to the king , along with his report that there was good progress being made in the reconstruction of the Temple .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	34	17	“ The money chests have been opened and counted , and the money has been put into the hand of the overseers and workmen , ” he said to the king .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	34	18	Then he mentioned the scroll and how Hilkiah had discovered it . So he read it to the king .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	34	19	When the king heard what these laws required of God ’ s people , he ripped his clothing in despair
TLB	2%20Chronicles	34	20	and summoned Hilkiah , Ahikam ( son of Shaphan ) , Abdon ( son of Micah ) , Shaphan the treasurer , and Asaiah , the king ’ s personal aide .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	34	21	“ Go to the Temple and plead with the Lord for me ! ” the king told them . “ Pray for all the remnant of Israel and Judah ! For this scroll says that the reason the Lord ’ s great anger has been poured out upon us is that our ancestors have not obeyed these laws that are written here. ”
TLB	2%20Chronicles	34	22	So the men went to Huldah the prophetess , the wife of Shallum ( son of Tokhath , son of Hasrah ) . ( Shallum was the king ’ s tailor , living in the second ward . ) When they told her of the king ’ s trouble ,
TLB	2%20Chronicles	34	23	she replied , “ The Lord God of Israel says , Tell the man who sent you ,
TLB	2%20Chronicles	34	24	“ ‘ Yes , the Lord will destroy this city and its people . All the curses written in the scroll will come true .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	34	25	For my people have forsaken me and have worshiped heathen gods , and I am very angry with them for their deeds . Therefore , my unquenchable wrath is poured out upon this place. ’
TLB	2%20Chronicles	34	26	“ But the Lord also says this to the king of Judah who sent you to ask me about this : Tell him , the Lord God of Israel says ,
TLB	2%20Chronicles	34	27	‘ Because you are sorry and have humbled yourself before God when you heard my words against this city and its people , and have ripped your clothing in despair and wept before me—I have heard you , says the Lord ,
TLB	2%20Chronicles	34	28	and I will not send the promised evil upon this city and its people until after your death. ’ ” So they brought back to the king this word from the Lord .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	34	29	Then the king summoned all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem ,
TLB	2%20Chronicles	34	30	and the priests and Levites and all the people great and small , to accompany him to the Temple . There the king read the scroll to them—the covenant of God that was found in the Temple .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	34	31	As the king stood before them , he made a pledge to the Lord to follow his commandments with all his heart and soul and to do what was written in the scroll .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	34	32	And he required everyone in Jerusalem and Benjamin to subscribe to this pact with God , and all of them did .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	34	33	So Josiah removed all idols from the areas occupied by the Jews and required all of them to worship Jehovah their God . And throughout the remainder of his lifetime they continued serving Jehovah , the God of their ancestors . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	2%20Chronicles	35	2	He also reestablished the priests in their duties and encouraged them to begin their work at the Temple again .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	35	35	Then Josiah announced that the Passover would be celebrated on the first day of April in Jerusalem . The Passover lambs were slain that evening .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	35	3	He issued this order to the sanctified Levites , the religious teachers in Israel : “ Since the Ark is now in Solomon ’ s Temple and you don ’ t need to carry it back and forth upon your shoulders , spend your time ministering to the Lord and to his people . 4-5 Form yourselves into the traditional service corps of your ancestors , as first organized by King David of Israel and by his son Solomon . Each corps will assist particular clans of the people who bring in their offerings to the Temple .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	35	6	Kill the Passover lambs and sanctify yourselves and prepare to assist the people who come . Follow all of the instructions of the Lord through Moses. ”
TLB	2%20Chronicles	35	7	Then the king contributed 30,000 lambs and young goats for the people ’ s Passover offerings and 3,000 young bulls .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	35	8	The king ’ s officials made willing contributions to the priests and Levites . Hilkiah , Zechariah , and Jehiel , the overseers of the Temple , gave the priests 2,600 sheep and goats and
TLB	2%20Chronicles	35	300	oxen as Passover offerings .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	35	9	The Levite leaders—Conaniah , Shemaiah , and Nethanel , and his brothers Hashabiah , Jeiel , and Jozabad—gave 5,000 sheep and goats and
TLB	2%20Chronicles	35	500	oxen to the Levites for their Passover offerings .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	35	10	When everything was organized and the priests were standing in their places , and the Levites were formed into service corps as the king had instructed ,
TLB	2%20Chronicles	35	11	then the Levites killed the Passover lambs and presented the blood to the priests , who sprinkled it upon the altar as the Levites removed the skins .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	35	12	They piled up the carcasses for each tribe to present its own burnt sacrifices to the Lord , as it is written in the law of Moses . They did the same with the oxen .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	35	13	Then , as directed by the laws of Moses , they roasted the Passover lambs and boiled the holy offerings in pots , kettles , and pans , and hurried them out to the people to eat .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	35	14	Afterwards the Levites prepared a meal for themselves and for the priests , for they had been busy from morning till night offering the fat of the burnt offerings .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	35	15	The singers ( the sons of Asaph ) were in their places , following directions issued centuries earlier by King David , Asaph , Heman , and Jeduthun the king ’ s prophet . The gatekeepers guarded the gates and didn ’ t need to leave their posts of duty , for their meals were brought to them by their Levite brothers .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	35	16	The entire Passover ceremony was completed in that one day . All the burnt offerings were sacrificed upon the altar of the Lord , as Josiah had instructed .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	35	17	Everyone present in Jerusalem took part in the Passover observance , and this was followed by the Feast of Unleavened Bread for the next seven days .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	35	18	Never since the time of Samuel the prophet had there been such a Passover—not one of the kings of Israel could vie with King Josiah in this respect , involving so many of the priests , Levites , and people from Jerusalem and from all parts of Judah , and from Israel .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	35	19	This all happened in the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	35	20	Afterwards King Neco of Egypt led his army to Carchemish on the Euphrates River , and Josiah declared war on him .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	35	21	But King Neco sent ambassadors to Josiah with this message : “ I don ’ t want a fight with you , O king of Judah ! I have come only to fight the power with which I am at war . Leave me alone ! God has told me to hurry ! Don ’ t meddle with God or he will destroy you , for he is with me. ”
TLB	2%20Chronicles	35	22	But Josiah refused to turn back . Instead he led his army into the battle at the valley of Megiddo . ( He laid aside his royal robes so that the enemy wouldn ’ t recognize him . ) Josiah refused to believe that Neco ’ s message was from God .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	35	23	The enemy archers struck King Josiah with their arrows and fatally wounded him . “ Take me out of the battle , ” he exclaimed to his aides . 24-25 So they lifted him out of his chariot and placed him in his second chariot and brought him back to Jerusalem where he died . He was buried there in the royal cemetery . And all Judah and Jerusalem , including even Jeremiah the prophet , mourned for him , as did the Temple choirs . To this day they still sing sad songs about his death , for these songs of sorrow were recorded among the official lamentations .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	35	26	The other activities of Josiah , and his good deeds , and how he followed the laws of the Lord ,

TLB	2%20Chronicles	36	2	Chronicles 36:9 eighteen . Some manuscripts read “ eight years old. ” The Living Bible copyright ©
TLB	2%20Chronicles	36	36	Josiah ’ s son Jehoahaz was selected as the new king .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	36	3	Then he was deposed by the king of Egypt , who demanded an annual tribute from Judah of $ 230,000 .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	36	4	The king of Egypt now appointed Eliakim , the brother of Jehoahaz , as the new king of Judah . ( Eliakim ’ s name was changed to Jehoiakim . ) Jehoahaz was taken to Egypt as a prisoner .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	36	5	Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king , and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem ; but his reign was an evil one .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	36	6	Finally Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon conquered Jerusalem and took away the king in chains to Babylon .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	36	7	Nebuchadnezzar also took some of the gold bowls and other items from the Temple , placing them in his own temple in Babylon .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	36	8	The rest of the deeds of Jehoiakim and all the evil he did are written in The Annals of the Kings of Judah ; and his son Jehoiachin became the new king .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	36	9	Jehoiachin was eighteen [ a ] years old when he ascended the throne . But he lasted only three months and ten days , and it was an evil reign as far as the Lord was concerned .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	36	10	The following spring he was summoned to Babylon by King Nebuchadnezzar . Many treasures from the Temple were taken away to Babylon at that time , and King Nebuchadnezzar appointed Jehoiachin ’ s brother Zedekiah as the new king of Judah and Jerusalem .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	36	11	Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	36	12	His reign , too , was evil so far as the Lord was concerned , for he refused to take the counsel of Jeremiah the prophet , who gave him messages from the Lord .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	36	13	He rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar , even though he had taken an oath of loyalty . Zedekiah was a hard and stubborn man so far as obeying the Lord God of Israel was concerned , for he refused to follow him .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	36	14	All the important people of the nation , including the High Priests , worshiped the heathen idols of the surrounding nations , thus polluting the Temple of the Lord in Jerusalem .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	36	15	Jehovah the God of their fathers sent his prophets again and again to warn them , for he had compassion on his people and on his Temple .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	36	16	But the people mocked these messengers of God and despised their words , scoffing at the prophets until the anger of the Lord could no longer be restrained , and there was no longer any remedy .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	36	17	Then the Lord brought the king of Babylon against them and killed their young men , even going after them right into the Temple , and had no pity upon them , killing even young girls and old men . The Lord used the king of Babylon to destroy them completely .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	36	18	He also took home with him all the items , great and small , used in the Temple , and treasures from both the Temple and the palace , and took with him all the royal princes .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	36	19	Then his army burned the Temple and broke down the walls of Jerusalem and burned all the palaces and destroyed all the valuable Temple utensils .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	36	20	Those who survived were taken away to Babylon as slaves to the king and his sons until the kingdom of Persia conquered Babylon .
TLB	2%20Chronicles	36	21	Thus the word of the Lord spoken through Jeremiah came true , that the land must rest for seventy years to make up for the years when the people refused to observe the Sabbath . 22-23 But in the first year of King Cyrus of Persia , the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus to make this proclamation throughout his kingdom , putting it into writing : “ All the kingdoms of the earth have been given to me by the Lord God of heaven , and he has instructed me to build him a Temple in Jerusalem , in the land of Judah . All among you who are the Lord ’ s people return to Israel for this task , and the Lord be with you. ” This also fulfilled the prediction of Jeremiah the prophet . Footnotes -

TLB	Ezra	1	1	During the first year of the reign of King Cyrus of Persia , the Lord fulfilled Jeremiah ’ s prophecy [ a ] by giving King Cyrus the desire to send this proclamation throughout his empire ( he also put it into the permanent records of the realm ) :
TLB	Ezra	1	2	“ Cyrus , king of Persia , hereby announces that Jehovah , the God of heaven who gave me my vast empire , has now given me the responsibility of building him a Temple in Jerusalem , in the land of Judah .
TLB	Ezra	1	3	All Jews throughout the kingdom may now return to Jerusalem to rebuild this Temple of Jehovah , who is the God of Israel and of Jerusalem . May his blessings rest upon you .
TLB	Ezra	1	4	Those Jews [ b ] who do not go should contribute toward the expenses of those who do and also supply them with clothing , transportation , supplies for the journey , and a freewill offering for the Temple. ”
TLB	Ezra	1	5	Then God gave a great desire to the leaders of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin , and to the priests and Levites , to return to Jerusalem at once to rebuild the Temple .
TLB	Ezra	1	6	And all the Jewish exiles who chose to remain in Persia gave them whatever assistance they could , as well as gifts for the Temple .
TLB	Ezra	1	7	King Cyrus himself donated the gold bowls and other valuable items , which King Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the Temple at Jerusalem and had placed in the temple of his own gods .
TLB	Ezra	1	8	He instructed Mithredath , the treasurer of Persia , to present these gifts to Sheshbazzar , the leader of the exiles returning to Judah . 9-10 The items Cyrus donated included : 1,000 gold trays , 1,000 silver trays ,
TLB	Ezra	1	29	censers ,
TLB	Ezra	1	30	bowls of solid gold , 2,410 silver bowls ( of various designs ) , 1,000 miscellaneous items .

TLB	Ezra	2	74	; The choir members from the clan of Asaph ,
TLB	Ezra	2	139	. 43-54 The following families of the Temple assistants were represented : Ziha , Hasupha , Tabbaoth , Keros , Siaha , Padon , Lebanah , Hagabah , Akkub , Hagab , Shamlai , Hanan , Giddel , Gahar , Reaiah , Rezin , Nekoda , Gazzam , Uzza , Paseah , Besai , Asnah , Meunim , Nephisim , Bakbuk , Hakupha , Harhur , Bazluth , Mehida , Harsha , Barkos , Sisera , Temah , Neziah , Hatipha . 55-57 Those who made the trip also included the descendants of King Solomon ’ s officials : Sotai , Hassophereth , Peruda , Jaalah , Darkon , Giddel , Shephatiah , Hattil , Pochereth-hazzebaim , Ami .
TLB	Ezra	2	58	The Temple assistants and the descendants of Solomon ’ s officers numbered
TLB	Ezra	2	392	.
TLB	Ezra	2	59	Another group returned to Jerusalem at this time from the Persian cities of Tel-melah , Tel-harsha , Cherub , Addan , and Immer . However , they had lost their genealogies and could not prove that they were really Israelites .
TLB	Ezra	2	60	This group included the subclans of Delaiah , Tobiah , and Nekoda—a total of
TLB	Ezra	2	652	.
TLB	Ezra	2	61	Three subclans of priests—Habaiah , Hakkoz , and Barzillai ( he married one of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite and took her family name ) —also returned to Jerusalem . 62-63 But they too had lost their genealogies , so the leaders refused to allow them to continue as priests ; they would not even allow them to eat the priests ’ share of food from the sacrifices until the Urim and Thummim could be consulted to find out from God whether they actually were descendants of priests or not . 64-65 So a total of 42,360 persons returned to Judah ; in addition to 7,337 slaves and
TLB	Ezra	2	200	choir members , both men and women . 66-67 They took with them
TLB	Ezra	2	736	horses ,
TLB	Ezra	2	245	mules ,
TLB	Ezra	2	435	camels , and 6,720 donkeys .
TLB	Ezra	2	68	Some of the leaders were able to give generously toward the rebuilding of the Temple ,
TLB	Ezra	2	69	and each gave as much as he could . The total value of their gifts amounted to $ 300,000 of gold , $ 170,000 of silver , and
TLB	Ezra	2	100	robes for the priests .
TLB	Ezra	2	70	So the priests and Levites and some of the common people settled in Jerusalem and its nearby villages ; and the singers , the gatekeepers , the Temple workers , and the rest of the people returned to the other cities of Judah from which they had come .

TLB	Ezra	3	3	The altar was rebuilt on its old site , and it was used immediately to sacrifice morning and evening burnt offerings to the Lord ; for the people were fearful of attack .
TLB	Ezra	3	4	And they celebrated the Feast of Tabernacles as prescribed in the laws of Moses , sacrificing the burnt offerings specified for each day of the feast .
TLB	Ezra	3	5	They also offered the special sacrifices required for the Sabbaths , the new moon celebrations , and the other regular annual feasts of the Lord . Voluntary offerings of the people were also sacrificed .
TLB	Ezra	3	6	It was on the fifteenth day of September [ a ] that the priests began sacrificing the burnt offerings to the Lord . ( This was before they began building the foundation of the Temple . )
TLB	Ezra	3	7	Then they hired masons and carpenters and bought cedar logs from the people of Tyre and Sidon , paying for them with food , wine , and olive oil . The logs were brought down from the Lebanon mountains and floated along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea to Joppa , for King Cyrus had included this provision in his grant .
TLB	Ezra	3	8	The actual construction of the Temple began in June of the second year of their arrival at Jerusalem . The work force was made up of all those who had returned , and they were under the direction of Zerubbabel ( son of Shealtiel ) , Jeshua ( son of Jozadak ) , and their fellow priests and the Levites . The Levites who were twenty years old or older were appointed to supervise the workmen .
TLB	Ezra	3	9	The supervision of the entire project was given to Jeshua , Kadmiel , Henadad , and their sons and relatives , all of whom were Levites .
TLB	Ezra	3	10	When the builders completed the foundation of the Temple , the priests put on their official robes and blew their trumpets ; and the descendants of Asaph crashed their cymbals to praise the Lord in the manner ordained by King David .
TLB	Ezra	3	11	They sang rounds of praise and thanks to God , singing this song : “ He is good , and his love and mercy toward Israel will last forever. ” Then all the people gave a great shout , praising God because the foundation of the Temple had been laid .
TLB	Ezra	3	12	But many of the priests and Levites and other leaders—the old men who remembered Solomon ’ s beautiful Temple—wept aloud , while others were shouting for joy !
TLB	Ezra	3	13	So the shouting and the weeping mingled together in a loud commotion that could be heard far away ! Footnotes - Ezra 3:6 the fifteenth day of September , literally , “ the first day of the seventh month ” of the Hebrew calendar . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Ezra	4	4	When the enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard that the exiles had returned and were rebuilding the Temple ,
TLB	Ezra	4	2	they approached Zerubbabel and the other leaders and suggested , “ Let us work with you , for we are just as interested in your God as you are ; we have sacrificed to him ever since King Esar-haddon of Assyria brought us here. ”
TLB	Ezra	4	3	But Zerubbabel and Jeshua and the other Jewish leaders replied , “ No , you may have no part in this work . The Temple of the God of Israel must be built by the Israelis , just as King Cyrus has commanded. ” 4-5 Then the local residents tried to discourage and frighten them by sending agents to tell lies about them to King Cyrus . This went on during his entire reign and lasted until King Darius took the throne .
TLB	Ezra	4	6	And afterwards , when King Ahasuerus began to reign , they wrote him a letter of accusation against the people of Judah and Jerusalem
TLB	Ezra	4	7	and did the same thing during the reign of Artaxerxes . Bishlam , Mithredath , and Tabeel and their associates wrote a letter to him in the Aramaic language , and it was translated to him . 8-9 Others who participated were Governor Rehum , Shimshai ( a scribe ) , several judges and other local leaders , the Persians , the Babylonians , the men of Erech and Susa ,
TLB	Ezra	4	10	and men from several other nations . ( They had been taken from their own lands by the great and noble Osnappar and relocated in Jerusalem , Samaria , and throughout the neighboring lands west of the Euphrates River . )
TLB	Ezra	4	11	Here is the text of the letter they sent to King Artaxerxes : “ Sir : Greetings from your loyal subjects west of the Euphrates River .
TLB	Ezra	4	12	Please be informed that the Jews sent to Jerusalem from Babylon are rebuilding this historically rebellious and evil city ; they have already rebuilt its walls and have repaired the foundations of the Temple .
TLB	Ezra	4	13	But we wish you to know that if this city is rebuilt , it will be much to your disadvantage , for the Jews will then refuse to pay their taxes to you .
TLB	Ezra	4	14	“ Since we are grateful to you as our patron , and we do not want to see you taken advantage of and dishonored in this way , we have decided to send you this information .
TLB	Ezra	4	15	We suggest that you search the ancient records to discover what a rebellious city this has been in the past ; in fact , it was destroyed because of its long history of sedition against the kings and countries who attempted to control it .
TLB	Ezra	4	16	We wish to declare that if this city is rebuilt and the walls finished , you might as well forget about this part of your empire beyond the Euphrates , for it will be lost to you. ”
TLB	Ezra	4	17	Then the king made this reply to Governor Rehum and Shimshai the scribe , and to their companions living in Samaria and throughout the area west of the Euphrates River :
TLB	Ezra	4	18	“ Gentlemen : Greetings ! The letter you sent has been translated and read to me .
TLB	Ezra	4	19	I have ordered a search made of the records and have indeed found that Jerusalem has in times past been a hotbed of insurrection against many kings ; in fact , rebellion and sedition are normal there !
TLB	Ezra	4	20	I find , moreover , that there have been some very great kings in Jerusalem who have ruled the entire land beyond the Euphrates River and have received vast tribute , custom , and toll .
TLB	Ezra	4	21	Therefore , I command that these men must stop their work until I have investigated the matter more thoroughly .
TLB	Ezra	4	22	Do not delay , for we must not permit the situation to get out of control ! ”
TLB	Ezra	4	23	When this letter from King Artaxerxes was read to Rehum and Shimshai , they hurried to Jerusalem and forced the Jews to stop building .
TLB	Ezra	4	24	So the work ended until the second year of the reign of King Darius of Persia . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Ezra	5	5	But because the Lord was overseeing the entire situation , our enemies did not force us to stop building , but let us continue while King Darius looked into the matter and returned his decision .
TLB	Ezra	5	3	But Tattenai , the governor of the lands west of the Euphrates , and Shethar-bozenai , and their companions soon arrived in Jerusalem and demanded , “ Who gave you permission to rebuild this Temple and finish these walls ? ”
TLB	Ezra	5	4	They also asked for a list of the names of all the men who were working on the Temple .
TLB	Ezra	5	6	Following is the letter which Governors Tattenai and Shethar-bozenai and the other officials sent to King Darius :
TLB	Ezra	5	7	“ To King Darius : “ Greetings !
TLB	Ezra	5	8	“ We wish to inform you that we went to the construction site of the Temple of the great God of Judah . It is being built with huge stones , and timber is being laid in the city walls . The work is going forward with great energy and success .
TLB	Ezra	5	9	We asked the leaders , ‘ Who has given you permission to do this ? ’
TLB	Ezra	5	10	And we demanded their names so that we could notify you .
TLB	Ezra	5	11	Their answer was , ‘ We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth and we are rebuilding the Temple that was constructed here many centuries ago by a great king of Israel .
TLB	Ezra	5	12	But afterwards our ancestors angered the God of heaven , and he abandoned them and let King Nebuchadnezzar destroy this Temple and exile the people to Babylonia. ’
TLB	Ezra	5	13	“ But they insist that King Cyrus of Babylon , during the first year of his reign , issued a decree that the Temple should be rebuilt ,
TLB	Ezra	5	14	and they say King Cyrus returned the gold and silver bowls which Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the Temple in Jerusalem and had placed in the temple of Babylon . They say these items were delivered into the safekeeping of a man named Sheshbazzar , whom King Cyrus appointed as governor of Judah .
TLB	Ezra	5	15	The king instructed him to return the bowls to Jerusalem and to let the Temple of God be built there as before .
TLB	Ezra	5	16	So Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundations of the Temple at Jerusalem ; and the people have been working on it ever since , though it is not yet completed .
TLB	Ezra	5	17	We request that you search in the royal library of Babylon to discover whether King Cyrus ever made such a decree ; and then let us know your pleasure in this matter. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Ezra	6	6	So King Darius II sent this message [ a ] to Governor Shethar-bozenai and the other officials west of the Euphrates : “ Do not disturb the construction of the Temple . Let it be rebuilt on its former site ,
TLB	Ezra	6	2	Eventually the record was found in the palace at Ecbatana , in the province of Media . This is what it said :
TLB	Ezra	6	3	“ In this first year of the reign of King Cyrus , a decree has been sent out concerning the Temple of God at Jerusalem where the Jews offer sacrifices . It is to be rebuilt , and the foundations are to be strongly laid . The height will be ninety feet and the width will be ninety feet .
TLB	Ezra	6	4	There will be three layers of huge stones in the foundation , topped with a layer of new timber . All expenses will be paid by the king .
TLB	Ezra	6	5	And the gold and silver bowls , which were taken from the Temple of God by Nebuchadnezzar , shall be taken back to Jerusalem and put into the Temple as they were before. ”
TLB	Ezra	6	7	and don ’ t molest the governor of Judah and the other leaders in their work .
TLB	Ezra	6	8	Moreover , I decree that you are to pay the full construction costs without delay from my taxes collected in your territory .
TLB	Ezra	6	9	Give the priests in Jerusalem young bulls , rams , and lambs for burnt offerings to the God of heaven ; and give them wheat , wine , salt , and olive oil each day without fail .
TLB	Ezra	6	10	Then they will be able to offer acceptable sacrifices to the God of heaven and pray for me and my sons .
TLB	Ezra	6	11	Anyone who attempts to change this message in any way shall have the beams pulled from his house and built into a gallows on which he will be hanged ; [ b ] and his house shall be reduced to a pile of rubble .
TLB	Ezra	6	12	The God who has chosen the city of Jerusalem will destroy any king and any nation that alters this commandment and destroys this Temple . I , Darius , have issued this decree ; let it be obeyed with all diligence. ”
TLB	Ezra	6	13	Governors Tattenai and Shethar-bozenai , and their companions complied at once with the command of King Darius .
TLB	Ezra	6	14	So the Jewish leaders continued in their work , and they were greatly encouraged by the preaching of the prophets Haggai and Zechariah ( son of Iddo ) . The Temple was finally finished , as had been commanded by God and decreed by Cyrus , Darius , and Artaxerxes , the kings of Persia .
TLB	Ezra	6	15	The completion date was February
TLB	Ezra	6	18	Then the priests and Levites were divided into their various service corps to do the work of God as instructed in the laws of Moses .
TLB	Ezra	6	16	The Temple was then dedicated with great joy by the priests , the Levites , and all the people .
TLB	Ezra	6	17	During the dedication celebration
TLB	Ezra	6	100	young bulls ,
TLB	Ezra	6	200	rams , and
TLB	Ezra	6	400	lambs were sacrificed ; and twelve male goats were presented as a sin offering for the twelve tribes of Israel .
TLB	Ezra	6	19	The Passover was celebrated on the first day of April . [ d ]
TLB	Ezra	6	20	For by that time many of the priests and Levites had consecrated themselves . 21-22 And some of the heathen people who had been relocated in Judah turned from their immoral customs and joined the Israelis in worshiping the Lord God . They , with the entire nation , ate the Passover feast and celebrated the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days . There was great joy throughout the land because the Lord had caused the king of Assyria to be generous to Israel and to assist in the construction of the Temple . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Ezra	7	7	1-5 Here is the genealogy of Ezra , who traveled from Babylon to Jerusalem [ a ] during the reign of King Artaxerxes of Persia : Ezra was the son of Seriah ; Seriah was the son of Azariah ; Azariah was the son of Hilkiah ; Hilkiah was the son of Shallum ; Shallum was the son of Zadok ; Zadok was the son of Ahitub ; Ahitub was the son of Amariah ; Amariah was the son of Meraioth ; Meraioth was the son of Zerahiah ; Zerahiah was the son of Uzzi ; Uzzi was the son of Bukki ; Bukki was the son of Abishua ; Abishua was the son of Phinehas ; Phinehas was the son of Eleazar ; Eleazar was the son of Aaron , the chief priest .
TLB	Ezra	7	6	As a Jewish religious leader , Ezra was well versed in Jehovah ’ s laws , which Moses had given to the people of Israel . He asked to be allowed to return to Jerusalem , and the king granted his request ; for the Lord his God was blessing him . 7-9 Many ordinary people as well as priests , Levites , singers , gatekeepers , and Temple workers traveled with him . They left Babylon in the middle of March in the seventh year of the reign of Artaxerxes and arrived at Jerusalem in the month of August ; for the Lord gave them a good trip .
TLB	Ezra	7	10	This was because Ezra had determined to study and obey the laws of the Lord and to become a Bible teacher , teaching those laws to the people of Israel .
TLB	Ezra	7	11	King Artaxerxes presented this letter to Ezra the priest , the student of God ’ s commands :
TLB	Ezra	7	12	“ From : Artaxerxes , the king of kings . “ To : Ezra the priest , the teacher of the laws of the God of heaven .
TLB	Ezra	7	13	“ I decree that any Jew in my realm , including the priests and Levites , may return to Jerusalem with you .
TLB	Ezra	7	14	I and my Council of Seven hereby instruct you to take a copy of God ’ s laws to Judah and Jerusalem and to send back a report of the religious progress being made there .
TLB	Ezra	7	15	We also commission you to take with you to Jerusalem the silver and gold , which we are presenting as an offering to the God of Israel .
TLB	Ezra	7	16	“ Moreover , you are to collect voluntary Temple offerings of silver and gold from the Jews and their priests in all of the provinces of Babylon .
TLB	Ezra	7	17	These funds are to be used primarily for the purchase of oxen , rams , lambs , grain offerings , and drink offerings , all of which will be offered upon the altar of your Temple when you arrive in Jerusalem .
TLB	Ezra	7	18	The money that is left over may be used in whatever way you and your brothers feel is the will of your God .
TLB	Ezra	7	19	And take with you the gold bowls and other items we are giving you for the Temple of your God at Jerusalem .
TLB	Ezra	7	20	If you run short of money for the construction of the Temple or for any similar needs , you may requisition funds from the royal treasury .
TLB	Ezra	7	21	“ I , Artaxerxes the king , send this decree to all the treasurers in the provinces west of the Euphrates River : ‘ You are to give Ezra whatever he requests of you ( for he is a priest and teacher of the laws of the God of heaven ) ,
TLB	Ezra	7	22	up to $ 200,000 in silver ; 1,225 bushels of wheat ;
TLB	Ezra	7	990	gallons of wine ; any amount of salt ;
TLB	Ezra	7	23	and whatever else the God of heaven demands for his Temple ; for why should we risk God ’ s wrath against the king and his sons ?
TLB	Ezra	7	24	I also decree that no priest , Levite , choir member , gatekeeper , Temple attendant , or other worker in the Temple shall be required to pay taxes of any kind. ’
TLB	Ezra	7	25	“ And you , Ezra , are to use the wisdom God has given you to select and appoint judges and other officials to govern all the people west of the Euphrates River ; if they are not familiar with the laws of your God , you are to teach them .
TLB	Ezra	7	26	Anyone refusing to obey the law of your God and the law of the king shall be punished immediately by death , banishment , confiscation of goods , or imprisonment. ”
TLB	Ezra	7	27	Well , praise the Lord God of our ancestors , who made the king want to beautify the Temple of the Lord in Jerusalem !
TLB	Ezra	7	28	And praise God for demonstrating such loving-kindness to me [ b ] by honoring me before the king and his Council of Seven and before all of his mighty princes ! I was given great status because the Lord my God was with me ; and I persuaded some of the leaders of Israel to return with me to Jerusalem . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Ezra	8	8	These are the names and genealogies of the leaders who accompanied me from Babylon during the reign of King Artaxerxes : 2-14 From the clan of Phinehas—Gershom ; From the clan of Ithamar—Daniel ; From the subclan of David of the clan of Shecaniah—Hattush ; From the clan of Parosh—Zechariah , and
TLB	Ezra	8	150	other men ; From the clan of Pahath-moab—Eliehoenai ( son of Zerahiah ) , and
TLB	Ezra	8	200	other men ; From the clan of Shecaniah—the son of Jahaziel , and
TLB	Ezra	8	300	other men ; From the clan of Adin—Ebed ( son of Jonathan ) , and
TLB	Ezra	8	50	other men ; From the clan of Elam—Jeshaiah ( son of Athaliah ) , and
TLB	Ezra	8	70	other men .
TLB	Ezra	8	80	other men ; From the clan of Joab—Obadiah ( son of Jehiel ) , and
TLB	Ezra	8	218	other men ; From the clan of Bani—Shelomith ( son of Josiphiah ) , and
TLB	Ezra	8	160	other men ; From the clan of Bebai—Zechariah ( son of Bebai ) , and
TLB	Ezra	8	28	I consecrated these men to the Lord and then consecrated the treasures—the equipment and money and bowls that had been given as freewill offerings to the Lord God of our fathers .
TLB	Ezra	8	110	other men ; From the clan of Adonikam—Eliphelet , Jeuel , Shemaiah , and
TLB	Ezra	8	60	other men ( they arrived at a later time ) ; From the clan of Bigvai—Uthai , Zaccur , and
TLB	Ezra	8	15	We assembled at the Ahava River and camped there for three days while I went over the lists of the people and the priests who had arrived ; and I found that not one Levite had volunteered !
TLB	Ezra	8	16	So I sent for Eliezer , Ariel , Shemaiah , Elnathan , Jarib , Elnathan , Nathan , Zechariah , and Meshullam , the Levite leaders ; I also sent for Joiarib and Elnathan , who were very wise men .
TLB	Ezra	8	17	I sent them to Iddo , the leader of the Jews at Casiphia , to ask him and his brothers and the Temple attendants to send us priests for the Temple of God at Jerusalem .
TLB	Ezra	8	18	And God was good ! He sent us an outstanding man named Sherebiah , along with eighteen of his sons and brothers ; he was a very astute man and a descendant of Mahli , the son of Levi and grandson of Israel .
TLB	Ezra	8	19	God also sent Hashabiah ; and Jeshaiah ( the son of Merari ) , with twenty of his sons and brothers ;
TLB	Ezra	8	20	and
TLB	Ezra	8	220	men were all listed by name .
TLB	Ezra	8	21	Then I declared a fast while we were at the Ahava River so that we would humble ourselves before our God ; and we prayed that he would give us a good journey and protect us , our children , and our goods as we traveled .
TLB	Ezra	8	22	For I was ashamed to ask the king for soldiers and cavalry to accompany us and protect us from the enemies along the way . After all , we had told the king that our God would protect all those who worshiped him , and that disaster could come only to those who had forsaken him !
TLB	Ezra	8	23	So we fasted and begged God to take care of us . And he did .
TLB	Ezra	8	24	I appointed twelve leaders of the priests—Sherebiah , Hashabiah , and ten other priests—
TLB	Ezra	8	25	to be in charge of transporting the silver , gold , the gold bowls , and the other items that the king and his council and the leaders and people of Israel had presented to the Temple of God . 26-27 I weighed the money as I gave it to them and found it to total $ 1,300,000 in silver ; $ 200,000 in silver utensils ; many millions in gold ; and twenty gold bowls worth a total of $ 100,000 . There were also two beautiful pieces of brass that were as precious as gold .
TLB	Ezra	8	29	“ Guard these treasures well ! ” I told them ; “ present them without a penny lost to the priests and the Levite leaders and the elders of Israel at Jerusalem , where they are to be placed in the treasury of the Temple. ”
TLB	Ezra	8	30	So the priests and the Levites accepted the responsibility of taking them to God ’ s Temple in Jerusalem .
TLB	Ezra	8	31	We broke camp at the Ahava River at the end of March [ a ] and started off to Jerusalem ; and God protected us and saved us from enemies and bandits along the way .
TLB	Ezra	8	32	So at last we arrived safely at Jerusalem .
TLB	Ezra	8	33	On the fourth day after our arrival , the silver , gold , and other valuables were weighed in the Temple by Meremoth ( the son of Uriah the priest ) , Eleazar ( son of Phinehas ) , Jozabad ( son of Jeshua ) , and Noadiah ( son of Binnui ) —all of whom were Levites .
TLB	Ezra	8	34	A receipt was given for each item , and the weight of the gold and silver was noted .
TLB	Ezra	8	35	Then everyone in our party sacrificed burnt offerings to the God of Israel—twelve oxen for the nation of Israel ; ninety-six rams ; seventy-seven lambs ; and twelve goats as a sin offering .
TLB	Ezra	8	36	The king ’ s decrees were delivered to his lieutenants and the governors of all the provinces west of the Euphrates River , and of course they then cooperated in the rebuilding of the Temple of God .

TLB	Ezra	9	9	For we were slaves , but in your love and mercy you did not abandon us to slavery ; instead , you caused the kings of Persia to be favorable to us . They have even given us their assistance in rebuilding the Temple of our God and in giving us Jerusalem as a walled city in Judah .
TLB	Ezra	9	2	The men of Israel had married girls from these heathen nations and had taken them as wives for their sons . So the holy people of God were being polluted by these mixed marriages , and the political leaders were some of the worst offenders .
TLB	Ezra	9	3	When I heard this , I tore my clothing and pulled hair from my head and beard and sat down utterly baffled .
TLB	Ezra	9	4	Then many who feared the God of Israel because of this sin of his people came and sat with me until the time of the evening burnt offering .
TLB	Ezra	9	5	Finally I stood before the Lord in great embarrassment ; then I fell to my knees and lifted my hands to the Lord ,
TLB	Ezra	9	6	and cried out , “ O my God , I am ashamed ; I blush to lift up my face to you , for our sins are piled higher than our heads and our guilt is as boundless as the heavens .
TLB	Ezra	9	7	Our whole history has been one of sin ; that is why we and our kings and our priests were slain by the heathen kings—we were captured , robbed , and disgraced , just as we are today .
TLB	Ezra	9	8	But now we have been given a moment of peace , for you have permitted a few of us to return to Jerusalem from our exile . You have given us a moment of joy and new life in our slavery .
TLB	Ezra	9	10	“ And now , O God , what can we say after all of this ? For once again we have abandoned you and broken your laws !
TLB	Ezra	9	11	The prophets warned us that the land we would possess was totally defiled by the horrible practices of the people living there . From one end to the other it is filled with corruption .
TLB	Ezra	9	12	You told us not to let our daughters marry their sons , and not to let our sons marry their daughters , and not to help those nations in any way . You warned us that only if we followed this rule could we become a prosperous nation and forever leave that prosperity to our children as an inheritance .
TLB	Ezra	9	13	And now , even after our punishment in exile because of our wickedness ( and we have been punished far less than we deserved ) , and even though you have let some of us return ,
TLB	Ezra	9	14	we have broken your commandments again and intermarried with people who do these awful things . Surely your anger will destroy us now until not even this little remnant escapes .

TLB	Ezra	10	10	Then I , Ezra the priest , arose and addressed them : “ You have sinned , for you have married heathen women ; now we are even more deeply under God ’ s condemnation than we were before .
TLB	Ezra	10	2	Then Shecaniah ( the son of Jehiel of the clan of Elam ) said to me , “ We acknowledge our sin against our God , for we have married these heathen women . But there is hope for Israel in spite of this .
TLB	Ezra	10	3	For we agree before our God to divorce our heathen wives and to send them away with our children ; we will follow your commands and the commands of the others who fear our God . We will obey the laws of God .
TLB	Ezra	10	4	Take courage and tell us how to proceed in setting things straight , and we will fully cooperate. ”
TLB	Ezra	10	5	So I stood up and demanded that the leaders of the priests and the Levites and all the people of Israel swear that they would do as Shecaniah had said ; and they all agreed .
TLB	Ezra	10	6	Then I went into the room of Jehohanan in the Temple and refused all food and drink , for I was mourning because of the sin of the returned exiles . 7-8 Then a proclamation was made throughout Judah and Jerusalem that everyone should appear at Jerusalem within three days and that the leaders and elders had decided that anyone who refused to come would be disinherited and excommunicated from Israel .
TLB	Ezra	10	9	Within three days , on the fifth day of December , [ a ] all the men of Judah and Benjamin had arrived and were sitting in the open space before the Temple ; and they were trembling because of the seriousness of the matter and because of the heavy rainfall .
TLB	Ezra	10	11	Confess your sin to the Lord God of your fathers and do what he demands : separate yourselves from the heathen people about you and from these women. ”
TLB	Ezra	10	12	Then all the men spoke up and said , “ We will do what you have said .
TLB	Ezra	10	13	But this isn ’ t something that can be done in a day or two , for there are many of us involved in this sinful affair . And it is raining so hard that we can ’ t stay out here much longer .
TLB	Ezra	10	14	Let our leaders arrange trials for us . Everyone who has a heathen wife will come at the scheduled time with the elders and judges of his city ; then each case will be decided and the situation will be cleared up , and the fierce wrath of our God will be turned away from us. ”

TLB	Nehemiah	1	1	The autobiography of Nehemiah , the son of Hecaliah : In December of the twentieth year of the reign of King Artaxerxes of Persia , [ a ] when I was at the palace at Shushan ,
TLB	Nehemiah	1	2	one of my fellow Jews named Hanani came to visit me with some men who had arrived from Judah . I took the opportunity to inquire about how things were going in Jerusalem . “ How are they getting along— , ” I asked , “ the Jews who returned to Jerusalem from their exile here ? ”
TLB	Nehemiah	1	3	“ Well , ” they replied , “ things are not good ; the wall of Jerusalem is still torn down , and the gates are burned. ”
TLB	Nehemiah	1	4	When I heard this , I sat down and cried . In fact , I refused to eat for several days , for I spent the time in prayer to the God of heaven .
TLB	Nehemiah	1	5	“ O Lord God , ” I cried out ; “ O great and awesome God who keeps his promises and is so loving and kind to those who love and obey him ! Hear my prayer ! 6-7 Listen carefully to what I say ! Look down and see me praying night and day for your people Israel . I confess that we have sinned against you ; yes , I and my people have committed the horrible sin of not obeying the commandments you gave us through your servant Moses .
TLB	Nehemiah	1	8	Oh , please remember what you told Moses ! You said , “ ‘ If you sin , I will scatter you among the nations ;
TLB	Nehemiah	1	9	but if you return to me and obey my laws , even though you are exiled to the farthest corners of the universe , I will bring you back to Jerusalem . For Jerusalem is the place in which I have chosen to live. ’
TLB	Nehemiah	1	10	“ We are your servants , the people you rescued by your great power .
TLB	Nehemiah	1	11	O Lord , please hear my prayer ! Heed the prayers of those of us who delight to honor you . Please help me now as I go in and ask the king for a great favor—put it into his heart to be kind to me. ” ( I was the king ’ s cupbearer . ) Footnotes - Nehemiah 1:1 King Artaxerxes of Persia , implied .

TLB	Nehemiah	2	2	1-2 One day in April , four months later , as I was serving the king his wine he asked me , “ Why so sad ? You aren ’ t sick , are you ? You look like a man with deep troubles. ” ( For until then I had always been cheerful when I was with him . ) I was badly frightened ,
TLB	Nehemiah	2	3	but I replied , “ Sir , [ a ] why shouldn ’ t I be sad ? For the city where my ancestors are buried is in ruins , and the gates have been burned down. ”
TLB	Nehemiah	2	4	“ Well , what should be done ? ” the king asked . With a quick prayer to the God of heaven , I replied , “ If it please Your Majesty and if you look upon me with your royal favor , send me to Judah to rebuild the city of my fathers ! ” 5-6 The king replied , with the queen sitting beside him , “ How long will you be gone ? When will you return ? ” So it was agreed ! And I set a time for my departure !
TLB	Nehemiah	2	7	Then I added this to my request : “ If it please the king , give me letters to the governors west of the Euphrates River instructing them to let me travel through their countries on my way to Judah ;
TLB	Nehemiah	2	8	also a letter to Asaph , the manager of the king ’ s forest , instructing him to give me timber for the beams and for the gates of the fortress near the Temple , and for the city walls , and for a house for myself. ” And the king granted these requests , for God was being gracious to me .
TLB	Nehemiah	2	9	When I arrived in the provinces west of the Euphrates River , I delivered the king ’ s letters to the governors there . ( The king , I should add , had sent along army officers and troops to protect me ! )
TLB	Nehemiah	2	10	But when Sanballat ( the Horonite ) and Tobiah ( an Ammonite who was a government official ) heard of my arrival , they were very angry that anyone was interested in helping Israel . 11-12 Three days after my arrival at Jerusalem I stole out during the night , taking only a few men with me ; for I hadn ’ t told a soul about the plans for Jerusalem that God had put into my heart . I was mounted on my donkey and the others were on foot ,
TLB	Nehemiah	2	13	and we went out through the Valley Gate toward the Jackal ’ s Well and over to the Dung Gate to see the broken walls and burned gates . 14-15 Then we went to the Fountain Gate and to the King ’ s Pool , but my donkey couldn ’ t get through the rubble . So we circled the city , and I followed the brook , inspecting the wall , and entered again at the Valley Gate .
TLB	Nehemiah	2	16	The city officials did not know I had been out there or why , for as yet I had said nothing to anyone about my plans—not to the political or religious leaders , or even to those who would be doing the work .
TLB	Nehemiah	2	17	But now I told them , “ You know full well the tragedy of our city ; it lies in ruins and its gates are burned . Let us rebuild the wall of Jerusalem and rid ourselves of this disgrace ! ”
TLB	Nehemiah	2	18	Then I told them about the desire God had put into my heart , and of my conversation with the king , and the plan to which he had agreed . They replied at once , “ Good ! Let ’ s rebuild the wall ! ” And so the work began .
TLB	Nehemiah	2	19	But when Sanballat , Tobiah , and Geshem the Arab heard of our plan , they scoffed and said , “ What are you doing , rebelling against the king like this ? ”
TLB	Nehemiah	2	20	But I replied , “ The God of heaven will help us , and we , his servants , will rebuild this wall ; but you may have no part in this affair. ” Footnotes - Nehemiah 2:3 Sir , literally , “ Let the king live forever. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Nehemiah	3	20	Next to him was Baruch ( son of Zabbai ) , who built from the turn in the wall to the home of Eliashib the High Priest .
TLB	Nehemiah	3	21	Meremoth ( son of Uriah , son of Hakkoz ) built a section of the wall extending from a point opposite the door of Eliashib ’ s house to the side of the house .

TLB	Nehemiah	3	23	Benjamin , Hasshub , and Azariah ( son of Maaseiah , son of Ananiah ) repaired the sections next to their own houses .

TLB	Nehemiah	4	4	Then I prayed , “ Hear us , O Lord God , for we are being mocked . May their scoffing fall back upon their own heads , and may they themselves become captives in a foreign land !
TLB	Nehemiah	4	3	Tobiah , who was standing beside him , remarked , “ If even a fox walked along the top of their wall , it would collapse ! ”
TLB	Nehemiah	4	5	Do not ignore their sin . Do not blot it out , for they have despised you in despising us who are building your wall. ”
TLB	Nehemiah	4	6	At last the wall was completed to half its original height around the entire city—for the workers worked hard .
TLB	Nehemiah	4	7	But when Sanballat and Tobiah and the Arabians , Ammonites , and Ashdodites heard that the work was going right ahead and that the breaks in the wall were being repaired , they became furious .
TLB	Nehemiah	4	8	They plotted to lead an army against Jerusalem to bring about riots and confusion .
TLB	Nehemiah	4	9	But we prayed to our God and guarded the city day and night to protect ourselves .
TLB	Nehemiah	4	10	Then some of the leaders began complaining that the workmen were becoming tired ; and there was so much rubble to be removed that we could never get it done by ourselves .
TLB	Nehemiah	4	11	Meanwhile , our enemies were planning to swoop down upon us and kill us , thus ending our work .
TLB	Nehemiah	4	12	And whenever the workers who lived in the nearby cities went home for a visit , our enemies tried to talk them out of returning to Jerusalem .
TLB	Nehemiah	4	13	So I placed armed guards from each family in the cleared spaces behind the walls .
TLB	Nehemiah	4	14	Then as I looked over the situation , I called together the leaders and the people and said to them , “ Don ’ t be afraid ! Remember the Lord who is great and glorious ; fight for your friends , your families , and your homes ! ”
TLB	Nehemiah	4	15	Our enemies learned that we knew of their plot , and that God had exposed and frustrated their plan . Now we all returned to our work on the wall ;
TLB	Nehemiah	4	16	but from then on , only half worked while the other half stood guard behind them .
TLB	Nehemiah	4	17	And the masons and laborers worked with weapons within easy reach beside them
TLB	Nehemiah	4	18	or with swords belted to their sides . The trumpeter stayed with me to sound the alarm .
TLB	Nehemiah	4	19	“ The work is so spread out , ” I explained to them , “ and we are separated so widely from each other , that when you hear the trumpet blow , you must rush to where I am ; and God will fight for us. ” 20-21 We worked early and late , from sunrise to sunset ; and half the men were always on guard .
TLB	Nehemiah	4	22	I told everyone living outside the walls to move into Jerusalem so that their servants could go on guard duty as well as work during the day .
TLB	Nehemiah	4	23	During this period none of us—I , nor my brothers , nor the servants , nor the guards who were with me—ever took off our clothes except for washing . [ a ] And we carried our weapons with us at all times . Footnotes - Nehemiah 4:23 except for washing , or “ even when we went for water , ” or “ not even at night. ” The meaning of the Hebrew text is uncertain . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Nehemiah	5	5	“ We are their brothers , and our children are just like theirs , ” the people protested . “ Yet we must sell our children into slavery to get enough money to live . We have already sold some of our daughters , and we are helpless to redeem them , for our fields , too , are mortgaged to these men. ”
TLB	Nehemiah	5	6	I was very angry when I heard this ;
TLB	Nehemiah	5	7	so after thinking about it I spoke out against these rich government officials . “ What is this you are doing ? ” I demanded . “ How dare you demand a mortgage as a condition for helping another Israelite ! ” Then I called a public trial to deal with them .
TLB	Nehemiah	5	8	At the trial I shouted at them , “ The rest of us are doing all we can to help our Jewish brothers who have returned from exile as slaves in distant lands , but you are forcing them right back into slavery again . How often must we redeem them ? ” And they had nothing to say in their own defense .
TLB	Nehemiah	5	9	Then I pressed further . “ What you are doing is very evil , ” I exclaimed . “ Should you not walk in the fear of our God ? Don ’ t we have enough enemies among the nations around us who are trying to destroy us ?
TLB	Nehemiah	5	10	The rest of us are lending money and grain to our fellow Jews without any interest . I beg you , gentlemen , stop this business of usury .
TLB	Nehemiah	5	11	Restore their fields , vineyards , olive yards , and homes to them this very day and drop your claims against them. ”
TLB	Nehemiah	5	12	So they agreed to do it and said that they would assist their brothers without requiring them to mortgage their lands and sell them their children . Then I summoned the priests and made these men formally vow to carry out their promises .
TLB	Nehemiah	5	13	And I invoked the curse of God upon any of them who refused . [ a ] “ May God destroy your homes and livelihood if you fail to keep this promise , ” I declared . And all the people shouted , “ Amen , ” and praised the Lord . And the rich men did as they had promised .
TLB	Nehemiah	5	14	I would like to mention that for the entire twelve years that I was governor of Judah—from the twentieth until the thirty-second year of the reign of King Artaxerxes—my aides and I accepted no salaries or other assistance from the people of Israel .
TLB	Nehemiah	5	15	This was quite a contrast to the former governors who had demanded food and wine and $
TLB	Nehemiah	5	100	a day in cash , and had put the population at the mercy of their aides who tyrannized them ; but I obeyed God and did not act that way .
TLB	Nehemiah	5	16	I stayed at work on the wall and refused to speculate in land ; I also required my officials to spend time on the wall .
TLB	Nehemiah	5	17	All this despite the fact that I regularly fed
TLB	Nehemiah	5	150	Jewish officials at my table , besides visitors from other countries !
TLB	Nehemiah	5	18	The provisions required for each day were one ox , six fat sheep , and a large number of domestic fowls ; and we needed a huge supply of all kinds of wines every ten days . Yet I refused to make a special levy against the people , for they were already having a difficult time .
TLB	Nehemiah	5	19	O my God , please keep in mind all that I ’ ve done for these people and bless me for it . Footnotes - Nehemiah 5:13 I invoked the curse of God upon any of them who refused , literally , “ Then I shook out the lap of my gown. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Nehemiah	6	6	When Sanballat , Tobiah , Geshem the Arab , and the rest of our enemies found out that we had almost completed the rebuilding of the wall—though we had not yet hung all the doors of the gates—
TLB	Nehemiah	6	2	they sent me a message asking me to meet them in one of the villages in the plain of Ono . But I realized they were plotting to kill me ,
TLB	Nehemiah	6	3	so I replied by sending back this message to them : “ I am doing a great work ! Why should I stop to come and visit with you ? ”
TLB	Nehemiah	6	4	Four times they sent the same message , and each time I gave the same reply . 5-6 The fifth time , Sanballat ’ s servant came with an open letter in his hand , and this is what it said : “ Geshem tells me that everywhere he goes he hears that the Jews are planning to rebel , and that is why you are building the wall . He claims you plan to be their king—that is what is being said .
TLB	Nehemiah	6	7	He also reports that you have appointed prophets to campaign for you at Jerusalem by saying , ‘ Look ! Nehemiah is just the man we need ! ’ “ You can be very sure that I am going to pass along these interesting comments to King Artaxerxes ! I suggest that you come and talk it over with me—for that is the only way you can save yourself ! ”
TLB	Nehemiah	6	8	My reply was , “ You know you are lying . There isn ’ t one bit of truth to the whole story .
TLB	Nehemiah	6	9	You ’ re just trying to scare us into stopping our work. ” ( O Lord God , please strengthen me ! )
TLB	Nehemiah	6	10	A few days later I went to visit Shemaiah ( son of Delaiah , who was the son of Mehetabel ) , for he said he was receiving a message from God . “ Let us hide in the Temple and bolt the door , ” he exclaimed , “ for they are coming tonight to kill you. ”
TLB	Nehemiah	6	11	But I replied , “ Should I , the governor , run away from danger ? And if I go into the Temple , not being a priest , I would forfeit my life . No , I won ’ t do it ! ” 12-13 Then I realized that God had not spoken to him , but Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him to scare me and make me sin by fleeing to the Temple ; and then they would be able to accuse me .
TLB	Nehemiah	6	14	“ O my God , ” I prayed , “ don ’ t forget all the evil of Tobiah , Sanballat , Noadiah the prophetess , and all the other prophets who have tried to discourage me. ”
TLB	Nehemiah	6	15	The wall was finally finished in early September [ a ] —just fifty-two days after we had begun !
TLB	Nehemiah	6	16	When our enemies and the surrounding nations heard about it , they were frightened and humiliated , and they realized that the work had been done with the help of our God .
TLB	Nehemiah	6	17	During those fifty-two days many letters went back and forth between Tobiah and the wealthy politicians of Judah .
TLB	Nehemiah	6	18	For many in Judah had sworn allegiance to him because his father-in-law was Shecaniah ( son of Arah ) and because his son Jehohanan was married to the daughter of Meshullam ( son of Berechiah ) .
TLB	Nehemiah	6	19	They all told me what a wonderful man Tobiah was , and then they told him everything I had said ; and Tobiah sent many threatening letters to frighten me . Footnotes - Nehemiah 6:15 early September , or “ the twenty-fifth day of the month Elul. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Nehemiah	7	7	“ Their leaders were : Zerubbabel , Jeshua , Nehemiah , Azariah , Raamiah , Nahamani , Mordecai , Bilshan , Mispereth , Bigvai , Nehum , Baanah . “ The others who returned at that time were : 8-38 From the subclan of Parosh , 2,172 ; From the subclan of Shephatiah ,
TLB	Nehemiah	7	2	I gave the responsibility of governing Jerusalem to my brother Hanani and to Hananiah , the commander of the fortress—a very faithful man who revered God more than most people do .
TLB	Nehemiah	7	3	I issued instructions to them not to open the Jerusalem gates until well after sunrise , and to close and lock them while the guards were still on duty . I also directed that the guards be residents of Jerusalem , and that they must be on duty at regular times , and that each homeowner who lived near the wall must guard the section of wall next to his own home .
TLB	Nehemiah	7	4	For the city was large , but the population was small ; and only a few houses were scattered throughout the city .
TLB	Nehemiah	7	5	Then the Lord told me to call together all the leaders of the city , along with the ordinary citizens , for registration . For I had found the record of the genealogies of those who had returned to Judah before , and this is what was written in it :
TLB	Nehemiah	7	6	“ The following is a list of the names of the Jews who returned to Judah after being exiled by King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon .
TLB	Nehemiah	7	372	; From the subclan of Arah ,

TLB	Nehemiah	8	8	1-5 Now , in mid-September , all the people assembled at the plaza in front of the Water Gate and requested Ezra , their religious leader , to read to them the law of God , which he had given to Moses . So Ezra the priest brought out to them the scroll of Moses ’ laws . He stood on a wooden stand made especially for the occasion so that everyone could see him as he read . He faced the square in front of the Water Gate and read from early morning until noon . Everyone stood up as he opened the scroll . And all who were old enough to understand paid close attention . To his right stood Mattithiah , Shema , Anaiah , Uriah , Hilkiah , and Maaseiah . To his left were Pedaiah , Mishael , Malchijah , Hashum , Hash-baddenah , Zechariah , and Meshullam .
TLB	Nehemiah	8	6	Then Ezra blessed the Lord , the great God , and all the people said , “ Amen , ” and lifted their hands toward heaven ; then they bowed and worshiped the Lord with their faces toward the ground . 7-8 As Ezra read from the scroll , Jeshua , Bani , Sherebiah , Jamin , Akkub , Shabbethai , Hodiah , Maaseiah , Kelita , Azariah , Jozabad , Hanan , Pelaiah , and the Levites went among the people [ a ] and explained the meaning of the passage that was being read .
TLB	Nehemiah	8	9	All the people began sobbing when they heard the commands of the law . Then Ezra the priest , and I as governor , and the Levites who were assisting me said to them , “ Don ’ t cry on such a day as this ! For today is a sacred day before the Lord your God—
TLB	Nehemiah	8	10	it is a time to celebrate with a hearty meal and to send presents to those in need , for the joy of the Lord is your strength . You must not be dejected and sad ! ”
TLB	Nehemiah	8	11	And the Levites , too , quieted the people , telling them , “ That ’ s right ! Don ’ t weep ! For this is a day of holy joy , not of sadness. ”
TLB	Nehemiah	8	12	So the people went away to eat a festive meal and to send presents ; it was a time of great and joyful celebration because they could hear and understand God ’ s words .
TLB	Nehemiah	8	13	The next day the clan leaders and the priests and Levites met with Ezra to go over the law in greater detail .
TLB	Nehemiah	8	14	As they studied it , they noted that Jehovah had told Moses that the people of Israel should live in tents during the Festival of Tabernacles to be held that month .
TLB	Nehemiah	8	15	He had said also that a proclamation should be made throughout the cities of the land , especially in Jerusalem , telling the people to go to the hills to get branches from olive , myrtle , palm , and fig trees and to make huts in which to live for the duration of the feast .
TLB	Nehemiah	8	16	So the people went out and cut branches and used them to build huts on the roofs of their houses , or in their courtyards , or in the court of the Temple , or on the plaza beside the Water Gate , or at the Ephraim Gate Plaza .
TLB	Nehemiah	8	17	They lived in these huts for the seven days of the feast , and everyone was filled with joy ! ( This procedure had not been carried out since the days of Joshua . )
TLB	Nehemiah	8	18	Ezra read from the scroll on each of the seven days of the feast , and on the eighth day there was a solemn closing service as required by the laws of Moses .

TLB	Nehemiah	9	3	The laws of God were read aloud to them for two or three hours , and for several more hours they took turns confessing their own sins and those of their ancestors . And everyone worshiped the Lord their God .
TLB	Nehemiah	9	4	Some of the Levites were on the platform praising the Lord God with songs of joy . These men were Jeshua , Kadmiel , Bani , Shebaniah , Bunni , Sherebiah , Bani , and Chenani .
TLB	Nehemiah	9	5	Then the Levite leaders called out to the people , “ Stand up and praise the Lord your God , for he lives from everlasting to everlasting . Praise his glorious name ! It is far greater than we can think or say. ” The leaders in this part of the service were Jeshua , Kadmiel , Bani , Hashabneiah , Sherebiah , Hodiah , Shebaniah , and Pethahiah .
TLB	Nehemiah	9	6	Then Ezra prayed , “ You alone are God . You have made the skies and the heavens , the earth and the seas , and everything in them . You preserve it all ; and all the angels of heaven worship you .
TLB	Nehemiah	9	7	“ You are the Lord God who chose Abram and brought him from Ur of the Chaldeans and renamed him Abraham .
TLB	Nehemiah	9	8	When he was faithful to you , you made a contract with him to forever give him and his descendants the land of the Canaanites , Hittites , Amorites , Perizzites , Jebusites , and Girgashites ; and now you have done what you promised , for you are always true to your word .
TLB	Nehemiah	9	11	You divided the sea for your people so they could go through on dry land ! And then you destroyed their enemies in the depths of the sea ; they sank like stones beneath the mighty waters .
TLB	Nehemiah	9	12	You led our ancestors by a pillar of cloud during the day and a pillar of fire at night so that they could find their way .
TLB	Nehemiah	9	13	“ You came down upon Mount Sinai and spoke with them from heaven and gave them good laws and true commandments ,
TLB	Nehemiah	9	14	including the laws about the holy Sabbath ; and you commanded them , through Moses your servant , to obey them all .
TLB	Nehemiah	9	15	“ You gave them bread from heaven when they were hungry and water from the rock when they were thirsty . You commanded them to go in and conquer the land you had sworn to give them ;
TLB	Nehemiah	9	16	but our ancestors were a proud and stubborn lot , and they refused to listen to your commandments .
TLB	Nehemiah	9	17	“ They refused to obey and didn ’ t pay any attention to the miracles you did for them ; instead , they rebelled and appointed a leader to take them back into slavery in Egypt ! But you are a God of forgiveness , always ready to pardon , gracious and merciful , slow to become angry , and full of love and mercy ; you didn ’ t abandon them ,
TLB	Nehemiah	9	18	even though they made a calf idol and proclaimed , ‘ This is our God ! He brought us out of Egypt ! ’ They sinned in so many ways ,
TLB	Nehemiah	9	19	but in your great mercy you didn ’ t abandon them to die in the wilderness ! The pillar of cloud led them forward day by day , and the pillar of fire showed them the way through the night .
TLB	Nehemiah	9	20	You sent your good Spirit to instruct them , and you did not stop giving them bread from heaven or water for their thirst .
TLB	Nehemiah	9	21	For forty years you sustained them in the wilderness ; they lacked nothing in all that time . Their clothes didn ’ t wear out , and their feet didn ’ t swell !
TLB	Nehemiah	9	22	“ Then you helped them conquer great kingdoms and many nations , and you placed your people in every corner of the land ; they completely took over the land of King Sihon of Heshbon and King Og of Bashan .
TLB	Nehemiah	9	23	You caused a population explosion among the Israelis and brought them into the land you had promised to their ancestors .
TLB	Nehemiah	9	24	You subdued whole nations before them—even the kings and the people of the Canaanites were powerless !
TLB	Nehemiah	9	25	Your people captured fortified cities and fertile land ; they took over houses full of good things , with cisterns and vineyards and olive yards and many , many fruit trees ; so they ate and were full and enjoyed themselves in all your blessings .
TLB	Nehemiah	9	26	“ But despite all this , they were disobedient and rebelled against you . They threw away your law , killed the prophets who told them to return to you , and they did many other terrible things .
TLB	Nehemiah	9	27	So you gave them to their enemies . But in their time of trouble they cried to you , and you heard them from heaven , and in great mercy you sent them saviors who delivered them from their enemies .
TLB	Nehemiah	9	28	But when all was going well , your people turned to sin again , and once more you let their enemies conquer them . Yet whenever your people returned to you and cried to you for help , once more you listened from heaven , and in your wonderful mercy delivered them !
TLB	Nehemiah	9	29	You punished them in order to turn them toward your laws ; but even though they should have obeyed them , [ b ] they were proud and wouldn ’ t listen , and continued to sin .
TLB	Nehemiah	9	30	You were patient with them for many years . You sent your prophets to warn them about their sins , but still they wouldn ’ t listen . So once again you allowed the heathen nations to conquer them .
TLB	Nehemiah	9	31	But in your great mercy you did not destroy them completely or abandon them forever . What a gracious and merciful God you are !
TLB	Nehemiah	9	32	“ And now , O great and awesome God , you who keep your promises of love and kindness—do not let all the hardships we have gone through become as nothing to you . Great trouble has come upon us and upon our kings and princes and priests and prophets and ancestors from the days when the kings of Assyria first triumphed over us until now .
TLB	Nehemiah	9	33	Every time you punished us you were being perfectly fair ; we have sinned so greatly that you gave us only what we deserved .
TLB	Nehemiah	9	34	Our kings , princes , priests , and ancestors didn ’ t obey your laws or listen to your warnings .
TLB	Nehemiah	9	35	They did not worship you despite the wonderful things you did for them and the great goodness you showered upon them . You gave them a large , fat land , but they refused to turn from their wickedness .
TLB	Nehemiah	9	36	“ So now we are slaves here in the land of plenty that you gave to our ancestors ! Slaves among all this abundance !
TLB	Nehemiah	9	37	The lush yield of this land passes into the hands of the kings whom you have allowed to conquer us because of our sins . They have power over our bodies and our cattle , and we serve them at their pleasure and are in great misery .
TLB	Nehemiah	9	38	Because of all this , we again promise to serve the Lord ! And we and our princes and Levites and priests put our names to this covenant. ” Footnotes - Nehemiah 9:1 October

TLB	Nehemiah	10	28	These men signed on behalf of the entire nation—for the common people , the priests , the Levites , the gatekeepers , the choir members , the Temple servants , and all the rest who , with their wives and sons and daughters who were old enough to understand , had separated themselves from the heathen people of the land in order to serve God .
TLB	Nehemiah	10	29	For we all heartily agreed to this oath and vowed to accept the curse of God unless we obeyed God ’ s laws as issued by his servant Moses .
TLB	Nehemiah	10	30	We also agreed not to let our daughters marry non-Jewish men and not to let our sons marry non-Jewish girls .
TLB	Nehemiah	10	31	We further agreed that if the heathen people in the land should bring any grain or other produce to be sold on the Sabbath or on any other holy day , we would refuse to buy it . And we agreed not to do any work every seventh year and to forgive and cancel the debts of our brother Jews .
TLB	Nehemiah	10	32	We also agreed to charge ourselves annually with a Temple tax so that there would be enough money to care for the Temple of our God ;
TLB	Nehemiah	10	33	for we needed supplies of the special Bread of the Presence , as well as grain offerings and burnt offerings for the Sabbaths , the new moon feasts , and the annual feasts . We also needed to purchase the other items necessary for the work of the Temple and for the atonement of Israel .
TLB	Nehemiah	10	34	Then we tossed a coin [ a ] to determine when—at regular times each year—the families of the priests , Levites , and leaders should supply the wood for the burnt offerings at the Temple as required in the law .
TLB	Nehemiah	10	35	We also agreed always to bring the first part of every crop to the Temple—whether it be a ground crop or from our fruit and olive trees .
TLB	Nehemiah	10	36	We agreed to give to God our oldest sons and the firstborn of all our cattle , herds , and flocks , just as the law requires ; we presented them to the priests who minister in the Temple of our God .
TLB	Nehemiah	10	37	They stored the produce in the Temple of our God—the best of our grain crops , and other contributions , the first of our fruit , and the first of the new wine and olive oil . And we promised to bring to the Levites a tenth of everything our land produced , for the Levites were responsible to collect the tithes in all our rural towns .
TLB	Nehemiah	10	38	A priest—a descendant of Aaron—would be with the Levites as they received these tithes , and a tenth of all that was collected as tithes was delivered to the Temple and placed in the storage areas .
TLB	Nehemiah	10	39	The people and the Levites were required by law to bring these offerings of grain , new wine , and olive oil to the Temple and place them in the sacred containers for use by the ministering priests , the gatekeepers , and the choir singers . So we agreed together not to neglect the Temple of our God . Footnotes - Nehemiah 10:34 tossed a coin , literally , “ cast lots , ” a form of dice . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Nehemiah	12	30	The priests and Levites first dedicated themselves , then the people , the gates , and the wall . 31-32 I led the Judean leaders to the top of the wall and divided them into two long lines to walk in opposite directions along the top of the wall , giving thanks as they went . The group which went to the right toward the Dung Gate consisted of half of the leaders of Judah ,
TLB	Nehemiah	12	33	including Hoshaiah , Azariah , Ezra , Meshullam ,
TLB	Nehemiah	12	34	Judah , Benjamin , Shemaiah , and Jeremiah . 35-36 The priests who played the trumpets were Zechariah ( son of Jonathan , son of Shemaiah , son of Mattaniah , son of Micaiah , son of Zaccur , son of Asaph ) , Shemaiah , Azarel , Milalai , Gilalai , Maai , Nethanel , Judah , and Hanani . ( They used the original musical instruments of King David . ) Ezra the priest led this procession .
TLB	Nehemiah	12	37	When they arrived at the Fountain Gate they went straight ahead and climbed the stairs that go up beside the castle to the old City of David ; then they went to the Water Gate on the east .
TLB	Nehemiah	12	38	The other group , of which I was a member , went around the other way to meet them . We walked from the Tower of Furnaces to the Broad Wall ,
TLB	Nehemiah	12	39	then from the Ephraim Gate to the Old Gate , passed the Fish Gate and the Tower of Hananel , and went on to the gate of the Tower of the Hundred ; then we continued on to the Sheep Gate and stopped at the Prison Gate . 40-41 Both choirs then proceeded to the Temple . Those with me were joined by the trumpet-playing priests—Eliakim , Maaseiah , Miniamin , Micaiah , Elioenai , Zechariah , and Hananiah ,
TLB	Nehemiah	12	42	and by the singers—Maaseiah , Shemaiah , Eleazar , Uzzi , Jehohanan , Malchijah , Elam , and Ezer . They sang loudly and clearly under the direction of Jezrahiah the choirmaster .
TLB	Nehemiah	12	43	Many sacrifices were offered on that joyous day , for God had given us cause for great joy . The women and children rejoiced , too , and the joy of the people of Jerusalem was heard far away !
TLB	Nehemiah	12	44	On that day men were appointed to be in charge of the treasuries , the wave offerings , the tithes , and first-of-the-harvest offerings , and to collect these from the farms as decreed by the laws of Moses . These offerings were assigned to the priests and Levites , for the people of Judah appreciated the priests and Levites and their ministry .
TLB	Nehemiah	12	45	They also appreciated the work of the singers and gatekeepers , who assisted them in worshiping God and performing the purification ceremonies as required by the laws of David and his son Solomon .
TLB	Nehemiah	12	46	( It was in the days of David and Asaph that the custom began of having choir directors to lead the choirs in hymns of praise and thanks to God . )
TLB	Nehemiah	12	47	So now , in the days of Zerubbabel and Nehemiah , the people brought a daily supply of food for the members of the choir , the gatekeepers , and the Levites . The Levites , in turn , gave a portion of what they received to the priests .

TLB	Nehemiah	13	13	I put Shelemiah the priest , Zadok the scribe , and Pedaiah the Levite in charge of the administration of the storehouses ; and I appointed Hanan ( son of Zaccur , son of Mattaniah ) as their assistant . These men had an excellent reputation , and their job was to make an honest distribution to their fellow Levites .
TLB	Nehemiah	13	2	For they had not been friendly to the people of Israel . Instead , they had hired Balaam to curse them—although God turned the curse into a blessing .
TLB	Nehemiah	13	3	When this rule was read , all the foreigners were immediately expelled from the assembly .
TLB	Nehemiah	13	4	Before this had happened , Eliashib the priest , who had been appointed as custodian of the Temple storerooms and who was also a good friend of Tobiah ,
TLB	Nehemiah	13	5	had converted a storage room into a beautiful guest room for Tobiah . The room had previously been used for storing the grain offerings , frankincense , bowls , and tithes of grain , new wine , and olive oil . Moses had decreed that these offerings belonged to the priests , Levites , the members of the choir , and the gatekeepers .
TLB	Nehemiah	13	6	I was not in Jerusalem at the time , for I had returned to Babylon in the thirty-second year of the reign of King Artaxerxes ( though I later received his permission to go back again to Jerusalem ) .
TLB	Nehemiah	13	7	When I arrived back in Jerusalem and learned of this evil deed of Eliashib—that he had prepared a guest room in the Temple for Tobiah—
TLB	Nehemiah	13	8	I was very upset and threw out all of his belongings from the room .
TLB	Nehemiah	13	9	Then I demanded that the room be thoroughly cleaned , and I brought back the Temple bowls , the grain offerings , and frankincense .
TLB	Nehemiah	13	10	I also learned that the Levites had not been given what was due them , so they and the choir singers who were supposed to conduct the worship services had returned to their farms .
TLB	Nehemiah	13	11	I immediately confronted the leaders and demanded , “ Why has the Temple been forsaken ? ” Then I called all the Levites back again and restored them to their proper duties .
TLB	Nehemiah	13	12	And once more all the people of Judah began bringing their tithes of grain , new wine , and olive oil to the Temple treasury .
TLB	Nehemiah	13	14	O my God , remember this good deed and do not forget all that I have done for the Temple .
TLB	Nehemiah	13	15	One day I was on a farm and saw some men treading winepresses on the Sabbath , hauling in sheaves , and loading their donkeys with wine , grapes , figs , and all sorts of produce , which they took that day into Jerusalem . So I opposed them publicly .
TLB	Nehemiah	13	16	There were also some men from Tyre bringing in fish and all sorts of wares and selling them on the Sabbath to the people of Jerusalem .
TLB	Nehemiah	13	17	Then I asked the leaders of Judah , “ Why are you profaning the Sabbath ?
TLB	Nehemiah	13	18	Wasn ’ t it enough that your fathers did this sort of thing and brought the present evil days upon us and upon our city ? And now you are bringing more wrath upon the people of Israel by permitting the Sabbath to be desecrated in this way. ”
TLB	Nehemiah	13	19	So from then on I commanded that the gates of the city be shut as darkness fell on Friday evenings and not be opened until the Sabbath had ended ; and I sent some of my servants to guard the gates so that no merchandise could be brought in on the Sabbath day .
TLB	Nehemiah	13	20	The merchants and tradesmen camped outside Jerusalem once or twice ,
TLB	Nehemiah	13	21	but I spoke sharply to them and said , “ What are you doing out here , camping around the wall ? If you do this again , I will arrest you. ” And that was the last time they came on the Sabbath .
TLB	Nehemiah	13	22	Then I commanded the Levites to purify themselves and to guard the gates in order to preserve the sanctity of the Sabbath . Remember this good deed , O my God ! Have compassion upon me in accordance with your great goodness .
TLB	Nehemiah	13	23	About the same time I realized that some of the Jews had married women from Ashdod , Ammon , and Moab ,
TLB	Nehemiah	13	24	and that many of their children spoke in the language of Ashdod and couldn ’ t speak the language of Judah at all .
TLB	Nehemiah	13	25	So I confronted these parents and cursed them and punched a few of them and knocked them around and pulled out their hair ; and they vowed before God that they would not let their children intermarry with non-Jews .
TLB	Nehemiah	13	26	“ Wasn ’ t this exactly King Solomon ’ s problem ? ” I demanded . “ There was no king who could compare with him , and God loved him and made him the king over all Israel ; but even so he was led into idolatry by foreign women .
TLB	Nehemiah	13	27	Do you think that we will let you get away with this sinful deed ? ”
TLB	Nehemiah	13	28	One of the sons of Jehoiada ( the son of Eliashib the High Priest ) was a son-in-law of Sanballat the Horonite , so I chased him out of the Temple .
TLB	Nehemiah	13	29	Remember them , O my God , for they have defiled the priesthood and the promises and vows of the priests and Levites .
TLB	Nehemiah	13	30	So I purged out the foreigners and assigned tasks to the priests and Levites , making certain that each knew his work .
TLB	Nehemiah	13	31	They supplied wood for the altar at the proper times and cared for the sacrifices and the first offerings of every harvest . Remember me , my God , with your kindness . Footnotes - Nehemiah 13:1 See Deuteronomy 23:3-5 . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Esther	1	1	1-3 It was the third year of the reign of King Ahasuerus , emperor of vast Media-Persia , with its
TLB	Esther	1	127	provinces stretching from India to Ethiopia . This was the year of the great celebration at Shushan Palace , to which the emperor invited all his governors , aides , and army officers , bringing them in from every part of Media-Persia for the occasion .
TLB	Esther	1	4	The celebration lasted six months , a tremendous display of the wealth and glory of his empire .
TLB	Esther	1	5	When it was all over , the king gave a special party for the palace servants and officials—janitors and cabinet officials alike—for seven days of revelry , held in the courtyard of the palace garden .
TLB	Esther	1	6	The decorations were green , white , and blue , fastened with purple ribbons [ a ] tied to silver rings imbedded in marble pillars . Gold and silver benches stood on pavements of black , red , white , and yellow marble .
TLB	Esther	1	7	Drinks were served in gold goblets of many designs , and there was an abundance of royal wine , for the king was feeling very generous .
TLB	Esther	1	8	The only restriction on the drinking was that no one should be compelled to take more than he wanted , but those who wished could have as much as they pleased . For the king had instructed his officers to let everyone decide this matter for himself .
TLB	Esther	1	9	Queen Vashti gave a party for the women of the palace at the same time .
TLB	Esther	1	10	On the final day when the king was feeling high , half drunk from wine , he told the seven eunuchs who were his personal aides—Mehuman , Biztha , Harbona , Bigtha , Abagtha , Zethar , and Carkas—
TLB	Esther	1	11	to bring Queen Vashti to him with the royal crown upon her head so that all the men could gaze upon her beauty—for she was a very beautiful woman .
TLB	Esther	1	12	But when they conveyed the emperor ’ s order to Queen Vashti , she refused to come . The king was furious 13-15 but first consulted his lawyers , for he did nothing without their advice . They were men of wisdom who knew the temper of the times as well as Persian law and justice , and the king trusted their judgment . These men were Carshena , Shethar , Admatha , Tarshish , Meres , Marsena , and Memucan—seven high officials of Media-Persia . They were his personal friends as well as being the chief officers of the government . “ What shall we do about this situation ? ” he asked them . “ What penalty does the law provide for a queen who refuses to obey the king ’ s orders , properly sent through his aides ? ”
TLB	Esther	1	16	Memucan answered for the others , “ Queen Vashti has wronged not only the king but every official and citizen of your empire .
TLB	Esther	1	17	For women everywhere will begin to disobey their husbands when they learn what Queen Vashti has done .
TLB	Esther	1	18	And before this day is out , the wife of every one of us officials throughout your empire will hear what the queen did and will start talking to us husbands the same way , and there will be contempt and anger throughout your realm .
TLB	Esther	1	19	We suggest that , subject to your agreement , you issue a royal edict , a law of the Medes and Persians that can never be changed , that Queen Vashti be forever banished from your presence and that you choose another queen more worthy than she .
TLB	Esther	1	20	When this decree is published throughout your great kingdom , husbands everywhere , whatever their rank , will be respected by their wives ! ”
TLB	Esther	1	21	The king and all his aides thought this made good sense , so he followed Memucan ’ s counsel
TLB	Esther	1	22	and sent letters to all of his provinces , in all the local languages , stressing that every man should rule his home and should assert his authority .

TLB	Esther	2	2	So his aides suggested , “ Let us go and find the most beautiful girls in the empire and bring them to the king for his pleasure .
TLB	Esther	2	3	We will appoint agents in each province to select young lovelies for the royal harem . Hegai , the eunuch in charge , will see that they are given beauty treatments ,
TLB	Esther	2	4	and after that , the girl who pleases you most shall be the queen instead of Vashti. ” This suggestion naturally pleased the king very much , and he put the plan into immediate effect .
TLB	Esther	2	5	Now there was a certain Jew at the palace named Mordecai ( son of Jair , son of Shimei , son of Kish , a Benjaminite ) .
TLB	Esther	2	6	He had been captured when Jerusalem was destroyed by King Nebuchadnezzar and had been exiled to Babylon along with King Jeconiah of Judah and many others .
TLB	Esther	2	7	This man had a beautiful and lovely young cousin , Hadassah ( also called Esther ) , whose father and mother were dead , and whom he had adopted into his family and raised as his own daughter . [ a ]
TLB	Esther	2	8	So now , as a result of the king ’ s decree , Esther was brought to the king ’ s harem at Shushan Palace along with many other young girls .
TLB	Esther	2	9	Hegai , who was responsible for the harem , was very much impressed with her and did his best to make her happy ; he ordered a special menu for her , favored her for the beauty treatments , gave her seven girls from the palace as her maids , and gave her the most luxurious apartment in the harem .
TLB	Esther	2	10	Esther hadn ’ t told anyone that she was a Jewess , for Mordecai had said not to .
TLB	Esther	2	11	He came daily to the court of the harem to ask about Esther and to find out what was happening to her . 12-14 The instructions concerning these girls were that before being taken to the king ’ s bed , each would be given six months of beauty treatments with oil of myrrh , followed by six months with special perfumes and ointments . Then , as each girl ’ s turn came for spending the night with King Ahasuerus , she was given her choice of clothing or jewelry she wished , to enhance her beauty . She was taken to the king ’ s apartment in the evening and the next morning returned to the second harem where the king ’ s wives lived . There she was under the care of Shaashgaz , another of the king ’ s eunuchs and lived there the rest of her life , never seeing the king again unless he had especially enjoyed her and called for her by name .
TLB	Esther	2	15	When it was Esther ’ s [ b ] turn to go to the king , she accepted the advice of Hegai , the eunuch in charge of the harem , dressing according to his instructions . And all the other girls exclaimed with delight when they saw her .
TLB	Esther	2	16	So Esther was taken to the palace of the king in January of the seventh year of his reign .
TLB	Esther	2	17	Well , the king loved Esther more than any of the other girls . He was so delighted with her that he set the royal crown on her head and declared her queen instead of Vashti .
TLB	Esther	2	18	To celebrate the occasion , he threw another big party for all his officials and servants , giving generous gifts to everyone and making grants to the provinces in the form of remission of taxes .
TLB	Esther	2	19	Later the king demanded a second bevy of beautiful girls . [ c ] By that time Mordecai had become a government official .
TLB	Esther	2	20	Esther still hadn ’ t told anyone she was a Jewess , for she was still following Mordecai ’ s orders , just as she had in his home .
TLB	Esther	2	21	One day as Mordecai was on duty at the palace , two of the king ’ s eunuchs , Bigthan and Teresh—who were guards at the palace gate—became angry at the king and plotted to assassinate him .
TLB	Esther	2	22	Mordecai heard about it and passed on the information to Queen Esther , who told the king , crediting Mordecai with the information .
TLB	Esther	2	23	An investigation was made , the two men found guilty , and impaled alive . [ d ] This was all duly recorded in the book of the history of King Ahasuerus ’ reign . Footnotes - Esther 2:7 his own daughter , showing that Mordecai had adopted his cousin as his daughter . - Esther 2:15 Esther ’ s , literally , “ Esther , the daughter of Abihail , who was Mordecai ’ s uncle , who had adopted her. ” - Esther 2:19 Later . . . a second bevy of beautiful girls , or “ When Esther and the other girls had been transferred to the second harem. ” - Esther 2:23 impaled alive , literally , “ hanged on a tree. ” Possibly the meaning is that they were crucified .

TLB	Esther	3	3	Soon afterwards King Ahasuerus appointed Haman ( son of Hammedatha the Agagite ) as prime minister . He was the most powerful official in the empire next to the king himself .
TLB	Esther	3	2	Now all the king ’ s officials bowed before him in deep reverence whenever he passed by , for so the king had commanded . But Mordecai refused to bow . 3-4 “ Why are you disobeying the king ’ s commandment ? ” the others demanded day after day , but he still refused . Finally they spoke to Haman about it to see whether Mordecai could get away with it because of his being a Jew , which was the excuse he had given them . 5-6 Haman was furious but decided not to lay hands on Mordecai alone , but to move against all of Mordecai ’ s people , the Jews , and destroy all of them throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus .
TLB	Esther	3	7	The most propitious time for this action was determined by throwing dice . This was done in April of the twelfth year of the reign of Ahasuerus , and February of the following year was the date indicated .
TLB	Esther	3	8	Haman now approached the king about the matter . “ There is a certain race of people scattered through all the provinces of your kingdom , ” he began , “ and their laws are different from those of any other nation , and they refuse to obey the king ’ s laws ; therefore , it is not in the king ’ s interest to let them live .
TLB	Esther	3	9	If it please the king , issue a decree that they be destroyed , and I will pay $ 20,000,000 into the royal treasury for the expenses involved in this purge. ”
TLB	Esther	3	10	The king agreed , confirming his decision by removing his ring from his finger and giving it to Haman , [ a ] telling him ,
TLB	Esther	3	11	“ Keep the money , but go ahead and do as you like with these people—whatever you think best. ”
TLB	Esther	3	12	Two or three weeks later , [ b ] Haman called in the king ’ s secretaries and dictated letters to the governors and officials throughout the empire , to each province in its own languages and dialects ; these letters were signed in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed with his ring .
TLB	Esther	3	13	They were then sent by messengers into all the provinces of the empire , decreeing that the Jews—young and old , women and children—must all be killed on the 28th day of February of the following year and their property given to those who killed them .
TLB	Esther	3	14	“ A copy of this edict , ” the letter stated , “ must be proclaimed as law in every province and made known to all your people , so that they will be ready to do their duty on the appointed day. ”
TLB	Esther	3	15	The edict went out by the king ’ s speediest couriers , after being first proclaimed in the city of Shushan . Then the king and Haman sat down for a drinking spree as the city fell into confusion and panic .

TLB	Esther	4	4	When Esther ’ s maids and eunuchs came and told her about Mordecai , she was deeply distressed and sent clothing to him to replace the sackcloth , but he refused it .
TLB	Esther	4	2	Then he stood outside the gate of the palace , for no one was permitted to enter in mourning clothes .
TLB	Esther	4	3	And throughout all the provinces there was great mourning among the Jews , fasting , weeping , and despair at the king ’ s decree ; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes .
TLB	Esther	4	5	Then Esther sent for Hathach , one of the king ’ s eunuchs who had been appointed as her attendant , and told him to go out to Mordecai and find out what the trouble was and why he was acting like that .
TLB	Esther	4	6	So Hathach went out to the city square and found Mordecai just outside the palace gates ,
TLB	Esther	4	7	and heard the whole story from him , and about the $ 20,000,000 Haman had promised to pay into the king ’ s treasury for the destruction of the Jews .
TLB	Esther	4	8	Mordecai also gave Hathach a copy of the king ’ s decree dooming all Jews , and told him to show it to Esther and to tell her what was happening and that she should go to the king to plead for her people .
TLB	Esther	4	9	So Hathach returned to Esther with Mordecai ’ s message .
TLB	Esther	4	10	Esther told Hathach to go back and say to Mordecai ,
TLB	Esther	4	11	“ All the world knows that anyone , whether man or woman , who goes into the king ’ s inner court without his summons is doomed to die unless the king holds out his gold scepter ; and the king has not called for me to come to him in more than a month. ”
TLB	Esther	4	12	So Hathach gave Esther ’ s message to Mordecai .
TLB	Esther	4	13	This was Mordecai ’ s reply to Esther : “ Do you think you will escape there in the palace when all other Jews are killed ?
TLB	Esther	4	14	If you keep quiet at a time like this , God will deliver the Jews from some other source , but you and your relatives will die ; what ’ s more , who can say but that God has brought you into the palace for just such a time as this ? ”
TLB	Esther	4	15	Then Esther sent this message to Mordecai :
TLB	Esther	4	16	“ Go and gather together all the Jews of Shushan and fast for me ; do not eat or drink for three days , night or day ; and I and my maids will do the same ; and then , though it is strictly forbidden , I will go in to see the king ; and if I perish , I perish. ”

TLB	Esther	5	5	The king turned to his aides . “ Tell Haman to hurry ! ” he said . So the king and Haman came to Esther ’ s banquet .
TLB	Esther	5	2	And when he saw Queen Esther standing there in the inner court , he welcomed her , holding out the golden scepter to her . So Esther approached and touched its tip .
TLB	Esther	5	3	Then the king asked her , “ What do you wish , Queen Esther ? What is your request ? I will give it to you , even if it is half the kingdom ! ”
TLB	Esther	5	4	And Esther replied , “ If it please Your Majesty , I want you and Haman to come to a banquet I have prepared for you today. ”
TLB	Esther	5	6	During the wine course the king said to Esther , “ Now tell me what you really want , and I will give it to you , even if it is half of the kingdom ! ” 7-8 Esther replied , “ My request , my deepest wish , is that if Your Majesty loves me and wants to grant my request , that you come again with Haman tomorrow to the banquet I shall prepare for you . And tomorrow I will explain what this is all about. ”
TLB	Esther	5	9	What a happy man was Haman as he left the banquet ! But when he saw Mordecai there at the gate , not standing up or trembling before him , he was furious .
TLB	Esther	5	10	However , he restrained himself , went on home , and gathered together his friends and Zeresh , his wife ,
TLB	Esther	5	11	and boasted to them about his wealth , his many children , and promotions the king had given him , and how he had become the greatest man in the kingdom next to the king himself .
TLB	Esther	5	12	Then he delivered his punch line : “ Yes , and Esther the queen invited only me and the king himself to the banquet she prepared for us ; and tomorrow we are invited again !
TLB	Esther	5	13	But yet , ” he added , “ all this is nothing when I see Mordecai the Jew just sitting there in front of the king ’ s gate , refusing to bow to me. ”
TLB	Esther	5	14	“ Well , ” suggested Zeresh , his wife , and all his friends , “ get ready a 75-foot-high gallows , and in the morning ask the king to let you hang Mordecai on it ; and when this is done you can go on your merry way with the king to the banquet. ” This pleased Haman immensely , and he ordered the gallows built .

TLB	Esther	6	6	So Haman came in , and the king said to him , “ What should I do to honor a man who truly pleases me ? ” Haman thought to himself , “ Whom would he want to honor more than me ? ” 7-8 So he replied , “ Bring out some of the royal robes the king himself has worn , and the king ’ s own horse , and the royal crown ,
TLB	Esther	6	3	“ What reward did we ever give Mordecai for this ? ” the king asked . His courtiers replied , “ Nothing ! ”
TLB	Esther	6	4	“ Who is on duty in the outer court ? ” the king inquired . Now , as it happened , Haman had just arrived in the outer court of the palace to ask the king to hang Mordecai from the gallows he was building .
TLB	Esther	6	5	So the courtiers replied to the king , “ Haman is out there. ” “ Bring him in , ” the king ordered .
TLB	Esther	6	9	and instruct one of the king ’ s most noble princes to robe the man and to lead him through the streets on the king ’ s own horse , shouting before him , ‘ This is the way the king honors those who truly please him ! ’ ”
TLB	Esther	6	10	“ Excellent ! ” the king said to Haman . “ Hurry and take these robes and my horse , and do just as you have said—to Mordecai the Jew , who works at the Chancellery . Follow every detail you have suggested. ”
TLB	Esther	6	11	So Haman took the robes and put them on Mordecai , and mounted him on the king ’ s own steed , and led him through the streets of the city , shouting , “ This is the way the king honors those he delights in. ”
TLB	Esther	6	12	Afterwards Mordecai returned to his job , but Haman hurried home utterly humiliated .
TLB	Esther	6	13	When Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends what had happened , they said , “ If Mordecai is a Jew , you will never succeed in your plans against him ; to continue to oppose him will be fatal. ”
TLB	Esther	6	14	While they were still discussing it with him , the king ’ s messengers arrived to conduct Haman quickly to the banquet Esther had prepared . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Esther	7	7	The king jumped to his feet and went out into the palace garden as Haman stood up to plead for his life to Queen Esther , for he knew that he was doomed .
TLB	Esther	7	2	Again , during the wine course , the king asked her , “ What is your petition , Queen Esther ? What do you wish ? Whatever it is , I will give it to you , even if it is half of my kingdom ! ”
TLB	Esther	7	3	And at last Queen Esther replied , “ If I have won your favor , O King , and if it please Your Majesty , save my life and the lives of my people .
TLB	Esther	7	4	For I and my people have been sold to those who will destroy us . We are doomed to destruction and slaughter . If we were only to be sold as slaves , perhaps I could remain quiet , though even then there would be incalculable damage to the king that no amount of money could begin to cover. ”
TLB	Esther	7	5	“ What are you talking about ? ” King Ahasuerus demanded . “ Who would dare touch you ? ”
TLB	Esther	7	6	Esther replied , “ This wicked Haman is our enemy. ” Then Haman grew pale with fright before the king and queen .
TLB	Esther	7	8	In despair he fell upon the couch where Queen Esther was reclining , just as the king returned from the palace garden . “ Will he even rape the queen right here in the palace , before my very eyes ? ” the king roared . Instantly the death veil was placed over Haman ’ s face .
TLB	Esther	7	9	Then Harbona , one of the king ’ s aides , said , “ Sir , Haman has just ordered a 75-foot gallows constructed , to hang Mordecai , the man who saved the king from assassination ! It stands in Haman ’ s courtyard. ” “ Hang Haman on it , ” the king ordered .
TLB	Esther	7	10	So they did , and the king ’ s wrath was pacified . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Esther	8	8	Now go ahead and send a message to the Jews , telling them whatever you want to in the king ’ s name , and seal it with the king ’ s ring so that it can never be reversed. ” [ c ] 9-10 Immediately the king ’ s secretaries were called in—it was now the 23rd day of the month of July—and they wrote as Mordecai dictated—a decree to the Jews and to the officials , governors , and princes of all the provinces from India to Ethiopia ,
TLB	Esther	8	2	The king took off his ring—which he had taken back from Haman—and gave it to Mordecai appointing him Prime Minister ; [ b ] and Esther appointed Mordecai to be in charge of Haman ’ s estate .
TLB	Esther	8	3	And now once more Esther came before the king , falling down at his feet and begging him with tears to stop Haman ’ s plot against the Jews .
TLB	Esther	8	4	And again the king held out the golden scepter to Esther . So she arose and stood before him ,
TLB	Esther	8	5	and said , “ If it please Your Majesty , and if you love me , send out a decree reversing Haman ’ s order to destroy the Jews throughout the king ’ s provinces .
TLB	Esther	8	6	For how can I endure it , to see my people butchered and destroyed ? ”
TLB	Esther	8	7	Then King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther and Mordecai the Jew , “ I have given Esther the palace of Haman , and he has been hanged upon the gallows because he tried to destroy you .
TLB	Esther	8	127	in all : the decree was translated into the languages and dialects of all the people of the kingdom . Mordecai wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed the message with the king ’ s ring and sent the letters by swift carriers—riders on camels , mules , and young dromedaries used in the king ’ s service .
TLB	Esther	8	11	This decree gave the Jews everywhere permission to unite in the defense of their lives and their families , to destroy all the forces opposed to them , and to take their property .
TLB	Esther	8	12	The day chosen for this throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus was the 28th day of February ! [ d ]
TLB	Esther	8	13	It further stated that a copy of this decree , which must be recognized everywhere as law , must be broadcast to all the people so that the Jews would be ready and prepared to overcome their enemies .
TLB	Esther	8	14	So the mail went out swiftly , carried by the king ’ s couriers and speeded by the king ’ s commandment . The same decree was also issued at Shushan Palace .
TLB	Esther	8	15	Then Mordecai put on the royal robes of blue and white and the great crown of gold , with an outer cloak of fine linen and purple , and went out from the presence of the king through the city streets filled with shouting people .
TLB	Esther	8	16	And the Jews had joy and gladness and were honored everywhere .
TLB	Esther	8	17	And in every city and province , as the king ’ s decree arrived , the Jews were filled with joy and had a great celebration and declared a holiday . And many of the people of the land pretended to be Jews , for they feared what the Jews might do to them . Footnotes - Esther 8:1 told the king that he was her cousin and foster father , literally , “ had made known how they were related. ” - Esther 8:2 appointing him Prime Minister , implied . - Esther 8:8 so that it can never be reversed . Haman ’ s message , too , had been sealed with the king ’ s ring and could not be reversed , even by the king . This was part of the famed “ law of the Medes and Persians. ” Now the king is giving permission for whatever other decree Mordecai can devise that will offset the first without actually canceling it . - Esther 8:12 the 28th day of February . This was the same day set by Haman for the extermination of the Jews . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Esther	9	9	1-2 So on the 28th day of February , the day the two decrees of the king were to be put into effect—the day the Jews ’ enemies had hoped to vanquish them , though it turned out quite to the contrary—the Jews gathered in their cities throughout all the king ’ s provinces to defend themselves against any who might try to harm them ; but no one tried , for they were greatly feared .
TLB	Esther	9	3	And all the rulers of the provinces—the governors , officials , and aides—helped the Jews for fear of Mordecai ;
TLB	Esther	9	4	for Mordecai was a mighty name in the king ’ s palace and his fame was known throughout all the provinces , for he had become more and more powerful .
TLB	Esther	9	5	But the Jews went ahead on that appointed day and slaughtered their enemies .
TLB	Esther	9	6	They even killed
TLB	Esther	9	500	men in Shushan alone , ” he exclaimed , “ and also Haman ’ s ten sons . If they have done that here , I wonder what has happened in the rest of the provinces ! But now , what more do you want ? It will be granted to you . Tell me and I will do it. ”
TLB	Esther	9	11	Late that evening , when the king was informed of the number of those slain in Shushan ,
TLB	Esther	9	12	he called for Queen Esther . “ The Jews have killed
TLB	Esther	9	13	And Esther said , “ If it please Your Majesty , let the Jews who are here at Shushan do again tomorrow as they have done today , and let Haman ’ s ten sons be hanged upon the gallows. ”
TLB	Esther	9	14	So the king agreed , and the decree was announced at Shushan , and they hung up the bodies of Haman ’ s ten sons .
TLB	Esther	9	15	Then the Jews at Shushan gathered together the next day also and killed
TLB	Esther	9	300	more men , though again they took no property .
TLB	Esther	9	16	Meanwhile the other Jews throughout the king ’ s provinces had gathered together and stood for their lives and destroyed all their enemies , killing 75,000 of those who hated them ; but they did not take their goods .
TLB	Esther	9	17	Throughout the provinces this was done on the 28th day of February , and the next day they rested , celebrating their victory with feasting and gladness .
TLB	Esther	9	18	But the Jews at Shushan went on killing their enemies the second day also and rested the next day , with feasting and gladness .
TLB	Esther	9	19	And so it is that the Jews in the unwalled villages throughout Israel to this day have an annual celebration on the second day when they rejoice and send gifts to each other .
TLB	Esther	9	20	Mordecai wrote a history of all these events and sent letters to the Jews near and far , throughout all the king ’ s provinces ,
TLB	Esther	9	21	encouraging them to declare an annual holiday on the last two days of the month ,
TLB	Esther	9	22	to celebrate with feasting , gladness , and the giving of gifts these historic days when the Jews were saved from their enemies , when their sorrow was turned to gladness and their mourning into happiness .
TLB	Esther	9	23	So the Jews adopted Mordecai ’ s suggestion and began this annual custom 24-25 as a reminder of the time when Haman ( son of Hammedatha the Agagite ) , the enemy of all the Jews , had plotted to destroy them at the time determined by a throw of the dice ; and to remind them that when the matter came before the king , he issued a decree causing Haman ’ s plot to boomerang , and he and his sons were hanged on the gallows .
TLB	Esther	9	26	That is why this celebration is called “ Purim ” because the word for “ throwing dice ” in Persian is pur .
TLB	Esther	9	27	All the Jews throughout the realm agreed to inaugurate this tradition and to pass it on to their descendants and to all who became Jews ; they declared they would never fail to celebrate these two days at the appointed time each year .
TLB	Esther	9	28	It would be an annual event from generation to generation , celebrated by every family throughout the countryside and cities of the empire , so that the memory of what had happened would never perish from the Jewish race . 29-31 Meanwhile Queen Esther ( daughter of Abihail and later adopted by Mordecai the Jew ) had written a letter throwing her full support behind Mordecai ’ s letter inaugurating his annual Feast of Purim . In addition , letters were sent to all the Jews throughout the
TLB	Esther	9	127	provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus with messages of good will and encouragement to confirm these two days annually as the Feast of Purim , decreed by both Mordecai the Jew and by Queen Esther ; indeed , the Jews themselves had decided upon this tradition as a remembrance of the time of their national fasting and prayer .
TLB	Esther	9	32	So the commandment of Esther confirmed these dates , and it was recorded as law . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Job	1	1	There lived in the land of Uz a man named Job—a good [ a ] man who feared God and stayed away from evil . 2-3 He had a large family of seven sons and three daughters and was immensely wealthy , [ b ] for he owned 7,000 sheep , 3,000 camels ,
TLB	Job	1	500	female donkeys , and employed many servants . He was , in fact , the richest cattleman in that entire area .
TLB	Job	1	4	Every year when Job ’ s sons had birthdays , they invited their brothers and sisters to their homes for a celebration . On these occasions they would eat and drink with great merriment .
TLB	Job	1	5	When these birthday parties ended—and sometimes they lasted several days—Job would summon his children to him and sanctify them , getting up early in the morning and offering a burnt offering for each of them . For Job said , “ Perhaps my sons have sinned and turned away from God [ c ] in their hearts. ” This was Job ’ s regular practice .
TLB	Job	1	6	One day as the angels [ d ] came to present themselves before the Lord , Satan , the Accuser , came with them .
TLB	Job	1	7	“ Where have you come from ? ” the Lord asked Satan . And Satan replied , “ From earth , where I ’ ve been watching everything that ’ s going on. ”
TLB	Job	1	8	Then the Lord asked Satan , “ Have you noticed my servant Job ? He is the finest man in all the earth—a good man [ e ] who fears God and will have nothing to do with evil. ”
TLB	Job	1	9	“ Why shouldn ’ t he when you pay him so well ? ” Satan scoffed .
TLB	Job	1	10	“ You have always protected him and his home and his property from all harm . You have prospered everything he does—look how rich he is ! No wonder he ‘ worships ’ you !
TLB	Job	1	11	But just take away his wealth , and you ’ ll see him curse you to your face ! ” 12-13 And the Lord replied to Satan , “ You may do anything you like with his wealth , but don ’ t harm him physically. ” So Satan went away ; and sure enough , not long afterwards when Job ’ s sons and daughters were dining at the oldest brother ’ s house , tragedy struck . 14-15 A messenger rushed to Job ’ s home with this news : “ Your oxen were plowing , with the donkeys feeding beside them , when the Sabeans raided us , drove away the animals , and killed all the farmhands except me . I am the only one left. ”
TLB	Job	1	16	While this messenger was still speaking , another arrived with more bad news : “ The fire of God has fallen from heaven and burned up your sheep and all the herdsmen , and I alone have escaped to tell you. ”
TLB	Job	1	17	Before this man finished , still another messenger rushed in : “ Three bands of Chaldeans have driven off your camels and killed your servants , and I alone have escaped to tell you. ”
TLB	Job	1	18	As he was still speaking , another arrived to say , “ Your sons and daughters were feasting in their oldest brother ’ s home ,
TLB	Job	1	19	when suddenly a mighty wind swept in from the desert and engulfed the house so that the roof fell in on them and all are dead ; and I alone escaped to tell you. ”
TLB	Job	1	20	Then Job stood up and tore his robe in grief [ f ] and fell down upon the ground before God .
TLB	Job	1	21	“ I came naked from my mother ’ s womb , ” he said , “ and I shall have nothing when I die . The Lord gave me everything I had , and they were his to take away . Blessed be the name of the Lord. ”
TLB	Job	1	22	In all of this Job did not sin or revile God . Footnotes The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Job	2	2	“ Where have you come from ? ” the Lord asked Satan . “ From earth , where I ’ ve been watching everything that ’ s going on , ” Satan replied .
TLB	Job	2	3	“ Well , have you noticed my servant Job ? ” the Lord asked . “ He is the finest man in all the earth—a good man who fears God and turns away from all evil . And he has kept his faith in me despite the fact that you persuaded me to let you harm him without any cause. ” 4-5 “ Skin for skin , ” Satan replied . “ A man will give anything to save his life . Touch his body with sickness , and he will curse you to your face ! ”
TLB	Job	2	6	“ Do with him as you please , ” the Lord replied ; “ only spare his life. ”
TLB	Job	2	7	So Satan went out from the presence of the Lord and struck Job with a terrible case of boils from head to foot .
TLB	Job	2	8	Then Job took a broken piece of pottery to scrape himself and sat among the ashes .
TLB	Job	2	9	His wife said to him , “ Are you still trying to be godly when God has done all this to you ? Curse him and die. ”
TLB	Job	2	10	But he replied , “ You talk like some heathen woman . What ? Shall we receive only pleasant things from the hand of God and never anything unpleasant ? ” So in all this Job said nothing wrong .
TLB	Job	2	11	When three of Job ’ s friends heard of all the tragedy that had befallen him , they got in touch with each other and traveled from their homes to comfort and console him . Their names were Eliphaz the Temanite , Bildad the Shuhite , and Zophar the Naamathite .
TLB	Job	2	12	Job was so changed that they could scarcely recognize him . Wailing loudly in despair , they tore their robes and threw dust into the air and put earth on their heads to demonstrate their sorrow .
TLB	Job	2	13	Then they sat upon the ground with him silently for seven days and nights , no one speaking a word ; for they saw that his suffering was too great for words . Footnotes - Job 2:1 the angels , literally , “ the sons of God. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Job	3	3	At last Job spoke and cursed the day of his birth . 2-3 “ Let the day of my birth be cursed , ” he said , “ and the night when I was conceived .
TLB	Job	3	4	Let that day be forever forgotten . [ a ] Let it be lost even to God , shrouded in eternal darkness .
TLB	Job	3	5	Yes , let the darkness claim it for its own , and may a black cloud overshadow it .
TLB	Job	3	6	May it be blotted off the calendar , never again to be counted among the days of the month of that year .
TLB	Job	3	7	Let that night be bleak and joyless .
TLB	Job	3	8	Let those who are experts at cursing curse it . [ b ]
TLB	Job	3	9	Let the stars of the night disappear . Let it long for light but never see it , never see the morning light .
TLB	Job	3	10	Curse it for its failure to shut my mother ’ s womb , for letting me be born to come to all this trouble .
TLB	Job	3	11	“ Why didn ’ t I die at birth ?
TLB	Job	3	12	Why did the midwife let me live ? Why did she nurse me at her breasts ?
TLB	Job	3	13	For if only I had died at birth , then I would be quiet now , asleep and at rest , 14-15 along with prime ministers and kings with all their pomp , and wealthy princes whose castles are full of rich treasures .
TLB	Job	3	16	Oh , to have been stillborn ! —to have never breathed or seen the light .
TLB	Job	3	17	For there in death the wicked cease from troubling , and there the weary are at rest .
TLB	Job	3	18	There even prisoners are at ease , with no brutal jailer to curse them .
TLB	Job	3	19	Both rich and poor alike are there , and the slave is free at last from his master . 20-21 “ Oh , why should light and life be given to those in misery and bitterness , who long for death , and it won ’ t come ; who search for death as others search for food or money ?
TLB	Job	3	22	What blessed relief when at last they die !
TLB	Job	3	23	Why is a man allowed to be born if God is only going to give him a hopeless life of uselessness and frustration ?
TLB	Job	3	24	I can not eat for sighing ; my groans pour out like water .
TLB	Job	3	25	What I always feared has happened to me .
TLB	Job	3	26	I was not fat and lazy , yet trouble struck me down. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Job	4	4	A reply to Job from Eliphaz the Temanite :
TLB	Job	4	2	“ Will you let me say a word ? For who could keep from speaking out ? 3-4 In the past [ a ] you have told many a troubled soul to trust in God and have encouraged those who are weak or falling , or lie crushed upon the ground or are tempted to despair .
TLB	Job	4	5	But now when trouble strikes , you faint and are broken .
TLB	Job	4	6	“ At such a time as this should not trust in God still be your confidence ? Shouldn ’ t you believe that God will care for those who are good ? [ b ] 7-8 Stop and think ! Have you ever known a truly good and innocent person who was punished ? Experience teaches that it is those who sow sin and trouble who harvest the same .
TLB	Job	4	9	They die beneath the hand of God .
TLB	Job	4	10	Though they are fierce as young lions , they shall all be broken and destroyed .
TLB	Job	4	11	Like aged , helpless lions they shall starve , and all their children shall be scattered .
TLB	Job	4	12	“ This truth was given me in secret , as though whispered in my ear .
TLB	Job	4	13	It came in a nighttime vision as others slept .
TLB	Job	4	14	Suddenly , fear gripped me ; I trembled and shook with terror ,
TLB	Job	4	15	as a spirit passed before my face—my hair stood up on end .
TLB	Job	4	16	I felt the spirit ’ s presence , but couldn ’ t see it standing there . Then out of the dreadful silence came this voice :
TLB	Job	4	17	“ ‘ Is mere man more just than God ? More pure than his Creator ? ’ 18-19 “ If God can not trust his own messengers ( for even angels make mistakes ) , how much less men made of dust , who are crushed to death as easily as moths !
TLB	Job	4	20	They are alive in the morning , but by evening they are dead , gone forever with hardly a thought from anyone .
TLB	Job	4	21	Their candle of life is snuffed out . They die and no one cares . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Job	5	5	Their harvests are stolen , and their wealth slakes the thirst of many others , not themselves !
TLB	Job	5	2	They die in helpless frustration , overcome by their own anger .
TLB	Job	5	3	Those who turn from God may be successful for the moment , but then comes sudden disaster .
TLB	Job	5	4	Their children are cheated , with no one to defend them .
TLB	Job	5	6	Misery comes upon them to punish them for sowing seeds of sin .
TLB	Job	5	7	Mankind heads for sin and misery as predictably as flames shoot upwards from a fire .
TLB	Job	5	8	“ My advice to you is this : Go to God and confess your sins to him . [ a ]
TLB	Job	5	9	For he does wonderful miracles , marvels without number .
TLB	Job	5	10	He sends the rain upon the earth to water the fields ,
TLB	Job	5	11	and gives prosperity to the poor and humble , and takes sufferers to safety .
TLB	Job	5	12	“ He frustrates the plans of crafty men .
TLB	Job	5	13	They are caught in their own traps ; he thwarts their schemes .
TLB	Job	5	14	They grope like blind men in the daylight ; they see no better in the daytime than at night .
TLB	Job	5	15	“ God saves the fatherless and the poor from the grasp of these oppressors .
TLB	Job	5	16	And so at last the poor have hope , and the fangs of the wicked are broken .
TLB	Job	5	17	“ How enviable the man whom God corrects ! Oh , do not despise the chastening of the Lord when you sin .
TLB	Job	5	18	For though he wounds , he binds and heals again .
TLB	Job	5	19	He will deliver you again and again so that no evil can touch you .
TLB	Job	5	20	“ He will keep you from death in famine and from the power of the sword in time of war .
TLB	Job	5	21	“ You will be safe from slander ; no need to fear the future .
TLB	Job	5	22	“ You shall laugh at war and famine ; wild animals will leave you alone .
TLB	Job	5	23	Dangerous animals will be at peace with you .
TLB	Job	5	24	“ You need not worry about your home while you are gone ; nothing shall be stolen from your barns .
TLB	Job	5	25	“ Your sons shall become important men ; your descendants shall be as numerous as grass !
TLB	Job	5	26	You shall live a long , good life ; like standing grain , you ’ ll not be harvested until it ’ s time !
TLB	Job	5	27	I have found from experience that all of this is true . For your own good , listen to my counsel. ” Footnotes - Job 5:8 Go to God and confess your sins to him , literally , “ I would seek God , and to God would I commit my cause. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Job	6	6	Job ’ s reply :
TLB	Job	6	2	“ Oh , that my sadness and troubles were weighed .
TLB	Job	6	3	For they are heavier than the sand of a thousand seashores . That is why I spoke so rashly .
TLB	Job	6	4	For the Lord has struck me down with his arrows ; he has sent his poisoned arrows deep within my heart . All God ’ s terrors are arrayed against me . 5-7 When wild donkeys bray , it is because their grass is gone ; oxen do not low when they have food ; a man complains when there is no salt in his food . And how tasteless is the uncooked white of an egg—my appetite is gone when I look at it ; I gag at the thought of eating it ! 8-9 “ Oh , that God would grant the thing I long for most—to die beneath his hand and be freed from his painful grip .
TLB	Job	6	10	This , at least , gives me comfort despite all the pain—that I have not denied the words of the holy God .
TLB	Job	6	11	Oh , why does my strength sustain me ? How can I be patient till I die ?
TLB	Job	6	12	Am I unfeeling , like stone ? Is my flesh made of brass ?
TLB	Job	6	13	For I am utterly helpless , without any hope .
TLB	Job	6	14	“ One should be kind to a fainting friend , but you have accused me without the slightest fear of God . 15-18 My brother , you have proved as unreliable as a brook ; it floods when there is ice and snow , but in hot weather , disappears . The caravans turn aside to be refreshed , but there is nothing there to drink , and so they perish . 19-21 When caravans from Tema and from Sheba stop for water there , their hopes are dashed . And so my hopes in you are dashed—you turn away from me in terror and refuse to help .
TLB	Job	6	22	But why ? Have I ever asked you for one slightest thing ? Have I begged you for a present ?
TLB	Job	6	23	Have I ever asked your help ?
TLB	Job	6	24	All I want is a reasonable answer—then I will keep quiet . Tell me , what have I done wrong ? 25-26 “ It is wonderful to speak the truth , but your criticisms are not based on fact . Are you going to condemn me just because I impulsively cried out in desperation ?
TLB	Job	6	27	That would be like injuring a helpless orphan , or selling a friend .
TLB	Job	6	28	Look at me ! Would I lie to your face ?
TLB	Job	6	29	Stop assuming my guilt , for I am righteous . Don ’ t be so unjust .
TLB	Job	6	30	Don ’ t I know the difference between right and wrong ? Would I not admit it if I had sinned ? The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Job	7	16	I hate my life . Oh , leave me alone for these few remaining days .

TLB	Job	8	6	if you were pure and good , he would hear your prayer and answer you and bless you with a happy home .
TLB	Job	8	7	And though you started with little , you would end with much .
TLB	Job	8	9	for we were born but yesterday and know so little ; our days here on earth are as transient as shadows .
TLB	Job	8	10	But the wisdom of the past will teach you . The experience of others will speak to you , reminding you that 11-13 those who forget God have no hope . They are like rushes without any mire to grow in ; or grass without water to keep it alive . Suddenly it begins to wither , even before it is cut .
TLB	Job	8	14	A man without God is trusting in a spider ’ s web . Everything he counts on will collapse .
TLB	Job	8	15	If he counts on his home for security , it won ’ t last .
TLB	Job	8	16	At dawn he seems so strong and virile , like a green plant ; his branches spread across the garden .
TLB	Job	8	17	His roots are in the stream , down among the stones .
TLB	Job	8	18	But when he disappears , he isn ’ t even missed !
TLB	Job	8	19	That is all he can look forward to ! And others spring up from the earth to replace him !
TLB	Job	8	20	“ But look ! God will not cast away a good man , nor prosper evildoers .
TLB	Job	8	21	He will yet fill your mouth with laughter and your lips with shouts of joy .
TLB	Job	8	22	Those who hate you shall be clothed with shame , and the wicked destroyed. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Job	9	9	He made the Bear , Orion and the Pleiades , and the constellations of the southern Zodiac .
TLB	Job	9	2	“ Yes , I know all that . You ’ re not telling me anything new . But how can a man be truly good in the eyes of God ?
TLB	Job	9	3	If God decides to argue with him , can a man answer even one question of a thousand he asks ?
TLB	Job	9	4	For God is so wise and so mighty . Who has ever opposed him successfully ?
TLB	Job	9	5	“ Suddenly he moves the mountains , overturning them in his anger .
TLB	Job	9	6	He shakes the earth to its foundations .
TLB	Job	9	7	The sun won ’ t rise , the stars won ’ t shine , if he commands it so !
TLB	Job	9	8	Only he has stretched the heavens out and stalked along the seas .
TLB	Job	9	10	“ He does incredible miracles , too many to count .
TLB	Job	9	11	He passes by , invisible ; he moves along , but I don ’ t see him go .
TLB	Job	9	12	When he sends death to snatch a man away , [ a ] who can stop him ? Who dares to ask him , ‘ What are you doing ? ’
TLB	Job	9	13	“ And God does not abate his anger . The pride of man [ b ] collapses before him .
TLB	Job	9	14	And who am I that I should try to argue with Almighty God , or even reason with him ?
TLB	Job	9	15	Even if I were sinless , I wouldn ’ t say a word . I would only plead for mercy .
TLB	Job	9	16	And even if my prayers were answered , I could scarce believe that he had heard my cry .
TLB	Job	9	17	For he is the one who destroys , and multiplies my wounds without a cause .
TLB	Job	9	18	He will not let me breathe , but fills me with bitter sorrows .
TLB	Job	9	19	He alone is strong and just .
TLB	Job	9	20	“ But I ? Am I righteous ? My own mouth says no . Even if I were perfect , God would prove me wicked .
TLB	Job	9	21	And even if I am utterly innocent , I dare not think of it . I despise what I am .
TLB	Job	9	22	Innocent or evil , it is all the same to him , for he destroys both kinds .
TLB	Job	9	23	He will laugh when calamity crushes the innocent .
TLB	Job	9	24	The whole earth is in the hands of the wicked . God blinds the eyes of the judges and lets them be unfair . If not he , then who ?
TLB	Job	9	25	“ My life passes swiftly away , filled with tragedy .
TLB	Job	9	26	My years disappear like swift ships , like the eagle that swoops upon its prey .
TLB	Job	9	27	“ If I decided to forget my complaints against God , to end my sadness and be cheerful ,
TLB	Job	9	28	then he would pour even greater sorrows upon me . For I know that you will not hold me innocent , O God ,
TLB	Job	9	29	but will condemn me . So what ’ s the use of trying ?
TLB	Job	9	30	Even if I were to wash myself with purest water and cleanse my hands with lye to make them utterly clean ,
TLB	Job	9	31	even so you would plunge me into the ditch and mud ; and even my clothing would be less filthy than you consider me to be ! 32-33 “ And I can not defend myself , for you are no mere man as I am . If you were , then we could discuss it fairly , but there is no umpire between us , no middle man , no mediator to bring us together .
TLB	Job	9	34	Oh , let him stop beating me , so that I need no longer live in terror of his punishment .
TLB	Job	9	35	Then I could speak without fear to him and tell him boldly that I am not guilty . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Job	10	10	You have already poured me from bottle to bottle like milk and curdled me like cheese .
TLB	Job	10	2	I will say to God , ‘ Don ’ t just condemn me—tell me why you are doing it .
TLB	Job	10	3	Does it really seem right to you to oppress and despise me , a man you have made ; and to send joy and prosperity to the wicked ? 4-7 Are you unjust [ a ] like men ?

TLB	Job	10	8	“ ‘ You have made me , and yet you destroy me .
TLB	Job	10	9	Oh , please remember that I ’ m made of dust—will you change me back again to dust so soon ?

TLB	Job	10	12	You gave me life and were so kind and loving to me , and I was preserved by your care . 13-14 “ ‘ Yet all the time your real motive in making me was to destroy me if I sinned , and to refuse to forgive my iniquity .
TLB	Job	10	15	Just the slightest wickedness , and I am done for . And if I ’ m good , that doesn ’ t count . I am filled with frustration .
TLB	Job	10	16	If I start to get up off the ground , you leap upon me like a lion and quickly finish me off .
TLB	Job	10	17	Again and again you witness against me and pour out an ever-increasing volume of wrath upon me and bring fresh armies against me .
TLB	Job	10	18	“ ‘ Why then did you even let me be born ? Why didn ’ t you let me die at birth ?
TLB	Job	10	19	Then I would have been spared this miserable existence . I would have gone directly from the womb to the grave . 20-21 Can ’ t you see how little time I have left ?

TLB	Job	19	19	“ My best friends abhor me . Those I loved have turned against me .
TLB	Job	19	2	“ How long are you going to trouble me , and try to break me with your words ?
TLB	Job	19	3	Ten times now you have declared I am a sinner . Why aren ’ t you ashamed to deal with me so harshly ?
TLB	Job	19	4	And if indeed I was wrong , you have yet to prove it .
TLB	Job	19	5	You think yourselves so great ? Then prove my guilt !
TLB	Job	19	6	“ The fact of the matter is that God has overthrown me and caught me in his net .
TLB	Job	19	7	I scream for help and no one hears me . I shriek , but get no justice .
TLB	Job	19	8	God has blocked my path and turned my light to darkness .
TLB	Job	19	9	He has stripped me of my glory and removed the crown from my head .
TLB	Job	19	10	He has broken me down on every side , and I am done for . He has destroyed all hope .
TLB	Job	19	11	His fury burns against me ; he counts me as an enemy .
TLB	Job	19	12	He sends his troops to surround my tent .
TLB	Job	19	13	“ He has sent away my brothers and my friends .
TLB	Job	19	14	My relatives have failed me ; my friends have all forsaken me .
TLB	Job	19	15	Those living in my home , even my servants , regard me as a stranger . I am like a foreigner to them .
TLB	Job	19	16	I call my servant , but he doesn ’ t come ; I even beg him !
TLB	Job	19	17	My own wife and brothers refuse to recognize me .
TLB	Job	19	18	Even young children despise me . When I stand to speak , they mock .
TLB	Job	19	20	I am skin and bones and have escaped death by the skin of my teeth .
TLB	Job	19	21	“ Oh , my friends , pity me , for the angry hand of God has touched me .
TLB	Job	19	22	Why must you persecute me as God does ? Why aren ’ t you satisfied with my anguish ? 23-24 Oh , that I could write my plea with an iron pen in the rock forever .
TLB	Job	19	25	“ But as for me , I know that my Redeemer lives , and that he will stand upon the earth at last .
TLB	Job	19	26	And I know that after this body has decayed , this body shall see God ! [ a ]
TLB	Job	19	27	Then he will be on my side ! Yes , I shall see him , not as a stranger , but as a friend ! What a glorious hope !
TLB	Job	19	28	“ How dare you go on persecuting me , as though I were proven guilty ?
TLB	Job	19	29	I warn you , you yourselves are in danger of punishment for your attitude. ” Footnotes - Job 19:26 this body shall see God , or “ then even without my flesh I shall see God. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Job	20	20	Though he was always greedy , now he has nothing ; of all the things he dreamed of—none remain .
TLB	Job	20	2	“ I hasten to reply , for I have the answer for you .
TLB	Job	20	3	You have tried to make me feel ashamed of myself for calling you a sinner , but my spirit won ’ t let me stop .
TLB	Job	20	4	“ Don ’ t you realize that ever since man was first placed upon the earth ,
TLB	Job	20	5	the triumph of the wicked has been short-lived , and the joy of the godless but for a moment ?
TLB	Job	20	6	Though the godless be proud as the heavens and walk with his nose in the air ,
TLB	Job	20	7	yet he shall perish forever , cast away like his own dung . Those who knew him will wonder where he has gone .
TLB	Job	20	8	He will fade like a dream .
TLB	Job	20	9	Neither his friends nor his family will ever see him again .
TLB	Job	20	10	“ His children shall beg from the poor , their hard labor shall repay his debts .
TLB	Job	20	11	Though still a young man , his bones shall lie in the dust .
TLB	Job	20	12	“ He enjoyed the taste of his wickedness , letting it melt in his mouth ,
TLB	Job	20	13	sipping it slowly , lest it disappear .
TLB	Job	20	14	“ But suddenly the food he has eaten turns sour within him .
TLB	Job	20	15	He will vomit the plunder he gorged . God won ’ t let him keep it down .
TLB	Job	20	16	It is like poison and death to him .
TLB	Job	20	17	He shall not enjoy the goods he stole ; they will not be butter and honey to him after all .
TLB	Job	20	18	His labors shall not be rewarded ; wealth will give him no joy .
TLB	Job	20	19	For he has oppressed the poor and foreclosed their homes ; he will never recover .
TLB	Job	20	21	Because he stole at every opportunity , his prosperity shall not continue .
TLB	Job	20	22	“ He shall run into trouble at the peak of his powers ; all the wicked shall destroy him .
TLB	Job	20	23	Just as he is about to fill his belly , God will rain down wrath upon him .
TLB	Job	20	24	He will be chased and struck down .
TLB	Job	20	25	The arrow is pulled from his body—and the glittering point comes out from his gall . The terrors of death are upon him .
TLB	Job	20	26	“ His treasures will be lost in deepest darkness . A raging fire will devour his goods , consuming all he has left .
TLB	Job	20	27	The heavens will reveal his sins , and the earth will give testimony against him .
TLB	Job	20	28	His wealth will disappear beneath the wrath of God .

TLB	Job	21	21	For when he is dead , then he will never again be able to enjoy his family .
TLB	Job	21	4	“ I am complaining about God , [ a ] not man ; no wonder my spirit is so troubled .
TLB	Job	21	5	Look at me in horror , and lay your hand upon your mouth .
TLB	Job	21	6	Even I am frightened when I see myself . Horror takes hold upon me and I shudder .
TLB	Job	21	7	“ The truth is that the wicked live on to a good old age and become great and powerful .
TLB	Job	21	8	They live to see their children grow to maturity around them , and their grandchildren too .
TLB	Job	21	9	Their homes are safe from every fear , and God does not punish them .
TLB	Job	21	10	Their cattle are productive ,
TLB	Job	21	11	they have many happy children , 12-13 they spend their time singing and dancing . They are wealthy and need deny themselves nothing ; they are prosperous to the end .
TLB	Job	21	14	All this despite the fact that they ordered God away and wanted no part of him and his ways .
TLB	Job	21	15	“ ‘ Who is Almighty God ? ’ they scoff . ‘ Why should we obey him ? What good will it do us ? ’
TLB	Job	21	16	“ Look , everything the wicked touch has turned to gold ! But I refuse even to deal with people like that .
TLB	Job	21	17	Yet the wicked get away with it every time . They never have trouble , and God skips them when he distributes his sorrows and anger .
TLB	Job	21	18	Are they driven before the wind like straw ? Are they carried away by the storm ? Not at all !
TLB	Job	21	19	“ ‘ Well , ’ you say , ‘ at least God will punish their children ! ’ But I say that God should punish the man who sins , not his children ! Let him feel the penalty himself .
TLB	Job	21	20	Yes , let him be destroyed for his iniquity . Let him drink deeply of the anger of the Almighty .
TLB	Job	21	22	“ But who can rebuke God , the supreme Judge ? 23-24 He destroys those who are healthy , wealthy , fat , and prosperous ;
TLB	Job	21	25	God also destroys those in deep and grinding poverty who have never known anything good .
TLB	Job	21	26	Both alike are buried in the same dust , both eaten by the same worms .
TLB	Job	21	27	“ I know what you are going to say—
TLB	Job	21	28	you will tell me of rich and wicked men who came to disaster because of their sins .
TLB	Job	21	29	But I reply , Ask anyone who has been around and he can tell you the truth , 30-32 that the evil man is usually spared in the day of calamity and allowed to escape . No one rebukes him openly . No one repays him for what he has done . And an honor guard keeps watch at his grave .
TLB	Job	21	33	A great funeral procession precedes and follows him as the soft earth covers him .

TLB	Job	22	22	Listen to his instructions and store them in your heart .
TLB	Job	22	2	“ Is mere man of any worth to God ? Even the wisest is of value only to himself !
TLB	Job	22	3	Is it any pleasure to the Almighty if you are righteous ? Would it be any gain to him if you were perfect ?
TLB	Job	22	4	Is it because you are good that he is punishing you ?
TLB	Job	22	5	Not at all ! It is because of your wickedness ! Your sins are endless !
TLB	Job	22	6	“ For instance , you must have refused to loan money to needy friends unless they gave you all their clothing as a pledge—yes , you must have stripped them to the bone .
TLB	Job	22	7	You must have refused water to the thirsty and bread to the starving .
TLB	Job	22	8	But no doubt you gave men of importance anything they wanted and let the wealthy live wherever they chose .
TLB	Job	22	9	You sent widows away without helping them and broke the arms of orphans . 10-11 That is why you are now surrounded by traps and sudden fears , and darkness and waves of horror .
TLB	Job	22	12	“ God is so great—higher than the heavens , higher than the stars .
TLB	Job	22	13	But you reply , ‘ That is why he can ’ t see what I am doing ! How can he judge through the thick darkness ?
TLB	Job	22	14	For thick clouds swirl about him so that he can not see us . He is way up there , walking on the vault of heaven. ’ 15-16 “ Don ’ t you realize that those treading the ancient paths of sin are snatched away in youth , and the foundations of their lives washed out forever ?
TLB	Job	22	17	For they said to God , ‘ Go away , God ! What can you do for us ? ’
TLB	Job	22	18	( God forbid that I should say a thing like that . ) Yet they forgot that he had filled their homes with good things .
TLB	Job	22	19	And now the righteous shall see them destroyed ; the innocent shall laugh the wicked to scorn .
TLB	Job	22	20	‘ See , ’ they will say , ‘ the last of our enemies have been destroyed in the fire. ’
TLB	Job	22	21	“ Quit quarreling with God ! Agree with him and you will have peace at last ! His favor will surround you if you will only admit that you were wrong .
TLB	Job	22	23	If you return to God and put right all the wrong in your home , then you will be restored .
TLB	Job	22	24	If you give up your lust for money and throw your gold away ,
TLB	Job	22	25	then the Almighty himself shall be your treasure ; he will be your precious silver !
TLB	Job	22	26	“ Then you will delight yourself in the Lord and look up to God .
TLB	Job	22	27	You will pray to him , and he will hear you , and you will fulfill all your promises to him .
TLB	Job	22	28	Whatever you wish will happen ! And the light of heaven will shine upon the road ahead of you .

TLB	Job	23	23	The reply of Job :
TLB	Job	23	2	“ My complaint today is still a bitter one , and my punishment far more severe than my fault deserves .
TLB	Job	23	3	Oh , that I knew where to find God—that I could go to his throne and talk with him there . 4-5 I would tell him all about my side of this argument , and listen to his reply , and understand what he wants .
TLB	Job	23	6	Would he merely overpower me with his greatness ? No , he would listen with sympathy .
TLB	Job	23	7	Fair and honest men could reason with him and be acquitted by my Judge .
TLB	Job	23	8	“ But I search in vain . I seek him here , I seek him there and can not find him .
TLB	Job	23	9	I seek him in his workshop in the north but can not find him there ; nor can I find him in the south ; there , too , he hides himself .
TLB	Job	23	10	But he knows every detail of what is happening to me ; and when he has examined me , he will pronounce me completely innocent—as pure as solid gold !
TLB	Job	23	11	“ I have stayed in God ’ s paths , following his steps . I have not turned aside .
TLB	Job	23	12	I have not refused his commandments but have enjoyed them more than my daily food .
TLB	Job	23	13	Nevertheless , his mind concerning me remains unchanged , and who can turn him from his purposes ? Whatever he wants to do , he does .
TLB	Job	23	14	So he will do to me all he has planned , and there is more ahead . [ a ]
TLB	Job	23	15	“ No wonder I am so terrified in his presence . When I think of it , terror grips me . 16-17 God has given me a fainting heart ; he , the Almighty , has terrified me with darkness all around me , thick , impenetrable darkness everywhere .

TLB	Job	24	24	But though they are very great now , yet in a moment they shall be gone like all others , cut off like heads of grain .
TLB	Job	24	2	For a crime wave has engulfed us—landmarks are moved , flocks of sheep are stolen ,
TLB	Job	24	3	and even the donkeys of the poor and fatherless are taken . Poor widows must surrender the little they have as a pledge to get a loan .
TLB	Job	24	4	The needy are kicked aside ; they must get out of the way .
TLB	Job	24	5	Like the wild donkeys in the desert , the poor must spend all their time just getting barely enough to keep soul and body together . They are sent into the desert to search for food for their children .
TLB	Job	24	6	They eat what they find that grows wild and must even glean the vineyards of the wicked .
TLB	Job	24	7	All night they lie naked in the cold , without clothing or covering .
TLB	Job	24	8	They are wet with the showers of the mountains and live in caves for want of a home .
TLB	Job	24	9	“ The wicked snatch fatherless children from their mother ’ s breasts , and take a poor man ’ s baby as a pledge before they will loan him any money or grain .
TLB	Job	24	10	That is why they must go about naked , without clothing , and are forced to carry food while they are starving .
TLB	Job	24	11	They are forced to press out the olive oil without tasting it and to tread out the grape juice as they suffer from thirst .
TLB	Job	24	12	The bones of the dying cry from the city ; the wounded cry for help ; yet God does not respond to their moaning .
TLB	Job	24	13	“ The wicked rebel against the light and are not acquainted with the right and the good . 14-15 They are murderers who rise in the early dawn to kill the poor and needy ; at night they are thieves and adulterers , waiting for the twilight ‘ when no one will see me , ’ they say . They mask their faces so no one will know them .
TLB	Job	24	16	They break into houses at night and sleep in the daytime—they are not acquainted with the light .
TLB	Job	24	17	The black night is their morning ; they ally themselves with the terrors of the darkness .
TLB	Job	24	18	“ But how quickly they disappear from the face of the earth . Everything they own is cursed . They leave no property for their children .
TLB	Job	24	19	Death consumes sinners as drought and heat consume snow .
TLB	Job	24	20	Even the sinner ’ s own mother shall forget him . Worms shall feed sweetly on him . No one will remember him anymore . For wicked men are broken like a tree in the storm .
TLB	Job	24	21	For they have taken advantage of the childless who have no protecting sons . They refuse to help the needy widows . 22-23 “ Yet sometimes [ a ] it seems as though God preserves the rich by his power and restores them to life when anyone else would die . God gives them confidence and strength , and helps them in many ways .

TLB	Job	27	2	“ I vow by the living God , who has taken away my rights , even the Almighty God who has embittered my soul ,
TLB	Job	27	3	that as long as I live , while I have breath from God ,
TLB	Job	27	4	my lips shall speak no evil , my tongue shall speak no lies .
TLB	Job	27	5	I will never , never agree that you are right ; until I die I will vow my innocence .
TLB	Job	27	6	I am not a sinner—I repeat it again and again . My conscience is clear for as long as I live .
TLB	Job	27	7	Those who declare otherwise are my wicked enemies . They are evil men .
TLB	Job	27	8	“ But what hope has the godless when God cuts him off and takes away his life ?
TLB	Job	27	9	Will God listen to his cry when trouble comes upon him ?
TLB	Job	27	10	For he does not delight himself in the Almighty or pay any attention to God except in times of crisis .
TLB	Job	27	11	“ I will teach you about God—
TLB	Job	27	12	but really , I don ’ t need to , for you yourselves know as much about him as I do ; yet you are saying all these useless things to me .
TLB	Job	27	13	“ This is the fate awaiting the wicked from the hand of the Almighty :
TLB	Job	27	14	If he has a multitude of children , it is so that they will die in war or starve to death .
TLB	Job	27	15	Those who survive shall be brought down to the grave by disease and plague , with no one to mourn them , not even their wives .
TLB	Job	27	16	“ The evil man may accumulate money like dust , with closets jammed full of clothing—
TLB	Job	27	17	yes , he may order them made by his tailor , but the innocent shall wear that clothing and shall divide his silver among them .
TLB	Job	27	18	Every house built by the wicked is as fragile as a spider web , as full of cracks as a leafy booth !

TLB	Job	29	13	I helped those who were ready to perish , and they blessed me . And I caused the widows ’ hearts to sing for joy .
TLB	Job	29	14	All I did was just and honest , for righteousness was my clothing !
TLB	Job	29	15	I served as eyes for the blind and feet for the lame .
TLB	Job	29	16	I was as a father to the poor and saw to it that even strangers received a fair trial .
TLB	Job	29	17	I knocked out the fangs of the godless oppressors and made them drop their victims .
TLB	Job	29	18	“ I thought , ‘ Surely I shall die quietly in my nest after a long , good life. ’
TLB	Job	29	19	For everything I did prospered ; the dew lay all night upon my fields and watered them .
TLB	Job	29	20	Fresh honors were constantly given me , and my abilities were constantly refreshed and renewed .
TLB	Job	29	21	Everyone listened to me and valued my advice , and was silent until I spoke .
TLB	Job	29	22	And after I spoke , they spoke no more , for my counsel satisfied them .
TLB	Job	29	23	They longed for me to speak as those in drought-time long for rain . They waited eagerly with open mouths .
TLB	Job	29	24	When they were discouraged , I smiled and that encouraged them and lightened their spirits .

TLB	Job	30	30	My skin is black and peeling . My bones burn with fever .
TLB	Job	30	2	Oh , they have strong backs all right , but they are useless , stupid fools .
TLB	Job	30	3	They are gaunt with famine and have been cast out into deserts and the wastelands , desolate and gloomy .
TLB	Job	30	4	They eat roots and leaves ,
TLB	Job	30	5	having been driven from civilization . Men shouted after them as after thieves .
TLB	Job	30	6	So now they live in frightening ravines , and in caves , and among the rocks .
TLB	Job	30	7	They sound like animals among the bushes , huddling together for shelter beneath the nettles .
TLB	Job	30	8	These sons of theirs have also turned out to be fools , yes , children of no name , outcasts of civilization .
TLB	Job	30	9	“ And now I have become the subject of their ribald song ! I am a joke among them !
TLB	Job	30	10	They despise me and won ’ t come near me , and don ’ t mind spitting in my face .
TLB	Job	30	11	For God has placed my life in jeopardy . These young men , having humbled me , now cast off all restraint before me .
TLB	Job	30	12	This rabble trips me and lays traps in my path .
TLB	Job	30	13	They block my road and do everything they can to hasten my calamity , knowing full well that I have no one to help me .
TLB	Job	30	14	They come at me from all directions . They rush upon me when I am down .
TLB	Job	30	15	“ I live in terror now . They hold me in contempt , and my prosperity has vanished as a cloud before a strong wind .
TLB	Job	30	16	My heart is broken . Depression haunts my days .
TLB	Job	30	17	My weary nights are filled with pain as though something were relentlessly gnawing at my bones .
TLB	Job	30	18	All night long I toss and turn , and my garments bind about me .
TLB	Job	30	19	God has thrown me into the mud . I have become as dust and ashes .
TLB	Job	30	20	“ I cry to you , O God , but you don ’ t answer me . I stand before you and you don ’ t bother to look .
TLB	Job	30	21	You have become cruel toward me and persecute me with great power and effect .
TLB	Job	30	22	You throw me into the whirlwind and dissolve me in the storm .
TLB	Job	30	23	And I know that your purpose for me is death .
TLB	Job	30	24	I expected my fall to be broken , just as one who falls stretches out his hand or cries for help in his calamity .
TLB	Job	30	25	“ And did I not weep for those in trouble ? Wasn ’ t I deeply grieved for the needy ?
TLB	Job	30	26	I therefore looked for good to come . Evil came instead . I waited for the light . Darkness came .
TLB	Job	30	27	My heart is troubled and restless . Waves of affliction have come upon me . 28-29 I am black but not from sunburn . I stand up and cry to the assembly for help . But I might as well save my breath , [ a ] for I am considered a brother to jackals and a companion to ostriches .

TLB	Job	31	31	or if any of my servants have ever gone hungry—
TLB	Job	31	4	He sees everything I do and every step I take .
TLB	Job	31	5	“ If I have lied and deceived—
TLB	Job	31	6	but God knows that I am innocent— 7-8 or if I have stepped off God ’ s pathway , or if my heart has lusted for what my eyes have seen , or if I am guilty of any other sin , then let someone else reap the crops I have sown and let all that I have planted be rooted out .
TLB	Job	31	9	“ Or if I have longed for another man ’ s wife ,
TLB	Job	31	10	then may I die , and may my wife be in another man ’ s home and someone else become her husband .
TLB	Job	31	11	For lust is a shameful sin , a crime that should be punished .
TLB	Job	31	12	It is a devastating fire that destroys to hell and would root out all I have planted .
TLB	Job	31	13	“ If I have been unfair to my servants ,
TLB	Job	31	14	how could I face God ? What could I say when he questioned me about it ?
TLB	Job	31	15	For God made me and made my servant too . He created us both .
TLB	Job	31	16	“ If I have hurt the poor , or caused widows to weep ,
TLB	Job	31	17	or refused food to hungry orphans—
TLB	Job	31	18	( but we have always cared for orphans in our home , treating them as our own children ) — 19-20 or if I have seen anyone freezing and not given him clothing or fleece from my sheep to keep him warm ,
TLB	Job	31	21	or if I have taken advantage of an orphan because I thought I could get away with it—
TLB	Job	31	22	if I have done any of these things , then let my arm be torn from its socket ! Let my shoulder be wrenched out of place !
TLB	Job	31	23	Rather that than face the judgment sent by God ; that I dread more than anything else . For if the majesty of God opposes me , what hope is there ?
TLB	Job	31	24	“ If I have put my trust in money ,
TLB	Job	31	25	if my happiness depends on wealth ,
TLB	Job	31	26	or if I have looked at the sun shining in the skies or the moon walking down her silver pathway
TLB	Job	31	27	and my heart has been secretly enticed , and I have worshiped them by kissing my hand to them ,
TLB	Job	31	28	this , too , must be punished by the judges . For if I had done such things , it would mean that I denied the God of heaven .
TLB	Job	31	29	“ If I have rejoiced at harm to an enemy—
TLB	Job	31	30	( but actually I have never cursed anyone nor asked for revenge ) —
TLB	Job	31	32	( actually I have never turned away even a stranger but have opened my doors to all ) —
TLB	Job	31	33	or if , like Adam , I have tried to hide my sins ,
TLB	Job	31	34	fearing the crowd and its contempt so that I refused to acknowledge my sin and do not go out of my way to help others—
TLB	Job	31	35	( oh , that there were someone who would listen to me and try to see my side of this argument . Look , I will sign my signature to my defense ; now let the Almighty show me that I am wrong ; let him approve the indictments made against me by my enemies .
TLB	Job	31	36	I would treasure it like a crown .
TLB	Job	31	37	Then I would tell him exactly what I have done and why , presenting my defense as one he listens to ) . 38-39 “ Or if my land accuses me because I stole the fruit it bears , or if I have murdered its owners to get their land for myself ,

TLB	Job	32	32	The three men refused to reply further to Job because he kept insisting on his innocence .
TLB	Job	32	2	Then Elihu ( son of Barachel , the Buzite , of the clan of Ram ) became angry because Job refused to admit he had sinned and to acknowledge that God had just cause for punishing him .
TLB	Job	32	3	But he was also angry with Job ’ s three friends because they had been unable to answer Job ’ s arguments and yet had condemned him .
TLB	Job	32	4	Elihu had waited until now to speak because the others were older than he .
TLB	Job	32	5	But when he saw that they had no further reply , he spoke out angrily ,
TLB	Job	32	6	and said , “ I am young and you are old , so I held back and did not dare to tell you what I think ,
TLB	Job	32	7	for those who are older are said to be wiser ; 8-9 but it is not mere age that makes men wise . Rather , it is the spirit in a man , the breath of the Almighty that makes him intelligent .
TLB	Job	32	10	So listen to me awhile and let me express my opinion . 11-12 “ I have waited all this time , listening very carefully to your arguments , but not one of them has convinced Job that he is a sinner or has proved that he is .
TLB	Job	32	13	And don ’ t give me that line about ‘ only God can convince the sinner of his sin. ’
TLB	Job	32	14	If Job had been arguing with me , I would not answer with that kind of logic !
TLB	Job	32	15	“ You sit there baffled , with no further replies .
TLB	Job	32	16	Shall I then continue to wait when you are silent ?
TLB	Job	32	17	No , I will give my answer too .
TLB	Job	32	18	For I am pent up and full of words , and the spirit within me urges me on .
TLB	Job	32	19	I am like a wine cask without a vent ! My words are ready to burst out !
TLB	Job	32	20	I must speak to find relief , so let me give my answers . 21-22 Don ’ t insist that I be cautious lest I insult someone , and don ’ t make me flatter anyone . Let me be frank lest God should strike me dead . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Job	33	2	I have begun to speak ; now let me continue .
TLB	Job	33	3	I will speak the truth with all sincerity .
TLB	Job	33	4	For the Spirit of God has made me , and the breath of the Almighty gives me life .
TLB	Job	33	5	Don ’ t hesitate to answer me if you can .
TLB	Job	33	6	“ Look , I am the one you were wishing for , someone to stand between you and God and to be both his representative and yours .
TLB	Job	33	7	You need not be frightened of me . I am not some person of renown to make you nervous and afraid . I , too , am made of common clay .
TLB	Job	33	8	“ You have said it in my hearing , yes , you ’ ve said it again and again—
TLB	Job	33	9	‘ I am pure , I am innocent ; I have not sinned. ’
TLB	Job	33	10	You say God is using a fine-tooth comb to try to find a single fault , and so to count you as his enemy .
TLB	Job	33	11	‘ And he puts my feet in the stocks , ’ you say , ‘ and watches every move I make. ’
TLB	Job	33	12	“ All right , here is my reply : In this very thing , you have sinned by speaking of God that way . For God is greater than man .
TLB	Job	33	13	Why should you fight against him just because he does not give account to you of what he does ?
TLB	Job	33	14	“ For God speaks again and again ,
TLB	Job	33	15	in dreams , in visions of the night when deep sleep falls on men as they lie on their beds .
TLB	Job	33	16	He opens their ears in times like that and gives them wisdom and instruction , 17-18 causing them to change their minds , and keeping them from pride , and warning them of the penalties of sin , and keeping them from falling into some trap .
TLB	Job	33	19	“ Or God sends sickness and pain , even though no bone is broken ,
TLB	Job	33	20	so that a man loses all taste and appetite for food and doesn ’ t care for even the daintiest dessert .
TLB	Job	33	21	He becomes thin , mere skin and bones ,
TLB	Job	33	22	and draws near to death . 23-24 “ But if a messenger from heaven is there to intercede for him as a friend , to show him what is right , then God pities him and says , [ a ] ‘ Set him free . Do not make him die , for I have found a substitute. ’
TLB	Job	33	25	Then his body will become as healthy as a child ’ s , firm and youthful again .
TLB	Job	33	26	And when he prays to God , God will hear and answer and receive him with joy , and return him to his duties .
TLB	Job	33	27	And he will declare to his friends , ‘ I sinned , but God let me go .
TLB	Job	33	28	He did not let me die . I will go on living in the realm of light. ’
TLB	Job	33	29	“ Yes , God often does these things for man—
TLB	Job	33	30	brings back his soul from the pit , so that he may live in the light of the living .
TLB	Job	33	31	Mark this well , O Job . Listen to me , and let me say more .
TLB	Job	33	32	But if you have anything to say at this point , go ahead . I want to hear it , for I am anxious to justify you .

TLB	Job	34	34	Elihu continued :
TLB	Job	34	2	“ Listen to me , you wise men .
TLB	Job	34	3	We can choose the sounds we want to listen to ; we can choose the taste we want in food ,
TLB	Job	34	4	and we should choose to follow what is right . But first of all we must define among ourselves what is good .
TLB	Job	34	5	For Job has said , ‘ I am innocent , but God says I ’ m not .
TLB	Job	34	6	I am called a liar , even though I am innocent . I am horribly punished , even though I have not sinned. ’ 7-8 “ Who else is as arrogant as Job ? He must have spent much time with evil men ,
TLB	Job	34	9	for he said , ‘ Why waste time trying to please God ? ’
TLB	Job	34	10	“ Listen to me , you with understanding . Surely everyone knows that God doesn ’ t sin !
TLB	Job	34	11	Rather , he punishes the sinners .
TLB	Job	34	12	There is no truer statement than this : God is never wicked or unjust .
TLB	Job	34	13	He alone has authority over the earth and dispenses justice for the world .
TLB	Job	34	14	If God were to withdraw his Spirit ,
TLB	Job	34	15	all life would disappear and mankind would turn again to dust .
TLB	Job	34	16	“ Listen now and try to understand .
TLB	Job	34	17	Could God govern if he hated justice ? Are you going to condemn the Almighty Judge ?
TLB	Job	34	18	Are you going to condemn this God who says to kings and nobles , ‘ You are wicked and unjust ’ ?
TLB	Job	34	19	For he doesn ’ t care how great a man may be , and doesn ’ t pay any more attention to the rich than to the poor . He made them all .
TLB	Job	34	20	In a moment they die , and at midnight great and small shall suddenly pass away , removed by no human hand .
TLB	Job	34	21	“ For God carefully watches the goings on of all mankind ; he sees them all .
TLB	Job	34	22	No darkness is thick enough to hide evil men from his eyes ,
TLB	Job	34	23	so there is no need to wait for some great crime before a man is called before God in judgment .
TLB	Job	34	24	Without making a big issue over it , God simply shatters the greatest of men and puts others in their places .
TLB	Job	34	25	He watches what they do and in a single night he overturns them , destroying them ,
TLB	Job	34	26	or openly strikes them down as wicked men .
TLB	Job	34	27	For they turned aside from following him ,
TLB	Job	34	28	causing the cry of the poor to come to the attention of God . Yes , he hears the cries of those being oppressed . 29-30 Yet when he chooses not to speak , who can criticize ? Again , he may prevent a vile man from ruling , thus saving a nation from ruin , and he can depose an entire nation just as easily .
TLB	Job	34	31	“ Why don ’ t people exclaim to their God , ‘ We have sinned , but we will stop , ’
TLB	Job	34	32	or ‘ We know not what evil we have done ; only tell us , and we will cease at once ’ ?
TLB	Job	34	33	“ Must God tailor his justice to your demands ? Must he change the order of the universe to suit your whims ? The answer must be obvious even to you ! 34-35 Anyone even half bright will agree with me that you , Job , are speaking like a fool .
TLB	Job	34	36	You should be given the maximum penalty for the wicked way you have talked about God .
TLB	Job	34	37	For now you have added rebellion , arrogance , and blasphemy to your other sins. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Job	35	4	“ I will answer you and all your friends too .
TLB	Job	35	5	Look up there into the sky , high above you .
TLB	Job	35	6	If you sin , does that shake the heavens and knock God from his throne ? Even if you sin again and again , what effect will it have upon him ?
TLB	Job	35	7	Or if you are good , is this some great gift to him ?
TLB	Job	35	8	Your sins may hurt another man , or your good deeds may profit him . 9-10 The oppressed may shriek beneath their wrongs and groan beneath the power of the rich ; yet none of them cry to God , asking , ‘ Where is God my Maker who gives songs in the night
TLB	Job	35	11	and makes us a little wiser than the animals and birds ? ’
TLB	Job	35	12	“ But when anyone does cry out this question to him , he never replies by instant punishment of the tyrants . [ a ]
TLB	Job	35	13	But it is false to say he doesn ’ t hear those cries ; 14-15 and it is even more false to say that he doesn ’ t see what is going on . He does bring about justice at last if you will only wait . But do you cry out against him because he does not instantly respond in anger ?

TLB	Job	36	6	He does not reward the wicked with his blessings , but gives them their full share of punishment .
TLB	Job	36	7	He does not ignore the good men but honors them by placing them upon eternal , kingly thrones .
TLB	Job	36	8	If troubles come upon them and they are enslaved and afflicted ,
TLB	Job	36	9	then he takes the trouble to point out to them the reason , what they have done that is wrong , or how they have behaved proudly .
TLB	Job	36	10	He helps them hear his instruction to turn away from their sin .
TLB	Job	36	11	“ If they listen and obey him , then they will be blessed with prosperity throughout their lives .

TLB	Job	36	14	They die young after lives of dissipation and depravity .
TLB	Job	36	15	He delivers by distress ! This makes them listen to him !
TLB	Job	36	16	“ How he wanted to lure you away from danger into a wide and pleasant valley and to prosper you there .
TLB	Job	36	17	But you are too preoccupied with your imagined grievances against others .
TLB	Job	36	18	Watch out ! Don ’ t let your anger at others lead you into scoffing at God ! Don ’ t let your suffering embitter you at the only one who can deliver you .
TLB	Job	36	19	Do you really think that if you shout loudly enough against God , he will be ashamed and repent ? Will this put an end to your chastisement ?
TLB	Job	36	20	“ Do not desire the nighttime , with its opportunities for crime .
TLB	Job	36	21	Turn back from evil , for it was to prevent you from getting into a life of evil that God sent this suffering .

TLB	Job	38	15	and disturbed the haunts of wicked men , and stopped the arm raised to strike ?
TLB	Job	38	16	“ Have you explored the springs from which the seas come , or walked in the sources of their depths ? 17-18 Has the location of the gates of death been revealed to you ? Do you realize the extent of the earth ? Tell me about it if you know !
TLB	Job	38	19	Where does the light come from , and how do you get there ? Or tell me about the darkness . Where does it come from ?
TLB	Job	38	20	Can you find its boundaries , or go to its source ?
TLB	Job	38	21	But of course you know all this ! For you were born before it was all created , and you are so very experienced ! 22-23 “ Have you visited the treasuries of the snow , or seen where hail is made and stored ? For I have reserved it for the time when I will need it in war .
TLB	Job	38	24	Where is the path to the distribution point of light ? Where is the home of the east wind ? 25-27 Who dug the valleys for the torrents of rain ? Who laid out the path for the lightning , causing the rain to fall upon the barren deserts , so that the parched and barren ground is satisfied with water and tender grass springs up ?
TLB	Job	38	28	“ Has the rain a father ? Where does dew come from ?
TLB	Job	38	29	Who is the mother of the ice and frost ?
TLB	Job	38	30	For the water changes and turns to ice as hard as rock .
TLB	Job	38	31	“ Can you hold back the stars ? Can you restrain Orion or Pleiades ?
TLB	Job	38	32	Can you ensure the proper sequence of the seasons , or guide the constellation of the Bear with her satellites across the heavens ?
TLB	Job	38	33	Do you know the laws of the universe and how the heavens influence the earth ?
TLB	Job	38	34	Can you shout to the clouds and make it rain ?
TLB	Job	38	35	Can you make lightning appear and cause it to strike as you direct it ?
TLB	Job	38	36	“ Who gives intuition and instinct ? [ a ] 37-38 Who is wise enough to number all the clouds ? Who can tilt the water jars of heaven , when everything is dust and clods ? 39-40 Can you stalk prey like a lioness , to satisfy the young lions ’ appetites as they lie in their dens or lie in wait in the jungle ?

TLB	Job	39	39	“ Do you know how mountain goats give birth ? Have you ever seen them giving birth to their young ? 2-3 Do you know how many months of pregnancy they have before they bow themselves to give birth to their young and carry their burden no longer ?
TLB	Job	39	4	Their young grow up in the open field , then leave their parents and return to them no more .
TLB	Job	39	5	“ Who makes the wild donkeys wild ?
TLB	Job	39	6	I have placed them in the wilderness and given them salt plains to live in .
TLB	Job	39	7	For they hate the noise of the city and want no drivers shouting at them !
TLB	Job	39	8	The mountain ranges are their pastureland ; there they search for every blade of grass .
TLB	Job	39	9	“ Will the wild ox be your happy servant ? Will he stay beside your feeding crib ?
TLB	Job	39	10	Can you use a wild ox to plow with ? Will he pull the harrow for you ?
TLB	Job	39	11	Because he is so strong , will you trust him ? Will you let him decide where to work ?
TLB	Job	39	12	Can you send him out to bring in the grain from the threshing floor ?
TLB	Job	39	13	“ The ostrich flaps her wings grandly but has no true motherly love .
TLB	Job	39	14	She lays her eggs on top of the earth , to warm them in the dust .
TLB	Job	39	15	She forgets that someone may step on them and crush them , or the wild animals destroy them .
TLB	Job	39	16	She ignores her young as though they weren ’ t her own and is unconcerned though they die ,
TLB	Job	39	17	for God has deprived her of wisdom .
TLB	Job	39	18	But whenever she jumps up to run , she passes the swiftest horse with its rider .
TLB	Job	39	19	“ Have you given the horse strength or clothed his neck with a quivering mane ?
TLB	Job	39	20	Have you made him able to leap forward like a locust ? His majestic snorting is something to hear ! 21-23 He paws the earth and rejoices in his strength , and when he goes to war , he is unafraid and does not run away though the arrows rattle against him , or the flashing spear and javelin .
TLB	Job	39	24	Fiercely he paws the ground and rushes forward into battle when the trumpet blows .
TLB	Job	39	25	At the sound of the bugle he shouts , ‘ Aha ! ’ He smells the battle when far away . He rejoices at the shouts of battle and the roar of the captain ’ s commands .
TLB	Job	39	26	“ Do you know how a hawk soars and spreads her wings to the south ?
TLB	Job	39	27	Is it at your command that the eagle rises high upon the cliffs to make her nest ?
TLB	Job	39	28	She lives upon the cliffs , making her home in her mountain fortress .
TLB	Job	39	29	From there she spies her prey , from a very great distance .
TLB	Job	39	30	Her nestlings gulp down blood , for she goes wherever the slain are. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Job	40	40	The Lord went on :
TLB	Job	40	2	“ Do you still want to argue with the Almighty ? Or will you yield ? Do you—God ’ s critic—have the answers ? ”
TLB	Job	40	3	Then Job replied to God :
TLB	Job	40	4	“ I am nothing—how could I ever find the answers ? I lay my hand upon my mouth in silence .
TLB	Job	40	5	I have said too much already. ”
TLB	Job	40	6	Then the Lord spoke to Job again from the whirlwind :
TLB	Job	40	7	“ Stand up like a man and brace yourself for battle . Let me ask you a question , and give me the answer .
TLB	Job	40	8	Are you going to discredit my justice and condemn me so that you can say you are right ?
TLB	Job	40	9	Are you as strong as God , and can you shout as loudly as he ?
TLB	Job	40	10	All right then , put on your robes of state , your majesty and splendor .
TLB	Job	40	11	Give vent to your anger . Let it overflow against the proud .
TLB	Job	40	12	Humiliate the haughty with a glance ; tread down the wicked where they stand .
TLB	Job	40	13	Knock them into the dust , stone-faced in death .
TLB	Job	40	14	If you can do that , then I ’ ll agree with you that your own strength can save you .
TLB	Job	40	15	“ Take a look at the hippopotamus ! [ a ] I made him , too , just as I made you ! He eats grass like an ox .
TLB	Job	40	16	See his powerful loins and the muscles of his belly .
TLB	Job	40	17	His tail is as straight as a cedar . The sinews of his thighs are tightly knit together .
TLB	Job	40	18	His vertebrae lie straight as a tube of brass . His ribs are like iron bars .
TLB	Job	40	19	How ferocious he is among all of God ’ s creation , so let whoever hopes to master him bring a sharp sword !
TLB	Job	40	20	The mountains offer their best food to him—the other wild animals on which he preys .
TLB	Job	40	21	He lies down under the lotus plants , hidden by the reeds ,
TLB	Job	40	22	covered by their shade among the willows there beside the stream .
TLB	Job	40	23	He is not disturbed by raging rivers , not even when the swelling Jordan rushes down upon him .

TLB	Job	41	2	Can you tie him with a rope through the nose , or pierce his jaw with a spike ?
TLB	Job	41	3	Will he beg you to desist or try to flatter you from your intentions ?
TLB	Job	41	4	Will he agree to let you make him your slave for life ?
TLB	Job	41	5	Can you make a pet of him like a bird , or give him to your little girls to play with ?
TLB	Job	41	6	Do fishing partners sell him to the fishmongers ?
TLB	Job	41	7	Will his hide be hurt by darts , or his head with a harpoon ?
TLB	Job	41	8	“ If you lay your hands upon him , you will long remember the battle that ensues and you will never try it again !
TLB	Job	41	9	No , it ’ s useless to try to capture him . It is frightening even to think about it !
TLB	Job	41	10	No one dares to stir him up , let alone try to conquer him . And if no one can stand before him , who can stand before me ?
TLB	Job	41	11	I owe no one anything . Everything under the heaven is mine .
TLB	Job	41	12	“ I should mention , too , the tremendous strength in his limbs and throughout his enormous frame .
TLB	Job	41	13	Who can penetrate his hide , or who dares come within reach of his jaws ?
TLB	Job	41	14	For his teeth are terrible . 15-17 His overlapping scales are his pride , making a tight seal so no air can get between them , and nothing can penetrate .
TLB	Job	41	18	“ When he sneezes , the sunlight sparkles like lightning across the vapor droplets . His eyes glow like sparks .
TLB	Job	41	19	Fire leaps from his mouth .
TLB	Job	41	20	Smoke flows from his nostrils , like steam from a boiling pot that is fired by dry rushes .
TLB	Job	41	21	Yes , his breath would kindle coals—flames leap from his mouth .
TLB	Job	41	22	“ The tremendous strength in his neck strikes terror wherever he goes .
TLB	Job	41	23	His flesh is hard and firm , not soft and fat .
TLB	Job	41	24	His heart is hard as rock , just like a millstone .
TLB	Job	41	25	When he stands up , the strongest are afraid . Terror grips them .
TLB	Job	41	26	No sword can stop him , nor spear nor dart nor pointed shaft . 27-28 Iron is nothing but straw to him , and brass is rotten wood . Arrows can not make him flee . Sling stones are as ineffective as straw .
TLB	Job	41	29	Clubs do no good , and he laughs at the javelins hurled at him .
TLB	Job	41	30	His belly is covered with scales as sharp as shards ; they tear up the ground as he drags through the mud . 31-32 “ He makes the water boil with his commotion . He churns the depths . He leaves a shining wake of froth behind him . One would think the sea was made of frost !
TLB	Job	41	33	There is nothing else so fearless anywhere on earth .

TLB	Job	42	42	Then Job replied to God :
TLB	Job	42	2	“ I know that you can do anything and that no one can stop you .
TLB	Job	42	3	You ask who it is who has so foolishly denied your providence . It is I. I was talking about things I knew nothing about and did not understand , things far too wonderful for me .
TLB	Job	42	4	“ You said , [ a ] ‘ Listen and I will speak ! Let me put the questions to you ! See if you can answer them ! ’
TLB	Job	42	5	“ But now I say , [ b ] ‘ I had heard about you before , but now I have seen you ,
TLB	Job	42	6	and I loathe myself and repent in dust and ashes. ’ ”
TLB	Job	42	7	After the Lord had finished speaking with Job , he said to Eliphaz the Temanite : “ I am angry with you and with your two friends , for you have not been right in what you have said about me , as my servant Job was .
TLB	Job	42	8	Now take seven young bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job and offer a burnt offering for yourselves ; and my servant Job will pray for you , and I will accept his prayer on your behalf , and won ’ t destroy you as I should because of your sin , your failure to speak rightly concerning my servant Job. ”
TLB	Job	42	9	So Eliphaz the Temanite , and Bildad the Shuhite , and Zophar the Naamathite did as the Lord commanded them , and the Lord accepted Job ’ s prayer on their behalf .
TLB	Job	42	10	Then , when Job prayed for his friends , the Lord restored his wealth and happiness ! In fact , the Lord gave him twice as much as before !
TLB	Job	42	11	Then all of his brothers , sisters , and former friends arrived and feasted with him in his home , consoling him for all his sorrow and comforting him because of all the trials the Lord had brought upon him . And each of them brought him a gift of money and a gold ring .
TLB	Job	42	12	So the Lord blessed Job at the end of his life more than at the beginning . For now he had 14,000 sheep , 6,000 camels , 1,000 teams of oxen , and 1,000 female donkeys . 13-14 God also gave him seven more sons and three more daughters . [ c ] These were the names of his daughters : Jemima , Kezia , Keren .
TLB	Job	42	15	And in all the land there were no other girls as lovely as the daughters of Job ; and their father put them into his will along with their brothers .
TLB	Job	42	16	Job lived
TLB	Job	42	140	years after that , living to see his grandchildren and great-grandchildren too .

TLB	Psalms	17	2	Publicly acquit me , Lord , for you are always fair .

TLB	Psalms	18	18	On the day when I was weakest , they attacked . But the Lord held me steady .
TLB	Psalms	18	2	The Lord is my fort where I can enter and be safe ; no one can follow me in and slay me . He is a rugged mountain where I hide ; he is my Savior , a rock where none can reach me , and a tower of safety . He is my shield . He is like the strong horn of a mighty fighting bull .
TLB	Psalms	18	3	All I need to do is cry to him—oh , praise the Lord—and I am saved from all my enemies !
TLB	Psalms	18	4	Death bound me with chains , and the floods of ungodliness mounted a massive attack against me .
TLB	Psalms	18	5	Trapped and helpless , I struggled against the ropes that drew me on to death .
TLB	Psalms	18	6	In my distress I screamed to the Lord for his help . And he heard me from heaven ; [ a ] my cry reached his ears .
TLB	Psalms	18	7	Then the earth rocked and reeled , and mountains shook and trembled . How they quaked ! For he was angry .
TLB	Psalms	18	8	Fierce flames leaped from his mouth , setting fire to the earth ; [ b ] smoke blew from his nostrils .
TLB	Psalms	18	9	He bent the heavens down and came to my defense ; [ c ] thick darkness was beneath his feet .
TLB	Psalms	18	10	Mounted on a mighty angel , [ d ] he sped swiftly to my aid with wings of wind .
TLB	Psalms	18	11	He enshrouded himself with darkness , veiling his approach with dense clouds dark as murky waters .
TLB	Psalms	18	12	Suddenly the brilliance of his presence broke through the clouds with lightning [ e ] and a mighty storm of hail .
TLB	Psalms	18	13	The Lord thundered in the heavens ; the God above all gods has spoken—oh , the hailstones ; oh , the fire !
TLB	Psalms	18	14	He flashed his fearful arrows of lightning and routed all my enemies . See how they run !
TLB	Psalms	18	15	Then at your command , O Lord , the sea receded from the shore . At the blast of your breath the depths were laid bare .
TLB	Psalms	18	16	He reached down from heaven and took me and drew me out of my great trials . He rescued me from deep waters .
TLB	Psalms	18	17	He delivered me from my strong enemy , from those who hated me—I who was helpless in their hands .
TLB	Psalms	18	19	He led me to a place of safety , for he delights in me .
TLB	Psalms	18	20	The Lord rewarded me for doing right and being pure .
TLB	Psalms	18	21	For I have followed his commands and have not sinned by turning back from following him .
TLB	Psalms	18	22	I kept close watch on all his laws ; I did not refuse a single one .
TLB	Psalms	18	23	I did my best to keep them all , holding myself back from doing wrong .
TLB	Psalms	18	24	And so the Lord has paid me with his blessings , for I have done what is right , and I am pure of heart . This he knows , for he watches my every step .
TLB	Psalms	18	25	Lord , how merciful you are to those who are merciful . And you do not punish those who run from evil . [ f ]
TLB	Psalms	18	26	You give blessings to the pure but pain to those who leave your paths .
TLB	Psalms	18	27	You deliver the humble but condemn the proud and haughty ones .
TLB	Psalms	18	28	You have turned on my light ! The Lord my God has made my darkness turn to light .
TLB	Psalms	18	29	Now in your strength I can scale any wall , attack any troop .
TLB	Psalms	18	30	What a God he is ! How perfect in every way ! All his promises prove true . He is a shield for everyone who hides behind him .
TLB	Psalms	18	31	For who is God except our Lord ? Who but he is as a rock ?
TLB	Psalms	18	32	He fills me with strength and protects me wherever I go .
TLB	Psalms	18	33	He gives me the surefootedness of a mountain goat upon the crags . He leads me safely along the top of the cliffs .
TLB	Psalms	18	34	He prepares me for battle and gives me strength to draw an iron bow ! [ g ]
TLB	Psalms	18	35	You have given me your salvation as my shield . Your right hand , O Lord , supports me ; your gentleness has made me great .
TLB	Psalms	18	36	You have made wide steps beneath my feet so that I need never slip .
TLB	Psalms	18	37	I chased my enemies ; I caught up with them and did not turn back until all were conquered .
TLB	Psalms	18	38	I pinned them to the ground ; all were helpless before me . I placed my feet upon their necks .
TLB	Psalms	18	39	For you have armed me with strong armor for the battle . My enemies quail before me and fall defeated at my feet .
TLB	Psalms	18	40	You made them turn and run ; I destroyed all who hated me .
TLB	Psalms	18	41	They shouted for help , but no one dared to rescue them ; they cried to the Lord , but he refused to answer them .
TLB	Psalms	18	42	So I crushed them fine as dust and cast them to the wind . I threw them away like sweepings from the floor . 43-45 You gave me victory in every battle . The nations came and served me . Even those I didn ’ t know before come now and bow before me . Foreigners who have never seen me submit instantly . They come trembling from their strongholds .
TLB	Psalms	18	46	God is alive ! Praise him who is the great rock of protection .
TLB	Psalms	18	47	He is the God who pays back those who harm me and subdues the nations before me .
TLB	Psalms	18	48	He rescues me from my enemies ; he holds me safely out of their reach and saves me from these powerful opponents .

TLB	Psalms	36	36	Sin lurks deep in the hearts of the wicked , forever urging them on to evil deeds . They have no fear of God to hold them back .
TLB	Psalms	36	2	Instead , in their conceit , they think they can hide their evil deeds and not get caught .
TLB	Psalms	36	3	Everything they say is crooked and deceitful ; they are no longer wise and good .
TLB	Psalms	36	4	They lie awake at night to hatch their evil plots instead of planning how to keep away from wrong .
TLB	Psalms	36	5	Your steadfast love , O Lord , is as great as all the heavens . Your faithfulness reaches beyond the clouds .

TLB	Psalms	37	37	But the good man—what a different story ! For the good man—the blameless , the upright , the man of peace—he has a wonderful future ahead of him . For him there is a happy ending .

TLB	Psalms	37	14	Evil men take aim to slay the poor ; they are ready to butcher those who do right .
TLB	Psalms	37	15	But their swords will be plunged into their own hearts , and all their weapons will be broken .
TLB	Psalms	37	16	It is better to have little and be godly than to own an evil man ’ s wealth ;
TLB	Psalms	37	17	for the strength of evil men shall be broken , but the Lord takes care of those he has forgiven . [ a ]

TLB	Psalms	37	25	I have been young and now I am old . And in all my years I have never seen the Lord forsake a man who loves him ; nor have I seen the children of the godly go hungry .
TLB	Psalms	37	26	Instead , the godly are able to be generous with their gifts and loans to others , and their children are a blessing .
TLB	Psalms	37	27	So if you want an eternal home , leave your evil , low-down ways and live good lives .
TLB	Psalms	37	28	For the Lord loves justice and fairness ; he will never abandon his people . They will be kept safe forever ; but all who love wickedness shall perish .
TLB	Psalms	37	29	The godly shall be firmly planted in the land and live there forever . 30-31 The godly man is a good counselor because he is just and fair and knows right from wrong .
TLB	Psalms	37	32	Evil men spy on the godly , waiting for an excuse to accuse them and then demanding their death .
TLB	Psalms	37	33	But the Lord will not let these evil men succeed , nor let the godly be condemned when they are brought before the judge .
TLB	Psalms	37	34	Don ’ t be impatient for the Lord to act ! Keep traveling steadily along his pathway and in due season he will honor you with every blessing , [ c ] and you will see the wicked destroyed . 35-36 I myself have seen it happen : a proud and evil man , towering like a cedar of Lebanon , but when I looked again , he was gone !

TLB	Psalms	38	38	O Lord , don ’ t punish me while you are angry !
TLB	Psalms	38	2	Your arrows have struck deep ; your blows are crushing me . 3-4 Because of your anger , my body is sick , my health is broken beneath my sins . They are like a flood , higher than my head ; they are a burden too heavy to bear . 5-6 My wounds are festering and full of pus . Because of my sins , I am bent and racked with pain . My days are filled with anguish .
TLB	Psalms	38	7	My loins burn with inflammation , [ a ] and my whole body is diseased .
TLB	Psalms	38	8	I am exhausted and crushed ; I groan in despair . [ b ]

TLB	Psalms	38	10	My heart beats wildly , my strength fails , and I am going blind .
TLB	Psalms	38	11	My loved ones and friends stay away , fearing my disease . Even my own family stands at a distance .
TLB	Psalms	38	12	Meanwhile my enemies are trying to kill me . They plot my ruin and spend all their waking hours planning treachery . 13-14 But I am deaf to all their threats ; I am silent before them as a man who can not speak . I have nothing to say .
TLB	Psalms	38	15	For I am waiting for you , O Lord my God . Come and protect me .
TLB	Psalms	38	16	Put an end to their arrogance , these who gloat when I am cast down !
TLB	Psalms	38	17	How constantly I find myself upon the verge of sin ; [ c ] this source of sorrow always stares me in the face .
TLB	Psalms	38	18	I confess my sins ; I am sorry for what I have done .
TLB	Psalms	38	19	But my enemies persecute with vigor and continue to hate me—though I have done nothing against them to deserve it .
TLB	Psalms	38	20	They repay me evil for good and hate me for standing for the right .

TLB	Psalms	39	39	I said to myself , I ’ m going to quit complaining ! I ’ ll keep quiet , especially when the ungodly are around me . 2-3 But as I stood there silently the turmoil within me grew to the bursting point . The more I mused , the hotter the fires inside . Then at last I spoke and pled with God :
TLB	Psalms	39	4	Lord , help me to realize how brief my time on earth will be . Help me to know that I am here for but a moment more . 5-6 My life is no longer than my hand ! My whole lifetime is but a moment to you . Proud man ! Frail as breath ! A shadow ! And all his busy rushing ends in nothing . He heaps up riches for someone else to spend .
TLB	Psalms	39	7	And so , Lord , my only hope is in you .
TLB	Psalms	39	8	Save me from being overpowered by my sins , for even fools will mock me then .
TLB	Psalms	39	9	Lord , I am speechless before you . I will not open my mouth to speak one word of complaint , for my punishment is from you . [ a ]
TLB	Psalms	39	10	Lord , don ’ t hit me anymore—I am exhausted beneath your hand .
TLB	Psalms	39	11	When you punish a man for his sins , he is destroyed , for he is as fragile as a moth-infested cloth ; yes , man is frail as breath .
TLB	Psalms	39	12	Hear my prayer , O Lord ; listen to my cry ! Don ’ t sit back , unmindful of my tears . For I am your guest . I am a traveler passing through the earth , as all my fathers were .

TLB	Psalms	40	40	I waited patiently for God to help me ; then he listened and heard my cry .
TLB	Psalms	40	2	He lifted me out of the pit of despair , out from the bog and the mire , and set my feet on a hard , firm path , and steadied me as I walked along .

TLB	Psalms	40	12	Otherwise I perish , for problems far too big for me to solve are piled higher than my head . Meanwhile my sins , too many to count , have all caught up with me , and I am ashamed to look up . My heart quails within me .
TLB	Psalms	40	13	Please , Lord , rescue me ! Quick ! Come and help me ! 14-15 Confuse them ! Turn them around and send them sprawling—all these who are trying to destroy me . Disgrace these scoffers with their utter failure !

TLB	Psalms	44	44	1-2 O God , we have heard of the glorious miracles you did in the days of long ago . Our forefathers have told us how you drove the heathen nations from this land and gave it all to us , spreading Israel from one end of the country to the other .
TLB	Psalms	44	3	They did not conquer by their own strength and skill , but by your mighty power and because you smiled upon them and favored them .
TLB	Psalms	44	4	You are my King and my God . Decree victories for your people .
TLB	Psalms	44	5	For it is only by your power and through your name that we tread down our enemies ;
TLB	Psalms	44	6	I do not trust my weapons . They could never save me .
TLB	Psalms	44	7	Only you can give us the victory over those who hate us .
TLB	Psalms	44	8	My constant boast is God . I can never thank you enough !
TLB	Psalms	44	9	And yet for a time , O Lord , you have tossed us aside in dishonor and have not helped us in our battles .
TLB	Psalms	44	10	You have actually fought against us and defeated us before our foes . Our enemies have invaded our land and pillaged the countryside .
TLB	Psalms	44	11	You have treated us like sheep in a slaughter pen and scattered us among the nations .
TLB	Psalms	44	12	You sold us for a pittance . You valued us at nothing at all .
TLB	Psalms	44	13	The neighboring nations mock and laugh at us because of all the evil you have sent .
TLB	Psalms	44	14	You have made the word Jew a byword of contempt and shame among the nations , disliked by all . 15-16 I am constantly despised , mocked , taunted , and cursed by my vengeful enemies .
TLB	Psalms	44	17	And all this has happened , Lord , despite our loyalty to you . We have not violated your covenant .
TLB	Psalms	44	18	Our hearts have not deserted you ! We have not left your path by a single step .
TLB	Psalms	44	19	If we had , we could understand your punishing us in the barren wilderness and sending us into darkness and death .
TLB	Psalms	44	20	If we had turned away from worshiping our God and were worshiping idols ,
TLB	Psalms	44	21	would God not know it ? Yes , he knows the secrets of every heart .
TLB	Psalms	44	22	But that is not our case . For we are facing death threats constantly because of serving you ! We are like sheep awaiting slaughter .
TLB	Psalms	44	23	Waken ! Rouse yourself ! Don ’ t sleep , O Lord ! Are we cast off forever ?
TLB	Psalms	44	24	Why do you look the other way ? Why do you ignore our sorrows and oppression ?

TLB	Psalms	48	3	God himself is the defender of Jerusalem . [ b ]
TLB	Psalms	48	4	The kings of the earth have arrived together to inspect the city .
TLB	Psalms	48	5	They marvel at the sight and hurry home again ,
TLB	Psalms	48	6	afraid of what they have seen ; they are filled with panic like a woman in travail !
TLB	Psalms	48	7	For God destroys the mightiest warships with a breath of wind .

TLB	Psalms	49	49	1-2 Listen , everyone ! High and low , rich and poor , all around the world—listen to my words ,
TLB	Psalms	49	3	for they are wise and filled with insight .
TLB	Psalms	49	4	I will tell in song accompanied by harps the answer to one of life ’ s most perplexing problems :
TLB	Psalms	49	5	There is no need to fear when times of trouble come , even though surrounded by enemies !
TLB	Psalms	49	6	They trust in their wealth and boast about how rich they are ,
TLB	Psalms	49	7	yet not one of them , though rich as kings , can ransom his own brother from the penalty of sin ! For God ’ s forgiveness does not come that way . [ a ] 8-9 For a soul is far too precious to be ransomed by mere earthly wealth . There is not enough of it in all the earth to buy eternal life for just one soul , to keep it out of hell . [ b ]
TLB	Psalms	49	10	Rich man ! Proud man ! Wise man ! You must die like all the rest ! You have no greater lease on life than foolish , stupid men . You must leave your wealth to others .
TLB	Psalms	49	11	You name your estates after yourselves as though your lands could be forever yours and you could live on them eternally .
TLB	Psalms	49	12	But man with all his pomp must die like any animal .
TLB	Psalms	49	13	Such is the folly of these men , though after they die they will be quoted as having great wisdom .
TLB	Psalms	49	14	Death is the shepherd of all mankind . And “ in the morning ” those who are evil will be the slaves of those who are good . For the power of their wealth is gone when they die ; [ c ] they can not take it with them .
TLB	Psalms	49	15	But as for me , God will redeem my soul from the power of death , for he will receive me .
TLB	Psalms	49	16	So do not be dismayed when evil men grow rich and build their lovely homes .
TLB	Psalms	49	17	For when they die , they carry nothing with them ! Their honors will not follow them .
TLB	Psalms	49	18	Though a man calls himself happy all through his life—and the world loudly applauds success—
TLB	Psalms	49	19	yet in the end he dies like everyone else and enters eternal darkness .

TLB	Psalms	50	12	If I were hungry , I would not mention it to you—for all the world is mine and everything in it .
TLB	Psalms	50	13	No , I don ’ t need your sacrifices of flesh and blood . 14-15 What I want from you is your true thanks ; I want your promises fulfilled . I want you to trust me in your times of trouble , so I can rescue you and you can give me glory .
TLB	Psalms	50	16	But God says to evil men : Recite my laws no longer and stop claiming my promises ,

TLB	Psalms	50	19	You curse and lie , and vile language streams from your mouths .
TLB	Psalms	50	20	You slander your own brother .
TLB	Psalms	50	21	I remained silent—you thought I didn ’ t care—but now your time of punishment has come , and I list all the above charges against you .
TLB	Psalms	50	22	This is the last chance for all of you who have forgotten God , before I tear you apart—and no one can help you then .
TLB	Psalms	50	23	But true praise is a worthy sacrifice ; this really honors me . Those who walk my paths will receive salvation from the Lord .

TLB	Psalms	51	16	You don ’ t want penance ; [ c ] if you did , how gladly I would do it ! You aren ’ t interested in offerings burned before you on the altar .

TLB	Psalms	73	2	But as for me , I came so close to the edge of the cliff ! My feet were slipping and I was almost gone .
TLB	Psalms	73	3	For I was envious of the prosperity of the proud and wicked .
TLB	Psalms	73	4	Yes , all through life their road is smooth ! [ a ] They grow sleek and fat .
TLB	Psalms	73	5	They aren ’ t always in trouble and plagued with problems like everyone else ,
TLB	Psalms	73	6	so their pride sparkles like a jeweled necklace , and their clothing is woven of cruelty !
TLB	Psalms	73	7	These fat cats have everything their hearts could ever wish for !
TLB	Psalms	73	8	They scoff at God and threaten his people . How proudly they speak !
TLB	Psalms	73	9	They boast against the very heavens , and their words strut through the earth .
TLB	Psalms	73	10	And so God ’ s people are dismayed and confused and drink it all in .
TLB	Psalms	73	11	“ Does God realize what is going on ? ” they ask .
TLB	Psalms	73	12	“ Look at these men of arrogance ; they never have to lift a finger—theirs is a life of ease ; and all the time their riches multiply. ”
TLB	Psalms	73	13	Have I been wasting my time ? Why take the trouble to be pure ?
TLB	Psalms	73	14	All I get out of it is trouble and woe—every day and all day long !
TLB	Psalms	73	15	If I had really said that , I would have been a traitor to your people .
TLB	Psalms	73	16	Yet it is so hard to explain it—this prosperity of those who hate the Lord .
TLB	Psalms	73	17	Then one day I went into God ’ s sanctuary to meditate and thought about the future of these evil men .
TLB	Psalms	73	18	What a slippery path they are on—suddenly God will send them sliding over the edge of the cliff and down to their destruction :
TLB	Psalms	73	19	an instant end to all their happiness , an eternity of terror .
TLB	Psalms	73	20	Their present life is only a dream ! They will awaken to the truth as one awakens from a dream of things that never really were !
TLB	Psalms	73	21	When I saw this , what turmoil filled my heart !
TLB	Psalms	73	22	I saw myself so stupid and so ignorant ; I must seem like an animal to you , O God .
TLB	Psalms	73	23	But even so , you love me ! You are holding my right hand !
TLB	Psalms	73	24	You will keep on guiding me all my life with your wisdom and counsel , and afterwards receive me into the glories of heaven ! [ b ]
TLB	Psalms	73	25	Whom have I in heaven but you ? And I desire no one on earth as much as you !
TLB	Psalms	73	26	My health fails ; my spirits droop , yet God remains ! He is the strength of my heart ; he is mine forever !
TLB	Psalms	73	27	But those refusing to worship God will perish , for he destroys those serving other gods .
TLB	Psalms	73	28	But as for me , I get as close to him as I can ! I have chosen him , and I will tell everyone about the wonderful ways he rescues me .

TLB	Psalms	74	74	O God , why have you cast us away forever ? Why is your anger hot against us—the sheep of your own pasture ?
TLB	Psalms	74	2	Remember that we are your people—the ones you chose in ancient times from slavery and made the choicest of your possessions . You chose Jerusalem [ a ] as your home on earth !
TLB	Psalms	74	3	Walk through the awful ruins of the city and see what the enemy has done to your sanctuary .
TLB	Psalms	74	4	There they shouted their battle cry and erected their idols to flaunt their victory . 5-6 Everything lies in shambles like a forest chopped to the ground . They came with their axes and sledgehammers and smashed and chopped the carved paneling ;
TLB	Psalms	74	7	they set the sanctuary on fire , and razed it to the ground—your sanctuary , Lord .
TLB	Psalms	74	8	“ Let ’ s wipe out every trace of God , ” they said , and went through the entire country burning down the assembly places where we worshiped you . 9-10 There is nothing left to show that we are your people . The prophets are gone , and who can say when it all will end ? How long , O God , will you allow our enemies to dishonor your name ? Will you let them get away with this forever ?
TLB	Psalms	74	11	Why do you delay ? Why hold back your power ? Unleash your fist and give them a final blow .
TLB	Psalms	74	12	God is my King from ages past ; you have been actively helping me everywhere throughout the land . 13-14 You divided the Red Sea with your strength ; you crushed the sea god ’ s heads ! You gave him to the desert tribes to eat !
TLB	Psalms	74	15	At your command the springs burst forth to give your people water ; and then you dried a path for them across the ever-flowing Jordan .
TLB	Psalms	74	16	Day and night alike belong to you ; you made the starlight and the sun .
TLB	Psalms	74	17	All nature is within your hands ; you make the summer and the winter too .
TLB	Psalms	74	18	Lord , see how these enemies scoff at you . O Jehovah , an arrogant nation has blasphemed your name .
TLB	Psalms	74	19	O Lord , save me ! Protect your turtledove from the hawks . [ b ] Save your beloved people from these beasts .
TLB	Psalms	74	20	Remember your promise ! For the land is full of darkness and cruel men .
TLB	Psalms	74	21	O Lord , don ’ t let your downtrodden people be constantly insulted . Give cause for these poor and needy ones to praise your name !
TLB	Psalms	74	22	Arise , O God , and state your case against our enemies . Remember the insults these rebels have hurled against you all day long .
TLB	Psalms	74	23	Don ’ t overlook the cursing of these enemies of yours ; it grows louder and louder . Footnotes - Psalm 74:2 Jerusalem , literally , “ Mount Zion. ” - Psalm 74:19 the hawks , literally , “ the wild beasts. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Psalms	75	3	Though the earth shakes and all its people live in turmoil , yet its pillars are firm , for I have set them in place ! ”
TLB	Psalms	75	4	I warned the proud to cease their arrogance ! I told the wicked to lower their insolent gaze [ a ]
TLB	Psalms	75	5	and to stop being stubborn and proud . 6-7 For promotion and power come from nowhere on earth , but only from God . He promotes one and deposes another .
TLB	Psalms	75	8	In Jehovah ’ s hand there is a cup of pale and sparkling wine . It is his judgment , poured out upon the wicked of the earth . They must drain that cup to the dregs .
TLB	Psalms	75	9	But as for me , I shall forever declare the praises of the God of Jacob .

TLB	Psalms	76	3	There he breaks the weapons of our enemies .
TLB	Psalms	76	4	The everlasting mountains can not compare with you in glory !
TLB	Psalms	76	5	The mightiest of our enemies are conquered . They lie before us in the sleep of death ; not one can lift a hand against us .
TLB	Psalms	76	6	When you rebuked them , God of Jacob , steeds and riders fell .
TLB	Psalms	76	7	No wonder you are greatly feared ! Who can stand before an angry God ?
TLB	Psalms	76	8	You pronounce sentence on them from heaven ; the earth trembles and stands silently before you .
TLB	Psalms	76	9	You stand up to punish the evildoers and to defend the meek of the earth .
TLB	Psalms	76	10	Man ’ s futile wrath will bring you glory . You will use it as an ornament !
TLB	Psalms	76	11	Fulfill all your vows that you have made to Jehovah your God . Let everyone bring him presents . He should be reverenced and feared ,

TLB	Psalms	77	77	I cry to the Lord ; I call and call to him . Oh , that he would listen .
TLB	Psalms	77	2	I am in deep trouble and I need his help so much . All night long I pray , lifting my hands to heaven , pleading . There can be no joy for me until he acts .
TLB	Psalms	77	3	I think of God and moan , overwhelmed with longing for his help .
TLB	Psalms	77	4	I can not sleep until you act . I am too distressed even to pray !
TLB	Psalms	77	5	I keep thinking of the good old days of the past , long since ended .
TLB	Psalms	77	6	Then my nights were filled with joyous songs . I search my soul and meditate upon the difference now .
TLB	Psalms	77	7	Has the Lord rejected me forever ? Will he never again be favorable ?
TLB	Psalms	77	8	Is his loving-kindness gone forever ? Has his promise failed ?
TLB	Psalms	77	9	Has he forgotten to be kind to one so undeserving ? Has he slammed the door in anger on his love ?
TLB	Psalms	77	10	And I said : This is my fate , that the blessings of God have changed to hate . [ a ]
TLB	Psalms	77	11	I recall the many miracles he did for me so long ago .
TLB	Psalms	77	12	Those wonderful deeds are constantly in my thoughts . I can not stop thinking about them .
TLB	Psalms	77	13	O God , your ways are holy . Where is there any other as mighty as you ?
TLB	Psalms	77	14	You are the God of miracles and wonders ! You still demonstrate your awesome power .
TLB	Psalms	77	15	You have redeemed us who are the sons of Jacob and of Joseph by your might .
TLB	Psalms	77	16	When the Red Sea saw you , how it feared ! It trembled to its depths !
TLB	Psalms	77	17	The clouds poured down their rain , the thunder rolled and crackled in the sky . Your lightning flashed .
TLB	Psalms	77	18	There was thunder in the whirlwind ; the lightning lighted up the world ! The earth trembled and shook .
TLB	Psalms	77	19	Your road led by a pathway through the sea—a pathway no one knew was there !
TLB	Psalms	77	20	You led your people along that road like a flock of sheep , with Moses and Aaron as their shepherds . Footnotes - Psalm 77:10 that the blessings of God have changed to hate , literally , “ that the right hand of the Most High has changed. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Psalms	78	78	O my people , listen to my teaching . Open your ears to what I am saying . 2-3 For I will show you lessons from our history , stories handed down to us from former generations .
TLB	Psalms	78	4	I will reveal these truths to you so that you can describe these glorious deeds of Jehovah to your children and tell them about the mighty miracles he did .
TLB	Psalms	78	5	For he gave his laws to Israel and commanded our fathers to teach them to their children ,
TLB	Psalms	78	6	so that they in turn could teach their children too . Thus his laws pass down from generation to generation .
TLB	Psalms	78	7	In this way each generation has been able to obey his laws and to set its hope anew on God and not forget his glorious miracles .
TLB	Psalms	78	8	Thus they did not need to be as their fathers were—stubborn , rebellious , unfaithful , refusing to give their hearts to God .
TLB	Psalms	78	9	The people of Ephraim , though fully armed , turned their backs and fled when the day of battle came
TLB	Psalms	78	10	because they didn ’ t obey his laws . They refused to follow his ways . 11-12 And they forgot about the wonderful miracles God had done for them and for their fathers in Egypt .
TLB	Psalms	78	13	For he divided the sea before them and led them through ! The water stood banked up along both sides of them !
TLB	Psalms	78	14	In the daytime he led them by a cloud , and at night by a pillar of fire .
TLB	Psalms	78	15	He split open the rocks in the wilderness to give them plenty of water , as though gushing from a spring .
TLB	Psalms	78	16	Streams poured from the rock , flowing like a river !
TLB	Psalms	78	17	Yet they kept on with their rebellion , sinning against the God who is above all gods .
TLB	Psalms	78	18	They murmured and complained , demanding other food than God was giving them . 19-20 They even spoke against God himself . “ Why can ’ t he give us decent food as well as water ? ” they grumbled .
TLB	Psalms	78	21	Jehovah heard them and was angry ; the fire of his wrath burned against Israel
TLB	Psalms	78	22	because they didn ’ t believe in God or trust in him to care for them ,
TLB	Psalms	78	23	even though he commanded the skies to open—he opened the windows of heaven—
TLB	Psalms	78	24	and rained down manna for their food . He gave them bread from heaven !
TLB	Psalms	78	25	They ate angels ’ food ! He gave them all they could hold .
TLB	Psalms	78	26	And he led forth the east wind and guided the south wind by his mighty power .
TLB	Psalms	78	27	He rained down birds as thick as dust , clouds of them like sands along the shore !
TLB	Psalms	78	28	He caused the birds to fall to the ground among the tents .
TLB	Psalms	78	29	The people ate their fill . He gave them what they asked for .
TLB	Psalms	78	30	But they had hardly finished eating , and the meat was yet in their mouths ,
TLB	Psalms	78	31	when the anger of the Lord rose against them and killed the finest of Israel ’ s young men .
TLB	Psalms	78	32	Yet even so the people kept on sinning and refused to believe in miracles .
TLB	Psalms	78	33	So he cut their lives short and gave them years of terror and disaster .
TLB	Psalms	78	34	Then at last , when he had ruined them , they walked awhile behind him ; how earnestly they turned around and followed him !
TLB	Psalms	78	35	Then they remembered that God was their Rock—that their Savior was the God above all gods .
TLB	Psalms	78	36	But it was only with their words that they followed him , not with their hearts ;
TLB	Psalms	78	37	their hearts were far away . They did not keep their promises .
TLB	Psalms	78	38	Yet he was merciful and forgave their sins and didn ’ t destroy them all . Many and many a time he held back his anger .
TLB	Psalms	78	39	For he remembered that they were merely mortal men , gone in a moment like a breath of wind .
TLB	Psalms	78	40	Oh , how often they rebelled against him in those desert years and grieved his heart .
TLB	Psalms	78	41	Again and again they turned away and tempted God to kill them , and limited the Holy One of Israel from giving them his blessings .
TLB	Psalms	78	42	They forgot his power and love and how he had rescued them from their enemies ;
TLB	Psalms	78	43	they forgot the plagues he sent upon the Egyptians in Tanis [ a ] —
TLB	Psalms	78	44	how he turned their rivers into blood so that no one could drink ,
TLB	Psalms	78	45	how he sent vast swarms of flies to fill the land , and how the frogs had covered all of Egypt !
TLB	Psalms	78	46	He gave their crops to caterpillars . Their harvest was consumed by locusts .
TLB	Psalms	78	47	He destroyed their grapevines and their sycamores with hail .
TLB	Psalms	78	48	Their cattle died in the fields , mortally wounded by huge hailstones from heaven . Their sheep were killed by lightning .
TLB	Psalms	78	49	He loosed on them the fierceness of his anger , sending sorrow and trouble . He dispatched against them a band of destroying angels .
TLB	Psalms	78	50	He gave free course to his anger and did not spare the Egyptians ’ lives , but handed them over to plagues and sickness .
TLB	Psalms	78	51	Then he killed the eldest son [ b ] in each Egyptian family—he who was the beginning of its strength and joy .
TLB	Psalms	78	52	But he led forth his own people like a flock , guiding them safely through the wilderness .
TLB	Psalms	78	53	He kept them safe , so they were not afraid . But the sea closed in upon their enemies and overwhelmed them .
TLB	Psalms	78	54	He brought them to the border of his land of blessing , to this land of hills he made for them .
TLB	Psalms	78	55	He drove out the nations occupying the land and gave each tribe of Israel its apportioned place as its home .
TLB	Psalms	78	56	Yet though he did all this for them , they still rebelled against the God above all gods and refused to follow his commands .
TLB	Psalms	78	57	They turned back from entering the Promised Land and disobeyed as their fathers had . Like a crooked arrow , they missed the target of God ’ s will .
TLB	Psalms	78	58	They made him angry by erecting idols and altars to other gods .
TLB	Psalms	78	59	When God saw their deeds , his wrath was strong and he despised his people .
TLB	Psalms	78	60	Then he abandoned his Tabernacle at Shiloh , where he had lived among mankind ,
TLB	Psalms	78	61	and allowed his Ark to be captured ; he surrendered his glory into enemy hands .
TLB	Psalms	78	62	He caused his people to be butchered because his anger was intense .
TLB	Psalms	78	63	Their young men were killed by fire , and their girls died before they were old enough to sing their wedding songs .
TLB	Psalms	78	64	The priests were slaughtered , and their widows died before they could even begin their lament .
TLB	Psalms	78	65	Then the Lord rose up as though awakening from sleep , and like a mighty man aroused by wine ,
TLB	Psalms	78	66	he routed his enemies ; he drove them back and sent them to eternal shame .
TLB	Psalms	78	67	But he rejected Joseph ’ s family , the tribe of Ephraim ,
TLB	Psalms	78	68	and chose the tribe of Judah—and Mount Zion , which he loved .
TLB	Psalms	78	69	There he built his towering temple , solid and enduring as the heavens and the earth .
TLB	Psalms	78	70	He chose his servant David , taking him from feeding sheep 71-72 and from following the ewes with lambs ; God presented David to his people as their shepherd , and he cared for them with a true heart and skillful hands .

TLB	Psalms	79	79	O God , your land has been conquered by the heathen nations . Your Temple is defiled , and Jerusalem is a heap of ruins .
TLB	Psalms	79	2	The bodies of your people lie exposed—food for birds and animals .
TLB	Psalms	79	3	The enemy has butchered the entire population of Jerusalem ; blood has flowed like water . No one is left even to bury them .
TLB	Psalms	79	4	The nations all around us scoff . They heap contempt on us .
TLB	Psalms	79	5	O Jehovah , how long will you be angry with us ? Forever ? Will your jealousy burn till every hope is gone ?
TLB	Psalms	79	6	Pour out your wrath upon the godless nations—not on us—on kingdoms that refuse to pray , that will not call upon your name !
TLB	Psalms	79	7	For they have destroyed your people Israel , invading every home .
TLB	Psalms	79	8	Oh , do not hold us guilty for our former sins ! Let your tenderhearted mercies meet our needs , for we are brought low to the dust .

TLB	Psalms	89	8	O Jehovah , Commander of the heavenly armies , where is there any other Mighty One like you ? Faithfulness is your very character .
TLB	Psalms	89	9	You rule the oceans when their waves arise in fearful storms ; you speak , and they lie still .

TLB	Psalms	89	18	Yes , our protection is from the Lord himself and he , the Holy One of Israel , has given us our king .
TLB	Psalms	89	19	In a vision you spoke to your prophet [ f ] and said , “ I have chosen a splendid young man from the common people to be the king—
TLB	Psalms	89	20	he is my servant David ! I have anointed him with my holy oil .
TLB	Psalms	89	21	I will steady him and make him strong .
TLB	Psalms	89	22	His enemies shall not outwit him , nor shall the wicked overpower him .
TLB	Psalms	89	23	I will beat down his adversaries before him and destroy those who hate him .
TLB	Psalms	89	24	I will protect and bless him constantly and surround him with my love ; he will be great because of me .
TLB	Psalms	89	25	He will hold sway from the Euphrates River to the Mediterranean Sea .
TLB	Psalms	89	26	And he will cry to me , ‘ You are my Father , my God , and my Rock of Salvation. ’
TLB	Psalms	89	27	“ I will treat him as my firstborn son and make him the mightiest king in all the earth .
TLB	Psalms	89	28	I will love him forever and be kind to him always ; my covenant with him will never end .

TLB	Psalms	89	33	but I will never completely take away my loving-kindness from them , nor let my promise fail .
TLB	Psalms	89	34	No , I will not break my covenant ; I will not take back one word of what I said . 35-36 For I have sworn to David ( and a holy God can never lie ) that his dynasty will go on forever , and his throne will continue to the end of time . [ g ]
TLB	Psalms	89	37	It shall be eternal as the moon , my faithful witness in the sky ! ”
TLB	Psalms	89	38	Then why cast me off , rejected ? Why be so angry with the one you chose as king ?
TLB	Psalms	89	39	Have you renounced your covenant with him ? For you have thrown his crown in the dust .
TLB	Psalms	89	40	You have broken down the walls protecting him and laid in ruins every fort defending him .
TLB	Psalms	89	41	Everyone who comes along has robbed him while his neighbors mock .
TLB	Psalms	89	42	You have strengthened his enemies against him and made them rejoice .
TLB	Psalms	89	43	You have struck down his sword and refused to help him in battle .
TLB	Psalms	89	44	You have ended his splendor and overturned his throne .
TLB	Psalms	89	45	You have made him old before his time and publicly disgraced him .
TLB	Psalms	89	46	O Jehovah , how long will this go on ? Will you hide yourself from me forever ? How long will your wrath burn like fire ?
TLB	Psalms	89	47	Oh , remember how short you have made man ’ s lifespan . Is it an empty , futile life you give the sons of men ?
TLB	Psalms	89	48	No man can live forever . All will die . Who can rescue his life from the power of the grave ?
TLB	Psalms	89	49	Lord , where is the love you used to have for me ? Where is your kindness that you promised to David with a faithful pledge ?
TLB	Psalms	89	50	Lord , see how all the people are despising me .

TLB	Psalms	102	102	A prayer when overwhelmed with trouble . Lord , hear my prayer ! Listen to my plea !
TLB	Psalms	102	2	Don ’ t turn away from me in this time of my distress . Bend down your ear and give me speedy answers , 3-4 for my days disappear like smoke . My health is broken , and my heart is sick ; it is trampled like grass and is withered . My food is tasteless , and I have lost my appetite .
TLB	Psalms	102	5	I am reduced to skin and bones because of all my groaning and despair .
TLB	Psalms	102	6	I am like a vulture in a far-off wilderness or like an owl alone in the desert .
TLB	Psalms	102	7	I lie awake , lonely as a solitary sparrow on the roof .
TLB	Psalms	102	8	My enemies taunt me day after day and curse at me . 9-10 I eat ashes instead of bread . My tears run down into my drink because of your anger against me , because of your wrath . For you have rejected me and thrown me out .
TLB	Psalms	102	11	My life is passing swiftly as the evening shadows . I am withering like grass ,
TLB	Psalms	102	12	while you , Lord , are a famous King forever . Your fame will endure to every generation .
TLB	Psalms	102	13	I know that you will come and have mercy on Jerusalem—and now is the time to pity her—the time you promised help .
TLB	Psalms	102	14	For your people love every stone in her walls and feel sympathy for every grain of dust in her streets .
TLB	Psalms	102	15	Now let the nations and their rulers tremble before the Lord , before his glory .
TLB	Psalms	102	16	For Jehovah will rebuild Jerusalem ! He will appear in his glory !
TLB	Psalms	102	17	He will listen to the prayers of the destitute , for he is never too busy to heed their requests .
TLB	Psalms	102	18	I am recording this so that future generations will also praise the Lord for all that he has done . And a people that shall be created shall praise the Lord .
TLB	Psalms	102	19	Tell them that God looked down from his temple in heaven
TLB	Psalms	102	20	and heard the groans of his people in slavery—they were children of death—and released them , 21-22 so that multitudes would stream to the Temple in Jerusalem to praise him , and his praises were sung throughout the city ; and many rulers throughout the earth came to worship him .
TLB	Psalms	102	23	He has cut me down in middle life , shortening my days .
TLB	Psalms	102	24	But I cried to him , “ O God , you live forever and forever ! Don ’ t let me die halfway through my years !
TLB	Psalms	102	25	In ages past you laid the foundations of the earth and made the heavens with your hands !
TLB	Psalms	102	26	They shall perish , but you go on forever . They will grow old like worn-out clothing , and you will change them like a man putting on a new shirt and throwing away the old one !
TLB	Psalms	102	27	But you yourself never grow old . You are forever , and your years never end .

TLB	Psalms	103	9	He never bears a grudge , nor remains angry forever .
TLB	Psalms	103	10	He has not punished us as we deserve for all our sins ,
TLB	Psalms	103	11	for his mercy toward those who fear and honor him is as great as the height of the heavens above the earth .

TLB	Psalms	103	13	He is like a father to us , tender and sympathetic to those who reverence him .
TLB	Psalms	103	14	For he knows we are but dust
TLB	Psalms	103	15	and that our days are few and brief , like grass , like flowers ,
TLB	Psalms	103	16	blown by the wind and gone forever . 17-18 But the loving-kindness of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting to those who reverence him ; his salvation is to children ’ s children of those who are faithful to his covenant and remember to obey him !

TLB	Psalms	104	104	1-2 I bless the Lord : O Lord my God , how great you are ! You are robed with honor and with majesty and light ! You stretched out the starry curtain of the heavens ,
TLB	Psalms	104	3	and hollowed out the surface of the earth to form the seas . The clouds are his chariots . He rides upon the wings of the wind .
TLB	Psalms	104	4	The angels [ a ] are his messengers—his servants of fire !
TLB	Psalms	104	5	You bound the world together so that it would never fall apart .
TLB	Psalms	104	6	You clothed the earth with floods of waters covering up the mountains . 7-8 You spoke , and at the sound of your shout the water collected into its vast ocean beds , and mountains rose and valleys sank to the levels you decreed .
TLB	Psalms	104	9	And then you set a boundary for the seas so that they would never again cover the earth .
TLB	Psalms	104	10	He placed springs in the valleys and streams that gush from the mountains .
TLB	Psalms	104	11	They give water for all the animals to drink . There the wild donkeys quench their thirst ,
TLB	Psalms	104	12	and the birds nest beside the streams and sing among the branches of the trees .
TLB	Psalms	104	13	He sends rain upon the mountains and fills the earth with fruit .
TLB	Psalms	104	14	The tender grass grows up at his command to feed the cattle , and there are fruit trees , vegetables , and grain for man to cultivate ,
TLB	Psalms	104	15	and wine to make him glad , and olive oil as lotion for his skin , and bread to give him strength .
TLB	Psalms	104	16	The Lord planted the cedars of Lebanon . They are tall and flourishing .
TLB	Psalms	104	17	There the birds make their nests , the storks in the firs .
TLB	Psalms	104	18	High in the mountains are pastures for the wild goats , and rock badgers burrow in among the rocks and find protection there .
TLB	Psalms	104	19	He assigned the moon to mark the months and the sun to mark the days .
TLB	Psalms	104	20	He sends the night and darkness , when all the forest folk come out .
TLB	Psalms	104	21	Then the young lions roar for their food , but they are dependent on the Lord .
TLB	Psalms	104	22	At dawn they slink back into their dens to rest ,
TLB	Psalms	104	23	and men go off to work until the evening shadows fall again .
TLB	Psalms	104	24	O Lord , what a variety you have made ! And in wisdom you have made them all ! The earth is full of your riches .
TLB	Psalms	104	25	There before me lies the mighty ocean , teeming with life of every kind , both great and small .
TLB	Psalms	104	26	And look ! See the ships ! And over there , the whale you made to play in the sea .
TLB	Psalms	104	27	Every one of these depends on you to give them daily food .
TLB	Psalms	104	28	You supply it , and they gather it . You open wide your hand to feed them , and they are satisfied with all your bountiful provision .
TLB	Psalms	104	29	But if you turn away from them , then all is lost . And when you gather up their breath , they die and turn again to dust .
TLB	Psalms	104	30	Then you send your Spirit , and new life is born [ b ] to replenish all the living of the earth .
TLB	Psalms	104	31	Praise God forever ! How he must rejoice in all his work !
TLB	Psalms	104	32	The earth trembles at his glance ; the mountains burst into flame at his touch .
TLB	Psalms	104	33	I will sing to the Lord as long as I live . I will praise God to my last breath !
TLB	Psalms	104	34	May he be pleased by all these thoughts about him , for he is the source of all my joy .

TLB	Psalms	105	105	Thank the Lord for all the glorious things he does ; proclaim them to the nations .
TLB	Psalms	105	2	Sing his praises and tell everyone about his miracles .
TLB	Psalms	105	3	Glory in the Lord ; O worshipers of God , rejoice .
TLB	Psalms	105	4	Search for him and for his strength , and keep on searching ! 5-6 Think of the mighty deeds he did for us , his chosen ones—descendants of God ’ s servant Abraham , and of Jacob . Remember how he destroyed our enemies .
TLB	Psalms	105	7	He is the Lord our God . His goodness [ a ] is seen everywhere throughout the land . 8-9 Though a thousand generations pass he never forgets his promise , his covenant with Abraham and Isaac 10-11 and confirmed with Jacob . This is his never-ending treaty with the people of Israel : “ I will give you the land of Canaan as your inheritance. ”
TLB	Psalms	105	12	He said this when they were but few in number , very few , and were only visitors in Canaan .
TLB	Psalms	105	13	Later they were dispersed among the nations and were driven from one kingdom to another ;
TLB	Psalms	105	14	but through it all he would not let one thing be done to them apart from his decision . [ b ] He destroyed many a king who tried !
TLB	Psalms	105	15	“ Touch not these chosen ones of mine , ” he warned , “ and do not hurt my prophets. ”
TLB	Psalms	105	16	He called for a famine on the land of Canaan , cutting off its food supply .
TLB	Psalms	105	17	Then he sent Joseph as a slave to Egypt to save his people from starvation .
TLB	Psalms	105	18	There in prison they hurt his feet with fetters and placed his neck in an iron collar
TLB	Psalms	105	19	until God ’ s time finally came—how God tested his patience !
TLB	Psalms	105	20	Then the king sent for him and set him free .
TLB	Psalms	105	21	He was put in charge of all the king ’ s possessions .
TLB	Psalms	105	22	At his pleasure he could imprison the king ’ s aides and teach the king ’ s advisors .
TLB	Psalms	105	23	Then Jacob ( Israel ) arrived in Egypt and lived there with his sons .
TLB	Psalms	105	24	In the years that followed , the people of Israel multiplied explosively until they were a greater nation than their rulers .
TLB	Psalms	105	25	At that point God turned the Egyptians against the Israelis ; they hated and enslaved them .
TLB	Psalms	105	26	But God sent Moses as his representative , and Aaron with him ,
TLB	Psalms	105	27	to call down miracles of terror upon the land of Egypt .
TLB	Psalms	105	28	They [ c ] followed his instructions . He sent thick darkness through the land
TLB	Psalms	105	29	and turned the nation ’ s water into blood , poisoning the fish .
TLB	Psalms	105	30	Then frogs invaded in enormous numbers ; they were found even in the king ’ s private rooms .
TLB	Psalms	105	31	When Moses spoke , the flies and other insects swarmed in vast clouds from one end of Egypt to the other .
TLB	Psalms	105	32	Instead of rain he sent down murderous hail , and lightning flashes overwhelmed the nation .
TLB	Psalms	105	33	Their grapevines and fig trees were ruined ; all the trees lay broken on the ground .
TLB	Psalms	105	34	He spoke , and hordes of locusts came
TLB	Psalms	105	35	and ate up everything green , destroying all the crops .
TLB	Psalms	105	36	Then he killed the oldest child in each Egyptian home , their pride and joy—
TLB	Psalms	105	37	and brought his people safely out from Egypt , loaded with silver and gold ; there were no sick and feeble folk among them then .
TLB	Psalms	105	38	Egypt was glad when they were gone , for the dread of them was great .
TLB	Psalms	105	39	He spread out a cloud above them to shield them from the burning sun and gave them a pillar of flame at night to give them light .
TLB	Psalms	105	40	They asked for meat , and he sent them quail and gave them manna—bread from heaven .
TLB	Psalms	105	41	He opened up a rock , and water gushed out to form a river through the dry and barren land ;
TLB	Psalms	105	42	for he remembered his sacred promises to Abraham his servant .
TLB	Psalms	105	43	So he brought his chosen ones singing into the Promised Land .
TLB	Psalms	105	44	He gave them the lands of the Gentiles , complete with their growing crops ; they ate what others planted .
TLB	Psalms	105	45	This was done to make them faithful and obedient to his laws . Hallelujah !

TLB	Psalms	106	106	Hallelujah ! Thank you , Lord ! How good you are ! Your love for us continues on forever .
TLB	Psalms	106	2	Who can ever list the glorious miracles of God ? Who can ever praise him half enough ?
TLB	Psalms	106	3	Happiness comes to those who are fair to others and are always just and good .
TLB	Psalms	106	4	Remember me too , O Lord , while you are blessing and saving your people .
TLB	Psalms	106	5	Let me share in your chosen ones ’ prosperity and rejoice in all their joys , and receive the glory you give to them .
TLB	Psalms	106	6	Both we and our fathers have sinned so much .
TLB	Psalms	106	7	They weren ’ t impressed by the wonder of your miracles in Egypt and soon forgot your many acts of kindness to them . Instead they rebelled against you at the Red Sea .
TLB	Psalms	106	8	Even so you saved them—to defend the honor of your name and demonstrate your power to all the world .
TLB	Psalms	106	9	You commanded the Red Sea to divide , forming a dry road across its bottom . Yes , as dry as any desert !
TLB	Psalms	106	10	Thus you rescued them from their enemies .
TLB	Psalms	106	11	Then the water returned and covered the road and drowned their foes ; not one survived .
TLB	Psalms	106	12	Then at last his people believed him . Then they finally sang his praise .
TLB	Psalms	106	13	Yet how quickly they forgot again ! They wouldn ’ t wait for him to act
TLB	Psalms	106	14	but demanded better food , [ a ] testing God ’ s patience to the breaking point .
TLB	Psalms	106	15	So he gave them their demands but sent them leanness in their souls . [ b ]
TLB	Psalms	106	16	They were envious of Moses , yes , and Aaron too , the man anointed [ c ] by God as his priest .
TLB	Psalms	106	17	Because of this , the earth opened and swallowed Dathan , Abiram , and his friends ;
TLB	Psalms	106	18	and fire fell from heaven to consume these wicked men . 19-20 For they preferred a statue of an ox that eats grass to the glorious presence of God himself . 21-22 Thus they despised their Savior who had done such mighty miracles in Egypt and at the Red Sea .
TLB	Psalms	106	23	So the Lord declared he would destroy them . But Moses , his chosen one , stepped into the breach between the people and their God and begged him to turn from his wrath and not destroy them .
TLB	Psalms	106	24	They refused to enter the Promised Land , for they wouldn ’ t believe his solemn oath to care for them .
TLB	Psalms	106	25	Instead , they pouted in their tents and mourned and despised his command .
TLB	Psalms	106	26	Therefore he swore that he would kill them in the wilderness
TLB	Psalms	106	27	and send their children away to distant lands as exiles .
TLB	Psalms	106	28	Then our fathers joined the worshipers of Baal at Peor and even offered sacrifices to the dead ! [ d ]
TLB	Psalms	106	29	With all these things they angered him—and so a plague broke out upon them
TLB	Psalms	106	30	and continued until Phinehas executed those whose sins had caused the plague to start .
TLB	Psalms	106	31	( For this good deed Phinehas will be remembered forever . )
TLB	Psalms	106	32	At Meribah , too , Israel angered God , causing Moses serious trouble ,
TLB	Psalms	106	33	for he became angry and spoke foolishly .
TLB	Psalms	106	34	Nor did Israel destroy the nations in the land as God had told them to ,
TLB	Psalms	106	35	but mingled in among the heathen and learned their evil ways ,
TLB	Psalms	106	36	sacrificing to their idols , and were led away from God . 37-38 They even sacrificed their little children to the demons—the idols of Canaan—shedding innocent blood and polluting the land with murder .
TLB	Psalms	106	39	Their evil deeds defiled them , for their love of idols was adultery in the sight of God .
TLB	Psalms	106	40	That is why Jehovah ’ s anger burned against his people , and he abhorred them . 41-42 That is why he let the heathen nations crush them . They were ruled by those who hated them and oppressed by their enemies .
TLB	Psalms	106	43	Again and again he delivered them from their slavery , but they continued to rebel against him and were finally destroyed by their sin .
TLB	Psalms	106	44	Yet , even so , he listened to their cries and heeded their distress ;
TLB	Psalms	106	45	he remembered his promises to them and relented because of his great love ,
TLB	Psalms	106	46	and caused even their enemies who captured them to pity them .
TLB	Psalms	106	47	O Lord God , save us ! Regather us from the nations so we can thank your holy name and rejoice and praise you .
TLB	Psalms	106	48	Blessed be the Lord , the God of Israel , from everlasting to everlasting . Let all the people say , “ Amen ! ” Hallelujah !

TLB	Psalms	107	2	Has the Lord redeemed you ? Then speak out ! Tell others he has saved you from your enemies .
TLB	Psalms	107	3	He brought the exiles back from the farthest corners of the earth .
TLB	Psalms	107	4	They were wandering homeless in the desert ,
TLB	Psalms	107	5	hungry and thirsty and faint .
TLB	Psalms	107	6	“ Lord , help ! ” they cried , and he did !
TLB	Psalms	107	7	He led them straight to safety and a place to live .
TLB	Psalms	107	8	Oh , that these men would praise the Lord for his loving-kindness , and for all of his wonderful deeds !
TLB	Psalms	107	9	For he satisfies the thirsty soul and fills the hungry soul with good .
TLB	Psalms	107	10	Who are these who sit in darkness , in the shadow of death , crushed by misery and slavery ?
TLB	Psalms	107	11	They rebelled against the Lord , scorning him who is the God above all gods .
TLB	Psalms	107	12	That is why he broke them with hard labor ; they fell and none could help them rise again .
TLB	Psalms	107	13	Then they cried to the Lord in their troubles , and he rescued them !
TLB	Psalms	107	14	He led them from the darkness and shadow of death and snapped their chains .
TLB	Psalms	107	15	Oh , that these men would praise the Lord for his loving-kindness and for all of his wonderful deeds !
TLB	Psalms	107	16	For he broke down their prison gates of brass and cut apart their iron bars .
TLB	Psalms	107	17	Others , the fools , were ill because of their sinful ways .
TLB	Psalms	107	18	Their appetites were gone , and death was near .
TLB	Psalms	107	19	Then they cried to the Lord in their troubles , and he helped them and delivered them .
TLB	Psalms	107	20	He spoke , and they were healed—snatched from the door of death .
TLB	Psalms	107	21	Oh , that these men would praise the Lord for his loving-kindness and for all of his wonderful deeds !
TLB	Psalms	107	22	Let them tell him thank you as their sacrifice and sing about his glorious deeds .
TLB	Psalms	107	23	And then there are the sailors sailing the seven seas , plying the trade routes of the world .
TLB	Psalms	107	24	They , too , observe the power of God in action .
TLB	Psalms	107	25	He calls to the storm winds ; the waves rise high .
TLB	Psalms	107	26	Their ships are tossed to the heavens and sink again to the depths ; the sailors cringe in terror .
TLB	Psalms	107	27	They reel and stagger like drunkards and are at their wit ’ s end .
TLB	Psalms	107	28	Then they cry to the Lord in their trouble , and he saves them .
TLB	Psalms	107	29	He calms the storm and stills the waves .
TLB	Psalms	107	30	What a blessing is that stillness as he brings them safely into harbor !
TLB	Psalms	107	31	Oh , that these men would praise the Lord for his loving-kindness and for all of his wonderful deeds !
TLB	Psalms	107	32	Let them praise him publicly before the congregation and before the leaders of the nation .
TLB	Psalms	107	33	He dries up rivers
TLB	Psalms	107	34	and turns the good land of the wicked into deserts of salt .
TLB	Psalms	107	35	Again , he turns deserts into fertile , watered valleys .
TLB	Psalms	107	36	He brings the hungry to settle there and build their cities ,
TLB	Psalms	107	37	to sow their fields and plant their vineyards , and reap their bumper crops !
TLB	Psalms	107	38	How he blesses them ! They raise big families there and many cattle .
TLB	Psalms	107	39	But others become poor through oppression , trouble , and sorrow .
TLB	Psalms	107	40	For God pours contempt upon the haughty and causes princes to wander among ruins ;
TLB	Psalms	107	41	but he rescues the poor who are godly and gives them many children and much prosperity .
TLB	Psalms	107	42	Good men everywhere will see it and be glad , while evil men are stricken silent .

TLB	Psalms	109	7	When his case is called for judgment , let him be pronounced guilty . Count his prayers as sins .
TLB	Psalms	109	8	Let his years be few and brief ; let others step forward to replace him . 9-10 May his children become fatherless and his wife a widow ; may they be evicted from the ruins of their home .
TLB	Psalms	109	11	May creditors seize his entire estate and strangers take all he has earned . 12-13 Let no one be kind to him ; let no one pity his fatherless children . May they die . May his family name be blotted out in a single generation .
TLB	Psalms	109	14	Punish the sins of his father and mother . Don ’ t overlook them .
TLB	Psalms	109	15	Think constantly about the evil things he has done , and cut off his name from the memory of man .
TLB	Psalms	109	16	For he refused all kindness to others , and persecuted those in need , and hounded brokenhearted ones to death .
TLB	Psalms	109	17	He loved to curse others ; now you curse him . He never blessed others ; now don ’ t you bless him .
TLB	Psalms	109	18	Cursing is as much a part of him as his clothing , or as the water he drinks , or the rich food he eats .
TLB	Psalms	109	19	Now may those curses return and cling to him like his clothing or his belt .
TLB	Psalms	109	20	This is the Lord ’ s punishment upon my enemies who tell lies about me and threaten me with death .
TLB	Psalms	109	21	But as for me , O Lord , deal with me as your child , as one who bears your name ! Because you are so kind , O Lord , deliver me . 22-23 I am slipping down the hill to death ; I am shaken off from life as easily as a man brushes a grasshopper from his arm .

TLB	Psalms	119	104	And since only your rules can give me wisdom and understanding , no wonder I hate every false teaching .
TLB	Psalms	119	105	Your words are a flashlight to light the path ahead of me and keep me from stumbling .

TLB	Psalms	119	122	Commit yourself to bless me ! Don ’ t let the proud oppress me !

TLB	Proverbs	1	1	These are the proverbs of King Solomon of Israel , David ’ s son :
TLB	Proverbs	1	2	He wrote them to teach his people how to live—how to act in every circumstance ,
TLB	Proverbs	1	3	for he wanted them to be understanding , just , and fair in everything they did .
TLB	Proverbs	1	4	“ I want to make the simpleminded wise ! ” he said . “ I want to warn young men about some problems they will face . 5-6 I want those already wise to become wiser and become leaders by exploring the depths of meaning in these nuggets of truth. ” 7-9 How does a man become wise ? The first step is to trust and reverence the Lord ! Only fools refuse to be taught . Listen to your father and mother . What you learn from them will stand you in good stead ; it will gain you many honors . [ a ]
TLB	Proverbs	1	10	If young toughs tell you , “ Come and join us ” —turn your back on them !
TLB	Proverbs	1	11	“ We ’ ll hide and rob and kill , ” they say .
TLB	Proverbs	1	12	“ Good or bad , we ’ ll treat them all alike .
TLB	Proverbs	1	13	And the loot we ’ ll get ! All kinds of stuff !
TLB	Proverbs	1	14	Come on , throw in your lot with us ; we ’ ll split with you in equal shares. ”
TLB	Proverbs	1	15	Don ’ t do it , son ! Stay far from men like that ,
TLB	Proverbs	1	16	for crime is their way of life , and murder is their specialty .
TLB	Proverbs	1	17	When a bird sees a trap being set , it stays away ,
TLB	Proverbs	1	18	but not these men ; they trap themselves ! They lay a booby trap for their own lives .
TLB	Proverbs	1	19	Such is the fate of all who live by violence and murder . [ b ] They will die a violent death .
TLB	Proverbs	1	20	Wisdom shouts in the streets for a hearing .
TLB	Proverbs	1	21	She calls out to the crowds along Main Street , and to the judges in their courts , and to everyone in all the land :
TLB	Proverbs	1	22	“ You simpletons ! ” she cries . “ How long will you go on being fools ? How long will you scoff at wisdom and fight the facts ?
TLB	Proverbs	1	23	Come here and listen to me ! I ’ ll pour out the spirit of wisdom upon you and make you wise .
TLB	Proverbs	1	24	I have called you so often , but still you won ’ t come . I have pleaded , but all in vain .
TLB	Proverbs	1	25	For you have spurned my counsel and reproof .
TLB	Proverbs	1	26	Some day you ’ ll be in trouble , and I ’ ll laugh ! Mock me , will you ? —I ’ ll mock you !
TLB	Proverbs	1	27	When a storm of terror surrounds you , and when you are engulfed by anguish and distress ,
TLB	Proverbs	1	28	then I will not answer your cry for help . It will be too late though you search for me ever so anxiously .
TLB	Proverbs	1	29	“ For you closed your eyes to the facts and did not choose to reverence and trust the Lord ,
TLB	Proverbs	1	30	and you turned your back on me , spurning my advice .
TLB	Proverbs	1	31	That is why you must eat the bitter fruit of having your own way and experience the full terrors of the pathway you have chosen .
TLB	Proverbs	1	32	For you turned away from me—to death ; your own complacency will kill you . Fools !
TLB	Proverbs	1	33	But all who listen to me shall live in peace and safety , unafraid. ” Footnotes - Proverbs 1:7 many honors , literally , “ a fair garland and adornment. ” - Proverbs 1:19 all who live by violence and murder , literally , “ all who are greedy of gain. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Proverbs	2	2	1-2 Every young man who listens to me and obeys my instructions will be given wisdom and good sense . 3-5 Yes , if you want better insight and discernment , and are searching for them as you would for lost money or hidden treasure , then wisdom will be given you and knowledge of God himself ; you will soon learn the importance of reverence for the Lord and of trusting him .

TLB	Proverbs	2	9	He shows how to distinguish right from wrong , how to find the right decision every time .
TLB	Proverbs	2	10	For wisdom and truth will enter the very center of your being , filling your life with joy . 11-13 You will be given the sense to stay away from evil men who want you to be their partners in crime—men who turn from God ’ s ways to walk down dark and evil paths
TLB	Proverbs	2	14	and exult in doing wrong , for they thoroughly enjoy their sins .
TLB	Proverbs	2	15	Everything they do is crooked and wrong . 16-17 Only wisdom from the Lord can save a man from the flattery of prostitutes ; these girls have abandoned their husbands and flouted the laws of God .

TLB	Proverbs	3	3	Never tire of loyalty and kindness . Hold these virtues tightly . Write them deep within your heart . 4-5 If you want favor with both God and man , and a reputation for good judgment and common sense , then trust the Lord completely ; don ’ t ever trust yourself .
TLB	Proverbs	3	6	In everything you do , put God first , and he will direct you and crown your efforts with success . 7-8 Don ’ t be conceited , sure of your own wisdom . Instead , trust and reverence the Lord , and turn your back on evil ; when you do that , then you will be given renewed health and vitality . 9-10 Honor the Lord by giving him the first part of all your income , and he will fill your barns with wheat and barley and overflow your wine vats with the finest wines . 11-12 Young man , do not resent it when God chastens and corrects you , for his punishment is proof of his love . Just as a father punishes a son he delights in to make him better , so the Lord corrects you . 13-15 The man who knows right from wrong [ a ] and has good judgment and common sense is happier than the man who is immensely rich ! For such wisdom is far more valuable than precious jewels . Nothing else compares with it . 16-17 Wisdom gives : a long , good life , riches , honor , pleasure , peace .
TLB	Proverbs	3	18	Wisdom is a tree of life to those who eat her fruit ; happy is the man who keeps on eating it .
TLB	Proverbs	3	19	The Lord ’ s wisdom founded the earth ; his understanding established all the universe and space .
TLB	Proverbs	3	20	The deep fountains of the earth were broken open by his knowledge , and the skies poured down rain .
TLB	Proverbs	3	21	Have two goals : wisdom—that is , knowing and doing right—and common sense . Don ’ t let them slip away ,
TLB	Proverbs	3	22	for they fill you with living energy and bring you honor and respect . [ b ]
TLB	Proverbs	3	23	They keep you safe from defeat and disaster and from stumbling off the trail . 24-26 With them on guard you can sleep without fear ; you need not be afraid of disaster or the plots of wicked men , for the Lord is with you ; he protects you . 27-28 Don ’ t withhold repayment of your debts . Don ’ t say “ some other time , ” if you can pay now .
TLB	Proverbs	3	29	Don ’ t plot against your neighbor ; he is trusting you .
TLB	Proverbs	3	30	Don ’ t get into needless fights .
TLB	Proverbs	3	31	Don ’ t envy violent men . Don ’ t copy their ways .
TLB	Proverbs	3	32	For such men are an abomination to the Lord , but he gives his friendship to the godly .
TLB	Proverbs	3	33	The curse of God is on the wicked , but his blessing is on the upright .
TLB	Proverbs	3	34	The Lord mocks at mockers , but helps the humble .

TLB	Proverbs	4	10	My son , listen to me and do as I say , and you will have a long , good life .

TLB	Proverbs	4	17	They eat and drink wickedness and violence !

And he will reward everyone according to his deeds . 13-14 My son , honey whets the appetite and so does wisdom ! When you enjoy becoming wise , there is hope for you !

TLB	Ecclesiastes	1	1	The author : Solomon [ a ] of Jerusalem , King David ’ s son , “ The Preacher. ”
TLB	Ecclesiastes	1	2	In my opinion , nothing is worthwhile ; everything is futile . 3-7 For what does a man get for all his hard work ? Generations come and go , but it makes no difference . [ b ] The sun rises and sets and hurries around to rise again . The wind blows south and north , here and there , twisting back and forth , getting nowhere . The rivers run into the sea , but the sea is never full , and the water returns again to the rivers and flows again to the sea . . . 8-11 everything is unutterably weary and tiresome . No matter how much we see , we are never satisfied ; no matter how much we hear , we are not content . History merely repeats itself . Nothing is truly new ; it has all been done or said before . What can you point to that is new ? How do you know it didn ’ t exist long ages ago ? We don ’ t remember what happened in those former times , and in the future generations no one will remember what we have done back here . 12-15 I , the Preacher , was king of Israel , living in Jerusalem . And I applied myself to search for understanding about everything in the universe . I discovered that the lot of man , which God has dealt to him , is not a happy one . It is all foolishness , chasing the wind . What is wrong can not be righted ; it is water over the dam ; and there is no use thinking of what might have been . 16-18 I said to myself , “ Look , I am better educated than any of the kings before me in Jerusalem . I have greater wisdom and knowledge. ” So I worked hard to be wise instead of foolish [ c ] —but now I realize that even this was like chasing the wind . For the more my wisdom , the more my grief ; to increase knowledge only increases distress . Footnotes - Ecclesiastes 1:1 Solomon , implied ; literally , “ the words of the Preacher , the son [ or descendant ] of David , King of Jerusalem. ” - Ecclesiastes 1:3 but it makes no difference , literally , “ but the earth remains forever. ” getting nowhere , implied . - Ecclesiastes 1:16 So I worked hard to be wise instead of foolish , or “ So I sought to learn about composure and madness. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Ecclesiastes	2	2	1-2 I said to myself , “ Come now , be merry ; enjoy yourself to the full. ” But I found that this , too , was futile . For it is silly to be laughing all the time ; what good does it do ?
TLB	Ecclesiastes	2	3	So after a lot of thinking , I decided to try the road of drink , while still holding steadily to my course of seeking wisdom . Next I changed my course again and followed the path of folly , so that I could experience the only happiness most men have throughout their lives . 4-6 Then I tried to find fulfillment by inaugurating a great public works program : homes , vineyards , gardens , parks , and orchards for myself , and reservoirs to hold the water to irrigate my plantations . 7-8 Next I bought slaves , both men and women , and others were born within my household . I also bred great herds and flocks , more than any of the kings before me . I collected silver and gold as taxes from many kings and provinces . In the cultural arts , I organized men ’ s and women ’ s choirs and orchestras . And then there were my many beautiful concubines .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	2	9	So I became greater than any of the kings in Jerusalem before me , and with it all I remained clear-eyed , so that I could evaluate all these things .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	2	10	Anything I wanted I took and did not restrain myself from any joy . I even found great pleasure in hard work . This pleasure was , indeed , my only reward for all my labors .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	2	11	But as I looked at everything I had tried , it was all so useless , a chasing of the wind , and there was nothing really worthwhile anywhere .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	2	12	Now I began a study of the comparative virtues of wisdom and folly , and anyone else would come to the same conclusion I did [ a ] — 13-14 that wisdom is of more value than foolishness , just as light is better than darkness ; for the wise man sees , while the fool is blind . And yet I noticed that there was one thing that happened to wise and foolish alike—
TLB	Ecclesiastes	2	15	just as the fool will die , so will I . So of what value is all my wisdom ? Then I realized that even wisdom is futile .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	2	16	For the wise and fool both die , and in the days to come both will be long forgotten .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	2	17	So now I hate life because it is all so irrational ; all is foolishness , chasing the wind .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	2	18	And I am disgusted about this—that I must leave the fruits of all my hard work to others .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	2	19	And who can tell whether my son will be a wise man or a fool ? And yet all I have will be given to him—how discouraging ! 20-23 So I turned in despair from hard work as the answer to my search for satisfaction . For though I spend my life searching for wisdom , knowledge , and skill , I must leave all of it to someone who hasn ’ t done a day ’ s work in his life ; he inherits all my efforts , free of charge . This is not only foolish but unfair . So what does a man get for all his hard work ? Days full of sorrow and grief , and restless , bitter nights . It is all utterly ridiculous . 24-26 So I decided that there was nothing better for a man to do than to enjoy his food and drink and his job . Then I realized that even this pleasure is from the hand of God . For who can eat or enjoy apart from him ? For God gives those who please him wisdom , knowledge , and joy ; but if a sinner becomes wealthy , God takes the wealth away from him and gives it to those who please him . So here , too , we see an example of foolishly chasing the wind .

TLB	Ecclesiastes	3	3	A time to kill ; A time to heal ; A time to destroy ; A time to rebuild ;
TLB	Ecclesiastes	3	2	A time to be born ; A time to die ; A time to plant ; A time to harvest ;
TLB	Ecclesiastes	3	4	A time to cry ; A time to laugh ; A time to grieve ; A time to dance ;
TLB	Ecclesiastes	3	5	A time for scattering stones ; A time for gathering stones ; A time to hug ; A time not to hug ;
TLB	Ecclesiastes	3	6	A time to find ; A time to lose ; A time for keeping ; A time for throwing away ;

TLB	Ecclesiastes	3	8	A time for loving ; A time for hating ; A time for war ; A time for peace .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	3	9	What does one really get from hard work ?
TLB	Ecclesiastes	3	10	I have thought about this in connection with all the various kinds of work God has given to mankind .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	3	11	Everything is appropriate in its own time . But though God has planted eternity in the hearts of men , even so , many can not see the whole scope of God ’ s work from beginning to end .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	3	12	So I conclude that , first , there is nothing better for a man than to be happy and to enjoy himself as long as he can ;
TLB	Ecclesiastes	3	13	and second , that he should eat and drink and enjoy the fruits of his labors , for these are gifts from God .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	3	14	And I know this , that whatever God does is final—nothing can be added or taken from it ; God ’ s purpose in this is that man should fear the all-powerful God . [ a ]
TLB	Ecclesiastes	3	15	Whatever is has been long ago ; and whatever is going to be has been before ; God brings to pass again what was in the distant past and disappeared . [ b ]
TLB	Ecclesiastes	3	16	Moreover , I notice that throughout the earth justice is giving way to crime , and even the police courts are corrupt .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	3	17	I said to myself , “ In due season God will judge everything man does , both good and bad. ”
TLB	Ecclesiastes	3	18	And then I realized that God is letting the world go on its sinful way so that he can test mankind , and so that men themselves will see that they are no better than beasts .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	3	19	For men and animals both breathe the same air , and both die . So mankind has no real advantage over the beasts ; what an absurdity !
TLB	Ecclesiastes	3	20	All go to one place—the dust from which they came and to which they must return .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	3	21	For who can prove that the spirit of man goes upward and the spirit of animals goes downward into dust ?
TLB	Ecclesiastes	3	22	So I saw that there is nothing better for men than that they should be happy in their work , for that is what they are here for , and no one can bring them back to life to enjoy what will be in the future , so let them enjoy it now . Footnotes - Ecclesiastes 3:14 God ’ s purpose in this is that man should fear the all-powerful God , implied . - Ecclesiastes 3:15 God brings to pass again what was in the distant past and disappeared , literally , “ God seeks what has been driven away. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Ecclesiastes	4	4	Then I observed that the basic motive for success is the driving force of envy and jealousy ! But this , too , is foolishness , chasing the wind . 5-6 The fool won ’ t work and almost starves but feels that it is better to be lazy and barely get by , than to work hard , when in the long run it is all so futile .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	4	2	So I felt that the dead were better off than the living .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	4	3	And most fortunate of all are those who have never been born and have never seen all the evil and crime throughout the earth .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	4	7	I also observed another piece of foolishness around the earth .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	4	8	This is the case of a man who is quite alone , without a son or brother , yet he works hard to keep gaining more riches . And to whom will he leave it all , and why is he giving up so much now ? It is all so pointless and depressing .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	4	9	Two can accomplish more than twice as much as one , for the results can be much better .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	4	10	If one falls , the other pulls him up ; but if a man falls when he is alone , he ’ s in trouble .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	4	11	Also , on a cold night , two under the same blanket gain warmth from each other , but how can one be warm alone ?
TLB	Ecclesiastes	4	12	And one standing alone can be attacked and defeated , but two can stand back-to-back and conquer ; three is even better , for a triple-braided cord is not easily broken .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	4	13	It is better to be a poor but wise youth than to be an old and foolish king who refuses all advice .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	4	14	Such a lad could come from prison and succeed . He might even become king though born in poverty .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	4	15	Everyone is eager to help a youth like that , even to help him usurp the throne .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	4	16	He can become the leader of millions of people and be very popular . But , then , the younger generation grows up around him and rejects him ! So again , it is all foolishness , chasing the wind . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Ecclesiastes	5	5	It is far better not to say you ’ ll do something than to say you will and then not do it . 6-7 In that case , your mouth is making you sin . Don ’ t try to defend yourself by telling the messenger from God that it was all a mistake to make the vow . [ a ] That would make God very angry ; and he might destroy your prosperity . Dreaming instead of doing is foolishness , and there is ruin in a flood of empty words ; fear God instead .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	5	4	So when you talk to God and vow to him that you will do something , don ’ t delay in doing it , for God has no pleasure in fools . Keep your promise to him .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	5	8	If you see some poor man being oppressed by the rich , with miscarriage of justice anywhere throughout the land , don ’ t be surprised ! For every official is under orders from higher up , and the higher officials look up to their superiors . And so the matter is lost in red tape and bureaucracy . [ b ]
TLB	Ecclesiastes	5	9	And over them all is the king . Oh , for a king who is devoted to his country ! Only he can bring order from this chaos .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	5	10	He who loves money shall never have enough . The foolishness of thinking that wealth brings happiness !
TLB	Ecclesiastes	5	11	The more you have , the more you spend , right up to the limits of your income . So what is the advantage of wealth—except perhaps to watch it as it runs through your fingers !
TLB	Ecclesiastes	5	12	The man who works hard sleeps well whether he eats little or much , but the rich must worry and suffer insomnia . 13-14 There is another serious problem I have seen everywhere—savings are put into risky investments that turn sour , and soon there is nothing left to pass on to one ’ s son .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	5	15	The man who speculates is soon back to where he began—with nothing .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	5	16	This , as I said , is a very serious problem , for all his hard work has been for nothing ; he has been working for the wind . It is all swept away .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	5	17	All the rest of his life he is under a cloud—gloomy , discouraged , frustrated , and angry .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	5	18	Well , one thing , at least , is good : It is for a man to eat well , drink a good glass of wine , accept his position in life , and enjoy his work whatever his job may be , for however long the Lord may let him live . 19-20 And , of course , it is very good if a man has received wealth from the Lord and the good health to enjoy it . To enjoy your work and to accept your lot in life—that is indeed a gift from God . The person who does that will not need to look back with sorrow on his past , for God gives him joy .

TLB	Ecclesiastes	6	6	Though a man lives a thousand years twice over but doesn ’ t find contentment—well , what ’ s the use ? 7-8 Wise men and fools alike spend their lives scratching for food and never seem to get enough . Both have the same problem , yet the poor man who is wise lives a far better life .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	6	2	God has given to some men very great wealth and honor so that they can have everything they want , but he doesn ’ t give them the health to enjoy it , and they die and others get it all ! This is absurd , a hollow mockery , and a serious fault .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	6	3	Even if a man has a hundred sons and as many daughters and lives to be very old , but leaves so little money at his death that his children can ’ t even give him a decent burial—I say that he would be better off born dead .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	6	4	For though his birth would then be futile and end in darkness , without even a name ,
TLB	Ecclesiastes	6	5	never seeing the sun or even knowing its existence , yet that is better than to be an old , unhappy man .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	6	9	A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush ; mere dreaming of nice things is foolish ; it ’ s chasing the wind .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	6	10	All things are decided by fate ; it was known long ago what each man would be . So there ’ s no use arguing with God about your destiny .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	6	11	The more words you speak , the less they mean , so why bother to speak at all ?

TLB	Ecclesiastes	7	7	The wise man is turned into a fool by a bribe ; it destroys his understanding .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	7	2	It is better to spend your time at funerals than at festivals . For you are going to die , and it is a good thing to think about it while there is still time .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	7	3	Sorrow is better than laughter , for sadness has a refining influence on us .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	7	4	Yes , a wise man thinks much of death , while the fool thinks only of having a good time now .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	7	5	It is better to be criticized by a wise man than to be praised by a fool !
TLB	Ecclesiastes	7	6	For a fool ’ s compliment is as quickly gone as paper in fire , and it is silly to be impressed by it .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	7	8	Finishing is better than starting ! Patience is better than pride !
TLB	Ecclesiastes	7	9	Don ’ t be quick-tempered—that is being a fool .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	7	10	Don ’ t long for “ the good old days , ” for you don ’ t know whether they were any better than these !
TLB	Ecclesiastes	7	11	To be wise is as good as being rich ; in fact , it is better .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	7	12	You can get anything by either wisdom or money , but being wise has many advantages .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	7	13	See the way God does things and fall into line . Don ’ t fight the facts of nature . [ a ] Who can straighten what he has made crooked ?
TLB	Ecclesiastes	7	14	Enjoy prosperity whenever you can , and when hard times strike , realize that God gives one as well as the other—so that everyone will realize that nothing is certain in this life . 15-17 In this silly life I have seen everything , including the fact that some of the good die young and some of the wicked live on and on . So don ’ t be too good or too wise ! Why destroy yourself ? On the other hand , don ’ t be too wicked either—don ’ t be a fool ! Why should you die before your time ?
TLB	Ecclesiastes	7	18	Tackle every task that comes along , and if you fear God , you can expect his blessing .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	7	19	A wise man is stronger than the mayors of ten big cities !
TLB	Ecclesiastes	7	20	And there is not a single man in all the earth who is always good and never sins . 21-22 Don ’ t eavesdrop ! You may hear your servant cursing you ! For you know how often you yourself curse others !
TLB	Ecclesiastes	7	23	I have tried my best to be wise . I declared , “ I will be wise , ” but it didn ’ t work .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	7	24	Wisdom is far away and very difficult to find .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	7	25	I searched everywhere , determined to find wisdom and the reason for things . . . to prove to myself the wickedness of folly and that foolishness is madness .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	7	26	A prostitute [ b ] is more bitter than death . May it please God that you escape from her , but sinners don ’ t evade her snares . 27-28 This is my conclusion , says the Preacher . Step by step I came to this result after researching in every direction : One tenth of one percent of the men I interviewed could be said to be wise , but not one woman !
TLB	Ecclesiastes	7	29	And I found that though God has made men upright , each has turned away to follow his own downward road .

TLB	Ecclesiastes	8	8	No one can hold back his spirit from departing ; no one has the power to prevent his day of death , for there is no discharge from that obligation and that dark battle . Certainly a man ’ s wickedness is not going to help him then . 9-10 I have thought deeply about all that goes on here in the world , where people have the power of injuring each other . I have seen wicked men buried , and as their friends returned from the cemetery , having forgotten all the dead man ’ s evil deeds , these men were praised in the very city where they had committed their many crimes ! How odd !
TLB	Ecclesiastes	8	4	The king ’ s command is backed by great power , and no one can withstand it or question it .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	8	5	Those who obey him will not be punished . The wise man will find a time and a way to do what he says . 6-7 Yes , there is a time and a way for everything , though man ’ s trouble lies heavy upon him ; for how can he avoid what he doesn ’ t know is going to happen ?
TLB	Ecclesiastes	8	11	Because God does not punish sinners instantly , people feel it is safe to do wrong .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	8	12	But though a man sins a hundred times and still lives , I know very well that those who fear God will be better off ,
TLB	Ecclesiastes	8	13	unlike the wicked , who will not live long , good lives—their days shall pass away as quickly as shadows because they don ’ t fear God .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	8	14	There is a strange thing happening here upon the earth : Providence seems to treat some good men as though they were wicked , and some wicked men as though they were good . This is all very vexing and troublesome !
TLB	Ecclesiastes	8	15	Then I decided to spend my time having fun because I felt that there was nothing better in all the earth than that a man should eat , drink , and be merry , with the hope that this happiness would stick with him in all the hard work that God gives to mankind everywhere . 16-17 In my search for wisdom I observed all that was going on everywhere across the earth—ceaseless activity , day and night .

TLB	Ecclesiastes	9	11	Again I looked throughout the earth and saw that the swiftest person does not always win the race , nor the strongest man the battle , and that wise men are often poor , and skillful men are not necessarily famous ; but it is all by chance , by happening to be at the right place at the right time .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	9	12	A man never knows when he is going to run into bad luck . He is like a fish caught in a net , or a bird caught in a snare .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	9	13	Here is another thing that has made a deep impression on me as I have watched human affairs :
TLB	Ecclesiastes	9	14	There was a small city with only a few people living in it , and a great king came with his army and besieged it .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	9	15	There was in the city a wise man , very poor , and he knew what to do to save the city , and so it was rescued . But afterwards no one thought any more about him .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	9	16	Then I realized that though wisdom is better than strength , nevertheless , if the wise man is poor , he will be despised , and what he says will not be appreciated .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	9	17	But even so , the quiet words of a wise man are better than the shout of a king of fools .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	9	18	Wisdom is better than weapons of war , but one rotten apple can spoil a barrelful . Footnotes - Ecclesiastes 9:5 But the dead know nothing ; they don ’ t even have their memories .

TLB	Ecclesiastes	10	3	You can identify a fool just by the way he walks down the street !
TLB	Ecclesiastes	10	4	If the boss is angry with you , don ’ t quit ! A quiet spirit will quiet his bad temper .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	10	5	There is another evil I have seen as I have watched the world go by , a sad situation concerning kings and rulers :
TLB	Ecclesiastes	10	6	For I have seen foolish men given great authority and rich men not given their rightful place of dignity !
TLB	Ecclesiastes	10	7	I have even seen servants riding , while princes walk like servants ! 8-9 Dig a well—and fall into it ! Demolish an old wall—and be bitten by a snake ! When working in a quarry , stones will fall and crush you ! There is risk in each stroke of your ax !
TLB	Ecclesiastes	10	11	When the horse is stolen , it is too late to lock the barn . [ a ] 12-13 It is pleasant to listen to wise words , but a fool ’ s speech brings him to ruin . Since he begins with a foolish premise , his conclusion is sheer madness .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	10	14	A fool knows all about the future and tells everyone in detail ! But who can really know what is going to happen ?
TLB	Ecclesiastes	10	15	A fool is so upset by a little work that he has no strength for the simplest matter .

Happy the land whose king is a nobleman and whose leaders work hard before they feast and drink , and then only to strengthen themselves for the tasks ahead !

TLB	Ecclesiastes	11	2	Divide your gifts among many , [ a ] for in the days ahead you yourself may need much help .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	11	3	When the clouds are heavy , the rains come down ; when a tree falls , whether south or north , the die is cast , for there it lies .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	11	4	If you wait for perfect conditions , you will never get anything done . [ b ]
TLB	Ecclesiastes	11	5	God ’ s ways are as mysterious as the pathway of the wind and as the manner in which a human spirit is infused into the little body of a baby while it is yet in its mother ’ s womb .

TLB	Ecclesiastes	12	12	But , my son , be warned : there is no end of opinions ready to be expressed . Studying them can go on forever and become very exhausting !
TLB	Ecclesiastes	12	2	It will be too late then to try to remember him when the sun and light and moon and stars are dim to your old eyes , and there is no silver lining left among your clouds .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	12	3	For there will come a time when your limbs will tremble with age , your strong legs will become weak , and your teeth will be too few to do their work , and there will be blindness too .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	12	4	Then let your lips be tightly closed while eating when your teeth are gone ! And you will waken at dawn with the first note of the birds ; but you yourself will be deaf and tuneless , with quavering voice .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	12	5	You will be afraid of heights and of falling—a white-haired , withered old man , dragging himself along : without sexual desire , standing at death ’ s door , and nearing his everlasting home as the mourners go along the streets .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	12	6	Yes , remember your Creator now while you are young—before the silver cord of life snaps and the gold bowl is broken ; before the pitcher is broken at the fountain and the wheel is broken at the cistern ;
TLB	Ecclesiastes	12	7	then the dust returns to the earth as it was , and the spirit returns to God who gave it .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	12	8	All is futile , says the Preacher ; utterly futile .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	12	9	But then , because the Preacher was wise , he went on teaching the people all he knew ; and he collected proverbs and classified them .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	12	10	For the Preacher was not only a wise man but a good teacher ; he not only taught what he knew to the people , but taught them in an interesting manner .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	12	11	The wise man ’ s words are like goads that spur to action . They nail down important truths . Students are wise who master what their teachers tell them .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	12	13	Here is my final conclusion : fear God and obey his commandments , for this is the entire duty of man .
TLB	Ecclesiastes	12	14	For God will judge us for everything we do , including every hidden thing , good or bad . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Isaiah	1	1	These are the messages that came to Isaiah , son of Amoz , in the visions he saw during the reigns of King Uzziah , King Jotham , King Ahaz , and King Hezekiah—all kings of Judah . In these messages God showed him what was going to happen to Judah and Jerusalem in the days ahead .
TLB	Isaiah	1	2	Listen , O heaven and earth , to what the Lord is saying : The children I raised and cared for so long and tenderly have turned against me .
TLB	Isaiah	1	3	Even the animals—the donkey and the ox—know their owner and appreciate his care for them , but not my people Israel . No matter what I do for them , they still don ’ t care .
TLB	Isaiah	1	4	Oh , what a sinful nation they are ! They walk bent-backed beneath their load of guilt . Their fathers before them were evil too . Born to be bad , they have turned their backs upon the Lord and have despised the Holy One of Israel . They have cut themselves off from his help . 5-6 Oh , my people , haven ’ t you had enough of punishment ? Why will you force me to whip you again and again ? Must you forever rebel ? From head to foot you are sick and weak and faint , covered with bruises and welts and infected wounds , unanointed and unbound .
TLB	Isaiah	1	7	Your country lies in ruins ; your cities are burned ; while you watch , foreigners are destroying and plundering everything they see .
TLB	Isaiah	1	8	You stand there helpless and abandoned like a watchman ’ s shanty in the field when the harvesttime is over—or when the crop is stripped and robbed .
TLB	Isaiah	1	9	If the Lord Almighty had not stepped in to save a few of us , we would have been wiped out as Sodom and Gomorrah were .
TLB	Isaiah	1	10	An apt comparison ! [ a ] Listen , you leaders of Israel , you men of Sodom and Gomorrah , as I call you now . Listen to the Lord . Hear what he is telling you !
TLB	Isaiah	1	11	I am sick of your sacrifices . Don ’ t bring me any more of them . I don ’ t want your fat rams ; I don ’ t want to see the blood from your offerings . 12-13 Who wants your sacrifices when you have no sorrow for your sins ? The incense you bring me is a stench in my nostrils . Your holy celebrations of the new moon and the Sabbath , and your special days for fasting—even your most pious meetings—all are frauds ! I want nothing more to do with them .
TLB	Isaiah	1	14	I hate them all ; I can ’ t stand the sight of them .
TLB	Isaiah	1	15	From now on , when you pray with your hands stretched out to heaven , I won ’ t look or listen . Even though you make many prayers , I will not hear , for your hands are those of murderers ; they are covered with the blood of your innocent victims .
TLB	Isaiah	1	16	Oh , wash yourselves ! Be clean ! Let me no longer see you doing all these wicked things ; quit your evil ways .
TLB	Isaiah	1	17	Learn to do good , to be fair , and to help the poor , the fatherless , and widows .
TLB	Isaiah	1	18	Come , let ’ s talk this over , says the Lord ; no matter how deep the stain of your sins , I can take it out and make you as clean as freshly fallen snow . Even if you are stained as red as crimson , I can make you white as wool !
TLB	Isaiah	1	19	If you will only let me help you , if you will only obey , then I will make you rich !
TLB	Isaiah	1	20	But if you keep on turning your backs and refusing to listen to me , you will be killed by your enemies ; I , the Lord , have spoken .
TLB	Isaiah	1	21	Jerusalem , once a faithful wife ! And now a prostitute ! Running after other gods ! Once “ The City of Fair Play , ” but now a gang of murderers .
TLB	Isaiah	1	22	Once like sterling silver ; now mixed with worthless alloy ! Once so pure , but now diluted like watered-down wine !
TLB	Isaiah	1	23	Your leaders are rebels , companions of thieves ; all of them take bribes and won ’ t defend the widows and orphans .
TLB	Isaiah	1	24	Therefore the Lord , the Mighty One of Israel , says : I will pour out my anger on you , my enemies !
TLB	Isaiah	1	25	I myself will melt you in a smelting pot and skim off your slag .
TLB	Isaiah	1	26	And afterwards I will give you good judges and wise counselors like those you used to have . Then your city shall again be called “ The City of Justice ” and “ The Faithful Town. ”
TLB	Isaiah	1	27	Those who return to the Lord , who are just and good , shall be redeemed .
TLB	Isaiah	1	28	( But all sinners shall utterly perish , for they refuse to come to me . )
TLB	Isaiah	1	29	Shame will cover you , and you will blush to think of all those times you sacrificed to idols in your groves of “ sacred ” oaks .
TLB	Isaiah	1	30	You will perish like a withered tree or a garden without water .
TLB	Isaiah	1	31	The strongest among you will disappear like burning straw ; your evil deeds are the spark that sets the straw on fire , and no one will be able to put it out . Footnotes - Isaiah 1:10 An apt comparison , implied . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Isaiah	2	3	“ Come , ” everyone will say , “ let us go up the mountain of the Lord , to the Temple of the God of Israel ; there he will teach us his laws , and we will obey them. ” For in those days the world will be ruled from Jerusalem .

TLB	Isaiah	2	19	When the Lord stands up from his throne to shake up the earth , his enemies will crawl with fear into the holes in the rocks and into the caves because of the glory of his majesty .
TLB	Isaiah	2	20	Then at last they will abandon their gold and silver idols to the moles and bats
TLB	Isaiah	2	21	and crawl into the caverns to hide among the jagged rocks at the tops of the cliffs , to try to get away from the terror of the Lord and the glory of his majesty when he rises to terrify the earth .

TLB	Isaiah	3	13	The Lord stands up ! He is the great Prosecuting Attorney presenting his case against his people !
TLB	Isaiah	3	14	First to feel his wrath will be the elders and the princes , for they have defrauded the poor . They have filled their barns with grain extorted from the helpless peasants .

TLB	Isaiah	5	5	I will tear down the fences and let my vineyard go to pasture to be trampled by cattle and sheep .
TLB	Isaiah	5	2	He plowed it and took out all the rocks and planted his vineyard with the choicest vines . He built a watchtower and cut a winepress in the rocks . Then he waited for the harvest , but the grapes that grew were wild and sour and not at all the sweet ones he expected .
TLB	Isaiah	5	3	Now , men of Jerusalem and Judah , you have heard the case ! You be the judges !
TLB	Isaiah	5	4	What more could I have done ? Why did my vineyard give me wild grapes instead of sweet ?
TLB	Isaiah	5	6	I won ’ t prune it or hoe it , but let it be overgrown with briars and thorns . I will command the clouds not to rain on it anymore .
TLB	Isaiah	5	7	I have given you the story of God ’ s people . They are the vineyard that I spoke about . Israel and Judah are his pleasant acreage ! He expected them to yield a crop of justice , but found bloodshed instead . He expected righteousness , but the cries of deep oppression met his ears . [ a ]
TLB	Isaiah	5	8	You buy up property so others have no place to live . Your homes are built on great estates so you can be alone in the midst of the earth !
TLB	Isaiah	5	9	But the Lord Almighty has sworn your awful fate—with my own ears I heard him say , “ Many a beautiful home will lie deserted , their owners killed or gone .
TLB	Isaiah	5	10	An acre of vineyard will not produce a gallon of juice ! Ten bushels of seed will yield a one-bushel crop ! ”
TLB	Isaiah	5	11	Woe to you who get up early in the morning to go on long drinking bouts that last till late at night—woe to you drunken bums .
TLB	Isaiah	5	12	You furnish lovely music at your grand parties ; the orchestras are superb ! But for the Lord you have no thought or care .
TLB	Isaiah	5	13	Therefore I will send you into exile far away because you neither know nor care that I have done so much for you . Your great and honored men will starve , and the common people will die of thirst .
TLB	Isaiah	5	14	Hell is licking its chops in anticipation of this delicious morsel , Jerusalem . Her great and small shall be swallowed up , and all her drunken throngs .

TLB	Isaiah	5	24	Therefore God will deal with them and burn them . They will disappear like straw on fire . Their roots will rot and their flowers wither , for they have thrown away the laws of God and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel .
TLB	Isaiah	5	25	That is why the anger of the Lord is hot against his people ; that is why he has reached out his hand to smash them . The hills will tremble , and the rotting bodies of his people will be thrown as refuse in the streets . But even so , his anger is not ended ; his hand is heavy on them still .
TLB	Isaiah	5	26	He will send a signal to the nations far away , whistling to those at the ends of the earth , and they will come racing toward Jerusalem .
TLB	Isaiah	5	27	They never weary , never stumble , never stop ; their belts are tight , their bootstraps strong ; they run without stopping for rest or for sleep .

TLB	Isaiah	6	6	Then one of the mighty angels flew over to the altar and with a pair of tongs picked out a burning coal .
TLB	Isaiah	6	2	Hovering about him were mighty , six-winged angels of fire . With two of their wings they covered their faces , with two others they covered their feet , and with two they flew .
TLB	Isaiah	6	3	In a great antiphonal chorus they sang , “ Holy , holy , holy is the Lord Almighty ; the whole earth is filled with his glory. ”
TLB	Isaiah	6	4	Such singing it was ! It shook the Temple to its foundations , and suddenly the entire sanctuary was filled with smoke .
TLB	Isaiah	6	5	Then I said , “ My doom is sealed , for I am a foul-mouthed sinner , a member of a sinful , foul-mouthed race ; and I have looked upon the King , the Lord of heaven ’ s armies. ”
TLB	Isaiah	6	7	He touched my lips with it and said , “ Now you are pronounced ‘ not guilty ’ because this coal has touched your lips . Your sins are all forgiven. ”
TLB	Isaiah	6	8	Then I heard the Lord asking , “ Whom shall I send as a messenger to my people ? Who will go ? ” And I said , “ Lord , I ’ ll go ! Send me. ”

TLB	Isaiah	6	12	and they are all taken away as slaves to other countries far away , and all the land of Israel lies deserted !
TLB	Isaiah	6	13	Yet a tenth—a remnant—will survive ; and though Israel is invaded again and again and destroyed , yet Israel will be like a tree cut down , whose stump still lives to grow again. ” Footnotes - Isaiah 6:10 Apparently God ’ s patience with their chronic rebellion was finally exhausted .

However , the Gospel of Matthew ( 1:23 ) tells us that there was a further fulfillment of this prophecy , in that a virgin ( Mary ) conceived and bore a son , Immanuel , the Christ . We have therefore properly used this higher meaning , “ virgin , ” in v.
TLB	Isaiah	7	5	Yes , the kings of Syria and Israel are coming against you . “ They say ,
TLB	Isaiah	7	6	‘ We will invade Judah and throw her people into panic . Then we ’ ll fight our way into Jerusalem and install the son of Tabeel as their king. ’

TLB	Isaiah	7	10	Not long after this , the Lord sent this further message to King Ahaz :
TLB	Isaiah	7	11	“ Ask me for a sign , Ahaz , to prove that I will indeed crush your enemies as I have said . Ask anything you like , in heaven or on earth. ” [ b ]
TLB	Isaiah	7	12	But the king refused . “ No , ” he said , “ I ’ ll not bother the Lord with anything like that. ”

TLB	Isaiah	7	18	At that time the Lord will whistle for the army of Upper Egypt , [ f ] and of Assyria too , to swarm down upon you like flies and destroy you , like bees to sting and to kill .
TLB	Isaiah	7	19	They will come in vast hordes , spreading across the whole land , even into the desolate valleys , caves , and thorny parts , as well as to all your fertile acres .
TLB	Isaiah	7	20	In that day the Lord will take this “ razor ” —these Assyrians you have hired to save you [ g ] —and use it on you to shave off everything you have : your land , your crops , your people . 21-22 When they finally stop plundering , the whole nation will be a pastureland ; whole flocks and herds will be destroyed , and a farmer will be fortunate to have a cow and two sheep left . But the abundant pastureland will yield plenty of milk , and everyone left will live on curds and wild honey .
TLB	Isaiah	7	23	At that time the lush vineyards will become patches of briars .
TLB	Isaiah	7	24	All the land will be one vast thornfield , a hunting ground overrun by wildlife .
TLB	Isaiah	7	25	No one will go to the fertile hillsides where once the gardens grew , for thorns will cover them ; cattle , sheep , and goats will graze there . Footnotes - Isaiah 7:8 Ephraim , too , will be crushed and broken . Samaria , the capital of “ Ephraim , ” fell to the Assyrian armies in

TLB	Isaiah	8	8	Again the Lord sent me a message : “ Make a large signboard and write on it the birth announcement of the son I am going to give you . Use capital letters ! His name will be Maher-shalal-hash-baz , which means ‘ Your enemies will soon be destroyed. ’ ” [ a ]
TLB	Isaiah	8	2	I asked Uriah the priest and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah , both known as honest men , to watch me as I wrote so they could testify that I had written it before the child was even on the way . [ b ]
TLB	Isaiah	8	3	Then I had sexual intercourse with my wife and she conceived and bore me a son . And the Lord said , “ Call him Maher-shalal-hash-baz .
TLB	Isaiah	8	4	This name prophesies that within a couple of years , before this child is even old enough to say ‘ Daddy ’ or ‘ Mommy , ’ the king of Assyria will invade both Damascus and Samaria and carry away their riches. ”
TLB	Isaiah	8	5	Then the Lord spoke to me again and said :
TLB	Isaiah	8	6	“ Since the people of Jerusalem are planning to refuse my gentle care [ c ] and are enthusiastic about asking King Rezin and King Pekah to come and aid them , 7-8 therefore I will overwhelm my people with Euphrates ’ mighty flood ; the king of Assyria and all his mighty armies will rage against them . This flood will overflow all its channels and sweep into your land of Judah , O Immanuel , submerging it from end to end. ” 9-10 Do your worst , O Syria and Israel , [ d ] our enemies , but you will not succeed—you will be shattered . Listen to me , all you enemies of ours : Prepare for war against us—and perish ! Yes ! Perish ! Call your councils of war , develop your strategies , prepare your plans of attacking us , and perish ! For God is with us .
TLB	Isaiah	8	11	The Lord has said in strongest terms : Do not under any circumstances go along with the plans of Judah to surrender to Syria and Israel .
TLB	Isaiah	8	12	Don ’ t let people call you a traitor for staying true to God . Don ’ t you panic as so many of your neighbors are doing when they think of Syria and Israel attacking you .
TLB	Isaiah	8	13	Don ’ t fear anything except the Lord of the armies of heaven ! If you fear him , you need fear nothing else . 14-15 He will be your safety ; but Israel and Judah have refused his care and thereby stumbled against the Rock of their salvation and lie fallen and crushed beneath it : God ’ s presence among them has endangered them !
TLB	Isaiah	8	16	Write down all these things I am going to do , says the Lord , and seal them up for the future . Entrust them to some godly man to pass on down to godly men of future generations .
TLB	Isaiah	8	17	I will wait for the Lord to help us , though he is hiding now . My only hope is in him .
TLB	Isaiah	8	18	I and the children God has given me have symbolic names that reveal the plans of the Lord of heaven ’ s armies for his people : Isaiah means “ Jehovah will save ( his people ) , ” Shear-jashub means “ A remnant shall return , ” and Maher-shalal-hash-baz means “ Your enemies will soon be destroyed. ”
TLB	Isaiah	8	19	So why are you trying to find out the future by consulting witches and mediums ? Don ’ t listen to their whisperings and mutterings . Can the living find out the future from the dead ? Why not ask your God ?
TLB	Isaiah	8	20	“ Check these witches ’ words against the Word of God ! ” he says . “ If their messages are different than mine , it is because I have not sent them ; for they have no light or truth in them .
TLB	Isaiah	8	21	My people will be led away captive , stumbling , weary and hungry . And because they are hungry , they will rave and shake their fists at heaven and curse their King and their God .

And they will be thrust out into the darkness. ” Footnotes - Isaiah 8:1 Your enemies will soon be destroyed , literally , “ Plundering and despoiling [ will ] come quickly. ” - Isaiah 8:2 before the child was even on the way , implied . - Isaiah 8:6 are planning to refuse my gentle care , literally , “ have refused the waters of Shiloah that go softly. ” - Isaiah 8:9 O Syria and Israel , literally , “ O peoples. ” our enemies , implied .

TLB	Isaiah	9	5	In that glorious day of peace there will no longer be the issuing of battle gear ; no more the bloodstained uniforms of war ; all such will be burned .
TLB	Isaiah	9	6	For unto us a child is born ; unto us a son is given ; and the government shall be upon his shoulder . These will be his royal titles : “ Wonderful , ” “ Counselor , ” “ The Mighty God , ” “ The Everlasting Father , ” “ The Prince of Peace. ”
TLB	Isaiah	9	7	His ever-expanding , peaceful government will never end . He will rule with perfect fairness and justice from the throne of his father David . He will bring true justice and peace to all the nations of the world . This is going to happen because the Lord of heaven ’ s armies has dedicated himself to do it ! 8-10 The Lord has spoken out against that braggart Israel who says that though our land lies in ruins now , we will rebuild it better than before . The sycamore trees are cut down , but we will replace them with cedars ! 11-12 The Lord ’ s reply to your bragging is to bring your enemies [ a ] against you—the Syrians on the east and the Philistines on the west . With bared fangs they will devour Israel . And even then the Lord ’ s anger against you will not be satisfied—his fist will still be poised to smash you .
TLB	Isaiah	9	13	For after all this punishment you will not repent and turn to him , the Lord of heaven ’ s armies . 14-15 Therefore the Lord , in one day , will destroy the leaders of Israel and the lying prophets .
TLB	Isaiah	9	16	For the leaders of his people have led them down the paths of ruin .
TLB	Isaiah	9	17	That is why the Lord has no joy in their young men and no mercy upon even the widows and orphans , for they are all filthy-mouthed , wicked liars . That is why his anger is not yet satisfied , but his fist is still poised to smash them all .
TLB	Isaiah	9	18	He will burn up all this wickedness , these thorns and briars ; and the flames will consume the forests too , and send a vast cloud of smoke billowing up from their burning . 19-20 The land is blackened by that fire , by the wrath of the Lord of heaven ’ s armies . The people are fuel for the fire . Each fights against his brother to steal his food but will never have enough . Finally they will even eat their own children !
TLB	Isaiah	9	21	Manasseh against Ephraim and Ephraim against Manasseh—and both against Judah . Yet even after all of this , God ’ s anger is not yet satisfied . His hand is still heavy upon them to crush them . Footnotes - Isaiah 9:11 your enemies , or “ Rezin ’ s enemies ” in some ancient versions . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Isaiah	10	10	Yes , we have finished off many a kingdom whose idols were far greater than those in Jerusalem and Samaria ,
TLB	Isaiah	10	2	Kings 19:35 and Isaiah 37:36 . - Isaiah 10:27 as decreed , literally , “ because of ointment. ” Some see here a reference to the Messiah , the Anointed One . The Living Bible copyright ©
TLB	Isaiah	10	3	Oh , what will you do when I visit you in that day when I send desolation upon you from a distant land ? To whom will you turn then for your help ? Where will your treasures be safe ?
TLB	Isaiah	10	4	I will not help you ; you will stumble along as prisoners or lie among the slain . And even then my anger will not be satisfied , but my fist will still be poised to strike you . 5-6 Assyria is the whip of my anger ; his military strength is my weapon upon this godless nation , doomed and damned ; he will enslave them and plunder them and trample them like dirt beneath his feet .
TLB	Isaiah	10	7	But the king of Assyria will not know that it is I who sent him . He will merely think he is attacking my people as part of his plan to conquer the world .
TLB	Isaiah	10	8	He will declare that every one of his princes will soon be a king , ruling a conquered land .
TLB	Isaiah	10	9	“ We will destroy Calno just as we did Carchemish , ” he will say , “ and Hamath will go down before us as Arpad did ; and we will destroy Samaria just as we did Damascus .
TLB	Isaiah	10	11	so when we have defeated Samaria and her idols , we will destroy Jerusalem with hers. ”
TLB	Isaiah	10	12	After the Lord has used the king of Assyria to accomplish his purpose , then he will turn upon the Assyrians and punish them too—for they are proud and haughty men .
TLB	Isaiah	10	13	They boast , “ We in our own power and wisdom have won these wars . We are great and wise . By our own strength we broke down the walls and destroyed the people and carried off their treasures .
TLB	Isaiah	10	14	In our greatness we have robbed their nests of riches and gathered up kingdoms as a farmer gathers eggs , and no one can move a finger or open his mouth to peep against us ! ”
TLB	Isaiah	10	15	But the Lord says , “ Shall the ax boast greater power than the man who uses it ? Is the saw greater than the man who saws ? Can a rod strike unless a hand is moving it ? Can a cane walk by itself ? ”
TLB	Isaiah	10	16	Because of all your evil boasting , O king of Assyria , the Lord of Hosts will send a plague among your proud troops and strike them down .
TLB	Isaiah	10	17	God , the Light and Holy One of Israel , will be the fire and flame that will destroy them . In a single night he will burn those thorns and briars , the Assyrians who destroyed the land of Israel . [ a ]
TLB	Isaiah	10	18	Assyria ’ s vast army is like a glorious forest , yet it will be destroyed . The Lord will destroy them , soul and body , as when a sick man wastes away .
TLB	Isaiah	10	19	Only a few from all that mighty army will be left ; so few a child could count them !
TLB	Isaiah	10	20	Then at last those left in Israel and in Judah will trust the Lord , the Holy One of Israel , instead of fearing the Assyrians .
TLB	Isaiah	10	21	A remnant of them will return to the mighty God .
TLB	Isaiah	10	22	But though Israel be now as many as the sands along the shore , yet only a few of them will be left to return at that time ; God has rightly decided to destroy his people .
TLB	Isaiah	10	23	Yes , it has already been decided by the Lord God to consume them .
TLB	Isaiah	10	24	Therefore the Lord God says , “ O my people in Jerusalem , don ’ t be afraid of the Assyrians when they oppress you just as the Egyptians did long ago .
TLB	Isaiah	10	25	It will not last very long ; in a little while my anger against you will end , and then it will rise against them to destroy them. ”
TLB	Isaiah	10	26	The Lord Almighty will send his angel to slay them in a mighty slaughter like the time when Gideon triumphed over Midian at the rock of Oreb or the time God drowned the Egyptian armies in the sea .
TLB	Isaiah	10	27	On that day God will end the bondage of his people . He will break the yoke of slavery off their necks and destroy it as decreed . [ b ] 28-29 Look , the mighty armies of Assyria are coming ! Now they are at Aiath , now at Migron ; they are storing some of their equipment at Michmash and crossing over the pass ; they are staying overnight at Geba . Fear strikes the city of Ramah ; all the people of Gibeah—the city of Saul—are running for their lives .
TLB	Isaiah	10	30	Well may you scream in terror , O people of Gallim . Shout out a warning to Laish , for the mighty army comes . O poor Anathoth , what a fate is yours !
TLB	Isaiah	10	31	There go the people of Madmenah , all fleeing , and the citizens of Gebim are preparing to run .
TLB	Isaiah	10	32	But the enemy stops at Nob for the remainder of that day . He shakes his fist at Jerusalem on Mount Zion .
TLB	Isaiah	10	33	Then , look , look ! The Lord , the Lord of the armies of heaven , is chopping down the mighty tree ! He is destroying all of that vast army , great and small alike , both officers and men .
TLB	Isaiah	10	34	He , the Mighty One , will cut down the enemy as a woodsman ’ s ax cuts down the forest trees in Lebanon . Footnotes - Isaiah 10:17 land of Israel , see

TLB	Isaiah	11	11	At that time the Lord will bring back a remnant of his people for the second time , returning them to the land of Israel from Assyria , Upper and Lower Egypt , Ethiopia , Elam , Babylonia , Hamath , and all the distant coastal lands .
TLB	Isaiah	11	2	And the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him , the Spirit of wisdom , understanding , counsel , and might ; the Spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord .
TLB	Isaiah	11	3	His delight will be obedience to the Lord . He will not judge by appearance , false evidence , or hearsay ,
TLB	Isaiah	11	4	but will defend the poor and the exploited . He will rule against the wicked who oppress them .
TLB	Isaiah	11	5	For he will be clothed with fairness and with truth .
TLB	Isaiah	11	6	In that day the wolf and the lamb will lie down together , and the leopard and goats will be at peace . Calves and fat cattle will be safe among lions , and a little child shall lead them all .
TLB	Isaiah	11	7	The cows will graze among bears ; cubs and calves will lie down together , and lions will eat grass like the cows .
TLB	Isaiah	11	8	Babies will crawl safely among poisonous snakes , and a little child who puts his hand in a nest of deadly adders will pull it out unharmed .
TLB	Isaiah	11	9	Nothing will hurt or destroy in all my holy mountain , for as the waters fill the sea , so shall the earth be full of the knowledge of the Lord .
TLB	Isaiah	11	10	In that day he who created the royal dynasty of David [ b ] will be a banner of salvation to all the world . The nations will rally to him , for the land where he lives will be a glorious place .
TLB	Isaiah	11	12	He will raise a flag among the nations for them to rally to ; he will gather the scattered Israelites from the ends of the earth .
TLB	Isaiah	11	13	Then at last the jealousy between Israel and Judah will end ; they will not fight each other anymore .
TLB	Isaiah	11	14	Together they will fly against the nations possessing their land on the east and on the west , uniting forces to destroy them , and they will occupy the nations of Edom and Moab and Ammon .
TLB	Isaiah	11	15	The Lord will dry a path through the Red Sea [ c ] and wave his hand over the Euphrates , sending a mighty wind to divide it into seven streams that can easily be crossed .
TLB	Isaiah	11	16	He will make a highway from Assyria for the remnant there , just as he did for all of Israel long ago when they returned from Egypt .

TLB	Isaiah	13	13	For I will shake the heavens in my wrath and fierce anger , and the earth will move from its place in the skies .
TLB	Isaiah	13	2	See the flags waving as their enemy attacks . Shout to them , O Israel , and wave them on as they march against Babylon to destroy the palaces of the rich and mighty .
TLB	Isaiah	13	3	I , the Lord , have set apart these armies for this task ; I have called those rejoicing in their strength to do this work , to satisfy my anger .
TLB	Isaiah	13	4	Hear the tumult on the mountains ! Listen as the armies march ! It is the tumult and the shout of many nations . The Lord Almighty has brought them here ,
TLB	Isaiah	13	5	from countries far away . They are his weapons against you , O Babylon . They carry his anger with them and will destroy your whole land .
TLB	Isaiah	13	6	Scream in terror , for the Lord ’ s time has come , the time for the Almighty to crush you .
TLB	Isaiah	13	7	Your arms lie paralyzed with fear ; the strongest hearts melt
TLB	Isaiah	13	8	and are afraid . Fear grips you with terrible pangs , like those of a woman in labor . You look at one another , helpless , as the flames of the burning city reflect upon your pallid faces .
TLB	Isaiah	13	9	For see , the day of the Lord is coming , the terrible day of his wrath and fierce anger . The land shall be destroyed and all the sinners with it .
TLB	Isaiah	13	10	The heavens will be black above them . No light will shine from stars or sun or moon .
TLB	Isaiah	13	11	And I will punish the world for its evil , the wicked for their sin ; I will crush the arrogance of the proud man and the haughtiness of the rich .
TLB	Isaiah	13	12	Few will live when I have finished up my work . Men will be as scarce as gold—of greater value than the gold of Ophir .
TLB	Isaiah	13	14	The armies of Babylon will run until exhausted , fleeing back to their own land like deer chased by dogs , wandering like sheep deserted by their shepherd .
TLB	Isaiah	13	15	Those who don ’ t run will be butchered .
TLB	Isaiah	13	16	Their little children will be dashed to death against the pavement right before their eyes ; their homes will be sacked and their wives raped by the attacking hordes .
TLB	Isaiah	13	17	For I will stir up the Medes against Babylon , and no amount of silver or gold will buy them off .
TLB	Isaiah	13	18	The attacking armies will have no mercy on the young people of Babylon or the babies or the children .
TLB	Isaiah	13	19	And so Babylon , the most glorious of kingdoms , the flower of Chaldean culture , will be as utterly destroyed as Sodom and Gomorrah were when God sent fire from heaven ;
TLB	Isaiah	13	20	Babylon will never rise again . Generation after generation will come and go , but the land will never again be lived in . [ a ] The nomads will not even camp there . The shepherds won ’ t let their sheep stay overnight .
TLB	Isaiah	13	21	The wild animals of the desert will make it their home . The houses will be haunted by howling creatures . Ostriches will live there , and the demons will come there to dance .

TLB	Isaiah	14	2	The nations of the world will help them to return , and those coming to live in their land will serve them . Those enslaving Israel will be enslaved—Israel shall rule her enemies !
TLB	Isaiah	14	3	In that wonderful day when the Lord gives his people rest from sorrow and fear , from slavery and chains ,
TLB	Isaiah	14	4	you will jeer at the king of Babylon and say , “ You bully , you ! At last you have what was coming to you !
TLB	Isaiah	14	5	For the Lord has crushed your wicked power and broken your evil rule. ”
TLB	Isaiah	14	6	You persecuted my people with unceasing blows of rage and held the nations in your angry grip . You were unrestrained in tyranny .
TLB	Isaiah	14	7	But at last the whole earth is at rest and is quiet ! All the world begins to sing !
TLB	Isaiah	14	8	Even the trees of the woods—the fir trees and cedars of Lebanon—sing out this joyous song : “ Your power is broken ; no one will bother us now ; at last we have peace. ”
TLB	Isaiah	14	9	The denizens of hell crowd to meet you as you enter their domain . World leaders and earth ’ s mightiest kings , long dead , are there to see you .

TLB	Isaiah	14	11	Your might and power are gone ; they are buried with you . All the pleasant music in your palace has ceased ; now maggots are your sheet , worms your blanket !
TLB	Isaiah	14	12	How you are fallen from heaven , O Lucifer , son of the morning ! How you are cut down to the ground—mighty though you were against the nations of the world .
TLB	Isaiah	14	13	For you said to yourself , “ I will ascend to heaven and rule the angels . [ a ] I will take the highest throne . I will preside on the Mount of Assembly far away in the north .
TLB	Isaiah	14	15	But instead , you will be brought down to the pit of hell , down to its lowest depths .
TLB	Isaiah	14	16	Everyone there will stare at you and ask , “ Can this be the one who shook the earth and the kingdoms of the world ?
TLB	Isaiah	14	17	Can this be the one who destroyed the world and made it into a shambles , who demolished its greatest cities and had no mercy on his prisoners ? ”
TLB	Isaiah	14	18	The kings of the nations lie in stately glory in their graves ,
TLB	Isaiah	14	19	but your body is thrown out like a broken branch ; it lies in an open grave , covered with the dead bodies of those slain in battle . It lies as a carcass in the road , trampled and mangled by horses ’ hoofs .
TLB	Isaiah	14	20	No monument will be given you , for you have destroyed your nation and slain your people . Your son will not succeed you as the king .
TLB	Isaiah	14	21	Slay the children of this sinner . Do not let them rise and conquer the land nor rebuild the cities of the world .
TLB	Isaiah	14	22	I , myself , have risen against him , says the Lord of heaven ’ s armies , and will cut off his children and his children ’ s children from ever sitting on his throne .
TLB	Isaiah	14	23	I will make Babylon into a desolate land of porcupines , full of swamps and marshes . I will sweep the land with the broom of destruction , says the Lord of the armies of heaven .
TLB	Isaiah	14	24	He has taken an oath to do it ! For this is his purpose and plan .
TLB	Isaiah	14	25	I have decided to break the Assyrian army when they are in Israel and to crush them on my mountains ; my people shall no longer be their slaves .
TLB	Isaiah	14	26	This is my plan for the whole earth—I will do it by my mighty power that reaches everywhere around the world .
TLB	Isaiah	14	27	The Lord , the God of battle , has spoken—who can change his plans ? When his hand moves , who can stop him ?
TLB	Isaiah	14	28	This is the message that came to me the year King Ahaz died :
TLB	Isaiah	14	29	Don ’ t rejoice , Philistines , that the king who smote you is dead . [ b ] That rod is broken , yes ; but his son will be a greater scourge to you than his father ever was ! From the snake will be born an adder , a fiery serpent to destroy you !
TLB	Isaiah	14	30	I will shepherd the poor of my people ; they shall graze in my pasture ! The needy shall lie down in peace . But as for you—I will wipe you out with famine and the sword .
TLB	Isaiah	14	31	Weep , Philistine cities—you are doomed . All your nation is doomed . For a perfectly trained army [ c ] is coming down from the north against you .

TLB	Isaiah	15	4	The cries from the cities of Heshbon and Elealeh are heard far away , even in Jahaz . The bravest warriors of Moab cry in utter terror .

Do not turn us over to our foes . 4-5 Let our outcasts stay among you ; hide them from our enemies ! God will reward you for your kindness to us . If you let Moab ’ s fugitives settle among you , then when the terror is past , God will establish David ’ s throne forever , and on that throne he will place a just and righteous King. ”
TLB	Isaiah	16	6	Is this proud Moab , concerning which we heard so much ? His arrogance and insolence are all gone now !
TLB	Isaiah	16	7	Therefore all Moab weeps . Yes , Moab , you will mourn for stricken Kir-hareseth ,
TLB	Isaiah	16	8	and for the abandoned farms of Heshbon and the vineyards at Sibmah . The enemy warlords have cut down the best of the grapevines ; their armies spread out as far as Jazer in the deserts , and even down to the sea .
TLB	Isaiah	16	9	So I wail and lament for Jazer and the vineyards of Sibmah . My tears shall flow for Heshbon and Elealeh , for destruction has come upon their summer fruits and harvests .

TLB	Isaiah	16	11	I will weep , weep , weep , for Moab ; and my sorrow for Kir-hareseth will be very great .
TLB	Isaiah	16	12	The people of Moab will pray in anguish to their idols at the tops of the hills , but it will do no good ; they will cry to their gods in their idol temples , but none will come to save them . 13-14 All this concerning Moab has been said before ; but now the Lord says that within three years , without fail , the glory of Moab shall be ended , and few of all its people will be left alive .

TLB	Isaiah	17	17	This is God ’ s message to Damascus , capital of Syria : Look , Damascus is gone ! It is no longer a city—it has become a heap of ruins !
TLB	Isaiah	17	2	The cities of Aroer are deserted . Sheep pasture there , lying quiet and unafraid , with no one to chase them away .
TLB	Isaiah	17	3	The strength of Israel and the power of Damascus will end , and the remnant of Syria shall be destroyed . For as Israel ’ s glory departed , so theirs , too , will disappear , declares the Lord Almighty .
TLB	Isaiah	17	4	Yes , the glory of Israel will be very dim when poverty stalks the land .
TLB	Isaiah	17	5	Israel will be as abandoned as the harvested grain fields in the valley of Rephaim .
TLB	Isaiah	17	6	Oh , a very few of her people will be left , just as a few stray olives are left on the trees when the harvest is ended , two or three in the highest branches , four or five out on the tips of the limbs .

TLB	Isaiah	17	7	Then at last they will think of God their Creator and have respect for the Holy One of Israel .
TLB	Isaiah	17	8	They will no longer ask their idols for help in that day , neither will they worship what their hands have made ! They will no longer have respect for the images of Ashtaroth and the sun idols .

TLB	Isaiah	19	19	And there will be an altar to the Lord in the heart of Egypt in those days and a monument to the Lord at its border .
TLB	Isaiah	19	2	I will set them to fighting against each other—brother against brother , neighbor against neighbor , city against city , province against province .
TLB	Isaiah	19	3	Her wise counselors are all at their wits ’ end to know what to do ; they plead with their idols for wisdom and call upon mediums , wizards , and witches to show them what to do .
TLB	Isaiah	19	4	I will hand over Egypt to a hard , cruel master , to a vicious king , says the Lord Almighty .

TLB	Isaiah	19	10	Great men and small—all will be crushed and broken .
TLB	Isaiah	19	11	What fools the counselors of Zoan are ! Their best counsel to the king of Egypt is utterly stupid and wrong . Will they still boast of their wisdom ? Will they dare tell Pharaoh about the long line of wise men they have come from ?
TLB	Isaiah	19	12	What has happened to your “ wise counselors , ” O Pharaoh ? Where has their wisdom gone ? If they are wise , let them tell you what the Lord is going to do to Egypt .
TLB	Isaiah	19	13	The “ wise men ” from Zoan are also fools , and those from Memphis are utterly deluded . They are the best you can find , but they have ruined Egypt with their foolish counsel .

TLB	Isaiah	19	15	Egypt can not be saved by anything or anybody—no one can show her the way .
TLB	Isaiah	19	16	In that day the Egyptians will be as weak as women , cowering in fear beneath the upraised fist of God .
TLB	Isaiah	19	17	Just to speak the name of Israel will strike deep terror in their hearts , for the Lord Almighty has laid his plans against them .
TLB	Isaiah	19	18	At that time five of the cities of Egypt will follow the Lord Almighty and will begin to speak the Hebrew language . [ a ] One of these will be Heliopolis , “ The City of the Sun. ”
TLB	Isaiah	19	20	This will be for a sign of loyalty to the Lord Almighty ; then when they cry to the Lord for help against those who oppress them , he will send them a savior—and he shall deliver them .

TLB	Isaiah	20	2	the Lord told Isaiah , the son of Amoz , to take off his clothing , including his shoes , and to walk around naked and barefoot . And Isaiah did as he was told .
TLB	Isaiah	20	3	Then the Lord said , My servant Isaiah , who has been walking naked and barefoot for the last three years , is a symbol of the terrible troubles I will bring upon Egypt and Ethiopia .
TLB	Isaiah	20	4	For the king of Assyria will take away the Egyptians and Ethiopians as prisoners , making them walk naked and barefoot , both young and old , their buttocks uncovered , to the shame of Egypt . 5-6 Then how dismayed the Philistines [ a ] will be , who counted on “ Ethiopia ’ s power ” and their “ glorious ally , ” Egypt !

TLB	Isaiah	21	2	I see an awesome vision : oh , the horror of it all ! God is telling me what he is going to do . I see you plundered and destroyed . Elamites and Medes will take part in the siege . Babylon will fall , and the groaning of all the nations she enslaved will end .
TLB	Isaiah	21	3	My stomach constricts and burns with pain ; sharp pangs of horror are upon me , like the pangs of a woman giving birth to a child . I faint when I hear what God is planning ; I am terrified , blinded with dismay .
TLB	Isaiah	21	4	My mind reels ; my heart races ; I am gripped by awful fear . All rest at night—so pleasant once—is gone ; I lie awake , trembling .

TLB	Isaiah	22	22	I will give him responsibility over all my people ; whatever he says will be done ; none will be able to stop him . 23-24 I will make of him a strong and steady peg to support my people ; they will load him with responsibility , and he will be an honor to his family name. ”
TLB	Isaiah	22	2	The whole city is in terrible uproar . What ’ s the trouble in this busy , happy city ? [ b ] Bodies ! Lying everywhere , slain by plague and not by sword .
TLB	Isaiah	22	3	All your leaders flee ; they surrender without resistance . The people slip away but they are captured too .
TLB	Isaiah	22	4	Leave me alone to weep . Don ’ t try to comfort me—let me cry for my people as I watch them being destroyed .
TLB	Isaiah	22	5	Oh , what a day of crushing trouble ! What a day of confusion and terror from the Lord God of heaven ’ s armies ! The walls of Jerusalem are breached , and the cry of death echoes from the mountainsides . 6-7 Elamites are the archers ; Syrians drive the chariots ; the men of Kir hold up the shields . They fill your choicest valleys and crowd against your gates .
TLB	Isaiah	22	8	God has removed his protecting care . You run to the armory for your weapons ! 9-11 You inspect the walls of Jerusalem to see what needs repair ! You check over the houses and tear some down for stone for fixing walls . Between the city walls , you build a reservoir for water from the lower pool ! But all your feverish plans will not avail , for you never ask for help from God , who lets this come upon you . He is the one who planned it long ago .
TLB	Isaiah	22	12	The Lord God called you to repent , to weep and mourn , to shave your heads in sorrow for your sins , and to wear clothes made of sackcloth to show your remorse .
TLB	Isaiah	22	13	But instead , you sing and dance and play , and feast and drink . “ Let us eat , drink , and be merry , ” you say : “ What ’ s the difference , for tomorrow we die. ”
TLB	Isaiah	22	14	The Lord Almighty has revealed to me that this sin will never be forgiven you until the day you die . 15-16 Furthermore , the same Lord God of the armies of heaven has told me this : Go and say to Shebna , the palace administrator : “ And who do you think you are , building this beautiful sepulchre in the rock for yourself ?
TLB	Isaiah	22	17	For the Lord who allowed you to be clothed so gorgeously will hurl you away , sending you into captivity , O strong man !
TLB	Isaiah	22	18	He will wad you up in his hands like a ball and toss you away into a distant , barren land ; there you will die , O glorious one—you who disgrace your nation !
TLB	Isaiah	22	19	“ Yes , I will drive you out of office , ” says the Lord , “ and pull you down from your high position .
TLB	Isaiah	22	20	And then I will call my servant Eliakim , the son of Hilkiah , to replace you .
TLB	Isaiah	22	21	He shall have your uniform and title and authority , and he will be a father to the people of Jerusalem and all Judah .
TLB	Isaiah	22	25	But the Lord will pull out that other peg that seems to be so firmly fastened to the wall !

TLB	Isaiah	23	23	This is God ’ s message to Tyre : Weep , O ships of Tyre , [ a ] returning home from distant lands ! Weep for your harbor , for it is gone ! The rumors that you heard in Cyprus are all true . 2-3 Deathly silence is everywhere . Stillness reigns where once your hustling port was full of ships from Sidon , bringing merchandise from far across the ocean , from Egypt and along the Nile . You were the merchandise mart of the world .

TLB	Isaiah	23	5	When Egypt hears the news , there will be great sorrow .
TLB	Isaiah	23	6	Flee to Tarshish , men of Tyre , weeping as you go .
TLB	Isaiah	23	7	This silent ruin is all that ’ s left of your once joyous land . What a history was yours ! Think of all the colonists you sent to distant lands !
TLB	Isaiah	23	8	Who has brought this disaster on Tyre , empire builder and top trader of the world ?
TLB	Isaiah	23	9	The Commander of the armies of heaven has done it to destroy your pride and show his contempt for all the greatness of mankind .
TLB	Isaiah	23	10	Sail on , O ships of Tarshish , for your harbor is gone .
TLB	Isaiah	23	11	The Lord holds out his hand over the seas ; he shakes the kingdoms of the earth ; he has spoken out against this great merchant city , to destroy its strength .
TLB	Isaiah	23	12	He says , “ Never again , O dishonored virgin , daughter of Sidon , will you rejoice , will you be strong . Even if you flee to Cyprus , you will find no rest. ”
TLB	Isaiah	23	13	It will be the Babylonians , not the Assyrians , who consign Tyre to the wild beasts . They will lay siege to it , raze its palaces , and make it a heap of ruins .
TLB	Isaiah	23	14	Wail , you ships that ply the oceans , for your home port is destroyed ! 15-16 For seventy years Tyre will be forgotten . Then , in the days of another king , the city will come back to life again ; she will sing sweet songs as a harlot sings who , long absent from her lovers , walks the streets to look for them again and is remembered .
TLB	Isaiah	23	17	Yes , after seventy years , the Lord will revive Tyre , but she will be no different than she was before ; she will return again to all her evil ways around the world .
TLB	Isaiah	23	18	Yet the distant time will come when [ b ] her businesses will give their profits to the Lord ! They will not be hoarded but used for good food and fine clothes for the priests of the Lord ! Footnotes - Isaiah 23:1 Tyre . Tyre was originally a colony of the mother city , Sidon . Also in v.

TLB	Isaiah	24	24	Look ! The Lord is overturning the land of Judah and making it a vast wasteland of destruction . See how he is emptying out all its people and scattering them over the face of the earth .
TLB	Isaiah	24	2	Priests and people , servants and masters , slave girls and mistresses , buyers and sellers , lenders and borrowers , bankers and debtors—none will be spared .
TLB	Isaiah	24	3	The land will be completely emptied and looted . The Lord has spoken . 4-5 The land suffers for the sins of its people . The earth languishes , the crops wither , the skies refuse their rain . The land is defiled by crime ; the people have twisted the laws of God and broken his everlasting commands .
TLB	Isaiah	24	6	Therefore the curse of God is upon them ; they are left desolate , destroyed by the drought . Few will be left alive .
TLB	Isaiah	24	7	All the joys of life will go : the grape harvest will fail , the wine will be gone , the merrymakers will sigh and mourn .
TLB	Isaiah	24	8	The melodious chords of the harp and timbrel are heard no more ; the happy days are ended .
TLB	Isaiah	24	9	No more are the joys of wine and song ; strong drink turns bitter in the mouth .
TLB	Isaiah	24	10	The city lies in chaos ; every home and shop is locked up tight to keep out looters .
TLB	Isaiah	24	11	Mobs form in the streets , crying for wine ; joy has reached its lowest ebb ; gladness has been banished from the land .
TLB	Isaiah	24	12	The city is left in ruins ; its gates are battered down .
TLB	Isaiah	24	13	Throughout the land [ a ] the story is the same—only a remnant is left .
TLB	Isaiah	24	14	But all who are left will shout and sing for joy ; those in the west will praise the majesty of God , 15-16 and those in the east will respond with praise . Hear them singing to the Lord from the ends of the earth , singing glory to the Righteous One ! But my heart is heavy with grief , for evil still prevails and treachery is everywhere .
TLB	Isaiah	24	17	Terror and the captivity of hell are still your lot , O men of the world .
TLB	Isaiah	24	18	When you flee in terror , you will fall into a pit , and if you escape from the pit , you will step into a trap , for destruction falls from the heavens upon you ; the world is shaken beneath you .
TLB	Isaiah	24	19	The earth has broken down in utter collapse ; everything is lost , abandoned , and confused .
TLB	Isaiah	24	20	The world staggers like a drunkard ; it shakes like a tent in a storm . It falls and will not rise again , for the sins of the earth are very great .
TLB	Isaiah	24	21	On that day the Lord will punish the fallen angels in the heavens and the proud rulers of the nations on earth .
TLB	Isaiah	24	22	They will be rounded up like prisoners and imprisoned in a dungeon until they are tried and condemned .
TLB	Isaiah	24	23	Then the Lord of heaven ’ s armies will mount his throne in Zion and rule gloriously in Jerusalem , in the sight of all the elders of his people . Such glory there will be that all the brightness of the sun and moon will seem to fade away .

TLB	Isaiah	25	2	You turn mighty cities into heaps of ruins . The strongest forts are turned to rubble . Beautiful palaces in distant lands disappear and will never be rebuilt .
TLB	Isaiah	25	3	Therefore strong nations will shake with fear before you ; ruthless nations will obey and glorify your name .
TLB	Isaiah	25	4	But to the poor , O Lord , you are a refuge from the storm , a shadow from the heat , a shelter from merciless men who are like a driving rain that melts down an earthen wall .
TLB	Isaiah	25	5	As a hot , dry land is cooled by clouds , you will cool the pride of ruthless nations .
TLB	Isaiah	25	6	Here on Mount Zion in Jerusalem , the Lord Almighty will spread a wondrous feast for everyone around the world—a delicious feast of good food , with clear , well-aged wine and choice beef .

TLB	Isaiah	26	7	But for good men the path is not uphill and rough ! God does not give them a rough and treacherous path , but smooths the road before them .
TLB	Isaiah	26	8	O Lord , we love to do your will ! Our hearts ’ desire is to glorify your name .
TLB	Isaiah	26	9	All night long I search for you ; earnestly I seek for God ; for only when you come in judgment on the earth to punish it will people turn away from wickedness and do what is right .
TLB	Isaiah	26	10	Your kindness to the wicked doesn ’ t make them good ; they keep on doing wrong and take no notice of your majesty .
TLB	Isaiah	26	11	They do not listen when you threaten ; they will not look to see your upraised fist . Show them how much you love your people . Perhaps then they will be ashamed ! Yes , let them be burned up by the fire reserved for your enemies .
TLB	Isaiah	26	12	Lord , grant us peace ; for all we have and are has come from you .
TLB	Isaiah	26	13	O Lord our God , once we worshiped other gods ; but now we worship you alone .
TLB	Isaiah	26	14	Those we served before are dead and gone ; never again will they return . You came against them and destroyed them , and they are long forgotten .
TLB	Isaiah	26	15	O praise the Lord ! He has made our nation very great . He has widened the boundaries of our land !
TLB	Isaiah	26	16	Lord , in their distress they sought for you . When your punishment was on them , they poured forth a whispered prayer .
TLB	Isaiah	26	17	How we missed your presence , Lord ! We suffered as a woman giving birth who cries and writhes in pain .
TLB	Isaiah	26	18	We too have writhed in agony , but all to no avail . No deliverance has come from all our efforts .
TLB	Isaiah	26	19	Yet we have this assurance : Those who belong to God shall live again . Their bodies shall rise again ! Those who dwell in the dust shall awake and sing for joy ! For God ’ s light of life will fall like dew upon them !
TLB	Isaiah	26	20	Go home , my people , and lock the doors ! Hide for a little while until the Lord ’ s wrath against your enemies has passed .

TLB	Isaiah	27	27	In that day the Lord will take his terrible , swift sword and punish leviathan , the swiftly moving serpent , the coiling , writhing serpent , the dragon of the sea .
TLB	Isaiah	27	2	In that day of Israel ’ s freedom [ a ] let this anthem be their song :
TLB	Isaiah	27	3	Israel [ b ] is my vineyard ; I , the Lord , will tend the fruitful vines ; every day I ’ ll water them , and day and night I ’ ll watch to keep all enemies away . 4-5 My anger against Israel is gone . If I find thorns and briars bothering her , I will burn them up , unless these enemies of mine surrender and beg for peace and my protection .
TLB	Isaiah	27	6	The time will come when Israel will take root and bud and blossom and fill the whole earth with her fruit ! 7-8 Has God punished Israel as much as he has punished her enemies ? No , for he has devastated her enemies , [ c ] while he has punished Israel but a little , exiling her far from her own land as though blown away in a storm from the east .
TLB	Isaiah	27	9	And why did God do it ? It was to purge away [ d ] her sins , to rid her of all her idol altars and her idols . They will never be worshiped again .
TLB	Isaiah	27	10	Her walled cities will be silent and empty , houses abandoned , streets grown up with grass , cows grazing through the city munching on twigs and branches .
TLB	Isaiah	27	11	My people are like the dead branches of a tree , broken off and used to burn beneath the pots . They are a foolish nation , a witless , stupid people , for they turn away from God . Therefore , he who made them will not have pity on them or show them his mercy .
TLB	Isaiah	27	12	Yet the time will come when the Lord will gather them together one by one like hand-picked grain , selecting them here and there from his great threshing floor that reaches all the way from the Euphrates River to the Egyptian boundary .
TLB	Isaiah	27	13	In that day the great trumpet will be blown , and many about to perish among their enemies , Assyria and Egypt , will be rescued and brought back to Jerusalem to worship the Lord in his holy mountain .

TLB	Isaiah	28	28	Bread grain is easily crushed , so he doesn ’ t keep on pounding it .
TLB	Isaiah	28	2	For the Lord will send a mighty army ( the Assyrians ) against you ; like a mighty hailstorm he will burst upon you and dash you to the ground .
TLB	Isaiah	28	3	The proud city of Samaria—yes , the joy and delight of the drunkards of Israel—will be hurled to the ground and trampled beneath the enemies ’ feet .
TLB	Isaiah	28	4	Once glorious , her fading beauty surrounded by a fertile valley will suddenly be gone , greedily snatched away as an early fig is hungrily snatched and gobbled up !
TLB	Isaiah	28	5	Then at last the Lord Almighty himself will be their crowning glory , the diadem of beauty to his people who are left .
TLB	Isaiah	28	6	He will give a longing for justice to your judges and great courage to your soldiers who are battling to the last before your gates .
TLB	Isaiah	28	7	But Jerusalem is now led by drunks ! Her priests and prophets reel and stagger , making stupid errors and mistakes .
TLB	Isaiah	28	8	Their tables are covered with vomit ; filth is everywhere .
TLB	Isaiah	28	9	“ Who does Isaiah think he is , ” the people say , “ to speak to us like this ! Are we little children , barely old enough to talk ?
TLB	Isaiah	28	10	He tells us everything over and over again , a line at a time and in such simple words ! ”
TLB	Isaiah	28	11	But they won ’ t listen ; the only language they can understand is punishment ! So God will punish them by sending against them foreigners who speak strange gibberish ! Only then will they listen to him !
TLB	Isaiah	28	12	They could have rest in their own land if they would obey him , if they were kind and good . He told them that , but they wouldn ’ t listen to him .
TLB	Isaiah	28	13	So the Lord will spell it out for them again , repeating it over and over in simple words whenever he can ; yet over this simple , straightforward message they will stumble and fall and be broken , trapped and captured .
TLB	Isaiah	28	14	Therefore hear the word of the Lord , you scoffing rulers in Jerusalem :
TLB	Isaiah	28	15	You have struck a bargain with death , you say , and sold yourselves to the devil [ a ] in exchange for his protection against the Assyrians . “ They can never touch us , ” you say , “ for we are under the care of one who will deceive and fool them. ”
TLB	Isaiah	28	16	But the Lord God says , “ See , I am placing a Foundation Stone in Zion—a firm , tested , precious Cornerstone that is safe to build on . He who believes need never run away again .
TLB	Isaiah	28	17	I will take the line and plummet of justice to check the foundation wall you built ; it looks so fine , but it is so weak a storm of hail will knock it down ! The enemy will come like a flood and sweep it away , and you will be drowned .
TLB	Isaiah	28	18	I will cancel your agreement of compromise with death and the devil , so when the terrible enemy floods in , you will be trampled into the ground .
TLB	Isaiah	28	19	Again and again that flood will come and carry you off , until at last the unmixed horror of the truth of my warnings will finally dawn on you. ”
TLB	Isaiah	28	20	The bed you have made is far too short to lie on ; the blankets are too narrow to cover you .
TLB	Isaiah	28	21	The Lord will come suddenly and in anger , as at Mount Perazim and Gibeon , to do a strange , unusual thing—to destroy his own people !
TLB	Isaiah	28	22	So scoff no more , lest your punishment be made even greater , for the Lord God has plainly told me that he is determined to crush you . 23-24 Listen to me , listen as I plead : Does a farmer always plow and never sow ? Is he forever harrowing the soil and never planting it ?
TLB	Isaiah	28	25	Does he not finally plant his many kinds of grain , each in its own section of his land ?
TLB	Isaiah	28	26	He knows just what to do , for God has made him see and understand .
TLB	Isaiah	28	27	He doesn ’ t thresh all grains the same . A sledge is never used on dill , but it is beaten with a stick . A threshing wheel is never rolled on cummin , but it is beaten softly with a flail .
TLB	Isaiah	28	29	The Lord Almighty is a wonderful teacher and gives the farmer wisdom . Footnotes - Isaiah 28:15 to the devil , literally , “ with Sheol , ” “ the underworld. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Isaiah	29	29	Woe to Jerusalem , [ a ] the city of David . Year after year you make your many offerings ,
TLB	Isaiah	29	2	but I will send heavy judgment upon you , and there will be weeping and sorrow . For Jerusalem shall become as her name “ Ariel ” means—an altar covered with blood .
TLB	Isaiah	29	3	I will be your enemy . I will surround Jerusalem and lay siege against it , and build forts around it to destroy it .
TLB	Isaiah	29	4	Your voice will whisper like a ghost from the earth where you lie buried .
TLB	Isaiah	29	5	But suddenly your ruthless enemies will be driven away like chaff before the wind .
TLB	Isaiah	29	6	In an instant , I , the Lord of Hosts , will come upon them with thunder , earthquake , whirlwind , and fire .
TLB	Isaiah	29	7	And all the nations fighting Jerusalem will vanish like a dream !
TLB	Isaiah	29	8	As a hungry man dreams of eating but is still hungry , and as a thirsty man dreams of drinking but is still faint from thirst when he wakes up , so your enemies will dream of victorious conquest , but all to no avail .
TLB	Isaiah	29	9	You are amazed , incredulous ? You don ’ t believe it ? Then go ahead and be blind if you must ! You are stupid—and not from drinking , either ! Stagger , and not from wine !
TLB	Isaiah	29	10	For the Lord has poured out upon you a spirit of deep sleep . He has closed the eyes of your prophets and seers ,
TLB	Isaiah	29	11	so all of these future events are a sealed book to them . When you give it to one who can read , he says , “ I can ’ t , for it ’ s sealed. ”
TLB	Isaiah	29	12	When you give it to another , he says , “ Sorry , I can ’ t read. ”
TLB	Isaiah	29	13	And so the Lord says , “ Since these people say they are mine but they do not obey me , and since their worship amounts to mere words learned by rote ,
TLB	Isaiah	29	14	therefore I will take awesome vengeance on these hypocrites and make their wisest counselors as fools. ”
TLB	Isaiah	29	15	Woe to those who try to hide their plans from God , who try to keep him in the dark concerning what they do ! “ God can ’ t see us , ” they say to themselves . “ He doesn ’ t know what is going on ! ”
TLB	Isaiah	29	16	How stupid can they be ! Isn ’ t he , the Potter , greater than you , the jars he makes ? Will you say to him , “ He didn ’ t make us ” ? Does a machine call its inventor dumb ?
TLB	Isaiah	29	17	Soon—and it will not be very long—the wilderness of Lebanon will be a fruitful field again , a lush and fertile forest .
TLB	Isaiah	29	18	In that day the deaf will hear the words of a book , and out of their gloom and darkness the blind will see my plans .
TLB	Isaiah	29	19	The meek will be filled with fresh joy from the Lord , and the poor shall exult in the Holy One of Israel .
TLB	Isaiah	29	20	Bullies will vanish and scoffers will cease , and all those plotting evil will be killed—
TLB	Isaiah	29	21	the violent man who fights at the drop of a hat , the man who waits in hiding to beat up the judge who sentenced him , and the men who use any excuse to be unfair .
TLB	Isaiah	29	22	That is why the Lord who redeemed Abraham says : “ My people will no longer pale with fear or be ashamed .
TLB	Isaiah	29	23	For when they see the surging birthrate and the expanding economy , [ b ] then they will fear and rejoice in my name ; they will praise the Holy One of Israel and stand in awe of him .
TLB	Isaiah	29	24	Those in error will believe the truth , and complainers will be willing to be taught !

TLB	Isaiah	30	30	And the Lord shall cause his majestic voice to be heard and shall crush down his mighty arm upon his enemies with angry indignation and devouring flames , with tornados , terrible storms , and huge hailstones .
TLB	Isaiah	30	2	For without consulting me you have gone down to Egypt to find aid and have put your trust in Pharaoh for his protection . [ a ]
TLB	Isaiah	30	3	But in trusting Pharaoh , you will be disappointed , humiliated and disgraced , for he can ’ t deliver on his promises to save you .
TLB	Isaiah	30	4	For though his power extends to Zoan and Hanes ,
TLB	Isaiah	30	5	yet it will all turn out to your shame—he won ’ t help one little bit !
TLB	Isaiah	30	6	See them moving slowly across the terrible desert to Egypt—donkeys and camels laden down with treasure to pay for Egypt ’ s aid . On through the badlands they go , where lions and swift venomous snakes live—and Egypt will give you nothing in return !
TLB	Isaiah	30	7	For Egypt ’ s promises are worthless ! “ The Reluctant Dragon , ” [ b ] I call her !
TLB	Isaiah	30	8	Now go and write down this word of mine concerning Egypt , so that it will stand until the end of time , forever and forever , as an indictment of Israel ’ s unbelief .
TLB	Isaiah	30	9	For if you don ’ t write it , they will claim I never warned them . “ Oh no , ” they ’ ll say , “ you never told us that ! ” For they are stubborn rebels . 10-11 They tell my prophets , “ Shut up—we don ’ t want any more of your reports ! ” Or they say , “ Don ’ t tell us the truth ; tell us nice things ; tell us lies . Forget all this gloom ; we ’ ve heard more than enough about your ‘ Holy One of Israel ’ and all he says. ”
TLB	Isaiah	30	12	This is the reply of the Holy One of Israel : Because you despise what I tell you and trust instead in frauds and lies and won ’ t repent ,
TLB	Isaiah	30	13	therefore calamity will come upon you suddenly , as upon a bulging wall that bursts and falls ; in one moment it comes crashing down .
TLB	Isaiah	30	14	God will smash you like a broken dish ; he will not act sparingly . Not a piece will be left large enough to use for carrying coals from the hearth , or a little water from the well .
TLB	Isaiah	30	15	For the Lord God , the Holy One of Israel , says : Only in returning to me and waiting for me will you be saved ; in quietness and confidence is your strength ; but you ’ ll have none of this .
TLB	Isaiah	30	16	“ No , ” you say . “ We will get our help from Egypt ; they will give us swift horses for riding to battle. ” But the only swiftness you are going to see is the swiftness of your enemies chasing you !
TLB	Isaiah	30	17	One of them will chase a thousand of you ! Five of them will scatter you until not two of you are left together . You will be like lonely trees on the distant mountaintops .
TLB	Isaiah	30	18	Yet the Lord still waits for you to come to him so he can show you his love ; he will conquer you to bless you , just as he said . For the Lord is faithful to his promises . Blessed are all those who wait for him to help them .
TLB	Isaiah	30	19	O my people in Jerusalem , you shall weep no more , for he will surely be gracious to you at the sound of your cry . He will answer you .
TLB	Isaiah	30	20	Though he give you the bread of adversity and water of affliction , yet he will be with you to teach you—with your own eyes you will see your Teacher .
TLB	Isaiah	30	21	And if you leave God ’ s paths and go astray , you will hear a voice behind you say , “ No , this is the way ; walk here. ”
TLB	Isaiah	30	22	And you will destroy all your silver idols and gold images and cast them out like filthy things you hate to touch . “ Ugh ! ” you ’ ll say to them . “ Be gone ! ”
TLB	Isaiah	30	23	Then God will bless you with rain at planting time and with wonderful harvests and with ample pastures for your cows .
TLB	Isaiah	30	24	The oxen and young donkeys that till the ground will eat grain , its chaff blown away by the wind .
TLB	Isaiah	30	25	In that day when God steps in to destroy your enemies , he will give you streams of water flowing down each mountain and every hill .
TLB	Isaiah	30	26	The moon will be as bright as the sun , and the sunlight brighter than seven days ! So it will be when the Lord begins to heal his people and to cure the wounds he gave them .
TLB	Isaiah	30	27	See , the Lord comes from afar , aflame with wrath , surrounded by thick rising smoke . His lips are filled with fury ; his words consume like fire .
TLB	Isaiah	30	28	His wrath pours out like floods upon them all , to sweep them all away . He will sift out the proud nations and bridle them and lead them off to their doom .
TLB	Isaiah	30	29	But the people of God will sing a song of solemn joy , like songs in the night when holy feasts are held ; his people will have gladness of heart , as when a flutist leads a pilgrim band to Jerusalem to the mountain of the Lord , the Rock of Israel .
TLB	Isaiah	30	31	The voice of the Lord shall punish the Assyrians , who had been his rod of punishment .
TLB	Isaiah	30	32	And when the Lord smites them , his people will rejoice with music and song .
TLB	Isaiah	30	33	The funeral pyre has long been ready , prepared for Molech , the Assyrian god ; it is piled high with wood . The breath of the Lord , like fire from a volcano , will set it all on fire .

TLB	Isaiah	31	31	Woe to those who run to Egypt for help , trusting their mighty cavalry and chariots instead of looking to the Holy One of Israel and consulting him .
TLB	Isaiah	31	2	In his wisdom , he will send great evil on his people and will not change his mind . He will rise against them for the evil they have done and crush their allies too .
TLB	Isaiah	31	3	For these Egyptians are mere men , not God ! Their horses are puny flesh , not mighty spirits ! When the Lord clenches his fist against them , they will stumble and fall among those they are trying to help . All will fail together . 4-5 But the Lord has told me this : When a lion , even a young one , kills a sheep , he pays no attention to the shepherd ’ s shouts and noise . He goes right on and eats . In such manner the Lord will come and fight upon Mount Zion . He will not be frightened away ! He , the Lord Almighty , will hover over Jerusalem as birds hover round their nests , and he will defend the city and deliver it .
TLB	Isaiah	31	6	Therefore , O my people , though you are such wicked rebels , come , return to God .
TLB	Isaiah	31	7	I know the glorious day will come when every one of you will throw away his gold idols and silver images—which in your sinfulness you have made .
TLB	Isaiah	31	8	The Assyrians will be destroyed , but not by swords of men . The “ sword of God ” will smite them . They will panic and flee , and the strong young Assyrians will be taken away as slaves .
TLB	Isaiah	31	9	Even their generals will quake with terror and flee when they see the battle flags of Israel , says the Lord . For the flame of God burns brightly in Jerusalem . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Isaiah	32	32	Look , a righteous King is coming , with honest princes !
TLB	Isaiah	32	2	He will shelter Israel from the storm and wind . He will refresh her as a river in the desert and as the cooling shadow of a mighty rock within a hot and weary land .
TLB	Isaiah	32	3	Then at last the eyes of Israel will open wide to God ; his people will listen to his voice .
TLB	Isaiah	32	4	Even the hotheads among them will be full of sense and understanding , and those who stammer in uncertainty will speak out plainly .
TLB	Isaiah	32	5	In those days the ungodly , the atheists , will not be heroes ! Wealthy cheaters will not be spoken of as generous , outstanding men !
TLB	Isaiah	32	6	Everyone will recognize an evil man when he sees him , and hypocrites will fool no one at all . Their lies about God and their cheating of the hungry will be plain for all to see .
TLB	Isaiah	32	7	The smooth tricks of evil men will be exposed , as will all the lies they use to oppress the poor in the courts .
TLB	Isaiah	32	8	But good men will be generous to others and will be blessed of God for all they do .
TLB	Isaiah	32	9	Listen , you women who loll around in lazy ease ; listen to me and I will tell you your reward :
TLB	Isaiah	32	10	In a short time—in just a little more than a year—suddenly you ’ ll care , O careless ones . For the crops of fruit will fail ; the harvest will not take place .
TLB	Isaiah	32	11	Tremble , O women of ease ; throw off your unconcern . Strip off your pretty clothes—wear sackcloth for your grief .
TLB	Isaiah	32	12	Beat your breasts in sorrow for those bountiful farms of yours that will soon be gone , and for those fruitful vines of other years .
TLB	Isaiah	32	13	For your lands will thrive with thorns and briars ; your joyous homes and happy cities will be gone .
TLB	Isaiah	32	14	Palaces and mansions will all be deserted , the crowded cities empty . Wild herds of donkeys and goats will graze upon the mountains where the watchtowers are ,
TLB	Isaiah	32	15	until at last the Spirit is poured down on us from heaven . Then once again enormous crops will come .
TLB	Isaiah	32	16	Then justice will rule through all the land ,
TLB	Isaiah	32	17	and out of justice , peace . Quietness and confidence will reign forever more .
TLB	Isaiah	32	18	My people will live in safety , quietly at home ,
TLB	Isaiah	32	19	but the Assyrians [ a ] will be destroyed and their cities laid low .

TLB	Isaiah	33	33	Woe to you , Assyrians , [ a ] who have destroyed everything around you but have never felt destruction for yourselves . You expect others to respect their promises to you , while you betray them ! Now you , too , will be betrayed and destroyed .

TLB	Isaiah	33	3	The enemy runs at the sound of your voice . When you stand up , the nations flee .
TLB	Isaiah	33	4	Just as locusts strip the fields and vines , so Jerusalem will strip the fallen army of Assyria ! [ b ]
TLB	Isaiah	33	5	The Lord is very great and lives in heaven . He will make Jerusalem the home of justice and goodness and righteousness .
TLB	Isaiah	33	6	An abundance of salvation is stored up for Judah in a safe place , along with wisdom and knowledge and reverence for God .
TLB	Isaiah	33	7	But now your ambassadors weep in bitter disappointment , for Assyria has refused their cry for peace .
TLB	Isaiah	33	8	Your roads lie in ruins ; travelers detour on back roads . The Assyrians have broken their peace pact [ c ] and care nothing for the promises they made in the presence of witnesses—they have no respect for anyone .
TLB	Isaiah	33	9	All the land of Israel is in trouble ; Lebanon has been destroyed ; Sharon has become a wilderness ; Bashan and Carmel are plundered .
TLB	Isaiah	33	10	But the Lord says : I will stand up and show my power and might .
TLB	Isaiah	33	11	You Assyrians will gain nothing by all your efforts . Your own breath will turn to fire and kill you .
TLB	Isaiah	33	12	Your armies will be burned to lime , like thorns cut down and tossed in the fire .
TLB	Isaiah	33	13	Listen to what I have done , O nations far away ! And you that are near , acknowledge my might !
TLB	Isaiah	33	14	The sinners among my people shake with fear . “ Which one of us , ” they cry , “ can live here in the presence of this all-consuming , everlasting fire ? ”
TLB	Isaiah	33	15	I will tell you who can live here : All who are honest and fair , who reject making profit by fraud , who hold back their hands from taking bribes , who refuse to listen to those who plot murder , who shut their eyes to all enticement to do wrong .
TLB	Isaiah	33	16	Such as these shall dwell on high . The rocks of the mountains will be their fortress of safety ; food will be supplied to them , and they will have all the water they need .
TLB	Isaiah	33	17	Your eyes will see the King in his beauty and the highlands of heaven far away .
TLB	Isaiah	33	18	Your mind will think back to this time of terror when the Assyrian officers outside your walls are counting your towers and estimating how much they will get from your fallen city .
TLB	Isaiah	33	19	But soon they will all be gone . These fierce , violent people with a strange , jabbering language you can ’ t understand will disappear .
TLB	Isaiah	33	20	Instead you will see Jerusalem at peace , a place where God is worshiped , a city quiet and unmoved .
TLB	Isaiah	33	21	The glorious Lord will be to us as a wide river of protection , and no enemy can cross .
TLB	Isaiah	33	22	For the Lord is our Judge , our Lawgiver and our King ; he will care for us and save us .
TLB	Isaiah	33	23	The enemies ’ sails hang loose on broken masts with useless tackle . Their treasure will be divided by the people of God ; even the lame will win their share .
TLB	Isaiah	33	24	The people of Israel will no longer say , “ We are sick and helpless , ” for the Lord will forgive them their sins and bless them . Footnotes - Isaiah 33:1 Assyrians , implied . - Isaiah 33:4 fallen army of Assyria , see

TLB	Isaiah	34	34	Come here and listen , O nations of the earth ; let the world and everything in it hear my words .
TLB	Isaiah	34	2	For the Lord is enraged against the nations ; his fury is against their armies . He will utterly destroy them and deliver them to slaughter .
TLB	Isaiah	34	3	Their dead will be left unburied , and the stench of rotting bodies will fill the land ; the mountains will flow with their blood .
TLB	Isaiah	34	4	At that time the heavens above will melt away and disappear just like a rolled-up scroll , and the stars will fall as leaves , as ripe fruit from the trees .
TLB	Isaiah	34	5	And when my sword has finished its work in the heavens , then watch , for it will fall upon Edom , the people I have doomed .
TLB	Isaiah	34	6	The sword of the Lord is sated with blood ; it is gorged with flesh as though used for slaying lambs and goats for sacrifice . For the Lord will slay a great sacrifice in Edom and make a mighty slaughter there .
TLB	Isaiah	34	7	The strongest will perish , young boys and veterans too . The land will be soaked with blood , and the soil made rich with fat .
TLB	Isaiah	34	8	For it is the day of vengeance , the year of recompense for what Edom has done to Israel .
TLB	Isaiah	34	9	The streams of Edom will be filled with burning pitch , and the ground will be covered with fire .
TLB	Isaiah	34	10	This judgment on Edom will never end . Its smoke will rise up forever . The land will lie deserted from generation to generation ; no one will live there anymore .
TLB	Isaiah	34	11	There the hawks and porcupines will live , and owls and ravens . For God will observe that land and find it worthy of destruction . He will test its nobles and find them worthy of death .
TLB	Isaiah	34	12	It will be called “ The Land of Nothing , ” and its princes soon will all be gone .
TLB	Isaiah	34	13	Thorns will overrun the palaces , nettles will grow in its forts , and it will become the haunt of jackals and a home for ostriches .
TLB	Isaiah	34	14	The wild animals of the desert will mingle there with wolves and hyenas . Their howls will fill the night . There the night-monsters will scream at each other , and the demons will come there to rest .
TLB	Isaiah	34	15	There the owl will make her nest and lay her eggs ; she will hatch her young and nestle them beneath her wings , and the kites will come , each one with its mate .
TLB	Isaiah	34	16	Search the book of the Lord and see all that he will do ; not one detail will he miss ; not one kite will be there without a mate , for the Lord has said it , and his Spirit will make it all come true .

TLB	Isaiah	35	35	Even the wilderness and desert will rejoice in those days ; the desert will blossom with flowers .
TLB	Isaiah	35	2	Yes , there will be an abundance of flowers and singing and joy ! The deserts will become as green as the Lebanon mountains , as lovely as Mount Carmel ’ s pastures and Sharon ’ s meadows ; for the Lord will display his glory there , the excellency of our God .
TLB	Isaiah	35	3	With this news bring cheer to all discouraged ones .
TLB	Isaiah	35	4	Encourage those who are afraid . Tell them , “ Be strong , fear not , for your God is coming to destroy your enemies . He is coming to save you. ”
TLB	Isaiah	35	5	And when he comes , he will open the eyes of the blind and unstop the ears of the deaf .
TLB	Isaiah	35	6	The lame man will leap up like a deer , and those who could not speak will shout and sing ! Springs will burst forth in the wilderness , and streams in the desert .

TLB	Isaiah	36	36	So in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah ’ s reign , Sennacherib , king of Assyria , came to fight against the walled cities of Judah and conquered them .
TLB	Isaiah	36	2	Then he sent his personal representative with a great army from Lachish to confer with King Hezekiah in Jerusalem . He camped near the outlet of the upper pool , along the road going past the field where cloth is bleached .
TLB	Isaiah	36	3	Then Eliakim , Hilkiah ’ s son , who was the prime minister of Israel , and Shebna , the king ’ s scribe , and Joah , Asaph ’ s son , the royal secretary , formed a truce team and went out of the city to meet with him .
TLB	Isaiah	36	4	The Assyrian ambassador told them to go and say to Hezekiah , “ The mighty king of Assyria says you are a fool to think that the king of Egypt will help you .
TLB	Isaiah	36	5	What are the Pharaoh ’ s promises worth ? Mere words won ’ t substitute for strength , yet you rely on him for help and have rebelled against me !
TLB	Isaiah	36	6	Egypt is a dangerous ally . She is a sharpened stick that will pierce your hand if you lean on it . That is the experience of everyone who has ever looked to her for help .
TLB	Isaiah	36	7	But perhaps you say , ‘ We are trusting in the Lord our God ! ’ Oh ? Isn ’ t he the one your king insulted , tearing down his temples and altars in the hills and making everyone in Judah worship only at the altars here in Jerusalem ? 8-9 My master , the king of Assyria , wants to make a little bet with you ! —that you don ’ t have 2,000 men left in your entire army ! If you do , he will give you 2,000 horses for them to ride on ! With that tiny army , how can you think of proceeding against even the smallest and worst contingent of my master ’ s troops ? For you ’ ll get no help from Egypt .
TLB	Isaiah	36	10	What ’ s more , do you think I have come here without the Lord ’ s telling me to take this land ? The Lord said to me , ‘ Go and destroy it ! ’ ”
TLB	Isaiah	36	11	Then Eliakim , Shebna , and Joah said to him , “ Please talk to us in Aramaic , [ a ] for we understand it quite well . Don ’ t speak in Hebrew , for the people on the wall will hear. ”
TLB	Isaiah	36	12	But he replied , “ My master wants everyone in Jerusalem to hear this , not just you . He wants them to know that if you don ’ t surrender , this city will be put under siege until everyone is so hungry and thirsty that he will eat his own dung and drink his own urine. ”
TLB	Isaiah	36	13	Then he shouted in Hebrew to the Jews listening on the wall , “ Hear the words of the great king , the king of Assyria :
TLB	Isaiah	36	14	“ Don ’ t let Hezekiah fool you—nothing he can do will save you .
TLB	Isaiah	36	15	Don ’ t let him talk you into trusting in the Lord by telling you the Lord won ’ t let you be conquered by the king of Assyria .
TLB	Isaiah	36	16	Don ’ t listen to Hezekiah , for here is the king of Assyria ’ s offer to you : Give me a present as a token of surrender ; open the gates and come out , and I will let you each have your own farm and garden and water ,
TLB	Isaiah	36	17	until I can arrange to take you to a country very similar to this one—a country where there are bountiful harvests of grain and grapes , a land of plenty .
TLB	Isaiah	36	18	Don ’ t let Hezekiah deprive you of all this by saying the Lord will deliver you from my armies . Have any other nation ’ s gods ever gained victory over the armies of the king of Assyria ?
TLB	Isaiah	36	19	Don ’ t you remember what I did to Hamath and Arpad ? Did their gods save them ? And what about Sepharvaim and Samaria ? Where are their gods now ?
TLB	Isaiah	36	20	Of all the gods of these lands , which one has ever delivered their people from my power ? Name just one ! And do you think this God of yours can deliver Jerusalem from me ? Don ’ t be ridiculous ! ”
TLB	Isaiah	36	21	But the people were silent and answered not a word , for Hezekiah had told them to say nothing in reply .
TLB	Isaiah	36	22	Then Eliakim ( son of Hilkiah ) , the prime minister , and Shebna , the royal scribe , and Joah ( son of Asaph ) , the royal secretary , went back to Hezekiah with clothes ripped to shreds as a sign of their despair and told him all that had happened .

TLB	Isaiah	37	3	They brought him this message from Hezekiah : “ This is a day of trouble and frustration and blasphemy ; it is a serious time , as when a woman is in heavy labor trying to give birth and the child does not come .
TLB	Isaiah	37	4	But perhaps the Lord your God heard the blasphemy of the king of Assyria ’ s representative as he scoffed at the living God . Surely God won ’ t let him get away with this . Surely God will rebuke him for those words . Oh , Isaiah , pray for us who are left ! ”
TLB	Isaiah	37	5	So they took the king ’ s message to Isaiah .
TLB	Isaiah	37	6	Then Isaiah replied , “ Tell King Hezekiah that the Lord says : Don ’ t be disturbed by this speech from the servant of the king of Assyria and his blasphemy .
TLB	Isaiah	37	7	For a report from Assyria will reach the king that he is needed at home at once , and he will return to his own land , where I will have him killed. ” 8-9 Now the Assyrian envoy left Jerusalem and went to consult his king , who had left Lachish and was besieging Libnah . But at this point the Assyrian king received word that Tirhakah , crown prince of Ethiopia , was leading an army against him from the south . [ a ] Upon hearing this , he sent messengers back to Jerusalem to Hezekiah with this message :
TLB	Isaiah	37	10	“ Don ’ t let this God you trust in fool you by promising that Jerusalem will not be captured by the king of Assyria !
TLB	Isaiah	37	11	Just remember what has happened wherever the kings of Assyria have gone , for they have crushed everyone who has opposed them . Do you think you will be any different ?
TLB	Isaiah	37	12	Did their gods save the cities of Gozan , Haran , or Rezeph , or the people of Eden in Telassar ? No , the Assyrian kings completely destroyed them !
TLB	Isaiah	37	13	And don ’ t forget what happened to the king of Hamath , to the king of Arpad , and to the kings of the cities of Sepharvaim , Hena , and Ivvah. ”
TLB	Isaiah	37	14	As soon as King Hezekiah had read this letter , he went over to the Temple and spread it out before the Lord
TLB	Isaiah	37	15	and prayed , saying , 16-17 “ O Lord , Almighty God of Israel enthroned between the Guardian Angels , you alone are God of all the kingdoms of the earth . You alone made heaven and earth . Listen as I plead ; see me as I pray . Look at this letter from King Sennacherib , for he has mocked the living God .
TLB	Isaiah	37	18	It is true , O Lord , that the kings of Assyria have destroyed all those nations , just as the letter says ,
TLB	Isaiah	37	19	and thrown their gods into the fire ; for they weren ’ t gods at all but merely idols , carved by men from wood and stone . Of course the Assyrians could destroy them .
TLB	Isaiah	37	20	O Lord our God , save us so that all the kingdoms of the earth will know that you are God , and you alone. ”
TLB	Isaiah	37	21	Then Isaiah , the son of Amoz , sent this message to King Hezekiah : “ The Lord God of Israel says : This is my answer to your prayer against Sennacherib , Assyria ’ s king .
TLB	Isaiah	37	22	“ The Lord says to him : My people—the helpless virgin daughter of Zion—laughs at you and scoffs and shakes her head at you in scorn .
TLB	Isaiah	37	23	Who is it you scoffed against and mocked ? Whom did you revile ? At whom did you direct your violence and pride ? It was against the Holy One of Israel !
TLB	Isaiah	37	24	You have sent your messengers to mock the Lord . You boast , ‘ I came with my mighty army against the nations of the west . I cut down the tallest cedars and choicest cypress trees . I conquered their highest mountains and destroyed their thickest forests. ’
TLB	Isaiah	37	25	“ You boast of wells you ’ ve dug in many a conquered land , and Egypt with all its armies is no obstacle to you !
TLB	Isaiah	37	26	But do you not yet know that it was I who decided all this long ago ? That it was I who gave you all this power from ancient times ? I have caused all this to happen as I planned—that you should crush walled cities into ruined heaps .
TLB	Isaiah	37	27	That ’ s why their people had so little power and were such easy prey for you . They were as helpless as the grass , as tender plants you trample down beneath your feet , as grass upon the housetops , burnt yellow by the sun .
TLB	Isaiah	37	28	But I know you well—your comings and goings and all you do—and the way you have raged against me .
TLB	Isaiah	37	29	Because of your anger against the Lord—and I heard it all ! —I have put a hook in your nose and a bit in your mouth and led you back to your own land by the same road you came. ”
TLB	Isaiah	37	30	Then God said to Hezekiah , “ Here is the proof that I am the one who is delivering this city from the king of Assyria : This year [ b ] he will abandon his siege . Although it is too late now to plant your crops , and you will have only volunteer grain this fall , still it will give you enough seed for a small harvest next year , and two years from now you will be living in luxury again .
TLB	Isaiah	37	31	And you who are left in Judah will take root again in your own soil and flourish and multiply .
TLB	Isaiah	37	32	For a remnant shall go out from Jerusalem to repopulate the land ; the power of the Lord Almighty will cause all this to come to pass .
TLB	Isaiah	37	33	“ As for the king of Assyria , his armies shall not enter Jerusalem , nor shoot their arrows there , nor march outside its gates , nor build up an earthen bank against its walls .
TLB	Isaiah	37	34	He will return to his own country by the road he came on and will not enter this city , says the Lord .
TLB	Isaiah	37	35	For my own honor I will defend it and in memory of my servant David. ”
TLB	Isaiah	37	36	That night the Angel of the Lord went out to the camp of the Assyrians and killed 185,000 soldiers ; when the living wakened the next morning , all these lay dead before them .
TLB	Isaiah	37	38	And one day while he was worshiping in the temple of Nisroch his god , his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer killed him with their swords ; then they escaped into the land of Ararat , and Esar-haddon his son became king . Footnotes - Isaiah 37:8 from the south , implied . - Isaiah 37:30 This year , implied . two years from now you will be living in luxury again . The third harvest from then would yield a bumper crop .

TLB	Isaiah	38	38	It was just before all this that Hezekiah became deathly sick , and Isaiah the prophet ( Amoz ’ son ) went to visit him and gave him this message from the Lord : “ Set your affairs in order , for you are going to die ; you will not recover from this illness. ”
TLB	Isaiah	38	2	When Hezekiah heard this , he turned his face to the wall and prayed :
TLB	Isaiah	38	3	“ O Lord , don ’ t you remember how true I ’ ve been to you and how I ’ ve always tried to obey you in everything you said ? ” Then he broke down with great sobs .
TLB	Isaiah	38	4	So the Lord sent another message to Isaiah :
TLB	Isaiah	38	5	“ Go and tell Hezekiah that the Lord God of your forefather David hears you praying and sees your tears and will let you live fifteen more years .
TLB	Isaiah	38	6	He will deliver you and this city from the king of Assyria . I will defend you , says the Lord ,
TLB	Isaiah	38	7	and here is my guarantee :
TLB	Isaiah	38	8	I will send the sun backwards ten degrees as measured on Ahaz ’ s sundial ! ” So the sun retraced ten degrees that it had gone down !
TLB	Isaiah	38	9	When King Hezekiah was well again , he wrote this poem about his experience :
TLB	Isaiah	38	10	“ My life is but half done and I must leave it all . I am robbed of my normal years , and now I must enter the gates of Sheol .
TLB	Isaiah	38	11	Never again will I see the Lord in the land of the living . Never again will I see my friends in this world .
TLB	Isaiah	38	12	My life is blown away like a shepherd ’ s tent ; it is cut short as when a weaver stops his working at the loom . In one short day my life hangs by a thread .
TLB	Isaiah	38	13	“ All night I moaned ; it was like being torn apart by lions .
TLB	Isaiah	38	14	Delirious , I chattered like a swallow and mourned like a dove ; my eyes grew weary of looking up for help . ‘ O God , ’ I cried , ‘ I am in trouble—help me. ’
TLB	Isaiah	38	15	But what can I say ? For he himself has sent this sickness . All my sleep has fled because of my soul ’ s bitterness .
TLB	Isaiah	38	16	O Lord , your discipline is good and leads to life and health . Oh , heal me and make me live !
TLB	Isaiah	38	17	“ Yes , now I see it all—it was good for me to undergo this bitterness , for you have lovingly delivered me from death ; you have forgiven all my sins .
TLB	Isaiah	38	18	For dead men can not praise you . [ a ] They can not be filled with hope and joy .
TLB	Isaiah	38	19	The living , only the living , can praise you as I do today . One generation makes known your faithfulness to the next .
TLB	Isaiah	38	20	Think of it ! The Lord healed me ! Every day of my life from now on I will sing my songs of praise in the Temple , accompanied by the orchestra. ”
TLB	Isaiah	38	21	( For Isaiah had told Hezekiah ’ s servants , “ Make an ointment of figs and spread it over the boil , and he will get well again. ”
TLB	Isaiah	38	22	And then Hezekiah had asked , “ What sign will the Lord give me to prove that he will heal me ? ” ) Footnotes - Isaiah 38:18 For dead men can not praise you . The meaning is unclear . Perhaps Hezekiah was unaware of the blessedness of the future life for those who trust in God ( 57:1-2 ) . Or perhaps his meaning is , “ Dead bodies can not praise you. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Isaiah	39	39	Soon afterwards , the king of Babylon ( Merodach-baladan , the son of Baladan ) sent Hezekiah a present and his best wishes , [ a ] for he had heard that Hezekiah had been very sick and now was well again .
TLB	Isaiah	39	2	Hezekiah appreciated this and took the envoys from Babylon on a tour of the palace , showing them his treasure-house full of silver , gold , spices , and perfumes . He took them into his jewel rooms , too , and opened to them all his treasures—everything .
TLB	Isaiah	39	3	Then Isaiah the prophet came to the king and said , “ What did they say ? Where are they from ? ” “ From far away in Babylon , ” Hezekiah replied .
TLB	Isaiah	39	4	“ How much have they seen ? ” asked Isaiah . And Hezekiah replied , “ I showed them everything I own , all my priceless treasures. ”
TLB	Isaiah	39	5	Then Isaiah said to him , “ Listen to this message from the Lord Almighty :
TLB	Isaiah	39	6	“ The time is coming when everything you have—all the treasures stored up by your fathers—will be carried off to Babylon . Nothing will be left .
TLB	Isaiah	39	7	And some of your own sons will become slaves , yes , eunuchs , in the palace of the king of Babylon. ”
TLB	Isaiah	39	8	“ All right , ” Hezekiah replied . “ Whatever the Lord says is good . At least there will be peace during my lifetime ! ” Footnotes - Isaiah 39:1 Merodach-baladan . . . sent Hezekiah a present and his best wishes . Merodach-baladan was at this time planning a revolt in the east against Sennacherib , so he was especially interested in Hezekiah ’ s activities in the west . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Isaiah	40	40	“ Comfort , yes , comfort my people , ” says your God .
TLB	Isaiah	40	2	“ Speak tenderly to Jerusalem and tell her that her sad days are gone . Her sins are pardoned , and I have punished her in full for all her sins. ”
TLB	Isaiah	40	3	Listen ! I hear the voice of someone shouting , “ Make a road for the Lord through the wilderness ; make him a straight , smooth road through the desert .
TLB	Isaiah	40	4	Fill the valleys ; level the hills ; straighten out the crooked paths , and smooth off the rough spots in the road .
TLB	Isaiah	40	5	The glory of the Lord will be seen by all mankind together. ” The Lord has spoken—it shall be .
TLB	Isaiah	40	6	The voice says , “ Shout ! ” “ What shall I shout ? ” I asked . “ Shout that man is like the grass that dies away , and all his beauty fades like dying flowers .
TLB	Isaiah	40	7	The grass withers , the flower fades beneath the breath of God . And so it is with fragile man .
TLB	Isaiah	40	8	The grass withers , the flowers fade , but the word of our God shall stand forever. ”
TLB	Isaiah	40	9	O crier of good news , shout to Jerusalem from the mountaintops ! Shout louder—don ’ t be afraid—tell the cities of Judah , “ Your God is coming ! ”
TLB	Isaiah	40	10	Yes , the Lord God is coming with mighty power ; he will rule with awesome strength . See , his reward is with him , to each as he has done .
TLB	Isaiah	40	11	He will feed his flock like a shepherd ; he will carry the lambs in his arms and gently lead the ewes with young .
TLB	Isaiah	40	12	Who else has held the oceans in his hands and measured off the heavens with his ruler ? Who else knows the weight of all the earth and weighs the mountains and the hills ?
TLB	Isaiah	40	13	Who can advise the Spirit of the Lord or be his teacher or give him counsel ?
TLB	Isaiah	40	14	Has he ever needed anyone ’ s advice ? Did he need instruction as to what is right and best ?
TLB	Isaiah	40	15	No , for all the peoples of the world are nothing in comparison with him—they are but a drop in the bucket , dust on the scales . He picks up the islands as though they had no weight at all .
TLB	Isaiah	40	16	All of Lebanon ’ s forests do not contain sufficient fuel to consume a sacrifice large enough to honor him , nor are all its animals enough to offer to our God .
TLB	Isaiah	40	17	All the nations are as nothing to him ; in his eyes they are less than nothing—mere emptiness and froth .
TLB	Isaiah	40	18	How can we describe God ? With what can we compare him ?
TLB	Isaiah	40	19	With an idol ? An idol made from a mold , overlaid with gold , and with silver chains around its neck ?
TLB	Isaiah	40	20	The man too poor to buy expensive gods like that will find a tree free from rot and hire a man to carve a face on it , and that ’ s his god—a god that can not even move !
TLB	Isaiah	40	21	Are you so ignorant ? Are you so deaf to the words of God—the words he gave before the world began ? Have you never heard nor understood ?
TLB	Isaiah	40	22	It is God who sits above the circle of the earth . ( The people below must seem to him like grasshoppers ! ) He is the one who stretches out the heavens like a curtain and makes his tent from them .
TLB	Isaiah	40	23	He dooms the great men of the world and brings them all to naught .
TLB	Isaiah	40	24	They hardly get started , barely take root , when he blows on them and their work withers , and the wind carries them off like straw .
TLB	Isaiah	40	25	“ With whom will you compare me ? Who is my equal ? ” asks the Holy One .
TLB	Isaiah	40	26	Look up into the heavens ! Who created all these stars ? As a shepherd leads his sheep , [ a ] calling each by its pet name , and counts them to see that none are lost or strayed , so God does with stars and planets !
TLB	Isaiah	40	27	O Jacob , O Israel , how can you say that the Lord doesn ’ t see your troubles and isn ’ t being fair ?
TLB	Isaiah	40	28	Don ’ t you yet understand ? Don ’ t you know by now that the everlasting God , the Creator of the farthest parts of the earth , never grows faint or weary ? No one can fathom the depths of his understanding .

TLB	Isaiah	40	30	Even the youths shall be exhausted , and the young men will all give up .

TLB	Isaiah	41	41	Listen in silence before me , O lands beyond the sea . Bring your strongest arguments . Come now and speak . The court is ready for your case .
TLB	Isaiah	41	2	Who has stirred up this one from the east , [ a ] whom victory meets at every step ? Who , indeed , but the Lord ? God has given him victory over many nations and permitted him to trample kings underfoot and to put entire armies to the sword .
TLB	Isaiah	41	3	He chases them away and goes on safely , though the paths he treads are new .
TLB	Isaiah	41	4	Who has done such mighty deeds , directing the affairs of generations of mankind as they march by ? It is I , the Lord , the First and Last ; I alone am he .
TLB	Isaiah	41	5	The lands beyond the sea watch in fear and wait for word of Cyrus ’ s [ b ] new campaigns . Remote lands tremble and mobilize for war . 6-7 The craftsmen encourage each other as they rush to make new idols to protect them . The carver hurries the goldsmith , and the molder helps at the anvil . “ Good , ” they say . “ It ’ s coming along fine . Now we can solder on the arms. ” Carefully they join the parts together and then fasten the thing in place so it won ’ t fall over !
TLB	Isaiah	41	8	But as for you , O Israel , you are mine , my chosen ones ; for you are Abraham ’ s family , and he was my friend .
TLB	Isaiah	41	9	I have called you back from the ends of the earth and said that you must serve but me alone , for I have chosen you and will not throw you away .
TLB	Isaiah	41	10	Fear not , for I am with you . Do not be dismayed . I am your God . I will strengthen you ; I will help you ; I will uphold you with my victorious right hand . [ c ]
TLB	Isaiah	41	11	See , all your angry enemies lie confused and shattered . Anyone opposing you will die .
TLB	Isaiah	41	12	You will look for them in vain—they will all be gone .
TLB	Isaiah	41	13	I am holding you by your right hand—I , the Lord your God—and I say to you , Don ’ t be afraid ; I am here to help you .
TLB	Isaiah	41	14	Despised though you are , fear not , O Israel ; for I will help you . I am the Lord , your Redeemer ; I am the Holy One of Israel .
TLB	Isaiah	41	15	You shall be a new and sharp-toothed threshing instrument to tear all enemies apart , making chaff of mountains .
TLB	Isaiah	41	16	You shall toss them in the air ; the wind shall blow them all away ; whirlwinds shall scatter them . And the joy of the Lord shall fill you full ; you shall glory in the God of Israel .
TLB	Isaiah	41	17	When the poor and needy seek water and there is none , and their tongues are parched from thirst , then I will answer when they cry to me . I , Israel ’ s God , will never forsake them .
TLB	Isaiah	41	18	I will open up rivers for them on high plateaus ! I will give them fountains of water in the valleys ! In the deserts will be pools of water , and rivers fed by springs shall flow across the dry , parched ground .
TLB	Isaiah	41	19	I will plant trees—cedars , myrtle , olive trees , cypress , fir , and pine—on barren land .
TLB	Isaiah	41	20	Everyone will see this miracle and understand that it is God who did it , Israel ’ s Holy One .
TLB	Isaiah	41	21	Can your idols make such claims as these ? Let them come and show what they can do , says God , the King of Israel .
TLB	Isaiah	41	22	Let them try to tell us what occurred in years gone by or what the future holds .
TLB	Isaiah	41	23	Yes , that ’ s it ! If you are gods , tell what will happen in the days ahead ! Or do some mighty miracle that makes us stare , amazed .
TLB	Isaiah	41	24	But no ! You are less than nothing and can do nothing at all . Anyone who chooses you needs to have his head examined !
TLB	Isaiah	41	25	But I have stirred up Cyrus from the north and east ; he will come against the nations and call on my name , and I will give him victory over kings and princes . He will tread them as a potter tramples clay .
TLB	Isaiah	41	26	Who but I have told you this would happen ? Who else predicted this , making you admit that he was right ? No one else ! None other said one word !
TLB	Isaiah	41	27	I was the first to tell Jerusalem , “ Look ! Look ! Help is on the way ! ”
TLB	Isaiah	41	28	Not one of your idols told you this . Not one gave any answer when I asked .

TLB	Isaiah	42	2	He will be gentle—he will not shout nor quarrel in the streets .
TLB	Isaiah	42	3	He will not break the bruised reed , nor quench the dimly burning flame . He will encourage the fainthearted , those tempted to despair . He will see full justice given to all who have been wronged .
TLB	Isaiah	42	4	He won ’ t be satisfied [ b ] until truth and righteousness prevail throughout the earth , nor until even distant lands beyond the seas have put their trust in him .
TLB	Isaiah	42	5	The Lord God who created the heavens and stretched them out , who created the earth and everything in it , who gives life and breath and spirit to everyone in all the world , he is the one who says to his Servant , the Messiah [ c ] :
TLB	Isaiah	42	6	“ I the Lord have called you to demonstrate my righteousness . I will guard and support you , for I have given you to my people as the personal confirmation of my covenant with them . [ d ] You shall also be a light to guide the nations unto me .
TLB	Isaiah	42	7	You will open the eyes of the blind and release those who sit in prison darkness and despair .
TLB	Isaiah	42	8	I am the Lord ! That is my name , and I will not give my glory to anyone else ; I will not share my praise with carved idols .
TLB	Isaiah	42	9	Everything I prophesied came true , and now I will prophesy again . I will tell you the future before it happens. ”
TLB	Isaiah	42	10	Sing a new song to the Lord ; sing his praises , all you who live in earth ’ s remotest corners ! Sing , O sea ! Sing , all you who live in distant lands beyond the sea !

TLB	Isaiah	42	12	Let the western coastlands glorify the Lord and sing his mighty power .
TLB	Isaiah	42	13	The Lord will be a mighty warrior , full of fury toward his foes . He will give a great shout and prevail .
TLB	Isaiah	42	14	Long has he been silent ; he has restrained himself . But now he will give full vent to his wrath ; he will groan and cry like a woman delivering her child .
TLB	Isaiah	42	15	He will level the mountains and hills and blight their greenery . He will dry up the rivers and pools .
TLB	Isaiah	42	16	He will bring blind Israel along a path they have not seen before . He will make the darkness bright before them and smooth and straighten out the road ahead . He will not forsake them .
TLB	Isaiah	42	17	But those who trust in idols and call them gods will be greatly disappointed ; they will be turned away .
TLB	Isaiah	42	18	Oh , how blind and deaf you are toward God ! Why won ’ t you listen ? Why won ’ t you see ?
TLB	Isaiah	42	19	Who in all the world is as blind as my own people , [ e ] who are designed to be my messengers of truth ? Who is so blind as my “ dedicated one , ” the “ servant of the Lord ” ?
TLB	Isaiah	42	20	You see and understand what is right but won ’ t heed nor do it ; you hear , but you won ’ t listen .
TLB	Isaiah	42	21	The Lord has magnified his law and made it truly glorious . Through it he had planned to show the world that he is righteous .
TLB	Isaiah	42	22	But what a sight his people are—these who were to demonstrate to all the world the glory of his law ; [ f ] for they are robbed , enslaved , imprisoned , trapped , fair game for all , with no one to protect them .
TLB	Isaiah	42	23	Won ’ t even one of you apply these lessons from the past and see the ruin that awaits you up ahead ?
TLB	Isaiah	42	24	Who let Israel be robbed and hurt ? Did not the Lord ? It is the Lord they sinned against , for they would not go where he sent them nor listen to his laws .
TLB	Isaiah	42	25	That is why God poured out such fury and wrath on his people and destroyed them in battle . Yet , though set on fire and burned , they will not understand the reason why—that it is God , wanting them to repent . [ g ] Footnotes - Isaiah 42:1 See my servant . Not Cyrus , as in ch .

TLB	Isaiah	43	15	I am the Lord , your Holy One , Israel ’ s Creator and King .
TLB	Isaiah	43	16	I am the Lord , who opened a way through the waters , making a path right through the sea .
TLB	Isaiah	43	17	I called forth the mighty army of Egypt with all its chariots and horses , to lie beneath the waves , dead , their lives snuffed out like candlewicks .
TLB	Isaiah	43	18	But forget all that—it is nothing compared to what I ’ m going to do !
TLB	Isaiah	43	19	For I ’ m going to do a brand-new thing . See , I have already begun ! Don ’ t you see it ? I will make a road through the wilderness of the world for my people to go home , and create rivers for them in the desert !
TLB	Isaiah	43	20	The wild animals in the fields will thank me , the jackals and ostriches too , for giving them water in the wilderness , yes , springs in the desert , so that my people , my chosen ones , can be refreshed .
TLB	Isaiah	43	21	I have made Israel for myself , and these my people will some day honor me before the world .
TLB	Isaiah	43	22	But O my people , you won ’ t ask my help ; you have grown tired of me !
TLB	Isaiah	43	23	You have not brought me the lambs for burnt offerings ; you have not honored me with sacrifices . Yet my requests for offerings and incense have been very few ! I have not treated you as slaves .
TLB	Isaiah	43	24	You have brought me no sweet-smelling incense nor pleased me with the sacrificial fat . No , you have presented me only with sins and wearied me with all your faults .
TLB	Isaiah	43	25	I , yes , I alone am he who blots away your sins for my own sake and will never think of them again .
TLB	Isaiah	43	26	Oh , remind me of this promise of forgiveness , for we must talk about your sins . Plead your case for my forgiving you .
TLB	Isaiah	43	27	From the very first your ancestors sinned against me—all your forebears transgressed my law .
TLB	Isaiah	43	28	That is why I have deposed your priests and destroyed Israel , leaving her to shame . Footnotes - Isaiah 43:3 to Cyrus , implied . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Isaiah	44	44	Listen to me , O my servant Israel , O my chosen ones :
TLB	Isaiah	44	2	The Lord who made you , who will help you , says : O servant of mine , don ’ t be afraid . O Jerusalem , my chosen ones , don ’ t be afraid .
TLB	Isaiah	44	3	For I will give you abundant water for your thirst and for your parched fields . And I will pour out my Spirit and my blessings on your children .
TLB	Isaiah	44	4	They shall thrive like watered grass , like willows on a riverbank .
TLB	Isaiah	44	5	“ I am the Lord ’ s , ” they ’ ll proudly [ a ] say , or , “ I am a Jew , ” and tattoo upon their hands the name of God or the honored name of Israel .
TLB	Isaiah	44	6	The Lord , the King of Israel , says—yes , it is Israel ’ s Redeemer , the Lord Almighty , who says it—I am the First and Last ; there is no other God .
TLB	Isaiah	44	7	Who else can tell you what is going to happen in the days ahead ? Let them tell you if they can and prove their power . Let them do as I have done since ancient times .
TLB	Isaiah	44	8	Don ’ t , don ’ t be afraid . Haven ’ t I proclaimed from ages past that I would save you [ b ] ? You are my witnesses—is there any other God ? No ! None that I know about ! There is no other Rock !
TLB	Isaiah	44	9	What fools they are who manufacture idols for their gods . Their hopes remain unanswered . They themselves are witnesses that this is so , for their idols neither see nor know . No wonder those who worship them are so ashamed .
TLB	Isaiah	44	10	Who but a fool would make his own god—an idol that can help him not one whit !
TLB	Isaiah	44	11	All that worship these will stand before the Lord in shame , along with all these carpenters—mere men—who claim that they have made a god . Together they will stand in terror .
TLB	Isaiah	44	12	The metalsmith stands at his forge to make an ax , pounding on it with all his might . He grows hungry and thirsty , weak and faint .
TLB	Isaiah	44	13	Then the wood-carver takes the ax and uses it to make an idol . He measures and marks out a block of wood and carves the figure of a man . Now he has a wonderful idol that can ’ t so much as move from where it is placed .
TLB	Isaiah	44	14	He cuts down cedars , he selects the cypress and the oak , he plants the ash in the forest to be nourished by the rain .
TLB	Isaiah	44	15	And after his care , he uses part of the wood to make a fire to warm himself and bake his bread , and then—he really does—he takes the rest of it and makes himself a god—a god for men to worship ! An idol to fall down before and praise !
TLB	Isaiah	44	16	Part of the tree he burns to roast his meat and to keep him warm and fed and well content ,
TLB	Isaiah	44	17	and with what ’ s left he makes his god : a carved idol ! He falls down before it and worships it and prays to it . “ Deliver me , ” he says . “ You are my god ! ”
TLB	Isaiah	44	18	Such stupidity and ignorance ! God has shut their eyes so that they can not see and closed their minds from understanding .
TLB	Isaiah	44	19	The man never stops to think or figure out , “ Why , it ’ s just a block of wood ! I ’ ve burned it for heat and used it to bake my bread and roast my meat . How can the rest of it be a god ? Should I fall down before a chunk of wood ? ”
TLB	Isaiah	44	20	The poor , deluded fool feeds on ashes ; he is trusting what can never give him any help at all . Yet he can not bring himself to ask , “ Is this thing , this idol that I ’ m holding in my hand , a lie ? ”
TLB	Isaiah	44	21	Pay attention , Israel , for you are my servant ; I made you , and I will not forget to help you .
TLB	Isaiah	44	22	I ’ ve blotted out your sins ; they are gone like morning mist at noon ! Oh , return to me , for I have paid the price to set you free .
TLB	Isaiah	44	23	Sing , O heavens , for the Lord has done this wondrous thing . Shout , O earth ; break forth into song , O mountains and forests , yes , and every tree ; for the Lord redeemed Jacob and is glorified in Israel !
TLB	Isaiah	44	24	The Lord , your Redeemer who made you , says : All things were made by me ; I alone stretched out the heavens . By myself I made the earth and everything in it .
TLB	Isaiah	44	25	I am the one who shows what liars all false prophets are , by causing something else to happen than the things they say . I make wise men give opposite advice to what they should and make them into fools .
TLB	Isaiah	44	26	But what my prophets say , I do ; when they say Jerusalem will be delivered and the cities of Judah lived in once again—it shall be done !
TLB	Isaiah	44	27	When I speak to the rivers and say , “ Be dry ! ” they shall be dry .
TLB	Isaiah	44	28	When I say of Cyrus , [ c ] “ He is my shepherd , ” he will certainly do as I say ; and Jerusalem will be rebuilt and the Temple restored , for I have spoken it .

TLB	Isaiah	45	45	This is Jehovah ’ s message to Cyrus , God ’ s anointed , whom he has chosen to conquer many lands . God shall empower his right hand , and he shall crush the strength of mighty kings . God shall open the gates of Babylon to him ; the gates shall not be shut against him anymore .
TLB	Isaiah	45	2	I will go before you , Cyrus , and level the mountains and smash down the city gates of brass and iron bars .
TLB	Isaiah	45	3	And I will give you treasures hidden in the darkness , secret riches ; and you will know that I am doing this—I , the Lord , the God of Israel , the one who calls you by your name .
TLB	Isaiah	45	4	And why have I named you for this work ? For the sake of Jacob , my servant—Israel , my chosen . I called you by name when you didn ’ t know me .
TLB	Isaiah	45	5	I am Jehovah ; there is no other God . I will strengthen you and send you out to victory even though you don ’ t know me ,
TLB	Isaiah	45	6	and all the world from east to west will know there is no other God . I am Jehovah and there is no one else . I alone am God .
TLB	Isaiah	45	7	I form the light and make the dark . I send good times and bad . I , Jehovah , am he who does these things .
TLB	Isaiah	45	8	Open up , O heavens . Let the skies pour out their righteousness . Let salvation and righteousness sprout up together from the earth . I , Jehovah , created them .
TLB	Isaiah	45	9	Woe to the man who fights with his Creator . Does the pot argue with its maker ? Does the clay dispute with him who forms it , saying , “ Stop , you ’ re doing it wrong ! ” or the pot exclaim , “ How clumsy can you be ! ” ?
TLB	Isaiah	45	10	Woe to the baby just being born who squalls to his father and mother , “ Why have you produced me ? Can ’ t you do anything right at all ? ”
TLB	Isaiah	45	11	Jehovah , the Holy One of Israel , Israel ’ s Creator , says : “ What right have you to question what I do ? Who are you to command me concerning the work of my hands ?
TLB	Isaiah	45	12	I have made the earth and created man upon it . With my hands I have stretched out the heavens and commanded all the vast myriads of stars .
TLB	Isaiah	45	13	I have raised up Cyrus [ a ] to fulfill my righteous purpose , and I will direct all his paths . He shall restore my city and free my captive people—and not for a reward ! ”
TLB	Isaiah	45	14	Jehovah says : “ The Egyptians , Ethiopians , and Sabeans shall be subject to you . They shall come to you with all their merchandise , and it shall all be yours . They shall follow you as prisoners in chains and fall down on their knees before you and say , “ The only God there is , is your God ! ”
TLB	Isaiah	45	15	Truly , O God of Israel , Savior , you work in strange , mysterious ways .
TLB	Isaiah	45	16	All who worship idols shall be disappointed and ashamed .
TLB	Isaiah	45	17	But Israel shall be saved by Jehovah with eternal salvation ; they shall never be disappointed in their God through all eternity .
TLB	Isaiah	45	18	For Jehovah created the heavens and earth and put everything in place , and he made the world to be lived in , not to be an empty chaos . I am Jehovah , he says , and there is no other !
TLB	Isaiah	45	19	I publicly proclaim bold promises ; I do not whisper obscurities in some dark corner so that no one can know what I mean . And I didn ’ t tell Israel to ask me for what I didn ’ t plan to give ! No , for I , Jehovah , speak only truth and righteousness .
TLB	Isaiah	45	20	Gather together and come , you nations that escape from Cyrus ’ s hand . What fools they are who carry around the wooden idols and pray to gods that can not save !
TLB	Isaiah	45	21	Consult together , argue your case and state your proofs that idol worship pays ! Who but God has said that these things concerning Cyrus would come true ? What idol ever told you they would happen ? For there is no other God but me—a just God and a Savior—no , not one !
TLB	Isaiah	45	22	Let all the world look to me for salvation ! For I am God ; there is no other .
TLB	Isaiah	45	23	I have sworn by myself , and I will never go back on my word , for it is true—that every knee in all the world shall bow to me , and every tongue shall swear allegiance to my name .
TLB	Isaiah	45	24	“ In Jehovah is all my righteousness and strength , ” the people shall declare . And all who were angry with him shall come to him and be ashamed .
TLB	Isaiah	45	25	In Jehovah all the generations of Israel shall be justified , triumphant .

TLB	Isaiah	46	46	1-2 The idols of Babylon , Bel and Nebo , [ a ] are being hauled away on ox carts ! But look ! The beasts are stumbling ! The cart is turning over ! The gods are falling out onto the ground ! Is that the best that they can do ? If they can not even save themselves from such a fall , how can they save their worshipers from Cyrus ?
TLB	Isaiah	46	3	“ Listen to me , all Israel who are left ; I have created you and cared for you since you were born .
TLB	Isaiah	46	4	I will be your God through all your lifetime , yes , even when your hair is white with age . I made you and I will care for you . I will carry you along and be your Savior .
TLB	Isaiah	46	5	“ With what in all of heaven and earth do I compare ? Whom can you find who equals me ?
TLB	Isaiah	46	6	Will you compare me with an idol made lavishly with silver and with gold ? They hire a goldsmith to take your wealth and make a god from it ! Then they fall down and worship it !
TLB	Isaiah	46	7	They carry it around on their shoulders , and when they set it down , it stays there , for it can not move ! And when someone prays to it , there is no answer , for it can not get him out of his trouble .
TLB	Isaiah	46	8	“ Don ’ t forget this , O guilty ones .
TLB	Isaiah	46	9	And don ’ t forget the many times I clearly told you what was going to happen in the future . For I am God—I only—and there is no other like me
TLB	Isaiah	46	10	who can tell you what is going to happen . All I say will come to pass , for I do whatever I wish .
TLB	Isaiah	46	11	I will call that swift bird of prey from the east—that man Cyrus from far away . And he will come and do my bidding . I have said I would do it and I will .
TLB	Isaiah	46	12	Listen to me , you stubborn , evil men !
TLB	Isaiah	46	13	For I am offering you my deliverance ; not in the distant future , but right now ! I am ready to save you , and I will restore Jerusalem and Israel , who is my glory .

TLB	Isaiah	47	47	“ O Babylon , the unconquered , come sit in the dust ; for your days of glory , pomp , and honor are ended . O daughter of Chaldea , never again will you be the lovely princess , tender and delicate .
TLB	Isaiah	47	2	Take heavy millstones and grind the corn ; remove your veil ; [ a ] strip off your robe ; expose yourself to public view .
TLB	Isaiah	47	3	You shall be in nakedness and shame . I will take vengeance upon you and will not repent. ”
TLB	Isaiah	47	4	So speaks our Redeemer , who will save Israel from Babylon ’ s mighty power ; the Lord Almighty is his name , the Holy One of Israel .
TLB	Isaiah	47	5	Sit in darkness and silence , O Babylon ; never again will you be called “ The Queen of Kingdoms. ”
TLB	Isaiah	47	6	For I was angry with my people Israel and began to punish them a little by letting them fall into your hands , O Babylon . But you showed them no mercy . You have made even the old folks carry heavy burdens .
TLB	Isaiah	47	7	You thought your reign would never end , Queen Kingdom of the world . You didn ’ t care a whit about my people or think about the fate of those who do them harm .
TLB	Isaiah	47	8	O pleasure-mad kingdom , living at ease , bragging as the greatest in the world—listen to the sentence of my court upon your sins . You say , “ I alone am God ! I ’ ll never be a widow ; I ’ ll never lose my children. ”
TLB	Isaiah	47	9	Well , those two things shall come upon you in one moment , in full measure in one day : widowhood and the loss of your children , despite all your witchcraft and magic .
TLB	Isaiah	47	10	You felt secure in all your wickedness . “ No one sees me , ” you said . Your “ wisdom ” and “ knowledge ” have caused you to turn away from me and claim that you yourself are Jehovah .
TLB	Isaiah	47	11	That is why disaster shall overtake you suddenly—so suddenly that you won ’ t know where it comes from . And there will be no atonement then to cleanse away your sins .
TLB	Isaiah	47	12	Call out the demon hordes you ’ ve worshiped all these years . Call on them to help you strike deep terror into many hearts again .
TLB	Isaiah	47	13	You have advisors by the ton—your astrologers and stargazers , who try to tell you what the future holds .
TLB	Isaiah	47	14	But they are as useless as dried grass burning in the fire . They can not even deliver themselves ! You ’ ll get no help from them at all . Theirs is no fire to sit beside to make you warm !
TLB	Isaiah	47	15	And all your friends of childhood days shall slip away and disappear , unable to help . Footnotes - Isaiah 47:2 remove your veil . In ancient Babylonia ( and in many Eastern lands today ) only harlots were permitted to go without veils . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Isaiah	48	48	1-2 Hear me , my people : you swear allegiance to the Lord without meaning a word of it when you boast of living in the Holy City and brag about depending on the God of Israel .
TLB	Isaiah	48	3	Time and again I told you what was going to happen in the future . My words were scarcely spoken when suddenly I did just what I said .
TLB	Isaiah	48	4	I knew how hard and obstinate you are . Your necks are as unbending as iron ; you are as hardheaded as brass .
TLB	Isaiah	48	5	That is why I told you ahead of time what I was going to do , so that you could never say , “ My idol did it ; my carved image commanded it to happen ! ”
TLB	Isaiah	48	6	You have heard my predictions and seen them fulfilled , but you refuse to agree it is so . Now I will tell you new things I haven ’ t mentioned before , secrets you haven ’ t heard .
TLB	Isaiah	48	7	Then you can ’ t say , “ We knew that all the time ! ”
TLB	Isaiah	48	8	Yes , I ’ ll tell you things entirely new , for I know so well what traitors you are , rebels from earliest childhood , rotten through and through .
TLB	Isaiah	48	9	Yet for my own sake and for the honor of my name I will hold back my anger and not wipe you out .
TLB	Isaiah	48	10	I refined you in the furnace of affliction , but found no silver there . You are worthless , with nothing good in you at all .
TLB	Isaiah	48	11	Yet for my own sake—yes , for my own sake—I will save you from my anger and not destroy you lest the heathen say their gods have conquered me . I will not let them have my glory .
TLB	Isaiah	48	12	Listen to me , my people , my chosen ones ! I alone am God . I am the First ; I am the Last .
TLB	Isaiah	48	13	It was my hand that laid the foundations of the earth ; the palm of my right hand spread out the heavens above ; I spoke and they came into being .
TLB	Isaiah	48	14	Come , all of you , and listen . Among all your idols , which one has ever told you this : “ The Lord loves Cyrus . He will use him to put an end to the empire of Babylonia . He will utterly rout the armies of the Chaldeans ” ?
TLB	Isaiah	48	15	But I am saying it . I have called Cyrus ; I have sent him on this errand , and I will prosper him .
TLB	Isaiah	48	16	Come closer and listen . I have always told you plainly what would happen , so that you could clearly understand . And now the Lord God and his Spirit have sent me ( with this message ) :
TLB	Isaiah	48	17	The Lord , your Redeemer , the Holy One of Israel , says : I am the Lord your God , who punishes you for your own good and leads you along the paths that you should follow .
TLB	Isaiah	48	18	Oh , that you had listened to my laws ! Then you would have had peace flowing like a gentle river , and great waves of righteousness .
TLB	Isaiah	48	19	Then you would have become as numerous as the sands along the seashores of the world , too many to count , and there would have been no need for your destruction .
TLB	Isaiah	48	20	Yet even now , be free from your captivity ! Leave Babylon , singing as you go ; shout to the ends of the earth that the Lord has redeemed his servants , the Jews .
TLB	Isaiah	48	21	They were not thirsty when he led them through the deserts ; he divided the rock , and water gushed out for them to drink .
TLB	Isaiah	48	22	But there is no peace , says the Lord , for the wicked . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Isaiah	49	49	Listen to me , all of you in far-off lands : The Lord called me before my birth . From within the womb he called me by my name .
TLB	Isaiah	49	2	God will make my words of judgment sharp as swords . He has hidden me in the shadow of his hand ; I am like a sharp arrow in his quiver .
TLB	Isaiah	49	3	He said to me : “ You are my servant , a prince of power [ a ] with God , and you shall bring me glory. ”
TLB	Isaiah	49	4	I replied , “ But my work for them seems all in vain ; I have spent my strength for them without response . Yet I leave it all with God for my reward. ”
TLB	Isaiah	49	5	“ And now , ” said the Lord—the Lord who formed me from my mother ’ s womb to serve him who commissioned me to restore to him his people Israel , who has given me the strength to perform this task and honored me for doing it ! —
TLB	Isaiah	49	6	“ you shall do more than restore Israel to me . I will make you a Light to the nations of the world to bring my salvation to them too. ”
TLB	Isaiah	49	7	The Lord , the Redeemer and Holy One of Israel , says to the One who is despised , rejected by mankind , and kept beneath the heel of the world ’ s rulers : “ Kings shall stand at attention when you pass by ; princes shall bow low because the Lord has chosen you ; he , the faithful Lord , the Holy One of Israel , chooses you. ” 8-9 The Lord says , “ Your request has come at a favorable time . I will keep you from harm and give you as a token and pledge to Israel , proof that I will reestablish the land of Israel and reassign it to its own people again . Through you I am saying to the prisoners of darkness , ‘ Come out ! I am giving you your freedom ! ’ They will be my sheep , grazing in green pastures and on the grassy hills .
TLB	Isaiah	49	10	They shall neither hunger nor thirst ; the searing sun and scorching desert winds will not reach them anymore . For the Lord in his mercy will lead them beside the cool waters .
TLB	Isaiah	49	11	And I will make my mountains into level paths for them ; the highways shall be raised above the valleys .
TLB	Isaiah	49	12	See , my people shall return from far away , from north and west and south. ”
TLB	Isaiah	49	13	Sing for joy , O heavens ; shout , O earth . Break forth with song , O mountains , for the Lord has comforted his people and will have compassion upon them in their sorrow .
TLB	Isaiah	49	14	Yet they say , “ My Lord deserted us ; he has forgotten us. ”
TLB	Isaiah	49	15	“ Never ! Can a mother forget her little child and not have love for her own son ? Yet even if that should be , I will not forget you .
TLB	Isaiah	49	16	See , I have tattooed your name upon my palm , and ever before me is a picture of Jerusalem ’ s walls in ruins .
TLB	Isaiah	49	17	Soon your rebuilders shall come and chase away all those destroying you .
TLB	Isaiah	49	18	Look and see , for the Lord has vowed that all your enemies shall come and be your slaves . They will be as jewels to display , as bridal ornaments .
TLB	Isaiah	49	19	“ Even the most desolate parts of your abandoned land shall soon be crowded with your people , and your enemies who enslaved you shall be far away .
TLB	Isaiah	49	20	The generations born in exile shall return and say , ‘ We need more room ! It ’ s crowded here ! ’
TLB	Isaiah	49	21	Then you will think to yourself , ‘ Who has given me all these ? For most of my children were killed , and the rest were carried away into exile , leaving me here alone . Who bore these ? Who raised them for me ? ’ ”
TLB	Isaiah	49	22	The Lord God says , “ See , I will give a signal to the Gentiles , and they shall carry your little sons back to you in their arms , and your daughters on their shoulders .
TLB	Isaiah	49	23	Kings and queens shall serve you ; they shall care for all your needs . They shall bow to the earth before you and lick the dust from off your feet ; then you shall know I am the Lord . Those who wait for me shall never be ashamed. ”
TLB	Isaiah	49	24	Who can snatch the prey from the hands of a mighty man ? Who can demand that a tyrant let his captives go ?
TLB	Isaiah	49	25	But the Lord says , “ Even the captives of the most mighty and most terrible shall all be freed ; for I will fight those who fight you , and I will save your children .
TLB	Isaiah	49	26	I will feed your enemies with their own flesh , and they shall be drunk with rivers of their own blood .

TLB	Isaiah	50	50	The Lord asks , Did I sell you to my creditors ? Is that why you aren ’ t here ? Is your mother gone because I divorced her and sent her away ? No , you went away as captives because of your sins . And your mother , too , was taken in payment for your sins .
TLB	Isaiah	50	2	Was I too weak to save you ? Is that why the house is silent and empty when I come home ? Have I no longer power to deliver ? No , that is not the reason ! For I can rebuke the sea and make it dry ! I can turn the rivers into deserts , covered with dying fish .
TLB	Isaiah	50	3	I am the one who sends the darkness out across the skies .
TLB	Isaiah	50	4	The Lord God has given me his words of wisdom so that I may know what I should say to all these weary ones . Morning by morning he wakens me and opens my understanding to his will .

TLB	Isaiah	51	51	1-2 Listen to me , all who hope for deliverance , who seek the Lord ! Consider the quarry from which you were mined , the rock from which you were cut ! Yes , think about your ancestors Abraham and Sarah , from whom you came . You worry at being so small and few , but Abraham was only one when I called him . But when I blessed him , he became a great nation .
TLB	Isaiah	51	3	And the Lord will bless Israel again , and make her deserts blossom ; her barren wilderness will become as beautiful as the Garden of Eden . Joy and gladness will be found there , thanksgiving and lovely songs .

TLB	Isaiah	51	5	My mercy and justice are coming soon ; your salvation is on the way . I will rule the nations ; they shall wait for me and long for me to come .
TLB	Isaiah	51	6	Look high in the skies and watch the earth beneath , for the skies shall disappear like smoke , the earth shall wear out like a garment , and the people of the earth shall die like flies . But my salvation lasts forever ; my righteous rule will never die nor end .
TLB	Isaiah	51	7	Listen to me , you who know the right from wrong and cherish my laws in your hearts : don ’ t be afraid of people ’ s scorn or their slanderous talk .
TLB	Isaiah	51	8	For the moth shall destroy them like garments ; the worm shall eat them like wool ; but my justice and mercy shall last forever , and my salvation from generation to generation .
TLB	Isaiah	51	9	Awake , O Lord ! Rise up and robe yourself with strength . Rouse yourself as in the days of old when you slew Egypt , the dragon [ a ] of the Nile .
TLB	Isaiah	51	10	Are you not the same today , the mighty God who dried up the sea , making a path right through it for your ransomed ones ?
TLB	Isaiah	51	11	The time will come when God ’ s redeemed will all come home again . They shall come with singing to Jerusalem , filled with joy and everlasting gladness ; sorrow and mourning will all disappear .
TLB	Isaiah	51	12	I , even I , am he who comforts you and gives you all this joy . So what right have you to fear mere mortal men , who wither like the grass and disappear ?
TLB	Isaiah	51	13	And yet you have no fear of God , your Maker—you have forgotten him , the one who spread the stars throughout the skies and made the earth . Will you be in constant dread of men ’ s oppression , and fear their anger all day long ?
TLB	Isaiah	51	14	Soon , soon you slaves shall be released ; dungeon , starvation , and death are not your fate .
TLB	Isaiah	51	15	For I am the Lord your God , the Lord Almighty , who dried a path for you right through the sea , between the roaring waves .
TLB	Isaiah	51	16	And I have put my words in your mouth and hidden you safe within my hand . I planted the stars in place and molded all the earth . I am the one who says to Israel , “ You are mine. ”
TLB	Isaiah	51	17	Wake up , wake up , Jerusalem ! You have drunk enough from the cup of the fury of the Lord . You have drunk to the dregs the cup of terror and squeezed out the last drops .
TLB	Isaiah	51	18	Not one of her sons is left alive to help or tell her what to do .
TLB	Isaiah	51	19	These two things have been your lot : desolation and destruction . Yes , famine and the sword . And who is left to sympathize ? Who is left to comfort you ?
TLB	Isaiah	51	20	For your sons have fainted and lie in the streets , helpless as wild goats caught in a net . The Lord has poured out his fury and rebuke upon them .
TLB	Isaiah	51	21	But listen now to this , afflicted ones—full of troubles and in a stupor ( but not from being drunk ) —
TLB	Isaiah	51	22	this is what the Lord says , the Lord your God who cares for his people : “ See , I take from your hands the terrible cup ; you shall drink no more of my fury ; it is gone at last .
TLB	Isaiah	51	23	But I will put that terrible cup into the hands of those who tormented you and trampled your souls to the dust and walked upon your backs. ” Footnotes - Isaiah 51:9 Egypt , the dragon , literally , “ Rahab , the dragon. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Isaiah	52	3	For the Lord says : When I sold you into exile , I asked no fee from your oppressors ; now I can take you back again and owe them not a cent !
TLB	Isaiah	52	4	My people were tyrannized without cause by Egypt and Assyria , and I delivered them .
TLB	Isaiah	52	5	And now , what is this ? asks the Lord . Why are my people enslaved again and oppressed without excuse ? Those who rule them shout in exultation , and my name is constantly blasphemed day by day .
TLB	Isaiah	52	6	Therefore I will reveal my name to my people , and they shall know the power in that name . Then at last they will recognize that it is I , yes , I , who speaks to them .
TLB	Isaiah	52	7	How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of those who bring the happy news of peace and salvation , the news that the God of Israel reigns .

TLB	Isaiah	52	10	The Lord has bared his holy arm before the eyes of all the nations ; the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God .
TLB	Isaiah	52	11	Go now , leave your bonds and slavery . Put Babylon and all it represents far behind you—it is unclean to you . You are the holy people of the Lord ; purify yourselves , all you who carry home the vessels of the Lord .
TLB	Isaiah	52	12	You shall not leave in haste , running for your lives ; for the Lord will go ahead of you , and he , the God of Israel , will protect you from behind .
TLB	Isaiah	52	13	See , my Servant [ b ] shall prosper ; he shall be highly exalted . 14-15 Yet many shall be amazed when they see him—yes , even far-off foreign nations and their kings ; they shall stand dumbfounded , speechless in his presence . For they shall see and understand what they had not been told before . They shall see my Servant beaten and bloodied , so disfigured one would scarcely know it was a person standing there . So shall he cleanse [ c ] many nations . Footnotes - Isaiah 52:1 from God , implied . - Isaiah 52:13 my Servant .

TLB	Isaiah	53	53	But , oh , how few believe it ! Who will listen ? To whom will God reveal his saving power ?
TLB	Isaiah	53	2	In God ’ s eyes [ a ] he was like a tender green shoot , sprouting from a root in dry and sterile ground . But in our eyes there was no attractiveness at all , nothing to make us want him .
TLB	Isaiah	53	3	We despised him and rejected him—a man of sorrows , acquainted with bitterest grief . We turned our backs on him and looked the other way when he went by . He was despised , and we didn ’ t care .
TLB	Isaiah	53	4	Yet it was our grief he bore , our sorrows that weighed him down . And we thought his troubles were a punishment from God , for his own sins !
TLB	Isaiah	53	5	But he was wounded and bruised for our sins . He was beaten that we might have peace ; he was lashed—and we were healed !
TLB	Isaiah	53	6	We—every one of us—have strayed away like sheep ! We , who left God ’ s paths to follow our own . Yet God laid on him the guilt and sins of every one of us !
TLB	Isaiah	53	7	He was oppressed and he was afflicted , yet he never said a word . He was brought as a lamb to the slaughter ; and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb , so he stood silent before the ones condemning him .
TLB	Isaiah	53	8	From prison and trial they led him away to his death . But who among the people of that day realized it was their sins that he was dying for—that he was suffering their punishment ?
TLB	Isaiah	53	9	He was buried like a criminal , but in a rich man ’ s grave ; but he had done no wrong and had never spoken an evil word .
TLB	Isaiah	53	10	But it was the Lord ’ s good plan to bruise him and fill him with grief . However , when his soul has been made an offering for sin , then he shall have a multitude of children , many heirs . He shall live again , [ b ] and God ’ s program shall prosper in his hands .
TLB	Isaiah	53	11	And when he sees all that is accomplished by the anguish of his soul , he shall be satisfied ; and because of what he has experienced , my righteous Servant shall make many to be counted righteous before God , for he shall bear all their sins .
TLB	Isaiah	53	12	Therefore , I will give him the honors of one who is mighty and great because he has poured out his soul unto death . He was counted as a sinner , and he bore the sins of many , and he pled with God for sinners .

TLB	Isaiah	54	54	Sing , O childless woman ! Break out into loud and joyful song , Jerusalem , [ a ] for she who was abandoned has more blessings now than she whose husband stayed !
TLB	Isaiah	54	2	Enlarge your house ; build on additions ; spread out your home !
TLB	Isaiah	54	3	For you will soon be bursting at the seams ! And your descendants will possess the cities left behind during the exile and rule the nations that took their lands .
TLB	Isaiah	54	4	Fear not ; you will no longer live in shame . The shame of your youth and the sorrows of widowhood will be remembered no more ,
TLB	Isaiah	54	5	for your Creator will be your “ husband. ” The Lord Almighty is his name ; he is your Redeemer , the Holy One of Israel , the God of all the earth .
TLB	Isaiah	54	6	For the Lord has called you back from your grief—a young wife abandoned by her husband .
TLB	Isaiah	54	7	For a brief moment I abandoned you . But with great compassion I will take you back .
TLB	Isaiah	54	8	In a moment of anger I turned my face a little while ; but with everlasting love I will have pity on you , says the Lord , your Redeemer .
TLB	Isaiah	54	9	Just as in the time of Noah I swore that I would never again permit the waters of a flood to cover the earth and destroy its life , so now I swear that I will never again pour out my anger on you .
TLB	Isaiah	54	10	For the mountains may depart and the hills disappear , but my kindness shall not leave you . My promise of peace for you will never be broken , says the Lord who has mercy upon you .
TLB	Isaiah	54	11	O my afflicted people , tempest-tossed and troubled , I will rebuild you on a foundation of sapphires and make the walls of your houses from precious jewels .
TLB	Isaiah	54	12	I will make your towers of sparkling agate and your gates and walls of shining gems .
TLB	Isaiah	54	13	And all your citizens shall be taught by me , and their prosperity shall be great .
TLB	Isaiah	54	14	You will live under a government that is just and fair . Your enemies will stay far away ; you will live in peace . Terror shall not come near .
TLB	Isaiah	54	15	If any nation comes to fight you , it will not be sent by me to punish you . Therefore , it will be routed , for I am on your side . [ b ]
TLB	Isaiah	54	16	I have created the smith who blows the coals beneath the forge and makes the weapons of destruction . And I have created the armies that destroy .
TLB	Isaiah	54	17	But in that coming day , no weapon turned against you shall succeed , and you will have justice against every courtroom lie . This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord . This is the blessing I have given you , says the Lord .

TLB	Isaiah	55	10	As the rain and snow come down from heaven and stay upon the ground to water the earth , and cause the grain to grow and to produce seed for the farmer and bread for the hungry ,
TLB	Isaiah	55	11	so also is my word . I send it out , and it always produces fruit . It shall accomplish all I want it to and prosper everywhere I send it .

TLB	Isaiah	56	56	Be just and fair to all , the Lord God says . Do what ’ s right and good , for I am coming soon to rescue you .
TLB	Isaiah	56	2	Blessed is the man who refuses to work during my Sabbath days of rest , but honors them ; and blessed is the man who checks himself from doing wrong .
TLB	Isaiah	56	3	And my blessings are for Gentiles , too , when they accept the Lord ; don ’ t let them think that I will make them second-class citizens . And this is for the eunuchs too . They can be as much mine as anyone .
TLB	Isaiah	56	4	For I say this to the eunuchs who keep my Sabbaths holy , who choose the things that please me and obey my laws :
TLB	Isaiah	56	5	I will give them—in my house , within my walls—a name far greater than the honor they would receive from having sons and daughters . For the name that I will give them is an everlasting one ; it will never disappear .
TLB	Isaiah	56	6	As for the Gentiles , the outsiders who join the people of the Lord and serve him and love his name , who are his servants and don ’ t desecrate the Sabbath , and have accepted his covenant and promises ,
TLB	Isaiah	56	7	I will bring them also to my holy mountain of Jerusalem and make them full of joy within my House of Prayer . I will accept their sacrifices and offerings , for my Temple shall be called “ A House of Prayer for All People ” !
TLB	Isaiah	56	8	For the Lord God who brings back the outcasts of Israel says : I will bring others , too , besides my people Israel .
TLB	Isaiah	56	9	Come , wild animals of the field ; come , tear apart the sheep ; come , wild animals of the forest , devour my people . [ a ]
TLB	Isaiah	56	10	For the leaders of my people—the Lord ’ s watchmen , his shepherds—are all blind to every danger . They are featherbrained and give no warning when danger comes . They love to lie there , love to sleep , to dream .
TLB	Isaiah	56	11	And they are as greedy as dogs , never satisfied ; they are stupid shepherds who only look after their own interest , each trying to get as much as he can for himself from every possible source .

TLB	Isaiah	57	57	The good men perish ; the godly die before their time , and no one seems to care or wonder why . No one seems to realize that God is taking them away from evil days ahead .
TLB	Isaiah	57	2	For the godly who die shall rest in peace .
TLB	Isaiah	57	3	But you—come here , you witches ’ sons , you offspring of adulterers and harlots !
TLB	Isaiah	57	4	Who is it you mock , making faces and sticking out your tongues ? You children of sinners and liars !
TLB	Isaiah	57	5	You worship your idols with great zeal beneath the shade of every tree and slay your children as human sacrifices down in the valleys , under overhanging rocks .
TLB	Isaiah	57	6	Your gods are the smooth stones in the valleys . You worship them , and they , not I , are your inheritance . Does all this make me happy ? 7-8 You have committed adultery on the tops of the mountains , for you worship idols there , deserting me . Behind closed doors you set your idols up and worship someone other than me . This is adultery , for you are giving these idols your love instead of loving me .
TLB	Isaiah	57	9	You have taken pleasant incense and perfume to Molech as your gift . You have traveled far , even to hell itself , to find new gods to love .
TLB	Isaiah	57	10	You grew weary in your search , but you never gave up . You strengthened yourself and went on .
TLB	Isaiah	57	11	Why were you more afraid of them than of me ? How is it that you gave not even a second thought to me ? Is it because I ’ ve been too gentle that you have no fear of me ?
TLB	Isaiah	57	12	And then there is your “ righteousness ” and your “ good works ” —none of which will save you .
TLB	Isaiah	57	13	Let ’ s see if the whole collection of your idols can help you when you cry to them to save you ! They are so weak that the wind can carry them off ! A breath can puff them away . But he who trusts in me shall possess the land and inherit my holy mountain .
TLB	Isaiah	57	14	I will say , Rebuild the road ! Clear away the rocks and stones . Prepare a glorious highway for my people ’ s return from captivity .
TLB	Isaiah	57	15	The high and lofty One who inhabits eternity , the Holy One , says this : I live in that high and holy place where those with contrite , humble spirits dwell ; and I refresh the humble and give new courage to those with repentant hearts .
TLB	Isaiah	57	16	For I will not fight against you forever , nor always show my wrath ; if I did , all mankind would perish—the very souls that I have made .
TLB	Isaiah	57	17	I was angry and smote these greedy men . But they went right on sinning , doing everything their evil hearts desired .
TLB	Isaiah	57	18	I have seen what they do , but I will heal them anyway ! I will lead them and comfort them , helping them to mourn and to confess their sins .
TLB	Isaiah	57	19	Peace , peace to them , both near and far , for I will heal them all .
TLB	Isaiah	57	20	But those who still reject me [ a ] are like the restless sea , which is never still , but always churns up mire and dirt .
TLB	Isaiah	57	21	There is no peace , says my God , for them ! Footnotes - Isaiah 57:20 those who still reject me , literally , “ the wicked. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Isaiah	58	58	Shout with the voice of a trumpet blast ; tell my people of their sins !
TLB	Isaiah	58	2	Yet they act so pious ! They come to the Temple every day and are so delighted to hear the reading of my laws—just as though they would obey them—just as though they don ’ t despise the commandments of their God ! How anxious they are to worship correctly ; oh , how they love the Temple services !
TLB	Isaiah	58	3	“ We have fasted before you , ” they say . “ Why aren ’ t you impressed ? Why don ’ t you see our sacrifices ? Why don ’ t you hear our prayers ? We have done much penance , and you don ’ t even notice it ! ” I ’ ll tell you why ! Because you are living in evil pleasure even while you are fasting , and you keep right on oppressing your workers .
TLB	Isaiah	58	4	Look , what good is fasting when you keep on fighting and quarreling ? This kind of fasting will never get you anywhere with me .
TLB	Isaiah	58	5	Is this what I want—this doing of penance and bowing like reeds in the wind , putting on sackcloth and covering yourselves with ashes ? Is this what you call fasting ?
TLB	Isaiah	58	6	No , the kind of fast I want is that you stop oppressing those who work for you and treat them fairly and give them what they earn .
TLB	Isaiah	58	7	I want you to share your food with the hungry and bring right into your own homes those who are helpless , poor , and destitute . Clothe those who are cold , and don ’ t hide from relatives who need your help .
TLB	Isaiah	58	8	If you do these things , God will shed his own glorious light upon you . He will heal you ; your godliness will lead you forward , goodness will be a shield before you , and the glory of the Lord will protect you from behind .
TLB	Isaiah	58	9	Then , when you call , the Lord will answer . “ Yes , I am here , ” he will quickly reply . All you need to do is to stop oppressing the weak and stop making false accusations and spreading vicious rumors !
TLB	Isaiah	58	10	Feed the hungry ! Help those in trouble ! Then your light will shine out from the darkness , and the darkness around you shall be as bright as day .
TLB	Isaiah	58	11	And the Lord will guide you continually , and satisfy you with all good things , and keep you healthy too ; and you will be like a well-watered garden , like an ever-flowing spring .
TLB	Isaiah	58	12	Your sons will rebuild the long-deserted ruins of your cities , and you will be known as “ The People Who Rebuild Their Walls and Cities. ”
TLB	Isaiah	58	13	If you keep the Sabbath holy , not having your own fun and business on that day , but enjoying the Sabbath , speaking of it with delight as the Lord ’ s holy day , and honoring the Lord in what you do , not following your own desires and pleasure nor talking idly—
TLB	Isaiah	58	14	then the Lord will be your delight , and I will see to it that you ride high and get your full share of the blessings I promised to Jacob , your father . The Lord has spoken . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Isaiah	59	59	Listen now ! The Lord isn ’ t too weak to save you . And he isn ’ t getting deaf ! He can hear you when you call !
TLB	Isaiah	59	2	But the trouble is that your sins have cut you off from God . Because of sin he has turned his face away from you and will not listen anymore .
TLB	Isaiah	59	3	For your hands are those of murderers and your fingers are filthy with sin . You lie and grumble and oppose the good .
TLB	Isaiah	59	4	No one cares about being fair and true . Your lawsuits are based on lies ; you spend your time plotting evil deeds and doing them .
TLB	Isaiah	59	5	You spend your time and energy in spinning evil plans that end up in deadly actions .
TLB	Isaiah	59	6	You cheat and shortchange everyone . Everything you do is filled with sin ; violence is your trademark .
TLB	Isaiah	59	7	Your feet run to do evil and rush to murder ; your thoughts are only of sinning , and wherever you go you leave behind a trail of misery and death .
TLB	Isaiah	59	8	You don ’ t know what true peace is , nor what it means to be just and good ; you continually do wrong and those who follow you won ’ t experience any peace either .
TLB	Isaiah	59	9	It is because of all this evil that you aren ’ t finding God ’ s blessings ; that ’ s why he doesn ’ t punish those who injure you . No wonder you are in darkness when you expected light . No wonder you are walking in the gloom .
TLB	Isaiah	59	10	No wonder you grope like blind men and stumble along in broad daylight , yes , even at brightest noontime , as though it were the darkest night ! No wonder you are like corpses when compared with vigorous young men !
TLB	Isaiah	59	11	You roar like hungry bears ; you moan with mournful cries like doves . You look for God to keep you , but he doesn ’ t . He has turned away .
TLB	Isaiah	59	12	For your sins keep piling up before the righteous God and testify against you . Yes , we know what sinners we are .
TLB	Isaiah	59	13	We know our disobedience ; we have denied the Lord our God . We know what rebels we are and how unfair we are , for we carefully plan our lies .
TLB	Isaiah	59	14	Our courts oppose the righteous man ; fairness is unknown . Truth falls dead in the streets , and justice is outlawed .
TLB	Isaiah	59	15	Yes , truth is gone , and anyone who tries a better life is soon attacked . The Lord saw all the evil and was displeased to find no steps taken against sin .
TLB	Isaiah	59	16	He saw no one was helping you and wondered that no one intervened . Therefore he himself stepped in to save you through his mighty power and justice .
TLB	Isaiah	59	17	He put on righteousness as armor and the helmet of salvation on his head . He clothed himself with robes of vengeance and of godly fury .
TLB	Isaiah	59	18	He will repay his enemies for their evil deeds—fury for his foes in distant lands .
TLB	Isaiah	59	19	Then at last they will reverence and glorify the name of God from west to east . For he will come like a flood tide driven by Jehovah ’ s breath .
TLB	Isaiah	59	20	He will come as a Redeemer to those in Zion who have turned away from sin .
TLB	Isaiah	59	21	“ As for me , this is my promise to them , ” says the Lord : “ My Holy Spirit shall not leave them , and they shall want the good and hate the wrong—they and their children and their children ’ s children forever. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Isaiah	61	61	The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me , because the Lord has anointed me to bring good news to the suffering and afflicted . He has sent me to comfort the brokenhearted , to announce liberty to captives , and to open the eyes of the blind .
TLB	Isaiah	61	2	He has sent me to tell those who mourn that the time of God ’ s favor to them has come , and the day of his wrath to their enemies .
TLB	Isaiah	61	3	To all who mourn in Israel he will give : beauty for ashes ; joy instead of mourning ; praise instead of heaviness . For God has planted them like strong and graceful oaks for his own glory .
TLB	Isaiah	61	4	And they shall rebuild the ancient ruins , repairing cities long ago destroyed , reviving them though they have lain there many generations .

TLB	Isaiah	62	62	Because I love Zion , because my heart yearns for Jerusalem , I will not cease to pray for her or to cry out to God on her behalf until she shines forth in his righteousness and is glorious in his salvation .
TLB	Isaiah	62	2	The nations shall see your righteousness . Kings shall be blinded by your glory ; and God will confer on you a new name .
TLB	Isaiah	62	3	He will hold you aloft in his hands for all to see—a splendid crown for the King of kings .
TLB	Isaiah	62	4	Never again shall you be called “ The God-forsaken Land ” or the “ Land That God Forgot. ” Your new name will be “ The Land of God ’ s Delight ” and “ The Bride , ” for the Lord delights in you and will claim you as his own .
TLB	Isaiah	62	5	Your children will care for you , O Jerusalem , with joy like that of a young man who marries a virgin ; and God will rejoice over you as a bridegroom with his bride . 6-7 O Jerusalem , I have set intercessors [ a ] on your walls who shall cry to God all day and all night for the fulfillment of his promises . Take no rest , all you who pray , and give God no rest until he establishes Jerusalem and makes her respected and admired throughout the earth .

TLB	Isaiah	63	63	Who is this who comes from Edom , from the city of Bozrah , with his magnificent garments of crimson ? Who is this in royal robes , marching in the greatness of his strength ? “ It is I , the Lord , announcing your salvation ; I , the Lord , the one who is mighty to save ! ”
TLB	Isaiah	63	2	“ Why are your clothes so red , as from treading out the grapes ? ”
TLB	Isaiah	63	3	“ I have trodden the winepress alone . No one was there to help me . In my wrath I have trodden my enemies like grapes . In my fury I trampled my foes . It is their blood you see upon my clothes .
TLB	Isaiah	63	4	For the time has come for me to avenge my people , to redeem them from the hands of their oppressors .
TLB	Isaiah	63	5	I looked but no one came to help them ; I was amazed and appalled . So I executed vengeance alone ; unaided , I meted out judgment .
TLB	Isaiah	63	6	I crushed the heathen nations in my anger and made them stagger and fall to the ground. ”
TLB	Isaiah	63	7	I will tell of the loving-kindnesses of God . I will praise him for all he has done ; I will rejoice in his great goodness to Israel , which he has granted in accordance with his mercy and love .
TLB	Isaiah	63	8	He said , “ They are my very own ; surely they will not be false again. ” And he became their Savior .
TLB	Isaiah	63	9	In all their affliction he was afflicted , and he personally saved them . [ a ] In his love and pity he redeemed them and lifted them up and carried them through all the years .
TLB	Isaiah	63	10	But they rebelled against him and grieved his Holy Spirit . That is why he became their enemy and personally fought against them .
TLB	Isaiah	63	11	Then they remembered those days of old when Moses , God ’ s servant , led his people out of Egypt , and they cried out , “ Where is the One who brought Israel through the sea , with Moses as their shepherd ? Where is the God who sent his Holy Spirit to be among his people ?
TLB	Isaiah	63	12	Where is he whose mighty power divided the sea before them when Moses lifted up his hand , and established his reputation forever ?
TLB	Isaiah	63	13	Who led them through the bottom of the sea ? Like fine stallions racing through the desert , they never stumbled .
TLB	Isaiah	63	14	Like cattle grazing in the valleys , so the Spirit of the Lord gave them rest . Thus he gave himself a magnificent reputation. ”
TLB	Isaiah	63	15	O Lord , look down from heaven and see us from your holy , glorious home ; where is the love for us you used to show—your power , your mercy , and your compassion ? Where are they now ?
TLB	Isaiah	63	16	Surely you are still our Father ! Even if Abraham and Jacob would disown us , still you would be our Father , our Redeemer from ages past .
TLB	Isaiah	63	17	O Lord , why have you hardened our hearts and made us sin and turn against you ? Return and help us , for we who belong to you need you so . [ b ]
TLB	Isaiah	63	18	How briefly we possessed Jerusalem ! And now our enemies have destroyed her .
TLB	Isaiah	63	19	O God , why do you treat us as though we weren ’ t your people , as though we were a heathen nation that never called you “ Lord ” ? Footnotes - Isaiah 63:9 In all their affliction he was afflicted , and he personally saved them , or “ The Angel of his Presence saved them out of their affliction. ” - Isaiah 63:17 for we who belong to you need you so , literally , “ for your servants ’ sake. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Isaiah	64	64	Oh , that you would burst forth from the skies and come down ! How the mountains would quake in your presence !
TLB	Isaiah	64	2	The consuming fire of your glory would burn down the forests and boil the oceans dry . The nations would tremble before you ; then your enemies would learn the reason for your fame !
TLB	Isaiah	64	3	So it was before when you came down , for you did awesome things beyond our highest expectations , and how the mountains quaked !
TLB	Isaiah	64	4	For since the world began no one has seen or heard of such a God as ours , who works for those who wait for him !
TLB	Isaiah	64	5	You welcome those who cheerfully do good , who follow godly ways . But we are not godly ; we are constant sinners and have been all our lives . Therefore your wrath is heavy on us . How can such as we be saved ?
TLB	Isaiah	64	6	We are all infected and impure with sin . When we put on our prized robes of righteousness , we find they are but filthy rags . [ a ] Like autumn leaves we fade , wither , and fall . And our sins , like the wind , sweep us away .
TLB	Isaiah	64	7	Yet no one calls upon your name or pleads with you for mercy . Therefore , you have turned away from us and turned us over to our sins .
TLB	Isaiah	64	8	And yet , O Lord , you are our Father . We are the clay and you are the Potter . We are all formed by your hand .
TLB	Isaiah	64	9	Oh , be not so angry with us , Lord , nor forever remember our sins . Oh , look and see that we are all your people .
TLB	Isaiah	64	10	Your holy cities are destroyed ; Jerusalem is a desolate wilderness .
TLB	Isaiah	64	11	Our holy , beautiful Temple where our fathers praised you is burned down , and all the things of beauty are destroyed .
TLB	Isaiah	64	12	After all of this , must you still refuse to help us , Lord ? Will you stand silent and still punish us ? Footnotes - Isaiah 64:6 filthy rags , literally , “ filthy as a menstruating woman ’ s rags. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Isaiah	65	65	The Lord says , People [ a ] who never before inquired about me are now seeking me out . Nations who never before searched for me are finding me .
TLB	Isaiah	65	2	But my own people—though I have been spreading out my arms to welcome them all day long—have rebelled ; they follow their own evil paths and thoughts .
TLB	Isaiah	65	3	All day long they insult me to my face by worshiping idols in many gardens and burning incense on the rooftops of their homes .
TLB	Isaiah	65	4	At night they go out among the graves and caves to worship evil spirits , and they eat pork and other forbidden foods .
TLB	Isaiah	65	5	Yet they say to one another , “ Don ’ t come too close , you ’ ll defile me ! For I am holier than you ! ” They stifle me . Day in and day out they infuriate me .
TLB	Isaiah	65	6	See , here is my decree all written out before me : I will not stand silent ; I will repay . Yes , I will repay them—
TLB	Isaiah	65	7	not only for their own sins but for those of their fathers too , says the Lord , for they also burned incense on the mountains and insulted me upon the hills . I will pay them back in full .
TLB	Isaiah	65	8	But I will not destroy them all , says the Lord ; for just as good grapes are found among a cluster of bad ones ( and someone will say , “ Don ’ t throw them all away—there are some good grapes there ! ” ) so I will not destroy all Israel , for I have true servants there .
TLB	Isaiah	65	9	I will preserve a remnant of my people to possess the land of Israel ; those I select will inherit it and serve me there .
TLB	Isaiah	65	10	As for my people who have sought me , the plains of Sharon shall again be filled with flocks , and the valley of Achor shall be a place to pasture herds .
TLB	Isaiah	65	11	But because the rest of you have forsaken the Lord and his Temple and worship gods of “ Fate ” and “ Destiny , ”
TLB	Isaiah	65	12	therefore I will “ destine ” you to the sword , and your “ fate ” shall be a dark one ; for when I called , you didn ’ t answer ; when I spoke , you wouldn ’ t listen . You deliberately sinned before my very eyes , choosing to do what you know I despise .
TLB	Isaiah	65	13	Therefore , the Lord God says : You shall starve , but my servants shall eat ; you shall be thirsty while they drink ; you shall be sad and ashamed , but they shall rejoice .
TLB	Isaiah	65	14	You shall cry in sorrow and vexation and despair , while they sing for joy .
TLB	Isaiah	65	15	Your name shall be a curse word among my people , for the Lord God will slay you and call his true servants by another name . [ b ]
TLB	Isaiah	65	16	And yet , the days will come [ c ] when all who invoke a blessing or take an oath shall swear by the God of Truth ; for I will put aside my anger and forget the evil that you did .
TLB	Isaiah	65	17	For see , I am creating new heavens and a new earth—so wonderful that no one will even think about the old ones anymore .
TLB	Isaiah	65	18	Be glad ; rejoice forever in my creation . Look ! I will re-create Jerusalem as a place of happiness , and her people shall be a joy !
TLB	Isaiah	65	19	And I will rejoice in Jerusalem and in my people ; and the voice of weeping and crying shall not be heard there anymore .
TLB	Isaiah	65	20	No longer will babies die when only a few days old ; no longer will men be considered old at
TLB	Isaiah	65	100	! Only sinners will die that young ! 21-22 In those days , when a man builds a house , he will keep on living in it—it will not be destroyed by invading armies as in the past . My people will plant vineyards and eat the fruit themselves—their enemies will not confiscate it . For my people will live as long as trees and will long enjoy their hard-won gains .
TLB	Isaiah	65	23	Their harvests will not be eaten by their enemies ; their children will not be born to be cannon fodder . For they are the children of those the Lord has blessed ; and their children , too , shall be blessed .
TLB	Isaiah	65	24	I will answer them before they even call to me . While they are still talking to me about their needs , I will go ahead and answer their prayers !
TLB	Isaiah	65	25	The wolf and lamb shall feed together , the lion shall eat straw as the ox does , and poisonous snakes shall strike no more ! [ d ] In those days nothing and no one shall be hurt or destroyed in all my holy mountain , says the Lord . Footnotes - Isaiah 65:1 People , literally , “ those. ” Also , Nations .

TLB	Isaiah	66	66	Heaven is my throne and the earth is my footstool : What Temple can you build for me as good as that ?
TLB	Isaiah	66	2	My hand has made both earth and skies , and they are mine . Yet I will look with pity on the man who has a humble and a contrite heart , who trembles at my word .
TLB	Isaiah	66	3	But those who choose their own ways , delighting in their sins , are cursed . God will not accept their offerings . When such men sacrifice an ox on the altar of God , it is no more acceptable to him than human sacrifice . If they sacrifice a lamb or bring an offering of grain , it is as loathsome to God as putting a dog or the blood of a swine on his altar ! When they burn incense to him , he counts it the same as though they blessed an idol .
TLB	Isaiah	66	4	I will send great troubles upon them—all the things they feared , for when I called them , they refused to answer , and when I spoke to them , they would not hear . Instead , they did wrong before my eyes and chose what they knew I despised .
TLB	Isaiah	66	5	Hear the words of God , all you who fear him , and tremble at his words : Your brethren hate you and cast you out for being loyal to my name . “ Glory to God , ” they scoff . “ Be happy in the Lord ! ” But they shall be put to shame .
TLB	Isaiah	66	6	What is all the commotion in the city ? What is that terrible noise from the Temple ? It is the voice of the Lord taking vengeance upon his enemies . 7-8 Who has heard or seen anything as strange as this ? For in one day , suddenly , a nation , Israel , shall be born , even before the birth pains come . In a moment , just as Israel ’ s anguish starts , the baby is born ; the nation begins .
TLB	Isaiah	66	9	Shall I bring to the point of birth and then not deliver ? asks the Lord your God . No ! Never !
TLB	Isaiah	66	10	Rejoice with Jerusalem ; be glad with her , all you who love her , you who mourned for her .
TLB	Isaiah	66	11	Delight in Jerusalem ; drink deep of her glory even as an infant at a mother ’ s generous breasts .
TLB	Isaiah	66	12	Prosperity shall overflow Jerusalem like a river , says the Lord , for I will send it ; the riches of the Gentiles will flow to her . Her children shall be nursed at her breasts , carried on her hips and dandled on her knees .
TLB	Isaiah	66	13	I will comfort you there as a little one is comforted by its mother .
TLB	Isaiah	66	14	When you see Jerusalem , your heart will rejoice ; vigorous health will be yours . All the world will see the good hand of God upon his people and his wrath upon his enemies .
TLB	Isaiah	66	15	For see , the Lord will come with fire and with swift chariots of doom to pour out the fury of his anger and his hot rebuke with flames of fire .
TLB	Isaiah	66	16	For the Lord will punish the world by fire and by his sword , and the slain of the Lord shall be many !
TLB	Isaiah	66	17	Those who worship idols that are hidden behind a tree in the garden , feasting there on pork and mouse and all forbidden meat—they will come to an evil end , says Jehovah .
TLB	Isaiah	66	18	I see full well what they are doing ; I know what they are thinking , so I will gather together all nations and people against Jerusalem , where they shall see my glory .
TLB	Isaiah	66	19	I will perform a mighty miracle against them , and I will send those who escape , [ a ] as missionaries to the nations—to Tarshish , Put , Lud , Meshech , Rosh , Tubal , Javan , and to the lands beyond the sea that have not heard my fame nor seen my glory . There they shall declare my glory to the Gentiles .
TLB	Isaiah	66	20	And they shall bring back all your brethren from every nation as a gift to the Lord , transporting them gently [ b ] on horses and in chariots , and in litters , and on mules and camels , to my holy mountain , to Jerusalem , says the Lord . It will be like offerings flowing into the Temple of the Lord at harvesttime , carried in vessels consecrated to the Lord .
TLB	Isaiah	66	21	And I will appoint some of those returning to be my priests and Levites , says the Lord .
TLB	Isaiah	66	22	As surely as my new heavens and earth shall remain , so surely shall you always be my people , with a name that shall never disappear .
TLB	Isaiah	66	23	All mankind shall come to worship me from week to week and month to month .
TLB	Isaiah	66	24	And they shall go out and look at the dead bodies of those who have rebelled against me , for their worm shall never die ; their fire shall not be quenched ; and they shall be a disgusting sight to all mankind . Footnotes - Isaiah 66:19 I will send those who escape . It is not clear from the Hebrew whether “ those who escape ” means survivors of the armies of the nations , or survivors of the Jews in Israel . The context seems to favor the former .

TLB	Jeremiah	1	1	1-2 These are God ’ s messages to Jeremiah the priest ( the son of Hilkiah ) who lived in the town of Anathoth in the land of Benjamin . The first of these messages came to him in the thirteenth year of the reign of Amon ’ s son Josiah , king of Judah .
TLB	Jeremiah	1	3	Others came during the reign of Josiah ’ s son Jehoiakim , king of Judah , and at various other times until July of the eleventh year of the reign of Josiah ’ s son Zedekiah , king of Judah , when Jerusalem was captured and the people were taken away as slaves .
TLB	Jeremiah	1	4	The Lord said to me ,
TLB	Jeremiah	1	5	“ I knew you before you were formed within your mother ’ s womb ; before you were born I sanctified you and appointed you as my spokesman to the world. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	1	6	“ O Lord God , ” I said , “ I can ’ t do that ! I ’ m far too young ! I ’ m only a youth ! ”
TLB	Jeremiah	1	7	“ Don ’ t say that , ” he replied , “ for you will go wherever I send you and speak whatever I tell you to .
TLB	Jeremiah	1	8	And don ’ t be afraid of the people , for I , the Lord , will be with you and see you through. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	1	9	Then he touched my mouth and said , “ See , I have put my words in your mouth !
TLB	Jeremiah	1	10	Today your work begins , to warn the nations and the kingdoms of the world . In accord with my words spoken through your mouth I will tear down some and destroy them , and plant others , nurture them , and make them strong and great. ”

TLB	Jeremiah	1	13	Then the Lord asked me , “ What do you see now ? ” And I replied , “ I see a pot of boiling water , tipping southward , spilling over Judah. ” [ b ]
TLB	Jeremiah	1	14	“ Yes , ” he said , “ for terror from the north will boil out upon all the people of this land .
TLB	Jeremiah	1	15	I am calling the armies of the kingdoms of the north to come to Jerusalem and set their thrones at the gates of the city and all along its walls , and in all the other cities of Judah .
TLB	Jeremiah	1	16	This is the way I will punish my people for deserting me and for worshiping other gods—yes , idols they themselves have made !
TLB	Jeremiah	1	17	Get up and dress and go out and tell them whatever I tell you to say . Don ’ t be afraid of them , or else I will make a fool of you in front of them .
TLB	Jeremiah	1	18	For see , today I have made you impervious to their attacks . They can not harm you . You are strong like a fortified city that can not be captured , like an iron pillar and heavy gates of brass . All the kings of Judah , its officers , priests , and people will not be able to prevail against you .
TLB	Jeremiah	1	19	They will try , but they will fail . For I am with you , ” says the Lord . “ I will deliver you. ” Footnotes - Jeremiah 1:12 I will surely carry out my threats of punishment . There is a wordplay here between shaqedh ( almond ) in v.

TLB	Jeremiah	2	2	Go and shout this in Jerusalem ’ s streets : This is what the Lord says ! I remember how eager you were to please me as a young bride long ago , how you loved me and followed me even through the barren deserts .
TLB	Jeremiah	2	3	In those days Israel was a holy people , the first of my children . [ a ] All who harmed them were counted deeply guilty , and great evil fell on anyone who touched them . 4-5 O Israel , says the Lord , why did your fathers desert me ? What sin did they find in me that turned them away and changed them into fools who worship idols ?
TLB	Jeremiah	2	6	They ignore the fact that it was I , the Lord , who brought them safely out of Egypt and led them through the barren wilderness , a land of deserts and rocks , of drought and death , where no one lives or even travels .
TLB	Jeremiah	2	7	And I brought them into a fruitful land , to eat of its bounty and goodness , but they made it into a land of sin and corruption and turned my inheritance into an evil thing .
TLB	Jeremiah	2	8	Even their priests cared nothing for the Lord , and their judges ignored me ; their rulers turned against me , and their prophets worshiped Baal and wasted their time on nonsense .
TLB	Jeremiah	2	9	But I will not give you up—I will plead for you to return to me and will keep on pleading ; yes , even with your children ’ s children in the years to come ! 10-11 Look around you and see if you can find another nation anywhere that has traded in its old gods for new ones—even though their gods are nothing . Send to the west to the island of Cyprus ; send to the east to the deserts of Kedar . See if anyone there has ever heard so strange a thing as this . And yet my people have given up their glorious God for silly idols !
TLB	Jeremiah	2	12	The heavens are shocked at such a thing and shrink back in horror and dismay .
TLB	Jeremiah	2	13	For my people have done two evil things : They have forsaken me , the Fountain of living waters ; and they have built for themselves broken cisterns that can ’ t hold water !
TLB	Jeremiah	2	14	Why has Israel become a nation of slaves ? Why is she captured and led far away ?
TLB	Jeremiah	2	15	I see great armies marching on Jerusalem with mighty shouts [ b ] to destroy her and leave her cities in ruins , burned and desolate .
TLB	Jeremiah	2	16	I see the armies of Egypt rising against her , marching from their cities of Memphis and Tahpanhes to utterly destroy Israel ’ s glory and power .
TLB	Jeremiah	2	17	And you have brought this on yourselves by rebelling against the Lord your God when he wanted to lead you and show you the way !
TLB	Jeremiah	2	18	What have you gained by your alliances with Egypt and with Assyria ?
TLB	Jeremiah	2	19	Your own wickedness will punish you . You will see what an evil , bitter thing it is to rebel against the Lord your God , fearlessly forsaking him , says the Lord Almighty .
TLB	Jeremiah	2	20	Long ago you shook off my yoke and broke away from my ties . Defiant , you would not obey me . On every hill and under every tree you ’ ve bowed low before idols .
TLB	Jeremiah	2	21	How could this happen ? How could this be ? For when I planted you , I chose my seed so carefully—the very best . Why have you become this degenerate race of evil men ?
TLB	Jeremiah	2	22	No amount of soap or lye can make you clean . You are stained with guilt that can not ever be washed away . I see it always before me , the Lord God says .
TLB	Jeremiah	2	23	You say it isn ’ t so , that you haven ’ t worshiped idols ? How can you say a thing like that ? Go and look in any valley in the land ! Face the awful sins that you have done , O restless female camel , seeking for a male !
TLB	Jeremiah	2	24	You are a wild donkey , sniffing the wind at mating time . ( Who can restrain your lust ? ) Any jack wanting you need not search , for you come running to him !
TLB	Jeremiah	2	25	Why don ’ t you turn from all this weary running after other gods ? But you say , “ Don ’ t waste your breath . I ’ ve fallen in love with these strangers and I can ’ t stop loving them now ! ” 26-27 Like a thief , the only shame that Israel knows is getting caught . Kings , princes , priests , and prophets—all are alike in this . They call a carved-up wooden post their father , and for their mother they have an idol chiseled out from stone . Yet in time of trouble they cry to me to save them !
TLB	Jeremiah	2	28	Why don ’ t you call on these gods you have made ? When danger comes , let them go out and save you if they can ! For you have as many gods as there are cities in Judah .
TLB	Jeremiah	2	29	Don ’ t come to me—you are all rebels , says the Lord .
TLB	Jeremiah	2	30	I have punished your children , but it did them no good ; they still will not obey . And you yourselves have killed my prophets as a lion kills its prey .
TLB	Jeremiah	2	31	O my people , listen to the words of God : Have I been unjust to Israel ? Have I been to them a land of darkness and of evil ? Why then do my people say , “ At last we are free from God ; we won ’ t have anything to do with him again ! ”
TLB	Jeremiah	2	32	How can you disown your God like that ? [ c ] Can a girl forget her jewels ? What bride will seek to hide her wedding dress ? Yet for years on end my people have forgotten me—the most precious of their treasures .
TLB	Jeremiah	2	33	How you plot and scheme to win your lovers . The most experienced harlot could learn a lot from you !
TLB	Jeremiah	2	34	Your clothing is stained with the blood of the innocent and the poor . Brazenly you murder without a cause .
TLB	Jeremiah	2	35	And yet you say , “ I haven ’ t done a thing to anger God . I ’ m sure he isn ’ t angry ! ” [ d ] I will punish you severely because you say , “ I haven ’ t sinned ! ”
TLB	Jeremiah	2	36	First here , then there , you flit about , going from one ally to another for their help ; but it ’ s all no good—your new friends in Egypt will forsake you as Assyria did before .
TLB	Jeremiah	2	37	You will be left in despair and cover your face with your hands , for the Lord has rejected the ones that you trust . You will not succeed despite their aid .

TLB	Jeremiah	3	3	That is why even the springtime rains have failed . For you are a prostitute and completely unashamed . 4-5 And yet you say to me , “ O Father , you have always been my Friend ; surely you won ’ t be angry about such a little thing ! Surely you will just forget it ? ” So you talk and keep right on doing all the evil that you can .
TLB	Jeremiah	3	2	Is there a single spot in all the land where you haven ’ t been defiled by your adulteries—your worshiping these other gods ? [ b ] You sit like a prostitute beside the road waiting for a client ! You sit alone like a Bedouin in the desert . You have polluted the land with your vile prostitution .
TLB	Jeremiah	3	6	This message from the Lord came to me during the reign of King Josiah : Have you seen what Israel does ? Like a wanton wife who gives herself to other men at every chance , so Israel has worshiped other gods on every hill , beneath every shady tree .
TLB	Jeremiah	3	7	I thought that someday she would return to me and once again be mine ; but she didn ’ t come back . And her faithless sister Judah saw the continued rebellion of Israel .
TLB	Jeremiah	3	8	Yet she paid no attention , even though she saw that I divorced faithless Israel . But now Judah too has left me and given herself to prostitution , for she has gone to other gods to worship them .
TLB	Jeremiah	3	9	She treated it all so lightly—to her it was nothing at all that she should worship idols made of wood and stone . And so the land was greatly polluted and defiled .
TLB	Jeremiah	3	10	Then , afterwards , this faithless one “ returned ” to me , but her “ sorrow ” was only faked , the Lord God says .
TLB	Jeremiah	3	11	In fact , faithless Israel is less guilty than treacherous Judah !
TLB	Jeremiah	3	12	Therefore , go and say to Israel , O Israel , my sinful people , come home to me again , for I am merciful ; I will not be forever angry with you .
TLB	Jeremiah	3	13	Only acknowledge your guilt ; admit that you rebelled against the Lord your God and committed adultery against him by worshiping idols under every tree ; confess that you refused to follow me .
TLB	Jeremiah	3	14	O sinful children , come home , for I am your Master , and I will bring you again to the land of Israel—one from here and two from there , wherever you are scattered .
TLB	Jeremiah	3	15	And I will give you leaders after my own heart , who will guide you with wisdom and understanding .
TLB	Jeremiah	3	16	Then , when your land is once more filled with people , says the Lord , you will no longer wish for “ the good old days of long ago ” when you possessed the Ark of God ’ s covenant . Those days will not be missed or even thought about , and the Ark will not be reconstructed , for the Lord himself will be among you .
TLB	Jeremiah	3	17	The whole city of Jerusalem will be known as the throne of the Lord ; all nations will come to him there and no longer stubbornly follow their evil desires .
TLB	Jeremiah	3	18	At that time the people of Judah and of Israel will return together from their exile in the north , to the land I gave their fathers as an inheritance forever .
TLB	Jeremiah	3	19	And I thought how wonderful it would be for you to be here among my children . I planned to give you part of this beautiful land , the finest in the world . I looked forward to your calling me “ Father ” and thought that you would never turn away from me again .
TLB	Jeremiah	3	20	But you have betrayed me ; you have gone off and given yourself to a host of foreign gods ; you have been like a faithless wife who leaves her husband .
TLB	Jeremiah	3	21	I hear a voice high upon the windswept mountains , crying , crying . It is the sons of Israel who have turned their backs on God and wandered far away .
TLB	Jeremiah	3	22	O my rebellious children , come back to me again and I will heal you from your sins . And they reply , Yes , we will come , for you are the Lord our God .
TLB	Jeremiah	3	23	We are weary of worshiping idols on the hills and of having orgies on the mountains . It is all a farce . Only in the Lord our God can Israel ever find her help and her salvation .
TLB	Jeremiah	3	24	From our childhood we have seen everything our fathers had—flocks and herds and sons and daughters—squandered on priests and idols .
TLB	Jeremiah	3	25	We lie in shame and in dishonor , for we and our fathers have sinned from childhood against the Lord our God ; we have not obeyed him .

TLB	Jeremiah	4	4	Cleanse your minds and hearts , [ a ] not just your bodies , or else my anger will burn you to a crisp because of all your sins . And no one will be able to put the fire out .
TLB	Jeremiah	4	2	and if you will swear by me alone , the living God , and begin to live good , honest , clean lives , then you will be a testimony to the nations of the world , and they will come to me and glorify my name .
TLB	Jeremiah	4	3	The Lord is saying to the men of Judah and Jerusalem , Plow up the hardness of your hearts ; otherwise the good seed will be wasted among the thorns .
TLB	Jeremiah	4	5	Shout to Jerusalem and to all Judea , telling them to sound the alarm throughout the land . “ Run for your lives ! Flee to the fortified cities ! ”
TLB	Jeremiah	4	6	Send a signal from Jerusalem : “ Flee now , don ’ t delay ! ” For I the Lord am bringing vast destruction on you from the north . [ b ]
TLB	Jeremiah	4	7	A lion—a destroyer of nations—stalks from his lair ; and he is headed for your land . Your cities will lie in ruin without inhabitant .
TLB	Jeremiah	4	8	Put on clothes of mourning and weep with broken hearts , for the fierce anger of the Lord has not stopped yet .
TLB	Jeremiah	4	9	In that day , says the Lord , the king and the princes will tremble in fear ; and the priests and the prophets will be stricken with horror .
TLB	Jeremiah	4	10	( Then I said , “ But Lord , the people have been deceived by what you said , for you promised great blessings on Jerusalem . Yet the sword is even now poised to strike them dead ! ” ) 11-12 At that time he will send a burning wind from the desert upon them—not in little gusts but in a roaring blast—and he will pronounce their doom .
TLB	Jeremiah	4	13	The enemy shall roll down upon us like a storm wind ; his chariots are like a whirlwind ; his steeds are swifter than eagles . Woe , woe upon us , for we are doomed .
TLB	Jeremiah	4	14	O Jerusalem , cleanse your hearts while there is time . You can yet be saved by casting out your evil thoughts .
TLB	Jeremiah	4	15	From Dan and from Mount Ephraim your doom has been announced .
TLB	Jeremiah	4	16	Warn the other nations that the enemy is coming from a distant land , and they shout against Jerusalem and the cities of Judah .
TLB	Jeremiah	4	17	They surround Jerusalem like shepherds moving in on some wild animal ! For my people have rebelled against me , says the Lord .
TLB	Jeremiah	4	18	Your ways have brought this down upon you ; it is a bitter dose of your own medicine , striking deep within your hearts .
TLB	Jeremiah	4	19	My heart , my heart—I writhe in pain ; my heart pounds within me . I can not be still because I have heard , O my soul , the blast of the enemies ’ trumpets and the enemies ’ battle cries .
TLB	Jeremiah	4	20	Wave upon wave of destruction rolls over the land , until it lies in utter ruin ; suddenly , in a moment , every house is crushed .
TLB	Jeremiah	4	21	How long must this go on ? How long must I see war and death surrounding me ?
TLB	Jeremiah	4	22	“ Until my people leave their foolishness , for they refuse to listen to me ; they are dull , retarded children who have no understanding . They are smart enough at doing wrong , but for doing right they have no talent , none at all. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	4	23	I looked down upon their land , and as far as I could see in all directions everything was ruins . And all the heavens were dark .
TLB	Jeremiah	4	24	I looked at the mountains and saw that they trembled and shook .
TLB	Jeremiah	4	25	I looked , and mankind was gone , and the birds of the heavens had fled .
TLB	Jeremiah	4	26	The fertile valleys were wilderness , and all the cities were broken down before the presence of the Lord , crushed by his fierce anger .
TLB	Jeremiah	4	27	The Lord ’ s decree of desolation covers all the land . “ Yet , ” he says , “ there will be a little remnant of my people left .
TLB	Jeremiah	4	28	The earth shall mourn , the heavens shall be draped with black , because of my decree against my people ; I have made up my mind and will not change it. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	4	29	All the cities flee in terror at the noise of marching armies coming near . The people hide in the bushes and flee to the mountains . All the cities are abandoned—all have fled in terror .
TLB	Jeremiah	4	30	Why do you put on your most beautiful clothing and jewelry and brighten your eyes with mascara ? It will do you no good ! Your allies despise you and will kill you .
TLB	Jeremiah	4	31	I have heard great crying like that of a woman giving birth to her first child ; it is the cry of my people gasping for breath , pleading for help , prostrate before their murderers .

TLB	Jeremiah	5	5	I will go now to their leaders , the men of importance , and speak to them , for they know the ways of the Lord and the judgment that follows sin . But they too had utterly rejected their God .
TLB	Jeremiah	5	2	Even under oath , they all lie .
TLB	Jeremiah	5	3	O Lord , you are looking for faithfulness . You have tried to get them to be honest , for you have punished them , but they won ’ t change ! You have destroyed them , but they refuse to turn from their sins . They are determined , with faces hard as rock , not to repent .
TLB	Jeremiah	5	4	Then I said , “ But what can we expect from the poor and ignorant ? They don ’ t know the ways of God . How can they obey him ? ”
TLB	Jeremiah	5	6	So I will send upon them the wild fury of the “ lion from the forest ” ; the “ desert wolves ” shall pounce upon them , and a “ leopard ” shall lurk around their cities so that all who go out shall be torn apart . For their sins are very many ; their rebellion against me is great .
TLB	Jeremiah	5	7	How can I pardon you ? For even your children have turned away and worship gods that are not gods at all . I fed my people until they were fully satisfied , and their thanks was to commit adultery wholesale and to gang up at the city ’ s brothels .
TLB	Jeremiah	5	8	They are well-fed , lusty stallions , each neighing for his neighbor ’ s mate .
TLB	Jeremiah	5	9	Shall I not punish them for this ? Shall I not send my vengeance on such a nation as this ?
TLB	Jeremiah	5	10	Go down the rows of the vineyards and destroy them ! But leave a scattered few to live . Strip the branches from each vine , for they are not the Lord ’ s .
TLB	Jeremiah	5	11	For the people of Israel and Judah are full of treachery against me , says the Lord .
TLB	Jeremiah	5	12	They have lied and said , “ He won ’ t bother us ! No evil will come upon us ! There will be neither famine nor war !
TLB	Jeremiah	5	13	God ’ s prophets , ” they say , “ are windbags full of words with no divine authority . Their claims of doom will fall upon themselves , not us ! ”
TLB	Jeremiah	5	14	Therefore , this is what the Lord God of Hosts says to his prophets : Because of talk like this , I ’ ll take your words and prophecies and turn them into raging fire and burn up these people like kindling wood .
TLB	Jeremiah	5	15	See , I will bring a distant nation against you , O Israel , says the Lord . It is a mighty nation , an ancient nation [ a ] whose language you don ’ t understand .
TLB	Jeremiah	5	16	Their weapons are deadly ; the men are all mighty .
TLB	Jeremiah	5	17	And they shall eat your harvest and your children ’ s bread , your flocks of sheep and herds of cattle , yes , and your grapes and figs ; and they shall sack your walled cities that you think are safe .
TLB	Jeremiah	5	18	But I will not completely blot you out . So says the Lord .
TLB	Jeremiah	5	19	And when your people ask , “ Why is it that the Lord is doing this to us ? ” then you shall say , “ You rejected him and gave yourselves to other gods while in your land ; now you must be slaves to foreigners in their lands. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	5	20	Make this announcement to Judah and to Israel :
TLB	Jeremiah	5	21	Listen , O foolish , senseless people—you with the eyes that do not see and the ears that do not listen—
TLB	Jeremiah	5	22	have you no respect at all for me ? the Lord God asks . How can it be that you don ’ t even tremble in my presence ? I set the shorelines of the world by perpetual decrees , so that the oceans , though they toss and roar , can never pass those bounds . Isn ’ t such a God to be feared and worshiped ? 23-24 But my people have rebellious hearts ; they have turned against me and gone off into idolatry . Though I am the one who gives them rain each year in spring and fall and sends the harvesttimes , yet they have no respect or fear for me .
TLB	Jeremiah	5	25	And so I have taken away these wondrous blessings from them . This sin has robbed them of all of these good things .
TLB	Jeremiah	5	26	Among my people are wicked men who lurk for victims like a hunter hiding in a blind . They set their traps for men .
TLB	Jeremiah	5	27	Like a coop full of chickens their homes are full of evil plots . And the result ? Now they are great and rich ,
TLB	Jeremiah	5	28	they are well fed and well groomed , and there is no limit to their wicked deeds . They refuse justice to orphans and the rights of the poor .
TLB	Jeremiah	5	29	Should I sit back and act as though nothing is going on ? the Lord God asks . Shouldn ’ t I punish a nation such as this ?
TLB	Jeremiah	5	30	A horrible thing has happened in this land—
TLB	Jeremiah	5	31	the priests are ruled by false prophets , and my people like it so ! But your doom is certain . Footnotes - Jeremiah 5:15 an ancient nation . The kingdom of Babylonia , being revived in Jeremiah ’ s time ( around

TLB	Jeremiah	6	6	For the Lord Almighty has said to them , Cut down her trees for battering rams ; smash down the walls of Jerusalem . This is the city to be punished , for she is vile through and through .
TLB	Jeremiah	6	2	Helpless as a girl , you are beautiful and delicate—and doomed .
TLB	Jeremiah	6	3	Evil shepherds shall surround you . They shall set up camp around the city and divide your pastures for their flocks .
TLB	Jeremiah	6	4	See them prepare for battle . At noon it has begun . All afternoon it rages until the evening shadows fall .
TLB	Jeremiah	6	5	“ Come , ” they say . “ Let us attack by night and destroy her palaces ! ”
TLB	Jeremiah	6	7	She spouts evil like a fountain ! Her streets echo with the sounds of violence ; her sickness and wounds are ever before me .
TLB	Jeremiah	6	8	This is your last warning , O Jerusalem . If you don ’ t listen , I will empty the land .
TLB	Jeremiah	6	9	Disaster on disaster shall befall you . Even the few who remain in Israel shall be gleaned again , the Lord Almighty has said ; for as a grape-gatherer checks each vine to pick what he has missed , so the remnant of my people shall be destroyed again .
TLB	Jeremiah	6	10	But who will listen when I warn them ? Their ears are closed , and they refuse to hear . The word of God has angered them ; they don ’ t want it at all .
TLB	Jeremiah	6	11	For all this I am full of the wrath of God against them . I am weary of holding it in . I will pour it out over Jerusalem , even upon the children playing in the streets , upon the gatherings of young men , and on husbands and wives and grandparents .
TLB	Jeremiah	6	12	Their enemies shall live in their homes and take their fields and wives . For I will punish the people of this land , the Lord has said .
TLB	Jeremiah	6	13	They are swindlers and liars , from the least of them right to the top ! Yes , even my prophets and priests !
TLB	Jeremiah	6	14	You can ’ t heal a wound by saying it ’ s not there ! Yet the priests and prophets give assurances of peace when all is war .
TLB	Jeremiah	6	15	Were my people ashamed when they worshiped idols ? No , not at all—they didn ’ t even blush . Therefore they shall lie among the slain . They shall die beneath my anger .
TLB	Jeremiah	6	16	Yet the Lord pleads with you still : Ask where the good road is , the godly paths you used to walk in , in the days of long ago . Travel there , and you will find rest for your souls . But you reply , “ No , that is not the road we want ! ”
TLB	Jeremiah	6	17	I set watchmen over you who warned you : “ Listen for the sound of the trumpet ! It will let you know when trouble comes. ” But you said , “ No ! We won ’ t pay any attention ! ” 18-19 This , then , is my decree against my people : ( Listen to it , distant lands ; listen to it , O my people in Jerusalem ; listen to it , all the earth ! ) I will bring evil upon this people ; it will be the fruit of their own sin because they will not listen to me . They reject my law .
TLB	Jeremiah	6	20	There is no use now in burning sweet incense from Sheba before me ! Keep your expensive perfumes ! I can not accept your offerings ; they have no sweet fragrance for me .
TLB	Jeremiah	6	21	I will make an obstacle course of the pathway of my people ; fathers and sons shall be frustrated ; neighbors and friends shall collapse together .
TLB	Jeremiah	6	22	The Lord God says : See the armies marching from the north—a great nation is rising against you .
TLB	Jeremiah	6	23	They are a cruel , merciless people , fully armed , mounted for war . The noise of their army is like a roaring sea .
TLB	Jeremiah	6	24	We have heard the fame of their armies , and we are weak with fright . Fright and pain have gripped us like that of women in travail .
TLB	Jeremiah	6	25	Don ’ t go out to the fields ! Don ’ t travel the roads ! For the enemy is everywhere , ready to kill ; we are terrorized at every turn .
TLB	Jeremiah	6	26	O Jerusalem , pride of my people , put on mourning clothes and sit in ashes ; weep bitterly as for an only son . For suddenly the destroying armies will be upon you .
TLB	Jeremiah	6	27	Jeremiah , I have made you an assayer of metals that you may test this my people and determine their value . Listen to what they are saying and watch what they are doing .
TLB	Jeremiah	6	28	Are they not the worst of rebels , full of evil talk against the Lord ? They are insolent as brass , hard and cruel as iron .
TLB	Jeremiah	6	29	The bellows blow fiercely ; the refining fire grows hotter , but it can never cleanse them , for there is no pureness in them to bring out . Why continue the process longer ? All is dross . No matter how hot the fire , they continue in their wicked ways .

TLB	Jeremiah	7	7	then , and only then , will I let you stay in this land that I gave to your fathers to keep forever .
TLB	Jeremiah	7	2	Go over to the entrance of the Temple of the Lord and give this message to the people : O Judah , listen to this message from God . Listen to it , all of you who worship here .
TLB	Jeremiah	7	3	The Lord , the God of Israel says : Even yet , if you quit your evil ways , I will let you stay in your own land .
TLB	Jeremiah	7	4	But don ’ t be fooled by those who lie to you and say that since the Temple of the Lord is here , God will never let Jerusalem be destroyed .
TLB	Jeremiah	7	5	You may remain under these conditions only : If you stop your wicked thoughts and deeds and are fair to others ;
TLB	Jeremiah	7	6	if you stop exploiting orphans , widows , and foreigners , and stop your murdering ; if you stop worshiping idols as you do now to your hurt ,
TLB	Jeremiah	7	8	You think that because the Temple is here , you will never suffer ? Don ’ t fool yourselves !
TLB	Jeremiah	7	9	Do you really think that you can steal , murder , commit adultery , lie , and worship Baal and all of those new gods of yours ,
TLB	Jeremiah	7	10	and then come here and stand before me in my Temple and chant , “ We are saved ! ” —only to go right back to all these evil things again ?
TLB	Jeremiah	7	11	Is my Temple but a den of robbers in your eyes ? For I see all the evil going on in there .
TLB	Jeremiah	7	12	Go to Shiloh , the city I first honored with my name , and see what I did to her because of all the wickedness of my people Israel . 13-14 And now , says the Lord , I will do the same thing here because of all this evil you have done . Again and again I spoke to you about it , rising up early and calling , but you refused to hear or answer . Yes , I will destroy this Temple , as I did in Shiloh—this Temple called by my name , which you trust for help , and this place I gave to you and to your fathers .
TLB	Jeremiah	7	15	And I will send you into exile , just as I did your brothers , the people of Ephraim .
TLB	Jeremiah	7	16	Pray no more for these people , Jeremiah . Neither weep for them nor pray nor beg that I should help them , for I will not listen .
TLB	Jeremiah	7	17	Don ’ t you see what they are doing throughout the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem ?
TLB	Jeremiah	7	18	No wonder my anger is great ! Watch how the children gather wood and the fathers build fires , and the women knead dough and make cakes to offer to the Queen of Heaven [ a ] and to their other idol-gods !
TLB	Jeremiah	7	19	Am I the one that they are hurting ? asks the Lord . Most of all they hurt themselves , to their own shame .
TLB	Jeremiah	7	20	So the Lord God says : I will pour out my anger , yes , my fury on this place—people , animals , trees , and plants will be consumed by the unquenchable fire of my anger .
TLB	Jeremiah	7	21	The Lord , the God of Israel says : Away with your offerings and sacrifices !
TLB	Jeremiah	7	22	It wasn ’ t offerings and sacrifices I wanted from your fathers when I led them out of Egypt . That was not the point of my command .
TLB	Jeremiah	7	23	But what I told them was : Obey me , and I will be your God and you shall be my people ; only do as I say , and all shall be well !
TLB	Jeremiah	7	24	But they wouldn ’ t listen ; they kept on doing whatever they wanted to , following their own stubborn , evil thoughts . They went backward instead of forward .
TLB	Jeremiah	7	25	Ever since the day your fathers left Egypt until now , I have kept on sending them my prophets , day after day .
TLB	Jeremiah	7	26	But they wouldn ’ t listen to them or even try to hear . They are hard and stubborn and rebellious—worse even than their fathers were .
TLB	Jeremiah	7	27	Tell them everything that I will do to them , but don ’ t expect them to listen . Cry out your warnings , but don ’ t expect them to respond .
TLB	Jeremiah	7	28	Say to them : “ This is the nation that refuses to obey the Lord its God and refuses to be taught . She continues to live a lie. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	7	29	O Jerusalem , shave your head in shame and weep alone upon the mountains ; for the Lord has rejected and forsaken this people of his wrath .
TLB	Jeremiah	7	30	For the people of Judah have sinned before my very eyes , says the Lord . They have set up their idols right in my own Temple , polluting it .
TLB	Jeremiah	7	31	They have built the altar called Topheth in the valley of Ben-hinnom , and there they burn to death their little sons and daughters as sacrifices to their gods—a deed so horrible I ’ ve never even thought of it , let alone commanded it to be done .
TLB	Jeremiah	7	32	The time is coming , says the Lord , when that valley ’ s name will be changed from Topheth or Ben-hinnom Valley , to the Valley of Slaughter ; for there will be so many slain to bury that there won ’ t be room enough for all the graves , and they will dump the bodies in that valley .
TLB	Jeremiah	7	33	The bodies of my people shall be food for the birds and animals , and no one shall be left to scare them away .

TLB	Jeremiah	8	2	and dig out their bones and spread them out on the ground before the sun and moon and stars—the gods of my people ! —whom they have loved and worshiped . Their bones shall not be gathered up again nor buried but shall be scattered like dung upon the ground .
TLB	Jeremiah	8	3	And those of this evil nation who are still left alive shall long to die rather than live where I will scatter them , says the Lord Almighty . 4-5 Once again give them this message from the Lord : When a person falls , he jumps up again ; when he is on the wrong road and discovers his mistake , he goes back to the fork where he made the wrong turn . But these people keep on along their evil path , even though I warn them .
TLB	Jeremiah	8	6	I listen to their conversation and what do I hear ? Is anyone sorry for sin ? Does anyone say , “ What a terrible thing I have done ” ? No , all are rushing pell-mell down the path of sin as swiftly as a horse rushing to the battle !

TLB	Jeremiah	8	13	Their figs and grapes will disappear , their fruit trees will die , and all the good things I prepared for them will soon be gone .
TLB	Jeremiah	8	14	Then the people will say , “ Why should we wait here to die ? Come , let us go to the walled cities and perish there . For the Lord our God has decreed our doom and given us a cup of poison to drink because of all our sins .
TLB	Jeremiah	8	15	We expected peace , but no peace came ; we looked for health , but there was only terror. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	8	16	The noise of war resounds from the northern border . [ a ] The whole land trembles at the approach of the terrible army , for the enemy is coming and is devouring the land and everything in it—the cities and people alike .
TLB	Jeremiah	8	17	For I will send these enemy troops among you like poisonous snakes that you can not charm . No matter what you do , they will bite you and you shall die .
TLB	Jeremiah	8	18	My grief is beyond healing ; my heart is broken .
TLB	Jeremiah	8	19	Listen to the weeping of my people all across the land . “ Where is the Lord ? ” they ask . “ Has God deserted us ? ” “ Oh , why have they angered me with their carved idols and strange evil rites ? ” the Lord replies .
TLB	Jeremiah	8	20	“ The harvest is finished ; the summer is over , and we are not saved. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	8	21	I weep for the hurt of my people ; I stand amazed , silent , dumb with grief .
TLB	Jeremiah	8	22	Is there no medicine in Gilead ? Is there no physician there ? Why doesn ’ t God do something ? Why doesn ’ t he help ?

TLB	Jeremiah	9	9	Should not I punish them for such things as this ? ” asks the Lord . “ Shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this ? ”
TLB	Jeremiah	9	2	Oh , that I could go away and forget them and live in some wayside shack in the desert , for they are all adulterous , treacherous men .
TLB	Jeremiah	9	3	“ They bend their tongues like bows to shoot their arrows of untruth . They care nothing for right and go from bad to worse ; they care nothing for me , ” says the Lord .
TLB	Jeremiah	9	4	Beware of your neighbor ! Beware of your brother ! All take advantage of one another and spread their slanderous lies .
TLB	Jeremiah	9	5	With practiced tongues they fool and defraud each other ; they wear themselves out with all their sinning .
TLB	Jeremiah	9	6	“ They pile evil upon evil , lie upon lie , and utterly refuse to come to me , ” says the Lord .
TLB	Jeremiah	9	7	Therefore , the Lord Almighty says this : “ See , I will melt them in a crucible of affliction . I will refine them and test them like metal . What else can I do with them ?
TLB	Jeremiah	9	8	For their tongues aim lies like poisoned spears . They speak cleverly to their neighbors while planning to kill them .
TLB	Jeremiah	9	10	Sobbing and weeping , I point to their mountains and pastures , for now they are desolate , without a living soul . Gone is the lowing of cattle , gone the birds and wild animals . All have fled .
TLB	Jeremiah	9	11	“ And I will turn Jerusalem into heaps of ruined houses where only jackals have their dens . The cities of Judah shall be ghost towns , with no one living in them. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	9	12	Who is wise enough to understand all this ? Where is the Lord ’ s messenger to explain it ? Why is the land a wilderness so that no one dares even to travel through ?
TLB	Jeremiah	9	13	“ Because , ” the Lord replies , “ my people have forsaken my commandments and not obeyed my laws .
TLB	Jeremiah	9	14	Instead , they have done whatever they pleased and worshiped the idols of Baal , as their fathers told them to. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	9	15	Therefore , this is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says : Look ! I will feed them with bitterness and give them poison to drink .
TLB	Jeremiah	9	16	I will scatter them around the world , to be strangers in distant lands ; and even there the sword of destruction shall chase them until I have utterly destroyed them . 17-18 The Lord Almighty says : “ Send for the mourners ! Quick ! Begin your crying ! Let the tears flow from your eyes .
TLB	Jeremiah	9	19	Hear Jerusalem weeping in despair . ‘ We are ruined ! Disaster has befallen us ! We must leave our land and homes ! ’ ”
TLB	Jeremiah	9	20	Listen to the words of God , O women who wail . Teach your daughters to wail and your neighbors too .
TLB	Jeremiah	9	21	For death has crept in through your windows into your homes . He has killed off the flower of your youth . Children no longer play in the streets ; the young men gather no more in the squares .
TLB	Jeremiah	9	22	Tell them this , says the Lord : Bodies shall be scattered across the fields like manure , like sheaves after the mower , and no one will bury them .
TLB	Jeremiah	9	23	The Lord says : Let not the wise man bask in his wisdom , nor the mighty man in his might , nor the rich man in his riches .
TLB	Jeremiah	9	24	Let them boast in this alone : That they truly know me , and understand that I am the Lord of justice and of righteousness whose love is steadfast ; and that I love to be this way . 25-26 A time is coming , says the Lord , when I will punish all those who are circumcised in body but not in spirit—the Egyptians , Edomites , Ammonites , Moabites , Arabs , and yes , even you people of Judah . For all these pagan nations also circumcise themselves . Unless you circumcise your hearts by loving me , your circumcision is only a heathen rite like theirs , and nothing more .

TLB	Jeremiah	10	10	But the Lord is the only true God , the living God , the everlasting King . The whole earth shall tremble at his anger ; the world shall hide before his displeasure .
TLB	Jeremiah	10	4	they decorate it with gold and silver and fasten it securely in place with hammer and nails so that it won ’ t fall over .
TLB	Jeremiah	10	5	And there stands their god like a helpless scarecrow in a garden ! It can not speak , and it must be carried , for it can not walk . Don ’ t be afraid of such a god , for it can neither harm nor help nor do you any good .
TLB	Jeremiah	10	6	O Lord , there is no other god like you . For you are great , and your name is full of power .
TLB	Jeremiah	10	7	Who would not fear you , O King of nations ? ( And that title belongs to you alone ! ) Among all the wise men of the earth and in all the kingdoms of the world there isn ’ t anyone like you .
TLB	Jeremiah	10	8	The wisest of men who worship idols are altogether stupid and foolish .
TLB	Jeremiah	10	9	They bring beaten sheets of silver from Tarshish and gold from Uphaz and give them to skillful goldsmiths who make their idols ; then they clothe these gods in royal purple robes that expert tailors make .
TLB	Jeremiah	10	11	Say this to those who worship other gods : Your so-called gods , who have not made the heavens and earth , shall vanish from the earth .
TLB	Jeremiah	10	12	But our God formed the earth by his power and wisdom , and by his intelligence he hung the stars in space and stretched out the heavens .
TLB	Jeremiah	10	13	It is his voice that echoes in the thunder of the storm clouds . He causes mist to rise upon the earth ; he sends the lightning and brings the rain , and from his treasuries he brings the wind .
TLB	Jeremiah	10	14	But foolish men without knowledge of God bow before their idols . It is a shameful business that these men are in , for what they make are frauds , gods without life or power in them .
TLB	Jeremiah	10	15	All are worthless , silly ; they will be crushed when their makers perish .
TLB	Jeremiah	10	16	But the God of Jacob is not like these foolish idols . He is the Creator of all , and Israel is his chosen nation . The Lord Almighty is his name .
TLB	Jeremiah	10	17	Pack your bags , he says . Get ready now to leave ; the siege will soon begin .
TLB	Jeremiah	10	18	For suddenly I ’ ll fling you from this land and pour great troubles down ; at last you shall feel my wrath .
TLB	Jeremiah	10	19	Desperate is my wound . My grief is great . My sickness is incurable , but I must bear it .
TLB	Jeremiah	10	20	My home is gone ; my children have been taken away , and I will never see them again . There is no one left to help me rebuild my home .
TLB	Jeremiah	10	21	The shepherds of my people have lost their senses ; they no longer follow God nor ask his will . Therefore they perish , and their flocks are scattered .
TLB	Jeremiah	10	22	Listen ! Hear the terrible sound of great armies coming from the north . The cities of Judah shall become dens of jackals .
TLB	Jeremiah	10	23	O Lord , I know it is not within the power of man to map his life and plan his course—
TLB	Jeremiah	10	24	so you correct me , Lord ; but please be gentle . Don ’ t do it in your anger , for I would die .
TLB	Jeremiah	10	25	Pour out your fury on the nations who don ’ t obey the Lord , for they have destroyed Israel and made a wasteland of this entire country . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Jeremiah	11	11	Therefore , the Lord says , I am going to bring calamity down upon them , and they shall not escape . Though they cry for mercy , I will not listen to their pleas .
TLB	Jeremiah	11	4	For I told them at the time I brought them out of slavery in Egypt that if they would obey me and do whatever I commanded them , then they and all their children would be mine and I would be their God .
TLB	Jeremiah	11	5	And now , Israel , obey me , says the Lord , so that I can do for you the wonderful things I swore I would if you obeyed . I want to give you a land that “ flows with milk and honey , ” as it is today . Then I replied , “ So be it , Lord ! ”
TLB	Jeremiah	11	6	Then the Lord said : Broadcast this message in Jerusalem ’ s streets—go from city to city throughout the land and say , Remember this agreement that your fathers made with God , and do all the things they promised him they would .
TLB	Jeremiah	11	7	For I solemnly said to your fathers when I brought them out of Egypt—and have kept on saying it over and over again until this day : Obey my every command !
TLB	Jeremiah	11	8	But your fathers didn ’ t do it . They wouldn ’ t even listen . Each followed his own stubborn will and his proud heart . Because they refused to obey , I did to them all the evils stated in the contract .
TLB	Jeremiah	11	9	Again the Lord spoke to me and said : I have discovered a conspiracy against me among the men of Judah and Jerusalem .
TLB	Jeremiah	11	10	They have returned to the sins of their fathers , refusing to listen to me and worshiping idols . The agreement I made with their fathers is broken and canceled .
TLB	Jeremiah	11	12	Then they will pray to their idols and burn incense before them , but that can not save them from their time of anguish and despair .
TLB	Jeremiah	11	13	O my people , you have as many gods as there are cities , and your altars of shame ( your altars to burn incense to Baal ) are along every street in Jerusalem .
TLB	Jeremiah	11	14	Therefore , Jeremiah , pray no longer for this people , neither weep nor plead for them ; for I will not listen to them when they are finally desperate enough to beg me for help .
TLB	Jeremiah	11	15	What right do my beloved people have to come anymore to my Temple ? For you have been unfaithful and worshiped other gods . Can promises and sacrifices now avert your doom and give you life and joy again ?
TLB	Jeremiah	11	16	The Lord used to call you his green olive tree , beautiful to see and full of good fruit ; but now he has sent the fury of your enemies to burn you up and leave you broken and charred .
TLB	Jeremiah	11	17	It is because of the wickedness of Israel and Judah in offering incense to Baal that the Lord Almighty who planted the tree has ordered it destroyed .
TLB	Jeremiah	11	18	Then the Lord told me all about their plans and showed me their evil plots .
TLB	Jeremiah	11	19	I had been as unsuspecting as a lamb or ox on the way to slaughter . I didn ’ t know that they were planning to kill me ! “ Let ’ s destroy this man and all his messages , ” they said . “ Let ’ s kill him so that his name will be forever forgotten. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	11	20	O Lord Almighty , you are just . See the hearts and motives of these men . Repay them for all that they have planned ! I look to you for justice . 21-22 And the Lord replied , The men of the city of Anathoth shall be punished for planning to kill you . They will tell you not to prophesy in God ’ s name on pain of death . And so their young men shall die in battle ; their boys and girls shall starve .
TLB	Jeremiah	11	23	Not one of these plotters of Anathoth shall survive , for I will bring a great disaster upon them . Their time has come . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Jeremiah	12	12	Destroying armies plunder the land ; the sword of the Lord devours from one end of the nation to the other ; nothing shall escape .
TLB	Jeremiah	12	2	You plant them . They take root and their business grows . Their profits multiply , and they are rich . They say , “ Thank God ! ” But in their hearts they give no credit to you .
TLB	Jeremiah	12	3	But as for me—Lord , you know my heart—you know how much it longs for you . ( And I am poor , [ a ] O Lord ! ) Lord , drag them off like helpless sheep to the slaughter . Judge them , O God !
TLB	Jeremiah	12	4	How long must this land of yours put up with all their goings-on ? Even the grass of the field groans and weeps over their wicked deeds ! The wild animals and birds have moved away , leaving the land deserted . Yet the people say , “ God won ’ t bring judgment on us . We ’ re perfectly safe ! ”
TLB	Jeremiah	12	5	The Lord replied to me : If racing with mere men—these men of Anathoth—has wearied you , how will you race against horses , against the king , his court , and all his evil priests ? [ b ] If you stumble and fall on open ground , what will you do in Jordan ’ s jungles ?
TLB	Jeremiah	12	6	Even your own brothers , your own family , have turned against you . They have plotted to call for a mob to lynch you . Don ’ t trust them , no matter how pleasantly they speak . Don ’ t believe them .
TLB	Jeremiah	12	7	Then the Lord said : I have abandoned my people , my inheritance ; I have surrendered my dearest ones to their enemies .
TLB	Jeremiah	12	8	My people have roared at me like a lion of the forest , so I have treated them as though I hated them .
TLB	Jeremiah	12	9	My people have fallen . I will bring upon them swarms of vultures and wild animals to pick the flesh from their corpses .
TLB	Jeremiah	12	10	Many foreign rulers have ravaged my vineyard , trampling down the vines , and turning all its beauty into barren wilderness .
TLB	Jeremiah	12	11	They have made it desolate ; I hear its mournful cry . The whole land is desolate and no one cares .
TLB	Jeremiah	12	13	My people have sown wheat but reaped thorns ; they have worked hard , but it does them no good . They shall harvest a crop of shame , for the fierce anger of the Lord is upon them .
TLB	Jeremiah	12	14	And now the Lord says this to the evil nations , the nations surrounding the land God gave his people Israel : See , I will force you from your land just as Judah will be forced from hers ;
TLB	Jeremiah	12	15	but afterwards I will return and have compassion on all of you and will bring you home to your own land again , each man to his inheritance .
TLB	Jeremiah	12	16	And if these heathen nations quickly learn my people ’ s ways and claim me as their God instead of Baal ( whom they taught my people to worship ) , then they shall be strong among my people .
TLB	Jeremiah	12	17	But any nation refusing to obey me will be expelled again and finished , says the Lord . Footnotes - Jeremiah 12:3 I am poor , implied . - Jeremiah 12:5 these men of Anathoth . . . against the king , his court , and all his evil priests , implied . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Jeremiah	13	13	Then tell them : That ’ s not what I mean . [ b ] I mean that I will fill everyone living in this land with helpless bewilderment—from the king sitting on David ’ s throne , and the priests and the prophets , right on down to all the people .
TLB	Jeremiah	13	2	So I bought the loincloth and put it on .
TLB	Jeremiah	13	3	Then the Lord ’ s message came to me again . This time he said ,
TLB	Jeremiah	13	4	Take the loincloth out to the Euphrates River and hide it in a hole in the rocks .
TLB	Jeremiah	13	5	So I did ; I hid it as the Lord had told me to .
TLB	Jeremiah	13	6	Then , a long time afterwards , the Lord said : Go out to the river again and get the loincloth .
TLB	Jeremiah	13	7	And I did ; I dug it out of the hole where I had hidden it . But now it was mildewed and falling apart . It was utterly useless ! 8-9 Then the Lord said : This illustrates the way that I will rot the pride of Judah and Jerusalem .
TLB	Jeremiah	13	10	This evil nation refuses to listen to me and follows its own evil desires , and worships idols ; therefore , it shall become as this loincloth—good for nothing .
TLB	Jeremiah	13	11	Even as a loincloth clings to a man ’ s loins , so I made Judah and Israel to cling to me , says the Lord . They were my people , an honor to my name . But then they turned away .
TLB	Jeremiah	13	12	Tell them this : The Lord God of Israel says , All your wine jugs will be full of wine . And they will reply , Of course , you don ’ t need to tell us how prosperous we will be ! [ a ]
TLB	Jeremiah	13	14	And I will smash fathers and sons against each other , says the Lord . I will not let pity nor mercy spare them from utter destruction .
TLB	Jeremiah	13	15	Oh , that you were not so proud and stubborn ! Then you would listen to the Lord , for he has spoken .
TLB	Jeremiah	13	16	Give glory to the Lord your God before it is too late , before he causes deep , impenetrable darkness to fall upon you so that you stumble and fall upon the dark mountains ; then , when you look for light , you will find only terrible darkness .
TLB	Jeremiah	13	17	Do you still refuse to listen ? Then in loneliness my breaking heart shall mourn because of your pride . My eyes will overflow with tears because the Lord ’ s flock shall be carried away as slaves .
TLB	Jeremiah	13	18	Say to the king and queen mother , [ c ] Come down from your thrones and sit in the dust , for your glorious crowns are removed from your heads . They are no longer yours .
TLB	Jeremiah	13	19	The cities of the Negeb to the south of Jerusalem have closed their gates against the enemy . They must defend themselves , for Jerusalem can not help ; [ d ] and all Judah shall be taken away as slaves .
TLB	Jeremiah	13	20	See the armies marching from the north ! Where is your flock , Jerusalem , [ e ] your beautiful flock he gave you to take care of ?
TLB	Jeremiah	13	21	How will you feel when he sets your allies over you as your rulers ? You will writhe in pain like a woman having a child .
TLB	Jeremiah	13	22	And if you ask yourself , Why is all this happening to me ? It is because of the grossness of your sins ; that is why you have been raped and destroyed by the invading army .
TLB	Jeremiah	13	23	Can the Ethiopian change the color of his skin ? or a leopard take away his spots ? Nor can you who are so used to doing evil now start being good . 24-25 Because you have put me out of your mind and put your trust in false gods , I will scatter you as chaff is scattered by the fierce winds off the desert . This then is your allotment , that which is due you , which I have measured out especially for you .
TLB	Jeremiah	13	26	I myself will expose you to utter shame .
TLB	Jeremiah	13	27	I am keenly aware of your apostasy , your faithlessness to me , and your abominable idol worship in the fields and on the hills . Woe upon you , O Jerusalem ! How long before you will be pure ? Footnotes - Jeremiah 13:12 how prosperous we will be , literally , “ that every bottle will be filled with wine. ” - Jeremiah 13:13 That ’ s not what I mean , implied . - Jeremiah 13:18 Say to the king and queen mother , i.e. , to King Jehoiachin and his mother , Nehashta . - Jeremiah 13:19 for Jerusalem can not help , literally , “ for the cities are closed and none can open them. ” Perhaps the meaning is that they are permanently abandoned . - Jeremiah 13:20 Jerusalem , implied .

TLB	Jeremiah	14	14	Then the Lord said : The prophets are telling lies in my name . I didn ’ t send them or tell them to speak or give them any message . They prophesy of visions and revelations they have never seen nor heard ; they speak foolishness concocted out of their own lying hearts .
TLB	Jeremiah	14	2	Judah mourns ; business has ground to a halt ; all the people prostrate themselves to the earth , and a great cry rises from Jerusalem .
TLB	Jeremiah	14	3	The nobles send servants for water from the wells , but the wells are dry . The servants return , baffled and desperate , and cover their heads in grief .
TLB	Jeremiah	14	4	The ground is parched and cracked for lack of rain ; the farmers are afraid .
TLB	Jeremiah	14	5	The deer deserts her fawn because there is no grass .
TLB	Jeremiah	14	6	The wild donkeys stand upon the bare hills panting like thirsty jackals . They strain their eyes looking for grass to eat , but there is none to be found .
TLB	Jeremiah	14	7	O Lord , we have sinned against you grievously , yet help us for the sake of your own reputation !
TLB	Jeremiah	14	8	O Hope of Israel , our Savior in times of trouble , why are you as a stranger to us , as one passing through the land who is merely stopping for the night ?
TLB	Jeremiah	14	9	Are you also baffled ? Are you helpless to save us ? O Lord , you are right here among us , and we carry your name ; we are known as your people . O Lord , don ’ t desert us now !
TLB	Jeremiah	14	10	But the Lord replies : You have loved to wander far from me and have not tried to follow in my paths . Now I will no longer accept you as my people ; now I will remember all the evil you have done and punish your sins .
TLB	Jeremiah	14	11	The Lord told me again : Don ’ t ask me anymore to bless this people . Don ’ t pray for them anymore .
TLB	Jeremiah	14	12	When they fast , I will not pay any attention ; when they present their offerings and sacrifices to me , I will not accept them . What I will give them in return is war and famine and disease .
TLB	Jeremiah	14	13	Then I said , O Lord God , their prophets are telling them that all is well—that no war or famine will come . They tell the people you will surely send them peace , that you will bless them .
TLB	Jeremiah	14	15	Therefore , the Lord says , I will punish these lying prophets who have spoken in my name though I did not send them , who say no war shall come nor famine . By war and famine they themselves shall die !
TLB	Jeremiah	14	16	And the people to whom they prophesy—their bodies shall be thrown out into the streets of Jerusalem , victims of famine and war ; there shall be no one to bury them . Husbands , wives , sons , and daughters—all will be gone . For I will pour out terrible punishment upon them for their sins .
TLB	Jeremiah	14	17	Therefore , tell them this : Night and day my eyes shall overflow with tears ; I can not stop my crying , for my people have been run through with a sword and lie mortally wounded on the ground .
TLB	Jeremiah	14	18	If I go out in the fields , there lie the bodies of those the sword has killed ; and if I walk in the streets , there lie those dead from starvation and disease . And yet the prophets and priests alike have made it their business to travel through the whole country , reassuring everyone that all is well , speaking of things they know nothing about .
TLB	Jeremiah	14	19	“ O Lord , ” the people will cry , “ have you completely rejected Judah ? Do you abhor Jerusalem ? Even after punishment , will there be no peace ? We thought , Now at last he will heal us and bind our wounds . But no peace has come , and there is only trouble and terror everywhere .
TLB	Jeremiah	14	20	O Lord , we confess our wickedness , and that of our fathers too .
TLB	Jeremiah	14	21	Do not hate us , Lord , for the sake of your own name . Do not disgrace yourself and the throne of your glory by forsaking your promise to bless us !
TLB	Jeremiah	14	22	What heathen god can give us rain ? Who but you alone , O Lord our God , can do such things as this ? Therefore we will wait for you to help us. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Jeremiah	15	15	Then Jeremiah replied , “ Lord , you know it is for your sake that I am suffering . They are persecuting me because I have proclaimed your word to them . Don ’ t let them kill me ! Rescue me from their clutches , and give them what they deserve !
TLB	Jeremiah	15	2	And if they say to you , But where can we go ? Tell them the Lord says : Those who are destined for death , to death ; those who must die by the sword , to the sword ; those doomed to starvation , to famine ; and those for captivity , to captivity .
TLB	Jeremiah	15	3	I will appoint over them four kinds of destroyers , says the Lord : the sword to kill , the dogs to tear , and the vultures and wild animals to finish up what ’ s left .
TLB	Jeremiah	15	4	Because of the wicked things Manasseh , son of Hezekiah , king of Judah , did in Jerusalem , I will punish you so severely that your fate will horrify the peoples of the world .
TLB	Jeremiah	15	5	Who will feel sorry for you , Jerusalem ? Who will weep for you ? Who will even bother to ask how you are ?
TLB	Jeremiah	15	6	You have forsaken me and turned your backs upon me . Therefore , I will clench my fists against you to destroy you . I am tired of always giving you another chance .
TLB	Jeremiah	15	7	I will sift you at the gates of your cities and take from you all that you hold dear , and I will destroy my own people because they refuse to turn back to me from all their evil ways .
TLB	Jeremiah	15	8	There shall be countless widows ; at noontime I will bring death to the young men and sorrow to their mothers . I will cause anguish and terror to fall upon them suddenly .
TLB	Jeremiah	15	9	The mother of seven sickens and faints , for all her sons are dead . Her sun is gone down while it is yet day . She sits childless now , disgraced , for all her children have been killed .
TLB	Jeremiah	15	10	Then Jeremiah said , “ What sadness is mine , my mother ; oh , that I had died at birth . For I am hated everywhere I go . I am neither a creditor soon to foreclose nor a debtor refusing to pay—yet they all curse me .
TLB	Jeremiah	15	11	Well , let them curse ! Lord , you know how I have pled with you on their behalf—how I have begged you to spare these enemies of mine. ” 12-13 Can a man break bars of northern iron or bronze ? This people ’ s stubborn will can ’ t be broken either . So , because of all your sins against me , I will deliver your wealth and treasures as loot to the enemy .
TLB	Jeremiah	15	14	I will have your enemies take you as slaves to a land where you have never been before , for my anger burns like fire , and it shall consume you .
TLB	Jeremiah	15	16	Your words are what sustain me ; they are food to my hungry soul . They bring joy to my sorrowing heart and delight me . How proud I am to bear your name , O Lord . 17-18 I have not joined the people in their merry feasts . I sit alone beneath the hand of God . I burst with indignation at their sins . Yet you have failed me in my time of need ! You have let them keep right on with all their persecutions . Will they never stop hurting me ? Your help is as uncertain as a seasonal mountain brook—sometimes a flood , sometimes as dry as a bone. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	15	19	The Lord replied : “ Stop this foolishness and talk some sense ! Only if you return to trusting me will I let you continue as my spokesman . You are to influence them , not let them influence you !
TLB	Jeremiah	15	20	They will fight against you like a besieging army against a high city wall . But they will not conquer you , for I am with you to protect and deliver you , says the Lord .
TLB	Jeremiah	15	21	Yes , I will certainly deliver you from these wicked men and rescue you from their ruthless hands. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Jeremiah	16	3	For the children born in this city and their mothers and fathers
TLB	Jeremiah	16	4	shall die from terrible diseases . No one shall mourn for them or bury them , but their bodies shall lie on the ground to rot and fertilize the soil . They shall die from war and famine , and their bodies shall be picked apart by vultures and wild animals .
TLB	Jeremiah	16	5	Do not mourn or weep for them , for I have removed my protection and my peace from them—taken away my loving-kindness and my mercies .
TLB	Jeremiah	16	6	Both great and small shall die in this land , unburied and unmourned , and their friends shall not cut themselves nor shave their heads as signs of sorrow ( as is their heathen custom ) .
TLB	Jeremiah	16	7	No one shall comfort the mourners with a meal nor send them a cup of wine expressing grief for their parents ’ death .
TLB	Jeremiah	16	8	As a sign to them of these sad days ahead , [ a ] don ’ t you join them anymore in their feasts and parties—don ’ t even eat a meal with them .
TLB	Jeremiah	16	9	For the Lord Almighty , the God of Israel , says : In your own lifetime , before your very eyes , I will end all laughter in this land—the happy songs , the marriage feasts , the songs of bridegrooms and of brides .
TLB	Jeremiah	16	10	And when you tell the people all these things and they ask , “ Why has the Lord decreed such terrible things against us ? What have we done to merit such treatment ? What is our sin against the Lord our God ? ”
TLB	Jeremiah	16	11	tell them the Lord ’ s reply is this : Because your fathers forsook me . They worshiped other gods and served them ; they did not keep my laws ,
TLB	Jeremiah	16	12	and you have been worse than your fathers were ! You follow evil to your hearts ’ content and refuse to listen to me .
TLB	Jeremiah	16	13	Therefore , I will throw you out of this land and chase you into a foreign land where neither you nor your fathers have been before , and there you can go ahead and worship your idols all you like—and I will grant you no favors ! 14-15 But there will come a glorious day , says the Lord , when the whole topic of conversation will be that God is bringing his people home from a nation in the north , and from many other lands where he had scattered them . You will look back no longer to the time when I rescued you from your slavery in Egypt . That mighty miracle will scarcely be mentioned anymore . Yes , I will bring you back again , says the Lord , to this same land I gave your fathers .
TLB	Jeremiah	16	17	For I am closely watching you , and I see every sin . You can not hope to hide from me .
TLB	Jeremiah	16	18	And I will punish you doubly for all your sins because you have defiled my land with your detestable idols and filled it up with all your evil deeds .
TLB	Jeremiah	16	19	O Lord , my Strength and Fortress , my Refuge in the day of trouble , nations from around the world will come to you saying , “ Our fathers have been foolish , for they have worshiped worthless idols !
TLB	Jeremiah	16	20	Can men make God ? The gods they made are not real gods at all. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	16	21	And when they come in that spirit , I will show them [ b ] my power and might and make them understand at last that I alone am God .

TLB	Jeremiah	17	17	Lord , don ’ t desert me now ! You alone are my hope .
TLB	Jeremiah	17	4	And the wonderful heritage I reserved for you will slip out of your hand , and I will send you away as slaves to your enemies in distant lands . For you have kindled a fire of my anger that shall burn forever .
TLB	Jeremiah	17	5	The Lord says : Cursed is the man who puts his trust in mortal man and turns his heart away from God .
TLB	Jeremiah	17	6	He is like a stunted shrub in the desert , with no hope for the future ; he lives on the salt-encrusted plains in the barren wilderness ; good times pass him by forever .
TLB	Jeremiah	17	7	But blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord and has made the Lord his hope and confidence .
TLB	Jeremiah	17	8	He is like a tree planted along a riverbank , with its roots reaching deep into the water—a tree not bothered by the heat nor worried by long months of drought . Its leaves stay green , and it goes right on producing all its luscious fruit .
TLB	Jeremiah	17	9	The heart is the most deceitful thing there is and desperately wicked . No one can really know how bad it is !
TLB	Jeremiah	17	10	Only the Lord knows ! He searches all hearts and examines deepest motives so he can give to each person his right reward , according to his deeds—how he has lived .
TLB	Jeremiah	17	11	Like a bird that fills her nest with young she has not hatched and which will soon desert her and fly away , so is the man who gets his wealth by unjust means . Sooner or later he will lose his riches and at the end of his life become a poor old fool .
TLB	Jeremiah	17	12	But our refuge is your throne , eternal , high , and glorious .
TLB	Jeremiah	17	13	O Lord , the Hope of Israel , all who turn away from you shall be disgraced and shamed ; they are registered for earth and not for glory , for they have forsaken the Lord , the Fountain of living waters .
TLB	Jeremiah	17	14	Lord , you alone can heal me , you alone can save , and my praises are for you alone .
TLB	Jeremiah	17	15	Men scoff at me and say , “ What is this word of the Lord you keep talking about ? If these threats of yours are really from God , why don ’ t they come true ? ”
TLB	Jeremiah	17	16	Lord , I don ’ t want the people crushed by terrible calamity . The plan is yours , not mine . It is your message I ’ ve given them , not my own . I don ’ t want them doomed !
TLB	Jeremiah	17	18	Bring confusion and trouble on all who persecute me , but give me peace . Yes , bring double destruction upon them !
TLB	Jeremiah	17	19	Then the Lord said to me , Go and stand in the gates of Jerusalem , first at the gate where the king goes out , and then at each of the other gates ,
TLB	Jeremiah	17	20	and say to all the people : Hear the word of the Lord , kings of Judah and all the people of this nation , and all you citizens of Jerusalem . 21-22 The Lord says : Take warning and live ; do no unnecessary [ a ] work on the Sabbath day , but make it a holy day . I gave this commandment to your fathers ,
TLB	Jeremiah	17	23	but they didn ’ t listen or obey . They stubbornly refused to pay attention and be taught .
TLB	Jeremiah	17	24	But if you obey me , says the Lord , and refuse to work on the Sabbath day and keep it separate , special and holy ,
TLB	Jeremiah	17	25	then this nation shall continue forever . There shall always be descendants of David sitting on the throne here in Jerusalem ; there shall always be kings and princes riding in pomp and splendor among the people , and this city shall remain forever .
TLB	Jeremiah	17	26	And from all around Jerusalem and from the cities of Judah and Benjamin , from the Negeb and from the lowlands west of Judah , the people shall come with their burnt offerings and grain offerings and incense , bringing their sacrifices to praise the Lord in his Temple .
TLB	Jeremiah	17	27	But if you will not listen to me , if you refuse to keep the Sabbath holy , if on the Sabbath you bring in loads of merchandise through these gates of Jerusalem , just as on other days , then I will set fire to these gates . The fire shall spread to the palaces and utterly destroy them , and no one shall be able to put out the raging flames . Footnotes - Jeremiah 17:21 unnecessary , implied . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Jeremiah	18	18	Then the people said , “ Come , let ’ s get rid of Jeremiah . We have our own priests and wise men and prophets—we don ’ t need his advice . Let ’ s silence him that he may speak no more against us , nor bother us again. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	18	2	Go down to the shop where clay pots and jars are made , and I will talk to you there .
TLB	Jeremiah	18	3	I did as he told me and found the potter working at his wheel .
TLB	Jeremiah	18	4	But the jar that he was forming didn ’ t turn out as he wished , so he kneaded it into a lump and started again .
TLB	Jeremiah	18	5	Then the Lord said :
TLB	Jeremiah	18	6	O Israel , can ’ t I do to you as this potter has done to his clay ? As the clay is in the potter ’ s hand , so are you in my hand .
TLB	Jeremiah	18	7	Whenever I announce that a certain nation or kingdom is to be taken up and destroyed ,
TLB	Jeremiah	18	8	then if that nation renounces its evil ways , I will not destroy it as I had planned .
TLB	Jeremiah	18	9	And if I announce that I will make a certain nation strong and great ,
TLB	Jeremiah	18	10	but then that nation changes its mind , turns to evil , and refuses to obey me , then I , too , will change my mind and not bless that nation as I had said I would .
TLB	Jeremiah	18	11	Therefore , go and warn all Judah and Jerusalem , saying : Hear the word of the Lord . I am planning evil against you now instead of good ; turn back from your evil paths and do what is right .
TLB	Jeremiah	18	12	But they replied , “ Don ’ t waste your breath . We have no intention whatever of doing what God says . We will continue to live as we want to , free from any restraint , full of stubbornness and wickedness ! ”
TLB	Jeremiah	18	13	Then the Lord said : Even among the heathen , no one has ever heard of such a thing ! My people have done something too horrible to understand .
TLB	Jeremiah	18	14	The snow never melts high up in the Lebanon mountains . The cold , flowing streams from the crags of Mount Hermon never run dry .
TLB	Jeremiah	18	15	These can be counted on . But not my people ! For they have deserted me and turned to foolish idols . They have turned away from the ancient highways of good and walk the muddy paths of sin .
TLB	Jeremiah	18	16	Therefore , their land shall become desolate , so that all who pass by will gasp and shake their heads in amazement at its utter desolation .
TLB	Jeremiah	18	17	I will scatter my people before their enemies as the east wind scatters dust ; and in all their trouble I will turn my back on them and refuse to notice their distress .
TLB	Jeremiah	18	19	O Lord , help me ! See what they are planning to do to me !
TLB	Jeremiah	18	20	Should they repay evil for good ? They have set a trap to kill me , yet I spoke well of them to you and tried to defend them from your anger .
TLB	Jeremiah	18	21	Now , Lord , let their children starve to death and let the sword pour out their blood ! Let their wives be widows and be bereft of all their children ! Let their men die in epidemics and their youths die in battle !
TLB	Jeremiah	18	22	Let screaming be heard from their homes as troops of soldiers come suddenly upon them , for they have dug a pit for me to fall in , and they have hidden traps along my path .
TLB	Jeremiah	18	23	Lord , you know all their murderous plots against me . Don ’ t forgive them , don ’ t blot out their sin , but let them perish before you ; deal with them in your anger . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Jeremiah	19	19	1-2 The Lord said , Buy a clay jar and take it out into the valley of Ben-hinnom by the east gate of the city . Take some of the elders of the people and some of the older priests with you , and speak to them whatever words I give you .
TLB	Jeremiah	19	3	Then the Lord spoke to them and said : Listen to the word of the Lord , kings of Judah and citizens of Jerusalem ! The Lord Almighty , the God of Israel , says : I will bring terrible evil upon this place , so terrible that the ears of those who hear it will prickle .
TLB	Jeremiah	19	4	For Israel has forsaken me and turned this valley into a place of shame and wickedness . The people burn incense to idols—idols that neither this generation nor their forefathers nor the kings of Judah have worshiped before—and they have filled this place with the blood of innocent children .
TLB	Jeremiah	19	5	They have built high altars to Baal , and there they burn their sons in sacrifice—a thing I never commanded them nor even thought of !
TLB	Jeremiah	19	6	The day is coming , says the Lord , when this valley shall no longer be called Topheth or Ben-hinnom Valley , but the Valley of Slaughter .
TLB	Jeremiah	19	7	For I will upset the battle plans of Judah and Jerusalem , and I will let invading armies kill you here and leave your dead bodies for vultures and wild animals to feed upon .
TLB	Jeremiah	19	8	And I will wipe Jerusalem off the earth , so that everyone going by will gasp with astonishment at all that I have done to her .
TLB	Jeremiah	19	9	I will see to it that your enemies lay siege to the city until all food is gone and those trapped inside begin to eat their own children and friends .
TLB	Jeremiah	19	10	And now , Jeremiah , as these men watch , smash the jar you brought with you ,
TLB	Jeremiah	19	11	and say to them , This is the message to you from the Lord Almighty : As this jar lies shattered , so I will shatter the people of Jerusalem ; and as this jar can not be mended , neither can they . The slaughter shall be so great that there won ’ t be room enough for decent burial anywhere , and their bodies shall be heaped in this valley .
TLB	Jeremiah	19	12	And as it will be in this valley , so it will be in Jerusalem . For I will fill Jerusalem with dead bodies too .
TLB	Jeremiah	19	13	And I will defile all the homes in Jerusalem , including the palace of the kings of Judah—wherever incense has been burned upon the roofs to your star gods , and libations poured out to them .
TLB	Jeremiah	19	14	As Jeremiah returned from Topheth where he had delivered this message , he stopped in front of the Temple of the Lord and said to all the people ,
TLB	Jeremiah	19	15	The Lord Almighty , the God of Israel , says : I will bring upon this city and her surrounding towns all the evil I have promised because you have stubbornly refused to listen to the Lord . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Jeremiah	20	20	Now when Pashhur ( son of Immer ) , the priest in charge of the Temple of the Lord , heard what Jeremiah was saying ,
TLB	Jeremiah	20	2	he arrested Jeremiah and had him whipped and put in the stocks at Benjamin Gate near the Temple .
TLB	Jeremiah	20	3	He left him there all night . The next day when Pashhur finally released him , Jeremiah said , “ Pashhur , the Lord has changed your name . He says from now on to call you ‘ The Man Who Lives in Terror. ’
TLB	Jeremiah	20	4	For the Lord will send terror on you and all your friends , and you will see them die by the swords of their enemies . I will hand over Judah to the king of Babylon , says the Lord , and he shall take away these people as slaves to Babylon and kill them .
TLB	Jeremiah	20	5	And I will let your enemies loot Jerusalem . All the famed treasures of the city , with the precious jewels and gold and silver of your kings , shall be carried off to Babylon .
TLB	Jeremiah	20	6	And as for you , Pashhur , you and all your family and household shall become slaves in Babylon and die there—you and those to whom you lied when you prophesied that everything would be all right. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	20	7	O Lord , you deceived me when you promised me your help . I have to give them your messages because you are stronger than I am , but now I am the laughingstock of the city , mocked by all .
TLB	Jeremiah	20	8	You have never once let me speak a word of kindness to them ; always it is disaster and horror and destruction . No wonder they scoff and mock and make my name a household joke .
TLB	Jeremiah	20	9	And I can ’ t quit ! For if I say I ’ ll never again mention the Lord—never more speak in his name—then his word in my heart is like fire that burns in my bones , and I can ’ t hold it in any longer .
TLB	Jeremiah	20	10	Yet on every side I hear their whispered threats and am afraid . “ We will report , ” they say . Even those who were my friends are watching me , waiting for a fatal slip . “ He will trap himself , ” they say , “ and then we will get our revenge on him. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	20	11	But the Lord stands beside me like a great warrior , and before him , the Mighty , Terrible One , they shall stumble . They can not defeat me ; they shall be shamed and thoroughly humiliated , and they shall have a stigma upon them forever .
TLB	Jeremiah	20	12	O Lord Almighty , who knows those who are righteous and examines the deepest thoughts of hearts and minds , let me see your vengeance on them . For I have committed my cause to you .
TLB	Jeremiah	20	13	Therefore , I will sing out in thanks to the Lord ! Praise him ! For he has delivered me , poor and needy , from my oppressors .
TLB	Jeremiah	20	14	Yet , cursed be the day that I was born !
TLB	Jeremiah	20	15	Cursed be the man who brought my father the news that a son was born .
TLB	Jeremiah	20	16	Let that messenger be destroyed like the cities of old which God overthrew without mercy . Terrify him all day long with battle shouts
TLB	Jeremiah	20	17	because he did not kill me at my birth ! Oh , that I had died within my mother ’ s womb , that it had been my grave !
TLB	Jeremiah	20	18	Why was I ever born ? For my life has been but trouble and sorrow and shame . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Jeremiah	21	21	Then King Zedekiah sent Pashhur ( son of Malchiah ) and Zephaniah the priest ( son of Maaseiah ) to Jeremiah and begged , “ Ask the Lord to help us , for Nebuchadnezzar , king of Babylon , has declared war on us !
TLB	Jeremiah	21	2	Perhaps the Lord will be gracious to us and do a mighty miracle as in olden times [ a ] and force Nebuchadnezzar to withdraw his forces. ” 3-4 Jeremiah replied , “ Go back to King Zedekiah and tell him the Lord God of Israel says , I will make all your weapons useless against the king of Babylon and the Chaldeans besieging you . In fact , I will bring your enemies right into the heart of this city ,
TLB	Jeremiah	21	5	and I myself will fight against you , for I am very angry .
TLB	Jeremiah	21	6	And I will send a terrible plague on this city , and both men and animals shall die .
TLB	Jeremiah	21	7	And finally I will deliver King Zedekiah himself and all the remnant left in the city into the hands of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon , to slaughter them without pity or mercy .
TLB	Jeremiah	21	8	“ Tell these people : This is what the Lord says ! Take your choice of life or death !
TLB	Jeremiah	21	9	Stay here in Jerusalem and die—slaughtered by your enemies , killed by starvation and disease—or go out and surrender to the Chaldean army and live .
TLB	Jeremiah	21	10	For I have set my face against this city ; I will be its enemy and not its friend , says the Lord . It shall be captured by the king of Babylon and he shall reduce it to ashes .
TLB	Jeremiah	21	11	“ And to the king of Judah , the Lord says :
TLB	Jeremiah	21	12	I am ready to judge you because of all the evil you are doing . Quick ! Give justice to these you judge ! Begin doing what is right before my burning fury flashes out upon you like a fire no man can quench .
TLB	Jeremiah	21	13	I will fight against this city of Jerusalem that boasts , ‘ We are safe ; no one can touch us here ! ’
TLB	Jeremiah	21	14	And I myself will destroy you for your sinfulness , says the Lord . I will light a fire in the forests that will burn up everything in its path. ” Footnotes - Jeremiah 21:2 as in olden times . King Zedekiah doubtless had in mind God ’ s deliverances of Jerusalem from Sennacherib , king of Assyria , in the days of Hezekiah ( Isaiah 36–37 ) . But Zedekiah ’ s hopes were dashed .

TLB	Jeremiah	22	22	And now all your allies have disappeared with a puff of wind ; all your friends are taken off as slaves . Surely at last you will see your wickedness and be ashamed .
TLB	Jeremiah	22	2	Listen to this message from God , O king of Judah , sitting on David ’ s throne ; and let your servants and your people listen too .
TLB	Jeremiah	22	3	The Lord says : Be fair-minded . Do what is right ! Help those in need of justice ! Quit your evil deeds ! Protect the rights of aliens and immigrants , orphans and widows ; stop murdering the innocent !
TLB	Jeremiah	22	4	If you put an end to all these terrible deeds you are doing , then I will deliver this nation and once more give kings to sit on David ’ s throne , and there shall be prosperity for all .
TLB	Jeremiah	22	5	But if you refuse to pay attention to this warning , I swear by my own name , says the Lord , that this palace shall become a shambles .
TLB	Jeremiah	22	6	For this is the Lord ’ s message concerning the palace : You are as beloved to me as fruitful Gilead and the green forests of Lebanon ; but I will destroy you and leave you deserted and uninhabited .
TLB	Jeremiah	22	7	I will call for a wrecking crew to bring out its tools to dismantle you . They will tear out all of your fine cedar beams and throw them on the fire .
TLB	Jeremiah	22	8	Men from many nations will pass by the ruins of this city and say to one another , “ Why did the Lord do it ? Why did he destroy such a great city ? ”
TLB	Jeremiah	22	9	And the answer will be , “ Because the people living here forgot the Lord their God and violated his agreement with them , for they worshiped idols. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	22	10	Don ’ t weep for the dead ! Instead weep for the captives led away ! For they will never return to see their native land again .
TLB	Jeremiah	22	11	For the Lord says this about Jehoahaz who succeeded his father [ a ] King Josiah and was taken away as a captive :
TLB	Jeremiah	22	12	He shall die in a distant land [ b ] and never again see his own country .
TLB	Jeremiah	22	13	And woe to you , King Jehoiakim , [ c ] for you are building your great palace with forced labor . By not paying wages you are building injustice into its walls and oppression into its doorframes and ceilings .
TLB	Jeremiah	22	14	You say , “ I will build a magnificent palace with huge rooms and many windows , paneled throughout with fragrant cedar and painted a lovely red. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	22	15	But a beautiful palace does not make a great king ! Why did your father Josiah reign so long ? Because he was just and fair in all his dealings . That is why God blessed him .
TLB	Jeremiah	22	16	He saw to it that justice and help were given the poor and the needy and all went well for him . This is how a man lives close to God .
TLB	Jeremiah	22	17	But you ! You are full of selfish greed and all dishonesty ! You murder the innocent , oppress the poor , and reign with ruthlessness .

He ruled from 609–598 B.C . - Jeremiah 22:24 Coniah , is an abbreviation—perhaps a disparaging nickname for Jeconiah and Jehoiachin , his other names .

TLB	Jeremiah	22	19	He shall be buried like a dead donkey—dragged out of Jerusalem and thrown on the garbage dump beyond the gate !
TLB	Jeremiah	22	20	Weep , for your allies are gone . Search for them in Lebanon ; shout for them at Bashan ; seek them at the fording points of Jordan . See , they are all destroyed . Not one is left to help you !
TLB	Jeremiah	22	21	When you were prosperous , I warned you , but you replied , “ Don ’ t bother me. ” Since childhood you have been that way—you just won ’ t listen !
TLB	Jeremiah	22	23	It ’ s very nice to live graciously in a beautiful palace among the cedars of Lebanon , but soon you will cry and groan in anguish—anguish as of a woman in labor . 24-25 And as for you , Coniah , [ d ] son of Jehoiakim king of Judah—even if you were the signet ring on my right hand , I would pull you off and give you to those who seek to kill you , of whom you are so desperately afraid—to Nebuchadnezzar , king of Babylon , and his mighty army .
TLB	Jeremiah	22	26	I will throw you and your mother out of this country , and you shall die in a foreign land .
TLB	Jeremiah	22	27	You will never again return to the land of your desire .
TLB	Jeremiah	22	28	This man Coniah is like a discarded , broken dish . He and his children will be exiled to distant lands .
TLB	Jeremiah	22	29	O earth , earth , earth ! Hear the word of the Lord !

TLB	Jeremiah	23	23	Am I a God who is only in one place and can not see what they are doing ?
TLB	Jeremiah	23	2	Instead of leading my flock to safety , you have deserted them and driven them to destruction . And now I will pour out judgment upon you for the evil you have done to them .
TLB	Jeremiah	23	3	And I will gather together the remnant of my flock from wherever I have sent them and bring them back into their own fold , and they shall be fruitful and increase .
TLB	Jeremiah	23	4	And I will appoint responsible shepherds to care for them , and they shall not need to be afraid again ; all of them shall be accounted for continually . 5-6 For the time is coming , says the Lord , when I will place a righteous Branch upon King David ’ s throne . He shall be a King who shall rule with wisdom and justice and cause righteousness to prevail everywhere throughout the earth . [ a ] And this is his name : The Lord Our Righteousness . At that time Judah will be saved and Israel will live in peace .
TLB	Jeremiah	23	7	In that day people will no longer say when taking an oath , “ As the Lord lives who rescued the people of Israel from the land of Egypt , ”
TLB	Jeremiah	23	8	but they will say , “ As the Lord lives who brought the Jews back to their own land of Israel from the countries to which he had exiled them. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	23	9	My heart is broken for the false prophets , full of deceit . I awake with fear and stagger as a drunkard does from wine because of the awful fate awaiting them , [ b ] for God has decreed holy words of judgment against them .
TLB	Jeremiah	23	10	For the land is full of adultery , and the curse of God is on it . The land itself is mourning—the pastures are dried up—for the prophets do evil , and their power is used wrongly .
TLB	Jeremiah	23	11	The priests are like the prophets , all ungodly , wicked men . I have seen their despicable acts right here in my own Temple , says the Lord .
TLB	Jeremiah	23	12	Therefore , their paths will be dark and slippery ; they will be chased down dark and treacherous trails and fall . For I will bring evil upon them and see to it , when their time has come , that they pay their penalty in full for all their sins .
TLB	Jeremiah	23	13	I knew the prophets of Samaria were unbelievably evil , for they prophesied by Baal and led my people Israel into sin ;
TLB	Jeremiah	23	14	but the prophets of Jerusalem are even worse ! The things they do are horrible ; they commit adultery and love dishonesty . They encourage and compliment those who are doing evil instead of turning them back from their sins . These prophets are as thoroughly depraved as the men of Sodom and Gomorrah were .
TLB	Jeremiah	23	15	Therefore the Lord Almighty says : I will feed them with bitterness and give them poison to drink . For it is because of them that wickedness fills this land .
TLB	Jeremiah	23	16	This is my warning to my people , says the Lord Almighty . Don ’ t listen to these false prophets when they prophesy to you , filling you with futile hopes . They are making up everything they say . They do not speak for me !
TLB	Jeremiah	23	17	They keep saying to these rebels who despise me , “ Don ’ t worry ! All is well ! ” ; and to those who live the way they want to , “ The Lord has said you shall have peace ! ”
TLB	Jeremiah	23	18	But can you name even one of these prophets who lives close enough to God to hear what he is saying ? Has even one of them cared enough to listen ?
TLB	Jeremiah	23	19	See , the Lord is sending a furious whirlwind to sweep away these wicked men .
TLB	Jeremiah	23	20	The terrible anger of the Lord will not abate until it has carried out the full penalty he decrees against them . Later , when Jerusalem has fallen , [ c ] you will see what I mean .
TLB	Jeremiah	23	21	I have not sent these prophets , yet they claim to speak for me ; I gave them no message , yet they say their words are mine .
TLB	Jeremiah	23	22	If they were mine , they would try to turn my people from their evil ways .
TLB	Jeremiah	23	24	Can anyone hide from me ? Am I not everywhere in all of heaven and earth ?
TLB	Jeremiah	23	25	“ Listen to the dream I had from God last night , ” they say . And then they proceed to lie in my name .
TLB	Jeremiah	23	26	How long will this continue ? If they are “ prophets , ” they are prophets of deceit , inventing everything they say .
TLB	Jeremiah	23	27	By telling these false dreams they are trying to get my people to forget me in the same way as their fathers did , who turned away to the idols of Baal .
TLB	Jeremiah	23	28	Let these false prophets tell their dreams and let my true messengers faithfully proclaim my every word . There is a difference between chaff and wheat !
TLB	Jeremiah	23	29	Does not my word burn like fire ? asks the Lord . Is it not like a mighty hammer that smashed the rock to pieces ? 30-31 So I stand against these “ prophets ” who get their messages from each other—these smooth-tongued “ prophets ” who say , “ This message is from God ! ”
TLB	Jeremiah	23	32	Their made-up dreams are flagrant lies that lead my people into sin . I did not send them , and they have no message at all for my people , says the Lord .
TLB	Jeremiah	23	33	When one of the people or one of their “ prophets ” or priests asks you , “ Well , Jeremiah , what is the sad news from the Lord today ? ” you shall reply , “ What sad news ? You are the sad news , for the Lord has cast you away ! ”
TLB	Jeremiah	23	34	And as for the false prophets and priests and people who joke about “ today ’ s sad news from God , ” I will punish them and their families for saying this .
TLB	Jeremiah	23	35	You can ask each other , “ What is God ’ s message ? What is he saying ? ”
TLB	Jeremiah	23	36	But stop using this term , “ God ’ s sad news. ” For what is sad is you and your lying . You are twisting my words and inventing “ messages from God ” that I didn ’ t speak .
TLB	Jeremiah	23	37	You may respectfully ask Jeremiah , “ What is the Lord ’ s message ? What has he said to you ? ” 38-39 But if you ask him about “ today ’ s sad news from God , ” when I have warned you not to mock like that , then I , the Lord God , will unburden myself of the burden [ d ] you are to me . I will cast you out of my presence , you and this city I gave to you and your fathers .
TLB	Jeremiah	23	40	And I will bring reproach upon you and your name shall be infamous through the ages . Footnotes - Jeremiah 23:5 throughout the earth , or “ throughout the land. ” - Jeremiah 23:9 because of the awful fate awaiting them , implied . - Jeremiah 23:20 Later , when Jerusalem has fallen , literally , “ In the latter days. ” - Jeremiah 23:38 will unburden myself of the burden , literally , “ the burden of the Lord , ” or “ the message of the Lord. ” This is a Hebrew pun .

TLB	Jeremiah	24	24	After Nebuchadnezzar , king of Babylon , had captured and enslaved Jeconiah ( son of Jehoiakim ) , king of Judah , and exiled him to Babylon along with the princes of Judah and the skilled tradesmen—the carpenters and blacksmiths—the Lord gave me this vision .
TLB	Jeremiah	24	2	I saw two baskets of figs placed in front of the Temple in Jerusalem . In one basket there were fresh , just-ripened figs , but in the other the figs were spoiled and moldy—too rotten to eat .
TLB	Jeremiah	24	3	Then the Lord said to me , “ What do you see , Jeremiah ? ” I replied , “ Figs , some very good and some very bad. ” 4-5 Then the Lord said : “ The good figs represent the exiles sent to Babylon . I have done it for their good .
TLB	Jeremiah	24	6	I will see that they are well treated , and I will bring them back here again . I will help them and not hurt them ; I will plant them and not pull them up .
TLB	Jeremiah	24	7	I will give them hearts that respond to me . They shall be my people and I will be their God , for they shall return to me with great joy .
TLB	Jeremiah	24	8	“ But the rotten figs represent Zedekiah , king of Judah , his officials , and all the others of Jerusalem left here in this land ; those too who live in Egypt . I will treat them like spoiled figs , too bad to use .
TLB	Jeremiah	24	9	I will make them repulsive to every nation of the earth , and they shall be mocked and taunted and cursed wherever I compel them to go .
TLB	Jeremiah	24	10	And I will send massacre and famine and disease among them until they are destroyed from the land of Israel , which I gave to them and to their fathers. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Jeremiah	25	25	and all the kings of Zimri , Elam , and Media ;
TLB	Jeremiah	25	4	Again and again down through the years , God has sent you his prophets , but you have refused to hear .
TLB	Jeremiah	25	5	. The troops of Cyrus the Great entered Babylon in
TLB	Jeremiah	25	6	Don ’ t anger me by worshiping idols ; but if you are true to me , then I ’ ll not harm you. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	25	7	But you won ’ t listen ; you have gone ahead and made me furious with your idols . So you have brought upon yourselves all the evil that has come your way . 8-9 And now the Lord God says : Because you have not listened to me , I will gather together all the armies of the north under Nebuchadnezzar , king of Babylon ( I have appointed him as my deputy ) , and I will bring them all against this land and its people and against the other nations near you , and I will utterly destroy you and make you a byword of contempt forever .
TLB	Jeremiah	25	10	I will take away your joy , your gladness , and your wedding feasts ; your businesses shall fail , and all your homes shall lie in silent darkness .
TLB	Jeremiah	25	11	This entire land shall become a desolate wasteland ; all the world will be shocked at the disaster that befalls you . Israel and her neighboring lands shall serve the king of Babylon for seventy years .
TLB	Jeremiah	25	12	Then , after these years [ a ] of slavery are ended , I will punish the king of Babylon and his people for their sins ; I will make the land of Chaldea an everlasting waste .
TLB	Jeremiah	25	13	I will bring upon them all the terrors I have promised in this book—all the penalties announced by Jeremiah against the nations .
TLB	Jeremiah	25	14	For many nations and great kings shall enslave the Chaldeans , just as they enslaved my people ; I will punish them in proportion to their treatment of my people .
TLB	Jeremiah	25	15	For the Lord God said to me : “ Take from my hand this wine cup filled to the brim with my fury , and make all the nations to whom I send you drink from it .
TLB	Jeremiah	25	16	They shall drink from it and reel , crazed by the death blows I rain upon them. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	25	17	So I took the cup of fury from the Lord and made all the nations drink from it—every nation God had sent me to ;
TLB	Jeremiah	25	18	I went to Jerusalem and to the cities of Judah , and their kings and princes drank of the cup so that from that day until this they have been desolate , hated , and cursed , just as they are today . 19-20 I went to Egypt , and Pharaoh , his servants , the princes , and the people—they too drank from that terrible cup , along with all the foreign population living in his land . So did all the kings of the land of Uz and the kings of the Philistine cities : Ashkelon , Gaza , Ekron , and what remains of Ashdod ,
TLB	Jeremiah	25	21	and I visited the nations of Edom , Moab , and Ammon ;
TLB	Jeremiah	25	22	and all the kings of Tyre and Sidon , and the kings of the regions across the sea ;
TLB	Jeremiah	25	23	Dedan , Tema , and Buz , and the other heathen there ;
TLB	Jeremiah	25	24	and all the kings of Arabia and of the nomadic tribes of the desert ;
TLB	Jeremiah	25	26	and all the kings of the northern countries , far and near , one after the other ; and all the kingdoms of the world . And finally , the king of Babylon himself drank from this cup of God ’ s wrath .
TLB	Jeremiah	25	27	Tell them , “ The Lord of heaven ’ s armies , the God of Israel , says : Drink from this cup of my wrath until you are drunk and vomit and fall to rise no more , for I am sending terrible wars upon you. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	25	28	And if they refuse to accept the cup , tell them , “ The Lord of heaven ’ s armies says you must drink it ! You can not escape !
TLB	Jeremiah	25	29	I have begun to punish my own people , so should you go free ? No , you shall not evade punishment . I will call for war against all the peoples of the earth. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	25	30	Therefore prophesy against them . Tell them the Lord will shout against his own from his holy temple in heaven and against all those living on the earth . He will shout as the harvesters do who tread the juice from the grapes .
TLB	Jeremiah	25	31	That cry of judgment will reach the farthest ends of the earth , for the Lord has a case against all the nations—all mankind . He will slaughter all the wicked .
TLB	Jeremiah	25	32	See , declares the Lord Almighty , the punishment shall go from nation to nation—a great whirlwind of wrath shall rise against the farthest corners of the earth .
TLB	Jeremiah	25	33	On that day those the Lord has slain shall fill the earth from one end to the other . No one shall mourn for them nor gather up the bodies to bury them ; they shall fertilize the earth .
TLB	Jeremiah	25	34	Weep and moan , O evil shepherds ; let the leaders of mankind beat their heads upon the stones , for their time has come to be slaughtered and scattered ; they shall fall like fragile women .
TLB	Jeremiah	25	35	And you will find no place to hide , no way to escape .
TLB	Jeremiah	25	36	Listen to the frantic cries of the shepherds and to the leaders shouting in despair , for the Lord has spoiled their pastures .
TLB	Jeremiah	25	37	People now living undisturbed will be cut down by the fierceness of the anger of the Lord .
TLB	Jeremiah	25	38	He has left his lair like a lion seeking prey ; their land has been laid waste by warring armies—because of the fierce anger of the Lord . Footnotes - Jeremiah 25:12 after these years , literally , “ after the seventy years. ” I will punish the king of Babylon . This event is further described in Daniel

TLB	Jeremiah	26	26	This message came to Jeremiah from the Lord during the first year of the reign of Jehoiakim ( son of Josiah ) , king of Judah :
TLB	Jeremiah	26	2	Kings 22:12 . The Living Bible copyright ©
TLB	Jeremiah	26	3	For perhaps they will listen and turn from their evil ways , and then I can withhold all the punishment I am ready to pour out upon them because of their evil deeds .
TLB	Jeremiah	26	4	Tell them the Lord says : If you will not listen to me and obey the laws I have given you ,
TLB	Jeremiah	26	5	and if you will not listen to my servants , the prophets—for I sent them again and again to warn you , but you would not listen to them—
TLB	Jeremiah	26	6	then I will destroy this Temple as I destroyed the Tabernacle at Shiloh , and I will make Jerusalem a curse word in every nation of the earth . 7-8 When Jeremiah had finished his message , saying everything the Lord had told him to , the priests and false prophets and all the people in the Temple mobbed him , shouting , “ Kill him ! Kill him !
TLB	Jeremiah	26	9	What right do you have to say the Lord will destroy this Temple like the one at Shiloh ? ” they yelled . “ What do you mean—Jerusalem destroyed and not one survivor ? ”
TLB	Jeremiah	26	10	When the high officials of Judah heard what was going on , they rushed over from the palace and sat down at the door of the Temple to hold court .
TLB	Jeremiah	26	11	Then the priests and the false prophets presented their accusations to the officials and the people . “ This man should die ! ” they said . “ You have heard with your own ears what a traitor he is , for he has prophesied against this city. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	26	12	Then Jeremiah spoke in his defense . “ The Lord sent me , ” he said , “ to prophesy against this Temple and this city . He gave me every word of all that I have spoken .
TLB	Jeremiah	26	13	But if you stop your sinning and begin obeying the Lord your God , he will cancel all the punishment he has announced against you .
TLB	Jeremiah	26	14	As for me , I am helpless and in your power—do with me as you think best .
TLB	Jeremiah	26	15	But there is one thing sure , if you kill me , you will be killing an innocent man , and the responsibility will lie upon you and upon this city and upon every person living in it ; for it is absolutely true that the Lord sent me to speak every word that you have heard from me. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	26	16	Then the officials and people said to the priests and false prophets , “ This man does not deserve the death sentence , for he has spoken to us in the name of the Lord our God. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	26	17	Then some of the wise old men stood and spoke to all the people standing around and said :
TLB	Jeremiah	26	18	“ The decision is right ; for back in the days when Micah of Moresheth prophesied in the days of King Hezekiah of Judah , he told the people that God said : ‘ This hill shall be plowed like an open field and this city of Jerusalem razed into heaps of stone , and a forest shall grow at the top where the great Temple now stands ! ’
TLB	Jeremiah	26	19	But did King Hezekiah and the people kill him for saying this ? No , they turned from their wickedness and worshiped the Lord and begged the Lord to have mercy upon them ; and the Lord held back the terrible punishment he had pronounced against them . If we kill Jeremiah for giving us the messages of God , who knows what God will do to us ! ”
TLB	Jeremiah	26	20	Another true prophet of the Lord , Uriah ( son of Shemaiah ) from Kiriath-jearim , was also denouncing the city and the nation at the same time as Jeremiah was .
TLB	Jeremiah	26	21	But when King Jehoiakim and the army officers and officials heard what he was saying , the king sent to kill him . Uriah heard about it and fled to Egypt .
TLB	Jeremiah	26	22	Then King Jehoiakim sent Elnathan ( son of Achbor ) to Egypt along with several other men to capture Uriah .
TLB	Jeremiah	26	23	They took him prisoner and brought him back to King Jehoiakim , who butchered him with a sword and had him buried in an unmarked grave .
TLB	Jeremiah	26	24	But Ahikam ( son of Shaphan ) , the royal secretary , [ a ] stood with Jeremiah and persuaded the court not to turn him over to the mob to kill him . Footnotes - Jeremiah 26:24 the royal secretary , implied ; see

TLB	Jeremiah	27	27	This message came to Jeremiah from the Lord at the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim [ a ] ( son of Josiah ) , king of Judah :
TLB	Jeremiah	27	2	“ Make a yoke and fasten it on your neck with leather thongs as you would strap a yoke on an ox .
TLB	Jeremiah	27	3	Then send messages to the kings of Edom , Moab , Ammon , Tyre , and Sidon , through their ambassadors in Jerusalem ,
TLB	Jeremiah	27	4	saying , Tell your masters that the Lord , the God of Israel , sends you this message :
TLB	Jeremiah	27	5	“ By my great power I have made the earth and all mankind and every animal ; and I give these things of mine to anyone I want to .
TLB	Jeremiah	27	6	So now I have given all your countries to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon , who is my deputy . And I have handed over to him all your cattle for his use .
TLB	Jeremiah	27	7	All the nations shall serve him and his son and his grandson until his time is up , and then many nations and great kings shall conquer Babylon and make him their slave .
TLB	Jeremiah	27	8	Submit to him and serve him—put your neck under Babylon ’ s yoke ! I will punish any nation refusing to be his slave ; I will send war , famine , and disease upon that nation until he has conquered it .
TLB	Jeremiah	27	9	“ Do not listen to your false prophets , fortune-tellers , dreamers , mediums , and magicians who say the king of Babylon will not enslave you .
TLB	Jeremiah	27	10	For they are all liars , and if you follow their advice and refuse to submit to the king of Babylon , I will drive you out of your land and send you far away to perish .
TLB	Jeremiah	27	11	But the people of any nation submitting to the king of Babylon will be permitted to stay in their own country and farm the land as usual. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	27	12	Jeremiah repeated all these prophecies to Zedekiah , king of Judah . “ If you want to live , submit to the king of Babylon , ” he said .
TLB	Jeremiah	27	13	“ Why do you insist on dying—you and your people ? Why should you choose war and famine and disease , which the Lord has promised to every nation that will not submit to Babylon ’ s king ?
TLB	Jeremiah	27	14	Don ’ t listen to the false prophets who keep telling you the king of Babylon will not conquer you , for they are liars .
TLB	Jeremiah	27	15	I have not sent them , says the Lord , and they are telling you lies in my name . If you insist on heeding them , I must drive you from this land to die—you and all these ‘ prophets ’ too. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	27	16	I spoke again and again to the priests and all the people and told them : “ This is what the Lord says ! Don ’ t listen to your prophets who are telling you that soon the gold dishes taken from the Temple will be returned from Babylon . It is all a lie .
TLB	Jeremiah	27	17	Don ’ t listen to them . Surrender to the king of Babylon and live , for otherwise this whole city will be destroyed .
TLB	Jeremiah	27	18	If they are really God ’ s prophets , then let them pray to the Lord Almighty that the gold dishes still here in the Temple , left from before , and that those in the palace of the king of Judah and in the palaces in Jerusalem will not be carried away with you to Babylon ! 19-21 “ For the Lord Almighty says : The pillars of bronze standing before the Temple , the great bronze basin in the Temple court , the metal stands , and all the other ceremonial articles left here by Nebuchadnezzar , king of Babylon , when he exiled all the important people of Judah and Jerusalem to Babylon , along with Jeconiah ( son of Jehoiakim ) , king of Judah ,
TLB	Jeremiah	27	22	will all yet be carried away to Babylon and will stay there until I send for them . Then I will bring them all back to Jerusalem again. ” Footnotes - Jeremiah 27:1 reign of Jehoiakim . Some versions read “ Zedekiah. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Jeremiah	28	28	On a December day in that same year—the fourth year of the reign of Zedekiah , king of Judah—Hananiah ( son of Azzur ) , a false prophet from Gibeon , addressed me publicly in the Temple while all the priests and people listened . He said :
TLB	Jeremiah	28	2	“ The Lord of Hosts , the God of Israel , declares : I have removed the yoke of the king of Babylon from your necks .
TLB	Jeremiah	28	3	Within two years I will bring back all the Temple treasures that Nebuchadnezzar carried off to Babylon ,
TLB	Jeremiah	28	4	and I will bring back King Jeconiah , [ a ] son of Jehoiakim , king of Judah , and all the other captives exiled to Babylon , says the Lord . I will surely remove the yoke put on your necks by the king of Babylon. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	28	5	Then Jeremiah said to Hananiah , in front of all the priests and people ,
TLB	Jeremiah	28	6	“ Amen ! May your prophecies come true ! I hope the Lord will do everything you say and bring back from Babylon the treasures of this Temple , with all our loved ones .
TLB	Jeremiah	28	7	But listen now to the solemn words I speak to you in the presence of all these people .
TLB	Jeremiah	28	8	The ancient prophets who preceded you and me spoke against many nations , always warning of war , famine , and plague .
TLB	Jeremiah	28	9	So a prophet who foretells peace has the burden of proof on him to prove that God has really sent him . Only when his message comes true can it be known that he really is from God. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	28	10	Then Hananiah , the false prophet , took the yoke off Jeremiah ’ s neck and broke it .
TLB	Jeremiah	28	11	And Hananiah said again to the crowd that had gathered , “ The Lord has promised that within two years he will release all the nations now in slavery to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. ” At that point Jeremiah walked out .
TLB	Jeremiah	28	12	Soon afterwards the Lord gave this message to Jeremiah :
TLB	Jeremiah	28	13	Go and tell Hananiah that the Lord says : You have broken a wooden yoke , but these people have yokes of iron on their necks .
TLB	Jeremiah	28	14	The Lord , the God of Israel , says : I have put a yoke of iron on the necks of all these nations , forcing them into slavery to Nebuchadnezzar , king of Babylon . And nothing will change this decree , for I have even given him all your flocks and herds .
TLB	Jeremiah	28	15	Then Jeremiah said to Hananiah , the false prophet , “ Listen , Hananiah , the Lord has not sent you , and the people are believing your lies .
TLB	Jeremiah	28	16	Therefore the Lord says you must die . This very year your life will end because you have rebelled against the Lord. ”

TLB	Jeremiah	29	29	Zephaniah took the letter over to Jeremiah and read it to him !
TLB	Jeremiah	29	3	He sent the letter with Elasah ( son of Shaphan ) and Gemariah ( son of Hilkiah ) when they went to Babylon as King Zedekiah ’ s ambassadors to Nebuchadnezzar . And this is what the letter said :
TLB	Jeremiah	29	4	The Lord Almighty , the God of Israel , sends this message to all the captives he has exiled to Babylon from Jerusalem :
TLB	Jeremiah	29	5	Build homes and plan to stay ; plant vineyards , for you will be there many years .
TLB	Jeremiah	29	6	Marry and have children , and then find mates for them and have many grandchildren . Multiply ! Don ’ t dwindle away !
TLB	Jeremiah	29	7	And work for the peace and prosperity of Babylon . Pray for her , for if Babylon has peace , so will you .
TLB	Jeremiah	29	8	The Lord Almighty , the God of Israel , says : Don ’ t let the false prophets and mediums who are there among you fool you . Don ’ t listen to the dreams that they invent ,
TLB	Jeremiah	29	9	for they prophesy lies in my name . I have not sent them , says the Lord .
TLB	Jeremiah	29	10	The truth is this : You will be in Babylon for seventy years . But then I will come and do for you all the good things I have promised and bring you home again .
TLB	Jeremiah	29	11	For I know the plans I have for you , says the Lord . They are plans for good and not for evil , to give you a future and a hope .
TLB	Jeremiah	29	12	In those days when you pray , I will listen .
TLB	Jeremiah	29	13	You will find me when you seek me , if you look for me in earnest .
TLB	Jeremiah	29	14	Yes , says the Lord , I will be found by you , and I will end your slavery and restore your fortunes ; I will gather you out of the nations where I sent you and bring you back home again to your own land .
TLB	Jeremiah	29	15	But now , because you accept the false prophets among you and say the Lord has sent them , 16-17 I will send war , famine , and plague upon the people left here in Jerusalem—on your relatives who were not exiled to Babylon , and on the king who sits on David ’ s throne—and make them like rotting figs , too bad to eat .
TLB	Jeremiah	29	18	And I will scatter them around the world . And in every nation where I place them they will be cursed and hissed and mocked ,
TLB	Jeremiah	29	19	for they refuse to listen to me though I spoke to them again and again through my prophets .
TLB	Jeremiah	29	20	Therefore listen to the word of God , all you Jewish captives over there in Babylon .
TLB	Jeremiah	29	21	The Lord Almighty , the God of Israel , says this about your false prophets , Ahab ( son of Kolaiah ) and Zedekiah ( son of Maaseiah ) , who are declaring lies to you in my name : Look , I am turning them over to Nebuchadnezzar to execute publicly .
TLB	Jeremiah	29	22	Their fate shall become proverbial of all evil , so that whenever anyone wants to curse someone he will say , “ The Lord make you like Zedekiah and Ahab whom the king of Babylon burned alive ! ”
TLB	Jeremiah	29	23	For these men have done a terrible thing among my people . They have committed adultery with their neighbors ’ wives and have lied in my name . I know , for I have seen everything they do , says the Lord .
TLB	Jeremiah	29	24	And say this to Shemaiah the dreamer : [ a ]
TLB	Jeremiah	29	25	The Lord , the God of Israel , says : You have written a letter to Zephaniah ( son of Maaseiah ) the priest , and sent copies to all the other priests and to everyone in Jerusalem .
TLB	Jeremiah	29	26	And in this letter you have said to Zephaniah , “ The Lord has appointed you to replace Jehoiada as priest in Jerusalem . And it is your responsibility to arrest any madman who claims to be a prophet and to put him in the stocks and collar .
TLB	Jeremiah	29	27	Why haven ’ t you done something about this false prophet Jeremiah of Anathoth ?
TLB	Jeremiah	29	28	For he has written to us here in Babylon saying that our captivity will be long ; that we should build permanent homes and plan to stay many years ; that we should plant fruit trees , for we will be here to eat the fruit from them for a long time to come. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	29	30	Then the Lord gave this message to Jeremiah :
TLB	Jeremiah	29	31	Send an open letter to all the exiles in Babylon and tell them this : The Lord says that because Shemaiah the Nehelamite has “ prophesied ” to you when I didn ’ t send him and has fooled you into believing his lies ,
TLB	Jeremiah	29	32	I will punish him and his family . None of his descendants shall see the good I have waiting for my people , for he has taught you to rebel against the Lord . Footnotes - Jeremiah 29:24 Shemaiah the dreamer , literally , “ Shemaiah the Nehelamite. ” Nehelem was Shemaiah ’ s hometown , the name of which means “ dreamer. ” This seems to be another of the frequent puns in the prophetic books .

TLB	Jeremiah	30	30	This is another of the Lord ’ s messages to Jeremiah :
TLB	Jeremiah	30	2	The Lord God of Israel says : Write down for the record all that I have said to you .
TLB	Jeremiah	30	3	For the time is coming when I will restore the fortunes of my people , Israel and Judah , and I will bring them home to this land that I gave to their fathers ; they shall possess it and live here again .
TLB	Jeremiah	30	4	And write this also concerning Israel and Judah :
TLB	Jeremiah	30	5	“ Where shall we find peace ? ” they cry . “ There is only fear and trembling .
TLB	Jeremiah	30	6	Do men give birth ? Then why do they stand there , ashen-faced , hands pressed against their sides like women in labor ? ”
TLB	Jeremiah	30	7	Alas , in all history when has there ever been a time of terror such as in that coming day ? It is a time of trouble for my people—for Jacob—such as they have never known before . Yet God will rescue them !
TLB	Jeremiah	30	8	For on that day , says the Lord Almighty , I will break the yoke from their necks and snap their chains , and foreigners shall no longer be their masters !
TLB	Jeremiah	30	9	For they shall serve the Lord their God , and David their King , [ a ] whom I will raise up for them , says the Lord .
TLB	Jeremiah	30	10	So don ’ t be afraid , O Jacob my servant ; don ’ t be dismayed , O Israel ; for I will bring you home again from distant lands , and your children from their exile . They shall have rest and quiet in their own land , and no one shall make them afraid .
TLB	Jeremiah	30	11	For I am with you and I will save you , says the Lord . Even if I utterly destroy the nations where I scatter you , I will not exterminate you ; I will punish you , yes—you will not go unpunished .
TLB	Jeremiah	30	12	For your sin is an incurable bruise , a terrible wound .
TLB	Jeremiah	30	13	There is no one to help you or to bind up your wound , and no medicine does any good .
TLB	Jeremiah	30	14	All your lovers have left you and don ’ t care anything about you anymore ; for I have wounded you cruelly , as though I were your enemy ; mercilessly , as though I were an implacable foe ; for your sins are so many , your guilt is so great .
TLB	Jeremiah	30	15	Why do you protest your punishment ? Your sin is so scandalous that your sorrow should never end ! It is because your guilt is great that I have had to punish you so much .
TLB	Jeremiah	30	16	But in that coming day , all who are destroying you shall be destroyed , and all your enemies shall be slaves . Those who rob you shall be robbed ; and those attacking you shall be attacked .
TLB	Jeremiah	30	17	I will give you back your health again and heal your wounds . Now you are called “ The Outcast ” and “ Jerusalem , the Place Nobody Wants. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	30	18	But , says the Lord , when I bring you home again from your captivity and restore your fortunes , Jerusalem will be rebuilt upon her ruins ; the palace will be reconstructed as it was before .
TLB	Jeremiah	30	19	The cities will be filled with joy and great thanksgiving , and I will multiply my people and make of them a great and honored nation .
TLB	Jeremiah	30	20	Their children shall prosper as in David ’ s reign ; their nations shall be established before me , and I will punish anyone who hurts them .
TLB	Jeremiah	30	21	They will have their own ruler again . [ b ] He will not be a foreigner . And I will invite him to be a priest at my altars , and he shall approach me , for who would dare to come unless invited .
TLB	Jeremiah	30	22	And you shall be my people , and I will be your God .
TLB	Jeremiah	30	23	Suddenly the devastating whirlwind of the Lord roars with fury ; it shall burst upon the heads of the wicked .
TLB	Jeremiah	30	24	The Lord will not call off the fierceness of his wrath until it has finished all the terrible destruction he has planned . Later on [ c ] you will understand what I am telling you .

TLB	Jeremiah	31	31	The day will come , says the Lord , when I will make a new contract with the people of Israel and Judah .
TLB	Jeremiah	31	2	I will care for them as I did those who escaped from Egypt , to whom I showed my mercies in the wilderness , when Israel sought for rest .
TLB	Jeremiah	31	3	For long ago the Lord had said to Israel : I have loved you , O my people , with an everlasting love ; with loving-kindness I have drawn you to me .
TLB	Jeremiah	31	4	I will rebuild your nation , O virgin of Israel . You will again be happy and dance merrily with the timbrels .
TLB	Jeremiah	31	5	Again you will plant your vineyards upon the mountains of Samaria and eat from your own gardens there .
TLB	Jeremiah	31	6	The day shall come when watchmen on the hills of Ephraim will call out and say , “ Arise , and let us go up to Zion to the Lord our God. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	31	7	For the Lord says : Sing with joy for all that I will do for Israel , the greatest of the nations ! Shout out with praise and joy : “ The Lord has saved his people , the remnant of Israel. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	31	8	For I will bring them from the north and from earth ’ s farthest ends , not forgetting their blind and lame , young mothers with their little ones , those ready to give birth . It will be a great company who comes .
TLB	Jeremiah	31	9	Tears of joy shall stream down their faces , and I will lead them home with great care . They shall walk beside the quiet streams and not stumble . For I am a Father to Israel , and Ephraim is my oldest child .
TLB	Jeremiah	31	10	Listen to this message from the Lord , you nations of the world , and publish it abroad : The Lord who scattered his people will gather them back together again and watch over them as a shepherd does his flock .
TLB	Jeremiah	31	11	He will save Israel from those who are too strong for them !
TLB	Jeremiah	31	12	They shall come home and sing songs of joy upon the hills of Zion and shall be radiant over the goodness of the Lord—the good crops , the wheat , the wine , and the oil , and the healthy flocks and herds . Their life shall be like a watered garden , and all their sorrows shall be gone .
TLB	Jeremiah	31	13	The young girls will dance for joy , and menfolk—old and young—will take their part in all the fun ; for I will turn their mourning into joy , and I will comfort them and make them rejoice , for their captivity with all its sorrows will be behind them .
TLB	Jeremiah	31	14	I will feast the priests with the abundance of offerings brought to them at the Temple ; I will satisfy my people with my bounty , says the Lord .
TLB	Jeremiah	31	15	The Lord spoke to me again , saying : In Ramah there is bitter weeping—Rachel [ a ] is weeping for her children and can not be comforted , for they are gone .
TLB	Jeremiah	31	16	But the Lord says : Don ’ t cry any longer , for I have heard your prayers [ b ] and you will see them again ; they will come back to you from the distant land of the enemy .
TLB	Jeremiah	31	17	There is hope for your future , says the Lord , and your children will come again to their own land .
TLB	Jeremiah	31	18	I have heard Ephraim ’ s groans : “ You have punished me greatly ; but I needed it all , as a calf must be trained for the yoke . Turn me again to you and restore me , for you alone are the Lord , my God .
TLB	Jeremiah	31	19	I turned away from God , but I was sorry afterwards . I kicked myself for my stupidity . I was thoroughly ashamed of all I did in younger days. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	31	20	And the Lord replies : Ephraim is still my son , my darling child . I had to punish him , but I still love him . I long for him and surely will have mercy on him .
TLB	Jeremiah	31	21	As you travel into exile , set up road signs pointing back to Israel . Mark your pathway well . For you shall return again , O virgin Israel , to your cities here .
TLB	Jeremiah	31	22	How long will you vacillate , O wayward daughter ? For the Lord will cause something new and different to happen—Israel will search for God . [ c ]
TLB	Jeremiah	31	23	The Lord , the God of Israel , says : When I bring them back again , they shall say in Judah and her cities , “ The Lord bless you , O center of righteousness , O holy hill ! ”
TLB	Jeremiah	31	24	And city dwellers and farmers and shepherds alike shall live together in peace and happiness .
TLB	Jeremiah	31	25	For I have given rest to the weary and joy to all the sorrowing .
TLB	Jeremiah	31	26	( Then Jeremiah wakened . “ Such sleep is very sweet ! ” he said . )
TLB	Jeremiah	31	27	The Lord says : The time will come when I will greatly increase the population and multiply the number of cattle here in Israel .
TLB	Jeremiah	31	28	In the past I painstakingly destroyed the nation , but now I will carefully build it up .
TLB	Jeremiah	31	29	The people shall no longer quote this proverb— “ Children pay for their fathers ’ sins. ” [ d ]
TLB	Jeremiah	31	30	For everyone shall die for his own sins—the person eating sour grapes is the one whose teeth are set on edge .
TLB	Jeremiah	31	32	It won ’ t be like the one I made with their fathers when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt—a contract they broke , forcing me to reject them , [ e ] says the Lord .
TLB	Jeremiah	31	33	But this is the new contract I will make with them : I will inscribe my laws upon their hearts , [ f ] so that they shall want to honor me ; then they shall truly be my people and I will be their God .
TLB	Jeremiah	31	34	At that time it will no longer be necessary to admonish one another to know the Lord . For everyone , both great and small , shall really know me then , says the Lord , and I will forgive and forget their sins .
TLB	Jeremiah	31	35	The Lord who gives us sunlight in the daytime and the moon and stars to light the night , and who stirs the sea to make the roaring waves—his name is Lord Almighty—says this :
TLB	Jeremiah	31	36	I am as likely to reject my people Israel as I am to do away with these laws of nature !
TLB	Jeremiah	31	37	Not until the heavens can be measured and the foundations of the earth explored , will I consider casting them away forever for their sins ! 38-39 For the time is coming , says the Lord , when all Jerusalem shall be rebuilt for the Lord , from the tower of Hananel at the northeast corner , [ g ] to the Corner Gate at the northwest ; and from the hill of Gareb at the southwest , across to Goah on the southeast .
TLB	Jeremiah	31	40	And the entire city , including the graveyard and ash dump in the valley , and all the fields out to the brook of Kidron , and from there to the Horse Gate on the east side of the city , all shall be holy to the Lord ; it shall never again be captured or destroyed .

TLB	Jeremiah	32	32	The sins of Israel and Judah—the sins of the people , of their kings , officers , priests , and prophets—stir me up .
TLB	Jeremiah	32	2	At this time Jeremiah was imprisoned in the dungeon beneath the palace , [ a ] while the Babylonian army was besieging Jerusalem .
TLB	Jeremiah	32	3	King Zedekiah had put him there for continuing to prophesy that the city would be conquered by the king of Babylon ,
TLB	Jeremiah	32	4	and that King Zedekiah would be caught and taken as a prisoner before the king of Babylon for trial and sentencing .
TLB	Jeremiah	32	5	“ He shall take you to Babylon and imprison you there for many years until you die . Why fight the facts ? You can ’ t win ! Surrender now ! ” Jeremiah had told him again and again . 6-7 Then this message from the Lord came to Jeremiah : Your cousin Hanamel ( son of Shallum ) will soon arrive to ask you to buy the farm he owns in Anathoth , for by law you have a chance to buy before it is offered to anyone else .
TLB	Jeremiah	32	8	So Hanamel came , as the Lord had said he would , and visited me in the prison . “ Buy my field in Anathoth , in the land of Benjamin , ” he said , “ for the law gives you the first right to purchase it. ” Then I knew for sure that the message I had heard was really from the Lord .
TLB	Jeremiah	32	9	So I bought the field , paying Hanamel seventeen pieces of silver .
TLB	Jeremiah	32	10	I signed and sealed the deed of purchase before witnesses , weighed out the silver , and paid him .
TLB	Jeremiah	32	11	Then I took the sealed deed containing the terms and conditions and also the unsealed copy ,
TLB	Jeremiah	32	12	and publicly , in the presence of my cousin Hanamel and the witnesses who had signed the deed , and as the prison guards watched , I handed the papers to Baruch ( son of Neriah , who was the son of Mahseiah ) .
TLB	Jeremiah	32	13	And I said to him as they all listened :
TLB	Jeremiah	32	14	“ The Lord , God of Israel , says : Take both this sealed deed and the copy and put them into a pottery jar to preserve them for a long time .
TLB	Jeremiah	32	15	For the Lord , God of Israel , says : In the future these papers will be valuable . [ b ] Someday people will again own property here in this country and will be buying and selling houses and vineyards and fields. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	32	16	Then after I had given the papers to Baruch I prayed :
TLB	Jeremiah	32	17	“ O Lord God ! You have made the heavens and earth by your great power ; nothing is too hard for you !
TLB	Jeremiah	32	18	You are loving and kind to thousands , yet children suffer for their fathers ’ sins ; you are the great and mighty God , the Lord Almighty .
TLB	Jeremiah	32	19	You have all wisdom and do great and mighty miracles ; for your eyes are open to all the ways of men , and you reward everyone according to his life and deeds .
TLB	Jeremiah	32	20	You have done incredible things in the land of Egypt—things still remembered to this day . And you have continued to do great miracles in Israel and all around the world . You have made your name very great , as it is today .
TLB	Jeremiah	32	21	“ You brought Israel out of Egypt with mighty miracles and great power and terror .
TLB	Jeremiah	32	22	You gave Israel this land that you promised their fathers long ago—a wonderful land that ‘ flows with milk and honey. ’
TLB	Jeremiah	32	23	Our fathers came and conquered it and lived in it , but they refused to obey you or to follow your laws ; they have hardly done one thing you told them to . That is why you have sent all this terrible evil upon them .
TLB	Jeremiah	32	24	See how the siege mounds have been built against the city walls , and the Babylonians shall conquer the city by sword , famine , and disease . Everything has happened just as you said—as you determined it should !
TLB	Jeremiah	32	25	And yet you say to buy the field—paying good money for it before these witnesses—even though the city will belong to our enemies. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	32	26	Then this message came to Jeremiah :
TLB	Jeremiah	32	27	I am the Lord , the God of all mankind ; is there anything too hard for me ?
TLB	Jeremiah	32	28	Yes , I will give this city to the Babylonians and to Nebuchadnezzar , king of Babylon ; he shall conquer it .
TLB	Jeremiah	32	29	And the Babylonians outside the walls shall come in and set fire to the city and burn down all these houses , where the roofs have been used to offer incense to Baal and to pour out libations to other gods , causing my fury to rise !
TLB	Jeremiah	32	30	For Israel and Judah have done nothing but wrong since their earliest days ; they have infuriated me with all their evil deeds .
TLB	Jeremiah	32	31	From the time this city was built until now , it has done nothing but anger me ; so I am determined to be rid of it .
TLB	Jeremiah	32	33	They have turned their backs upon me and refused to return ; day after day , year after year , I taught them right from wrong , but they would not listen or obey .
TLB	Jeremiah	32	34	They have even defiled my own Temple by worshiping their abominable idols there .
TLB	Jeremiah	32	35	And they have built high altars to Baal in the valley of Hinnom . There they have burnt their children as sacrifices to Molech—something I never commanded and can not imagine suggesting . What an incredible evil , causing Judah to sin so greatly !
TLB	Jeremiah	32	36	Now therefore the Lord God of Israel says concerning this city that it will fall to the king of Babylon through warfare , famine , and disease ,
TLB	Jeremiah	32	37	but I will bring my people back again from all the countries where in my fury I will scatter them . I will bring them back to this very city and make them live in peace and safety .
TLB	Jeremiah	32	38	And they shall be my people , and I will be their God .
TLB	Jeremiah	32	39	And I will give them one heart and mind to worship me forever , for their own good and for the good of all their descendants .
TLB	Jeremiah	32	40	And I will make an everlasting covenant with them , promising never again to desert them but only to do them good . I will put a desire into their hearts to worship me , and they shall never leave me .
TLB	Jeremiah	32	41	I will rejoice to do them good and will replant them in this land with great joy .
TLB	Jeremiah	32	42	Just as I have sent all these terrors and evils upon them , so will I do all the good I have promised them .
TLB	Jeremiah	32	43	Fields will again be bought and sold in this land now ravaged by the Babylonians , where men and animals alike have disappeared .
TLB	Jeremiah	32	44	Yes , fields shall once again be bought and sold—deeds signed and sealed and witnessed—in the country of Benjamin and here in Jerusalem , in the cities of Judah and in the hill country , in the Philistine Plain and in the Negeb too , for some day I will restore prosperity to them .

TLB	Jeremiah	33	33	While Jeremiah was still in jail , the Lord sent him this second message :
TLB	Jeremiah	33	2	The Lord , the Maker of heaven and earth—Jehovah is his name—says this :
TLB	Jeremiah	33	3	Ask me and I will tell you some remarkable secrets about what is going to happen here .
TLB	Jeremiah	33	4	For though you have torn down the houses of this city , and the king ’ s palace too , for materials to strengthen the walls against the siege weapons of the enemy ,
TLB	Jeremiah	33	5	yet the Babylonians will enter , and the men of this city are already as good as dead , for I have determined to destroy them in my furious anger . I have abandoned them because of all their wickedness , and I will not pity them when they cry for help .
TLB	Jeremiah	33	6	Nevertheless the time will come when I will heal Jerusalem ’ s damage and give her prosperity and peace .
TLB	Jeremiah	33	7	I will rebuild the cities of both Judah and Israel and restore their fortunes .
TLB	Jeremiah	33	8	And I will cleanse away all their sins against me and pardon them .
TLB	Jeremiah	33	9	Then this city will be an honor to me , and it will give me joy and be a source of praise and glory to me before all the nations of the earth ! The people of the world will see the good I do for my people and will tremble with awe ! 10-11 The Lord declares that the happy voices of bridegrooms and of brides and the joyous song of those bringing thanksgiving offerings to the Lord will be heard again in this doomed land . The people will sing : “ Praise the Lord ! For he is good and his mercy endures forever ! ” For I will make this land happier and more prosperous than it has ever been before .
TLB	Jeremiah	33	12	This land—though every man and animal and city is doomed—will once more see shepherds leading sheep and lambs .
TLB	Jeremiah	33	13	Once again their flocks will prosper in the mountain villages and in the cities east of the Philistine Plain , in all the cities of the Negeb , in the land of Benjamin , in the vicinity of Jerusalem , and in all the cities of Judah .
TLB	Jeremiah	33	14	Yes , the day will come , says the Lord , when I will do for Israel and Judah all the good I promised them .
TLB	Jeremiah	33	15	At that time I will bring to the throne the true Son of David , [ a ] and he shall rule justly .
TLB	Jeremiah	33	16	In that day the people of Judah and Jerusalem shall live in safety and their motto will be , “ The Lord is our righteousness ! ”
TLB	Jeremiah	33	17	For the Lord declares that from then on , David shall forever have an heir sitting on the throne of Israel .
TLB	Jeremiah	33	18	And there shall always be Levites to offer burnt offerings and meal offerings and sacrifices to the Lord .
TLB	Jeremiah	33	19	Then this message came to Jeremiah from the Lord : 20-21 If you can break my covenant with the day and with the night so that day and night don ’ t come on their usual schedule , only then will my covenant with David , my servant , be broken so that he shall not have a son to reign upon his throne ; and my covenant with the Levite priests , my ministers , is noncancelable .
TLB	Jeremiah	33	22	And as the stars can not be counted nor the sand upon the seashores measured , so the descendants of David my servant and the line of the Levites who minister to me will be multiplied .
TLB	Jeremiah	33	23	The Lord spoke to Jeremiah again and said :
TLB	Jeremiah	33	24	Have you heard what people are saying ? —that the Lord chose Judah and Israel and then abandoned them ! They are sneering and saying that Israel isn ’ t worthy to be counted as a nation . 25-26 But this is the Lord ’ s reply : I would no more reject my people than I would change my laws of night and day , of earth and sky . I will never abandon the Jews , or David my servant , or change the plan that his child will someday rule these descendants of Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob . Instead I will restore their prosperity and have mercy on them .

TLB	Jeremiah	34	34	This is the message that came to Jeremiah from the Lord when Nebuchadnezzar , king of Babylon , and all his armies from all the kingdoms he ruled , came and fought against Jerusalem and the cities of Judah :
TLB	Jeremiah	34	2	Go tell Zedekiah , king of Judah , that the Lord says this : I will give this city to the king of Babylon and he shall burn it .
TLB	Jeremiah	34	3	You shall not escape ; you shall be captured and taken before the king of Babylon ; he shall pronounce sentence against you and you shall be exiled to Babylon .
TLB	Jeremiah	34	4	But listen to this , O Zedekiah , king of Judah : God says you won ’ t be killed in war and carnage
TLB	Jeremiah	34	5	but that you will die quietly among your people , and they will burn incense in your memory , just as they did for your fathers . They will weep for you and say , “ Alas , our king is dead ! ” This I have decreed , says the Lord .
TLB	Jeremiah	34	6	So Jeremiah delivered the message to King Zedekiah .
TLB	Jeremiah	34	7	At this time the Babylonian army was besieging Jerusalem , Lachish , and Azekah—the only walled cities of Judah still standing .
TLB	Jeremiah	34	8	This is the message that came to Jeremiah from the Lord after King Zedekiah of Judah had freed all the slaves in Jerusalem—
TLB	Jeremiah	34	9	( for King Zedekiah had ordered everyone to free his Hebrew slaves , both men and women . He had said that no Jew should be the master of another Jew for all were brothers .
TLB	Jeremiah	34	10	The princes and all the people had obeyed the king ’ s command and freed their slaves , but the action was only temporary .
TLB	Jeremiah	34	11	They changed their minds and made their servants slaves again . [ a ]
TLB	Jeremiah	34	12	That is why the Lord gave the following message to Jerusalem . )
TLB	Jeremiah	34	13	The Lord , the God of Israel , says : I made a covenant with your fathers long ago when I brought them from their slavery in Egypt .
TLB	Jeremiah	34	14	I told them that every Hebrew slave must be freed after serving six years . But this was not done .
TLB	Jeremiah	34	15	Recently you began doing what was right , as I commanded you , and freed your slaves . You had solemnly promised me in my Temple that you would do it .
TLB	Jeremiah	34	16	But now you refuse and have defiled my name by shrugging off your oath and have made them slaves again .
TLB	Jeremiah	34	17	Therefore , says the Lord , because you will not listen to me and release them , I will release you to the power of death by war and famine and disease . And I will scatter you over all the world as exiles . 18-19 Because you have refused the terms of our contract , I will cut you apart just as you cut apart the calf when you walked between its halves to solemnize your vows . Yes , I will butcher you , whether you are princes , court officials , priests , or people—for you have broken your oath .
TLB	Jeremiah	34	20	I will give you to your enemies , and they shall kill you . I will feed your dead bodies to the vultures and wild animals .
TLB	Jeremiah	34	21	And I will surrender Zedekiah , king of Judah , and his officials to the army of the king of Babylon , though he has departed from the city for a little while .
TLB	Jeremiah	34	22	I will summon the Babylonian armies back again , and they will fight against it and capture this city and burn it . And I will see to it that the cities of Judah are completely destroyed and left desolate without a living soul . Footnotes - Jeremiah 34:11 They changed their minds and made their servants slaves again . When the siege was temporarily lifted ( 37:6-11 ) , they became bold and returned to their sins .

TLB	Jeremiah	35	35	This is the message the Lord gave Jeremiah when Jehoiakim ( son of Josiah ) was the king of Judah : [ a ]
TLB	Jeremiah	35	2	Go to the settlement where the families of the Rechabites live and invite them to the Temple . Take them into one of the inner rooms and offer them a drink of wine .
TLB	Jeremiah	35	3	So I went over to see Jaazaniah ( son of Jeremiah , who was the son of Habazziniah ) and brought him and all his brothers and sons—representing all the Rechab families—
TLB	Jeremiah	35	4	to the Temple , into the room assigned for the use of the sons of Hanan the prophet ( the son of Igdaliah ) . This room was located next to the one used by the palace official , directly above the room of Maaseiah ( son of Shallum ) , who was the Temple doorman .
TLB	Jeremiah	35	5	I set cups and jugs of wine before them and invited them to have a drink ,
TLB	Jeremiah	35	6	but they refused . “ No , ” they said . “ We don ’ t drink , for Jonadab our father ( son of Rechab ) commanded that none of us should ever drink , neither we nor our children forever .
TLB	Jeremiah	35	7	He also told us not to build houses or plant crops or vineyards and not to own farms , but always to live in tents ; and that if we obeyed , we would live long , good lives in our own land .
TLB	Jeremiah	35	8	And we have obeyed him in all these things . We have never had a drink of wine since then , nor have our wives or our sons or daughters either .
TLB	Jeremiah	35	9	We haven ’ t built houses or owned farms or planted crops .
TLB	Jeremiah	35	10	We have lived in tents and have fully obeyed everything that Jonadab our father commanded us .
TLB	Jeremiah	35	11	But when Nebuchadnezzar , king of Babylon , arrived in this country , we were afraid and decided to move to Jerusalem . That ’ s why we are here. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	35	12	Then the Lord gave this message to Jeremiah :
TLB	Jeremiah	35	13	The Lord , the God of Israel , says : Go and say to Judah and Jerusalem , Won ’ t you learn a lesson from the families of Rechab ?
TLB	Jeremiah	35	14	They don ’ t drink because their father told them not to . But I have spoken to you again and again , and you won ’ t listen or obey .
TLB	Jeremiah	35	15	I have sent you prophet after prophet to tell you to turn back from your wicked ways and to stop worshiping other gods , and that if you obeyed , then I would let you live in peace here in the land I gave to you and your fathers . But you wouldn ’ t listen or obey .
TLB	Jeremiah	35	16	The families of Rechab have obeyed their father completely , but you have refused to listen to me .
TLB	Jeremiah	35	17	Therefore , the Lord Almighty , the God of Israel , says : Because you refuse to listen or answer when I call , I will send upon Judah and Jerusalem all the evil I have ever threatened . 18-19 Then Jeremiah turned to the Rechabites and said : “ The Lord , the God of Israel , says that because you have obeyed your father in every respect , he shall always have descendants who will worship me. ” Footnotes - Jeremiah 35:1 when Jehoiakim . . . was the king of Judah .

TLB	Jeremiah	36	36	In the fourth year of the reign of King Jehoiakim [ a ] of Judah ( son of Josiah ) the Lord gave this message to Jeremiah :
TLB	Jeremiah	36	2	“ Get a scroll and write down all my messages against Israel , Judah , and the other nations . Begin with the first message back in the days of Josiah , and write down every one of them .
TLB	Jeremiah	36	3	Perhaps when the people of Judah see in writing all the terrible things I will do to them , they will repent . And then I can forgive them. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	36	4	So Jeremiah sent for Baruch ( son of Neriah ) , and as Jeremiah dictated , Baruch wrote down all the prophecies .
TLB	Jeremiah	36	5	When all was finished , Jeremiah said to Baruch , “ Since I am a prisoner here ,
TLB	Jeremiah	36	6	you read the scroll in the Temple on the next day of fasting , for on that day people will be there from all over Judah .
TLB	Jeremiah	36	7	Perhaps even yet they will turn from their evil ways and ask the Lord to forgive them before it is too late , even though these curses of God have been pronounced upon them. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	36	8	Baruch did as Jeremiah told him to and read all these messages to the people at the Temple .
TLB	Jeremiah	36	9	This occurred on the day of fasting held in December of the fifth year of the reign of King Jehoiakim ( son of Josiah ) . People came from all over Judah to attend the services at the Temple that day .
TLB	Jeremiah	36	10	Baruch went to the office of Gemariah the scribe ( son of Shaphan ) to read the scroll . ( This room was just off the upper assembly hall of the Temple , near the door of the New Gate . )
TLB	Jeremiah	36	11	When Micaiah ( son of Gemariah , son of Shaphan ) heard the messages from God ,
TLB	Jeremiah	36	12	he went down to the palace to the conference room where the administrative officials were meeting . Elishama ( the scribe ) was there , as well as Delaiah ( son of Shemaiah ) , Elnathan ( son of Achbor ) , Gemariah ( son of Shaphan ) , Zedekiah ( son of Hananiah ) , and all the others with similar responsibilities .
TLB	Jeremiah	36	13	When Micaiah told them about the messages Baruch was reading to the people , 14-15 the officials sent Jehudi ( son of Nethaniah , son of Shelemiah , son of Cushi ) to ask Baruch to come and read the messages to them too , and Baruch did .
TLB	Jeremiah	36	16	By the time he finished they were badly frightened . “ We must tell the king , ” they said .
TLB	Jeremiah	36	17	“ But first , tell us how you got these messages . Did Jeremiah himself dictate them to you ? ”
TLB	Jeremiah	36	18	So Baruch explained that Jeremiah had dictated them to him word by word , and he had written them down in ink upon the scroll .
TLB	Jeremiah	36	19	“ You and Jeremiah both hide , ” the officials said to Baruch . “ Don ’ t tell a soul where you are ! ”
TLB	Jeremiah	36	20	Then the officials hid the scroll in the room of Elishama the scribe and went to tell the king .
TLB	Jeremiah	36	21	The king sent Jehudi to get the scroll . Jehudi brought it from Elishama the scribe and read it to the king as all his officials stood by .
TLB	Jeremiah	36	22	The king was in a winterized part of the palace at the time , sitting in front of a fireplace , [ b ] for it was December and cold .
TLB	Jeremiah	36	23	And whenever Jehudi finished reading three or four columns , the king would take his knife , slit off the section , and throw it into the fire , until the whole scroll was destroyed . 24-25 And no one protested except Elnathan , Delaiah , and Gemariah . They pled with the king not to burn the scroll , but he wouldn ’ t listen to them . Not another of the king ’ s officials showed any signs of fear or anger at what he had done .
TLB	Jeremiah	36	26	Then the king commanded Jerahmeel ( a member of the royal family [ c ] ) and Seraiah ( son of Azriel ) and Shelemiah ( son of Abdeel ) to arrest Baruch and Jeremiah . But the Lord hid them !
TLB	Jeremiah	36	27	After the king had burned the scroll , the Lord said to Jeremiah :
TLB	Jeremiah	36	28	Get another scroll and write everything again just as you did before ,
TLB	Jeremiah	36	29	and say this to the king : “ This is what the Lord says ! You burned the scroll because it said the king of Babylon would destroy this country and everything in it .
TLB	Jeremiah	36	30	And now the Lord adds this concerning you , Jehoiakim , king of Judah : He shall have no one to sit upon the throne [ d ] of David . His dead body shall be thrown out to the hot sun and frosty nights ,
TLB	Jeremiah	36	31	and I will punish him and his family and his officials because of their sins . I will pour out upon them all the evil I promised—upon them and upon all the people of Judah and Jerusalem , for they wouldn ’ t listen to my warnings. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	36	32	Then Jeremiah took another scroll and dictated again to Baruch all he had written before , only this time the Lord added a lot more ! Footnotes - Jeremiah 36:1 In the fourth year of . . . King Jehoiakim . Probably in the summer of
TLB	Jeremiah	36	605	B.C. , shortly after Nebuchadnezzar ’ s victory over the Egyptian army at Carchemish . - Jeremiah 36:22 sitting in front of a fireplace , more literally , “ sitting in front of a large brazier in which a fire was burning. ” - Jeremiah 36:26 a member of the royal family , i.e. , “ a son of the king. ” - Jeremiah 36:30 He shall have no one to sit upon the throne . A three-month interregnum by his son Jehoiachin ( also called Coniah and Jeconiah ) evidently did not qualify as “ sitting on the throne ” under the meaning of permanence in the Hebrew expression used here .

TLB	Jeremiah	37	37	Nebuchadnezzar , king of Babylon , did not appoint Coniah ( King Jehoiakim ’ s son ) to be the new king of Judah . [ a ] Instead he chose Zedekiah ( son of Josiah ) .
TLB	Jeremiah	37	2	But neither King Zedekiah nor his officials nor the people who were left in the land listened to what the Lord said through Jeremiah .
TLB	Jeremiah	37	3	Nevertheless , King Zedekiah sent Jehucal ( son of Shelemiah ) and Zephaniah the priest ( son of Maaseiah ) to ask Jeremiah to pray for them .
TLB	Jeremiah	37	4	( Jeremiah had not been imprisoned yet , so he could come and go as he pleased . )
TLB	Jeremiah	37	5	When the army of Pharaoh Hophra of Egypt appeared at the southern border of Judah to relieve the besieged city of Jerusalem , the Babylonian army withdrew from Jerusalem to fight the Egyptians .
TLB	Jeremiah	37	6	Then the Lord sent this message to Jeremiah :
TLB	Jeremiah	37	7	“ The Lord , the God of Israel , says : Tell the king of Judah , who sent you to ask me what is going to happen , that Pharaoh ’ s army , though it came here to help you , is about to return in flight to Egypt ! The Babylonians shall defeat them and send them scurrying home .
TLB	Jeremiah	37	8	These Babylonians shall capture this city and burn it to the ground .
TLB	Jeremiah	37	9	Don ’ t fool yourselves that the Babylonians are gone for good . They aren ’ t !
TLB	Jeremiah	37	10	Even if you destroyed the entire Babylonian army until there was only a handful of survivors and they lay wounded in their tents , yet they would stagger out and defeat you and put this city to the torch ! ”
TLB	Jeremiah	37	11	When the Babylonian army set out from Jerusalem to engage Pharaoh ’ s army in battle ,
TLB	Jeremiah	37	12	Jeremiah started to leave the city to go to the land of Benjamin , to see the property he had bought . [ b ]
TLB	Jeremiah	37	13	But as he was walking through the Benjamin Gate , a sentry arrested him as a traitor , claiming he was defecting to the Babylonians . The guard making the arrest was Irijah ( son of Shelemiah , grandson of Hananiah ) .
TLB	Jeremiah	37	14	“ That ’ s not true , ” Jeremiah said . “ I have no intention whatever of doing any such thing ! ” But Irijah wouldn ’ t listen ; he took Jeremiah before the city officials . 15-16 They were incensed with Jeremiah and had him flogged and put into the dungeon under the house of Jonathan the scribe , which had been converted into a prison . Jeremiah was kept there for several days ,
TLB	Jeremiah	37	17	but eventually King Zedekiah sent for him to come to the palace secretly . The king asked him if there was any recent message from the Lord . “ Yes , ” said Jeremiah , “ there is ! You shall be defeated by the king of Babylon ! ”
TLB	Jeremiah	37	18	Then Jeremiah broached the subject of his imprisonment . “ What have I ever done to deserve this ? ” he asked the king . “ What crime have I committed ? Tell me what I have done against you or your officials or the people ?
TLB	Jeremiah	37	19	Where are those prophets now who told you that the king of Babylon would not come ?
TLB	Jeremiah	37	20	Listen , O my lord the king : I beg you , don ’ t send me back to that dungeon , for I ’ ll die there. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	37	21	Then King Zedekiah commanded that Jeremiah not be returned to the dungeon but be placed in the palace prison instead , and that he be given a small loaf of fresh bread every day as long as there was any left in the city . So Jeremiah was kept in the palace prison . [ c ] Footnotes - Jeremiah 37:1 to be the new king of Judah .

TLB	Jeremiah	38	38	But when Shephatiah ( son of Mattan ) and Gedaliah ( son of Pashhur ) and Jucal ( son of Shelemiah ) and Pashhur ( son of Malchiah ) heard what Jeremiah had been telling the people—
TLB	Jeremiah	38	2	that everyone remaining in Jerusalem would die by sword , starvation , or disease , but anyone surrendering to the Babylonians would live ,
TLB	Jeremiah	38	3	and that the city of Jerusalem would surely be captured by the king of Babylon—
TLB	Jeremiah	38	4	they went to the king and said : “ Sir , this fellow must die . That kind of talk will undermine the morale of the few soldiers we have left , and of all the people too . This man is a traitor. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	38	5	So King Zedekiah agreed . “ All right , ” he said . “ Do as you like—I can ’ t stop you. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	38	6	They took Jeremiah from his cell and lowered him by ropes into an empty cistern in the prison yard . ( It belonged to Malchiah , a member of the royal family . ) There was no water in it , but there was a thick layer of mire at the bottom , and Jeremiah sank down into it .
TLB	Jeremiah	38	7	When Ebed-melech the Ethiopian , an important palace official , heard that Jeremiah was in the cistern ,
TLB	Jeremiah	38	8	he rushed out to the Gate of Benjamin where the king was holding court .
TLB	Jeremiah	38	9	“ My lord the king , ” he said , “ these men have done a very evil thing in putting Jeremiah into the cistern . He will die of hunger , for almost all the bread in the city is gone. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	38	10	Then the king commanded Ebed-melech to take thirty men with him and pull Jeremiah out before he died .
TLB	Jeremiah	38	11	So Ebed-melech took thirty men and went to a palace depot for discarded supplies where used clothing was kept . There he found some old rags and discarded garments which he took to the cistern and lowered to Jeremiah on a rope .
TLB	Jeremiah	38	12	Ebed-melech called down to Jeremiah , “ Use these rags under your armpits to protect you from the ropes. ” Then , when Jeremiah was ready ,
TLB	Jeremiah	38	13	they pulled him out and returned him to the palace prison , where he remained .
TLB	Jeremiah	38	14	One day King Zedekiah sent for Jeremiah to meet him at the side entrance of the Temple . “ I want to ask you something , ” the king said , “ and don ’ t try to hide the truth. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	38	15	Jeremiah said , “ If I tell you the truth , you will kill me . And you won ’ t listen to me anyway. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	38	16	So King Zedekiah swore before Almighty God his Creator that he would not kill Jeremiah or give him to the men who were after his life .
TLB	Jeremiah	38	17	Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah , “ The Almighty Lord , the God of Israel , says : If you will surrender to Babylon , you and your family shall live and the city will not be burned .
TLB	Jeremiah	38	18	If you refuse to surrender , this city shall be set afire by the Babylonian army and you will not escape. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	38	19	“ But I am afraid to surrender , ” the king said , “ for the Babylonians will hand me over to the Jews who have defected to them , and who knows what they will do to me ? ”
TLB	Jeremiah	38	20	Jeremiah replied , “ You won ’ t get into their hands if only you will obey the Lord ; your life will be spared , and all will go well for you . 21-22 But if you refuse to surrender , the Lord has said that all the women left in your palace will be brought out and given to the officers of the Babylonian army ; and these women will taunt you with bitterness . ‘ Fine friends you have , ’ they ’ ll say , ‘ those Egyptians . They have betrayed you and left you to your fate ! ’
TLB	Jeremiah	38	23	All your wives and children will be led out to the Babylonians , and you will not escape . You will be seized by the king of Babylon , and this city will be burned. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	38	24	Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah , “ On pain of death , don ’ t tell anyone you told me this !
TLB	Jeremiah	38	25	And if my officials hear that I talked with you and they threaten you with death unless you tell them what we discussed ,
TLB	Jeremiah	38	26	just say that you begged me not to send you back to the dungeon in Jonathan ’ s house , for you would die there. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	38	27	And sure enough , it wasn ’ t long before all the city officials came to Jeremiah and asked him why the king had called for him . So he said what the king had told him to , and they left without finding out the truth , for the conversation had not been overheard by anyone .
TLB	Jeremiah	38	28	And Jeremiah remained confined to the prison yard until the day Jerusalem was captured . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Jeremiah	39	39	It was in January of the ninth year of the reign of King Zedekiah of Judah that King Nebuchadnezzar and all his army came against Jerusalem again and besieged it .
TLB	Jeremiah	39	2	Two years later , in the month of July , they breached the wall , and the city fell ,
TLB	Jeremiah	39	3	and all the officers of the Babylonian army came in and sat in triumph at the middle gate . Nergal-sharezer was there , Samgar-nebo , Sarsechim , Nergal-sharezer the king ’ s chief assistant , and many others .
TLB	Jeremiah	39	4	When King Zedekiah and his soldiers realized that the city was lost , they fled during the night , going out through the gate between the two walls back of the palace garden and across the fields toward the Jordan Valley .
TLB	Jeremiah	39	5	But the Babylonians chased the king and caught him on the plains of Jericho and brought him to Nebuchadnezzar , king of Babylon , who was at Riblah in the land of Hamath , where he pronounced judgment upon him .
TLB	Jeremiah	39	6	The king of Babylon made Zedekiah watch as they killed his children and all the nobles of Judah .
TLB	Jeremiah	39	7	Then he gouged out Zedekiah ’ s eyes and bound him in chains to send him away to Babylon as a slave .
TLB	Jeremiah	39	8	Meanwhile the army burned Jerusalem , including the palace , and tore down the walls of the city .
TLB	Jeremiah	39	9	Then Nebuzaradan , the captain of the guard , and his men sent the remnant of the population and all those who had defected to him to Babylon .
TLB	Jeremiah	39	10	But throughout the land of Judah he left a few people , the very poor , and gave them fields and vineyards . 11-12 Meanwhile King Nebuchadnezzar had told Nebuzaradan to find Jeremiah . “ See that he isn ’ t hurt , ” he said . “ Look after him well and give him anything he wants. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	39	13	So Nebuzaradan , the captain of the guard , and Nebushazban , the chief of the eunuchs , and Nergal-sharezer , the king ’ s advisor , and all the officials took steps to do as the king had commanded .
TLB	Jeremiah	39	14	They sent soldiers to bring Jeremiah out of the prison , and put him into the care of Gedaliah ( son of Ahikam , son of Shaphan ) , to take him back to his home . And Jeremiah lived there among his people who were left in the land .
TLB	Jeremiah	39	15	The Lord gave the following message to Jeremiah before the Babylonians arrived , while he was still in prison :
TLB	Jeremiah	39	16	“ Send this word to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian : The Lord , the God of Israel , says : I will do to this city everything I threatened ; I will destroy it before your eyes ,
TLB	Jeremiah	39	17	but I will deliver you . You shall not be killed by those you fear so much .
TLB	Jeremiah	39	18	As a reward for trusting me , I will preserve your life and keep you safe. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Jeremiah	40	40	Nebuzaradan , captain of the guard , took Jeremiah to Ramah along with all the exiled people of Jerusalem and Judah who were being sent to Babylon , but then released him . 2-3 The captain called for Jeremiah and said , “ The Lord your God has brought this disaster on this land , just as he said he would . For these people have sinned against the Lord . That is why it happened .
TLB	Jeremiah	40	4	Now I am going to take off your chains and let you go . If you want to come with me to Babylon , fine ; I will see that you are well cared for . But if you don ’ t want to come , don ’ t . The world is before you—go where you like .
TLB	Jeremiah	40	5	If you decide to stay , then return to Gedaliah , who has been appointed as governor of Judah by the king of Babylon , and stay with the remnant he rules . But it ’ s up to you ; go where you like. ” Then Nebuzaradan gave Jeremiah some food and money and let him go .
TLB	Jeremiah	40	6	So Jeremiah returned to Gedaliah and lived in Judah with the people left in the land .
TLB	Jeremiah	40	7	Now when the leaders of the Jewish guerrilla bands in the countryside heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah as governor over the poor of the land who were left behind , and had not exiled everyone to Babylon ,
TLB	Jeremiah	40	8	they came to see Gedaliah at Mizpah , where his headquarters were . These are the names of the leaders who came : Ishmael ( son of Nethaniah ) , Johanan and Jonathan ( sons of Kareah ) , Seraiah ( son of Tanhumeth ) , the sons of Ephai ( the Netophathite ) , Jezaniah ( son of a Maacathite ) , and their men .
TLB	Jeremiah	40	9	And Gedaliah assured them that it would be safe to surrender to the Babylonians . “ Stay here and serve the king of Babylon , ” he said , “ and all will go well for you .
TLB	Jeremiah	40	10	As for me , I will stay at Mizpah and intercede for you with the Babylonians who will come here to oversee my administration . Settle in any city you wish and live off the land . Harvest the grapes and summer fruits and olives and store them away. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	40	11	When the Jews in Moab and among the Ammonites and in Edom and the other nearby countries heard that a few people were still left in Judah , and that the king of Babylon had not taken them all away , and that Gedaliah was the governor ,
TLB	Jeremiah	40	12	they all began to return to Judah from the many places to which they had fled . They stopped at Mizpah to discuss their plans with Gedaliah and then went out to the deserted farms and gathered a great harvest of wine grapes and other crops . 13-14 But soon afterwards Johanan ( son of Kareah ) and the other guerrilla leaders came to Mizpah to warn Gedaliah that Baalis , king of the Ammonites , had sent Ishmael ( son of Nethaniah ) to assassinate him . But Gedaliah wouldn ’ t believe them .
TLB	Jeremiah	40	15	Then Johanan had a private conference with Gedaliah . Johanan volunteered to kill Ishmael secretly . “ Why should we let him come and murder you ? ” Johanan asked . “ What will happen then to the Jews who have returned ? Why should this remnant be scattered and lost ? ”
TLB	Jeremiah	40	16	But Gedaliah said , “ I forbid you to do any such thing , for you are lying about Ishmael. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Jeremiah	41	41	But in October , Ishmael ( son of Nethaniah , son of Elishama ) , who was a member of the royal family and one of the king ’ s top officials , arrived in Mizpah , accompanied by ten men . Gedaliah invited them to dinner .
TLB	Jeremiah	41	2	While they were eating , Ishmael and the ten men in league with him suddenly jumped up , pulled out their swords , and killed Gedaliah .
TLB	Jeremiah	41	3	Then they went out and slaughtered all the Jewish officials and Babylonian soldiers who were in Mizpah with Gedaliah .
TLB	Jeremiah	41	4	The next day , before the outside world knew what had happened ,
TLB	Jeremiah	41	5	eighty men approached Mizpah from Shechem , Shiloh , and Samaria , to worship at the Temple of the Lord . They had shaved off their beards , torn their clothes , and cut themselves , and were bringing offerings and incense .
TLB	Jeremiah	41	6	Ishmael went out from the city to meet them , crying as he went . When he faced them he said , “ Oh , come and see what has happened to Gedaliah ! ”
TLB	Jeremiah	41	7	Then , when they were all inside the city , Ishmael and his men killed all but ten of them and threw their bodies into a cistern .
TLB	Jeremiah	41	8	The ten had talked Ishmael into letting them go by promising to bring him their treasures of wheat , barley , oil , and honey they had hidden away .
TLB	Jeremiah	41	9	The cistern where Ishmael dumped the bodies of the men he murdered was the large one constructed by King Asa when he fortified Mizpah to protect himself against Baasha , king of Israel . [ a ]
TLB	Jeremiah	41	10	Ishmael made captives of the king ’ s daughters and of the people who had been left under Gedaliah ’ s care in Mizpah by Nebuzaradan , captain of the guard . Soon after , he took them with him when he headed toward the country of the Ammonites .
TLB	Jeremiah	41	11	But when Johanan ( son of Kareah ) and the rest of the guerrilla leaders heard what Ishmael had done ,
TLB	Jeremiah	41	12	they took all their men and set out to stop him . They caught up with him at the pool near Gibeon . 13-14 The people with Ishmael shouted for joy when they saw Johanan and his men and ran to meet them .
TLB	Jeremiah	41	15	Meanwhile Ishmael escaped with eight of his men into the land of the Ammonites . 16-17 Then Johanan and his men went to the village of Geruth Chimham , near Bethlehem , taking with them all those they had rescued—soldiers , women , children , and eunuchs , to prepare to leave for Egypt .
TLB	Jeremiah	41	18	For they were afraid of what the Babylonians would do when the news reached them that Ishmael had killed Gedaliah the governor , for he had been chosen and appointed by the Babylonian emperor .

TLB	Jeremiah	42	42	Then Johanan and the army captains and all the people , great and small , came to Jeremiah
TLB	Jeremiah	42	2	and said , “ Please pray for us to the Lord your God , for as you know so well , we are only a tiny remnant of what we were before .
TLB	Jeremiah	42	3	Beg the Lord your God to show us what to do and where to go. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	42	4	“ All right , ” Jeremiah replied . “ I will ask him and I will tell you what he says . I will hide nothing from you. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	42	5	Then they said to Jeremiah , “ May the curse of God be on us if we refuse to obey whatever he says we should do !
TLB	Jeremiah	42	6	Whether we like it or not , we will obey the Lord our God , to whom we send you with our plea . For if we obey him , everything will turn out well for us. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	42	7	Ten days later the Lord gave his reply to Jeremiah .
TLB	Jeremiah	42	8	So he called for Johanan and the captains of his forces , and for all the people , great and small ,
TLB	Jeremiah	42	9	and said to them : “ You sent me to the Lord , the God of Israel , with your request , and this is his reply :
TLB	Jeremiah	42	10	“ Stay here in this land . If you do , I will bless you , and no one will harm you . For I am sorry for all the punishment I have had to give to you .
TLB	Jeremiah	42	11	Don ’ t fear the king of Babylon anymore , for I am with you to save you and to deliver you from his hand .
TLB	Jeremiah	42	12	And I will be merciful to you by making him kind so that he will not kill you or make slaves of you but will let you stay here in your land . 13-14 “ But if you refuse to obey the Lord and say , ‘ We will not stay here , ’ —and insist on going to Egypt where you think you will be free from war and hunger and alarms ,
TLB	Jeremiah	42	15	then this is what the Lord replies , O remnant of Judah : The Lord Almighty , the God of Israel , says : If you insist on going to Egypt ,
TLB	Jeremiah	42	16	the war and famine you fear will follow close behind you , and you will perish there .
TLB	Jeremiah	42	17	That is the fate awaiting every one of you who insists on going to live in Egypt . Yes , you will die from sword , famine , and disease . None of you will escape from the evil I will bring upon you there .
TLB	Jeremiah	42	18	“ For the Lord , the God of Israel , says : Just as my anger and fury were poured out upon the people of Jerusalem , so it will be poured out on you when you enter Egypt . You will be received with disgust and with hatred—you will be cursed and reviled . And you will never again see your own land .
TLB	Jeremiah	42	19	For the Lord has said : O remnant of Judah , do not go to Egypt ! ” Jeremiah concluded : “ Never forget the warning I have given you today .
TLB	Jeremiah	42	20	If you go , it will be at the cost of your lives . For you were deceitful when you sent me to pray for you and said , ‘ Just tell us what God says and we will do it ! ’
TLB	Jeremiah	42	21	And today I have told you exactly what he said , but you will not obey any more now than you did the other times .
TLB	Jeremiah	42	22	Therefore know for a certainty that you will die by sword , famine , and disease in Egypt , where you insist on going. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Jeremiah	43	43	When Jeremiah had finished giving this message from God to all the people , 2-3 Azariah ( son of Hoshaiah ) and Johanan ( son of Kareah ) and all the other proud men said to Jeremiah , “ You lie ! The Lord our God hasn ’ t told you to tell us not to go to Egypt ! Baruch ( son of Neriah ) has plotted against us and told you to say this so that we will stay here and be killed by the Babylonians or carried off to Babylon as slaves. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	43	4	So Johanan and all the guerrilla leaders and all the people refused to obey the Lord and stay in Judah .
TLB	Jeremiah	43	5	All of them , including all those who had returned from the nearby countries where they had fled , now started off for Egypt with Johanan and the other captains in command .
TLB	Jeremiah	43	6	In the crowd were men , women , and children , the king ’ s daughters , and all those whom Nebuzaradan , the captain of the guard , had left with Gedaliah . They even forced Jeremiah and Baruch to go with them too .
TLB	Jeremiah	43	7	And so they arrived in Egypt at the city of Tahpanhes , for they would not obey the Lord .
TLB	Jeremiah	43	8	Then at Tahpanhes , the Lord spoke to Jeremiah again and said :
TLB	Jeremiah	43	9	“ Call together the men of Judah and , as they watch you , bury large rocks between the pavement stones at the entrance of Pharaoh ’ s palace here in Tahpanhes ,
TLB	Jeremiah	43	10	and tell the men of Judah this : The Lord Almighty , the God of Israel , says : I will surely bring Nebuchadnezzar , king of Babylon , here to Egypt , for he is my servant . I will set his throne upon these stones that I have hidden . He shall spread his royal canopy over them .
TLB	Jeremiah	43	11	And when he comes , he shall destroy the land of Egypt , killing all those I want killed and capturing those I want captured , and many shall die of plague .
TLB	Jeremiah	43	12	He will set fire to the temples of the gods of Egypt and burn the idols and carry off the people as his captives . And he shall plunder the land of Egypt as a shepherd picks fleas from his cloak ! And he himself shall leave unharmed .
TLB	Jeremiah	43	13	And he shall break down the obelisks standing in the city of Heliopolis and burn down the temples of the gods of Egypt. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Jeremiah	44	44	This is the message God gave to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews who were living in the north of Egypt in the cities of Migdol , Tahpanhes , and Memphis , and throughout southern Egypt as well : 2-3 The Lord Almighty , the God of Israel , says : You saw what I did to Jerusalem and to all the cities of Judah . Because of all their wickedness they lie in heaps and ashes , without a living soul . For my anger rose high against them for worshiping other gods— “ gods ” that neither they nor you nor any of your fathers have ever known .
TLB	Jeremiah	44	4	I sent my servants , the prophets , to protest over and over again and to plead with them not to do this horrible thing I hate ,
TLB	Jeremiah	44	5	but they wouldn ’ t listen and wouldn ’ t turn back from their wicked ways ; they have kept right on with their sacrifices to these “ gods. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	44	6	And so my fury and anger boiled over and fell as fire upon the cities of Judah and into the streets of Jerusalem , and there is desolation until this day .
TLB	Jeremiah	44	7	And now the Lord , the Lord Almighty , the God of Israel , asks you : Why are you destroying yourselves ? For not one of you shall live—not a man , woman , or child among you who has come here from Judah , not even the babies in arms .
TLB	Jeremiah	44	8	For you are rousing my anger with the idols you have made and worshiped here in Egypt , burning incense to them , and causing me to destroy you completely and to make you a curse and a stench in the nostrils of all the nations of the earth .
TLB	Jeremiah	44	9	Have you forgotten the sins of your fathers , the sins of the kings and queens of Judah , your own sins , and the sins of your wives in Judah and Jerusalem ?
TLB	Jeremiah	44	10	And even until this very hour there has been no apology ; no one has wanted to return to me or follow the laws I gave you and your fathers before you .
TLB	Jeremiah	44	11	Therefore the Lord , the God of Israel , says : There is fury in my face and I will destroy every one of you !
TLB	Jeremiah	44	12	I will take this remnant of Judah that insisted on coming here to Egypt , and I will consume them . They shall fall here in Egypt , killed by famine and sword ; all shall die , from the least important to the greatest . They shall be despised and loathed , cursed and hated .
TLB	Jeremiah	44	13	I will punish them in Egypt just as I punished them in Jerusalem , by sword , famine , and disease .
TLB	Jeremiah	44	14	Not one of them shall escape from my wrath except those who repent of their coming and escape from the others by returning again to their own land .
TLB	Jeremiah	44	15	Then all the women present and all the men who knew that their wives had burned incense to idols ( it was a great crowd of all the Jews in southern Egypt ) answered Jeremiah :
TLB	Jeremiah	44	16	“ We will not listen to your false ‘ Messages from God ’ !
TLB	Jeremiah	44	17	We will do whatever we want to . We will burn incense to the Queen of Heaven [ a ] and sacrifice to her just as much as we like—just as we and our fathers before us , and our kings and princes have always done in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem ; for in those days we had plenty to eat , and we were well off and happy !
TLB	Jeremiah	44	18	But ever since we quit burning incense to the Queen of Heaven and stopped worshiping her , we have been in great trouble and have been destroyed by sword and famine. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	44	19	“ And , ” the women added , “ do you suppose that we were worshiping the Queen of Heaven and pouring out our libations to her and making cakes for her with her image on them , without our husbands knowing it and helping us ? Of course not ! ”
TLB	Jeremiah	44	20	Then Jeremiah said to all of them , men and women alike , who had given him that answer :
TLB	Jeremiah	44	21	“ Do you think the Lord didn ’ t know that you and your fathers , your kings and princes , and all the people were burning incense to idols in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem ?
TLB	Jeremiah	44	22	It was because he could no longer bear all the evil things you were doing that he made your land desolate , an incredible ruin , cursed , without an inhabitant , as it is today .
TLB	Jeremiah	44	23	The very reason all these terrible things have befallen you is because you have burned incense and sinned against the Lord and refused to obey him. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	44	24	Then Jeremiah said to them all , including the women : “ Listen to the word of the Lord , all you citizens of Judah who are here in Egypt !
TLB	Jeremiah	44	25	The Lord , the God of Israel , says : Both you and your wives have said that you will never give up your devotion and sacrifices to the Queen of Heaven , and you have proved it by your actions . Then go ahead and carry out your promises and vows to her !
TLB	Jeremiah	44	26	But listen to the word of the Lord , all you Jews who are living in the land of Egypt : I have sworn by my great name , says the Lord , that it will do you no good to seek my help and blessing anymore , saying , ‘ O Lord our God , help us ! ’
TLB	Jeremiah	44	27	For I will watch over you , but not for good ! I will see to it that evil befalls you , and you shall be destroyed by war and famine until all of you are dead .
TLB	Jeremiah	44	28	“ Only those who return to Judah ( it will be but a tiny remnant ) shall escape my wrath , but all who refuse to go back—who insist on living in Egypt—shall find out who tells the truth , I or they !
TLB	Jeremiah	44	29	And this is the proof I give you that all I have threatened will happen to you and that I will punish you here :
TLB	Jeremiah	44	30	I will turn Pharaoh Hophra , [ b ] king of Egypt , over to those who seek his life , just as I turned Zedekiah , king of Judah , over to Nebuchadnezzar , king of Babylon. ” Footnotes - Jeremiah 44:17 Queen of Heaven , see note to 7:18 . - Jeremiah 44:30 Pharaoh Hophra . Hophra , or Apries , ruled Egypt from 588–568 B.C . over to those . Pharaoh Hophra was killed by Amasis , one of his generals who had revolted and who was then crowned in his place .

TLB	Jeremiah	45	45	This is the message [ a ] Jeremiah gave to Baruch in the fourth year of the reign of King Jehoiakim ( son of Josiah ) , after Baruch had written down all God ’ s messages as Jeremiah was dictating them to him :
TLB	Jeremiah	45	2	O Baruch , the Lord God of Israel says this to you :
TLB	Jeremiah	45	3	You have said , Woe is me ! Don ’ t I have troubles enough already ? And now the Lord has added more ! I am weary of my own sighing and I find no rest .
TLB	Jeremiah	45	4	But tell Baruch this , The Lord says : I will destroy this nation that I built ; I will wipe out what I established .
TLB	Jeremiah	45	5	Are you seeking great things for yourself ? Don ’ t do it ! For though I will bring great evil upon all these people , I will protect you wherever you go , as your reward . Footnotes - Jeremiah 45:1 This is the message . This message , in point of time , follows ch .

TLB	Jeremiah	46	46	Here are the messages given to Jeremiah concerning foreign nations : The Egyptians
TLB	Jeremiah	46	2	This message was given against Egypt at the occasion of the battle of Carchemish when Pharaoh Neco , king of Egypt , and his army were defeated beside the Euphrates River by Nebuchadnezzar , king of Babylon , in the fourth year of the reign of Jehoiakim ( son of Josiah ) , king of Judah :
TLB	Jeremiah	46	3	Buckle on your armor , you Egyptians , and advance to battle !
TLB	Jeremiah	46	4	Harness the horses and prepare to mount them—don your helmets , sharpen your spears , put on your armor .
TLB	Jeremiah	46	5	But look ! The Egyptian army flees in terror ; the mightiest of its soldiers run without a backward glance . Yes , terror shall surround them on every side , says the Lord .
TLB	Jeremiah	46	6	The swift will not escape , nor the mightiest of warriors . In the north , by the river Euphrates , they have stumbled and fallen .
TLB	Jeremiah	46	7	What is this mighty army , rising like the Nile at flood time , overflowing all the land ?
TLB	Jeremiah	46	8	It is the Egyptian army , boasting that it will cover the earth like a flood , destroying every foe .
TLB	Jeremiah	46	9	Then come , O horses and chariots and mighty soldiers of Egypt ! Come , all of you from Cush and Put and Lud who handle the shield and bend the bow !
TLB	Jeremiah	46	10	For this is the day of the Lord , the Lord Almighty , a day of vengeance upon his enemies . The sword shall devour until it is sated , yes , drunk with your blood , for the Lord , the Lord Almighty will receive a sacrifice today in the north country beside the river Euphrates !
TLB	Jeremiah	46	11	Go up to Gilead for medicine , O virgin daughter of Egypt ! Yet there is no cure for your wounds . Though you have used many medicines , there is no healing for you .
TLB	Jeremiah	46	12	The nations have heard of your shame . The earth is filled with your cry of despair and defeat ; your mightiest soldiers will stumble across each other and fall together .
TLB	Jeremiah	46	13	Then God gave Jeremiah this message concerning the coming of Nebuchadnezzar , king of Babylon , to attack Egypt :
TLB	Jeremiah	46	14	Shout it out in Egypt ; publish it in the cities of Migdol , Memphis , and Tahpanhes ! Mobilize for battle , for the sword of destruction shall devour all around you .
TLB	Jeremiah	46	15	Why has Apis , your bull god , fled in terror ? Because the Lord knocked him down before your enemies .
TLB	Jeremiah	46	16	Vast multitudes fall in heaps . ( Then the remnant of the Jews will say , “ Come , let us return again to Judah where we were born and get away from all this slaughter here ! ” )
TLB	Jeremiah	46	17	Rename Pharaoh Hophra and call him “ The Man with No Power but with Plenty of Noise ! ”
TLB	Jeremiah	46	18	As I live , says the King , the Lord of Hosts , one is coming against Egypt who is as tall as Mount Tabor or Mount Carmel by the sea !
TLB	Jeremiah	46	19	Pack up ; get ready to leave for exile , you citizens of Egypt , for the city of Memphis shall be utterly destroyed and left without a soul alive . 20-21 Egypt is sleek as a heifer , but a gadfly sends her running—a gadfly from the north ! Even her famed mercenaries have become like frightened calves . They turn and run , for it is the day of great calamity for Egypt , a time of great punishment . 22-23 Silent as a serpent gliding away , Egypt flees ; the invading army marches in . The numberless soldiers cut down your people like woodsmen who clear a forest of its trees .
TLB	Jeremiah	46	24	Egypt is as helpless as a girl before these men from the north .
TLB	Jeremiah	46	25	The Lord , the God of Israel , says : I will punish Amon , god of Thebes , and all the other gods of Egypt . I will punish Pharaoh too , and all who trust in him .
TLB	Jeremiah	46	26	I will deliver them into the hands of those who want them killed—into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar , king of Babylon , and his army . But afterwards the land shall recover from the ravages of war .
TLB	Jeremiah	46	27	But don ’ t you be afraid , O my people who return to your own land , don ’ t be dismayed ; for I will save you from far away and bring your children from a distant land . Yes , Israel shall return and be at rest , and nothing shall make her afraid .
TLB	Jeremiah	46	28	Fear not , O Jacob , my servant , says the Lord , for I am with you . I will destroy all the nations to which I have exiled you , but I will not destroy you . I will punish you , but only enough to correct you . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Jeremiah	47	47	The Philistines This is God ’ s message to Jeremiah concerning the Philistines of Gaza , before the city was captured [ a ] by the Egyptian army :
TLB	Jeremiah	47	2	The Lord says : A flood is coming from the north to overflow the land of the Philistines ; it will destroy their cities and everything in them . Strong men will scream in terror , and all the land will weep .
TLB	Jeremiah	47	3	Hear the clattering hoofs and rumbling wheels as the chariots go rushing by ; fathers flee without a backward glance at their helpless children ,
TLB	Jeremiah	47	4	for the time has come when all the Philistines and their allies from Tyre and Sidon will be destroyed . For the Lord is destroying the Philistines , those colonists from Caphtor .
TLB	Jeremiah	47	5	The cities of Gaza and Ashkelon will be razed to the ground and lie in ruins . O descendants of the Anakim , how you will lament and mourn !
TLB	Jeremiah	47	6	O sword of the Lord , when will you be at rest again ? Go back into your scabbard ; rest and be still !
TLB	Jeremiah	47	7	But how can it be still when the Lord has sent it on an errand ? For the city of Ashkelon and those living along the sea must be destroyed . Footnotes - Jeremiah 47:1 before the city was captured . In

TLB	Jeremiah	48	48	The Moabites This is the message of the Lord of Hosts , the God of Israel , against Moab : Woe to the city of Nebo , for it shall lie in ruins . The city of Kiriathaim and its forts are overwhelmed and captured . 2-4 No one will ever brag about Moab anymore , for there is a plot against her life . In Heshbon plans have been completed to destroy her . “ Come , ” they say , “ we will cut her off from being a nation. ” In Madmen all is silent . And then the roar of battle will surge against Horonaim , for all Moab is being destroyed . Her crying will be heard as far away as Zoar .
TLB	Jeremiah	48	5	Her refugees will climb the hills of Luhith , weeping bitterly , while cries of terror rise from the city below .
TLB	Jeremiah	48	6	Flee for your lives ; hide in the wilderness !
TLB	Jeremiah	48	7	For you trusted in your wealth and skill ; therefore , you shall perish . Your god Chemosh , with his priests and princes , shall be taken away to distant lands !
TLB	Jeremiah	48	8	All the villages and cities , whether they be on the plateaus or in the valleys , shall be destroyed , for the Lord has said it .
TLB	Jeremiah	48	9	Oh , for wings for Moab that she could fly away , for her cities shall be left without a living soul .
TLB	Jeremiah	48	10	Cursed be those withholding their swords from your blood , refusing to do the work that God has given them !
TLB	Jeremiah	48	11	From her earliest history Moab has lived there undisturbed from all invasions . She is like wine that has not been poured from flask to flask and is fragrant and smooth . But now she shall have the pouring out of exile !
TLB	Jeremiah	48	12	The time is coming soon , the Lord has said , when he will send troublemakers to spill her out from jar to jar and then shatter the jars !
TLB	Jeremiah	48	13	Then at last Moab shall be ashamed of her idol Chemosh , as Israel was of her calf idol at Bethel .
TLB	Jeremiah	48	14	Do you remember that boast of yours : “ We are heroes , mighty men of war ” ?
TLB	Jeremiah	48	15	But now Moab is to be destroyed ; her destroyer is on the way ; her choicest youth are doomed to slaughter , says the King , the Lord Almighty .
TLB	Jeremiah	48	16	Calamity is coming fast to Moab .
TLB	Jeremiah	48	17	O friends of Moab , weep for her and cry ! See how the strong , the beautiful is shattered !
TLB	Jeremiah	48	18	Come down from your glory and sit in the dust , O people of Dibon , for those destroying Moab shall shatter Dibon too , and tear down all her towers .
TLB	Jeremiah	48	19	Those in Aroer stand anxiously beside the road to watch , and shout to those who flee from Moab , “ What has happened there ? ”
TLB	Jeremiah	48	20	And they reply , “ Moab lies in ruins ; weep and wail . Tell it by the banks of the Arnon , that Moab is destroyed. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	48	21	All the cities of the tableland lie in ruins too , for God ’ s judgment has been poured out upon them all—on Holon and Jahzah and Mephaath ,
TLB	Jeremiah	48	22	and Dibon and Nebo and Beth-diblathaim ,
TLB	Jeremiah	48	23	and Kiriathaim and Beth-gamul and Beth-meon ,
TLB	Jeremiah	48	24	and Kerioth and Bozrah—and all the cities of the land of Moab , far and near .
TLB	Jeremiah	48	25	The strength of Moab is ended—her horns are cut off ; her arms are broken .
TLB	Jeremiah	48	26	Let her stagger and fall like a drunkard , for she has rebelled against the Lord . Moab shall wallow in her vomit , scorned by all .
TLB	Jeremiah	48	27	For you scorned Israel and robbed her and were happy at her fall .
TLB	Jeremiah	48	28	O people of Moab , flee from your cities and live in the caves like doves that nest in the clefts of the rocks .
TLB	Jeremiah	48	29	We have all heard of the pride of Moab , for it is very great . We know your loftiness , your arrogance , and your haughty heart .
TLB	Jeremiah	48	30	I know her insolence , the Lord has said , but her boasts are false—her helplessness is great .
TLB	Jeremiah	48	31	Yes , I wail for Moab , my heart is broken for the men of Kir-heres .
TLB	Jeremiah	48	32	O men of Sibmah , rich in vineyards , I weep for you even more than for Jazer . For the destroyer has cut off your spreading tendrils and harvested your grapes and summer fruits . He has plucked you bare !
TLB	Jeremiah	48	33	Joy and gladness are gone from fruitful Moab . The presses yield no wine ; no one treads the grapes with shouts of joy . There is shouting , yes , but not the shouting of joy .
TLB	Jeremiah	48	34	Instead the awful cries of terror and pain rise from all over the land—from Heshbon clear across to Elealeh and to Jahaz ; from Zoar to Horonaim and to Eglath-shelishiyah . The pastures of Nimrim are deserted now .
TLB	Jeremiah	48	35	For the Lord says : I have put a stop to Moab ’ s worshiping false gods and burning incense to idols .
TLB	Jeremiah	48	36	Sadly sings my heart for Moab and Kir-heres , for all their wealth has disappeared .
TLB	Jeremiah	48	37	They shave their heads and beards in anguish ; they slash their hands and put on clothes of sackcloth .
TLB	Jeremiah	48	38	Crying and sorrow will be in every Moabite home and on the streets ; for I have smashed and shattered Moab like an old , unwanted bottle .
TLB	Jeremiah	48	39	How it is broken ! Hear the wails ! See the shame of Moab ! For she is a sign of horror and of scoffing to her neighbors now .
TLB	Jeremiah	48	40	A vulture circles ominously above the land of Moab , says the Lord .
TLB	Jeremiah	48	41	Her cities are fallen ; her strongholds are seized . The hearts of her mightiest warriors fail with fear like women in the pains of giving birth .
TLB	Jeremiah	48	42	Moab shall no longer be a nation , for she has boasted against the Lord .
TLB	Jeremiah	48	43	Fear and traps and treachery shall be your lot , O Moab , says the Lord .
TLB	Jeremiah	48	44	He who flees shall fall in a trap , and he who escapes from the trap shall run into a snare . I will see to it that you do not get away , for the time of your judgment has come .
TLB	Jeremiah	48	45	They flee to Heshbon , unable to go farther . But a fire comes from Heshbon—Sihon ’ s ancestral home—and devours the land from end to end with all its rebellious people .
TLB	Jeremiah	48	46	Woe to you , O Moab ; the people of the god Chemosh are destroyed , and your sons and daughters are taken away as slaves .
TLB	Jeremiah	48	47	But in the latter days , says the Lord , I will reestablish Moab . ( Here the prophecy concerning Moab ends . ) The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Jeremiah	49	49	The Ammonites What is this you are doing ? Why are you living in the cities of the Jews ? Aren ’ t there Jews enough to fill them up ? Didn ’ t they inherit them from me ? Why then have you , who worship Milcom , taken over Gad and all its cities ?
TLB	Jeremiah	49	2	I will punish you for this , the Lord declares , by destroying your city of Rabbah . It shall become a desolate heap , and the neighboring towns shall be burned . Then Israel shall come and take back her land from you again . She shall dispossess those who dispossessed her , says the Lord .
TLB	Jeremiah	49	3	Cry out , O Heshbon , for Ai is destroyed ! Weep , daughter of Rabbah ! Put on garments of mourning ; weep and wail , hiding in the hedges , for your god Milcom shall be exiled along with his princes and priests .
TLB	Jeremiah	49	4	You are proud of your fertile valleys , but they will soon be ruined . O wicked daughter , you trusted in your wealth and thought no one could ever harm you .
TLB	Jeremiah	49	5	But see , I will bring terror upon you , says the Lord , the Lord Almighty . For all your neighbors shall drive you from your land and none shall help your exiles as they flee .
TLB	Jeremiah	49	6	But afterward I will restore the fortunes of the Ammonites , says the Lord . The Edomites
TLB	Jeremiah	49	7	The Lord says : Where are all your wise men of days gone by ? Is there not one left in all of Teman ?
TLB	Jeremiah	49	8	Flee to the remotest parts of the desert , O people of Dedan ; [ a ] for when I punish Edom , I will punish you ! 9-10 Those who gather grapes leave a few for the poor , and even thieves don ’ t take everything , but I will strip bare the land of Esau , and there will be no place to hide . Her children , her brothers , her neighbors—all will be destroyed—and she herself will perish too .
TLB	Jeremiah	49	11	( But I will preserve your fatherless children who remain , and let your widows depend upon me . )
TLB	Jeremiah	49	12	The Lord says to Edom : If the innocent must suffer , how much more must you ! You shall not go unpunished ! You must drink this cup of judgment !
TLB	Jeremiah	49	13	For I have sworn by my own name , says the Lord , that Bozrah shall become heaps of ruins , cursed and mocked ; and her cities shall be eternal wastes .
TLB	Jeremiah	49	14	I have heard this message from the Lord : I have sent a messenger to call the nations to form a coalition against Edom and destroy her .
TLB	Jeremiah	49	15	I will make her weak among the nations and despised by all , says the Lord .
TLB	Jeremiah	49	16	You have been fooled by your fame and your pride , living there in the mountains of Petra , in the clefts of the rocks . But though you live among the peaks with the eagles , I will bring you down , says the Lord .
TLB	Jeremiah	49	17	The fate of Edom will be horrible ; all who go by will be appalled and gasp at the sight .
TLB	Jeremiah	49	18	Your cities will become as silent as Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighboring towns , says the Lord . No one will live there anymore .
TLB	Jeremiah	49	19	I will send against them one who will come like a lion from the wilds of Jordan stalking the sheep in the fold . Suddenly Edom shall be destroyed , and I will appoint over the Edomites the person of my choice . For who is like me , and who can call me to account ? What shepherd can defy me ?
TLB	Jeremiah	49	20	Take note : The Lord will certainly do this to Edom and also the people of Teman—even little children will be dragged away as slaves ! It will be a shocking thing to see .
TLB	Jeremiah	49	21	The earth shakes with the noise of Edom ’ s fall ; the cry of the people is heard as far away as the Red Sea .
TLB	Jeremiah	49	22	The one who will come will fly as swift as a vulture and will spread his wings against Bozrah . Then the courage of the mightiest warriors will disappear like that of women in labor . Damascus
TLB	Jeremiah	49	23	The cities of Hamath and Arpad are stricken with fear , for they have heard the news of their doom . Their hearts are troubled like a wild sea in a raging storm .
TLB	Jeremiah	49	24	Damascus has become feeble , and all her people turn to flee . Fear , anguish , and sorrow have gripped her as they do women in labor .
TLB	Jeremiah	49	25	O famous city , city of joy , how you are forsaken now !
TLB	Jeremiah	49	26	Your young men lie dead in the streets ; your entire army shall be destroyed in one day , says the Lord Almighty .
TLB	Jeremiah	49	27	And I will start a fire at the edge of Damascus that shall burn up the palaces of Ben-hadad . Kedar and Hazor
TLB	Jeremiah	49	28	This prophecy is about Kedar [ b ] and the kingdoms of Hazor that are going to be destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar , king of Babylon , for the Lord will send him to destroy them :
TLB	Jeremiah	49	29	Their flocks and their tents will be captured , says the Lord , with all their household goods . Their camels will be taken away , and all around will be the shouts of panic , “ We are surrounded and doomed ! ”
TLB	Jeremiah	49	30	Flee for your lives , says the Lord . Go deep into the deserts , O people of Hazor , for Nebuchadnezzar , king of Babylon , has plotted against you and is preparing to destroy you .
TLB	Jeremiah	49	31	“ Go , ” said the Lord to King Nebuchadnezzar . “ Attack those wealthy Bedouin tribes living alone in the desert without a care in the world , boasting that they are self-sufficient—that they need neither walls nor gates .
TLB	Jeremiah	49	32	Their camels and cattle shall all be yours , and I will scatter these heathen [ c ] to the winds . From all directions I will bring calamity upon them .
TLB	Jeremiah	49	33	“ Hazor shall be a home for wild animals of the desert . No one shall ever live there again . It shall be desolate forever. ” Elam
TLB	Jeremiah	49	34	God ’ s message against Elam came to Jeremiah in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah , king of Judah :
TLB	Jeremiah	49	35	The Lord says : I will destroy the army of Elam ,
TLB	Jeremiah	49	36	and I will scatter the people of Elam to the four winds ; they shall be exiled to countries throughout the world .
TLB	Jeremiah	49	37	My fierce anger will bring great evil upon Elam , says the Lord , and I will cause her enemies to wipe her out .
TLB	Jeremiah	49	38	And I will set my throne in Elam , says the Lord . I will destroy her king and princes .
TLB	Jeremiah	49	39	But in the latter days I will bring the people back , says the Lord . Footnotes - Jeremiah 49:8 Dedan was in Northern Arabia and was a flourishing caravan city at the time of Jeremiah and Ezekiel . - Jeremiah 49:28 Kedar , an Arab tribe living in the desert east of Palestine . Hazor , not the Hazor mentioned in Joshua and Judges—a great city north of the Sea of Galilee , but rather , a group of Arab tribes . - Jeremiah 49:32 these heathen , literally , “ those who cut the corners of their hair. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Jeremiah	50	50	Babylon This is the message from the Lord against Babylon and the Chaldeans , spoken by Jeremiah the prophet :
TLB	Jeremiah	50	2	Tell all the world that Babylon will be destroyed ; her god Marduk will be utterly disgraced !
TLB	Jeremiah	50	3	For a nation shall come down upon her from the north with such destruction that no one shall live in her again ; all shall be gone—both men and animals shall flee .
TLB	Jeremiah	50	4	Then the people of Israel and Judah shall join together , weeping and seeking the Lord their God .
TLB	Jeremiah	50	5	They shall ask the way to Zion and start back home again . “ Come , ” they will say , “ let us be united to the Lord with an eternal pledge that will never be broken again. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	50	6	My people have been lost sheep . Their shepherds led them astray and then turned them loose in the mountains . They lost their way and didn ’ t remember how to get back to the fold .
TLB	Jeremiah	50	7	All who found them devoured them and said , “ We are permitted to attack them freely , for they have sinned against the Lord , the God of justice , the hope of their fathers. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	50	8	But now , flee from Babylon , the land of the Chaldeans ; lead my people home again .
TLB	Jeremiah	50	9	For see , I am raising up an army of great nations from the north , and I will bring them against Babylon to attack her , and she shall be destroyed . The enemies ’ arrows go straight to the mark ; they do not miss !
TLB	Jeremiah	50	10	And Babylon shall be sacked until everyone is sated with loot , ” says the Lord .
TLB	Jeremiah	50	11	Though you were glad , O Chaldeans , plunderers of my people , and are fat as cows that feed in lush pastures , and neigh like stallions ,
TLB	Jeremiah	50	12	yet your mother shall be overwhelmed with shame , for you shall become the least of the nations—a wilderness , a dry and desert land .
TLB	Jeremiah	50	13	Because of the anger of the Lord , Babylon shall become deserted wasteland , and all who pass by shall be appalled and shall mock at her for all her wounds .
TLB	Jeremiah	50	14	Yes , prepare to fight with Babylon , all you nations round about ; let the archers shoot at her ; spare no arrows , for she has sinned against the Lord .
TLB	Jeremiah	50	15	Shout against her from every side . Look ! She surrenders ! Her walls have fallen . The Lord has taken vengeance . Do to her as she has done !
TLB	Jeremiah	50	16	Let the farmhands all depart . Let them rush back to their own lands as the enemies advance .
TLB	Jeremiah	50	17	The Israelites are like sheep the lions chase . First the king of Assyria ate them up ; then Nebuchadnezzar , the king of Babylon , crunched their bones .
TLB	Jeremiah	50	18	Therefore the Lord , the God of Israel , says : Now I will punish the king of Babylon and his land as I punished the king of Assyria .
TLB	Jeremiah	50	19	And I will bring Israel home again to her own land , to feed in the fields of Carmel and Bashan and to be happy once more on Mount Ephraim and Mount Gilead .
TLB	Jeremiah	50	20	In those days , says the Lord , no sin shall be found in Israel or in Judah , for I will pardon the remnant I preserve .
TLB	Jeremiah	50	21	Go up , O my warriors , against the land of Merathaim [ a ] and against the people of Pekod . Yes , march against Babylon , the land of rebels , a land that I will judge ! Annihilate them , as I have commanded you .
TLB	Jeremiah	50	22	Let there be the shout of battle in the land , a shout of great destruction .
TLB	Jeremiah	50	23	Babylon , the mightiest hammer in all the earth , lies broken and shattered . Babylon is desolate among the nations !
TLB	Jeremiah	50	24	O Babylon , I have set a trap for you and you are caught , for you have fought against the Lord .
TLB	Jeremiah	50	25	The Lord has opened his armory and brought out weapons to explode his wrath upon his enemies . The terror that befalls Babylon will be the work of the Lord God .
TLB	Jeremiah	50	26	Yes , come against her from distant lands ; break open her granaries ; knock down her walls and houses into heaps of ruins and utterly destroy her ; let nothing be left .
TLB	Jeremiah	50	27	Not even her cattle—woe to them too ! Kill them all ! For the time has come for Babylon to be devastated .
TLB	Jeremiah	50	28	But my people will flee ; they will escape back to their own country to tell how the Lord their God has broken forth in fury upon those who destroyed his Temple .
TLB	Jeremiah	50	29	Send out a call for archers to come to Babylon ; surround the city so that none can escape . Do to her as she has done to others , for she has haughtily defied the Lord , the Holy One of Israel .
TLB	Jeremiah	50	30	Her young men will fall in the streets and die ; her warriors will all be killed .
TLB	Jeremiah	50	31	For see , I am against you , O people so proud ; and now your day of reckoning has come .
TLB	Jeremiah	50	32	Land of pride , you will stumble and fall , and no one will raise you up ; for the Lord will light a fire in the cities of Babylon that will burn everything around them .
TLB	Jeremiah	50	33	The Lord says : The people of Israel and Judah have been wronged . Their captors hold them and refuse to let them go .
TLB	Jeremiah	50	34	But their Redeemer is strong . His name is the Lord Almighty . He will plead for them and see that they are freed to live again in quietness in Israel . As for the people of Babylon—there is no rest for them !
TLB	Jeremiah	50	35	The sword of destruction shall smite the Chaldeans , says the Lord . It shall smite the people of Babylon—her princes and wise men too .
TLB	Jeremiah	50	36	All her wise counselors shall become fools ! Panic shall seize her mightiest warriors !
TLB	Jeremiah	50	37	War shall devour her horses and chariots , and her allies from other lands shall become as weak as women . Her treasures shall all be robbed ;
TLB	Jeremiah	50	38	even her water supply will fail . And why ? Because the whole land is full of images , and the people are madly in love with their idols .
TLB	Jeremiah	50	39	Therefore this city of Babylon shall become inhabited by ostriches and jackals ; it shall be a home for the wild animals of the desert . Never again shall it be lived in by human beings ; it shall lie desolate forever .
TLB	Jeremiah	50	40	The Lord declares that he will destroy Babylon just as he destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighboring towns . No one has lived in them since , and no one will live again in Babylon .
TLB	Jeremiah	50	41	See them coming ! A great army from the north ! It is accompanied by many kings called by God from many lands .
TLB	Jeremiah	50	42	They are fully armed for slaughter ; they are cruel and show no mercy ; their battle cry roars like the surf against the shoreline . O Babylon , they ride against you fully ready for the battle .
TLB	Jeremiah	50	43	When the king of Babylon received the dispatch , his hands fell helpless at his sides ; pangs of terror gripped him like the pangs of a woman in labor .
TLB	Jeremiah	50	44	I will send against them an invader who will come upon them suddenly , like a lion from the jungles of Jordan that leaps upon the grazing sheep . I will put her defenders to flight and appoint over them whomsoever I please . For who is like me ? What ruler can oppose my will ? Who can call me to account ?
TLB	Jeremiah	50	45	Listen to the plan of the Lord against Babylon , the land of the Chaldeans . For even little children shall be dragged away as slaves ; oh , the horror ; oh , the terror .
TLB	Jeremiah	50	46	The whole earth shall shake at Babylon ’ s fall , and her cry of despair shall be heard around the world .

TLB	Jeremiah	51	51	“ We are ashamed because the Temple of the Lord has been defiled by foreigners from Babylon. ”
TLB	Jeremiah	51	2	Winnowers shall come and winnow her and blow her away ; they shall come from every side to rise against her in her day of trouble .
TLB	Jeremiah	51	3	The arrows of the enemy shall strike down the bowmen of Babylon and pierce her warriors in their coats of mail . No one shall be spared ; both young and old alike shall be destroyed .
TLB	Jeremiah	51	4	They shall fall down slain in the land of the Chaldeans , slashed to death in her streets .
TLB	Jeremiah	51	5	For the Lord Almighty has not forsaken Israel and Judah . He is still their God , but the land of the Chaldeans [ a ] is filled with sin against the Holy One of Israel .
TLB	Jeremiah	51	6	Flee from Babylon ! Save yourselves ! Don ’ t get trapped ! If you stay , you will be destroyed when God takes his vengeance on all of Babylon ’ s sins .
TLB	Jeremiah	51	7	Babylon has been as a gold cup in the Lord ’ s hands , a cup from which he made the whole earth drink and go mad .
TLB	Jeremiah	51	8	But now , suddenly Babylon too has fallen . Weep for her ; give her medicine ; perhaps she can yet be healed .
TLB	Jeremiah	51	9	We would help her if we could , but nothing can save her now . Let her go . Abandon her and return to your own land , for God is judging her from heaven .
TLB	Jeremiah	51	10	The Lord has vindicated us . Come , let us declare in Jerusalem all the Lord our God has done .
TLB	Jeremiah	51	11	Sharpen the arrows ! Lift up the shields ! For the Lord has stirred up the spirit of the kings of the Medes to march on Babylon and destroy her . This is his vengeance on those who wronged his people and desecrated his Temple .
TLB	Jeremiah	51	12	Prepare your defenses , Babylon ! Set many watchmen on your walls ; send out an ambush , for the Lord will do all he has said he would concerning Babylon .
TLB	Jeremiah	51	13	O wealthy port , great center of commerce , your end has come ; the thread of your life is cut .
TLB	Jeremiah	51	14	The Lord Almighty has taken this vow and sworn to it in his own name : Your cities shall be filled with enemies , like fields filled with locusts in a plague , and they shall lift to the skies their mighty shouts of victory .
TLB	Jeremiah	51	15	God made the earth by his power and wisdom . He stretched out the heavens by his understanding .
TLB	Jeremiah	51	16	When he speaks , there is thunder in the heavens , and he causes the vapors to rise around the world ; he brings the lightning with the rain and the winds from his treasuries .
TLB	Jeremiah	51	17	Compared to him , all men are stupid beasts . They have no wisdom—none at all ! The silversmith is dulled by the images he makes , for in making them he lies ; for he calls them gods when there is not a breath of life in them at all !
TLB	Jeremiah	51	18	Idols are nothing ! They are lies ! And the time is coming when God will come and see , and shall destroy them all .
TLB	Jeremiah	51	19	But the God of Israel is no idol ! For he made everything there is , and Israel is his nation ; the Lord Almighty is his name .
TLB	Jeremiah	51	20	Cyrus is [ b ] God ’ s battleaxe and sword . I will use you , says the Lord , to break nations in pieces and to destroy many kingdoms .
TLB	Jeremiah	51	21	With you I will crush armies , destroying the horse and his rider , the chariot and the charioteer—
TLB	Jeremiah	51	22	yes , and the civilians too , both old and young , young men and maidens ,
TLB	Jeremiah	51	23	shepherds and flocks , farmers and oxen , captains and rulers ;
TLB	Jeremiah	51	24	before your eyes I will repay Babylon and all the Chaldeans for all the evil they have done to my people , says the Lord .
TLB	Jeremiah	51	25	For see , I am against you , O mighty mountain , Babylon , destroyer of the earth ! I will lift my hand against you , roll you down from your heights , and leave you , a burnt-out mountain .
TLB	Jeremiah	51	26	You shall be desolate forever ; [ c ] even your stones shall never be used for building again . You shall be completely wiped out .
TLB	Jeremiah	51	27	Signal many nations to mobilize for war on Babylon . Sound the battle cry ; bring out the armies of Ararat , Minni , and Ashkenaz . Appoint a leader ; bring a multitude of horses !
TLB	Jeremiah	51	28	Bring against her the armies of the kings of the Medes and their generals , and the armies of all the countries they rule .
TLB	Jeremiah	51	29	Babylon trembles and writhes in pain , for all that the Lord has planned against her stands unchanged . Babylon will be left desolate without a living soul .
TLB	Jeremiah	51	30	Her mightiest soldiers no longer fight ; they stay in their barracks . Their courage is gone ; they have become as women . The invaders have burned the houses and broken down the city gates .
TLB	Jeremiah	51	31	Messengers from every side come running to the king to tell him all is lost !
TLB	Jeremiah	51	32	All the escape routes are blocked ; the fortifications are burning , and the army is in panic .
TLB	Jeremiah	51	33	For the Lord , the God of Israel , says : Babylon is like the wheat upon a threshing floor ; in just a little while the flailing will begin . 34-35 The Jews in Babylon say , “ Nebuchadnezzar , king of Babylon , has eaten and crushed us and emptied out our strength ; he has swallowed us like a great monster and filled his belly with our riches ; he has cast us out of our own country . May Babylon be repaid for all she did to us ! May she be paid in full for all our blood she spilled ! ”
TLB	Jeremiah	51	36	And the Lord replies : I will be your lawyer ; I will plead your case ; I will avenge you . I will dry up her river , her water supply ,
TLB	Jeremiah	51	37	and Babylon shall become a heap of ruins , haunted by jackals , a land horrible to see , incredible , without a living soul .
TLB	Jeremiah	51	38	In their drunken feasts , the men of Babylon roar like lions .
TLB	Jeremiah	51	39	And while they lie inflamed with all their wine , I will prepare a different kind of feast for them and make them drink until they fall unconscious to the floor , to sleep forever , never to waken again , says the Lord .
TLB	Jeremiah	51	40	I will bring them like lambs to the slaughter , like rams and goats .
TLB	Jeremiah	51	41	How Babylon is fallen—great Babylon , lauded by all the earth ! The world can scarcely believe its eyes at Babylon ’ s fall !
TLB	Jeremiah	51	42	The sea has risen upon Babylon ; she is covered by its waves .
TLB	Jeremiah	51	43	Her cities lie in ruins—she is a dry wilderness where no one lives nor even travelers pass by .
TLB	Jeremiah	51	44	And I will punish Bel , the god of Babylon , and pull from his mouth what he has taken . The nations shall no longer come and worship him ; the wall of Babylon has fallen .
TLB	Jeremiah	51	45	O my people , flee from Babylon ; save yourselves from the fierce anger of the Lord .
TLB	Jeremiah	51	46	But don ’ t panic when you hear the first rumor of approaching forces . For rumors will keep coming year by year . Then there will be a time of civil war as the governors of Babylon fight against each other .
TLB	Jeremiah	51	47	For the time is surely coming when I will punish this great city and all her idols ; her dead shall lie in the streets .
TLB	Jeremiah	51	48	Heaven and earth shall rejoice , for out of the north shall come destroying armies against Babylon , says the Lord .
TLB	Jeremiah	51	49	Just as Babylon killed the people of Israel , so must she be killed .
TLB	Jeremiah	51	50	Go , you who escaped the sword ! Don ’ t stand and watch—flee while you can ! Remember the Lord and return to Jerusalem far away !
TLB	Jeremiah	51	52	Yes , says the Lord . But the time is coming for the destruction of the idols of Babylon . All through the land will be heard the groans of the wounded .
TLB	Jeremiah	51	53	Though Babylon be as powerful as heaven , though she increase her strength immeasurably , she shall die , says the Lord .
TLB	Jeremiah	51	54	Listen ! Hear the cry of great destruction out of Babylon , the land the Chaldeans rule !
TLB	Jeremiah	51	55	For the Lord is destroying Babylon ; her mighty voice is stilled as the waves roar in upon her .
TLB	Jeremiah	51	56	Destroying armies come and slay her mighty men ; all her weapons break in her hands , for the Lord God gives just punishment and is giving Babylon all her due .
TLB	Jeremiah	51	57	I will make drunk her princes , wise men , rulers , captains , warriors . They shall sleep and not wake up again ! So says the King , the Lord Almighty .
TLB	Jeremiah	51	58	For the wide walls of Babylon shall be leveled to the ground , and her high gates shall be burned ; the builders from many lands have worked in vain—their work shall be destroyed by fire !
TLB	Jeremiah	51	59	During the fourth year of Zedekiah ’ s reign , this message came to Jeremiah to give to Seraiah ( son of Neriah , son of Mahseiah ) , concerning Seraiah ’ s capture [ d ] and exile to Babylon along with Zedekiah , king of Judah . ( Seraiah was quartermaster of Zedekiah ’ s army . )
TLB	Jeremiah	51	60	Jeremiah wrote on a scroll all the terrible things God had scheduled against Babylon—all the words written above— 61-62 and gave the scroll to Seraiah and said to him , “ When you get to Babylon , read what I have written and say , ‘ Lord , you have said that you will destroy Babylon so that not a living creature will remain , and it will be abandoned forever. ’
TLB	Jeremiah	51	63	Then , when you have finished reading the scroll , tie a rock to it , and throw it into the Euphrates River ,
TLB	Jeremiah	51	64	and say , ‘ So shall Babylon sink , never more to rise , because of the evil I am bringing upon her. ’ ” ( This ends Jeremiah ’ s messages . ) Footnotes - Jeremiah 51:5 the land of the Chaldeans , implied . - Jeremiah 51:20 Cyrus is , literally , “ You are , ” Cyrus was used of God to conquer Babylon . See also Isaiah 44:28 ; 45:1 . - Jeremiah 51:26 You shall be desolate forever . This complete destruction of the city of Babylon was accomplished by later Persian kings . Jeremiah here sees the long-range picture of the city ’ s history , and does not confine himself to Cyrus . - Jeremiah 51:59 concerning Seraiah ’ s capture .

TLB	Jeremiah	52	52	( Events told about in chapter
TLB	Jeremiah	52	39	. ) Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king , and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem . His mother ’ s name was Hamutal ( daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah ) .
TLB	Jeremiah	52	2	But he was a wicked king , just as Jehoiakim had been .
TLB	Jeremiah	52	3	Things became so bad at last that the Lord , in his anger , saw to it that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon until he and the people of Israel were ejected from the Lord ’ s presence in Jerusalem and Judah , and were taken away as captives to Babylon .
TLB	Jeremiah	52	4	In the ninth year of Zedekiah ’ s reign , on the tenth day of the tenth month , Nebuchadnezzar , king of Babylon , came with all his army against Jerusalem and built forts around it ,
TLB	Jeremiah	52	5	and laid siege to the city for two years .
TLB	Jeremiah	52	6	Then finally , on the ninth day of the fourth month , when the famine in the city was very serious , with the last of the food entirely gone ,
TLB	Jeremiah	52	7	the people in the city tore a hole in the city wall and all the soldiers fled from the city during the night , going out by the gate between the two walls near the king ’ s gardens ( for the city was surrounded by the Chaldeans ) , and made a dash for it across the fields , toward Arabah .
TLB	Jeremiah	52	8	But the Chaldean soldiers chased them and caught King Zedekiah in some fields near Jericho—for all his army was scattered from him .
TLB	Jeremiah	52	9	They brought him to the king of Babylon who was staying in the city of Riblah in the kingdom of Hamath , and there judgment was passed upon him .
TLB	Jeremiah	52	10	He made Zedekiah watch while his sons and all the princes of Judah were killed before his eyes .
TLB	Jeremiah	52	11	Then his eyes were gouged out , and he was taken in chains to Babylon and put in prison for the rest of his life .
TLB	Jeremiah	52	12	On the tenth day of the fifth month during the nineteenth year [ a ] of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar , king of Babylon , Nebuzaradan , captain of the guard , arrived in Jerusalem ,
TLB	Jeremiah	52	13	and burned the Temple and the palace and all the larger homes ,
TLB	Jeremiah	52	14	and set the Chaldean army to work tearing down the walls of the city .
TLB	Jeremiah	52	15	Then he took to Babylon , as captives , some of the poorest of the people—along with those who survived the city ’ s destruction , and those who had deserted Zedekiah and had come over to the Babylonian army , and the tradesmen who were left .
TLB	Jeremiah	52	16	But he left some of the poorest people to care for the crops as vinedressers and plowmen .
TLB	Jeremiah	52	17	The Babylonians dismantled the two large bronze pillars that stood at the entrance of the Temple , and the bronze laver and bronze bulls on which it stood , and carted them off to Babylon .
TLB	Jeremiah	52	18	feet in circumference , hollow , with 3-inch walls .
TLB	Jeremiah	52	19	He also took the firepans , the solid gold and silver candlesticks , and the cups and bowls .
TLB	Jeremiah	52	20	The weight of the two enormous pillars , the laver , and twelve bulls was tremendous . They had no way of estimating it . ( They had been made in the days of King Solomon . )
TLB	Jeremiah	52	21	For the pillars were each
TLB	Jeremiah	52	27	where the king killed them all . So it was that Judah ’ s exile was accomplished .
TLB	Jeremiah	52	22	The top 7-1/2 feet of each column had bronze carvings , a network of bronze pomegranates .
TLB	Jeremiah	52	23	There were
TLB	Jeremiah	52	96	pomegranates on the sides , and on the network round about there were a hundred more . 24-25 The captain of the guard took along with him as his prisoners : Seraiah the chief priest , Zephaniah his assistant , the three chief Temple guards , one of the commanding officers of the army , seven of the king ’ s special counselors discovered in the city , the secretary of the general-in-chief of the Jewish army ( who was in charge of recruitment ) , and sixty other men of importance found hiding .
TLB	Jeremiah	52	26	He took them to the king of Babylon at Riblah ,
TLB	Jeremiah	52	28	The number of captives taken to Babylon in the seventh year of Nebuchadnezzar ’ s reign was 3,023 .
TLB	Jeremiah	52	29	Then , eleven years later , he took
TLB	Jeremiah	52	832	more ;
TLB	Jeremiah	52	30	five years after that he sent Nebuzaradan , his captain of the guard , and took 745—a total of 4,600 captives in all .
TLB	Jeremiah	52	31	On February
TLB	Jeremiah	52	25	of the thirty-seventh year of the imprisonment in Babylon of Jehoiachin , king of Judah , Evil-merodach , who became king of Babylon that year , was kind to King Jehoiachin and brought him out of prison .
TLB	Jeremiah	52	32	He spoke pleasantly to him and gave him preference over all the other kings in Babylon ;
TLB	Jeremiah	52	33	he gave him new clothes and fed him from the king ’ s kitchen as long as he lived .
TLB	Jeremiah	52	34	And he was given a regular allowance to cover his daily needs until the day of his death . Footnotes - Jeremiah 52:12 On the tenth day of the fifth month during the nineteenth year , late in July ,

TLB	Lamentations	1	1	Jerusalem ’ s streets , once thronged with people , are silent now . Like a widow broken with grief , she sits alone in her mourning . She , once queen of nations , is now a slave .
TLB	Lamentations	1	2	She sobs through the night ; tears run down her cheeks . Among all her lovers , [ a ] there is none to help her . All her friends are now her enemies .
TLB	Lamentations	1	3	Why is Judah led away , a slave ? Because of all the wrong she did to others , making them her slaves . Now she sits in exile far away . There is no rest , for those she persecuted have turned and conquered her .
TLB	Lamentations	1	4	The roads to Zion mourn , no longer filled with joyous throngs who come to celebrate the Temple feasts ; the city gates are silent , her priests groan , her virgins have been dragged away . Bitterly she weeps .
TLB	Lamentations	1	5	Her enemies prosper , for the Lord has punished Jerusalem for all her many sins ; her young children are captured and taken far away as slaves .
TLB	Lamentations	1	6	All her beauty and her majesty are gone ; her princes are like starving deer that search for pasture—helpless game too weak to keep on running from their foes .
TLB	Lamentations	1	7	And now in the midst of all Jerusalem ’ s sadness she remembers happy bygone days . She thinks of all the precious joys she had before her mocking enemy struck her down—and there was no one to give her aid .
TLB	Lamentations	1	8	For Jerusalem sinned so horribly ; therefore , she is tossed away like dirty rags . All who honored her despise her now , for they have seen her stripped naked and humiliated . She groans and hides her face .
TLB	Lamentations	1	9	She indulged herself in immorality and refused to face the fact that punishment was sure to come . Now she lies in the gutter with no one left to lift her out . “ O Lord , ” she cries , “ see my plight . The enemy has triumphed. ”
TLB	Lamentations	1	10	Her enemies have plundered her completely , taking everything precious she owns . She has seen foreign nations violate her sacred Temple—foreigners you had forbidden even to enter .
TLB	Lamentations	1	11	Her people groan and cry for bread ; they have sold all they have for food to give a little strength . “ Look , O Lord , ” she prays , “ and see how I ’ m despised. ”
TLB	Lamentations	1	12	Is it nothing to you , all you who pass by ? Look and see if there is any sorrow like my sorrow because of all the Lord has done to me in the day of his fierce wrath .
TLB	Lamentations	1	13	He has sent fire from heaven that burns within my bones ; he has placed a pitfall in my path and turned me back . He has left me sick and desolate the whole day through .
TLB	Lamentations	1	14	He wove my sins into ropes to hitch me to a yoke of slavery . He sapped my strength and gave me to my enemies ; I am helpless in their hands .
TLB	Lamentations	1	15	The Lord has trampled all my mighty men . A great army has come at his command to crush the noblest youth . The Lord has trampled his beloved city as grapes in a winepress .
TLB	Lamentations	1	16	For all these things I weep ; tears flow down my cheeks . My Comforter is far away—he who alone could help me . My children have no future ; we are a conquered land .
TLB	Lamentations	1	17	Jerusalem pleads for help , but no one comforts her . For the Lord has spoken : “ Let her neighbors be her foes ! Let her be thrown out like filthy rags ! ”
TLB	Lamentations	1	18	And the Lord is right , for we rebelled . And yet , O people everywhere , behold and see my anguish and despair , for my sons and daughters are taken far away as slaves to distant lands .
TLB	Lamentations	1	19	I begged my allies [ b ] for their help . False hope—they could not help at all . Nor could my priests and elders—they were starving in the streets while searching through the garbage dumps for bread .
TLB	Lamentations	1	20	See , O Lord , my anguish ; my heart is broken and my soul despairs , for I have terribly rebelled . In the streets the sword awaits me ; at home , disease and death .
TLB	Lamentations	1	21	Hear my groans ! And there is no one anywhere to help . All my enemies have heard my troubles , and they are glad to see what you have done . And yet , O Lord , the time will surely come—for you have promised it—when you will do to them as you have done to me .
TLB	Lamentations	1	22	Look also on their sins , O Lord , and punish them as you have punished me , for my sighs are many and my heart is faint .

TLB	Lamentations	2	2	The Lord without mercy has destroyed every home in Israel . In his wrath he has broken every fortress , every wall . He has brought the kingdom to dust , with all its rulers .
TLB	Lamentations	2	3	All the strength of Israel vanishes beneath his wrath . He has withdrawn his protection as the enemy attacks . God burns across the land of Israel like a raging fire .
TLB	Lamentations	2	4	He bends his bow against his people as though he were an enemy . His strength is used against them to kill their finest youth . His fury is poured out like fire upon them .
TLB	Lamentations	2	5	Yes , the Lord has vanquished Israel like an enemy . He has destroyed her forts and palaces . Sorrows and tears are his portion for Jerusalem .
TLB	Lamentations	2	6	He has violently broken down his Temple as though it were a booth of leaves and branches in a garden ! No longer can the people celebrate their holy feasts and Sabbaths . Kings and priests together fall before his wrath .
TLB	Lamentations	2	7	The Lord has rejected his own altar , for he despises the false “ worship ” of his people ; he has given their palaces to their enemies , who carouse in the Temple as Israel used to do on days of holy feasts !
TLB	Lamentations	2	8	The Lord determined to destroy Jerusalem . He laid out an unalterable line of destruction . Therefore the ramparts and walls fell down before him .
TLB	Lamentations	2	9	Jerusalem ’ s gates are useless . All their locks and bars are broken , for he has crushed them . Her kings and princes are enslaved in far-off lands , without a temple , without a divine law to govern them or prophetic vision to guide them .
TLB	Lamentations	2	10	The elders of Jerusalem sit upon the ground in silence , clothed in sackcloth ; they throw dust upon their heads in sorrow and despair . The virgins of Jerusalem hang their heads in shame .
TLB	Lamentations	2	11	I have cried until the tears no longer come ; my heart is broken , my spirit poured out , as I see what has happened to my people ; little children and tiny babies are fainting and dying in the streets .
TLB	Lamentations	2	12	“ Mama , Mama , we want food , ” they cry , and then collapse upon their mothers ’ shrunken breasts . Their lives ebb away like those wounded in battle .
TLB	Lamentations	2	13	In all the world has there ever been such sorrow ? O Jerusalem , what can I compare your anguish to ? How can I comfort you ? For your wound is deep as the sea . Who can heal you ?
TLB	Lamentations	2	14	Your “ prophets ” have said so many foolish things , false to the core . They have not tried to hold you back from slavery by pointing out your sins . They lied and said that all was well .
TLB	Lamentations	2	15	All who pass by scoff and shake their heads and say , “ Is this the city called ‘ Most Beautiful in All the World , ’ and ‘ Joy of All the Earth ’ ? ”
TLB	Lamentations	2	16	All your enemies deride you . They hiss and grind their teeth and say , “ We have destroyed her at last ! Long have we waited for this hour , and it is finally here ! With our own eyes we ’ ve seen her fall. ”
TLB	Lamentations	2	17	But it is the Lord who did it , just as he had warned . He has fulfilled the promises of doom he made so long ago . He has destroyed Jerusalem without mercy and caused her enemies to rejoice over her and boast of their power .
TLB	Lamentations	2	18	Then the people wept before the Lord . O walls of Jerusalem , let tears fall down upon you like a river ; give yourselves no rest from weeping day or night .
TLB	Lamentations	2	19	Rise in the night and cry to your God . Pour out your hearts like water to the Lord ; lift up your hands to him ; plead for your children as they faint with hunger in the streets .
TLB	Lamentations	2	20	O Lord , think ! These are your own people to whom you are doing this . Shall mothers eat their little children , those they bounced upon their knees ? Shall priests and prophets die within the Temple of the Lord ?
TLB	Lamentations	2	21	See them lying in the streets—old and young , boys and girls , killed by the enemies ’ swords . You have killed them , Lord , in your anger ; you have killed them without mercy .
TLB	Lamentations	2	22	You have deliberately called for this destruction ; in the day of your anger none escaped or remained . All my little children lie dead upon the streets before the enemy . Footnotes - Lamentations 2:1 Temple , literally , “ footstool. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Lamentations	3	3	He has turned against me . Day and night his hand is heavy on me .
TLB	Lamentations	3	2	He has brought me into deepest darkness , shutting out all light .
TLB	Lamentations	3	4	He has made me old and has broken my bones .
TLB	Lamentations	3	5	He has built forts against me and surrounded me with anguish and distress .
TLB	Lamentations	3	6	He buried me in dark places , like those long dead .
TLB	Lamentations	3	7	He has walled me in ; I can not escape ; he has fastened me with heavy chains .
TLB	Lamentations	3	8	And though I cry and shout , he will not hear my prayers !
TLB	Lamentations	3	9	He has shut me into a place of high , smooth walls ; [ a ] he has filled my path with detours .
TLB	Lamentations	3	10	He lurks like a bear , like a lion , waiting to attack me .
TLB	Lamentations	3	11	He has dragged me into the underbrush and torn me with his claws , leaving me bleeding and desolate .
TLB	Lamentations	3	12	He has bent his bow and aimed it squarely at me ,
TLB	Lamentations	3	13	and sent his arrows deep within my heart .
TLB	Lamentations	3	14	My own people laugh at me ; all day long they sing their ribald songs .
TLB	Lamentations	3	15	He has filled me with bitterness and given me a cup of deepest sorrows to drink .
TLB	Lamentations	3	16	He has made me eat gravel and broken my teeth ; he has rolled me in ashes and dirt .
TLB	Lamentations	3	17	O Lord , all peace and all prosperity have long since gone , for you have taken them away . I have forgotten what enjoyment is .
TLB	Lamentations	3	18	All hope is gone ; my strength has turned to water , for the Lord has left me .
TLB	Lamentations	3	19	Oh , remember the bitterness and suffering you have dealt to me !
TLB	Lamentations	3	20	For I can never forget these awful years ; always my soul will live in utter shame .
TLB	Lamentations	3	21	Yet there is one ray of hope :
TLB	Lamentations	3	22	his compassion never ends . It is only the Lord ’ s mercies that have kept us from complete destruction .
TLB	Lamentations	3	23	Great is his faithfulness ; his loving-kindness begins afresh each day .
TLB	Lamentations	3	24	My soul claims the Lord as my inheritance ; therefore I will hope in him .
TLB	Lamentations	3	25	The Lord is wonderfully good to those who wait for him , to those who seek for him .
TLB	Lamentations	3	26	It is good both to hope and wait quietly for the salvation of the Lord .
TLB	Lamentations	3	27	It is good for a young man to be under discipline ,
TLB	Lamentations	3	28	for it causes him to sit apart in silence beneath the Lord ’ s demands ,
TLB	Lamentations	3	29	to lie face downward in the dust ; then at last there is hope for him .
TLB	Lamentations	3	30	Let him turn the other cheek to those who strike him and accept their awful insults ,
TLB	Lamentations	3	31	for the Lord will not abandon him forever .
TLB	Lamentations	3	32	Although God gives him grief , yet he will show compassion too , according to the greatness of his loving-kindness .
TLB	Lamentations	3	33	For he does not enjoy afflicting men and causing sorrow . 34-36 But you have trampled and crushed beneath your feet the lowly of the world , and deprived men of their God-given rights , and refused them justice . No wonder the Lord has had to deal with you !
TLB	Lamentations	3	37	For who can act against you without the Lord ’ s permission ?
TLB	Lamentations	3	38	It is the Lord who helps one and harms another .
TLB	Lamentations	3	39	Why then should we , mere humans as we are , murmur and complain when punished for our sins ?
TLB	Lamentations	3	40	Let us examine ourselves instead , and let us repent and turn again to the Lord .
TLB	Lamentations	3	41	Let us lift our hearts and hands to him in heaven ,
TLB	Lamentations	3	42	for we have sinned ; we have rebelled against the Lord , and he has not forgotten it .
TLB	Lamentations	3	43	You have engulfed us by your anger , Lord , and slain us without mercy .
TLB	Lamentations	3	44	You have veiled yourself as with a cloud so that our prayers do not reach through .
TLB	Lamentations	3	45	You have made us as refuse and garbage among the nations .
TLB	Lamentations	3	46	All our enemies have spoken out against us .
TLB	Lamentations	3	47	We are filled with fear , for we are trapped and desolate , destroyed . 48-49 My eyes flow day and night with never-ending streams of tears because of the destruction of my people .
TLB	Lamentations	3	50	Oh , that the Lord might look down from heaven and respond to my cry !
TLB	Lamentations	3	51	My heart is breaking over what is happening to the young girls of Jerusalem .
TLB	Lamentations	3	52	My enemies , whom I have never harmed , chased me as though I were a bird .
TLB	Lamentations	3	53	They threw me in a well and capped it with a rock .
TLB	Lamentations	3	54	The water flowed above my head . I thought , This is the end !
TLB	Lamentations	3	55	But I called upon your name , O Lord , from deep within the well ,
TLB	Lamentations	3	56	and you heard me ! You listened to my pleading ; you heard my weeping !
TLB	Lamentations	3	57	Yes , you came at my despairing cry and told me not to fear .
TLB	Lamentations	3	58	O Lord , you are my lawyer ! Plead my case ! For you have redeemed my life .
TLB	Lamentations	3	59	You have seen the wrong they did to me ; be my Judge , to prove me right .
TLB	Lamentations	3	60	You have seen the plots my foes have laid against me .
TLB	Lamentations	3	61	You have heard the vile names they have called me ,
TLB	Lamentations	3	62	and all they say about me and their whispered plans .
TLB	Lamentations	3	63	See how they laugh and sing with glee , preparing my doom .
TLB	Lamentations	3	64	O Lord , repay them well for all the evil they have done .
TLB	Lamentations	3	65	Harden their hearts and curse them , Lord .
TLB	Lamentations	3	66	Go after them in fierce pursuit and wipe them off the earth , beneath the heavens of the Lord . Footnotes - Lamentations 3:9 He has shut me into a place of high , smooth walls , literally , “ He has walled up my ways with hewn stone. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Lamentations	4	4	How the finest gold has lost its luster ! For the inlaid [ a ] Temple walls are scattered in the streets !
TLB	Lamentations	4	2	The cream of our youth—the finest of the gold—are treated as earthenware pots . 3-4 Even the jackals feed their young , but not my people , Israel . They are like cruel desert ostriches , heedless of their babies ’ cries . The children ’ s tongues stick to the roofs of their mouths for thirst , for there is not a drop of water left . Babies cry for bread , but no one can give them any .
TLB	Lamentations	4	5	Those who used to eat fastidiously are begging in the streets for anything at all . Those brought up in palaces now scratch in garbage pits for food .
TLB	Lamentations	4	6	For the sin of my people is greater than that of Sodom , where utter disaster struck in a moment without the hand of man .
TLB	Lamentations	4	7	Our princes were lean and tanned , [ b ] the finest specimens of men ;
TLB	Lamentations	4	8	but now their faces are as black as soot . No one can recognize them . Their skin sticks to their bones ; it is dry and hard and withered .
TLB	Lamentations	4	9	Those killed by the sword are far better off than those who die of slow starvation .
TLB	Lamentations	4	10	Tenderhearted women have cooked and eaten their own children ; thus they survived the siege .
TLB	Lamentations	4	11	But now at last the anger of the Lord is satisfied ; his fiercest anger has been poured out . He started a fire in Jerusalem that burned it down to its foundations .
TLB	Lamentations	4	12	Not a king in all the earth—no one in all the world—would have believed an enemy could enter through Jerusalem ’ s gates !
TLB	Lamentations	4	13	Yet God permitted it because of the sins of her prophets and priests , who defiled the city by shedding innocent blood .
TLB	Lamentations	4	14	Now these same men are blindly staggering through the streets , covered with blood , defiling everything they touch .
TLB	Lamentations	4	15	“ Get away ! ” the people shout at them . “ You are defiled ! ” They flee to distant lands and wander there among the foreigners ; but none will let them stay .
TLB	Lamentations	4	16	The Lord himself has dealt with them ; he no longer helps them , for they persecuted the priests and elders who stayed true to God .
TLB	Lamentations	4	17	We look for our allies [ c ] to come and save us , but we look in vain . The nation we expected most to help us makes no move at all .
TLB	Lamentations	4	18	We can ’ t go into the streets without danger to our lives . Our end is near—our days are numbered . We are doomed .
TLB	Lamentations	4	19	Our enemies are swifter than the eagles ; if we flee to the mountains , they find us . If we hide in the wilderness , they are waiting for us there .
TLB	Lamentations	4	20	Our king—the life of our life , the Lord ’ s anointed—was captured in their snares . Yes , even our mighty king , about whom we had boasted that under his protection we could hold our own against any nation on earth !
TLB	Lamentations	4	21	Do you rejoice , O people of Edom , in the land of Uz ? But you , too , will feel the awful anger of the Lord .

TLB	Lamentations	5	5	We bow our necks beneath the victors ’ feet ; unending work is now our lot .
TLB	Lamentations	5	2	Our homes , our nation , now are filled with foreigners .
TLB	Lamentations	5	3	We are orphans—our fathers dead , our mothers widowed .
TLB	Lamentations	5	4	We must even pay for water to drink ; our fuel is sold to us at the highest of prices .
TLB	Lamentations	5	6	We beg for bread from Egypt , and Assyria too .
TLB	Lamentations	5	7	Our fathers sinned but died before the hand of judgment fell . We have borne the blow that they deserved !
TLB	Lamentations	5	8	Our former servants have become our masters ; there is no one left to save us .
TLB	Lamentations	5	9	We went into the wilderness to hunt for food , risking death from enemies .

TLB	Lamentations	5	14	The old men sit no longer in the city gates ; the young no longer dance and sing .
TLB	Lamentations	5	15	The joy of our hearts has ended ; our dance has turned to death . [ a ]
TLB	Lamentations	5	16	Our glory is gone . The crown is fallen from our head . Woe upon us for our sins .
TLB	Lamentations	5	17	Our hearts are faint and weary ; our eyes grow dim .
TLB	Lamentations	5	18	Jerusalem and the Temple of the Lord are desolate , deserted by all but wild animals lurking in the ruins .
TLB	Lamentations	5	19	O Lord , forever you remain the same ! Your throne continues from generation to generation .
TLB	Lamentations	5	20	Why do you forget us forever ? Why do you forsake us for so long ?
TLB	Lamentations	5	21	Turn us around and bring us back to you again ! That is our only hope ! Give us back the joys we used to have !

TLB	Ezekiel	1	1	1-3 Ezekiel was a priest ( the son of Buzi ) who lived with the Jewish exiles beside the Chebar Canal in Babylon . One day late in June , when I was thirty years old , [ a ] the heavens were suddenly opened to me and I saw visions from God .
TLB	Ezekiel	1	4	I saw , in this vision , a great storm coming toward me from the north , driving before it a huge cloud glowing with fire , with a mass of fire inside that flashed continually ; and in the fire there was something that shone like polished brass .
TLB	Ezekiel	1	5	Then from the center of the cloud , four strange forms appeared that looked like men ,
TLB	Ezekiel	1	6	except that each had four faces and two pairs of wings !
TLB	Ezekiel	1	7	Their legs were like those of men , but their feet were cloven like calves ’ feet , and shone like burnished brass .
TLB	Ezekiel	1	8	And beneath each of their wings I could see human hands .
TLB	Ezekiel	1	9	The four living beings were joined wing to wing , and they flew straight forward without turning .
TLB	Ezekiel	1	10	Each had the face of a man in front , [ b ] with a lion ’ s face on the right side of his head , and the face of an ox on the left side , and the face of an eagle at the back !
TLB	Ezekiel	1	11	Each had two pairs of wings spreading out from the middle of his back . One pair stretched out to attach to the wings of the living beings on each side , and the other pair covered his body .
TLB	Ezekiel	1	12	Wherever their spirit [ c ] went they went , going straight forward without turning .
TLB	Ezekiel	1	13	Going up and down among them were other forms that glowed like bright coals of fire or brilliant torches , and it was from these the lightning flashed .
TLB	Ezekiel	1	14	The living beings darted to and fro , swift as lightning .
TLB	Ezekiel	1	15	As I stared at all of this , I saw four wheels on the ground beneath them , one wheel belonging to each .
TLB	Ezekiel	1	16	The wheels looked as if they were made of polished amber , and each wheel was constructed with a second wheel crosswise inside . [ d ]
TLB	Ezekiel	1	17	They could go in any of the four directions without having to face around .
TLB	Ezekiel	1	18	The four wheels had rims and spokes , and the rims were filled with eyes around their edges . 19-21 When the four living beings flew forward , the wheels moved forward with them . When they flew upwards , the wheels went up too . When the living beings stopped , the wheels stopped . For the spirit of the four living beings was in the wheels ; so wherever their spirit went , the wheels and the living beings went there too .
TLB	Ezekiel	1	22	The sky spreading out above them looked as though it were made of crystal ; it was inexpressibly beautiful .
TLB	Ezekiel	1	23	The wings of each stretched straight out to touch the others ’ wings , and each had two wings covering his body .
TLB	Ezekiel	1	24	And as they flew , their wings roared like waves against the shore , or like the voice of God , or like the shouting of a mighty army . When they stopped , they let down their wings .
TLB	Ezekiel	1	25	And every time they stopped , there came a voice from the crystal sky above them . [ e ]
TLB	Ezekiel	1	26	For high in the sky above them was what looked like a throne made of beautiful blue sapphire stones , and upon it sat someone who appeared to be a Man . 27-28 From his waist up , he seemed to be all glowing bronze , dazzling like fire ; and from his waist down he seemed to be entirely flame , and there was a glowing halo like a rainbow all around him . That was the way the glory of the Lord appeared to me . And when I saw it , I fell face downward on the ground and heard the voice of someone speaking to me : Footnotes - Ezekiel 1:1 when I was thirty years old , literally , “ in the thirtieth year. ” - Ezekiel 1:10 in front , implied . of his head , implied . - Ezekiel 1:12 their spirit , literally , “ the spirit. ” - Ezekiel 1:16 a second wheel crosswise inside , literally , “ a wheel within a wheel , ” perhaps as in a gyroscope . - Ezekiel 1:25 from the crystal sky above them , literally , “ from above the firmament , over their heads. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Ezekiel	2	2	And the Spirit entered into me as he spoke , and set me on my feet .
TLB	Ezekiel	2	3	“ Son of dust , ” he said , “ I am sending you to the nation of Israel , to a nation rebelling against me . They and their fathers have kept on sinning against me until this very hour .
TLB	Ezekiel	2	4	For they are a hard-hearted , stiff-necked people . But I am sending you to give them my messages—the messages of the Lord God .
TLB	Ezekiel	2	5	And whether they listen or not ( for remember , they are rebels ) , they will at least know they have had a prophet among them .
TLB	Ezekiel	2	6	“ Son of dust , don ’ t be afraid of them ; don ’ t be frightened even though their threats are sharp and barbed and sting like scorpions . Don ’ t be dismayed by their dark scowls . For remember , they are rebels !
TLB	Ezekiel	2	7	You must give them my messages whether they listen or not ( but they won ’ t , [ b ] for they are utter rebels ) .
TLB	Ezekiel	2	8	Listen , son of dust , to what I say to you . Don ’ t you be a rebel too ! Open your mouth and eat what I give you. ” 9-10 Then I looked and saw a hand holding out to me a scroll , with writing on both sides . He unrolled it , and I saw that it was full of warnings and sorrows and pronouncements of doom . Footnotes - Ezekiel 2:1 son of dust , or “ son of man , ” appears eighty-seven times throughout the book of Ezekiel . The connotation is “ mortal man. ” In Daniel 7:13 , the corresponding Aramaic expression is used for the Messiah as representative of the human race of which he is the head . - Ezekiel 2:7 but they won ’ t , implied .

TLB	Ezekiel	3	3	“ Eat it all , ” he said . And when I ate it , it tasted sweet as honey .
TLB	Ezekiel	3	2	So I took the scroll .
TLB	Ezekiel	3	4	Then he said : “ Son of dust , I am sending you to the people of Israel with my messages .
TLB	Ezekiel	3	5	I am not sending you to some far-off foreign land where you can ’ t understand the language—
TLB	Ezekiel	3	6	no , not to tribes with strange , difficult tongues . ( If I did , they would listen ! )
TLB	Ezekiel	3	7	I am sending you to the people of Israel , and they won ’ t listen to you any more than they listen to me ! For the whole lot of them are hard , impudent , and stubborn .
TLB	Ezekiel	3	8	But see , I have made you hard and stubborn too—as tough as they are .
TLB	Ezekiel	3	9	I have made your forehead as hard as rock . So don ’ t be afraid of them , or fear their sullen , angry looks , even though they are such rebels. ”
TLB	Ezekiel	3	10	Then he added : “ Son of dust , let all my words sink deep into your own heart first ; listen to them carefully for yourself .
TLB	Ezekiel	3	11	Then , afterward , go to your people in exile , and whether or not they will listen , tell them : ‘ This is what the Lord God says ! ’ ”
TLB	Ezekiel	3	12	Then the Spirit lifted me up , and the glory of the Lord began to move away , accompanied by the sound of a great earthquake . [ a ]
TLB	Ezekiel	3	13	It was the noise of the wings of the living beings as they touched against each other , and the sound of their wheels beside them . 14-15 The Spirit lifted me up , and took me away to Tel Abib , another colony of Jewish exiles beside the Chebar River . I went in bitterness and anger , [ b ] but the hand of the Lord was strong upon me . And I sat among them , overwhelmed , for seven days .
TLB	Ezekiel	3	16	At the end of the seven days , the Lord said to me :
TLB	Ezekiel	3	17	“ Son of dust , I have appointed you as a watchman for Israel ; whenever I send my people a warning , pass it on to them at once .
TLB	Ezekiel	3	18	If you refuse to warn the wicked when I want you to tell them , ‘ You are under the penalty of death ; therefore repent and save your life , ’ they will die in their sins , but I will punish you . I will demand your blood for theirs .
TLB	Ezekiel	3	19	But if you warn them , and they keep on sinning and refuse to repent , they will die in their sins , but you are blameless—you have done all you could .
TLB	Ezekiel	3	20	And if a good man becomes bad , and you refuse to warn him of the consequences , and the Lord destroys him , his previous good deeds won ’ t help him—he shall die in his sin . But I will hold you responsible for his death and punish you .
TLB	Ezekiel	3	21	But if you warn him and he repents , he shall live , and you have saved your own life too. ”
TLB	Ezekiel	3	22	I was helpless in the hand of God , and when he said to me , “ Go out into the valley and I will talk to you there ” —
TLB	Ezekiel	3	23	I arose and went , and oh , I saw the glory of the Lord there , just as in my first vision ! And I fell to the ground on my face .
TLB	Ezekiel	3	24	Then the Spirit entered into me and set me on my feet . He talked to me and said : “ Go , imprison yourself in your house ,
TLB	Ezekiel	3	25	and I will paralyze you [ c ] so you can ’ t leave ;
TLB	Ezekiel	3	26	and I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth so that you can ’ t reprove them ; for they are rebels .
TLB	Ezekiel	3	27	But whenever I give you a message , then I will loosen your tongue and let you speak , and you shall say to them : ‘ The Lord God says. ’ Let anyone listen who wants to , and let anyone refuse who wants to , for they are rebels .

TLB	Ezekiel	4	4	1-2 “ And now , son of dust , take a large brick and lay it before you and draw a map of the city of Jerusalem on it . Draw a picture of siege mounds being built against the city , put enemy camps around it and battering rams surrounding the walls .
TLB	Ezekiel	4	3	And put an iron plate between you and the city , like a wall of iron . Demonstrate how an enemy army will capture Jerusalem ! “ There is special meaning in each detail of what I have told you to do . For it is a warning to the people of Israel . 4-5 “ Now lie on your left side for

TLB	Ezekiel	4	14	Then I said , “ O Lord God , must I be defiled by using dung ? For I have never been defiled before in all my life . From the time I was a child until now I have never eaten any animal that died of sickness or that I found injured or dead ; and I have never eaten any of the kinds of animals our law forbids. ” [ d ]
TLB	Ezekiel	4	15	Then the Lord said , “ All right , you may use cow dung instead of human dung. ”
TLB	Ezekiel	4	16	Then he told me , “ Son of dust , bread will be tightly rationed in Jerusalem . It will be weighed out with great care and eaten fearfully . And the water will be portioned out in driblets , and the people will drink it with dismay .

TLB	Ezekiel	5	4	then take a few hairs out and throw them into the fire , for a fire shall come from this remnant and destroy all Israel. ” 5-7 The Lord God says , “ This illustrates what will happen to Jerusalem , for she has turned away from my laws and has been even more wicked than the nations surrounding her. ”
TLB	Ezekiel	5	8	Therefore the Lord God says : “ I , even I , am against you and will punish you publicly while all the nations watch .
TLB	Ezekiel	5	9	Because of the terrible sins you have committed , I will punish you more terribly than I have ever done before or ever will again .
TLB	Ezekiel	5	10	Fathers will eat their own sons , and sons will eat their fathers ; and those who survive will be scattered into all the world .
TLB	Ezekiel	5	11	“ For I promise you : Because you have defiled my Temple with idols and evil sacrifices , therefore I will not spare you nor pity you at all .
TLB	Ezekiel	5	12	One-third of you will die from famine and disease ; one-third will be slaughtered by the enemy ; and one-third I will scatter to the winds , sending the sword of the enemy chasing after you .
TLB	Ezekiel	5	13	Then at last my anger will be appeased . And all Israel will know that what I threaten I do .
TLB	Ezekiel	5	14	“ So I will make a public example of you before all the surrounding nations and before everyone traveling past the ruins of your land .
TLB	Ezekiel	5	15	You will become a laughingstock to the world and an awesome example to everyone , for all to see what happens when the Lord turns against an entire nation in furious rebuke . I , the Lord , have spoken it !
TLB	Ezekiel	5	16	“ I will shower you with deadly arrows of famine to destroy you . The famine will become more and more serious until every bit of bread is gone .
TLB	Ezekiel	5	17	And not only famine will come , but wild animals will attack and kill you and your families ; disease and war will stalk your land , and the sword of the enemy will slay you ; I , the Lord , have spoken it ! ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Ezekiel	6	6	Again a message came from the Lord :
TLB	Ezekiel	6	2	“ Son of dust , look over toward the mountains of Israel and prophesy against them .
TLB	Ezekiel	6	3	Say to them , ‘ O mountains of Israel , hear the message of the Lord God against you and against the rivers and valleys . I , even I the Lord , will bring war upon you to destroy your idols . 4-7 All your cities will be smashed and burned , and the idol altars abandoned . Your gods will be shattered ; the bones of their worshipers will lie scattered among the altars . Then at last you will know I am the Lord .
TLB	Ezekiel	6	8	“ ‘ But I will let a few of my people escape—to be scattered among the nations of the world .
TLB	Ezekiel	6	9	Then when they are exiled among the nations , they will remember me , for I will take away their adulterous hearts—their love of idols—and I will blind their lecherous eyes that long for other gods . Then at last they will loathe themselves for all this wickedness .
TLB	Ezekiel	6	10	They will realize that I alone am God and that I wasn ’ t fooling when I told them that all this would happen to them. ’ ”
TLB	Ezekiel	6	11	The Lord God says : “ Raise your hands in horror and shake your head [ a ] with deep remorse and say , ‘ Alas for all the evil we have done ! ’ For you are going to perish from war and famine and disease .
TLB	Ezekiel	6	12	Disease will strike down those in exile ; war will destroy those in the land of Israel ; and any who remain will die by famine and siege . So at last I will expend my fury on you .
TLB	Ezekiel	6	13	When your slain lie scattered among your idols and altars on every hill and mountain and under every green tree and great oak where they offered incense to their gods—you will realize that I alone am God .
TLB	Ezekiel	6	14	I will crush you and make your cities desolate from the wilderness in the south to Riblah in the north . Then you will know I am the Lord. ” Footnotes - Ezekiel 6:11 Raise your hands in horror and shake your head , literally , “ Clap your hands and stamp your feet. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Ezekiel	7	7	O Israel , the day of your damnation dawns ; the time has come ; the day of trouble nears . It is a day of shouts of anguish , not shouts of joy ! 8-9 Soon I will pour out my fury and let it finish its work of punishing you for all your evil deeds . I will not spare nor pity you , and you will know that I , the Lord , am doing it . 10-11 The day of judgment has come ; the morning dawns , for your wickedness and pride have run their course and reached their climax—none of these rich and wicked men of pride shall live . All your boasting will die away , and no one will be left to bewail your fate .
TLB	Ezekiel	7	2	“ Tell Israel , ‘ Wherever you look—east , west , north , or south—your land is finished .
TLB	Ezekiel	7	3	No hope remains , for I will loose my anger on you for your worshiping of idols .
TLB	Ezekiel	7	4	I will turn my eyes away and show no pity ; I will repay you in full , and you shall know I am the Lord. ’ ” 5-6 The Lord God says : “ With one blow after another I will finish you . The end has come ; your final doom is waiting .
TLB	Ezekiel	7	12	“ Yes , the time has come ; the day draws near . There will be nothing to buy or sell , for the wrath of God is on the land .
TLB	Ezekiel	7	13	And even if a merchant lives , his business will be gone , for God has spoken against all the people of Israel ; all will be destroyed . Not one of those whose lives are filled with sin will recover .
TLB	Ezekiel	7	14	“ The trumpets shout to Israel ’ s army , ‘ Mobilize ! ’ but no one listens , for my wrath is on them all .
TLB	Ezekiel	7	15	If you go outside the walls , there stands the enemy to kill you . If you stay inside , famine and disease will devour you .
TLB	Ezekiel	7	16	Any who escape will be lonely as mourning doves hiding on the mountains , each weeping for his sins .
TLB	Ezekiel	7	17	All hands shall be feeble , and all knees as weak as water .
TLB	Ezekiel	7	18	You shall clothe yourselves with sackcloth , and horror and shame shall cover you ; you shall shave your heads in sorrow and remorse .
TLB	Ezekiel	7	19	“ Throw away your money ! Toss it out like worthless rubbish , for it will have no value in that day of wrath . It will neither satisfy nor feed you , for your love of money is the reason for your sin .
TLB	Ezekiel	7	20	I gave you gold to use in decorating the Temple , and you used it instead to make idols ! Therefore , I will take it all away from you .
TLB	Ezekiel	7	21	I will give it to foreigners and to wicked men as booty . They shall defile my Temple .
TLB	Ezekiel	7	22	I will not look when they defile it , nor will I stop them . Like robbers , they will loot the treasures and leave the Temple in ruins .
TLB	Ezekiel	7	23	“ Prepare chains for my people , for the land is full of bloody crimes . Jerusalem is filled with violence , so I will enslave her people .
TLB	Ezekiel	7	24	I will crush your pride by bringing to Jerusalem the worst of the nations to occupy your homes , break down your fortifications you are so proud of , and defile your Temple .
TLB	Ezekiel	7	25	For the time has come for the cutting off of Israel . You will sue for peace , but you won ’ t get it . 26-27 Calamity upon calamity will befall you ; woe upon woe , disaster upon disaster ! You will long for a prophet to guide you , but the priests and elders and the kings and princes will stand helpless , weeping in despair . The people will tremble with fear , for I will do to them the evil they have done and give them all their just deserts . They shall learn that I am the Lord. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Ezekiel	8	8	“ Now dig into the wall , ” he said . I did and uncovered a door to a hidden room .
TLB	Ezekiel	8	2	I saw what appeared to be a Man ; from his waist down , he was made of fire ; from his waist up , he was all amber-colored brightness .
TLB	Ezekiel	8	3	He put out what seemed to be a hand and took me by the hair . And the Spirit lifted me up into the sky and seemed to transport me to Jerusalem , to the entrance of the north gate , where the large idol was that had made the Lord so angry .
TLB	Ezekiel	8	4	Suddenly the glory of the God of Israel was there , just as I had seen it before in the valley .
TLB	Ezekiel	8	5	He said to me , “ Son of dust , look toward the north. ” So I looked and , sure enough , north of the altar gate in the entrance stood the idol .
TLB	Ezekiel	8	6	And he said : “ Son of dust , do you see what they are doing ? Do you see what great sins the people of Israel are doing here , to push me from my Temple ? But come , and I will show you greater sins than these ! ”
TLB	Ezekiel	8	7	Then he brought me to the door of the Temple court , where I could see an opening in the wall .
TLB	Ezekiel	8	9	“ Go in , ” he said , “ and see the wickedness going on in there ! ”
TLB	Ezekiel	8	10	So I went in . The walls were covered with pictures of all kinds of snakes , lizards , and hideous creatures , besides all the various idols worshiped by the people of Israel .
TLB	Ezekiel	8	11	Seventy elders of Israel were standing there along with Jaazaniah ( son of Shaphan ) worshiping the pictures . Each of them held a censer of burning incense , so there was a thick cloud of smoke above their heads .
TLB	Ezekiel	8	12	Then the Lord said to me : “ Son of dust , have you seen what the elders of Israel are doing in their minds ? For they say , ‘ The Lord doesn ’ t see us ; he has gone away ! ’ ”
TLB	Ezekiel	8	13	Then he added , “ Come , and I will show you greater sins than these ! ”
TLB	Ezekiel	8	14	He brought me to the north gate of the Temple , and there sat women weeping for Tammuz , [ b ] their god .
TLB	Ezekiel	8	15	“ Have you seen this ? ” he asked . “ But I will show you greater evils than these ! ”
TLB	Ezekiel	8	16	Then he brought me into the inner court of the Temple , and there at the door , between the porch and the bronze altar , were about twenty-five men standing with their backs to the Temple of the Lord , facing east , worshiping the sun !
TLB	Ezekiel	8	17	“ Have you seen this ? ” he asked . “ Is it nothing to the people of Judah that they commit these terrible sins , leading the whole nation into idolatry , thumbing their noses at me and arousing my fury against them ?
TLB	Ezekiel	8	18	Therefore , I will deal with them in fury . I will neither pity nor spare . And though they scream for mercy , I will not listen. ” Footnotes - Ezekiel 8:1 of the sixth year of King Jehoiachin ’ s captivity , implied . - Ezekiel 8:14 there sat women weeping for Tammuz . The women wept for Tammuz , the god of fertility , because , according to Mesopotamian myths , he had been killed , and fertility had vanished with him . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Ezekiel	9	9	But he said to me , “ The sins of the people of Israel and Judah are very great and all the land is full of murder and injustice , for they say , ‘ The Lord doesn ’ t see it ! He has gone away ! ’
TLB	Ezekiel	9	2	Six men appeared at his call , coming from the upper north gate , each one with his sword . One of them wore linen clothing and carried a writer ’ s case strapped to his side . They all went into the Temple and stood beside the bronze altar .
TLB	Ezekiel	9	3	And the glory of the God of Israel rose from between the Guardian Angels where it had rested and stood above the entrance to [ a ] the Temple . And the Lord called to the man with the writer ’ s case
TLB	Ezekiel	9	4	and said to him , “ Walk through the streets of Jerusalem and put a mark on the foreheads of the men who weep and sigh because of all the sins they see around them. ”
TLB	Ezekiel	9	5	Then I heard the Lord tell the other men : “ Follow him through the city and kill everyone whose forehead isn ’ t marked . Spare not nor pity them—
TLB	Ezekiel	9	6	kill them all—old and young , girls , women , and little children ; but don ’ t touch anyone with the mark . And begin right here at the Temple. ” And so they began by killing the seventy elders .
TLB	Ezekiel	9	7	And he said , “ Defile the Temple ! Fill its courts with the bodies of those you kill ! Go ! ” And they went out through the city and did as they were told .
TLB	Ezekiel	9	8	While they were fulfilling their orders , I was alone . I fell to the ground on my face and cried out : “ O Lord God ! Will your fury against Jerusalem wipe out everyone left in Israel ? ”
TLB	Ezekiel	9	10	And so I will not spare them nor have any pity on them , and I will fully repay them for all that they have done. ”
TLB	Ezekiel	9	11	Just then the man in linen clothing , carrying the writer ’ s case , reported back and said , “ I have finished the work you gave me to do. ” Footnotes - Ezekiel 9:3 above the entrance to , literally , “ above the threshold of. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Ezekiel	10	10	Suddenly a throne of beautiful blue sapphire [ a ] appeared in the sky above the heads of the Guardian Angels .
TLB	Ezekiel	10	2	Then the Lord spoke to the man in linen clothing and said : “ Go in between the whirling wheels beneath the Guardian Angels , and take a handful of glowing coals and scatter them over the city. ” He did so while I watched .
TLB	Ezekiel	10	3	The Guardian Angels were standing at the south end of the Temple when the man went in . And the cloud of glory filled the inner court .
TLB	Ezekiel	10	4	Then the glory of the Lord rose from above the Guardian Angels and went over to the door of the Temple . The Temple was filled with the cloud of glory , and the court of the Temple was filled with the brightness of the glory of the Lord .
TLB	Ezekiel	10	5	And the sound of the wings of the Guardian Angels was as the voice of Almighty God when he speaks and could be heard clear out in the outer court .
TLB	Ezekiel	10	6	When the Lord told the man in linen clothing to go between the Guardian Angels and take some burning coals from between the wheels , the man went in and stood beside one of the wheels , 7-8 and one of the Guardian Angels reached out his hand ( for each of the mighty Angels had , beneath his wings , what looked like human hands ) and took some live coals from the flames between the Angels and put them into the hands of the man in linen clothes , who took them and went out . 9-13 Each of the four Guardian Angels had a wheel beside him— “ The Whirl-Wheels , ” as I heard them called , for each one had a second wheel crosswise within—sparkling like chrysolite , giving off a greenish yellow glow . Because of the construction of these wheels , [ b ] the Angels could go straight forward in each of four directions ; they did not turn when they changed direction but could go in any of the four ways their faces looked . Each of the four wheels was covered with eyes , including the rims and spokes .
TLB	Ezekiel	10	14	Each of the four Guardian Angels had four faces—the first was that of an ox ; [ c ] the second , a man ’ s ; the third , a lion ’ s ; and the fourth , an eagle ’ s . 15-16 These were the same beings I had seen beside the Chebar Canal , and when they rose into the air , the wheels rose with them and stayed beside them as they flew .
TLB	Ezekiel	10	17	When the Guardian Angels stood still , so did the wheels , for the spirit of the Guardian Angels was in the wheels . [ d ]
TLB	Ezekiel	10	18	Then the glory of the Lord moved from the door of the Temple and stood above the Guardian Angels .
TLB	Ezekiel	10	19	And as I watched , the Guardian Angels flew with their wheels beside them to the east gate of the Temple . And the glory of the God of Israel was above them .
TLB	Ezekiel	10	20	These were the living beings I had seen beneath the God of Israel beside the Chebar Canal . I knew they were the same ,
TLB	Ezekiel	10	21	for each had four faces and four wings , with what looked like human hands under their wings .
TLB	Ezekiel	10	22	Their faces too were identical to the faces of those I had seen at the canal , and they traveled straight ahead , just as the others did . Footnotes - Ezekiel 10:1 blue sapphire , literally , “ lapis lazuli. ” Guardian Angels , literally , “ cherubim. ” - Ezekiel 10:9 Because of the construction of these wheels , implied . - Ezekiel 10:14 an ox , literally , “ a cherub ’ s face ” ; see 1:10 . - Ezekiel 10:17 for the spirit of the Guardian Angels was in the wheels . That is , the wheel was a living part of the bodies of the cherubim . Hence it could not be separated from the cherubim . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Ezekiel	11	11	No , this city will not be an iron shield for you , and you safe within . I will chase you even to the borders of Israel ,
TLB	Ezekiel	11	3	For they say to the people , ‘ It is time to rebuild Jerusalem , for our city is an iron shield and will protect us from all harm. ’ [ a ]
TLB	Ezekiel	11	4	Therefore , son of dust , prophesy against them loudly and clearly. ”
TLB	Ezekiel	11	5	Then the Spirit of the Lord came upon me and told me to say : “ The Lord says to the people of Israel : Is that what you are saying ? Yes , I know it is , for I know everything you think—every thought that comes into your minds .
TLB	Ezekiel	11	6	You have murdered endlessly and filled your streets with the dead. ”
TLB	Ezekiel	11	7	Therefore the Lord God says : “ You think this city is an iron shield ? No , it isn ’ t ! It will not protect you . Your slain will lie within it , but you will be dragged out and slaughtered . [ b ]
TLB	Ezekiel	11	8	I will expose you to the war you have so greatly feared , says the Lord God ,
TLB	Ezekiel	11	9	and I will take you from Jerusalem and hand you over to foreigners who will carry out my judgments against you .
TLB	Ezekiel	11	10	You will be slaughtered all the way to the borders of Israel , and you will know I am the Lord .
TLB	Ezekiel	11	12	and you will know I am the Lord—you who have not obeyed me but rather have copied the nations all around you. ”
TLB	Ezekiel	11	13	While I was still speaking and telling them this , Pelatiah ( son of Benaiah ) suddenly died . Then I fell to the ground on my face and cried out : “ O Lord God , are you going to kill everyone in all Israel ? ”
TLB	Ezekiel	11	14	Again a message came from the Lord :
TLB	Ezekiel	11	15	“ Son of dust , the remnant left in Jerusalem are saying about your brother exiles : ‘ It is because they were so wicked that the Lord has deported them . Now the Lord has given us their land ! ’
TLB	Ezekiel	11	16	“ But tell the exiles that the Lord God says : Although I have scattered you in the countries of the world , yet I will be a sanctuary to you for the time that you are there ,
TLB	Ezekiel	11	17	and I will gather you back from the nations where you are scattered and give you the land of Israel again .
TLB	Ezekiel	11	18	And when you return , you will remove every trace of all this idol worship .
TLB	Ezekiel	11	19	I will give you one heart and a new spirit ; I will take from you your hearts of stone and give you tender hearts of love for God ,
TLB	Ezekiel	11	20	so that you can obey my laws and be my people , and I will be your God .
TLB	Ezekiel	11	21	But as for those now in Jerusalem [ c ] who long for idols , I will repay them fully for their sins , ” the Lord God says .
TLB	Ezekiel	11	22	Then the Guardian Angels lifted their wings and rose into the air with their wheels beside them , and the glory of the God of Israel stood above them .
TLB	Ezekiel	11	23	Then the glory of the Lord rose from over the city and stood above the mountain on the east side .
TLB	Ezekiel	11	24	Afterwards the Spirit of God carried me back again to Babylon , to the Jews in exile there . And so ended the vision of my visit to Jerusalem .
TLB	Ezekiel	11	25	And I told the exiles everything the Lord had shown me . Footnotes - Ezekiel 11:3 for our city is an iron shield and will protect us from all harm , literally , “ this city the caldron and we the flesh. ” - Ezekiel 11:7 Your slain will lie within it , but you will be dragged out and slaughtered , literally , “ Your slain are the flesh and this is the caldron , but you will be brought out from it. ” - Ezekiel 11:21 But as for those now in Jerusalem , implied .

TLB	Ezekiel	12	12	“ Even King Zedekiah shall go out at night through a hole in the wall , taking only what he can carry with him , with muffled face , for he won ’ t be able to see . [ b ]
TLB	Ezekiel	12	2	“ Son of dust , ” he said , “ you live among rebels who could know the truth if they wanted to , but they don ’ t want to ; they could hear me if they would listen , but they won ’ t ,
TLB	Ezekiel	12	3	for they are rebels . So now put on a demonstration to show them what being exiled will be like . Pack whatever you can carry on your back and leave your home—go somewhere else . Go in the daylight so they can see , for perhaps even yet they will consider what this means , even though they are such rebels .
TLB	Ezekiel	12	4	Bring your baggage outside your house during the daylight so they can watch . Then leave the house at night , just as captives do when they begin their long march to distant lands .
TLB	Ezekiel	12	5	Dig a tunnel through the city wall while they are observing and carry your possessions out through the hole .
TLB	Ezekiel	12	6	As they watch , lift your pack to your shoulders and walk away into the night ; muffle your face and don ’ t gaze around . All this is a sign to the people of Israel of the evil that will come upon Jerusalem. ”
TLB	Ezekiel	12	7	So I did as I was told . I brought my pack outside in the daylight—all I could take into exile—and in the evening I dug through the wall with my hands . I went out into the darkness with my pack on my shoulder while the people looked on .
TLB	Ezekiel	12	8	The next morning this message came to me from the Lord :
TLB	Ezekiel	12	9	“ Son of dust , these rebels , the people of Israel , have asked what all this means .
TLB	Ezekiel	12	10	Tell them the Lord God says it is a message to King Zedekiah [ a ] in Jerusalem and to all the people of Israel .
TLB	Ezekiel	12	11	Explain that what you did was a demonstration of what is going to happen to them , for they shall be driven out of their homes and sent away into exile .

TLB	Ezekiel	12	15	And when I scatter them among the nations , then they shall know I am the Lord .
TLB	Ezekiel	12	16	But I will spare a few of them from death by war and famine and disease . I will save them to confess to the nations how wicked they have been , and they shall know I am the Lord. ”
TLB	Ezekiel	12	17	Then this message came to me from the Lord :
TLB	Ezekiel	12	18	“ Son of dust , tremble as you eat your meals ; ration out your water as though it were your last ,
TLB	Ezekiel	12	19	and say to the people , the Lord God says that the people of Israel and Jerusalem shall ration their food with utmost care and sip their tiny portions of water in utter despair because of all their sins .
TLB	Ezekiel	12	20	Your cities shall be destroyed and your farmlands deserted , and you shall know I am the Lord. ”
TLB	Ezekiel	12	21	Again a message came to me from the Lord :
TLB	Ezekiel	12	22	“ Son of dust , what is that proverb they quote in Israel— ‘ The days as they pass make liars out of every prophet. ’
TLB	Ezekiel	12	23	The Lord God says : I will put an end to this proverb and they will soon stop saying it . Give them this one instead : ‘ The time has come for all these prophecies to be fulfilled. ’
TLB	Ezekiel	12	24	“ Then you will see what becomes of all the false predictions of safety and security for Jerusalem .
TLB	Ezekiel	12	25	For I am the Lord ! What I threaten always happens . There will be no more delays , O rebels of Israel ! I will do it in your own lifetime ! ” says the Lord God .
TLB	Ezekiel	12	26	Then this message came :
TLB	Ezekiel	12	27	“ Son of dust , the people of Israel say , ‘ His visions won ’ t come true for a long , long time. ’
TLB	Ezekiel	12	28	Therefore say to them : ‘ The Lord God says : All delay has ended !

TLB	Ezekiel	13	13	Yes , it will surely fall. ” The Lord God says : “ I will sweep it away with a storm of indignation , with a great flood of anger , and with hailstones of wrath .
TLB	Ezekiel	13	4	“ O Israel , these ‘ prophets ’ of yours are as useless as foxes for rebuilding your walls !
TLB	Ezekiel	13	5	O evil prophets , what have you ever done to strengthen the walls of Israel against her enemies—by strengthening Israel in the Lord ?
TLB	Ezekiel	13	6	Instead you have lied when you said , ‘ My message is from God ! ’ God did not send you . And yet you expect him to fulfill your prophecies .
TLB	Ezekiel	13	7	Can you deny that you have claimed to see ‘ visions ’ you never saw , and that you have said , ‘ This message is from God , ’ when I never spoke to you at all ? ”
TLB	Ezekiel	13	8	Therefore the Lord God says : “ I will destroy you for these ‘ visions ’ and lies .
TLB	Ezekiel	13	9	My hand shall be against you , and you shall be cut off from among the leaders of Israel ; I will blot out your names , and you will never see your own country again . And you shall know I am the Lord .
TLB	Ezekiel	13	10	For these evil men deceive my people by saying , ‘ God will send peace , ’ when that is not my plan at all ! My people build a flimsy wall , and these prophets praise them for it—and cover it with whitewash !
TLB	Ezekiel	13	11	“ Tell these evil builders that their wall will fall . A heavy rainstorm will undermine it ; great hailstones and mighty winds will knock it down .
TLB	Ezekiel	13	12	And when the wall falls , the people will cry out , ‘ Why didn ’ t you tell us that it wasn ’ t good enough ? Why did you whitewash it and cover up its faults ? ’
TLB	Ezekiel	13	14	I will break down your whitewashed wall ; it will fall on you and crush you , and you shall know I am the Lord .
TLB	Ezekiel	13	15	Then at last my wrath against the wall will be completed ; and concerning those who praised it , I will say : The wall and its builders both are gone .
TLB	Ezekiel	13	16	For they were lying prophets , claiming Jerusalem will have peace when there is no peace , ” says the Lord God .
TLB	Ezekiel	13	17	“ Son of dust , speak out against the women prophets too who pretend the Lord has given them his messages .
TLB	Ezekiel	13	18	Tell them , ‘ The Lord God says : Woe to these women who are damning the souls of my people , of both young and old alike , by tying magic charms on their wrists , furnishing them with magic veils , and selling them indulgences . They refuse to even offer help unless they get a profit from it . [ a ]
TLB	Ezekiel	13	19	For the sake of a few paltry handfuls of barley or a piece of bread will you turn away my people from me ? You have led those to death who should not die ! And you have promised life to those who should not live by lying to my people—and how they love it ! ’ ”
TLB	Ezekiel	13	20	And so the Lord says : “ I will crush you because you hunt my people ’ s souls with all your magic charms . I will tear off the charms and set my people free like birds from cages .
TLB	Ezekiel	13	21	I will tear off the magic veils and save my people from you ; they will no longer be your victims , and you shall know I am the Lord .
TLB	Ezekiel	13	22	Your lies have discouraged the righteous when I didn ’ t want it so . And you have encouraged the wicked by promising life , though they continue in their sins .
TLB	Ezekiel	13	23	But you will lie no more ; no longer will you talk of seeing ‘ visions ’ that you never saw nor practice your magic , for I will deliver my people out of your hands by destroying you , and you shall know I am the Lord. ” Footnotes - Ezekiel 13:18 They refuse to even offer help unless they get a profit from it , literally , “ Will you hunt the souls of my people and save your own souls alive ? ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Ezekiel	14	14	Even if Noah , Daniel , and Job were in it , they alone would be saved by their righteousness , and I would destroy the remainder of Israel , ” says the Lord God .
TLB	Ezekiel	14	2	and this is the message that came to me to give to them :
TLB	Ezekiel	14	3	“ Son of dust , these men worship idols in their hearts—should I let them ask me anything ?
TLB	Ezekiel	14	4	Tell them , ‘ The Lord God says : I , the Lord , will personally deal with anyone in Israel who worships idols and then comes to ask my help .
TLB	Ezekiel	14	5	For I will punish the minds and hearts of those who turn from me to idols. ’ 6-7 “ Therefore , warn them that the Lord God says : ‘ Repent and destroy your idols , and stop worshiping them in your hearts . I the Lord will personally punish everyone , whether people of Israel or the foreigners living among you , who rejects me for idols and then comes to a prophet to ask for my help and advice .
TLB	Ezekiel	14	8	I will turn upon him and make a terrible example of him , destroying him ; and you shall know I am the Lord .
TLB	Ezekiel	14	9	And if one of the false prophets gives him a message anyway , it is a lie . His prophecy will not come true , and I will stand against that “ prophet ” and destroy him from among my people Israel .
TLB	Ezekiel	14	10	False prophets and hypocrites—evil people who say they want my words—all will be punished for their sins ,
TLB	Ezekiel	14	11	so that the people of Israel will learn not to desert me and not to be polluted any longer with sin . They will be my people and I their God. ’ So says the Lord. ”
TLB	Ezekiel	14	12	Then this message of the Lord came to me :
TLB	Ezekiel	14	13	“ Son of dust , if the people of a land sin against me , then I will crush them with my fist , break off their food supply , and send famine to destroy both man and beast .
TLB	Ezekiel	14	15	“ If I send an invasion of dangerous wild animals into the land to devastate the land ,
TLB	Ezekiel	14	16	even if these three men were there , the Lord God swears that it would do no good—it would not save the people from their doom . Those three only would be saved , but the land would be devastated .
TLB	Ezekiel	14	17	“ Or if I bring war against that land and tell the armies of the enemy to come and destroy everything ,
TLB	Ezekiel	14	18	even if these three men were in the land , the Lord God declares that they alone would be saved .
TLB	Ezekiel	14	19	“ And if I pour out my fury by sending an epidemic of disease into the land , and the plague kills man and beast alike ,
TLB	Ezekiel	14	20	though Noah , Daniel , and Job were living there , the Lord God says that only they would be saved because of their righteousness. ”
TLB	Ezekiel	14	21	And the Lord says : “ Four great punishments await Jerusalem to destroy all life : war , famine , ferocious beasts , plague .
TLB	Ezekiel	14	22	If there are survivors and they come here to join you as exiles in Babylon , you will see with your own eyes how wicked they are , and you will know it was right for me to destroy Jerusalem .
TLB	Ezekiel	14	23	You will agree , when you meet them , that it is not without cause that all these things are being done to Israel. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Ezekiel	15	2	“ Son of dust , what good are vines from the forest ? Are they as useful as trees ? Are they even as valuable as a single branch ?
TLB	Ezekiel	15	3	No , for vines can ’ t be used even for making pegs to hang up pots and pans !
TLB	Ezekiel	15	4	All they are good for is fuel—and even so , they burn but poorly ! 5-6 So they are useless both before and after being put in the fire ! “ This is what I mean , ” the Lord God says : “ The people of Jerusalem are like the vines of the forest—useless before being burned and certainly useless afterwards !
TLB	Ezekiel	15	7	And I will set myself against them to see to it that if they escape from one fire , they will fall into another ; and then you shall know I am the Lord .

TLB	Ezekiel	16	16	You used the lovely things I gave you for making idol shrines and to decorate your bed of prostitution . Unbelievable ! There has never been anything like it before !
TLB	Ezekiel	16	2	“ Son of dust , ” he said , “ speak to Jerusalem about her loathsome sins .
TLB	Ezekiel	16	3	Tell her , ‘ The Lord God says : You are no better than the people of Canaan—your father must have been an Amorite and your mother a Hittite ! [ a ]
TLB	Ezekiel	16	4	When you were born , no one cared for you . When I first saw you , your umbilical cord was uncut , and you had been neither washed nor rubbed with salt nor clothed .
TLB	Ezekiel	16	5	No one had the slightest interest in you ; no one pitied you or cared for you . On that day when you were born , you were dumped out into a field and left to die , unwanted . 6-7 “ ‘ But I came by and saw you there , covered with your own blood , and I said , “ Live ! Thrive like a plant in the field ! ” And you did ! You grew up and became tall , slender and supple , a jewel among jewels . And when you reached the age of maidenhood , your breasts were full-formed and your pubic hair had grown ; yet you were naked .
TLB	Ezekiel	16	8	“ ‘ Later , when I passed by and saw you again , you were old enough for marriage ; and I wrapped my cloak around you to legally declare my marriage vow . I signed a covenant with you , and you became mine . 9-10 Then , when the marriage had taken place , I gave you beautiful clothes of linens and silk , embroidered , and sandals made of dolphin hide .
TLB	Ezekiel	16	11	I gave you lovely ornaments , bracelets , and beautiful necklaces ,
TLB	Ezekiel	16	12	a ring for your nose and two more for your ears , and a lovely tiara for your head .
TLB	Ezekiel	16	13	And so you were made beautiful with gold and silver , and your clothes were silk and linen and beautifully embroidered . You ate the finest foods and became more beautiful than ever . You looked like a queen , and so you were !
TLB	Ezekiel	16	14	Your reputation was great among the nations for your beauty ; it was perfect because of all the gifts I gave you , ’ ” says the Lord God .
TLB	Ezekiel	16	15	“ ‘ But you thought you could get along without me—you trusted in your beauty instead ; and you gave yourself as a prostitute to every man who came along . Your beauty was his for the asking .
TLB	Ezekiel	16	17	You took the very jewels and gold and silver ornaments I gave to you and made statues of men and worshiped them , which is adultery against me .
TLB	Ezekiel	16	18	You used the beautifully embroidered clothes I gave you—to cover your idols ! And used my oil and incense to worship them !
TLB	Ezekiel	16	19	You set before them as a lovely sacrifice—imagine it—the fine flour and oil and honey I gave you !
TLB	Ezekiel	16	20	And you took my sons and daughters you had borne to me and sacrificed them to your gods ; and they are gone . Wasn ’ t it enough that you should be a prostitute ?
TLB	Ezekiel	16	21	Must you also slay my children by sacrificing them to idols ?
TLB	Ezekiel	16	22	“ ‘ And in all these years of adultery and sin you have not thought of those days long ago when you were naked and covered with blood .
TLB	Ezekiel	16	23	“ ‘ And then , in addition to all your other wickedness—woe , woe upon you , says the Lord God—
TLB	Ezekiel	16	24	you built a spacious brothel for your lovers and idol altars on every street ,
TLB	Ezekiel	16	25	and there you offered your beauty to every man who came by , in an endless stream of prostitution .
TLB	Ezekiel	16	26	And you added lustful Egypt to your prostitutions by your alliance with her . My anger is great .
TLB	Ezekiel	16	27	“ ‘ Therefore I have crushed you with my fist ; I have reduced your boundaries and delivered you into the hands of those who hate you—the Philistines—and even they are ashamed of you .
TLB	Ezekiel	16	28	“ ‘ You have committed adultery with the Assyrians too by making them your allies and worshiping their gods ; [ b ] it seems that you can never find enough new gods . After your adultery there , you still weren ’ t satisfied ,
TLB	Ezekiel	16	29	so you worshiped the gods of that great merchant land of Babylon—and you still weren ’ t satisfied .
TLB	Ezekiel	16	30	What a filthy heart you have , says the Lord God , to do such things as these ; you are a brazen prostitute ,
TLB	Ezekiel	16	31	building your idol altars , your brothels , on every street . You have been worse than a prostitute , so eager for sin that you have not even charged for your love !
TLB	Ezekiel	16	32	Yes , you are an adulterous wife who lives with other men instead of her own husband . 33-34 Prostitutes charge for their services—men pay with many gifts . But not you , you give them gifts , bribing them to come to you ! So you are different from other prostitutes . But you had to pay them , for no one wanted you .
TLB	Ezekiel	16	35	“ ‘ O prostitute , hear the word of the Lord :
TLB	Ezekiel	16	36	This is what the Lord God says ! Because I see your filthy sins , your adultery with your lovers—your worshiping of idols—and the slaying of your children as sacrifices to your gods ,
TLB	Ezekiel	16	37	this is what I am going to do : I will gather together all your allies—these lovers of yours you have sinned with , both those you loved and those you hated—and I will make you naked before them that they may see you .
TLB	Ezekiel	16	38	I will punish you as a murderess is punished and as a woman breaking wedlock living with other men .
TLB	Ezekiel	16	39	I will give you to your lovers—these many nations—to destroy , and they will knock down your brothels and idol altars . They will strip you , take your beautiful jewels , and leave you naked and ashamed . 40-41 They will burn your homes , punishing you before the eyes of many women . And I will see to it that you stop your adulteries with other gods and end your payments to your allies for their love .
TLB	Ezekiel	16	42	“ ‘ Then at last my fury against you will die away ; my jealousy against you will end , and I will be quiet and not be angry with you anymore .
TLB	Ezekiel	16	43	But first , because you have not remembered your youth but have angered me by all these evil things you do , I will fully repay you for all of your sins , ’ ” says the Lord . “ ‘ For you are thankless in addition to all your other faults .
TLB	Ezekiel	16	44	“ ‘ “ Like mother , like daughter ” —that is what everyone will say of you .
TLB	Ezekiel	16	45	For your mother loathed her husband and her children , and you do too . And you are exactly like your sisters , for they despised their husbands and their children . Truly , your mother must have been a Hittite and your father an Amorite .
TLB	Ezekiel	16	46	“ ‘ Your older sister is Samaria , living with her daughters north of you ; your younger sister is Sodom and her daughters , in the south .
TLB	Ezekiel	16	47	You have not merely sinned as they do—no , that was nothing to you ; in a very short time you far surpassed them .
TLB	Ezekiel	16	48	“ ‘ As I live , the Lord God says , Sodom and her daughters have never been as wicked as you and your daughters .
TLB	Ezekiel	16	49	Your sister Sodom ’ s sins were pride , laziness , and too much food , while the poor and needy suffered outside her door .
TLB	Ezekiel	16	50	She insolently worshiped many idols as I watched . Therefore I crushed her .
TLB	Ezekiel	16	51	“ ‘ Even Samaria has not committed half your sins . You have worshiped idols far more than your sisters have ; they seem almost righteous in comparison with you !
TLB	Ezekiel	16	52	Don ’ t be surprised then by the lighter punishment they get . For your sins are so awful that in comparison with you , your sisters seem innocent !
TLB	Ezekiel	16	53	( But someday I will restore the fortunes of Sodom and Samaria again , and those of Judah too . )
TLB	Ezekiel	16	54	Your terrible punishment will be a consolation to them , for it will be greater than theirs .
TLB	Ezekiel	16	55	“ ‘ Yes , your sisters , Sodom and Samaria , and all their people will be restored again , and Judah , too , will prosper in that day .
TLB	Ezekiel	16	56	In your proud days you held Sodom in unspeakable contempt .
TLB	Ezekiel	16	57	But now your greater wickedness has been exposed to all the world , and you are the one who is scorned—by Edom and all her neighbors and by all the Philistines .
TLB	Ezekiel	16	58	This is part of your punishment for all your sins , ’ ” says the Lord . 59-60 For the Lord God says : “ I will repay you for your broken promises . You lightly broke your solemn vows to me , yet I will keep the pledge I made to you when you were young . I will establish an everlasting covenant with you forever ,
TLB	Ezekiel	16	61	and you will remember with shame all the evil you have done ; and you will be overcome by my favor when I take your sisters , Samaria and Sodom , and make them your daughters , for you to rule over . You will know you don ’ t deserve this gracious act , for you did not keep my covenant .
TLB	Ezekiel	16	62	I will reaffirm my covenant with you , and you will know I am the Lord .
TLB	Ezekiel	16	63	Despite all you have done , I will be kind to you again ; you will cover your mouth in silence and in shame when I forgive you all that you have done , ” says the Lord God .

TLB	Ezekiel	17	17	Pharaoh and all his mighty army shall fail to help Israel when the king of Babylon lays siege to Jerusalem again and slaughters many lives .
TLB	Ezekiel	17	2	“ Son of dust , give this riddle to the people of Israel : 3-4 “ A great eagle with broad wings full of many-colored feathers came to Lebanon and plucked off the shoot at the top of the tallest cedar tree and carried it into a city filled with merchants .
TLB	Ezekiel	17	5	There he planted it [ a ] in fertile ground beside a broad river , where it would grow as quickly as a willow tree .
TLB	Ezekiel	17	6	It took root and grew and became a low but spreading vine that turned toward the eagle and produced strong branches and luxuriant leaves .
TLB	Ezekiel	17	7	But when another great , broad-winged , full-feathered eagle came along , this tree sent its roots and branches out toward him instead ,
TLB	Ezekiel	17	8	even though it was already in good soil with plenty of water to become a splendid vine , producing leaves and fruit. ”
TLB	Ezekiel	17	9	The Lord God asks : “ Shall I let this tree grow and prosper ? No ! I will pull it out , roots and all ! I will cut off its branches and let its leaves wither and die . It will pull out easily enough—it won ’ t take a big crew or a lot of equipment to do that .
TLB	Ezekiel	17	10	Though the vine began so well , will it thrive ? No , it will wither away completely when the east wind touches it , dying in the same choice soil where it had grown so well. ”
TLB	Ezekiel	17	11	Then this message came to me from the Lord : 12-13 “ Ask these rebels of Israel : Don ’ t you understand what this riddle of the eagles means ? I will tell you . Nebuchadnezzar , king of Babylon ( the first of the two eagles ) , [ b ] came to Jerusalem , took away her king and princes ( her topmost buds and shoots ) , and brought them to Babylon . Nebuchadnezzar made a covenant with a member of the royal family ( Zedekiah ) , and made him take an oath of loyalty . He took a seedling and planted it in fertile ground beside a broad river . He also exiled the top men of Israel ’ s government ,
TLB	Ezekiel	17	14	so that Israel would not be strong again and revolt . But by keeping her promises , Israel could be respected and maintain her identity .
TLB	Ezekiel	17	15	“ Nevertheless , Zedekiah rebelled against Babylon , sending ambassadors to Egypt to seek for a great army and many horses to fight against Nebuchadnezzar . But will Israel prosper after breaking all her promises like that ? Will she succeed ?
TLB	Ezekiel	17	16	. The Living Bible copyright ©
TLB	Ezekiel	17	18	For the king of Israel broke his promise after swearing to obey ; therefore he shall not escape. ”
TLB	Ezekiel	17	19	The Lord God says : “ As I live , surely I will punish him for despising the solemn oath he made in my name .
TLB	Ezekiel	17	20	I will throw my net over him , and he shall be captured in my snare ; I will bring him to Babylon and deal with him there for this treason against me .
TLB	Ezekiel	17	21	And all the best soldiers of Israel will be killed by the sword , and those remaining in the city will be scattered to the four winds . Then you will know that I , the Lord , have spoken these words. ” 22-23 The Lord God says : “ I will take a tender sprout from the top of a tall cedar , and I will plant it on the top of Israel ’ s highest mountain . It shall become a noble cedar , bringing forth branches and bearing seed . Animals of every sort will gather under it ; its branches will shelter every kind of bird .
TLB	Ezekiel	17	24	And everyone shall know that it is I , the Lord , who cuts down the high trees and exalts the low , that I make the green tree wither and the dead tree grow .

TLB	Ezekiel	18	18	But his father shall die for his own sins because he is cruel and robs and does wrong .
TLB	Ezekiel	18	2	“ Why do people use this proverb about the land of Israel : The children are punished for their fathers ’ sins ? [ a ]
TLB	Ezekiel	18	3	As I live , ” says the Lord God , “ you will not use this proverb anymore in Israel ,
TLB	Ezekiel	18	4	for all souls are mine to judge—fathers and sons alike—and my rule is this : It is for a man ’ s own sins that he will die .
TLB	Ezekiel	18	5	“ But if a man is just and does what is lawful and right ,
TLB	Ezekiel	18	6	and has not gone out to the mountains to feast before the idols of Israel and worship them , and does not commit adultery nor lie with any woman during the time of her menstruation ;
TLB	Ezekiel	18	7	if he is a merciful creditor , not holding onto the items given to him in pledge by poor debtors , and is no robber but gives food to the hungry and clothes to those in need ;
TLB	Ezekiel	18	8	and if he grants loans without interest , [ b ] stays away from sin , is honest and fair when judging others ,
TLB	Ezekiel	18	9	and obeys my laws—that man is just , ” says the Lord , “ and he shall surely live .
TLB	Ezekiel	18	10	“ But if that man has a son who is a robber or murderer and who fulfills none of his responsibilities ,
TLB	Ezekiel	18	11	who refuses to obey the laws of God but worships idols on the mountains and commits adultery ,
TLB	Ezekiel	18	12	oppresses the poor and helpless , robs his debtors by refusing to let them redeem what they have given him in pledge , loves idols and worships them ,
TLB	Ezekiel	18	13	and loans out his money at interest [ c ] —shall that man live ? No ! He shall surely die , and it is his own fault .
TLB	Ezekiel	18	14	“ But if this sinful man has , in turn , a son who sees all his father ’ s wickedness , so that he fears God and decides against that kind of life ;
TLB	Ezekiel	18	15	he doesn ’ t go up on the mountains to feast before the idols and worship them and does not commit adultery ;
TLB	Ezekiel	18	16	he is fair to those who borrow from him and doesn ’ t rob them , but feeds the hungry , clothes the needy ,
TLB	Ezekiel	18	17	helps the poor , does not loan money at interest , and obeys my laws—he shall not die because of his father ’ s sins ; he shall surely live .
TLB	Ezekiel	18	19	“ ‘ What ? ’ you ask . ‘ Doesn ’ t the son pay for his father ’ s sins ? ’ No ! For if the son does what is right and keeps my laws , he shall surely live .
TLB	Ezekiel	18	20	The one who sins is the one who dies . The son shall not be punished for his father ’ s sins , nor the father for his son ’ s . The righteous person will be rewarded for his own goodness and the wicked person for his wickedness .
TLB	Ezekiel	18	21	But if a wicked person turns away from all his sins and begins to obey my laws and do what is just and right , he shall surely live and not die .
TLB	Ezekiel	18	22	All his past sins will be forgotten , and he shall live because of his goodness .
TLB	Ezekiel	18	23	“ Do you think I like to see the wicked die ? ” asks the Lord . “ Of course not ! I only want him to turn from his wicked ways and live .
TLB	Ezekiel	18	24	However , if a righteous person turns to sinning and acts like any other sinner , should he be allowed to live ? No , of course not . All his previous goodness will be forgotten and he shall die for his sins .
TLB	Ezekiel	18	25	“ Yet you say : ‘ The Lord isn ’ t being fair ! ’ Listen to me , O people of Israel . Am I the one who is unfair , or is it you ?
TLB	Ezekiel	18	26	When a good man turns away from being good , begins sinning , and dies in his sins , he dies for the evil he has done .
TLB	Ezekiel	18	27	And if a wicked person turns away from his wickedness and obeys the law and does right , he shall save his soul ,
TLB	Ezekiel	18	28	for he has thought it over and decided to turn from his sins and live a good life . He shall surely live—he shall not die .
TLB	Ezekiel	18	29	“ And yet the people of Israel keep saying : ‘ The Lord is unfair ! ’ O people of Israel , it is you who are unfair , not I .

TLB	Ezekiel	20	8	But they rebelled against me and would not listen . They didn ’ t get rid of their idols nor forsake the gods of Egypt .

This desert would be traversed in returning to Israel from Babylon . The Living Bible copyright ©
TLB	Ezekiel	20	12	And I gave them the Sabbath—a day of rest every seventh day—as a symbol between them and me , to remind them that it is I , the Lord , who sanctifies them—that they are truly my people .
TLB	Ezekiel	20	13	“ But Israel rebelled against me . There in the wilderness they refused my laws . They would not obey my rules even though obeying them means life . And they misused my Sabbaths . Then I thought , I will pour out my fury upon them and utterly consume them in the desert .
TLB	Ezekiel	20	14	“ But again I refrained in order to protect the honor of my name , lest the nations who saw me bring them out of Egypt would say that it was because I couldn ’ t care for them that I destroyed them .
TLB	Ezekiel	20	15	But I swore to them in the wilderness that I would not bring them into the land I had given them , a land full of milk and honey , the choicest spot on earth ,
TLB	Ezekiel	20	16	because they laughed at my laws , ignored my wishes , and violated my Sabbaths—their hearts were with their idols !
TLB	Ezekiel	20	17	Nevertheless , I spared them . I didn ’ t finish them off in the wilderness .
TLB	Ezekiel	20	18	and
TLB	Ezekiel	20	19	for I am the Lord your God . Follow my laws ; keep my ordinances ;
TLB	Ezekiel	20	21	“ But their children , too , rebelled against me . They refused my laws—the laws that if a person keeps them , he will live . And they defiled my Sabbaths . So then I said : ‘ Now at last I will pour out my fury upon you in the wilderness. ’
TLB	Ezekiel	20	22	“ Nevertheless , again I withdrew my judgment against them to protect my name among the nations who had seen my power in bringing them out of Egypt . 23-24 But I took a solemn oath against them while they were in the wilderness that I would scatter them , dispersing them to the ends of the earth because they did not obey my laws but scorned them and violated my Sabbaths and longed for their fathers ’ idols .
TLB	Ezekiel	20	25	I let them adopt [ b ] customs and laws which were worthless . Through the keeping of them they could not attain life .
TLB	Ezekiel	20	26	. In contrast , see v.
TLB	Ezekiel	20	29	I said to them : ‘ What is this place of sacrifice [ c ] where you go ? ’ And so it is still called ‘ The Place of Sacrifice ’ —that is how it got its name .
TLB	Ezekiel	20	30	“ The Lord God wants to know whether you are going to pollute yourselves just as your fathers did and keep on worshiping idols .
TLB	Ezekiel	20	31	For when you offer gifts to them and give your little sons to be burned to ashes as you do even today , shall I listen to you or help you , Israel ? As I live , ” the Lord God says , “ I will not give you any message , though you have come to me to ask .
TLB	Ezekiel	20	32	“ What you have in mind will not be done—to be like the nations all around you , serving gods of wood and stone .
TLB	Ezekiel	20	33	I will rule you with an iron fist and in great anger and with power .
TLB	Ezekiel	20	34	With might and fury I will bring you out from the lands where you are scattered , 35-36 and will bring you into my desert judgment hall . [ d ] I will judge you there and get rid of the rebels , just as I did in the wilderness after I brought you out of Egypt .
TLB	Ezekiel	20	37	I will count you carefully and let only a small quota return .
TLB	Ezekiel	20	38	And the others—the rebels and all those who sin against me—I will purge from among you . They shall not enter Israel , but I will bring them out of the countries where they are in exile . And when that happens , you will know I am the Lord .
TLB	Ezekiel	20	39	“ O Israel , ” the Lord God says : “ If you insist on worshiping your idols , go right ahead , but then don ’ t bring your gifts to me as well ! Such desecration of my holy name must stop !
TLB	Ezekiel	20	40	“ For at Jerusalem in my holy mountain , ” says the Lord , “ all Israel shall worship me . There I will accept you and require you to bring me your offerings and the finest of your gifts .
TLB	Ezekiel	20	41	You will be to me as an offering of perfumed incense when I bring you back from exile , and the nations will see the great change in your hearts .
TLB	Ezekiel	20	42	Then , when I have brought you home to the land I promised your fathers , you will know I am the Lord .
TLB	Ezekiel	20	43	Then you will look back at all your sins and loathe yourselves because of the evil you have done .
TLB	Ezekiel	20	44	And when I have honored my name by blessing you despite your wickedness , then , O Israel , you will know I am the Lord. ”
TLB	Ezekiel	20	45	Then this message came to me from the Lord :
TLB	Ezekiel	20	46	“ Son of dust , look toward Jerusalem and speak out against it and the forest lands of the Negeb .
TLB	Ezekiel	20	47	Prophesy to it and say : ‘ Hear the word of the Lord . I will set you on fire , O forest , and every tree will die , green and dry alike . The terrible flames will not be quenched , and they will scorch the world .
TLB	Ezekiel	20	48	And all the world will see that I , the Lord , have set the fire . It shall not be put out. ’ ”
TLB	Ezekiel	20	49	Then I said , “ O Lord God , they say of me , ‘ He only talks in riddles ! ’ ” Footnotes - Ezekiel 20:1 six years after King Jeconiah was captured , literally , “ in the seventh year of Jeconiah ’ s captivity. ” - Ezekiel 20:25 let them adopt , literally , “ gave them. ” Through the keeping of them they could not attain life , literally , “ Ordinances by which they could not have life. ” Doubtless , the reference is to the pagan customs of vv .

TLB	Ezekiel	21	21	For the king of Babylon stands at a fork , uncertain whether to attack Jerusalem or Rabbah . He will call his magicians to use divination ; they will cast lots by shaking arrows from the quiver ; they will sacrifice to idols and inspect the liver [ c ] of their sacrifice .
TLB	Ezekiel	21	2	“ Son of dust , face toward Jerusalem and prophesy against Israel and against my Temple ! [ a ]
TLB	Ezekiel	21	3	For the Lord says : ‘ I am against you , Israel . I will unsheath my sword and destroy your people , good and bad alike—
TLB	Ezekiel	21	4	I will not spare even the righteous . I will make a clean sweep throughout the land from the Negeb to your northern borders .
TLB	Ezekiel	21	5	All the world shall know that it is I , the Lord . His sword is in his hand , and it will not return to its sheath again until its work is finished. ’
TLB	Ezekiel	21	6	“ Sigh and groan before the people , son of dust , in your bitter anguish ; sigh with grief and broken heart .
TLB	Ezekiel	21	7	When they ask you why , tell them : ‘ Because of the fearsome news that God has given me . When it comes true , the boldest heart will melt with fear ; all strength will disappear . Every spirit will faint ; strong knees will tremble and become as weak as water. ’ And the Lord God says : ‘ Your doom is on the way ; my judgments will be fulfilled ! ’ ”
TLB	Ezekiel	21	8	Then again this message came to me from God : 9-11 “ Son of dust , tell them this : ‘ A sword is being sharpened and polished for terrible slaughter . Now will you laugh ? For those far stronger than you have perished beneath its power . It is ready now to hand to the executioner. ’
TLB	Ezekiel	21	12	Son of dust , with sobbing , beat upon your thigh , for that sword shall slay my people and all their leaders . All alike shall die .
TLB	Ezekiel	21	13	It will put them all to the test—and what chance do they have ? ” the Lord God asks .
TLB	Ezekiel	21	14	“ Prophesy to them in this way : Clap your hands vigorously , then take a sword and brandish it twice , thrice , to symbolize the great massacre they face !
TLB	Ezekiel	21	15	Let their hearts melt with terror , for a sword glitters at every gate ; it flashes like lightning ; it is razor-edged for slaughter .
TLB	Ezekiel	21	16	O sword , slash to the right and slash to the left , wherever you will , wherever you want .
TLB	Ezekiel	21	17	And you have prophesied with clapping hands that I , the Lord , will smite Jerusalem and satisfy my fury. ”
TLB	Ezekiel	21	18	Then this message came to me . The Lord said : 19-20 “ Son of dust , make a map and on it trace two routes for the king of Babylon to follow—one to Jerusalem and the other to Rabbah in Transjordan . [ b ] And put a signpost at the fork in the road from Babylon .
TLB	Ezekiel	21	22	They will decide to turn toward Jerusalem ! With battering rams they will go against the gates , shouting for the kill ; they will build siege towers and make a hill against the walls to reach the top .
TLB	Ezekiel	21	23	Jerusalem won ’ t understand this treachery ; how could the diviners make this terrible mistake ? For Babylon is Judah ’ s ally and has sworn to defend Jerusalem ! But the king of Babylon will think only of the times the people rebelled . He will attack and defeat them. ”
TLB	Ezekiel	21	24	The Lord God says : “ Again and again your guilt cries out against you , for your sins are open and unashamed . Wherever you go , whatever you do , all is filled with sin . And now the time of punishment has come .
TLB	Ezekiel	21	25	“ O King Zedekiah , [ d ] evil prince of Israel , your final day of reckoning is here .
TLB	Ezekiel	21	26	Take off your jeweled crown , ” the Lord God says . “ The old order changes . Now the poor are exalted and the rich brought very low .
TLB	Ezekiel	21	27	I will overturn , overturn , overturn the kingdom , so that even the new order that emerges will not succeed until the Man appears who has a right to it . And I will give it all to him .
TLB	Ezekiel	21	28	“ Son of dust , prophesy to the Ammonites too , for they mocked my people in their woe . Tell them this : “ ‘ Against you also my glittering sword is drawn from its sheath ; it is sharpened and polished and flashes like lightning .
TLB	Ezekiel	21	29	Your magicians and false prophets have told you lies of safety and success—that your gods will save you from the king of Babylon . Thus they have caused your death along with all the other wicked , for when the day of final reckoning has come , you will be wounded unto death .
TLB	Ezekiel	21	30	Shall I return my sword to its sheath before I deal with you ? No , I will destroy you in your own country where you were born .
TLB	Ezekiel	21	31	I will pour out my fury upon you and blow upon the fire of my wrath until it becomes a roaring conflagration , and I will deliver you into the hands of cruel men skilled in destruction .
TLB	Ezekiel	21	32	You are the fuel for the fire ; your blood will be spilled in your own country , and you will be utterly wiped out , your memory lost in history . For I , the Lord , have spoken it. ’ ” Footnotes - Ezekiel 21:2 against my Temple , literally , “ against the sanctuaries. ” - Ezekiel 21:19 Rabbah in Transjordan , literally , “ Rabbah of the Ammonites. ” - Ezekiel 21:21 inspect the liver .

TLB	Ezekiel	22	22	and you will melt like silver in fierce heat , and you will know that I , the Lord , have poured my wrath upon you. ’ ”
TLB	Ezekiel	22	2	“ Son of dust , indict Jerusalem as the City of Murder . Publicly denounce her terrible deeds .
TLB	Ezekiel	22	3	City of Murder , doomed and damned—City of Idols , filthy and foul—
TLB	Ezekiel	22	4	you are guilty both of murder and idolatry . Now comes your day of doom . You have reached the limit of your years . I will make you a laughingstock and a reproach to all the nations of the world .
TLB	Ezekiel	22	5	Near and far they will mock you , a city of infamous rebels .
TLB	Ezekiel	22	6	“ Every leader in Israel who lives within your walls is bent on murder .
TLB	Ezekiel	22	7	Fathers and mothers are contemptuously ignored ; immigrants and visitors are forced to pay you for your ‘ protection ’ ; orphans and widows are wronged and oppressed .
TLB	Ezekiel	22	8	The things of God are all despised ; my Sabbaths are ignored .
TLB	Ezekiel	22	9	Prisoners are falsely accused and sent to their death . Every mountaintop is filled with idols ; lewdness is everywhere .
TLB	Ezekiel	22	10	There are men who commit adultery with their fathers ’ wives and lie with menstruous women . [ a ]
TLB	Ezekiel	22	11	Adultery with a neighbor ’ s wife , a daughter-in-law , a half sister—this is common .
TLB	Ezekiel	22	12	Hired murderers , loan racketeers , and extortioners are everywhere . You never even think of me and my commands , ” the Lord God says .
TLB	Ezekiel	22	13	“ But now I snap my fingers and call a halt to your dishonest gain and bloodshed .
TLB	Ezekiel	22	14	How strong and courageous will you be then , in my day of reckoning ? For I , the Lord , have spoken , and I will do all that I have said .
TLB	Ezekiel	22	15	I will scatter you throughout the world and burn out the wickedness within you .
TLB	Ezekiel	22	16	You will be dishonored among the nations , and you shall know I am the Lord. ”
TLB	Ezekiel	22	17	Then the Lord said this : 18-20 “ Son of dust , the people of Israel are the worthless slag left when silver is smelted . They are the dross , compounded from the brass , the tin , the iron , and the lead . Therefore the Lord God says : ‘ Because you are worthless dross , I will bring you to my crucible in Jerusalem , to smelt you with the heat of my wrath .
TLB	Ezekiel	22	21	I will blow the fire of my wrath upon you ,
TLB	Ezekiel	22	23	Again the message of the Lord came to me , saying :
TLB	Ezekiel	22	24	“ Son of dust , say to the people of Israel : ‘ In the day of my indignation you shall be like an uncleared wilderness or a desert without rain. ’
TLB	Ezekiel	22	25	Your ‘ prophets ’ have plotted against you like lions stalking prey . They devour many lives ; they seize treasures and extort wealth ; they multiply the widows in the land .
TLB	Ezekiel	22	26	Your priests have violated my laws and defiled my Temple and my holiness . To them the things of God are no more important than any daily task . They have not taught my people the difference between right and wrong , and they disregard my Sabbaths , so my holy name is greatly defiled among them .
TLB	Ezekiel	22	27	Your leaders are like wolves , who tear apart their victims , and they destroy lives for profit .
TLB	Ezekiel	22	28	Your ‘ prophets ’ describe false visions and speak false messages they claim are from God , when he hasn ’ t spoken one word to them at all . Thus they repair the walls with whitewash !
TLB	Ezekiel	22	29	Even the common people oppress and rob the poor and needy and cruelly extort from aliens .
TLB	Ezekiel	22	30	“ I looked in vain for anyone who would build again the wall of righteousness that guards the land , who could stand in the gap and defend you from my just attacks , but I found not one. ”
TLB	Ezekiel	22	31	And so the Lord God says : “ I will pour out my anger upon you ; I will consume you with the fire of my wrath . I have heaped upon you the full penalty for all your sins. ” Footnotes - Ezekiel 22:10 There are men who commit adultery with their father ’ s wives and lie with menstruous women , or “ You degrade yourselves through homosexual practices and through lying with women in their time of menstruation. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Ezekiel	23	23	For the Babylonians will come , and all the Chaldeans from Pekod and Shoa and Koa ; and all the Assyrians with them—handsome young men of high rank , riding their steeds .
TLB	Ezekiel	23	6	for they were all attractive young men , captains and commanders , in handsome blue , dashing about on their horses .
TLB	Ezekiel	23	7	And so she sinned with them—the choicest men of Assyria—worshiping their idols , defiling herself .
TLB	Ezekiel	23	8	For when she left Egypt , she did not leave her spirit of prostitution behind , but was still as lewd as in her youth when the Egyptians poured out their lusts upon her and robbed her of her virginity .
TLB	Ezekiel	23	9	“ And so I delivered her into the evil clutches of the Assyrians whose gods she loved so much .
TLB	Ezekiel	23	10	They stripped her and killed her and took away her children as their slaves . Her name was known to every woman in the land as a sinner who had received what she deserved .
TLB	Ezekiel	23	11	“ But when Oholibah ( Jerusalem ) saw what had happened to her sister , she went right ahead in the same way and sinned even more than her sister .
TLB	Ezekiel	23	12	She fawned over her Assyrian neighbors , [ a ] those handsome young men on fine steeds , those army officers in handsome uniforms—all of them desirable .
TLB	Ezekiel	23	13	I saw the way she was going , following right along behind her older sister . 14-15 “ She was in fact more debased than Samaria , for she fell in love with pictures she saw painted on a wall ! They were pictures of Babylonian military officers , outfitted in striking red uniforms , with handsome belts , and flowing turbans on their heads .
TLB	Ezekiel	23	16	When she saw these paintings , she longed to give herself to the men pictured , so she sent messengers to Chaldea [ b ] to invite them to come to her .
TLB	Ezekiel	23	17	And they came and committed adultery with her , defiling her in the bed of love , but afterward she hated them and broke off all relations with them . [ c ]
TLB	Ezekiel	23	18	“ And I despised her , just as I despised her sister , because she flaunted herself before them and gave herself to their lust . 19-20 But that didn ’ t bother her . She turned to even greater prostitution , sinning with the lustful men she remembered from her youth when she was a prostitute in Egypt . [ d ]
TLB	Ezekiel	23	21	And thus you celebrated those former days when as a young girl you gave your virginity to those from Egypt .
TLB	Ezekiel	23	22	“ And now the Lord God says that he will raise against you , O Oholibah ( Jerusalem ) , those very nations from which you turned away , disgusted .
TLB	Ezekiel	23	24	They will come against you from the north with chariots , wagons , and a great army fully prepared for attack . They will surround you on every side with armored men , and I will let them at you , to do with you as they wish .
TLB	Ezekiel	23	25	And I will send my jealousy against you and deal furiously with you . They will cut off your nose and ears ; your survivors will be killed ; your children will be taken away as slaves , and everything left will be burned .
TLB	Ezekiel	23	26	They will strip you of your beautiful clothes and jewels .
TLB	Ezekiel	23	27	“ And so I will put a stop to your lewdness and prostitution brought from the land of Egypt ; you will no more long for Egypt and her gods. ”
TLB	Ezekiel	23	28	For the Lord God says : “ I will surely deliver you over to your enemies , to those you loathe .
TLB	Ezekiel	23	29	They will deal with you in hatred and rob you of all you own , leaving you naked and bare . And the shame of your prostitution shall be exposed to all the world .
TLB	Ezekiel	23	30	“ You brought all this upon yourself by worshiping the gods of other nations , defiling yourself with all their idols .
TLB	Ezekiel	23	31	You have followed in your sister ’ s footsteps , so I will punish you with the same terrors that destroyed her .
TLB	Ezekiel	23	32	Yes , the terrors that fell upon her will fall upon you—and the cup from which she drank was full and large . And all the world will mock you for your woe .
TLB	Ezekiel	23	33	You will reel like a drunkard beneath the awful blows of sorrow and distress , just as your sister Samaria did .
TLB	Ezekiel	23	34	In deep anguish you will drain that cup of terror to the very bottom and will lick the inside to get every drop . For I have spoken , ” says the Lord .
TLB	Ezekiel	23	35	“ Because you have forgotten me and turned your backs on me , therefore you must bear the consequence of all your sin .
TLB	Ezekiel	23	36	“ Son of dust , you must accuse Jerusalem and Samaria of all their awful deeds .
TLB	Ezekiel	23	37	For they have committed both adultery and murder ; they have worshiped idols and murdered my children whom they bore to me , burning them as sacrifices on their altars .
TLB	Ezekiel	23	38	On the same day they defiled my Temple and ignored my Sabbaths ,
TLB	Ezekiel	23	39	for when they had murdered their children in front of their idols , then even that same day they actually came into my Temple to worship ! That is how much regard they have for me !
TLB	Ezekiel	23	40	“ You even sent away to distant lands for priests to come with other gods for you to serve , and they have come and been welcomed ! You bathed yourself , painted your eyelids , and put on your finest jewels for them .
TLB	Ezekiel	23	41	You sat together on a beautifully embroidered bed and put my incense and my oil upon a table spread before you .
TLB	Ezekiel	23	42	From your apartment came the sound of many men carousing—lewd men and drunkards from the wilderness , who put bracelets on your wrists and beautiful crowns upon your head .
TLB	Ezekiel	23	43	Will they commit adultery with these who have become old harlot hags ?
TLB	Ezekiel	23	44	Yet that is what they did . They went in to them—to Samaria and Jerusalem , these shameless harlots—with all the zest of lustful men who visit prostitutes .
TLB	Ezekiel	23	45	But just persons everywhere will judge them for what they really are—adulteresses and murderers . They will mete out to them the sentences the law demands. ”
TLB	Ezekiel	23	46	The Lord God says : “ Bring an army against them and hand them out to be crushed and despised .
TLB	Ezekiel	23	47	For their enemies will stone them and kill them with swords ; they will butcher their sons and daughters and burn their homes .
TLB	Ezekiel	23	48	Thus will I make lewdness and idolatry to cease from the land . My judgment will be a lesson against idolatry for all to see .
TLB	Ezekiel	23	49	For you will be fully repaid for all your harlotry , your worshiping of idols . You will suffer the full penalty , and you will know that I alone am God. ” Footnotes - Ezekiel 23:12 She fawned over her Assyrian neighbors , i.e. , when Ahaz paid “ protection money ” to Tiglath-pileser II (

TLB	Ezekiel	24	24	Ezekiel is an example to you , ’ the Lord God says . ‘ You will do as he has done . And when that time comes , then you will know I am the Lord. ’ ”
TLB	Ezekiel	24	2	“ Son of dust , ” he said , “ write down this date , for today the king of Babylon has attacked Jerusalem .
TLB	Ezekiel	24	3	And now give this parable to these rebels , Israel ; tell them , ‘ The Lord God says : Put a pot of water on the fire to boil .
TLB	Ezekiel	24	4	Fill it with choicest mutton , the rump and shoulder and all the most tender cuts .
TLB	Ezekiel	24	5	Use only the best sheep from the flock , and heap fuel on the fire beneath the pot . Boil the meat well , until the flesh falls off the bones. ’ ”
TLB	Ezekiel	24	6	For the Lord God says : “ Woe to Jerusalem , City of Murderers ; you are a pot that is pitted with rust and with wickedness . So take out the meat chunk by chunk in whatever order it comes—for none is better than any other . [ a ]
TLB	Ezekiel	24	7	For her wickedness is evident to all—she boldly murders , leaving blood upon the rocks in open view for all to see ; she does not even try to cover it .
TLB	Ezekiel	24	8	And I have left it there , uncovered , to shout to me against her and arouse my wrath and vengeance .
TLB	Ezekiel	24	9	“ Woe to Jerusalem , City of Murderers . I will pile on the fuel beneath her .
TLB	Ezekiel	24	10	Heap on the wood ; let the fire roar and the pot boil . Cook the meat well , and then empty the pot and burn the bones .
TLB	Ezekiel	24	11	Now set it empty on the coals to scorch away the rust and corruption .
TLB	Ezekiel	24	12	But all for naught—it all remains despite the hottest fire .
TLB	Ezekiel	24	13	It is the rust and corruption of your filthy lewdness , of worshiping your idols . And now , because I wanted to cleanse you and you refused , remain filthy until my fury has accomplished all its terrors upon you !
TLB	Ezekiel	24	14	I , the Lord , have spoken it ; it shall come to pass and I will do it. ”
TLB	Ezekiel	24	15	Again a message came to me from the Lord , saying :
TLB	Ezekiel	24	16	“ Son of dust , I am going to take away your lovely wife . Suddenly , she will die . Yet you must show no sorrow . Do not weep ; let there be no tears .
TLB	Ezekiel	24	17	You may sigh , but only quietly . Let there be no wailing at her grave ; don ’ t bare your head nor feet , and don ’ t accept the food brought to you by consoling friends. ”
TLB	Ezekiel	24	18	I proclaimed this to the people in the morning , and in the evening my wife died . The next morning I did all the Lord had told me to .
TLB	Ezekiel	24	19	Then the people said : “ What does all this mean ? What are you trying to tell us ? ” 20-21 And I answered , “ The Lord told me to say to the people of Israel : ‘ I will destroy my lovely , beautiful Temple , the strength of your nation . And your sons and daughters in Judea will be slaughtered by the sword .
TLB	Ezekiel	24	22	And you will do as I have done ; you may not mourn in public or console yourself by eating the food brought to you by sympathetic friends .
TLB	Ezekiel	24	23	Your head and feet shall not be bared ; you shall not mourn or weep . But you will sorrow to one another for your sins and mourn privately for all the evil you have done .
TLB	Ezekiel	24	25	“ Son of dust , on the day I finish taking from them in Jerusalem the joy of their hearts and their glory and joys—their wives and their sons and their daughters—
TLB	Ezekiel	24	26	on that day a refugee from Jerusalem will start on a journey to come to you in Babylon to tell you what has happened .
TLB	Ezekiel	24	27	And on the day of his arrival , your voice will suddenly return to you so that you can talk with him ; and you will be a symbol for these people , and they shall know I am the Lord. ” Footnotes - Ezekiel 24:6 for none is better than any other , literally , “ for no lot has fallen upon it. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Ezekiel	25	25	Then the Lord ’ s message came to me again . He said :
TLB	Ezekiel	25	2	“ Son of dust , look toward the land of Ammon and prophesy against its people .
TLB	Ezekiel	25	3	Tell them : ‘ Listen to what the Lord God says . Because you scoffed when my Temple was destroyed , and mocked Israel in her anguish , and laughed at Judah when she was marched away captive ,
TLB	Ezekiel	25	4	therefore I will let the Bedouins from the desert to the east of you overrun your land . They will set up their encampments among you . They will harvest all your fruit and steal your dairy cattle .
TLB	Ezekiel	25	5	And I will turn the city of Rabbah into a pasture for camels and all the country of the Ammonites into a wasteland where flocks of sheep can graze . Then you will know I am the Lord. ’ ”
TLB	Ezekiel	25	6	For the Lord God says : “ Because you clapped and stamped and cheered with glee at the destruction of my people ,
TLB	Ezekiel	25	7	therefore I will lay my hand heavily upon you , delivering you to many nations for devastation . I will cut you off from being a nation anymore . I will destroy you ; then you shall know I am the Lord. ”
TLB	Ezekiel	25	8	And the Lord God says : “ Because the Moabites have said that Judah is no better off than any other nation , 9-10 therefore I will open up the eastern flank of Moab , wiping out her frontier cities , the glory of the nation—Beth-jeshimoth , Baal-meon and Kiriathaim . And Bedouin tribes from the desert to the east will pour in upon her , just as they will upon Ammon . And Moab will no longer be counted among the nations .
TLB	Ezekiel	25	11	Thus I will bring down my judgment upon the Moabites , and they shall know I am the Lord. ”
TLB	Ezekiel	25	12	And the Lord God says : “ Because the people of Edom have sinned so greatly by avenging themselves upon the people of Judah ,
TLB	Ezekiel	25	13	I will smash Edom with my fist and wipe out her people , her cattle , and her flocks . The sword will destroy everything from Teman to Dedan .
TLB	Ezekiel	25	14	By the hand of my people , Israel , this shall be done . They will carry out my furious vengeance. ”
TLB	Ezekiel	25	15	And the Lord God says : “ Because the Philistines have acted against Judah out of revenge and long-standing hatred ,
TLB	Ezekiel	25	16	I will shake my fist over the land of the Philistines , and I will wipe out the Cherethites and utterly destroy those along the seacoast .
TLB	Ezekiel	25	17	I will execute terrible vengeance upon them to rebuke them for what they have done . And when all this happens , then they shall know I am the Lord. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Ezekiel	26	26	Another message came to me from the Lord on the first day of the month , in the eleventh year ( after King Jehoiachin was taken away to captivity ) .
TLB	Ezekiel	26	2	“ Son of dust , Tyre has rejoiced over the fall of Jerusalem , saying , ‘ Ha ! She who controlled the lucrative north-south trade routes along the coast and along the course of the Jordan River [ a ] has been broken , and I have fallen heir ! Because she has been laid waste , I shall become wealthy ! ’ ”
TLB	Ezekiel	26	3	Therefore the Lord God says : “ I stand against you , Tyre , and I will bring nations against you like ocean waves .
TLB	Ezekiel	26	4	They will destroy the walls of Tyre and tear down her towers . I will scrape away her soil and make her a bare rock !
TLB	Ezekiel	26	5	Her island shall become uninhabited , a place for fishermen to spread their nets , for I have spoken it , ” says the Lord God . “ Tyre shall become the prey of many nations ,
TLB	Ezekiel	26	6	and her mainland city shall perish by the sword . Then they shall know I am the Lord. ”
TLB	Ezekiel	26	7	For the Lord God says : “ I will bring Nebuchadnezzar , king of Babylon—the king of kings from the north—against Tyre with a great army and cavalry and chariots .
TLB	Ezekiel	26	8	First he will destroy your suburbs ; then he will attack your mainland city by building a siege wall and raising a roof of shields against it .
TLB	Ezekiel	26	9	He will set up battering rams against your walls and with sledgehammers demolish your forts .
TLB	Ezekiel	26	10	The hoofs of his cavalry will choke the city with dust , and your walls will shake as the horses gallop through your broken gates , pulling chariots behind them .
TLB	Ezekiel	26	11	Horsemen will occupy every street in the city ; they will butcher your people , and your famous , huge pillars will topple .
TLB	Ezekiel	26	12	and

TLB	Ezekiel	26	16	“ Then all the seaport rulers shall come down from their thrones and lay aside their robes and beautiful garments and sit on the ground shaking with fear at what they have seen .
TLB	Ezekiel	26	17	And they shall wail for you , singing this dirge : ‘ O mighty island city , with your naval power that terrorized the mainland , how you have vanished from the seas !
TLB	Ezekiel	26	18	How the islands tremble at your fall ! They watch dismayed. ’ ”
TLB	Ezekiel	26	19	For the Lord God says : “ I will destroy Tyre to the ground . You will sink beneath the terrible waves of enemy attack . Great seas shall swallow you .
TLB	Ezekiel	26	20	I will send you to the pit of hell to lie there with those of long ago . Your city will lie in ruins , dead , like the bodies of those in the underworld who entered long ago the nether world of the dead . Never again will you be inhabited or be given beauty here in the land of those who live .

TLB	Ezekiel	27	27	Everything is lost . Your riches and wares , your sailors and pilots , your shipwrights , merchants , and soldiers ; and all the people sink into the sea on the day of your vast ruin .
TLB	Ezekiel	27	2	“ Son of dust , sing this sad dirge for Tyre :
TLB	Ezekiel	27	3	“ ‘ O mighty seaport city , merchant center of the world , the Lord God speaks . You say , “ I am the most beautiful city in all the world. ”
TLB	Ezekiel	27	4	You have extended your boundaries out into the sea ; your architects have made you glorious .
TLB	Ezekiel	27	5	You are like a ship built of finest fir from Senir . They took a cedar from Lebanon to make a mast for you .
TLB	Ezekiel	27	6	They made your oars from oaks of Bashan . The walls of your cabin are of cypress from the southern coast of Cyprus .
TLB	Ezekiel	27	7	Your sails are made of Egypt ’ s finest linens ; you stand beneath awnings bright with purple and scarlet dyes from eastern Cyprus .
TLB	Ezekiel	27	8	“ ‘ Your sailors come from Sidon and Arvad ; your helmsmen are skilled men from Zemer .
TLB	Ezekiel	27	9	Wise old craftsmen from Gebal do the calking . Ships come from every land with all their goods to barter for your trade .
TLB	Ezekiel	27	10	“ ‘ Your army includes men from far-off Paras , Lud , and Put . [ a ] They serve you—it is a feather in your cap to have their shields hang upon your walls ; it is the ultimate of honor .
TLB	Ezekiel	27	11	Men from Arvad and from Helech [ b ] are the sentinels upon your walls ; your towers are manned by men from Gamad . Their shields hang row on row upon the walls , perfecting your glory .
TLB	Ezekiel	27	12	“ ‘ From Tarshish come all kinds of riches to your markets—silver , iron , tin , and lead .

TLB	Ezekiel	27	19	Vedan and Javan bring Arabian yarn , [ e ] wrought iron , cassia , and calamus ,

TLB	Ezekiel	27	25	The ships of Tarshish are your ocean caravans ; your island warehouse is filled to the brim !

TLB	Ezekiel	28	28	Here is another message given to me from the Lord : 2-3 “ Son of dust , say to the prince of Tyre , ‘ The Lord God says : You are so proud you think you are God , sitting on the throne of a god on your island home in the midst of the seas . But you are only a man and not a god , though you boast yourself to be like God . You are wiser than Daniel , for no secret is hidden from you .
TLB	Ezekiel	28	4	You have used your wisdom and understanding to get great wealth—gold and silver and many treasures .
TLB	Ezekiel	28	5	Yes , your wisdom has made you very rich and very proud. ’ ”
TLB	Ezekiel	28	6	Therefore the Lord God says : “ Because you claim that you are as wise as God ,
TLB	Ezekiel	28	7	an enemy army , the terror of the nations , shall suddenly draw their swords against your marvelous wisdom and defile your splendor !
TLB	Ezekiel	28	8	They will bring you to the pit of hell , and you shall die as those pierced with many wounds , there on your island in the heart of the seas .
TLB	Ezekiel	28	9	Then will you boast as a god ? At least to these invaders you will be no god , but merely man !
TLB	Ezekiel	28	10	You will die like an outcast at the hands of foreigners . For I have spoken it , ” the Lord God says .
TLB	Ezekiel	28	11	Then this further message came to me from the Lord :
TLB	Ezekiel	28	12	“ Son of dust , weep for the king of Tyre . [ a ] Tell him , ‘ The Lord God says : You were the perfection of wisdom and beauty .
TLB	Ezekiel	28	13	You were in Eden , the garden of God ; your clothing was bejeweled with every precious stone—ruby , topaz , diamond , chrysolite , onyx , jasper , sapphire , carbuncle , and emerald—all in beautiful settings of finest gold . They were given to you on the day you were created .
TLB	Ezekiel	28	14	I appointed you to be the anointed Guardian Angel . You had access to the holy mountain of God . You walked among the stones of fire . [ b ]
TLB	Ezekiel	28	15	“ ‘ You were perfect in all you did from the day you were created until that time when wrong was found in you .
TLB	Ezekiel	28	16	Your great wealth filled you with internal turmoil , and you sinned . Therefore , I cast you out of the mountain of God like a common sinner . I destroyed you , O Guardian Angel , from the midst of the stones of fire . [ c ]
TLB	Ezekiel	28	17	Your heart was filled with pride because of all your beauty ; you corrupted your wisdom for the sake of your splendor . Therefore , I have cast you down to the ground and exposed you helpless before the curious gaze of kings .
TLB	Ezekiel	28	18	You defiled your holiness with lust for gain ; [ d ] therefore , I brought forth fire from your own actions and let it burn you to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all those watching you .
TLB	Ezekiel	28	19	All who know you are appalled at your fate ; you are an example of horror ; you are destroyed forever. ’ ”
TLB	Ezekiel	28	20	Then another message came to me from the Lord :
TLB	Ezekiel	28	21	“ Son of dust , look toward the city of Sidon and prophesy against it . Say to it ,
TLB	Ezekiel	28	22	‘ The Lord God says : I am your enemy , O Sidon , and I will reveal my power over you . When I destroy you and show forth my holiness upon you , then all who see shall know I am the Lord .
TLB	Ezekiel	28	23	I will send an epidemic of disease and an army to destroy ; the wounded shall be slain in your streets by troops on every side . Then you will know I am the Lord .
TLB	Ezekiel	28	24	No longer shall you and Israel ’ s other neighbor nations prick and tear at Israel like thorns and briars , though they formerly despised her and treated her with great contempt .
TLB	Ezekiel	28	25	“ ‘ The people of Israel will once more live in their own land , the land I gave their father Jacob . For I will gather them back again from distant lands where I have scattered them , and I will show the nations of the world my holiness among my people .
TLB	Ezekiel	28	26	They will live safely in Israel and build their homes and plant their vineyards . When I punish all the bordering nations that treated them with such contempt , then they shall know I am the Lord their God. ’ ” Footnotes - Ezekiel 28:12 weep for the king of Tyre . In this passage ( vv . 11-19 ) some descriptive phrases apply to a human king of Tyre , and some seem to apply to Satan . Great care therefore must be taken to apply these verses with discernment . - Ezekiel 28:14 You walked among the stones of fire . Probably a symbol of the Angels . - Ezekiel 28:16 O Guardian Angel , from the midst of the stones of fire , or “ and the guardian cherub drove you out from the midst of the stones of fire. ” - Ezekiel 28:18 with lust for gain , literally , “ in the unrighteousness of your trade. ” I brought forth fire from your own actions , literally , “ I brought fire from the midst of you. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Ezekiel	29	29	Late in December of the tenth year ( of the imprisonment of King Jehoiachin ) , this message came to me from the Lord :
TLB	Ezekiel	29	2	“ Son of dust , face toward Egypt and prophesy against Pharaoh her king and all her people .
TLB	Ezekiel	29	3	Tell them that the Lord God says : ‘ I am your enemy , Pharaoh , king of Egypt—mighty dragon lying in the middle of your rivers . For you have said , “ The Nile is mine ; I have made it for myself ! ”
TLB	Ezekiel	29	4	I will put hooks into your jaws and drag you out onto the land with fish sticking to your scales .
TLB	Ezekiel	29	5	And I will leave you and all the fish stranded in the desert to die , and you won ’ t be buried , for I have given you as food to the wild animals and birds .
TLB	Ezekiel	29	6	“ ‘ Because of the way your might collapsed when Israel called on you for aid instead of trusting me , [ a ] all of you shall know I am the Lord .
TLB	Ezekiel	29	7	Israel leaned on you but , like a cracked staff , you snapped beneath her hand and wrenched her shoulder out of joint and made her stagger with the pain .
TLB	Ezekiel	29	8	Therefore the Lord God says : I will bring an army against you , O Egypt , and destroy both men and herds .
TLB	Ezekiel	29	9	The land of Egypt shall become a desolate wasteland , and the Egyptians will know that I , the Lord , have done it .
TLB	Ezekiel	29	10	“ ‘ Because you said : “ The Nile is mine ! I made it ! ” therefore I am against you and your river , and I will utterly destroy the land of Egypt , from Migdol to Syene , as far south as the border of Ethiopia .
TLB	Ezekiel	29	11	For forty years not a soul will pass that way , neither men nor animals . It will be completely uninhabited .
TLB	Ezekiel	29	12	I will make Egypt desolate , surrounded by desolate nations , and her cities will lie as wastelands for forty years . I will exile the Egyptians to other lands .
TLB	Ezekiel	29	13	“ ‘ But the Lord God says that at the end of the forty years he will bring the Egyptians home again from the nations to which they will be banished .
TLB	Ezekiel	29	14	And I will restore the fortunes of Egypt and bring her people back to the land of Pathros in southern Egypt where they were born , but she will be an unimportant , minor kingdom .
TLB	Ezekiel	29	15	She will be the lowliest of all the nations ; never again will she raise herself above the other nations ; never again will Egypt be great enough for that .
TLB	Ezekiel	29	16	“ ‘ Israel will no longer expect any help from Egypt . Whenever she thinks of asking for it , then she will remember her sin in seeking it before . Then Israel will know that I alone am God. ’ ”
TLB	Ezekiel	29	17	In the twenty-seventh year of King Jehoiachin ’ s captivity , [ b ] around the middle of March , this message came to me from the Lord :
TLB	Ezekiel	29	18	“ Son of dust , the army of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon fought hard against Tyre . The soldiers ’ heads were bald from carrying heavy basketfuls of earth ; their shoulders were raw and blistered from burdens of stones for the siege . And Nebuchadnezzar received no compensation and could not pay the army for all this work. ” [ c ]
TLB	Ezekiel	29	19	Therefore , the Lord God says , “ I will give the land of Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar , king of Babylon , and he will carry off her wealth , plundering everything she has , for his army .
TLB	Ezekiel	29	20	Yes , I have given him the land of Egypt for his salary because he was working for me during those thirteen years at Tyre , ” says the Lord .
TLB	Ezekiel	29	21	“ And the day will come when I will cause the ancient glory of Israel to revive , and then at last her words will be respected , and Egypt shall know I am the Lord. ” Footnotes - Ezekiel 29:6 instead of trusting me , implied . - Ezekiel 29:17 King Jehoiachin ’ s captivity , implied . - Ezekiel 29:18 and could not pay the army for all this work . Tyre capitulated to Nebuchadnezzar at the end of a thirteen-year siege ( 587–574 B.C . ) There was little left to pay the “ salary ” of Nebuchadnezzar , so the Lord was giving Egypt to him to make up for what he was “ shortchanged ” at Tyre .

TLB	Ezekiel	30	30	Another message from the Lord ! 2-3 “ Son of dust , prophesy and say : The Lord God says , ‘ Weep , for the terrible day is almost here ; the day of the Lord ; a day of clouds and gloom ; a day of despair for the nations !
TLB	Ezekiel	30	4	A sword shall fall on Egypt ; the slain shall cover the ground . Her wealth is taken away , her foundations destroyed . The land of Cush has been ravished .
TLB	Ezekiel	30	5	For Cush , Put , Lud , Arabia , and Libya , and all the countries leagued with them shall perish in that war. ’ ”
TLB	Ezekiel	30	6	For the Lord says : “ All Egypt ’ s allies shall fall , and the pride of her power shall end . From Migdol to Syene they shall perish by the sword .
TLB	Ezekiel	30	7	She shall be desolate , surrounded by desolate nations , and her cities shall be in ruins , surrounded by other ruined cities .
TLB	Ezekiel	30	8	And they will know I am the Lord when I have set Egypt on fire and destroyed her allies .
TLB	Ezekiel	30	9	At that time I will send swift messengers to bring panic to the Ethiopians ; great terror shall befall them at that time of Egypt ’ s doom . This will all come true. ”
TLB	Ezekiel	30	10	For the Lord God says : “ Nebuchadnezzar , king of Babylon , will destroy the multitudes of Egypt .
TLB	Ezekiel	30	11	He and his armies—the terror of the nations—are sent to demolish the land . They shall war against Egypt and cover the ground with the slain .
TLB	Ezekiel	30	12	I will dry up the Nile and sell the whole land to wicked men . I will destroy Egypt and everything in it , using foreigners to do it . I , the Lord , have spoken it .
TLB	Ezekiel	30	13	“ And I will smash the idols of Egypt and the images at Memphis , and there will be no king in Egypt ; anarchy shall reign !
TLB	Ezekiel	30	14	“ The cities of Pathros along the upper Nile , [ a ] Zoan , and Thebes shall lie in ruins by my hand .
TLB	Ezekiel	30	15	And I will pour out my fury upon Pelusium , the strongest fortress of Egypt , and I will stamp out the people of Thebes .
TLB	Ezekiel	30	16	Yes , I will set fire to Egypt ; Pelusium will be racked with pain . Thebes will be torn apart ; Memphis will be in daily terror .
TLB	Ezekiel	30	17	The young men of Heliopolis and Bubastis shall die by the sword , and the women will be taken away as slaves .
TLB	Ezekiel	30	18	When I come to break the power of Egypt , it will be a dark day for Tahpanhes too ; a dark cloud will cover her , and her daughters will be taken away as captives .
TLB	Ezekiel	30	19	And so I will greatly punish Egypt and they shall know I am the Lord. ”
TLB	Ezekiel	30	20	A year later , [ b ] around the middle of March of the eleventh year of King Jehoiachin ’ s captivity , this message came to me :
TLB	Ezekiel	30	21	“ Son of dust , I have broken the arm of Pharaoh , [ c ] king of Egypt , and it has not been set nor put into a cast to make it strong enough to hold a sword again .
TLB	Ezekiel	30	22	For the Lord God says , I am against Pharaoh , king of Egypt , and I will break both his arms—the strong one and the one that was broken before , and I will make his sword clatter to the ground .
TLB	Ezekiel	30	23	And I will banish the Egyptians to many lands .
TLB	Ezekiel	30	24	And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon and place my sword in his hand . But I will break the arms of Pharaoh , king of Egypt , and he shall groan before the king of Babylon as one who has been wounded unto death .
TLB	Ezekiel	30	25	I will strengthen the hands of the king of Babylon , while the arms of Pharaoh fall useless to his sides . Yes , when I place my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon , and he swings it over the land of Egypt , Egypt shall know I am the Lord .
TLB	Ezekiel	30	26	I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations ; then they shall know I am the Lord. ” Footnotes - Ezekiel 30:14 along the upper Nile , implied . - Ezekiel 30:20 A year later ,

TLB	Ezekiel	31	31	In mid-May of the eleventh year of King Jehoiachin ’ s captivity , [ a ] this message came to me from the Lord : 2-3 “ Son of dust , tell Pharaoh , king of Egypt , and all his people : ‘ You are as Assyria was—a great and mighty nation—like a cedar of Lebanon , full of thick branches and forest shade , with its head high up among the clouds .
TLB	Ezekiel	31	4	Its roots went deep into the moist earth . It grew luxuriantly and gave streamlets of water to all the trees around .
TLB	Ezekiel	31	5	It towered above all the other trees . It prospered and grew long thick branches because of all the water at its roots .
TLB	Ezekiel	31	6	The birds nested in its branches , and in its shade the flocks and herds gave birth to young . All the great nations of the world lived beneath its shadow .
TLB	Ezekiel	31	7	It was strong and beautiful , for its roots went deep to water .
TLB	Ezekiel	31	8	This tree was taller than any other in the garden of God ; no cypress had branches equal to it ; none had boughs to compare ; none equaled it in beauty .
TLB	Ezekiel	31	9	Because of the magnificence that I gave it , it was the envy of all the other trees of Eden. ’
TLB	Ezekiel	31	10	“ But Egypt [ b ] has become proud and arrogant , ” the Lord God says . “ Therefore because she has set herself so high above the others , reaching to the clouds ,
TLB	Ezekiel	31	11	I will deliver her into the hands of a mighty nation , to destroy her as her wickedness deserves . I , myself , will cut her down .
TLB	Ezekiel	31	12	A foreign army ( from Babylon ) —the terror of the nations—will invade her land and cut her down and leave her fallen on the ground . Her branches will be scattered across the mountains and valleys and rivers of the land . All those who live beneath her shade will go away and leave her lying there .
TLB	Ezekiel	31	13	The birds will pluck off her twigs , and the wild animals will lie among her branches ;
TLB	Ezekiel	31	14	let no other nation exult with pride for its own prosperity , though it be higher than the clouds , for all are doomed , and they will land in hell along with all the proud men of the world. ”
TLB	Ezekiel	31	15	The Lord God says : “ When she fell , I made the oceans mourn for her and restrained their tides . [ c ] I clothed Lebanon in black and caused the trees of Lebanon to weep .
TLB	Ezekiel	31	16	I made the nations shake with fear at the sound of her fall , for I threw her down to hell with all the others like her . And all the other proud trees of Eden , the choicest and the best of Lebanon , the ones whose roots went deep into the water , are comforted to find her there with them in hell .
TLB	Ezekiel	31	17	Her allies , too , are all destroyed and perish with her . They went down with her to the netherworld—those nations that had lived beneath her shade .
TLB	Ezekiel	31	18	“ O Egypt , you are great and glorious among the trees of Eden—the nations of the world . And you will be brought down to the pit of hell with all these other nations . You will be among the nations you despise , killed by the sword . This is the fate of Pharaoh and all his teeming masses , ” says the Lord .

TLB	Ezekiel	32	2	“ Son of dust , mourn for Pharaoh , king of Egypt and say to him : ‘ You think of yourself as a strong young lion among the nations , but you are merely a crocodile [ a ] along the banks of the Nile , making bubbles and muddying the stream. ’ ”
TLB	Ezekiel	32	3	The Lord God says : “ I will send a great army to catch you with my net . I will haul you out
TLB	Ezekiel	32	4	and leave you stranded on the land to die . And all the birds of the heavens will light upon you , and the wild animals of the whole earth will devour you until they are glutted and full .
TLB	Ezekiel	32	5	And I will cover the hills with your flesh and fill the valleys with your bones .
TLB	Ezekiel	32	6	And I will drench the earth with your gushing blood , filling the ravines to the tops of the mountains .
TLB	Ezekiel	32	7	I will blot you out , and I will veil the heavens and darken the stars . I will cover the sun with a cloud , and the moon shall not give you her light .
TLB	Ezekiel	32	8	Yes , darkness will be everywhere across your land—even the bright stars will be dark above you .
TLB	Ezekiel	32	9	“ And when I destroy you , [ b ] grief will be in many hearts among the distant nations you have never seen .
TLB	Ezekiel	32	10	Yes , terror shall strike in many lands , and their kings shall be terribly afraid because of all I do to you . They shall shudder with terror when I brandish my sword before them . They shall greatly tremble for their lives on the day of your fall. ”
TLB	Ezekiel	32	11	For the Lord God says : “ The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon you .
TLB	Ezekiel	32	12	I will destroy you with Babylon ’ s mighty army—the terror of the nations . It will smash the pride of Egypt and all her people ; all will perish .
TLB	Ezekiel	32	13	I will destroy all your flocks and herds that graze beside the streams , and neither man nor animal will disturb those waters anymore .
TLB	Ezekiel	32	14	Therefore , the waters of Egypt will be as clear and flow as smoothly as olive oil , ” the Lord God says .
TLB	Ezekiel	32	15	“ And when I destroy Egypt and wipe out everything she has , then she shall know that I , the Lord , have done it .
TLB	Ezekiel	32	16	Yes , cry for the sorrows of Egypt . Let all the nations weep for her and for her people , ” says the Lord .
TLB	Ezekiel	32	17	Two weeks later , [ c ] another message came to me from the Lord . He said :
TLB	Ezekiel	32	18	“ Son of dust , weep for the people of Egypt and for the other mighty nations . Send them down to the netherworld among the denizens of death .
TLB	Ezekiel	32	19	What nation is as beautiful as you , O Egypt ? Yet your doom is the pit ; you will be laid beside the people you despise .
TLB	Ezekiel	32	20	The Egyptians will die with the multitudes slain by the sword , for the sword is drawn against the land of Egypt . She will be drawn down to judgment .
TLB	Ezekiel	32	21	The mighty warriors in the netherworld will welcome her as she arrives with all her friends , to lie there beside the nations she despised , all victims of the sword .
TLB	Ezekiel	32	22	“ The princes of Assyria lie there surrounded by the graves of all her people , those the sword has slain .
TLB	Ezekiel	32	23	Their graves are in the depths of hell , surrounded by their allies . All these mighty men who once struck terror into the hearts of everyone are now dead at the hands of their foes .
TLB	Ezekiel	32	24	“ Great kings of Elam lie there with their people . They scourged the nations while they lived , and now they lie undone in hell ; their fate is the same as that of ordinary men .
TLB	Ezekiel	32	25	They have a resting place among the slain , surrounded by the graves of all their people . Yes , they terrorized the nations while they lived , but now they lie in shame in the pit , slain by the sword .
TLB	Ezekiel	32	26	“ The princes of Meshech and Tubal are there , surrounded by the graves of all their armies—all of them idolaters—who once struck terror to the hearts of all ; now they lie dead .
TLB	Ezekiel	32	27	They are buried in a common grave and not as the fallen lords who are buried in great honor with their weapons beside them , with their shields covering them and their swords beneath their heads . [ d ] They were a terror to all while they lived .
TLB	Ezekiel	32	28	Now you will lie crushed and broken among the idolaters , among those who are slain by the sword .
TLB	Ezekiel	32	29	“ Edom is there with her kings and her princes ; mighty as they were , they too lie among the others whom the sword has slain , with the idolaters who have gone down to the pit .
TLB	Ezekiel	32	30	All the princes of the north are there and the Sidonians , all slain . Once a terror , now they lie in shame ; they lie in ignominy with all the other slain who go down to the pit .
TLB	Ezekiel	32	31	“ When Pharaoh arrives , he will be comforted to find that he is not alone in having all his army slain , ” says the Lord God .

TLB	Ezekiel	33	33	But when all these terrible things happen to them—as they will—then they will know a prophet has been among them. ” Footnotes - Ezekiel 33:21 In the eleventh year . Some manuscripts read , “ In the twelfth year. ” - Ezekiel 33:30 Come on , let ’ s have some fun ! Let ’ s go hear him tell us what the Lord is saying ! literally , “ Come and let us hear what the word is that comes from the Lord ! ” The Living Bible copyright ©
TLB	Ezekiel	33	2	“ Son of dust , tell your people : ‘ When I bring an army against a country , and the people of that land choose a watchman ,
TLB	Ezekiel	33	3	and when he sees the army coming and blows the alarm to warn them ,
TLB	Ezekiel	33	4	then anyone who hears the alarm but refuses to heed it—well , if he dies , the fault is his own .
TLB	Ezekiel	33	5	For he heard the warning and wouldn ’ t listen ; the fault is his . If he had heeded the warning , he would have saved his life .
TLB	Ezekiel	33	6	But if the watchman sees the enemy coming and doesn ’ t sound the alarm and warn the people , he is responsible for their deaths . They will die in their sins , but I will charge the watchman with their deaths. ’
TLB	Ezekiel	33	7	“ So with you , son of dust . I have appointed you as a watchman for the people of Israel ; therefore , listen to what I say and warn them for me .
TLB	Ezekiel	33	8	When I say to the wicked , ‘ O wicked man , you will die ! ’ and you don ’ t tell him what I say , so that he does not repent—that wicked person will die in his sins , but I will hold you responsible for his death .
TLB	Ezekiel	33	9	But if you warn him to repent and he doesn ’ t , he will die in his sins , and you will not be responsible .
TLB	Ezekiel	33	10	“ O people of Israel , you are saying : ‘ Our sins are heavy upon us ; we pine away with guilt . How can we live ? ’
TLB	Ezekiel	33	11	Tell them : ‘ As I live , says the Lord God , I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked ; I desire that the wicked turn from his evil ways and live . Turn , turn from your wickedness , for why will you die , O Israel ?
TLB	Ezekiel	33	12	For the good works of a righteous man will not save him if he turns to sin ; and the sins of an evil man will not destroy him if he repents and turns from his sins. ’
TLB	Ezekiel	33	13	“ I have said the good man will live . But if he sins , expecting his past goodness to save him , then none of his good deeds will be remembered . I will destroy him for his sins .
TLB	Ezekiel	33	14	And when I tell the wicked he will die , and then he turns from his sins and does what is fair and right—
TLB	Ezekiel	33	15	if he gives back the borrower ’ s pledge , returns what he has stolen , and walks along the paths of right , not doing evil—he shall surely live . He shall not die .
TLB	Ezekiel	33	16	None of his past sins shall be brought up against him , for he has turned to the good and shall surely live .
TLB	Ezekiel	33	17	“ And yet your people are saying the Lord isn ’ t fair . The trouble is they aren ’ t fair .
TLB	Ezekiel	33	18	For again I say , when the good man turns to evil , he shall die .
TLB	Ezekiel	33	19	But if the wicked turns from his wickedness and does what ’ s fair and just , he shall live .
TLB	Ezekiel	33	20	Yet you are saying the Lord isn ’ t fair . But I will judge each of you in accordance with his deeds. ”
TLB	Ezekiel	33	21	In the eleventh year [ a ] of our exile , late in December , one of those who escaped from Jerusalem arrived to tell me , “ The city has fallen ! ”
TLB	Ezekiel	33	22	Now the hand of the Lord had been upon me the previous evening , and he had healed me so that I could speak again by the time the man arrived .
TLB	Ezekiel	33	23	Then this message came to me :
TLB	Ezekiel	33	24	“ Son of dust , the scattered remnants of Judah living among the ruined cities keep saying , ‘ Abraham was only one man and yet he got possession of the whole country ! We are many , so we should certainly be able to get it back ! ’
TLB	Ezekiel	33	25	But the Lord God says : ‘ You are powerless , for you do evil ! You eat meat with the blood , you worship idols , and murder . Do you suppose I ’ ll let you have the land ?
TLB	Ezekiel	33	26	Murderers ! Idolators ! Adulterers ! Should you possess the land ? ’
TLB	Ezekiel	33	27	“ Tell them , ‘ The Lord God says : As I live , surely those living in the ruins shall die by the sword . Those living in the open fields shall be eaten by wild animals , and those in the forts and caves shall die of disease .
TLB	Ezekiel	33	28	I will desolate the land and her pride , and her power shall come to an end . And the mountain villages of Israel shall be so ruined that no one will even travel through them .
TLB	Ezekiel	33	29	When I have ruined the land because of their sins , then they shall know I am the Lord. ’
TLB	Ezekiel	33	30	“ Son of dust , your people are whispering behind your back . They talk about you in their houses and whisper about you at the doors , saying , ‘ Come on , let ’ s have some fun ! Let ’ s go hear him tell us what the Lord is saying ! ’ [ b ]
TLB	Ezekiel	33	31	So they come as though they are sincere and sit before you listening . But they have no intention of doing what I tell them to ; they talk very sweetly about loving the Lord , but with their hearts they are loving their money .
TLB	Ezekiel	33	32	You are very entertaining to them , like someone who sings lovely songs with a beautiful voice or plays well on an instrument . They hear what you say but don ’ t pay any attention to it !

TLB	Ezekiel	34	34	Then this message came to me from the Lord :
TLB	Ezekiel	34	2	“ Son of dust , prophesy against the shepherds , the leaders of Israel . Say to them , ‘ The Lord God says to you : Woe to the shepherds who feed themselves instead of their flocks . Shouldn ’ t shepherds feed the sheep ?
TLB	Ezekiel	34	3	You eat the best food and wear the finest clothes , but you let your flocks starve .
TLB	Ezekiel	34	4	You haven ’ t taken care of the weak , nor tended the sick , nor bound up the broken bones , nor gone looking for those who have wandered away and are lost . Instead , you have ruled them with force and cruelty .
TLB	Ezekiel	34	5	So they were scattered , without a shepherd . They have become a prey to every animal that comes along .
TLB	Ezekiel	34	6	My sheep wandered through the mountains and hills and over the face of the earth , and there was no one to search for them or care about them .
TLB	Ezekiel	34	7	“ ‘ Therefore , O shepherds , hear the word of the Lord :
TLB	Ezekiel	34	8	As I live , says the Lord God , you abandoned my flock , leaving them to be attacked and destroyed , and you were no real shepherds at all , for you didn ’ t search for them . You fed yourselves and let them starve ; 9-10 therefore , I am against the shepherds , and I will hold them responsible for what has happened to my flock . I will take away their right to feed the flock—and take away their right to eat . I will save my flock from being taken for their food. ’ ”
TLB	Ezekiel	34	11	For the Lord God says : “ I will search and find my sheep .
TLB	Ezekiel	34	12	I will be like a shepherd looking for his flock . I will find my sheep and rescue them from all the places they were scattered in that dark and cloudy day .
TLB	Ezekiel	34	13	And I will bring them back from among the people and nations where they were , back home to their own land of Israel , and I will feed them upon the mountains of Israel and by the rivers where the land is fertile and good .
TLB	Ezekiel	34	14	Yes , I will give them good pasture on the high hills of Israel . There they will lie down in peace and feed in luscious mountain pastures . 15-16 I myself will be the Shepherd of my sheep and cause them to lie down in peace , ” the Lord God says . “ I will seek my lost ones , those who strayed away , and bring them safely home again . I will put splints and bandages upon their broken limbs and heal the sick . And I will destroy the powerful , fat shepherds ; I will feed them , yes—feed them punishment !
TLB	Ezekiel	34	17	“ And as for you , O my flock—my people , ” the Lord God says , “ I will judge you and separate good from bad , sheep from goats .
TLB	Ezekiel	34	18	“ Is it a small thing to you , O evil shepherds , that you not only keep the best of the pastures for yourselves , but trample down the rest ? That you take the best water for yourselves and muddy the rest with your feet ?
TLB	Ezekiel	34	19	All that ’ s left for my flock is what you ’ ve trampled down ; all they have to drink is water that you ’ ve fouled. ”
TLB	Ezekiel	34	20	Therefore the Lord God says : “ I will surely judge between these fat shepherds and their scrawny sheep .
TLB	Ezekiel	34	21	For these shepherds push and butt and crowd my sick and hungry flock until they ’ re scattered far away .
TLB	Ezekiel	34	22	So I myself will save my flock ; no more will they be picked on and destroyed . And I will notice which is plump and which is thin , and why !
TLB	Ezekiel	34	23	“ And I will set one Shepherd over all my people , even my Servant David . He shall feed them and be a Shepherd to them .
TLB	Ezekiel	34	24	“ And I , the Lord , will be their God , and my Servant David shall be a Prince among my people . I , the Lord , have spoken it .
TLB	Ezekiel	34	25	“ I will make a peace pact with them and drive away the dangerous animals from the land , so that my people can safely camp in the wildest places and sleep safely in the woods .
TLB	Ezekiel	34	26	I will make my people and their homes around my hill a blessing . And there shall be showers , showers of blessing , for I will not shut off the rains but send them in their seasons .
TLB	Ezekiel	34	27	Their fruit trees and fields will yield bumper crops , and everyone will live in safety . When I have broken off their chains of slavery and delivered them from those who profiteered at their expense , they shall know I am the Lord .
TLB	Ezekiel	34	28	No more will other nations conquer them nor wild animals attack . They shall live in safety and no one shall make them afraid .
TLB	Ezekiel	34	29	“ And I will raise up a notable Vine ( the Messiah ) , [ a ] in Israel so that my people will never again go hungry nor be shamed by heathen conquest .
TLB	Ezekiel	34	30	In this way they will know that I , the Lord their God , am with them , and that they , the people of Israel , are my people , ” says the Lord God .
TLB	Ezekiel	34	31	“ You are my flock , the sheep of my pasture . You are my men and I am your God , so says the Lord. ” Footnotes - Ezekiel 34:29 a notable Vine ( the Messiah ) , literally , “ a plant of renown ” ; so perhaps the meaning is , “ I will give them bumper crops. ” Either translation is permissible , but the word for “ plant ” is in the singular .

TLB	Ezekiel	35	35	Again a message came from the Lord . He said :
TLB	Ezekiel	35	2	“ Son of dust , face toward Mount Seir and prophesy against the people saying ,
TLB	Ezekiel	35	3	‘ The Lord God says : I am against you , and I will smash you with my fist and utterly destroy you . 4-5 Because you hate my people Israel , I will demolish your cities and make you desolate , and then you shall know I am the Lord . You butchered my people when they were helpless , when I had punished them for all their sins .
TLB	Ezekiel	35	6	As I live , the Lord God says , since you enjoy blood so much , I will give you a blood bath—your turn has come !
TLB	Ezekiel	35	7	I will utterly wipe out the people of Mount Seir , killing off all those who try to escape and all those who return .
TLB	Ezekiel	35	8	I will fill your mountains with the dead—your hills , your valleys , and your rivers will be filled with those the sword has killed .
TLB	Ezekiel	35	9	Never again will you revive . You will be abandoned forever ; your cities will never be rebuilt . Then you shall know I am the Lord .
TLB	Ezekiel	35	10	“ ‘ For you said , “ Both Israel and Judah shall be mine . We will take possession of them . What do we care that God is there ! ”
TLB	Ezekiel	35	11	Therefore as I live , the Lord God says , I will pay back your angry deeds with mine—I will punish you for all your acts of envy and of hate . And I will honor my name in Israel by what I do to you .
TLB	Ezekiel	35	12	And you shall know that I have heard each evil word you spoke against the Lord , saying , “ His people are helpless ; they are food for us to eat ! ”
TLB	Ezekiel	35	13	Saying that , you boasted great words against the Lord . And I have heard them all !
TLB	Ezekiel	35	14	“ ‘ The whole world will rejoice when I make you desolate .
TLB	Ezekiel	35	15	You rejoiced at Israel ’ s fearful fate . Now I will rejoice at yours ! You will be wiped out , O people of Mount Seir and all who live in Edom ! And then you will know I am the Lord ! ’ The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Ezekiel	36	36	Then the nations all around—all those still left—will know that I , the Lord , rebuilt the ruins and planted lush crops in the wilderness . For I , the Lord , have promised it , and I will do it. ” 37-38 The Lord God says : “ I am ready to hear Israel ’ s prayers for these blessings and to grant them their requests . Let them but ask , and I will multiply them like the flocks that fill Jerusalem ’ s streets at the time of sacrifice . The ruined cities will be crowded once more , and everyone will know I am the Lord. ” Footnotes - Ezekiel 36:17 as filthy rags , literally , “ as a menstruous cloth. ” - Ezekiel 36:23 by delivering you from exile among them , implied . - Ezekiel 36:26 hearts of love , literally , “ hearts of flesh , ” in contrast to “ hearts of stone. ” The Living Bible copyright ©
TLB	Ezekiel	36	2	“ ‘ Your enemies have sneered at you and claimed your ancient heights as theirs ;
TLB	Ezekiel	36	3	they have destroyed you on every side and sent you away as slaves to many lands . You are mocked and slandered .
TLB	Ezekiel	36	4	Therefore , O mountains of Israel , hear the word of the Lord God . He says to the hills and mountains , dales and valleys , and to the ruined farms and the long-deserted cities , destroyed and mocked by heathen nations all around :
TLB	Ezekiel	36	5	My anger is afire against these nations , especially Edom , for grabbing my land with relish , in utter contempt for me , to take it for themselves. ’
TLB	Ezekiel	36	6	“ Therefore prophesy and say to the hills and mountains , dales and valleys of Israel : ‘ This is what the Lord God says ! I am full of fury because you suffered shame before the surrounding nations .
TLB	Ezekiel	36	7	Therefore , I have sworn with hand held high that those nations are going to have their turn of being covered with shame ,
TLB	Ezekiel	36	8	but for Israel good times will return . There will be heavy crops of fruit to prepare for my people ’ s return—and they will be coming home again soon !
TLB	Ezekiel	36	9	See , I am for you , and I will come and help you as you prepare the ground and sow your crops .
TLB	Ezekiel	36	10	I will greatly increase your population throughout all Israel , and the ruined cities will be rebuilt and filled with people .
TLB	Ezekiel	36	11	Not only the people , but your flocks and herds will also greatly multiply . O mountains of Israel , again you will be filled with homes . I will do even more for you than I did before . Then you shall know I am the Lord .
TLB	Ezekiel	36	12	My people will walk upon you once again , and you will belong to them again ; and you will no longer be a place for burning their children on idol altars. ’ ”
TLB	Ezekiel	36	13	The Lord God says : “ Now the other nations taunt you , saying , ‘ Israel is a land that devours her people ! ’
TLB	Ezekiel	36	14	But they will not say this anymore . Your birthrate will rise , and your infant mortality rate will drop off sharply , ” says the Lord .
TLB	Ezekiel	36	15	“ No longer will those heathen nations sneer , for you will no longer be a nation of sinners , ” the Lord God says .
TLB	Ezekiel	36	16	Then this further word came to me from the Lord :
TLB	Ezekiel	36	17	“ Son of dust , when the people of Israel were living in their own country , they defiled it by their evil deeds ; to me their worship was as foul as filthy rags . [ a ]
TLB	Ezekiel	36	18	They polluted the land with murder and with the worshiping of idols , so I poured out my fury upon them .
TLB	Ezekiel	36	19	And I exiled them to many lands ; that is how I punished them for the evil way they lived .
TLB	Ezekiel	36	20	But when they were scattered out among the nations , then they were a blight upon my holy name because the nations said , ‘ These are the people of God and he couldn ’ t protect them from harm ! ’
TLB	Ezekiel	36	21	I am concerned about my reputation that was ruined by my people throughout the world .
TLB	Ezekiel	36	22	“ Therefore say to the people of Israel , ‘ The Lord God says : I am bringing you back again , but not because you deserve it ; I am doing it to protect my holy name , which you tarnished among the nations .
TLB	Ezekiel	36	23	I will honor my great name , that you defiled , and the people of the world shall know I am the Lord . I will be honored before their eyes by delivering you from exile among them . [ b ]
TLB	Ezekiel	36	24	For I will bring you back home again to the land of Israel .
TLB	Ezekiel	36	25	“ ‘ Then it will be as though I had sprinkled clean water on you , for you will be clean—your filthiness will be washed away , your idol worship gone .
TLB	Ezekiel	36	26	And I will give you a new heart—I will give you new and right desires—and put a new spirit within you . I will take out your stony hearts of sin and give you new hearts of love . [ c ]
TLB	Ezekiel	36	27	And I will put my Spirit within you so that you will obey my laws and do whatever I command .
TLB	Ezekiel	36	28	“ ‘ And you shall live in Israel , the land which I gave your fathers long ago . And you shall be my people , and I will be your God .
TLB	Ezekiel	36	29	I will cleanse away your sins . I will abolish crop failures and famine .
TLB	Ezekiel	36	30	I will give you huge harvests from your fruit trees and fields , and never again will the surrounding nations be able to scoff at your land for its famines .
TLB	Ezekiel	36	31	Then you will remember your past sins and loathe yourselves for all the evils you did .
TLB	Ezekiel	36	32	But always remember this : It is not for your own sakes that I will do this , but for mine . O my people Israel , be utterly ashamed of all that you have done ! ’ ”
TLB	Ezekiel	36	33	The Lord God says : “ When I cleanse you from your sins , I will bring you home again to Israel , and rebuild the ruins .
TLB	Ezekiel	36	34	Acreage will be cultivated again that through the years of exile lay empty as a barren wilderness ; all who passed by were shocked to see the extent of ruin in your land .
TLB	Ezekiel	36	35	But when I bring you back , they will say , ‘ This God-forsaken land has become like Eden ’ s garden ! The ruined cities are rebuilt and walled and filled with people ! ’

TLB	Ezekiel	37	37	1-2 The power of the Lord was upon me and I was carried away by the Spirit of the Lord to a valley full of old , dry bones that were scattered everywhere across the ground . He led me around among them ,
TLB	Ezekiel	37	3	and then he said to me : “ Son of dust , can these bones become people again ? ” I replied , “ Lord , you alone know the answer to that. ”
TLB	Ezekiel	37	4	Then he told me to speak to the bones and say : “ O dry bones , listen to the words of God ,
TLB	Ezekiel	37	5	for the Lord God says , ‘ See ! I am going to make you live and breathe again !
TLB	Ezekiel	37	6	I will replace the flesh and muscles on you and cover you with skin . I will put breath into you , and you shall live and know I am the Lord. ’ ”
TLB	Ezekiel	37	7	So I spoke these words from God , just as he told me to ; and suddenly there was a rattling noise from all across the valley , and the bones of each body came together and attached to each other as they used to be .
TLB	Ezekiel	37	8	Then , as I watched , the muscles and flesh formed over the bones , and skin covered them , but the bodies had no breath .
TLB	Ezekiel	37	9	Then he told me to call to the wind and say : “ The Lord God says : Come from the four winds , O Spirit , and breathe upon these slain bodies , that they may live again. ”
TLB	Ezekiel	37	10	So I spoke to the winds as he commanded me , and the bodies began breathing ; they lived and stood up—a very great army .
TLB	Ezekiel	37	11	Then he told me what the vision meant : “ These bones , ” he said , “ represent all the people of Israel . They say : ‘ We have become a heap of dried-out bones—all hope is gone. ’
TLB	Ezekiel	37	12	But tell them , ‘ The Lord God says : My people , I will open your graves of exile and cause you to rise again and return to the land of Israel .
TLB	Ezekiel	37	13	And , then at last , O my people , you will know I am the Lord .
TLB	Ezekiel	37	14	I will put my Spirit into you , and you shall live and return home again to your own land . Then you will know that I , the Lord , have done just what I promised you. ’ ”
TLB	Ezekiel	37	15	Again a message from the Lord came to me , saying :
TLB	Ezekiel	37	16	“ Take a stick and carve on it these words : ‘ This stick represents Judah and her allied tribes. ’ Then take another stick and carve these words on it : ‘ This stick represents all the other tribes of Israel. ’
TLB	Ezekiel	37	17	Now hold them together in your hand as one stick . 18-20 Tell these people ( holding the sticks so they can see what you are doing ) , the Lord God says : ‘ I will take the tribes of Israel and join them to Judah and make them one stick in my hand. ’ ”
TLB	Ezekiel	37	21	For the Lord God says : “ I am gathering the people of Israel from among the nations and bringing them home from around the world to their own land ,
TLB	Ezekiel	37	22	to unify them into one nation . One king shall be king of them all ; no longer shall they be divided into two nations .
TLB	Ezekiel	37	23	They shall stop polluting themselves with idols and their other sins , for I will save them from all this foulness . Then they shall truly be my people and I their God .
TLB	Ezekiel	37	24	“ And David , my Servant—the Messiah—shall be their King , their only Shepherd ; and they shall obey my laws and all my wishes .
TLB	Ezekiel	37	25	They shall live in the land of Israel where their fathers lived , the land I gave my servant Jacob . They and their children after them shall live there , and their grandchildren , for all generations . And my Servant David , their Messiah , shall be their Prince forever .
TLB	Ezekiel	37	26	And I will make a covenant of peace with them , an everlasting pact . I will bless them and multiply them and put my Temple among them forever .

TLB	Ezekiel	38	38	Here is another message to me from the Lord : 2-3 “ Son of dust , face northward [ a ] toward the land of Magog and prophesy against Gog king of Meshech and Tubal . Tell him that the Lord God says : ‘ I am against you , Gog .
TLB	Ezekiel	38	4	I will put hooks into your jaws and pull you to your doom . I will mobilize your troops and armored cavalry and make you a mighty host , all fully armed .
TLB	Ezekiel	38	5	Peras , Cush , Put shall join you too with all their weaponry ,
TLB	Ezekiel	38	6	and so shall Gomer and all his hordes and the armies of Togarmah from the distant north , as well as many others .
TLB	Ezekiel	38	7	Be prepared ! Stay mobilized . You are their leader , Gog !
TLB	Ezekiel	38	8	“ ‘ A long time from now you will be called to action . In distant years you will swoop down onto the land of Israel that will be lying in peace after the return of its people from many lands .
TLB	Ezekiel	38	9	You and all your allies—a vast and awesome army—will roll down upon them like a storm and cover the land like a cloud .
TLB	Ezekiel	38	10	For at that time an evil thought will have come to your mind .
TLB	Ezekiel	38	11	You will have said , “ Israel is an unprotected land of unwalled villages ! I will march against her and destroy these people living in such confidence !
TLB	Ezekiel	38	12	I will go to those once-desolate cities that are now filled with people again—those who have returned from all the nations—and I will capture vast amounts of loot and many slaves . For the people are rich with cattle now , and the whole earth revolves around them ! ” ’
TLB	Ezekiel	38	13	“ But Sheba and Dedan [ b ] and the merchant princes of Tarshish with whom she trades will ask , ‘ Who are you to rob them of silver and gold and drive away their cattle and seize their goods and make them poor ? ’ ”
TLB	Ezekiel	38	14	The Lord God says to Gog : “ When my people are living in peace in their land , then you will rouse yourself . 15-16 You will come from all over the north with your vast host of cavalry and cover the land like a cloud . This will happen in the distant future—in the latter years of history . [ c ] I will bring you against my land , and my holiness will be vindicated in your terrible destruction before their eyes , so that all the nations will know that I am God. ”
TLB	Ezekiel	38	17	The Lord God says : “ You are the one I spoke of long ago through the prophets of Israel , saying that after many years had passed , I would bring you against my people .
TLB	Ezekiel	38	18	But when you come to destroy the land of Israel , my fury will rise !
TLB	Ezekiel	38	19	For in my jealousy and blazing wrath , I promise a mighty shaking in the land of Israel on that day .
TLB	Ezekiel	38	20	All living things shall quake in terror at my presence ; mountains shall be thrown down ; cliffs shall tumble ; walls shall crumble to the earth .
TLB	Ezekiel	38	21	I will summon every kind of terror against you , ” says the Lord God , “ and you will fight against yourselves in mortal combat !
TLB	Ezekiel	38	22	I will fight you with sword , disease , torrential floods , great hailstones , fire , and brimstone !
TLB	Ezekiel	38	23	Thus will I show my greatness and bring honor upon my name , and all the nations of the world will hear what I have done and know that I am God ! Footnotes - Ezekiel 38:2 face northward , implied . against Gog . The names of Gog ’ s confederates ( Meshech , Tubal , Gomer , Beth-togarmah ) can be identified as Muschki , Tabal , Gimaraya , Tegerama , peoples who lived in the mountainous area southeast of the Black Sea and southwest of the Caspian , currently in central Turkey . It therefore seems that Gog was , or is to be , the leader of one of these nations . But from the context Gog seems to be a symbol rather than a historical figure like Nebuchadnezzar . In any event he represents the aggregate military might of the forces opposed to God , especially in a mighty battle of the end times . See also Revelation 20:7-9 . - Ezekiel 38:13 Sheba and Dedan , great trading centers in Arabia . the merchant princes of Tarshish with whom she trades , implied . - Ezekiel 38:15 in the latter years of history , implied ; literally , “ in the latter days , ” an expression which , in Hebrew usage , does not necessarily mean “ the end times. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Ezekiel	39	3	I will knock your weapons from your hands and leave you helpless .
TLB	Ezekiel	39	4	You and all your vast armies will die upon the mountains . I will give you to the vultures and wild animals to devour you .
TLB	Ezekiel	39	5	You will never reach the cities—you will fall upon the open fields ; for I have spoken , the Lord God says .
TLB	Ezekiel	39	6	And I will rain down fire on Magog and on all your allies who live safely on the coasts , and they shall know I am the Lord .
TLB	Ezekiel	39	7	“ ‘ Thus I will make known my holy name among my people Israel ; I will not let it be mocked at anymore . And the nations , too , shall know I am the Lord , the Holy One of Israel .

TLB	Ezekiel	39	9	“ ‘ The people of the cities of Israel will go out and pick up your shields and bucklers , bows and arrows , javelins and spears , to use for fuel—enough to last them seven years .
TLB	Ezekiel	39	10	For seven years they will need nothing else for their fires . They won ’ t cut wood from the fields or forests , for these weapons will give them all they need . They will use the possessions of those who abused them .
TLB	Ezekiel	39	11	“ ‘ And I will make a vast graveyard for Gog and his armies in the Valley of the Travelers , east of the Dead Sea . It will block the path of the travelers . There Gog and all his armies will be buried . And they will change the name of the place to “ The Valley of Gog ’ s Army. ”
TLB	Ezekiel	39	12	It will take seven months for the people of Israel to bury the bodies .
TLB	Ezekiel	39	13	Everyone in Israel will help , for it will be a glorious victory for Israel on that day when I demonstrate my glory , says the Lord .
TLB	Ezekiel	39	14	At the end of the seven months , they will appoint men to search the land systematically for any skeletons left and bury them , so that the land will be cleansed . 15-16 Whenever anyone sees some bones , he will put up a marker beside them so that the buriers will see them and take them to the Valley of Gog ’ s Army to bury them . A city named “ Multitude ” is there ! And so the land will finally be cleansed. ’
TLB	Ezekiel	39	17	“ And now , son of dust , call all the birds and animals and say to them : ‘ Gather together for a mighty sacrificial feast . Come from far and near to the mountains of Israel . Come , eat the flesh and drink the blood !
TLB	Ezekiel	39	18	Eat the flesh of mighty men and drink the blood of princes—they are the rams , the lambs , the goats , and the fat young bulls of Bashan for my feast !
TLB	Ezekiel	39	19	Gorge yourselves with flesh until you are glutted , drink blood until you are drunk ; this is the sacrificial feast I have prepared for you .

TLB	Ezekiel	39	23	And the nations will know why Israel was sent away to exile—it was punishment for sin , for they acted in treachery against their God . Therefore , I turned my face away from them and let their enemies destroy them .
TLB	Ezekiel	39	24	I turned my face away and punished them in proportion to the vileness of their sins .

TLB	Ezekiel	40	40	Outside the entry hall , on each side of the stairs going up to the north entrance , there were two more tables .
TLB	Ezekiel	40	2	and in a vision he took me to the land of Israel and set me down on a high mountain where I saw what appeared to be a city opposite me .
TLB	Ezekiel	40	3	or
TLB	Ezekiel	40	4	inches long , fastened along the walls of the entry hall , and on the tables the flesh of the offering was to be laid .
TLB	Ezekiel	40	5	The man began to measure the wall around the outside of the Temple area with his measuring stick , which was 10-1/2 feet long . He told me , “ This wall is 10-1/2 feet high and 10-1/2 feet wide. ”
TLB	Ezekiel	40	6	Then he took me over to the passageway that goes through the eastern wall . We climbed the seven steps into the entrance , and he measured the entry hall of the passage ; it was 10-1/2 feet wide . 7-12 Walking on through the passageway I saw that there were three guardrooms on each side ; each of these rooms was 10-1/2 feet square , with a distance of 8-3/4 feet along the wall between them . In front of these rooms was a low barrier
TLB	Ezekiel	40	18	inches wide , or an 18-inch pillar in front of ( or between ) the guardrooms , projecting out into the hallway . - Ezekiel 40:19 ( which was called “ the outer court ” of the Temple ) , implied . - Ezekiel 40:28 Some manuscripts add to this verse : “ And the arches around it were 37-1/2 feet by 8-3/4 feet broad. ” - Ezekiel 40:29 Verse
TLB	Ezekiel	40	13	Then he measured the entire outside width of the passageway , measuring across the roof from the outside doors of the guardrooms ; this distance was 43-3/4 feet .
TLB	Ezekiel	40	14	Then he estimated the pillars on each side of the porch to be about
TLB	Ezekiel	40	100	feet high .
TLB	Ezekiel	40	15	The full length of the entrance passage was 87-1/2 feet from one end to the other .
TLB	Ezekiel	40	16	There were windows that narrowed inward through the walls along both sides of the passageway and along the guardroom walls . The windows were also in the exit and in the entrance halls . The pillars were decorated with palm tree decorations .
TLB	Ezekiel	40	17	And so we passed through the passageway to the court inside . A stone pavement ran around the inside of the walls , and thirty rooms were built against the walls , opening onto this pavement .
TLB	Ezekiel	40	19	Then he measured across to the wall on the other side of this court ( which was called “ the outer court ” of the Temple ) [ c ] and found that the distance was
TLB	Ezekiel	40	175	feet square , and there was an altar in the court , standing in front of the Temple . 48-49 Then he brought me to the entrance hall of the Temple . Ten steps led up to it from the inner court . Its walls extended up on either side to form two pillars , each of them 8-3/4 feet thick . The entrance was 24-1/2 feet wide with 5-1/4-foot walls . Thus the entry hall was
TLB	Ezekiel	40	20	As I followed , he left the eastern passageway and went over to the passage through the northern wall and measured it .
TLB	Ezekiel	40	21	Here , too , there were three guardrooms on each side , and all the measurements were the same as for the east passageway—87-1/2 feet long and 43-3/4 feet from side to side across the top of the guardrooms .
TLB	Ezekiel	40	22	There were windows , an entry hall , and the palm tree decorations just the same as on the east side . And there were seven steps leading up to the doorway to the entry hall inside .
TLB	Ezekiel	40	23	Here at the north entry , just as at the east , if one walked through the passageway into the court and straight across it , he came to an inner wall and a passageway through it to an inner court . The distance between the two passageways was
TLB	Ezekiel	40	24	Then he took me around to the south gate and measured the various sections of its passageway and found they were just the same as in the others .
TLB	Ezekiel	40	25	It had windows along the walls as the others did , and an entry hall . And like the others , it was 87-1/2 feet long and 43-3/4 feet wide .
TLB	Ezekiel	40	26	It , too , had a stairway of seven steps leading up to it , and there were palm tree decorations along the walls .
TLB	Ezekiel	40	27	And here again , if one walked through the passageway into the court and straight across it , he came to the inner wall and a passageway through it to the inner court . And the distance between the passageways was
TLB	Ezekiel	40	28	Then he took me over to the inner wall and its south passageway . He measured this passageway and found that it had the same measurements as the passageways of the outer wall . [ d ] 29-30 Its guardrooms , pillars , and entrance and exit hall were identical to all the others , and so were the windows along its walls and entry . And , like the others , it was 87-1/2 feet long by 43-3/4 feet wide . [ e ]
TLB	Ezekiel	40	31	The only difference was that it had eight steps leading up to it instead of seven . It had palm tree decorations on the pillars , just as the others .
TLB	Ezekiel	40	32	Then he took me along the court to the eastern entrance of the inner wall , and measured it . It , too , had the same measurements as the others .
TLB	Ezekiel	40	33	Its guardrooms , pillars , and entrance hall were the same size as those of the other passageways , and there were windows along the walls and in the entry hall ; and it was 87-1/2 feet long by 43-3/4 feet wide .
TLB	Ezekiel	40	34	Its entry hall faced the outer court , and there were palm tree decorations on its columns , but there were eight steps instead of seven going up to the entrance .
TLB	Ezekiel	40	35	feet wide and 19-1/4 feet long . Footnotes - Ezekiel 40:3 standing beside the Temple gate , implied . - Ezekiel 40:7
TLB	Ezekiel	40	36	The guardrooms , pillars , and entry hall of this passageway were the same as the others , with a length of 87-1/2 feet and a width of 43-3/4 feet .
TLB	Ezekiel	40	37	Its entry hall faced toward the outer court ; it had palm tree decorations on the walls of each side of the passageway , and there were eight steps leading up to the entrance .
TLB	Ezekiel	40	38	But a door led from its entry hall into a side room where the flesh of the sacrifices was washed before being taken to the altar ;
TLB	Ezekiel	40	39	on each side of the entry hall of the passageway there were two tables where the animals for sacrifice were slaughtered for the burnt offerings , sin offerings , and guilt offerings to be presented in the Temple .
TLB	Ezekiel	40	41	So , in all there were eight tables , four inside and four outside , where the sacrifices were cut up and prepared .
TLB	Ezekiel	40	42	There were also four stone tables where the butchering knives and other implements were laid . These tables were about 2-5/8 feet square and 1-3/4 feet high .
TLB	Ezekiel	40	43	There were hooks ,
TLB	Ezekiel	40	44	In the inner court there were two one-room buildings , one beside the northern entrance , facing south , and one beside the southern entrance , facing north .
TLB	Ezekiel	40	45	And he said to me : “ The building beside the inner northern gate is for the priests who supervise the maintenance .
TLB	Ezekiel	40	46	The building beside the inner southern entrance is for the priests in charge of the altar—the descendants of Zadok—for they alone of all the Levites may come near to the Lord to minister to him. ”
TLB	Ezekiel	40	47	Then he measured the inner court in front of the Temple [ f ] and found it to be
TLB	Ezekiel	40	30	, omitted in the Septuagint and several other of the ancient manuscripts , reads , “ There were vestibules round about , and they were 37-1/2 feet long and 8-3/4 feet broad. ” - Ezekiel 40:47 in front of the Temple , implied . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Ezekiel	41	41	Afterward he brought me into the nave , the large main room of the Temple , and measured the pillars that formed its doorway . They were 10-1/2 feet square .
TLB	Ezekiel	41	2	The entrance hall was 17-1/2 feet wide and 8-3/4 feet deep . The nave itself was
TLB	Ezekiel	41	70	feet long by
TLB	Ezekiel	41	35	feet square . “ This , ” he told me , “ is the Most Holy Place. ”
TLB	Ezekiel	41	3	Then he went into the inner room at the end of the nave and measured the columns at the entrance and found them to be 3-1/2 feet thick ; its doorway was 10-1/2 feet wide , with a hallway 12-1/4 feet deep behind it .
TLB	Ezekiel	41	4	The inner room was
TLB	Ezekiel	41	5	Then he measured the wall of the Temple and found that it was 10-1/2 feet thick , with a row of rooms along the outside . Each room was
TLB	Ezekiel	41	7	Each tier was wider than the one below it , corresponding to the narrowing of the Temple wall as it rose higher . A stairway at the side of the Temple led up from floor to floor .
TLB	Ezekiel	41	6	These rooms were in three tiers , one above the other , with thirty rooms in each tier . The whole structure was supported by girders and not attached to the Temple wall for support .
TLB	Ezekiel	41	8	I noticed that the Temple was built on a terrace and that the bottom row of rooms extended out 10-1/2 feet onto the terrace .
TLB	Ezekiel	41	9	The outer wall of these rooms was 8-3/4 feet thick , leaving a free space of 8-3/4 feet out to the edge of the terrace , the same on both sides .
TLB	Ezekiel	41	10	Thirty-five feet away from the terrace , on both sides of the Temple , was another row of rooms down in the inner court .
TLB	Ezekiel	41	11	Two doors opened from the tiers of rooms to the terrace yard , which was 8-3/4 feet wide ; one door faced north and the other south .
TLB	Ezekiel	41	12	A large building stood on the west , facing the Temple yard , measuring 122-1/2 feet wide by 157-1/2 feet long . Its walls were 8-3/4 feet thick .
TLB	Ezekiel	41	13	Then he measured the Temple and its immediately surrounding yards . The area was
TLB	Ezekiel	41	175	feet wide , 15-16 and so was the building west of the Temple , including its two walls . The nave of the Temple and the Holy of Holies and the entry hall were paneled , and all three had recessed windows . The inner walls of the Temple were paneled with wood above and below the windows . 17-18 The space above the door leading into the Holy of Holies was also paneled . The walls were decorated with carvings of Guardian Angels , each with two faces , and of palm trees alternating with the Guardian Angels . 19-20 One face—that of a man—looked toward the palm tree on one side , and the other face—that of a young lion—looked toward the palm tree on the other side . And so it was , all around the inner wall of the Temple .
TLB	Ezekiel	41	14	The inner court at the east of the Temple was also
TLB	Ezekiel	41	21	There were square doorposts at the doors of the nave , and in front of the Holy of Holies was what appeared to be an altar , but it was made of wood .
TLB	Ezekiel	41	22	This altar was 3-1/2 feet square and 5-1/4 feet high ; its corners , base , and sides were all of wood . “ This , ” he told me , “ is the Table of the Lord. ” [ a ]
TLB	Ezekiel	41	23	Both the nave and the Holy of Holies had double doors ,
TLB	Ezekiel	41	24	each with two swinging sections .
TLB	Ezekiel	41	25	The doors leading into the nave were decorated with cherubim and palm trees , just as on the walls . And there was a wooden canopy over the entry hall .
TLB	Ezekiel	41	26	There were recessed windows and carved palm trees on both sides of the entry hall , the hallways beside the Temple , and on the canopy over the entrance .

TLB	Ezekiel	42	42	Then he led me out of the Temple , back into the inner court to the rooms north of the Temple yard , and to another building .
TLB	Ezekiel	42	2	This group of structures was
TLB	Ezekiel	42	175	feet long . But a wall extended from the end of the shorter wing , parallel to the longer wing . 9-10 And there was an entrance from the outer court to these rooms from the east . On the opposite side of the Temple a similar building composed of two units of tiers was on the south side of the inner court , between the Temple and the outer court , arranged the same as the other .
TLB	Ezekiel	42	3	The rows of rooms behind this building were the inner wall of the court . The rooms were in three tiers , overlooking the outer court on one side , and having a 35-foot strip of inner court on the other .
TLB	Ezekiel	42	4	A 17-1/2-foot walk ran between the building and the tiers of rooms , extending the entire length , with the doors of the building facing north .
TLB	Ezekiel	42	5	The upper two tiers of rooms were not as wide as the lower one , because the upper tiers had wider walkways beside them .
TLB	Ezekiel	42	6	And since the building was not built with girders as those in the outer court were , the upper stories were set back from the ground floor . 7-8 The north tiers , next to the outer court , were 87-1/2 feet long—only half as long as the inner wing that faced the Temple court , which was
TLB	Ezekiel	42	11	There was a walk between the two wings of the building , the same as in the other building across the court—the same length and width and the same exits and doors—they were identical units .
TLB	Ezekiel	42	12	And there was a door from the outer court [ a ] at the east .
TLB	Ezekiel	42	13	Then he told me : “ These north and south tiers of rooms facing the Temple yard are holy ; there the priests who offer up the sacrifices to the Lord shall eat of the most holy offerings and store them—the cereal offerings , sin offerings , and guilt offerings , for these rooms are holy .
TLB	Ezekiel	42	14	When the priests leave the Holy Place—the nave of the Temple—they must change their clothes before going out to the outer court . The special robes in which they have been ministering must first be removed , for these robes are holy . They must put on other clothes before entering the parts of the building open to the public. ”
TLB	Ezekiel	42	15	When he had finished making these measurements , he led me out through the east passageway to measure the entire Temple area . 16-20 He found that it was in the form of a square ,
TLB	Ezekiel	42	875	feet long on each side , with a wall all around it to separate the restricted area from the public places .

TLB	Ezekiel	43	43	Afterward he brought me out again to the passageway through the outer wall leading to the east .
TLB	Ezekiel	43	2	And suddenly the glory of the God of Israel appeared from the east . The sound of his coming was like the roar of rushing waters , and the whole landscape lighted up with his glory .
TLB	Ezekiel	43	3	It was just as I had seen it in the other visions , first by the Chebar Canal , and then later at Jerusalem [ a ] when he came to destroy the city . And I fell down before him with my face in the dust .
TLB	Ezekiel	43	4	And the glory of the Lord came into the Temple through the eastern passageway .
TLB	Ezekiel	43	5	Then the Spirit took me up and brought me into the inner court ; and the glory of the Lord filled the Temple .
TLB	Ezekiel	43	6	And I heard the Lord speaking to me from within the Temple ( the man who had been measuring was still standing beside me ) .
TLB	Ezekiel	43	7	feet , and this is the top of the altar , with four horns projecting
TLB	Ezekiel	43	8	They built their idol temples beside mine , with only a wall between , and worshiped their idols . Because they sullied my holy name by such wickedness , I consumed them in my anger .
TLB	Ezekiel	43	9	Now let them put away their idols and the totem poles [ b ] erected by their kings , and I will live among them forever .
TLB	Ezekiel	43	10	“ Son of dust , describe the Temple I have shown you to the people of Israel . Tell them its appearance and its plan so they will be ashamed of all their sins .
TLB	Ezekiel	43	11	And if they are truly ashamed of what they have done , then explain to them the details of its construction—its doors and entrances—and everything about it . Write out all the directions and the rules for them to keep .
TLB	Ezekiel	43	12	And this is the basic law of the Temple : Holiness ! The entire top of the hill where the Temple is built is holy . Yes , this is the primary law concerning it .
TLB	Ezekiel	43	13	“ And these are the measurements of the altar : The base is
TLB	Ezekiel	43	21	Then take the bullock for the sin offering and burn it at the appointed place outside the Temple area .
TLB	Ezekiel	43	14	The first stage of the altar is a stone platform 3-1/2 feet high . This platform is
TLB	Ezekiel	43	15	From it a still narrower platform rises

TLB	Ezekiel	43	18	And he said to me : “ Son of dust , the Lord God says : These are the measurements of the altar to be made in the future , when it is erected for the burning of offerings and the sprinkling of blood upon it .
TLB	Ezekiel	43	19	At that time the Zadok family of the Levite tribe , who are my ministers , are to be given a bullock for a sin offering .
TLB	Ezekiel	43	20	You shall take some of its blood and smear it on the four horns of the altar and on the four corners of the top platform and in the curb around it . This will cleanse and make atonement for the altar .
TLB	Ezekiel	43	22	“ The second day , sacrifice a young male goat without any defects—without sickness , deformities , cuts , or scars—for a sin offering . Thus the altar shall be cleansed , as it was by the bullock .
TLB	Ezekiel	43	23	When you have finished this cleansing ceremony , offer another perfect bullock and a perfect ram from the flock .
TLB	Ezekiel	43	24	Present them before the Lord , and the priests shall sprinkle salt upon them as a burnt offering .
TLB	Ezekiel	43	25	“ Every day for seven days a male goat , a bullock , and a ram from the flock shall be sacrificed as a sin offering . None are to have any defects or unhealthiness of any kind .
TLB	Ezekiel	43	26	Do this each day for seven days to cleanse and make atonement for the altar , thus consecrating it .
TLB	Ezekiel	43	27	On the eighth day , and on each day afterward , the priests will sacrifice on the altar the burnt offerings and thank offerings of the people , and I will accept you , says the Lord God. ” Footnotes - Ezekiel 43:3 at Jerusalem , implied . - Ezekiel 43:9 totem poles , literally , “ stellae. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Ezekiel	44	44	Then the Lord brought me back to the outer wall ’ s eastern passageway , but it was closed .
TLB	Ezekiel	44	2	And he said to me : “ This gate shall remain closed ; it shall never be opened . No man shall pass through it ; for the Lord , the God of Israel , entered here , and so it shall remain shut .
TLB	Ezekiel	44	3	Only the prince—because he is the prince—may sit inside the passageway to feast there before the Lord . But he shall go and come only through the entry hall of the passage. ”
TLB	Ezekiel	44	4	Then he brought me through the north passageway to the front of the Temple . I looked and saw that the glory of the Lord filled the Temple of the Lord , and I fell to the ground with my face in the dust .
TLB	Ezekiel	44	5	And the Lord said to me : “ Son of dust , notice carefully ; use your eyes and ears . Listen to all I tell you about the laws and rules of the Temple of the Lord . Note carefully who may be admitted to the Temple and who is to be excluded from it .
TLB	Ezekiel	44	6	And say to these rebels , the people of Israel , ‘ The Lord God says : O Israel , you have sinned greatly
TLB	Ezekiel	44	7	by letting the uncircumcised into my sanctuary—those who have no heart for God—when you offer me my food , the fat and the blood . Thus you have broken my covenant in addition to all your other sins .
TLB	Ezekiel	44	8	You have not kept the laws I gave you concerning these holy affairs , for you have hired foreigners to take charge of my sanctuary. ’ ”
TLB	Ezekiel	44	9	The Lord God says : “ No foreigner of all the many among you shall enter my sanctuary if he has not been circumcised and does not love the Lord .
TLB	Ezekiel	44	10	And the men of the tribe of Levi who abandoned me when Israel strayed away from God to idols must be punished for their unfaithfulness .
TLB	Ezekiel	44	11	They may be Temple guards and gatemen ; they may slay the animals brought for burnt offerings and be present to help the people .
TLB	Ezekiel	44	12	But because they encouraged the people to worship other gods , causing Israel to fall into deep sin , I have raised my hand and taken oath , ” says the Lord God , “ that they must be punished .
TLB	Ezekiel	44	13	They shall not come near me to minister as priests ; they may not touch any of my holy things , for they must bear their shame for all the sins they have committed .
TLB	Ezekiel	44	14	They are the Temple caretakers , to do maintenance work and to assist the people in a general way .
TLB	Ezekiel	44	15	“ However , the sons of Zadok , of the tribe of Levi , continued as my priests in the Temple when Israel abandoned me for idols . These men shall be my ministers ; they shall stand before me to offer the fat and blood of the sacrifices , ” says the Lord God .
TLB	Ezekiel	44	16	“ They shall enter my sanctuary and come to my Table to minister to me ; they shall fulfill my requirements .
TLB	Ezekiel	44	17	“ They must wear only linen clothing when they enter the passageway to the inner court , for they must wear no wool while on duty in the inner court or in the Temple .
TLB	Ezekiel	44	18	They must wear linen turbans and linen trousers ; they must not wear anything that would cause them to perspire .
TLB	Ezekiel	44	19	When they return to the outer court , they must take off the clothes they wear while ministering to me , leaving them in the sacred chambers , and put on other clothes lest they harm the people by touching them with this clothing .
TLB	Ezekiel	44	20	“ They must not let their hair grow too long nor shave it off . Regular , moderate haircuts are all they are allowed .
TLB	Ezekiel	44	21	No priest may drink wine before coming to the inner court .
TLB	Ezekiel	44	22	He may marry only a Jewish maiden , or the widow of a priest ; he may not marry a divorced woman .
TLB	Ezekiel	44	23	“ He shall teach my people the difference between what is holy and what is secular , what is right and what is wrong . [ a ]
TLB	Ezekiel	44	24	“ They will serve as judges to resolve any disagreements among my people . Their decisions must be based upon my laws . And the priests themselves shall obey my rules and regulations at all the sacred festivals , and they shall see to it that the Sabbath is kept a sacred day .
TLB	Ezekiel	44	25	“ A priest must not defile himself by being in the presence of a dead person , unless it is his father , mother , child , brother , or unmarried sister . In such cases it is all right .
TLB	Ezekiel	44	26	But afterward he must wait seven days before he is cleansed and able to perform his Temple duties again .
TLB	Ezekiel	44	27	The first day he returns to work and enters the inner court and the sanctuary , he must offer a sin offering for himself , ” the Lord God says .
TLB	Ezekiel	44	28	“ As to property , they shall not own any , for I am their heritage ! That is enough ! [ b ]
TLB	Ezekiel	44	29	“ Their food shall be the gifts and sacrifices brought to the Temple by the people—the cereal offerings , the sin offerings , and the guilt offerings . Whatever anyone gives to the Lord shall be the priests ’ .
TLB	Ezekiel	44	30	The first of the first-ripe fruits and all the gifts for the Lord shall go to the priests . The first samples of each harvest of grain shall be donated to the priests too , so that the Lord will bless your homes .

TLB	Ezekiel	45	45	“ When you divide the land among the tribes of Israel , you shall first give a section of it to the Lord as his holy portion . This piece shall be 8-1/3 miles long and 6-2/3 miles wide . It shall all be holy ground .
TLB	Ezekiel	45	2	“ A section of this land ,
TLB	Ezekiel	45	875	feet square , shall be designated for the Temple . An additional 87-1/2-foot strip all around is to be left empty .
TLB	Ezekiel	45	3	The Temple shall be built within the area which is 8-1/3 miles long and 3-1/3 miles wide .
TLB	Ezekiel	45	4	All this section shall be holy land ; it will be used by the priests , who minister in the sanctuary , for their homes and for my Temple .
TLB	Ezekiel	45	5	“ The strip next to it , 8-1/3 miles long and 3-1/3 miles wide , shall be the residence area for the Levites who work at the Temple .
TLB	Ezekiel	45	6	Adjacent to the holy lands will be a section 8-1/3 miles by 1-2/3 miles for a city open to everyone in Israel .
TLB	Ezekiel	45	7	“ Two special sections of land shall be set apart for the prince—one on each side of the holy lands and city ; it is contiguous with them in length , and its eastern and western boundaries are the same as those of the tribal sections .
TLB	Ezekiel	45	8	This shall be his allotment . My princes shall no longer oppress and rob my people but shall assign all the remainder of the land to the people , giving a portion to each tribe. ”
TLB	Ezekiel	45	9	For the Sovereign Lord says to the rulers : “ Quit robbing and cheating my people out of their land and expelling them from their homes . Always be fair and honest .
TLB	Ezekiel	45	10	You must use honest scales , honest bushels , honest gallons .
TLB	Ezekiel	45	11	A homer ( about five bushels ) shall be your standard unit of measurement for both liquid and dry measure . Smaller units shall be the ephah ( about a half bushel ) for dry measure , and the bath ( about seventeen quarts ) for liquid .
TLB	Ezekiel	45	12	The unit of weight shall be the silver shekel ( about half an ounce ) ; it must always be exchanged for twenty gerahs , no less ; five shekels shall be valued at five shekels , no less ; and ten shekels at ten shekels ! Fifty shekels [ a ] shall always equal one mina .

TLB	Ezekiel	45	16	“ All the people of Israel shall bring their offerings to the prince .
TLB	Ezekiel	45	17	“ The prince shall be required to furnish the people with sacrifices for public worship—sin offerings , burnt offerings , meal offerings , drink offerings , and thank offerings—to make reconciliation for the people of Israel . This shall be done at the time of the religious feasts , the new moon ceremonies , the Sabbaths , and all other similar occasions. ”
TLB	Ezekiel	45	18	The Lord God says : “ On each New Year ’ s Day [ b ] sacrifice a young bull with no blemishes , to purify the Temple .
TLB	Ezekiel	45	19	The priest shall take some of the blood of this sin offering and put it on the doorposts of the Temple , upon the four corners of the base of the altar , and upon the walls at the entry of the inner court .
TLB	Ezekiel	45	20	Do this also on the seventh day of that month for anyone who has sinned through error or ignorance , and so the Temple will be cleansed .
TLB	Ezekiel	45	21	“ On the fourteenth day of the same month , you shall celebrate the Passover . It will be a seven-day feast . Only bread without yeast shall be eaten during those days .
TLB	Ezekiel	45	22	On the day of Passover the prince shall provide a young bull for a sin offering for himself and all the people of Israel .
TLB	Ezekiel	45	23	On each of the seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to the Lord . This daily offering will consist of seven young bulls and seven rams without blemish . A male goat shall also be given each day for a sin offering .

TLB	Ezekiel	46	46	The Lord God says : “ The inner wall ’ s eastern entrance shall be closed during the six work days but open on the Sabbath and on the days of the new moon celebrations .
TLB	Ezekiel	46	2	The prince shall enter the outside entry hall of the passageway and proceed to the inner wall at the other end while the priest offers his burnt offering and peace offering . He shall worship inside the passageway and then return back to the entrance , which shall not be closed until evening .
TLB	Ezekiel	46	3	The people shall worship the Lord in front of this passageway on the Sabbaths and on the days of the new moon celebrations .
TLB	Ezekiel	46	4	“ The burnt offering that the prince sacrifices to the Lord on the Sabbath days shall be six lambs and a ram , all unblemished .
TLB	Ezekiel	46	5	He shall present a meal offering of a half bushel of flour to go with the ram and whatever amount he is willing to give with each lamb . And he shall bring three quarts of olive oil for each half bushel of flour .
TLB	Ezekiel	46	6	At the new moon celebration , he shall bring one young bull in perfect condition , six lambs , and one ram , all without any blemish .
TLB	Ezekiel	46	7	With the young bull , he must bring a half bushel [ a ] of flour for a meal offering . With the ram he must bring a half bushel of flour . With the lamb he is to bring whatever he is willing to give . With each half bushel of grain he is to bring three quarts of olive oil .
TLB	Ezekiel	46	8	“ The prince shall go in at the entry hall of the passageway and out the same way ;
TLB	Ezekiel	46	9	but when the people come in through the north passageway to sacrifice during the religious feasts , they must go out through the south passageway . Those coming in from the south must go out by the north . They must never go out the same way they come in , but must always use the opposite passageway .
TLB	Ezekiel	46	10	The prince shall enter and leave with the common people on these occasions .
TLB	Ezekiel	46	11	“ To summarize : At the special feasts and sacred festivals the meal offering shall be a half bushel with the young bull ; a half bushel with the ram ; as much as the prince is willing to give with each lamb ; and three quarts of oil with each half bushel of grain .
TLB	Ezekiel	46	12	Whenever the prince offers an extra burnt offering or peace offering to be sacrificed to the Lord , the inner eastern gate shall be opened up for him to enter , and he shall offer his sacrifices just as on the Sabbaths . Then he shall turn around and go out , and the passage shall be shut behind him .
TLB	Ezekiel	46	13	“ Each morning a yearling lamb must be sacrificed as a burnt offering to the Lord . 14-15 And there must be a meal offering each morning—five pounds of flour with one quart of oil with which to mix it . This is a permanent ordinance—the lamb , the grain offering , and the olive oil shall be provided every morning for the daily sacrifice. ”
TLB	Ezekiel	46	16	The Sovereign Lord says : “ If the prince gives a gift of land to one of his sons , it will belong to him forever .
TLB	Ezekiel	46	17	But if he gives a gift of land to one of his servants , the servant may keep it only until the Year of Release ( every seventh year ) when he is set free ; then the land returns to the prince . Only gifts to his sons are permanent .
TLB	Ezekiel	46	18	And the prince may never take anyone ’ s property by force . If he gives property to his sons , it must be from his own land , for I don ’ t want my people losing their property and having to move away. ” 19-20 After that , using the door through the wall at the side of the main passageway , he led me through the entrance to the block of sacred chambers that faced north . There , at the extreme west end of these rooms , I saw a place where , my guide told me , the priests boil the meat of the trespass offering and sin offering and bake the flour of the flour offerings into bread . They do it here to avoid the necessity of carrying the sacrifices through the outer court , in case they harm the people . 21-22 Then he brought me out to the outer court again and led me to each of the four corners of the court . I saw that in each corner there was a room
TLB	Ezekiel	46	70	feet long by 52-1/2 feet wide , enclosed by walls .
TLB	Ezekiel	46	23	Around the inside of these walls there ran a line of brick boiling vats with ovens underneath .

TLB	Ezekiel	47	47	Then he brought me back to the door of the Temple . I saw a stream flowing eastward from beneath the Temple and passing to the right of the altar , that is , on its south side .
TLB	Ezekiel	47	2	Then he brought me outside the wall through the north passageway [ a ] and around to the eastern entrance , where I saw the stream flowing along on the south side of the eastern passageway .
TLB	Ezekiel	47	3	Measuring as he went , he took me 1,500 feet east along the stream and told me to go across . At that point the water was up to my ankles .
TLB	Ezekiel	47	4	He measured off another 1,500 feet and told me to cross again . This time the water was up to my knees .
TLB	Ezekiel	47	5	Fifteen hundred feet after that it was up to my waist . Another 1,500 feet and it had become a river so deep I wouldn ’ t be able to get across unless I were to swim . It was too deep to cross on foot .
TLB	Ezekiel	47	6	He told me to keep in mind what I had seen , then led me back along the bank .
TLB	Ezekiel	47	7	And now , to my surprise , [ b ] many trees were growing on both sides of the river !
TLB	Ezekiel	47	8	He told me : “ This river flows east through the desert and the Jordan Valley to the Dead Sea , where it will heal the salty waters and make them fresh and pure .
TLB	Ezekiel	47	9	Everything touching the water of this river shall live . Fish will abound in the Dead Sea , for its waters will be healed . Wherever this water flows , everything will live .
TLB	Ezekiel	47	10	Fishermen will stand along the shores of the Dead Sea , fishing all the way from En-gedi to En-eglaim . The shores will be filled with nets drying in the sun . Fish of every kind will fill the Dead Sea just as they do the Mediterranean !
TLB	Ezekiel	47	11	But the marshes and swamps will not be healed ; they will still be salty .
TLB	Ezekiel	47	12	All kinds of fruit trees will grow along the riverbanks . The leaves will never turn brown and fall , and there will always be fruit . There will be a new crop every month—without fail ! For they are watered by the river flowing from the Temple . The fruit will be for food and the leaves for medicine. ”
TLB	Ezekiel	47	13	The Lord God says : “ Here are the instructions for dividing the land to the twelve tribes of Israel : The tribe of Joseph ( Ephraim and Manasseh ) [ c ] shall be given two sections .
TLB	Ezekiel	47	14	Otherwise , each tribe will have an equal share . I promised with hand raised in oath of truth to give the land to your fathers , and you shall inherit it now .
TLB	Ezekiel	47	15	“ The northern boundary will run from the Mediterranean toward Hethlon , then on through Labweh [ d ] to Zedad ;
TLB	Ezekiel	47	16	then to Berothah and Sibraim , which are on the border between Damascus and Hamath , and finally to Hazer-hatticon , on the border of Hauran .
TLB	Ezekiel	47	17	So the northern border will be from the Mediterranean to Hazar-enan , on the border with Hamath to the north and Damascus to the south .
TLB	Ezekiel	47	18	“ The eastern border will run south from Hazar-enan to Mount Hauran , where it will bend westward to the Jordan at the southern tip of the Sea of Galilee , and down along the Jordan River separating Israel from Gilead , past the Dead Sea to Tamar .
TLB	Ezekiel	47	19	“ The southern border will go west from Tamar to the springs at Meribath-kadesh and then follow the course of the brook of Egypt ( Wadi el-Arish ) to the Mediterranean .
TLB	Ezekiel	47	20	“ On the west side , the Mediterranean itself will be your boundary , from the southern boundary to the point where the northern boundary begins .
TLB	Ezekiel	47	21	“ Divide the land within these boundaries among the tribes of Israel .
TLB	Ezekiel	47	22	Distribute the land as an inheritance for yourselves and for the foreigners who live among you with their families . All children born in the land—whether or not their parents are foreigners—are to be considered citizens and have the same rights your own children have .

TLB	Ezekiel	48	12	It is their special portion when the land is distributed , the most sacred land of all . Next to it lies the area where the other Levites will live .
TLB	Ezekiel	48	13	It will be of the same size and shape as the first . Together they measure 8-1/3 miles by 6-2/3 miles .
TLB	Ezekiel	48	14	None of this special land shall ever be sold or traded or used by others , for it belongs to the Lord ; it is holy .
TLB	Ezekiel	48	15	“ The strip of land 8-1/3 miles long by 1-2/3 miles wide , south of the Temple section , is for public use—homes , pasture , and parks , with a city in the center .

This land , lying between the sections allotted to Judah and Benjamin , is 8-1/3 miles square on each side of the sacred and city lands .
TLB	Ezekiel	48	23	“ The sections given to the remaining tribes are as follows : Benjamin ’ s section extends across the entire country of Israel , from its eastern border clear across to the western border .
TLB	Ezekiel	48	24	South of Benjamin ’ s area lies that of Simeon , also extending out to these same eastern and western borders .

TLB	Daniel	1	1	1-2 Three years after King Jehoiakim began to rule in Judah , Babylon ’ s King Nebuchadnezzar attacked Jerusalem with his armies , and the Lord gave him victory over Jehoiakim . When he returned to Babylon , he took along some of the sacred cups from the Temple of God and placed them in the treasury of his god in the land of Shinar . 3-4 Then he ordered Ashpenaz , who was in charge of his palace personnel , [ a ] to select some of the Jewish youths brought back as captives—young men of the royal family and nobility of Judah—and to teach them the Chaldean language and literature . “ Pick strong , healthy , good-looking lads , ” he said ; “ those who have read widely in many fields , are well informed , alert and sensible , and have enough poise to look good around the palace. ”
TLB	Daniel	1	5	The king assigned them the best of food and wine from his own kitchen during their three-year training period , planning to make them his counselors when they graduated .
TLB	Daniel	1	6	Daniel , Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah were four of the young men chosen , all from the tribe of Judah .

TLB	Daniel	1	13	then , at the end of this trial period the steward could see how they looked in comparison with the other fellows who ate the king ’ s rich food and decide whether or not to let them continue their diet .
TLB	Daniel	1	14	The steward finally agreed to the test .
TLB	Daniel	1	15	Well , at the end of the ten days , Daniel and his three friends looked healthier and better nourished than the youths who had been eating the food supplied by the king !
TLB	Daniel	1	16	So after that the steward fed them only vegetables and water , without the rich foods and wines !
TLB	Daniel	1	17	God gave these four youths great ability to learn , and they soon mastered all the literature and science of the time ; and God gave to Daniel special ability in understanding the meanings of dreams and visions . 18-19 When the three-year training period was completed , the superintendent brought all the young men to the king for oral exams , as he had been ordered to do . King Nebuchadnezzar had long talks with each of them , and none of them impressed him as much as Daniel , Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah . So they were put on his regular staff of advisors .
TLB	Daniel	1	20	And in all matters requiring information and balanced judgment , the king found these young men ’ s advice ten times better than that of all the skilled magicians and wise astrologers in his realm .

TLB	Daniel	2	2	1-3 One night in the second year of his reign , Nebuchadnezzar had a terrifying nightmare and awoke trembling with fear . And to make matters worse , he couldn ’ t remember his dream ! He immediately called in all his magicians , incantationists , sorcerers , and astrologers , and demanded that they tell him what his dream had been . “ I ’ ve had a terrible nightmare , ” he said as they stood before him , “ and I can ’ t remember what it was . Tell me , for I fear some tragedy awaits me. ”
TLB	Daniel	2	4	Then the astrologers ( speaking in Aramaic ) said to the king , “ Sir , tell us the dream and then we can tell you what it means. ”
TLB	Daniel	2	5	But the king replied , “ I tell you the dream is gone—I can ’ t remember it . And if you won ’ t tell me what it was and what it means , I ’ ll have you torn limb from limb and your houses made into heaps of rubble !
TLB	Daniel	2	6	But I will give you many wonderful gifts and honors if you tell me what the dream was and what it means . So , begin ! ”
TLB	Daniel	2	7	They said again , “ How can we tell you what the dream means unless you tell us what it was ? ” 8-9 The king retorted , “ I can see your trick ! You ’ re trying to stall for time until the calamity befalls me that the dream foretells . But if you don ’ t tell me the dream , you certainly can ’ t expect me to believe your interpretation ! ”
TLB	Daniel	2	10	The astrologers replied to the king , “ There isn ’ t a man alive who can tell others what they have dreamed ! And there isn ’ t a king in all the world who would ask such a thing !
TLB	Daniel	2	11	This is an impossible thing the king requires . No one except the gods can tell you your dream , and they are not here to help. ”
TLB	Daniel	2	12	Upon hearing this , the king was furious and sent out orders to execute all the wise men of Babylon .
TLB	Daniel	2	13	And Daniel and his companions were rounded up with the others to be killed .
TLB	Daniel	2	14	But when Arioch , the chief executioner , came to kill them , Daniel handled the situation with great wisdom by asking ,
TLB	Daniel	2	15	“ Why is the king so angry ? What is the matter ? ” Then Arioch told him all that had happened .
TLB	Daniel	2	16	So Daniel went in to see the king . “ Give me a little time , ” he said , “ and I will tell you the dream and what it means. ”
TLB	Daniel	2	17	Then he went home and told Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah , his companions .
TLB	Daniel	2	18	They asked the God of heaven to show them his mercy by telling them the secret , so they would not die with the others .
TLB	Daniel	2	19	And that night in a vision God told Daniel what the king had dreamed . Then Daniel praised the God of heaven ,
TLB	Daniel	2	20	saying , “ Blessed be the name of God forever and ever , for he alone has all wisdom and all power .
TLB	Daniel	2	21	World events are under his control . He removes kings and sets others on their thrones . He gives wise men their wisdom and scholars their intelligence .
TLB	Daniel	2	22	He reveals profound mysteries beyond man ’ s understanding . He knows all hidden things , for he is light , and darkness is no obstacle to him .
TLB	Daniel	2	23	I thank and praise you , O God of my fathers , for you have given me wisdom and glowing health , and now even this vision of the king ’ s dream and the understanding of what it means. ”
TLB	Daniel	2	24	Then Daniel went in to see Arioch , who had been ordered to execute the wise men of Babylon , and said , “ Don ’ t kill them . Take me to the king , and I will tell him what he wants to know. ”
TLB	Daniel	2	25	Then Arioch hurried Daniel in to the king and said , “ I ’ ve found one of the Jewish captives who will tell you your dream ! ”
TLB	Daniel	2	26	The king said to Daniel , “ Is this true ? Can you tell me what my dream was and what it means ? ”
TLB	Daniel	2	27	Daniel replied , “ No wise man , astrologer , magician , or wizard can tell the king such things ,
TLB	Daniel	2	28	but there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets , and he has told you in your dream what will happen in the future . This was your dream :
TLB	Daniel	2	29	“ You dreamed of coming events . He who reveals secrets was speaking to you .
TLB	Daniel	2	30	( But remember , it ’ s not because I am wiser than any living person that I know this secret of your dream , for God showed it to me for your benefit . )
TLB	Daniel	2	31	“ O king , you saw a huge and powerful statue of a man , shining brilliantly , frightening and terrible .
TLB	Daniel	2	32	The head of the statue was made of purest gold , its chest and arms were of silver , its belly and thighs of brass ,
TLB	Daniel	2	33	its legs of iron , its feet part iron and part clay .
TLB	Daniel	2	34	But as you watched , a Rock was cut from the mountainside [ a ] by supernatural means . It came hurtling toward the statue and crushed the feet of iron and clay , smashing them to bits .
TLB	Daniel	2	35	Then the whole statue collapsed into a heap of iron , clay , brass , silver , and gold ; its pieces were crushed as small as chaff , and the wind blew them all away . But the Rock that knocked the statue down became a great mountain that covered the whole earth .
TLB	Daniel	2	36	“ That was the dream ; now for its meaning :
TLB	Daniel	2	37	“ Your Majesty , you are a king over many kings , for the God of heaven has given you your kingdom , power , strength , and glory .
TLB	Daniel	2	38	You rule the farthest provinces , and even animals and birds are under your control , as God decreed . You are that head of gold .
TLB	Daniel	2	39	“ But after your kingdom has come to an end , another world power [ b ] will arise to take your place . This empire will be inferior to yours . And after that kingdom has fallen , yet a third great power—represented by the bronze belly of the statue—will rise to rule the world .
TLB	Daniel	2	40	Following it , the fourth kingdom [ c ] will be strong as iron—smashing , bruising , and conquering . 41-42 The feet and toes you saw—part iron and part clay—show that later on , this kingdom will be divided . Some parts of it will be as strong as iron , and some as weak as clay .
TLB	Daniel	2	43	This mixture of iron with clay also shows that these kingdoms will try to strengthen themselves by forming alliances with each other through intermarriage of their rulers ; but this will not succeed , for iron and clay don ’ t mix .
TLB	Daniel	2	44	“ During the reigns of those kings , the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed ; no one will ever conquer it . It will shatter all these kingdoms into nothingness , but it shall stand forever , indestructible .
TLB	Daniel	2	45	That is the meaning of the Rock cut from the mountain without human hands—the Rock that crushed to powder all the iron and brass , the clay , the silver , and the gold . “ Thus the great God has shown what will happen in the future , and this interpretation of your dream is as sure and certain as my description of it. ”
TLB	Daniel	2	46	Then Nebuchadnezzar fell to the ground before Daniel and worshiped him and commanded his people to offer sacrifices and burn sweet incense before him .
TLB	Daniel	2	47	“ Truly , O Daniel , ” the king said , “ your God is the God of gods , Ruler of kings , the Revealer of mysteries , because he has told you this secret. ”
TLB	Daniel	2	48	Then the king made Daniel very great ; he gave him many valuable gifts and appointed him to be ruler over the whole province of Babylon , as well as chief over all his wise men .
TLB	Daniel	2	49	Then , at Daniel ’ s request , the king appointed Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego as Daniel ’ s assistants , to be in charge of all the affairs of the province of Babylon ; Daniel served as chief magistrate in the king ’ s court .

TLB	Daniel	3	3	When they had all arrived and were standing before the monument ,
TLB	Daniel	3	2	then he sent messages to all the princes , governors , captains , judges , treasurers , counselors , sheriffs , and rulers of all the provinces of his empire , to come to the dedication of his statue .
TLB	Daniel	3	4	a herald shouted out , “ O people of all nations and languages , this is the king ’ s command :
TLB	Daniel	3	5	“ When the band [ a ] strikes up , you are to fall flat on the ground to worship King Nebuchadnezzar ’ s gold statue ;
TLB	Daniel	3	6	anyone who refuses to obey will immediately be thrown into a flaming furnace. ”
TLB	Daniel	3	7	and
TLB	Daniel	3	8	But some officials went to the king and accused some of the Jews of refusing to worship !
TLB	Daniel	3	9	“ Your Majesty , ” they said to him ,
TLB	Daniel	3	10	. - Daniel 3:7 whatever his nation , language , or religion , implied . - Daniel 3:25 looks like a god , literally , “ looks like a son of the gods. ” - Daniel 3:29 of any nation , language , or religion , implied . The Living Bible copyright ©
TLB	Daniel	3	11	and that anyone who refuses will be thrown into a flaming furnace .
TLB	Daniel	3	12	But there are some Jews out there—Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego , whom you have put in charge of Babylonian affairs—who have defied you , refusing to serve your gods or to worship the gold statue you set up. ”
TLB	Daniel	3	13	Then Nebuchadnezzar , in a terrible rage , ordered Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego to be brought in before him .
TLB	Daniel	3	14	“ Is it true , O Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego , ” he demanded , “ that you are refusing to serve my gods or to worship the gold statue I set up ?
TLB	Daniel	3	15	I ’ ll give you one more chance . When the music plays , if you fall down and worship the statue , all will be well . But if you refuse , you will be thrown into a flaming furnace within the hour . And what god can deliver you out of my hands then ? ”
TLB	Daniel	3	16	Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego replied , “ O Nebuchadnezzar , we are not worried about what will happen to us .
TLB	Daniel	3	17	If we are thrown into the flaming furnace , our God is able to deliver us ; and he will deliver us out of your hand , Your Majesty .
TLB	Daniel	3	18	But if he doesn ’ t , please understand , sir , that even then we will never under any circumstance serve your gods or worship the gold statue you have erected. ”
TLB	Daniel	3	19	Then Nebuchadnezzar was filled with fury and his face became dark with anger at Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego . He commanded that the furnace be heated up seven times hotter than usual ,
TLB	Daniel	3	20	and called for some of the strongest men of his army to bind Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego , and throw them into the fire .
TLB	Daniel	3	21	So they bound them tight with ropes and threw them into the furnace , fully clothed .
TLB	Daniel	3	22	And because the king , in his anger , had demanded such a hot fire in the furnace , the flames leaped out and killed the soldiers as they threw them in !
TLB	Daniel	3	23	So Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego fell down bound into the roaring flames .
TLB	Daniel	3	24	But suddenly , as he was watching , Nebuchadnezzar jumped up in amazement and exclaimed to his advisors , “ Didn ’ t we throw three men into the furnace ? ” “ Yes , ” they said , “ we did indeed , Your Majesty. ”
TLB	Daniel	3	25	“ Well , look ! ” Nebuchadnezzar shouted . “ I see four men , unbound , walking around in the fire , and they aren ’ t even hurt by the flames ! And the fourth looks like a god ! ” [ c ]
TLB	Daniel	3	26	Then Nebuchadnezzar came as close as he could to the open door of the flaming furnace and yelled : “ Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego , servants of the Most High God ! Come out ! Come here ! ” So they stepped out of the fire .
TLB	Daniel	3	27	Then the princes , governors , captains , and counselors crowded around them and saw that the fire hadn ’ t touched them—not a hair of their heads was singed ; their coats were unscorched , and they didn ’ t even smell of smoke !
TLB	Daniel	3	28	Then Nebuchadnezzar said , “ Blessed be the God of Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego , for he sent his angel to deliver his trusting servants when they defied the king ’ s commandment and were willing to die rather than serve or worship any god except their own .
TLB	Daniel	3	29	Therefore , I make this decree , that any person of any nation , language , or religion [ d ] who speaks a word against the God of Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego shall be torn limb from limb and his house knocked into a heap of rubble . For no other God can do what this one does. ”
TLB	Daniel	3	30	Then the king gave promotions to Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego , so that they prospered greatly there in the province of Babylon .

TLB	Daniel	4	4	I , Nebuchadnezzar , was living in peace and prosperity ,
TLB	Daniel	4	2	I want you all to know about the strange thing that the Most High God did to me .
TLB	Daniel	4	3	It was incredible—a mighty miracle ! And now I know for sure that his kingdom is everlasting ; he reigns forever and ever .
TLB	Daniel	4	5	when one night I had a dream that greatly frightened me .
TLB	Daniel	4	6	I called in all the wise men of Babylon to tell me the meaning of my dream ,
TLB	Daniel	4	7	but when they came—the magicians , astrologers , fortune-tellers , and wizards—and I told them the dream , they couldn ’ t interpret it .
TLB	Daniel	4	8	At last Daniel came in—the man I named Belteshazzar after my god—the man in whom is the spirit of the holy gods , and I told him the dream .
TLB	Daniel	4	9	“ O Belteshazzar , master magician , ” I said , “ I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you and no mystery is too great for you to solve . Tell me what my dream means : 10-11 “ I saw a very tall tree out in a field , growing higher and higher into the sky until it could be seen by everyone in all the world .
TLB	Daniel	4	12	Its leaves were fresh and green , and its branches were weighted down with fruit , enough for everyone to eat . Wild animals rested beneath its shade and birds sheltered in its branches , and all the world was fed from it .
TLB	Daniel	4	13	Then as I lay there dreaming , I saw one of God ’ s angels [ a ] coming down from heaven .
TLB	Daniel	4	14	“ He shouted , ‘ Cut down the tree ; lop off its branches ; shake off its leaves , and scatter its fruit . Get the animals out from under it and the birds from its branches ,
TLB	Daniel	4	15	but leave its stump and roots in the ground , banded with a chain of iron and brass , surrounded by the tender grass . Let the dew of heaven drench him and let him eat grass with the wild animals !
TLB	Daniel	4	16	For seven years let him have the mind of an animal instead of a man .
TLB	Daniel	4	17	For this has been decreed by the Watchers , demanded by the Holy Ones . The purpose of this decree is that all the world may understand that the Most High dominates the kingdoms of the world and gives them to anyone he wants to , even the lowliest of men ! ’
TLB	Daniel	4	18	“ O Belteshazzar , that was my dream ; now tell me what it means . For no one else can help me ; all the wisest men of my kingdom have failed me . But you can tell me , for the spirit of the holy gods is in you. ”
TLB	Daniel	4	19	Then Daniel [ b ] sat there stunned and silent for an hour , aghast at the meaning of the dream . Finally the king said to him : “ Belteshazzar , don ’ t be afraid to tell me what it means. ” Daniel replied : “ Oh , that the events foreshadowed in this dream would happen to your enemies , my lord , and not to you !
TLB	Daniel	4	20	For the tree you saw growing so tall , reaching high into the heavens for all the world to see ,
TLB	Daniel	4	21	with its fresh green leaves , loaded with fruit for all to eat , the wild animals living in its shade , with its branches full of birds—
TLB	Daniel	4	22	that tree , Your Majesty , is you . For you have grown strong and great ; your greatness reaches up to heaven , and your rule to the ends of the earth .
TLB	Daniel	4	23	“ Then you saw God ’ s angel [ c ] coming down from heaven and saying , ‘ Cut down the tree and destroy it , but leave the stump and the roots in the earth surrounded by tender grass , banded with a chain of iron and brass . Let him be wet with the dew of heaven . For seven years let him eat grass with the animals of the field. ’
TLB	Daniel	4	24	“ Your Majesty , the Most High God has decreed—and it will surely happen—
TLB	Daniel	4	25	that your people will chase you from your palace , and you will live in the fields like an animal , eating grass like a cow , your back wet with dew from heaven . For seven years this will be your life , until you learn that the Most High God dominates the kingdoms of men and gives power to anyone he chooses .
TLB	Daniel	4	26	But the stump and the roots were left in the ground ! This means that you will get your kingdom back again when you have learned that heaven rules .
TLB	Daniel	4	27	“ O King Nebuchadnezzar , listen to me—stop sinning ; do what you know is right ; be merciful to the poor . Perhaps even yet God will spare you. ”
TLB	Daniel	4	28	But all these things happened to Nebuchadnezzar .
TLB	Daniel	4	29	Twelve months after this dream , he was strolling on the roof of the royal palace in Babylon ,
TLB	Daniel	4	30	and saying , “ I , by my own mighty power , have built this beautiful city as my royal residence and as the capital of my empire. ”
TLB	Daniel	4	31	While he was still speaking these words , a voice called down from heaven , “ O King Nebuchadnezzar , this message is for you : You are no longer ruler of this kingdom .
TLB	Daniel	4	32	You will be forced out of the palace to live with the animals in the fields and to eat grass like the cows for seven years , until you finally realize that God parcels out the kingdoms of men and gives them to anyone he chooses. ”
TLB	Daniel	4	33	That very same hour this prophecy was fulfilled . Nebuchadnezzar was chased from his palace and ate grass like the cows , and his body was wet with dew ; his hair grew as long as eagles ’ feathers , and his nails were like birds ’ claws .
TLB	Daniel	4	34	“ At the end of seven years [ d ] I , Nebuchadnezzar , looked up to heaven , and my sanity returned , and I praised and worshiped the Most High God and honored him who lives forever , whose rule is everlasting , his kingdom evermore .
TLB	Daniel	4	35	All the people of the earth are nothing when compared to him ; he does whatever he thinks best among the angels of heaven , as well as here on earth . No one can stop him or challenge him , saying , ‘ What do you mean by doing these things ? ’
TLB	Daniel	4	36	When my mind returned to me , so did my honor and glory and kingdom . My counselors and officers came back to me , and I was reestablished as head of my kingdom , with even greater honor than before .
TLB	Daniel	4	37	“ Now , I , Nebuchadnezzar , praise and glorify and honor the King of Heaven , the Judge of all , whose every act is right and good ; for he is able to take those who walk proudly and push them into the dust ! ” Footnotes - Daniel 4:13 one of God ’ s angels , literally , “ a watcher , a holy one. ” - Daniel 4:19 Then Daniel , literally , “ Daniel , whose name was Belteshazzar. ” - Daniel 4:23 God ’ s angel , literally , “ a holy watcher. ” - Daniel 4:34 At the end of seven years , literally , “ At the end of the days. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Daniel	5	5	Suddenly , as they were drinking from these cups , they saw the fingers of a man ’ s hand writing on the plaster of the wall opposite the lampstand . The king himself saw the fingers as they wrote .
TLB	Daniel	5	6	His face blanched with fear , and such terror gripped him that his knees knocked together and his legs gave way beneath him .
TLB	Daniel	5	7	“ Bring the magicians and astrologers ! ” he screamed . “ Bring the Chaldeans ! Whoever reads that writing on the wall and tells me what it means will be dressed in purple robes of royal honor , with a gold chain around his neck , and he will become the third ruler in the kingdom ! ” [ a ]
TLB	Daniel	5	8	But when they came , none of them could understand the writing or tell him what it meant .
TLB	Daniel	5	9	The king grew more and more hysterical ; his face reflected the terror he felt , and his officers too were shaken .
TLB	Daniel	5	10	But when the queen mother heard what was happening , she rushed to the banquet hall and said to Belshazzar , “ Calm yourself , Your Majesty , don ’ t be so pale and frightened over this .
TLB	Daniel	5	11	For there is a man in your kingdom who has within him the spirit of the holy gods . In the days of your father this man was found to be as full of wisdom and understanding as though he were himself a god . And in the reign of King Nebuchadnezzar , [ b ] he was made chief of all the magicians , astrologers , Chaldeans , and soothsayers of Babylon .
TLB	Daniel	5	12	Call for this man , Daniel—or Belteshazzar , as the king called him—for his mind is filled with divine knowledge and understanding . He can interpret dreams , explain riddles , and solve knotty problems . He will tell you what the writing means. ”
TLB	Daniel	5	13	So Daniel was rushed in to see the king . The king asked him , “ Are you the Daniel brought from Israel as a captive by King Nebuchadnezzar ?
TLB	Daniel	5	14	I have heard that you have the spirit of the gods within you and that you are filled with enlightenment and wisdom .
TLB	Daniel	5	15	My wise men and astrologers have tried to read that writing on the wall and tell me what it means , but they can ’ t .
TLB	Daniel	5	16	I am told you can solve all kinds of mysteries . If you can tell me the meaning of those words , I will clothe you in purple robes , with a gold chain around your neck , and make you the third ruler in the kingdom. ”
TLB	Daniel	5	17	Daniel answered , “ Keep your gifts or give them to someone else , but I will tell you what the writing means .
TLB	Daniel	5	18	Your Majesty , the Most High God gave Nebuchadnezzar , who long ago preceded you , a kingdom and majesty and glory and honor .
TLB	Daniel	5	19	He gave him such majesty that all the nations of the world trembled before him in fear . He killed any who offended him and spared any he liked . At his whim they rose or fell .
TLB	Daniel	5	20	But when his heart and mind were hardened in pride , God removed him from his royal throne and took away his glory .
TLB	Daniel	5	21	He was chased out of his palace into the fields . His thoughts and feelings became those of an animal , and he lived among the wild donkeys ; he ate grass like the cows , and his body was wet with the dew of heaven , until at last he knew that the Most High overrules the kingdoms of men and appoints anyone he desires to reign over them .
TLB	Daniel	5	22	“ And you , his successor , O Belshazzar—you knew all this , yet you have not been humble .
TLB	Daniel	5	23	For you have defied the Lord of Heaven and brought here these cups from his Temple ; and you and your officers and wives and concubines have been drinking wine from them while praising gods of silver , gold , brass , iron , wood , and stone—gods that neither see nor hear nor know anything at all . But you have not praised the God who gives you the breath of life and controls your destiny ! 24-25 And so God sent those fingers to write this message : ‘ Mene , ’ ‘ Mene , ’ ‘ Tekel , ’ ‘ Parsin. ’
TLB	Daniel	5	26	“ This is what it means : “ Mene means ‘ numbered ’ —God has numbered the days of your reign , and they are ended .
TLB	Daniel	5	27	“ Tekel means ‘ weighed ’ —you have been weighed in God ’ s balances and have failed the test .
TLB	Daniel	5	28	“ Parsin means ‘ divided ’ —your kingdom will be divided and given to the Medes and Persians. ”
TLB	Daniel	5	29	Then at Belshazzar ’ s command , Daniel was robed in purple , a gold chain was hung around his neck , and he was proclaimed third ruler in the kingdom .
TLB	Daniel	5	30	That very night Belshazzar , the Chaldean king , was killed ,
TLB	Daniel	5	31	and Darius the Mede [ c ] entered the city and began reigning at the age of sixty-two . Footnotes - Daniel 5:7 become the third ruler in the kingdom .

TLB	Daniel	6	6	They decided to go to the king and say , “ King Darius , live forever !
TLB	Daniel	6	120	provinces , each under a governor .
TLB	Daniel	6	2	The governors were accountable to three presidents ( Daniel was one of them ) so the king could administer the kingdom efficiently .
TLB	Daniel	6	3	Daniel soon proved himself more capable than all the other presidents and governors , for he had great ability , and the king began to think of placing him over the entire empire as his administrative officer .
TLB	Daniel	6	4	This made the other presidents and governors very jealous , and they began searching for some fault in the way Daniel was handling his affairs so that they could complain to the king about him . But they couldn ’ t find anything to criticize ! He was faithful and honest and made no mistakes .
TLB	Daniel	6	5	So they concluded , “ Our only chance is his religion ! ”
TLB	Daniel	6	7	We presidents , governors , counselors , and deputies have unanimously decided that you should make a law , irrevocable under any circumstance , that for the next thirty days anyone who asks a favor of God or man—except from you , Your Majesty—shall be thrown to the lions .
TLB	Daniel	6	8	Your Majesty , we request your signature on this law ; sign it so that it can not be canceled or changed ; it will be a ‘ law of the Medes and Persians ’ that can not be revoked. ”
TLB	Daniel	6	9	So King Darius signed the law .
TLB	Daniel	6	10	But though Daniel knew about it , he went home and knelt down as usual in his upstairs bedroom , with its windows open toward Jerusalem , and prayed three times a day , just as he always had , giving thanks to his God .
TLB	Daniel	6	11	Then the men thronged to Daniel ’ s house and found him praying there , asking favors of his God .
TLB	Daniel	6	12	They rushed back to the king and reminded him about his law . “ Haven ’ t you signed a decree , ” they demanded , “ that permits no petitions to any God or man—except you—for thirty days ? And anyone disobeying will be thrown to the lions ? ” “ Yes , ” the king replied , “ it is ‘ a law of the Medes and Persians , ’ that can not be altered or revoked. ”
TLB	Daniel	6	13	Then they told the king , “ That fellow Daniel , one of the Jewish captives , is paying no attention to you or your law . He is asking favors of his God three times a day. ”
TLB	Daniel	6	14	Hearing this , the king was very angry with himself for signing the law and determined to save Daniel . He spent the rest of the day trying to think of some way to get Daniel out of this predicament .
TLB	Daniel	6	15	In the evening the men came again to the king and said , “ Your Majesty , there is nothing you can do . You signed the law , and it can not be changed. ”
TLB	Daniel	6	16	So at last the king gave the order for Daniel ’ s arrest , and he was taken to the den of lions . The king said to him , “ May your God , whom you worship continually , deliver you. ” And then they threw him in .
TLB	Daniel	6	17	A stone was brought and placed over the mouth of the den ; and the king sealed it with his own signet ring and with that of his government , so that no one could rescue Daniel from the lions .
TLB	Daniel	6	18	Then the king returned to his palace and went to bed without dinner . He refused his usual entertainment and didn ’ t sleep all night .
TLB	Daniel	6	19	Very early the next morning he hurried out to the lions ’ den
TLB	Daniel	6	20	and called out in anguish , “ O Daniel , servant of the Living God , was your God , whom you worship continually , able to deliver you from the lions ? ”
TLB	Daniel	6	21	Then he heard a voice ! “ Your Majesty , live forever ! ” It was Daniel !
TLB	Daniel	6	22	“ My God has sent his angel , ” he said , “ to shut the lions ’ mouths so that they can ’ t touch me , for I am innocent before God ; nor , sir , have I wronged you. ”
TLB	Daniel	6	23	The king was beside himself with joy and ordered Daniel lifted from the den . And not a scratch was found on him because he believed in his God .
TLB	Daniel	6	24	Then the king issued a command to bring the men who had accused Daniel and throw them into the den along with their children and wives , and the lions leaped upon them and tore them apart before they even hit the bottom of the den . 25-26 Afterward King Darius wrote this message addressed to everyone in his empire : “ Greetings ! I decree that everyone shall tremble and fear before the God of Daniel in every part of my kingdom . For his God is the living , unchanging God whose kingdom shall never be destroyed and whose power shall never end .
TLB	Daniel	6	27	He delivers his people , preserving them from harm ; he does great miracles in heaven and earth ; it is he who delivered Daniel from the power of the lions. ”

TLB	Daniel	7	7	Then , as I watched in my dream , a fourth animal rose up out of the ocean , too dreadful to describe and incredibly strong . It devoured some of its victims by tearing them apart with its huge iron teeth , and others it crushed beneath its feet . It was far more brutal and vicious than any of the other animals , and it had ten horns .

TLB	Daniel	7	3	Then four huge animals came up out of the water , each different from the other .
TLB	Daniel	7	4	The first was like a lion , but it had eagle ’ s wings ! And as I watched , its wings were pulled off so that it could no longer fly , and it was left standing on the ground , on two feet , like a man ; and a man ’ s mind was given to it .
TLB	Daniel	7	5	The second animal looked like a bear with its paw raised , ready to strike . It held three ribs between its teeth , and I heard a voice saying to it , “ Get up ! Devour many people ! ”
TLB	Daniel	7	6	The third of these strange animals looked like a leopard , but on its back it had wings like those of birds , and it had four heads ! And great power was given to it over all mankind .
TLB	Daniel	7	8	As I was looking at the horns , suddenly another small horn appeared among them , and three of the first ones were yanked out , roots and all , to give it room ; this little horn had a man ’ s eyes and a bragging mouth .
TLB	Daniel	7	9	I watched as thrones were put in place and the Ancient of Days—the Almighty God—sat down to judge . His clothing was as white as snow , his hair like whitest wool . He sat upon a fiery throne brought in on flaming wheels , and
TLB	Daniel	7	10	a river of fire flowed from before him . Millions of angels ministered to him , and hundreds of millions of people stood before him , waiting to be judged . Then the court began its session , and the books were opened .
TLB	Daniel	7	11	As I watched , the brutal fourth animal was killed and its body handed over to be burned because of its arrogance against Almighty God and the boasting of its little horn .
TLB	Daniel	7	12	As for the other three animals , their kingdoms were taken from them , but they were allowed to live a short time longer . [ a ]
TLB	Daniel	7	13	Next I saw the arrival of a Man—or so he seemed to be—brought there on clouds from heaven ; he approached the Ancient of Days and was presented to him .
TLB	Daniel	7	14	He was given the ruling power and glory over all the nations of the world , so that all people of every language must obey him . His power is eternal—it will never end ; his government shall never fall .
TLB	Daniel	7	15	I was confused and disturbed by all I had seen ( Daniel wrote in his report ) ,
TLB	Daniel	7	16	so I approached one of those standing beside the throne and asked him the meaning of all these things , and he explained them to me .
TLB	Daniel	7	17	“ These four huge animals , ” he said , “ represent four kings who will someday rule the earth .
TLB	Daniel	7	18	But in the end the people of the Most High God shall rule the governments of the world forever and forever. ”
TLB	Daniel	7	19	Then I asked about the fourth animal , the one so brutal and shocking , with its iron teeth and brass claws that tore men apart and stamped others to death with its feet .
TLB	Daniel	7	20	I asked , too , about the ten horns and the little horn that came up afterward and destroyed three of the others—the horn with the eyes and the loud , bragging mouth , the one that was stronger than the others .
TLB	Daniel	7	21	For I had seen this horn warring against God ’ s people and winning ,
TLB	Daniel	7	22	. - Daniel 7:27 the people of God , literally , “ the people of the saints of the Most High. ” The Living Bible copyright ©
TLB	Daniel	7	23	“ This fourth animal , ” he told me , “ is the fourth world power [ b ] that will rule the earth . It will be more brutal than any of the others ; it will devour the whole world , destroying everything before it .
TLB	Daniel	7	24	His ten horns are ten kings that will rise out of his empire ; then another king [ c ] will arise , more brutal than the other ten , and will destroy three of them .
TLB	Daniel	7	25	He will defy the Most High God and wear down the saints with persecution , and he will try to change all laws , morals , and customs . [ d ] God ’ s people will be helpless in his hands for three and a half years .
TLB	Daniel	7	26	“ But then the Ancient of Days will come [ e ] and open his court of justice and take all power from this vicious king , to consume and destroy it until the end .
TLB	Daniel	7	27	Then all nations under heaven and their power shall be given to the people of God ; [ f ] they shall rule all things forever , and all rulers shall serve and obey them. ”
TLB	Daniel	7	28	That was the end of the dream . When I awoke , I was greatly disturbed , and my face was pale with fright , but I told no one what I had seen .

TLB	Daniel	8	8	The victor became both proud and powerful , but suddenly , at the height of his power , his horn was broken , and in its place grew four good-sized horns [ b ] pointing in four directions .
TLB	Daniel	8	2	This time I was at Susa , [ a ] the capital in the province of Elam , standing beside the Ulai River .
TLB	Daniel	8	3	As I was looking around , I saw a ram with two long horns standing on the riverbank ; and as I watched , one of these horns began to grow , so that it was longer than the other .
TLB	Daniel	8	4	The ram butted everything out of its way , and no one could stand against it or help its victims . It did as it pleased and became very great .
TLB	Daniel	8	5	While I was wondering what this could mean , suddenly a buck goat appeared from the west so swiftly that it didn ’ t even touch the ground . This goat , which had one very large horn between its eyes ,
TLB	Daniel	8	6	rushed furiously at the two-horned ram .
TLB	Daniel	8	7	And the closer he came , the angrier he was . He charged into the ram and broke off both his horns . Now the ram was helpless , and the buck goat knocked him down and trampled him , for there was no one to rescue him .
TLB	Daniel	8	9	One of these , growing slowly at first , soon became very strong and attacked the south and east , and warred against the land of Israel . [ c ]
TLB	Daniel	8	10	He fought against the people of God and defeated some of their leaders . [ d ]
TLB	Daniel	8	11	He even challenged the Commander [ e ] of the army of heaven by canceling the daily sacrifices offered to him and by defiling his Temple .
TLB	Daniel	8	12	But the army of heaven was restrained from destroying him for this transgression . As a result , truth and righteousness perished , and evil triumphed and prospered . [ f ]
TLB	Daniel	8	13	Then I heard two of the holy angels talking to each other . One of them said , “ How long will it be until the daily sacrifice is restored again ? How long until the destruction of the Temple is avenged and God ’ s people triumph ? ”
TLB	Daniel	8	14	is the basis for the meaning expressed in the paraphrase . The Living Bible copyright ©
TLB	Daniel	8	15	As I was trying to understand the meaning of this vision , suddenly a man was standing in front of me—or at least he looked like a man—
TLB	Daniel	8	16	and I heard a man ’ s voice calling from across the river , “ Gabriel , tell Daniel the meaning of his dream. ”
TLB	Daniel	8	17	,
TLB	Daniel	8	18	Then I fainted , lying face downward on the ground . But he roused me with a touch and helped me to my feet .
TLB	Daniel	8	19	,
TLB	Daniel	8	20	“ The two horns of the ram you saw are the kings of Media and Persia ;
TLB	Daniel	8	21	the shaggy-haired goat is the nation of Greece , and its long horn represents the first great king of that country .
TLB	Daniel	8	22	When you saw the horn break off and four smaller horns replace it , this meant that the Grecian Empire will break into four sections with four kings , none of them as great as the first .
TLB	Daniel	8	23	. - Daniel 8:10 the people of God and . . . some of their leaders , literally , “ host of heaven . . . the starry host ” ; see 8:24 . - Daniel 8:11 the Commander , compare Joshua 5:13-15 . - Daniel 8:12 truth and righteousness perished , and evil triumphed and prospered , or “ and great indignities were perpetrated against the Temple ceremonies , so truth and righteousness perished. ” The Hebrew text is obscure . - Daniel 8:14 Twenty-three hundred days , literally , “ Twenty-three hundred mornings and evenings. ” - Daniel 8:23 with great shrewdness and intelligence , literally , “ who understands riddles ” ; an alternate rendering might read , “ skilled in intrigues. ” Probably a reference to Antiochus Epiphanes and further future fulfillment by the Antichrist at the end of human history . - Daniel 8:24 but it will be satanic strength and not his own , implied ; literally , “ but not with his power. ” - Daniel 8:26 This number is literal , and means just that , literally , “ The vision of the evenings and the mornings that has been told is true. ” Verse
TLB	Daniel	8	24	His power shall be mighty , but it will be satanic strength and not his own . [ i ] Prospering wherever he turns , he will destroy all who oppose him , though their armies be mighty , and he will devastate God ’ s people .
TLB	Daniel	8	25	“ He will be a master of deception , defeating many by catching them off guard as they bask in false security . Without warning he will destroy them . So great will he fancy himself to be that he will even take on the Prince of Princes in battle ; but in so doing he will seal his own doom , for he shall be broken by the hand of God , though no human means could overpower him .
TLB	Daniel	8	26	“ And then in your vision you heard about the twenty-three hundred days to pass before the rights of worship are restored . This number is literal , and means just that . [ j ] But none of these things will happen for a long time , so don ’ t tell anyone about them yet. ”
TLB	Daniel	8	27	Then I grew faint and was sick for several days . Afterward I was up and around again and performed my duties for the king , but I was greatly distressed by the dream and did not understand it . Footnotes - Daniel 8:2 Susa , one of several capitals of the empire at this time . - Daniel 8:8 in its place grew four good-sized horns .

TLB	Daniel	9	9	“ But the Lord our God is merciful and pardons even those who have rebelled against him .
TLB	Daniel	9	2	In that first year of his reign , I , Daniel , learned from the book of Jeremiah the prophet that Jerusalem must lie desolate for seventy years . [ a ]
TLB	Daniel	9	3	So I earnestly pleaded with the Lord God to end our captivity and send us back to our own land . [ b ] As I prayed , I fasted and wore rough sackcloth , and I sprinkled myself with ashes
TLB	Daniel	9	4	and confessed my sins and those of my people . “ O Lord , ” I prayed , “ you are a great and awesome God ; you always fulfill your promises of mercy to those who love you and keep your laws .
TLB	Daniel	9	5	But we have sinned so much ; we have rebelled against you and scorned your commands .
TLB	Daniel	9	6	We have refused to listen to your servants the prophets , whom you sent again and again down through the years , with your messages to our kings and princes and to all the people .
TLB	Daniel	9	7	years unaccounted for at the time of Messiah ’ s death . For their future fulfillment , see v.
TLB	Daniel	9	8	O Lord , we and our kings and princes and fathers are weighted down with shame because of all our sins .
TLB	Daniel	9	10	“ O Lord our God , we have disobeyed you ; we have flouted all the laws you gave us through your servants , the prophets .
TLB	Daniel	9	11	All Israel has disobeyed ; we have turned away from you and haven ’ t listened to your voice . And so the awesome curse of God has crushed us—the curse written in the law of Moses your servant .
TLB	Daniel	9	12	And you have done exactly as you warned us you would do , for never in all history has there been a disaster like what happened at Jerusalem to us and our rulers .
TLB	Daniel	9	13	Every curse against us written in the law of Moses has come true ; all the evils he predicted—all have come . But even so we still refuse to satisfy the Lord our God by turning from our sins and doing right .
TLB	Daniel	9	14	“ And so the Lord deliberately crushed us with the calamity he prepared ; he is fair in everything he does , but we would not obey .
TLB	Daniel	9	15	O Lord our God , you brought lasting honor to your name by removing your people from Egypt in a great display of power . Lord , do it again ! Though we have sinned so much and are full of wickedness ,
TLB	Daniel	9	16	yet because of all your faithful mercies , Lord , please turn away your furious anger from Jerusalem , your own city , your holy mountain . For the heathen mock at you because your city lies in ruins for our sins .
TLB	Daniel	9	17	“ O our God , hear your servant ’ s prayer ! Listen as I plead ! Let your face shine again with peace and joy upon your desolate sanctuary—for your own glory , Lord .
TLB	Daniel	9	18	“ O my God , bend down your ear and listen to my plea . Open your eyes and see our wretchedness , how your city lies in ruins—for everyone knows that it is yours . We don ’ t ask because we merit help , but because you are so merciful despite our grievous sins .
TLB	Daniel	9	19	“ O Lord , hear ; O Lord , forgive . O Lord , listen to me and act ! Don ’ t delay—for your own sake , O my God , because your people and your city bear your name. ”
TLB	Daniel	9	20	Even while I was praying and confessing my sin and the sins of my people , desperately pleading with the Lord my God for Jerusalem , his holy mountain ,
TLB	Daniel	9	21	Gabriel , whom I had seen in the earlier vision , flew swiftly to me at the time of the evening sacrifice
TLB	Daniel	9	22	and said to me , “ Daniel , I am here to help you understand God ’ s plans .
TLB	Daniel	9	23	The moment you began praying a command was given . I am here to tell you what it was , for God loves you very much . Listen and try to understand the meaning of the vision that you saw !

TLB	Daniel	10	10	But a hand touched me and lifted me , still trembling , to my hands and knees .
TLB	Daniel	10	2	When this vision came to me ( Daniel said later ) , I had been in mourning for three full weeks .
TLB	Daniel	10	3	All that time I tasted neither wine nor meat , and , of course , I went without desserts . I neither washed nor shaved nor combed my hair .
TLB	Daniel	10	4	Then one day early in April , as I was standing beside the great Tigris River , 5-6 I looked up , and suddenly there before me stood a person robed in linen garments , with a belt of purest gold around his waist and glowing , lustrous skin ! From his face came blinding flashes like lightning , and his eyes were pools of fire ; his arms and feet shone like polished brass , and his voice was like the roaring of a vast multitude of people .
TLB	Daniel	10	7	I , Daniel , alone saw this great vision ; the men with me saw nothing , but they were suddenly filled with unreasoning terror and ran to hide ,
TLB	Daniel	10	8	so I was left alone . When I saw this frightening vision , my strength left me , and I grew pale and weak with fright .
TLB	Daniel	10	9	Then he spoke to me , and I fell to the ground face downward in a deep faint .
TLB	Daniel	10	11	And I heard his voice— “ O Daniel , greatly beloved of God , ” he said , “ stand up and listen carefully to what I have to say to you , for God has sent me to you. ” So I stood up , still trembling with fear .
TLB	Daniel	10	12	Then he said , “ Don ’ t be frightened , Daniel , for your request has been heard in heaven and was answered the very first day you began to fast before the Lord and pray for understanding ; that very day I was sent here to meet you .
TLB	Daniel	10	13	But for twenty-one days the mighty Evil Spirit [ a ] who overrules the kingdom of Persia blocked my way . Then Michael , one of the top officers of the heavenly army , came to help me , so that I was able to break through these spirit rulers of Persia .
TLB	Daniel	10	14	Now I am here to tell you what will happen to your people , the Jews , at the end times—for the fulfillment of this prophecy is many years away. ”
TLB	Daniel	10	15	All this time I was looking down , unable to speak a word .
TLB	Daniel	10	16	Then someone—he looked like a man—touched my lips and I could talk again , and I said to the messenger from heaven , “ Sir , I am terrified by your appearance and have no strength .
TLB	Daniel	10	17	How can such a person as I even talk to you ? For my strength is gone , and I can hardly breathe. ”
TLB	Daniel	10	18	Then the one who seemed to be a man touched me again , and I felt my strength returning .
TLB	Daniel	10	19	“ God loves you very much , ” he said ; “ don ’ t be afraid ! Calm yourself ; be strong—yes , strong ! ” Suddenly , as he spoke these words , I felt stronger and said to him , “ Now you can go ahead and speak , sir , for you have strengthened me. ” 20-21 He replied , “ Do you know why I have come ? I am here to tell you what is written in the ‘ Book of the Future. ’ Then , when I leave , I will go again to fight my way back , past the prince of Persia ; and after him , the prince of Greece . Only Michael , the angel who guards your people Israel , [ b ] will be there to help me .

TLB	Daniel	11	11	“ I was the one sent to strengthen and help Darius the Mede in the first year of his reign .
TLB	Daniel	11	2	But now I will show you what the future holds . Three more Persian kings will reign , to be succeeded by a fourth , [ a ] far richer than the others . Using his wealth for political advantage , he will plan total war against Greece .
TLB	Daniel	11	3	“ Then a mighty king will rise in Greece , a king who will rule a vast kingdom and accomplish everything he sets out to do . [ b ]
TLB	Daniel	11	4	But at the zenith of his power , his kingdom will break apart and be divided into four weaker nations , not even ruled by his sons . For his empire will be torn apart and given to others .
TLB	Daniel	11	5	One of them , the king of Egypt , [ c ] will increase in power , but this king ’ s own officials will rebel against him and take away his kingdom and make it still more powerful .
TLB	Daniel	11	6	“ Several years later an alliance will be formed between the king of Syria [ d ] and the king of Egypt . The daughter of the king of Egypt will be given in marriage to the king of Syria as a gesture of peace , but she will lose her influence over him , and not only will her hopes be blighted , but those of her father , the king of Egypt , and of her ambassador and child .
TLB	Daniel	11	7	But when her brother [ e ] takes over as king of Egypt , he will raise an army against the king of Syria and march against him and defeat him .
TLB	Daniel	11	8	When he returns again to Egypt , he will carry back their idols with him , along with priceless gold and silver dishes ; and for many years afterward he will leave the Syrian king alone .
TLB	Daniel	11	9	“ Meanwhile , the king of Syria [ f ] will invade Egypt briefly but will soon return again to his own land . 10-11 However , the sons of this Syrian king will assemble a mighty army that will overflow across Israel into Egypt , to a fortress there . Then the king of Egypt , [ g ] in great anger , will rally against the vast forces of Syria and defeat them .
TLB	Daniel	11	12	Filled with pride after this great victory , he will have many thousands of his enemies killed , but his success will be short-lived .
TLB	Daniel	11	13	“ A few years later the Syrian king [ h ] will return with a fully equipped army far greater than the one he lost ,
TLB	Daniel	11	14	and other nations will join him in a crusade against Egypt . Insurgents among your own people , the Jews , will join them , thus fulfilling prophecy , [ i ] but they will not succeed .
TLB	Daniel	11	15	Then the Syrian king and his allies will come and lay siege to a fortified city of Egypt and capture it , and the proud armies of Egypt will go down to defeat .
TLB	Daniel	11	16	“ The Syrian king will march onward unopposed ; none will be able to stop him . And he will also enter ‘ The Glorious Land ’ of Israel and pillage it .
TLB	Daniel	11	17	This will be his plot for conquering all Egypt : he , too , will form an alliance with the Egyptian king , giving him a daughter in marriage , so that she can work for him from within . But the plan will fail .

TLB	Daniel	11	19	He will turn homeward again but will have trouble on the way and disappear .
TLB	Daniel	11	20	“ His successor [ j ] will be remembered as the king who sent a tax collector into Israel , but after a very brief reign , he will die mysteriously , though neither in battle nor in riot .
TLB	Daniel	11	21	“ Next to come to power will be an evil man not directly in line for royal succession . [ k ] But during a crisis he will take over the kingdom by flattery and intrigue .
TLB	Daniel	11	22	Then all opposition will be swept away before him , including a leader of the priests . [ l ]
TLB	Daniel	11	23	His promises will be worthless . From the first his method will be deceit ; with a mere handful of followers , he will become strong .
TLB	Daniel	11	24	He will enter the richest areas of the land without warning and do something never done before : he will take the property and wealth of the rich and scatter it out among the people . With great success he will besiege and capture powerful strongholds throughout his dominions , but this will last for only a short while .
TLB	Daniel	11	25	Then he will stir up his courage and raise a great army against Egypt ; and Egypt , too , will raise a mighty army , but to no avail , for plots against him will succeed .
TLB	Daniel	11	26	“ Those of his own household will bring his downfall ; his army will desert , and many will be killed .
TLB	Daniel	11	27	“ Both these kings [ m ] will be plotting against each other at the conference table , attempting to deceive each other . But it will make no difference , for neither can succeed until God ’ s appointed time has come .
TLB	Daniel	11	28	“ The Syrian king will then return home with great riches , first marching through Israel and destroying it .
TLB	Daniel	11	29	Then at the predestined time he will once again turn his armies southward , as he had threatened , but now it will be a very different story from those first two occasions . 30-31 For Roman warships [ n ] will scare him off , and he will withdraw and return home . Angered by having to retreat , the Syrian king will again pillage Jerusalem and pollute the sanctuary , putting a stop to the daily sacrifices , and worshiping idols inside the Temple . He will leave godless Jews in power when he leaves—men who have abandoned their fathers ’ faith .

TLB	Hosea	1	3	So Hosea married Gomer , daughter of Diblaim , and she conceived and bore him a son . 4-5 And the Lord said , “ Name the child Jezreel , for in the valley of Jezreel I am about to punish King Jehu ’ s dynasty to avenge the murders he committed ; [ a ] in fact , I will put an end to Israel as an independent kingdom , breaking the power of the nation in the valley of Jezreel. ”
TLB	Hosea	1	6	Soon Gomer had another child—this one a daughter . And God said to Hosea , “ Name her Lo-ruhamah ( meaning ‘ No more mercy ’ ) for I will have no more mercy upon Israel , to forgive her again .

TLB	Hosea	2	4	And I will not give special favors to her children as I would to my own , for they are not my children ; they belong to other men .

TLB	Hosea	9	15	“ All their wickedness began at Gilgal ; [ c ] there I began to hate them . I will drive them from my land because of their idolatry . I will love them no more , for all their leaders are rebels .
TLB	Hosea	9	16	Ephraim is doomed . The roots of Israel are dried up ; she shall bear no more fruit . And if she gives birth , I will slay even her beloved child. ”
TLB	Hosea	9	17	My God will destroy the people of Israel because they will not listen or obey . They will be wandering Jews , homeless among the nations .

TLB	Hosea	10	10	I will come against you for your disobedience ; I will gather the armies of the nations against you to punish you for your heaped-up sins .
TLB	Hosea	10	2	The hearts of her people are false toward God . They are guilty and must be punished . God will break down their heathen altars and smash their idols. ”
TLB	Hosea	10	3	Then they will say , “ We deserted the Lord and he took away our king . But what ’ s the difference ? We don ’ t need one anyway ! ”
TLB	Hosea	10	4	They make promises they don ’ t intend to keep . Therefore punishment will spring up among them like poisonous weeds in the furrows of the field .
TLB	Hosea	10	5	The people of Samaria tremble lest their calf idol at Beth-aven should be hurt ; the priests and people , too , mourn over the departed honor of their shattered gods .
TLB	Hosea	10	6	This idol—this calf-god thing—will be carted with them when they go as slaves to Assyria , a present to the great king there . Ephraim will be laughed at for trusting in this idol ; Israel will be put to shame .
TLB	Hosea	10	7	As for Samaria , her king shall disappear like a chip of wood upon an ocean wave .
TLB	Hosea	10	8	And the idol altars of Aven at Bethel where Israel sinned will crumble . Thorns and thistles will grow up to surround them . And the people will cry to the mountains and hills to fall upon them and crush them .
TLB	Hosea	10	9	“ O Israel , ever since that awful night in Gibeah , [ a ] there has been only sin , sin , sin ! You have made no progress whatever . Was it not right that the men of Gibeah were wiped out ?
TLB	Hosea	10	11	“ Ephraim is accustomed to treading out the grain—an easy job she loves . I have never put her under a heavy yoke before ; I have spared her tender neck . But now I will harness her to the plow and harrow . Her days of ease are gone .
TLB	Hosea	10	12	“ Plant the good seeds of righteousness , and you will reap a crop of my love ; plow the hard ground of your hearts , for now is the time to seek the Lord , that he may come and shower salvation upon you .
TLB	Hosea	10	13	“ But you have cultivated wickedness and raised a thriving crop of sins . You have earned the full reward of trusting in a lie—believing that military might and great armies can make a nation safe !
TLB	Hosea	10	14	“ Therefore , the terrors of war shall rise among your people , and all your forts will fall , just as at Beth-arbel , which Shalman [ b ] destroyed ; even mothers and children were dashed to death there .
TLB	Hosea	10	15	That will be your fate , too , you people of Israel , because of your great wickedness . In one morning the king of Israel shall be destroyed .

TLB	Hosea	11	2	But the more I called to him , the more he rebelled , sacrificing to Baal and burning incense to idols .
TLB	Hosea	11	3	I trained him from infancy , I taught him to walk , I held him in my arms . But he doesn ’ t know or even care that it was I who raised him .
TLB	Hosea	11	4	“ As a man would lead his favorite ox , [ a ] so I led Israel with my ropes of love . I loosened his muzzle so he could eat . I myself have stooped and fed him .
TLB	Hosea	11	5	But my people shall return to Egypt and Assyria because they won ’ t return to me .
TLB	Hosea	11	6	“ War will swirl through their cities ; their enemies will crash through their gates and trap them in their own fortresses .
TLB	Hosea	11	7	For my people are determined to desert me . And so I have sentenced them to slavery , and no one shall set them free .
TLB	Hosea	11	8	“ Oh , how can I give you up , my Ephraim ? How can I let you go ? How can I forsake you like Admah and Zeboiim ? [ b ] My heart cries out within me ; how I long to help you !
TLB	Hosea	11	9	No , I will not punish you as much as my fierce anger tells me to . This is the last time I will destroy Ephraim . For I am God and not man ; I am the Holy One living among you , and I did not come to destroy .
TLB	Hosea	11	10	“ For the people shall walk after the Lord . I shall roar as a lion at their enemies and my people shall return trembling from the west .

TLB	Hosea	12	12	Jacob fled to Syria and earned a wife by tending sheep .
TLB	Hosea	12	2	But the Lord is bringing a lawsuit against Judah . Jacob will be justly punished for his ways .
TLB	Hosea	12	3	When he was born , he struggled with his brother ; when he became a man , he even fought with God .
TLB	Hosea	12	4	Yes , he wrestled with the Angel and prevailed . He wept and pleaded for a blessing from him . He met God there at Bethel face-to-face . God spoke to him—
TLB	Hosea	12	5	the Lord , the God of heaven ’ s armies—Jehovah is his name .
TLB	Hosea	12	6	Oh , come back to God . Live by the principles of love and justice , and always be expecting much from him , your God .
TLB	Hosea	12	7	But no , my people are like crafty merchants selling from dishonest scales—they love to cheat .
TLB	Hosea	12	8	Ephraim boasts , “ I am so rich ! I have gotten it all by myself ! ” But riches can ’ t make up for sin .
TLB	Hosea	12	9	“ I am the same Lord , the same God , who delivered you from slavery in Egypt , and I am the one who will consign you to living in tents again , as you do each year at the Tabernacle Feast .
TLB	Hosea	12	10	I sent my prophets to warn you with many a vision and many a parable and dream. ”
TLB	Hosea	12	11	But the sins of Gilgal flourish just the same . Row on row of altars—like furrows in a field—are used for sacrifices to your idols . And Gilead , too , is full of fools [ b ] who worship idols .
TLB	Hosea	12	13	Then the Lord led his people out of Egypt by a prophet , who guided and protected them .
TLB	Hosea	12	14	But Ephraim has bitterly provoked the Lord . The Lord will sentence him to death as payment for his sins . Footnotes - Hosea 12:1 a dangerous game , implied . - Hosea 12:11 fools , or “ vanity. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Hosea	13	13	“ New birth is offered him , but he is like a child resisting in the womb—how stubborn ! how foolish !
TLB	Hosea	13	2	And now the people disobey more and more . They melt their silver to mold into idols , formed with skill by the hands of men . “ Sacrifice to these ! ” they say—men kissing calves !
TLB	Hosea	13	3	They shall disappear like morning mist , like dew that quickly dries away , like chaff blown by the wind , like a cloud of smoke .
TLB	Hosea	13	4	“ I alone am God , your Lord , and have been ever since I brought you out from Egypt . You have no God but me , for there is no other Savior .
TLB	Hosea	13	5	I took care of you in the wilderness , in that dry and thirsty land .
TLB	Hosea	13	6	But when you had eaten and were satisfied , then you became proud and forgot me .
TLB	Hosea	13	7	So I will come upon you like a lion , or a leopard lurking along the road .
TLB	Hosea	13	8	I will rip you to pieces like a bear whose cubs have been taken away , and like a lion I will devour you .
TLB	Hosea	13	9	“ O Israel , if I destroy you , who can save you ?
TLB	Hosea	13	10	Where is your king ? Why don ’ t you call on him for help ? Where are all the leaders of the land ? You asked for them , now let them save you !
TLB	Hosea	13	11	I gave you kings in my anger , and I took them away [ a ] in my wrath .
TLB	Hosea	13	12	Ephraim ’ s sins are harvested and stored away for punishment .
TLB	Hosea	13	14	Shall I ransom him from hell ? Shall I redeem him from Death ? O Death , bring forth your terrors for his tasting ! O Grave , demonstrate your plagues ! For I will not relent !
TLB	Hosea	13	15	“ He was called the most fruitful of all his brothers , but the east wind—a wind of the Lord from the desert—will blow hard upon him and dry up his land . All his flowing springs and green oases will dry away , and he will die of thirst .

TLB	Hosea	14	2	Bring your petition . Come to the Lord and say , “ O Lord , take away our sins ; be gracious to us and receive us , and we will offer you the sacrifice of praise .
TLB	Hosea	14	3	Assyria can not save us , nor can our strength in battle ; never again will we call the idols we have made ‘ our gods ’ ; for in you alone , O Lord , the fatherless find mercy. ”
TLB	Hosea	14	4	“ Then I will cure you of idolatry and faithlessness , and my love will know no bounds , for my anger will be forever gone !
TLB	Hosea	14	5	I will refresh Israel like the dew from heaven ; she will blossom as the lily and root deeply in the soil like cedars in Lebanon .
TLB	Hosea	14	6	Her branches will spread out as beautiful as olive trees , fragrant as the forests of Lebanon .
TLB	Hosea	14	7	Her people will return from exile far away and rest beneath my shadow . They will be a watered garden and blossom like grapes ; they will be as fragrant as the wines of Lebanon .

TLB	Joel	1	1	This message came from the Lord to Joel , son of Pethuel :
TLB	Joel	1	2	Listen , you aged men of Israel ! Everyone , listen ! In all your lifetime , yes , in all your history , have you ever heard of such a thing as I am going to tell you ?
TLB	Joel	1	3	In years to come , tell your children about it ; pass the awful story down from generation to generation .
TLB	Joel	1	4	After the cutter-locusts finish eating your crops , the swarmer-locusts will take what ’ s left ! After them will come the hopper-locusts ! And then the stripper-locusts too !
TLB	Joel	1	5	Wake up and weep , you drunkards , for all the grapes are ruined , and all your wine is gone !
TLB	Joel	1	6	A vast army of locusts [ a ] covers the land . It is a terrible army too numerous to count , with teeth as sharp as those of lions !
TLB	Joel	1	7	They have ruined my vines and stripped the bark from the fig trees , leaving trunks and branches white and bare .
TLB	Joel	1	8	Weep with sorrow , as a virgin weeps whose fiancé is dead .
TLB	Joel	1	9	Gone are the offerings of grain and wine to bring to the Temple of the Lord ; the priests are starving . Hear the crying of these ministers of God .
TLB	Joel	1	10	The fields are bare of crops . Sorrow and sadness are everywhere . The grain , the grapes , the olive oil are gone .
TLB	Joel	1	11	Well may you farmers stand so shocked and stricken ; well may you vinedressers weep . Weep for the wheat and the barley , too , for they are gone .
TLB	Joel	1	12	The grapevines are dead ; the fig trees are dying ; the pomegranates wither ; the apples shrivel on the trees ; all joy has withered with them .
TLB	Joel	1	13	O priests , robe yourselves in sackcloth . O ministers of my God , lie all night before the altar , weeping . For there are no more offerings of grain and wine for you .
TLB	Joel	1	14	Announce a fast ; call a solemn meeting . Gather the elders and all the people into the Temple of the Lord your God , and weep before him there .
TLB	Joel	1	15	Alas , this terrible day of punishment [ b ] is on the way . Destruction from the Almighty is almost here !
TLB	Joel	1	16	Our food will disappear before our eyes ; all joy and gladness will be ended in the Temple of our God .
TLB	Joel	1	17	The seed rots in the ground ; the barns and granaries are empty ; the grain has dried up in the fields .
TLB	Joel	1	18	The cattle groan with hunger ; the herds stand perplexed , for there is no pasture for them ; the sheep bleat in misery .
TLB	Joel	1	19	Lord , help us ! For the heat has withered the pastures and burned up all the trees .
TLB	Joel	1	20	Even the wild animals cry to you for help , for there is no water for them . The creeks are dry , and the pastures are scorched . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Joel	2	2	It is a day of darkness and gloom , of black clouds and thick darkness . What a mighty army ! It covers the mountains like night ! How great , how powerful these “ people ” are ! The likes of them have not been seen before , and never will again throughout the generations of the world !
TLB	Joel	2	3	Fire goes before them and follows them on every side ! Ahead of them the land lies fair as Eden ’ s Garden in all its beauty , but they destroy it to the ground ; not one thing escapes .
TLB	Joel	2	4	They look like tiny horses , and they run as fast .
TLB	Joel	2	5	Look at them leaping along the tops of the mountain ! Listen to the noise they make , like the rumbling of chariots , or the roar of fire sweeping across a field , and like a mighty army moving into battle .
TLB	Joel	2	6	Fear grips the waiting people ; their faces grow pale with fright .
TLB	Joel	2	7	These “ soldiers ” charge like infantry ; they scale the walls like picked and trained commandos . Straight forward they march , never breaking ranks .
TLB	Joel	2	8	They never crowd each other . Each is right in place . No weapon can stop them .
TLB	Joel	2	9	They swarm upon the city ; they run upon the walls ; they climb up into the houses , coming like thieves through the windows .
TLB	Joel	2	10	The earth quakes before them and the heavens tremble . The sun and moon are obscured and the stars are hid .
TLB	Joel	2	11	The Lord leads them with a shout . This is his mighty army , and they follow his orders . The day of the judgment of the Lord is an awesome , terrible thing . Who can endure it ?
TLB	Joel	2	12	That is why the Lord says , “ Turn to me now , while there is time . Give me all your hearts . Come with fasting , weeping , mourning .
TLB	Joel	2	13	Let your remorse tear at your hearts and not your garments. ” Return to the Lord your God , for he is gracious and merciful . He is not easily angered ; he is full of kindness and anxious not to punish you .
TLB	Joel	2	14	Who knows ? Perhaps even yet he will decide to leave you alone and give you a blessing instead of his terrible curse . Perhaps he will give you so much that you can offer your grain and wine to the Lord as before !
TLB	Joel	2	15	Sound the trumpet in Zion ! Call a fast and gather all the people together for a solemn meeting .
TLB	Joel	2	16	Bring everyone—the elders , the children , and even the babies . Call the bridegroom from his quarters and the bride from her privacy .
TLB	Joel	2	17	The priests , the ministers of God , will stand between the people and the altar , weeping ; and they will pray , “ Spare your people , O our God ; don ’ t let the heathen rule them , for they belong to you . Don ’ t let them be disgraced by the taunts of the heathen who say , ‘ Where is this God of theirs ? How weak and helpless he must be ! ’ ”
TLB	Joel	2	18	Then the Lord will pity his people and be indignant for the honor of his land !
TLB	Joel	2	19	He will reply , “ See , I am sending you much corn and wine and oil , to fully satisfy your need . No longer will I make you a laughingstock among the nations .
TLB	Joel	2	20	I will remove these armies from the north and send them far away ; I will turn them back into the parched wastelands where they will die ; half shall be driven into the Dead Sea and the rest into the Mediterranean , and then their rotting stench will rise upon the land . The Lord has done a mighty miracle for you. ”
TLB	Joel	2	21	Fear not , my people ; be glad now and rejoice , for he has done amazing things for you .
TLB	Joel	2	22	Let the flocks and herds forget their hunger ; the pastures will turn green again . The trees will bear their fruit ; the fig trees and grapevines will flourish once more .
TLB	Joel	2	23	Rejoice , O people of Jerusalem , rejoice in the Lord your God ! For the rains he sends are tokens of forgiveness . Once more the autumn rains will come , as well as those of spring .
TLB	Joel	2	24	The threshing floors will pile high again with wheat , and the presses overflow with olive oil and wine .
TLB	Joel	2	25	“ And I will give you back the crops the locusts ate ! —my great destroying army that I sent against you .
TLB	Joel	2	26	Once again you will have all the food you want . “ Praise the Lord , who does these miracles for you . Never again will my people experience disaster such as this .
TLB	Joel	2	27	And you will know that I am here among my people Israel , and that I alone am the Lord your God . And my people shall never again be dealt a blow like this .
TLB	Joel	2	28	“ After I have poured out my rains again , I will pour out my Spirit upon all of you ! Your sons and daughters will prophesy ; your old men will dream dreams , and your young men see visions .
TLB	Joel	2	29	And I will pour out my Spirit even on your slaves , men and women alike ,
TLB	Joel	2	30	and put strange symbols in the earth and sky—blood and fire and pillars of smoke .
TLB	Joel	2	31	“ The sun will be turned into darkness and the moon to blood before the great and terrible Day of the Lord shall come .
TLB	Joel	2	32	“ Everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord will be saved ; even in Jerusalem some will escape , just as the Lord has promised , for he has chosen some to survive . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Joel	3	5	“ You have taken my silver and gold and all my precious treasures and carried them off to your heathen temples .
TLB	Joel	3	6	You have sold the people of Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks , who took them far from their own land .

TLB	Joel	3	10	Melt your plowshares into swords , and beat your pruning hooks into spears . Let the weak be strong .

TLB	Joel	3	12	“ Collect the nations ; bring them to the valley of Jehoshaphat , for there I will sit to pronounce judgment on them all .
TLB	Joel	3	13	Now let the sickle do its work ; the harvest is ripe and waiting . Tread the winepress , for it is full to overflowing with the wickedness of these men. ”
TLB	Joel	3	14	Multitudes , multitudes waiting in the valley for the verdict of their doom ! For the Day of the Lord is near , in the Valley of Judgment .
TLB	Joel	3	15	The sun and moon will be darkened and the stars withdraw their light .
TLB	Joel	3	16	The Lord shouts from his Temple in Jerusalem , and the earth and sky begin to shake . But to his people Israel , the Lord will be very gentle . He is their Refuge and Strength .
TLB	Joel	3	17	“ Then you shall know at last that I am the Lord your God in Zion , my holy mountain . Jerusalem shall be mine forever ; the time will come when no foreign armies will pass through her anymore .
TLB	Joel	3	18	“ Sweet wine will drip from the mountains , and the hills shall flow with milk . Water will fill the dry streambeds of Judah , and a fountain will burst forth from the Temple of the Lord to water Acacia Valley .
TLB	Joel	3	19	Egypt will be destroyed , and Edom , too , because of their violence against the Jews , for they killed innocent people in those nations .
TLB	Joel	3	20	“ But Israel will prosper forever , and Jerusalem will thrive as generations pass .
TLB	Joel	3	21	For I will avenge the blood of my people ; I will not clear their oppressors of guilt . For my home is in Jerusalem with my people. ” Footnotes - Joel 3:2 Valley Where Jehovah Judges , or “ Valley of Jehoshaphat. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Amos	1	1	Amos was a herdsman living in the village of Tekoa . All day long he sat on the hillsides watching the sheep , keeping them from straying . [ a ]
TLB	Amos	1	2	One day , in a vision , God told him some of the things that were going to happen to his nation , Israel . This vision came to him at the time Uzziah was king of Judah and while Jeroboam ( son of Joash ) was king of Israel—two years before the earthquake . This is his report of what he saw and heard : The Lord roared—like a ferocious lion from his lair—from his Temple on Mount Zion . And suddenly the lush pastures of Mount Carmel withered and dried , and all the shepherds mourned .
TLB	Amos	1	3	The Lord says , “ The people of Damascus have sinned again and again , and I will not forget it . I will not leave her unpunished anymore . For they have threshed my people in Gilead as grain is threshed with iron rods .

TLB	Amos	1	5	I will snap the bars that locked the gates of Damascus and kill her people as far away as the plain of Aven , and the people of Syria shall return to Kir [ b ] as slaves. ” The Lord has spoken .

TLB	Amos	1	13	The Lord says , “ The people of Ammon have sinned again and again , and I will not forget it . I will not leave them unpunished anymore . For in their wars in Gilead to enlarge their borders they committed cruel crimes , ripping open pregnant women with their swords .

TLB	Amos	2	7	They trample the poor in the dust and kick aside the meek . “ And a man and his father defile the same temple girl , corrupting my holy name .
TLB	Amos	2	8	At their religious feasts they lounge in clothing stolen from their debtors , and in my own Temple they offer sacrifices of wine they purchased with stolen money .
TLB	Amos	2	9	“ Yet think of all I did for them ! I cleared the land of the Amorites before them—the Amorites , as tall as cedar trees , and strong as oaks ! But I lopped off their fruit and cut their roots .
TLB	Amos	2	10	And I brought you out from Egypt and led you through the desert forty years , to possess the land of the Amorites .
TLB	Amos	2	11	And I chose your sons to be Nazirites [ a ] and prophets—can you deny this , Israel ? ” asks the Lord .
TLB	Amos	2	12	“ But you caused the Nazirites to sin by urging them to drink your wine , and you silenced my prophets , telling them , ‘ Shut up ! ’
TLB	Amos	2	13	“ Therefore , I will make you groan as a wagon groans that is loaded with sheaves .
TLB	Amos	2	14	Your swiftest warriors will stumble in flight . The strong will all be weak , and the great ones can no longer save themselves .
TLB	Amos	2	15	The archer ’ s aim will fail , the swiftest runners won ’ t be fast enough to flee , and even the best of horsemen can ’ t outrun the danger then .
TLB	Amos	2	16	The most courageous of your mighty men will drop their weapons and run for their lives that day. ” The Lord God has spoken . Footnotes - Amos 2:11 to be Nazirites , see Numbers

TLB	Amos	3	3	For how can we walk together with your sins between us ?
TLB	Amos	3	2	“ Of all the peoples of the earth , I have chosen you alone . That is why I must punish you the more for all your sins .
TLB	Amos	3	4	“ Would I be roaring as a lion unless I had a reason ? The fact is , I am getting ready to destroy you . Even a young lion , when it growls , shows it is ready for its food .
TLB	Amos	3	5	A trap doesn ’ t snap shut unless it is stepped on ; your punishment is well deserved .
TLB	Amos	3	6	The alarm has sounded—listen and fear ! For I , the Lord , am sending disaster into your land .
TLB	Amos	3	7	“ But always , first of all , I warn you through my prophets . This I now have done. ”
TLB	Amos	3	8	The Lion has roared—tremble in fear . The Lord God has sounded your doom—I dare not refuse to proclaim it .
TLB	Amos	3	9	“ Call together the Assyrian and Egyptian leaders , saying , ‘ Take your seats now on the mountains of Samaria to witness the scandalous spectacle of all Israel ’ s crimes. ’
TLB	Amos	3	10	My people have forgotten what it means to do right , ” says the Lord . “ Their beautiful homes are full of the loot from their thefts and banditry .
TLB	Amos	3	11	Therefore , ” the Lord God says , “ an enemy is coming ! He is surrounding them and will shatter their forts and plunder those beautiful homes. ”
TLB	Amos	3	12	The Lord says , “ A shepherd tried to rescue his sheep from a lion , but it was too late ; he snatched from the lion ’ s mouth two legs and a piece of ear . So it will be when the Israelites in Samaria are finally rescued—all they will have left is half a chair and a tattered pillow .
TLB	Amos	3	13	“ Listen to this announcement and publish it throughout all Israel , ” says the Lord , the Lord Almighty :
TLB	Amos	3	14	“ On the same day that I punish Israel for her sins I will also destroy the idol altars at Bethel . The horns of the altar will be cut off and fall to the ground .
TLB	Amos	3	15	“ And I will destroy the beautiful homes of the wealthy—their winter mansions and their summer houses too—and demolish their ivory palaces. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Amos	4	4	Go ahead and sacrifice to idols at Bethel and Gilgal . Keep disobeying—your sins are mounting up . Sacrifice each morning and bring your tithes twice a week !
TLB	Amos	4	2	The Lord God has sworn by his holiness that the time will come when he will put hooks in your noses and lead you away like the cattle you are ; they will drag the last of you away with fishhooks !
TLB	Amos	4	3	You will be hauled from your beautiful homes and tossed out through the nearest breach in the wall . The Lord has said it .
TLB	Amos	4	5	Go through all your proper forms and give extra offerings . How you pride yourselves and crow about it everywhere !
TLB	Amos	4	6	“ I sent you hunger , ” says the Lord , “ but it did no good ; you still would not return to me .
TLB	Amos	4	7	I ruined your crops by holding back the rain three months before the harvest . I sent rain on one city but not another . While rain fell on one field , another was dry and withered .
TLB	Amos	4	8	People from two or three cities would make their weary journey for a drink of water to a city that had rain , but there wasn ’ t ever enough . Yet you wouldn ’ t return to me , ” says the Lord .
TLB	Amos	4	9	“ I sent blight and mildew on your farms and your vineyards ; the locusts ate your figs and olive trees . And still you wouldn ’ t return to me , ” says the Lord .
TLB	Amos	4	10	“ I sent you plagues like those of Egypt long ago . I killed your lads in war and drove away your horses . The stench of death was terrible to smell . And yet you refused to come .
TLB	Amos	4	11	I destroyed some of your cities , as I did Sodom and Gomorrah ; those left are like half-burned firebrands snatched away from fire . And still you won ’ t return to me , ” says the Lord .
TLB	Amos	4	12	“ Therefore , I will bring upon you all these further evils I have spoken of . Prepare to meet your God in judgment , Israel .
TLB	Amos	4	13	For you are dealing with the One who formed the mountains , made the winds , and knows your every thought ; he turns the morning to darkness and crushes down the mountains underneath his feet : Jehovah , the Lord , the Lord Almighty , is his name. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Amos	5	5	Don ’ t seek the idols of Bethel , Gilgal , or Beersheba ; for the people of Gilgal will be carried off to exile , and those of Bethel shall surely come to grief. ”
TLB	Amos	5	2	“ Beautiful Israel lies broken and crushed upon the ground and can not rise . No one will help her . She is left alone to die. ”
TLB	Amos	5	3	For the Lord God says , “ The city that sends a thousand men to battle , a hundred will return . The city that sends a hundred , only ten will come back alive. ”
TLB	Amos	5	4	The Lord says to the people of Israel , “ Seek me—and live .
TLB	Amos	5	6	Seek the Lord and live , or else he will sweep like fire through Israel and consume her , and none of the idols in Bethel can put it out .
TLB	Amos	5	7	O evil men , you make “ justice ” a bitter pill for the poor and oppressed . “ Righteousness ” and “ fair play ” are meaningless fictions to you !
TLB	Amos	5	8	Seek him who created the Seven Stars and the constellation Orion , who turns darkness into morning and day into night , who calls forth the water from the ocean and pours it out as rain upon the land . The Lord , Jehovah , is his name .
TLB	Amos	5	9	With blinding speed and violence he brings destruction on the strong , breaking all defenses .
TLB	Amos	5	10	How you hate honest judges ! How you despise people who tell the truth !
TLB	Amos	5	11	You trample the poor and steal their smallest crumb by all your taxes , fines , and usury ; therefore , you will never live in the beautiful stone houses you are building , nor drink the wine from the lush vineyards you are planting .
TLB	Amos	5	12	For many and great are your sins . I know them all so well . You are the enemies of everything good ; you take bribes ; you refuse justice to the poor .
TLB	Amos	5	13	Therefore , those who are wise will not try to interfere with the Lord in the dread day of your punishment .
TLB	Amos	5	14	Be good , flee evil—and live ! Then the Lord , the Lord Almighty , will truly be your Helper , as you have claimed he is .
TLB	Amos	5	15	Hate evil and love the good ; remodel your courts into true halls of justice . Perhaps even yet the Lord God of Hosts will have mercy on his people who remain .
TLB	Amos	5	16	Therefore the Lord God says this : “ There will be crying in all the streets and every road . Call for the farmers to weep with you too ; call for professional mourners to wail and lament .
TLB	Amos	5	17	There will be sorrow and crying in every vineyard , for I will pass through and destroy .
TLB	Amos	5	18	You say , ‘ If only the Day of the Lord were here , for then God would deliver us from all our foes. ’ But you have no idea what you ask . For that day will not be light and prosperity , but darkness and doom ! How terrible the darkness will be for you ; not a ray of joy or hope will shine .
TLB	Amos	5	19	In that day you will be as a man who is chased by a lion and is met by a bear , or a man in a dark room who leans against a wall and puts his hand on a snake .
TLB	Amos	5	20	Yes , that will be a dark and hopeless day for you .
TLB	Amos	5	21	“ I hate your show and pretense—your hypocrisy of ‘ honoring ’ me with your religious feasts and solemn assemblies .
TLB	Amos	5	22	I will not accept your burnt offerings and thank offerings . I will not look at your offerings of peace .
TLB	Amos	5	23	Away with your hymns of praise—they are mere noise to my ears . I will not listen to your music , no matter how lovely it is .
TLB	Amos	5	24	“ I want to see a mighty flood of justice—a torrent of doing good . 25-27 “ You sacrificed to me for forty years while you were in the desert , Israel—but always your real interest has been in your heathen gods—in Sakkuth your king , and in Kaiwan , your god of the stars , and in all the images of them you made . So I will send them into captivity with you far to the east of Damascus , ” says the Lord , the Lord Almighty . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Amos	6	6	You drink wine by the bucketful and perfume yourselves with sweet ointments , caring nothing at all that your brothers need your help .
TLB	Amos	6	2	Go over to Calneh and see what happened there ; then go to great Hamath and down to Gath in the Philistines ’ land . Once they were better and greater than you , but look at them now .
TLB	Amos	6	3	You push away all thought of punishment awaiting you , but by your deeds you bring the Day of Judgment near .
TLB	Amos	6	4	You lie on ivory beds surrounded with luxury , eating the meat of the tenderest lambs and the choicest calves .
TLB	Amos	6	5	You sing idle songs to the sound of the harp and fancy yourselves to be great musicians as King David was .
TLB	Amos	6	7	Therefore you will be the first to be taken as slaves ; suddenly your revelry will end .
TLB	Amos	6	8	Jehovah the Almighty Lord has sworn by his own name , “ I despise the pride and false glory of Israel and hate their beautiful homes . I will turn over this city and everything in it to her enemies. ”
TLB	Amos	6	9	If there are as few as ten of them left and only one house , they too will perish .
TLB	Amos	6	10	A man ’ s uncle will be the only one left to bury him , and when he goes in to carry his body from the house , he will ask the only one still alive inside , “ Are any others left ? ” And the answer will be , “ No , ” and he will add , “ Shhh . . . don ’ t mention the name of the Lord—he might hear you. ”
TLB	Amos	6	11	For the Lord commanded this : that homes both great and small should be smashed to pieces .
TLB	Amos	6	12	Can horses run on rocks ? Can oxen plow the sea ? Stupid even to ask—but no more stupid than what you do when you make a mockery of justice and corrupt and sour all that should be good and right .
TLB	Amos	6	13	And just as stupid is your rejoicing in how great you are when you are less than nothing—and priding yourselves on your own tiny power !
TLB	Amos	6	14	“ O Israel , I will bring against you a nation that will bitterly oppress you from your northern boundary to your southern tip , all the way from Hamath to the brook of Arabah , ” says the Lord , the Lord Almighty . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Amos	7	7	Then he showed me this : The Lord was standing beside a wall built with a plumb line , checking it with a plumb line to see if it was straight .
TLB	Amos	7	2	They ate everything in sight . Then I said , “ O Lord God , please forgive your people ! Don ’ t send them this plague ! If you turn against Israel , what hope is there ? For Israel is so small ! ”
TLB	Amos	7	3	So the Lord relented and did not fulfill the vision . “ I won ’ t do it , ” he told me .
TLB	Amos	7	4	Then the Lord God showed me a great fire he had prepared to punish them ; it had burned up the waters and was devouring the entire land .
TLB	Amos	7	5	Then I said , “ O Lord God , please don ’ t do it . If you turn against them , what hope is there ? For Israel is so small ! ”
TLB	Amos	7	6	Then the Lord turned from this plan too , and said , “ I won ’ t do that either. ”
TLB	Amos	7	8	And the Lord said to me , “ Amos , what do you see ? ” I answered , “ A plumb line. ” And he replied , “ I will test my people with a plumb line . I will no longer turn away from punishing .
TLB	Amos	7	9	The idol altars and temples of Israel will be destroyed , and I will destroy the dynasty of King Jeroboam by the sword. ”
TLB	Amos	7	10	But when Amaziah , the priest of Bethel , heard what Amos was saying , he rushed a message to Jeroboam , the king : “ Amos is a traitor to our nation and is plotting your death . This is intolerable . It will lead to rebellion all across the land .
TLB	Amos	7	11	He says you will be killed and Israel will be sent far away into exile and slavery. ”
TLB	Amos	7	12	Then Amaziah sent orders to Amos , “ Get out of here , you prophet , you ! Flee to the land of Judah and do your prophesying there !
TLB	Amos	7	13	Don ’ t bother us here with your visions , not here in the capital where the king ’ s chapel is ! ”
TLB	Amos	7	14	But Amos replied , “ I am not really one of the prophets . I do not come from a family of prophets . I am just a herdsman and fruit picker .
TLB	Amos	7	15	But the Lord took me from caring for the flocks and told me , ‘ Go and prophesy to my people Israel. ’
TLB	Amos	7	16	“ Now , therefore , listen to this message to you from the Lord . You say , ‘ Don ’ t prophesy against Israel. ’
TLB	Amos	7	17	The Lord ’ s reply is this : ‘ Because of your interference , your wife will become a prostitute in this city , your sons and daughters will be killed , and your land divided up . You yourself will die in a heathen land , and the people of Israel will certainly become slaves in exile , far from their land. ’ ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Amos	8	8	The land will tremble as it awaits its doom , and everyone will mourn . It will rise up like the river Nile at floodtime , toss about , and sink again .
TLB	Amos	8	2	“ What do you see , Amos ? ” he asked . I replied , “ A basket full of ripe fruit. ” Then the Lord said , “ This fruit represents my people Israel—ripe for punishment . I will not defer their punishment again .
TLB	Amos	8	3	The riotous sound of singing in the Temple will turn to weeping then . Dead bodies will be scattered everywhere . They will be carried out of the city in silence. ” The Lord has spoken .
TLB	Amos	8	4	Listen , you merchants who rob the poor , trampling on the needy ;
TLB	Amos	8	5	you who long for the Sabbath to end and the religious holidays to be over so you can get out and start cheating again—using your weighted scales and under-sized measures ;
TLB	Amos	8	6	you who make slaves of the poor , buying them for their debt of a piece of silver or a pair of shoes , or selling them your moldy wheat :
TLB	Amos	8	7	The Lord , the Pride of Israel , has sworn : “ I won ’ t forget your deeds !
TLB	Amos	8	9	At that time I will make the sun go down at noon and darken the earth in the daytime .
TLB	Amos	8	10	And I will turn your parties into times of mourning , and your songs of joy will be turned to cries of despair . You will wear funeral clothes and shave your heads as signs of sorrow , as if your only son had died ; bitter , bitter will be that day .
TLB	Amos	8	11	“ The time is surely coming , ” says the Lord God , “ when I will send a famine on the land—not a famine of bread or water , but of hearing the words of the Lord .
TLB	Amos	8	12	Men will wander everywhere from sea to sea , seeking the word of the Lord , searching , running here and going there , but will not find it .
TLB	Amos	8	13	Beautiful girls and fine young men alike will grow faint and weary , thirsting for the word of God .
TLB	Amos	8	14	And those who worship the idols of Samaria , Dan , and Beersheba shall fall and never rise again. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Amos	9	9	For I have commanded that Israel be sifted by the other nations as grain is sifted in a sieve , yet not one true kernel will be lost .
TLB	Amos	9	2	“ Though they dig down to Sheol , I will reach down and pull them up ; though they climb into the heavens , I will bring them down .
TLB	Amos	9	3	Though they hide among the rocks at the top of Carmel , I will search them out and capture them . Though they hide at the bottom of the ocean , I will send the sea serpent after them to bite and destroy them .
TLB	Amos	9	4	Though they volunteer for exile , I will command the sword to kill them there . I will see to it that they receive evil and not good. ”
TLB	Amos	9	5	The Lord Almighty touches the land and it melts , and all its people mourn . It rises like the river Nile in Egypt and then sinks again .
TLB	Amos	9	6	The upper stories of his home are in the heavens , the first floor on the earth . He calls for the vapor to rise from the ocean and pours it down as rain upon the ground . Jehovah , the Lord , is his name .
TLB	Amos	9	7	“ O people of Israel , are you any more to me than the Ethiopians are ? Have not I , who brought you out of Egypt , done as much for other people too ? I brought the Philistines from Caphtor and the Syrians out of Kir .
TLB	Amos	9	8	“ The eyes of the Lord God are watching Israel , that sinful nation , and I will root her up and scatter her across the world . Yet I have promised that this rooting out will not be permanent .
TLB	Amos	9	10	But all these sinners who say , ‘ God will not touch us , ’ will die by the sword .
TLB	Amos	9	11	“ Then , at that time I will rebuild the City of David , which is now lying in ruins , and return it to its former glory ,
TLB	Amos	9	12	and Israel will possess what is left of Edom and of all the nations that belong to me. ” For so the Lord , who plans it all , has said .
TLB	Amos	9	13	“ The time will come when there will be such abundance of crops that the harvesttime will scarcely end before the farmer starts again to sow another crop , and the terraces of grapes upon the hills of Israel will drip sweet wine !
TLB	Amos	9	14	I will restore the fortunes of my people Israel , and they will rebuild their ruined cities and live in them again ; they will plant vineyards and gardens ; they will eat their crops and drink their wine .
TLB	Amos	9	15	I will firmly plant them there upon the land that I have given them ; they shall not be pulled up again , ” says the Lord your God . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Obadiah	1	1	In a vision the Lord God showed Obadiah the future of the land of Edom . [ a ] “ A report has come from the Lord , ” he said , “ that God has sent an ambassador to the nations with this message : ‘ Attention ! You are to send your armies against Edom and destroy her ! ’ ”
TLB	Obadiah	1	2	“ I will cut you down to size among the nations , Edom , making you small and despised .
TLB	Obadiah	1	3	“ You are proud because you live in those high , inaccessible cliffs . ‘ Who can ever reach us way up here ! ’ you boast . Don ’ t fool yourselves !
TLB	Obadiah	1	4	Though you soar as high as eagles , and build your nest among the stars , I will bring you plummeting down , ” says the Lord .
TLB	Obadiah	1	5	“ Far better it would be for you if thieves had come at night to plunder you—for they would not take everything ! Or if your vineyards were robbed of all their fruit—for at least the gleanings would be left !
TLB	Obadiah	1	6	Every nook and cranny will be searched and robbed , and every treasure found and taken .
TLB	Obadiah	1	7	“ All your allies will turn against you and help to push you out of your land . They will promise peace while plotting your destruction . Your trusted friends will set traps for you , and all your counterstrategy will fail .
TLB	Obadiah	1	8	In that day not one wise man will be left in all of Edom ! ” says the Lord . “ For I will fill the wise men of Edom with stupidity .
TLB	Obadiah	1	9	The mightiest soldiers of Teman will be confused , and helpless to prevent the slaughter .
TLB	Obadiah	1	10	“ And why ? Because of what you did to your brother Israel . Now your sins will be exposed for all to see ; ashamed and defenseless , you will be cut off forever .
TLB	Obadiah	1	11	For you deserted Israel in his time of need . You stood aloof , refusing to lift a finger to help him when invaders carried off his wealth and divided Jerusalem among them by lot ; you were as one of his enemies .
TLB	Obadiah	1	12	“ You should not have done it . You should not have gloated when they took him far away to foreign lands ; you should not have rejoiced in the day of his misfortune ; you should not have mocked in his time of need .
TLB	Obadiah	1	13	You yourselves went into the land of Israel in the day of his calamity and looted him . You made yourselves rich at his expense .
TLB	Obadiah	1	14	You stood at the crossroads and killed those trying to escape ; you captured the survivors and returned them to their enemies in that terrible time of his distress .
TLB	Obadiah	1	15	The Lord ’ s vengeance will soon fall upon all Gentile nations . As you have done to Israel , so will it be done to you . Your acts will boomerang upon your heads .
TLB	Obadiah	1	16	You drank my cup of punishment upon my holy mountain , and the nations round about will drink it too ; yes , they will drink and stagger back and disappear from history , no longer nations anymore .
TLB	Obadiah	1	17	“ But Jerusalem will become a refuge , a way of escape . Israel will reoccupy the land .
TLB	Obadiah	1	18	Israel will be a fire that sets the dry fields of Edom aflame . There will be no survivors , ” for the Lord has spoken .
TLB	Obadiah	1	19	Then my people who live in the Negeb shall occupy the hill country of Edom ; those living in Judean lowlands shall possess the Philistine plains and repossess the fields of Ephraim and Samaria . And the people of Benjamin shall possess Gilead .
TLB	Obadiah	1	20	The Israeli exiles shall return and occupy the Phoenician coastal strip as far north as Zarephath . Those exiled in Asia Minor shall return to their homeland and conquer the Negeb ’ s outlying villages .
TLB	Obadiah	1	21	For deliverers will come to Jerusalem and rule all Edom . And the Lord shall be King ! Footnotes - Obadiah 1:1 Edom . A nation southeast of Israel including Petra , the city hewn from rocks ; her southern boundary was on the Gulf of Aqaba . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Jonah	1	1	The Lord sent this message to Jonah , the son of Amittai :
TLB	Jonah	1	2	“ Go to the great city of Nineveh , and give them this announcement from the Lord : ‘ I am going to destroy you , for your wickedness rises before me ; it smells to highest heaven. ’ ”
TLB	Jonah	1	3	But Jonah was afraid to go and ran away from the Lord . He went down to the seacoast , to the port of Joppa , where he found a ship leaving for Tarshish . He bought a ticket , went on board , and climbed down into the dark hold of the ship to hide there from the Lord .
TLB	Jonah	1	4	But as the ship was sailing along , suddenly the Lord flung a terrific wind over the sea , causing a great storm that threatened to send them to the bottom .
TLB	Jonah	1	5	Fearing for their lives , the desperate sailors shouted to their gods for help and threw the cargo overboard to lighten the ship . And all this time Jonah was sound asleep down in the hold .
TLB	Jonah	1	6	So the captain went down after him . “ What do you mean , ” he roared , “ sleeping at a time like this ? Get up and cry to your god , and see if he will have mercy on us and save us ! ”
TLB	Jonah	1	7	Then the crew decided to draw straws to see which of them had offended the gods and caused this terrible storm ; and Jonah drew the short one .
TLB	Jonah	1	8	“ What have you done , ” they asked , “ to bring this awful storm upon us ? Who are you ? What is your work ? What country are you from ? What is your nationality ? ” 9-10 And he said , “ I am a Jew ; [ a ] I worship Jehovah , the God of heaven , who made the earth and sea. ” Then he told them he was running away from the Lord . The men were terribly frightened when they heard this . “ Oh , why did you do it ? ” they shouted .
TLB	Jonah	1	11	“ What should we do to you to stop the storm ? ” For it was getting worse and worse .
TLB	Jonah	1	12	“ Throw me out into the sea , ” he said , “ and it will become calm again . For I know this terrible storm has come because of me. ”
TLB	Jonah	1	13	They tried harder to row the boat ashore , but couldn ’ t make it . The storm was too fierce to fight against .
TLB	Jonah	1	14	Then they shouted out a prayer to Jehovah , Jonah ’ s God . “ O Jehovah , ” they pleaded , “ don ’ t make us die for this man ’ s sin , and don ’ t hold us responsible for his death , for it is not our fault—you have sent this storm upon him for your own good reasons. ”
TLB	Jonah	1	15	Then they picked up Jonah and threw him overboard into the raging sea—and the storm stopped !
TLB	Jonah	1	16	The men stood there in awe before Jehovah , and they sacrificed to him and vowed to serve him .
TLB	Jonah	1	17	Now the Lord had arranged for a great fish to swallow Jonah . And Jonah was inside the fish three days and three nights . Footnotes - Jonah 1:9 I am a Jew , literally , “ I am a Hebrew. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Jonah	2	2	“ In my great trouble I cried to the Lord and he answered me ; from the depths of death I called , and Lord , you heard me !
TLB	Jonah	2	3	You threw me into the ocean depths ; I sank down into the floods of waters and was covered by your wild and stormy waves .
TLB	Jonah	2	4	Then I said , ‘ O Lord , you have rejected me and cast me away . How shall I ever again see your holy Temple ? ’
TLB	Jonah	2	5	“ I sank beneath the waves , and death was very near . The waters closed above me ; the seaweed wrapped itself around my head .
TLB	Jonah	2	6	I went down to the bottoms of the mountains that rise from the ocean floor . I was locked out of life and imprisoned in the land of death . But , O Lord my God , you have snatched me from the yawning jaws of death !

TLB	Jonah	3	3	So Jonah obeyed and went to Nineveh . Now Nineveh was a very large city with many villages around it—so large that it would take three days to walk through it . [ a ] 4-5 But the very first day when Jonah entered the city and began to preach , the people repented . Jonah shouted to the crowds that gathered around him , “ Forty days from now Nineveh will be destroyed ! ” And they believed him and declared a fast ; from the king on down , everyone put on sackcloth—the rough , coarse garments worn at times of mourning . [ b ]
TLB	Jonah	3	6	For when the king of Nineveh heard what Jonah was saying , he stepped down from his throne , laid aside his royal robes , put on sackcloth , and sat in ashes .
TLB	Jonah	3	7	And the king and his nobles sent this message throughout the city : “ Let no one , not even the animals , eat anything at all , nor even drink any water .
TLB	Jonah	3	8	Everyone must wear sackcloth and cry mightily to God , and let everyone turn from his evil ways , from his violence and robbing .
TLB	Jonah	3	9	Who can tell ? Perhaps even yet God will decide to let us live and will hold back his fierce anger from destroying us. ”
TLB	Jonah	3	10	And when God saw that they had put a stop to their evil ways , he abandoned his plan to destroy them and didn ’ t carry it through . Footnotes - Jonah 3:3 so large that it would take three days to walk through it . The Hebrew text makes no distinction between the city proper—the walls of which were only about eight miles in circumference , accommodating a population of about 175,000 persons—and the administrative district of Nineveh , which was about thirty to sixty miles across . - Jonah 3:4 the rough , coarse garments worn at times of mourning , implied .

TLB	Jonah	4	4	Then the Lord said , “ Is it right to be angry about this ? ”
TLB	Jonah	4	2	He complained to the Lord about it : “ This is exactly what I thought you ’ d do , Lord , when I was there in my own country and you first told me to come here . That ’ s why I ran away to Tarshish . For I knew you were a gracious God , merciful , slow to get angry , and full of kindness ; I knew how easily you could cancel your plans for destroying these people .
TLB	Jonah	4	3	“ Please kill me , Lord ; I ’ d rather be dead than alive when nothing that I told them happens . [ a ] ”
TLB	Jonah	4	5	So Jonah went out and sat sulking [ b ] on the east side of the city , and he made a leafy shelter to shade him as he waited there to see if anything would happen to the city .
TLB	Jonah	4	6	And when the leaves of the shelter withered in the heat , the Lord arranged for a vine to grow up quickly and spread its broad leaves over Jonah ’ s head to shade him . This made him comfortable and very grateful .
TLB	Jonah	4	7	But God also prepared a worm ! The next morning the worm ate through the stem of the plant , so that it withered away and died .
TLB	Jonah	4	8	Then when the sun was hot , God ordered a scorching east wind to blow on Jonah , and the sun beat down upon his head until he grew faint and wished to die . For he said , “ Death is better than this ! ”
TLB	Jonah	4	9	And God said to Jonah , “ Is it right for you to be angry because the plant died ? ” “ Yes , ” Jonah said , “ it is ; it is right for me to be angry enough to die ! ”
TLB	Jonah	4	10	Then the Lord said , “ You feel sorry for yourself when your shelter is destroyed , though you did no work to put it there , and it is , at best , short-lived .
TLB	Jonah	4	11	And why shouldn ’ t I feel sorry for a great city like Nineveh with its 120,000 people in utter spiritual darkness [ c ] and all its cattle ? ” Footnotes - Jonah 4:3 when nothing that I told them happens , implied . - Jonah 4:5 sat sulking , implied . - Jonah 4:11 with its 120,000 people in utter spiritual darkness , or “ with its 120,000 children who don ’ t know their right hands from their left. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Micah	1	1	These are messages from the Lord to Micah , who lived in the town of Moresheth during the reigns of King Jotham , King Ahaz , and King Hezekiah , all kings of Judah . The messages were addressed to both Samaria and Judah and came to Micah in the form of visions .
TLB	Micah	1	2	Attention ! Let all the peoples of the world listen . For the Lord in his holy Temple has made accusations against you !
TLB	Micah	1	3	Look ! He is coming ! He leaves his throne in heaven and comes to earth , walking on the mountaintops .
TLB	Micah	1	4	They melt beneath his feet and flow into the valleys like wax in fire , like water pouring down a hill .
TLB	Micah	1	5	And why is this happening ? Because of the sins of Israel and Judah . What sins ? The idolatry and oppression centering in the capital cities , Samaria and Jerusalem !
TLB	Micah	1	6	Therefore , the entire city of Samaria will crumble into a heap of rubble and become an open field , her streets plowed up for planting grapes ! The Lord will tear down her wall and her forts , exposing their foundations , and pour their stones into the valleys below .
TLB	Micah	1	7	All her carved images will be smashed to pieces ; her ornate idol temples , built with the gifts of worshipers , will all be burned . [ a ]
TLB	Micah	1	8	I will wail and lament , howling as a jackal , mournful as an ostrich crying across the desert sands at night . I will walk naked and barefoot in sorrow and shame ;
TLB	Micah	1	9	for my people ’ s wound is far too deep to heal . The Lord stands ready at Jerusalem ’ s gates to punish her .
TLB	Micah	1	10	Woe to the city of Gath . Weep , men of Bakah . In Beth-leaphrah roll in the dust in your anguish and shame .
TLB	Micah	1	11	There go the people of Shaphir , [ b ] led away as slaves—stripped , naked and ashamed . The people of Zaanan dare not show themselves outside their walls . The foundations of Beth-ezel are swept away—the very ground on which it stood .
TLB	Micah	1	12	The people of Maroth vainly hope for better days , but only bitterness awaits them as the Lord stands poised against Jerusalem .
TLB	Micah	1	13	Quick ! Use your swiftest chariots and flee , O people of Lachish , for you were the first of the cities of Judah to follow Israel in her sin of idol worship . Then all the cities of the south began to follow your example .
TLB	Micah	1	14	Write off Moresheth [ c ] of Gath ; there is no hope of saving her . The town of Achzib has deceived the kings of Israel , for she promised help she can not give .
TLB	Micah	1	15	You people of Mareshah will be a prize to your enemies . They will penetrate to Adullam , the “ Pride of Israel. ”
TLB	Micah	1	16	Weep , weep for your little ones . For they are snatched away , and you will never see them again . They have gone as slaves to distant lands . Shave your heads in sorrow . Footnotes - Micah 1:7 will all be burned , literally , “ they shall return to the hire of a harlot. ” - Micah 1:11 There go the people of Shaphir . In the Hebrew there is frequent wordplay in vv . 10-14 . Micah bitterly declaims each town , demonstrating by the use of puns their failures . Shaphir sounds like the Hebrew word for “ beauty , ” here contrasted with their shame ; Zaanan sounds like the verb meaning “ to go forth , ” here contrasted with the fear of its inhabitants to venture outside ; Beth-ezel sounds like a word for “ foundation , ” which had been taken away from them . - Micah 1:14 Moresheth , Micah ’ s hometown ( 1:1 ) .

TLB	Micah	2	2	You want a certain piece of land or someone else ’ s house ( though it is all he has ) ; you take it by fraud and threats and violence .
TLB	Micah	2	3	But the Lord God says , “ I will reward your evil with evil ; nothing can stop me ; never again will you be proud and haughty after I am through with you .
TLB	Micah	2	4	Then your enemies will taunt you and mock your dirge of despair : ‘ We are finished , ruined . God has confiscated our land and sent us far away ; he has given what is ours to others. ’ ”
TLB	Micah	2	5	Others will set your boundaries then . “ The People of the Lord ” will live where they are sent .
TLB	Micah	2	6	“ Don ’ t say such things , ” the people say . “ Don ’ t harp on things like that . It ’ s disgraceful , that sort of talk . Such evils surely will not come our way. ”
TLB	Micah	2	7	Is that the right reply for you to make , O House of Jacob ? Do you think the Spirit of the Lord likes to talk to you so roughly ? No ! His threats are for your good , to get you on the path again .
TLB	Micah	2	8	Yet to this very hour my people rise against me . For you steal the shirts right off the backs of those who trusted you , who walk in peace .
TLB	Micah	2	9	You have driven out the widows from their homes and stripped their children of every God-given right .
TLB	Micah	2	10	Up ! Begone ! This is no more your land and home , for you have filled it with sin , and it will vomit you out .
TLB	Micah	2	11	“ I ’ ll preach to you the joys of wine and drink ” —that is the kind of drunken , lying prophet that you like !
TLB	Micah	2	12	“ The time will come , O Israel , when I will gather you—all that are left—and bring you together again like sheep in a fold , like a flock in a pasture—a noisy , happy crowd .
TLB	Micah	2	13	The Messiah [ a ] will lead you out of exile and bring you through the gates of your cities of captivity , back to your own land . Your King will go before you—the Lord leads on. ” Footnotes - Micah 2:13 The Messiah , literally , “ He who opens the breach. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Micah	3	3	You devour them , flog them , break their bones , and chop them up like meat for the cooking pot—
TLB	Micah	3	2	yet you are the very ones who hate good and love evil ; you skin my people and strip them to the bone .
TLB	Micah	3	4	and then you plead with the Lord for his help in times of trouble ! Do you really expect him to listen ? He will look the other way !
TLB	Micah	3	5	You false prophets ! You who lead his people astray ! You who cry “ Peace ” to those who give you food and threaten those who will not pay ! This is God ’ s message to you :
TLB	Micah	3	6	“ The night will close about you and cut off all your visions ; darkness will cover you with never a word from God . The sun will go down upon you , and your day will end .
TLB	Micah	3	7	Then at last you will cover your faces in shame and admit that your messages were not from God. ”
TLB	Micah	3	8	But as for me , I am filled with power , with the Spirit of the Lord , fearlessly announcing God ’ s punishment on Israel for her sins .
TLB	Micah	3	9	Listen to me , you leaders of Israel who hate justice and love unfairness
TLB	Micah	3	10	and fill Jerusalem with murder and sin of every kind—
TLB	Micah	3	11	you leaders who take bribes ; you priests and prophets who won ’ t preach and prophesy until you ’ re paid . ( And yet you fawn upon the Lord and say , “ All is well—the Lord is here among us . No harm can come to us. ” )
TLB	Micah	3	12	It is because of you that Jerusalem will be plowed like a field and become a heap of rubble ; the mountaintop where the Temple stands will be overgrown with brush . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Micah	4	4	Everyone will live quietly in his own home in peace and prosperity , for there will be nothing to fear . The Lord himself has promised this .
TLB	Micah	4	2	“ Come , ” they will say to one another , “ let us visit the mountain of the Lord , and see the Temple of the God of Israel ; he will tell us what to do , and we will do it. ” For in those days the whole world will be ruled by the Lord from Jerusalem ! He will issue his laws and announce his decrees from there .
TLB	Micah	4	3	He will arbitrate among the nations and dictate to strong nations far away . They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks ; nations shall no longer fight each other , for all war will end . There will be universal peace , and all the military academies and training camps will be closed down .
TLB	Micah	4	5	( Therefore we will follow the Lord our God forever and ever , even though all the nations around us worship idols ! )
TLB	Micah	4	6	In that coming day , the Lord says that he will bring back his punished people—sick and lame and dispossessed—
TLB	Micah	4	7	and make them strong again in their own land , a mighty nation , and the Lord himself shall be their King from Mount Zion forever .
TLB	Micah	4	8	O Jerusalem—the Watchtower of God ’ s people—your royal might and power will come back to you again , just as before .
TLB	Micah	4	9	But for now , you scream in terror . Where is your king to lead you ? He is dead ! Where are your wise men ? All are gone ! Pain has gripped you like a woman in labor .
TLB	Micah	4	10	Writhe and groan in your terrible pain , O people of Zion , for you must leave this city and live in the fields ; you will be sent far away into exile in Babylon . But there I will rescue you and free you from the grip of your enemies .
TLB	Micah	4	11	True , many nations have gathered together against you , calling for your blood , eager to destroy you .
TLB	Micah	4	12	But they do not know the thoughts of the Lord nor understand his plan , for the time will come when the Lord will gather together the enemies of his people like sheaves upon the threshing floor , helpless before Israel .
TLB	Micah	4	13	Rise , thresh , O daughter of Zion ; I will give you horns of iron and hoofs of brass ; you will trample to pieces many people , and you will give their wealth as offerings to the Lord , the Lord of all the earth . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Micah	5	5	He will be our Peace . And when the Assyrian [ a ] invades our land and marches across our hills , he will appoint seven shepherds to watch over us , eight princes to lead us .
TLB	Micah	5	2	“ O Bethlehem Ephrathah , you are but a small Judean village , yet you will be the birthplace of my King who is alive from everlasting ages past ! ”
TLB	Micah	5	3	God will abandon his people to their enemies until she who is to give birth has her son ; then at last his fellow countrymen—the exile remnants of Israel—will rejoin their brethren in their own land .
TLB	Micah	5	4	And he shall stand and feed his flock in the strength of the Lord , in the majesty of the name of the Lord his God , and his people shall remain there undisturbed , for he will be greatly honored all around the world .
TLB	Micah	5	6	They will rule Assyria with drawn swords and enter the gates of the land of Nimrod . He will deliver us from the Assyrians when they invade our land .
TLB	Micah	5	7	Then the nation of Israel will refresh the world like a gentle dew or the welcome showers of rain ,
TLB	Micah	5	8	and Israel will be as strong as a lion . The nations will be like helpless sheep before her !
TLB	Micah	5	9	She will stand up to her foes ; all her enemies will be wiped out .
TLB	Micah	5	10	“ At that same time , ” says the Lord , “ I will destroy all the weapons you depend on ,
TLB	Micah	5	11	tear down your walls , and demolish the defenses of your cities .
TLB	Micah	5	12	I will put an end to all witchcraft—there will be no more fortune-tellers to consult—
TLB	Micah	5	13	and destroy all your idols . Never again will you worship what you have made ,
TLB	Micah	5	14	for I will abolish the heathen shrines from among you , and destroy the cities where your idol temples stand .

TLB	Micah	6	6	“ How can we make up to you for what we ’ ve done ? ” you ask . “ Shall we bow before the Lord with offerings of yearling calves ? ” Oh no !
TLB	Micah	6	2	“ And now , O mountains , listen to the Lord ’ s complaint ! For he has a case against his people Israel ! He will prosecute them to the full .
TLB	Micah	6	3	O my people , what have I done that makes you turn away from me ? Tell me why your patience is exhausted ! Answer me !
TLB	Micah	6	4	For I brought you out of Egypt and cut your chains of slavery . I gave you Moses , Aaron , and Miriam to help you .
TLB	Micah	6	5	“ Don ’ t you remember , O my people , how Balak , king of Moab , tried to destroy you through the curse of Balaam , son of Beor , but I made him bless you instead ? That is the kindness I showed you again and again . Have you no memory at all of what happened at Acacia and Gilgal and how I blessed you there ? ”
TLB	Micah	6	7	For if you offered him thousands of rams and ten thousands of rivers of olive oil—would that please him ? Would he be satisfied ? If you sacrificed your oldest child , would that make him glad ? Then would he forgive your sins ? Of course not !
TLB	Micah	6	8	No , he has told you what he wants , and this is all it is : to be fair , just , merciful , and to walk humbly with your God .
TLB	Micah	6	9	The Lord ’ s voice calls out to all Jerusalem—listen to the Lord if you are wise ! “ The armies of destruction are coming ; the Lord is sending them .
TLB	Micah	6	10	For your sins are very great—is there to be no end of getting rich by cheating ? The homes of the wicked are full of ungodly treasures and lying scales .
TLB	Micah	6	11	Shall I say ‘ Good ! ’ to all your merchants with their bags of false , deceitful weights ? How could God be just while saying that ?
TLB	Micah	6	12	Your rich men are wealthy through extortion and violence ; your citizens are so used to lying that their tongues can ’ t tell the truth !
TLB	Micah	6	13	“ Therefore I will wound you ! I will make your hearts miserable for all your sins .
TLB	Micah	6	14	You will eat but never have enough ; hunger pangs and emptiness will still remain . And though you try and try to save your money , it will come to nothing at the end , and what little you succeed in storing up I ’ ll give to those who conquer you ! [ a ]
TLB	Micah	6	15	You will plant crops but not harvest them ; you will press out the oil from the olives and not get enough to anoint yourself ! You will trample the grapes but get no juice to make your wine .
TLB	Micah	6	16	“ The only commands you keep are those of Omri ; the only example you follow is that of Ahab ! Therefore , I will make an awesome example of you—I will destroy you . I will make you the laughingstock of the world ; all who see you will snicker and sneer ! ” Footnotes - Micah 6:14 See Haggai 1:6 . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Micah	7	7	As for me , I look to the Lord for his help ; I wait for God to save me ; he will hear me .
TLB	Micah	7	3	They go at their evil deeds with both hands , and how skilled they are in using them ! The governor and judge alike demand bribes . The rich man pays them off and tells them whom to ruin . Justice is twisted between them .
TLB	Micah	7	4	Even the best of them are prickly as briars ; the straightest is more crooked than a hedge of thorns . But your judgment day is coming swiftly now ; your time of punishment is almost here ; confusion , destruction , and terror will be yours .
TLB	Micah	7	5	Don ’ t trust anyone , not your best friend—not even your wife !
TLB	Micah	7	6	For the son despises his father ; the daughter defies her mother ; the bride curses her mother-in-law . Yes , a man ’ s enemies will be found in his own home .
TLB	Micah	7	8	Do not rejoice against me , O my enemy , for though I fall , I will rise again ! When I sit in darkness , the Lord himself will be my Light .
TLB	Micah	7	9	I will be patient while the Lord punishes me , for I have sinned against him ; then he will defend me from my enemies and punish them for all the evil they have done to me . God will bring me out of my darkness into the light , and I will see his goodness .
TLB	Micah	7	10	Then my enemy will see that God is for me and be ashamed for taunting , “ Where is that God of yours ? ” Now with my own eyes I see them trampled down like mud in the street .
TLB	Micah	7	11	Your cities , people of God , will be rebuilt , much larger and more prosperous than before .
TLB	Micah	7	12	Citizens of many lands will come and honor you—from Assyria to Egypt , and from Egypt to the Euphrates , from sea to sea and from distant hills and mountains .
TLB	Micah	7	13	But first comes terrible destruction to Israel [ a ] for the great wickedness of her people .
TLB	Micah	7	14	O Lord , come and rule your people ; lead your flock ; make them live in peace and prosperity ; let them enjoy the fertile pastures of Bashan and Gilead as they did long ago .
TLB	Micah	7	15	“ Yes , ” replies the Lord , “ I will do mighty miracles for you , like those when I brought you out of slavery in Egypt .
TLB	Micah	7	16	All the world will stand amazed at what I will do for you and be embarrassed at their puny might . They will stand in silent awe , deaf to all around them. ”
TLB	Micah	7	17	They will see what snakes they are , lowly as worms crawling from their holes . They will come trembling out from their fortresses to meet the Lord our God . They will fear him ; they will stand in awe .
TLB	Micah	7	18	Where is another God like you , who pardons the sins of the survivors among his people ? You can not stay angry with your people , for you love to be merciful .
TLB	Micah	7	19	Once again you will have compassion on us . You will tread our sins beneath your feet ; you will throw them into the depths of the ocean !
TLB	Micah	7	20	You will bless us as you promised Jacob long ago . You will set your love upon us , as you promised our father Abraham !

TLB	Nahum	1	1	and
TLB	Nahum	1	2	God is jealous over those he loves ; that is why he takes vengeance on those who hurt them . He furiously destroys their enemies .
TLB	Nahum	1	3	He is slow in getting angry , but when aroused , his power is incredible , and he does not easily forgive . He shows his power in the terrors of the cyclone and the raging storms ; clouds are billowing dust beneath his feet !
TLB	Nahum	1	4	At his command the oceans and rivers become dry sand ; the lush pastures of Bashan and Carmel fade away ; the green forests of Lebanon wilt .
TLB	Nahum	1	5	In his presence mountains quake and hills melt ; the earth crumbles , and its people are destroyed .
TLB	Nahum	1	6	Who can stand before an angry God ? His fury is like fire ; the mountains tumble down before his anger .
TLB	Nahum	1	7	The Lord is good . When trouble comes , he is the place to go ! And he knows everyone who trusts in him !
TLB	Nahum	1	8	But he sweeps away his enemies with an overwhelming flood ; he pursues them all night long .
TLB	Nahum	1	9	What are you thinking of , Nineveh , to defy the Lord ? He will stop you with one blow ; he won ’ t need to strike again .
TLB	Nahum	1	10	He tosses his enemies into the fire like a tangled mass of thorns . They burst into flames like straw .
TLB	Nahum	1	11	Who is this king [ b ] of yours who dares to plot against the Lord ?
TLB	Nahum	1	12	But the Lord is not afraid of him ! “ Though he build his army millions strong , ” the Lord declares , “ it will vanish . “ O my people , I have punished you enough !

TLB	Nahum	2	2	For the land of the people of God lies empty and broken after your attacks , but the Lord will restore their honor and power again !
TLB	Nahum	2	3	Shields flash red in the sunlight ! The attack begins ! See their scarlet uniforms ! See their glittering chariots moving forward side by side , pulled by prancing steeds !
TLB	Nahum	2	4	Your own chariots race recklessly along the streets and through the squares , darting like lightning , gleaming like torches .
TLB	Nahum	2	5	The king shouts for his officers ; they stumble in their haste , rushing to the walls to set up their defenses .
TLB	Nahum	2	6	But too late ! The river gates are open ! The enemy has entered ! The palace is in panic !
TLB	Nahum	2	7	The queen of Nineveh is brought out naked to the streets and led away , a slave , with all her maidens weeping after her ; listen to them mourn like doves and beat their breasts !
TLB	Nahum	2	8	Nineveh is like a leaking water tank ! Her soldiers slip away , deserting her ; she can not hold them back . “ Stop , stop , ” she shouts , but they keep on running .
TLB	Nahum	2	9	Loot the silver ! Loot the gold ! There seems to be no end of treasures . Her vast , uncounted wealth is stripped away .
TLB	Nahum	2	10	Soon the city is an empty shambles ; hearts melt in horror ; knees quake ; her people stand aghast , pale-faced and trembling .
TLB	Nahum	2	11	Where now is that great Nineveh , lion of the nations , full of fight and boldness , where even the old and feeble , as well as the young and tender , lived unafraid ?
TLB	Nahum	2	12	O Nineveh , once mighty lion ! You crushed your enemies to feed your children and your wives , and filled your city and your homes with captured goods and slaves .
TLB	Nahum	2	13	But now the Lord Almighty has turned against you . He destroys your weapons . Your chariots stand there , silent and unused . Your finest youths lie dead . Never again will you bring back slaves from conquered nations ; never again will you rule the earth . Footnotes - Nahum 2:1 Nineveh , you are finished ! This chapter predicts the events of the year

TLB	Nahum	3	3	See the flashing swords and glittering spears in the upraised arms of the cavalry ! The dead are lying in the streets—bodies , heaps of bodies , everywhere . Men stumble over them , scramble to their feet , and fall again .
TLB	Nahum	3	2	Listen ! Hear the crack of the whips as the chariots rush forward against her , wheels rumbling , horses ’ hoofs pounding , and chariots clattering as they bump wildly through the streets !
TLB	Nahum	3	4	All this because Nineveh sold herself to the enemies of God . The beautiful and faithless city , mistress of deadly charms , enticed the nations with her beauty , then taught them all to worship her false gods , [ a ] bewitching people everywhere .
TLB	Nahum	3	5	“ No wonder I stand against you , ” says the Lord Almighty ; “ and now all the earth will see your nakedness and shame .
TLB	Nahum	3	6	I will cover you with filth and show the world how really vile you are. ”
TLB	Nahum	3	7	All who see you will shrink back in horror : “ Nineveh lies in utter ruin. ” Yet no one anywhere regrets your fate !
TLB	Nahum	3	8	Are you any better than Thebes , [ b ] straddling the Nile , protected on all sides by the river ?
TLB	Nahum	3	9	Ethiopia and the whole land of Egypt were her mighty allies , and she could call on them for infinite assistance , as well as Put and Libya .
TLB	Nahum	3	10	Yet Thebes fell and her people were led off as slaves ; her babies were dashed to death against the stones of the streets . Soldiers drew straws to see who would get her officers as servants . All her leaders were bound in chains .
TLB	Nahum	3	11	Nineveh , too , will stagger like a drunkard and hide herself in fear .
TLB	Nahum	3	12	All your forts will fall . They will be devoured like first-ripe figs that fall into the mouths of those who shake the trees .
TLB	Nahum	3	13	Your troops will be weak and helpless as women . The gates of your land will be opened wide to the enemy and set on fire and burned .
TLB	Nahum	3	14	Get ready for the siege ! Store up water ! Strengthen the forts ! Prepare many bricks for repairing your walls ! Go into the pits to trample the clay , and pack it in the molds !
TLB	Nahum	3	15	But in the middle of your preparations , the fire will devour you ; the sword will cut you down ; the enemy will consume you like young locusts that eat up everything before them . There is no escape , though you multiply like grasshoppers .
TLB	Nahum	3	16	Merchants , numerous as stars , filled your city with vast wealth , but your enemies swarm like locusts and carry it away .
TLB	Nahum	3	17	Your princes and officials crowd together like grasshoppers in the hedges in the cold , but all of them will flee away and disappear , like locusts when the sun comes up and warms the earth .
TLB	Nahum	3	18	O Assyrian king , your princes lie dead in the dust ; your people are scattered across the mountains ; there is no shepherd now to gather them .
TLB	Nahum	3	19	There is no healing for your wound—it is far too deep to cure . All who hear your fate will clap their hands for joy , for where can one be found who has not suffered from your cruelty ? The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Habakkuk	1	1	This is the message that came to the prophet Habakkuk in a vision from God :
TLB	Habakkuk	1	2	O Lord , how long must I call for help before you will listen ? I shout to you in vain ; there is no answer . “ Help ! Murder ! ” I cry , but no one comes to save .
TLB	Habakkuk	1	3	Must I forever see this sin and sadness all around me ? Wherever I look I see oppression and bribery and men who love to argue and to fight .
TLB	Habakkuk	1	4	The law is not enforced , and there is no justice given in the courts , for the wicked far outnumber the righteous , and bribes and trickery prevail .
TLB	Habakkuk	1	5	The Lord replied : “ Look , and be amazed ! You will be astounded at what I am about to do ! For I am going to do something in your own lifetime that you will have to see to believe .
TLB	Habakkuk	1	6	I am raising a new force on the world scene , the Chaldeans , [ a ] a cruel and violent nation who will march across the world and conquer it .
TLB	Habakkuk	1	7	They are notorious for their cruelty . They do as they like , and no one can interfere .
TLB	Habakkuk	1	8	Their horses are swifter than leopards . They are a fierce people , more fierce than wolves at dusk . Their cavalry move proudly forward from a distant land ; like eagles they come swooping down to pounce upon their prey .
TLB	Habakkuk	1	9	All opposition melts away before the terror of their presence . They collect captives like sand .
TLB	Habakkuk	1	10	“ They scoff at kings and princes and scorn their forts . They simply heap up dirt against their walls and capture them !
TLB	Habakkuk	1	11	[ b ] They sweep past like wind and are gone , but their guilt is deep , for they claim their power is from their gods. ”
TLB	Habakkuk	1	12	O Lord my God , my Holy One , you who are eternal—is your plan in all of this to wipe us out ? Surely not ! O God our Rock , you have decreed the rise of these Chaldeans to chasten and correct us for our awful sins .
TLB	Habakkuk	1	13	We are wicked , but they far more ! Will you , who can not allow sin in any form , stand idly by while they swallow us up ? Should you be silent while the wicked destroy those who are better than they ?
TLB	Habakkuk	1	14	Are we but fish , to be caught and killed ? Are we but creeping things that have no leader to defend them from their foes ?
TLB	Habakkuk	1	15	Must we be strung up on their hooks and dragged out in their nets , while they rejoice ?
TLB	Habakkuk	1	16	Then they will worship their nets and burn incense before them ! “ These are the gods who make us rich , ” they ’ ll say .
TLB	Habakkuk	1	17	Will you let them get away with this forever ? Will they succeed forever in their heartless wars ? Footnotes - Habakkuk 1:6 the Chaldeans , a tribe of Semites living between Babylon and the Persian Gulf , who began to assert themselves against the Assyrians around

TLB	Habakkuk	2	2	And the Lord said to me , “ Write my answer on a billboard , [ a ] large and clear , so that anyone can read it at a glance and rush to tell the others .
TLB	Habakkuk	2	3	But these things I plan won ’ t happen right away . Slowly , steadily , surely , the time approaches when the vision will be fulfilled . If it seems slow , [ b ] do not despair , for these things will surely come to pass . Just be patient ! They will not be overdue a single day !
TLB	Habakkuk	2	4	“ Note this : Wicked men trust themselves alone as these Chaldeans do , [ c ] and fail ; but the righteous man trusts in me and lives !
TLB	Habakkuk	2	5	What ’ s more , these arrogant Chaldeans are betrayed by all their wine , for it is treacherous . In their greed they have collected many nations , but like death and hell , they are never satisfied .
TLB	Habakkuk	2	6	The time is coming when all their captives will taunt them , saying : ‘ You robbers ! At last justice has caught up with you ! Now you will get your just deserts for your oppression and extortion ! ’
TLB	Habakkuk	2	7	“ Suddenly your debtors will rise up in anger and turn on you and take all you have , while you stand trembling and helpless .
TLB	Habakkuk	2	8	You have ruined many nations ; now they will ruin you . You murderers ! You have filled the countryside with lawlessness and all the cities too .
TLB	Habakkuk	2	9	“ Woe to you for getting rich by evil means , attempting to live beyond the reach of danger .
TLB	Habakkuk	2	10	By the murders you commit , you have shamed your name and forfeited your lives .
TLB	Habakkuk	2	11	The very stones in the walls of your homes cry out against you , and the beams in the ceilings echo what they say .
TLB	Habakkuk	2	12	“ Woe to you who build cities with money gained from murdering and robbery !
TLB	Habakkuk	2	13	Has not the Lord decreed that godless nations ’ gains will turn to ashes in their hands ? They work so hard , but all in vain !
TLB	Habakkuk	2	14	( “ The time will come when all the earth is filled , as the waters fill the sea , with an awareness of the glory of the Lord . )
TLB	Habakkuk	2	15	“ Woe to you for making your neighboring lands reel and stagger like drunkards beneath your blows , and then gloating over their nakedness and shame .
TLB	Habakkuk	2	16	Soon your own glory will be replaced by shame . Drink down God ’ s judgment on yourselves . Stagger and fall !
TLB	Habakkuk	2	17	You cut down the forests of Lebanon—now you will be cut down ! You terrified the wild animals you caught in your traps—now terror will strike you because of all your murdering and violence in cities everywhere .
TLB	Habakkuk	2	18	“ What profit was there in worshiping all your man-made idols ? What a foolish lie that they could help ! What fools you were to trust what you yourselves had made .
TLB	Habakkuk	2	19	Woe to those who command their lifeless wooden idols to arise and save them , who call out to the speechless stone to tell them what to do . Can images speak for God ? They are overlaid with gold and silver , but there is no breath at all inside !

TLB	Habakkuk	3	3	I see God moving across the deserts from Mount Sinai . [ b ] His brilliant splendor fills the earth and sky ; his glory fills the heavens , and the earth is full of his praise ! What a wonderful God he is !
TLB	Habakkuk	3	2	O Lord , now I have heard your report , and I worship you in awe for the fearful things you are going to do . In this time of our deep need , begin again to help us , as you did in years gone by . Show us your power to save us . In your wrath , remember mercy .
TLB	Habakkuk	3	4	From his hands flash rays of brilliant light . He rejoices in his awesome power . [ c ]
TLB	Habakkuk	3	5	Pestilence marches before him ; plague follows close behind .
TLB	Habakkuk	3	6	He stops ; he stands still for a moment , gazing at the earth . Then he shakes the nations , scattering the everlasting mountains and leveling the hills . His power is just the same as always !
TLB	Habakkuk	3	7	I see the people of Cushan and of Midian in mortal fear . 8-9 Was it in anger , Lord , you smote the rivers and parted the sea ? Were you displeased with them ? No , you were sending your chariots of salvation ! All saw your power ! Then springs burst forth upon the earth at your command ! [ d ]
TLB	Habakkuk	3	10	The mountains watched and trembled . Onward swept the raging water . The mighty deep cried out , announcing its surrender to the Lord . [ e ]
TLB	Habakkuk	3	11	The lofty sun and moon began to fade , obscured by brilliance from your arrows and the flashing of your glittering spear .
TLB	Habakkuk	3	12	You marched across the land in awesome anger and trampled down the nations in your wrath .
TLB	Habakkuk	3	13	You went out to save your chosen people . You crushed the head of the wicked and laid bare his bones from head to toe .
TLB	Habakkuk	3	14	You destroyed with their own weapons those who came out like a whirlwind , thinking Israel would be an easy prey .
TLB	Habakkuk	3	15	Your horsemen marched across the sea ; the mighty waters piled high .
TLB	Habakkuk	3	16	I tremble when I hear all this ; my lips quiver with fear . My legs give way beneath me , and I shake in terror . I will quietly wait for the day of trouble to come upon the people who invade us .
TLB	Habakkuk	3	17	Even though the fig trees are all destroyed , and there is neither blossom left nor fruit ; though the olive crops all fail , and the fields lie barren ; even if the flocks die in the fields and the cattle barns are empty ,
TLB	Habakkuk	3	18	yet I will rejoice in the Lord ; I will be happy in the God of my salvation .
TLB	Habakkuk	3	19	The Lord God is my strength ; he will give me the speed of a deer and bring me safely over the mountains .

TLB	Zephaniah	1	1	Subject : a message from the Lord . To : Zephaniah ( son of Cushi , grandson of Gedaliah , great-grandson of Amariah , and great-great-grandson of Hezekiah ) . When : During the reign of Josiah ( son of Amon ) king of Judah . [ a ]
TLB	Zephaniah	1	2	“ I will sweep away everything in all your land , ” says the Lord . “ I will destroy it to the ground .
TLB	Zephaniah	1	3	I will sweep away both men and animals alike . Mankind and all the idols that he worships—all will vanish . Even the birds of the air and the fish in the sea will perish .
TLB	Zephaniah	1	4	I will crush Judah and Jerusalem with my fist and destroy every remnant of those who worship Baal ; I will put an end to their idolatrous priests , so that even the memory of them will disappear .
TLB	Zephaniah	1	5	They go up on their roofs and bow to the sun , moon , and stars . They ‘ follow the Lord , ’ but worship Molech too ! I will destroy them .
TLB	Zephaniah	1	6	And I will destroy those who formerly worshiped the Lord , but now no longer do , and those who never loved him and never wanted to. ”
TLB	Zephaniah	1	7	Stand in silence in the presence of the Lord . For the awesome Day of his Judgment has come ; he has prepared a great slaughter of his people and has chosen their executioners . [ b ]
TLB	Zephaniah	1	8	“ On that Day of Judgment I will punish the leaders and princes of Judah and all others wearing heathen clothing . [ c ]
TLB	Zephaniah	1	9	Yes , I will punish those who follow heathen customs and who rob and kill to fill their masters ’ homes with evil gain of violence and fraud .
TLB	Zephaniah	1	10	A cry of alarm will begin at the farthest gate of Jerusalem , coming closer and closer until the noise of the advancing army reaches the very top of the hill where the city is built .
TLB	Zephaniah	1	11	“ Wail in sorrow , you people of Jerusalem . All your greedy businessmen , all your loan sharks—all will die .
TLB	Zephaniah	1	12	“ I will search with lanterns in Jerusalem ’ s darkest corners to find and punish those who sit contented in their sins , indifferent to God , thinking he will leave them alone .
TLB	Zephaniah	1	13	They are the very ones whose property will be plundered by the enemy , whose homes will be ransacked ; they will never have a chance to live in the new homes they have built . They will never drink wine from the vineyards they have planted .
TLB	Zephaniah	1	14	“ That terrible day is near . Swiftly it comes—a day when strong men will weep bitterly .
TLB	Zephaniah	1	15	It is a day of the wrath of God poured out ; it is a day of terrible distress and anguish , a day of ruin and desolation , a day of darkness and gloom , of clouds , blackness ,
TLB	Zephaniah	1	16	trumpet calls , and battle cries ; down go the walled cities and strongest battlements !
TLB	Zephaniah	1	17	“ I will make you as helpless as a blind man searching for a path because you have sinned against the Lord ; therefore , your blood will be poured out into the dust and your bodies will lie there rotting on the ground. ”

TLB	Zephaniah	2	2	while there still is time—before judgment begins and your opportunity is blown away like chaff ; before the fierce anger of the Lord falls and the terrible day of his wrath begins .

TLB	Zephaniah	2	6	The coastland will become a pasture , a place of shepherd camps and folds for sheep .

TLB	Zephaniah	2	9	Therefore as I live , ” says the Lord Almighty , God of Israel , “ Moab and Ammon will be destroyed like Sodom and Gomorrah and become a place of stinging nettles , salt pits , and eternal desolation ; those of my people who are left will plunder and possess them. ”
TLB	Zephaniah	2	10	They will receive the wages of their pride , for they have scoffed at the people of the Lord Almighty .
TLB	Zephaniah	2	11	The Lord will do terrible things to them . He will starve out all those gods of foreign powers , and everyone shall worship him , each in his own land throughout the world .
TLB	Zephaniah	2	12	You Ethiopians , too , will be slain by his sword ,
TLB	Zephaniah	2	13	and so will the lands of the north ; he will destroy Assyria and make its great capital Nineveh a desolate wasteland like a wilderness .
TLB	Zephaniah	2	14	That once proud city will become a pastureland for sheep . All sorts of wild animals will have their homes in her . Hedgehogs will burrow there ; the vultures and the owls will live among the ruins of her palaces , hooting from the gaping windows ; the ravens will croak from her doors .

TLB	Zephaniah	2	15	This is the fate of that vast , prosperous city that lived in such security , that said to herself , “ In all the world there is no city as great as I. ” But now—see how she has become a place of utter ruins , a place for animals to live !

TLB	Zephaniah	3	4	Her “ prophets ” are liars seeking their own gain ; her priests defile the Temple by their disobedience to God ’ s laws .
TLB	Zephaniah	3	5	But the Lord is there within the city , and he does no wrong . Day by day his justice is more evident , but no one heeds—the wicked know no shame .

TLB	Zephaniah	3	8	But the Lord says , “ Be patient ; the time is coming soon when I will stand up and accuse these evil nations .

TLB	Haggai	1	1	Subject : a message from the Lord . To : Haggai the prophet , who delivered it to Zerubbabel ( son of Shealtiel ) , governor of Judah ; and to Joshua ( son of Josedech ) , the High Priest—for it was addressed to them . [ a ] When : In late August of the second year of the reign of King Darius I .
TLB	Haggai	1	2	“ Why is everyone saying it is not the right time for rebuilding my Temple ? ” asks the Lord . 3-4 His reply to them is this : “ Is it then the right time for you to live in luxurious homes , when the Temple lies in ruins ?
TLB	Haggai	1	5	Look at the result :
TLB	Haggai	1	6	You plant much but harvest little . You have scarcely enough to eat or drink and not enough clothes to keep you warm . Your income disappears , as though you were putting it into pockets filled with holes !
TLB	Haggai	1	7	“ Think it over , ” says the Lord Almighty . “ Consider how you have acted and what has happened as a result !
TLB	Haggai	1	8	Then go up into the mountains , bring down timber , and rebuild my Temple , and I will be pleased with it and appear there in my glory , ” says the Lord .
TLB	Haggai	1	9	“ You hope for much but get so little . And when you bring it home , I blow it away—it doesn ’ t last at all . Why ? Because my Temple lies in ruins , and you don ’ t care . Your only concern is your own fine homes .
TLB	Haggai	1	10	That is why I am holding back the rains from heaven and giving you such scant crops .
TLB	Haggai	1	11	In fact , I have called for a drought upon the land , yes , and in the highlands too—a drought to wither the grain and grapes and olives and all your other crops , a drought to starve both you and all your cattle and ruin everything you have worked so hard to get. ”
TLB	Haggai	1	12	Then Zerubbabel ( son of Shealtiel ) , the governor of Judah , and Joshua ( son of Josedech ) , the High Priest , and the few people remaining in the land obeyed Haggai ’ s message from the Lord their God ; they began to worship him in earnest .
TLB	Haggai	1	13	Then the Lord told them ( again sending the message through Haggai , his messenger ) , “ I am with you ; I will bless you. ” 14-15 And the Lord gave them a desire to rebuild his Temple ; so they all gathered in early September of the second year of King Darius ’ s reign and volunteered their help .

TLB	Haggai	2	2	“ Ask this question of the governor and High Priest and everyone left in the land :
TLB	Haggai	2	3	“ ‘ Who among you can remember the Temple as it was before ? How glorious it was ! In comparison , it is nothing now , is it ?
TLB	Haggai	2	4	But take courage , O Zerubbabel and Joshua and all the people ; take courage and work , for I am with you , says the Lord Almighty .
TLB	Haggai	2	5	For I promised when you left Egypt that my Spirit would remain among you ; so don ’ t be afraid. ’
TLB	Haggai	2	6	“ For the Lord Almighty says , ‘ In just a little while I will begin to shake the heavens and earth—and the oceans , too , and the dry land .
TLB	Haggai	2	7	I will shake all nations , and the Desire of All Nations [ a ] shall come to this Temple , and I will fill this place with my glory , ’ says the Lord Almighty . 8-9 ‘ The future splendor of this Temple will be greater than the splendor of the first one ! For I have plenty of silver and gold to do it ! And here I will give peace , ’ [ b ] says the Lord. ”
TLB	Haggai	2	10	In early December , in the second year of the reign of King Darius , this message came from the Lord through Haggai the prophet :
TLB	Haggai	2	11	“ Ask the priests this question about the law :
TLB	Haggai	2	12	‘ If one of you is carrying a holy sacrifice in his robes and happens to brush against some bread or wine or meat , will it too become holy ? ’ ” “ No , ” the priests replied . “ Holiness does not pass to other things that way. ”
TLB	Haggai	2	13	Then Haggai asked , “ But if someone touches a dead person , and so becomes ceremonially impure , and then brushes against something , does it become contaminated ? ” And the priests answered , “ Yes. ”
TLB	Haggai	2	14	Haggai then made his meaning clear . “ You people , ” he said ( speaking for the Lord ) , “ were contaminating your sacrifices by living with selfish attitudes and evil hearts—and not only your sacrifices , but everything else that you did as a ‘ service ’ to me .
TLB	Haggai	2	15	And so everything you did went wrong . But all is different now because you have begun to build the Temple . 16-17 Before , when you expected a twenty-bushel crop , there were only ten . When you came to draw fifty gallons from the olive press , there were only twenty . I rewarded all your labor with rust and mildew and hail . Yet , even so , you refused to return to me , says the Lord . 18-19 “ But now note this : From today , this 24th day of the month , [ c ] as the foundation of the Lord ’ s Temple is finished , and from this day onward , I will bless you . Notice , I am giving you this promise now before you have even begun to rebuild the Temple structure , and before you have harvested your grain , and before the grapes , the figs , the pomegranates , and olives have produced their next crops : From this day I will bless you. ”
TLB	Haggai	2	20	Another message came to Haggai from the Lord that same day :
TLB	Haggai	2	21	“ Tell Zerubbabel , the governor of Judah , ‘ I am about to shake the heavens and the earth ,
TLB	Haggai	2	22	to overthrow thrones , destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations . I will overthrow their armed might , and brothers and companions will kill each other .
TLB	Haggai	2	23	But when that happens , I will take you , O Zerubbabel my servant , and honor you like a signet ring upon my finger ; for I have specially chosen you , ’ says the Lord Almighty. ” Footnotes - Haggai 2:7 the Desire of All Nations , i.e. , Christ the Messiah , literally , “ the Treasures ” or “ that which is choice. ” But many commentators prefer this rendering : “ the treasures of the nations will pour into this Temple , and I will fill it with splendor. ” - Haggai 2:8 I will give peace , i.e. , peace with God through Christ who ,
TLB	Haggai	2	500	years later , came often to this Temple . - Haggai 2:18 24th day of the month , i.e. , of Kislev , which is early in December , according to our calendar . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Zechariah	1	1	Subject : messages from the Lord . These messages from the Lord were given to Zechariah ( son of Berechiah and grandson of Iddo the prophet ) in early November of the second year of the reign of King Darius .
TLB	Zechariah	1	2	The Lord Almighty was very angry with your fathers .
TLB	Zechariah	1	3	But he will turn again and favor you if only you return to him .
TLB	Zechariah	1	4	Don ’ t be like your fathers were ! The earlier prophets pled in vain with them to turn from all their evil ways . “ Come , return to me , ” the Lord God said . But no , they wouldn ’ t listen ; they paid no attention at all . 5-6 Your fathers and their prophets are now long dead , but remember the lesson they learned , that God ’ s Word endures ! It caught up with them and punished them . Then at last they repented . “ We have gotten what we deserved from God , ” they said . “ He has done just what he warned us he would. ”
TLB	Zechariah	1	7	The following February , still in the second year of the reign of King Darius , another message from the Lord came to Zechariah ( son of Berechiah and grandson of Iddo the prophet ) , in a vision in the night :
TLB	Zechariah	1	8	I saw a Man sitting on a red horse that was standing among the myrtle trees beside a river . Behind him were other horses , red and bay and white , each with its rider . [ a ]
TLB	Zechariah	1	9	An angel stood beside me , and I asked him , “ Sir , what are all those horses for ? ” “ I ’ ll tell you , ” he replied .
TLB	Zechariah	1	10	Then the rider on the red horse—he was the Angel of the Lord—answered me , “ The Lord has sent them to patrol the earth for him. ”
TLB	Zechariah	1	11	Then the other riders reported to the Angel of the Lord , “ We have patrolled the whole earth , and everywhere there is prosperity and peace. ”
TLB	Zechariah	1	12	Upon hearing this , the Angel of the Lord prayed this prayer : “ O Lord Almighty , for seventy years your anger has raged against Jerusalem and the cities of Judah . How long will it be until you again show mercy to them ? ”
TLB	Zechariah	1	13	And the Lord answered the angel who stood beside me , speaking words of comfort and assurance .
TLB	Zechariah	1	14	Then the angel said , “ Shout out this message from the Lord Almighty : ‘ Don ’ t you think I care about what has happened to Judah and Jerusalem ? I am as jealous as a husband for his captive wife .
TLB	Zechariah	1	15	I am very angry with the heathen nations sitting around at ease , for I was only a little displeased with my people , but the nations afflicted them far beyond my intentions. ’
TLB	Zechariah	1	16	Therefore the Lord declares : ‘ I have returned to Jerusalem filled with mercy ; my Temple will be rebuilt , ’ says the Lord Almighty , ‘ and so will all Jerusalem. ’
TLB	Zechariah	1	17	Say it again : ‘ The Lord Almighty declares that the cities of Israel will again overflow with prosperity , and the Lord will again comfort Jerusalem and bless her and live in her. ’ ”
TLB	Zechariah	1	18	Then I looked and saw four animal horns !
TLB	Zechariah	1	19	“ What are these ? ” I asked the angel . He replied , “ They represent the four world powers that have scattered Judah , Israel , and Jerusalem. ”
TLB	Zechariah	1	20	Then the Lord showed me four blacksmiths .
TLB	Zechariah	1	21	“ What have these men come to do ? ” I asked . The angel replied , “ They have come to take hold of the four horns that scattered Judah so terribly , and to pound them on the anvil and throw them away. ” Footnotes - Zechariah 1:8 each with its rider , implied .

TLB	Zechariah	2	2	“ Where are you going ? ” I asked . “ To measure Jerusalem , ” he said . “ I want to see whether it is big enough for all the people ! ”
TLB	Zechariah	2	3	Then the angel who was talking to me went over to meet another angel coming toward him .
TLB	Zechariah	2	4	“ Go tell this young man , ” said the other angel , “ that Jerusalem will some day be so full of people that she won ’ t have room enough for all ! Many will live outside the city walls , with all their many cattle—and yet they will be safe .
TLB	Zechariah	2	5	For the Lord himself will be a wall of fire protecting them and all Jerusalem ; he will be the glory of the city . 6-7 “ Come , flee from the land of the north , from Babylon , ” says the Lord to all his exiles there ; “ I scattered you to the winds , but I will bring you back again . Escape , escape to Zion now ! ” says the Lord .
TLB	Zechariah	2	8	“ The Lord of Glory has sent me [ a ] against the nations that oppressed you , for he who harms you sticks his finger in Jehovah ’ s eye !
TLB	Zechariah	2	9	“ I will smash them with my fist and their slaves will be their rulers ! Then you will know it was the Lord Almighty who sent me .
TLB	Zechariah	2	10	Sing , Jerusalem , and rejoice ! For I have come to live among you , ” says the Lord . 11-12 “ At that time many nations will be converted to the Lord , and they too shall be my people ; I will live among them all . Then you will know it was the Lord Almighty who sent me to you . And Judah shall be the Lord ’ s inheritance in the Holy Land , for God shall once more choose to bless Jerusalem .
TLB	Zechariah	2	13	“ Be silent , all mankind , before the Lord , for he has come to earth from heaven , from his holy home. ” Footnotes - Zechariah 2:8 This passage evidently refers to the Messiah , here seen as one of the Godhead . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Zechariah	3	3	Joshua ’ s clothing was filthy as he stood before the Angel of the Lord .
TLB	Zechariah	3	2	And the Lord said to Satan , “ I reject your accusations , Satan ; [ a ] yes , I , the Lord , for I have decided to be merciful to Jerusalem—I rebuke you . I have decreed mercy to Joshua and his nation ; they are like a burning stick pulled out of the fire. ”
TLB	Zechariah	3	4	Then the Angel said to the others standing there , “ Remove his filthy clothing. ” And turning to Joshua he said , “ See , I have taken away your sins , and now I am giving you these fine new clothes. ” 5-6 Then I said , “ Please , could he also have a clean turban on his head ? ” So they gave him one . Then the Angel of the Lord spoke very solemnly to Joshua and said ,
TLB	Zechariah	3	7	“ The Lord Almighty declares : ‘ If you will follow the paths I set for you and do all I tell you to , then I will put you in charge of my Temple , to keep it holy ; and I will let you walk in and out of my presence with these angels .
TLB	Zechariah	3	8	Listen to me , O Joshua the High Priest , and all you other priests , you are illustrations of the good things to come . Don ’ t you see ? —Joshua represents my servant the Branch [ b ] whom I will send .
TLB	Zechariah	3	9	He will be the Foundation Stone of the Temple that Joshua is standing beside , and I will engrave this inscription on it seven times : [ c ] I will remove the sins of this land in a single day .
TLB	Zechariah	3	10	And after that , ’ the Lord Almighty declares , ‘ you will all live in peace and prosperity , and each of you will own a home of your own where you can invite your neighbors. ’ ” Footnotes - Zechariah 3:2 I reject your accusations , Satan , literally , “ The Lord rebuke you , O Satan. ” - Zechariah 3:8 the Branch , i.e. , the Messiah , Christ . - Zechariah 3:9 I will engrave this inscription on it seven times , literally , “ See the stone with seven facets I have set before Joshua , and I will engrave its inscription. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Zechariah	4	4	What is it , sir ? ” I asked . “ What does this mean ? ”
TLB	Zechariah	4	2	“ What do you see now ? ” he asked . I answered , “ I see a gold lampstand holding seven lamps , and at the top there is a reservoir for the olive oil that feeds the lamps , flowing into them through seven tubes .
TLB	Zechariah	4	3	And I see two olive trees carved upon the lampstand , one on each side of the reservoir .
TLB	Zechariah	4	5	“ Don ’ t you really know ? ” the angel asked . “ No , sir , ” I said , “ I don ’ t. ”
TLB	Zechariah	4	6	Then he said , “ This is God ’ s message to Zerubbabel : [ a ] ‘ Not by might , nor by power , but by my Spirit , says the Lord Almighty—you will succeed because of my Spirit , though you are few and weak. ’
TLB	Zechariah	4	7	Therefore no mountain , however high , can stand before Zerubbabel ! For it will flatten out before him ! And Zerubbabel will finish building this Temple [ b ] with mighty shouts of thanksgiving for God ’ s mercy , declaring that all was done by grace alone. ”
TLB	Zechariah	4	8	Another message that I received from the Lord said :
TLB	Zechariah	4	9	“ Zerubbabel laid the foundation of this Temple , and he will complete it . ( Then you will know these messages are from God , the Lord Almighty . )
TLB	Zechariah	4	10	Do not despise this small beginning , for the eyes of the Lord rejoice to see the work begin , to see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel . For these seven lamps represent the eyes of the Lord that see everywhere around the world. ”
TLB	Zechariah	4	11	Then I asked him about the two olive trees on each side of the lampstand ,
TLB	Zechariah	4	12	and about the two olive branches that emptied oil into gold bowls through two gold tubes .
TLB	Zechariah	4	13	“ Don ’ t you know ? ” he asked . “ No , sir , ” I said .
TLB	Zechariah	4	14	Then he told me , “ They represent the two anointed ones who assist the Lord of all the earth. ” Footnotes - Zechariah 4:6 to Zerubbabel , Governor of Judah , who was given the responsibility for rebuilding the Temple . See Haggai 1:1 ; 2:23 , etc . - Zechariah 4:7 Zerubbabel will finish building this Temple , literally , “ he will bring forth the capstone. ” declaring that all was done by grace alone , or “ with mighty shouts , ‘ How beautiful it is ! ’ ” or “ ‘ The Lord bless it ! ’ ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Zechariah	5	5	Then the angel left me for a while , but he returned and said , “ Look up ! Something is traveling through the sky ! ”
TLB	Zechariah	5	2	“ What do you see ? ” he asked . “ A flying scroll ! ” I replied . “ It appears to be about thirty feet long and fifteen feet wide ! ”
TLB	Zechariah	5	3	“ This scroll , ” he told me , “ represents the words of God ’ s curse going out over the entire land . It says that all who steal and lie have been judged and sentenced to death. ”
TLB	Zechariah	5	4	“ I am sending this curse into the home of every thief and everyone who swears falsely by my name , ” says the Lord Almighty . “ And my curse shall remain upon his home and completely destroy it. ”
TLB	Zechariah	5	6	“ What is it ? ” I asked . He replied , “ It is a bushel basket filled with the sin prevailing everywhere throughout the land. ”
TLB	Zechariah	5	7	Suddenly the heavy lead cover on the basket was lifted off , and I could see a woman sitting inside the basket !
TLB	Zechariah	5	8	He said , “ She represents wickedness , ” and he pushed her back into the basket and clamped down the heavy lid again .
TLB	Zechariah	5	9	Then I saw two women flying toward us , with wings like those of a stork . And they took the bushel basket and flew off with it , high in the sky .
TLB	Zechariah	5	10	“ Where are they taking her ? ” I asked the angel .
TLB	Zechariah	5	11	He replied , “ To Babylon [ a ] where they will build a temple for the basket , to worship it ! ” Footnotes - Zechariah 5:11 To Babylon ( the land of Shinar ) .

TLB	Zechariah	6	6	The chariot pulled by the black horses will go north , and the one pulled by white horses will follow it there , [ a ] while the dappled-grays will go south. ”
TLB	Zechariah	6	2	The first chariot was pulled by red horses , the second by black ones ,
TLB	Zechariah	6	3	the third by white horses and the fourth by dappled-grays .
TLB	Zechariah	6	4	“ And what are these , sir ? ” I asked the angel .
TLB	Zechariah	6	5	He replied , “ These are the four heavenly spirits who stand before the Lord of all the earth ; they are going out to do his work .
TLB	Zechariah	6	7	The red [ b ] horses were impatient to be off , to patrol back and forth across the earth , so the Lord said , “ Go . Begin your patrol. ” So they left at once .
TLB	Zechariah	6	8	Then the Lord summoned me and said , “ Those who went north have executed my judgment [ c ] and quieted my anger there. ”
TLB	Zechariah	6	9	In another message the Lord said : 10-11 “ Heldai , Tobijah , and Jedaiah will bring gifts of silver and gold from the Jews exiled in Babylon . The same day they arrive , meet them at the home of Josiah ( son of Zephaniah ) , where they will stay . Accept their gifts and make from them a crown from the silver and gold . Then put the crown on the head of Joshua ( son of Josedech ) the High Priest .
TLB	Zechariah	6	12	Tell him that the Lord Almighty says , ‘ You represent the Man who will come , whose name is “ The Branch ” —he will grow up from himself [ d ] —and will build the Temple of the Lord .
TLB	Zechariah	6	13	To him belongs the royal title . He will rule both as King and as Priest , with perfect harmony between the two ! ’
TLB	Zechariah	6	14	“ Then put the crown in the Temple of the Lord , to honor those who gave it—Heldai , Tobijah , Jedaiah , and also Josiah .
TLB	Zechariah	6	15	These three who have come from so far away represent many others who will someday come from distant lands to rebuild the Temple of the Lord . And when this happens , you will know my messages have been from God , the Lord Almighty . But none of this will happen unless you carefully obey the commandments of the Lord your God. ” Footnotes - Zechariah 6:6 will follow it there , or “ will go west. ” - Zechariah 6:7 red , implied . - Zechariah 6:8 Those who went north have executed my judgment , implied . - Zechariah 6:12 he will grow up from himself , literally , “ he will grow up in his place. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Zechariah	7	7	Long years ago , when Jerusalem was prosperous and her southern suburbs out along the plain were filled with people , the prophets warned them that this attitude would surely lead to ruin , as it has. ’ ” 8-9 Then this message from the Lord came to Zechariah . “ Tell them to be honest and fair—and not to take bribes—and to be merciful and kind to everyone .
TLB	Zechariah	7	2	The Jews of the city of Bethel had sent a group of men headed by Sharezer , the chief administrative officer of the king , and Regem-melech , to the Lord ’ s Temple at Jerusalem , to seek his blessing
TLB	Zechariah	7	3	and to speak with the priests and prophets about whether they must continue their traditional custom of fasting and mourning during the month of August each year , as they had been doing for so long .
TLB	Zechariah	7	4	This was the Lord ’ s reply :
TLB	Zechariah	7	5	“ When you return to Bethel , say to all your people and your priests , ‘ During those seventy years of exile when you fasted and mourned in August and October , were you really in earnest about leaving your sins behind and coming back to me ? No , not at all !
TLB	Zechariah	7	6	And even now in your holy feasts to God , you don ’ t think of me , but only of the food and fellowship and fun .
TLB	Zechariah	7	10	Tell them to stop oppressing widows and orphans , foreigners and poor people , and to stop plotting evil against each other .
TLB	Zechariah	7	11	Your fathers would not listen to this message . They turned stubbornly away and put their fingers in their ears to keep from hearing me .
TLB	Zechariah	7	12	They hardened their hearts like flint , afraid to hear the words that God , the Lord Almighty , commanded them—the laws he had revealed to them by his Spirit through the early prophets . That is why such great wrath came down on them from God .
TLB	Zechariah	7	13	I called , but they refused to listen , so when they cried to me , I turned away .
TLB	Zechariah	7	14	I scattered them as with a whirlwind among the far-off nations . Their land became desolate ; no one even traveled through it ; the Pleasant Land lay bare and blighted. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Zechariah	8	8	I will bring them home again to live safely in Jerusalem , and they will be my people , and I will be their God , just and true and yet forgiving them their sins ! ” [ a ]
TLB	Zechariah	8	2	The Lord Almighty says , “ I am greatly concerned—yes , furiously angry—because of all that Jerusalem ’ s enemies have done to her .
TLB	Zechariah	8	3	Now I am going to return to my land , and I , myself , will live within Jerusalem . Then Jerusalem shall be called ‘ The Faithful City , ’ and ‘ The Holy Mountain , ’ and ‘ The Mountain of the Lord Almighty. ’ ”
TLB	Zechariah	8	4	The Lord Almighty declares that Jerusalem will have peace and prosperity so long that there will once again be aged men and women hobbling through her streets on canes ,
TLB	Zechariah	8	5	and the streets will be filled with boys and girls at play .
TLB	Zechariah	8	6	The Lord says , “ This seems unbelievable to you—a remnant , small , discouraged as you are—but it is no great thing for me .
TLB	Zechariah	8	7	You can be sure that I will rescue my people from east and west , wherever they are scattered .
TLB	Zechariah	8	9	The Lord Almighty says , “ Get on with the job and finish it ! You have been listening long enough ! For since you began laying the foundation of the Temple , the prophets have been telling you about the blessings that await you when it ’ s finished .
TLB	Zechariah	8	10	Before the work began there were no jobs , no wages , no security ; if you left the city , there was no assurance you would ever return , for crime was rampant .
TLB	Zechariah	8	11	“ But it is all so different now ! ” says the Lord Almighty .
TLB	Zechariah	8	12	“ For I am sowing peace and prosperity among you . Your crops will prosper ; the grapevines will be weighted down with fruit ; the ground will be fertile , with plenty of rain ; all these blessings will be given to the people left in the land .
TLB	Zechariah	8	13	‘ May you be as poor as Judah , ’ the heathen used to say to those they cursed ! But no longer ! For now Judah is a word of blessing , not a curse . ‘ May you be as prosperous and happy as Judah is , ’ they ’ ll say . So don ’ t be afraid or discouraged ! Get on with rebuilding the Temple ! 14-15 If you do , I will certainly bless you . And don ’ t think that I might change my mind . I did what I said I would when your fathers angered me and I promised to punish them , and I won ’ t change this decision of mine to bless you .
TLB	Zechariah	8	16	Here is your part : Tell the truth . Be fair . Live at peace with everyone .
TLB	Zechariah	8	17	Don ’ t plot harm to others ; don ’ t swear that something is true when it isn ’ t ! How I hate all that sort of thing ! ” says the Lord .
TLB	Zechariah	8	18	Here is another message that came to me from the Lord Almighty :
TLB	Zechariah	8	19	“ The traditional fasts and times of mourning you have kept in July , August , October , and January [ b ] are ended . They will be changed to joyous festivals if you love truth and peace ! 20-21 People from around the world will come on pilgrimages and pour into Jerusalem from many foreign cities to attend these celebrations . People will write their friends in other cities and say , ‘ Let ’ s go to Jerusalem to ask the Lord to bless us and be merciful to us . I ’ m going ! Please come with me . Let ’ s go now ! ’
TLB	Zechariah	8	22	Yes , many people , even strong nations , will come to the Lord Almighty in Jerusalem to ask for his blessing and help .
TLB	Zechariah	8	23	In those days ten men from ten different nations will clutch at the coat sleeves of one Jew and say , ‘ Please be my friend , for I know that God is with you. ’ ” Footnotes - Zechariah 8:8 just and true and yet forgiving them their sins , literally , “ in truth and in righteousness. ” - Zechariah 8:19 July , August , October , and January , literally , “ fourth , fifth , seventh , and tenth months ” of the Hebrew calendar .

TLB	Zechariah	9	9	“ Rejoice greatly , O my people ! Shout with joy ! For look—your King is coming ! He is the Righteous One , the Victor ! Yet he is lowly , riding on a donkey ’ s colt !
TLB	Zechariah	9	2	“ Doomed is Hamath , near Damascus , and Tyre and Sidon too , shrewd though they be .
TLB	Zechariah	9	3	Though Tyre has armed herself to the hilt and become so rich that silver is like dirt to her , and fine gold like dust in the streets ,
TLB	Zechariah	9	4	yet the Lord will dispossess her and hurl her fortifications into the sea ; and she shall be set on fire and burned to the ground .
TLB	Zechariah	9	5	“ Ashkelon will see it happen and be filled with fear ; Gaza will huddle in desperation , and Ekron will shake with terror , for their hopes that Tyre would stop the enemies ’ advance will all be dashed . Gaza will be conquered , her king killed , and Ashkelon will be completely destroyed .
TLB	Zechariah	9	6	“ Foreigners will take over the city of Ashdod , the rich city of the Philistines .
TLB	Zechariah	9	7	I will yank her idolatry out of her mouth and pull from her teeth her sacrifices that she eats with blood . Everyone left will worship God and be adopted into Israel as a new clan : the Philistines of Ekron will intermarry with the Jews , just as the Jebusites did so long ago .
TLB	Zechariah	9	8	And I will surround my Temple like a guard to keep invading armies from entering Israel . I am closely watching their movements , and I will keep them away ; no foreign oppressors will again overrun my people ’ s land .
TLB	Zechariah	9	10	I will disarm all peoples of the earth , including my people in Israel , and he shall bring peace among the nations . His realm shall stretch from sea to sea , from the river to the ends of the earth . [ b ]
TLB	Zechariah	9	11	“ I have delivered you from death in a waterless pit because of the covenant I made with you , sealed with blood .
TLB	Zechariah	9	12	Come to the place of safety , all you prisoners , for there is yet hope ! I promise right now , I will repay you two mercies for each of your woes !
TLB	Zechariah	9	13	Judah , you are my bow ! Ephraim , you are my arrow ! Both of you will be my sword , like the sword of a mighty soldier brandished against the sons of Greece. ”
TLB	Zechariah	9	14	The Lord shall lead his people as they fight ! His arrows shall fly like lightning ; the Lord God shall sound the trumpet call and go out against his enemies like a whirlwind off the desert from the south .
TLB	Zechariah	9	15	He will defend his people , and they will subdue their enemies , treading them beneath their feet . They will taste victory and shout with triumph . They will slaughter their foes , leaving horrible carnage everywhere . 16-17 The Lord their God will save his people in that day , as a Shepherd caring for his sheep . They shall shine in his land as glittering jewels in a crown . How wonderful and beautiful all shall be !

TLB	Zechariah	10	10	I will bring them back from Egypt and Assyria and resettle them in Israel—in Gilead and Lebanon ; there will scarcely be room for all of them !
TLB	Zechariah	10	2	How foolish to ask the idols for anything like that ! Fortune-tellers ’ predictions are all a bunch of silly lies ; what comfort is there in promises that don ’ t come true ? Judah and Israel have been led astray and wander like lost sheep ; everyone attacks them , for they have no shepherd to protect them .
TLB	Zechariah	10	3	“ My anger burns against your ‘ shepherds ’ —your leaders—and I will punish them—these goats . For the Lord Almighty has arrived to help his flock of Judah . I will make them strong and glorious like a proud steed in battle .
TLB	Zechariah	10	4	From them will come the Cornerstone , the Peg on which all hope hangs , the Bow that wins the battle , the Ruler over all the earth . [ a ]
TLB	Zechariah	10	5	They will be mighty warriors for God , grinding their enemies ’ faces into the dust beneath their feet . The Lord is with them as they fight ; their enemy is doomed .
TLB	Zechariah	10	6	“ I will strengthen Judah , yes , and Israel too ; I will reestablish them because I love them . It will be as though I had never cast them all away , for I , the Lord their God , will hear their cries .
TLB	Zechariah	10	7	They shall be like mighty warriors . They shall be happy as with wine . Their children , too , shall see the mercies of the Lord and be glad . Their hearts shall rejoice in the Lord .
TLB	Zechariah	10	8	When I whistle to them , they ’ ll come running , for I have bought them back again . From the few that are left , their population will grow again to former size .
TLB	Zechariah	10	9	Though I have scattered them like seeds among the nations , still they will remember me and return again to God ; with all their children , they will come home again to Israel .
TLB	Zechariah	10	11	They shall pass safely through the sea of distress , [ b ] for the waves will be held back . The Nile will become dry—the rule of Assyria and Egypt over my people will end. ”

TLB	Zechariah	11	11	That was the end of the agreement . Then those who bought and sold sheep , who were watching , realized that God was telling them something through what I did .
TLB	Zechariah	11	2	Weep , O cypress trees , for all the ruined cedars ; the tallest and most beautiful of them are fallen . Cry in fear , you oaks of Bashan , as you watch the thickest forests felled .
TLB	Zechariah	11	3	Listen to the wailing of Israel ’ s leaders—all these evil shepherds—for their wealth is gone . Hear the young lions roaring—the princes are weeping , for their glorious Jordan Valley lies in ruins .
TLB	Zechariah	11	4	Then said the Lord my God to me , “ Go and take a job as shepherd of a flock being fattened for the butcher .
TLB	Zechariah	11	5	This will illustrate the way my people have been bought and slain by wicked leaders , who go unpunished . ‘ Thank God , now I am rich ! ’ say those who have betrayed them—their own shepherds have sold them without mercy .
TLB	Zechariah	11	6	And I won ’ t spare them either , ” says the Lord , “ for I will let them fall into the clutches of their own wicked leaders , and they will slay them . They shall turn the land into a wilderness , and I will not protect it from them. ”
TLB	Zechariah	11	7	So I took two shepherd ’ s staffs , naming one Grace and the other Union , and I fed the flock as I had been told to do .
TLB	Zechariah	11	8	And I got rid of their three evil shepherds in a single month . But I became impatient with these sheep—this nation—and they hated me too .
TLB	Zechariah	11	9	So I told them , “ I won ’ t be your shepherd any longer . If you die , you die ; if you are killed , I don ’ t care . Go ahead and destroy yourselves ! ”
TLB	Zechariah	11	10	And I took my staff called Grace and snapped it in two , showing that I had broken my contract to lead and protect them .
TLB	Zechariah	11	12	And I said to their leaders , “ If you like , give me my pay , whatever I am worth ; but only if you want to. ” So they counted out thirty little silver coins [ b ] as my wages .
TLB	Zechariah	11	13	And the Lord told me , “ Use it to buy a field from the pottery makers [ c ] —this magnificent sum they value you at ! ” So I took the thirty coins and threw them into the Temple for the pottery makers .
TLB	Zechariah	11	14	Then I broke my other staff , “ Union , ” to show that the bond of unity between Judah and Israel was broken .
TLB	Zechariah	11	15	Then the Lord told me to go again and get a job as a shepherd ; this time I was to act the part of a worthless , wicked shepherd .
TLB	Zechariah	11	16	And he said to me , “ This illustrates how I will give this nation a shepherd who will not care for the dying ones , nor look after the young , nor heal the broken bones , nor feed the healthy ones , nor carry the lame that can not walk ; instead , he will eat the fat ones , even tearing off their feet .
TLB	Zechariah	11	17	Woe to this worthless shepherd who doesn ’ t care for the flock . God ’ s sword will cut his arm and pierce through his right eye ; his arm will become useless and his right eye blinded. ” Footnotes - Zechariah 11:1 to judgment , implied . - Zechariah 11:12 thirty little silver coins , the price of a slave ; see Exodus 21:32 and Matthew 27:3-9 . - Zechariah 11:13 Use it to buy a field from the pottery makers , literally , “ Throw it to the pottery makers. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Zechariah	12	12	This is the fate of Israel , as pronounced by the Lord , who stretched out the heavens , laid the foundation of the earth , and formed the spirit of man within him :
TLB	Zechariah	12	2	Chronicles 35:24-25 ; literally , “ like the mourning of Hadad-rimmon in the valley of Megiddo. ” The Living Bible copyright ©
TLB	Zechariah	12	3	Jerusalem will be a heavy stone burdening the world . And though all the nations of the earth unite in an attempt to move her , they will all be crushed .
TLB	Zechariah	12	4	“ In that day , ” says the Lord , “ I will bewilder the armies drawn up against her , and make fools of them , for I will watch over the people of Judah , but blind all her enemies .
TLB	Zechariah	12	5	“ And the clans of Judah shall say to themselves , ‘ The people of Jerusalem have found strength in the Lord Almighty , their God. ’
TLB	Zechariah	12	6	“ In that day I will make the clans of Judah like a little fire that sets the forest aflame—like a burning match among the sheaves ; they will burn up all the neighboring nations right and left , while Jerusalem stands unmoved .
TLB	Zechariah	12	7	The Lord will give victory to the rest of Judah first , before Jerusalem , so that the people of Jerusalem and the royal line of David won ’ t be filled with pride at their success .
TLB	Zechariah	12	8	“ The Lord will defend the people of Jerusalem ; the weakest among them will be as mighty as King David ! And the royal line will be as God , like the Angel of the Lord who goes before them !
TLB	Zechariah	12	9	For my plan is to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem .
TLB	Zechariah	12	10	“ Then I will pour out the spirit of grace and prayer on all the people of Jerusalem . They will look on him they pierced , and mourn for him as for an only son , and grieve bitterly for him as for an oldest child who died .
TLB	Zechariah	12	11	The sorrow and mourning in Jerusalem at that time will be even greater than the grievous mourning for the godly King Josiah , [ a ] who was killed in the valley of Megiddo . 12-14 “ All of Israel will weep in profound sorrow . The whole nation will be bowed down with universal grief—king , prophet , priest , and people . Each family will go into private mourning , husbands and wives apart , to face their sorrow alone .

TLB	Zechariah	13	13	“ At that time a Fountain will be opened to the people of Israel and Jerusalem , a Fountain to cleanse them from all their sins and defilement. ”
TLB	Zechariah	13	2	million Jews perished in the Roman wars , and
TLB	Zechariah	13	3	and if anyone begins false prophecy again , his own father and mother will slay him ! ‘ You must die , ’ they will tell him , ‘ for you are prophesying lies in the name of the Lord. ’
TLB	Zechariah	13	4	“ No one will be boasting then of his prophetic gift ! No one will wear prophet ’ s clothes to try to fool the people then .
TLB	Zechariah	13	5	“ ‘ No , ’ he will say . ‘ I am not a prophet ; I am a farmer . The soil has been my livelihood from my earliest youth. ’

TLB	Zechariah	13	7	“ Awake , O sword , against my Shepherd , the man who is my associate and equal , ” says the Lord Almighty . “ Strike down the Shepherd and the sheep will scatter , but I will come back and comfort and care for the lambs .
TLB	Zechariah	13	8	Two-thirds of all the nation of Israel will be cut off and die , [ b ] but a third will be left in the land .
TLB	Zechariah	13	9	I will bring the third that remain through the fire and make them pure , as gold and silver are refined and purified by fire . They will call upon my name and I will hear them ; I will say , ‘ These are my people , ’ and they will say , ‘ The Lord is our God. ’ ” Footnotes - Zechariah 13:6 these scars on your chest and your back . Evidently self-inflicted cuts , as practiced by false prophets ; see
TLB	Zechariah	13	1	Kings 18:28 . I got into a brawl at the home of a friend , literally , “ [ These are ] wounds I received in the house of my friends. ” Some think this refers to Christ ; others believe this refers to a false prophet who is lying about the reasons for his scars . - Zechariah 13:8 Two-thirds of all the nation of Israel will be cut off and die . Something of this sort has already happened twice :

TLB	Zechariah	14	14	All Judah will be fighting at Jerusalem . [ c ] The wealth of all the neighboring nations will be confiscated—great quantities of gold and silver and fine clothing .
TLB	Zechariah	14	3	Then the Lord will go out fully armed for war , to fight against those nations .
TLB	Zechariah	14	4	That day his feet will stand upon the Mount of Olives , to the east of Jerusalem , and the Mount of Olives will split apart , making a very wide valley running from east to west , for half the mountain will move toward the north and half toward the south .
TLB	Zechariah	14	5	You will escape through that valley , for it will reach across to the city gate . [ a ] Yes , you will escape as your people did long centuries ago from the earthquake in the days of Uzziah , king of Judah , and the Lord my God shall come , and all his saints and angels with him .
TLB	Zechariah	14	6	The sun and moon and stars will no longer shine , [ b ]
TLB	Zechariah	14	7	yet there will be continuous day ! Only the Lord knows how ! There will be no normal day and night—at evening time it will still be light .
TLB	Zechariah	14	8	Life-giving waters will flow out from Jerusalem , half toward the Dead Sea and half toward the Mediterranean , flowing continuously both in winter and in summer .
TLB	Zechariah	14	9	And the Lord shall be King over all the earth . In that day there shall be one Lord—his name alone will be worshiped .
TLB	Zechariah	14	10	All the land from Geba ( the northern border of Judah ) to Rimmon ( the southern border ) will become one vast plain , but Jerusalem will be on an elevated site , covering the area all the way from the Gate of Benjamin over to the site of the old gate , then to the Corner Gate , and from the Tower of Hananel to the king ’ s winepresses .
TLB	Zechariah	14	11	And Jerusalem shall be inhabited , safe at last , never again to be cursed and destroyed .
TLB	Zechariah	14	12	And the Lord will send a plague on all the people who fought Jerusalem . They will become like walking corpses , their flesh rotting away ; their eyes will shrivel in their sockets , and their tongues will decay in their mouths .
TLB	Zechariah	14	13	They will be seized with terror , panic-stricken from the Lord , and will fight against each other in hand-to-hand combat .
TLB	Zechariah	14	15	( This same plague will strike the horses , mules , camels , donkeys , and all the other animals in the enemy camp . )
TLB	Zechariah	14	16	In the end , those who survive the plague will go up to Jerusalem each year to worship the King , the Lord Almighty , to celebrate a time of thanksgiving . [ d ]
TLB	Zechariah	14	17	And any nation anywhere in all the world that refuses to come to Jerusalem to worship the King , the Lord Almighty , will have no rain .
TLB	Zechariah	14	18	But if Egypt refuses to come , God will punish her with some other plague .
TLB	Zechariah	14	19	And so Egypt and the other nations will all be punished if they refuse to come .
TLB	Zechariah	14	20	In that day the bells on the horses will have written on them , “ These Are Holy Property ” ; [ e ] and the trash cans in the Temple of the Lord will be as sacred as the bowls beside the altar .
TLB	Zechariah	14	21	In fact , every container in Jerusalem and Judah shall be sacred to the Lord Almighty ; all who come to worship may use any of them free of charge to boil their sacrifices in ; there will be no more grasping traders in the Temple of the Lord Almighty ! Footnotes - Zechariah 14:5 for it will reach across to the city gate , literally , “ for the valley of my mountain shall touch Azel ” —apparently a hamlet on the eastern outskirts of Jerusalem . all his saints and angels , literally , “ his holy ones. ” - Zechariah 14:6 The sun and moon and stars will no longer shine .

TLB	Malachi	1	1	Here is the Lord ’ s message to Israel , given through the prophet Malachi : 2-3 “ I have loved you very deeply , ” says the Lord . But you retort , “ Really ? When was this ? ” And the Lord replies , “ I showed my love for you by loving your father , Jacob . I didn ’ t need to . I even rejected his very own brother , Esau , and destroyed Esau ’ s mountains and inheritance , to give it to the jackals of the desert .
TLB	Malachi	1	4	And if his descendants should say , ‘ We will rebuild the ruins , ’ then the Lord Almighty will say , ‘ Try to if you like , but I will destroy it again , ’ for their country is named ‘ The Land of Wickedness , ’ and their people are called ‘ Those Whom God Does Not Forgive. ’ ”
TLB	Malachi	1	5	O Israel , lift your eyes to see what God is doing all around the world ; then you will say , “ Truly , the Lord ’ s great power goes far beyond our borders ! ”
TLB	Malachi	1	6	“ A son honors his father , a servant honors his master . I am your Father and Master , yet you don ’ t honor me , O priests , but you despise my name. ” “ Who ? Us ? ” you say . “ When did we ever despise your name ? ”
TLB	Malachi	1	7	“ When you offer polluted sacrifices on my altar. ” “ Polluted sacrifices ? When have we ever done a thing like that ? ” “ Every time you say , ‘ Don ’ t bother bringing anything very valuable to offer to God ! ’
TLB	Malachi	1	8	You tell the people , ‘ Lame animals are all right to offer on the altar of the Lord—yes , even the sick and the blind ones. ’ And you claim this isn ’ t evil ? Try it on your governor sometime—give him gifts like that—and see how pleased he is !
TLB	Malachi	1	9	“ ‘ God have mercy on us , ’ you recite ; ‘ God be gracious to us ! ’ But when you bring that kind of gift , why should he show you any favor at all ?
TLB	Malachi	1	10	“ Oh , to find one priest among you who would shut the doors and refuse this kind of sacrifice ! I have no pleasure in you , ” says the Lord Almighty , “ and I will not accept your offerings .
TLB	Malachi	1	11	“ But my name will be honored by the Gentiles from morning till night . All around the world they will offer sweet incense and pure offerings in honor of my name . For my name shall be great among the nations , ” says the Lord Almighty .
TLB	Malachi	1	12	“ But you dishonor it , saying that my altar is not important and encouraging people to bring cheap , sick animals to offer to me on it .
TLB	Malachi	1	13	“ You say , ‘ Oh , it ’ s too difficult to serve the Lord and do what he asks. ’ And you turn up your noses at the rules he has given you to obey . Think of it ! Stolen animals , lame and sick—as offerings to God ! Should I accept such offerings as these ? ” asks the Lord .
TLB	Malachi	1	14	“ Cursed is that man who promises a fine ram from his flock and substitutes a sick one to sacrifice to God . For I am a Great King , ” says the Lord Almighty , “ and my name is to be mightily revered among the Gentiles. ” The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Malachi	2	2	1-2 Listen , you priests , to this warning from the Lord Almighty : “ If you don ’ t change your ways and give glory to my name , then I will send terrible punishment upon you , and instead of giving you blessings as I would like to , I will turn on you with curses . Indeed , I have cursed you already because you haven ’ t taken seriously the things that are most important to me .
TLB	Malachi	2	3	“ Take note that I will rebuke your children ; I will spread on your faces the manure of these animals you offer me and throw you out like dung .
TLB	Malachi	2	4	Then at last you will know it was I who sent you this warning to return to the laws I gave your father Levi , ” says the Lord Almighty .
TLB	Malachi	2	5	“ The purpose of these laws was to give him life and peace , to be a means of showing his respect and awe for me by keeping them .
TLB	Malachi	2	6	He passed on to the people all the truth he got from me . He did not lie or cheat ; he walked with me , living a good and righteous life , and turned many from their lives of sin .
TLB	Malachi	2	7	“ Priests ’ lips should flow with the knowledge of God so the people will learn God ’ s laws . The priests are the messengers of the Lord Almighty , and men should come to them for guidance .
TLB	Malachi	2	8	But not to you ! For you have left God ’ s paths . Your ‘ guidance ’ has caused many to stumble in sin . You have distorted the covenant of Levi and made it into a grotesque parody , ” says the Lord Almighty .
TLB	Malachi	2	9	“ Therefore , I have made you contemptible in the eyes of all the people ; for you have not obeyed me , but you let your favorites break the law without rebuke. ”
TLB	Malachi	2	10	We are children of the same father , Abraham , all created by the same God . And yet we are faithless to each other , violating the covenant of our fathers !
TLB	Malachi	2	11	In Judah , in Israel , and in Jerusalem , there is treachery , for the men of Judah have defiled God ’ s holy and beloved Temple by marrying heathen women who worship idols .
TLB	Malachi	2	12	May the Lord cut off from his covenant every last man , whether priest or layman , who has done this thing !
TLB	Malachi	2	13	Yet you cover the altar with your tears because the Lord doesn ’ t pay attention to your offerings anymore , and you receive no blessing from him .
TLB	Malachi	2	14	“ Why has God abandoned us ? ” you cry . I ’ ll tell you why ; it is because the Lord has seen your treachery in divorcing your wives who have been faithful to you through the years , the companions you promised to care for and keep .
TLB	Malachi	2	15	You were united to your wife by the Lord . In God ’ s wise plan , when you married , the two of you became one person in his sight . And what does he want ? Godly children from your union . Therefore , guard your passions ! Keep faith with the wife of your youth .
TLB	Malachi	2	16	For the Lord , the God of Israel , says he hates divorce and cruel men . Therefore , control your passions—let there be no divorcing of your wives .
TLB	Malachi	2	17	You have wearied the Lord with your words . “ Wearied him ? ” you ask in fake surprise . “ How have we wearied him ? ” By saying that evil is good , that it pleases the Lord ! Or by saying that God won ’ t punish us—he doesn ’ t care . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Malachi	3	3	Like a refiner of silver he will sit and closely watch as the dross is burned away . He will purify the Levites , the ministers of God , refining them like gold or silver , so that they will do their work for God with pure hearts .
TLB	Malachi	3	2	“ But who can live when he appears ? Who can endure his coming ? For he is like a blazing fire refining precious metal , and he can bleach the dirtiest garments !
TLB	Malachi	3	4	Then once more the Lord will enjoy the offerings brought to him by the people of Judah and Jerusalem , as he did before .
TLB	Malachi	3	5	At that time my punishments will be quick and certain ; I will move swiftly against wicked men who trick the innocent , against adulterers and liars , against all those who cheat their hired hands , who oppress widows and orphans , or defraud strangers , and do not fear me , ” says the Lord Almighty .
TLB	Malachi	3	6	“ For I am the Lord—I do not change . That is why you are not already utterly destroyed , for my mercy endures forever . [ b ]
TLB	Malachi	3	7	“ Though you have scorned my laws from earliest time , yet you may still return to me , ” says the Lord Almighty . “ Come and I will forgive you . “ But you say , ‘ We have never even gone away ! ’
TLB	Malachi	3	8	“ Will a man rob God ? Surely not ! And yet you have robbed me . “ ‘ What do you mean ? When did we ever rob you ? ’ “ You have robbed me of the tithes and offerings due me .
TLB	Malachi	3	9	And so the awesome curse of God is cursing you , for your whole nation has been robbing me .
TLB	Malachi	3	10	Bring all the tithes into the storehouse so that there will be food enough in my Temple ; if you do , I will open up the windows of heaven for you and pour out a blessing so great you won ’ t have room enough to take it in ! “ Try it ! Let me prove it to you !
TLB	Malachi	3	11	Your crops will be large , for I will guard them from insects and plagues . Your grapes won ’ t shrivel away before they ripen , ” says the Lord Almighty .
TLB	Malachi	3	12	“ And all nations will call you blessed , for you will be a land sparkling with happiness . These are the promises of the Lord Almighty .
TLB	Malachi	3	13	“ Your attitude toward me has been proud and arrogant , ” says the Lord . “ But you say , ‘ What do you mean ? What have we said that we shouldn ’ t ? ’ 14-15 “ Listen ; you have said , ‘ It is foolish to worship God and obey him . What good does it do to obey his laws , and to sorrow and mourn for our sins ? From now on , as far as we ’ re concerned , “ Blessed are the arrogant. ” For those who do evil shall prosper , and those who dare God to punish them shall get off scot-free. ’ ”
TLB	Malachi	3	16	Then those who feared and loved the Lord spoke often of him to each other . And he had a Book of Remembrance drawn up in which he recorded the names of those who feared him and loved to think about him .
TLB	Malachi	3	17	“ They shall be mine , ” says the Lord Almighty , “ in that day when I make up my jewels . And I will spare them as a man spares an obedient and dutiful son .
TLB	Malachi	3	18	Then you will see the difference between God ’ s treatment of good men and bad , between those who serve him and those who don ’ t . Footnotes - Malachi 3:1 the One , literally , “ the Lord. ” - Malachi 3:6 for my mercy endures forever , implied . The Living Bible copyright ©

TLB	Malachi	4	3	Then you will tread upon the wicked as ashes underfoot , ” says the Lord Almighty .
TLB	Malachi	4	5	“ See , I will send you another prophet like Elijah [ a ] before the coming of the great and dreadful judgment day of God .
TLB	Malachi	4	6	His preaching will bring fathers and children together again , to be of one mind and heart , for they will know that if they do not repent , I will come and utterly destroy their land. ” Footnotes - Malachi 4:5 another prophet like Elijah , literally , “ the prophet Elijah. ” Compare Matthew 17:10-12 and Luke 1:17 .
