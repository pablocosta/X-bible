ASV	Matthew	1	19	And Joseph her husband , being a righteous man , and not willing to make her a public example , was minded to put her away privily .
ASV	Matthew	1	20	But when he thought on these things , behold , an angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream , saying , Joseph , thou son of David , fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife : for that which is [ q ] conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit .
ASV	Matthew	1	21	And she shall bring forth a son ; and thou shalt call his name Jesus ; for it is he that shall save his people from their sins .
ASV	Matthew	1	22	Now all this is come to pass , that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet , saying ,
ASV	Matthew	1	23	[ r ] Behold , the virgin shall be with child , and shall bring forth a son , And they shall call his name [ s ] Immanuel ; which is , being interpreted , God with us .
ASV	Matthew	1	24	And Joseph arose from his sleep , and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him , and took unto him his wife ;
ASV	Matthew	1	25	and knew her not till she had brought forth a son : and he called his name Jesus . Footnotes - Matthew 1:1 Or , The genealogy of Jesus Christ - Matthew 1:1 Or , birth : as in verse
ASV	Matthew	2	2	[ b ] Where is he that is born King of the Jews ? for we saw his star in the east , and are come to [ c ] worship him .
ASV	Matthew	2	3	And when Herod the king heard it , he was troubled , and all Jerusalem with him .
ASV	Matthew	2	4	And gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people , he inquired of them where the Christ should be born .
ASV	Matthew	2	5	And they said unto him , In Bethlehem of Judaea : for thus it is written through the prophet ,
ASV	Matthew	2	6	[ d ] And thou Bethlehem , land of Judah , Art in no wise least among the princes of Judah : For out of thee shall come forth a governor , Who shall be shepherd of my people Israel .
ASV	Matthew	2	7	Then Herod privily called the [ e ] Wise-men , and learned of them exactly [ f ] what time the star appeared .
ASV	Matthew	2	8	. - Matthew 2:18 Jer . 31:15 . - Matthew 2:23 Isa . 11:1 in the Hebrew ?
ASV	Matthew	2	9	And they , having heard the king , went their way ; and lo , the star , which they saw in the east , went before them , till it came and stood over where the young child was .
ASV	Matthew	2	10	And when they saw the star , they rejoiced with exceeding great joy .
ASV	Matthew	2	11	And they came into the house and saw the young child with Mary his mother ; and they fell down and worshipped him ; and opening their treasures they offered unto him gifts , gold and frankincense and myrrh .
ASV	Matthew	2	12	And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod , they departed into their own country another way .
ASV	Matthew	2	13	Now when they were departed , behold , an angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream , saying , Arise and take the young child and his mother , and flee into Egypt , and be thou there until I tell thee : for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him .
ASV	Matthew	2	14	And he arose and took the young child and his mother by night , and departed into Egypt ;
ASV	Matthew	2	15	and was there until the death of Herod : that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet , saying , [ h ] Out of Egypt did I call my son .
ASV	Matthew	2	16	Then Herod , when he saw that he was mocked of the [ i ] Wise-men , was exceeding wroth , and sent forth , and slew all the male children that were in Bethlehem , and in all the borders thereof , from two years old and under , according to the time which he had exactly learned of the [ j ] Wise-men .
ASV	Matthew	2	17	Then was fulfilled that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet , saying ,
ASV	Matthew	2	18	[ k ] A voice was heard in Ramah , Weeping and great mourning , Rachel weeping for her children ; And she would not be comforted , because they are not .
ASV	Matthew	2	19	But when Herod was dead , behold , an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt , saying ,
ASV	Matthew	2	20	Arise and take the young child and his mother , and go into the land of Israel : for they are dead that sought the young child ’ s life .
ASV	Matthew	2	21	And he arose and took the young child and his mother , and came into the land of Israel .
ASV	Matthew	2	22	But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judaea in the room of his father Herod , he was afraid to go thither ; and being warned of God in a dream , he withdrew into the parts of Galilee ,

ASV	Matthew	3	4	Now John himself had his raiment of camel ’ s hair , and a leathern girdle about his loins ; and his food was locusts and wild honey .
ASV	Matthew	3	5	Then went out unto him Jerusalem , and all Judaea , and all the region round about the Jordan ;
ASV	Matthew	3	6	and they were baptized of him in the river Jordan , confessing their sins .
ASV	Matthew	3	7	But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming [ b ] to his baptism , he said unto them , Ye offspring of vipers , who warned you to flee from the wrath to come ?
ASV	Matthew	3	8	Bring forth therefore fruit worthy of [ c ] repentance :
ASV	Matthew	3	9	and think not to say within yourselves , We have Abraham to our father : for I say unto you , that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham .
ASV	Matthew	3	10	And even now the axe lieth at the root of the trees : every tree therefore that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down , and cast into the fire .
ASV	Matthew	3	11	I indeed baptize you [ d ] in water unto repentance : but he that cometh after me is mightier than I , whose shoes I am not [ e ] worthy to bear : he shall baptize you [ f ] in the Holy Spirit and in fire :
ASV	Matthew	3	12	whose fan is in his hand , and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing-floor ; and he will gather his wheat into the garner , but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire .
ASV	Matthew	3	13	Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to the Jordan unto John , to be baptized of him .
ASV	Matthew	3	14	But John would have hindered him , saying , I have need to be baptized of thee , and comest thou to me ?
ASV	Matthew	3	15	But Jesus answering said unto him , Suffer [ g ] it now : for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness . Then he suffereth him .
ASV	Matthew	3	16	And Jesus , when he was baptized , went up straightway from the water : and lo , the heavens were opened [ h ] unto him , and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove , and coming upon him ;
ASV	Matthew	3	17	and lo , a voice out of the heavens , saying , [ i ] This is my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased .

ASV	Matthew	4	3	And the tempter came and said unto him , If thou art the Son of God , command that these stones become [ a ] bread .
ASV	Matthew	4	5	Then the devil taketh him into the holy city ; and he set him on the [ c ] pinnacle of the temple ,
ASV	Matthew	4	6	and saith unto him , If thou art the Son of God , cast thyself down : for it is written , [ d ] He shall give his angels charge concerning thee : and , On their hands they shall bear thee up , Lest haply thou dash thy foot against a stone .
ASV	Matthew	4	7	Jesus said unto him , Again it is written , [ e ] Thou shalt not make trial of the Lord thy God .
ASV	Matthew	4	8	Again , the devil taketh him unto an exceeding high mountain , and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world , and the glory of them ;
ASV	Matthew	4	9	and he said unto him , All these things will I give thee , if thou wilt fall down and [ f ] worship me .
ASV	Matthew	4	10	Then saith Jesus unto him , Get thee hence , Satan : for it is written , [ g ] Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God , and him only shalt thou serve .
ASV	Matthew	4	11	Then the devil leaveth him ; and behold , angels came and ministered unto him .

ASV	Matthew	4	13	and leaving Nazareth , he came and dwelt in Capernaum , which is by the sea , in the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali :
ASV	Matthew	4	14	that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet , saying ,
ASV	Matthew	4	15	[ h ] The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali , [ i ] Toward the sea , beyond the Jordan , Galilee of the [ j ] Gentiles ,
ASV	Matthew	4	16	The people that sat in darkness Saw a great light , And to them that sat in the region and shadow of death , To them did light spring up .
ASV	Matthew	4	17	From that time began Jesus to preach , and to say , Repent ye ; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand .
ASV	Matthew	4	18	And walking by the sea of Galilee , he saw two brethren , Simon who is called Peter , and Andrew his brother , casting a net into the sea ; for they were fishers .
ASV	Matthew	4	19	And he saith unto them , Come ye after me , and I will make you fishers of men .
ASV	Matthew	4	20	And they straightway left the nets , and followed him .
ASV	Matthew	4	21	And going on from thence he saw two other brethren , [ k ] James the son of Zebedee , and John his brother , in the boat with Zebedee their father , mending their nets ; and he called them .
ASV	Matthew	4	22	And they straightway left the boat and their father , and followed him .
ASV	Matthew	4	23	And [ l ] Jesus went about in all Galilee , teaching in their synagogues , and preaching the [ m ] gospel of the kingdom , and healing all manner of disease and all manner of sickness among the people .
ASV	Matthew	4	24	And the report of him went forth into all Syria : and they brought unto him all that were sick , holden with divers diseases and torments , [ n ] possessed with demons , and epileptic , and palsied ; and he healed them .
ASV	Matthew	4	25	And there followed him great multitudes from Galilee and Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judaea and from beyond the Jordan . Footnotes - Matthew 4:3 Greek loaves . - Matthew 4:4 Dt . 8:3 . - Matthew 4:5 Greek wing . - Matthew 4:6 Ps . 91:11 ,

ASV	Matthew	5	4	and
ASV	Matthew	5	6	Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness : for they shall be filled .

ASV	Matthew	5	11	Blessed are ye when men shall reproach you , and persecute you , and say all manner of evil against you falsely , for my sake .
ASV	Matthew	5	12	Rejoice , and be exceeding glad : for great is your reward in heaven : for so persecuted they the prophets that were before you .
ASV	Matthew	5	13	Ye are the salt of the earth : but if the salt have lost its savor , wherewith shall it be salted ? it is thenceforth good for nothing , but to be cast out and trodden under foot of men .
ASV	Matthew	5	14	Ye are the light of the world . A city set on a hill can not be hid .
ASV	Matthew	5	15	Neither do men light a lamp , and put it under the bushel , but on the stand ; and it shineth unto all that are in the house .
ASV	Matthew	5	16	Even so let your light shine before men ; that they may see your good works , and glorify your Father who is in heaven .
ASV	Matthew	5	17	Think not that I came to destroy the law or the prophets : I came not to destroy , but to fulfil .
ASV	Matthew	5	18	For verily I say unto you , Till heaven and earth pass away , one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass away from the law , till all things be accomplished .
ASV	Matthew	5	19	Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments , and shall teach men so , shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven : but whosoever shall do and teach them , he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven .
ASV	Matthew	5	20	For I say unto you , that except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees , ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven .
ASV	Matthew	5	21	Ye have heard that it was said to them of old time , [ b ] Thou shalt not kill ; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment :
ASV	Matthew	5	22	but I say unto you , that every one who is angry with his brother [ c ] shall be in danger of the judgment ; and whosoever shall say to his brother , [ d ] Raca , shall be in danger of the council ; and whosoever shall say , [ e ] Thou fool , shall be in danger [ f ] of the [ g ] hell of fire .
ASV	Matthew	5	23	If therefore thou art offering thy gift at the altar , and there rememberest that thy brother hath aught against thee ,
ASV	Matthew	5	24	leave there thy gift before the altar , and go thy way , first be reconciled to thy brother , and then come and offer thy gift .
ASV	Matthew	5	25	Agree with thine adversary quickly , while thou art with him in the way ; lest haply the adversary [ h ] deliver thee to the judge , and the judge deliver thee to the officer , and thou be cast into prison .
ASV	Matthew	5	26	Verily I say unto thee , Thou shalt by no means come out thence , till thou have paid the last farthing .
ASV	Matthew	5	27	Ye have heard that it was said , [ i ] Thou shalt not commit adultery :
ASV	Matthew	5	28	but I say unto you , that every one that looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart .
ASV	Matthew	5	29	And if thy right eye causeth thee to stumble , pluck it out , and cast it from thee : for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish , and not thy whole body be cast into [ j ] hell .
ASV	Matthew	5	30	And if thy right hand causeth thee to stumble , cut it off , and cast it from thee : for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish , and not thy whole body go into [ k ] hell .
ASV	Matthew	5	31	It was said also , [ l ] Whosoever shall put away his wife , let him give her a writing of divorcement :
ASV	Matthew	5	32	but I say unto you , that every one that putteth away his wife , saving for the cause of fornication , maketh her an adulteress : and whosoever shall marry her when she is put away committeth adultery .
ASV	Matthew	5	33	Again , ye have heard that it was said to them of old time , [ m ] Thou shalt not forswear thyself , but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths :
ASV	Matthew	5	34	but I say unto you , Swear not at all ; neither by the heaven , for it is the throne of God ;
ASV	Matthew	5	35	nor by the earth , for it is the footstool of his feet ; nor [ n ] by Jerusalem , for it is the city of the great King .
ASV	Matthew	5	36	Neither shalt thou swear by thy head , for thou canst not make one hair white or black .
ASV	Matthew	5	37	[ o ] But let your speech be , Yea , yea ; Nay , nay : and whatsoever is more than these is of [ p ] the evil one .
ASV	Matthew	5	38	Ye have heard that it was said , An [ q ] eye for an eye , and a tooth for a tooth :

ASV	Matthew	5	40	And if any man would go to law with thee , and take away thy coat , let him have thy cloak also .
ASV	Matthew	5	41	And whosoever shall [ s ] compel thee to go one mile , go with him two .
ASV	Matthew	5	42	Give to him that asketh thee , and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away .
ASV	Matthew	5	43	Ye have heard that it was said , [ t ] Thou shalt love thy neighbor , and hate thine enemy :
ASV	Matthew	5	44	but I say unto you , Love your enemies , and pray for them that persecute you ;
ASV	Matthew	5	45	that ye may be sons of your Father who is in heaven : for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and the good , and sendeth rain on the just and the unjust .
ASV	Matthew	5	46	For if ye love them that love you , what reward have ye ? do not even the [ u ] publicans the same ?
ASV	Matthew	5	47	And if ye salute your brethren only , what do ye more than others ? do not even the Gentiles the same ?
ASV	Matthew	5	48	Ye therefore shall be perfect , as your heavenly Father is perfect . Footnotes - Matthew 5:4 Some ancient authorities transpose verses
ASV	Matthew	6	6	But thou , when thou prayest , enter into thine inner chamber , and having shut thy door , pray to thy Father who is in secret , and thy Father who seeth in secret shall recompense thee .
ASV	Matthew	6	2	When therefore thou doest alms , sound not a trumpet before thee , as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets , that they may have glory of men . Verily I say unto you , They have received their reward .
ASV	Matthew	6	3	But when thou doest alms , let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth :
ASV	Matthew	6	4	that thine alms may be in secret : and thy Father who seeth in secret shall recompense thee .
ASV	Matthew	6	5	And when ye pray , ye shall not be as the hypocrites : for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets , that they may be seen of men . Verily I say unto you , They have received their reward .
ASV	Matthew	6	7	And in praying use not vain repetitions , as the Gentiles do : for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking .
ASV	Matthew	6	8	Be not therefore like unto them : for [ a ] your Father knoweth what things ye have need of , before ye ask him .
ASV	Matthew	6	9	After this manner therefore pray ye : Our Father who art in heaven , Hallowed be thy name .
ASV	Matthew	6	10	Thy kingdom come . Thy will be done , as in heaven , so on earth .
ASV	Matthew	6	11	Give us this day [ b ] our daily bread .
ASV	Matthew	6	12	And forgive us our debts , as we also have forgiven our debtors .
ASV	Matthew	6	13	And bring us not into temptation , but deliver us from [ c ] the evil one . [ d ]
ASV	Matthew	6	14	For if ye forgive men their trespasses , your heavenly Father will also forgive you .
ASV	Matthew	6	15	But if ye forgive not men their trespasses , neither will your Father forgive your trespasses .
ASV	Matthew	6	16	Moreover when ye fast , be not , as the hypocrites , of a sad countenance : for they disfigure their faces , that they may be seen of men to fast . Verily I say unto you , They have received their reward .
ASV	Matthew	6	17	But thou , when thou fastest , anoint thy head , and wash thy face ;
ASV	Matthew	6	18	that thou be not seen of men to fast , but of thy Father who is in secret : and thy Father , who seeth in secret , shall recompense thee .
ASV	Matthew	6	19	Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon the earth , where moth and rust consume , and where thieves break through and steal :
ASV	Matthew	6	20	but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven , where neither moth nor rust doth consume , and where thieves do not [ e ] break through nor steal :
ASV	Matthew	6	21	for where thy treasure is , there will thy heart be also .
ASV	Matthew	6	22	The lamp of the body is the eye : if therefore thine eye be single , thy whole body shall be full of light .
ASV	Matthew	6	23	But if thine eye be evil , thy whole body shall be full of darkness . If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness , how great is the darkness !
ASV	Matthew	6	24	No man can serve two masters : for either he will hate the one , and love the other ; or else he will hold to one , and despise the other . Ye can not serve God and mammon .
ASV	Matthew	6	25	Therefore I say unto you , Be not anxious for your life , what ye shall eat , or what ye shall drink ; nor yet for your body , what ye shall put on . Is not the life more than the food , and the body than the raiment ?
ASV	Matthew	6	26	Behold the birds of the heaven , that they sow not , neither do they reap , nor gather into barns ; and your heavenly Father feedeth them . Are not ye of much more value than they ?
ASV	Matthew	6	27	And which of you by being anxious can add one cubit unto [ f ] the measure of his life ?
ASV	Matthew	6	28	And why are ye anxious concerning raiment ? Consider the lilies of the field , how they grow ; they toil not , neither do they spin :
ASV	Matthew	6	29	yet I say unto you , that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these .
ASV	Matthew	6	30	But if God doth so clothe the grass of the field , which to-day is , and to-morrow is cast into the oven , shall he not much more clothe you , O ye of little faith ?
ASV	Matthew	6	31	Be not therefore anxious , saying , What shall we eat ? or , What shall we drink ? or , Wherewithal shall we be clothed ?
ASV	Matthew	6	32	For after all these things do the Gentiles seek ; for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things .
ASV	Matthew	6	33	But seek ye first his kingdom , and his righteousness ; and all these things shall be added unto you .
ASV	Matthew	6	34	Be not therefore anxious for the morrow : for the morrow will be anxious for itself . Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof .

Amen . - Matthew 6:20 Greek dig through . - Matthew 6:27 Or , his stature
ASV	Matthew	7	7	Ask , and it shall be given you ; seek , and ye shall find ; knock , and it shall be opened unto you :
ASV	Matthew	7	2	For with what judgment ye judge , ye shall be judged : and with what measure ye mete , it shall be measured unto you .
ASV	Matthew	7	3	And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother ’ s eye , but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye ?
ASV	Matthew	7	4	Or how wilt thou say to thy brother , Let me cast out the mote out of thine eye ; and lo , the beam is in thine own eye ?
ASV	Matthew	7	5	Thou hypocrite , cast out first the beam out of thine own eye ; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother ’ s eye .
ASV	Matthew	7	6	Give not that which is holy unto the dogs , neither cast your pearls before the swine , lest haply they trample them under their feet , and turn and rend you .
ASV	Matthew	7	8	for every one that asketh receiveth ; and he that seeketh findeth ; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened .
ASV	Matthew	7	9	Or what man is there of you , who , if his son shall ask him for a loaf , will give him a stone ;
ASV	Matthew	7	10	or if he shall ask for a fish , will give him a serpent ?
ASV	Matthew	7	11	If ye then , being evil , know how to give good gifts unto your children , how much more shall your Father who is in heaven give good things to them that ask him ?
ASV	Matthew	7	12	All things therefore whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you , even so do ye also unto them : for this is the law and the prophets .
ASV	Matthew	7	13	Enter ye in by the narrow gate : for wide [ a ] is the gate , and broad is the way , that leadeth to destruction , and many are they that enter in thereby .
ASV	Matthew	7	14	[ b ] For narrow is the gate , and straitened the way , that leadeth unto life , and few are they that find it .
ASV	Matthew	7	15	Beware of false prophets , who come to you in sheep ’ s clothing , but inwardly are ravening wolves .
ASV	Matthew	7	16	By their fruits ye shall know them . Do men gather grapes of thorns , or figs of thistles ?
ASV	Matthew	7	17	Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit ; but the corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit .
ASV	Matthew	7	18	A good tree can not bring forth evil fruit , neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit .
ASV	Matthew	7	19	Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down , and cast into the fire .
ASV	Matthew	7	20	Therefore by their fruits ye shall know them .
ASV	Matthew	7	21	Not every one that saith unto me , Lord , Lord , shall enter into the kingdom of heaven ; but he that doeth the will of my Father who is in heaven .
ASV	Matthew	7	22	Many will say to me in that day , Lord , Lord , did we not prophesy by thy name , and by thy name cast out demons , and by thy name do many [ c ] mighty works ?
ASV	Matthew	7	23	And then will I profess unto them , I never knew you : depart from me , ye that work iniquity .
ASV	Matthew	7	24	Every one therefore that heareth these words of mine , and doeth them , shall be likened unto a wise man , who built his house upon the rock :
ASV	Matthew	7	25	and the rain descended , and the floods came , and the winds blew , and beat upon that house ; and it fell not : for it was founded upon the rock .
ASV	Matthew	7	26	And every one that heareth these words of mine , and doeth them not , shall be likened unto a foolish man , who built his house upon the sand :
ASV	Matthew	7	27	and the rain descended , and the floods came , and the winds blew , and smote upon that house ; and it fell : and great was the fall thereof .
ASV	Matthew	7	28	And it came to pass , when Jesus had finished these words , the multitudes were astonished at his teaching :
ASV	Matthew	7	29	for he taught them as one having authority , and not as their scribes . Footnotes - Matthew 7:13 Some ancient authorities omit is the gate . - Matthew 7:14 Many ancient authorities read How narrow is the gate , etc . - Matthew 7:22 Greek powers .
ASV	Matthew	8	8	And the centurion answered and said , Lord , I am not [ d ] worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof ; but only say [ e ] the word , and my [ f ] servant shall be healed .
ASV	Matthew	8	2	And behold , there came to him a leper and [ a ] worshipped him , saying , Lord , if thou wilt , thou canst make me clean .
ASV	Matthew	8	3	And he stretched forth his hand , and touched him , saying , I will ; be thou made clean . And straightway his leprosy was cleansed .
ASV	Matthew	8	4	And Jesus saith unto him , [ b ] See thou tell no man ; but go , show thyself to the priest , and offer the gift that Moses commanded , for a testimony unto them .
ASV	Matthew	8	5	And when he was entered into Capernaum , there came unto him a centurion , beseeching him ,
ASV	Matthew	8	6	and saying , Lord , my [ c ] servant lieth in the house sick of the palsy , grievously tormented .
ASV	Matthew	8	7	And he saith unto him , I will come and heal him .
ASV	Matthew	8	9	For I also am a man [ g ] under authority , having under myself soldiers : and I say to this one , Go , and he goeth ; and to another , Come , and he cometh ; and to my [ h ] servant , Do this , and he doeth it .
ASV	Matthew	8	10	And when Jesus heard it , he marvelled , and said to them that followed , Verily I say unto you , [ i ] I have not found so great faith , no , not in Israel .
ASV	Matthew	8	11	And I say unto you , that many shall come from the east and the west , and shall [ j ] sit down with Abraham , and Isaac , and Jacob , in the kingdom of heaven :
ASV	Matthew	8	12	but the sons of the kingdom shall be cast forth into the outer darkness : there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth .
ASV	Matthew	8	13	And Jesus said unto the centurion , Go thy way ; as thou hast believed , so be it done unto thee . And the [ k ] servant was healed in that hour .
ASV	Matthew	8	14	And when Jesus was come into Peter ’ s house , he saw his wife ’ s mother lying sick of a fever .
ASV	Matthew	8	15	And he touched her hand , and the fever left her ; and she arose , and ministered unto him .
ASV	Matthew	8	16	And when even was come , they brought unto him many [ l ] possessed with demons : and he cast out the spirits with a word , and healed all that were sick :
ASV	Matthew	8	17	that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet , saying , [ m ] Himself took our infirmities , and bare our diseases .
ASV	Matthew	8	18	Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him , he gave commandment to depart unto the other side .
ASV	Matthew	8	19	And there came [ n ] a scribe , and said unto him , Teacher , I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest .
ASV	Matthew	8	20	And Jesus saith unto him , The foxes have holes , and the birds of the heaven have [ o ] nests ; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head .
ASV	Matthew	8	21	And another of the disciples said unto him , Lord , suffer me first to go and bury my father .
ASV	Matthew	8	22	But Jesus saith unto him , Follow me ; and leave the dead to bury their own dead .
ASV	Matthew	8	23	And when he was entered into a boat , his disciples followed him .
ASV	Matthew	8	24	And behold , there arose a great tempest in the sea , insomuch that the boat was covered with the waves : but he was asleep .
ASV	Matthew	8	25	And they came to him , and awoke him , saying , Save , Lord ; we perish .
ASV	Matthew	8	26	And he saith unto them , Why are ye fearful , O ye of little faith ? Then he arose , and rebuked the winds and the sea ; and there was a great calm .
ASV	Matthew	8	27	And the men marvelled , saying , What manner of man is this , that even the winds and the sea obey him ?
ASV	Matthew	8	28	And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gadarenes , there met him two [ p ] possessed with demons , coming forth out of the tombs , exceeding fierce , so that no man could pass by that way .
ASV	Matthew	8	29	And behold , they cried out , saying , What have we to do with thee , thou Son of God ? art thou come hither to torment us before the time ?
ASV	Matthew	8	30	Now there was afar off from them a herd of many swine feeding .
ASV	Matthew	8	31	And the demons besought him , saying , If thou cast us out , send us away into the herd of swine .
ASV	Matthew	8	32	And he said unto them , Go . And they came out , and went into the swine : and behold , the whole herd rushed down the steep into the sea , and perished in the waters .
ASV	Matthew	8	33	And they that fed them fled , and went away into the city , and told everything , and what was befallen to them that were [ q ] possessed with demons .
ASV	Matthew	8	34	And behold , all the city came out to meet Jesus : and when they saw him , they besought him that he would depart from their borders .

ASV	Matthew	9	9	And as Jesus passed by from thence , he saw a man , called Matthew , sitting at the place of toll : and he saith unto him , Follow me . And he arose , and followed him .
ASV	Matthew	9	2	And behold , they brought to him a man sick of the palsy , lying on a bed : and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy , [ a ] Son , be of good cheer ; thy sins are forgiven .
ASV	Matthew	9	3	And behold , certain of the scribes said within themselves , This man blasphemeth .
ASV	Matthew	9	4	And Jesus [ b ] knowing their thoughts said , Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts ?
ASV	Matthew	9	5	For which is easier , to say , Thy sins are forgiven ; or to say , Arise , and walk ?
ASV	Matthew	9	6	But that ye may know that the Son of man hath authority on earth to forgive sins ( then saith he to the sick of the palsy ) , Arise , and take up thy bed , and go unto thy house .
ASV	Matthew	9	7	And he arose , and departed to his house .
ASV	Matthew	9	8	But when the multitudes saw it , they were afraid , and glorified God , who had given such authority unto men .
ASV	Matthew	9	10	And it came to pass , as he [ c ] sat at meat in the house , behold , many [ d ] publicans and sinners came and sat down with Jesus and his disciples .
ASV	Matthew	9	11	And when the Pharisees saw it , they said unto his disciples , Why eateth your Teacher with the [ e ] publicans and sinners ?
ASV	Matthew	9	12	But when he heard it , he said , They that are [ f ] whole have no need of a physician , but they that are sick .
ASV	Matthew	9	13	But go ye and learn what this meaneth , [ g ] I desire mercy , and not sacrifice : for I came not to call the righteous , but sinners .
ASV	Matthew	9	14	Then come to him the disciples of John , saying , Why do we and the Pharisees fast [ h ] oft , but thy disciples fast not ?
ASV	Matthew	9	15	And Jesus said unto them , Can the [ i ] sons of the bridechamber mourn , as long as the bridegroom is with them ? but the days will come , when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them , and then will they fast .
ASV	Matthew	9	16	And no man putteth a piece of undressed cloth upon an old garment ; for that which should fill it up taketh from the garment , and a worse rent is made .
ASV	Matthew	9	17	Neither do men put new wine into old [ j ] wine-skins : else the skins burst , and the wine is spilled , and the skins perish : but they put new wine into fresh wine-skins , and both are preserved .
ASV	Matthew	9	18	While he spake these things unto them , behold , there came [ k ] a ruler , and [ l ] worshipped him , saying , My daughter is even now dead : but come and lay thy hand upon her , and she shall live .
ASV	Matthew	9	19	And Jesus arose , and followed him , and so did his disciples .
ASV	Matthew	9	20	And behold , a woman , who had an issue of blood twelve years , came behind him , and touched the border of his garment :
ASV	Matthew	9	21	for she said within herself , If I do but touch his garment , I shall be [ m ] made whole .
ASV	Matthew	9	22	But Jesus turning and seeing her said , Daughter , be of good cheer ; thy faith hath [ n ] made thee whole . And the woman was [ o ] made whole from that hour .
ASV	Matthew	9	23	And when Jesus came into the ruler ’ s house , and saw the flute-players , and the crowd making a tumult ,
ASV	Matthew	9	24	he said , Give place : for the damsel is not dead , but sleepeth . And they laughed him to scorn .
ASV	Matthew	9	25	But when the crowd was put forth , he entered in , and took her by the hand ; and the damsel arose .
ASV	Matthew	9	26	And [ p ] the fame hereof went forth into all that land .
ASV	Matthew	9	27	And as Jesus passed by from thence , two blind men followed him , crying out , and saying , Have mercy on us , thou son of David .
ASV	Matthew	9	28	And when he was come into the house , the blind men came to him : and Jesus saith unto them , Believe ye that I am able to do this ? They say unto him , Yea , Lord .
ASV	Matthew	9	29	Then touched he their eyes , saying , According to your faith be it done unto you .
ASV	Matthew	9	30	And their eyes were opened . And Jesus [ q ] strictly charged them , saying , See that no man know it .
ASV	Matthew	9	31	But they went forth , and spread abroad his fame in all that land .
ASV	Matthew	9	32	And as they went forth , behold , there was brought to him a dumb man possessed with a demon .
ASV	Matthew	9	33	And when the demon was cast out , the dumb man spake : and the multitudes marvelled , saying , It was never so seen in Israel .
ASV	Matthew	9	34	But the Pharisees said , [ r ] By the prince of the demons casteth he out demons .
ASV	Matthew	9	35	And Jesus went about all the cities and the villages , teaching in their synagogues , and preaching the [ s ] gospel of the kingdom , and healing all manner of disease and all manner of sickness .
ASV	Matthew	9	36	But when he saw the multitudes , he was moved with compassion for them , because they were distressed and scattered , as sheep not having a shepherd .
ASV	Matthew	9	37	Then saith he unto his disciples , The harvest indeed is plenteous , but the laborers are few .
ASV	Matthew	9	38	Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest , that he send forth laborers into his harvest .

ASV	Matthew	10	10	no wallet for your journey , neither two coats , nor shoes , nor staff : for the laborer is worthy of his food .
ASV	Matthew	10	2	Now the names of the twelve apostles are these : The first , Simon , who is called Peter , and Andrew his brother ; [ a ] James the son of Zebedee , and John his brother ;
ASV	Matthew	10	3	Philip , and Bartholomew ; Thomas , and Matthew the [ b ] publican ; [ c ] James the son of Alphaeus , and Thaddaeus ;
ASV	Matthew	10	4	Simon the [ d ] Cananaean , and Judas Iscariot , who also [ e ] betrayed him .
ASV	Matthew	10	5	These twelve Jesus sent forth , and charged them , saying , Go not into any way of the Gentiles , and enter not into any city of the Samaritans :
ASV	Matthew	10	6	but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel .
ASV	Matthew	10	7	And as ye go , preach , saying , The kingdom of heaven is at hand .
ASV	Matthew	10	8	Heal the sick , raise the dead , cleanse the lepers , cast out demons : freely ye received , freely give .
ASV	Matthew	10	9	Get you no gold , nor silver , nor brass in your [ f ] purses ;
ASV	Matthew	10	11	And into whatsoever city or village ye shall enter , search out who in it is worthy ; and there abide till ye go forth .
ASV	Matthew	10	12	And as ye enter into the house , salute it .
ASV	Matthew	10	13	And if the house be worthy , let your peace come upon it : but if it be not worthy , let your peace return to you .
ASV	Matthew	10	14	And whosoever shall not receive you , nor hear your words , as ye go forth out of that house or that city , shake off the dust of your feet .
ASV	Matthew	10	15	Verily I say unto you , It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment , than for that city .
ASV	Matthew	10	16	Behold , I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves : be ye therefore wise as serpents , and [ g ] harmless as doves .
ASV	Matthew	10	17	But beware of men : for they will deliver you up to councils , and in their synagogues they will scourge you ;
ASV	Matthew	10	18	yea and before governors and kings shall ye be brought for my sake , for a testimony to them and to the Gentiles .
ASV	Matthew	10	19	But when they deliver you up , be not anxious how or what ye shall speak : for it shall be given you in that hour what ye shall speak .
ASV	Matthew	10	20	For it is not ye that speak , but the Spirit of your Father that speaketh in you .
ASV	Matthew	10	21	And brother shall deliver up brother to death , and the father his child : and children shall rise up against parents , and [ h ] cause them to be put to death .
ASV	Matthew	10	22	And ye shall be hated of all men for my name ’ s sake : but he that endureth to the end , the same shall be saved .
ASV	Matthew	10	23	But when they persecute you in this city , flee into the next : for verily I say unto you , Ye shall not have gone through the cities of Israel , till the Son of man be come .
ASV	Matthew	10	24	A disciple is not above his teacher , nor a [ i ] servant above his lord .
ASV	Matthew	10	25	It is enough for the disciple that he be as his teacher , and the [ j ] servant as his lord . If they have called the master of the house [ k ] Beelzebub , how much more them of his household !
ASV	Matthew	10	26	Fear them not therefore : for there is nothing covered , that shall not be revealed ; and hid , that shall not be known .
ASV	Matthew	10	27	What I tell you in the darkness , speak ye in the light ; and what ye hear in the ear , proclaim upon the house-tops .
ASV	Matthew	10	28	And be not afraid of them that kill the body , but are not able to kill the soul : but rather fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in [ l ] hell .
ASV	Matthew	10	29	Are not two sparrows sold for a penny ? and not one of them shall fall on the ground without your Father :
ASV	Matthew	10	30	but the very hairs of your head are all numbered .
ASV	Matthew	10	31	Fear not therefore : ye are of more value than many sparrows .
ASV	Matthew	10	32	Every one therefore who shall confess [ m ] me before men , [ n ] him will I also confess before my Father who is in heaven .
ASV	Matthew	10	33	But whosoever shall deny me before men , him will I also deny before my Father who is in heaven .
ASV	Matthew	10	34	Think not that I came to [ o ] send peace on the earth : I came not to [ p ] send peace , but a sword .
ASV	Matthew	10	35	For I came to set a man at variance against his father , and the daughter against her mother , and the daughter in law against her mother in law :
ASV	Matthew	10	36	and a man ’ s foes shall be they of his own household .
ASV	Matthew	10	37	He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me ; and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me .
ASV	Matthew	10	38	And he that doth not take his cross and follow after me , is not worthy of me .
ASV	Matthew	10	39	He that [ q ] findeth his life shall lose it ; and he that [ r ] loseth his life for my sake shall find it .
ASV	Matthew	10	40	He that receiveth you receiveth me , and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me .
ASV	Matthew	10	41	He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet ’ s reward : and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man ’ s reward .
ASV	Matthew	10	42	And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only , in the name of a disciple , verily I say unto you he shall in no wise lose his reward .

ASV	Matthew	11	11	Verily I say unto you , Among them that are born of women there hath not arisen a greater than John the Baptist : yet he that is [ d ] but little in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he .
ASV	Matthew	11	2	Now when John heard in the prison the works of the Christ , he sent by his disciples
ASV	Matthew	11	3	and said unto him , Art thou he that cometh , or look we for another ?
ASV	Matthew	11	4	And Jesus answered and said unto them , Go and tell John the things which ye hear and see :
ASV	Matthew	11	5	the blind receive their sight , and the lame walk , the lepers are cleansed , and the deaf hear , and the dead are raised up , and the poor have [ a ] good tidings preached to them .
ASV	Matthew	11	6	And blessed is he , whosoever shall find no occasion of stumbling in me .
ASV	Matthew	11	7	And as these went their way , Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John , What went ye out into the wilderness to behold ? a reed shaken with the wind ?
ASV	Matthew	11	8	But what went ye out to see ? a man clothed in soft raiment ? Behold , they that wear soft raiment are in kings ’ houses .
ASV	Matthew	11	9	[ b ] But wherefore went ye out ? to see a prophet ? Yea , I say unto you , and much more than a prophet .
ASV	Matthew	11	10	This is he , of whom it is written , [ c ] Behold , I send my messenger before thy face , Who shall prepare thy way before thee .
ASV	Matthew	11	12	And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence , and men of violence take it by force .
ASV	Matthew	11	13	For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John .
ASV	Matthew	11	14	And if ye are willing to receive [ e ] it , this is Elijah , that is to come .
ASV	Matthew	11	15	He that hath ears [ f ] to hear , let him hear .
ASV	Matthew	11	16	But whereunto shall I liken this generation ? It is like unto children sitting in the marketplaces , who call unto their fellows
ASV	Matthew	11	17	and say , We piped unto you , and ye did not dance ; we wailed , and ye did not [ g ] mourn .
ASV	Matthew	11	18	For John came neither eating nor drinking , and they say , He hath a demon .
ASV	Matthew	11	19	The Son of man came eating and drinking , and they say , Behold , a gluttonous man and a winebibber , a friend of [ h ] publicans and sinners ! And wisdom [ i ] is justified by her [ j ] works .
ASV	Matthew	11	20	Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his [ k ] mighty works were done , because they repented not .
ASV	Matthew	11	21	Woe unto thee , Chorazin ! woe unto thee , Bethsaida ! for if the [ l ] mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you , they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes .
ASV	Matthew	11	22	But I say unto you , it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment , than for you .
ASV	Matthew	11	23	And thou , Capernaum , shalt thou be exalted unto heaven ? thou shalt [ m ] go down unto Hades : for if the [ n ] mighty works had been done in Sodom which were done in thee , it would have remained until this day .
ASV	Matthew	11	24	But I say unto you that it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment , than for thee .
ASV	Matthew	11	25	At that season Jesus answered and said , I [ o ] thank thee , O Father , Lord of heaven and earth , that thou didst hide these things from the wise and understanding , and didst reveal them unto babes :
ASV	Matthew	11	26	yea , Father , [ p ] for so it was well-pleasing in thy sight .
ASV	Matthew	11	27	All things have been delivered unto me of my Father : and no one knoweth the Son , save the Father ; neither doth any know the Father , save the Son , and he to whomsoever the Son willeth to reveal him .
ASV	Matthew	11	28	Come unto me , all ye that labor and are heavy laden , and I will give you rest .
ASV	Matthew	11	29	Take my yoke upon you , and learn of me ; for I am meek and lowly in heart : and ye shall find rest unto your souls .

ASV	Matthew	12	2	But the Pharisees , when they saw it , said unto him , Behold , thy disciples do that which it is not lawful to do upon the sabbath .
ASV	Matthew	12	3	But he said unto them , [ a ] Have ye not read what David did , when he was hungry , and they that were with him ;
ASV	Matthew	12	4	how he entered into the house of God , and [ b ] ate the showbread , which it was not lawful for him to eat , neither for them that were with him , but only for the priests ?
ASV	Matthew	12	5	Or have ye not read in the law , [ c ] that on the sabbath day the priests in the temple profane the sabbath , and are guiltless ?
ASV	Matthew	12	6	But I say unto you , that [ d ] one greater than the temple is here .
ASV	Matthew	12	7	But if ye had known what this meaneth , [ e ] I desire mercy , and not sacrifice , ye would not have condemned the guiltless .
ASV	Matthew	12	8	For the Son of man is lord of the sabbath .

ASV	Matthew	12	15	And Jesus perceiving it withdrew from thence : and many followed him ; and he healed them all ,
ASV	Matthew	12	16	and charged them that they should not make him known :
ASV	Matthew	12	17	that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet , saying ,
ASV	Matthew	12	18	[ f ] Behold , my [ g ] servant whom I have chosen ; My beloved in whom my soul is well pleased : I will put my Spirit upon him , And he shall declare judgment to the [ h ] Gentiles .
ASV	Matthew	12	19	He shall not strive , nor cry aloud ; Neither shall any one hear his voice in the streets .
ASV	Matthew	12	20	A bruised reed shall he not break , And smoking flax shall he not quench , Till he send forth judgment unto victory .
ASV	Matthew	12	21	And in his name shall the [ i ] Gentiles hope .
ASV	Matthew	12	22	Then was brought unto him [ j ] one possessed with a demon , blind and dumb : and he healed him , insomuch that the dumb man spake and saw .
ASV	Matthew	12	23	And all the multitudes were amazed , and said , Can this be the son of David ?
ASV	Matthew	12	24	But when the Pharisees heard it , they said , This man doth not cast out demons , but [ k ] by [ l ] Beelzebub the prince of the demons .
ASV	Matthew	12	25	And knowing their thoughts he said unto them , Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation ; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand :
ASV	Matthew	12	26	and if Satan casteth out Satan , he is divided against himself ; how then shall his kingdom stand ?
ASV	Matthew	12	27	And if I [ m ] by [ n ] Beelzebub cast out demons , [ o ] by whom do your sons cast them out ? therefore shall they be your judges .
ASV	Matthew	12	28	But if I [ p ] by the Spirit of God cast out demons , then is the kingdom of God come upon you .
ASV	Matthew	12	29	Or how can one enter into the house of the strong man , and spoil his goods , except he first bind the strong man ? and then he will spoil his house .
ASV	Matthew	12	30	He that is not with me is against me ; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth .
ASV	Matthew	12	31	Therefore I say unto you , Every sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men ; but the blasphemy against the Spirit shall not be forgiven .
ASV	Matthew	12	32	And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man , it shall be forgiven him ; but whosoever shall speak against the Holy Spirit , it shall not be forgiven him , neither in this [ q ] world , nor in that which is to come .
ASV	Matthew	12	33	Either make the tree good , and its fruit good ; or make the tree corrupt , and its fruit corrupt : for the tree is known by its fruit .
ASV	Matthew	12	34	Ye offspring of vipers , how can ye , being evil , speak good things ? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh .
ASV	Matthew	12	35	The good man out of his good treasure bringeth forth good things : and the evil man out of his evil treasure bringeth forth evil things .
ASV	Matthew	12	36	And I say unto you , that every idle word that men shall speak , they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment .
ASV	Matthew	12	37	For by thy words thou shalt be justified , and by thy words thou shalt be condemned .
ASV	Matthew	12	38	Then certain of the scribes and Pharisees answered him , saying , Teacher , we would see a sign from thee .
ASV	Matthew	12	39	But he answered and said unto them , An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign ; and there shall no sign be given to it but the sign of Jonah the prophet :
ASV	Matthew	12	40	for as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the [ r ] whale ; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth .
ASV	Matthew	12	41	The men of Nineveh shall stand up in the judgment with this generation , and shall condemn it : for they repented at the preaching of Jonah ; and behold , [ s ] a greater than Jonah is here .
ASV	Matthew	12	42	The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation , and shall condemn it : for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon ; and behold , [ t ] a greater than Solomon is here .
ASV	Matthew	12	43	But the unclean spirit , when [ u ] he is gone out of the man , passeth through waterless places , seeking rest , and findeth it not .
ASV	Matthew	12	44	Then [ v ] he saith , I will return into my house whence I came out ; and when [ w ] he is come , [ x ] he findeth it empty , swept , and garnished .
ASV	Matthew	12	45	Then goeth [ y ] he , and taketh with [ z ] himself seven other spirits more evil than [ aa ] himself , and they enter in and dwell there : and the last state of that man becometh worse than the first . Even so shall it be also unto this evil generation .
ASV	Matthew	12	46	While he was yet speaking to the multitudes , behold , his mother and his brethren stood without , seeking to speak to him .
ASV	Matthew	12	47	.
ASV	Matthew	12	48	But he answered and said unto him that told him , Who is my mother ? and who are my brethren ?
ASV	Matthew	12	49	And he stretched forth his hand towards his disciples , and said , Behold , my mother and my brethren !
ASV	Matthew	12	50	For whosoever shall do the will of my Father who is in heaven , he is my brother , and sister , and mother . Footnotes - Matthew 12:3

ASV	Matthew	13	13	Therefore speak I to them in parables ; because seeing they see not , and hearing they hear not , neither do they understand .
ASV	Matthew	13	2	And there were gathered unto him great multitudes , so that he entered into a boat , and sat ; and all the multitude stood on the beach .
ASV	Matthew	13	3	And he spake to them many things in parables , saying , Behold , the sower went forth to sow ;
ASV	Matthew	13	4	and as he sowed , some seeds fell by the way side , and the birds came and devoured them :
ASV	Matthew	13	5	and others fell upon the rocky places , where they had not much earth : and straightway they sprang up , because they had no deepness of earth :
ASV	Matthew	13	6	and when the sun was risen , they were scorched ; and because they had no root , they withered away .
ASV	Matthew	13	7	And others fell upon the thorns ; and the thorns grew up and choked them :
ASV	Matthew	13	8	and others fell upon the good ground , and yielded fruit , some a hundredfold , some sixty , some thirty .

ASV	Matthew	13	11	And he answered and said unto them , Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven , but to them it is not given .
ASV	Matthew	13	12	For whosoever hath , to him shall be given , and he shall have abundance : but whosoever hath not , from him shall be taken away even that which he hath .
ASV	Matthew	13	14	And unto them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah , which saith , [ b ] By hearing ye shall hear , and shall in no wise understand ; And seeing ye shall see , and shall in no wise perceive :
ASV	Matthew	13	15	For this people ’ s heart is waxed gross , And their ears are dull of hearing , And their eyes they have closed ; Lest haply they should perceive with their eyes , And hear with their ears , And understand with their heart , And should turn again , And I should heal them .
ASV	Matthew	13	16	But blessed are your eyes , for they see ; and your ears , for they hear .
ASV	Matthew	13	17	For verily I say unto you , that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things which ye see , and saw them not ; and to hear the things which ye hear , and heard them not .
ASV	Matthew	13	18	Hear then ye the parable of the sower .
ASV	Matthew	13	19	When any one heareth the word of the kingdom , and understandeth it not , then cometh the evil one , and snatcheth away that which hath been sown in his heart . This is he that was sown by the way side .
ASV	Matthew	13	20	And he that was sown upon the rocky places , this is he that heareth the word , and straightway with joy receiveth it ;
ASV	Matthew	13	21	yet hath he not root in himself , but endureth for a while ; and when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word , straightway he stumbleth .
ASV	Matthew	13	22	And he that was sown among the thorns , this is he that heareth the word ; and the care of the [ c ] world , and the deceitfulness of riches , choke the word , and he becometh unfruitful .
ASV	Matthew	13	23	And he that was sown upon the good ground , this is he that heareth the word , and understandeth it ; who verily beareth fruit , and bringeth forth , some a hundredfold , some sixty , some thirty .
ASV	Matthew	13	24	Another parable set he before them , saying , The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man that sowed good seed in his field :
ASV	Matthew	13	25	but while men slept , his enemy came and sowed [ d ] tares also among the wheat , and went away .
ASV	Matthew	13	26	But when the blade sprang up and brought forth fruit , then appeared the tares also .
ASV	Matthew	13	27	And the [ e ] servants of the householder came and said unto him , Sir , didst thou not sow good seed in thy field ? whence then hath it tares ?
ASV	Matthew	13	28	And he said unto them , [ f ] An enemy hath done this . And the [ g ] servants say unto him , Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up ?
ASV	Matthew	13	29	But he saith , Nay ; lest haply while ye gather up the tares , ye root up the wheat with them .
ASV	Matthew	13	30	Let both grow together until the harvest : and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers , Gather up first the tares , and bind them in bundles to burn them ; but gather the wheat into my barn .
ASV	Matthew	13	31	Another parable set he before them , saying , The kingdom of heaven is like unto a grain of mustard seed , which a man took , and sowed in his field :
ASV	Matthew	13	32	which indeed is less than all seeds ; but when it is grown , it is greater than the herbs , and becometh a tree , so that the birds of the heaven come and lodge in the branches thereof .
ASV	Matthew	13	33	Another parable spake he unto them ; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven , which a woman took , and hid in three [ h ] measures of meal , till it was all leavened .
ASV	Matthew	13	34	All these things spake Jesus in parables unto the multitudes ; and without a parable spake he nothing unto them :
ASV	Matthew	13	35	that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet , saying ,
ASV	Matthew	13	36	Then he left the multitudes , and went into the house : and his disciples came unto him , saying , Explain unto us the parable of the tares of the field .
ASV	Matthew	13	37	And he answered and said , He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man ;
ASV	Matthew	13	38	and the field is the world ; and the good seed , these are the sons of the kingdom ; and the tares are the sons of the evil one ;
ASV	Matthew	13	39	and the enemy that sowed them is the devil : and the harvest is [ k ] the end of the world ; and the reapers are angels .
ASV	Matthew	13	40	As therefore the tares are gathered up and burned with fire ; so shall it be in [ l ] the end of the world .
ASV	Matthew	13	41	The Son of man shall send forth his angels , and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that cause stumbling , and them that do iniquity ,
ASV	Matthew	13	42	and shall cast them into the furnace of fire : there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth .
ASV	Matthew	13	43	, to hear : as in Mk . 4:9 ; Lk . 8:8 . - Matthew 13:14 Isa . 6:9 ,
ASV	Matthew	13	44	The kingdom of heaven is like unto a treasure hidden in the field ; which a man found , and hid ; and [ n ] in his joy he goeth and selleth all that he hath , and buyeth that field .
ASV	Matthew	13	45	Again , the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a merchant seeking goodly pearls :
ASV	Matthew	13	46	and having found one pearl of great price , he went and sold all that he had , and bought it .
ASV	Matthew	13	47	Again , the kingdom of heaven is like unto a [ o ] net , that was cast into the sea , and gathered of every kind :
ASV	Matthew	13	48	which , when it was filled , they drew up on the beach ; and they sat down , and gathered the good into vessels , but the bad they cast away .
ASV	Matthew	13	49	So shall it be in [ p ] the end of the world : the angels shall come forth , and sever the wicked from among the righteous ,
ASV	Matthew	13	50	and shall cast them into the furnace of fire : there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth .
ASV	Matthew	13	51	Have ye understood all these things ? They say unto him , Yea .
ASV	Matthew	13	52	And he said unto them , Therefore every scribe who hath been made a disciple to the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a householder , who bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old .
ASV	Matthew	13	53	And it came to pass , when Jesus had finished these parables , he departed thence .
ASV	Matthew	13	54	And coming into his own country he taught them in their synagogue , insomuch that they were astonished , and said , Whence hath this man this wisdom , and these [ q ] mighty works ?
ASV	Matthew	13	55	Is not this the carpenter ’ s son ? is not his mother called Mary ? and his brethren , [ r ] James , and Joseph , and Simon , and Judas ?
ASV	Matthew	13	56	And his sisters , are they not all with us ? Whence then hath this man all these things ?
ASV	Matthew	13	57	And they were [ s ] offended in him . But Jesus said unto them , A prophet is not without honor , save in his own country , and in his own house .
ASV	Matthew	13	58	And he did not many [ t ] mighty works there because of their unbelief . Footnotes - Matthew 13:9 Some ancient authorities add here , and in verse
ASV	Matthew	14	14	And he came forth , and saw a great multitude , and he had compassion on them , and healed their sick .
ASV	Matthew	14	2	and said unto his servants , This is John the Baptist ; he is risen from the dead ; and therefore do these powers work in him .
ASV	Matthew	14	3	For Herod had laid hold on John , and bound him , and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias , his brother Philip ’ s wife .
ASV	Matthew	14	4	For John said unto him , It is not lawful for thee to have her .
ASV	Matthew	14	5	And when he would have put him to death , he feared the multitude , because they counted him as a prophet .
ASV	Matthew	14	6	But when Herod ’ s birthday came , the daughter of Herodias danced in the midst , and pleased Herod .
ASV	Matthew	14	7	Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she should ask .
ASV	Matthew	14	8	And she , being put forward by her mother , saith , Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist .
ASV	Matthew	14	9	And the king was grieved ; but for the sake of his oaths , and of them that sat at meat with him , he commanded it to be given ;
ASV	Matthew	14	10	and he sent and beheaded John in the prison .
ASV	Matthew	14	11	And his head was brought on a platter , and given to the damsel : and she brought it to her mother .
ASV	Matthew	14	12	And his disciples came , and took up the corpse , and buried him ; and they went and told Jesus .
ASV	Matthew	14	13	Now when Jesus heard it , he withdrew from thence in a boat , to a desert place apart : and when the multitudes heard thereof , they followed him [ a ] on foot from the cities .
ASV	Matthew	14	15	And when even was come , the disciples came to him , saying , The place is desert , and the time is already past ; send the multitudes away , that they may go into the villages , and buy themselves food .
ASV	Matthew	14	16	But Jesus said unto them , They have no need to go away ; give ye them to eat .
ASV	Matthew	14	17	And they say unto him , We have here but five loaves , and two fishes .
ASV	Matthew	14	18	And he said , Bring them hither to me .
ASV	Matthew	14	19	And he commanded the multitudes to [ b ] sit down on the grass ; and he took the five loaves , and the two fishes , and looking up to heaven , he blessed , and brake and gave the loaves to the disciples , and the disciples to the multitudes .
ASV	Matthew	14	20	And they all ate , and were filled : and they took up that which remained over of the broken pieces , twelve baskets full .
ASV	Matthew	14	21	And they that did eat were about five thousand men , besides women and children .
ASV	Matthew	14	22	And straightway he constrained the disciples to enter into the boat , and to go before him unto the other side , till he should send the multitudes away .
ASV	Matthew	14	23	And after he had sent the multitudes away , he went up into the mountain apart to pray : and when even was come , he was there alone .
ASV	Matthew	14	24	But the boat [ c ] was now in the midst of the sea , distressed by the waves ; for the wind was contrary .
ASV	Matthew	14	25	And in the fourth watch of the night he came unto them , walking upon the sea .
ASV	Matthew	14	26	And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea , they were troubled , saying , It is a ghost ; and they cried out for fear .
ASV	Matthew	14	27	But straightway Jesus spake unto them , saying , Be of good cheer ; it is I ; be not afraid .
ASV	Matthew	14	28	And Peter answered him and said , Lord , if it be thou , bid me come unto thee upon the waters .
ASV	Matthew	14	29	And he said , Come . And Peter went down from the boat , and walked upon the waters [ d ] to come to Jesus .
ASV	Matthew	14	30	But when he saw the [ e ] wind , he was afraid ; and beginning to sink , he cried out , saying , Lord , save me .
ASV	Matthew	14	31	And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand , and took hold of him , and saith unto him , O thou of little faith , wherefore didst thou doubt ?
ASV	Matthew	14	32	And when they were gone up into the boat , the wind ceased .
ASV	Matthew	14	33	And they that were in the boat [ f ] worshipped him , saying , Of a truth thou art the Son of God .
ASV	Matthew	14	34	And when they had crossed over , they came to the land , unto Gennesaret .
ASV	Matthew	14	35	And when the men of that place knew him , they sent into all that region round about , and brought unto him all that were sick ;
ASV	Matthew	14	36	and they besought him that they might only touch the border of his garment : and as many as touched were made whole .

ASV	Matthew	15	15	And Peter answered and said unto him , Declare unto us the parable .
ASV	Matthew	15	2	Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders ? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread .
ASV	Matthew	15	3	And he answered and said unto them , Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition ?
ASV	Matthew	15	4	For God said , [ a ] Honor thy father and thy mother : and , [ b ] He that speaketh evil of father or mother , let him [ c ] die the death .
ASV	Matthew	15	5	But ye say , Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother , That wherewith thou mightest have been profited by me is given to God ;
ASV	Matthew	15	6	he shall not honor his father . [ d ] And ye have made void the [ e ] word of God because of your tradition .
ASV	Matthew	15	7	Ye hypocrites , well did Isaiah prophesy of you , saying ,
ASV	Matthew	15	8	[ f ] This people honoreth me with their lips ; But their heart is far from me .
ASV	Matthew	15	9	But in vain do they worship me , Teaching as their doctrines the precepts of men .
ASV	Matthew	15	10	And he called to him the multitude , and said unto them , Hear , and understand :
ASV	Matthew	15	11	Not that which entereth into the mouth defileth the man ; but that which proceedeth out of the mouth , this defileth the man .
ASV	Matthew	15	12	Then came the disciples , and said unto him , Knowest thou that the Pharisees were [ g ] offended , when they heard this saying ?
ASV	Matthew	15	13	But he answered and said , Every [ h ] plant which my heavenly Father planted not , shall be rooted up .
ASV	Matthew	15	14	Let them alone : they are blind guides . And if the blind guide the blind , both shall fall into a pit .
ASV	Matthew	15	16	And he said , Are ye also even yet without understanding ?
ASV	Matthew	15	17	Perceive ye not , that whatsoever goeth into the mouth passeth into the belly , and is cast out into the draught ?
ASV	Matthew	15	18	But the things which proceed out of the mouth come forth out of the heart ; and they defile the man .
ASV	Matthew	15	19	For out of the heart come forth evil thoughts , murders , adulteries , fornications , thefts , false witness , railings :
ASV	Matthew	15	20	these are the things which defile the man ; but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not the man .
ASV	Matthew	15	21	And Jesus went out thence , and withdrew into the parts of Tyre and Sidon .
ASV	Matthew	15	22	And behold , a Canaanitish woman came out from those borders , and cried , saying , Have mercy on me , O Lord , thou son of David ; my daughter is grievously vexed with a demon .
ASV	Matthew	15	23	But he answered her not a word . And his disciples came and besought him , saying , Send her away ; for she crieth after us .
ASV	Matthew	15	24	But he answered and said , I was not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel .
ASV	Matthew	15	25	But she came and [ i ] worshipped him , saying , Lord , help me .
ASV	Matthew	15	26	And he answered and said , It is not meet to take the children ’ s [ j ] bread and cast it to the dogs .
ASV	Matthew	15	27	But she said , Yea , Lord : for even the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters ’ table .
ASV	Matthew	15	28	Then Jesus answered and said unto her , O woman , great is thy faith : be it done unto thee even as thou wilt . And her daughter was healed from that hour .
ASV	Matthew	15	29	And Jesus departed thence , and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee ; and he went up into the mountain , and sat there .
ASV	Matthew	15	30	And there came unto him great multitudes , having with them the lame , blind , dumb , maimed , and many others , and they cast them down at his feet ; and he healed them :
ASV	Matthew	15	31	insomuch that the multitude wondered , when they saw the dumb speaking , the maimed whole , and the lame walking , and the blind seeing : and they glorified the God of Israel .
ASV	Matthew	15	32	And Jesus called unto him his disciples , and said , I have compassion on the multitude , because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat : and I would not send them away fasting , lest haply they faint on the way .
ASV	Matthew	15	33	And the disciples say unto him , Whence should we have so many loaves in a desert place as to fill so great a multitude ?
ASV	Matthew	15	34	And Jesus said unto them , How many loaves have ye ? And they said , Seven , and a few small fishes .
ASV	Matthew	15	35	And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground ;
ASV	Matthew	15	36	and he took the seven loaves and the fishes ; and he gave thanks and brake , and gave to the disciples , and the disciples to the multitudes .
ASV	Matthew	15	37	And they all ate , and were filled : and they took up that which remained over of the broken pieces , seven baskets full .
ASV	Matthew	15	38	And they that did eat were four thousand men , besides women and children .
ASV	Matthew	15	39	And he sent away the multitudes , and entered into the boat , and came into the borders of Magadan .

ASV	Matthew	16	15	He saith unto them , But who say ye that I am ?

ASV	Matthew	16	21	From that time began [ m ] Jesus to show unto his disciples , that he must go unto Jerusalem , and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes , and be killed , and the third day be raised up .
ASV	Matthew	16	22	And Peter took him , and began to rebuke him , saying , [ n ] Be it far from thee , Lord : this shall never be unto thee .
ASV	Matthew	16	23	But he turned , and said unto Peter , Get thee behind me , Satan : thou art a stumbling-block unto me : for thou mindest not the things of God , but the things of men .
ASV	Matthew	16	24	Then said Jesus unto his disciples , If any man would come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow me .
ASV	Matthew	16	25	For whosoever would save his life shall lose it : and whosoever shall lose his life for my sake shall find it .
ASV	Matthew	16	26	For what shall a man be profited , if he shall gain the whole world , and forfeit his life ? or what shall a man give in exchange for his life ?
ASV	Matthew	16	27	For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels ; and then shall he render unto every man according to his [ o ] deeds .
ASV	Matthew	16	28	Verily I say unto you , There are some of them that stand here , who shall in no wise taste of death , till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom . Footnotes - Matthew 16:2 The following words , to the end of verse
ASV	Matthew	17	17	And Jesus answered and said , O faithless and perverse generation , how long shall I be with you ? how long shall I bear with you ? bring him hither to me .
ASV	Matthew	17	2	and he was transfigured before them ; and his face did shine as the sun , and his garments became white as the light .
ASV	Matthew	17	3	And behold , there appeared unto them Moses and Elijah talking with him .
ASV	Matthew	17	4	And Peter answered , and said unto Jesus , Lord , it is good for us to be here : if thou wilt , I will make here three [ b ] tabernacles ; one for thee , and one for Moses , and one for Elijah .
ASV	Matthew	17	5	While he was yet speaking , behold , a bright cloud overshadowed them : and behold , a voice out of the cloud , saying , This is my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased ; hear ye him .
ASV	Matthew	17	6	And when the disciples heard it , they fell on their face , and were sore afraid .
ASV	Matthew	17	7	And Jesus came and touched them and said , Arise , and be not afraid .
ASV	Matthew	17	8	And lifting up their eyes , they saw no one , save Jesus only .
ASV	Matthew	17	9	And as they were coming down from the mountain , Jesus commanded them , saying , Tell the vision to no man , until the Son of man be risen from the dead .
ASV	Matthew	17	10	And his disciples asked him , saying , Why then say the scribes that Elijah must first come ?
ASV	Matthew	17	11	And he answered and said , Elijah indeed cometh , and shall restore all things :
ASV	Matthew	17	12	but I say unto you , that Elijah is come already , and they knew him not , but did unto him whatsoever they would . Even so shall the Son of man also suffer of them .
ASV	Matthew	17	13	Then understood the disciples that he spake unto them of John the Baptist .
ASV	Matthew	17	14	And when they were come to the multitude , there came to him a man , kneeling to him , and saying ,
ASV	Matthew	17	15	Lord , have mercy on my son : for he is epileptic , and suffereth grievously ; for oft-times he falleth into the fire , and oft-times into the water .
ASV	Matthew	17	16	And I brought him to thy disciples , and they could not cure him .
ASV	Matthew	17	18	And Jesus rebuked him ; and the demon went out of him : and the boy was cured from that hour .
ASV	Matthew	17	19	Then came the disciples to Jesus apart , and said , Why could not we cast it out ?
ASV	Matthew	17	20	And he saith unto them , Because of your little faith : for verily I say unto you , If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed , ye shall say unto this mountain , Remove hence to yonder place ; and it shall remove ; and nothing shall be impossible unto you . [ c ]
ASV	Matthew	17	22	And while they [ d ] abode in Galilee , Jesus said unto them , The Son of man shall be [ e ] delivered up into the hands of men ;
ASV	Matthew	17	23	and they shall kill him , and the third day he shall be raised up . And they were exceeding sorry .
ASV	Matthew	17	24	And when they were come to Capernaum , they that received the [ f ] half-shekel came to Peter , and said , Doth not your teacher pay the [ g ] half-shekel ?
ASV	Matthew	17	25	He saith , Yea . And when he came into the house , Jesus spake first to him , saying , What thinkest thou , Simon ? the kings of the earth , from whom do they receive toll or tribute ? from their sons , or from strangers ?
ASV	Matthew	17	26	And when he said , From strangers , Jesus said unto him , Therefore the sons are free .
ASV	Matthew	17	27	But , lest we cause them to stumble , go thou to the sea , and cast a hook , and take up the fish that first cometh up ; and when thou hast opened his mouth , thou shalt find a [ h ] shekel : that take , and give unto them for me and thee .

ASV	Matthew	18	2	And he called to him a little child , and set him in the midst of them ,
ASV	Matthew	18	3	and said , Verily I say unto you , Except ye turn , and become as little children , ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven .
ASV	Matthew	18	4	Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child , the same is the [ b ] greatest in the kingdom of heaven .
ASV	Matthew	18	5	And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me :
ASV	Matthew	18	6	but whoso shall cause one of these little ones that believe on me to stumble , it is profitable for him that [ c ] a great millstone should be hanged about his neck , and that he should be sunk in the depth of the sea .
ASV	Matthew	18	7	Woe unto the world because of occasions of stumbling ! for it must needs be that the occasions come ; but woe to that man through whom the occasion cometh !
ASV	Matthew	18	8	And if thy hand or thy foot causeth thee to stumble , cut it off , and cast it from thee : it is good for thee to enter into life maimed or halt , rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into the eternal fire .
ASV	Matthew	18	9	And if thine eye causeth thee to stumble , pluck it out , and cast it from thee : it is good for thee to enter into life with one eye , rather than having two eyes to be cast into the [ d ] hell of fire .
ASV	Matthew	18	10	See that ye despise not one of these little ones : for I say unto you , that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father who is in heaven . [ e ]
ASV	Matthew	18	12	How think ye ? if any man have a hundred sheep , and one of them be gone astray , doth he not leave the ninety and nine , and go unto the mountains , and seek that which goeth astray ?
ASV	Matthew	18	13	And if so be that he find it , verily I say unto you , he rejoiceth over it more than over the ninety and nine which have not gone astray .
ASV	Matthew	18	14	Even so it is not [ f ] the will of [ g ] your Father who is in heaven , that one of these little ones should perish .
ASV	Matthew	18	15	And if thy brother sin [ h ] against thee , go , show him his fault between thee and him alone : if he hear thee , thou hast gained thy brother .
ASV	Matthew	18	16	But if he hear thee not , take with thee one or two more , that at the mouth of two witnesses or three every word may be established .
ASV	Matthew	18	17	And if he refuse to hear them , tell it unto the [ i ] church : and if he refuse to hear the [ j ] church also , let him be unto thee as the Gentile and the [ k ] publican .
ASV	Matthew	18	19	Again I say unto you , that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask , it [ l ] shall be done for them of my Father who is in heaven .
ASV	Matthew	18	20	For where two or three are gathered together in my name , there am I in the midst of them .
ASV	Matthew	18	21	Then came Peter and said to him , Lord , how oft shall my brother sin against me , and I forgive him ? until seven times ?
ASV	Matthew	18	22	Jesus saith unto him , I say not unto thee , Until seven times ; but , Until [ m ] seventy times seven .
ASV	Matthew	18	23	Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king , who would make a reckoning with his [ n ] servants .

ASV	Matthew	19	2	and great multitudes followed him ; and he healed them there .
ASV	Matthew	19	3	And there came unto him [ a ] Pharisees , trying him , and saying , Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause ?
ASV	Matthew	19	4	And he answered and said , Have ye not read , [ b ] that he who [ c ] made them from the beginning made them male and female ,
ASV	Matthew	19	5	and said , [ d ] For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother , and shall cleave to his wife ; and the two shall become one flesh ?
ASV	Matthew	19	6	So that they are no more two , but one flesh . What therefore God hath joined together , let not man put asunder .
ASV	Matthew	19	7	They say unto him , [ e ] Why then did Moses command to give a bill of divorcement , and to put her away ?
ASV	Matthew	19	8	He saith unto them , Moses for your hardness of heart suffered you to put away your wives : but from the beginning it hath not been so .
ASV	Matthew	19	9	And I say unto you , Whosoever shall put away his wife , [ f ] except for fornication , and shall marry another , committeth adultery : [ g ] and he that marrieth her when she is put away committeth adultery .
ASV	Matthew	19	10	The disciples say unto him , If the case of the man is so with his wife , it is not expedient to marry .
ASV	Matthew	19	11	But he said unto them , Not all men can receive this saying , but they to whom it is given .
ASV	Matthew	19	12	For there are eunuchs , that were so born from their mother ’ s womb : and there are eunuchs , that were made eunuchs by men : and there are eunuchs , that made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven ’ s sake . He that is able to receive it , let him receive it .
ASV	Matthew	19	13	Then were there brought unto him little children , that he should lay his hands on them , and pray : and the disciples rebuked them .
ASV	Matthew	19	14	But Jesus said , Suffer the little children , and forbid them not , to come unto me : for [ h ] to such belongeth the kingdom of heaven .
ASV	Matthew	19	15	And he laid his hands on them , and departed thence .
ASV	Matthew	19	16	And behold , one came to him and said , [ i ] Teacher , what good thing shall I do , that I may have eternal life ?
ASV	Matthew	19	17	And he said unto him , [ j ] Why askest thou me concerning that which is good ? One there is who is good : but if thou wouldest enter into life , keep the commandments .
ASV	Matthew	19	18	He saith unto him , Which ? And Jesus said , [ k ] Thou shalt not kill , Thou shalt not commit adultery , Thou shalt not steal , Thou shalt not bear false witness ,
ASV	Matthew	19	20	The young man saith unto him , All these things have I observed : what lack I yet ?
ASV	Matthew	19	21	Jesus said unto him , If thou wouldest be perfect , go , sell that which thou hast , and give to the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in heaven : and come , follow me .
ASV	Matthew	19	22	But when the young man heard the saying , he went away sorrowful ; for he was one that had great possessions .
ASV	Matthew	19	23	And Jesus said unto his disciples , Verily I say unto you , It is hard for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven .
ASV	Matthew	19	24	And again I say unto you , It is easier for a camel to go through a needle ’ s eye , than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God .
ASV	Matthew	19	25	And when the disciples heard it , they were astonished exceedingly , saying , Who then can be saved ?
ASV	Matthew	19	26	And Jesus looking upon them said to them , With men this is impossible ; but with God all things are possible .
ASV	Matthew	19	27	Then answered Peter and said unto him , Lo , we have left all , and followed thee ; what then shall we have ?
ASV	Matthew	19	28	And Jesus said unto them , Verily I say unto you , that ye who have followed me , in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit on the throne of his glory , ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones , judging the twelve tribes of Israel .
ASV	Matthew	19	29	And every one that hath left houses , or brethren , or sisters , or father , or mother , [ m ] or children , or lands , for my name ’ s sake , shall receive [ n ] a hundredfold , and shall inherit eternal life .

ASV	Matthew	20	20	Then came to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee with her sons , [ g ] worshipping him , and asking a certain thing of him .
ASV	Matthew	20	1	For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that was a householder , who went out early in the morning to hire laborers into his vineyard .
ASV	Matthew	20	2	And when he had agreed with the laborers for a [ a ] shilling a day , he sent them into his vineyard .
ASV	Matthew	20	3	And he went out about the third hour , and saw others standing in the marketplace idle ;
ASV	Matthew	20	4	and to them he said , Go ye also into the vineyard , and whatsoever is right I will give you . And they went their way .
ASV	Matthew	20	5	Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour , and did likewise .
ASV	Matthew	20	6	And about the eleventh hour he went out , and found others standing ; and he saith unto them , Why stand ye here all the day idle ?
ASV	Matthew	20	7	They say unto him , Because no man hath hired us . He saith unto them , Go ye also into the vineyard .
ASV	Matthew	20	8	And when even was come , the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward , Call the laborers , and pay them their hire , beginning from the last unto the first .
ASV	Matthew	20	9	And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour , they received every man a [ b ] shilling .
ASV	Matthew	20	10	And when the first came , they supposed that they would receive more ; and they likewise received every man a [ c ] shilling .
ASV	Matthew	20	11	And when they received it , they murmured against the householder ,
ASV	Matthew	20	12	saying , These last have spent but one hour , and thou hast made them equal unto us , who have borne the burden of the day and the [ d ] scorching heat .
ASV	Matthew	20	13	But he answered and said to one of them , Friend , I do thee no wrong : didst not thou agree with me for a [ e ] shilling ?
ASV	Matthew	20	14	Take up that which is thine , and go thy way ; it is my will to give unto this last , even as unto thee .
ASV	Matthew	20	15	Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own ? or is thine eye evil , because I am good ?
ASV	Matthew	20	16	So the last shall be first , and the first last .
ASV	Matthew	20	17	And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem , he took the twelve disciples apart , and on the way he said unto them ,
ASV	Matthew	20	18	Behold , we go up to Jerusalem ; and the Son of man shall be [ f ] delivered unto the chief priests and scribes ; and they shall condemn him to death ,
ASV	Matthew	20	19	and shall deliver him unto the Gentiles to mock , and to scourge , and to crucify : and the third day he shall be raised up .
ASV	Matthew	20	21	And he said unto her , What wouldest thou ? She saith unto him , Command that these my two sons may sit , one on thy right hand , and one on thy left hand , in thy kingdom .
ASV	Matthew	20	22	But Jesus answered and said , Ye know not what ye ask . Are ye able to drink the cup that I am about to drink ? They say unto him , We are able .
ASV	Matthew	20	23	He saith unto them , My cup indeed ye shall drink : but to sit on my right hand , and on my left hand , is not mine to give ; but it is for them for whom it hath been prepared of my Father .
ASV	Matthew	20	24	And when the ten heard it , they were moved with indignation concerning the two brethren .
ASV	Matthew	20	25	But Jesus called them unto him , and said , Ye know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them , and their great ones exercise authority over them .
ASV	Matthew	20	26	Not so shall it be among you : but whosoever would become great among you shall be your [ h ] minister ;
ASV	Matthew	20	27	and whosoever would be first among you shall be your [ i ] servant :
ASV	Matthew	20	28	even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto , but to minister , and to give his life a ransom for many .
ASV	Matthew	20	29	And as they went out from Jericho , a great multitude followed him .
ASV	Matthew	20	30	And behold , two blind men sitting by the way side , when they heard that Jesus was passing by , cried out , saying , Lord , have mercy on us , thou son of David .
ASV	Matthew	20	31	And the multitude rebuked them , that they should hold their peace : but they cried out the more , saying , Lord , have mercy on us , thou son of David .
ASV	Matthew	20	32	And Jesus stood still , and called them , and said , What will ye that I should do unto you ?
ASV	Matthew	20	33	They say unto him , Lord , that our eyes may be opened .
ASV	Matthew	20	34	And Jesus , being moved with compassion , touched their eyes ; and straightway they received their sight , and followed him .

ASV	Matthew	21	21	And Jesus answered and said unto them , Verily I say unto you , If ye have faith , and doubt not , ye shall not only do what is done to the fig tree , but even if ye shall say unto this mountain , Be thou taken up and cast into the sea , it shall be done .
ASV	Matthew	21	2	saying unto them , Go into the village that is over against you , and straightway ye shall find an ass tied , and a colt with her : loose them , and bring them unto me .
ASV	Matthew	21	3	And if any one say aught unto you , ye shall say , The Lord hath need of them ; and straightway he will send them .
ASV	Matthew	21	4	Now this is come to pass , that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet , saying ,
ASV	Matthew	21	5	[ a ] Tell ye the daughter of Zion , Behold , thy King cometh unto thee , Meek , and riding upon an ass , And upon a colt the foal of an ass .
ASV	Matthew	21	6	And the disciples went , and did even as Jesus appointed them ,
ASV	Matthew	21	7	and brought the ass , and the colt , and put on them their garments ; and he sat thereon .
ASV	Matthew	21	8	And the most part of the multitude spread their garments in the way ; and others cut branches from the trees , and spread them in the way .
ASV	Matthew	21	9	And the multitudes that went before him , and that followed , cried , saying , Hosanna to the son of David : Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord ; Hosanna in the highest .
ASV	Matthew	21	10	And when he was come into Jerusalem , all the city was stirred , saying , Who is this ?
ASV	Matthew	21	11	And the multitudes said , This is the prophet , Jesus , from Nazareth of Galilee .
ASV	Matthew	21	12	And Jesus entered into the temple [ b ] of God , and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple , and overthrew the tables of the money-changers , and the seats of them that sold the doves ;
ASV	Matthew	21	13	and he saith unto them , It is written , [ c ] My house shall be called a house of prayer : [ d ] but ye make it a den of robbers .
ASV	Matthew	21	14	And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple ; and he healed them .
ASV	Matthew	21	15	But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did , and the children that were crying in the temple and saying , Hosanna to the son of David ; they were moved with indignation ,
ASV	Matthew	21	16	and said unto him , Hearest thou what these are saying ? And Jesus saith unto them , Yea : did ye never read , [ e ] Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise ?
ASV	Matthew	21	17	And he left them , and went forth out of the city to Bethany , and lodged there .
ASV	Matthew	21	18	Now in the morning as he returned to the city , he hungered .
ASV	Matthew	21	19	And seeing [ f ] a fig tree by the way side , he came to it , and found nothing thereon , but leaves only ; and he saith unto it , Let there be no fruit from thee henceforward for ever . And immediately the fig tree withered away .
ASV	Matthew	21	20	And when the disciples saw it , they marvelled , saying , How did the fig tree immediately wither away ?
ASV	Matthew	21	22	And all things , whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer , believing , ye shall receive .
ASV	Matthew	21	23	And when he was come into the temple , the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching , and said , By what authority doest thou these things ? and who gave thee this authority ?
ASV	Matthew	21	24	And Jesus answered and said unto them , I also will ask you one [ g ] question , which if ye tell me , I likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things .
ASV	Matthew	21	25	The baptism of John , whence was it ? from heaven or from men ? And they reasoned with themselves , saying , If we shall say , From heaven ; he will say unto us , Why then did ye not believe him ?
ASV	Matthew	21	26	But if we shall say , From men ; we fear the multitude ; for all hold John as a prophet .
ASV	Matthew	21	27	And they answered Jesus , and said , We know not . He also said unto them , Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things .
ASV	Matthew	21	28	But what think ye ? A man had two [ h ] sons ; and he came to the first , and said , [ i ] Son , go work to-day in the vineyard .
ASV	Matthew	21	29	And he answered and said , I will not : but afterward he repented himself , and went .
ASV	Matthew	21	30	And he came to the second , and said likewise . And he answered and said , I go , sir : and went not .
ASV	Matthew	21	31	Which of the two did the will of his father ? They say , The first . Jesus saith unto them , Verily I say unto you , that the [ j ] publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you .
ASV	Matthew	21	32	For John came unto you in the way of righteousness , and ye believed him not ; but the [ k ] publicans and the harlots believed him : and ye , when ye saw it , did not even repent yourselves afterward , that ye might believe him .
ASV	Matthew	21	33	Hear another parable : There was a man that was a householder , who planted a vineyard , and set a hedge about it , and digged a winepress in it , and built a tower , and let it out to husbandmen , and went into another country .
ASV	Matthew	21	34	And when the season of the fruits drew near , he sent his [ l ] servants to the husbandmen , to receive [ m ] his fruits .
ASV	Matthew	21	35	And the husbandmen took his [ n ] servants , and beat one , and killed another , and stoned another .
ASV	Matthew	21	36	Again , he sent other [ o ] servants more than the first : and they did unto them in like manner .
ASV	Matthew	21	37	But afterward he sent unto them his son , saying , They will reverence my son .
ASV	Matthew	21	38	But the husbandmen , when they saw the son , said among themselves , This is the heir ; come , let us kill him , and take his inheritance .
ASV	Matthew	21	39	And they took him , and cast him forth out of the vineyard , and killed him .
ASV	Matthew	21	40	When therefore the lord of the vineyard shall come , what will he do unto those husbandmen ?
ASV	Matthew	21	41	They say unto him , He will miserably destroy those miserable men , and will let out the vineyard unto other husbandmen , who shall render him the fruits in their seasons .
ASV	Matthew	21	42	Jesus saith unto them , Did ye never read in the scriptures , [ p ] The stone which the builders rejected , The same was made the head of the corner ; This was from the Lord , And it is marvellous in our eyes ?
ASV	Matthew	21	43	Therefore say I unto you , The kingdom of God shall be taken away from you , and shall be given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof .
ASV	Matthew	21	44	.

ASV	Matthew	22	22	And when they heard it , they marvelled , and left him , and went away .
ASV	Matthew	22	2	The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a certain king , who made a marriage feast for his son ,
ASV	Matthew	22	3	and sent forth his [ a ] servants to call them that were bidden to the marriage feast : and they would not come .
ASV	Matthew	22	4	Again he sent forth other [ b ] servants , saying , Tell them that are bidden , Behold , I have made ready my dinner ; my oxen and my fatlings are killed , and all things are ready : come to the marriage feast .
ASV	Matthew	22	5	But they made light of it , and went their ways , one to his own farm , another to his merchandise ;
ASV	Matthew	22	6	and the rest laid hold on his [ c ] servants , and treated them shamefully , and killed them .
ASV	Matthew	22	7	But the king was wroth ; and he sent his armies , and destroyed those murderers , and burned their city .
ASV	Matthew	22	8	Then saith he to his [ d ] servants , The wedding is ready , but they that were bidden were not worthy .
ASV	Matthew	22	9	Go ye therefore unto the partings of the highways , and as many as ye shall find , bid to the marriage feast .
ASV	Matthew	22	10	And those [ e ] servants went out into the highways , and gathered together all as many as they found , both bad and good : and the wedding was filled with guests .
ASV	Matthew	22	11	But when the king came in to behold the guests , he saw there a man who had not on a wedding-garment :
ASV	Matthew	22	12	and he saith unto him , Friend , how camest thou in hither not having a wedding-garment ? And he was speechless .
ASV	Matthew	22	13	Then the king said to the [ f ] servants , Bind him hand and foot , and cast him out into the outer darkness ; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth .
ASV	Matthew	22	14	For many are called , but few chosen .
ASV	Matthew	22	15	Then went the Pharisees , and took counsel how they might ensnare him in his talk .
ASV	Matthew	22	16	And they send to him their disciples , with the Herodians , saying , Teacher , we know that thou art true , and teachest the way of God in truth , and carest not for any one : for thou regardest not the person of men .
ASV	Matthew	22	17	Tell us therefore , What thinkest thou ? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar , or not ?
ASV	Matthew	22	18	But Jesus perceived their wickedness , and said , Why make ye trial of me , ye hypocrites ?
ASV	Matthew	22	19	Show me the tribute money . And they brought unto him a [ g ] denarius .
ASV	Matthew	22	20	And he saith unto them , Whose is this image and superscription ?
ASV	Matthew	22	21	They say unto him , Caesar ’ s . Then saith he unto them , Render therefore unto Caesar the things that are Caesar ’ s ; and unto God the things that are God ’ s .
ASV	Matthew	22	23	On that day there came to him Sadducees , [ h ] they that say that there is no resurrection : and they asked him ,
ASV	Matthew	22	24	saying , Teacher , Moses said , [ i ] If a man die , having no children , his brother [ j ] shall marry his wife , and raise up seed unto his brother .
ASV	Matthew	22	25	Now there were with us seven brethren : and the first married and deceased , and having no seed left his wife unto his brother ;
ASV	Matthew	22	26	in like manner the second also , and the third , unto the [ k ] seventh .
ASV	Matthew	22	27	And after them all , the woman died .
ASV	Matthew	22	28	In the resurrection therefore whose wife shall she be of the seven ? for they all had her .
ASV	Matthew	22	29	But Jesus answered and said unto them , Ye do err , not knowing the scriptures , nor the power of God .
ASV	Matthew	22	30	For in the resurrection they neither marry , nor are given in marriage , but are as angels [ l ] in heaven .
ASV	Matthew	22	31	But as touching the resurrection of the dead , have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God , saying ,
ASV	Matthew	22	32	[ m ] I am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ? God is not the God of the dead , but of the living .
ASV	Matthew	22	33	And when the multitudes heard it , they were astonished at his teaching .
ASV	Matthew	22	34	But the Pharisees , when they heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence , gathered themselves together .
ASV	Matthew	22	35	And one of them , a lawyer , asked him a question , trying him :
ASV	Matthew	22	36	Teacher , which is the great commandment in the law ?
ASV	Matthew	22	37	And he said unto him , [ n ] Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy mind .
ASV	Matthew	22	38	This is the great and first commandment .
ASV	Matthew	22	39	[ o ] And a second like unto it is this , [ p ] Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself .
ASV	Matthew	22	40	On these two commandments the whole law hangeth , and the prophets .
ASV	Matthew	22	41	Now while the Pharisees were gathered together , Jesus asked them a question ,
ASV	Matthew	22	42	saying , What think ye of the Christ ? whose son is he ? They say unto him , The son of David .
ASV	Matthew	22	43	He saith unto them , How then doth David in the Spirit call him Lord , saying ,
ASV	Matthew	22	44	[ q ] The Lord said unto my Lord , Sit thou on my right hand , Till I put thine enemies underneath thy feet ?
ASV	Matthew	22	45	If David then calleth him Lord , how is he his son ?
ASV	Matthew	22	46	And no one was able to answer him a word , neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions .

ASV	Matthew	23	23	Woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye tithe mint and [ n ] anise and cummin , and have left undone the weightier matters of the law , justice , and mercy , and faith : but these ye ought to have done , and not to have left the other undone .
ASV	Matthew	23	2	saying , The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses ’ seat :
ASV	Matthew	23	3	all things therefore whatsoever they bid you , these do and observe : but do not ye after their works ; for they say , and do not .
ASV	Matthew	23	4	Yea , they bind heavy burdens [ a ] and grievous to be borne , and lay them on men ’ s shoulders ; but they themselves will not move them with their finger .
ASV	Matthew	23	5	But all their works they do to be seen of men : for they make broad their phylacteries , and enlarge the borders of their garments ,
ASV	Matthew	23	6	and love the chief place at feasts , and the chief seats in the synagogues ,
ASV	Matthew	23	7	and the salutations in the marketplaces , and to be called of men , Rabbi .
ASV	Matthew	23	8	But be not ye called Rabbi : for one is your teacher , and all ye are brethren .
ASV	Matthew	23	9	And call no man your father on the earth : for one is your Father , [ b ] even he who is in heaven .
ASV	Matthew	23	10	Neither be ye called masters : for one is your master , even the Christ .
ASV	Matthew	23	11	But he that is [ c ] greatest among you shall be your [ d ] servant .
ASV	Matthew	23	12	, verse
ASV	Matthew	23	13	But woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! because ye shut the kingdom of heaven [ e ] against men : for ye enter not in yourselves , neither suffer ye them that are entering in to enter . [ f ]
ASV	Matthew	23	15	Woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte ; and when he is become so , ye make him twofold more a son of [ g ] hell than yourselves .
ASV	Matthew	23	16	Woe unto you , ye blind guides , that say , Whosoever shall swear by the [ h ] temple , it is nothing ; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the [ i ] temple , he is [ j ] a debtor .
ASV	Matthew	23	17	Ye fools and blind : for which is greater , the gold , or the [ k ] temple that hath sanctified the gold ?
ASV	Matthew	23	18	And , Whosoever shall swear by the altar , it is nothing ; but whosoever shall swear by the gift that is upon it , he is [ l ] a debtor .
ASV	Matthew	23	19	Ye blind : for which is greater , the gift , or the altar that sanctifieth the gift ?
ASV	Matthew	23	20	He therefore that sweareth by the altar , sweareth by it , and by all things thereon .
ASV	Matthew	23	21	And he that sweareth by the [ m ] temple , sweareth by it , and by him that dwelleth therein .
ASV	Matthew	23	22	And he that sweareth by the heaven , sweareth by the throne of God , and by him that sitteth thereon .
ASV	Matthew	23	24	Ye blind guides , that strain out the gnat , and swallow the camel !
ASV	Matthew	23	25	Woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter , but within they are full from extortion and excess .
ASV	Matthew	23	26	Thou blind Pharisee , cleanse first the inside of the cup and of the platter , that the outside thereof may become clean also .
ASV	Matthew	23	27	Woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres , which outwardly appear beautiful , but inwardly are full of dead men ’ s bones , and of all uncleanness .
ASV	Matthew	23	28	Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men , but inwardly ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity .
ASV	Matthew	23	29	Woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets , and garnish the tombs of the righteous ,
ASV	Matthew	23	30	and say , If we had been in the days of our fathers , we should not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets .
ASV	Matthew	23	31	Wherefore ye witness to yourselves , that ye are sons of them that slew the prophets .
ASV	Matthew	23	32	Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers .
ASV	Matthew	23	33	Ye serpents , ye offspring of vipers , how shall ye escape the judgment of [ o ] hell ?
ASV	Matthew	23	34	Therefore , behold , I send unto you prophets , and wise men , and scribes : some of them shall ye kill and crucify ; and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues , and persecute from city to city :

ASV	Matthew	23	36	Verily I say unto you , All these things shall come upon this generation .
ASV	Matthew	23	37	O Jerusalem , Jerusalem , that killeth the prophets , and stoneth them that are sent unto her ! how often would I have gathered thy children together , even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings , and ye would not !
ASV	Matthew	23	38	Behold , your house is left unto you [ p ] desolate .
ASV	Matthew	23	39	For I say unto you , Ye shall not see me henceforth , till ye shall say , Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord .

See Mk . 12:40 ; Lk . 20:47 . - Matthew 23:15 Greek Gehenna . - Matthew 23:16 Or , sanctuary : as in verse
ASV	Matthew	24	24	For there shall arise false Christs , and false prophets , and shall show great signs and wonders ; so as to lead astray , if possible , even the elect .
ASV	Matthew	24	2	But he answered and said unto them , See ye not all these things ? verily I say unto you , There shall not be left here one stone upon another , that shall not be thrown down .
ASV	Matthew	24	3	And as he sat on the mount of Olives , the disciples came unto him privately , saying , Tell us , when shall these things be ? and what shall be the sign of thy [ a ] coming , and of [ b ] the end of the world ?
ASV	Matthew	24	4	And Jesus answered and said unto them , Take heed that no man lead you astray .
ASV	Matthew	24	5	For many shall come in my name , saying , I am the Christ ; and shall lead many astray .
ASV	Matthew	24	6	And ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars ; see that ye be not troubled : for these things must needs come to pass ; but the end is not yet .
ASV	Matthew	24	7	For nation shall rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom ; and there shall be famines and earthquakes in divers places .
ASV	Matthew	24	8	But all these things are the beginning of travail .
ASV	Matthew	24	9	Then shall they deliver you up unto tribulation , and shall kill you : and ye shall be hated of all the nations for my name ’ s sake .
ASV	Matthew	24	10	And then shall many stumble , and shall [ c ] deliver up one another , and shall hate one another .
ASV	Matthew	24	11	And many false prophets shall arise , and shall lead many astray .
ASV	Matthew	24	12	And because iniquity shall be multiplied , the love of the many shall wax cold .
ASV	Matthew	24	13	But he that endureth to the end , the same shall be saved .
ASV	Matthew	24	14	And [ d ] this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole [ e ] world for a testimony unto all the nations ; and then shall the end come .
ASV	Matthew	24	15	When therefore ye see the abomination of desolation , which was [ f ] spoken of through Daniel the prophet , standing in [ g ] the holy place ( let him that readeth understand ) ,
ASV	Matthew	24	16	then let them that are in Judaea flee unto the mountains :
ASV	Matthew	24	17	let him that is on the housetop not go down to take out the things that are in his house :
ASV	Matthew	24	18	and let him that is in the field not return back to take his cloak .
ASV	Matthew	24	19	But woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days !
ASV	Matthew	24	20	And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter , neither on a sabbath :
ASV	Matthew	24	21	for then shall be great tribulation , such as hath not been from the beginning of the world until now , no , nor ever shall be .
ASV	Matthew	24	22	And except those days had been shortened , no flesh would have been saved : but for the elect ’ s sake those days shall be shortened .
ASV	Matthew	24	23	Then if any man shall say unto you , Lo , here is the Christ , or , Here ; believe [ h ] it not .
ASV	Matthew	24	25	Behold , I have told you beforehand .
ASV	Matthew	24	26	If therefore they shall say unto you , Behold , he is in the wilderness ; go not forth : Behold , he is in the inner chambers ; believe [ i ] it not .
ASV	Matthew	24	27	For as the lightning cometh forth from the east , and is seen even unto the west ; so shall be the [ j ] coming of the Son of man .
ASV	Matthew	24	28	Wheresoever the carcase is , there will the [ k ] eagles be gathered together .
ASV	Matthew	24	29	But immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun shall be darkened , and the moon shall not give her light , and the stars shall fall from heaven , and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken :
ASV	Matthew	24	30	and then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven : and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn , and they shall see the Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory .
ASV	Matthew	24	31	And he shall send forth his angels [ l ] with [ m ] a great sound of a trumpet , and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds , from one end of heaven to the other .
ASV	Matthew	24	32	Now from the fig tree learn her parable : when her branch is now become tender , and putteth forth its leaves , ye know that the summer is nigh ;
ASV	Matthew	24	33	even so ye also , when ye see all these things , know ye that [ n ] he is nigh , even at the doors .
ASV	Matthew	24	34	Verily I say unto you , This generation shall not pass away , till all these things be accomplished .
ASV	Matthew	24	35	Heaven and earth shall pass away , but my words shall not pass away .
ASV	Matthew	24	36	But of that day and hour knoweth no one , not even the angels of heaven , [ o ] neither the Son , but the Father only .
ASV	Matthew	24	37	And as were the days of Noah , so shall be the [ p ] coming of the Son of man .
ASV	Matthew	24	38	For as in those days which were before the flood they were eating and drinking , marrying and giving in marriage , until the day that Noah entered into the ark ,
ASV	Matthew	24	39	and they knew not until the flood came , and took them all away ; so shall be the [ q ] coming of the Son of man .
ASV	Matthew	24	40	Then shall two men be in the field ; one is taken , and one is left :
ASV	Matthew	24	41	two women shall be grinding at the mill ; one is taken , and one is left .
ASV	Matthew	24	42	Watch therefore : for ye know not on what day your Lord cometh .
ASV	Matthew	24	43	[ r ] But know this , that if the master of the house had known in what watch the thief was coming , he would have watched , and would not have suffered his house to be [ s ] broken through .
ASV	Matthew	24	44	Therefore be ye also ready ; for in an hour that ye think not the Son of man cometh .
ASV	Matthew	24	45	Who then is the faithful and wise [ t ] servant , whom his lord hath set over his household , to give them their food in due season ?
ASV	Matthew	24	46	Blessed is that [ u ] servant , whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing .
ASV	Matthew	24	47	Verily I say unto you , that he will set him over all that he hath .
ASV	Matthew	24	48	But if that evil [ v ] servant shall say in his heart , My lord tarrieth ;
ASV	Matthew	24	49	and shall begin to beat his fellow-servants , and shall eat and drink with the drunken ;
ASV	Matthew	24	50	the lord of that [ w ] servant shall come in a day when he expecteth not , and in an hour when he knoweth not ,
ASV	Matthew	24	51	and shall [ x ] cut him asunder , and appoint his portion with the hypocrites : there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth .

ASV	Matthew	25	25	and I was afraid , and went away and hid thy talent in the earth : lo , thou hast thine own .
ASV	Matthew	25	2	And five of them were foolish , and five were wise .
ASV	Matthew	25	3	For the foolish , when they took their [ b ] lamps , took no oil with them :
ASV	Matthew	25	4	but the wise took oil in their vessels with their [ c ] lamps .
ASV	Matthew	25	5	Now while the bridegroom tarried , they all slumbered and slept .
ASV	Matthew	25	6	But at midnight there is a cry , Behold , the bridegroom ! Come ye forth to meet him .
ASV	Matthew	25	7	Then all those virgins arose , and trimmed their [ d ] lamps .
ASV	Matthew	25	8	And the foolish said unto the wise , Give us of your oil ; for our [ e ] lamps are going out .
ASV	Matthew	25	9	But the wise answered , saying , Peradventure there will not be enough for us and you : go ye rather to them that sell , and buy for yourselves .
ASV	Matthew	25	10	And while they went away to buy , the bridegroom came ; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage feast : and the door was shut .
ASV	Matthew	25	11	Afterward came also the other virgins , saying , Lord , Lord , open to us .
ASV	Matthew	25	12	But he answered and said , Verily I say unto you , I know you not .
ASV	Matthew	25	13	Watch therefore , for ye know not the day nor the hour .
ASV	Matthew	25	14	For it is as when a man , going into another country , called his own [ f ] servants , and delivered unto them his goods .
ASV	Matthew	25	15	And unto one he gave five talents , to another two , to another one ; to each according to his several ability ; and he went on his journey .
ASV	Matthew	25	16	Straightway he that received the five talents went and traded with them , and made other five talents .
ASV	Matthew	25	17	In like manner he also that received the two gained other two .
ASV	Matthew	25	18	But he that received the one went away and digged in the earth , and hid his lord ’ s money .
ASV	Matthew	25	19	Now after a long time the lord of those [ g ] servants cometh , and maketh a reckoning with them .
ASV	Matthew	25	20	And he that received the five talents came and brought other five talents , saying , Lord , thou deliveredst unto me five talents : lo , I have gained other five talents .
ASV	Matthew	25	21	His lord said unto him , Well done , good and faithful [ h ] servant : thou hast been faithful over a few things , I will set thee over many things ; enter thou into the joy of thy lord .
ASV	Matthew	25	22	And he also that received the two talents came and said , Lord , thou deliveredst unto me two talents : lo , I have gained other two talents .
ASV	Matthew	25	23	His lord said unto him , Well done , good and faithful [ i ] servant : thou hast been faithful over a few things , I will set thee over many things ; enter thou into the joy of thy lord .
ASV	Matthew	25	24	And he also that had received the one talent came and said , Lord , I knew thee that thou art a hard man , reaping where thou didst not sow , and gathering where thou didst not scatter ;
ASV	Matthew	25	26	But his lord answered and said unto him , Thou wicked and slothful [ j ] servant , thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not , and gather where I did not scatter ;
ASV	Matthew	25	27	thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the bankers , and at my coming I should have received back mine own with interest .
ASV	Matthew	25	28	Take ye away therefore the talent from him , and give it unto him that hath the ten talents .
ASV	Matthew	25	29	For unto every one that hath shall be given , and he shall have abundance : but from him that hath not , even that which he hath shall be taken away .
ASV	Matthew	25	30	And cast ye out the unprofitable [ k ] servant into the outer darkness : there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth .
ASV	Matthew	25	31	But when the Son of man shall come in his glory , and all the angels with him , then shall he sit on the throne of his glory :
ASV	Matthew	25	32	and before him shall be gathered all the nations : and he shall separate them one from another , as the shepherd separateth the sheep from the goats ;
ASV	Matthew	25	33	and he shall set the sheep on his right hand , but the goats on the left .
ASV	Matthew	25	34	Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand , Come , ye blessed of my Father , inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world :
ASV	Matthew	25	35	for I was hungry , and ye gave me to eat ; I was thirsty , and ye gave me drink ; I was a stranger , and ye took me in ;
ASV	Matthew	25	36	naked , and ye clothed me ; I was sick , and ye visited me ; I was in prison , and ye came unto me .
ASV	Matthew	25	37	Then shall the righteous answer him , saying , Lord , when saw we thee hungry , and fed thee ? or athirst , and gave thee drink ?
ASV	Matthew	25	38	And when saw we thee a stranger , and took thee in ? or naked , and clothed thee ?
ASV	Matthew	25	39	And when saw we thee sick , or in prison , and came unto thee ?
ASV	Matthew	25	40	And the King shall answer and say unto them , Verily I say unto you , Inasmuch as ye did it unto one of these my brethren , even these least , ye did it unto me .
ASV	Matthew	25	41	Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand , [ l ] Depart from me , ye cursed , into the eternal fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels :
ASV	Matthew	25	42	for I was hungry , and ye did not give me to eat ; I was thirsty , and ye gave me no drink ;
ASV	Matthew	25	43	I was a stranger , and ye took me not in ; naked , and ye clothed me not ; sick , and in prison , and ye visited me not .
ASV	Matthew	25	44	Then shall they also answer , saying , Lord , when saw we thee hungry , or athirst , or a stranger , or naked , or sick , or in prison , and did not minister unto thee ?
ASV	Matthew	25	45	Then shall he answer them , saying , Verily I say unto you , Inasmuch as ye did it not unto one of these least , ye did it not unto me .
ASV	Matthew	25	46	And these shall go away into eternal punishment : but the righteous into eternal life .

ASV	Matthew	26	3	Then were gathered together the chief priests , and the elders of the people , unto the court of the high priest , who was called Caiaphas ;
ASV	Matthew	26	4	and they took counsel together that they might take Jesus by subtlety , and kill him .
ASV	Matthew	26	5	But they said , Not during the feast , lest a tumult arise among the people .
ASV	Matthew	26	6	Now when Jesus was in Bethany , in the house of Simon the leper ,
ASV	Matthew	26	7	there came unto him a woman having [ b ] an alabaster cruse of exceeding precious ointment , and she poured it upon his head , as [ c ] he sat at meat .
ASV	Matthew	26	8	But when the disciples saw it , they had indignation , saying , To what purpose is this waste ?
ASV	Matthew	26	9	For this ointment might have been sold for much , and given to the poor .
ASV	Matthew	26	10	But Jesus perceiving it said unto them , Why trouble ye the woman ? for she hath wrought a good work upon me .
ASV	Matthew	26	11	For ye have the poor always with you ; but me ye have not always .
ASV	Matthew	26	12	For in that she [ d ] poured this ointment upon my body , she did it to prepare me for burial .
ASV	Matthew	26	13	Verily I say unto you , Wheresoever [ e ] this gospel shall be preached in the whole world , that also which this woman hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her .
ASV	Matthew	26	14	Then one of the twelve , who was called Judas Iscariot , went unto the chief priests ,
ASV	Matthew	26	15	and said , What are ye willing to give me , and I will [ f ] deliver him unto you ? And they weighed unto him thirty pieces of silver .
ASV	Matthew	26	16	And from that time he sought opportunity to [ g ] deliver him unto them .
ASV	Matthew	26	17	Now on the first day of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus , saying , Where wilt thou that we make ready for thee to eat the passover ?
ASV	Matthew	26	18	And he said , Go into the city to such a man , and say unto him , The Teacher saith , My time is at hand ; I keep the passover at thy house with my disciples .
ASV	Matthew	26	19	And the disciples did as Jesus appointed them ; and they made ready the passover .
ASV	Matthew	26	20	Now when even was come , he was [ h ] sitting at meat with the twelve [ i ] disciples ;
ASV	Matthew	26	21	and as they were eating , he said , Verily I say unto you , that one of you shall [ j ] betray me .
ASV	Matthew	26	22	And they were exceeding sorrowful , and began to say unto him every one , Is it I , Lord ?
ASV	Matthew	26	23	And he answered and said , He that dipped his hand with me in the dish , the same shall [ k ] betray me .
ASV	Matthew	26	24	The Son of man goeth , even as it is written of him : but woe unto that man through whom the Son of man is [ l ] betrayed ! good were it [ m ] for that man if he had not been born .
ASV	Matthew	26	25	And Judas , who [ n ] betrayed him , answered and said , Is it I , Rabbi ? He saith unto him , Thou hast said .
ASV	Matthew	26	27	And he took [ p ] a cup , and gave thanks , and gave to them , saying , Drink ye all of it ;
ASV	Matthew	26	28	for this is my blood of the [ q ] covenant , which is poured out for many unto remission of sins .
ASV	Matthew	26	29	But I say unto you , I shall not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine , until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father ’ s kingdom .
ASV	Matthew	26	30	And when they had sung a hymn , they went out into the mount of Olives .
ASV	Matthew	26	31	Then saith Jesus unto them , All ye shall be offended in me this night : for it is written , [ r ] I will smite the shepherd , and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad .
ASV	Matthew	26	32	But after I am raised up , I will go before you into Galilee .
ASV	Matthew	26	33	But Peter answered and said unto him , If all shall be [ s ] offended in thee , I will never be [ t ] offended .
ASV	Matthew	26	34	Jesus said unto him , Verily I say unto thee , that this night , before the cock crow , thou shalt deny me thrice .
ASV	Matthew	26	35	Peter saith unto him , Even if I must die with thee , yet will I not deny thee . Likewise also said all the disciples .
ASV	Matthew	26	36	Then cometh Jesus with them unto [ u ] a place called Gethsemane , and saith unto his disciples , Sit ye here , while I go yonder and pray .
ASV	Matthew	26	37	And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee , and began to be sorrowful and sore troubled .
ASV	Matthew	26	38	Then saith he unto them , My soul is exceeding sorrowful , even unto death : abide ye here , and watch with me .
ASV	Matthew	26	39	And he went forward a little , and fell on his face , and prayed , saying , My Father , if it be possible , let this cup pass away from me : nevertheless , not as I will , but as thou wilt .
ASV	Matthew	26	40	And he cometh unto the disciples , and findeth them sleeping , and saith unto Peter , What , could ye not watch with me one hour ?
ASV	Matthew	26	41	[ v ] Watch and pray , that ye enter not into temptation : the spirit indeed is willing , but the flesh is weak .
ASV	Matthew	26	42	Again a second time he went away , and prayed , saying , My Father , if this can not pass away , except I drink it , thy will be done .
ASV	Matthew	26	43	And he came again and found them sleeping , for their eyes were heavy .
ASV	Matthew	26	44	And he left them again , and went away , and prayed a third time , saying again the same words .
ASV	Matthew	26	45	Then cometh he to the disciples , and saith unto them , [ w ] Sleep on now , and take your rest : behold , the hour is at hand , and the Son of man is [ x ] betrayed into the hands of sinners .
ASV	Matthew	26	46	Arise , let us be going : behold , he is at hand that [ y ] betrayeth me .
ASV	Matthew	26	47	And while he yet spake , lo , Judas , one of the twelve , came , and with him a great multitude with swords and staves , from the chief priests and elders of the people .
ASV	Matthew	26	48	Now he that [ z ] betrayed him gave them a sign , saying , Whomsoever I shall kiss , that is he : take him .
ASV	Matthew	26	49	And straightway he came to Jesus , and said , Hail , Rabbi ; and [ aa ] kissed him .
ASV	Matthew	26	50	And Jesus said unto him , Friend , do that for which thou art come . Then they came and laid hands on Jesus , and took him .
ASV	Matthew	26	51	And behold , one of them that were with Jesus stretched out his hand , and drew his sword , and smote the [ ab ] servant of the high priest , and struck off his ear .
ASV	Matthew	26	52	Then saith Jesus unto him , Put up again thy sword into its place : for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword .
ASV	Matthew	26	53	Or thinkest thou that I can not beseech my Father , and he shall even now send me more than twelve legions of angels ?
ASV	Matthew	26	54	How then should the scriptures be fulfilled , that thus it must be ?
ASV	Matthew	26	55	In that hour said Jesus to the multitudes , Are ye come out as against a robber with swords and staves to seize me ? I sat daily in the temple teaching , and ye took me not .
ASV	Matthew	26	56	But all this is come to pass , that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled . Then all the disciples left him , and fled .
ASV	Matthew	26	57	And they that had taken Jesus led him away to the house of Caiaphas the high priest , where the scribes and the elders were gathered together .
ASV	Matthew	26	58	But Peter followed him afar off , unto the court of the high priest , and entered in , and sat with the officers , to see the end .
ASV	Matthew	26	59	Now the chief priests and the whole council sought false witness against Jesus , that they might put him to death ;
ASV	Matthew	26	60	and they found it not , though many false witnesses came . But afterward came two ,
ASV	Matthew	26	61	and said , This man said , I am able to destroy the [ ac ] temple of God , and to build it in three days .
ASV	Matthew	26	62	And the high priest stood up , and said unto him , Answerest thou nothing ? what is it which these witness against thee ?
ASV	Matthew	26	63	But Jesus held his peace . And the high priest said unto him , I adjure thee by the living God , that thou tell us whether thou art the Christ , the Son of God .
ASV	Matthew	26	64	Jesus saith unto him , Thou hast said : nevertheless I say unto you , Henceforth ye shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of Power , and coming on the clouds of heaven .
ASV	Matthew	26	65	Then the high priest rent his garments , saying , He hath spoken blasphemy : what further need have we of witnesses ? behold , now ye have heard the blasphemy :
ASV	Matthew	26	66	what think ye ? They answered and said , He is [ ad ] worthy of death .
ASV	Matthew	26	67	Then did they spit in his face and buffet him : and some smote him [ ae ] with the palms of their hands ,
ASV	Matthew	26	68	saying , Prophesy unto us , thou Christ : who is he that struck thee ?
ASV	Matthew	26	69	Now Peter was sitting without in the court : and a maid came unto him , saying , Thou also wast with Jesus the Galilaean .
ASV	Matthew	26	70	But he denied before them all , saying , I know not what thou sayest .
ASV	Matthew	26	71	And when he was gone out into the porch , another maid saw him , and saith unto them that were there , This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth .
ASV	Matthew	26	72	And again he denied with an oath , I know not the man .
ASV	Matthew	26	73	And after a little while they that stood by came and said to Peter , Of a truth thou also art one of them ; for thy speech maketh thee known .
ASV	Matthew	26	74	Then began he to curse and to swear , I know not the man . And straightway the cock crew .
ASV	Matthew	26	75	And Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said , Before the cock crow , thou shalt deny me thrice . And he went out , and wept bitterly .

ASV	Matthew	27	27	Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the [ k ] Praetorium , and gathered unto him the whole [ l ] band .
ASV	Matthew	27	2	and they bound him , and led him away , and delivered him up to Pilate the governor .
ASV	Matthew	27	3	Then Judas , who [ a ] betrayed him , when he saw that he was condemned , repented himself , and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders ,
ASV	Matthew	27	4	saying , I have sinned in that I [ b ] betrayed [ c ] innocent blood . But they said , What is that to us ? see thou to it .
ASV	Matthew	27	5	And he cast down the pieces of silver into the sanctuary , and departed ; and he went away and hanged himself .
ASV	Matthew	27	6	And the chief priests took the pieces of silver , and said , It is not lawful to put them into the [ d ] treasury , since it is the price of blood .
ASV	Matthew	27	7	And they took counsel , and bought with them the potter ’ s field , to bury strangers in .
ASV	Matthew	27	8	Wherefore that field was called , The field of blood , unto this day .
ASV	Matthew	27	9	Then was fulfilled that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet , saying , [ e ] And [ f ] they took the thirty pieces of silver , the price of him that was priced , [ g ] whom certain of the children of Israel did price ;
ASV	Matthew	27	10	and [ h ] they gave them for the potter ’ s field , as the Lord appointed me .
ASV	Matthew	27	11	Now Jesus stood before the governor : and the governor asked him , saying , Art thou the King of the Jews ? And Jesus said unto him , Thou sayest .
ASV	Matthew	27	12	And when he was accused by the chief priests and elders , he answered nothing .

ASV	Matthew	27	14	And he gave him no answer , not even to one word : insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly .
ASV	Matthew	27	15	Now at [ i ] the feast the governor was wont to release unto the multitude one prisoner , whom they would .
ASV	Matthew	27	16	And they had then a notable prisoner , called Barabbas .
ASV	Matthew	27	17	When therefore they were gathered together , Pilate said unto them , Whom will ye that I release unto you ? Barabbas , or Jesus who is called Christ ?
ASV	Matthew	27	18	For he knew that for envy they had delivered him up .
ASV	Matthew	27	19	And while he was sitting on the judgment-seat , his wife sent unto him , saying , Have thou nothing to do with that righteous man ; for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him .
ASV	Matthew	27	20	Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes that they should ask for Barabbas , and destroy Jesus .
ASV	Matthew	27	21	But the governor answered and said unto them , Which of the two will ye that I release unto you ? And they said , Barabbas .
ASV	Matthew	27	22	Pilate saith unto them , What then shall I do unto Jesus who is called Christ ? They all say , Let him be crucified .
ASV	Matthew	27	23	And he said , Why , what evil hath he done ? But they cried out exceedingly , saying , Let him be crucified .
ASV	Matthew	27	24	So when Pilate saw that he prevailed nothing , but rather that a tumult was arising , he took water , and washed his hands before the multitude , saying , I am innocent [ j ] of the blood of this righteous man ; see ye to it .
ASV	Matthew	27	25	And all the people answered and said , His blood be on us , and on our children .
ASV	Matthew	27	26	Then released he unto them Barabbas ; but Jesus he scourged and delivered to be crucified .
ASV	Matthew	27	28	And they [ m ] stripped him , and put on him a scarlet robe .
ASV	Matthew	27	29	And they platted a crown of thorns and put it upon his head , and a reed in his right hand ; and they kneeled down before him , and mocked him , saying , Hail , King of the Jews !
ASV	Matthew	27	30	And they spat upon him , and took the reed and smote him on the head .
ASV	Matthew	27	31	And when they had mocked him , they took off from him the robe , and put on him his garments , and led him away to crucify him .
ASV	Matthew	27	32	And as they came out , they found a man of Cyrene , Simon by name : him they [ n ] compelled to go with them , that he might bear his cross .
ASV	Matthew	27	33	And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha , that is to say , The place of a skull ,
ASV	Matthew	27	34	they gave him wine to drink mingled with gall : and when he had tasted it , he would not drink .
ASV	Matthew	27	35	And when they had crucified him , they parted his garments among them , casting lots ;
ASV	Matthew	27	36	and they sat and watched him there .
ASV	Matthew	27	37	And they set up over his head his accusation written , This is Jesus the King of the Jews .
ASV	Matthew	27	38	Then are there crucified with him two robbers , one on the right hand and one on the left .
ASV	Matthew	27	39	And they that passed by railed on him , wagging their heads ,
ASV	Matthew	27	40	and saying , Thou that destroyest the [ o ] temple , and buildest it in three days , save thyself : if thou art the Son of God , come down from the cross .
ASV	Matthew	27	41	In like manner also the chief priests mocking him , with the scribes and elders , said ,
ASV	Matthew	27	42	He saved others ; [ p ] himself he can not save . He is the King of Israel ; let him now come down from the cross , and we will believe on him .
ASV	Matthew	27	43	He trusteth on God ; let him deliver him now , if he desireth him : for he said , I am the Son of God .
ASV	Matthew	27	44	And the robbers also that were crucified with him cast upon him the same reproach .
ASV	Matthew	27	45	Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the [ q ] land until the ninth hour .
ASV	Matthew	27	46	And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice , saying , [ r ] Eli , Eli , lama sabachthani ? that is , My God , my God , [ s ] why hast thou forsaken me ?
ASV	Matthew	27	47	And some of them that stood there , when they heard it , said , This man calleth Elijah .
ASV	Matthew	27	48	And straightway one of them ran , and took a sponge , and filled it with vinegar , and put it on a reed , and gave him to drink .
ASV	Matthew	27	49	And the rest said , Let be ; let us see whether Elijah cometh to save him . [ t ]
ASV	Matthew	27	50	And Jesus cried again with a loud voice , and yielded up his spirit .
ASV	Matthew	27	51	And behold , the veil of the [ u ] temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom ; and the earth did quake ; and the rocks were rent ;
ASV	Matthew	27	52	and the tombs were opened ; and many bodies of the saints that had fallen asleep were raised ;
ASV	Matthew	27	53	and coming forth out of the tombs after his resurrection they entered into the holy city and appeared unto many .
ASV	Matthew	27	54	Now the centurion , and they that were with him watching Jesus , when they saw the earthquake , and the things that were done , feared exceedingly , saying , Truly this was [ v ] the Son of God .
ASV	Matthew	27	55	And many women were there beholding from afar , who had followed Jesus from Galilee , ministering unto him :
ASV	Matthew	27	56	among whom was Mary Magdalene , and Mary the mother of [ w ] James and Joses , and the mother of the sons of Zebedee .
ASV	Matthew	27	57	And when even was come , there came a rich man from Arimathaea , named Joseph , who also himself was Jesus ’ disciple :
ASV	Matthew	27	58	this man went to Pilate , and asked for the body of Jesus . Then Pilate commanded it to be given up .
ASV	Matthew	27	59	And Joseph took the body , and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth ,
ASV	Matthew	27	60	and laid it in his own new tomb , which he had hewn out in the rock : and he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb , and departed .
ASV	Matthew	27	61	And Mary Magdalene was there , and the other Mary , sitting over against the sepulchre .
ASV	Matthew	27	62	Now on the morrow , which is the day after the Preparation , the chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered together unto Pilate ,
ASV	Matthew	27	63	saying , Sir , we remember that that deceiver said while he was yet alive , After three days I rise again .
ASV	Matthew	27	64	Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day , lest haply his disciples come and steal him away , and say unto the people , He is risen from the dead : and the last error will be worse than the first .
ASV	Matthew	27	65	Pilate said unto them , [ x ] Ye have a guard : go , [ y ] make it as sure as ye can .
ASV	Matthew	27	66	So they went , and made the sepulchre sure , sealing the stone , the guard being with them .

Compare Mk . 7:11 . - Matthew 27:9 Zech . 11:12 ,
ASV	Matthew	28	28	Now late on the sabbath day , as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week , came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre .
ASV	Matthew	28	2	And behold , there was a great earthquake ; for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven , and came and rolled away the stone , and sat upon it .
ASV	Matthew	28	3	His appearance was as lightning , and his raiment white as snow :
ASV	Matthew	28	4	and for fear of him the watchers did quake , and became as dead men .
ASV	Matthew	28	5	And the angel answered and said unto the women , Fear not ye ; for I know that ye seek Jesus , who hath been crucified .
ASV	Matthew	28	6	He is not here ; for he is risen , even as he said . Come , see the place [ a ] where the Lord lay .
ASV	Matthew	28	7	And go quickly , and tell his disciples , He is risen from the dead ; and lo , he goeth before you into Galilee ; there shall ye see him : lo , I have told you .
ASV	Matthew	28	8	And they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy , and ran to bring his disciples word .
ASV	Matthew	28	9	And behold , Jesus met them , saying , All hail . And they came and took hold of his feet , and [ b ] worshipped him .
ASV	Matthew	28	10	Then saith Jesus unto them , Fear not : go tell my brethren that they depart into Galilee , and there shall they see me .
ASV	Matthew	28	11	Now while they were going , behold , some of the guard came into the city , and told unto the chief priests all the things that were come to pass .
ASV	Matthew	28	12	And when they were assembled with the elders , and had taken counsel , they gave much money unto the soldiers ,
ASV	Matthew	28	13	saying , Say ye , His disciples came by night , and stole him away while we slept .
ASV	Matthew	28	14	And if this [ c ] come to the governor ’ s ears , we will persuade him , and rid you of care .
ASV	Matthew	28	15	So they took the money , and did as they were taught : and this saying was spread abroad among the Jews , and continueth until this day .
ASV	Matthew	28	16	But the eleven disciples went into Galilee , unto the mountain where Jesus had appointed them .
ASV	Matthew	28	17	And when they saw him , they [ d ] worshipped him ; but some doubted .
ASV	Matthew	28	18	And Jesus came to them and spake unto them , saying , All authority hath been given unto me in heaven and on earth .
ASV	Matthew	28	19	Go ye therefore , and make disciples of all the nations , baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit :
ASV	Matthew	28	20	teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I commanded you : and lo , I am with you [ e ] always , even unto [ f ] the end of the world .

ASV	Mark	1	1	The beginning of the [ a ] gospel of Jesus Christ , [ b ] the Son of God .
ASV	Mark	1	2	Even as it is written [ c ] in Isaiah the prophet , [ d ] Behold , I send my messenger before thy face , Who shall prepare thy way ;
ASV	Mark	1	3	[ e ] The voice of one crying in the wilderness , Make ye ready the way of the Lord , Make his paths straight ;
ASV	Mark	1	4	John came , who baptized in the wilderness and preached the baptism of repentance unto remission of sins .
ASV	Mark	1	5	And there went out unto him all the country of Judaea , and all they of Jerusalem ; and they were baptized of him in the river Jordan , confessing their sins .
ASV	Mark	1	6	And John was clothed with camel ’ s hair , and had a leathern girdle about his loins , and did eat locusts and wild honey .
ASV	Mark	1	7	And he preached , saying , There cometh after me he that is mightier than I , the latchet of whose shoes I am not [ f ] worthy to stoop down and unloose .
ASV	Mark	1	8	I baptized you [ g ] in water ; but he shall baptize you [ h ] in the Holy Spirit .
ASV	Mark	1	9	And it came to pass in those days , that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee , and was baptized of John [ i ] in the Jordan .
ASV	Mark	1	10	And straightway coming up out of the water , he saw the heavens rent asunder , and the Spirit as a dove descending upon him :
ASV	Mark	1	11	and a voice came out of the heavens , Thou art my beloved Son , in thee I am well pleased .
ASV	Mark	1	12	And straightway the Spirit driveth him forth into the wilderness .
ASV	Mark	1	13	And he was in the wilderness forty days tempted of Satan ; and he was with the wild beasts ; and the angels ministered unto him .
ASV	Mark	1	14	Now after John was delivered up , Jesus came into Galilee , preaching the [ j ] gospel of God ,
ASV	Mark	1	15	and saying , The time is fulfilled , and the kingdom of God is at hand : repent ye , and believe in the [ k ] gospel .
ASV	Mark	1	16	And passing along by the sea of Galilee , he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net in the sea ; for they were fishers .
ASV	Mark	1	17	And Jesus said unto them , Come ye after me , and I will make you to become fishers of men .
ASV	Mark	1	18	And straightway they left the nets , and followed him .
ASV	Mark	1	19	And going on a little further , he saw [ l ] James the son of Zebedee , and John his brother , who also were in the boat mending the nets .
ASV	Mark	1	20	And straightway he called them : and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants , and went after him .
ASV	Mark	1	21	And they go into Capernaum ; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught .
ASV	Mark	1	22	And they were astonished at his teaching : for he taught them as having authority , and not as the scribes .
ASV	Mark	1	23	And straightway there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit ; and he cried out ,
ASV	Mark	1	24	saying , What have we to do with thee , Jesus thou Nazarene ? art thou come to destroy us ? I know thee who thou art , the Holy One of God .
ASV	Mark	1	25	And Jesus rebuked [ m ] him , saying , Hold thy peace , and come out of him .
ASV	Mark	1	26	And the unclean spirit , [ n ] tearing him and crying with a loud voice , came out of him .
ASV	Mark	1	27	And they were all amazed , insomuch that they questioned among themselves , saying , What is this ? a new teaching ! with authority he commandeth even the unclean spirits , and they obey him .
ASV	Mark	1	28	And the report of him went out straightway everywhere into all the region of Galilee round about .
ASV	Mark	1	29	And straightway , [ o ] when they were come out of the synagogue , they came into the house of Simon and Andrew , with [ p ] James and John .
ASV	Mark	1	30	Now Simon ’ s wife ’ s mother lay sick of a fever ; and straightway they tell him of her :
ASV	Mark	1	31	and he came and took her by the hand , and raised her up ; and the fever left her , and she ministered unto them .
ASV	Mark	1	32	And at even , when the sun did set , they brought unto him all that were sick , and them that were [ q ] possessed with demons .
ASV	Mark	1	33	And all the city was gathered together at the door .
ASV	Mark	1	34	And he healed many that were sick with divers diseases , and cast out many demons ; and he suffered not the demons to speak , because they knew him [ r ] .
ASV	Mark	1	35	And in the morning , a great while before day , he rose up and went out , and departed into a desert place , and there prayed .
ASV	Mark	1	36	And Simon and they that were with him followed after him ;
ASV	Mark	1	37	and they found him , and say unto him , All are seeking thee .
ASV	Mark	1	38	And he saith unto them , Let us go elsewhere into the next towns , that I may preach there also ; for to this end came I forth .
ASV	Mark	1	39	And he went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee , preaching and casting out demons .
ASV	Mark	1	40	And there cometh to him a leper , beseeching him , [ s ] and kneeling down to him , and saying unto him , If thou wilt , thou canst make me clean .
ASV	Mark	1	41	And being moved with compassion , he stretched forth his hand , and touched him , and saith unto him , I will ; be thou made clean .
ASV	Mark	1	42	And straightway the leprosy departed from him , and he was made clean .
ASV	Mark	1	43	And he [ t ] strictly charged him , and straightway sent him out ,
ASV	Mark	1	44	and saith unto him , See thou say nothing to any man : but go show thyself to the priest , and offer for thy cleansing the things which Moses [ u ] commanded , for a testimony unto them .
ASV	Mark	1	45	But he went out , and began to publish it much , and to spread abroad the [ v ] matter , insomuch that [ w ] Jesus could no more openly enter into [ x ] a city , but was without in desert places : and they came to him from every quarter .

ASV	Mark	2	2	And many were gathered together , so that there was no longer room for them , no , not even about the door : and he spake the word unto them .
ASV	Mark	2	3	And they come , bringing unto him a man sick of the palsy , borne of four .
ASV	Mark	2	4	And when they could not [ b ] come nigh unto him for the crowd , they uncovered the roof where he was : and when they had broken it up , they let down the [ c ] bed whereon the sick of the palsy lay .
ASV	Mark	2	5	And Jesus seeing their faith saith unto the sick of the palsy , [ d ] Son , thy sins are forgiven .
ASV	Mark	2	6	But there were certain of the scribes sitting there , and reasoning in their hearts ,
ASV	Mark	2	7	Why doth this man thus speak ? he blasphemeth : who can forgive sins but one , even God ?
ASV	Mark	2	8	And straightway Jesus , perceiving in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves , saith unto them , Why reason ye these things in your hearts ?
ASV	Mark	2	9	Which is easier , to say to the sick of the palsy , Thy sins are forgiven ; or to say , Arise , and take up thy [ e ] bed , and walk ?
ASV	Mark	2	10	But that ye may know that the Son of man hath authority on earth to forgive sins ( he saith to the sick of the palsy ) ,
ASV	Mark	2	11	I say unto thee , Arise , take up thy [ f ] bed , and go unto thy house .
ASV	Mark	2	12	And he arose , and straightway took up the [ g ] bed , and went forth before them all ; insomuch that they were all amazed , and glorified God , saying , We never saw it on this fashion .
ASV	Mark	2	13	And he went forth again by the sea side ; and all the multitude resorted unto him , and he taught them .
ASV	Mark	2	14	And as he passed by , he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the place of toll , and he saith unto him , Follow me . And he arose and followed him .
ASV	Mark	2	15	And it came to pass , that he was sitting at meat in his house , and many [ h ] publicans and sinners sat down with Jesus and his disciples : for there were many , and they followed him .
ASV	Mark	2	16	And the scribes [ i ] of the Pharisees , when they saw that he was eating with the sinners and [ j ] publicans , said unto his disciples , [ k ] How is it that he eateth [ l ] and drinketh with [ m ] publicans and sinners ?
ASV	Mark	2	17	And when Jesus heard it , he saith unto them , They that are [ n ] whole have no need of a physician , but they that are sick : I came not to call the righteous , but sinners .
ASV	Mark	2	18	And John ’ s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting : and they come and say unto him , Why do John ’ s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast , but thy disciples fast not ?
ASV	Mark	2	19	And Jesus said unto them , Can the [ o ] sons of the bridechamber fast , while the bridegroom is with them ? as long as they have the bridegroom with them , they can not fast .
ASV	Mark	2	20	But the days will come , when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them , and then will they fast in that day .
ASV	Mark	2	21	No man seweth a piece of undressed cloth on an old garment : else that which should fill it up taketh from it , the new from the old , and a worse rent is made .
ASV	Mark	2	22	And no man putteth new wine into old [ p ] wine-skins ; else the wine will burst the skins , and the wine perisheth , and the skins : but they put new wine into fresh wine-skins .
ASV	Mark	2	23	And it came to pass , that he was going on the sabbath day through the grainfields ; and his disciples [ q ] began , as they went , to pluck the ears .
ASV	Mark	2	24	And the Pharisees said unto him , Behold , why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful ?
ASV	Mark	2	25	And he said unto them , [ r ] Did ye never read what David did , when he had need , and was hungry , he , and they that were with him ?
ASV	Mark	2	26	How he entered into the house of God [ s ] when Abiathar was high priest , and ate the showbread , which it is not lawful to eat save for the priests , and gave also to them that were with him ?
ASV	Mark	2	27	And he said unto them , The sabbath was made for man , and not man for the sabbath :
ASV	Mark	2	28	so that the Son of man is lord even of the sabbath .

ASV	Mark	3	3	And he saith unto the man that had his hand withered , [ a ] Stand forth .
ASV	Mark	3	2	And they watched him , whether he would heal him on the sabbath day ; that they might accuse him .
ASV	Mark	3	4	And he saith unto them , Is it lawful on the sabbath day to do good , or to do harm ? to save a life , or to kill ? But they held their peace .
ASV	Mark	3	5	And when he had looked round about on them with anger , being grieved at the hardening of their heart , he saith unto the man , Stretch forth thy hand . And he stretched it forth ; and his hand was restored .
ASV	Mark	3	6	And the Pharisees went out , and straightway with the Herodians took counsel against him , how they might destroy him .
ASV	Mark	3	7	And Jesus with his disciples withdrew to the sea : and a great multitude from Galilee followed ; and from Judaea ,
ASV	Mark	3	8	and from Jerusalem , and from Idumaea , and beyond the Jordan , and about Tyre and Sidon , a great multitude , hearing [ b ] what great things he did , came unto him .
ASV	Mark	3	9	And he spake to his disciples , that a little boat should wait on him because of the crowd , lest they should throng him :
ASV	Mark	3	10	for he had healed many ; insomuch that as many as had [ c ] plagues [ d ] pressed upon him that they might touch him .
ASV	Mark	3	11	And the unclean spirits , whensoever they beheld him , fell down before him , and cried , saying , Thou art the Son of God .
ASV	Mark	3	12	And he charged them much that they should not make him known .
ASV	Mark	3	13	And he goeth up into the mountain , and calleth unto him whom he himself would ; and they went unto him .
ASV	Mark	3	14	And he appointed twelve , [ e ] that they might be with him , and that he might send them forth to preach ,
ASV	Mark	3	15	and to have authority to cast out demons :
ASV	Mark	3	16	[ f ] and Simon he surnamed Peter ;
ASV	Mark	3	17	and [ g ] James the son of Zebedee , and John the brother of [ h ] James ; and them he surnamed Boanerges , which is , Sons of thunder :
ASV	Mark	3	18	and Andrew , and Philip , and Bartholomew , and Matthew , and Thomas , and [ i ] James the son of Alphaeus , and Thaddaeus , and Simon the [ j ] Cananaean ,
ASV	Mark	3	19	and Judas Iscariot , who also [ k ] betrayed him . And he cometh [ l ] into a house .
ASV	Mark	3	20	And the multitude cometh together again , so that they could not so much as eat bread .
ASV	Mark	3	21	And when his friends heard it , they went out to lay hold on him : for they said , He is beside himself .
ASV	Mark	3	22	And the scribes that came down from Jerusalem said , He hath [ m ] Beelzebub , and , [ n ] By the prince of the demons casteth he out the demons .
ASV	Mark	3	23	And he called them unto him , and said unto them in parables , How can Satan cast out Satan ?
ASV	Mark	3	24	And if a kingdom be divided against itself , that kingdom can not stand .
ASV	Mark	3	25	And if a house be divided against itself , that house will not be able to stand .
ASV	Mark	3	26	And if Satan hath risen up against himself , and is divided , he can not stand , but hath an end .
ASV	Mark	3	27	But no one can enter into the house of the strong man , and spoil his goods , except he first bind the strong man ; and then he will spoil his house .
ASV	Mark	3	28	Verily I say unto you , All their sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men , and their blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme :
ASV	Mark	3	29	but whosoever shall blaspheme against the Holy Spirit hath never forgiveness , but is guilty of an eternal sin :
ASV	Mark	3	30	because they said , He hath an unclean spirit .
ASV	Mark	3	31	And there come his mother and his brethren ; and , standing without , they sent unto him , calling him .
ASV	Mark	3	32	And a multitude was sitting about him ; and they say unto him , Behold , thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee .
ASV	Mark	3	33	And he answereth them , and saith , Who is my mother and my brethren ?
ASV	Mark	3	34	And looking round on them that sat round about him , he saith , Behold , my mother and my brethren !
ASV	Mark	3	35	For whosoever shall do the will of God , the same is my brother , and sister , and mother .

ASV	Mark	4	4	and it came to pass , as he sowed , some seed fell by the way side , and the birds came and devoured it .
ASV	Mark	4	2	And he taught them many things in parables , and said unto them in his teaching ,
ASV	Mark	4	3	Hearken : Behold , the sower went forth to sow :
ASV	Mark	4	5	And other fell on the rocky ground , where it had not much earth ; and straightway it sprang up , because it had no deepness of earth :
ASV	Mark	4	6	and when the sun was risen , it was scorched ; and because it had no root , it withered away .
ASV	Mark	4	7	And other fell among the thorns , and the thorns grew up , and choked it , and it yielded no fruit .
ASV	Mark	4	8	And others fell into the good ground , and yielded fruit , growing up and increasing ; and brought forth , thirtyfold , and sixtyfold , and a hundredfold .
ASV	Mark	4	9	And he said , Who hath ears to hear , let him hear .
ASV	Mark	4	10	And when he was alone , they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parables .
ASV	Mark	4	11	And he said unto them , Unto you is given the mystery of the kingdom of God : but unto them that are without , all things are done in parables :
ASV	Mark	4	12	that seeing they may see , and not perceive ; and hearing they may hear , and not understand ; lest haply they should turn again , and it should be forgiven them .
ASV	Mark	4	13	And he saith unto them , Know ye not this parable ? and how shall ye know all the parables ?
ASV	Mark	4	14	The sower soweth the word .
ASV	Mark	4	15	And these are they by the way side , where the word is sown ; and when they have heard , straightway cometh Satan , and taketh away the word which hath been sown in them .
ASV	Mark	4	16	And these in like manner are they that are sown upon the rocky places , who , when they have heard the word , straightway receive it with joy ;
ASV	Mark	4	17	and they have no root in themselves , but endure for a while ; then , when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word , straightway they stumble .
ASV	Mark	4	18	And others are they that are sown among the thorns ; these are they that have heard the word ,
ASV	Mark	4	19	and the cares of the [ a ] world , and the deceitfulness of riches , and the lusts of other things entering in , choke the word , and it becometh unfruitful .
ASV	Mark	4	20	And those are they that were sown upon the good ground ; such as hear the word , and accept it , and bear fruit , thirtyfold , and sixtyfold , and a hundredfold .
ASV	Mark	4	21	And he said unto them , Is the lamp brought to be put under the bushel , or under the bed , and not to be put on the stand ?
ASV	Mark	4	22	For there is nothing hid , save that it should be manifested ; neither was anything made secret , but that it should come to light .
ASV	Mark	4	23	If any man hath ears to hear , let him hear .
ASV	Mark	4	24	And he said unto them , Take heed what ye hear : with what measure ye mete it shall be measured unto you ; and more shall be given unto you .
ASV	Mark	4	25	For he that hath , to him shall be given : and he that hath not , from him shall be taken away even that which he hath .
ASV	Mark	4	26	And he said , So is the kingdom of God , as if a man should cast seed upon the earth ;
ASV	Mark	4	27	and should sleep and rise night and day , and the seed should spring up and grow , he knoweth not how .
ASV	Mark	4	28	The earth [ b ] beareth fruit of herself ; first the blade , then the ear , then the full grain in the ear .
ASV	Mark	4	29	But when the fruit [ c ] is ripe , straightway he [ d ] putteth forth the sickle , because the harvest is come .
ASV	Mark	4	30	And he said , How shall we liken the kingdom of God ? or in what parable shall we set it forth ?
ASV	Mark	4	31	[ e ] It is like a grain of mustard seed , which , when it is sown upon the earth , though it be less than all the seeds that are upon the earth ,
ASV	Mark	4	32	yet when it is sown , groweth up , and becometh greater than all the herbs , and putteth out great branches ; so that the birds of the heaven can lodge under the shadow thereof .
ASV	Mark	4	33	And with many such parables spake he the word unto them , as they were able to hear it ;
ASV	Mark	4	34	and without a parable spake he not unto them : but privately to his own disciples he expounded all things .
ASV	Mark	4	35	And on that day , when even was come , he saith unto them , Let us go over unto the other side .
ASV	Mark	4	36	And leaving the multitude , they take him with them , even as he was , in the boat . And other boats were with him .
ASV	Mark	4	37	And there ariseth a great storm of wind , and the waves beat into the boat , insomuch that the boat was now filling .
ASV	Mark	4	38	And he himself was in the stern , asleep on the cushion : and they awake him , and say unto him , Teacher , carest thou not that we perish ?
ASV	Mark	4	39	And he awoke , and rebuked the wind , and said unto the sea , Peace , be still . And the wind ceased , and there was a great calm .
ASV	Mark	4	40	And he said unto them , Why are ye fearful ? have ye not yet faith ?
ASV	Mark	4	41	And they feared exceedingly , and said one to another , Who then is this , that even the wind and the sea obey him ?
ASV	Mark	5	5	And always , night and day , in the tombs and in the mountains , he was crying out , and cutting himself with stones .
ASV	Mark	5	2	And when he was come out of the boat , straightway there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit ,
ASV	Mark	5	3	who had his dwelling in the tombs : and no man could any more bind him , no , not with a chain ;
ASV	Mark	5	4	because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains , and the chains had been rent asunder by him , and the fetters broken in pieces : and no man had strength to tame him .
ASV	Mark	5	6	And when he saw Jesus from afar , he ran and [ a ] worshipped him ;
ASV	Mark	5	7	and crying out with a loud voice , he saith , What have I to do with thee , Jesus , thou Son of the Most High God ? I adjure thee by God , torment me not .
ASV	Mark	5	8	For he said unto him , Come forth , thou unclean spirit , out of the man .
ASV	Mark	5	9	And he asked him , What is thy name ? And he saith unto him , My name is Legion ; for we are many .
ASV	Mark	5	10	And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country .
ASV	Mark	5	11	Now there was there on the mountain side a great herd of swine feeding .
ASV	Mark	5	12	And they besought him , saying , Send us into the swine , that we may enter into them .
ASV	Mark	5	13	And he gave them leave . And the unclean spirits came out , and entered into the swine : and the herd rushed down the steep into the sea , in number about two thousand ; and they were drowned in the sea .
ASV	Mark	5	14	And they that fed them fled , and told it in the city , and in the country . And they came to see what it was that had come to pass .
ASV	Mark	5	15	And they come to Jesus , and behold [ b ] him that was possessed with demons sitting , clothed and in his right mind , even him that had the legion : and they were afraid .
ASV	Mark	5	16	And they that saw it declared unto them how it befell [ c ] him that was possessed with demons , and concerning the swine .
ASV	Mark	5	17	And they began to beseech him to depart from their borders .
ASV	Mark	5	18	And as he was entering into the boat , [ d ] he that had been possessed with demons besought him that he might be with him .
ASV	Mark	5	19	And he suffered him not , but saith unto him , Go to thy house unto thy friends , and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee , and how he had mercy on thee .
ASV	Mark	5	20	And he went his way , and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him : and all men marvelled .
ASV	Mark	5	21	And when Jesus had crossed over again in the boat unto the other side , a great multitude was gathered unto him ; and he was by the sea .
ASV	Mark	5	22	And there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue , Jairus by name ; and seeing him , he falleth at his feet ,
ASV	Mark	5	23	and beseecheth him much , saying , My little daughter is at the point of death : I pray thee , that thou come and lay thy hands on her , that she may be [ e ] made whole , and live .
ASV	Mark	5	24	And he went with him ; and a great multitude followed him , and they thronged him .
ASV	Mark	5	25	And a woman , who had an issue of blood twelve years ,
ASV	Mark	5	26	and had suffered many things of many physicians , and had spent all that she had , and was nothing bettered , but rather grew worse ,
ASV	Mark	5	27	having heard the things concerning Jesus , came in the crowd behind , and touched his garment .
ASV	Mark	5	28	For she said , If I touch but his garments , I shall be [ f ] made whole .
ASV	Mark	5	29	And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up ; and she felt in her body that she was healed of her [ g ] plague .
ASV	Mark	5	30	And straightway Jesus , perceiving in himself that the power proceeding from him had gone forth , turned him about in the crowd , and said , Who touched my garments ?
ASV	Mark	5	31	And his disciples said unto him , Thou seest the multitude thronging thee , and sayest thou , Who touched me ?
ASV	Mark	5	32	And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing .
ASV	Mark	5	33	But the woman fearing and trembling , knowing what had been done to her , came and fell down before him , and told him all the truth .
ASV	Mark	5	34	And he said unto her , Daughter , thy faith hath [ h ] made thee whole ; go in peace , and be whole of thy [ i ] plague .
ASV	Mark	5	35	While he yet spake , they come from the ruler of the synagogue ’ s house , saying , Thy daughter is dead : why troublest thou the Teacher any further ?
ASV	Mark	5	36	But Jesus , [ j ] not heeding the word spoken , saith unto the ruler of the synagogue , Fear not , only believe .
ASV	Mark	5	37	And he suffered no man to follow with him , save Peter , and [ k ] James , and John the brother of [ l ] James .
ASV	Mark	5	38	And they come to the house of the ruler of the synagogue ; and he beholdeth a tumult , and many weeping and wailing greatly .
ASV	Mark	5	39	And when he was entered in , he saith unto them , Why make ye a tumult , and weep ? the child is not dead , but sleepeth .
ASV	Mark	5	40	And they laughed him to scorn . But he , having put them all forth , taketh the father of the child and her mother and them that were with him , and goeth in where the child was .
ASV	Mark	5	41	And taking the child by the hand , he saith unto her , Talitha cumi ; which is , being interpreted , Damsel , I say unto thee , Arise .
ASV	Mark	5	42	And straightway the damsel rose up , and walked ; for she was twelve years old . And they were amazed straightway with a great amazement .
ASV	Mark	5	43	And he charged them much that no man should know this : and he commanded that something should be given her to eat .

ASV	Mark	6	6	And he marvelled because of their unbelief . And he went round about the villages teaching .
ASV	Mark	6	2	And when the sabbath was come , he began to teach in the synagogue : and [ a ] many hearing him were astonished , saying , Whence hath this man these things ? and , What is the wisdom that is given unto this man , and what mean such [ b ] mighty works wrought by his hands ?
ASV	Mark	6	3	Is not this the carpenter , the son of Mary , and brother of [ c ] James , and Joses , and Judas , and Simon ? and are not his sisters here with us ? And they were [ d ] offended in him .
ASV	Mark	6	4	And Jesus said unto them , A prophet is not without honor , save in his own country , and among his own kin , and in his own house .
ASV	Mark	6	5	And he could there do no [ e ] mighty work , save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk , and healed them .
ASV	Mark	6	7	And he calleth unto him the twelve , and began to send them forth by two and two ; and he gave them authority over the unclean spirits ;
ASV	Mark	6	8	and he charged them that they should take nothing for their journey , save a staff only ; no bread , no wallet , no [ f ] money in their [ g ] purse ;
ASV	Mark	6	9	but to go shod with sandals : and , said he , put not on two coats .
ASV	Mark	6	10	And he said unto them , Wheresoever ye enter into a house , there abide till ye depart thence .
ASV	Mark	6	11	And whatsoever place shall not receive you , and they hear you not , as ye go forth thence , shake off the dust that is under your feet for a testimony unto them .
ASV	Mark	6	12	And they went out , and preached that men should repent .
ASV	Mark	6	13	And they cast out many demons , and anointed with oil many that were sick , and healed them .
ASV	Mark	6	14	And king Herod heard thereof ; for his name had become known : and [ h ] he said , John the Baptizer is risen from the dead , and therefore do these powers work in him .
ASV	Mark	6	15	But others said , It is Elijah . And others said , It is a prophet , even as one of the prophets .
ASV	Mark	6	16	But Herod , when he heard thereof , said , John , whom I beheaded , he is risen .
ASV	Mark	6	17	For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John , and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias , his brother Philip ’ s wife ; for he had married her .
ASV	Mark	6	18	For John said unto Herod , It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother ’ s wife .
ASV	Mark	6	19	And Herodias set herself against him , and desired to kill him ; and she could not ;
ASV	Mark	6	20	for Herod feared John , knowing that he was a righteous and holy man , and kept him safe . And when he heard him , he [ i ] was much perplexed ; and he heard him gladly .
ASV	Mark	6	21	And when a convenient day was come , that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords , and the [ j ] high captains , and the chief men of Galilee ;
ASV	Mark	6	22	and when [ k ] the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced , [ l ] she pleased Herod and them that sat at meat with him ; and the king said unto the damsel , Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt , and I will give it thee .
ASV	Mark	6	23	And he sware unto her , Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me , I will give it thee , unto the half of my kingdom .
ASV	Mark	6	24	And she went out , and said unto her mother , What shall I ask ? And she said , The head of John the Baptizer .
ASV	Mark	6	25	And she came in straightway with haste unto the king , and asked , saying , I will that thou forthwith give me on a platter the head of John the Baptist .
ASV	Mark	6	26	And the king was exceeding sorry ; but for the sake of his oaths , and of them that sat at meat , he would not reject her .
ASV	Mark	6	27	And straightway the king sent forth a soldier of his guard , and commanded to bring his head : and he went and beheaded him in the prison ,
ASV	Mark	6	28	and brought his head on a platter , and gave it to the damsel ; and the damsel gave it to her mother .
ASV	Mark	6	29	And when his disciples heard thereof , they came and took up his corpse , and laid it in a tomb .
ASV	Mark	6	30	And the apostles gather themselves together unto Jesus ; and they told him all things , whatsoever they had done , and whatsoever they had taught .
ASV	Mark	6	31	And he saith unto them , Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place , and rest a while . For there were many coming and going , and they had no leisure so much as to eat .
ASV	Mark	6	32	And they went away in the boat to a desert place apart .
ASV	Mark	6	33	And the people saw them going , and many knew them , and they ran together there [ m ] on foot from all the cities , and outwent them .
ASV	Mark	6	34	And he came forth and saw a great multitude , and he had compassion on them , because they were as sheep not having a shepherd : and he began to teach them many things .
ASV	Mark	6	35	And when the day was now far spent , his disciples came unto him , and said , The place is desert , and the day is now far spent ;
ASV	Mark	6	36	send them away , that they may go into the country and villages round about , and buy themselves somewhat to eat .
ASV	Mark	6	37	But he answered and said unto them , Give ye them to eat . And they say unto him , Shall we go and buy two hundred [ n ] shillings ’ worth of bread , and give them to eat ?
ASV	Mark	6	38	And he saith unto them , How many loaves have ye ? go and see . And when they knew , they say , Five , and two fishes .
ASV	Mark	6	39	And he commanded them that all should [ o ] sit down by companies upon the green grass .
ASV	Mark	6	40	And they sat down in ranks , by hundreds , and by fifties .
ASV	Mark	6	41	And he took the five loaves and the two fishes , and looking up to heaven , he blessed , and brake the loaves ; and he gave to the disciples to set before them ; and the two fishes divided he among them all .
ASV	Mark	6	42	And they all ate , and were filled .
ASV	Mark	6	43	And they took up broken pieces , twelve basketfuls , and also of the fishes .
ASV	Mark	6	44	And they that ate the loaves were five thousand men .
ASV	Mark	6	45	And straightway he constrained his disciples to enter into the boat , and to go before him unto the other side to Bethsaida , while he himself sendeth the multitude away .
ASV	Mark	6	46	And after he had taken leave of them , he departed into the mountain to pray .
ASV	Mark	6	47	And when even was come , the boat was in the midst of the sea , and he alone on the land .
ASV	Mark	6	48	And seeing them distressed in rowing , for the wind was contrary unto them , about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them , walking on the sea ; and he would have passed by them :
ASV	Mark	6	49	but they , when they saw him walking on the sea , supposed that it was a ghost , and cried out ;
ASV	Mark	6	50	for they all saw him , and were troubled . But he straightway spake with them , and saith unto them , Be of good cheer : it is I ; be not afraid .
ASV	Mark	6	51	And he went up unto them into the boat ; and the wind ceased : and they were sore amazed in themselves ;
ASV	Mark	6	52	for they understood not concerning the loaves , but their heart was hardened .
ASV	Mark	6	53	And when they had [ p ] crossed over , they came to the land unto Gennesaret , and moored to the shore .
ASV	Mark	6	54	And when they were come out of the boat , straightway the people knew him ,
ASV	Mark	6	55	and ran round about that whole region , and began to carry about on their [ q ] beds those that were sick , where they heard he was .
ASV	Mark	6	56	And wheresoever he entered , into villages , or into cities , or into the country , they laid the sick in the marketplaces , and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment : and as many as touched [ r ] him were made whole .

ASV	Mark	7	7	But in vain do they worship me , Teaching as their doctrines the precepts of men .
ASV	Mark	7	2	and had seen that some of his disciples ate their bread with [ a ] defiled , that is , unwashen , hands .
ASV	Mark	7	3	( For the Pharisees , and all the Jews , except they wash their hands [ b ] diligently , eat not , holding the tradition of the elders ;
ASV	Mark	7	4	and when they come from the marketplace , except they [ c ] bathe themselves , they eat not ; and many other things there are , which they have received to hold , [ d ] washings of cups , and pots , and brasen vessels [ e ] . )
ASV	Mark	7	5	And the Pharisees and the scribes ask him , Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders , but eat their bread with [ f ] defiled hands ?
ASV	Mark	7	6	And he said unto them , Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites , as it is written , [ g ] This people honoreth me with their lips , But their heart is far from me .
ASV	Mark	7	8	Ye leave the commandment of God , and hold fast the tradition of men .
ASV	Mark	7	9	And he said unto them , Full well do ye reject the commandment of God , that ye may keep your tradition .
ASV	Mark	7	10	For Moses said , [ h ] Honor thy father and thy mother ; and , He that speaketh evil of father or mother , let him [ i ] die the death :
ASV	Mark	7	11	but ye say , If a man shall say to his father or his mother , That wherewith thou mightest have been profited by me is Corban , that is to say , Given to God ;
ASV	Mark	7	12	ye no longer suffer him to do aught for his father or his mother ;
ASV	Mark	7	13	making void the word of God by your tradition , which ye have delivered : and many such like things ye do .
ASV	Mark	7	14	And he called to him the multitude again , and said unto them , Hear me all of you , and understand :
ASV	Mark	7	15	there is nothing from without the man , that going into him can defile him ; but the things which proceed out of the man are those that defile the man . [ j ]
ASV	Mark	7	17	And when he was entered into the house from the multitude , his disciples asked of him the parable .
ASV	Mark	7	18	And he saith unto them , Are ye so without understanding also ? Perceive ye not , that whatsoever from without goeth into the man , it can not defile him ;
ASV	Mark	7	19	because it goeth not into his heart , but into his belly , and goeth out into the draught ? This he said , making all meats clean .
ASV	Mark	7	20	And he said , That which proceedeth out of the man , that defileth the man .
ASV	Mark	7	21	For from within , out of the heart of men , [ k ] evil thoughts proceed , fornications , thefts , murders , adulteries ,
ASV	Mark	7	22	covetings , wickednesses , deceit , lasciviousness , an evil eye , railing , pride , foolishness :
ASV	Mark	7	23	all these evil things proceed from within , and defile the man .
ASV	Mark	7	24	And from thence he arose , and went away into the borders of Tyre [ l ] and Sidon . And he entered into a house , and would have no man know it ; and he could not be hid .
ASV	Mark	7	25	But straightway a woman , whose little daughter had an unclean spirit , having heard of him , came and fell down at his feet .
ASV	Mark	7	26	Now the woman was a [ m ] Greek , a Syrophoenician by race . And she besought him that he would cast forth the demon out of her daughter .
ASV	Mark	7	27	And he said unto her , Let the children first be filled : for it is not meet to take the children ’ s [ n ] bread and cast it to the dogs .
ASV	Mark	7	28	But she answered and saith unto him , Yea , Lord ; even the dogs under the table eat of the children ’ s crumbs .
ASV	Mark	7	29	And he said unto her , For this saying go thy way ; the demon is gone out of thy daughter .
ASV	Mark	7	30	And she went away unto her house , and found the child laid upon the bed , and the demon gone out .
ASV	Mark	7	31	And again he went out from the borders of Tyre , and came through Sidon unto the sea of Galilee , through the midst of the borders of Decapolis .
ASV	Mark	7	32	And they bring unto him one that was deaf , and had an impediment in his speech ; and they beseech him to lay his hand upon him .
ASV	Mark	7	33	And he took him aside from the multitude privately , and put his fingers into his ears , and he spat , and touched his tongue ;
ASV	Mark	7	34	and looking up to heaven , he sighed , and saith unto him , Ephphatha , that is , Be opened .
ASV	Mark	7	35	And his ears were opened , and the bond of his tongue was loosed , and he spake plain .
ASV	Mark	7	36	And he charged them that they should tell no man : but the more he charged them , so much the more a great deal they published it .
ASV	Mark	7	37	And they were beyond measure astonished , saying , He hath done all things well ; he maketh even the deaf to hear , and the dumb to speak .

ASV	Mark	8	8	And they ate , and were filled : and they took up , of broken pieces that remained over , seven baskets .
ASV	Mark	8	2	I have compassion on the multitude , because they continue with me now three days , and have nothing to eat :
ASV	Mark	8	3	and if I send them away fasting to their home , they will faint on the way ; and some of them are come from far .
ASV	Mark	8	4	And his disciples answered him , Whence shall one be able to fill these men with [ a ] bread here in a desert place ?
ASV	Mark	8	5	And he asked them , How many loaves have ye ? And they said , Seven .
ASV	Mark	8	6	And he commandeth the multitude to sit down on the ground : and he took the seven loaves , and having given thanks , he brake , and gave to his disciples , to set before them ; and they set them before the multitude .
ASV	Mark	8	7	And they had a few small fishes : and having blessed them , he commanded to set these also before them .
ASV	Mark	8	9	And they were about four thousand : and he sent them away .
ASV	Mark	8	10	And straightway he entered into the boat with his disciples , and came into the parts of Dalmanutha .
ASV	Mark	8	11	And the Pharisees came forth , and began to question with him , seeking of him a sign from heaven , trying him .
ASV	Mark	8	12	And he sighed deeply in his spirit , and saith , Why doth this generation seek a sign ? verily I say unto you , There shall no sign be given unto this generation .
ASV	Mark	8	13	And he left them , and again entering into the boat departed to the other side .
ASV	Mark	8	14	And they forgot to take bread ; and they had not in the boat with them more than one loaf .
ASV	Mark	8	15	And he charged them , saying , Take heed , beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod .
ASV	Mark	8	16	And they reasoned one with another , [ b ] saying , [ c ] We have no bread .
ASV	Mark	8	17	And Jesus perceiving it saith unto them , Why reason ye , because ye have no bread ? do ye not yet perceive , neither understand ? have ye your heart hardened ?

ASV	Mark	8	21	And he said unto them , Do ye not yet understand ?
ASV	Mark	8	22	And they come unto Bethsaida . And they bring to him a blind man , and beseech him to touch him .
ASV	Mark	8	23	And he took hold of the blind man by the hand , and brought him out of the village ; and when he had spit on his eyes , and laid his hands upon him , he asked him , Seest thou aught ?
ASV	Mark	8	24	And he looked up , and said , I see men ; for I behold them as trees , walking .
ASV	Mark	8	25	Then again he laid his hands upon his eyes ; and he looked stedfastly , and was restored , and saw all things clearly .
ASV	Mark	8	26	And he sent him away to his home , saying , Do not even enter into the village .
ASV	Mark	8	27	And Jesus went forth , and his disciples , into the villages of Caesarea Philippi : and on the way he asked his disciples , saying unto them , Who do men say that I am ?
ASV	Mark	8	28	And they told him , saying , John the Baptist ; and others , Elijah ; but others , One of the prophets .
ASV	Mark	8	29	And he asked them , But who say ye that I am ? Peter answereth and saith unto him , Thou art the Christ .
ASV	Mark	8	30	And he charged them that they should tell no man of him .
ASV	Mark	8	31	And he began to teach them , that the Son of man must suffer many things , and be rejected by the elders , and the chief priests , and the scribes , and be killed , and after three days rise again .
ASV	Mark	8	32	And he spake the saying openly . And Peter took him , and began to rebuke him .
ASV	Mark	8	33	But he turning about , and seeing his disciples , rebuked Peter , and saith , Get thee behind me , Satan ; for thou mindest not the things of God , but the things of men .
ASV	Mark	8	34	And he called unto him the multitude with his disciples , and said unto them , If any man would come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow me .

ASV	Mark	9	9	And as they were coming down from the mountain , he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen , save when the Son of man should have risen again from the dead .
ASV	Mark	9	1	And he said unto them , Verily I say unto you , There are some here of them that stand by , who shall in no wise taste of death , till they see the kingdom of God come with power .
ASV	Mark	9	2	And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter , and [ a ] James , and John , and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart by themselves : and he was transfigured before them ;
ASV	Mark	9	3	and his garments became glistering , exceeding white , so as no fuller on earth can whiten them .
ASV	Mark	9	4	And there appeared unto them Elijah with Moses : and they were talking with Jesus .
ASV	Mark	9	5	And Peter answereth and saith to Jesus , Rabbi , it is good for us to be here : and let us make three [ b ] tabernacles ; one for thee , and one for Moses , and one for Elijah .
ASV	Mark	9	6	For he knew not what to answer ; for they became sore afraid .
ASV	Mark	9	7	And there came a cloud overshadowing them : and there came a voice out of the cloud , This is my beloved Son : hear ye him .
ASV	Mark	9	8	And suddenly looking round about , they saw no one any more , save Jesus only with themselves .
ASV	Mark	9	10	And they kept the saying , questioning among themselves what the rising again from the dead should mean .
ASV	Mark	9	11	And they asked him , saying , [ c ] How is it that the scribes say that Elijah must first come ?
ASV	Mark	9	12	And he said unto them , Elijah indeed cometh first , and restoreth all things : and how is it written of the Son of man , that he should suffer many things and be set at nought ?
ASV	Mark	9	13	But I say unto you , that Elijah is come , and they have also done unto him whatsoever they would , even as it is written of him .
ASV	Mark	9	14	And when they came to the disciples , they saw a great multitude about them , and scribes questioning with them .
ASV	Mark	9	15	And straightway all the multitude , when they saw him , were greatly amazed , and running to him saluted him .
ASV	Mark	9	16	And he asked them , What question ye with them ?
ASV	Mark	9	17	And one of the multitude answered him , Teacher , I brought unto thee my son , who hath a dumb spirit ;
ASV	Mark	9	18	and wheresoever it taketh him , it [ d ] dasheth him down : and he foameth , and grindeth his teeth , and pineth away : and I spake to thy disciples that they should cast it out ; and they were not able .
ASV	Mark	9	19	And he answereth them and saith , O faithless generation , how long shall I be with you ? how long shall I bear with you ? bring him unto me .
ASV	Mark	9	20	And they brought him unto him : and when he saw him , straightway the spirit [ e ] tare him grievously ; and he fell on the ground , and wallowed foaming .
ASV	Mark	9	21	And he asked his father , How long time is it since this hath come unto him ? And he said , From a child .
ASV	Mark	9	22	And oft-times it hath cast him both into the fire and into the waters , to destroy him : but if thou canst do anything , have compassion on us , and help us .
ASV	Mark	9	23	And Jesus said unto him , If thou canst ! All things are possible to him that believeth .
ASV	Mark	9	24	Straightway the father of the child cried out , and said , [ f ] I believe ; help thou mine unbelief .
ASV	Mark	9	25	And when Jesus saw that a multitude came running together , he rebuked the unclean spirit , saying unto him , Thou dumb and deaf spirit , I command thee , come out of him , and enter no more into him .
ASV	Mark	9	26	And having cried out , and [ g ] torn him much , he came out : and the boy became as one dead ; insomuch that the more part said , He is dead .
ASV	Mark	9	27	But Jesus took him by the hand , and raised him up ; and he arose .
ASV	Mark	9	28	And when he was come into the house , his disciples asked him privately , [ h ] How is it that we could not cast it out ?
ASV	Mark	9	29	And he said unto them , This kind can come out by nothing , save by prayer [ i ] .
ASV	Mark	9	30	And they went forth from thence , and passed through Galilee ; and he would not that any man should know it .
ASV	Mark	9	31	For he taught his disciples , and said unto them , The Son of man is [ j ] delivered up into the hands of men , and they shall kill him ; and when he is killed , after three days he shall rise again .
ASV	Mark	9	32	But they understood not the saying , and were afraid to ask him .
ASV	Mark	9	33	And they came to Capernaum : and when he was in the house he asked them , What were ye reasoning on the way ?
ASV	Mark	9	34	But they held their peace : for they had disputed one with another on the way , who was the [ k ] greatest .
ASV	Mark	9	35	And he sat down , and called the twelve ; and he saith unto them , If any man would be first , he shall be last of all , and [ l ] servant of all .
ASV	Mark	9	36	And he took a little child , and set him in the midst of them : and taking him in his arms , he said unto them ,
ASV	Mark	9	37	Whosoever shall receive one of such little children in my name , receiveth me : and whosoever receiveth me , receiveth not me , but him that sent me .
ASV	Mark	9	38	John said unto him , Teacher , we saw one casting out demons in thy name ; and we forbade him , because he followed not us .
ASV	Mark	9	39	But Jesus said , Forbid him not : for there is no man who shall do a [ m ] mighty work in my name , and be able quickly to speak evil of me .
ASV	Mark	9	40	For he that is not against us is for us .
ASV	Mark	9	41	For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink , [ n ] because ye are Christ ’ s , verily I say unto you , he shall in no wise lose his reward .
ASV	Mark	9	42	And whosoever shall cause one of these little ones that believe [ o ] on me to stumble , it were better for him if [ p ] a great millstone were hanged about his neck , and he were cast into the sea .
ASV	Mark	9	43	And if thy hand cause thee to stumble , cut it off : it is good for thee to enter into life maimed , rather than having thy two hands to go into [ q ] hell , into the unquenchable fire . [ r ]
ASV	Mark	9	45	And if thy foot cause thee to stumble , cut it off : it is good for thee to enter into life halt , rather than having thy two feet to be cast into [ s ] hell .
ASV	Mark	9	47	And if thine eye cause thee to stumble , cast it out : it is good for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye , rather than having two eyes to be cast into [ t ] hell ;

ASV	Mark	10	22	But his countenance fell at the saying , and he went away sorrowful : for he was one that had great possessions .
ASV	Mark	10	23	And Jesus looked round about , and saith unto his disciples , How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God !
ASV	Mark	10	24	And the disciples were amazed at his words . But Jesus answereth again , and saith unto them , Children , how hard is it [ f ] for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God !
ASV	Mark	10	25	It is easier for a camel to go through a needle ’ s eye , than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God .
ASV	Mark	10	26	And they were astonished exceedingly , saying [ g ] unto him , Then who can be saved ?
ASV	Mark	10	27	Jesus looking upon them saith , With men it is impossible , but not with God : for all things are possible with God .
ASV	Mark	10	28	Peter began to say unto him , Lo , we have left all , and have followed thee .
ASV	Mark	10	29	Jesus said , Verily I say unto you , There is no man that hath left house , or brethren , or sisters , or mother , or father , or children , or lands , for my sake , and for the [ h ] gospel ’ s sake ,
ASV	Mark	10	30	but he shall receive a hundredfold now in this time , houses , and brethren , and sisters , and mothers , and children , and lands , with persecutions ; and in the [ i ] world to come eternal life .
ASV	Mark	10	31	But many that are first shall be last ; and the last first .
ASV	Mark	10	32	And they were on the way , going up to Jerusalem ; and Jesus was going before them : and they were amazed ; and they that followed were afraid . And he took again the twelve , and began to tell them the things that were to happen unto him ,
ASV	Mark	10	33	saying , Behold , we go up to Jerusalem ; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests and the scribes ; and they shall condemn him to death , and shall deliver him unto the Gentiles :
ASV	Mark	10	34	and they shall mock him , and shall spit upon him , and shall scourge him , and shall kill him ; and after three days he shall rise again .
ASV	Mark	10	35	And there come near unto him [ j ] James and John , the sons of Zebedee , saying unto him , Teacher , we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall ask of thee .
ASV	Mark	10	36	And he said unto them , What would ye that I should do for you ?
ASV	Mark	10	37	And they said unto him , Grant unto us that we may sit , one on thy right hand , and one on thy left hand , in thy glory .
ASV	Mark	10	38	But Jesus said unto them , Ye know not what ye ask . Are ye able to drink the cup that I drink ? or to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with ?
ASV	Mark	10	39	And they said unto him , We are able . And Jesus said unto them , The cup that I drink ye shall drink ; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized :
ASV	Mark	10	40	but to sit on my right hand or on my left hand is not mine to give ; but it is for them for whom it hath been prepared .
ASV	Mark	10	41	And when the ten heard it , they began to be moved with indignation concerning [ k ] James and John .
ASV	Mark	10	42	And Jesus called them to him , and saith unto them , Ye know that they who are accounted to rule over the Gentiles lord it over them ; and their great ones exercise authority over them .
ASV	Mark	10	43	But it is not so among you : but whosoever would become great among you , shall be your [ l ] minister ;
ASV	Mark	10	44	and whosoever would be first among you , shall be [ m ] servant of all .
ASV	Mark	10	45	For the Son of man also came not to be ministered unto , but to minister , and to give his life a ransom for many .
ASV	Mark	10	46	And they come to Jericho : and as he went out from Jericho , with his disciples and a great multitude , the son of Timaeus , Bartimaeus , a blind beggar , was sitting by the way side .
ASV	Mark	10	47	And when he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene , he began to cry out , and say , Jesus , thou son of David , have mercy on me .
ASV	Mark	10	48	And many rebuked him , that he should hold his peace : but he cried out the more a great deal , Thou son of David , have mercy on me .
ASV	Mark	10	49	And Jesus stood still , and said , Call ye him . And they call the blind man , saying unto him , Be of good cheer : rise , he calleth thee .
ASV	Mark	10	50	And he , casting away his garment , sprang up , and came to Jesus .
ASV	Mark	10	51	And Jesus answered him , and said , What wilt thou that I should do unto thee ? And the blind man said unto him , [ n ] Rabboni , that I may receive my sight .
ASV	Mark	10	52	And Jesus said unto him , Go thy way ; thy faith hath [ o ] made thee whole . And straightway he received his sight , and followed him in the way . Footnotes - Mark 10:3 Dt . 24:1 ,
ASV	Mark	11	11	And he entered into Jerusalem , into the temple ; and when he had looked round about upon all things , it being now eventide , he went out unto Bethany with the twelve .
ASV	Mark	11	2	and saith unto them , Go your way into the village that is over against you : and straightway as ye enter into it , ye shall find a colt tied , whereon no man ever yet sat ; loose him , and bring him .
ASV	Mark	11	3	And if any one say unto you , Why do ye this ? say ye , The Lord hath need of him ; and straightway he [ a ] will send him [ b ] back hither .
ASV	Mark	11	4	And they went away , and found a colt tied at the door without in the open street ; and they loose him .
ASV	Mark	11	5	And certain of them that stood there said unto them , What do ye , loosing the colt ?
ASV	Mark	11	6	And they said unto them even as Jesus had said : and they let them go .
ASV	Mark	11	7	And they bring the colt unto Jesus , and cast on him their garments ; and he sat upon him .
ASV	Mark	11	8	And many spread their garments upon the way ; and others [ c ] branches , which they had cut from the fields .
ASV	Mark	11	9	And they that went before , and they that followed , cried , Hosanna ; Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord :
ASV	Mark	11	10	Blessed is the kingdom that cometh , the kingdom of our father David : Hosanna in the highest .
ASV	Mark	11	12	And on the morrow , when they were come out from Bethany , he hungered .
ASV	Mark	11	13	And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves , he came , if haply he might find anything thereon : and when he came to it , he found nothing but leaves ; for it was not the season of figs .
ASV	Mark	11	14	And he answered and said unto it , No man eat fruit from thee henceforward for ever . And his disciples heard it .
ASV	Mark	11	15	And they come to Jerusalem : and he entered into the temple , and began to cast out them that sold and them that bought in the temple , and overthrew the tables of the money-changers , and the seats of them that sold the doves ;
ASV	Mark	11	16	and he would not suffer that any man should carry a vessel through the temple .
ASV	Mark	11	17	And he taught , and said unto them , Is it not written , [ d ] My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations ? [ e ] but ye have made it a den of robbers .
ASV	Mark	11	18	And the chief priests and the scribes heard it , and sought how they might destroy him : for they feared him , for all the multitude was astonished at his teaching .
ASV	Mark	11	19	And [ f ] every evening [ g ] he went forth out of the city .
ASV	Mark	11	20	And as they passed by in the morning , they saw the fig tree withered away from the roots .
ASV	Mark	11	21	And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him , Rabbi , behold , the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away .
ASV	Mark	11	22	And Jesus answering saith unto them , Have faith in God .
ASV	Mark	11	23	Verily I say unto you , Whosoever shall say unto this mountain , Be thou taken up and cast into the sea ; and shall not doubt in his heart , but shall believe that what he saith cometh to pass ; he shall have it .
ASV	Mark	11	24	Therefore I say unto you , All things whatsoever ye pray and ask for , believe that ye [ h ] receive them , and ye shall have them .
ASV	Mark	11	25	And whensoever ye stand praying , forgive , if ye have aught against any one ; that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses . [ i ]
ASV	Mark	11	27	And they come again to Jerusalem : and as he was walking in the temple , there come to him the chief priests , and the scribes , and the elders ;
ASV	Mark	11	28	and they said unto him , By what authority doest thou these things ? or who gave thee this authority to do these things ?
ASV	Mark	11	29	And Jesus said unto them , I will ask of you one [ j ] question , and answer me , and I will tell you by what authority I do these things .
ASV	Mark	11	30	The baptism of John , was it from heaven , or from men ? answer me .
ASV	Mark	11	31	And they reasoned with themselves , saying , If we shall say , From heaven ; he will say , Why then did ye not believe him ?
ASV	Mark	11	32	[ k ] But should we say , From men—they feared the people : [ l ] for all verily held John to be a prophet .
ASV	Mark	11	33	And they answered Jesus and say , We know not . And Jesus saith unto them , Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things .

ASV	Mark	12	12	And they sought to lay hold on him ; and they feared the multitude ; for they perceived that he spake the parable against them : and they left him , and went away .
ASV	Mark	12	2	And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a [ a ] servant , that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruits of the vineyard .
ASV	Mark	12	3	And they took him , and beat him , and sent him away empty .
ASV	Mark	12	4	And again he sent unto them another [ b ] servant ; and him they wounded in the head , and handled shamefully .
ASV	Mark	12	5	And he sent another ; and him they killed : and many others ; beating some , and killing some .
ASV	Mark	12	6	He had yet one , a beloved son : he sent him last unto them , saying , They will reverence my son .
ASV	Mark	12	7	But those husbandmen said among themselves , This is the heir ; come , let us kill him , and the inheritance shall be ours .
ASV	Mark	12	8	And they took him , and killed him , and cast him forth out of the vineyard .
ASV	Mark	12	9	What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do ? he will come and destroy the husbandmen , and will give the vineyard unto others .
ASV	Mark	12	10	Have ye not read even this scripture : [ c ] The stone which the builders rejected , The same was made the head of the corner ;
ASV	Mark	12	11	This was from the Lord , And it is marvellous in our eyes ?
ASV	Mark	12	13	And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians , that they might catch him in talk .
ASV	Mark	12	14	And when they were come , they say unto him , Teacher , we know that thou art true , and carest not for any one ; for thou regardest not the person of men , but of a truth teachest the way of God : Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar , or not ?
ASV	Mark	12	15	Shall we give , or shall we not give ? But he , knowing their hypocrisy , said unto them , Why make ye trial of me ? bring me a [ d ] denarius , that I may see it .
ASV	Mark	12	16	And they brought it . And he saith unto them , Whose is this image and superscription ? And they said unto him , Caesar ’ s .
ASV	Mark	12	17	And Jesus said unto them , Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar ’ s , and unto God the things that are God ’ s . And they marvelled greatly at him .
ASV	Mark	12	18	And there come unto him Sadducees , who say that there is no resurrection ; and they asked him , saying ,
ASV	Mark	12	19	Teacher , Moses wrote unto us , [ e ] If a man ’ s brother die , and leave a wife behind him , and leave no child , that his brother should take his wife , and raise up seed unto his brother .
ASV	Mark	12	20	There were seven brethren : and the first took a wife , and dying left no seed ;
ASV	Mark	12	21	and the second took her , and died , leaving no seed behind him ; and the third likewise :
ASV	Mark	12	22	and the seven left no seed . Last of all the woman also died .
ASV	Mark	12	23	In the resurrection whose wife shall she be of them ? for the seven had her to wife .
ASV	Mark	12	24	Jesus said unto them , Is it not for this cause that ye err , that ye know not the scriptures , nor the power of God ?
ASV	Mark	12	25	For when they shall rise from the dead , they neither marry , nor are given in marriage ; but are as angels in heaven .
ASV	Mark	12	26	But as touching the dead , that they are raised ; have ye not read in the book of Moses , in the place concerning the Bush , how God spake unto him , saying , [ f ] I am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ?
ASV	Mark	12	27	He is not the God of the dead , but of the living : ye do greatly err .
ASV	Mark	12	28	And one of the scribes came , and heard them questioning together , and knowing that he had answered them well , asked him , What commandment is the first of all ?
ASV	Mark	12	29	Jesus answered , The first is , [ g ] Hear , O Israel ; [ h ] The Lord our God , the Lord is one :
ASV	Mark	12	30	and thou shalt love the Lord thy God [ i ] with all thy heart , and [ j ] with all thy soul , and [ k ] with all thy mind , and [ l ] with all thy strength .
ASV	Mark	12	31	The second is this , [ m ] Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself . There is none other commandment greater than these .
ASV	Mark	12	32	And the scribe said unto him , Of a truth , Teacher , thou hast well said that he is one ; and there is none other but he :
ASV	Mark	12	33	and to love him with all the heart , and with all the understanding , and with all the strength , and to love his neighbor as himself , is much more than all whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices .
ASV	Mark	12	34	And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly , he said unto him , Thou art not far from the kingdom of God . And no man after that durst ask him any question .
ASV	Mark	12	35	And Jesus answered and said , as he taught in the temple , How say the scribes that the Christ is the son of David ?
ASV	Mark	12	36	David himself said in the Holy Spirit , [ n ] The Lord said unto my Lord , Sit thou on my right hand , Till I make thine enemies [ o ] the footstool of thy feet .
ASV	Mark	12	37	David himself calleth him Lord ; and whence is he his son ? And [ p ] the common people heard him gladly .
ASV	Mark	12	38	And in his teaching he said , Beware of the scribes , who desire to walk in long robes , and to have salutations in the marketplaces ,
ASV	Mark	12	39	and chief seats in the synagogues , and chief places at feasts :
ASV	Mark	12	40	they that devour widows ’ houses , [ q ] and for a pretence make long prayers ; these shall receive greater condemnation .
ASV	Mark	12	41	And he sat down over against the treasury , and beheld how the multitude cast [ r ] money into the treasury : and many that were rich cast in much .
ASV	Mark	12	42	And there came [ s ] a poor widow , and she cast in two mites , which make a farthing .
ASV	Mark	12	43	And he called unto him his disciples , and said unto them , Verily I say unto you , This poor widow cast in more than all they that are casting into the treasury :
ASV	Mark	12	44	for they all did cast in of their superfluity ; but she of her want did cast in all that she had , even all her living .

ASV	Mark	13	13	And ye shall be hated of all men for my name ’ s sake : but he that endureth to the end , the same shall be saved .
ASV	Mark	13	2	And Jesus said unto him , Seest thou these great buildings ? there shall not be left here one stone upon another , which shall not be thrown down .
ASV	Mark	13	3	And as he sat on the mount of Olives over against the temple , Peter and [ a ] James and John and Andrew asked him privately ,
ASV	Mark	13	4	Tell us , when shall these things be ? and what shall be the sign when these things are all about to be accomplished ?
ASV	Mark	13	5	And Jesus began to say unto them , Take heed that no man lead you astray .
ASV	Mark	13	6	Many shall come in my name , saying , I am he ; and shall lead many astray .
ASV	Mark	13	7	And when ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars , be not troubled : these things must needs come to pass ; but the end is not yet .
ASV	Mark	13	8	For nation shall rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom ; there shall be earthquakes in divers places ; there shall be famines : these things are the beginning of travail .
ASV	Mark	13	9	But take ye heed to yourselves : for they shall deliver you up to councils ; and in synagogues shall ye be beaten ; and before governors and kings shall ye stand for my sake , for a testimony unto them .
ASV	Mark	13	10	And the [ b ] gospel must first be preached unto all the nations .
ASV	Mark	13	11	And when they lead you to judgment , and deliver you up , be not anxious beforehand what ye shall speak : but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour , that speak ye ; for it is not ye that speak , but the Holy Spirit .
ASV	Mark	13	12	And brother shall [ c ] deliver up brother to death , and the father his child ; and children shall rise up against parents , and [ d ] cause them to be put to death .
ASV	Mark	13	14	But when ye see the abomination of desolation standing where he ought not ( let him that readeth understand ) , then let them that are in Judaea flee unto the mountains :
ASV	Mark	13	15	and let him that is on the housetop not go down , nor enter in , to take anything out of his house :
ASV	Mark	13	16	and let him that is in the field not return back to take his cloak .
ASV	Mark	13	17	But woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days !
ASV	Mark	13	18	And pray ye that it be not in the winter .
ASV	Mark	13	19	For those days shall be tribulation , such as there hath not been the like from the beginning of the creation which God created until now , and never shall be .
ASV	Mark	13	20	And except the Lord had shortened the days , no flesh would have been saved ; but for the elect ’ s sake , whom he chose , he shortened the days .
ASV	Mark	13	21	And then if any man shall say unto you , Lo , here is the Christ ; or , Lo , there ; believe [ e ] it not :
ASV	Mark	13	22	for there shall arise false Christs and false prophets , and shall show signs and wonders , that they may lead astray , if possible , the elect .
ASV	Mark	13	23	But take ye heed : behold , I have told you all things beforehand .
ASV	Mark	13	24	But in those days , after that tribulation , the sun shall be darkened , and the moon shall not give her light ,
ASV	Mark	13	25	and the stars shall be falling from heaven , and the powers that are in the heavens shall be shaken .
ASV	Mark	13	26	And then shall they see the Son of man coming in clouds with great power and glory .
ASV	Mark	13	27	And then shall he send forth the angels , and shall gather together his elect from the four winds , from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven .
ASV	Mark	13	28	Now from the fig tree learn her parable : when her branch is now become tender , and putteth forth its leaves , ye know that the summer is nigh ;
ASV	Mark	13	29	even so ye also , when ye see these things coming to pass , know ye that [ f ] he is nigh , even at the doors .
ASV	Mark	13	30	Verily I say unto you , This generation shall not pass away , until all these things be accomplished .
ASV	Mark	13	31	Heaven and earth shall pass away : but my words shall not pass away .
ASV	Mark	13	32	But of that day or that hour knoweth no one , not even the angels in heaven , neither the Son , but the Father .
ASV	Mark	13	33	Take ye heed , watch [ g ] and pray : for ye know not when the time is .
ASV	Mark	13	34	It is as when a man , sojourning in another country , having left his house , and given authority to his [ h ] servants , to each one his work , commanded also the porter to watch .
ASV	Mark	13	35	Watch therefore : for ye know not when the lord of the house cometh , whether at even , or at midnight , or at cockcrowing , or in the morning ;
ASV	Mark	13	36	lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping .
ASV	Mark	13	37	And what I say unto you I say unto all , Watch .

ASV	Mark	14	14	and wheresoever he shall enter in , say to the master of the house , The Teacher saith , Where is my guest-chamber , where I shall eat the passover with my disciples ?
ASV	Mark	14	2	for they said , Not during the feast , lest haply there shall be a tumult of the people .
ASV	Mark	14	3	And while he was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper , as he sat at meat , there came a woman having [ a ] an alabaster cruse of ointment of [ b ] pure nard very costly ; and she brake the cruse , and poured it over his head .
ASV	Mark	14	4	But there were some that had indignation among themselves , saying , To what purpose hath this waste of the ointment been made ?
ASV	Mark	14	5	For this ointment might have been sold for above three hundred [ c ] shillings , and given to the poor . And they murmured against her .
ASV	Mark	14	6	But Jesus said , Let her alone ; why trouble ye her ? she hath wrought a good work on me .
ASV	Mark	14	7	For ye have the poor always with you , and whensoever ye will ye can do them good : but me ye have not always .
ASV	Mark	14	8	She hath done what she could ; she hath anointed my body beforehand for the burying .
ASV	Mark	14	9	And verily I say unto you , Wheresoever the [ d ] gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world , that also which this woman hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her .
ASV	Mark	14	10	And Judas Iscariot , [ e ] he that was one of the twelve , went away unto the chief priests , that he might [ f ] deliver him unto them .
ASV	Mark	14	11	And they , when they heard it , were glad , and promised to give him money . And he sought how he might conveniently [ g ] deliver him unto them .
ASV	Mark	14	12	And on the first day of unleavened bread , when they sacrificed the passover , his disciples say unto him , Where wilt thou that we go and make ready that thou mayest eat the passover ?
ASV	Mark	14	13	And he sendeth two of his disciples , and saith unto them , Go into the city , and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water : follow him ;
ASV	Mark	14	15	And he will himself show you a large upper room furnished and ready : and there make ready for us .
ASV	Mark	14	16	And the disciples went forth , and came into the city , and found as he had said unto them : and they made ready the passover .
ASV	Mark	14	17	And when it was evening he cometh with the twelve .
ASV	Mark	14	18	And as they [ h ] sat and were eating , Jesus said , Verily I say unto you , One of you shall [ i ] betray me , even he that eateth with me .
ASV	Mark	14	19	They began to be sorrowful , and to say unto him one by one , Is it I ?
ASV	Mark	14	20	And he said unto them , It is one of the twelve , he that dippeth with me in the dish .
ASV	Mark	14	21	For the Son of man goeth , even as it is written of him : but woe unto that man through whom the Son of man is [ j ] betrayed ! good were it [ k ] for that man if he had not been born .
ASV	Mark	14	22	And as they were eating , he took [ l ] bread , and when he had blessed , he brake it , and gave to them , and said , Take ye : this is my body .
ASV	Mark	14	23	And he took a cup , and when he had given thanks , he gave to them : and they all drank of it .
ASV	Mark	14	24	And he said unto them , This is my blood of the [ m ] covenant , which is poured out for many .
ASV	Mark	14	25	Verily I say unto you , I shall no more drink of the fruit of the vine , until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God .
ASV	Mark	14	26	And when they had sung a hymn , they went out unto the mount of Olives .
ASV	Mark	14	27	And Jesus saith unto them , All ye shall be [ n ] offended : for it is written , [ o ] I will smite the shepherd , and the sheep shall be scattered abroad .
ASV	Mark	14	28	Howbeit , after I am raised up , I will go before you into Galilee .
ASV	Mark	14	29	But Peter said unto him , Although all shall be [ p ] offended , yet will not I .
ASV	Mark	14	30	And Jesus saith unto him , Verily I say unto thee , that thou to-day , even this night , before the cock crow twice , shalt deny me thrice .
ASV	Mark	14	31	But he spake exceeding vehemently , If I must die with thee , I will not deny thee . And in like manner also said they all .
ASV	Mark	14	32	And they come unto [ q ] a place which was named Gethsemane : and he saith unto his disciples , Sit ye here , while I pray .
ASV	Mark	14	33	And he taketh with him Peter and [ r ] James and John , and began to be greatly amazed , and sore troubled .
ASV	Mark	14	34	And he saith unto them , My soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death : abide ye here , and watch .
ASV	Mark	14	35	And he went forward a little , and fell on the ground , and prayed that , if it were possible , the hour might pass away from him .
ASV	Mark	14	36	And he said , Abba , Father , all things are possible unto thee ; remove this cup from me : howbeit not what I will , but what thou wilt .
ASV	Mark	14	37	And he cometh , and findeth them sleeping , and saith unto Peter , Simon , sleepest thou ? couldest thou not watch one hour ?
ASV	Mark	14	38	[ s ] Watch and pray , that ye enter not into temptation : the spirit indeed is willing , but the flesh is weak .
ASV	Mark	14	39	And again he went away , and prayed , saying the same words .
ASV	Mark	14	40	And again he came , and found them sleeping , for their eyes were very heavy ; and they knew not what to answer him .
ASV	Mark	14	41	And he cometh the third time , and saith unto them , [ t ] Sleep on now , and take your rest : it is enough ; the hour is come ; behold , the Son of man is [ u ] betrayed into the hands of sinners .
ASV	Mark	14	42	Arise , let us be going : behold , he that [ v ] betrayeth me is at hand .
ASV	Mark	14	43	And straightway , while he yet spake , cometh Judas , one of the twelve , and with him a multitude with swords and staves , from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders .
ASV	Mark	14	44	Now he that [ w ] betrayed him had given them a token , saying , Whomsoever I shall kiss , that is he ; take him , and lead him away safely .
ASV	Mark	14	45	And when he was come , straightway he came to him , and saith , Rabbi ; and [ x ] kissed him .
ASV	Mark	14	46	And they laid hands on him , and took him .
ASV	Mark	14	47	But a certain one of them that stood by drew his sword , and smote the [ y ] servant of the high priest , and struck off his ear .
ASV	Mark	14	48	And Jesus answered and said unto them , Are ye come out , as against a robber , with swords and staves to seize me ?
ASV	Mark	14	49	I was daily with you in the temple teaching , and ye took me not : but this is done that the scriptures might be fulfilled .
ASV	Mark	14	50	And they all left him , and fled .
ASV	Mark	14	51	And a certain young man followed with him , having a linen cloth cast about him , over his naked body : and they lay hold on him ;
ASV	Mark	14	52	but he left the linen cloth , and fled naked .
ASV	Mark	14	53	And they led Jesus away to the high priest : and there come together with him all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes .
ASV	Mark	14	54	And Peter had followed him afar off , even within , into the court of the high priest ; and he was sitting with the officers , and warming himself in the light of the fire .
ASV	Mark	14	55	Now the chief priests and the whole council sought witness against Jesus to put him to death ; and found it not .
ASV	Mark	14	56	For many bare false witness against him , and their witness agreed not together .
ASV	Mark	14	57	And there stood up certain , and bare false witness against him , saying ,
ASV	Mark	14	58	We heard him say , I will destroy this [ z ] temple that is made with hands , and in three days I will build another made without hands .
ASV	Mark	14	59	And not even so did their witness agree together .
ASV	Mark	14	60	And the high priest stood up in the midst , and asked Jesus , saying , Answerest thou nothing ? what is it which these witness against thee ?
ASV	Mark	14	61	But he held his peace , and answered nothing . Again the high priest asked him , and saith unto him , Art thou the Christ , the Son of the Blessed ?
ASV	Mark	14	62	And Jesus said , I am : and ye shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of Power , and coming with the clouds of heaven .
ASV	Mark	14	63	And the high priest rent his clothes , and saith , What further need have we of witnesses ?
ASV	Mark	14	64	Ye have heard the blasphemy : what think ye ? And they all condemned him to be [ aa ] worthy of death .
ASV	Mark	14	65	And some began to spit on him , and to cover his face , and to buffet him , and to say unto him , Prophesy : and the officers received him with [ ab ] blows of their hands .
ASV	Mark	14	66	And as Peter was beneath in the court , there cometh one of the maids of the high priest ;
ASV	Mark	14	67	and seeing Peter warming himself , she looked upon him , and saith , Thou also wast with the Nazarene , even Jesus .
ASV	Mark	14	68	But he denied , saying , [ ac ] I neither know , nor understand what thou sayest : and he went out into the [ ad ] porch ; [ ae ] and the cock crew .
ASV	Mark	14	69	And the maid saw him , and began again to say to them that stood by , This is one of them .
ASV	Mark	14	70	But he again denied it . And after a little while again they that stood by said to Peter , Of a truth thou art one of them ; for thou art a Galilaean .
ASV	Mark	14	71	But he began to curse , and to swear , I know not this man of whom ye speak .
ASV	Mark	14	72	And straightway the second time the cock crew . And Peter called to mind the word , how that Jesus said unto him , Before the cock crow twice , thou shalt deny me thrice . [ af ] And when he thought thereon , he wept .

ASV	Mark	15	15	And Pilate , wishing to content the multitude , released unto them Barabbas , and delivered Jesus , when he had scourged him , to be crucified .
ASV	Mark	15	2	And Pilate asked him , Art thou the King of the Jews ? And he answering saith unto him , Thou sayest .
ASV	Mark	15	3	And the chief priests accused him of many things .
ASV	Mark	15	4	And Pilate again asked him , saying , Answerest thou nothing ? behold how many things they accuse thee of .
ASV	Mark	15	5	But Jesus no more answered anything ; insomuch that Pilate marvelled .
ASV	Mark	15	6	Now at [ a ] the feast he used to release unto them one prisoner , whom they asked of him .
ASV	Mark	15	7	And there was one called Barabbas , lying bound with them that had made insurrection , men who in the insurrection had committed murder .
ASV	Mark	15	8	And the multitude went up and began to ask him to do as he was wont to do unto them .
ASV	Mark	15	9	And Pilate answered them , saying , Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews ?
ASV	Mark	15	10	For he perceived that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up .
ASV	Mark	15	11	But the chief priests stirred up the multitude , that he should rather release Barabbas unto them .
ASV	Mark	15	12	And Pilate again answered and said unto them , What then shall I do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews ?
ASV	Mark	15	13	And they cried out again , Crucify him .
ASV	Mark	15	14	And Pilate said unto them , Why , what evil hath he done ? But they cried out exceedingly , Crucify him .
ASV	Mark	15	16	And the soldiers led him away within the court , which is the [ b ] Praetorium ; and they call together the whole [ c ] band .
ASV	Mark	15	17	And they clothe him with purple , and platting a crown of thorns , they put it on him ;
ASV	Mark	15	18	and they began to salute him , Hail , King of the Jews !
ASV	Mark	15	19	And they smote his head with a reed , and spat upon him , and bowing their knees [ d ] worshipped him .
ASV	Mark	15	20	And when they had mocked him , they took off from him the purple , and put on him his garments . And they lead him out to crucify him .
ASV	Mark	15	21	And they [ e ] compel one passing by , Simon of Cyrene , coming from the country , the father of Alexander and Rufus , to go with them , that he might bear his cross .
ASV	Mark	15	22	And they bring him unto the place Golgotha , which is , being interpreted , The place of a skull .
ASV	Mark	15	23	And they offered him wine mingled with myrrh : but he received it not .
ASV	Mark	15	24	And they crucify him , and part his garments among them , casting lots upon them , what each should take .
ASV	Mark	15	25	And it was the third hour , and they crucified him .
ASV	Mark	15	26	And the superscription of his accusation was written over , the King of the Jews .
ASV	Mark	15	27	And with him they crucify two robbers ; one on his right hand , and one on his left . [ f ]
ASV	Mark	15	29	And they that passed by railed on him , wagging their heads , and saying , Ha ! thou that destroyest the [ g ] temple , and buildest it in three days ,
ASV	Mark	15	30	save thyself , and come down from the cross .
ASV	Mark	15	31	In like manner also the chief priests mocking him among themselves with the scribes said , He saved others ; [ h ] himself he can not save .
ASV	Mark	15	32	Let the Christ , the King of Israel , now come down from the cross , that we may see and believe . And they that were crucified with him reproached him .
ASV	Mark	15	33	And when the sixth hour was come , there was darkness over the whole [ i ] land until the ninth hour .
ASV	Mark	15	34	And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice , Eloi , Eloi , lama sabachthani ? which is , being interpreted , [ j ] My God , my God , [ k ] why hast thou forsaken me ?
ASV	Mark	15	35	And some of them that stood by , when they heard it , said , Behold , he calleth Elijah .
ASV	Mark	15	36	And one ran , and filling a sponge full of vinegar , put it on a reed , and gave him to drink , saying , Let be ; let us see whether Elijah cometh to take him down .
ASV	Mark	15	37	And Jesus uttered a loud voice , and gave up the ghost .
ASV	Mark	15	38	And the veil of the [ l ] temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom .
ASV	Mark	15	39	And when the centurion , who stood by over against him , saw that he [ m ] so gave up the ghost , he said , Truly this man was [ n ] the Son of God .
ASV	Mark	15	40	And there were also women beholding from afar : among whom were both Mary Magdalene , and Mary the mother of [ o ] James the [ p ] less and of Joses , and Salome ;
ASV	Mark	15	41	who , when he was in Galilee , followed him , and ministered unto him ; and many other women that came up with him unto Jerusalem .
ASV	Mark	15	42	And when even was now come , because it was the Preparation , that is , the day before the sabbath ,
ASV	Mark	15	43	there came Joseph of Arimathaea , a councillor of honorable estate , who also himself was looking for the kingdom of God ; and he boldly went in unto Pilate , and asked for the body of Jesus .
ASV	Mark	15	44	And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead : and calling unto him the centurion , he asked him whether [ q ] he had been any while dead .
ASV	Mark	15	45	And when he learned it of the centurion , he granted the corpse to Joseph .
ASV	Mark	15	46	And he bought a linen cloth , and taking him down , wound him in the linen cloth , and laid him in a tomb which had been hewn out of a rock ; and he rolled a stone against the door of the tomb .
ASV	Mark	15	47	And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he was laid . Footnotes - Mark 15:6 Or , a feast - Mark 15:16 Or , palace - Mark 15:16 Or , cohort - Mark 15:19 See marginal note on 5:6 . - Mark 15:21 Greek impress . - Mark 15:27 Many ancient authorities insert verse

ASV	Mark	16	3	And they were saying among themselves , Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the tomb ?
ASV	Mark	16	4	and looking up , they see that the stone is rolled back : for it was exceeding great .
ASV	Mark	16	5	And entering into the tomb , they saw a young man sitting on the right side , arrayed in a white robe ; and they were amazed .
ASV	Mark	16	6	And he saith unto them , Be not amazed : ye seek Jesus , the Nazarene , who hath been crucified : he is risen ; he is not here : behold , the place where they laid him !
ASV	Mark	16	7	But go , tell his disciples and Peter , He goeth before you into Galilee : there shall ye see him , as he said unto you .
ASV	Mark	16	8	And they went out , and fled from the tomb ; for trembling and astonishment had come upon them : and they said nothing to any one ; for they were afraid .

ASV	Mark	16	10	She went and told them that had been with him , as they mourned and wept .
ASV	Mark	16	11	And they , when they heard that he was alive , and had been seen of her , disbelieved .
ASV	Mark	16	12	And after these things he was manifested in another form unto two of them , as they walked , on their way into the country .
ASV	Mark	16	13	And they went away and told it unto the rest : neither believed they them .
ASV	Mark	16	14	And afterward he was manifested unto the eleven themselves as they sat at meat ; and he upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart , because they believed not them that had seen him after he was risen .
ASV	Mark	16	15	And he said unto them , Go ye into all the world , and preach the [ c ] gospel to the whole creation .
ASV	Mark	16	17	And these signs shall accompany them that believe : in my name shall they cast out demons ; they shall speak with [ d ] new tongues ;
ASV	Mark	16	18	they shall take up serpents , and if they drink any deadly thing , it shall in no wise hurt them ; they shall lay hands on the sick , and they shall recover .
ASV	Mark	16	19	So then the Lord Jesus , after he had spoken unto them , was received up into heaven , and sat down at the right hand of God .
ASV	Mark	16	20	And they went forth , and preached everywhere , the Lord working with them , and confirming the word by the signs that followed . Amen . Footnotes - Mark 16:1 Or , Jacob - Mark 16:9 The two oldest Greek manuscripts , and some other authorities , omit from verse
ASV	Luke	1	1	Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to draw up a narrative concerning those matters which have been [ a ] fulfilled among us ,
ASV	Luke	1	2	even as they delivered them unto us , who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word ,
ASV	Luke	1	3	it seemed good to me also , having traced the course of all things accurately from the first , to write unto thee in order , most excellent Theophilus ;
ASV	Luke	1	4	that thou mightest know the certainty concerning the [ b ] things [ c ] wherein thou wast instructed .
ASV	Luke	1	5	There was in the days of Herod , king of Judaea , a certain priest named Zacharias , of the course of Abijah : and he had a wife of the daughters of Aaron , and her name was Elisabeth .
ASV	Luke	1	6	And they were both righteous before God , walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless .
ASV	Luke	1	7	And they had no child , because that Elisabeth was barren , and they both were now [ d ] well stricken in years .
ASV	Luke	1	8	Now it came to pass , while he executed the priest ’ s office before God in the order of his course ,
ASV	Luke	1	9	according to the custom of the priest ’ s office , his lot was to enter into the [ e ] temple of the Lord and burn incense .
ASV	Luke	1	10	And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the hour of incense .
ASV	Luke	1	11	And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense .
ASV	Luke	1	12	And Zacharias was troubled when he saw him , and fear fell upon him .
ASV	Luke	1	13	But the angel said unto him , Fear not , Zacharias : because thy supplication is heard , and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son , and thou shalt call his name John .
ASV	Luke	1	14	And thou shalt have joy and gladness ; and many shall rejoice at his birth .
ASV	Luke	1	15	For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord , and he shall drink no wine nor [ f ] strong drink ; and he shall be filled with the Holy Spirit , even from his mother ’ s womb .
ASV	Luke	1	16	And many of the children of Israel shall he turn unto the Lord their God .
ASV	Luke	1	17	And he shall [ g ] go before his face in the spirit and power of Elijah , to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children , and the disobedient to walk in the wisdom of the just ; to make ready for the Lord a people prepared for him .
ASV	Luke	1	18	And Zacharias said unto the angel , Whereby shall I know this ? for I am an old man , and my wife [ h ] well stricken in years .
ASV	Luke	1	19	And the angel answering said unto him , I am Gabriel , that stand in the presence of God ; and I was sent to speak unto thee , and to bring thee these good tidings .
ASV	Luke	1	20	And behold , thou shalt be silent and not able to speak , until the day that these things shall come to pass , because thou believedst not my words , which shall be fulfilled in their season .
ASV	Luke	1	21	And the people were waiting for Zacharias , and they marvelled [ i ] while he tarried in the [ j ] temple .
ASV	Luke	1	22	And when he came out , he could not speak unto them : and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the [ k ] temple : and he continued making signs unto them , and remained dumb .
ASV	Luke	1	23	And it came to pass , when the days of his ministration were fulfilled , he departed unto his house .
ASV	Luke	1	24	And after these days Elisabeth his wife conceived ; and she hid herself five months , saying ,
ASV	Luke	1	25	Thus hath the Lord done unto me in the days wherein he looked upon me , to take away my reproach among men .
ASV	Luke	1	26	Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee , named Nazareth ,
ASV	Luke	1	27	to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph , of the house of David ; and the virgin ’ s name was Mary .
ASV	Luke	1	28	And he came in unto her , and said , Hail , thou that art [ l ] highly favored , the Lord is with thee [ m ] .
ASV	Luke	1	29	But she was greatly troubled at the saying , and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this might be .
ASV	Luke	1	30	And the angel said unto her , Fear not , Mary : for thou hast found [ n ] favor with God .
ASV	Luke	1	31	And behold , thou shalt conceive in thy womb , and bring forth a son , and shalt call his name Jesus .
ASV	Luke	1	32	He shall be great , and shall be called the Son of the Most High : and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David :
ASV	Luke	1	33	and he shall reign over the house of Jacob [ o ] for ever ; and of his kingdom there shall be no end .
ASV	Luke	1	34	And Mary said unto the angel , How shall this be , seeing I know not a man ?
ASV	Luke	1	35	And the angel answered and said unto her , The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee , and the power of the Most High shall overshadow thee : wherefore also [ p ] the holy thing which is begotten [ q ] shall be called the Son of God .
ASV	Luke	1	36	And behold , Elisabeth thy kinswoman , she also hath conceived a son in her old age ; and this is the sixth month with her that [ r ] was called barren .
ASV	Luke	1	37	For no word from God shall be void of power .
ASV	Luke	1	38	And Mary said , Behold , the [ s ] handmaid of the Lord ; be it unto me according to thy word . And the angel departed from her .
ASV	Luke	1	39	And Mary arose in these days and went into the hill country with haste , into a city of Judah ;
ASV	Luke	1	40	and entered into the house of Zacharias and saluted Elisabeth .
ASV	Luke	1	41	And it came to pass , when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary , the babe leaped in her womb ; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit ;

ASV	Luke	1	44	For behold , when the voice of thy salutation came into mine ears , the babe leaped in my womb for joy .
ASV	Luke	1	45	And blessed is she that [ t ] believed ; for there shall be a fulfilment of the things which have been spoken to her from the Lord .
ASV	Luke	1	46	And Mary said , My soul doth magnify the Lord ,
ASV	Luke	1	47	And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour .
ASV	Luke	1	48	For he hath looked upon the low estate of his [ u ] handmaid : For behold , from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed .
ASV	Luke	1	49	For he that is mighty hath done to me great things ; And holy is his name .
ASV	Luke	1	50	And his mercy is unto generations and generations On them that fear him .
ASV	Luke	1	51	He hath showed strength with his arm ; He hath scattered the proud [ v ] in the imagination of their heart .
ASV	Luke	1	52	He hath put down princes from their thrones , And hath exalted them of low degree .
ASV	Luke	1	53	The hungry he hath filled with good things ; And the rich he hath sent empty away .
ASV	Luke	1	54	He hath given help to Israel his servant , That he might remember mercy
ASV	Luke	1	55	( As he spake unto our fathers ) Toward Abraham and his seed for ever .
ASV	Luke	1	56	And Mary abode with her about three months , and returned unto her house .
ASV	Luke	1	57	Now Elisabeth ’ s time was fulfilled that she should be delivered ; and she brought forth a son .
ASV	Luke	1	58	And her neighbors and her kinsfolk heard that the Lord had magnified his mercy towards her ; and they rejoiced with her .
ASV	Luke	1	59	And it came to pass on the eighth day , that they came to circumcise the child ; and they would have called him Zacharias , after the name of his father .
ASV	Luke	1	60	And his mother answered and said , Not so ; but he shall be called John .
ASV	Luke	1	61	And they said unto her , There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name .
ASV	Luke	1	62	And they made signs to his father , what he would have him called .
ASV	Luke	1	63	And he asked for a writing tablet , and wrote , saying , His name is John . And they marvelled all .
ASV	Luke	1	64	And his mouth was opened immediately , and his tongue loosed , and he spake , blessing God .
ASV	Luke	1	65	And fear came on all that dwelt round about them : and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea .
ASV	Luke	1	66	And all that heard them laid them up in their heart , saying , What then shall this child be ? For the hand of the Lord was with him .
ASV	Luke	1	67	And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Spirit , and prophesied , saying ,
ASV	Luke	1	68	Blessed be the Lord , the God of Israel ; For he hath visited and wrought redemption for his people ,
ASV	Luke	1	69	And hath raised up a horn of salvation for us In the house of his servant David
ASV	Luke	1	70	( As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets that have been from of old ) ,
ASV	Luke	1	71	Salvation from our enemies , and from the hand of all that hate us ;
ASV	Luke	1	72	To show mercy towards our fathers , And to remember his holy covenant ;
ASV	Luke	1	73	The oath which he sware unto Abraham our father ,
ASV	Luke	1	74	To grant unto us that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies Should serve him without fear ,
ASV	Luke	1	75	In holiness and righteousness before him all our days .
ASV	Luke	1	76	Yea and thou , child , shalt be called the prophet of the Most High : For thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to make ready his ways ;
ASV	Luke	1	77	To give knowledge of salvation unto his people In the remission of their sins ,
ASV	Luke	1	78	Because of the [ w ] tender mercy of our God , [ x ] Whereby the dayspring from on high [ y ] shall visit us ,
ASV	Luke	1	79	To shine upon them that sit in darkness and the shadow of death ; To guide our feet into the way of peace .

ASV	Luke	2	13	And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God , and saying ,
ASV	Luke	2	15	And it came to pass , when the angels went away from them into heaven , the shepherds said one to another , Let us now go even unto Bethlehem , and see this [ f ] thing that is come to pass , which the Lord hath made known unto us .
ASV	Luke	2	16	And they came with haste , and found both Mary and Joseph , and the babe lying in the manger .
ASV	Luke	2	17	And when they saw it , they made known concerning the saying which was spoken to them about this child .
ASV	Luke	2	18	And all that heard it wondered at the things which were spoken unto them by the shepherds .
ASV	Luke	2	19	But Mary kept all these [ g ] sayings , pondering them in her heart .
ASV	Luke	2	20	And the shepherds returned , glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen , even as it was spoken unto them .
ASV	Luke	2	21	And when eight days were fulfilled for circumcising him , his name was called Jesus , which was so called by the angel before he was conceived in the womb .
ASV	Luke	2	22	And when the days of their purification [ h ] according to the law of Moses were fulfilled , they brought him up to Jerusalem , to present him to the Lord
ASV	Luke	2	23	( as it is written in the law of the Lord , [ i ] Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord ) ,
ASV	Luke	2	24	and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord , [ j ] A pair of turtledoves , or two young pigeons .
ASV	Luke	2	25	And behold , there was a man in Jerusalem , whose name was Simeon ; and this man was righteous and devout , looking for the consolation of Israel : and the Holy Spirit was upon him .
ASV	Luke	2	26	And it had been revealed unto him by the Holy Spirit , that he should not see death , before he had seen the Lord ’ s Christ .
ASV	Luke	2	27	And he came in the Spirit into the temple : and when the parents brought in the child Jesus , that they might do concerning him after the custom of the law ,
ASV	Luke	2	28	then he received him into his arms , and blessed God , and said ,
ASV	Luke	2	29	Now lettest thou thy [ k ] servant depart , [ l ] Lord , According to thy word , in peace ;
ASV	Luke	2	30	For mine eyes have seen thy salvation ,
ASV	Luke	2	31	Which thou hast prepared before the face of all peoples ;
ASV	Luke	2	32	A light for [ m ] revelation to the Gentiles , And the glory of thy people Israel .
ASV	Luke	2	33	And his father and his mother were marvelling at the things which were spoken concerning him ;
ASV	Luke	2	34	and Simeon blessed them , and said unto Mary his mother , Behold , this child is set for the falling and the rising of many in Israel ; and for a sign which is spoken against ;
ASV	Luke	2	35	yea and a sword shall pierce through thine own soul ; that thoughts out of many hearts may be revealed .
ASV	Luke	2	36	And there was one Anna , a prophetess , the daughter of Phanuel , of the tribe of Asher ( she was [ n ] of a great age , having lived with a husband seven years from her virginity ,
ASV	Luke	2	37	and she had been a widow even unto fourscore and four years ) , who departed not from the temple , worshipping with fastings and supplications night and day .
ASV	Luke	2	38	And coming up at that very hour she gave thanks unto God , and spake of him to all them that were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem .
ASV	Luke	2	39	And when they had accomplished all things that were according to the law of the Lord , they returned into Galilee , to their own city Nazareth .
ASV	Luke	2	40	And the child grew , and waxed strong , [ o ] filled with wisdom : and the grace of God was upon him .
ASV	Luke	2	41	And his parents went every year to Jerusalem at the feast of the passover .
ASV	Luke	2	42	And when he was twelve years old , they went up after the custom of the feast ;
ASV	Luke	2	43	and when they had fulfilled the days , as they were returning , the boy Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem ; and his parents knew it not ;
ASV	Luke	2	44	but supposing him to be in the company , they went a day ’ s journey ; and they sought for him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance :
ASV	Luke	2	45	and when they found him not , they returned to Jerusalem , seeking for him .
ASV	Luke	2	46	And it came to pass , after three days they found him in the temple , sitting in the midst of the [ p ] teachers , both hearing them , and asking them questions :
ASV	Luke	2	47	and all that heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers .
ASV	Luke	2	48	And when they saw him , they were astonished ; and his mother said unto him , [ q ] Son , why hast thou thus dealt with us ? behold , thy father and I sought thee sorrowing .
ASV	Luke	2	49	And he said unto them , How is it that ye sought me ? knew ye not that I must be [ r ] in my Father ’ s house ?
ASV	Luke	2	50	And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them .
ASV	Luke	2	51	And he went down with them , and came to Nazareth ; and he was subject unto them : and his mother kept all these [ s ] sayings in her heart .
ASV	Luke	2	52	And Jesus advanced in wisdom and [ t ] stature , and in [ u ] favor with God and men .

ASV	Luke	3	3	And he came into all the region round about the Jordan , preaching the baptism of repentance unto remission of sins ;
ASV	Luke	3	2	in the high-priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas , the word of God came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness .
ASV	Luke	3	4	as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet , [ a ] The voice of one crying in the wilderness , Make ye ready the way of the Lord , Make his paths straight .
ASV	Luke	3	5	Every valley shall be filled , And every mountain and hill shall be brought low ; And the crooked shall become straight , And the rough ways smooth ;
ASV	Luke	3	6	And all flesh shall see the salvation of God .
ASV	Luke	3	7	He said therefore to the multitudes that went out to be baptized of him , Ye offspring of vipers , who warned you to flee from the wrath to come ?
ASV	Luke	3	8	Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of [ b ] repentance , and begin not to say within yourselves , We have Abraham to our father : for I say unto you , that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham .
ASV	Luke	3	9	And even now the axe also lieth at the root of the trees : every tree therefore that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down , and cast into the fire .
ASV	Luke	3	10	And the multitudes asked him , saying , What then must we do ?
ASV	Luke	3	11	And he answered and said unto them , He that hath two coats , let him impart to him that hath none ; and he that hath food , let him do likewise .
ASV	Luke	3	12	And there came also [ c ] publicans to be baptized , and they said unto him , Teacher , what must we do ?
ASV	Luke	3	13	And he said unto them , Extort no more than that which is appointed you .
ASV	Luke	3	14	And [ d ] soldiers also asked him , saying , And we , what must we do ? And he said unto them , Extort from no man by violence , neither accuse any one wrongfully ; and be content with your wages .
ASV	Luke	3	15	And as the people were in expectation , and all men reasoned in their hearts concerning John , whether haply he were the Christ ;
ASV	Luke	3	16	John answered , saying unto them all , I indeed baptize you with water ; but there cometh he that is mightier than I , the latchet of whose shoes I am not [ e ] worthy to unloose : he shall baptize you [ f ] in the Holy Spirit and in fire :
ASV	Luke	3	17	whose fan is in his hand , thoroughly to cleanse his threshing-floor , and to gather the wheat into his garner ; but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire .
ASV	Luke	3	18	With many other exhortations therefore preached he [ g ] good tidings unto the people ;
ASV	Luke	3	19	but Herod the tetrarch , being reproved by him for Herodias his brother ’ s wife , and for all the evil things which Herod had done ,
ASV	Luke	3	20	added this also to them all , that he shut up John in prison .
ASV	Luke	3	21	Now it came to pass , when all the people were baptized , that , Jesus also having been baptized , and praying , the heaven was opened ,
ASV	Luke	3	22	and the Holy Spirit descended in a bodily form , as a dove , upon him , and a voice came out of heaven , Thou art my beloved Son ; in thee I am well pleased .
ASV	Luke	3	23	And Jesus himself , when he began to teach , was about thirty years of age , being the son ( as was supposed ) of Joseph , the son of Heli ,

ASV	Luke	4	4	And Jesus answered unto him , It is written , [ b ] Man shall not live by bread alone .
ASV	Luke	4	2	during forty days , being tempted of the devil . And he did eat nothing in those days : and when they were completed , he hungered .
ASV	Luke	4	3	And the devil said unto him , If thou art the Son of God , command this stone that it become [ a ] bread .
ASV	Luke	4	5	And he led him up , and showed him all the kingdoms of [ c ] the world in a moment of time .
ASV	Luke	4	6	And the devil said unto him , To thee will I give all this authority , and the glory of them : for it hath been delivered unto me ; and to whomsoever I will I give it .
ASV	Luke	4	7	If thou therefore wilt [ d ] worship before me , it shall all be thine .
ASV	Luke	4	8	And Jesus answered and said unto him , It is written , Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God , and him only shalt thou serve .
ASV	Luke	4	9	And he led him to Jerusalem , and set him on the [ e ] pinnacle of the temple , and said unto him , If thou art the Son of God , cast thyself down from hence :
ASV	Luke	4	10	for it is written , [ f ] He shall give his angels charge concerning thee , to guard thee :
ASV	Luke	4	11	and , On their hands they shall bear thee up , Lest haply thou dash thy foot against a stone .

ASV	Luke	4	13	And when the devil had completed every temptation , he departed from him [ h ] for a season .
ASV	Luke	4	14	And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee : and a fame went out concerning him through all the region round about .
ASV	Luke	4	15	And he taught in their synagogues , being glorified of all .
ASV	Luke	4	16	And he came to Nazareth , where he had been brought up : and he entered , as his custom was , into the synagogue on the sabbath day , and stood up to read .
ASV	Luke	4	17	And there was delivered unto him [ i ] the book of the prophet Isaiah . And he opened the [ j ] book , and found the place where it was written ,
ASV	Luke	4	18	[ k ] The Spirit of the Lord is upon me , [ l ] Because he anointed me to preach [ m ] good tidings to the poor : He hath sent me to proclaim release to the captives , And recovering of sight to the blind , To set at liberty them that are bruised ,
ASV	Luke	4	19	To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord .
ASV	Luke	4	20	And he closed the [ n ] book , and gave it back to the attendant , and sat down : and the eyes of all in the synagogue were fastened on him .
ASV	Luke	4	21	And he began to say unto them , To-day hath this scripture been fulfilled in your ears .
ASV	Luke	4	22	And all bare him witness , and wondered at the words of grace which proceeded out of his mouth : and they said , Is not this Joseph ’ s son ?
ASV	Luke	4	23	And he said unto them , Doubtless ye will say unto me this parable , Physician , heal thyself : whatsoever we have heard done at Capernaum , do also here in thine own country .
ASV	Luke	4	24	And he said , Verily I say unto you , No prophet is acceptable in his own country .
ASV	Luke	4	25	But of a truth I say unto you , There were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah , when the heaven was shut up three years and six months , when there came a great famine over all the land ;
ASV	Luke	4	26	and unto none of them was Elijah sent , but only to [ o ] Zarephath , in the land of Sidon , unto a woman that was a widow .
ASV	Luke	4	27	And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet ; and none of them was cleansed , but only Naaman the Syrian .
ASV	Luke	4	28	And they were all filled with wrath in the synagogue , as they heard these things ;
ASV	Luke	4	29	and they rose up , and cast him forth out of the city , and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built , that they might throw him down headlong .
ASV	Luke	4	30	But he passing through the midst of them went his way .
ASV	Luke	4	31	And he came down to Capernaum , a city of Galilee . And he was teaching them on the sabbath day :
ASV	Luke	4	32	and they were astonished at his teaching ; for his word was with authority .
ASV	Luke	4	33	And in the synagogue there was a man , that had a spirit of an unclean demon ; and he cried out with a loud voice ,
ASV	Luke	4	34	[ p ] Ah ! what have we to do with thee , Jesus thou Nazarene ? art thou come to destroy us ? I know thee who thou art , the Holy One of God .
ASV	Luke	4	35	And Jesus rebuked him , saying , Hold thy peace , and come out of him . And when the demon had thrown him down in the midst , he came out of him , having done him no hurt .
ASV	Luke	4	36	And amazement came upon all , and they spake together , one with another , saying , What is [ q ] this word ? for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits , and they come out .
ASV	Luke	4	37	And there went forth a rumor concerning him into every place of the region round about .
ASV	Luke	4	38	And he rose up from the synagogue , and entered into the house of Simon . And Simon ’ s wife ’ s mother was holden with a great fever ; and they besought him for her .
ASV	Luke	4	39	And he stood over her , and rebuked the fever ; and it left her : and immediately she rose up and ministered unto them .
ASV	Luke	4	40	And when the sun was setting , all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him ; and he laid his hands on every one of them , and healed them .
ASV	Luke	4	41	And demons also came out from many , crying out , and saying , Thou art the Son of God . And rebuking them , he suffered them not to speak , because they knew that he was the Christ .
ASV	Luke	4	42	And when it was day , he came out and went into a desert place : and the multitudes sought after him , and came unto him , and would have stayed him , that he should not go from them .
ASV	Luke	4	43	But he said unto them , I must preach [ r ] the good tidings of the kingdom of God to the other cities also : for therefore was I sent .
ASV	Luke	4	44	And he was preaching in the synagogues of [ s ] Galilee .

ASV	Luke	5	5	And Simon answered and said , Master , we toiled all night , and took nothing : but at thy word I will let down the nets .
ASV	Luke	5	2	and he saw two boats standing by the lake : but the fishermen had gone out of them , and were washing their nets .
ASV	Luke	5	3	And he entered into one of the boats , which was Simon ’ s , and asked him to put out a little from the land . And he sat down and taught the multitudes out of the boat .
ASV	Luke	5	4	And when he had left speaking , he said unto Simon , Put out into the deep , and let down your nets for a draught .
ASV	Luke	5	6	And when they had done this , they inclosed a great multitude of fishes ; and their nets were breaking ;
ASV	Luke	5	7	and they beckoned unto their partners in the other boat , that they should come and help them . And they came , and filled both the boats , so that they began to sink .
ASV	Luke	5	8	But Simon Peter , when he saw it , fell down at Jesus ’ knees , saying , Depart from me ; for I am a sinful man , O Lord .
ASV	Luke	5	9	For he was amazed , and all that were with him , at the draught of the fishes which they had taken ;
ASV	Luke	5	10	and so were also [ a ] James and John , sons of Zebedee , who were partners with Simon . And Jesus said unto Simon , Fear not ; from henceforth thou shalt [ b ] catch men .
ASV	Luke	5	11	And when they had brought their boats to land , they left all , and followed him .
ASV	Luke	5	12	And it came to pass , while he was in one of the cities , behold , a man full of leprosy : and when he saw Jesus , he fell on his face , and besought him , saying , Lord , if thou wilt , thou canst make me clean .
ASV	Luke	5	13	And he stretched forth his hand , and touched him , saying , I will ; be thou made clean . And straightway the leprosy departed from him .
ASV	Luke	5	14	And he charged him to tell no man : but go thy way , and show thyself to the priest , and offer for thy cleansing , [ c ] according as Moses commanded , for a testimony unto them .
ASV	Luke	5	15	But so much the more went abroad the report concerning him : and great multitudes came together to hear , and to be healed of their infirmities .
ASV	Luke	5	16	But he withdrew himself in the deserts , and prayed .
ASV	Luke	5	17	And it came to pass on one of those days , that he was teaching ; and there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by , who were come out of every village of Galilee and Judaea and Jerusalem : and the power of the Lord was with him [ d ] to heal .
ASV	Luke	5	18	And behold , men bring on a bed a man that was palsied : and they sought to bring him in , and to lay him before him .
ASV	Luke	5	19	And not finding by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude , they went up to the housetop , and let him down through the tiles with his couch into the midst before Jesus .
ASV	Luke	5	20	And seeing their faith , he said , Man , thy sins are forgiven thee .
ASV	Luke	5	21	And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason , saying , Who is this that speaketh blasphemies ? Who can forgive sins , but God alone ?
ASV	Luke	5	22	But Jesus perceiving their [ e ] reasonings , answered and said unto them , [ f ] Why reason ye in your hearts ?
ASV	Luke	5	23	Which is easier , to say , Thy sins are forgiven thee ; or to say , Arise and walk ?
ASV	Luke	5	24	But that ye may know that the Son of man hath authority on earth to forgive sins ( he said unto him that was palsied ) , I say unto thee , Arise , and take up thy couch , and go unto thy house .
ASV	Luke	5	25	And immediately he rose up before them , and took up that whereon he lay , and departed to his house , glorifying God .
ASV	Luke	5	26	And amazement took hold on all , and they glorified God ; and they were filled with fear , saying , We have seen strange things to-day .
ASV	Luke	5	27	And after these things he went forth , and beheld a [ g ] publican , named Levi , sitting at the place of toll , and said unto him , Follow me .
ASV	Luke	5	28	And he forsook all , and rose up and followed him .
ASV	Luke	5	29	And Levi made him a great feast in his house : and there was a great multitude of [ h ] publicans and of others that were sitting at meat with them .
ASV	Luke	5	30	And [ i ] the Pharisees and their scribes murmured against his disciples , saying , Why do ye eat and drink with the [ j ] publicans and sinners ?
ASV	Luke	5	31	And Jesus answering said unto them , They that are [ k ] in health have no need of a physician ; but they that are sick .
ASV	Luke	5	32	I am not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance .
ASV	Luke	5	33	And they said unto him , The disciples of John fast often , and make supplications ; likewise also the disciples of the Pharisees ; but thine eat and drink .
ASV	Luke	5	34	And Jesus said unto them , Can ye make the [ l ] sons of the bride-chamber fast , while the bridegroom is with them ?
ASV	Luke	5	35	But the days will come ; and when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them , then will they fast in those days .
ASV	Luke	5	36	And he spake also a parable unto them : No man rendeth a piece from a new garment and putteth it upon an old garment ; else he will rend the new , and also the piece from the new will not agree with the old .
ASV	Luke	5	37	And no man putteth new wine into old [ m ] wine-skins ; else the new wine will burst the skins , and itself will be spilled , and the skins will perish .
ASV	Luke	5	38	But new wine must be put into fresh wine-skins .
ASV	Luke	5	39	And no man having drunk old wine desireth new ; for he saith , The old is [ n ] good .

ASV	Luke	6	6	And it came to pass on another sabbath , that he entered into the synagogue and taught : and there was a man there , and his right hand was withered .
ASV	Luke	6	2	But certain of the Pharisees said , Why do ye that which it is not lawful to do on the sabbath day ?
ASV	Luke	6	3	And Jesus answering them said , [ b ] Have ye not read even this , what David did , when he was hungry , he , and they that were with him ;
ASV	Luke	6	4	how he entered into the house of God , and took and ate the showbread , and gave also to them that were with him ; which it is not lawful to eat save for the priests alone ?
ASV	Luke	6	5	And he said unto them , The Son of man is lord of the sabbath .
ASV	Luke	6	7	And the scribes and the Pharisees watched him , whether he would heal on the sabbath ; that they might find how to accuse him .
ASV	Luke	6	8	But he knew their thoughts ; and he said to the man that had his hand withered , Rise up , and stand forth in the midst . And he arose and stood forth .
ASV	Luke	6	9	And Jesus said unto them , I ask you , Is it lawful on the sabbath to do good , or to do harm ? to save a life , or to destroy it ?
ASV	Luke	6	10	And he looked round about on them all , and said unto him , Stretch forth thy hand . And he did so : and his hand was restored .
ASV	Luke	6	11	But they were filled with [ c ] madness ; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus .
ASV	Luke	6	12	And it came to pass in these days , that he went out into the mountain to pray ; and he continued all night in prayer to God .
ASV	Luke	6	13	And when it was day , he called his disciples ; and he chose from them twelve , whom also he named apostles :
ASV	Luke	6	14	Simon , whom he also named Peter , and Andrew his brother , and [ d ] James and John , and Philip and Bartholomew ,
ASV	Luke	6	15	and Matthew and Thomas , and [ e ] James the son of Alphaeus , and Simon who was called the Zealot ,
ASV	Luke	6	16	and Judas the [ f ] son of [ g ] James , and Judas Iscariot , who became a traitor ;
ASV	Luke	6	17	and he came down with them , and stood on a level place , and a great multitude of his disciples , and a great number of the people from all Judaea and Jerusalem , and the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon , who came to hear him , and to be healed of their diseases ;
ASV	Luke	6	18	and they that were troubled with unclean spirits were healed .
ASV	Luke	6	19	And all the multitude sought to touch him ; for power came forth from him , and healed them all .
ASV	Luke	6	20	And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples , and said , Blessed are ye poor : for yours is the kingdom of God .
ASV	Luke	6	21	Blessed are ye that hunger now : for ye shall be filled . Blessed are ye that weep now : for ye shall laugh .
ASV	Luke	6	22	Blessed are ye , when men shall hate you , and when they shall separate you from their company , and reproach you , and cast out your name as evil , for the Son of man ’ s sake .
ASV	Luke	6	23	Rejoice in that day , and leap for joy : for behold , your reward is great in heaven ; for in the same manner did their fathers unto the prophets .
ASV	Luke	6	24	But woe unto you that are rich ! for ye have received your consolation .
ASV	Luke	6	25	Woe unto you , ye that are full now ! for ye shall hunger . Woe unto you , ye that laugh now ! for ye shall mourn and weep .
ASV	Luke	6	26	Woe unto you , when all men shall speak well of you ! for in the same manner did their fathers to the false prophets .
ASV	Luke	6	27	But I say unto you that hear , Love your enemies , do good to them that hate you ,
ASV	Luke	6	28	bless them that curse you , pray for them that despitefully use you .
ASV	Luke	6	29	To him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other ; and from him that taketh away thy cloak withhold not thy coat also .
ASV	Luke	6	30	Give to every one that asketh thee ; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again .
ASV	Luke	6	31	And as ye would that men should do to you , do ye also to them likewise .
ASV	Luke	6	32	And if ye love them that love you , what thank have ye ? for even sinners love those that love them .
ASV	Luke	6	33	And if ye do good to them that do good to you , what thank have ye ? for even sinners do the same .
ASV	Luke	6	34	And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive , what thank have ye ? even sinners lend to sinners , to receive again as much .
ASV	Luke	6	35	But love your enemies , and do them good , and lend , [ h ] never despairing ; and your reward shall be great , and ye shall be sons of the Most High : for he is kind toward the unthankful and evil .
ASV	Luke	6	36	Be ye merciful , even as your Father is merciful .
ASV	Luke	6	37	And judge not , and ye shall not be judged : and condemn not , and ye shall not be condemned : release , and ye shall be released :
ASV	Luke	6	38	give , and it shall be given unto you ; good measure , pressed down , shaken together , running over , shall they give into your bosom . For with what measure ye mete it shall be measured to you again .
ASV	Luke	6	39	And he spake also a parable unto them , Can the blind guide the blind ? shall they not both fall into a pit ?
ASV	Luke	6	40	The disciple is not above his teacher : but every one when he is perfected shall be as his teacher .
ASV	Luke	6	41	And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother ’ s eye , but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye ?
ASV	Luke	6	42	Or how canst thou say to thy brother , Brother , let me cast out the mote that is in thine eye , when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye ? Thou hypocrite , cast out first the beam out of thine own eye , and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote that is in thy brother ’ s eye .
ASV	Luke	6	43	For there is no good tree that bringeth forth corrupt fruit ; nor again a corrupt tree that bringeth forth good fruit .
ASV	Luke	6	44	For each tree is known by its own fruit . For of thorns men do not gather figs , nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes .
ASV	Luke	6	45	The good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good ; and the evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth that which is evil : for out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh .
ASV	Luke	6	46	And why call ye me , Lord , Lord , and do not the things which I say ?
ASV	Luke	6	47	Every one that cometh unto me , and heareth my words , and doeth them , I will show you to whom he is like :
ASV	Luke	6	48	he is like a man building a house , who digged and went deep , and laid a foundation upon the rock : and when a flood arose , the stream brake against that house , and could not shake it : [ i ] because it had been well builded .
ASV	Luke	6	49	But he that [ j ] heareth , and [ k ] doeth not , is like a man that built a house upon the earth without a foundation ; against which the stream brake , and straightway it fell in ; and the ruin of that house was great .

ASV	Luke	7	7	wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee : but say [ e ] the word , and my [ f ] servant shall be healed .
ASV	Luke	7	2	And a certain centurion ’ s [ a ] servant , who was [ b ] dear unto him , was sick and at the point of death .
ASV	Luke	7	3	And when he heard concerning Jesus , he sent unto him elders of the Jews , asking him that he would come and save his [ c ] servant .
ASV	Luke	7	4	And they , when they came to Jesus , besought him earnestly , saying , He is worthy that thou shouldest do this for him ;
ASV	Luke	7	5	for he loveth our nation , and himself built us our synagogue .
ASV	Luke	7	6	And Jesus went with them . And when he was now not far from the house , the centurion sent friends to him , saying unto him , Lord , trouble not thyself ; for I am not [ d ] worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof :
ASV	Luke	7	8	For I also am a man set under authority , having under myself soldiers : and I say to this one , Go , and he goeth ; and to another , Come , and he cometh ; and to my [ g ] servant , Do this , and he doeth it .
ASV	Luke	7	9	And when Jesus heard these things , he marvelled at him , and turned and said unto the multitude that followed him , I say unto you , I have not found so great faith , no , not in Israel .
ASV	Luke	7	10	And they that were sent , returning to the house , found the [ h ] servant whole .
ASV	Luke	7	11	And it came to pass [ i ] soon afterwards , that he went to a city called Nain ; and his disciples went with him , and a great multitude .
ASV	Luke	7	12	Now when he drew near to the gate of the city , behold , there was carried out one that was dead , the only son of his mother , and she was a widow : and much people of the city was with her .
ASV	Luke	7	13	And when the Lord saw her , he had compassion on her , and said unto her , Weep not .
ASV	Luke	7	14	And he came nigh and touched the bier : and the bearers stood still . And he said , Young man , I say unto thee , Arise .
ASV	Luke	7	15	And he that was dead sat up , and began to speak . And he gave him to his mother .
ASV	Luke	7	16	And fear took hold on all : and they glorified God , saying , A great prophet is arisen among us : and , God hath visited his people .
ASV	Luke	7	17	And this report went forth concerning him in the whole of Judaea , and all the region round about .
ASV	Luke	7	18	And the disciples of John told him of all these things .
ASV	Luke	7	19	And John calling unto him [ j ] two of his disciples sent them to the Lord , saying , Art thou he that cometh , or look we for another ?
ASV	Luke	7	20	And when the men were come unto him , they said , John the Baptist hath sent us unto thee , saying , Art thou he that cometh , or look we for another ?
ASV	Luke	7	21	In that hour he cured many of diseases and [ k ] plagues and evil spirits ; and on many that were blind he bestowed sight .
ASV	Luke	7	22	And he answered and said unto them , Go and tell John the things which ye have seen and heard ; the blind receive their sight , the lame walk , the lepers are cleansed , and the deaf hear , the dead are raised up , the poor have [ l ] good tidings preached to them .
ASV	Luke	7	23	And blessed is he , whosoever shall find no occasion of stumbling in me .
ASV	Luke	7	24	And when the messengers of John were departed , he began to say unto the multitudes concerning John , What went ye out into the wilderness to behold ? a reed shaken with the wind ?
ASV	Luke	7	25	. - Luke 7:41 The word in the Greek denotes a coin worth about eight pence half-penny , or nearly seventeen cents . - Luke 7:45 Greek kiss much . - Luke 7:49 Greek reclined . - Luke 7:49 Or , among
ASV	Luke	7	26	But what went ye out to see ? a prophet ? Yea , I say unto you , and much more than a prophet .
ASV	Luke	7	27	This is he of whom it is written , [ m ] Behold , I send my messenger before thy face , Who shall prepare thy way before thee .
ASV	Luke	7	28	I say unto you , Among them that are born of women there is none greater than John : yet he that is [ n ] but little in the kingdom of God is greater than he .
ASV	Luke	7	29	And all the people when they heard , and the [ o ] publicans , justified God , [ p ] being baptized with the baptism of John .
ASV	Luke	7	30	But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected for themselves the counsel of God , [ q ] being not baptized of him .
ASV	Luke	7	31	Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation , and to what are they like ?
ASV	Luke	7	32	They are like unto children that sit in the marketplace , and call one to another ; who say , We piped unto you , and ye did not dance ; we wailed , and ye did not weep .
ASV	Luke	7	33	For John the Baptist is come eating no bread nor drinking wine ; and ye say , He hath a demon .
ASV	Luke	7	34	The Son of man is come eating and drinking ; and ye say , Behold , a gluttonous man , and a winebibber , a friend of [ r ] publicans and sinners !
ASV	Luke	7	35	And wisdom [ s ] is justified of all her children .
ASV	Luke	7	36	And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him . And he entered into the Pharisee ’ s house , and [ t ] sat down to meat .
ASV	Luke	7	37	And behold , a woman who was in the city , a sinner ; and when she knew that he was [ u ] sitting at meat in the Pharisee ’ s house , she brought [ v ] an alabaster cruse of ointment ,
ASV	Luke	7	38	and standing behind at his feet , weeping , she began to wet his feet with her tears , and wiped them with the hair of her head , and [ w ] kissed his feet , and anointed them with the ointment .
ASV	Luke	7	39	Now when the Pharisee that had bidden him saw it , he spake within himself , saying , This man , if he were [ x ] a prophet , would have perceived who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him , that she is a sinner .
ASV	Luke	7	40	And Jesus answering said unto him , Simon , I have somewhat to say unto thee . And he saith , Teacher , say on .
ASV	Luke	7	41	A certain lender had two debtors : the one owed five hundred [ y ] shillings , and the other fifty .
ASV	Luke	7	42	When they had not wherewith to pay , he forgave them both . Which of them therefore will love him most ?
ASV	Luke	7	43	Simon answered and said , He , I suppose , to whom he forgave the most . And he said unto him , Thou hast rightly judged .
ASV	Luke	7	44	And turning to the woman , he said unto Simon , Seest thou this woman ? I entered into thy house , thou gavest me no water for my feet : but she hath wetted my feet with her tears , and wiped them with her hair .
ASV	Luke	7	45	Thou gavest me no kiss : but she , since the time I came in , hath not ceased to [ z ] kiss my feet .
ASV	Luke	7	46	My head with oil thou didst not anoint : but she hath anointed my feet with ointment .
ASV	Luke	7	47	Wherefore I say unto thee , Her sins , which are many , are forgiven ; for she loved much : but to whom little is forgiven , the same loveth little .
ASV	Luke	7	48	And he said unto her , Thy sins are forgiven .
ASV	Luke	7	49	And they that [ aa ] sat at meat with him began to say [ ab ] within themselves , Who is this that even forgiveth sins ?
ASV	Luke	7	50	And he said unto the woman , Thy faith hath saved thee ; go in peace . Footnotes - Luke 7:2 Greek bondservant . - Luke 7:2 Or , precious to him .

ASV	Luke	8	8	And other fell into the good ground , and grew , and brought forth fruit a hundredfold . As he said these things , he cried , He that hath ears to hear , let him hear .
ASV	Luke	8	2	and certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities : Mary that was called Magdalene , from whom seven demons had gone out ,
ASV	Luke	8	3	and Joanna the wife of Chuzas Herod ’ s steward , and Susanna , and many others , who ministered unto [ b ] them of their substance .
ASV	Luke	8	4	And when a great multitude came together , and they of every city resorted unto him , he spake by a parable :
ASV	Luke	8	5	The sower went forth to sow his seed : and as he sowed , some fell by the way side ; and it was trodden under foot , and the birds of the heaven devoured it .
ASV	Luke	8	6	And other fell on the rock ; and as soon as it grew , it withered away , because it had no moisture .
ASV	Luke	8	7	And other fell amidst the thorns ; and the thorns grew with it , and choked it .
ASV	Luke	8	9	And his disciples asked him what this parable might be .
ASV	Luke	8	10	And he said , Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God : but to the rest in parables ; that seeing they may not see , and hearing they may not understand .
ASV	Luke	8	11	Now the parable is this : The seed is the word of God .
ASV	Luke	8	12	And those by the way side are they that have heard ; then cometh the devil , and taketh away the word from their heart , that they may not believe and be saved .
ASV	Luke	8	13	And those on the rock are they who , when they have heard , receive the word with joy ; and these have no root , who for a while believe , and in time of temptation fall away .
ASV	Luke	8	14	And that which fell among the thorns , these are they that have heard , and as they go on their way they are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life , and bring no fruit to perfection .
ASV	Luke	8	15	And that in the good ground , these are such as in an honest and good heart , having heard the word , hold it fast , and bring forth fruit with [ c ] patience .
ASV	Luke	8	16	And no man , when he hath lighted a lamp , covereth it with a vessel , or putteth it under a bed ; but putteth it on a stand , that they that enter in may see the light .
ASV	Luke	8	17	For nothing is hid , that shall not be made manifest ; nor anything secret , that shall not be known and come to light .
ASV	Luke	8	18	Take heed therefore how ye hear : for whosoever hath , to him shall be given ; and whosoever hath not , from him shall be taken away even that which he [ d ] thinketh he hath .
ASV	Luke	8	19	And there came to him his mother and brethren , and they could not come at him for the crowd .
ASV	Luke	8	20	And it was told him , Thy mother and thy brethren stand without , desiring to see thee .
ASV	Luke	8	21	But he answered and said unto them , My mother and my brethren are these that hear the word of God , and do it .
ASV	Luke	8	22	Now it came to pass on one of those days , that he entered into a boat , himself and his disciples ; and he said unto them , Let us go over unto the other side of the lake : and they launched forth .
ASV	Luke	8	23	But as they sailed he fell asleep : and there came down a storm of wind on the lake ; and they were filling with water , and were in jeopardy .
ASV	Luke	8	24	And they came to him , and awoke him , saying , Master , master , we perish . And he awoke , and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water : and they ceased , and there was a calm .
ASV	Luke	8	25	And he said unto them , Where is your faith ? And being afraid they marvelled , saying one to another , Who then is this , that he commandeth even the winds and the water , and they obey him ?
ASV	Luke	8	26	And they arrived at the country of the [ e ] Gerasenes , which is over against Galilee .
ASV	Luke	8	27	And when he was come forth upon the land , there met him a certain man out of the city , who had demons ; and for a long time he had worn no clothes , and abode not in any house , but in the tombs .
ASV	Luke	8	28	And when he saw Jesus , he cried out , and fell down before him , and with a loud voice said , What have I to do with thee , Jesus , thou Son of the Most High God ? I beseech thee , torment me not .
ASV	Luke	8	29	For he was commanding the unclean spirit to come out from the man . For [ f ] oftentimes it had seized him : and he was kept under guard , and bound with chains and fetters ; and breaking the bands asunder , he was driven of the demon into the deserts .
ASV	Luke	8	30	And Jesus asked him , What is thy name ? And he said , Legion ; for many demons were entered into him .
ASV	Luke	8	31	And they entreated him that he would not command them to depart into the abyss .
ASV	Luke	8	32	Now there was there a herd of many swine feeding on the mountain : and they entreated him that he would give them leave to enter into them . And he gave them leave .
ASV	Luke	8	33	And the demons came out from the man , and entered into the swine : and the herd rushed down the steep into the lake , and were drowned .
ASV	Luke	8	34	And when they that fed them saw what had come to pass , they fled , and told it in the city and in the country .
ASV	Luke	8	35	And they went out to see what had come to pass ; and they came to Jesus , and found the man , from whom the demons were gone out , sitting , clothed and in his right mind , at the feet of Jesus : and they were afraid .
ASV	Luke	8	36	And they that saw it told them how he that was possessed with demons was [ g ] made whole .
ASV	Luke	8	37	- Luke 8:29 Or , of a long time - Luke 8:36 Or , saved - Luke 8:43 Some ancient authorities omit had spent all her living upon physicians , and . - Luke 8:45 Some ancient authorities omit and they that were with him . - Luke 8:48 Or , saved thee - Luke 8:50 Or , saved
ASV	Luke	8	38	But the man from whom the demons were gone out prayed him that he might be with him : but he sent him away , saying ,
ASV	Luke	8	39	Return to thy house , and declare how great things God hath done for thee . And he went his way , publishing throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done for him .
ASV	Luke	8	40	And as Jesus returned , the multitude welcomed him ; for they were all waiting for him .
ASV	Luke	8	41	And behold , there came a man named Jairus , and he was a ruler of the synagogue : and he fell down at Jesus ’ feet , and besought him to come into his house ;
ASV	Luke	8	42	for he had an only daughter , about twelve years of age , and she was dying . But as he went the multitudes thronged him .
ASV	Luke	8	43	And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years , who [ h ] had spent all her living upon physicians , and could not be healed of any ,
ASV	Luke	8	44	came behind him , and touched the border of his garment : and immediately the issue of her blood stanched .
ASV	Luke	8	45	And Jesus said , Who is it that touched me ? And when all denied , Peter said , [ i ] and they that were with him , Master , the multitudes press thee and crush thee .
ASV	Luke	8	46	But Jesus said , Some one did touch me ; for I perceived that power had gone forth from me .
ASV	Luke	8	47	And when the woman saw that she was not hid , she came trembling , and falling down before him declared in the presence of all the people for what cause she touched him , and how she was healed immediately .
ASV	Luke	8	48	And he said unto her , Daughter , thy faith hath [ j ] made thee whole ; go in peace .
ASV	Luke	8	49	While he yet spake , there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue ’ s house , saying , Thy daughter is dead ; trouble not the Teacher .
ASV	Luke	8	50	But Jesus hearing it , answered him , Fear not : only believe , and she shall be [ k ] made whole .
ASV	Luke	8	51	And when he came to the house , he suffered not any man to enter in with him , save Peter , and John , and James , and the father of the maiden and her mother .
ASV	Luke	8	52	And all were weeping , and bewailing her : but he said , Weep not ; for she is not dead , but sleepeth .
ASV	Luke	8	53	And they laughed him to scorn , knowing that she was dead .
ASV	Luke	8	54	But he , taking her by the hand , called , saying , Maiden , arise .
ASV	Luke	8	55	And her spirit returned , and she rose up immediately : and he commanded that something be given her to eat .
ASV	Luke	8	56	And her parents were amazed : but he charged them to tell no man what had been done .

ASV	Luke	9	9	And Herod said , John I beheaded : but who is this , about whom I hear such things ? And he sought to see him .
ASV	Luke	9	2	Kin . 1:10–12 . - Luke 9:55 Some ancient authorities add and said , Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of . Some , but fewer , add also For the Son of man came not to destroy men ’ s lives but to save them . Compare 19:10 ; Jn . 3:17 ; 12:47 . - Luke 9:58 Greek lodging-places .
ASV	Luke	9	3	And he said unto them , Take nothing for your journey , neither staff , nor wallet , nor bread , nor money ; neither have two coats .
ASV	Luke	9	4	And into whatsoever house ye enter , there abide , and thence depart .
ASV	Luke	9	5	And as many as receive you not , when ye depart from that city , shake off the dust from your feet for a testimony against them .
ASV	Luke	9	6	And they departed , and went throughout the villages , preaching the [ b ] gospel , and healing everywhere .
ASV	Luke	9	7	Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done : and he was much perplexed , because that it was said by some , that John was risen from the dead ;
ASV	Luke	9	8	and by some , that Elijah had appeared ; and by others , that one of the old prophets was risen again .
ASV	Luke	9	10	And the apostles , when they were returned , declared unto him what things they had done . And he took them , and withdrew apart to a city called Bethsaida .
ASV	Luke	9	11	But the multitudes perceiving it followed him : and he welcomed them , and spake to them of the kingdom of God , and them that had need of healing he cured .
ASV	Luke	9	12	And the day began to wear away ; and the twelve came , and said unto him , Send the multitude away , that they may go into the villages and country round about , and lodge , and get provisions : for we are here in a desert place .
ASV	Luke	9	13	But he said unto them , Give ye them to eat . And they said , We have no more than five loaves and two fishes ; except we should go and buy food for all this people .
ASV	Luke	9	14	For they were about five thousand men . And he said unto his disciples , Make them [ c ] sit down in companies , about fifty each .
ASV	Luke	9	15	And they did so , and made them all sit down .
ASV	Luke	9	16	And he took the five loaves and the two fishes , and looking up to heaven , he blessed them , and brake ; and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude .
ASV	Luke	9	17	And they ate , and were all filled : and there was taken up that which remained over to them of broken pieces , twelve baskets .
ASV	Luke	9	18	And it came to pass , as he was praying apart , the disciples were with him : and he asked them , saying , Who do the multitudes say that I am ?
ASV	Luke	9	19	And they answering said , John the Baptist ; but others say , Elijah ; and others , that one of the old prophets is risen again .
ASV	Luke	9	20	And he said unto them , But who say ye that I am ? And Peter answering said , The Christ of God .
ASV	Luke	9	21	But he charged them , and commanded them to tell this to no man ;
ASV	Luke	9	22	saying , The Son of man must suffer many things , and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes , and be killed , and the third day be raised up .
ASV	Luke	9	23	And he said unto all , If any man would come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross daily , and follow me .
ASV	Luke	9	24	For whosoever would save his life shall lose it ; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake , the same shall save it .
ASV	Luke	9	25	For what is a man profited , if he gain the whole world , and lose or forfeit his own self ?
ASV	Luke	9	26	For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words , of him shall the Son of man be ashamed , when he cometh in his own glory , and the glory of the Father , and of the holy angels .
ASV	Luke	9	27	But I tell you of a truth , There are some of them that stand here , who shall in no wise taste of death , till they see the kingdom of God .
ASV	Luke	9	28	And it came to pass about eight days after these sayings , that he took with him Peter and John and James , and went up into the mountain to pray .
ASV	Luke	9	29	And as he was praying , the fashion of his countenance was altered , and his raiment became white and dazzling .
ASV	Luke	9	30	And behold , there talked with him two men , who were Moses and Elijah ;
ASV	Luke	9	31	who appeared in glory , and spake of his [ d ] decease which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem .
ASV	Luke	9	32	Now Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep : but [ e ] when they were fully awake , they saw his glory , and the two men that stood with him .
ASV	Luke	9	33	And it came to pass , as they were parting from him , Peter said unto Jesus , Master , it is good for us to be here : and let us make three [ f ] tabernacles ; one for thee , and one for Moses , and one for Elijah : not knowing what he said .
ASV	Luke	9	34	And while he said these things , there came a cloud , and overshadowed them : and they feared as they entered into the cloud .
ASV	Luke	9	35	And a voice came out of the cloud , saying , This is [ g ] my Son , my chosen : hear ye him .
ASV	Luke	9	36	And when the voice [ h ] came , Jesus was found alone . And they held their peace , and told no man in those days any of the things which they had seen .
ASV	Luke	9	37	And it came to pass , on the next day , when they were come down from the mountain , a great multitude met him .
ASV	Luke	9	38	And behold , a man from the multitude cried , saying , Teacher , I beseech thee to look upon my son ; for he is mine only child :
ASV	Luke	9	39	and behold , a spirit taketh him , and he suddenly crieth out ; and it [ i ] teareth him that he foameth , and it hardly departeth from him , bruising him sorely .
ASV	Luke	9	40	And I besought thy disciples to cast it out ; and they could not .
ASV	Luke	9	41	And Jesus answered and said , O faithless and perverse generation , how long shall I be with you , and bear with you ? bring hither thy son .
ASV	Luke	9	42	And as he was yet a coming , the demon [ j ] dashed him down , and [ k ] tare him grievously . But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit , and healed the boy , and gave him back to his father .
ASV	Luke	9	43	And they were all astonished at the majesty of God . But while all were marvelling at all the things which he did , he said unto his disciples ,
ASV	Luke	9	44	Let these words sink into your ears : for the Son of man shall be [ l ] delivered up into the hands of men .
ASV	Luke	9	45	But they understood not this saying , and it was concealed from them , that they should not perceive it ; and they were afraid to ask him about this saying .
ASV	Luke	9	46	And there arose a [ m ] reasoning among them , which of them was the [ n ] greatest .
ASV	Luke	9	47	But when Jesus saw the [ o ] reasoning of their heart , he took a little child , and set him by his side ,
ASV	Luke	9	48	and said unto them , Whosoever shall receive this little child in my name receiveth me : and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me : for he that is [ p ] least among you all , the same is great .
ASV	Luke	9	49	And John answered and said , Master , we saw one casting out demons in thy name ; and we forbade him , because he followeth not with us .
ASV	Luke	9	50	But Jesus said unto him , Forbid him not : for he that is not against you is for you .
ASV	Luke	9	51	And it came to pass , when the days [ q ] were well-nigh come that he should be received up , he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem ,
ASV	Luke	9	52	and sent messengers before his face : and they went , and entered into a village of the Samaritans , to make ready for him .
ASV	Luke	9	53	And they did not receive him , because his face was as though he were going to Jerusalem .
ASV	Luke	9	54	And when his disciples James and John saw this , they said , Lord , wilt thou that we bid fire to come down from heaven , and consume them [ r ] ?
ASV	Luke	9	55	But he turned , and rebuked them [ s ] .
ASV	Luke	9	56	And they went to another village .
ASV	Luke	9	57	And as they went on the way , a certain man said unto him , I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest .
ASV	Luke	9	58	And Jesus said unto him , The foxes have holes , and the birds of the heaven have [ t ] nests ; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head .
ASV	Luke	9	59	And he said unto another , Follow me . But he said , Lord , suffer me first to go and bury my father .
ASV	Luke	9	60	But he said unto him , Leave the dead to bury their own dead ; but go thou and publish abroad the kingdom of God .
ASV	Luke	9	61	And another also said , I will follow thee , Lord ; but first suffer me to bid farewell to them that are at my house .
ASV	Luke	9	62	But Jesus said unto him , No man , having put his hand to the plow , and looking back , is fit for the kingdom of God .

ASV	Luke	10	10	But into whatsoever city ye shall enter , and they receive you not , go out into the streets thereof and say ,
ASV	Luke	10	2	And he said unto them , The harvest indeed is plenteous , but the laborers are few : pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest , that he send forth laborers into his harvest .
ASV	Luke	10	3	Go your ways ; behold , I send you forth as lambs in the midst of wolves .
ASV	Luke	10	4	Carry no purse , no wallet , no shoes ; and salute no man on the way .
ASV	Luke	10	5	And into whatsoever house ye shall [ b ] enter , first say , Peace be to this house .
ASV	Luke	10	6	And if a son of peace be there , your peace shall rest upon [ c ] him : but if not , it shall turn to you again .
ASV	Luke	10	7	And in that same house remain , eating and drinking such things as they give : for the laborer is worthy of his hire . Go not from house to house .
ASV	Luke	10	8	And into whatsoever city ye enter , and they receive you , eat such things as are set before you :
ASV	Luke	10	9	and heal the sick that are therein , and say unto them , The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you .
ASV	Luke	10	11	Even the dust from your city , that cleaveth to our feet , we wipe off against you : nevertheless know this , that the kingdom of God is come nigh .
ASV	Luke	10	12	I say unto you , It shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom , than for that city .
ASV	Luke	10	13	Woe unto thee , Chorazin ! woe unto thee , Bethsaida ! for if the [ d ] mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon , which were done in you , they would have repented long ago , sitting in sackcloth and ashes .
ASV	Luke	10	14	But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment , than for you .
ASV	Luke	10	15	And thou , Capernaum , shalt thou be exalted unto heaven ? thou shalt be brought down unto Hades .

ASV	Luke	10	18	And he said unto them , I beheld Satan fallen as lightning from heaven .
ASV	Luke	10	19	Behold , I have given you authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions , and over all the power of the enemy : and nothing shall in any wise hurt you .
ASV	Luke	10	20	Nevertheless in this rejoice not , that the spirits are subject unto you ; but rejoice that your names are written in heaven .
ASV	Luke	10	21	In that same hour he rejoiced [ e ] in the Holy Spirit , and said , I [ f ] thank thee , O Father , Lord of heaven and earth , that thou didst hide these things from the wise and understanding , and didst reveal them unto babes : yea , Father ; [ g ] for so it was well-pleasing in thy sight .
ASV	Luke	10	22	All things have been delivered unto me of my Father : and no one knoweth who the Son is , save the Father ; and who the Father is , save the Son , and he to whomsoever the Son willeth to reveal him .
ASV	Luke	10	23	And turning to the disciples , he said privately , Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see :
ASV	Luke	10	24	for I say unto you , that many prophets and kings desired to see the things which ye see , and saw them not ; and to hear the things which ye hear , and heard them not .
ASV	Luke	10	25	And behold , a certain lawyer stood up and made trial of him , saying , Teacher , what shall I do to inherit eternal life ?
ASV	Luke	10	26	And he said unto him , What is written in the law ? how readest thou ?
ASV	Luke	10	27	And he answering said , [ h ] Thou shalt love the Lord thy God [ i ] with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy strength , and with all thy mind ; [ j ] and thy neighbor as thyself .
ASV	Luke	10	28	And he said unto him , Thou hast answered right : this do , and thou shalt live .
ASV	Luke	10	29	But he , desiring to justify himself , said unto Jesus , And who is my neighbor ?
ASV	Luke	10	30	Jesus made answer and said , A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho ; and he fell among robbers , who both stripped him and beat him , and departed , leaving him half dead .
ASV	Luke	10	31	And by chance a certain priest was going down that way : and when he saw him , he passed by on the other side .
ASV	Luke	10	32	And in like manner a Levite also , when he came to the place , and saw him , passed by on the other side .
ASV	Luke	10	33	But a certain Samaritan , as he journeyed , came where he was : and when he saw him , he was moved with compassion ,
ASV	Luke	10	34	and came to him , and bound up his wounds , pouring on them oil and wine ; and he set him on his own beast , and brought him to an inn , and took care of him .
ASV	Luke	10	35	And on the morrow he took out two [ k ] shillings , and gave them to the host , and said , Take care of him ; and whatsoever thou spendest more , I , when I come back again , will repay thee .
ASV	Luke	10	36	Which of these three , thinkest thou , proved neighbor unto him that fell among the robbers ?
ASV	Luke	10	37	And he said , He that showed mercy on him . And Jesus said unto him , Go , and do thou likewise .
ASV	Luke	10	38	Now as they went on their way , he entered into a certain village : and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house .
ASV	Luke	10	39	And she had a sister called Mary , who also sat at the Lord ’ s feet , and heard his word .
ASV	Luke	10	40	But Martha was [ l ] cumbered about much serving ; and she came up to him , and said , Lord , dost thou not care that my sister did leave me to serve alone ? bid her therefore that she help me .
ASV	Luke	10	41	But the Lord answered and said unto her , [ m ] Martha , Martha , thou art anxious and troubled about many things :
ASV	Luke	10	42	[ n ] but one thing is needful : for Mary hath chosen the good part , which shall not be taken away from her . Footnotes - Luke 10:1 Many ancient authorities add and two : and so in verse
ASV	Luke	11	11	And of which of you that is a father shall his son ask [ f ] a loaf , and he give him a stone ? or a fish , and he for a fish give him a serpent ?
ASV	Luke	11	2	And he said unto them , When ye pray , say , [ a ] Father , Hallowed be thy name . Thy kingdom come . [ b ]
ASV	Luke	11	3	Give us day by day [ c ] our daily bread .
ASV	Luke	11	4	And forgive us our sins ; for we ourselves also forgive every one that is indebted to us . And bring us not into temptation [ d ] .
ASV	Luke	11	5	And he said unto them , Which of you shall have a friend , and shall go unto him at midnight , and say to him , Friend , lend me three loaves ;
ASV	Luke	11	6	for a friend of mine is come to me from a journey , and I have nothing to set before him ;
ASV	Luke	11	7	and he from within shall answer and say , Trouble me not : the door is now shut , and my children are with me in bed ; I can not rise and give thee ?
ASV	Luke	11	8	I say unto you , Though he will not rise and give him because he is his friend , yet because of his importunity he will arise and give him [ e ] as many as he needeth .
ASV	Luke	11	9	And I say unto you , Ask , and it shall be given you ; seek , and ye shall find ; knock , and it shall be opened unto you .
ASV	Luke	11	10	For every one that asketh receiveth ; and he that seeketh findeth ; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened .
ASV	Luke	11	12	Or if he shall ask an egg , will he give him a scorpion ?
ASV	Luke	11	13	If ye then , being evil , know how to give good gifts unto your children , how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him ?
ASV	Luke	11	14	And he was casting out a demon that was dumb . And it came to pass , when the demon was gone out , the dumb man spake ; and the multitudes marvelled .
ASV	Luke	11	15	But some of them said , [ g ] By [ h ] Beelzebub the prince of the demons casteth he out demons .
ASV	Luke	11	16	And others , trying him , sought of him a sign from heaven .
ASV	Luke	11	17	But he , knowing their thoughts , said unto them , Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation ; [ i ] and a house divided against a house falleth .
ASV	Luke	11	18	And if Satan also is divided against himself , how shall his kingdom stand ? because ye say that I cast out demons [ j ] by [ k ] Beelzebub .
ASV	Luke	11	19	And if I [ l ] by [ m ] Beelzebub cast out demons , by whom do your sons cast them out ? therefore shall they be your judges .
ASV	Luke	11	20	But if I by the finger of God cast out demons , then is the kingdom of God come upon you .
ASV	Luke	11	21	When the strong man fully armed guardeth his own court , his goods are in peace :
ASV	Luke	11	22	but when a stronger than he shall come upon him , and overcome him , he taketh from him his whole armor wherein he trusted , and divideth his spoils .
ASV	Luke	11	23	He that is not with me is against me ; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth .
ASV	Luke	11	24	The unclean spirit when [ n ] he is gone out of the man , passeth through waterless places , seeking rest , and finding none , he saith , I will turn back unto my house whence I came out .
ASV	Luke	11	25	And when [ o ] he is come , [ p ] he findeth it swept and garnished .
ASV	Luke	11	26	Then goeth [ q ] he , and taketh to him seven other spirits more evil than [ r ] himself ; and they enter in and dwell there : and the last state of that man becometh worse than the first .
ASV	Luke	11	27	And it came to pass , as he said these things , a certain woman out of the multitude lifted up her voice , and said unto him , Blessed is the womb that bare thee , and the breasts which thou didst suck .
ASV	Luke	11	28	But he said , Yea rather , blessed are they that hear the word of God , and keep it .
ASV	Luke	11	29	And when the multitudes were gathering together unto him , he began to say , This generation is an evil generation : it seeketh after a sign ; and there shall no sign be given to it but the sign of Jonah .
ASV	Luke	11	30	For even as Jonah became a sign unto the Ninevites , so shall also the Son of man be to this generation .
ASV	Luke	11	31	The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation , and shall condemn them : for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon ; and behold , [ s ] a greater than Solomon is here .
ASV	Luke	11	32	The men of Nineveh shall stand up in the judgment with this generation , and shall condemn it : for they repented at the preaching of Jonah ; and behold , [ t ] a greater than Jonah is here .
ASV	Luke	11	33	No man , when he hath lighted a lamp , putteth it in a cellar , neither under the bushel , but on the stand , that they which enter in may see the light .
ASV	Luke	11	34	The lamp of thy body is thine eye : when thine eye is single , thy whole body also is full of light ; but when it is evil , thy body also is full of darkness .
ASV	Luke	11	35	Look therefore whether the light that is in thee be not darkness .
ASV	Luke	11	36	If therefore thy whole body be full of light , having no part dark , it shall be wholly full of light , as when the lamp with its bright shining doth give thee light .
ASV	Luke	11	37	Now as he spake , a Pharisee asketh him to [ u ] dine with him : and he went in , and sat down to meat .
ASV	Luke	11	38	And when the Pharisee saw it , he marvelled that he had not first bathed himself before [ v ] dinner .
ASV	Luke	11	39	And the Lord said unto him , Now ye the Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter ; but your inward part is full of extortion and wickedness .
ASV	Luke	11	40	Ye foolish ones , did not he that made the outside make the inside also ?
ASV	Luke	11	41	But give for alms those things which [ w ] are within ; and behold , all things are clean unto you .
ASV	Luke	11	42	But woe unto you Pharisees ! for ye tithe mint and rue and every herb , and pass over justice and the love of God : but these ought ye to have done , and not to leave the other undone .
ASV	Luke	11	43	Woe unto you Pharisees ! for ye love the chief seats in the synagogues , and the salutations in the marketplaces .
ASV	Luke	11	44	Woe unto you ! for ye are as the tombs which appear not , and the men that walk over them know it not .
ASV	Luke	11	45	And one of the lawyers answering saith unto him , Teacher , in saying this thou reproachest us also .
ASV	Luke	11	46	And he said , Woe unto you lawyers also ! for ye load men with burdens grievous to be borne , and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers .
ASV	Luke	11	47	Woe unto you ! for ye build the tombs of the prophets , and your fathers killed them .
ASV	Luke	11	48	So ye are witnesses and consent unto the works of your fathers : for they killed them , and ye build their tombs .
ASV	Luke	11	49	Therefore also said the wisdom of God , I will send unto them prophets and apostles ; and some of them they shall kill and persecute ;
ASV	Luke	11	50	that the blood of all the prophets , which was shed from the foundation of the world , may be required of this generation ;
ASV	Luke	11	51	from the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zachariah , who perished between the altar and the [ x ] sanctuary : yea , I say unto you , it shall be required of this generation .
ASV	Luke	11	52	Woe unto you lawyers ! for ye took away the key of knowledge : ye entered not in yourselves , and them that were entering in ye hindered .
ASV	Luke	11	53	And when he was come out from thence , the scribes and the Pharisees began to [ y ] press upon him vehemently , and to provoke him to speak of [ z ] many things ;
ASV	Luke	11	54	laying wait for him , to catch something out of his mouth . Footnotes - Luke 11:2 Many ancient authorities read Our Father , who art in heaven .

ASV	Luke	12	12	for the Holy Spirit shall teach you in that very hour what ye ought to say .
ASV	Luke	12	2	But there is nothing covered up , that shall not be revealed ; and hid , that shall not be known .
ASV	Luke	12	3	Wherefore whatsoever ye have said in the darkness shall be heard in the light ; and what ye have spoken in the ear in the inner chambers shall be proclaimed upon the housetops .
ASV	Luke	12	4	And I say unto you my friends , Be not afraid of them that kill the body , and after that have no more that they can do .
ASV	Luke	12	5	But I will warn you whom ye shall fear : Fear him , who after he hath killed hath [ c ] power to cast into [ d ] hell ; yea , I say unto you , Fear him .
ASV	Luke	12	6	Are not five sparrows sold for two pence ? and not one of them is forgotten in the sight of God .
ASV	Luke	12	7	But the very hairs of your head are all numbered . Fear not : ye are of more value than many sparrows .
ASV	Luke	12	8	And I say unto you , Every one who shall confess [ e ] me before men , [ f ] him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God :
ASV	Luke	12	9	but he that denieth me in the presence of men shall be denied in the presence of the angels of God .
ASV	Luke	12	10	And every one who shall speak a word against the Son of man , it shall be forgiven him : but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Spirit it shall not be forgiven .
ASV	Luke	12	11	And when they bring you before the synagogues , and the rulers , and the authorities , be not anxious how or what ye shall answer , or what ye shall say :
ASV	Luke	12	13	And one out of the multitude said unto him , Teacher , bid my brother divide the inheritance with me .
ASV	Luke	12	14	But he said unto him , Man , who made me a judge or a divider over you ?
ASV	Luke	12	15	And he said unto them , Take heed , and keep yourselves from all covetousness : [ g ] for a man ’ s life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth .
ASV	Luke	12	16	And he spake a parable unto them , saying , The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully :
ASV	Luke	12	17	and he reasoned within himself , saying , What shall I do , because I have not where to bestow my fruits ?
ASV	Luke	12	18	And he said , This will I do : I will pull down my barns , and build greater ; and there will I bestow all my grain and my goods .
ASV	Luke	12	19	And I will say to my [ h ] soul , [ i ] Soul , thou hast much goods laid up for many years ; take thine ease , eat , drink , be merry .
ASV	Luke	12	20	But God said unto him , Thou foolish one , this night [ j ] is thy [ k ] soul required of thee ; and the things which thou hast prepared , whose shall they be ?
ASV	Luke	12	21	So is he that layeth up treasure for himself , and is not rich toward God .
ASV	Luke	12	22	And he said unto his disciples , Therefore I say unto you , Be not anxious for your [ l ] life , what ye shall eat ; nor yet for your body , what ye shall put on .
ASV	Luke	12	23	For the [ m ] life is more than the food , and the body than the raiment .
ASV	Luke	12	24	Consider the ravens , that they sow not , neither reap ; which have no store-chamber nor barn ; and God feedeth them : of how much more value are ye than the birds !
ASV	Luke	12	25	And which of you by being anxious can add a cubit unto [ n ] the measure of his life ?
ASV	Luke	12	26	If then ye are not able to do even that which is least , why are ye anxious concerning the rest ?
ASV	Luke	12	27	Consider the lilies , how they grow : they toil not , neither do they spin ; yet I say unto you , Even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these .
ASV	Luke	12	28	But if God doth so clothe the grass in the field , which to-day is , and to-morrow is cast into the oven ; how much more shall he clothe you , O ye of little faith ?
ASV	Luke	12	29	And seek not ye what ye shall eat , and what ye shall drink , neither be ye of doubtful mind .
ASV	Luke	12	30	For all these things do the nations of the world seek after : but your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things .
ASV	Luke	12	31	Yet seek ye [ o ] his kingdom , and these things shall be added unto you .
ASV	Luke	12	32	Fear not , little flock ; for it is your Father ’ s good pleasure to give you the kingdom .
ASV	Luke	12	33	Sell that which ye have , and give alms ; make for yourselves purses which wax not old , a treasure in the heavens that faileth not , where no thief draweth near , neither moth destroyeth .
ASV	Luke	12	34	For where your treasure is , there will your heart be also .
ASV	Luke	12	35	Let your loins be girded about , and your lamps burning ;
ASV	Luke	12	36	and be ye yourselves like unto men looking for their lord , when he shall return from the marriage feast ; that , when he cometh and knocketh , they may straightway open unto him .
ASV	Luke	12	37	Blessed are those [ p ] servants , whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching : verily I say unto you , that he shall gird himself , and make them sit down to meat , and shall come and serve them .
ASV	Luke	12	38	And if he shall come in the second watch , and if in the third , and find them so , blessed are those servants .
ASV	Luke	12	39	[ q ] But know this , that if the master of the house had known in what hour the thief was coming , he would have watched , and not have left his house to be [ r ] broken through .
ASV	Luke	12	40	Be ye also ready : for in an hour that ye think not the Son of man cometh .
ASV	Luke	12	41	And Peter said , Lord , speakest thou this parable unto us , or even unto all ?
ASV	Luke	12	42	And the Lord said , Who then is [ s ] the faithful and wise steward , whom his lord shall set over his household , to give them their portion of food in due season ?
ASV	Luke	12	43	Blessed is that [ t ] servant , whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing .
ASV	Luke	12	44	Of a truth I say unto you , that he will set him over all that he hath .
ASV	Luke	12	45	But if that [ u ] servant shall say in his heart , My lord delayeth his coming ; and shall begin to beat the menservants and the maidservants , and to eat and drink , and to be drunken ;
ASV	Luke	12	46	the lord of that [ v ] servant shall come in a day when he expecteth not , and in an hour when he knoweth not , and shall [ w ] cut him asunder , and appoint his portion with the unfaithful .
ASV	Luke	12	47	And that [ x ] servant , who knew his lord ’ s will , and made not ready , nor did according to his will , shall be beaten with many stripes ;
ASV	Luke	12	48	but he that knew not , and did things worthy of stripes , shall be beaten with few stripes . And to whomsoever much is given , of him shall much be required : and to whom they commit much , of him will they ask the more .
ASV	Luke	12	49	I came to cast fire upon the earth ; and [ y ] what do I desire , if it is already kindled ?
ASV	Luke	12	50	But I have a baptism to be baptized with ; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished !
ASV	Luke	12	51	Think ye that I am come to give peace in the earth ? I tell you , Nay ; but rather division :
ASV	Luke	12	52	for there shall be from henceforth five in one house divided , three against two , and two against three .
ASV	Luke	12	53	They shall be divided , father against son , and son against father ; mother against daughter , and daughter against her mother ; mother in law against her daughter in law , and daughter in law against her mother in law .
ASV	Luke	12	54	And he said to the multitudes also , When ye see a cloud rising in the west , straightway ye say , There cometh a shower ; and so it cometh to pass .
ASV	Luke	12	55	And when ye see a south wind blowing , ye say , There will be a [ z ] scorching heat ; and it cometh to pass .
ASV	Luke	12	56	Ye hypocrites , ye know how to [ aa ] interpret the face of the earth and the heaven ; but how is it that ye know not how to [ ab ] interpret this time ?
ASV	Luke	12	57	And why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right ?
ASV	Luke	12	58	For as thou art going with thine adversary before the magistrate , on the way give diligence to be quit of him ; lest haply he drag thee unto the judge , and the judge shall deliver thee to the [ ac ] officer , and the [ ad ] officer shall cast thee into prison .
ASV	Luke	12	59	I say unto thee , Thou shalt by no means come out thence , till thou have paid the very last mite .

ASV	Luke	13	13	And he laid his hands upon her : and immediately she was made straight , and glorified God .
ASV	Luke	13	2	And he answered and said unto them , Think ye that these Galilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans , because they have suffered these things ?
ASV	Luke	13	3	I tell you , Nay : but , except ye repent , ye shall all in like manner perish .
ASV	Luke	13	4	Or those eighteen , upon whom the tower in Siloam fell , and killed them , think ye that they were [ a ] offenders above all the men that dwell in Jerusalem ?
ASV	Luke	13	5	I tell you , Nay : but , except ye repent , ye shall all likewise perish .
ASV	Luke	13	6	And he spake this parable ; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard ; and he came seeking fruit thereon , and found none .
ASV	Luke	13	7	And he said unto the vinedresser , Behold , these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree , and find none : cut it down ; why doth it also cumber the ground ?
ASV	Luke	13	8	And he answering saith unto him , Lord , let it alone this year also , till I shall dig about it , and dung it :
ASV	Luke	13	9	and if it bear fruit thenceforth , well ; but if not , thou shalt cut it down .
ASV	Luke	13	10	And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath day .
ASV	Luke	13	11	And behold , a woman that had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years ; and she was bowed together , and could in no wise lift herself up .
ASV	Luke	13	12	And when Jesus saw her , he called her , and said to her , Woman , thou art loosed from thine infirmity .
ASV	Luke	13	14	And the ruler of the synagogue , being moved with indignation because Jesus had healed on the sabbath , answered and said to the multitude , There are six days in which men ought to work : in them therefore come and be healed , and not on the day of the sabbath .
ASV	Luke	13	15	But the Lord answered him , and said , Ye hypocrites , doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the [ b ] stall , and lead him away to watering ?
ASV	Luke	13	16	And ought not this woman , being a daughter of Abraham , whom Satan had bound , lo , these eighteen years , to have been loosed from this bond on the day of the sabbath ?
ASV	Luke	13	17	And as he said these things , all his adversaries were put to shame : and all the multitude rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him .
ASV	Luke	13	18	He said therefore , Unto what is the kingdom of God like ? and whereunto shall I liken it ?
ASV	Luke	13	19	It is like unto a grain of mustard seed , which a man took , and cast into his own garden ; and it grew , and became a tree ; and the birds of the heaven lodged in the branches thereof .
ASV	Luke	13	20	And again he said , Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God ?
ASV	Luke	13	21	It is like unto leaven , which a woman took and hid in three [ c ] measures of meal , till it was all leavened .
ASV	Luke	13	22	And he went on his way through cities and villages , teaching , and journeying on unto Jerusalem .
ASV	Luke	13	23	And one said unto him , Lord , are they few that are saved ? And he said unto them ,
ASV	Luke	13	24	Strive to enter in by the narrow door : for many , I say unto you , shall seek to enter in , and shall not be [ d ] able .
ASV	Luke	13	25	When once the master of the house is risen up , and hath shut to the door , and ye begin to stand without , and to knock at the door , saying , Lord , open to us ; and he shall answer and say to you , I know you not whence ye are ;
ASV	Luke	13	26	then shall ye begin to say , We did eat and drink in thy presence , and thou didst teach in our streets ;
ASV	Luke	13	27	and he shall say , I tell you , I know not whence ye are ; depart from me , all ye workers of iniquity .
ASV	Luke	13	28	There shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth , when ye shall see Abraham , and Isaac , and Jacob , and all the prophets , in the kingdom of God , and yourselves cast forth without .
ASV	Luke	13	29	And they shall come from the east and west , and from the north and south , and shall [ e ] sit down in the kingdom of God .
ASV	Luke	13	30	And behold , there are last who shall be first , and there are first who shall be last .
ASV	Luke	13	31	In that very hour there came certain Pharisees , saying to him , Get thee out , and go hence : for Herod would fain kill thee .
ASV	Luke	13	32	And he said unto them , Go and say to that fox , Behold , I cast out demons and perform cures to-day and to-morrow , and the third day I [ f ] am perfected .
ASV	Luke	13	33	Nevertheless I must go on my way to-day and to-morrow and the day following : for it can not be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem .
ASV	Luke	13	34	O Jerusalem , Jerusalem , that killeth the prophets , and stoneth them that are sent unto her ! how often would I have gathered thy children together , even as a hen gathereth her own brood under her wings , and ye would not !
ASV	Luke	13	35	Behold , your house is left unto you desolate : and I say unto you , Ye shall not see me , until ye shall say , Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord .

ASV	Luke	14	14	and thou shalt be blessed ; because they have not wherewith to recompense thee : for thou shalt be recompensed in the resurrection of the just .
ASV	Luke	14	2	And behold , there was before him a certain man that had the dropsy .
ASV	Luke	14	3	And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees , saying , Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath , or not ?
ASV	Luke	14	4	But they held their peace . And he took him , and healed him , and let him go .
ASV	Luke	14	5	And he said unto them , Which of you shall have [ a ] an ass or an ox fallen into a well , and will not straightway draw him up on a sabbath day ?
ASV	Luke	14	6	And they could not answer again unto these things .
ASV	Luke	14	7	And he spake a parable unto those that were bidden , when he marked how they chose out the chief seats ; saying unto them ,
ASV	Luke	14	8	When thou art bidden of any man to a marriage feast , [ b ] sit not down in the chief seat ; lest haply a more honorable man than thou be bidden of him ,
ASV	Luke	14	9	and he that bade thee and him shall come and say to thee , Give this man place ; and then thou shalt begin with shame to take the lowest place .
ASV	Luke	14	10	But when thou art bidden , go and sit down in the lowest place ; that when he that hath bidden thee cometh , he may say to thee , Friend , go up higher : then shalt thou have glory in the presence of all that [ c ] sit at meat with thee .
ASV	Luke	14	11	For every one that exalteth himself shall be humbled ; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted .
ASV	Luke	14	12	And he said to him also that had bidden him , When thou makest a dinner or a supper , call not thy friends , nor thy brethren , nor thy kinsmen , nor rich neighbors ; lest haply they also bid thee again , and a recompense be made thee .
ASV	Luke	14	13	But when thou makest a feast , bid the poor , the maimed , the lame , the blind :
ASV	Luke	14	15	And when one of them that [ d ] sat at meat with him heard these things , he said unto him , Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God .
ASV	Luke	14	16	But he said unto him , A certain man made a great supper ; and he bade many :
ASV	Luke	14	17	and he sent forth his [ e ] servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden , Come ; for all things are now ready .
ASV	Luke	14	18	And they all with one consent began to make excuse . The first said unto him , I have bought a field , and I must needs go out and see it ; I pray thee have me excused .
ASV	Luke	14	19	And another said , I have bought five yoke of oxen , and I go to prove them ; I pray thee have me excused .
ASV	Luke	14	20	And another said , I have married a wife , and therefore I can not come .
ASV	Luke	14	21	And the [ f ] servant came , and told his lord these things . Then the master of the house being angry said to his [ g ] servant , Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city , and bring in hither the poor and maimed and blind and lame .
ASV	Luke	14	22	And the [ h ] servant said , Lord , what thou didst command is done , and yet there is room .
ASV	Luke	14	23	And the lord said unto the [ i ] servant , Go out into the highways and hedges , and constrain them to come in , that my house may be filled .
ASV	Luke	14	24	For I say unto you , that none of those men that were bidden shall taste of my supper .
ASV	Luke	14	25	Now there went with him great multitudes : and he turned , and said unto them ,
ASV	Luke	14	26	If any man cometh unto me , and hateth not his own father , and mother , and wife , and children , and brethren , and sisters , yea , and his own life also , he can not be my disciple .
ASV	Luke	14	27	Whosoever doth not bear his own cross , and come after me , can not be my disciple .
ASV	Luke	14	28	For which of you , desiring to build a tower , doth not first sit down and count the cost , whether he have wherewith to complete it ?
ASV	Luke	14	29	Lest haply , when he hath laid a foundation , and is not able to finish , all that behold begin to mock him ,
ASV	Luke	14	30	saying , This man began to build , and was not able to finish .
ASV	Luke	14	31	Or what king , as he goeth to encounter another king in war , will not sit down first and take counsel whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand ?
ASV	Luke	14	32	Or else , while the other is yet a great way off , he sendeth an ambassage , and asketh conditions of peace .
ASV	Luke	14	33	So therefore whosoever he be of you that renounceth not all that he hath , he can not be my disciple .
ASV	Luke	14	34	Salt therefore is good : but if even the salt have lost its savor , wherewith shall it be seasoned ?
ASV	Luke	14	35	It is fit neither for the land nor for the dunghill : men cast it out . He that hath ears to hear , let him hear . Footnotes - Luke 14:5 Many ancient authorities read a son . See 13:15 . - Luke 14:8 Greek recline not . - Luke 14:10 Greek recline . Compare 7:36 ,

ASV	Luke	15	15	And he went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country ; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine .
ASV	Luke	15	2	And both the Pharisees and the scribes murmured , saying , This man receiveth sinners , and eateth with them .
ASV	Luke	15	3	And he spake unto them this parable , saying ,
ASV	Luke	15	4	What man of you , having a hundred sheep , and having lost one of them , doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness , and go after that which is lost , until he find it ?
ASV	Luke	15	5	And when he hath found it , he layeth it on his shoulders , rejoicing .
ASV	Luke	15	6	And when he cometh home , he calleth together his friends and his neighbors , saying unto them , Rejoice with me , for I have found my sheep which was lost .
ASV	Luke	15	7	I say unto you , that even so there shall be joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth , more than over ninety and nine righteous persons , who need no repentance .
ASV	Luke	15	8	Or what woman having ten [ b ] pieces of silver , if she lose one piece , doth not light a lamp , and sweep the house , and seek diligently until she find it ?
ASV	Luke	15	9	And when she hath found it , she calleth together her friends and neighbors , saying , Rejoice with me , for I have found the piece which I had lost .
ASV	Luke	15	10	Even so , I say unto you , there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth .
ASV	Luke	15	11	And he said , A certain man had two sons :
ASV	Luke	15	12	and the younger of them said to his father , Father , give me the portion of [ c ] thy substance that falleth to me . And he divided unto them his living .
ASV	Luke	15	13	And not many days after , the younger son gathered all together and took his journey into a far country ; and there he wasted his substance with riotous living .
ASV	Luke	15	14	And when he had spent all , there arose a mighty famine in that country ; and he began to be in want .
ASV	Luke	15	16	And he would fain [ d ] have filled his belly with [ e ] the husks that the swine did eat : and no man gave unto him .
ASV	Luke	15	17	But when he came to himself he said , How many hired servants of my father ’ s have bread enough and to spare , and I perish here with hunger !
ASV	Luke	15	18	I will arise and go to my father , and will say unto him , Father , I have sinned against heaven , and in thy sight :
ASV	Luke	15	19	. - Luke 15:22 Greek bondservants . - Luke 15:31 Greek Child .
ASV	Luke	15	20	And he arose , and came to his father . But while he was yet afar off , his father saw him , and was moved with compassion , and ran , and fell on his neck , and [ f ] kissed him .
ASV	Luke	15	21	And the son said unto him , Father , I have sinned against heaven , and in thy sight : I am no more worthy to be called thy son [ g ] .
ASV	Luke	15	22	But the father said to his [ h ] servants , Bring forth quickly the best robe , and put it on him ; and put a ring on his hand , and shoes on his feet :
ASV	Luke	15	23	and bring the fatted calf , and kill it , and let us eat , and make merry :
ASV	Luke	15	24	for this my son was dead , and is alive again ; he was lost , and is found . And they began to be merry .
ASV	Luke	15	25	Now his elder son was in the field : and as he came and drew nigh to the house , he heard music and dancing .
ASV	Luke	15	26	And he called to him one of the servants , and inquired what these things might be .
ASV	Luke	15	27	And he said unto him , Thy brother is come ; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf , because he hath received him safe and sound .
ASV	Luke	15	28	But he was angry , and would not go in : and his father came out , and entreated him .
ASV	Luke	15	29	But he answered and said to his father , Lo , these many years do I serve thee , and I never transgressed a commandment of thine ; and yet thou never gavest me a kid , that I might make merry with my friends :
ASV	Luke	15	30	but when this thy son came , who hath devoured thy living with harlots , thou killedst for him the fatted calf .
ASV	Luke	15	31	And he said unto him , [ i ] Son , thou art ever with me , and all that is mine is thine .
ASV	Luke	15	32	But it was meet to make merry and be glad : for this thy brother was dead , and is alive again ; and was lost , and is found .

ASV	Luke	16	16	The law and the prophets were until John : from that time the [ j ] gospel of the kingdom of God is preached , and every man entereth violently into it .
ASV	Luke	16	2	And he called him , and said unto him , What is this that I hear of thee ? render the account of thy stewardship ; for thou canst be no longer steward .
ASV	Luke	16	3	And the steward said within himself , What shall I do , seeing that my lord taketh away the stewardship from me ? I have not strength to dig ; to beg I am ashamed .
ASV	Luke	16	4	I am resolved what to do , that , when I am put out of the stewardship , they may receive me into their houses .
ASV	Luke	16	5	And calling to him each one of his lord ’ s debtors , he said to the first , How much owest thou unto my lord ?
ASV	Luke	16	6	And he said , A hundred [ a ] measures of oil . And he said unto him , Take thy [ b ] bond , and sit down quickly and write fifty .
ASV	Luke	16	7	Then said he to another , And how much owest thou ? And he said , A hundred [ c ] measures of wheat . He saith unto him , Take thy [ d ] bond , and write fourscore .
ASV	Luke	16	8	And his lord commended [ e ] the unrighteous steward because he had done wisely : for the sons of this [ f ] world are for their own generation wiser than the sons of the light .
ASV	Luke	16	9	And I say unto you , Make to yourselves friends [ g ] by means of the mammon of unrighteousness ; that , when it shall fail , they may receive you into the eternal tabernacles .
ASV	Luke	16	10	He that is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much : and he that is unrighteous in a very little is unrighteous also in much .
ASV	Luke	16	11	,
ASV	Luke	16	12	And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another ’ s , who will give you that which is [ h ] your own ?
ASV	Luke	16	13	No [ i ] servant can serve two masters : for either he will hate the one , and love the other ; or else he will hold to one , and despise the other . Ye can not serve God and mammon .

ASV	Luke	16	15	And he said unto them , Ye are they that justify yourselves in the sight of men ; but God knoweth your hearts : for that which is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God .
ASV	Luke	16	17	But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away , than for one tittle of the law to fall .
ASV	Luke	16	18	Every one that putteth away his wife , and marrieth another , committeth adultery : and he that marrieth one that is put away from a husband committeth adultery .
ASV	Luke	16	19	Now there was a certain rich man , and he was clothed in purple and fine linen , [ k ] faring sumptuously every day :
ASV	Luke	16	20	and a certain beggar named Lazarus was laid at his gate , full of sores ,
ASV	Luke	16	21	and desiring to be fed with the crumbs that fell from the rich man ’ s table ; yea , even the dogs came and licked his sores .
ASV	Luke	16	22	And it came to pass , that the beggar died , and that he was carried away by the angels into Abraham ’ s bosom : and the rich man also died , and was buried .
ASV	Luke	16	23	And in Hades he lifted up his eyes , being in torments , and seeth Abraham afar off , and Lazarus in his bosom .
ASV	Luke	16	24	And he cried and said , Father Abraham , have mercy on me , and send Lazarus , that he may dip the tip of his finger in water , and cool my tongue ; for I am in anguish in this flame .
ASV	Luke	16	25	But Abraham said , [ l ] Son , remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things , and Lazarus in like manner evil things : but now here he is comforted , and thou art in anguish .
ASV	Luke	16	26	And [ m ] besides all this , between us and you there is a great gulf fixed , that they that would pass from hence to you may not be able , and that none may cross over from thence to us .
ASV	Luke	16	27	And he said , I pray thee therefore , father , that thou wouldest send him to my father ’ s house ;
ASV	Luke	16	28	for I have five brethren ; that he may testify unto them , lest they also come into this place of torment .
ASV	Luke	16	29	But Abraham saith , They have Moses and the prophets ; let them hear them .
ASV	Luke	16	30	And he said , Nay , father Abraham : but if one go to them from the dead , they will repent .
ASV	Luke	16	31	And he said unto him , If they hear not Moses and the prophets , neither will they be persuaded , if one rise from the dead . Footnotes - Luke 16:6 Greek baths , the bath being a Hebrew measure . See Ezek . 45:10 ,
ASV	Luke	17	17	And Jesus answering said , Were not the ten cleansed ? but where are the nine ?
ASV	Luke	17	2	It were well for him if a millstone were hanged about his neck , and he were thrown into the sea , rather than that he should cause one of these little ones to stumble .
ASV	Luke	17	3	Take heed to yourselves : if thy brother sin , rebuke him ; and if he repent , forgive him .
ASV	Luke	17	4	And if he sin against thee seven times in the day , and seven times turn again to thee , saying , I repent ; thou shalt forgive him .
ASV	Luke	17	5	And the apostles said unto the Lord , Increase our faith .
ASV	Luke	17	6	And the Lord said , If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed , ye would say unto this sycamine tree , Be thou rooted up , and be thou planted in the sea ; and it would obey you .
ASV	Luke	17	7	But who is there of you , having a [ a ] servant plowing or keeping sheep , that will say unto him , when he is come in from the field , Come straightway and sit down to meat ;
ASV	Luke	17	8	and will not rather say unto him , Make ready wherewith I may sup , and gird thyself , and serve me , till I have eaten and drunken ; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink ?
ASV	Luke	17	9	Doth he thank the [ b ] servant because he did the things that were commanded ?
ASV	Luke	17	10	Even so ye also , when ye shall have done all the things that are commanded you , say , We are unprofitable [ c ] servants ; we have done that which it was our duty to do .
ASV	Luke	17	11	And it came to pass , [ d ] as they were on the way to Jerusalem , that he was passing [ e ] along the borders of Samaria and Galilee .
ASV	Luke	17	12	And as he entered into a certain village , there met him ten men that were lepers , who stood afar off :
ASV	Luke	17	13	and they lifted up their voices , saying , Jesus , Master , have mercy on us .
ASV	Luke	17	14	And when he saw them , he said unto them , Go and show yourselves unto the priests . And it came to pass , as they went , they were cleansed .
ASV	Luke	17	15	And one of them , when he saw that he was healed , turned back , with a loud voice glorifying God ;
ASV	Luke	17	16	and he fell upon his face at his feet , giving him thanks : and he was a Samaritan .
ASV	Luke	17	18	[ f ] Were there none found that returned to give glory to God , save this [ g ] stranger ?
ASV	Luke	17	19	And he said unto him , Arise , and go thy way : thy faith hath [ h ] made thee whole .
ASV	Luke	17	20	And being asked by the Pharisees , when the kingdom of God cometh , he answered them and said , The kingdom of God cometh not with observation :
ASV	Luke	17	21	neither shall they say , Lo , here ! or , There ! for lo , the kingdom of God is [ i ] within you .
ASV	Luke	17	22	And he said unto the disciples , The days will come , when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man , and ye shall not see it .
ASV	Luke	17	23	And they shall say to you , Lo , there ! Lo , here ! go not away , nor follow after them :
ASV	Luke	17	24	for as the lightning , when it lighteneth out of the one part under the heaven , shineth unto the other part under heaven ; so shall the Son of man be [ j ] in his day .
ASV	Luke	17	25	But first must he suffer many things and be rejected of this generation .
ASV	Luke	17	26	And as it came to pass in the days of Noah , even so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man .
ASV	Luke	17	27	They ate , they drank , they married , they were given in marriage , until the day that Noah entered into the ark , and the flood came , and destroyed them all .
ASV	Luke	17	28	Likewise even as it came to pass in the days of Lot ; they ate , they drank , they bought , they sold , they planted , they builded ;
ASV	Luke	17	29	but in the day that Lot went out from Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven , and destroyed them all :
ASV	Luke	17	30	after the same manner shall it be in the day that the Son of man is revealed .
ASV	Luke	17	31	In that day , he that shall be on the housetop , and his goods in the house , let him not go down to take them away : and let him that is in the field likewise not return back .
ASV	Luke	17	32	Remember Lot ’ s wife .
ASV	Luke	17	33	Whosoever shall seek to gain his life shall lose it : but whosoever shall lose his life shall [ k ] preserve it .
ASV	Luke	17	34	I say unto you , In that night there shall be two men on one bed ; the one shall be taken , and the other shall be left .
ASV	Luke	17	35	There shall be two women grinding together ; the one shall be taken , and the other shall be left . [ l ]

ASV	Luke	18	9	And he spake also this parable unto certain who trusted in themselves that they were righteous , and set [ g ] all others at nought :
ASV	Luke	18	10	Two men went up into the temple to pray ; the one a Pharisee , and the other a [ h ] publican .
ASV	Luke	18	11	The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself , God , I thank thee , that I am not as the rest of men , extortioners , unjust , adulterers , or even as this [ i ] publican .
ASV	Luke	18	12	I fast twice in the week ; I give tithes of all that I get .
ASV	Luke	18	13	But the [ j ] publican , standing afar off , would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven , but smote his breast , saying , God , [ k ] be thou merciful to me [ l ] a sinner .
ASV	Luke	18	14	I say unto you , This man went down to his house justified rather than the other : for every one that exalteth himself shall be humbled ; but he that humbleth himself shall be exalted .
ASV	Luke	18	15	And they were bringing unto him also their babes , that he should touch them : but when the disciples saw it , they rebuked them .
ASV	Luke	18	16	But Jesus called them unto him , saying , Suffer the little children to come unto me , and forbid them not : for [ m ] to such belongeth the kingdom of God .
ASV	Luke	18	17	Verily I say unto you , Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child , he shall in no wise enter therein .
ASV	Luke	18	19	And Jesus said unto him , Why callest thou me good ? none is good , save one , even God .
ASV	Luke	18	20	Thou knowest the commandments , [ n ] Do not commit adultery , Do not kill , Do not steal , Do not bear false witness , Honor thy father and mother .
ASV	Luke	18	21	And he said , All these things have I observed from my youth up .
ASV	Luke	18	22	And when Jesus heard it , he said unto him , One thing thou lackest yet : sell all that thou hast , and distribute unto the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in heaven : and come , follow me .
ASV	Luke	18	23	But when he heard these things , he became exceeding sorrowful ; for he was very rich .
ASV	Luke	18	24	And Jesus seeing him said , How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God !
ASV	Luke	18	25	For it is easier for a camel to enter in through a needle ’ s eye , than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God .
ASV	Luke	18	26	And they that heard it said , Then who can be saved ?
ASV	Luke	18	27	But he said , The things which are impossible with men are possible with God .
ASV	Luke	18	28	And Peter said , Lo , we have left [ o ] our own , and followed thee .
ASV	Luke	18	29	And he said unto them , Verily I say unto you , There is no man that hath left house , or wife , or brethren , or parents , or children , for the kingdom of God ’ s sake ,
ASV	Luke	18	30	who shall not receive manifold more in this time , and in the [ p ] world to come eternal life .
ASV	Luke	18	31	And he took unto him the twelve , and said unto them , Behold , we go up to Jerusalem , and all the things that are written through the prophets shall be accomplished unto the Son of man .
ASV	Luke	18	32	For he shall be [ q ] delivered up unto the Gentiles , and shall be mocked , and shamefully treated , and spit upon :
ASV	Luke	18	33	and they shall scourge and kill him : and the third day he shall rise again .
ASV	Luke	18	34	And they understood none of these things ; and this saying was hid from them , and they perceived not the things that were said .
ASV	Luke	18	35	And it came to pass , as he drew nigh unto Jericho , a certain blind man sat by the way side begging :
ASV	Luke	18	36	and hearing a multitude going by , he inquired what this meant .
ASV	Luke	18	37	And they told him , that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by .
ASV	Luke	18	38	And he cried , saying , Jesus , thou son of David , have mercy on me .
ASV	Luke	18	39	And they that went before rebuked him , that he should hold his peace : but he cried out the more a great deal , Thou son of David , have mercy on me .
ASV	Luke	18	40	And Jesus stood , and commanded him to be brought unto him : and when he was come near , he asked him ,
ASV	Luke	18	41	What wilt thou that I should do unto thee ? And he said , Lord , that I may receive my sight .
ASV	Luke	18	42	And Jesus said unto him , Receive thy sight : thy faith hath [ r ] made thee whole .
ASV	Luke	18	43	And immediately he received his sight , and followed him , glorifying God : and all the people , when they saw it , gave praise unto God . Footnotes - Luke 18:3 Or , Do me justice of : and so in verses
ASV	Luke	19	19	And he said unto him also , Be thou also over five cities .
ASV	Luke	19	2	And behold , a man called by name Zacchaeus ; and he was a chief publican , and he was rich .
ASV	Luke	19	3	And he sought to see Jesus who he was ; and could not for the crowd , because he was little of stature .
ASV	Luke	19	4	And he ran on before , and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him : for he was to pass that way .
ASV	Luke	19	5	And when Jesus came to the place , he looked up , and said unto him , Zacchaeus , make haste , and come down ; for to-day I must abide at thy house .
ASV	Luke	19	6	And he made haste , and came down , and received him joyfully .
ASV	Luke	19	7	And when they saw it , they all murmured , saying , He is gone in to lodge with a man that is a sinner .
ASV	Luke	19	8	And Zacchaeus stood , and said unto the Lord , Behold , Lord , the half of my goods I give to the poor ; and if I have wrongfully exacted aught of any man , I restore fourfold .
ASV	Luke	19	9	And Jesus said unto him , To-day is salvation come to this house , forasmuch as he also is a son of Abraham .
ASV	Luke	19	10	For the Son of man came to seek and to save that which was lost .
ASV	Luke	19	11	And as they heard these things , he added and spake a parable , because he was nigh to Jerusalem , and because they supposed that the kingdom of God was immediately to appear .
ASV	Luke	19	12	He said therefore , A certain nobleman went into a far country , to receive for himself a kingdom , and to return .
ASV	Luke	19	13	And he called ten [ a ] servants of his , and gave them ten [ b ] pounds , and said unto them , Trade ye herewith till I come .
ASV	Luke	19	14	But his citizens hated him , and sent an ambassage after him , saying , We will not that this man reign over us .
ASV	Luke	19	15	And it came to pass , when he was come back again , having received the kingdom , that he commanded these [ c ] servants , unto whom he had given the money , to be called to him , that he might know what they had gained by trading .
ASV	Luke	19	16	And the first came before him , saying , Lord , thy pound hath made ten pounds more .
ASV	Luke	19	17	And he said unto him , Well done , thou good [ d ] servant : because thou wast found faithful in a very little , have thou authority over ten cities .
ASV	Luke	19	18	And the second came , saying , Thy pound , Lord , hath made five pounds .
ASV	Luke	19	20	And [ e ] another came , saying , Lord , behold , here is thy pound , which I kept laid up in a napkin :
ASV	Luke	19	21	for I feared thee , because thou art an austere man : thou takest up that which thou layedst not down , and reapest that which thou didst not sow .
ASV	Luke	19	22	He saith unto him , Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee , thou wicked [ f ] servant . Thou knewest that I am an austere man , taking up that which I laid not down , and reaping that which I did not sow ;
ASV	Luke	19	23	then wherefore gavest thou not my money into the bank , and [ g ] I at my coming should have required it with interest ?
ASV	Luke	19	24	And he said unto them that stood by , Take away from him the pound , and give it unto him that hath the ten pounds .
ASV	Luke	19	25	And they said unto him , Lord , he hath ten pounds .
ASV	Luke	19	26	I say unto you , that unto every one that hath shall be given ; but from him that hath not , even that which he hath shall be taken away from him .
ASV	Luke	19	27	But these mine enemies , that would not that I should reign over them , bring hither , and slay them before me .
ASV	Luke	19	28	And when he had thus spoken , he went on before , going up to Jerusalem .
ASV	Luke	19	29	And it came to pass , when he drew nigh unto Bethphage and Bethany , at the mount that is called Olivet , he sent two of the disciples ,
ASV	Luke	19	30	saying , Go your way into the village over against you ; in which as ye enter ye shall find a colt tied , whereon no man ever yet sat : loose him , and bring him .
ASV	Luke	19	31	And if any one ask you , Why do ye loose him ? thus shall ye say , The Lord hath need of him .
ASV	Luke	19	32	And they that were sent went away , and found even as he had said unto them .
ASV	Luke	19	33	And as they were loosing the colt , the owners thereof said unto them , Why loose ye the colt ?
ASV	Luke	19	34	And they said , The Lord hath need of him .
ASV	Luke	19	35	And they brought him to Jesus : and they threw their garments upon the colt , and set Jesus thereon .
ASV	Luke	19	36	And as he went , they spread their garments in the way .
ASV	Luke	19	37	And as he was now drawing nigh , even at the descent of the mount of Olives , the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the [ h ] mighty works which they had seen ;
ASV	Luke	19	38	saying , Blessed is the King that cometh in the name of the Lord : peace in heaven , and glory in the highest .
ASV	Luke	19	39	And some of the Pharisees from the multitude said unto him , Teacher , rebuke thy disciples .
ASV	Luke	19	40	And he answered and said , I tell you that , if these shall hold their peace , the stones will cry out .
ASV	Luke	19	41	And when he drew nigh , he saw the city and wept over it ,
ASV	Luke	19	42	saying , [ i ] If thou hadst known in [ j ] this day , even thou , the things which belong unto [ k ] peace ! but now they are hid from thine eyes .
ASV	Luke	19	43	For the days shall come upon thee , when thine enemies shall cast up a [ l ] bank about thee , and compass thee round , and keep thee in on every side ,
ASV	Luke	19	44	and shall dash thee to the ground , and thy children within thee ; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another ; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation .
ASV	Luke	19	45	And he entered into the temple , and began to cast out them that sold ,
ASV	Luke	19	46	saying unto them , It is written , [ m ] And my house shall be a house of prayer : but [ n ] ye have made it a den of robbers .
ASV	Luke	19	47	And he was teaching daily in the temple . But the chief priests and the scribes and the principal men of the people sought to destroy him :
ASV	Luke	19	48	and they could not find what they might do ; for the people all hung upon him , listening .

ASV	Luke	20	20	And they watched him , and sent forth spies , who feigned themselves to be righteous , that they might take hold of his speech , so as to deliver him up to the [ g ] rule and to the authority of the governor .
ASV	Luke	20	2	and they spake , saying unto him , Tell us : By what authority doest thou these things ? or who is he that gave thee this authority ?
ASV	Luke	20	3	And he answered and said unto them , I also will ask you a [ b ] question ; and tell me :
ASV	Luke	20	4	The baptism of John , was it from heaven , or from men ?
ASV	Luke	20	5	And they reasoned with themselves , saying , If we shall say , From heaven ; he will say , Why did ye not believe him ?
ASV	Luke	20	6	But if we shall say , From men ; all the people will stone us : for they are persuaded that John was a prophet .
ASV	Luke	20	7	And they answered , that they knew not whence it was .
ASV	Luke	20	8	And Jesus said unto them , Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things .
ASV	Luke	20	9	And he began to speak unto the people this parable : A man planted a vineyard , and let it out to husbandmen , and went into another country for a long time .
ASV	Luke	20	10	And at the season he sent unto the husbandmen a [ c ] servant , that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard : but the husbandmen beat him , and sent him away empty .
ASV	Luke	20	11	And he sent yet another [ d ] servant : and him also they beat , and handled him shamefully , and sent him away empty .
ASV	Luke	20	12	And he sent yet a third : and him also they wounded , and cast him forth .
ASV	Luke	20	13	And the lord of the vineyard said , What shall I do ? I will send my beloved son ; it may be they will reverence him .
ASV	Luke	20	14	But when the husbandmen saw him , they reasoned one with another , saying , This is the heir ; let us kill him , that the inheritance may be ours .
ASV	Luke	20	15	And they cast him forth out of the vineyard , and killed him . What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do unto them ?
ASV	Luke	20	16	He will come and destroy these husbandmen , and will give the vineyard unto others . And when they heard it , they said , [ e ] God forbid .
ASV	Luke	20	17	But he looked upon them , and said , What then is this that is written , [ f ] The stone which the builders rejected , The same was made the head of the corner ?
ASV	Luke	20	18	Every one that falleth on that stone shall be broken to pieces ; but on whomsoever it shall fall , it will scatter him as dust .
ASV	Luke	20	19	And the scribes and the chief priests sought to lay hands on him in that very hour ; and they feared the people : for they perceived that he spake this parable against them .
ASV	Luke	20	21	And they asked him , saying , Teacher , we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly , and acceptest not the person of any , but of a truth teachest the way of God :
ASV	Luke	20	22	Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar , or not ?
ASV	Luke	20	23	But he perceived their craftiness , and said unto them ,
ASV	Luke	20	24	Show me a [ h ] denarius . Whose image and superscription hath it ? And they said , Caesar ’ s .
ASV	Luke	20	25	And he said unto them , Then render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar ’ s , and unto God the things that are God ’ s .
ASV	Luke	20	26	And they were not able to take hold of the saying before the people : and they marvelled at his answer , and held their peace .
ASV	Luke	20	27	And there came to him certain of the Sadducees , they that say that there is no resurrection ;
ASV	Luke	20	28	and they asked him , saying , Teacher , [ i ] Moses wrote unto us , that if a man ’ s brother die , having a wife , and he be childless , his brother should take the wife , and raise up seed unto his brother .
ASV	Luke	20	29	There were therefore seven brethren : and the first took a wife , and died childless ;
ASV	Luke	20	30	and the second :
ASV	Luke	20	31	and the third took her ; and likewise the seven also left no children , and died .
ASV	Luke	20	32	Afterward the woman also died .
ASV	Luke	20	33	In the resurrection therefore whose wife of them shall she be ? for the seven had her to wife .
ASV	Luke	20	34	And Jesus said unto them , The sons of this [ j ] world marry , and are given in marriage :
ASV	Luke	20	35	but they that are accounted worthy to attain to that [ k ] world , and the resurrection from the dead , neither marry , nor are given in marriage :
ASV	Luke	20	36	for neither can they die any more : for they are equal unto the angels ; and are sons of God , being sons of the resurrection .
ASV	Luke	20	37	But that the dead are raised , even Moses showed , in [ l ] the place concerning the Bush , when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob .
ASV	Luke	20	38	Now he is not the God of the dead , but of the living : for all live unto him .
ASV	Luke	20	39	And certain of the scribes answering said , Teacher , thou hast well said .
ASV	Luke	20	40	For they durst not any more ask him any question .
ASV	Luke	20	41	And he said unto them , How say they that the Christ is David ’ s son ?
ASV	Luke	20	42	For David himself saith in the book of Psalms , [ m ] The Lord said unto my Lord , Sit thou on my right hand ,
ASV	Luke	20	43	Till I make thine enemies the footstool of thy feet .
ASV	Luke	20	44	David therefore calleth him Lord , and how is he his son ?
ASV	Luke	20	45	And in the hearing of all the people he said unto his disciples ,
ASV	Luke	20	46	Beware of the scribes , who desire to walk in long robes , and love salutations in the marketplaces , and chief seats in the synagogues , and chief places at feasts ;
ASV	Luke	20	47	who devour widows ’ houses , and for a pretence make long prayers : these shall receive greater condemnation .

ASV	Luke	21	21	Then let them that are in Judaea flee unto the mountains ; and let them that are in the midst of her depart out ; and let not them that are in the country enter therein .
ASV	Luke	21	2	And he saw a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites .
ASV	Luke	21	3	And he said , Of a truth I say unto you , This poor widow cast in more than they all :
ASV	Luke	21	4	for all these did of their superfluity cast in unto the gifts ; but she of her want did cast in all the living that she had .
ASV	Luke	21	5	And as some spake of the temple , how it was adorned with goodly stones and offerings , he said ,
ASV	Luke	21	6	As for these things which ye behold , the days will come , in which there shall not be left here one stone upon another , that shall not be thrown down .
ASV	Luke	21	7	And they asked him , saying , Teacher , when therefore shall these things be ? and what shall be the sign when these things are about to come to pass ?
ASV	Luke	21	8	And he said , Take heed that ye be not led astray : for many shall come in my name , saying , I am he ; and , The time is at hand : go ye not after them .
ASV	Luke	21	9	And when ye shall hear of wars and tumults , be not terrified : for these things must needs come to pass first ; but the end is not immediately .
ASV	Luke	21	10	Then said he unto them , Nation shall rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom ;
ASV	Luke	21	11	and there shall be great earthquakes , and in divers places famines and pestilences ; and there shall be terrors and great signs from heaven .
ASV	Luke	21	12	But before all these things , they shall lay their hands on you , and shall persecute you , delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons , [ b ] bringing you before kings and governors for my name ’ s sake .
ASV	Luke	21	13	It shall turn out unto you for a testimony .
ASV	Luke	21	14	Settle it therefore in your hearts , not to meditate beforehand how to answer :
ASV	Luke	21	15	for I will give you a mouth and wisdom , which all your adversaries shall not be able to withstand or to gainsay .
ASV	Luke	21	16	But ye shall be [ c ] delivered up even by parents , and brethren , and kinsfolk , and friends ; and some of you [ d ] shall they cause to be put to death .
ASV	Luke	21	17	And ye shall be hated of all men for my name ’ s sake .
ASV	Luke	21	18	And not a hair of your head shall perish .
ASV	Luke	21	19	In your [ e ] patience ye shall win your [ f ] souls .
ASV	Luke	21	20	But when ye see Jerusalem compassed with armies , then know that her desolation is at hand .
ASV	Luke	21	22	For these are days of vengeance , that all things which are written may be fulfilled .
ASV	Luke	21	23	Woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days ! for there shall be great distress upon the [ g ] land , and wrath unto this people .
ASV	Luke	21	24	And they shall fall by the edge of the sword , and shall be led captive into all the nations : and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles , until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled .
ASV	Luke	21	25	And there shall be signs in sun and moon and stars ; and upon the earth distress of nations , in perplexity for the roaring of the sea and the billows ;
ASV	Luke	21	26	men [ h ] fainting for fear , and for expectation of the things which are coming on [ i ] the world : for the powers of the heavens shall be shaken .
ASV	Luke	21	27	And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory .
ASV	Luke	21	28	But when these things begin to come to pass , look up , and lift up your heads ; because your redemption draweth nigh .
ASV	Luke	21	29	And he spake to them a parable : Behold the fig tree , and all the trees :
ASV	Luke	21	30	when they now shoot forth , ye see it and know of your own selves that the summer is now nigh .
ASV	Luke	21	31	Even so ye also , when ye see these things coming to pass , know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh .
ASV	Luke	21	32	Verily I say unto you , This generation shall not pass away , till all things be accomplished .
ASV	Luke	21	33	Heaven and earth shall pass away : but my words shall not pass away .
ASV	Luke	21	34	But take heed to yourselves , lest haply your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting , and drunkenness , and cares of this life , and that day come on you suddenly as a snare :
ASV	Luke	21	35	for so shall it come upon all them that dwell on the face of all the earth .
ASV	Luke	21	36	But watch ye at every season , making supplication , that ye may prevail to escape all these things that shall come to pass , and to stand before the Son of man .
ASV	Luke	21	37	And every day he was teaching in the temple ; and every night he went out , and lodged in the mount that is called Olivet .
ASV	Luke	21	38	And all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple , to hear him .

ASV	Luke	22	13	And they went , and found as he had said unto them : and they made ready the passover .

ASV	Luke	22	15	And he said unto them , With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer :
ASV	Luke	22	16	for I say unto you , I shall not eat it , until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God .
ASV	Luke	22	17	And he received a cup , and when he had given thanks , he said , Take this , and divide it among yourselves :
ASV	Luke	22	18	for I say unto you , I shall not drink from henceforth of the fruit of the vine , until the kingdom of God shall come .
ASV	Luke	22	19	And he took [ d ] bread , and when he had given thanks , he brake it , and gave to them , saying , This is my body [ e ] which is given for you : this do in remembrance of me .
ASV	Luke	22	20	And the cup in like manner after supper , saying , This cup is the new covenant in my blood , even that which is poured out for you .
ASV	Luke	22	21	But behold , the hand of him that [ f ] betrayeth me is with me on the table .
ASV	Luke	22	23	And they began to question among themselves , which of them it was that should do this thing .
ASV	Luke	22	24	And there arose also a contention among them , which of them was accounted to be [ h ] greatest .
ASV	Luke	22	25	And he said unto them , The kings of the Gentiles have lordship over them ; and they that have authority over them are called Benefactors .
ASV	Luke	22	26	But ye shall not be so : but he that is the greater among you , let him become as the younger ; and he that is chief , as he that doth serve .
ASV	Luke	22	27	For which is greater , he that [ i ] sitteth at meat , or he that serveth ? is not he that [ j ] sitteth at meat ? but I am in the midst of you as he that serveth .
ASV	Luke	22	28	But ye are they that have continued with me in my temptations ;
ASV	Luke	22	29	and [ k ] I appoint unto you a kingdom , even as my Father appointed unto me ,
ASV	Luke	22	30	that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom ; and ye shall sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel .
ASV	Luke	22	31	Simon , Simon , behold , Satan [ l ] asked to have you , that he might sift you as wheat :
ASV	Luke	22	32	but I made supplication for thee , that thy faith fail not ; and do thou , when once thou hast turned again , establish thy brethren .
ASV	Luke	22	33	And he said unto him , Lord , with thee I am ready to go both to prison and to death .
ASV	Luke	22	34	And he said , I tell thee , Peter , the cock shall not crow this day , until thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me .
ASV	Luke	22	35	And he said unto them , When I sent you forth without purse , and wallet , and shoes , lacked ye anything ? And they said , Nothing .
ASV	Luke	22	36	And he said unto them , But now , he that hath a purse , let him take it , and likewise a wallet ; [ m ] and he that hath none , let him sell his cloak , and buy a sword .
ASV	Luke	22	37	For I say unto you , that this which is written must be fulfilled in me , [ n ] And he was reckoned with transgressors : for that which concerneth me hath [ o ] fulfilment .
ASV	Luke	22	38	And they said , Lord , behold , here are two swords . And he said unto them , It is enough .
ASV	Luke	22	39	And he came out , and went , as his custom was , unto the mount of Olives ; and the disciples also followed him .
ASV	Luke	22	40	And when he was at the place , he said unto them , Pray that ye enter not into temptation .
ASV	Luke	22	41	And he was parted from them about a stone ’ s cast ; and he kneeled down and prayed ,
ASV	Luke	22	42	saying , Father , if thou be willing , remove this cup from me : nevertheless not my will , but thine , be done .
ASV	Luke	22	43	,
ASV	Luke	22	44	- Luke 22:48 See verse
ASV	Luke	22	45	And when he rose up from his prayer , he came unto the disciples , and found them sleeping for sorrow ,
ASV	Luke	22	46	and said unto them , Why sleep ye ? rise and pray , that ye enter not into temptation .
ASV	Luke	22	47	While he yet spake , behold , a multitude , and he that was called Judas , one of the twelve , went before them ; and he drew near unto Jesus to kiss him .
ASV	Luke	22	48	But Jesus said unto him , Judas , [ q ] betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss ?
ASV	Luke	22	49	And when they that were about him saw what would follow , they said , Lord , shall we smite with the sword ?
ASV	Luke	22	50	And a certain one of them smote the [ r ] servant of the high priest , and struck off his right ear .
ASV	Luke	22	51	But Jesus answered and said , Suffer ye them thus far . And he touched his ear , and healed him .
ASV	Luke	22	52	And Jesus said unto the chief priests , and captains of the temple , and elders , that were come against him , Are ye come out , as against a robber , with swords and staves ?
ASV	Luke	22	53	When I was daily with you in the temple , ye stretched not forth your hands against me : but this is your hour , and the power of darkness .
ASV	Luke	22	54	And they seized him , and led him away , and brought him into the high priest ’ s house . But Peter followed afar off .
ASV	Luke	22	55	And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the court , and had sat down together , Peter sat in the midst of them .
ASV	Luke	22	56	And a certain maid seeing him as he sat in the light of the fire , and looking stedfastly upon him , said , This man also was with him .
ASV	Luke	22	57	But he denied , saying , Woman , I know him not .
ASV	Luke	22	58	And after a little while another saw him , and said , Thou also art one of them . But Peter said , Man , I am not .
ASV	Luke	22	59	And after the space of about one hour another confidently affirmed , saying , Of a truth this man also was with him ; for he is a Galilaean .
ASV	Luke	22	60	But Peter said , Man , I know not what thou sayest . And immediately , while he yet spake , the cock crew .
ASV	Luke	22	61	And the Lord turned , and looked upon Peter . And Peter remembered the word of the Lord , how that he said unto him , Before the cock crow this day thou shalt deny me thrice .
ASV	Luke	22	62	And he went out , and wept bitterly .
ASV	Luke	22	63	And the men that held [ s ] Jesus mocked him , and beat him .
ASV	Luke	22	64	And they blindfolded him , and asked him , saying , Prophesy : who is he that struck thee ?
ASV	Luke	22	65	And many other things spake they against him , reviling him .
ASV	Luke	22	66	And as soon as it was day , the assembly of the elders of the people was gathered together , both chief priests and scribes ; and they led him away into their council , saying ,
ASV	Luke	22	67	If thou art the Christ , tell us . But he said unto them , If I tell you , ye will not believe :
ASV	Luke	22	68	and if I ask you , ye will not answer .
ASV	Luke	22	69	But from henceforth shall the Son of man be seated at the right hand of the power of God .
ASV	Luke	22	70	And they all said , Art thou then the Son of God ? And he said unto them , [ t ] Ye say that I am .
ASV	Luke	22	71	And they said , What further need have we of witness ? for we ourselves have heard from his own mouth .

ASV	Luke	23	23	But they were urgent with loud voices , asking that he might be crucified . And their voices prevailed .
ASV	Luke	23	2	And they began to accuse him , saying , We found this man perverting our nation , and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar , and saying that he himself is Christ a king .
ASV	Luke	23	3	And Pilate asked him , saying , Art thou the King of the Jews ? And he answered him and said , Thou sayest .
ASV	Luke	23	4	And Pilate said unto the chief priests and the multitudes , I find no fault in this man .
ASV	Luke	23	5	But they were the more urgent , saying , He stirreth up the people , teaching throughout all Judaea , and beginning from Galilee even unto this place .
ASV	Luke	23	6	But when Pilate heard it , he asked whether the man were a Galilaean .
ASV	Luke	23	7	And when he knew that he was of Herod ’ s jurisdiction , he sent him unto Herod , who himself also was at Jerusalem in these days .
ASV	Luke	23	8	Now when Herod saw Jesus , he was exceeding glad : for he was of a long time desirous to see him , because he had heard concerning him ; and he hoped to see some [ a ] miracle done by him .
ASV	Luke	23	9	And he questioned him in many words ; but he answered him nothing .
ASV	Luke	23	10	And the chief priests and the scribes stood , vehemently accusing him .
ASV	Luke	23	11	And Herod with his soldiers set him at nought , and mocked him , and arraying him in gorgeous apparel sent him back to Pilate .
ASV	Luke	23	12	And Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day : for before they were at enmity between themselves .
ASV	Luke	23	13	And Pilate called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people ,
ASV	Luke	23	14	and said unto them , Ye brought unto me this man , as one that perverteth the people : and behold , I , having examined him before you , found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him :
ASV	Luke	23	15	no , nor yet Herod : for [ b ] he sent him back unto us ; and behold , nothing worthy of death hath been done by him .
ASV	Luke	23	16	I will therefore chastise him , and release him . [ c ]
ASV	Luke	23	18	But they cried out all together , saying , Away with this man , and release unto us Barabbas : —
ASV	Luke	23	19	. - Luke 23:33 According to the Latin , Calvary , which has the same meaning . - Luke 23:34 Some ancient authorities omit And Jesus said , Father , forgive them ; for they know not what they do . - Luke 23:42 Some ancient authorities read into thy kingdom . - Luke 23:44 Or , earth - Luke 23:45 Greek the sun failing . - Luke 23:45 Or , sanctuary - Luke 23:46 Or , And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice , he said - Luke 23:54 Greek began to dawn .
ASV	Luke	23	20	And Pilate spake unto them again , desiring to release Jesus ;
ASV	Luke	23	21	but they shouted , saying , Crucify , crucify him .
ASV	Luke	23	22	And he said unto them the third time , Why , what evil hath this man done ? I have found no cause of death in him : I will therefore chastise him and release him .
ASV	Luke	23	24	And Pilate gave sentence that what they asked for should be done .
ASV	Luke	23	25	And he released him that for insurrection and murder had been cast into prison , whom they asked for ; but Jesus he delivered up to their will .
ASV	Luke	23	26	And when they led him away , they laid hold upon one Simon of Cyrene , coming from the country , and laid on him the cross , to bear it after Jesus .
ASV	Luke	23	27	And there followed him a great multitude of the people , and of women who bewailed and lamented him .
ASV	Luke	23	28	But Jesus turning unto them said , Daughters of Jerusalem , weep not for me , but weep for yourselves , and for your children .
ASV	Luke	23	29	For behold , the days are coming , in which they shall say , Blessed are the barren , and the wombs that never bare , and the breasts that never gave suck .
ASV	Luke	23	30	Then shall they begin to say to the mountains , Fall on us ; and to the hills , Cover us .
ASV	Luke	23	31	For if they do these things in the green tree , what shall be done in the dry ?
ASV	Luke	23	32	And there were also two others , malefactors , led with him to be put to death .
ASV	Luke	23	33	And when they came unto the place which is called [ d ] The skull , there they crucified him , and the malefactors , one on the right hand and the other on the left .
ASV	Luke	23	34	[ e ] And Jesus said , Father , forgive them ; for they know not what they do . And parting his garments among them , they cast lots .
ASV	Luke	23	35	And the people stood beholding . And the rulers also scoffed at him , saying , He saved others ; let him save himself , if this is the Christ of God , his chosen .
ASV	Luke	23	36	And the soldiers also mocked him , coming to him , offering him vinegar ,
ASV	Luke	23	37	and saying , If thou art the King of the Jews , save thyself .
ASV	Luke	23	38	And there was also a superscription over him , This is the King of the Jews .
ASV	Luke	23	39	And one of the malefactors that were hanged railed on him , saying , Art not thou the Christ ? save thyself and us .
ASV	Luke	23	40	But the other answered , and rebuking him said , Dost thou not even fear God , seeing thou art in the same condemnation ?
ASV	Luke	23	41	And we indeed justly ; for we receive the due reward of our deeds : but this man hath done nothing amiss .
ASV	Luke	23	42	And he said , Jesus , remember me when thou comest [ f ] in thy kingdom .
ASV	Luke	23	43	And he said unto him , Verily I say unto thee , To-day shalt thou be with me in Paradise .
ASV	Luke	23	44	And it was now about the sixth hour , and a darkness came over the whole [ g ] land until the ninth hour ,
ASV	Luke	23	45	[ h ] the sun ’ s light failing : and the veil of the [ i ] temple was rent in the midst .
ASV	Luke	23	46	[ j ] And Jesus , crying with a loud voice , said , Father , into thy hands I commend my spirit : and having said this , he gave up the ghost .
ASV	Luke	23	47	And when the centurion saw what was done , he glorified God , saying , Certainly this was a righteous man .
ASV	Luke	23	48	And all the multitudes that came together to this sight , when they beheld the things that were done , returned smiting their breasts .
ASV	Luke	23	49	And all his acquaintance , and the women that followed with him from Galilee , stood afar off , seeing these things .
ASV	Luke	23	50	And behold , a man named Joseph , who was a councillor , a good and righteous man
ASV	Luke	23	51	( he had not consented to their counsel and deed ) , a man of Arimathaea , a city of the Jews , who was looking for the kingdom of God :
ASV	Luke	23	52	this man went to Pilate , and asked for the body of Jesus .
ASV	Luke	23	53	And he took it down , and wrapped it in a linen cloth , and laid him in a tomb that was hewn in stone , where never man had yet lain .
ASV	Luke	23	54	And it was the day of the Preparation , and the sabbath [ k ] drew on .
ASV	Luke	23	55	And the women , who had come with him out of Galilee , followed after , and beheld the tomb , and how his body was laid .
ASV	Luke	23	56	And they returned , and prepared spices and ointments . And on the sabbath they rested according to the commandment . Footnotes - Luke 23:8 Greek sign . - Luke 23:15 Many ancient authorities read I sent you to him . - Luke 23:16 Many ancient authorities insert verse
ASV	Luke	23	17	Now he must needs release unto them at the feast one prisoner . Compare Mt . 27:15 ; Mk . 15:6 ; Jn . 18:39 . Others add the same words after verse
ASV	Luke	24	24	And certain of them that were with us went to the tomb , and found it even so as the women had said : but him they saw not .
ASV	Luke	24	1	But on the first day of the week , at early dawn , they came unto the tomb , bringing the spices which they had prepared .
ASV	Luke	24	2	And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb .
ASV	Luke	24	3	And they entered in , and found not the body [ a ] of the Lord Jesus .
ASV	Luke	24	4	And it came to pass , while they were perplexed thereabout , behold , two men stood by them in dazzling apparel :
ASV	Luke	24	5	and as they were affrighted and bowed down their faces to the earth , they said unto them , Why seek ye [ b ] the living among the dead ?
ASV	Luke	24	6	[ c ] He is not here , but is risen : remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee ,
ASV	Luke	24	7	saying that the Son of man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men , and be crucified , and the third day rise again .
ASV	Luke	24	8	And they remembered his words ,
ASV	Luke	24	9	and returned [ d ] from the tomb , and told all these things to the eleven , and to all the rest .
ASV	Luke	24	10	Now they were Mary Magdalene , and Joanna , and Mary the mother of James : and the other women with them told these things unto the apostles .
ASV	Luke	24	11	And these words appeared in their sight as idle talk ; and they disbelieved them .

ASV	Luke	24	13	And behold , two of them were going that very day to a village named Emmaus , which was threescore furlongs from Jerusalem .
ASV	Luke	24	14	And they communed with each other of all these things which had happened .
ASV	Luke	24	15	And it came to pass , while they communed and questioned together , that Jesus himself drew near , and went with them .
ASV	Luke	24	16	But their eyes were holden that they should not know him .
ASV	Luke	24	17	And he said unto them , [ g ] What communications are these that ye have one with another , as ye walk ? And they stood still , looking sad .
ASV	Luke	24	18	And one of them , named Cleopas , answering said unto him , [ h ] Dost thou alone sojourn in Jerusalem and not know the things which are come to pass there in these days ?
ASV	Luke	24	19	And he said unto them , What things ? And they said unto him , The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene , who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people :
ASV	Luke	24	20	and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death , and crucified him .
ASV	Luke	24	21	But we hoped that it was he who should redeem Israel . Yea and besides all this , it is now the third day since these things came to pass .
ASV	Luke	24	22	Moreover certain women of our company amazed us , having been early at the tomb ;
ASV	Luke	24	23	and when they found not his body , they came , saying , that they had also seen a vision of angels , who said that he was alive .
ASV	Luke	24	25	And he said unto them , O foolish men , and slow of heart to believe [ i ] in all that the prophets have spoken !
ASV	Luke	24	26	Behooved it not the Christ to suffer these things , and to enter into his glory ?
ASV	Luke	24	27	And beginning from Moses and from all the prophets , he interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself .
ASV	Luke	24	28	And they drew nigh unto the village , whither they were going : and he made as though he would go further .
ASV	Luke	24	29	And they constrained him , saying , Abide with us ; for it is toward evening , and the day is now far spent . And he went in to abide with them .
ASV	Luke	24	30	And it came to pass , when he had sat down with them to meat , he took the [ j ] bread and blessed ; and breaking it he gave to them .
ASV	Luke	24	31	And their eyes were opened , and they knew him ; and he vanished out of their sight .
ASV	Luke	24	32	And they said one to another , Was not our heart burning within us , while he spake to us in the way , while he opened to us the scriptures ?
ASV	Luke	24	33	And they rose up that very hour , and returned to Jerusalem , and found the eleven gathered together , and them that were with them ,
ASV	Luke	24	34	saying , The Lord is risen indeed , and hath appeared to Simon .
ASV	Luke	24	35	And they rehearsed the things that happened in the way , and how he was known of them in the breaking of the bread .
ASV	Luke	24	36	And as they spake these things , he himself stood in the midst of them , [ k ] and saith unto them , Peace be unto you .
ASV	Luke	24	37	But they were terrified and affrighted , and supposed that they beheld a spirit .
ASV	Luke	24	38	And he said unto them , Why are ye troubled ? and wherefore do questionings arise in your heart ?
ASV	Luke	24	39	See my hands and my feet , that it is I myself : handle me , and see ; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones , as ye behold me having .

See marginal note on 4:7 .
ASV	Luke	24	41	And while they still disbelieved for joy , and wondered , he said unto them , Have ye here anything to eat ?
ASV	Luke	24	42	And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish [ m ] .
ASV	Luke	24	43	And he took it , and ate before them .
ASV	Luke	24	44	And he said unto them , These are my words which I spake unto you , while I was yet with you , that all things must needs be fulfilled , which are written in the law of Moses , and the prophets , and the psalms , concerning me .
ASV	Luke	24	45	Then opened he their mind , that they might understand the scriptures ;
ASV	Luke	24	46	and he said unto them , Thus it is written , that the Christ should suffer , and rise again from the dead the third day ;
ASV	Luke	24	47	and that repentance [ n ] and remission of sins should be preached in his name unto all the [ o ] nations , beginning from Jerusalem .
ASV	Luke	24	48	Ye are witnesses of these things .
ASV	Luke	24	49	And behold , I send forth the promise of my Father upon you : but tarry ye in the city , until ye be clothed with power from on high .
ASV	Luke	24	50	And he led them out until they were over against Bethany : and he lifted up his hands , and blessed them .
ASV	Luke	24	51	And it came to pass , while he blessed them , he parted from them , [ p ] and was carried up into heaven .
ASV	Luke	24	52	And they [ q ] worshipped him , and returned to Jerusalem with great joy :

ASV	John	1	1	In the beginning was the Word , and the Word was with God , and the Word was God .
ASV	John	1	2	The same was in the beginning with God .
ASV	John	1	3	All things were made through him ; and without him [ a ] was not anything made that hath been made .
ASV	John	1	4	In him was life ; and the life was the light of men .
ASV	John	1	5	And the light shineth in the darkness ; and the darkness [ b ] apprehended it not .
ASV	John	1	6	There came a man , sent from God , whose name was John .
ASV	John	1	7	The same came for witness , that he might bear witness of the light , that all might believe through him .
ASV	John	1	8	He was not the light , but came that he might bear witness of the light .
ASV	John	1	9	[ c ] There was the true light , even the light which lighteth [ d ] every man , coming into the world .
ASV	John	1	10	He was in the world , and the world was made through him , and the world knew him not .
ASV	John	1	11	He came unto [ e ] his own , and they that were his own received him not .
ASV	John	1	12	But as many as received him , to them gave he the right to become children of God , even to them that believe on his name :
ASV	John	1	13	who were [ f ] born , not of [ g ] blood , nor of the will of the flesh , nor of the will of man , but of God .
ASV	John	1	14	And the Word became flesh , and [ h ] dwelt among us ( and we beheld his glory , glory as of [ i ] the only begotten from the Father ) , full of grace and truth .
ASV	John	1	15	John beareth witness of him , and crieth , saying , [ j ] This was he of whom I said , He that cometh after me is become before me : for he was [ k ] before me .
ASV	John	1	16	For of his fulness we all received , and [ l ] grace for grace .
ASV	John	1	17	For the law was given through Moses ; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ .
ASV	John	1	18	No man hath seen God at any time ; [ m ] the only begotten Son , who is in the bosom of the Father , he hath declared him .
ASV	John	1	19	And this is the witness of John , when the Jews sent unto him from Jerusalem priests and Levites to ask him , Who art thou ?
ASV	John	1	20	And he confessed , and denied not ; and he confessed , I am not the Christ .
ASV	John	1	21	And they asked him , What then ? Art thou Elijah ? And he saith , I am not . Art thou the prophet ? And he answered , No .
ASV	John	1	22	They said therefore unto him , Who art thou ? that we may give an answer to them that sent us . What sayest thou of thyself ?
ASV	John	1	23	He said , I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness , Make straight the way of the Lord , as [ n ] said Isaiah the prophet .
ASV	John	1	24	[ o ] And they had been sent from the Pharisees .
ASV	John	1	25	And they asked him , and said unto him , Why then baptizest thou , if thou art not the Christ , neither Elijah , neither the prophet ?
ASV	John	1	26	John answered them , saying , I baptize [ p ] in water : in the midst of you standeth one whom ye know not ,
ASV	John	1	27	even he that cometh after me , the latchet of whose shoe I am not worthy to unloose .
ASV	John	1	28	These things were done in [ q ] Bethany beyond the Jordan , where John was baptizing .
ASV	John	1	29	On the morrow he seeth Jesus coming unto him , and saith , Behold , the Lamb of God , that [ r ] taketh away the sin of the world !
ASV	John	1	30	This is he of whom I said , After me cometh a man who is become before me : for he was [ s ] before me .
ASV	John	1	31	And I knew him not ; but that he should be made manifest to Israel , for this cause came I baptizing [ t ] in water .
ASV	John	1	32	And John bare witness , saying , I have beheld the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven ; and it abode upon him .
ASV	John	1	33	And I knew him not : but he that sent me to baptize [ u ] in water , he said unto me , Upon whomsoever thou shalt see the Spirit descending , and abiding upon him , the same is he that baptizeth [ v ] in the Holy Spirit .
ASV	John	1	34	And I have seen , and have borne witness that this is the Son of God .
ASV	John	1	35	Again on the morrow John was standing , and two of his disciples ;
ASV	John	1	36	and he looked upon Jesus as he walked , and saith , Behold , the Lamb of God !
ASV	John	1	37	And the two disciples heard him speak , and they followed Jesus .
ASV	John	1	38	And Jesus turned , and beheld them following , and saith unto them , What seek ye ? And they said unto him , Rabbi ( which is to say , being interpreted , Teacher ) , where abidest thou ?
ASV	John	1	39	He saith unto them , Come , and ye shall see . They came therefore and saw where he abode ; and they abode with him that day : it was about the tenth hour .
ASV	John	1	40	One of the two that heard John speak , and followed him , was Andrew , Simon Peter ’ s brother .
ASV	John	1	41	He findeth first his own brother Simon , and saith unto him , We have found the Messiah ( which is , being interpreted , [ w ] Christ ) .
ASV	John	1	42	He brought him unto Jesus . Jesus looked upon him , and said , Thou art Simon the son of [ x ] John : thou shalt be called Cephas ( which is by interpretation , [ y ] Peter ) .
ASV	John	1	43	On the morrow he was minded to go forth into Galilee , and he findeth Philip : and Jesus saith unto him , Follow me .
ASV	John	1	44	Now Philip was from Bethsaida , of the city of Andrew and Peter .
ASV	John	1	45	Philip findeth Nathanael , and saith unto him , We have found him , of whom Moses in the law , and the prophets , wrote , Jesus of Nazareth , the son of Joseph .
ASV	John	1	46	And Nathanael said unto him , Can any good thing come out of Nazareth ? Philip saith unto him , Come and see .
ASV	John	1	47	Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him , and saith of him , Behold , an Israelite indeed , in whom is no guile !
ASV	John	1	48	Nathanael saith unto him , Whence knowest thou me ? Jesus answered and said unto him , Before Philip called thee , when thou wast under the fig tree , I saw thee .
ASV	John	1	49	Nathanael answered him , Rabbi , thou art the Son of God ; thou art King of Israel .
ASV	John	1	50	Jesus answered and said unto him , Because I said unto thee , I saw thee underneath the fig tree , believest thou ? thou shalt see greater things than these .
ASV	John	1	51	And he saith unto him , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Ye shall see the heaven opened , and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man .

ASV	John	2	2	and Jesus also was bidden , and his disciples , to the marriage .
ASV	John	2	3	And when the wine failed , the mother of Jesus saith unto him , They have no wine .
ASV	John	2	4	And Jesus saith unto her , Woman , what have I to do with thee ? mine hour is not yet come .
ASV	John	2	5	His mother saith unto the servants , Whatsoever he saith unto you , do it .
ASV	John	2	6	Now there were six waterpots of stone set there after the Jews ’ manner of purifying , containing two or three firkins apiece .
ASV	John	2	7	Jesus saith unto them , Fill the waterpots with water . And they filled them up to the brim .
ASV	John	2	8	And he saith unto them , Draw out now , and bear unto the [ a ] ruler of the feast . And they bare it .
ASV	John	2	9	And when the ruler of the feast tasted the water [ b ] now become wine , and knew not whence it was ( but the servants that had drawn the water knew ) , the ruler of the feast calleth the bridegroom ,
ASV	John	2	10	and saith unto him , Every man setteth on first the good wine ; and when men have drunk freely , then that which is worse : thou hast kept the good wine until now .
ASV	John	2	11	This beginning of his signs did Jesus in Cana of Galilee , and manifested his glory ; and his disciples believed on him .
ASV	John	2	12	After this he went down to Capernaum , he , and his mother , and his brethren , and his disciples ; and there they abode not many days .
ASV	John	2	13	And the passover of the Jews was at hand , and Jesus went up to Jerusalem .
ASV	John	2	14	And he found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves , and the changers of money sitting :
ASV	John	2	15	and he made a scourge of cords , and cast all out of the temple , both the sheep and the oxen ; and he poured out the changers ’ money , and overthrew their tables ;
ASV	John	2	16	and to them that sold the doves he said , Take these things hence ; make not my Father ’ s house a house of merchandise .
ASV	John	2	17	His disciples remembered that it was written , [ c ] Zeal for thy house shall eat me up .
ASV	John	2	18	The Jews therefore answered and said unto him , What sign showest thou unto us , seeing that thou doest these things ?
ASV	John	2	19	Jesus answered and said unto them , Destroy this [ d ] temple , and in three days I will raise it up .
ASV	John	2	20	The Jews therefore said , Forty and six years was this [ e ] temple in building , and wilt thou raise it up in three days ?
ASV	John	2	21	But he spake of the [ f ] temple of his body .
ASV	John	2	22	When therefore he was raised from the dead , his disciples remembered that he spake this ; and they believed the scripture , and the word which Jesus had said .
ASV	John	2	23	Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover , during the feast , many believed on his name , beholding his signs which he did .
ASV	John	2	24	But Jesus did not trust himself unto them , for that he knew all men ,
ASV	John	2	25	and because he needed not that any one should bear witness concerning [ g ] man ; for he himself knew what was in man .
ASV	John	3	3	Jesus answered and said unto him , Verily , verily , I say unto thee , Except one be born [ a ] anew , he can not see the kingdom of God .
ASV	John	3	2	the same came unto him by night , and said to him , Rabbi , we know that thou art a teacher come from God ; for no one can do these signs that thou doest , except God be with him .
ASV	John	3	4	Nicodemus saith unto him , How can a man be born when he is old ? can he enter a second time into his mother ’ s womb , and be born ?
ASV	John	3	5	Jesus answered , Verily , verily , I say unto thee , Except one be born of water and the Spirit , he can not enter into the kingdom of God .
ASV	John	3	6	That which is born of the flesh is flesh ; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit .
ASV	John	3	7	Marvel not that I said unto thee , Ye must be born [ b ] anew .
ASV	John	3	8	[ c ] The wind bloweth where it will , and thou hearest the voice thereof , but knowest not whence it cometh , and whither it goeth : so is every one that is born of the Spirit .
ASV	John	3	9	Nicodemus answered and said unto him , How can these things be ?
ASV	John	3	10	Jesus answered and said unto him , Art thou the teacher of Israel , and understandest not these things ?
ASV	John	3	11	Verily , verily , I say unto thee , We speak that which we know , and bear witness of that which we have seen ; and ye receive not our witness .
ASV	John	3	12	If I told you earthly things and ye believe not , how shall ye believe if I tell you heavenly things ?
ASV	John	3	13	And no one hath ascended into heaven , but he that descended out of heaven , even the Son of man , [ d ] who is in heaven .
ASV	John	3	14	And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness , even so must the Son of man be lifted up ;
ASV	John	3	15	that whosoever [ e ] believeth may in him have eternal life .
ASV	John	3	16	For God so loved the world , that he gave his only begotten Son , that whosoever believeth on him should not perish , but have eternal life .
ASV	John	3	17	. - John 3:8 Or , The Spirit breatheth - John 3:13 Man ancient authorities omit who is in heaven . - John 3:15 Or , believeth in him may have - John 3:20 Or , practiseth - John 3:20 Or , convicted - John 3:21 Or , because - John 3:23 Greek were many waters . - John 3:31 Some ancient authorities read he that cometh from heaven beareth witness of what he hath seen and heard . - John 3:36 Or , believeth not
ASV	John	3	18	He that believeth on him is not judged : he that believeth not hath been judged already , because he hath not believed on the name of the only begotten Son of God .
ASV	John	3	19	And this is the judgment , that the light is come into the world , and men loved the darkness rather than the light ; for their works were evil .
ASV	John	3	20	For every one that [ f ] doeth evil hateth the light , and cometh not to the light , lest his works should be [ g ] reproved .
ASV	John	3	21	But he that doeth the truth cometh to the light , that his works may be made manifest , [ h ] that they have been wrought in God .
ASV	John	3	22	After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea ; and there he tarried with them , and baptized .
ASV	John	3	23	And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim , because there [ i ] was much water there : and they came , and were baptized .
ASV	John	3	24	For John was not yet cast into prison .
ASV	John	3	25	There arose therefore a questioning on the part of John ’ s disciples with a Jew about purifying .
ASV	John	3	26	And they came unto John , and said to him , Rabbi , he that was with thee beyond the Jordan , to whom thou hast borne witness , behold , the same baptizeth , and all men come to him .
ASV	John	3	27	John answered and said , A man can receive nothing , except it have been given him from heaven .
ASV	John	3	28	Ye yourselves bear me witness , that I said , I am not the Christ , but , that I am sent before him .
ASV	John	3	29	He that hath the bride is the bridegroom : but the friend of the bridegroom , that standeth and heareth him , rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom ’ s voice : this my joy therefore is made full .
ASV	John	3	30	He must increase , but I must decrease .
ASV	John	3	31	; 19:11 ; Jas . 1:17 ; 3:15 ,
ASV	John	3	32	What he hath seen and heard , of that he beareth witness ; and no man receiveth his witness .
ASV	John	3	33	He that hath received his witness hath set his seal to this , that God is true .
ASV	John	3	34	For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God : for he giveth not the Spirit by measure .
ASV	John	3	35	The Father loveth the Son , and hath given all things into his hand .
ASV	John	3	36	He that believeth on the Son hath eternal life ; but he that [ k ] obeyeth not the Son shall not see life , but the wrath of God abideth on him . Footnotes - John 3:3 Or , from above . See verse
ASV	John	4	4	And he must needs pass through Samaria .
ASV	John	4	2	( although Jesus himself baptized not , but his disciples ) ,
ASV	John	4	3	he left Judaea , and departed again into Galilee .
ASV	John	4	5	So he cometh to a city of Samaria , called Sychar , near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph :
ASV	John	4	6	and Jacob ’ s [ a ] well was there . Jesus therefore , being wearied with his journey , sat [ b ] thus by the [ c ] well . It was about the sixth hour .
ASV	John	4	7	There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water : Jesus saith unto her , Give me to drink .
ASV	John	4	8	For his disciples were gone away into the city to buy food .
ASV	John	4	9	The Samaritan woman therefore saith unto him , How is it that thou , being a Jew , askest drink of me , who am a Samaritan woman ? [ d ] ( For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans . )
ASV	John	4	10	Jesus answered and said unto her , If thou knewest the gift of God , and who it is that saith to thee , Give me to drink ; thou wouldest have asked of him , and he would have given thee living water .

ASV	John	4	13	Jesus answered and said unto her , Every one that drinketh of this water shall thirst again :
ASV	John	4	14	; but not in verses
ASV	John	4	15	The woman saith unto him , [ f ] Sir , give me this water , that I thirst not , neither come all the way hither to draw .
ASV	John	4	16	Jesus saith unto her , Go , call thy husband , and come hither .
ASV	John	4	17	The woman answered and said unto him , I have no husband . Jesus saith unto her , Thou saidst well , I have no husband :
ASV	John	4	18	for thou hast had five husbands ; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband : this hast thou said truly .
ASV	John	4	19	The woman saith unto him , Sir , I perceive that thou art a prophet .
ASV	John	4	20	Our fathers worshipped in this mountain ; and ye say , that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship .
ASV	John	4	21	Jesus saith unto her , Woman , believe me , the hour cometh , when neither in this mountain , nor in Jerusalem , shall ye worship the Father .
ASV	John	4	22	Ye worship that which ye know not : we worship that which we know ; for salvation is from the Jews .
ASV	John	4	23	But the hour cometh , and now is , when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth : [ g ] for such doth the Father seek to be his worshippers .
ASV	John	4	24	[ h ] God is a Spirit : and they that worship him must worship in spirit and truth .
ASV	John	4	25	The woman saith unto him , I know that Messiah cometh ( he that is called Christ ) : when he is come , he will declare unto us all things .
ASV	John	4	26	Jesus saith unto her , I that speak unto thee am he .
ASV	John	4	27	And upon this came his disciples ; and they marvelled that he was speaking with a woman ; yet no man said , What seekest thou ? or , Why speakest thou with her ?
ASV	John	4	28	So the woman left her waterpot , and went away into the city , and saith to the people ,
ASV	John	4	29	Come , see a man , who told me all things that ever I did : can this be the Christ ?
ASV	John	4	30	They went out of the city , and were coming to him .
ASV	John	4	31	In the mean while the disciples prayed him , saying , Rabbi , eat .
ASV	John	4	32	But he said unto them , I have meat to eat that ye know not .
ASV	John	4	33	The disciples therefore said one to another , Hath any man brought him aught to eat ?
ASV	John	4	34	Jesus saith unto them , My meat is to do the will of him that sent me , and to accomplish his work .
ASV	John	4	35	Say not ye , There are yet four months , and then cometh the harvest ? behold , I say unto you , Lift up your eyes , and look on the fields , that they are [ i ] white already unto harvest .
ASV	John	4	36	He that reapeth receiveth wages , and gathereth fruit unto life eternal ; that he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together .
ASV	John	4	37	For herein is the saying true , One soweth , and another reapeth .
ASV	John	4	38	I sent you to reap that whereon ye have not labored : others have labored , and ye are entered into their labor .
ASV	John	4	39	And from that city many of the Samaritans believed on him because of the word of the woman , who testified , He told me all things that ever I did .
ASV	John	4	40	So when the Samaritans came unto him , they besought him to abide with them : and he abode there two days .
ASV	John	4	41	And many more believed because of his word ;
ASV	John	4	42	and they said to the woman , Now we believe , not because of thy speaking : for we have heard for ourselves , and know that this is indeed the Saviour of the world .
ASV	John	4	43	And after the two days he went forth from thence into Galilee .
ASV	John	4	44	For Jesus himself testified , that a prophet hath no honor in his own country .
ASV	John	4	45	So when he came into Galilee , the Galilaeans received him , having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast : for they also went unto the feast .
ASV	John	4	46	He came therefore again unto Cana of Galilee , where he made the water wine . And there was a certain [ j ] nobleman , whose son was sick at Capernaum .
ASV	John	4	47	When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee , he went unto him , and besought him that he would come down , and heal his son ; for he was at the point of death .
ASV	John	4	48	Jesus therefore said unto him , Except ye see signs and wonders , ye will in no wise believe .
ASV	John	4	49	The [ k ] nobleman saith unto him , [ l ] Sir , come down ere my child die .
ASV	John	4	50	Jesus saith unto him , Go thy way ; thy son liveth . The man believed the word that Jesus spake unto him , and he went his way .
ASV	John	4	51	And as he was now going down , his [ m ] servants met him , saying , that his son lived .
ASV	John	4	52	So he inquired of them the hour when he began to amend . They said therefore unto him , Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him .
ASV	John	4	53	So the father knew that it was at that hour in which Jesus said unto him , Thy son liveth : and himself believed , and his whole house .
ASV	John	4	54	This is again the second sign that Jesus did , having come out of Judaea into Galilee . Footnotes - John 4:6 Greek spring : and so in verse
ASV	John	5	5	And a certain man was there , who had been thirty and eight years in his infirmity .
ASV	John	5	2	Now there is in Jerusalem by the sheep gate a pool , which is called in Hebrew [ b ] Bethesda , having five porches .
ASV	John	5	3	In these lay a multitude of them that were sick , blind , halt , withered [ c ] .
ASV	John	5	6	When Jesus saw him lying , and knew that he had been now a long time in that case , he saith unto him , Wouldest thou be made whole ?
ASV	John	5	7	The sick man answered him , [ d ] Sir , I have no man , when the water is troubled , to put me into the pool : but while I am coming , another steppeth down before me .
ASV	John	5	8	Jesus saith unto him , Arise , take up thy [ e ] bed , and walk .
ASV	John	5	9	And straightway the man was made whole , and took up his [ f ] bed and walked . Now it was the sabbath on that day .
ASV	John	5	10	So the Jews said unto him that was cured , It is the sabbath , and it is not lawful for thee to take up thy [ g ] bed .
ASV	John	5	11	But he answered them , He that made me whole , the same said unto me , Take up thy [ h ] bed , and walk .
ASV	John	5	12	They asked him , Who is the man that said unto thee , Take up thy [ i ] bed , and walk ?
ASV	John	5	13	But he that was healed knew not who it was ; for Jesus had conveyed himself away , a multitude being in the place .
ASV	John	5	14	Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple , and said unto him , Behold , thou art made whole : sin no more , lest a worse thing befall thee .
ASV	John	5	15	The man went away , and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him whole .
ASV	John	5	16	And for this cause the Jews persecuted Jesus , because he did these things on the sabbath .
ASV	John	5	17	But Jesus answered them , My Father worketh even until now , and I work .
ASV	John	5	18	For this cause therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him , because he not only brake the sabbath , but also called God his own Father , making himself equal with God .
ASV	John	5	19	Jesus therefore answered and said unto them , Verily , verily , I say unto you , The Son can do nothing of himself , but what he seeth the Father doing : for what things soever he doeth , these the Son also doeth in like manner .
ASV	John	5	20	For the Father loveth the Son , and showeth him all things that himself doeth : and greater works than these will he show him , that ye may marvel .
ASV	John	5	21	For as the Father raiseth the dead and giveth them life , even so the Son also giveth life to whom he will .
ASV	John	5	22	For neither doth the Father judge any man , but he hath given all judgment unto the Son ;
ASV	John	5	23	that all may honor the Son , even as they honor the Father . He that honoreth not the Son honoreth not the Father that sent him .
ASV	John	5	24	Verily , verily , I say unto you , He that heareth my word , and believeth him that sent me , hath eternal life , and cometh not into judgment , but hath passed out of death into life .
ASV	John	5	25	Verily , verily , I say unto you , The hour cometh , and now is , when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God ; and they that [ j ] hear shall live .
ASV	John	5	26	For as the Father hath life in himself , even so gave he to the Son also to have life in himself :
ASV	John	5	27	and he gave him authority to execute judgment , because he is a son of man .
ASV	John	5	28	Marvel not at this : for the hour cometh , in which all that are in the tombs shall hear his voice ,
ASV	John	5	29	and shall come forth ; they that have done good , unto the resurrection of life ; and they that have [ k ] done evil , unto the resurrection of judgment .
ASV	John	5	30	I can of myself do nothing : as I hear , I judge : and my judgment is righteous ; because I seek not mine own will , but the will of him that sent me .
ASV	John	5	31	If I bear witness of myself , my witness is not true .
ASV	John	5	32	It is another that beareth witness of me ; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true .
ASV	John	5	33	Ye have sent unto John , and he hath borne witness unto the truth .
ASV	John	5	34	But the witness which I receive is not from man : howbeit I say these things , that ye may be saved .
ASV	John	5	35	He was the lamp that burneth and shineth ; and ye were willing to rejoice for a season in his light .
ASV	John	5	36	But the witness which I have is greater than that of John ; for the works which the Father hath given me to accomplish , the very works that I do , bear witness of me , that the Father hath sent me .
ASV	John	5	37	And the Father that sent me , he hath borne witness of me . Ye have neither heard his voice at any time , nor seen his form .
ASV	John	5	38	And ye have not his word abiding in you : for whom he sent , him ye believe not .
ASV	John	5	39	[ l ] Ye search the scriptures , because ye think that in them ye have eternal life ; and these are they which bear witness of me ;
ASV	John	5	40	and ye will not come to me , that ye may have life .
ASV	John	5	41	I receive not glory from men .
ASV	John	5	42	But I know you , that ye have not the love of God in yourselves .
ASV	John	5	43	I am come in my Father ’ s name , and ye receive me not : if another shall come in his own name , him ye will receive .
ASV	John	5	44	How can ye believe , who receive glory one of another , and the glory that cometh from [ m ] the only God ye seek not ?
ASV	John	5	45	Think not that I will accuse you to the Father : there is one that accuseth you , even Moses , on whom ye have set your hope .
ASV	John	5	46	For if ye believed Moses , ye would believe me ; for he wrote of me .
ASV	John	5	47	But if ye believe not his writings , how shall ye believe my words ?

ASV	John	6	6	And this he said to prove him : for he himself knew what he would do .
ASV	John	6	2	And a great multitude followed him , because they beheld the signs which he did on them that were sick .
ASV	John	6	3	And Jesus went up into the mountain , and there he sat with his disciples .
ASV	John	6	4	Now the passover , the feast of the Jews , was at hand .
ASV	John	6	5	Jesus therefore lifting up his eyes , and seeing that a great multitude cometh unto him , saith unto Philip , Whence are we to buy [ a ] bread , that these may eat ?
ASV	John	6	7	Philip answered him , Two hundred [ b ] shillings ’ worth of [ c ] bread is not sufficient for them , that every one may take a little .
ASV	John	6	8	One of his disciples , Andrew , Simon Peter ’ s brother , saith unto him ,
ASV	John	6	9	There is a lad here , who hath five barley loaves , and two fishes : but what are these among so many ?
ASV	John	6	10	Jesus said , Make the people sit down . Now there was much grass in the place . So the men sat down , in number about five thousand .
ASV	John	6	11	Jesus therefore took the loaves ; and having given thanks , he distributed to them that were set down ; likewise also of the fishes as much as they would .
ASV	John	6	12	And when they were filled , he saith unto his disciples , Gather up the broken pieces which remain over , that nothing be lost .
ASV	John	6	13	So they gathered them up , and filled twelve baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves , which remained over unto them that had eaten .
ASV	John	6	14	When therefore the people saw the [ d ] sign which he did , they said , This is of a truth the prophet that cometh into the world .

ASV	John	6	16	And when evening came , his disciples went down unto the sea ;
ASV	John	6	17	and they entered into a boat , and were going over the sea unto Capernaum . And it was now dark , and Jesus had not yet come to them .
ASV	John	6	18	And the sea was rising by reason of a great wind that blew .
ASV	John	6	19	When therefore they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs , they behold Jesus walking on the sea , and drawing nigh unto the boat : and they were afraid .
ASV	John	6	20	But he saith unto them , It is I ; be not afraid .
ASV	John	6	21	They were willing therefore to receive him into the boat : and straightway the boat was at the land whither they were going .
ASV	John	6	22	On the morrow the multitude that stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other [ e ] boat there , save one , and that Jesus entered not with his disciples into the boat , but that his disciples went away alone
ASV	John	6	23	( howbeit there came [ f ] boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks ) :
ASV	John	6	24	when the multitude therefore saw that Jesus was not there , neither his disciples , they themselves got into the [ g ] boats , and came to Capernaum , seeking Jesus .
ASV	John	6	25	And when they found him on the other side of the sea , they said unto him , Rabbi , when camest thou hither ?
ASV	John	6	26	Jesus answered them and said , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Ye seek me , not because ye saw signs , but because ye ate of the loaves , and were filled .
ASV	John	6	27	Work not for the food which perisheth , but for the food which abideth unto eternal life , which the Son of man shall give unto you : for him the Father , even God , hath sealed .
ASV	John	6	28	They said therefore unto him , What must we do , that we may work the works of God ?
ASV	John	6	29	Jesus answered and said unto them , This is the work of God , that ye believe on him whom [ h ] he hath sent .
ASV	John	6	30	They said therefore unto him , What then doest thou for a sign , that we may see , and believe thee ? what workest thou ?
ASV	John	6	31	Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness ; as it is written , He [ i ] gave them bread out of heaven to eat .
ASV	John	6	32	Jesus therefore said unto them , Verily , verily , I say unto you , It was not Moses that gave you the bread out of heaven ; but my Father giveth you the true bread out of heaven .
ASV	John	6	33	For the bread of God is that which cometh down out of heaven , and giveth life unto the world .
ASV	John	6	34	They said therefore unto him , Lord , evermore give us this bread .
ASV	John	6	35	Jesus said unto them , I am the bread of life : he that cometh to me shall not hunger , and he that believeth on me shall never thirst .
ASV	John	6	36	But I said unto you , that ye have seen me , and yet believe not .
ASV	John	6	37	All that which the Father giveth me shall come unto me ; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out .
ASV	John	6	38	For I am come down from heaven , not to do mine own will , but the will of him that sent me .
ASV	John	6	39	And this is the will of him that sent me , that of all that which he hath given me I should lose nothing , but should raise it up at the last day .
ASV	John	6	40	For this is the will of my Father , that every one that beholdeth the Son , and believeth on him , should have eternal life ; and [ j ] I will raise him up at the last day .
ASV	John	6	41	The Jews therefore murmured concerning him , because he said , I am the bread which came down out of heaven .
ASV	John	6	42	And they said , Is not this Jesus , the son of Joseph , whose father and mother we know ? how doth he now say , I am come down out of heaven ?
ASV	John	6	43	Jesus answered and said unto them , Murmur not among yourselves .
ASV	John	6	44	No man can come to me , except the Father that sent me draw him : and I will raise him up in the last day .
ASV	John	6	45	It is written in the prophets , [ k ] And they shall all be taught of God . Every one that hath heard from the Father , and hath learned , cometh unto me .
ASV	John	6	46	Not that any man hath seen the Father , save he that is from God , he hath seen the Father .
ASV	John	6	47	Verily , verily , I say unto you , He that believeth hath eternal life .
ASV	John	6	48	I am the bread of life .
ASV	John	6	49	Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness , and they died .
ASV	John	6	50	This is the bread which cometh down out of heaven , that a man may eat thereof , and not die .
ASV	John	6	51	I am the living bread which came down out of heaven : if any man eat of this bread , he shall live for ever : yea and the bread which I will give is my flesh , for the life of the world .
ASV	John	6	52	The Jews therefore strove one with another , saying , How can this man give us his flesh to eat ?
ASV	John	6	53	Jesus therefore said unto them , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood , ye have not life in yourselves .
ASV	John	6	54	He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life ; and I will raise him up at the last day .
ASV	John	6	55	For my flesh is [ l ] meat indeed , and my blood is [ m ] drink indeed .
ASV	John	6	56	He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood abideth in me , and I in him .
ASV	John	6	57	As the living Father sent me , and I live because of the Father ; so he that eateth me , he also shall live because of me .
ASV	John	6	58	This is the bread which came down out of heaven : not as the fathers ate , and died ; he that eateth this bread shall live for ever .
ASV	John	6	59	These things said he in [ n ] the synagogue , as he taught in Capernaum .
ASV	John	6	60	Many therefore of his disciples , when they heard this , said , This is a hard saying ; who can hear [ o ] it ?
ASV	John	6	61	But Jesus knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at this , said unto them , Doth this cause you to stumble ?
ASV	John	6	62	What then if ye should behold the Son of man ascending where he was before ?
ASV	John	6	63	It is the spirit that giveth life ; the flesh profiteth nothing : the words that I have spoken unto you are spirit , and are life .
ASV	John	6	64	But there are some of you that believe not . For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not , and who it was that should [ p ] betray him .
ASV	John	6	65	And he said , For this cause have I said unto you , that no man can come unto me , except it be given unto him of the Father .
ASV	John	6	66	Upon this many of his disciples went back , and walked no more with him .
ASV	John	6	67	Jesus said therefore unto the twelve , Would ye also go away ?
ASV	John	6	68	Simon Peter answered him , Lord , to whom shall we go ? thou [ q ] hast the words of eternal life .
ASV	John	6	69	And we have believed and know that thou art the Holy One of God .
ASV	John	6	70	Jesus answered them , Did not I choose you the twelve , and one of you is a devil ?
ASV	John	6	71	Now he spake of Judas the son of Simon Iscariot , for he it was that should [ r ] betray him , being one of the twelve .

ASV	John	7	3	His brethren therefore said unto him , Depart hence , and go into Judaea , that thy disciples also may behold thy works which thou doest .
ASV	John	7	4	For no man doeth anything in secret , [ a ] and himself seeketh to be known openly . If thou doest these things , manifest thyself to the world .
ASV	John	7	5	For even his brethren did not believe on him .
ASV	John	7	6	Jesus therefore saith unto them , My time is not yet come ; but your time is always ready .
ASV	John	7	8	Go ye up unto the feast : I go not up [ b ] unto this feast ; because my time is not yet fulfilled .
ASV	John	7	9	And having said these things unto them , he abode still in Galilee .
ASV	John	7	10	But when his brethren were gone up unto the feast , then went he also up , not publicly , but as it were in secret .
ASV	John	7	11	The Jews therefore sought him at the feast , and said , Where is he ?
ASV	John	7	12	And there was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him : some said , He is a good man ; others said , Not so , but he leadeth the multitude astray .
ASV	John	7	13	Yet no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews .
ASV	John	7	14	But when it was now the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple , and taught .
ASV	John	7	15	The Jews therefore marvelled , saying , How knoweth this man letters , having never learned ?
ASV	John	7	16	Jesus therefore answered them , and said , My teaching is not mine , but his that sent me .
ASV	John	7	17	If any man willeth to do his will , he shall know of the teaching , whether it is of God , or whether I speak from myself .
ASV	John	7	18	He that speaketh from himself seeketh his own glory : but he that seeketh the glory of him that sent him , the same is true , and no unrighteousness is in him .
ASV	John	7	19	Did not Moses give you the law , and yet none of you doeth the law ? Why seek ye to kill me ?
ASV	John	7	20	The multitude answered , Thou hast a demon : who seeketh to kill thee ?
ASV	John	7	21	Jesus answered and said unto them , I did one work , and ye all marvel because thereof .
ASV	John	7	22	Moses hath given you circumcision ( not that it is of Moses , but of the fathers ) ; and on the sabbath ye circumcise a man .
ASV	John	7	23	If a man receiveth circumcision on the sabbath , that the law of Moses may not be broken ; are ye wroth with me , because I made [ c ] a man every whit whole on the sabbath ?
ASV	John	7	24	Judge not according to appearance , but judge righteous judgment .
ASV	John	7	25	Some therefore of them of Jerusalem said , Is not this he whom they seek to kill ?
ASV	John	7	26	And lo , he speaketh openly , and they say nothing unto him . Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is the Christ ?
ASV	John	7	27	Howbeit we know this man whence he is : but when the Christ cometh , no one knoweth whence he is .
ASV	John	7	28	Jesus therefore cried in the temple , teaching and saying , Ye both know me , and know whence I am ; and I am not come of myself , but he that sent me is true , whom ye know not .
ASV	John	7	29	I know him ; because I am from him , and he sent me .
ASV	John	7	30	They sought therefore to take him : and no man laid his hand on him , because his hour was not yet come .
ASV	John	7	31	But of the multitude many believed on him ; and they said , When the Christ shall come , will he do more signs than those which this man hath done ?
ASV	John	7	32	The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him ; and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to take him .
ASV	John	7	33	Jesus therefore said , Yet a little while am I with you , and I go unto him that sent me .
ASV	John	7	34	Ye shall seek me , and shall not find me : and where I am , ye can not come .
ASV	John	7	35	The Jews therefore said among themselves , Whither will this man go that we shall not find him ? will he go unto the Dispersion [ d ] among the Greeks , and teach the Greeks ?
ASV	John	7	36	What is this word that he said , Ye shall seek me , and shall not find me ; and where I am , ye can not come ?
ASV	John	7	37	Now on the last day , the great day of the feast , Jesus stood and cried , saying , If any man thirst , let him come unto me and drink .
ASV	John	7	38	He that believeth on me , as the scripture hath said , [ e ] from within him shall flow rivers of living water .
ASV	John	7	39	But this spake he of the Spirit , which they that believed on him were to receive : [ f ] for the Spirit was not yet given ; because Jesus was not yet glorified .
ASV	John	7	40	Some of the multitude therefore , when they heard these words , said , This is of a truth the prophet .
ASV	John	7	41	Others said , This is the Christ . But some said , What , doth the Christ come out of Galilee ?
ASV	John	7	42	[ g ] Hath not the scripture said that the Christ cometh of the seed of David , and from Bethlehem , the village where David was ?
ASV	John	7	43	So there arose a division in the multitude because of him .
ASV	John	7	44	And some of them would have taken him ; but no man laid hands on him .
ASV	John	7	45	The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees ; and they said unto them , Why did ye not bring him ?
ASV	John	7	46	The officers answered , Never man so spake .
ASV	John	7	47	The Pharisees therefore answered them , Are ye also led astray ?
ASV	John	7	48	Hath any of the rulers believed on him , or of the Pharisees ?
ASV	John	7	49	But this multitude that knoweth not the law are accursed .
ASV	John	7	50	Nicodemus saith unto them ( he that came to him before , being one of them ) ,
ASV	John	7	51	Doth our law judge a man , except it first hear from himself and know what he doeth ?
ASV	John	7	52	They answered and said unto him , Art thou also of Galilee ? Search , and [ h ] see that out of Galilee ariseth no prophet .
ASV	John	7	53	[ i ] [ And they went every man unto his own house : Footnotes - John 7:4 Some ancient authorities read and seeketh it to be known openly . - John 7:8 Many ancient authorities add yet . - John 7:23 Greek a whole man sound . - John 7:35 Greek of . - John 7:38 Greek out of his belly . - John 7:39 Some ancient authorities read for the Holy Spirit was not yet given . - John 7:42
ASV	John	8	8	And again he stooped down , and with his finger wrote on the ground .
ASV	John	8	1	but Jesus went unto the mount of Olives .
ASV	John	8	2	And early in the morning he came again into the temple , and all the people came unto him ; and he sat down , and taught them .
ASV	John	8	3	And the scribes and the Pharisees bring a woman taken in adultery ; and having set her in the midst ,
ASV	John	8	4	they say unto him , Teacher , this woman hath been taken in adultery , in the very act .
ASV	John	8	5	[ a ] Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such : what then sayest thou of her ?
ASV	John	8	6	And this they said , trying him , that they might have whereof to accuse him . But Jesus stooped down , and with his finger wrote on the ground .
ASV	John	8	7	But when they continued asking him , he lifted up himself , and said unto them , He that is without sin among you , let him first cast a stone at her .
ASV	John	8	9	And they , when they heard it , went out one by one , beginning from the eldest , even unto the last : and Jesus was left alone , and the woman , where she was , in the midst .
ASV	John	8	10	And Jesus lifted up himself , and said unto her , Woman , where are they ? did no man condemn thee ?
ASV	John	8	11	And she said , No man , Lord . And Jesus said , Neither do I condemn thee : go thy way ; from henceforth sin no more . ]
ASV	John	8	12	Again therefore Jesus spake unto them , saying , I am the light of the world : he that followeth me shall not walk in the darkness , but shall have the light of life .
ASV	John	8	13	The Pharisees therefore said unto him , Thou bearest witness of thyself ; thy witness is not true .
ASV	John	8	14	Jesus answered and said unto them , Even if I bear witness of myself , my witness is true ; for I know whence I came , and whither I go ; but ye know not whence I come , or whither I go .
ASV	John	8	15	Ye judge after the flesh ; I judge no man .
ASV	John	8	16	Yea and if I judge , my judgment is true ; for I am not alone , but I and the Father that sent me .
ASV	John	8	17	Yea and in your law it is written , [ b ] that the witness of two men is true .
ASV	John	8	18	I am he that beareth witness of myself , and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me .
ASV	John	8	19	They said therefore unto him , Where is thy Father ? Jesus answered , Ye know neither me , nor my Father : if ye knew me , ye would know my Father also .
ASV	John	8	20	These words spake he in the treasury , as he taught in the temple : and no man took him ; because his hour was not yet come .
ASV	John	8	21	He said therefore again unto them , I go away , and ye shall seek me , and shall die in your sin : whither I go , ye can not come .
ASV	John	8	22	The Jews therefore said , Will he kill himself , that he saith , Whither I go , ye can not come ?
ASV	John	8	23	And he said unto them , Ye are from beneath ; I am from above : ye are of this world ; I am not of this world .
ASV	John	8	24	I said therefore unto you , that ye shall die in your sins : for except ye believe that I am he , ye shall die in your sins .
ASV	John	8	25	They said therefore unto him , Who art thou ? Jesus said unto them , [ c ] Even that which I have also spoken unto you from the beginning .
ASV	John	8	26	I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you : howbeit he that sent me is true ; and the things which I heard from him , these speak I unto the world .
ASV	John	8	27	They perceived not that he spake to them of the Father .
ASV	John	8	28	Jesus therefore said , When ye have lifted up the Son of man , then shall ye know that [ d ] I am he , and that I do nothing of myself , but as the Father taught me , I speak these things .
ASV	John	8	29	And he that sent me is with me ; he hath not left me alone ; for I do always the things that are pleasing to him .
ASV	John	8	30	As he spake these things , many believed on him .
ASV	John	8	31	Jesus therefore said to those Jews that had believed him , If ye abide in my word , then are ye truly my disciples ;
ASV	John	8	32	and ye shall know the truth , and the truth shall make you free .
ASV	John	8	33	They answered unto him , We are Abraham ’ s seed , and have never yet been in bondage to any man : how sayest thou , Ye shall be made free ?
ASV	John	8	34	Jesus answered them , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Every one that committeth sin is the bondservant of sin .
ASV	John	8	35	And the bondservant abideth not in the house for ever : the son abideth for ever .
ASV	John	8	36	If therefore the Son shall make you free , ye shall be free indeed .
ASV	John	8	37	I know that ye are Abraham ’ s seed ; yet ye seek to kill me , because my word [ e ] hath not free course in you .
ASV	John	8	38	I speak the things which I have seen with [ f ] my Father : and ye also do the things which ye heard from your father .
ASV	John	8	39	They answered and said unto him , Our father is Abraham . Jesus saith unto them , If ye [ g ] were Abraham ’ s children , [ h ] ye would do the works of Abraham .
ASV	John	8	40	But now ye seek to kill me , a man that hath told you the truth , which I heard from God : this did not Abraham .
ASV	John	8	41	Ye do the works of your father . They said unto him , We were not born of fornication ; we have one Father , even God .
ASV	John	8	42	Jesus said unto them , If God were your Father , ye would love me : for I came forth and am come from God ; for neither have I come of myself , but he sent me .
ASV	John	8	43	Why do ye not [ i ] understand my speech ? Even because ye can not hear my word .
ASV	John	8	44	Ye are of your father the devil , and the lusts of your father it is your will to do . He was a murderer from the beginning , and standeth not in the truth , because there is no truth in him . [ j ] When he speaketh a lie , he speaketh of his own : for he is a liar , and the father thereof .
ASV	John	8	45	But because I say the truth , ye believe me not .
ASV	John	8	46	Which of you convicteth me of sin ? If I say truth , why do ye not believe me ?
ASV	John	8	47	He that is of God heareth the words of God : for this cause ye hear them not , because ye are not of God .
ASV	John	8	48	The Jews answered and said unto him , Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan , and hast a demon ?
ASV	John	8	49	Jesus answered , I have not a demon ; but I honor my Father , and ye dishonor me .
ASV	John	8	50	But I seek not mine own glory : there is one that seeketh and judgeth .
ASV	John	8	51	Verily , verily , I say unto you , If a man keep my word , he shall never see death .
ASV	John	8	52	The Jews said unto him , Now we know that thou hast a demon . Abraham died , and the prophets ; and thou sayest , If a man keep my word , he shall never taste of death .
ASV	John	8	53	Art thou greater than our father Abraham , who died ? and the prophets died : whom makest thou thyself ?
ASV	John	8	54	Jesus answered , If I glorify myself , my glory is nothing : it is my Father that glorifieth me ; of whom ye say , that he is your God ;
ASV	John	8	55	and ye have not known him : but I know him ; and if I should say , I know him not , I shall be like unto you , a liar : but I know him , and keep his word .
ASV	John	8	56	Your father Abraham rejoiced [ k ] to see my day ; and he saw it , and was glad .
ASV	John	8	57	The Jews therefore said unto him , Thou art not yet fifty years old , and hast thou seen Abraham ?
ASV	John	8	58	Jesus said unto them , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Before Abraham was born , I am .
ASV	John	8	59	They took up stones therefore to cast at him : but Jesus [ l ] hid himself , and went out of the temple [ m ] .

ASV	John	9	9	Others said , It is he : others said , No , but he is like him . He said , I am he .
ASV	John	9	2	And his disciples asked him , saying , Rabbi , who sinned , this man , or his parents , that he should be born blind ?
ASV	John	9	3	Jesus answered , Neither did this man sin , nor his parents : but that the works of God should be made manifest in him .
ASV	John	9	4	We must work the works of him that sent me , while it is day : the night cometh , when no man can work .
ASV	John	9	5	When I am in the world , I am the light of the world .
ASV	John	9	6	When he had thus spoken , he spat on the ground , and made clay of the spittle , [ a ] and anointed his eyes with the clay ,
ASV	John	9	7	and said unto him , Go , wash in the pool of Siloam ( which is by interpretation , Sent ) . He went away therefore , and washed , and came seeing .
ASV	John	9	8	The neighbors therefore , and they that saw him aforetime , that he was a beggar , said , Is not this he that sat and begged ?
ASV	John	9	10	They said therefore unto him , How then were thine eyes opened ?
ASV	John	9	11	He answered , The man that is called Jesus made clay , and anointed mine eyes , and said unto me , Go to Siloam , and wash : so I went away and washed , and I received sight .
ASV	John	9	12	And they said unto him , Where is he ? He saith , I know not .
ASV	John	9	13	They bring to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind .
ASV	John	9	14	Now it was the sabbath on the day when Jesus made the clay , and opened his eyes .
ASV	John	9	15	Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight . And he said unto them , He put clay upon mine eyes , and I washed , and I see .
ASV	John	9	16	Some therefore of the Pharisees said , This man is not from God , because he keepeth not the sabbath . But others said , How can a man that is a sinner do such signs ? And there was a division among them .
ASV	John	9	17	They say therefore unto the blind man again , What sayest thou of him , in that he opened thine eyes ? And he said , He is a prophet .
ASV	John	9	18	The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him , that he had been blind , and had received his sight , until they called the parents of him that had received his sight ,
ASV	John	9	19	and asked them , saying , Is this your son , who ye say was born blind ? how then doth he now see ?
ASV	John	9	20	His parents answered and said , We know that this is our son , and that he was born blind :
ASV	John	9	21	but how he now seeth , we know not ; or who opened his eyes , we know not : ask him ; he is of age ; he shall speak for himself .
ASV	John	9	22	These things said his parents , because they feared the Jews : for the Jews had agreed already , that if any man should confess him to be Christ , he should be put out of the synagogue .
ASV	John	9	23	Therefore said his parents , He is of age ; ask him .
ASV	John	9	24	So they called a second time the man that was blind , and said unto him , Give glory to God : we know that this man is a sinner .
ASV	John	9	25	He therefore answered , Whether he is a sinner , I know not : one thing I know , that , whereas I was blind , now I see .
ASV	John	9	26	They said therefore unto him , What did he to thee ? how opened he thine eyes ?
ASV	John	9	27	He answered them , I told you even now , and ye did not hear ; wherefore would ye hear it again ? would ye also become his disciples ?
ASV	John	9	28	And they reviled him , and said , Thou art his disciple ; but we are disciples of Moses .
ASV	John	9	29	We know that God hath spoken unto Moses : but as for this man , we know not whence he is .
ASV	John	9	30	The man answered and said unto them , Why , herein is the marvel , that ye know not whence he is , and yet he opened mine eyes .
ASV	John	9	31	We know that God heareth not sinners : but if any man be a worshipper of God , and do his will , him he heareth .
ASV	John	9	32	Since the world began it was never heard that any one opened the eyes of a man born blind .
ASV	John	9	33	If this man were not from God , he could do nothing .
ASV	John	9	34	They answered and said unto him , Thou wast altogether born in sins , and dost thou teach us ? And they cast him out .
ASV	John	9	35	Jesus heard that they had cast him out ; and finding him , he said , Dost thou believe on [ b ] the Son of God ?
ASV	John	9	36	He answered and said , And who is he , Lord , that I may believe on him ?
ASV	John	9	37	Jesus said unto him , Thou hast both seen him , and he it is that speaketh with thee .
ASV	John	9	38	And he said , Lord , I believe . And he [ c ] worshipped him .
ASV	John	9	39	And Jesus said , For judgment came I into this world , that they that see not may see ; and that they that see may become blind .
ASV	John	9	40	Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things , and said unto him , Are we also blind ?
ASV	John	9	41	Jesus said unto them , If ye were blind , ye would have no sin : but now ye say , We see : your sin remaineth .
ASV	John	10	10	The thief cometh not , but that he may steal , and kill , and destroy : I came that they may have life , and may [ d ] have it abundantly .
ASV	John	10	2	But he that entereth in by the door is [ a ] the shepherd of the sheep .
ASV	John	10	3	To him the porter openeth ; and the sheep hear his voice : and he calleth his own sheep by name , and leadeth them out .
ASV	John	10	4	When he hath put forth all his own , he goeth before them , and the sheep follow him : for they know his voice .
ASV	John	10	5	And a stranger will they not follow , but will flee from him : for they know not the voice of strangers .
ASV	John	10	6	This [ b ] parable spake Jesus unto them : but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them .
ASV	John	10	7	Jesus therefore said unto them again , Verily , verily , I say unto you , I am the door of the sheep .
ASV	John	10	8	All that came [ c ] before me are thieves and robbers : but the sheep did not hear them .
ASV	John	10	9	I am the door ; by me if any man enter in , he shall be saved , and shall go in and go out , and shall find pasture .
ASV	John	10	11	I am the good shepherd : the good shepherd layeth down his life for the sheep .
ASV	John	10	12	He that is a hireling , and not a shepherd , whose own the sheep are not , beholdeth the wolf coming , and leaveth the sheep , and fleeth , and the wolf snatcheth them , and scattereth them :
ASV	John	10	13	he fleeth because he is a hireling , and careth not for the sheep .
ASV	John	10	14	I am the good shepherd ; and I know mine own , and mine own know me ,
ASV	John	10	15	even as the Father knoweth me , and I know the Father ; and I lay down my life for the sheep .
ASV	John	10	16	And other sheep I have , which are not of this fold : them also I must [ e ] bring , and they shall hear my voice ; and [ f ] they shall become one flock , one shepherd .
ASV	John	10	17	Therefore doth the Father love me , because I lay down my life , that I may take it again .
ASV	John	10	18	No one [ g ] taketh it away from me , but I lay it down of myself . I have [ h ] power to lay it down , and I have [ i ] power to take it again . This commandment received I from my Father .
ASV	John	10	19	There arose a division again among the Jews because of these words .
ASV	John	10	20	And many of them said , He hath a demon , and is mad ; why hear ye him ?
ASV	John	10	21	Others said , These are not the sayings of one possessed with a demon . Can a demon open the eyes of the blind ?
ASV	John	10	22	[ j ] And it was the feast of the dedication at Jerusalem :
ASV	John	10	23	it was winter ; and Jesus was walking in the temple in Solomon ’ s [ k ] porch .
ASV	John	10	24	The Jews therefore came round about him , and said unto him , How long dost thou hold us in suspense ? If thou art the Christ , tell us plainly .
ASV	John	10	25	Jesus answered them , I told you , and ye believe not : the works that I do in my Father ’ s name , these bear witness of me .
ASV	John	10	26	But ye believe not , because ye are not of my sheep .
ASV	John	10	27	My sheep hear my voice , and I know them , and they follow me :
ASV	John	10	28	and I give unto them eternal life ; and they shall never perish , and no one shall snatch them out of my hand .
ASV	John	10	29	[ l ] My Father , who hath given them unto me , is greater than all ; and no one is able to snatch [ m ] them out of the Father ’ s hand .
ASV	John	10	30	I and the Father are one .
ASV	John	10	31	The Jews took up stones again to stone him .
ASV	John	10	32	Jesus answered them , Many good works have I showed you from the Father ; for which of those works do ye stone me ?
ASV	John	10	33	The Jews answered him , For a good work we stone thee not , but for blasphemy ; and because that thou , being a man , makest thyself God .
ASV	John	10	34	Jesus answered them , Is it not written in your law , [ n ] I said , Ye are gods ?
ASV	John	10	35	If he called them gods , unto whom the word of God came ( and the scripture can not be broken ) ,
ASV	John	10	36	say ye of him , whom the Father [ o ] sanctified and sent into the world , Thou blasphemest ; because I said , I am the Son of God ?
ASV	John	10	37	If I do not the works of my Father , believe me not .
ASV	John	10	38	But if I do them , though ye believe not me , believe the works : that ye may know and understand that the Father is in me , and I in the Father .
ASV	John	10	39	They sought again to take him : and he went forth out of their hand .
ASV	John	10	40	And he went away again beyond the Jordan into the place where John was at the first baptizing ; and there he abode .
ASV	John	10	41	And many came unto him ; and they said , John indeed did no sign : but all things whatsoever John spake of this man were true .
ASV	John	10	42	And many believed on him there .

ASV	John	11	11	These things spake he : and after this he saith unto them , Our friend Lazarus is fallen asleep ; but I go , that I may awake him out of sleep .
ASV	John	11	2	And it was that Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment , and wiped his feet with her hair , whose brother Lazarus was sick .
ASV	John	11	3	The sisters therefore sent unto him , saying , Lord , behold , he whom thou lovest is sick .
ASV	John	11	4	But when Jesus heard it , he said , This sickness is not unto death , but for the glory of God , that the Son of God may be glorified thereby .
ASV	John	11	5	Now Jesus loved Martha , and her sister , and Lazarus .
ASV	John	11	6	When therefore he heard that he was sick , he abode at that time two days in the place where he was .
ASV	John	11	7	Then after this he saith to the disciples , Let us go into Judaea again .
ASV	John	11	8	The disciples say unto him , Rabbi , the Jews were but now seeking to stone thee ; and goest thou thither again ?
ASV	John	11	9	Jesus answered , Are there not twelve hours in the day ? If a man walk in the day , he stumbleth not , because he seeth the light of this world .
ASV	John	11	10	But if a man walk in the night , he stumbleth , because the light is not in him .
ASV	John	11	12	The disciples therefore said unto him , Lord , if he is fallen asleep , he will [ a ] recover .
ASV	John	11	13	Now Jesus had spoken of his death : but they thought that he spake of taking rest in sleep .
ASV	John	11	14	Then Jesus therefore said unto them plainly , Lazarus is dead .
ASV	John	11	15	And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there , to the intent ye may believe ; nevertheless let us go unto him .
ASV	John	11	16	Thomas therefore , who is called [ b ] Didymus , said unto his fellow-disciples , Let us also go , that we may die with him .
ASV	John	11	17	So when Jesus came , he found that he had been in the tomb four days already .
ASV	John	11	18	Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem , about fifteen furlongs off ;
ASV	John	11	19	and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary , to console them concerning their brother .
ASV	John	11	20	Martha therefore , when she heard that Jesus was coming , went and met him : but Mary still sat in the house .
ASV	John	11	21	Martha therefore said unto Jesus , Lord , if thou hadst been here , my brother had not died .
ASV	John	11	22	And even now I know that , whatsoever thou shalt ask of God , God will give thee .
ASV	John	11	23	Jesus saith unto her , Thy brother shall rise again .
ASV	John	11	24	Martha saith unto him , I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day .
ASV	John	11	25	Jesus said unto her , I am the resurrection , and the life : he that believeth on me , though he die , yet shall he live ;
ASV	John	11	26	and whosoever liveth and believeth on me shall never die . Believest thou this ?
ASV	John	11	27	She saith unto him , Yea , Lord : I have believed that thou art the Christ , the Son of God , even he that cometh into the world .
ASV	John	11	28	And when she had said this , she went away , and called Mary [ c ] her sister secretly , saying , The Teacher is here , and calleth thee .
ASV	John	11	29	And she , when she heard it , arose quickly , and went unto him .
ASV	John	11	30	( Now Jesus was not yet come into the village , but was still in the place where Martha met him . )
ASV	John	11	31	The Jews then who were with her in the house , and were consoling her , when they saw Mary , that she rose up quickly and went out , followed her , supposing that she was going unto the tomb to [ d ] weep there .
ASV	John	11	32	Mary therefore , when she came where Jesus was , and saw him , fell down at his feet , saying unto him , Lord , if thou hadst been here , my brother had not died .
ASV	John	11	33	When Jesus therefore saw her [ e ] weeping , and the Jews also [ f ] weeping who came with her , he [ g ] groaned in the spirit , and [ h ] was troubled ,
ASV	John	11	34	and said , Where have ye laid him ? They say unto him , Lord , come and see .
ASV	John	11	35	Jesus wept .
ASV	John	11	36	The Jews therefore said , Behold how he loved him !
ASV	John	11	37	But some of them said , Could not this man , who opened the eyes of him that was blind , have caused that this man also should not die ?
ASV	John	11	38	Jesus therefore again [ i ] groaning in himself cometh to the tomb . Now it was a cave , and a stone lay [ j ] against it .
ASV	John	11	39	Jesus saith , Take ye away the stone . Martha , the sister of him that was dead , saith unto him , Lord , by this time [ k ] the body decayeth ; for he hath been dead four days .
ASV	John	11	40	Jesus saith unto her , Said I not unto thee , that , if thou believedst , thou shouldest see the glory of God ?
ASV	John	11	41	So they took away the stone . And Jesus lifted up his eyes , and said , Father , I thank thee that thou heardest me .
ASV	John	11	42	And I knew that thou hearest me always : but because of the multitude that standeth around I said it , that they may believe that thou didst send me .
ASV	John	11	43	And when he had thus spoken , he cried with a loud voice , Lazarus , come forth .
ASV	John	11	44	He that was dead came forth , bound hand and foot with [ l ] grave-clothes ; and his face was bound about with a napkin . Jesus saith unto them , Loose him , and let him go .
ASV	John	11	45	Many therefore of the Jews , who came to Mary and beheld [ m ] that which he did , believed on him .
ASV	John	11	46	But some of them went away to the Pharisees , and told them the things which Jesus had done .
ASV	John	11	47	The chief priests therefore and the Pharisees gathered a council , and said , What do we ? for this man doeth many signs .
ASV	John	11	48	If we let him thus alone , all men will believe on him : and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation .
ASV	John	11	49	But a certain one of them , Caiaphas , being high priest that year , said unto them , Ye know nothing at all ,
ASV	John	11	50	nor do ye take account that it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people , and that the whole nation perish not .
ASV	John	11	51	Now this he said not of himself : but being high priest that year , he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation ;
ASV	John	11	52	and not for the nation only , but that he might also gather together into one the children of God that are scattered abroad .
ASV	John	11	53	So from that day forth they took counsel that they might put him to death .
ASV	John	11	54	Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews , but departed thence into the country near to the wilderness , into a city called Ephraim ; and there he tarried with the disciples .
ASV	John	11	55	Now the passover of the Jews was at hand : and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the passover , to purify themselves .
ASV	John	11	56	They sought therefore for Jesus , and spake one with another , as they stood in the temple , What think ye ? That he will not come to the feast ?
ASV	John	11	57	Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given commandment , that , if any man knew where he was , he should show it , that they might take him .

ASV	John	12	12	On the morrow [ h ] a great multitude that had come to the feast , when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem ,
ASV	John	12	2	So they made him a supper there : and Martha served ; but Lazarus was one of them that [ a ] sat at meat with him .
ASV	John	12	3	Mary therefore took a pound of ointment of [ b ] pure nard , very precious , and anointed the feet of Jesus , and wiped his feet with her hair : and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment .
ASV	John	12	4	But Judas Iscariot , one of his disciples , that should [ c ] betray him , saith ,
ASV	John	12	5	Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred [ d ] shillings , and given to the poor ?
ASV	John	12	6	Now this he said , not because he cared for the poor ; but because he was a thief , and having the [ e ] bag [ f ] took away what was put therein .
ASV	John	12	7	Jesus therefore said , [ g ] Suffer her to keep it against the day of my burying .
ASV	John	12	8	For the poor ye have always with you ; but me ye have not always .

ASV	John	12	10	But the chief priests took counsel that they might put Lazarus also to death ;
ASV	John	12	11	because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away , and believed on Jesus .
ASV	John	12	13	took the branches of the palm trees , and went forth to meet him , and cried out , Hosanna : Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord , even the King of Israel .
ASV	John	12	14	And Jesus , having found a young ass , sat thereon ; as it is written ,
ASV	John	12	15	[ i ] Fear not , daughter of Zion : behold , thy King cometh , sitting on an ass ’ s colt .
ASV	John	12	16	These things understood not his disciples at the first : but when Jesus was glorified , then remembered they that these things were written of him , and that they had done these things unto him .
ASV	John	12	17	The multitude therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb , and raised him from the dead , bare witness .
ASV	John	12	18	For this cause also the multitude went and met him , for that they heard that he had done this sign .
ASV	John	12	19	The Pharisees therefore said among themselves , [ j ] Behold how ye prevail nothing ; lo , the world is gone after him .
ASV	John	12	20	Now there were certain Greeks among those that went up to worship at the feast :
ASV	John	12	21	these therefore came to Philip , who was of Bethsaida of Galilee , and asked him , saying , Sir , we would see Jesus .
ASV	John	12	22	Philip cometh and telleth Andrew : Andrew cometh , and Philip , and they tell Jesus .
ASV	John	12	23	And Jesus answereth them , saying , The hour is come , that the Son of man should be glorified .
ASV	John	12	24	Verily , verily , I say unto you , Except a grain of wheat fall into the earth and die , it abideth by itself alone ; but if it die , it beareth much fruit .
ASV	John	12	25	He that loveth his [ k ] life loseth it ; and he that hateth his [ l ] life in this world shall keep it unto [ m ] life eternal .
ASV	John	12	26	If any man serve me , let him follow me ; and where I am , there shall also my servant be : if any man serve me , him will the Father honor .
ASV	John	12	27	Now is my soul troubled ; and what shall I say ? Father , save me from this [ n ] hour . But for this cause came I unto this hour .
ASV	John	12	28	Father , glorify thy name . There came therefore a voice out of heaven , saying , I have both glorified it , and will glorify it again .
ASV	John	12	29	The multitude therefore , that stood by , and heard it , said that it had thundered : others said , An angel hath spoken to him .
ASV	John	12	30	Jesus answered and said , This voice hath not come for my sake , but for your sakes .
ASV	John	12	31	Now is [ o ] the judgment of this world : now shall the prince of this world be cast out .
ASV	John	12	32	And I , if I be lifted up [ p ] from the earth , will draw all men unto myself .
ASV	John	12	33	But this he said , signifying by what manner of death he should die .
ASV	John	12	34	The multitude therefore answered him , We have heard out of the law that the Christ abideth for ever : and how sayest thou , The Son of man must be lifted up ? who is this Son of man ?
ASV	John	12	35	Jesus therefore said unto them , Yet a little while is the light [ q ] among you . Walk while ye have the light , that darkness overtake you not : and he that walketh in the darkness knoweth not whither he goeth .
ASV	John	12	36	While ye have the light , believe on the light , that ye may become sons of light . These things spake Jesus , and he departed and [ r ] hid himself from them .
ASV	John	12	37	But though he had done so many signs before them , yet they believed not on him :
ASV	John	12	38	that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled , which he spake , [ s ] Lord , who hath believed our report ? And to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed ?
ASV	John	12	39	For this cause they could not believe , for that Isaiah said again ,
ASV	John	12	40	[ t ] He hath blinded their eyes , and he hardened their heart ; Lest they should see with their eyes , and perceive with their heart , And should turn , And I should heal them .
ASV	John	12	41	These things said Isaiah , because he saw his glory ; and he spake of him .
ASV	John	12	42	Nevertheless even of the rulers many believed on him ; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess [ u ] it , lest they should be put out of the synagogue :
ASV	John	12	43	for they loved the glory that is of men more than the glory that is of God .
ASV	John	12	44	And Jesus cried and said , He that believeth on me , believeth not on me , but on him that sent me .
ASV	John	12	45	And he that beholdeth me beholdeth him that sent me .
ASV	John	12	46	I am come a light into the world , that whosoever believeth on me may not abide in the darkness .
ASV	John	12	47	And if any man hear my sayings , and keep them not , I judge him not : for I came not to judge the world , but to save the world .
ASV	John	12	48	He that rejecteth me , and receiveth not my sayings , hath one that judgeth him : the word that I spake , the same shall judge him in the last day .
ASV	John	12	49	For I spake not from myself ; but the Father that sent me , he hath given me a commandment , what I should say , and what I should speak .
ASV	John	12	50	And I know that his commandment is life eternal ; the things therefore which I speak , even as the Father hath said unto me , so I speak .

ASV	John	13	13	Ye call me , Teacher , and , Lord : and ye say well ; for so I am .
ASV	John	13	2	And during supper , the devil having already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot , Simon ’ s son , to [ b ] betray him ,
ASV	John	13	3	Jesus , knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands , and that he came forth from God , and goeth unto God ,
ASV	John	13	4	riseth from supper , and layeth aside his garments ; and he took a towel , and girded himself .
ASV	John	13	5	Then he poureth water into the basin , and began to wash the disciples ’ feet , and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded .
ASV	John	13	6	So he cometh to Simon Peter . He saith unto him , Lord , dost thou wash my feet ?
ASV	John	13	7	Jesus answered and said unto him , What I do thou knowest not now ; but thou shalt understand hereafter .
ASV	John	13	8	Peter saith unto him , Thou shalt never wash my feet . Jesus answered him , If I wash thee not , thou hast no part with me .
ASV	John	13	9	Simon Peter saith unto him , Lord , not my feet only , but also my hands and my head .
ASV	John	13	10	Jesus saith to him , He that is bathed needeth not [ c ] save to wash his feet , but is clean every whit : and ye are clean , but not all .
ASV	John	13	11	For he knew him that should [ d ] betray him ; therefore said he , Ye are not all clean .
ASV	John	13	12	So when he had washed their feet , and taken his garments , and [ e ] sat down again , he said unto them , Know ye what I have done to you ?
ASV	John	13	14	If I then , the Lord and the Teacher , have washed your feet , ye also ought to wash one another ’ s feet .
ASV	John	13	15	For I have given you an example , that ye also should do as I have done to you .
ASV	John	13	16	Verily , verily , I say unto you , A [ f ] servant is not greater than his lord ; neither [ g ] one that is sent greater than he that sent him .
ASV	John	13	17	If ye know these things , blessed are ye if ye do them .
ASV	John	13	18	I speak not of you all : I know whom I [ h ] have chosen : but that the scripture may be fulfilled , [ i ] He that eateth [ j ] my bread lifted up his heel against me .
ASV	John	13	19	From henceforth I tell you before it come to pass , that , when it is come to pass , ye may believe that I am he .
ASV	John	13	20	Verily , verily , I say unto you , He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me ; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me .
ASV	John	13	21	When Jesus had thus said , he was troubled in the spirit , and testified , and said , Verily , verily , I say unto you , that one of you shall [ k ] betray me .
ASV	John	13	22	The disciples looked one on another , doubting of whom he spake .
ASV	John	13	23	There was at the table reclining in Jesus ’ bosom one of his disciples , whom Jesus loved .
ASV	John	13	24	Simon Peter therefore beckoneth to him , and saith unto him , Tell us who it is of whom he speaketh .
ASV	John	13	25	He leaning back , as he was , on Jesus ’ breast saith unto him , Lord , who is it ?
ASV	John	13	26	Jesus therefore answereth , He it is , for whom I shall dip the sop , and give it him . So when he had dipped the sop , he taketh and giveth it to Judas , the son of Simon Iscariot .
ASV	John	13	27	And after the sop , then entered Satan into him . Jesus therefore saith unto him , What thou doest , do quickly .
ASV	John	13	28	Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him .
ASV	John	13	29	For some thought , because Judas had the [ l ] bag , that Jesus said unto him , Buy what things we have need of for the feast ; or , that he should give something to the poor .
ASV	John	13	30	He then having received the sop went out straightway : and it was night .
ASV	John	13	31	When therefore he was gone out , Jesus saith , Now [ m ] is the Son of man glorified , and God [ n ] is glorified in him ;
ASV	John	13	32	and God shall glorify him in himself , and straightway shall he glorify him .
ASV	John	13	33	Little children , yet a little while I am with you . Ye shall seek me : and as I said unto the Jews , Whither I go , ye can not come ; so now I say unto you .
ASV	John	13	34	A new commandment I give unto you , that ye love one another ; [ o ] even as I have loved you , that ye also love one another .
ASV	John	13	35	By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples , if ye have love one to another .
ASV	John	13	36	Simon Peter saith unto him , Lord , whither goest thou ? Jesus answered , Whither I go , thou canst not follow me now ; but thou shalt follow afterwards .
ASV	John	13	37	Peter saith unto him , Lord , why can not I follow thee even now ? I will lay down my life for thee .
ASV	John	13	38	Jesus answereth , Wilt thou lay down thy life for me ? Verily , verily , I say unto thee , The cock shall not crow , till thou hast denied me thrice .

ASV	John	14	2	In my Father ’ s house are many [ b ] mansions ; if it were not so , I would have told you ; for I go to prepare a place for you .
ASV	John	14	3	And if I go and prepare a place for you , I come again , and will receive you unto myself ; that where I am , there ye may be also .
ASV	John	14	4	[ c ] And whither I go , ye know the way .
ASV	John	14	5	Thomas saith unto him , Lord , we know not whither thou goest ; how know we the way ?
ASV	John	14	6	Jesus saith unto him , I am the way , and the truth , and the life : no one cometh unto the Father , but [ d ] by me .
ASV	John	14	7	If ye had known me , ye would have known my Father also : from henceforth ye know him , and have seen him .
ASV	John	14	8	Philip saith unto him , Lord , show us the Father , and it sufficeth us .
ASV	John	14	9	Jesus saith unto him , Have I been so long time with you , and dost thou not know me , Philip ? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father ; how sayest thou , Show us the Father ?
ASV	John	14	10	Believest thou not that I am in the Father , and the Father in me ? the words that I say unto you I speak not from myself : but the Father abiding in me doeth his works .
ASV	John	14	11	Believe me that I am in the Father , and the Father in me : or else believe me for the very works ’ sake .
ASV	John	14	12	Verily , verily , I say unto you , He that believeth on me , the works that I do shall he do also ; and greater works than these shall he do ; because I go unto the Father .
ASV	John	14	13	And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name , that will I do , that the Father may be glorified in the Son .
ASV	John	14	15	If ye love me , ye will keep my commandments .
ASV	John	14	16	And I will [ f ] pray the Father , and he shall give you another [ g ] Comforter , that he may be with you for ever ,
ASV	John	14	17	even the Spirit of truth : whom the world can not receive ; for it beholdeth him not , neither knoweth him : ye know him ; for he abideth with you , and shall be in you .
ASV	John	14	18	I will not leave you [ h ] desolate : I come unto you .
ASV	John	14	19	Yet a little while , and the world beholdeth me no more ; but ye behold me : because I live , [ i ] ye shall live also .
ASV	John	14	20	In that day ye shall know that I am in my Father , and ye in me , and I in you .
ASV	John	14	21	He that hath my commandments , and keepeth them , he it is that loveth me : and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father , and I will love him , and will manifest myself unto him .
ASV	John	14	22	Judas ( not Iscariot ) saith unto him , Lord , what is come to pass that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us , and not unto the world ?
ASV	John	14	23	Jesus answered and said unto him , If a man love me , he will keep my word : and my Father will love him , and we will come unto him , and make our abode with him .
ASV	John	14	24	He that loveth me not keepeth not my words : and the word which ye hear is not mine , but the Father ’ s who sent me .
ASV	John	14	25	These things have I spoken unto you , while yet abiding with you .
ASV	John	14	26	But the [ j ] Comforter , even the Holy Spirit , whom the Father will send in my name , he shall teach you all things , and bring to your remembrance all that I said unto you .
ASV	John	14	27	Peace I leave with you ; my peace I give unto you : not as the world giveth , give I unto you . Let not your heart be troubled , neither let it be fearful .
ASV	John	14	28	Ye heard how I said to you , I go away , and I come unto you . If ye loved me , ye would have rejoiced , because I go unto the Father : for the Father is greater than I .
ASV	John	14	29	And now I have told you before it come to pass , that , when it is come to pass , ye may believe .
ASV	John	14	30	I will no more speak much with you , for the prince of the world cometh : and he hath nothing [ k ] in me ;
ASV	John	14	31	but that the world may know that I love the Father , and as the Father gave me commandment , even so I do . Arise , let us go hence .

ASV	John	15	15	No longer do I call you [ c ] servants ; for the [ d ] servant knoweth not what his lord doeth : but I have called you friends ; for all things that I heard from my Father I have made known unto you .
ASV	John	15	2	Every branch in me that beareth not fruit , he taketh it away : and every branch that beareth fruit , he cleanseth it , that it may bear more fruit .
ASV	John	15	3	Already ye are clean because of the word which I have spoken unto you .
ASV	John	15	4	Abide in me , and I in you . As the branch can not bear fruit of itself , except it abide in the vine ; so neither can ye , except ye abide in me .
ASV	John	15	5	I am the vine , ye are the branches : He that abideth in me , and I in him , the same beareth much fruit : for apart from me ye can do nothing .
ASV	John	15	6	If a man abide not in me , he is cast forth as a branch , and is withered ; and they gather them , and cast them into the fire , and they are burned .
ASV	John	15	7	If ye abide in me , and my words abide in you , ask whatsoever ye will , and it shall be done unto you .
ASV	John	15	8	Herein [ a ] is my Father glorified , [ b ] that ye bear much fruit ; and so shall ye be my disciples .
ASV	John	15	9	Even as the Father hath loved me , I also have loved you : abide ye in my love .
ASV	John	15	10	If ye keep my commandments , ye shall abide in my love ; even as I have kept my Father ’ s commandments , and abide in his love .
ASV	John	15	11	These things have I spoken unto you , that my joy may be in you , and that your joy may be made full .
ASV	John	15	12	This is my commandment , that ye love one another , even as I have loved you .
ASV	John	15	13	Greater love hath no man than this , that a man lay down his life for his friends .
ASV	John	15	14	Ye are my friends , if ye do the things which I command you .
ASV	John	15	16	Ye did not choose me , but I chose you , and appointed you , that ye should go and bear fruit , and that your fruit should abide : that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name , he may give it you .
ASV	John	15	17	These things I command you , that ye may love one another .
ASV	John	15	18	If the world hateth you , [ e ] ye know that it hath hated me before it hated you .
ASV	John	15	19	If ye were of the world , the world would love its own : but because ye are not of the world , but I chose you out of the world , therefore the world hateth you .
ASV	John	15	20	Remember the word that I said unto you , A [ f ] servant is not greater than his lord . If they persecuted me , they will also persecute you ; if they kept my word , they will keep yours also .
ASV	John	15	21	But all these things will they do unto you for my name ’ s sake , because they know not him that sent me .
ASV	John	15	22	If I had not come and spoken unto them , they had not had sin : but now they have no excuse for their sin .
ASV	John	15	23	He that hateth me hateth my Father also .
ASV	John	15	24	If I had not done among them the works which none other did , they had not had sin : but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father .
ASV	John	15	25	But this cometh to pass , that the word may be fulfilled that is written in their law , [ g ] They hated me without a cause .
ASV	John	15	26	But when the [ h ] Comforter is come , whom I will send unto you from the Father , even the Spirit of truth , which [ i ] proceedeth from the Father , he shall bear witness of me :
ASV	John	15	27	[ j ] and ye also bear witness , because ye have been with me from the beginning .

ASV	John	16	16	A little while , and ye behold me no more ; and again a little while , and ye shall see me .
ASV	John	16	2	They shall put you out of the synagogues : yea , the hour cometh , that whosoever killeth you shall think that he offereth service unto God .
ASV	John	16	3	And these things will they do , because they have not known the Father , nor me .
ASV	John	16	4	But these things have I spoken unto you , that when their hour is come , ye may remember them , how that I told you . And these things I said not unto you from the beginning , because I was with you .
ASV	John	16	5	But now I go unto him that sent me ; and none of you asketh me , Whither goest thou ?
ASV	John	16	6	But because I have spoken these things unto you , sorrow hath filled your heart .
ASV	John	16	7	Nevertheless I tell you the truth : It is expedient for you that I go away ; for if I go not away , the [ a ] Comforter will not come unto you ; but if I go , I will send him unto you .
ASV	John	16	8	And he , when he is come , will convict the world in respect of sin , and of righteousness , and of judgment :
ASV	John	16	9	of sin , because they believe not on me ;
ASV	John	16	10	of righteousness , because I go to the Father , and ye behold me no more ;
ASV	John	16	11	of judgment , because the prince of this world hath been judged .
ASV	John	16	12	I have yet many things to say unto you , but ye can not bear them now .
ASV	John	16	13	Howbeit when he , the Spirit of truth , is come , he shall guide you into all the truth : for he shall not speak from himself ; but what things soever he shall hear , these shall he speak : and he shall declare unto you the things that are to come .
ASV	John	16	14	He shall glorify me : for he shall take of mine , and shall declare it unto you .
ASV	John	16	15	All things whatsoever the Father hath are mine : therefore said I , that he taketh of mine , and shall declare it unto you .
ASV	John	16	17	Some of his disciples therefore said one to another , What is this that he saith unto us , A little while , and ye behold me not ; and again a little while , and ye shall see me : and , Because I go to the Father ?
ASV	John	16	18	They said therefore , What is this that he saith , A little while ? We know not what he saith .
ASV	John	16	19	Jesus perceived that they were desirous to ask him , and he said unto them , Do ye inquire among yourselves concerning this , that I said , A little while , and ye behold me not , and again a little while , and ye shall see me ?

ASV	John	16	21	A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow , because her hour is come : but when she is delivered of the child , she remembereth no more the anguish , for the joy that a man is born into the world .
ASV	John	16	22	And ye therefore now have sorrow : but I will see you again , and your heart shall rejoice , and your joy no one taketh away from you .
ASV	John	16	23	And in that day ye shall [ b ] ask me no question . Verily , verily , I say unto you , If ye shall ask anything of the Father , he will give it you in my name .
ASV	John	16	24	Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name : ask , and ye shall receive , that your joy may be made full .
ASV	John	16	25	These things have I spoken unto you in [ c ] dark sayings : the hour cometh , when I shall no more speak unto you in dark sayings , but shall tell you plainly of the Father .
ASV	John	16	26	; 14:13 ,
ASV	John	16	27	for the Father himself loveth you , because ye have loved me , and have believed that I came forth from the Father .
ASV	John	16	28	I came out from the Father , and am come into the world : again , I leave the world , and go unto the Father .
ASV	John	16	29	His disciples say , Lo , now speakest thou plainly , and speakest no [ e ] dark saying .
ASV	John	16	30	Now know we that thou knowest all things , and needest not that any man should ask thee : by this we believe that thou camest forth from God .
ASV	John	16	31	Jesus answered them , Do ye now believe ?
ASV	John	16	32	Behold , the hour cometh , yea , is come , that ye shall be scattered , every man to his own , and shall leave me alone : and yet I am not alone , because the Father is with me .
ASV	John	16	33	These things have I spoken unto you , that in me ye may have peace . In the world ye have tribulation : but be of good cheer ; I have overcome the world . Footnotes - John 16:7 Or , Advocate . Or , Helper . Greek Paraclete . - John 16:23 Or , ask me nothing . Compare verse

ASV	John	17	2	even as thou gavest him authority over all flesh , that [ a ] to all whom thou hast given him , he should give eternal life .
ASV	John	17	3	And this is life eternal , that they should know thee the only true God , and him whom thou didst send , even Jesus Christ .
ASV	John	17	4	I glorified thee on the earth , having accomplished the work which thou hast given me to do .
ASV	John	17	5	And now , Father , glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was .
ASV	John	17	6	I manifested thy name unto the men whom thou gavest me out of the world : thine they were , and thou gavest them to me ; and they have kept thy word .
ASV	John	17	7	Now they know that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are from thee :
ASV	John	17	8	for the words which thou gavest me I have given unto them ; and they received them , and knew of a truth that I came forth from thee , and they believed that thou didst send me .
ASV	John	17	9	I [ b ] pray for them : I [ c ] pray not for the world , but for those whom thou hast given me ; for they are thine :

ASV	John	17	11	And I am no more in the world , and these are in the world , and I come to thee . Holy Father , keep them in thy name which thou hast given me , that they may be one , even as we are .
ASV	John	17	12	While I was with them , I kept them in thy name which thou hast given me : and I guarded them , and not one of them perished , but the son of perdition ; [ d ] that the scripture might be fulfilled .
ASV	John	17	13	But now I come to thee ; and these things I speak in the world , that they may have my joy made full in themselves .
ASV	John	17	14	I have given them thy word ; and the world hated them , because they are not of the world , even as I am not of the world .

ASV	John	18	2	Now Judas also , who [ c ] betrayed him , knew the place : for Jesus oft-times resorted thither with his disciples .
ASV	John	18	3	,
ASV	John	18	4	Jesus therefore , knowing all the things that were coming upon him , went forth , and saith unto them , Whom seek ye ?
ASV	John	18	5	They answered him , Jesus of Nazareth . Jesus saith unto them , I am he . And Judas also , who [ e ] betrayed him , was standing with them .
ASV	John	18	6	When therefore he said unto them , I am he , they went backward , and fell to the ground .
ASV	John	18	7	Again therefore he asked them , Whom seek ye ? And they said , Jesus of Nazareth .
ASV	John	18	8	Jesus answered , I told you that I am he ; if therefore ye seek me , let these go their way :
ASV	John	18	9	that the word might be fulfilled which he spake , Of those whom thou hast given me I lost not one .
ASV	John	18	10	Simon Peter therefore having a sword drew it , and struck the high priest ’ s [ f ] servant , and cut off his right ear . Now the [ g ] servant ’ s name was Malchus .
ASV	John	18	11	Jesus therefore said unto Peter , Put up the sword into the sheath : the cup which the Father hath given me , shall I not drink it ?
ASV	John	18	12	,
ASV	John	18	13	and led him to Annas first ; for he was father in law to Caiaphas , who was high priest that year .
ASV	John	18	14	Now Caiaphas was he that gave counsel to the Jews , that it was expedient that one man should die for the people .
ASV	John	18	15	And Simon Peter followed Jesus , and so did another disciple . Now that disciple was known unto the high priest , and entered in with Jesus into the court of the high priest ;
ASV	John	18	16	but Peter was standing at the door without . So the other disciple , who was known unto the high priest , went out and spake unto her that kept the door , and brought in Peter .
ASV	John	18	17	The maid therefore that kept the door saith unto Peter , Art thou also one of this man ’ s disciples ? He saith , I am not .
ASV	John	18	19	The high priest therefore asked Jesus of his disciples , and of his teaching .
ASV	John	18	20	Jesus answered him , I have spoken openly to the world ; I ever taught in [ l ] synagogues , and in the temple , where all the Jews come together ; and in secret spake I nothing .
ASV	John	18	21	Why askest thou me ? ask them that have heard me , what I spake unto them : behold , these know the things which I said .
ASV	John	18	22	. - John 18:37 Or , Thou sayest it , because I am a king .
ASV	John	18	23	Jesus answered him , If I have spoken evil , bear witness of the evil : but if well , why smitest thou me ?
ASV	John	18	24	Annas therefore sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest .
ASV	John	18	25	Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself . They said therefore unto him , Art thou also one of his disciples ? He denied , and said , I am not .
ASV	John	18	26	One of the [ n ] servants of the high priest , being a kinsman of him whose ear Peter cut off , saith , Did not I see thee in the garden with him ?
ASV	John	18	27	Peter therefore denied again : and straightway the cock crew .
ASV	John	18	28	They lead Jesus therefore from Caiaphas into the [ o ] Praetorium : and it was early ; and they themselves entered not into the [ p ] Praetorium , that they might not be defiled , but might eat the passover .
ASV	John	18	29	Pilate therefore went out unto them , and saith , What accusation bring ye against this man ?
ASV	John	18	30	They answered and said unto him , If this man were not an evil-doer , we should not have delivered him up unto thee .
ASV	John	18	31	Pilate therefore said unto them , Take him yourselves , and judge him according to your law . The Jews said unto him , It is not lawful for us to put any man to death :
ASV	John	18	32	that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled , which he spake , signifying by what manner of death he should die .
ASV	John	18	33	Pilate therefore entered again into the [ q ] Praetorium , and called Jesus , and said unto him , Art thou the King of the Jews ?
ASV	John	18	34	Jesus answered , Sayest thou this of thyself , or did others tell it thee concerning me ?
ASV	John	18	35	Pilate answered , Am I a Jew ? Thine own nation and the chief priests delivered thee unto me : what hast thou done ?
ASV	John	18	36	Jesus answered , My kingdom is not of this world : if my kingdom were of this world , then would my [ r ] servants fight , that I should not be delivered to the Jews : but now is my kingdom not from hence .
ASV	John	18	37	Pilate therefore said unto him , Art thou a king then ? Jesus answered , [ s ] Thou sayest that I am a king . To this end have I been born , and to this end am I come into the world , that I should bear witness unto the truth . Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice .
ASV	John	18	38	Pilate saith unto him , What is truth ? And when he had said this , he went out again unto the Jews , and saith unto them , I find no crime in him .
ASV	John	18	39	But ye have a custom , that I should release unto you one at the passover : will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews ?
ASV	John	18	40	They cried out therefore again , saying , Not this man , but Barabbas . Now Barabbas was a robber . Footnotes - John 18:1 Or , ravine .

ASV	John	19	19	And Pilate wrote a title also , and put it on the cross . And there was written , Jesus of Nazareth , the King of the Jews .
ASV	John	19	2	And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns , and put it on his head , and arrayed him in a purple garment ;
ASV	John	19	3	and they came unto him , and said , Hail , King of the Jews ! and they struck him [ a ] with their hands .
ASV	John	19	4	And Pilate went out again , and saith unto them , Behold , I bring him out to you , that ye may know that I find no crime in him .
ASV	John	19	5	Jesus therefore came out , wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment . And Pilate saith unto them , Behold , the man !
ASV	John	19	6	When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him , they cried out , saying , Crucify him , crucify him ! Pilate saith unto them , Take him yourselves , and crucify him : for I find no crime in him .
ASV	John	19	7	The Jews answered him , We have a law , and by that law he ought to die , because he made himself the Son of God .
ASV	John	19	8	When Pilate therefore heard this saying , he was the more afraid ;
ASV	John	19	9	and he entered into the [ b ] Praetorium again , and saith unto Jesus , Whence art thou ? But Jesus gave him no answer .
ASV	John	19	10	Pilate therefore saith unto him , Speakest thou not unto me ? knowest thou not that I have [ c ] power to release thee , and have [ d ] power to crucify thee ?
ASV	John	19	11	Jesus answered him , Thou wouldest have no [ e ] power against me , except it were given thee from above : therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath greater sin .
ASV	John	19	12	Upon this Pilate sought to release him : but the Jews cried out , saying , If thou release this man , thou art not Caesar ’ s friend : every one that maketh himself a king [ f ] speaketh against Caesar .
ASV	John	19	13	When Pilate therefore heard these words , he brought Jesus out , and sat down on the judgment-seat at a place called The Pavement , but in Hebrew , Gabbatha .
ASV	John	19	14	Now it was the Preparation of the passover : it was about the sixth hour . And he saith unto the Jews , Behold , your King !
ASV	John	19	15	They therefore cried out , Away with him , away with him , crucify him ! Pilate saith unto them , Shall I crucify your King ? The chief priests answered , We have no king but Caesar .
ASV	John	19	16	Then therefore he delivered him unto them to be crucified .
ASV	John	19	17	They took Jesus therefore : and he went out , bearing the cross for himself , unto the place called The place of a skull , which is called in Hebrew Golgotha :
ASV	John	19	18	where they crucified him , and with him two others , on either side one , and Jesus in the midst .
ASV	John	19	20	This title therefore read many of the Jews , [ g ] for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city ; and it was written in Hebrew , and in Latin , and in Greek .
ASV	John	19	21	The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate , Write not , The King of the Jews ; but , that he said , I am King of the Jews .
ASV	John	19	22	Pilate answered , What I have written I have written .
ASV	John	19	23	The soldiers therefore , when they had crucified Jesus , took his garments and made four parts , to every soldier a part ; and also the [ h ] coat : now the [ i ] coat was without seam , woven from the top throughout .
ASV	John	19	24	They said therefore one to another , Let us not rend it , but cast lots for it , whose it shall be : that the scripture might be fulfilled , which saith , [ j ] They parted my garments among them , And upon my vesture did they cast lots .
ASV	John	19	25	These things therefore the soldiers did . But there were standing by the cross of Jesus his mother , and his mother ’ s sister , Mary the wife of Clopas , and Mary Magdalene .
ASV	John	19	26	When Jesus therefore saw his mother , and the disciple standing by whom he loved , he saith unto his mother , Woman , behold , thy son !
ASV	John	19	27	Then saith he to the disciple , Behold , thy mother ! And from that hour the disciple took her unto his own home .
ASV	John	19	28	After this Jesus , knowing that all things are now finished , [ k ] that the scripture might be accomplished , saith , I thirst .
ASV	John	19	29	There was set there a vessel full of vinegar : so they put a sponge full of the vinegar upon hyssop , and brought it to his mouth .
ASV	John	19	30	When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar , he said , It is finished : and he bowed his head , and gave up his spirit .
ASV	John	19	31	The Jews therefore , because it was the Preparation , that the bodies should not remain on the cross upon the sabbath ( for the day of that sabbath was a high day ) , asked of Pilate that their legs might be broken , and that they might be taken away .
ASV	John	19	32	The soldiers therefore came , and brake the legs of the first , and of the other that was crucified with him :
ASV	John	19	33	but when they came to Jesus , and saw that he was dead already , they brake not his legs :
ASV	John	19	34	howbeit one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side , and straightway there came out blood and water .
ASV	John	19	35	And he that hath seen hath borne witness , and his witness is true : and he knoweth that he saith true , that ye also may believe .
ASV	John	19	36	For these things came to pass , [ l ] that the scripture might be fulfilled , A bone of him shall not be [ m ] broken .
ASV	John	19	37	And again another scripture saith , [ n ] They shall look on him whom they pierced .
ASV	John	19	38	And after these things Joseph of Arimathaea , being a disciple of Jesus , but secretly for fear of the Jews , asked of Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus : and Pilate gave him leave . He came therefore , and took away his body .
ASV	John	19	39	And there came also Nicodemus , he who at the first came to him by night , bringing a [ o ] mixture of myrrh and aloes , about a hundred pounds .
ASV	John	19	40	So they took the body of Jesus , and bound it in linen cloths with the spices , as the custom of the Jews is to bury .
ASV	John	19	41	Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden ; and in the garden a new tomb wherein was never man yet laid .
ASV	John	19	42	There then because of the Jews ’ Preparation ( for the tomb was nigh at hand ) they laid Jesus .

ASV	John	20	20	And when he had said this , he showed unto them his hands and his side . The disciples therefore were glad , when they saw the Lord .
ASV	John	20	2	She runneth therefore , and cometh to Simon Peter , and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved , and saith unto them , They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb , and we know not where they have laid him .
ASV	John	20	3	Peter therefore went forth , and the other disciple , and they went toward the tomb .
ASV	John	20	4	And they ran both together : and the other disciple outran Peter , and came first to the tomb ;
ASV	John	20	5	and stooping and looking in , he seeth the linen cloths lying ; yet entered he not in .
ASV	John	20	6	Simon Peter therefore also cometh , following him , and entered into the tomb ; and he beholdeth the linen cloths lying ,
ASV	John	20	7	and the napkin , that was upon his head , not lying with the linen cloths , but rolled up in a place by itself .
ASV	John	20	8	Then entered in therefore the other disciple also , who came first to the tomb , and he saw , and believed .
ASV	John	20	9	For as yet they knew not the scripture , that he must rise again from the dead .
ASV	John	20	10	So the disciples went away again unto their own home .
ASV	John	20	11	But Mary was standing without at the tomb weeping : so , as she wept , she stooped and looked into the tomb ;
ASV	John	20	12	and she beholdeth two angels in white sitting , one at the head , and one at the feet , where the body of Jesus had lain .
ASV	John	20	13	And they say unto her , Woman , why weepest thou ? She saith unto them , Because they have taken away my Lord , and I know not where they have laid him .
ASV	John	20	14	When she had thus said , she turned herself back , and beholdeth Jesus standing , and knew not that it was Jesus .
ASV	John	20	15	Jesus saith unto her , Woman , why weepest thou ? whom seekest thou ? She , supposing him to be the gardener , saith unto him , Sir , if thou hast borne him hence , tell me where thou hast laid him , and I will take him away .
ASV	John	20	16	Jesus saith unto her , Mary . She turneth herself , and saith unto him in Hebrew , Rabboni ; which is to say , Teacher .
ASV	John	20	17	Jesus saith to her , [ a ] Touch me not ; for I am not yet ascended unto the Father : but go unto my brethren , and say to them , I ascend unto my Father and your Father , and my God and your God .
ASV	John	20	18	Mary Magdalene cometh and telleth the disciples , I have seen the Lord ; and that he had said these things unto her .
ASV	John	20	19	When therefore it was evening , on that day , the first day of the week , and when the doors were shut where the disciples were , for fear of the Jews , Jesus came and stood in the midst , and saith unto them , Peace be unto you .
ASV	John	20	21	Jesus therefore said to them again , Peace be unto you : as the Father hath sent me , even so send I you .
ASV	John	20	22	And when he had said this , he breathed on them , and saith unto them , Receive ye the Holy Spirit :
ASV	John	20	23	whose soever sins ye forgive , they are forgiven unto them ; whose soever sins ye retain , they are retained .
ASV	John	20	24	But Thomas , one of the twelve , called [ b ] Didymus , was not with them when Jesus came .
ASV	John	20	25	The other disciples therefore said unto him , We have seen the Lord . But he said unto them , Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails , and put my finger into the print of the nails , and put my hand into his side , I will not believe .
ASV	John	20	26	And after eight days again his disciples were within , and Thomas with them . Jesus cometh , the doors being shut , and stood in the midst , and said , Peace be unto you .
ASV	John	20	27	Then saith he to Thomas , Reach hither thy finger , and see my hands ; and reach hither thy hand , and put it into my side : and be not faithless , but believing .
ASV	John	20	28	Thomas answered and said unto him , My Lord and my God .
ASV	John	20	29	Jesus saith unto him , Because thou hast seen me , [ c ] thou hast believed : blessed are they that have not seen , and yet have believed .
ASV	John	20	30	Many other signs therefore did Jesus in the presence of the disciples , which are not written in this book :
ASV	John	20	31	but these are written , that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ , the Son of God ; and that believing ye may have life in his name . Footnotes - John 20:17 Or , Take not hold on me - John 20:24 That is , Twin . - John 20:29 Or , hast thou believed ?
ASV	John	21	21	Peter therefore seeing him saith to Jesus , Lord , [ t ] and what shall this man do ?
ASV	John	21	2	There were together Simon Peter , and Thomas called [ a ] Didymus , and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee , and the sons of Zebedee , and two other of his disciples .
ASV	John	21	3	Simon Peter saith unto them , I go a fishing . They say unto him , We also come with thee . They went forth , and entered into the boat ; and that night they took nothing .
ASV	John	21	4	But when day was now breaking , Jesus stood on the beach : yet the disciples knew not that it was Jesus .
ASV	John	21	5	Jesus therefore saith unto them , Children , have ye aught to eat ? They answered him , No .
ASV	John	21	6	And he said unto them , Cast the net on the right side of the boat , and ye shall find . They cast therefore , and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes .
ASV	John	21	7	That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter , It is the Lord . So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord , he girt his coat about him ( for he [ b ] was naked ) , and cast himself into the sea .
ASV	John	21	8	But the other disciples came in the little boat ( for they were not far from the land , but about two hundred cubits off ) , dragging the net full of fishes .
ASV	John	21	9	So when they got out upon the land , they see [ c ] a fire of coals there , and [ d ] fish laid thereon , and [ e ] bread .
ASV	John	21	10	Jesus saith unto them , Bring of the fish which ye have now taken .

ASV	John	21	12	Jesus saith unto them , Come and break your fast . And none of the disciples durst inquire of him , Who art thou ? knowing that it was the Lord .
ASV	John	21	13	Jesus cometh , and taketh the [ g ] bread , and giveth them , and the fish likewise .
ASV	John	21	14	This is now the third time that Jesus was manifested to the disciples , after that he was risen from the dead .
ASV	John	21	15	So when they had broken their fast , Jesus saith to Simon Peter , Simon , son of [ h ] John , [ i ] lovest thou me more than these ? He saith unto him , Yea , Lord ; thou knowest that I [ j ] love thee . He saith unto him , Feed my lambs .
ASV	John	21	16	He saith to him again a second time , Simon , son of [ k ] John , [ l ] lovest thou me ? He saith unto him , Yea , Lord ; thou knowest that I [ m ] love thee . He saith unto him , Tend my sheep .
ASV	John	21	17	He saith unto him the third time , Simon , son of [ n ] John , [ o ] lovest thou me ? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time , [ p ] Lovest thou me ? And he said unto him , Lord , thou knowest all things ; thou [ q ] knowest that I [ r ] love thee . Jesus saith unto him , Feed my sheep .
ASV	John	21	18	Verily , verily , I say unto thee , When thou wast young , thou girdedst thyself , and walkedst whither thou wouldest : but when thou shalt be old , thou shalt stretch forth thy hands , and another shall gird thee , and carry thee whither thou wouldest not .
ASV	John	21	19	Now this he spake , signifying by what manner of death he should glorify God . And when he had spoken this , he saith unto him , Follow me .
ASV	John	21	20	Peter , turning about , seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following ; who also leaned back on his breast at the supper , and said , Lord , who is he that [ s ] betrayeth thee ?
ASV	John	21	22	Jesus saith unto him , If I will that he tarry till I come , what is that to thee ? follow thou me .
ASV	John	21	23	This saying therefore went forth among the brethren , that that disciple should not die : yet Jesus said not unto him , that he should not die ; but , If I will that he tarry till I come , what is that to thee ?
ASV	John	21	24	This is the disciple that beareth witness of these things , and wrote these things : and we know that his witness is true .
ASV	John	21	25	And there are also many other things which Jesus did , the which if they should be written every one , I suppose that even the world itself would not contain the books that should be written .

ASV	Romans	1	3	concerning his Son , who was born of the seed of David according to the flesh ,
ASV	Romans	1	4	who was [ c ] declared to be the Son of God [ d ] with power , according to the spirit of holiness , by the resurrection [ e ] from the dead ; even Jesus Christ our Lord ,
ASV	Romans	1	5	through whom we received grace and apostleship , unto obedience [ f ] of faith among all the [ g ] nations , for his name ’ s sake ;
ASV	Romans	1	6	among whom are ye also , called to be Jesus Christ ’ s :
ASV	Romans	1	7	to all that are in Rome , beloved of God , called to be saints : Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
ASV	Romans	1	8	First , I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all , [ h ] that your faith is proclaimed throughout the whole world .
ASV	Romans	1	9	For God is my witness , whom I serve in my spirit in the [ i ] gospel of his Son , how unceasingly I make mention of you , always in my prayers
ASV	Romans	1	10	making request , if by any means now at length I may be prospered [ j ] by the will of God to come unto you .
ASV	Romans	1	11	For I long to see you , that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift , to the end ye may be established ;
ASV	Romans	1	12	that is , that I with you may be comforted [ k ] in you , each of us by the other ’ s faith , both yours and mine .
ASV	Romans	1	13	And I would not have you ignorant , brethren , that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you ( and was hindered hitherto ) , that I might have some fruit [ l ] in you also , even as [ m ] in the rest of the Gentiles .
ASV	Romans	1	14	I am debtor both to Greeks and to Barbarians , both to the wise and to the foolish .
ASV	Romans	1	15	So , as much as in me is , I am ready to [ n ] preach the gospel to you also that are in Rome .
ASV	Romans	1	16	For I am not ashamed of the [ o ] gospel : for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth ; to the Jew first , and also to the Greek .
ASV	Romans	1	17	For therein is revealed a righteousness of God from faith unto faith : as it is written , [ p ] But the righteous shall live [ q ] by faith .
ASV	Romans	1	18	For [ r ] the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men , who [ s ] hinder the truth in unrighteousness ;
ASV	Romans	1	19	because that which is known of God is manifest in them ; for God manifested it unto them .
ASV	Romans	1	20	For the invisible things of him since the creation of the world are clearly seen , being perceived through the things that are made , even his everlasting power and divinity ; [ t ] that they may be without excuse :
ASV	Romans	1	21	because that , knowing God , they glorified him not as God , neither gave thanks ; but became vain in their reasonings , and their senseless heart was darkened .
ASV	Romans	1	22	Professing themselves to be wise , they became fools ,
ASV	Romans	1	23	and changed the glory of the incorruptible God for the likeness of an image of corruptible man , and of birds , and four-footed beasts , and creeping things .
ASV	Romans	1	24	Wherefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts unto uncleanness , that their bodies should be dishonored among themselves :
ASV	Romans	1	25	for that they exchanged the truth of God for a lie , and worshipped and served the creature rather than the Creator , who is blessed [ u ] for ever . Amen .
ASV	Romans	1	26	For this cause God gave them up unto [ v ] vile passions : for their women changed the natural use into that which is against nature :
ASV	Romans	1	27	and likewise also the men , leaving the natural use of the woman , burned in their lust one toward another , men with men working unseemliness , and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was due .
ASV	Romans	1	28	And even as they [ w ] refused to have God in their knowledge , God gave them up unto a reprobate mind , to do those things which are not fitting ;
ASV	Romans	1	29	being filled with all unrighteousness , wickedness , covetousness , maliciousness ; full of envy , murder , strife , deceit , malignity ; whisperers ,
ASV	Romans	1	30	backbiters , [ x ] hateful to God , insolent , haughty , boastful , inventors of evil things , disobedient to parents ,
ASV	Romans	1	31	without understanding , covenant-breakers , without natural affection , unmerciful :
ASV	Romans	1	32	who , knowing the ordinance of God , that they that practise such things are worthy of death , not only do the same , but also consent with them that practise them .

ASV	Romans	2	3	And reckonest thou this , O man , who judgest them that practise such things , and doest the same , that thou shalt escape the judgment of God ?
ASV	Romans	2	4	Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering , not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance ?
ASV	Romans	2	5	but after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up for thyself wrath in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God ;
ASV	Romans	2	6	who will render to every man according to his works :
ASV	Romans	2	7	to them that by [ c ] patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and incorruption , eternal life :
ASV	Romans	2	8	but unto them that are factious , and obey not the truth , but obey unrighteousness , shall be wrath and indignation ,
ASV	Romans	2	9	tribulation and anguish , upon every soul of man that worketh evil , of the Jew first , and also of the Greek ;
ASV	Romans	2	10	but glory and honor and peace to every man that worketh good , to the Jew first , and also to the Greek :
ASV	Romans	2	11	for there is no respect of persons with God .
ASV	Romans	2	12	For as many as [ d ] have sinned without the law shall also perish without the law : and as many as [ e ] have sinned under the law shall be judged by the law ;
ASV	Romans	2	13	for not the hearers of the law are [ f ] just before God , but the doers of the law shall be [ g ] justified ;
ASV	Romans	2	14	( for when Gentiles that have not the law do by nature the things of the law , these , not having the law , are the law unto themselves ;
ASV	Romans	2	15	in that they show the work of the law written in their hearts , their conscience bearing witness therewith , and [ h ] their [ i ] thoughts one with another accusing or else excusing them ) ;
ASV	Romans	2	16	in the day when God [ j ] shall judge the secrets of men , according to my [ k ] gospel , by Jesus Christ .
ASV	Romans	2	17	But if thou bearest the name of a Jew , and restest upon the law , and gloriest in God ,
ASV	Romans	2	18	and knowest [ l ] his will , and [ m ] approvest the things that are excellent , being instructed out of the law ,
ASV	Romans	2	19	and art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind , a light of them that are in darkness ,
ASV	Romans	2	20	[ n ] a corrector of the foolish , a teacher of babes , having in the law the form of knowledge and of the truth ;
ASV	Romans	2	21	thou therefore that teachest another , teachest thou not thyself ? thou that preachest a man should not steal , dost thou steal ?
ASV	Romans	2	22	thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery , dost thou commit adultery ? thou that abhorrest idols , dost thou rob temples ?
ASV	Romans	2	23	thou who gloriest in the law , through thy transgression of the law dishonorest thou God ?
ASV	Romans	2	24	For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you , [ o ] even as it is written .
ASV	Romans	2	25	For circumcision indeed profiteth , if thou be a doer of the law : but if thou be a transgressor of the law , thy circumcision is become uncircumcision .
ASV	Romans	2	26	If therefore the uncircumcision keep the ordinances of the law , shall not his uncircumcision be reckoned for circumcision ?
ASV	Romans	2	27	and shall not the uncircumcision which is by nature , if it fulfil the law , judge thee , who with the letter and circumcision art a transgressor of the law ?
ASV	Romans	2	28	For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly ; neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh :
ASV	Romans	2	29	but he is a Jew who is one inwardly ; and circumcision is that of the heart , in the spirit not in the letter ; whose praise is not of men , but of God .

ASV	Romans	3	3	For what if some were without faith ? shall their want of faith make of none effect the faithfulness of God ?
ASV	Romans	3	2	Much every way : first of all , that they were intrusted with the oracles of God .
ASV	Romans	3	4	[ a ] God forbid : yea , let God be found true , but every man a liar ; as it is written , [ b ] That thou mightest be justified in thy words , And mightest prevail when thou comest into judgment .
ASV	Romans	3	5	But if our unrighteousness commendeth the righteousness of God , what shall we say ? Is God unrighteous who visiteth with wrath ? ( I speak after the manner of men . )
ASV	Romans	3	6	[ c ] God forbid : for then how shall God judge the world ?
ASV	Romans	3	7	[ d ] But if the truth of God through my lie abounded unto his glory , why am I also still judged as a sinner ?
ASV	Romans	3	8	and why not ( as we are slanderously reported , and as some affirm that we say ) , Let us do evil , that good may come ? whose condemnation is just .
ASV	Romans	3	9	What then ? are we better than they ? No , in no wise : for we before laid to the charge both of Jews and Greeks , that they are all under sin ;
ASV	Romans	3	10	as it is written , [ e ] There is none righteous , no , not one ;
ASV	Romans	3	11	There is none that understandeth , There is none that seeketh after God ;
ASV	Romans	3	12	They have all turned aside , they are together become unprofitable ; There is none that doeth good , no , not so much as one :
ASV	Romans	3	13	[ f ] Their throat is an open sepulchre ; With their tongues they have used deceit : [ g ] The poison of asps is under their lips :
ASV	Romans	3	14	[ h ] Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness :
ASV	Romans	3	15	[ i ] Their feet are swift to shed blood ;
ASV	Romans	3	16	Destruction and misery are in their ways ;
ASV	Romans	3	17	And the way of peace have they not known :
ASV	Romans	3	18	[ j ] There is no fear of God before their eyes .
ASV	Romans	3	19	Now we know that what things soever the law saith , it speaketh to them that are under the law ; that every mouth may be stopped , and all the world may be brought under the judgment of God :
ASV	Romans	3	20	because [ k ] by [ l ] the works of the law shall no flesh be [ m ] justified in his sight ; for [ n ] through the law cometh the knowledge of sin .
ASV	Romans	3	21	But now apart from the law a righteousness of God hath been manifested , being witnessed by the law and the prophets ;
ASV	Romans	3	22	even the righteousness of God through faith [ o ] in Jesus Christ unto all [ p ] them that believe ; for there is no distinction ;
ASV	Romans	3	23	for all [ q ] have sinned , and fall short of the glory of God ;
ASV	Romans	3	24	being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus :
ASV	Romans	3	25	whom God set forth [ r ] to be a propitiation , through faith , in his blood , to show his righteousness because of the passing over of the sins done aforetime , in the forbearance of God ;
ASV	Romans	3	26	for the showing , I say , of his righteousness at this present season : that he might himself be [ s ] just , and the [ t ] justifier of him that [ u ] hath faith [ v ] in Jesus .
ASV	Romans	3	27	Where then is the glorying ? It is excluded . By what manner of law ? of works ? Nay : but by a law of faith .
ASV	Romans	3	28	[ w ] We reckon therefore that a man is justified by faith apart from [ x ] the works of the law .
ASV	Romans	3	29	Or is God the God of Jews only ? is he not the God of Gentiles also ? Yea , of Gentiles also :

ASV	Romans	4	4	Now to him that worketh , the reward is not reckoned as of grace , but as of debt .
ASV	Romans	4	2	For if Abraham was justified [ c ] by works , he hath whereof to glory ; but not toward God .
ASV	Romans	4	3	For what saith the scripture ? [ d ] And Abraham believed God , and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness .
ASV	Romans	4	5	But to him that worketh not , but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly , his faith is reckoned for righteousness .
ASV	Romans	4	6	Even as David also pronounceth blessing upon the man , unto whom God reckoneth righteousness apart from works ,
ASV	Romans	4	7	saying , [ e ] Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven , And whose sins are covered .
ASV	Romans	4	8	Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not reckon sin .
ASV	Romans	4	9	Is this blessing then pronounced upon the circumcision , or upon the uncircumcision also ? for we say , To Abraham his faith was reckoned for righteousness .
ASV	Romans	4	10	How then was it reckoned ? when he was in circumcision , or in uncircumcision ? Not in circumcision , but in uncircumcision :
ASV	Romans	4	11	and he received the sign of circumcision , a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while he was in uncircumcision : that he might be the father of all them that believe , though they be in uncircumcision , that righteousness might be reckoned unto them ;
ASV	Romans	4	12	and the father of circumcision to them who not only are of the circumcision , but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham which he had in uncircumcision .
ASV	Romans	4	13	For not [ f ] through the law was the promise to Abraham or to his seed that he should be heir of the world , but through the righteousness of faith .
ASV	Romans	4	14	For if they that are of the law are heirs , faith is made void , and the promise is made of none effect :
ASV	Romans	4	15	for the law worketh wrath ; but where there is no law , neither is there transgression .
ASV	Romans	4	16	For this cause it is of faith , that it may be according to grace ; to the end that the promise may be sure to all the seed ; not to that only which is of the law , but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham , who is the father of us all
ASV	Romans	4	17	( as it is written , [ g ] A father of many nations have I made thee ) before him whom he believed , even God , who giveth life to the dead , and calleth the things that are not , as though they were .
ASV	Romans	4	18	Who in hope believed against hope , to the end that he might become a father of many nations , according to that which had been spoken , [ h ] So shall thy seed be .
ASV	Romans	4	19	And without being weakened in faith he considered his own body [ i ] now as good as dead ( he being about a hundred years old ) , and the deadness of Sarah ’ s [ j ] womb ;
ASV	Romans	4	20	yet , looking unto the promise of God , he wavered not through unbelief , but waxed strong through faith , giving glory to God ,
ASV	Romans	4	21	and being fully assured that what he had promised , he was able also to perform .
ASV	Romans	4	22	Wherefore also it was reckoned unto him for righteousness .
ASV	Romans	4	23	Now it was not written for his sake alone , that it was reckoned unto him ;
ASV	Romans	4	24	but for our sake also , unto whom it shall be reckoned , who believe on him that raised Jesus our Lord from the dead ,
ASV	Romans	4	25	who was delivered up for our trespasses , and was raised for our justification .

ASV	Romans	5	4	and stedfastness , approvedness ; and approvedness , hope :
ASV	Romans	5	6	For while we were yet weak , in due season Christ died for the ungodly .
ASV	Romans	5	7	For scarcely for a righteous man will one die : for peradventure for the good man some one would even dare to die .
ASV	Romans	5	8	But God commendeth his own love toward us , in that , while we were yet sinners , Christ died for us .
ASV	Romans	5	9	Much more then , being now justified [ i ] by his blood , shall we be saved from the wrath of God through him .
ASV	Romans	5	10	For if , while we were enemies , we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son , much more , being reconciled , shall we be saved [ j ] by his life ;

ASV	Romans	5	12	Therefore , as through one man sin entered into the world , and death through sin ; and so death passed unto all men , for that all sinned : —
ASV	Romans	5	13	for until the law sin was in the world ; but sin is not imputed when there is no law .
ASV	Romans	5	14	Nevertheless death reigned from Adam until Moses , even over them that had not sinned after the likeness of Adam ’ s transgression , who is a figure of him that was to come .
ASV	Romans	5	15	But not as the trespass , so also is the free gift . For if by the trespass of the one the many died , much more did the grace of God , and the gift by the grace of the one man , Jesus Christ , abound unto the many .
ASV	Romans	5	16	And not as through one that sinned , so is the gift : for the judgment came of one unto condemnation , but the free gift came of many trespasses unto [ l ] justification .
ASV	Romans	5	17	For if , by the trespass of the one , death reigned through the one ; much more shall they that receive the abundance of grace and [ m ] of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one , even Jesus Christ .
ASV	Romans	5	18	So then as through one trespass the judgment came unto all men to condemnation ; even so through one act of righteousness the free gift came unto all men to justification of life .
ASV	Romans	5	19	For as through the one man ’ s disobedience the many were made sinners , even so through the obedience of the one shall the many be made righteous .
ASV	Romans	5	20	And [ n ] the law came in besides , that the trespass might abound ; but where sin abounded , grace did abound more exceedingly :
ASV	Romans	5	21	that , as sin reigned in death , even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord .

ASV	Romans	6	4	We were buried therefore with him through baptism into death : that like as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father , so we also might walk in newness of life .
ASV	Romans	6	5	For if we have become [ a ] united with him in the likeness of his death , we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection ;
ASV	Romans	6	7	for he that hath died is [ b ] justified from sin .
ASV	Romans	6	8	But if we died with Christ , we believe that we shall also live with him ;
ASV	Romans	6	9	knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more ; death no more hath dominion over him .
ASV	Romans	6	10	For [ c ] the death that he died , he died unto sin [ d ] once : but [ e ] the life that he liveth , he liveth unto God .
ASV	Romans	6	11	Even so reckon ye also yourselves to be dead unto sin , but alive unto God in Christ Jesus .
ASV	Romans	6	12	Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body , that ye should obey the lusts thereof :
ASV	Romans	6	13	neither present your members unto sin as [ f ] instruments of unrighteousness ; but present yourselves unto God , as alive from the dead , and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God .
ASV	Romans	6	14	For sin shall not have dominion over you : for ye are not under law , but under grace .
ASV	Romans	6	15	What then ? shall we sin , because we are not under law , but under grace ? God forbid .
ASV	Romans	6	16	Know ye not , that to whom ye present yourselves as [ g ] servants unto obedience , his [ h ] servants ye are whom ye obey ; whether of sin unto death , or of obedience unto righteousness ?
ASV	Romans	6	17	But thanks be to God , [ i ] that , whereas ye were [ j ] servants of sin , ye became obedient from the heart to that [ k ] form of teaching whereunto ye were delivered ;
ASV	Romans	6	18	and being made free from sin , ye became [ l ] servants of righteousness .
ASV	Romans	6	19	I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh : for as ye presented your members as servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity , even so now present your members as servants to righteousness unto sanctification .
ASV	Romans	6	20	For when ye were [ m ] servants of sin , ye were free in regard of righteousness .
ASV	Romans	6	21	What fruit then had ye at that time in the things whereof ye are now ashamed ? for the end of those things is death .
ASV	Romans	6	22	But now being made free from sin and become servants to God , ye have your fruit unto sanctification , and the end eternal life .

ASV	Romans	7	7	What shall we say then ? Is the law sin ? God forbid . Howbeit , I had not known sin , except through [ c ] the law : for I had not known [ d ] coveting , except the law had said , [ e ] Thou shalt not [ f ] covet :
ASV	Romans	7	2	For the woman that hath a husband is bound by law to the husband while he liveth ; but if the husband die , she is discharged from the law of the husband .
ASV	Romans	7	3	So then if , while the husband liveth , she be joined to another man , she shall be called an adulteress : but if the husband die , she is free from the law , so that she is no adulteress , though she be joined to another man .
ASV	Romans	7	4	Wherefore , my brethren , ye also were made dead to the law through the body of Christ ; that ye should be joined to another , even to him who was raised from the dead , that we might bring forth fruit unto God .
ASV	Romans	7	5	For when we were in the flesh , the [ b ] sinful passions , which were through the law , wrought in our members to bring forth fruit unto death .
ASV	Romans	7	6	But now we have been discharged from the law , having died to that wherein we were held ; so that we serve in newness of the spirit , and not in oldness of the letter .
ASV	Romans	7	8	but sin , finding occasion , wrought in me through the commandment all manner of [ g ] coveting : for apart from [ h ] the law sin is dead .
ASV	Romans	7	9	And I was alive apart from [ i ] the law once : but when the commandment came , sin revived , and I died ;
ASV	Romans	7	10	and the commandment , which was unto life , this I found to be unto death :
ASV	Romans	7	11	for sin , finding occasion , through the commandment beguiled me , and through it slew me .
ASV	Romans	7	12	,
ASV	Romans	7	13	Did then that which is good become death unto me ? God forbid . But sin , that it might be shown to be sin , by working death to me through that which is good ; —that through the commandment sin might become exceeding sinful .

ASV	Romans	7	16	But if what I would not , that I do , I consent unto the law that it is good .
ASV	Romans	7	17	So now it is no more I that [ k ] do it , but sin which dwelleth in me .

ASV	Romans	8	8	and they that are in the flesh can not please God .
ASV	Romans	8	2	For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus made me free from the law of sin and of death .
ASV	Romans	8	3	For what the law could not do , [ a ] in that it was weak through the flesh , God , sending his own Son in the likeness of [ b ] sinful flesh [ c ] and for sin , condemned sin in the flesh :
ASV	Romans	8	4	that the [ d ] ordinance of the law might be fulfilled in us , who walk not after the flesh , but after the Spirit .
ASV	Romans	8	5	For they that are after the flesh mind the things of the flesh ; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit .
ASV	Romans	8	6	For the mind of the flesh is death ; but the mind of the Spirit is life and peace :
ASV	Romans	8	7	because the mind of the flesh is enmity against God ; for it is not subject to the law of God , neither indeed can it be :
ASV	Romans	8	9	But ye are not in the flesh but in the Spirit , if so be that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you . But if any man hath not the Spirit of Christ , he is none of his .
ASV	Romans	8	10	And if Christ is in you , the body is dead because of sin ; but the spirit is life because of righteousness .
ASV	Romans	8	11	But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwelleth in you , he that raised up Christ Jesus from the dead shall give life also to your mortal bodies [ e ] through his Spirit that dwelleth in you .
ASV	Romans	8	12	So then , brethren , we are debtors , not to the flesh , to live after the flesh :
ASV	Romans	8	13	for if ye live after the flesh , ye must die ; but if by the Spirit ye put to death the [ f ] deeds of the body , ye shall live .
ASV	Romans	8	14	For as many as are led by the Spirit of God , these are sons of God .
ASV	Romans	8	15	For ye received not the spirit of bondage again unto fear ; but ye received the spirit of adoption , whereby we cry , Abba , Father .
ASV	Romans	8	16	The Spirit himself beareth witness with our spirit , that we are children of God :
ASV	Romans	8	17	and if children , then heirs ; heirs of God , and joint-heirs with Christ ; if so be that we suffer with him , that we may be also glorified with him .
ASV	Romans	8	18	For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed to us-ward .
ASV	Romans	8	19	For the earnest expectation of the creation waiteth for the revealing of the sons of God .
ASV	Romans	8	20	For the creation was subjected to vanity , not of its own will , but by reason of him who subjected it , [ g ] in hope
ASV	Romans	8	21	that the creation itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the children of God .
ASV	Romans	8	22	For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain [ h ] together until now .
ASV	Romans	8	23	And not only so , but ourselves also , who have the first-fruits of the Spirit , even we ourselves groan within ourselves , waiting for our adoption , to wit , the redemption of our body .
ASV	Romans	8	24	For [ i ] in hope were we saved : but hope that is seen is not hope : [ j ] for who [ k ] hopeth for that which he seeth ?
ASV	Romans	8	25	But if we hope for that which we see not , then do we with [ l ] patience wait for it .
ASV	Romans	8	26	And in like manner the Spirit also helpeth our infirmity : for we know not how to pray as we ought ; but the Spirit himself maketh intercession for us with groanings which can not be uttered ;
ASV	Romans	8	27	and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit , [ m ] because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God .
ASV	Romans	8	28	And we know that to them that love God [ n ] all things work together for good , even to them that are called according to his purpose .
ASV	Romans	8	29	For whom he foreknew , he also foreordained to be conformed to the image of his Son , that he might be the firstborn among many brethren :
ASV	Romans	8	30	and whom he foreordained , them he also called : and whom he called , them he also justified : and whom he justified , them he also glorified .
ASV	Romans	8	31	What then shall we say to these things ? If God is for us , who is against us ?
ASV	Romans	8	32	He that spared not his own Son , but delivered him up for us all , how shall he not also with him freely give us all things ?
ASV	Romans	8	33	Who shall lay anything to the charge of God ’ s elect ? [ o ] It is God that justifieth ;

ASV	Romans	9	8	That is , it is not the children of the flesh that are children of God ; but the children of the promise are reckoned for a seed .
ASV	Romans	9	10	And not only so ; but Rebecca also having conceived by one , even by our father Isaac—
ASV	Romans	9	11	for the children being not yet born , neither having done anything good or bad , that the purpose of God according to election might stand , not of works , but of him that calleth ,

ASV	Romans	9	14	What shall we say then ? Is there unrighteousness with God ? God forbid .
ASV	Romans	9	15	For he saith to Moses , [ h ] I will have mercy on whom I have mercy , and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion .
ASV	Romans	9	16	So then it is not of him that willeth , nor of him that runneth , but of God that hath mercy .
ASV	Romans	9	17	For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh , [ i ] For this very purpose did I raise thee up , that I might show in thee my power , and that my name might be published abroad in all the earth .
ASV	Romans	9	18	So then he hath mercy on whom he will , and whom he will he hardeneth .
ASV	Romans	9	19	Thou wilt say then unto me , Why doth he still find fault ? For who withstandeth his will ?
ASV	Romans	9	20	Nay but , O man , who art thou that repliest against God ? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it , Why didst thou make me thus ?

ASV	Romans	9	23	[ k ] and that he might make known the riches of his glory upon vessels of mercy , which he afore prepared unto glory ,
ASV	Romans	9	24	even us , whom he also called , not from the Jews only , but also from the Gentiles ?
ASV	Romans	9	25	As he saith also in Hosea , [ l ] I will call that my people , which was not my people ; And her beloved , that was not beloved .

ASV	Romans	9	29	And , as Isaiah hath said before , [ o ] Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed , We had become as Sodom , and had been made like unto Gomorrah .
ASV	Romans	9	30	What shall we say then ? That the Gentiles , who followed not after righteousness , attained to righteousness , even the righteousness which is of faith :
ASV	Romans	9	31	but Israel , following after a law of righteousness , did not arrive at that law .

ASV	Romans	10	10	for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness ; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation .
ASV	Romans	10	2	For I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God , but not according to knowledge .
ASV	Romans	10	3	For being ignorant of God ’ s righteousness , and seeking to establish their own , they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of God .
ASV	Romans	10	4	For Christ is the end of the law unto righteousness to every one that believeth .
ASV	Romans	10	5	For Moses writeth that [ b ] the man that doeth the righteousness which is of the law shall live thereby .
ASV	Romans	10	6	But the righteousness which is of faith saith thus , [ c ] Say not in thy heart , Who shall ascend into heaven ? ( that is , to bring Christ down : )
ASV	Romans	10	7	or , Who shall descend into the abyss ? ( that is , to bring Christ up from the dead . )
ASV	Romans	10	8	But what saith it ? [ d ] The word is nigh thee , in thy mouth , and in thy heart : that is , the word of faith , which we preach :
ASV	Romans	10	9	[ e ] because if thou shalt [ f ] confess with thy mouth Jesus as Lord , and shalt believe in thy heart that God raised him from the dead , thou shalt be saved :
ASV	Romans	10	11	For the scripture saith , [ g ] Whosoever believeth on him shall not be put to shame .
ASV	Romans	10	12	For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek : for the same Lord is Lord of all , and is rich unto all that call upon him :
ASV	Romans	10	13	for , [ h ] Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved .
ASV	Romans	10	14	How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed ? and how shall they believe in him whom they have not heard ? and how shall they hear without a preacher ?
ASV	Romans	10	15	and how shall they preach , except they be sent ? even as it is written , [ i ] How beautiful are the feet of them that bring [ j ] glad tidings of good things !
ASV	Romans	10	16	But they did not all hearken to the [ k ] glad tidings . For Isaiah saith , [ l ] Lord , who hath believed our report ?
ASV	Romans	10	17	So belief cometh of hearing , and hearing by the word of Christ .
ASV	Romans	10	18	But I say , Did they not hear ? Yea , verily ,
ASV	Romans	10	19	But I say , Did Israel not know ? First Moses saith , [ o ] I will provoke you to jealousy with that which is no nation , With a nation void of understanding will I anger you .
ASV	Romans	10	20	And Isaiah is very bold , and saith , [ p ] I was found of them that sought me not ; I became manifest unto them that asked not of me .
ASV	Romans	10	21	But as to Israel he saith , [ q ] All the day long did I spread out my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people .

ASV	Romans	11	11	I say then , Did they stumble that they might fall ? God forbid : but by their [ f ] fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles , to provoke them to jealousy .
ASV	Romans	11	2	God did not cast off his people which he foreknew . Or know ye not what the scripture [ a ] saith [ b ] of Elijah ? how he pleadeth with God against Israel :
ASV	Romans	11	3	Lord , they have killed thy prophets , they have digged down thine altars ; and I am left alone , and they seek my life .
ASV	Romans	11	4	But what [ c ] saith the answer of God unto him ? I have left for myself seven thousand men , who have not bowed the knee to Baal .
ASV	Romans	11	5	Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace .
ASV	Romans	11	6	But if it is by grace , it is no more of works : otherwise grace is no more grace .
ASV	Romans	11	7	What then ? That which Israel seeketh for , that he obtained not ; but the election obtained it , and the rest were hardened :
ASV	Romans	11	8	according as it is written , [ d ] God gave them a spirit of stupor , eyes that they should not see , and ears that they should not hear , unto this very day .
ASV	Romans	11	9	And David saith , [ e ] Let their table be made a snare , and a trap , And a stumblingblock , and a recompense unto them :
ASV	Romans	11	10	Let their eyes be darkened , that they may not see , And bow thou down their back always .
ASV	Romans	11	12	Now if their fall is the riches of the world , and their loss the riches of the Gentiles ; how much more their fulness ?
ASV	Romans	11	13	But I speak to you that are Gentiles . Inasmuch then as I am an apostle of Gentiles , I glorify my ministry ;
ASV	Romans	11	14	if by any means I may provoke to jealousy them that are my flesh , and may save some of them .
ASV	Romans	11	15	For if the casting away of them is the reconciling of the world , what shall the receiving of them be , but life from the dead ?

ASV	Romans	11	17	But if some of the branches were broken off , and thou , being a wild olive , wast grafted in among them , and didst become partaker with them [ g ] of the root of the fatness of the olive tree ;
ASV	Romans	11	18	glory not over the branches : but if thou gloriest , it is not thou that bearest the root , but the root thee .
ASV	Romans	11	19	Thou wilt say then , Branches were broken off , that I might be grafted in .
ASV	Romans	11	20	Well ; by their unbelief they were broken off , and thou standest by thy faith . Be not highminded , but fear :
ASV	Romans	11	21	for if God spared not the natural branches , neither will he spare thee .
ASV	Romans	11	22	Behold then the goodness and severity of God : toward them that fell , severity ; but toward thee , God ’ s goodness , if thou continue in his goodness : otherwise thou also shalt be cut off .
ASV	Romans	11	23	And they also , if they continue not in their unbelief , shall be grafted in : for God is able to graft them in again .
ASV	Romans	11	24	For if thou wast cut out of that which is by nature a wild olive tree , and wast grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree ; how much more shall these , which are the natural branches , be grafted into their own olive tree ?
ASV	Romans	11	25	For I would not , brethren , have you ignorant of this mystery , lest ye be wise in your own conceits , that a hardening in part hath befallen Israel , until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in ;
ASV	Romans	11	26	and so all Israel shall be saved : even as it is written , [ h ] There shall come out of Zion the Deliverer ; He shall turn away [ i ] ungodliness from Jacob :
ASV	Romans	11	27	[ j ] And this is [ k ] my covenant unto them , When I shall take away their sins .
ASV	Romans	11	28	As touching the [ l ] gospel , they are enemies for your sake : but as touching the election , they are beloved for the fathers ’ sake .
ASV	Romans	11	29	For the gifts and the calling of God are not repented of .
ASV	Romans	11	30	For as ye in time past were disobedient to God , but now have obtained mercy by their disobedience ,
ASV	Romans	11	31	even so have these also now been disobedient , that by the mercy shown to you they also may now obtain mercy .
ASV	Romans	11	32	For God hath shut up all unto disobedience , that he might have mercy upon all .
ASV	Romans	11	33	O the depth [ m ] of the riches [ n ] both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God ! how unsearchable are his judgments , and his ways past tracing out !
ASV	Romans	11	34	For who hath known the mind of the Lord ? or who hath been his counsellor ?
ASV	Romans	11	35	or who hath first given to him , and it shall be recompensed unto him again ?
ASV	Romans	11	36	For of him , and through him , and unto him , are all things . To him be the glory [ o ] for ever . Amen . Footnotes - Romans 11:2

ASV	Romans	12	3	For I say , through the grace that was given me , to every man that is among you , not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think ; but so to think as to think soberly , according as God hath dealt to each man a measure of faith .
ASV	Romans	12	4	For even as we have many members in one body , and all the members have not the same office :
ASV	Romans	12	5	so we , who are many , are one body in Christ , and severally members one of another .
ASV	Romans	12	6	And having gifts differing according to the grace that was given to us , whether prophecy , let us prophesy according to the proportion of our faith ;

ASV	Romans	13	2	Therefore he that resisteth the power , withstandeth the ordinance of God : and they that withstand shall receive to themselves judgment .
ASV	Romans	13	3	For rulers are not a terror to the good work , but to the evil . And wouldest thou have no fear of the power ? do that which is good , and thou shalt have praise from the same :
ASV	Romans	13	4	for [ a ] he is a minister of God to thee for good . But if thou do that which is evil , be afraid ; for [ b ] he beareth not the sword in vain : for [ c ] he is a minister of God , an avenger for wrath to him that doeth evil .
ASV	Romans	13	5	Wherefore ye must needs be in subjection , not only because of the wrath , but also for conscience ’ sake .
ASV	Romans	13	6	For for this cause ye pay tribute also ; for they are ministers of God ’ s service , attending continually upon this very thing .
ASV	Romans	13	7	Render to all their dues : tribute to whom tribute is due ; custom to whom custom ; fear to whom fear ; honor to whom honor .
ASV	Romans	13	8	Owe no man anything , save to love one another : for he that loveth [ d ] his neighbor hath fulfilled the law .
ASV	Romans	13	9	For this , [ e ] Thou shalt not commit adultery , Thou shalt not kill , Thou shalt not steal , Thou shalt not covet , and if there be any other commandment , it is summed up in this word , namely , Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself .
ASV	Romans	13	10	Love worketh no ill to his neighbor : love therefore is the fulfilment of the law .
ASV	Romans	13	11	And this , knowing the season , that already it is time for you to awake out of sleep : for now is [ f ] salvation nearer to us than when we first believed .
ASV	Romans	13	12	The night is far spent , and the day is at hand : let us therefore cast off the works of darkness , and let us put on the armor of light .

ASV	Romans	14	14	I know , and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus , that nothing is unclean of itself : save that to him who accounteth anything to be unclean , to him it is unclean .

ASV	Romans	14	3	Let not him that eateth set at nought him that eateth not ; and let not him that eateth not judge him that eateth : for God hath received him .
ASV	Romans	14	4	Who art thou that judgest the [ b ] servant of another ? to his own lord he standeth or falleth . Yea , he shall be made to stand ; for the Lord hath power to make him stand .
ASV	Romans	14	5	One man esteemeth one day above another : another esteemeth every day alike . Let each man be fully assured in his own mind .
ASV	Romans	14	6	He that regardeth the day , regardeth it unto the Lord : and he that eateth , eateth unto the Lord , for he giveth God thanks ; and he that eateth not , unto the Lord he eateth not , and giveth God thanks .
ASV	Romans	14	7	For none of us liveth to himself , and none dieth to himself .
ASV	Romans	14	8	For whether we live , we live unto the Lord ; or whether we die , we die unto the Lord : whether we live therefore , or die , we are the Lord ’ s .
ASV	Romans	14	9	For to this end Christ died and lived again , that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living .
ASV	Romans	14	10	But thou , why dost thou judge thy brother ? or thou again , why dost thou set at nought thy brother ? for we shall all stand before the judgment-seat of God .
ASV	Romans	14	11	For it is written ,
ASV	Romans	14	12	So then each one of us shall give account of himself to God .
ASV	Romans	14	13	Let us not therefore judge one another any more : but judge ye this rather , that no man put a stumblingblock in his brother ’ s way , or an occasion of falling .
ASV	Romans	14	15	For if because of meat thy brother is grieved , thou walkest no longer in love . Destroy not with thy meat him for whom Christ died .
ASV	Romans	14	16	Let not then your good be evil spoken of :
ASV	Romans	14	17	for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking , but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit .
ASV	Romans	14	18	For he that herein serveth Christ is well-pleasing to God , and approved of men .
ASV	Romans	14	19	So then [ e ] let us follow after things which make for peace , and things whereby we may edify one another .
ASV	Romans	14	20	Overthrow not for meat ’ s sake the work of God . All things indeed are clean ; howbeit it is evil for that man who eateth with offence .
ASV	Romans	14	21	It is good not to eat flesh , nor to drink wine , nor to do anything whereby thy brother stumbleth [ f ] .
ASV	Romans	14	22	The faith which thou hast , have thou to thyself before God . Happy is he that judgeth not himself in that which he [ g ] approveth .
ASV	Romans	14	23	But he that doubteth is condemned if he eat , because he eateth not of faith ; and whatsoever is not of faith is sin .

ASV	Romans	15	15	But I write the more boldly unto you in some measure , as putting you again in remembrance , because of the grace that was given me of God ,
ASV	Romans	15	2	Cor . 5:9 ;
ASV	Romans	15	3	For Christ also pleased not himself ; but , as it is written , [ a ] The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell upon me .
ASV	Romans	15	4	For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning , that through [ b ] patience and through comfort of the scriptures we might have hope .
ASV	Romans	15	5	Now the God of [ c ] patience and of comfort grant you to be of the same mind one with another according to Christ Jesus :
ASV	Romans	15	6	that with one accord ye may with one mouth glorify [ d ] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ .
ASV	Romans	15	7	Wherefore receive ye one another , even as Christ also received [ e ] you , to the glory of God .
ASV	Romans	15	8	For I say that Christ hath been made a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God , that he might confirm the promises given unto the fathers ,
ASV	Romans	15	9	and that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy ; as it is written ,
ASV	Romans	15	10	And again he saith ,
ASV	Romans	15	11	And again ,
ASV	Romans	15	12	And again , Isaiah saith , [ m ] There shall be the root of Jesse , And he that ariseth to rule over the [ n ] Gentiles ; On him shall the [ o ] Gentiles hope .
ASV	Romans	15	13	Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing , that ye may abound in hope , in the power of the Holy Spirit .
ASV	Romans	15	14	And I myself also am persuaded of you , my brethren , that ye yourselves are full of goodness , filled with all knowledge , able also to admonish one another .
ASV	Romans	15	16	that I should be a minister of Christ Jesus unto the [ p ] Gentiles , [ q ] ministering the [ r ] gospel of God , that the offering up of the Gentiles might be made acceptable , being sanctified by the Holy Spirit .
ASV	Romans	15	17	I have therefore my glorying in Christ Jesus in things pertaining to God .
ASV	Romans	15	18	For I will not dare to speak of any [ s ] things save those which Christ wrought through me , for the obedience of the [ t ] Gentiles , by word and deed ,
ASV	Romans	15	19	in the power of signs and wonders , in the power of [ u ] the Holy Spirit ; so that from Jerusalem , and round about even unto Illyricum , I have [ v ] fully preached the [ w ] gospel of Christ ;
ASV	Romans	15	20	yea , [ x ] making it my aim so to [ y ] preach the gospel , not where Christ was already named , that I might not build upon another man ’ s foundation ;
ASV	Romans	15	21	but , as it is written , [ z ] They shall see , to whom no tidings of him came , And they who have not heard shall understand .
ASV	Romans	15	22	Wherefore also I was hindered these many times from coming to you :
ASV	Romans	15	23	but now , having no more any place in these regions , and having these many years a longing to come unto you ,
ASV	Romans	15	24	whensoever I go unto Spain ( for I hope to see you in my journey , and to be brought on my way thitherward by you , if first in some measure I shall have been satisfied with your company ) —
ASV	Romans	15	25	but now , I say , I go unto Jerusalem , ministering unto the saints .
ASV	Romans	15	26	For it hath been the good pleasure of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor among the saints that are at Jerusalem .
ASV	Romans	15	27	Yea , it hath been their good pleasure ; and their debtors they are . For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things , they owe it to them also to minister unto them in carnal things .
ASV	Romans	15	28	When therefore I have accomplished this , and have sealed to them this fruit , I will go on by you unto Spain .
ASV	Romans	15	29	And I know that , when I come unto you , I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of Christ .
ASV	Romans	15	30	Now I beseech you , brethren , by our Lord Jesus Christ , and by the love of the Spirit , that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me ;
ASV	Romans	15	31	that I may be delivered from them that are disobedient in Judaea , and that my ministration which I have for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints ;
ASV	Romans	15	32	that I may come unto you in joy through the will of God , and together with you find rest .

ASV	1%20Corinthians	1	1	Corinthians 1:31 Jer . 9:23f .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	1	2	unto the church of God which is at Corinth , even them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus , called to be saints , with all that call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place , their Lord and ours :
ASV	1%20Corinthians	1	3	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	1	4	I thank [ b ] my God always concerning you , for the grace of God which was given you in Christ Jesus ;
ASV	1%20Corinthians	1	5	that in everything ye were enriched in him , in all [ c ] utterance and all knowledge ;
ASV	1%20Corinthians	1	6	even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you :
ASV	1%20Corinthians	1	7	so that ye come behind in no gift ; waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ ;
ASV	1%20Corinthians	1	8	who shall also confirm you unto the end , that ye be unreproveable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	1	9	God is faithful , through whom ye were called into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	1	10	Now I beseech you , brethren , through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that ye all speak the same thing , and that there be no [ d ] divisions among you ; but that ye be perfected together in the same mind and in the same judgment .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	1	11	For it hath been signified unto me concerning you , my brethren , by them that are of the household of Chloe , that there are contentions among you .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	1	12	Now this I mean , that each one of you saith , I am of Paul ; and I of Apollos ; and I of Cephas ; and I of Christ .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	1	13	[ e ] Is Christ divided ? was Paul crucified for you ? or were ye baptized into the name of Paul ?
ASV	1%20Corinthians	1	14	[ f ] I thank God that I baptized none of you , save Crispus and Gaius ;
ASV	1%20Corinthians	1	15	lest any man should say that ye were baptized into my name .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	1	16	And I baptized also the household of Stephanas : besides , I know not whether I baptized any other .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	1	17	For Christ sent me not to baptize , but to [ g ] preach the gospel : not in wisdom of words , lest the cross of Christ should be made void .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	1	18	For the word of the cross is to them that [ h ] perish foolishness ; but unto us who [ i ] are saved it is the power of God .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	1	19	For it is written , [ j ] I will destroy the wisdom of the wise , And the discernment of the discerning will I bring to nought .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	1	20	Where is the wise ? where is the scribe ? where is the disputer of this [ k ] world ? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of the world ?
ASV	1%20Corinthians	1	21	For seeing that in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom knew not God , it was God ’ s good pleasure through the foolishness of the [ l ] preaching to save them that believe .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	1	22	Seeing that Jews ask for signs , and Greeks seek after wisdom :
ASV	1%20Corinthians	1	23	but we preach [ m ] Christ crucified , unto Jews a stumblingblock , and unto Gentiles foolishness ;
ASV	1%20Corinthians	1	24	but unto [ n ] them that are called , both Jews and Greeks , Christ the power of God , and the wisdom of God .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	1	25	Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men ; and the weakness of God is stronger than men .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	1	26	For [ o ] behold your calling , brethren , that not many wise after the flesh , not many mighty , not many noble , are called :
ASV	1%20Corinthians	1	27	but God chose the foolish things of the world , that he might put to shame them that are wise ; and God chose the weak things of the world , that he might put to shame the things that are strong ;
ASV	1%20Corinthians	1	28	and the base things of the world , and the things that are despised , did God choose , yea [ p ] and the things that are not , that he might bring to nought the things that are :
ASV	1%20Corinthians	1	29	that no flesh should glory before God .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	1	30	But of him are ye in Christ Jesus , who was made unto us wisdom from God , [ q ] and righteousness and sanctification , and redemption :
ASV	1%20Corinthians	1	31	that , according as it is written , [ r ] He that glorieth , let him glory in the Lord . Footnotes -
ASV	1%20Corinthians	2	1	Corinthians 2:15 Or , examined
ASV	1%20Corinthians	2	2	For I determined not to know anything among you , save Jesus Christ , and him crucified .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	2	3	And I was with you in weakness , and in fear , and in much trembling .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	2	4	And my [ c ] speech and my [ d ] preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom , but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power :
ASV	1%20Corinthians	2	5	that your faith should not [ e ] stand in the wisdom of men , but in the power of God .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	2	6	. -
ASV	1%20Corinthians	2	7	,
ASV	1%20Corinthians	2	8	; but not in verse
ASV	1%20Corinthians	2	9	but as it is written , [ j ] Things which eye saw not , and ear heard not , And which entered not into the heart of man , Whatsoever things God prepared for them that love him .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	2	10	[ k ] But unto us God revealed [ l ] them through the Spirit : for the Spirit searcheth all things , yea , the deep things of God .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	2	11	For who among men knoweth the things of a man , save the spirit of the man , which is in him ? even so the things of God none knoweth , save the Spirit of God .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	2	12	. -
ASV	1%20Corinthians	2	13	Which things also we speak , not in words which man ’ s wisdom teacheth , but which the Spirit teacheth ; [ n ] combining spiritual things with spiritual words .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	2	14	Now the [ o ] natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God : for they are foolishness unto him ; and he can not know them , because they are spiritually [ p ] judged .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	2	15	But he that is spiritual [ q ] judgeth all things , and he himself is [ r ] judged of no man .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	2	16	For who hath known the mind of the Lord , that he should instruct him ? But we have the mind of Christ . Footnotes -

ASV	1%20Corinthians	3	3	for ye are yet carnal : for whereas there is among you jealousy and strife , are ye not carnal , and do ye not walk after the manner of men ?
ASV	1%20Corinthians	3	2	I fed you with milk , not with meat ; for ye were not yet able to bear it : nay , not even now are ye able ;
ASV	1%20Corinthians	3	4	For when one saith , I am of Paul ; and another , I am of Apollos ; are ye not men ?
ASV	1%20Corinthians	3	5	What then is Apollos ? and what is Paul ? Ministers through whom ye believed ; and each as the Lord gave to him .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	3	6	I planted , Apollos watered ; but God gave the increase .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	3	7	So then neither is he that planteth anything , neither he that watereth ; but God that giveth the increase .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	3	8	Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one : but each shall receive his own reward according to his own labor .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	3	9	For we are God ’ s fellow-workers : ye are God ’ s [ a ] husbandry , God ’ s building .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	3	10	According to the grace of God which was given unto me , as a wise masterbuilder I laid a foundation ; and another buildeth thereon . But let each man take heed how he buildeth thereon .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	3	11	For other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid , which is Jesus Christ .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	3	12	But if any man buildeth on the foundation gold , silver , costly stones , wood , hay , stubble ;
ASV	1%20Corinthians	3	13	each man ’ s work shall be made manifest : for the day shall declare it , because it is revealed in fire ; [ b ] and the fire itself shall prove each man ’ s work of what sort it is .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	3	14	If any man ’ s work shall abide which he built thereon , he shall receive a reward .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	3	15	If any man ’ s work shall be burned , he shall suffer loss : but he himself shall be saved ; yet so as through fire .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	3	16	Know ye not that ye are a [ c ] temple of God , and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you ?
ASV	1%20Corinthians	3	17	If any man destroyeth the [ d ] temple of God , him shall God destroy ; for the [ e ] temple of God is holy , [ f ] and such are ye .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	3	18	Let no man deceive himself . If any man thinketh that he is wise among you in this [ g ] world , let him become a fool , that he may become wise .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	3	19	For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God . For it is written , [ h ] He that taketh the wise in their craftiness :
ASV	1%20Corinthians	3	20	and again , [ i ] The Lord knoweth the reasonings of the wise , that they are vain .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	3	21	Wherefore let no one glory in men . For all things are yours ;
ASV	1%20Corinthians	3	22	whether Paul , or Apollos , or Cephas , or the world , or life , or death , or things present , or things to come ; all are yours ;
ASV	1%20Corinthians	3	23	and ye are Christ ’ s ; and Christ is God ’ s . Footnotes -

ASV	1%20Corinthians	4	4	For I know nothing against myself ; yet am I not hereby justified : but he that [ d ] judgeth me is the Lord .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	4	2	Here , moreover , it is required in stewards , that a man be found faithful .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	4	3	But with me it is a very small thing that I should be [ a ] judged of you , or of man ’ s [ b ] judgment : yea , I [ c ] judge not mine own self .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	4	5	Wherefore judge nothing before the time , until the Lord come , who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness , and make manifest the counsels of the hearts ; and then shall each man have his praise from God .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	4	6	Now these things , brethren , I have in a figure transferred to myself and Apollos for your sakes ; that in us ye might learn not to go beyond the things which are written ; that no one of you be puffed up for the one against the other .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	4	7	For who maketh thee to differ ? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive ? but if thou didst receive it , why dost thou glory as if thou hadst not received it ?
ASV	1%20Corinthians	4	8	Already are ye filled , already ye are become rich , ye have come to reign without us : yea and I would that ye did reign , that we also might reign with you .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	4	9	For , I think , God hath set forth us the apostles last of all , as men doomed to death : for we are made a spectacle unto the world , [ e ] both to angels and men .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	4	10	We are fools for Christ ’ s sake , but ye are wise in Christ ; we are weak , but ye are strong ; ye have glory , but we have dishonor .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	4	11	Even unto this present hour we both hunger , and thirst , and are naked , and are buffeted , and have no certain dwelling-place ;
ASV	1%20Corinthians	4	12	and we toil , working with our own hands : being reviled , we bless ; being persecuted , we endure ;
ASV	1%20Corinthians	4	13	being defamed , we entreat : we are made as the [ f ] filth of the world , the offscouring of all things , even until now .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	4	14	I write not these things to shame you , but to admonish you as my beloved children .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	4	15	For though ye have ten thousand tutors in Christ , yet have ye not many fathers ; for in Christ Jesus I begat you through the [ g ] gospel .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	4	16	I beseech you therefore , be ye imitators of me .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	4	17	For this cause have I sent unto you Timothy , who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord , who shall put you in remembrance of my ways which are in Christ , even as I teach everywhere in every church .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	4	18	Now some are puffed up , as though I were not coming to you .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	4	19	But I will come to you shortly , if the Lord will ; and I will know , not the word of them that are puffed up , but the power .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	4	20	For the kingdom of God is not in word , but in power .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	4	21	What will ye ? shall I come unto you with a rod , or in love and a spirit of gentleness ? Footnotes -

ASV	1%20Corinthians	5	2	And [ a ] ye are puffed up , and [ b ] did not rather mourn , that he that had done this deed might be taken away from among you .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	5	3	For I verily , being absent in body but present in spirit , have already as though I were present judged him that hath so wrought this thing ,
ASV	1%20Corinthians	5	4	in the name of our Lord Jesus , ye being gathered together , and my spirit , with the power of our Lord Jesus ,
ASV	1%20Corinthians	5	6	Your glorying is not good . Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump ?
ASV	1%20Corinthians	5	7	Purge out the old leaven , that ye may be a new lump , even as ye are unleavened . For our passover also hath been sacrificed , even Christ :
ASV	1%20Corinthians	5	8	wherefore let us [ d ] keep the feast , not with old leaven , neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness , but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	5	9	I wrote unto you in my epistle to have no company with fornicators ;
ASV	1%20Corinthians	5	10	[ e ] not at all meaning with the fornicators of this world , or with the covetous and extortioners , or with idolaters ; for then must ye needs go out of the world :
ASV	1%20Corinthians	5	11	but [ f ] as it is , I wrote unto you not to keep company , if any man that is named a brother be a fornicator , or covetous , or an idolater , or a reviler , or a drunkard , or an extortioner ; with such a one no , not to eat .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	5	12	For what have I to do with judging them that are without ? Do not ye judge them that are within ?

ASV	1%20Corinthians	6	3	Know ye not that we shall judge angels ? how much more , things that pertain to this life ?
ASV	1%20Corinthians	6	4	If then ye have [ c ] to judge things pertaining to this life , [ d ] do ye set them to judge who are of no account in the church ?
ASV	1%20Corinthians	6	5	I say this to move you to shame . [ e ] What , can not there be found among you one wise man who shall be able to decide between his brethren ,
ASV	1%20Corinthians	6	7	Nay , already it is altogether [ f ] a defect in you , that ye have lawsuits one with another . Why not rather take wrong ? why not rather be defrauded ?
ASV	1%20Corinthians	6	8	Nay , but ye yourselves do wrong , and defraud , and that your brethren .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	6	9	Or know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God ? Be not deceived : neither fornicators , nor idolaters , nor adulterers , nor effeminate , nor abusers of themselves with men ,
ASV	1%20Corinthians	6	10	nor thieves , nor covetous , nor drunkards , nor revilers , nor extortioners , shall inherit the kingdom of God .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	6	11	And such were some of you : but ye [ g ] were washed , but ye were sanctified , but ye were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ , and in the Spirit of our God .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	6	12	All things are lawful for me ; but not all things are expedient . All things are lawful for me ; but I will not be brought under the power of any .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	6	13	Meats for the belly , and the belly for meats : but God shall bring to nought both it and them . But the body is not for fornication , but for the Lord ; and the Lord for the body :
ASV	1%20Corinthians	6	14	and God both raised the Lord , and will raise up us through his power .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	6	15	Know ye not that your bodies are members of Christ ? shall I then take away the members of Christ , and make them members of a harlot ? God forbid .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	6	16	Or know ye not that he that is joined to a harlot is one body ? for , [ h ] The twain , saith he , shall become one flesh .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	6	17	But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	6	18	Flee fornication . Every sin that a man doeth is without the body ; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	6	19	Or know ye not that your body is a [ i ] temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you , which ye have from God ? and ye are not your own ;
ASV	1%20Corinthians	6	20	for ye were bought with a price : glorify God therefore in your body . Footnotes -

ASV	1%20Corinthians	7	7	[ a ] Yet I would that all men were even as I myself . Howbeit each man hath his own gift from God , one after this manner , and another after that .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	7	2	But , because of fornications , let each man have his own wife , and let each woman have her own husband .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	7	3	Let the husband render unto the wife her due : and likewise also the wife unto the husband .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	7	4	The wife hath not power over her own body , but the husband : and likewise also the husband hath not power over his own body , but the wife .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	7	5	Defraud ye not one the other , except it be by consent for a season , that ye may give yourselves unto prayer , and may be together again , that Satan tempt you not because of your incontinency .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	7	6	But this I say by way of concession , not of commandment .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	7	8	But I say to the unmarried and to widows , It is good for them if they abide even as I .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	7	9	But if they have not continency , let them marry : for it is better to marry than to burn .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	7	10	But unto the married I give charge , yea not I , but the Lord , That the wife depart not from her husband
ASV	1%20Corinthians	7	11	( but should she depart , let her remain unmarried , or else be reconciled to her husband ) ; and that the husband leave not his wife .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	7	12	But to the rest say I , not the Lord : If any brother hath an unbelieving wife , and she is content to dwell with him , let him not leave her .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	7	13	And the woman that hath an unbelieving husband , and he is content to dwell with her , let her not leave her husband .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	7	14	For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife , and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the brother : else were your children unclean ; but now are they holy .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	7	15	Yet if the unbelieving departeth , let him depart : the brother or the sister is not under bondage in such cases : but God hath called [ b ] us in peace .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	7	16	For how knowest thou , O wife , whether thou shalt save thy husband ? or how knowest thou , O husband , whether thou shalt save thy wife ?
ASV	1%20Corinthians	7	17	Only , as the Lord hath distributed to each man , as God hath called each , so let him walk . And so ordain I in all the churches .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	7	18	Was any man called being circumcised ? let him not become uncircumcised . Hath any been called in uncircumcision ? let him not be circumcised .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	7	19	Circumcision is nothing , and uncircumcision is nothing ; but the keeping of the commandments of God .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	7	20	Let each man abide in that calling wherein he was called .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	7	21	Wast thou called being a bondservant ? care not for it : [ c ] nay , even if thou canst become free , use it rather .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	7	22	For he that was called in the Lord being a bondservant , is the Lord ’ s freedman : likewise he that was called being free , is Christ ’ s bondservant .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	7	23	Ye were bought with a price ; become not bondservants of men .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	7	24	Brethren , let each man , wherein he was called , therein abide with God .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	7	25	Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord : but I give my judgment , as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be trustworthy .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	7	26	I think therefore that this is good by reason of the distress that is upon us , namely , that it is good for a man [ d ] to be as he is .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	7	27	Art thou bound unto a wife ? seek not to be loosed . Art thou loosed from a wife ? seek not a wife .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	7	28	But shouldest thou marry , thou hast not sinned ; and if a virgin marry , she hath not sinned . Yet such shall have tribulation in the flesh : and I would spare you .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	7	29	But this I say , brethren , the time [ e ] is shortened , that henceforth both those that have wives may be as though they had none ;
ASV	1%20Corinthians	7	30	and those that weep , as though they wept not ; and those that rejoice , as though they rejoiced not ; and those that buy , as though they possessed not ;
ASV	1%20Corinthians	7	31	and those that use the world , as not using it to the full : for the fashion of this world passeth away .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	7	32	But I would have you to be free from cares . He that is unmarried is careful for the things of the Lord , how he may please the Lord :
ASV	1%20Corinthians	7	33	but he that is married is careful for the things of the world , how he may please his [ f ] wife ,
ASV	1%20Corinthians	7	34	and is divided . So also the woman that is unmarried and the virgin is careful for the things of the Lord , that she may be holy both in body and in spirit : but she that is married is careful for the things of the world , how she may please her husband .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	7	35	And this I say for your own profit ; not that I may cast a [ g ] snare upon you , but for that which is seemly , and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	7	36	But if any man thinketh that he behaveth himself unseemly toward his [ h ] virgin daughter , if she be past the flower of her age , and if need so requireth , let him do what he will ; he sinneth not ; let them marry .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	7	37	But he that standeth stedfast in his heart , having no necessity , but hath power as touching his own will , and hath determined this in his own heart , to keep his own [ i ] virgin daughter , shall do well .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	7	38	So then both he that giveth his own [ j ] virgin daughter in marriage doeth well ; and he that giveth her not in marriage shall do better .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	7	39	A wife is bound for so long time as her husband liveth ; but if the husband be [ k ] dead , she is free to be married to whom she will ; only in the Lord .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	7	40	But she is happier if she abide as she is , after my judgment : and I think that I also have the Spirit of God . Footnotes -

ASV	1%20Corinthians	8	8	But food will not [ b ] commend us to God : neither , if we eat not , [ c ] are we the worse ; nor , if we eat , [ d ] are we the better .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	8	2	If any man thinketh that he knoweth anything , he knoweth not yet as he ought to know ;
ASV	1%20Corinthians	8	3	but if any man loveth God , the same is known by him .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	8	4	Concerning therefore the eating of things sacrificed to idols , we know that no idol is anything in the world , and that there is no God but one .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	8	5	For though there be that are called gods , whether in heaven or on earth ; as there are gods many , and lords many ;
ASV	1%20Corinthians	8	6	yet to us there is one God , the Father , of whom are all things , and we unto him ; and one Lord , Jesus Christ , through whom are all things , and we through him .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	8	7	Howbeit there is not in all men that knowledge : but some , being used until now to the idol , eat as of a thing sacrificed to an idol ; and their conscience being weak is defiled .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	8	9	But take heed lest by any means this [ e ] liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to the weak .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	8	10	For if a man see thee who hast knowledge sitting at meat in an idol ’ s temple , will not his conscience , if he is weak , [ f ] be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols ?
ASV	1%20Corinthians	8	11	For [ g ] through thy knowledge he that is weak perisheth , the brother for whose sake Christ died .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	8	12	And thus , sinning against the brethren , and wounding their conscience when it is weak , ye sin against Christ .

ASV	1%20Corinthians	9	9	For it is written in the law of Moses , [ b ] Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn . Is it for the oxen that God careth ,
ASV	1%20Corinthians	9	2	If to others I am not an apostle , yet at least I am to you ; for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	9	3	My defence to them that examine me is this .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	9	4	Have we no right to eat and to drink ?
ASV	1%20Corinthians	9	5	Have we no right to lead about a wife that is a [ a ] believer , even as the rest of the apostles , and the brethren of the Lord , and Cephas ?
ASV	1%20Corinthians	9	6	Or I only and Barnabas , have we not a right to forbear working ?
ASV	1%20Corinthians	9	7	What soldier ever serveth at his own charges ? who planteth a vineyard , and eateth not the fruit thereof ? or who feedeth a flock , and eateth not of the milk of the flock ?
ASV	1%20Corinthians	9	8	Do I speak these things after the manner of men ? or saith not the law also the same ?
ASV	1%20Corinthians	9	10	or saith he it [ c ] assuredly for our sake ? Yea , for our sake it was written : because he that ploweth ought to plow in hope , and he that thresheth , to thresh in hope of partaking .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	9	11	If we sowed unto you spiritual things , is it a great matter if we shall reap your carnal things ?
ASV	1%20Corinthians	9	12	If others partake of this right over you , do not we yet more ? Nevertheless we did not use this right ; but we bear all things , that we may cause no hindrance to the [ d ] gospel of Christ .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	9	13	Know ye not that they that minister about sacred things eat of the things of the temple , and they that wait upon the altar have their portion with the altar ?
ASV	1%20Corinthians	9	14	Even so did the Lord ordain that they that proclaim the [ e ] gospel should live of the [ f ] gospel .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	9	15	But I have used none of these things : and I write not these things that it may be so done in my case ; for it were good for me rather to die , than that any man should make my glorying void .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	9	16	For if I [ g ] preach the gospel , I have nothing to glory of ; for necessity is laid upon me ; for woe is unto me , if I [ h ] preach not the gospel .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	9	17	For if I do this of mine own will , I have a reward : but if not of mine own will , I have a stewardship intrusted to me .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	9	18	What then is my reward ? That , when I [ i ] preach the gospel , I may make the [ j ] gospel without charge , so as not to use to the full my right in the [ k ] gospel .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	9	19	For though I was free from all men , I brought myself under bondage to all , that I might gain the more .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	9	20	And to the Jews I became as a Jew , that I might gain Jews ; to them that are under the law , as under the law , not being myself under the law , that I might gain them that are under the law ;
ASV	1%20Corinthians	9	21	to them that are without law , as without law , not being without law to God , but under law to Christ , that I might gain them that are without law .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	9	22	To the weak I became weak , that I might gain the weak : I am become all things to all men , that I may by all means save some .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	9	23	And I do all things for the [ l ] gospel ’ s sake , that I may be a joint partaker thereof .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	9	24	Know ye not that they that run in a [ m ] race run all , but one receiveth the prize ? Even so run ; that ye may attain .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	9	25	And every man that striveth in the games exerciseth self-control in all things . Now they do it to receive a corruptible crown ; but we an incorruptible .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	9	26	I therefore so run , as not uncertainly ; so [ n ] fight I , as not beating the air :
ASV	1%20Corinthians	9	27	but I [ o ] buffet my body , and bring it into bondage : lest by any means , after that I [ p ] have preached to others , I myself should be rejected . Footnotes -
ASV	1%20Corinthians	10	1	Corinthians 10:30 Or , If I by grace partake
ASV	1%20Corinthians	10	10	Neither murmur ye , as some of them murmured , and perished by the destroyer .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	10	2	and were all baptized [ a ] unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea ;
ASV	1%20Corinthians	10	3	and did all eat the same spiritual food ;
ASV	1%20Corinthians	10	4	and did all drink the same spiritual drink : for they drank of a spiritual rock that followed them : and the rock was [ b ] Christ .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	10	5	Howbeit with most of them God was not well pleased : for they were overthrown in the wilderness .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	10	6	Now [ c ] these things were our examples , to the intent we should not lust after evil things , as they also lusted .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	10	7	Neither be ye idolaters , as were some of them ; as it is written , [ d ] The people sat down to eat and drink , and rose up to play .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	10	8	Neither let us commit fornication , as some of them committed , and fell in one day three and twenty thousand .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	10	9	Neither let us make trial of the [ e ] Lord , as some of them made trial , and perished by the serpents .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	10	11	Now these things happened unto them [ f ] by way of example ; and they were written for our admonition , upon whom the ends of the ages are come .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	10	12	Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	10	13	There hath no temptation taken you but such as man can bear : but God is faithful , who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able ; but will with the temptation make also the way of escape , that ye may be able to endure it .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	10	14	Wherefore , my beloved , flee from idolatry .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	10	15	I speak as to wise men ; judge ye what I say .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	10	16	The cup of blessing which we bless , is it not a [ g ] communion of the blood of Christ ? The [ h ] bread which we break , is it not a [ i ] communion of the body of Christ ?
ASV	1%20Corinthians	10	17	[ j ] seeing that we , who are many , are one [ k ] bread , one body : for we all partake [ l ] of the one [ m ] bread .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	10	18	Behold Israel after the flesh : have not they that eat the sacrifices communion with the altar ?
ASV	1%20Corinthians	10	19	What say I then ? that a thing sacrificed to idols is anything , or that an idol is anything ?
ASV	1%20Corinthians	10	20	But I say , that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice , they sacrifice to demons , and not to God : and I would not that ye should have communion with demons .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	10	21	Ye can not drink the cup of the Lord , and the cup of demons : ye can not partake of the table of the Lord , and of the table of demons .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	10	22	Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy ? are we stronger than he ?
ASV	1%20Corinthians	10	23	All things are lawful ; but not all things are expedient . All things are lawful ; but not all things [ n ] edify .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	10	24	Let no man seek his own , but each [ o ] his neighbor ’ s good .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	10	25	Whatsoever is sold in the shambles , eat , asking no question for conscience ’ sake ;
ASV	1%20Corinthians	10	26	for the earth is the Lord ’ s , and the fulness thereof .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	10	27	If one of them that believe not biddeth you to a feast , and ye are disposed to go ; whatsoever is set before you , eat , asking no question for conscience ’ sake .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	10	28	But if any man say unto you , This hath been offered in sacrifice , eat not , for his sake that showed it , and for conscience ’ sake :
ASV	1%20Corinthians	10	29	conscience , I say , not thine own , but the other ’ s ; for why is my liberty judged by another conscience ?
ASV	1%20Corinthians	10	30	[ p ] If I partake with thankfulness , why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks ?
ASV	1%20Corinthians	10	31	Whether therefore ye eat , or drink , or whatsoever ye do , do all to the glory of God .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	10	32	Give no occasion of stumbling , either to Jews , or to Greeks , or to the church of God :
ASV	1%20Corinthians	10	33	even as I also please all men in all things , not seeking mine own profit , but the profit of the many , that they may be saved . Footnotes -
ASV	1%20Corinthians	11	1	Corinthians 11:32 Or , when we are judged of the Lord , we are chastened
ASV	1%20Corinthians	11	11	Nevertheless , neither is the woman without the man , nor the man without the woman , in the Lord .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	11	2	Now I praise you that ye remember me in all things , and hold fast the traditions , even as I delivered them to you .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	11	3	But I would have you know , that the head of every man is Christ ; and the head of the woman is the man ; and the head of Christ is God .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	11	4	Every man praying or prophesying , having his head covered , dishonoreth his head .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	11	5	But every woman praying or prophesying with her head unveiled dishonoreth her head ; for it is one and the same thing as if she were shaven .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	11	6	For if a woman is not veiled , let her also be shorn : but if it is a shame to a woman to be shorn or shaven , let her be veiled .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	11	7	For a man indeed ought not to have his head veiled , forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God : but the woman is the glory of the man .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	11	8	For the man is not of the woman ; but the woman of the man :
ASV	1%20Corinthians	11	9	for neither was the man created for the woman ; but the woman for the man :
ASV	1%20Corinthians	11	10	for this cause ought the woman to have a sign of authority on her head , because of the angels .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	11	12	For as the woman is of the man , so is the man also by the woman ; but all things are of God .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	11	13	Judge ye [ a ] in yourselves : is it seemly that a woman pray unto God unveiled ?
ASV	1%20Corinthians	11	14	Doth not even nature itself teach you , that , if a man have long hair , it is a dishonor to him ?
ASV	1%20Corinthians	11	15	But if a woman have long hair , it is a glory to her : for her hair is given her for a covering .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	11	16	But if any man seemeth to be contentious , we have no such custom , neither the churches of God .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	11	17	But in giving you this charge , I praise you not , that ye come together not for the better but for the worse .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	11	18	For first of all , when ye come together [ b ] in the church , I hear that [ c ] divisions exist among you ; and I partly believe it .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	11	19	For there must be also [ d ] factions among you , that they that are approved may be made manifest among you .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	11	20	When therefore ye assemble yourselves together , it is not possible to eat the Lord ’ s supper :
ASV	1%20Corinthians	11	21	for in your eating each one taketh before other his own supper ; and one is hungry , and another is drunken .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	11	22	What , have ye not houses to eat and to drink in ? or despise ye the [ e ] church of God , and put them to shame that [ f ] have not ? What shall I say to you ? [ g ] shall I praise you ? In this I praise you not .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	11	23	For I received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you , that the Lord Jesus in the night in which he was [ h ] betrayed took bread ;
ASV	1%20Corinthians	11	24	and when he had given thanks , he brake it , and said , This is my body , which [ i ] is for you : this do in remembrance of me .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	11	25	In like manner also the cup , after supper , saying , This cup is the new covenant in my blood : this do , as often as ye drink it , in remembrance of me .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	11	26	For as often as ye eat this bread , and drink the cup , ye proclaim the Lord ’ s death till he come .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	11	27	Wherefore whosoever shall eat the bread or drink the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner , shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	11	28	But let a man prove himself , and so let him eat of the bread , and drink of the cup .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	11	29	For he that eateth and drinketh , eateth and drinketh judgment unto himself , if he [ j ] discern not the body .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	11	30	For this cause many among you are weak and sickly , and not a few sleep .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	11	31	But if we [ k ] discerned ourselves , we should not be judged .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	11	32	But [ l ] when we are judged , we are chastened of the Lord , that we may not be condemned with the world .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	11	33	Wherefore , my brethren , when ye come together to eat , wait one for another .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	11	34	If any man is hungry , let him eat at home ; that your coming together be not unto judgment . And the rest will I set in order whensoever I come . Footnotes -
ASV	1%20Corinthians	12	1	Corinthians 12:29 Greek powers .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	12	12	For as the body is one , and hath many members , and all the members of the body , being many , are one body ; so also is Christ .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	12	2	Ye know that when ye were Gentiles ye were led away unto those dumb idols , howsoever ye might be led .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	12	3	Wherefore I make known unto you , that no man speaking in the Spirit of God saith , Jesus is anathema ; and no man can say , Jesus is Lord , but in the Holy Spirit .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	12	4	Now there are diversities of gifts , but the same Spirit .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	12	5	And there are diversities of ministrations , and the same Lord .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	12	6	And there are diversities of workings , but the same God , who worketh all things in all .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	12	7	But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit to profit withal .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	12	8	For to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom ; and to another the word of knowledge , according to the same Spirit :
ASV	1%20Corinthians	12	9	to another faith , in the same Spirit ; and to another gifts of healings , in the one Spirit ;
ASV	1%20Corinthians	12	10	and to another workings of [ a ] miracles ; and to another prophecy ; and to another discernings of spirits : to another divers kinds of tongues ; and to another the interpretation of tongues :
ASV	1%20Corinthians	12	11	but all these worketh the one and the same Spirit , dividing to each one severally even as he will .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	12	13	For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body , whether Jews or Greeks , whether bond or free ; and were all made to drink of one Spirit .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	12	14	For the body is not one member , but many .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	12	15	If the foot shall say , Because I am not the hand , I am not of the body ; it is not therefore not of the body .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	12	16	And if the ear shall say , Because I am not the eye , I am not of the body ; it is not therefore not of the body .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	12	17	If the whole body were an eye , where were the hearing ? If the whole were hearing , where were the smelling ?
ASV	1%20Corinthians	12	18	But now hath God set the members each one of them in the body , even as it pleased him .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	12	19	And if they were all one member , where were the body ?
ASV	1%20Corinthians	12	20	But now they are many members , but one body .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	12	21	And the eye can not say to the hand , I have no need of thee : or again the head to the feet , I have no need of you .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	12	22	Nay , much rather , those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary :
ASV	1%20Corinthians	12	23	and those parts of the body , which we think to be less honorable , upon these we [ b ] bestow more abundant honor ; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness ;
ASV	1%20Corinthians	12	24	whereas our comely parts have no need : but God tempered the body together , giving more abundant honor to that part which lacked ;
ASV	1%20Corinthians	12	25	that there should be no schism in the body ; but that the members should have the same care one for another .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	12	26	And whether one member suffereth , all the members suffer with it ; or one member is [ c ] honored , all the members rejoice with it .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	12	27	Now ye are the body of Christ , and [ d ] severally members thereof .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	12	28	And God hath set some in the church , first apostles , secondly prophets , thirdly teachers , then [ e ] miracles , then gifts of healings , helps , [ f ] governments , divers kinds of tongues .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	12	29	Are all apostles ? are all prophets ? are all teachers ? are all workers of [ g ] miracles ?
ASV	1%20Corinthians	12	30	have all gifts of healings ? do all speak with tongues ? do all interpret ?
ASV	1%20Corinthians	12	31	But desire earnestly the greater gifts . And moreover a most excellent way show I unto you . Footnotes -

ASV	1%20Corinthians	13	2	And if I have the gift of prophecy , and know all mysteries and all knowledge ; and if I have all faith , so as to remove mountains , but have not love , I am nothing .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	13	3	And if I bestow all my goods to feed the poor , and if I give my body [ a ] to be burned , but have not love , it profiteth me nothing .

ASV	1%20Corinthians	13	7	[ b ] beareth all things , believeth all things , hopeth all things , endureth all things .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	13	8	Love never faileth : but whether there be prophecies , they shall be done away ; whether there be tongues , they shall cease ; whether there be knowledge , it shall be done away .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	13	9	For we know in part , and we prophesy in part ;
ASV	1%20Corinthians	13	10	but when that which is perfect is come , that which is in part shall be done away .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	13	11	When I was a child , I spake as a child , I felt as a child , I thought as a child : now that I am become a man , I have put away childish things .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	13	12	For now we see in a mirror , [ c ] darkly ; but then face to face : now I know in part ; but then shall I know fully even as also I was fully known .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	14	1	Corinthians 14:38 Many ancient authorities read But if any man knoweth not , he is not known . Compare 8:3 .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	14	14	For if I pray in a tongue , my spirit prayeth , but my understanding is unfruitful .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	14	2	For he that speaketh in a tongue speaketh not unto men , but unto God ; for no man [ a ] understandeth ; but in the spirit he speaketh mysteries .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	14	3	But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men edification , and [ b ] exhortation , and consolation .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	14	4	He that speaketh in a tongue [ c ] edifieth himself ; but he that prophesieth [ d ] edifieth the church .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	14	5	Now I would have you all speak with tongues , but rather that ye should prophesy : and greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues , except he interpret , that the church may receive edifying .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	14	6	But now , brethren , if I come unto you speaking with tongues , what shall I profit you , unless I speak to you either by way of revelation , or of knowledge , or of prophesying , or of teaching ?
ASV	1%20Corinthians	14	7	Even things without life , giving a voice , whether pipe or harp , if they give not a distinction in the sounds , how shall it be known what is piped or harped ?
ASV	1%20Corinthians	14	8	For if the trumpet give an uncertain voice , who shall prepare himself for war ?
ASV	1%20Corinthians	14	9	So also ye , unless ye utter by the tongue speech easy to be understood , how shall it be known what is spoken ? for ye will be speaking into the air .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	14	10	There are , it may be , so many kinds of voices in the world , and [ e ] no kind is without signification .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	14	11	If then I know not the meaning of the voice , I shall be to him that speaketh a barbarian , and he that speaketh will be a barbarian [ f ] unto me .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	14	12	So also ye , since ye are zealous of [ g ] spiritual gifts , seek that ye may abound unto the edifying of the church .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	14	13	Wherefore let him that speaketh in a tongue pray that he may interpret .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	14	15	What is it then ? I will pray with the spirit , and I will pray with the understanding also : I will sing with the spirit , and I will sing with the understanding also .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	14	16	Else if thou bless with the spirit , how shall he that filleth the place of [ h ] the unlearned say the Amen at thy giving of thanks , seeing he knoweth not what thou sayest ?
ASV	1%20Corinthians	14	17	For thou verily givest thanks well , but the other is not [ i ] edified .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	14	18	I thank God , I speak with tongues more than you all :
ASV	1%20Corinthians	14	19	howbeit in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding , that I might instruct others also , than ten thousand words in a tongue .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	14	20	Brethren , be not children in mind : yet in malice be ye babes , but in mind be [ j ] men .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	14	21	In the law it is written , [ k ] By men of strange tongues and by the lips of strangers will I speak unto this people ; and not even thus will they hear me , saith the Lord .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	14	22	Wherefore tongues are for a sign , not to them that believe , but to the unbelieving : but prophesying is for a sign , not to the unbelieving , but to them that believe .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	14	23	,
ASV	1%20Corinthians	14	24	. -
ASV	1%20Corinthians	14	25	the secrets of his heart are made manifest ; and so he will fall down on his face and worship God , declaring that God is [ m ] among you indeed .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	14	26	What is it then , brethren ? When ye come together , each one hath a psalm , hath a teaching , hath a revelation , hath a tongue , hath an interpretation . Let all things be done unto edifying .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	14	27	If any man speaketh in a tongue , let it be by two , or at the most three , and that in turn ; and let one interpret :
ASV	1%20Corinthians	14	28	but if there be no interpreter , let him keep silence in the church ; and let him speak to himself , and to God .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	14	29	And let the prophets speak by two or three , and let the others [ n ] discern .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	14	30	But if a revelation be made to another sitting by , let the first keep silence .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	14	31	For ye all can prophesy one by one , that all may learn , and all may be [ o ] exhorted ;
ASV	1%20Corinthians	14	32	and the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets ;
ASV	1%20Corinthians	14	33	for God is not a God of confusion , but of peace . As in all the churches of the saints ,
ASV	1%20Corinthians	14	34	let the women keep silence in the churches : for it is not permitted unto them to speak ; but let them be in subjection , as also [ p ] saith the law .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	14	35	And if they would learn anything , let them ask their own husbands at home : for it is shameful for a woman to speak in the church .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	14	36	What ? was it from you that the word of God went forth ? or came it unto you alone ?
ASV	1%20Corinthians	14	37	If any man thinketh himself to be a prophet , or spiritual , let him take knowledge of the things which I write unto you , that they are the commandment of the Lord .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	14	38	[ q ] But if any man is ignorant , let him be ignorant .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	14	39	Wherefore , my brethren , desire earnestly to prophesy , and forbid not to speak with tongues .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	14	40	But let all things be done decently and in order . Footnotes -

ASV	1%20Corinthians	15	7	then he appeared to [ f ] James ; then to all the apostles ;
ASV	1%20Corinthians	15	8	and last of all , as to the child untimely born , he appeared to me also .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	15	9	For I am the least of the apostles , that am not meet to be called an apostle , because I persecuted the church of God .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	15	10	But by the grace of God I am what I am : and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not found [ g ] vain ; but I labored more abundantly than they all : yet not I , but the grace of God which was with me .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	15	11	Whether then it be I or they , so we preach , and so ye believed .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	15	12	Now if Christ is preached that he hath been raised from the dead , how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead ?
ASV	1%20Corinthians	15	13	But if there is no resurrection of the dead , neither hath Christ been raised :
ASV	1%20Corinthians	15	14	and if Christ hath not been raised , then is our preaching [ h ] vain , [ i ] your faith also is [ j ] vain .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	15	16	For if the dead are not raised , neither hath Christ been raised :
ASV	1%20Corinthians	15	17	and if Christ hath not been raised , your faith is vain ; ye are yet in your sins .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	15	18	Then they also that are fallen asleep in Christ have perished .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	15	19	[ l ] If we have only hoped in Christ in this life , we are of all men most pitiable .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	15	20	But now hath Christ been raised from the dead , the first-fruits of them that are asleep .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	15	21	For since by man came death , by man came also the resurrection of the dead .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	15	22	For as in Adam all die , so also in [ m ] Christ shall all be made alive .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	15	23	But each in his own order : Christ the first-fruits ; then they that are Christ ’ s , at his [ n ] coming .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	15	24	Then cometh the end , when he shall deliver up the kingdom to [ o ] God , even the Father ; when he shall have abolished all rule and all authority and power .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	15	25	For he must reign , till he hath put all his enemies under his feet .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	15	26	The last enemy that shall be abolished is death .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	15	27	For , He put all things in subjection under his feet . [ p ] But when he saith , [ q ] All things are put in subjection , it is evident that he is excepted who did subject all things unto him .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	15	28	And when all things have been subjected unto him , then shall the Son also himself be subjected to him that did subject all things unto him , that God may be all in all .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	15	29	Else what shall they do that are baptized for the dead ? If the dead are not raised at all , why then are they baptized for them ?
ASV	1%20Corinthians	15	30	why do we also stand in jeopardy every hour ?
ASV	1%20Corinthians	15	31	I protest by [ r ] that glorying in you , brethren , which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord , I die daily .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	15	32	If after the manner of men I fought with beasts at Ephesus , [ s ] what doth it profit me ? If the dead are not raised , let us eat and drink , for to-morrow we die .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	15	33	Be not deceived : Evil companionships corrupt good morals .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	15	34	Awake to soberness righteously , and sin not ; for some have no knowledge of God : I speak this to move you to shame .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	15	35	But some one will say , How are the dead raised ? and with what manner of body do they come ?
ASV	1%20Corinthians	15	36	Thou foolish one , that which thou thyself sowest is not quickened except it die :
ASV	1%20Corinthians	15	37	and that which thou sowest , thou sowest not the body that shall be , but a bare grain , it may chance of wheat , or of some other kind ;
ASV	1%20Corinthians	15	38	but God giveth it a body even as it pleased him , and to each seed a body of its own .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	15	39	All flesh is not the same flesh : but there is one flesh of men , and another flesh of beasts , and another flesh of birds , and another of fishes .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	15	40	There are also celestial bodies , and bodies terrestrial : but the glory of the celestial is one , and the glory of the terrestrial is another .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	15	41	There is one glory of the sun , and another glory of the moon , and another glory of the stars ; for one star differeth from another star in glory .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	15	42	So also is the resurrection of the dead . It is sown in corruption ; it is raised in incorruption :
ASV	1%20Corinthians	15	43	it is sown in dishonor ; it is raised in glory : it is sown in weakness ; it is raised in power :
ASV	1%20Corinthians	15	44	it is sown a [ t ] natural body ; it is raised a spiritual body . If there is a [ u ] natural body , there is also a spiritual body .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	15	45	So also it is written , [ v ] The first man Adam became a living soul . The last Adam became a life-giving spirit .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	15	46	Howbeit that is not first which is spiritual , but that which is [ w ] natural ; then that which is spiritual .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	15	47	The first man is of the earth , earthy : the second man is of heaven .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	15	48	As is the earthy , such are they also that are earthy : and as is the heavenly , such are they also that are heavenly .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	15	49	And as we have borne the image of the earthy , [ x ] we shall also bear the image of the heavenly .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	15	50	Now this I say , brethren , that flesh and blood can not inherit the kingdom of God ; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	15	51	Behold , I tell you a mystery : [ y ] We all shall not sleep , but we shall all be changed ,
ASV	1%20Corinthians	15	52	in a moment , in the twinkling of an eye , at the last trump : for the trumpet shall sound , and the dead shall be raised incorruptible , and we shall be changed .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	15	53	For this corruptible must put on incorruption , and this mortal must put on immortality .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	15	54	But when [ z ] this corruptible shall have put on incorruption , and this mortal shall have put on immortality , then shall come to pass the saying that is written , [ aa ] Death is swallowed up [ ab ] in victory .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	15	55	[ ac ] O death , where is thy victory ? O death , where is thy sting ?
ASV	1%20Corinthians	15	56	The sting of death is sin ; and the power of sin is the law :
ASV	1%20Corinthians	15	57	but thanks be to God , who giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	15	58	Wherefore , my beloved brethren , be ye stedfast , unmoveable , always abounding in the work of the Lord , forasmuch as ye know that your labor is not [ ad ] vain in the Lord . Footnotes -
ASV	1%20Corinthians	16	1	Corinthians 16:22 That is , O ( or Our ) Lord , come !

ASV	1%20Corinthians	16	3	And when I arrive , [ a ] whomsoever ye shall approve , them will I send with letters to carry your bounty unto Jerusalem :
ASV	1%20Corinthians	16	4	and if it be meet for me to go also , they shall go with me .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	16	5	But I will come unto you , when I shall have passed through Macedonia ; for I pass through Macedonia ;
ASV	1%20Corinthians	16	6	but with you it may be that I shall abide , or even winter , that ye may set me forward on my journey whithersoever I go .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	16	7	For I do not wish to see you now by the way ; for I hope to tarry a while with you , if the Lord permit .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	16	8	But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost ;
ASV	1%20Corinthians	16	9	for a great door and effectual is opened unto me , and there are many adversaries .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	16	10	Now if Timothy come , see that he be with you without fear ; for he worketh the work of the Lord , as I also do :
ASV	1%20Corinthians	16	11	let no man therefore despise him . But set him forward on his journey in peace , that he may come unto me : for I expect him with the brethren .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	16	12	But as touching Apollos the brother , I besought him much to come unto you with the brethren : and it was not at all [ b ] his will to come now ; but he will come when he shall have opportunity .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	16	13	Watch ye , stand fast in the faith , quit you like men , be strong .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	16	14	Let all that ye do be done in love .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	16	15	Now I beseech you , brethren ( ye know the house of Stephanas , that it is the first-fruits of Achaia , and that they have set themselves to minister unto the saints ) ,
ASV	1%20Corinthians	16	17	And I rejoice at the [ c ] coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus : for that which was lacking on your part they supplied .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	16	18	For they refreshed my spirit and yours : acknowledge ye therefore them that are such .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	16	19	The churches of Asia salute you . Aquila and Prisca salute you much in the Lord , with the church that is in their house .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	16	20	All the brethren salute you . Salute one another with a holy kiss .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	16	21	The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	16	22	If any man loveth not the Lord , let him be anathema . [ d ] Maranatha .
ASV	1%20Corinthians	16	23	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you .

ASV	2%20Corinthians	1	2	Corinthians 1:24 Or , your faith
ASV	2%20Corinthians	1	1	Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God , and Timothy [ a ] our brother , unto the church of God which is at Corinth , with all the saints that are in the whole of Achaia :
ASV	2%20Corinthians	1	3	Blessed be [ b ] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of mercies and God of all comfort ;
ASV	2%20Corinthians	1	4	who comforteth us in all our affliction , that we may be able to comfort them that are in any affliction , through the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	1	5	For as the sufferings of Christ abound unto us , even so our comfort also aboundeth through Christ .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	1	6	But whether we are afflicted , it is for your comfort and salvation ; or whether we are comforted , it is for your comfort , which worketh in the patient enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer :
ASV	2%20Corinthians	1	7	and our hope for you is stedfast ; knowing that , as ye are partakers of the sufferings , so also are ye of the comfort .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	1	8	For we would not have you ignorant , brethren , concerning our affliction which befell us in Asia , that we were weighed down exceedingly , beyond our power , insomuch that we despaired even of life :
ASV	2%20Corinthians	1	9	[ c ] yea , we ourselves have had the [ d ] sentence of death within ourselves , that we should not trust in ourselves , but in God who raiseth the dead :
ASV	2%20Corinthians	1	10	who delivered us out of so great a death , and will deliver : on whom we have [ e ] set our hope that he will also still deliver us ;
ASV	2%20Corinthians	1	11	ye also helping together on our behalf by your supplication ; that , for the gift bestowed upon us by means of many , thanks may be given by many persons on our behalf .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	1	12	For our glorying is this , the testimony of our conscience , that in holiness and sincerity of God , not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God , we behaved ourselves in the world , and more abundantly to you-ward .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	1	13	For we write no other things unto you , than what ye read or even acknowledge , and I hope ye will acknowledge unto the end :
ASV	2%20Corinthians	1	14	as also ye did acknowledge us in part , that we are your glorying , even as ye also are ours , in the day of our Lord Jesus .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	1	15	And in this confidence I was minded to come first unto you , that ye might have a second [ f ] benefit ;
ASV	2%20Corinthians	1	16	and by you to pass into Macedonia , and again from Macedonia to come unto you , and of you to be set forward on my journey unto Judaea .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	1	17	When I therefore was thus minded , did I show fickleness ? or the things that I purpose , do I purpose according to the flesh , that with me there should be the yea yea and the nay nay ?
ASV	2%20Corinthians	1	18	But as God is faithful , our word toward you is not yea and nay .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	1	19	For the Son of God , Jesus Christ , who was preached among you [ g ] by us , even [ h ] by me and Silvanus and Timothy , was not yea and nay , but in him is yea .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	1	20	For how many soever be the promises of God , in him is the yea : wherefore also through him is the Amen , unto the glory of God through us .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	1	21	Now he that establisheth us with you [ i ] in Christ , and anointed us , is God ;
ASV	2%20Corinthians	1	22	[ j ] who also sealed us , and gave us the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	1	23	But I call God for a witness upon my soul , that to spare you I forbare to come unto Corinth .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	1	24	Not that we have lordship over your faith , but are helpers of your joy : for in [ k ] faith ye stand fast . Footnotes -
ASV	2%20Corinthians	2	2	Pet . 2:3 .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	2	1	[ a ] But I determined this for myself , that I would not come again to you with sorrow .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	2	3	And I wrote this very thing , lest , when I came , I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice ; having confidence in you all , that my joy is the joy of you all .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	2	4	For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears ; not that ye should be made sorry , but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	2	5	But if any hath caused sorrow , he hath caused sorrow , not to me , but in part ( that I press not too heavily ) to you all .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	2	6	Sufficient to such a one is this punishment which was inflicted by [ b ] the many ;
ASV	2%20Corinthians	2	7	so that contrariwise ye should [ c ] rather forgive him and comfort him , lest by any means such a one should be swallowed up with his overmuch sorrow .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	2	8	Wherefore I beseech you to confirm your love toward him .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	2	9	For to this end also did I write , that I might know the proof of you , [ d ] whether ye are obedient in all things .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	2	10	But to whom ye forgive anything , I forgive also : for what I also have forgiven , if I have forgiven anything , for your sakes have I forgiven it in the [ e ] presence of Christ ;
ASV	2%20Corinthians	2	11	that no advantage may be gained over us by Satan : for we are not ignorant of his devices .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	2	12	Now when I came to Troas for the [ f ] gospel of Christ , and when a door was opened unto me in the Lord ,
ASV	2%20Corinthians	2	13	I had no relief for my spirit , because I found not Titus my brother : but taking my leave of them , I went forth into Macedonia .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	2	14	But thanks be unto God , who always leadeth us in triumph in Christ , and maketh manifest through us the savor of his knowledge in every place .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	2	15	For we are a sweet savor of Christ unto God , in them that [ g ] are saved , and in them that [ h ] perish ;
ASV	2%20Corinthians	2	16	to the one a savor from death unto death ; to the other a savor from life unto life . And who is sufficient for these things ?
ASV	2%20Corinthians	2	17	For we are not as the many , [ i ] corrupting the word of God : but as of sincerity , but as of God , in the sight of God , speak we in Christ . Footnotes -
ASV	2%20Corinthians	3	2	Corinthians 3:18 Or , reflecting as a mirror
ASV	2%20Corinthians	3	3	being made manifest that ye are an epistle of Christ , ministered by us , written not with ink , but with the Spirit of the living God ; not in tables of stone , but in tables that are hearts of flesh .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	3	4	And such confidence have we through Christ to God-ward :
ASV	2%20Corinthians	3	5	not that we are sufficient of ourselves , to account anything as from ourselves ; but our sufficiency is from God ;
ASV	2%20Corinthians	3	6	who also made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant ; not of the letter , but of the spirit : for the letter killeth , but the spirit giveth life .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	3	7	margin . -
ASV	2%20Corinthians	3	8	how shall not rather the ministration of the spirit be with glory ?
ASV	2%20Corinthians	3	9	[ d ] For if the ministration of condemnation hath glory , much rather doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	3	10	. -
ASV	2%20Corinthians	3	11	For if that which [ e ] passeth away was [ f ] with glory , much more that which remaineth is in glory .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	3	12	Having therefore such a hope , we use great boldness of speech ,
ASV	2%20Corinthians	3	13	and are not as Moses , who put a veil upon his face , that the children of Israel should not look stedfastly [ g ] on the end of that which [ h ] was passing away :
ASV	2%20Corinthians	3	14	but their [ i ] minds were hardened : for until this very day at the reading of the old covenant the same veil [ j ] remaineth , it not being revealed to them that it is done away in Christ .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	3	15	But unto this day , whensoever Moses is read , a veil lieth upon their heart .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	3	16	But whensoever [ k ] it shall turn to the Lord , the veil is taken away .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	3	17	Now the Lord is the Spirit : and where the Spirit of the Lord is , there is liberty .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	3	18	But we all , with unveiled face [ l ] beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord , are transformed into the same image from glory to glory , even as from the Lord the Spirit . Footnotes -

ASV	2%20Corinthians	4	3	And even if our [ a ] gospel is veiled , it is veiled in them that [ b ] perish :
ASV	2%20Corinthians	4	5	For we preach not ourselves , but Christ Jesus as Lord , and ourselves as your [ h ] servants [ i ] for Jesus ’ sake .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	4	6	Seeing it is God , that said , [ j ] Light shall shine out of darkness , who shined in our hearts , to give the [ k ] light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	4	7	But we have this treasure in earthen vessels , that the exceeding greatness of the power may be of God , and not from ourselves ;
ASV	2%20Corinthians	4	8	we are pressed on every side , yet not straitened ; perplexed , yet not unto despair ;
ASV	2%20Corinthians	4	9	pursued , yet not [ l ] forsaken ; smitten down , yet not destroyed ;
ASV	2%20Corinthians	4	10	always bearing about in the body the [ m ] dying of Jesus , that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our body .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	4	11	For we who live are always delivered unto death for Jesus ’ sake , that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	4	12	So then death worketh in us , but life in you .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	4	13	But having the same spirit of faith , according to that which is written , [ n ] I believed , and therefore did I speak ; we also believe , and therefore also we speak ;
ASV	2%20Corinthians	4	14	knowing that he that raised up [ o ] the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also with Jesus , and shall present us with you .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	4	15	For all things are for your sakes , that the grace , being multiplied through [ p ] the many , may cause the thanksgiving to abound unto the glory of God .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	4	16	Wherefore we faint not ; but though our outward man is decaying , yet our inward man is renewed day by day .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	4	17	For our light affliction , which is for the moment , worketh for us more and more exceedingly an eternal weight of glory ;
ASV	2%20Corinthians	4	18	while we look not at the things which are seen , but at the things which are not seen : for the things which are seen are temporal ; but the things which are not seen are eternal . Footnotes -

ASV	2%20Corinthians	5	3	if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	5	4	For indeed we that are in this [ b ] tabernacle do groan , [ c ] being burdened ; not for that we would be unclothed , but that we would be clothed upon , that what is mortal may be swallowed up of life .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	5	6	Being therefore always of good courage , and knowing that , whilst we are at home in the body , we are absent from the Lord
ASV	2%20Corinthians	5	7	( for we walk by faith , not by [ d ] sight ) ;
ASV	2%20Corinthians	5	8	we are of good courage , I say , and are willing rather to be absent from the body , and to be at home with the Lord .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	5	9	Wherefore also we [ e ] make it our aim , whether at home or absent , to be well-pleasing unto him .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	5	10	For we must all be made manifest before the judgment-seat of Christ ; that each one may receive the things done [ f ] in the body , according to what he hath done , whether it be good or bad .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	5	11	Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord , we persuade men , but we are made manifest unto God ; and I hope that we are made manifest also in your consciences .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	5	12	We are not again commending ourselves unto you , but speak as giving you occasion of glorying on our behalf , that ye may have wherewith to answer them that glory in appearance , and not in heart .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	5	13	For whether we [ g ] are beside ourselves , it is unto God ; or whether we are of sober mind , it is unto you .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	5	14	For the love of Christ constraineth us ; because we thus judge , that one died for all , therefore all died ;
ASV	2%20Corinthians	5	15	and he died for all , that they that live should no longer live unto themselves , but unto him who for their sakes died and rose again .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	5	16	Wherefore we henceforth know no man after the flesh : even though we have known Christ after the flesh , yet now we know him so no more .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	5	17	Wherefore if any man is in Christ , [ h ] he is a new creature : the old things are passed away ; behold , they are become new .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	5	18	But all things are of God , who reconciled us to himself through Christ , and gave unto us the ministry of reconciliation ;
ASV	2%20Corinthians	5	19	to wit , that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself , not reckoning unto them their trespasses , and having [ i ] committed unto us the word of reconciliation .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	5	20	We are ambassadors therefore on behalf of Christ , as though God were entreating by us : we beseech you on behalf of Christ , be ye reconciled to God .

ASV	2%20Corinthians	7	2	Corinthians 7:10 Or , unto a salvation which bringeth no regret
ASV	2%20Corinthians	7	7	and not by his [ c ] coming only , but also by the comfort wherewith he was comforted in you , while he told us your longing , your mourning , your zeal for me ; so that I rejoiced yet more .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	7	1	Having therefore these promises , beloved , let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit , perfecting holiness in the fear of God .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	7	3	I say it not to condemn you : for I have said before , that ye are in our hearts to die together and live together .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	7	4	Great is my boldness of speech toward you , great is my glorying on your behalf : I am filled with comfort , I overflow with joy in all our affliction .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	7	5	For even when we were come into Macedonia our flesh had no relief , but we were afflicted on every side ; without were fightings , within were fears .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	7	6	Nevertheless he that comforteth the lowly , even God , comforted us by the [ b ] coming of Titus ;
ASV	2%20Corinthians	7	8	For though I made you sorry with my epistle , I do not regret it : though I did regret it [ d ] ( for I see that that epistle made you sorry , though but for a season ) ,
ASV	2%20Corinthians	7	9	I now rejoice , not that ye were made sorry , but that ye were made sorry unto repentance ; for ye were made sorry after a godly sort , that ye might suffer loss by us in nothing .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	7	10	For godly sorrow worketh repentance [ e ] unto salvation , a repentance which bringeth no regret : but the sorrow of the world worketh death .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	7	11	For behold , this selfsame thing , that ye were made sorry after a godly sort , what earnest care it wrought in you , yea what clearing of yourselves , yea what indignation , yea what fear , yea what longing , yea what zeal , yea what avenging ! In everything ye approved yourselves to be pure in the matter .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	7	12	So although I wrote unto you , I wrote not for his cause that did the wrong , nor for his cause that suffered the wrong , but that your earnest care for us might be made manifest unto you in the sight of God .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	7	13	Therefore we have been comforted : and in our comfort we joyed the more exceedingly for the joy of Titus , because his spirit hath been refreshed by you all .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	7	14	For if in anything I have gloried to him on your behalf , I was not put to shame ; but as we spake all things to you in truth , so our glorying also which I made before Titus was found to be truth .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	7	15	And his affection is more abundantly toward you , while he remembereth the obedience of you all , how with fear and trembling ye received him .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	7	16	I rejoice that in everything I am of good courage concerning you . Footnotes -

ASV	2%20Corinthians	8	8	I speak not by way of commandment , but as proving through the earnestness of others the sincerity also of your love .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	8	3	For according to their power , I bear witness , yea and beyond their power , they gave of their own accord ,
ASV	2%20Corinthians	8	4	beseeching us with much entreaty in regard of this grace and the fellowship in the ministering to the saints :
ASV	2%20Corinthians	8	5	and this , not as we had hoped , but first they gave their own selves to the Lord , and to us through the will of God .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	8	6	Insomuch that we exhorted Titus , that as he had made a beginning before , so he would also complete in you this grace also .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	8	7	But as ye abound in everything , in faith , and utterance , and knowledge , and in all earnestness , and in [ b ] your love to us , see that ye abound in this grace also .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	8	9	For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ , that , though he was rich , yet for your sakes he became poor , that ye through his poverty might become rich .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	8	10	And herein I give my judgment : for this is expedient for you , who were the first to make a beginning a year ago , not only to do , but also to will .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	8	11	But now complete the doing also ; that as there was the readiness to will , so there may be the completion also out of your ability .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	8	12	For if the readiness is there , it is acceptable according as a man hath , not according as he hath not .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	8	13	For I say not this that others may be eased and ye distressed ;
ASV	2%20Corinthians	8	14	but by equality : your abundance being a supply at this present time for their want , that their abundance also may become a supply for your want ; that there may be equality :
ASV	2%20Corinthians	8	15	as it is written , [ c ] He that gathered much had nothing over ; and he that gathered little had no lack .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	8	16	But thanks be to God , who putteth the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	8	17	For he accepted indeed our exhortation ; but being himself very earnest , he went forth unto you of his own accord .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	8	18	And we have sent together with him the brother whose praise in the [ d ] gospel is spread through all the churches ;
ASV	2%20Corinthians	8	19	and not only so , but who was also appointed by the churches to travel with us in the matter of this grace , which is ministered by us to the glory of the Lord , and to show our readiness :
ASV	2%20Corinthians	8	20	avoiding this , that any man should blame us in the matter of this bounty which is ministered by us :
ASV	2%20Corinthians	8	21	for we take thought for things honorable , not only in the sight of the Lord , but also in the sight of men .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	8	22	And we have sent with them our brother , whom we have many times proved earnest in many things , but now much more earnest , by reason of the great confidence which he hath in you .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	8	23	Whether any inquire about Titus , he is my partner and my fellow-worker to you-ward ; or our brethren , they are the [ e ] messengers of the churches , they are the glory of Christ .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	8	24	[ f ] Show ye therefore unto them in the face of the churches the proof of your love , and of our glorying on your behalf . Footnotes -

ASV	2%20Corinthians	9	13	seeing that through the proving of you by this ministration they glorify God for the obedience of your confession unto the [ j ] gospel of Christ , and for the [ k ] liberality of your contribution unto them and unto all ;
ASV	2%20Corinthians	9	14	while they themselves also , with supplication on your behalf , long after you by reason of the exceeding grace of God in you .

ASV	2%20Corinthians	10	7	[ b ] Ye look at the things that are before your face . If any man trusteth in himself that he is Christ ’ s , let him consider this again with himself , that , even as he is Christ ’ s , so also are we .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	10	8	For though I should glory somewhat abundantly concerning our authority ( which the Lord gave for building you up , and not for casting you down ) , I shall not be put to shame :
ASV	2%20Corinthians	10	9	that I may not seem as if I would terrify you by my letters .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	10	11	Let such a one reckon this , that , what we are in word by letters when we are absent , such are we also in deed when we are present .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	10	12	For we are not bold [ c ] to number or compare ourselves with certain of them that commend themselves : but they themselves , measuring themselves by themselves , and comparing themselves with themselves , are without understanding .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	10	13	But we will not glory beyond our measure , but according to the measure of the [ d ] province which God apportioned to us as a measure , to reach even unto you .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	10	14	For we stretch not ourselves overmuch , as though we reached not unto you : for we [ e ] came even as far as unto you in the [ f ] gospel of Christ :
ASV	2%20Corinthians	10	15	not glorying beyond our measure , that is , in other men ’ s labors ; but having hope that , as your faith groweth , we shall be magnified in you according to our [ g ] province unto further abundance ,
ASV	2%20Corinthians	10	16	so as to [ h ] preach the gospel even unto the parts beyond you , and not to glory in another ’ s [ i ] province in regard of things ready to our hand .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	10	17	[ j ] But he that glorieth , let him glory in the Lord .

ASV	2%20Corinthians	11	5	For I reckon that I am not a whit behind [ e ] the very chiefest apostles .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	11	6	But though I be rude in speech , yet am I not in knowledge ; [ f ] nay , in every way have we made this manifest unto you in all things .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	11	7	Or did I commit a sin in abasing myself that ye might be exalted , because I [ g ] preached to you the gospel of God for nought ?
ASV	2%20Corinthians	11	8	I robbed other churches , taking wages of them that I might minister unto you ;
ASV	2%20Corinthians	11	9	and when I was present with you and was in want , I was not a burden on any man ; for the brethren , when they came from Macedonia , supplied the measure of my want ; and in everything I kept myself from being burdensome unto you , and so will I keep myself .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	11	10	As the truth of Christ is in me , no man shall stop me of this glorying in the regions of Achaia .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	11	12	But what I do , that I will do , that I may cut off [ h ] occasion from them that desire an occasion ; that wherein they glory , they may be found even as we .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	11	13	For such men are false apostles , deceitful workers , fashioning themselves into apostles of Christ .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	11	14	And no marvel ; for even Satan fashioneth himself into an angel of light .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	11	15	It is no great thing therefore if his ministers also fashion themselves as ministers of righteousness ; whose end shall be according to their works .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	11	16	I say again , Let no man think me foolish ; but if ye do , yet as foolish receive me , that I also may glory a little .

ASV	2%20Corinthians	11	18	Seeing that many glory after the flesh , I will glory also .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	11	19	For ye bear with the foolish gladly , being wise yourselves .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	11	20	For ye bear with a man , if he bringeth you into bondage , if he devoureth you , if he taketh you captive , if he exalteth himself , if he smiteth you on the face .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	11	21	I speak by way of disparagement , as though we had been weak . Yet whereinsoever any is bold ( I speak in foolishness ) , I am bold also .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	11	22	Are they Hebrews ? so am I . Are they Israelites ? so am I . Are they the seed of Abraham ? so am I .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	11	23	Are they ministers of Christ ? ( I speak as one beside himself ) I more ; in labors more abundantly , in prisons more abundantly , in stripes above measure , in deaths oft .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	11	24	Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	11	25	Thrice was I beaten with rods , once was I stoned , thrice I suffered shipwreck , a night and a day have I been in the deep ;

ASV	2%20Corinthians	12	4	how that he was caught up into Paradise , and heard unspeakable words , which it is not lawful for a man to utter .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	12	5	On behalf of such a one will I glory : but on mine own behalf I will not glory , save in my weaknesses .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	12	6	For if I should desire to glory , I shall not be foolish ; for I shall speak the truth : but I forbear , lest any man should account of me above that which he seeth me to be , or heareth from me .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	12	7	And by reason of the exceeding greatness of the [ b ] revelations , that I should not be exalted overmuch , there was given to me a [ c ] thorn in the flesh , a messenger of Satan to buffet me , that I should not be exalted overmuch .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	12	8	Concerning this thing I besought the Lord thrice , that it might depart from me .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	12	9	And he hath said unto me , My grace is sufficient for thee : for my power is made perfect in weakness . Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my weaknesses , that the power of Christ may [ d ] rest upon me .

ASV	2%20Corinthians	12	13	For what is there wherein ye were made inferior to the rest of the churches , except it be that I myself was not a burden to you ? forgive me this wrong .
ASV	2%20Corinthians	12	14	Behold , this is the third time I am ready to come to you ; and I will not be a burden to you : for I seek not yours , but you : for the children ought not to lay up for the parents , but the parents for the children .

ASV	Galatians	2	9	and when they perceived the grace that was given unto me , [ i ] James and Cephas and John , they who [ j ] were reputed to be pillars , gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship , that we should go unto the Gentiles , and they unto the circumcision ;
ASV	Galatians	2	10	only they would that we should remember the poor ; which very thing I was also zealous to do .
ASV	Galatians	2	11	But when Cephas came to Antioch , I resisted him to the face , because he stood condemned .
ASV	Galatians	2	12	For before that certain came from James , he ate with the Gentiles ; but when they came , he drew back and separated himself , fearing them that were of the circumcision .
ASV	Galatians	2	13	And the rest of the Jews dissembled likewise with him ; insomuch that even Barnabas was carried away with their dissimulation .
ASV	Galatians	2	14	But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the [ k ] gospel , I said unto Cephas before them all , If thou , being a Jew , livest as do the Gentiles , and not as do the Jews , how compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews ?
ASV	Galatians	2	15	We being Jews by nature , and not sinners of the Gentiles ,
ASV	Galatians	2	16	yet knowing that a man is not [ l ] justified by the works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ , even we believed on Christ Jesus , that we might be justified by faith in Christ , and not by the works of the law : because by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified .
ASV	Galatians	2	17	But if , while we sought to be justified in Christ , we ourselves also were found sinners , is Christ a minister of sin ? God forbid .
ASV	Galatians	2	18	For if I build up again those things which I destroyed , I prove myself a transgressor .
ASV	Galatians	2	19	For I through the law died unto the law , that I might live unto God .
ASV	Galatians	2	20	I have been crucified with Christ ; and it is no longer I that live , but Christ liveth in me : and that life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith , the faith which is in the Son of God , who loved me , and gave himself up for me .
ASV	Galatians	2	21	I do not make void the grace of God : for if righteousness is through the law , then Christ died for nought .

ASV	Galatians	3	3	Are ye so foolish ? having begun in the Spirit , [ b ] are ye now perfected in the flesh ?
ASV	Galatians	3	2	This only would I learn from you , Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law , or by the [ a ] hearing of faith ?
ASV	Galatians	3	4	Did ye suffer so many things in vain ? if it be indeed in vain .
ASV	Galatians	3	5	He therefore that supplieth to you the Spirit , and worketh [ c ] miracles [ d ] among you , doeth he it by the works of the law , or by the [ e ] hearing of faith ?
ASV	Galatians	3	6	Even as Abraham [ f ] believed God , and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness .
ASV	Galatians	3	7	[ g ] Know therefore that they that are of faith , the same are sons of Abraham .
ASV	Galatians	3	8	And the scripture , foreseeing that God [ h ] would justify the [ i ] Gentiles by faith , preached the gospel beforehand unto Abraham , saying , [ j ] In thee shall all the nations be blessed .
ASV	Galatians	3	9	So then they that are of faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham .
ASV	Galatians	3	10	For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse : for it is written , [ k ] Cursed is every one who continueth not in all things that are written in the book of the law , to do them .
ASV	Galatians	3	11	Now that no man is justified [ l ] by the law before God , is evident : for , [ m ] The righteous shall live by faith ;
ASV	Galatians	3	12	and the law is not of faith ; but , [ n ] He that doeth them shall live in them .
ASV	Galatians	3	13	Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law , having become a curse for us ; for it is written , [ o ] Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree :
ASV	Galatians	3	14	that upon the Gentiles might come the blessing of Abraham in Christ Jesus ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith .
ASV	Galatians	3	15	Brethren , I speak after the manner of men : Though it be but a man ’ s covenant , yet when it hath been confirmed , no one maketh it void , or addeth thereto .
ASV	Galatians	3	16	Now to Abraham were the promises spoken , and to his seed . He saith not , And to seeds , as of many ; but as of one , [ p ] And to thy seed , which is Christ .
ASV	Galatians	3	17	Now this I say : A covenant confirmed beforehand by God , the law , which came four hundred and thirty years after , doth not disannul , so as to make the promise of none effect .
ASV	Galatians	3	18	For if the inheritance is of the law , it is no more of promise : but God hath granted it to Abraham by promise .
ASV	Galatians	3	19	What then is the law ? It was added because of transgressions , till the seed should come to whom the promise hath been made ; and it was ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator .
ASV	Galatians	3	20	Now a mediator is not a mediator of one ; but God is one .
ASV	Galatians	3	21	Is the law then against the promises of God ? God forbid : for if there had been a law given which could make alive , verily righteousness would have been of the law .
ASV	Galatians	3	22	But the scripture shut up all things under sin , that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe .
ASV	Galatians	3	23	But before faith came , we were kept in ward under the law , shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed .
ASV	Galatians	3	24	So that the law is become our tutor to bring us unto Christ , that we might be justified by faith .
ASV	Galatians	3	25	But now that faith is come , we are no longer under a tutor .
ASV	Galatians	3	26	For ye are all sons of God , through faith , in Christ Jesus .
ASV	Galatians	3	27	For as many of you as were baptized into Christ did put on Christ .
ASV	Galatians	3	28	There can be neither Jew nor Greek , there can be neither bond nor free , there can be no male and female ; for ye all are one man in Christ Jesus .
ASV	Galatians	3	29	And if ye are Christ ’ s , then are ye Abraham ’ s seed , heirs according to promise .

ASV	Galatians	4	5	that he might redeem them that were under the law , that we might receive the adoption of sons .
ASV	Galatians	4	6	And because ye are sons , God sent forth the Spirit of his Son into our hearts , crying , Abba , Father .
ASV	Galatians	4	7	So that thou art no longer a bondservant , but a son ; and if a son , then an heir through God .
ASV	Galatians	4	8	Howbeit at that time , not knowing God , ye were in bondage to them that by nature are no gods :
ASV	Galatians	4	9	but now that ye have come to know God , or rather to be known by God , how turn ye back again to the weak and beggarly [ b ] rudiments , whereunto ye desire to be in bondage over again ?
ASV	Galatians	4	10	Ye observe days , and months , and seasons , and years .
ASV	Galatians	4	11	I am afraid of you , lest by any means I have bestowed labor upon you in vain .
ASV	Galatians	4	12	.
ASV	Galatians	4	13	but ye know that because of an infirmity of the flesh I [ c ] preached the gospel unto you the [ d ] first time :
ASV	Galatians	4	14	and that which was a temptation to you in my flesh ye despised not , nor [ e ] rejected ; but ye received me as an angel of God , even as Christ Jesus .
ASV	Galatians	4	15	Where then is that gratulation [ f ] of yourselves ? for I bear you witness , that , if possible , ye would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me .
ASV	Galatians	4	16	So then am I become your enemy , [ g ] by telling you the truth ?
ASV	Galatians	4	17	They zealously seek you in no good way ; nay , they desire to shut you out , that ye may seek them .
ASV	Galatians	4	18	But it is good to be zealously sought in a good matter at all times , and not only when I am present with you .
ASV	Galatians	4	19	My little children , of whom I am again in travail until Christ be formed in you—
ASV	Galatians	4	20	but I could wish to be present with you now , and to change my tone ; for I am perplexed about you .
ASV	Galatians	4	21	Tell me , ye that desire to be under the law , do ye not hear the law ?
ASV	Galatians	4	22	For it is written , [ h ] that Abraham had two sons , one by the handmaid , and one by the freewoman .
ASV	Galatians	4	23	[ i ] Howbeit the son by the handmaid is born after the flesh ; but the son by the freewoman is born through promise .
ASV	Galatians	4	24	Which things contain an allegory : for these women are two covenants ; one from mount Sinai , bearing children unto bondage , which is Hagar .
ASV	Galatians	4	25	[ j ] Now this Hagar is mount Sinai in Arabia and answereth to the Jerusalem that now is : for she is in bondage with her children .
ASV	Galatians	4	26	But the Jerusalem that is above is free , which is our mother .
ASV	Galatians	4	27	For it is written , [ k ] Rejoice , thou barren that bearest not ; Break forth and cry , thou that travailest not : For more are the children of the desolate than of her that hath the husband .
ASV	Galatians	4	28	Now [ l ] we , brethren , as Isaac was , are children of promise .
ASV	Galatians	4	29	But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit , so also it is now .
ASV	Galatians	4	30	Howbeit what saith the scripture ? [ m ] Cast out the handmaid and her son : for the son of the handmaid shall not inherit with the son of the freewoman .
ASV	Galatians	4	31	Wherefore , brethren , we are not children of a handmaid , but of the freewoman . Footnotes - Galatians 4:3 Or , elements .
ASV	Galatians	5	5	For we through the Spirit by faith wait for the hope of righteousness .
ASV	Galatians	5	2	Behold , I Paul say unto you , that , if ye receive circumcision , Christ will profit you nothing .
ASV	Galatians	5	3	Yea , I testify again to every man that receiveth circumcision , that he is a debtor to do the whole law .
ASV	Galatians	5	4	Ye are [ a ] severed from Christ , ye who would be justified by the law ; ye are fallen away from grace .

ASV	Galatians	5	7	Ye were running well ; who hindered you that ye should not obey the truth ?
ASV	Galatians	5	8	This persuasion came not of him that calleth you .
ASV	Galatians	5	9	A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump .
ASV	Galatians	5	10	I have confidence to you-ward in the Lord , that ye will be none otherwise minded : but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment , whosoever he be .
ASV	Galatians	5	11	But I , brethren , if I still preach circumcision , why am I still persecuted ? then hath the stumbling-block of the cross been done away .
ASV	Galatians	5	12	I would that they that unsettle you would even [ c ] go beyond circumcision .
ASV	Galatians	5	13	For ye , brethren , were called for freedom ; only use not your freedom for an occasion to the flesh , but through love be servants one to another .
ASV	Galatians	5	14	For the whole law is fulfilled in one word , even in this : [ d ] Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself .
ASV	Galatians	5	15	But if ye bite and devour one another , take heed that ye be not consumed one of another .
ASV	Galatians	5	16	But I say , Walk by the Spirit , and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh .
ASV	Galatians	5	17	For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit , and the Spirit against the flesh ; for these are contrary the one to the other ; that ye may not do the things that ye would .
ASV	Galatians	5	18	But if ye are led by the Spirit , ye are not under the law .
ASV	Galatians	5	19	Now the works of the flesh are manifest , which are these : fornication , uncleanness , lasciviousness ,
ASV	Galatians	5	20	idolatry , sorcery , enmities , strife , jealousies , wraths , factions , divisions , [ e ] parties ,
ASV	Galatians	5	21	envyings , drunkenness , revellings , and such like ; of which I [ f ] forewarn you , even as I did [ g ] forewarn you , that they who practise such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God .
ASV	Galatians	5	22	But the fruit of the Spirit is love , joy , peace , longsuffering , kindness , goodness , faithfulness ,
ASV	Galatians	5	23	meekness , self-control ; against such there is no law .
ASV	Galatians	5	24	And they that are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts thereof .
ASV	Galatians	5	25	If we live by the Spirit , by the Spirit let us also walk .
ASV	Galatians	5	26	Let us not become vainglorious , [ h ] provoking one another , envying one another . Footnotes - Galatians 5:4 Greek brought to nought . Compare Rom . 7:2 ,
ASV	Galatians	6	6	But let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things .
ASV	Galatians	6	2	Bear ye one another ’ s burdens , and so fulfil the law of Christ .
ASV	Galatians	6	3	For if a man thinketh himself to be something when he is nothing , he deceiveth himself .
ASV	Galatians	6	4	But let each man prove his own work , and then shall he have his glorying in regard of himself alone , and not of [ b ] his neighbor .
ASV	Galatians	6	5	For each man shall bear his own [ c ] burden .
ASV	Galatians	6	7	Be not deceived ; God is not mocked : for whatsoever a man soweth , that shall he also reap .
ASV	Galatians	6	8	For he that soweth unto his own flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption ; but he that soweth unto the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap eternal life .
ASV	Galatians	6	9	And let us not be weary in well-doing : for in due season we shall reap , if we faint not .
ASV	Galatians	6	10	So then , [ d ] as we have opportunity , let us work that which is good toward all men , and especially toward them that are of the household of the faith .
ASV	Galatians	6	11	See with how large letters I [ e ] write unto you with mine own hand .
ASV	Galatians	6	12	As many as desire to make a fair show in the flesh , they compel you to be circumcised ; only that they may not be persecuted [ f ] for the cross of Christ .
ASV	Galatians	6	13	For not even they who [ g ] receive circumcision do themselves keep the law ; but they desire to have you circumcised , that they may glory in your flesh .
ASV	Galatians	6	14	But far be it from me to glory , save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ , through [ h ] which the world hath been crucified unto me , and I unto the world .
ASV	Galatians	6	15	For neither is circumcision anything , nor uncircumcision , but a new [ i ] creature .
ASV	Galatians	6	16	And as many as shall walk by this rule , peace be upon them , and mercy , and upon the Israel of God .
ASV	Galatians	6	17	Henceforth let no man trouble me ; for I bear branded on my body the marks of Jesus .

ASV	Ephesians	1	4	even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world , that we should be holy and without blemish before [ c ] him in love :
ASV	Ephesians	1	5	having foreordained us unto adoption as sons through Jesus Christ unto himself , according to the good pleasure of his will ,
ASV	Ephesians	1	6	to the praise of the glory of his grace , [ d ] which he freely bestowed on us in the Beloved :
ASV	Ephesians	1	7	in whom we have our redemption through his blood , the forgiveness of our trespasses , according to the riches of his grace ,
ASV	Ephesians	1	8	[ e ] which he made to abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence ,
ASV	Ephesians	1	9	making known unto us the mystery of his will , according to his good pleasure which he purposed in him
ASV	Ephesians	1	10	unto a dispensation of the fulness of the [ f ] times , to sum up all things in Christ , the things [ g ] in the heavens , and the things upon the earth ; in him , I say ,
ASV	Ephesians	1	11	in whom also we were made a heritage , having been foreordained according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his will ;
ASV	Ephesians	1	12	to the end that we should be unto the praise of his glory , we who [ h ] had before hoped in Christ :
ASV	Ephesians	1	13	in whom ye also , having heard the word of the truth , the [ i ] gospel of your salvation , —in whom , having also believed , ye were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise ,
ASV	Ephesians	1	14	which is an earnest of our inheritance , unto the redemption of God ’ s own possession , unto the praise of his glory .
ASV	Ephesians	1	15	For this cause I also , having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which is [ j ] among you , and [ k ] the love which ye show toward all the saints ,
ASV	Ephesians	1	16	cease not to give thanks for you , making mention of you in my prayers ;
ASV	Ephesians	1	17	that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of glory , may give unto you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him ;
ASV	Ephesians	1	18	having the eyes of your heart enlightened , that ye may know what is the hope of his calling , what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints ,
ASV	Ephesians	1	19	and what the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe , according to that working of the strength of his might
ASV	Ephesians	1	20	which he wrought in Christ , when he raised him from the dead , and made him to sit at his right hand in the heavenly places ,
ASV	Ephesians	1	21	far above all rule , and authority , and power , and dominion , and every name that is named , not only in this [ l ] world , but also in that which is to come :

ASV	Ephesians	2	4	but God , being rich in mercy , for his great love wherewith he loved us ,
ASV	Ephesians	2	5	even when we were dead through our trespasses , made us alive together [ d ] with Christ ( by grace have ye been saved ) ,
ASV	Ephesians	2	6	and raised us up with him , and made us to sit with him in the heavenly places , in Christ Jesus :
ASV	Ephesians	2	7	that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus :
ASV	Ephesians	2	8	for by grace have ye been saved through faith ; and that not of yourselves , it is the gift of God ;
ASV	Ephesians	2	9	not of works , that no man should glory .
ASV	Ephesians	2	10	For we are his workmanship , created in Christ Jesus for good works , which God afore prepared that we should walk in them .
ASV	Ephesians	2	11	Wherefore remember , that once ye , the Gentiles in the flesh , who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called Circumcision , in the flesh , made by hands ;
ASV	Ephesians	2	12	that ye were at that time separate from Christ , alienated from the commonwealth of Israel , and strangers from the covenants of the promise , having no hope and without God in the world .
ASV	Ephesians	2	13	But now in Christ Jesus ye that once were far off are made nigh in the blood of Christ .
ASV	Ephesians	2	14	For he is our peace , who made both one , and brake down the middle wall of partition ,
ASV	Ephesians	2	15	having abolished in his flesh the enmity , even the law of commandments contained in ordinances ; that he might create in himself of the two one new man , so making peace ;
ASV	Ephesians	2	16	and might reconcile them both in one body unto God through the cross , having slain the enmity thereby :
ASV	Ephesians	2	17	and he came and [ e ] preached peace to you that were far off , and peace to them that were nigh :
ASV	Ephesians	2	18	for through him we both have our access in one Spirit unto the Father .
ASV	Ephesians	2	19	So then ye are no more strangers and sojourners , but ye are fellow-citizens with the saints , and of the household of God ,
ASV	Ephesians	2	20	being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets , Christ Jesus himself being the chief corner stone ;
ASV	Ephesians	2	21	in whom [ f ] each several building , fitly framed together , groweth into a holy [ g ] temple in the Lord ;

ASV	Ephesians	3	5	which in other generations was not made known unto the sons of men , as it hath now been revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit ;
ASV	Ephesians	3	6	to wit , that the Gentiles are fellow-heirs , and fellow-members of the body , and fellow-partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the [ b ] gospel ,

ASV	Ephesians	3	8	Unto me , who am less than the least of all saints , was this grace given , to [ c ] preach unto the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ ;

ASV	Ephesians	3	10	to the intent that now unto the principalities and the powers in the heavenly places might be made known through the church the manifold wisdom of God ,

ASV	Ephesians	4	6	one God and Father of all , who is over all , and through all , and in all .
ASV	Ephesians	4	7	But unto each one of us was the grace given according to the measure of the gift of Christ .
ASV	Ephesians	4	8	Wherefore he saith , [ a ] When he ascended on high , he led captivity captive , And gave gifts unto men .
ASV	Ephesians	4	9	( Now this , He ascended , what is it but that he also descended [ b ] into the lower parts of the earth ?
ASV	Ephesians	4	10	He that descended is the same also that ascended far above all the heavens , that he might fill all things . )
ASV	Ephesians	4	11	And he gave some to be apostles ; and some , prophets ; and some , evangelists ; and some , pastors and teachers ;
ASV	Ephesians	4	12	for the perfecting of the saints , unto the work of ministering , unto the building up of the body of Christ :
ASV	Ephesians	4	13	till we all attain unto the unity of the faith , and of the knowledge of the Son of God , unto a fullgrown man , unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ :
ASV	Ephesians	4	14	that we may be no longer children , tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine , by the sleight of men , in craftiness , after the wiles of error ;
ASV	Ephesians	4	15	but [ c ] speaking truth in love , may grow up in all things into him , who is the head , even Christ ;
ASV	Ephesians	4	16	from whom all the body fitly framed and knit together [ d ] through that which every joint supplieth , according to the working in due measure of each several part , maketh the increase of the body unto the building up of itself in love .
ASV	Ephesians	4	17	This I say therefore , and testify in the Lord , that ye no longer walk as the Gentiles also walk , in the vanity of their mind ,
ASV	Ephesians	4	18	being darkened in their understanding , alienated from the life of God , because of the ignorance that is in them , because of the hardening of their heart ;
ASV	Ephesians	4	19	who being past feeling gave themselves up to lasciviousness , [ e ] to work all uncleanness with [ f ] greediness .
ASV	Ephesians	4	20	But ye did not so learn Christ ;
ASV	Ephesians	4	21	if so be that ye heard him , and were taught in him , even as truth is in Jesus :
ASV	Ephesians	4	22	that ye put away , as concerning your former manner of life , the old man , that waxeth corrupt after the lusts of deceit ;
ASV	Ephesians	4	23	and that ye be renewed in the spirit of your mind ,
ASV	Ephesians	4	24	and put on the new man , [ g ] that after God hath been created in righteousness and holiness of truth .
ASV	Ephesians	4	25	Wherefore , putting away falsehood , [ h ] speak ye truth each one with his neighbor : for we are members one of another .
ASV	Ephesians	4	26	[ i ] Be ye angry , and sin not : let not the sun go down upon your [ j ] wrath :
ASV	Ephesians	4	27	neither give place to the devil .
ASV	Ephesians	4	28	Let him that stole steal no more : but rather let him labor , working with his hands the thing that is good , that he may have whereof to give to him that hath need .
ASV	Ephesians	4	29	Let no corrupt speech proceed out of your mouth , but such as is good for [ k ] edifying as the need may be , that it may give grace to them that hear .
ASV	Ephesians	4	30	And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God , in whom ye were sealed unto the day of redemption .
ASV	Ephesians	4	31	Let all bitterness , and wrath , and anger , and clamor , and railing , be put away from you , with all malice :
ASV	Ephesians	4	32	and be ye kind one to another , tenderhearted , forgiving each other , even as God also in Christ forgave [ l ] you .

ASV	Ephesians	5	5	For this ye know of a surety , that no fornicator , nor unclean person , nor covetous man , who is an idolater , hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God .
ASV	Ephesians	5	2	and walk in love , even as Christ also loved you , and gave himself up for [ a ] us , an offering and a sacrifice to God for an odor of a sweet smell .
ASV	Ephesians	5	3	But fornication , and all uncleanness , or covetousness , let it not even be named among you , as becometh saints ;
ASV	Ephesians	5	4	nor filthiness , nor foolish talking , or jesting , which are not befitting : but rather giving of thanks .
ASV	Ephesians	5	6	Let no man deceive you with empty words : for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the sons of disobedience .
ASV	Ephesians	5	7	Be not ye therefore partakers with them ;
ASV	Ephesians	5	8	for ye were once darkness , but are now light in the Lord : walk as children of light
ASV	Ephesians	5	9	( for the fruit of the light is in all goodness and righteousness and truth ) ,
ASV	Ephesians	5	10	proving what is well-pleasing unto the Lord ;
ASV	Ephesians	5	11	and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness , but rather even [ b ] reprove them ;
ASV	Ephesians	5	12	for the things which are done by them in secret it is a shame even to speak of .
ASV	Ephesians	5	13	But all things when they are [ c ] reproved are made manifest by the light : for everything that is made manifest is light .
ASV	Ephesians	5	14	Wherefore he saith , [ d ] Awake , thou that sleepest , and arise from the dead , and Christ shall shine upon thee .
ASV	Ephesians	5	15	Look therefore carefully how ye walk , not as unwise , but as wise ;
ASV	Ephesians	5	16	[ e ] redeeming the time , because the days are evil .
ASV	Ephesians	5	17	Wherefore be ye not foolish , but understand what the will of the Lord is .
ASV	Ephesians	5	18	And be not drunken with wine , wherein is riot , but be filled [ f ] with the Spirit ;
ASV	Ephesians	5	19	speaking [ g ] one to another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs , singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord ;
ASV	Ephesians	5	20	giving thanks always for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to [ h ] God , even the Father ;
ASV	Ephesians	5	21	subjecting yourselves one to another in the fear of Christ .
ASV	Ephesians	5	22	Wives , be in subjection unto your own husbands , as unto the Lord .
ASV	Ephesians	5	23	For the husband is the head of the wife , as Christ also is the head of the church , being himself the saviour of the body .
ASV	Ephesians	5	24	But as the church is subject to Christ , [ i ] so let the wives also be to their husbands in everything .
ASV	Ephesians	5	25	Husbands , love your wives , even as Christ also loved the church , and gave himself up for it ;
ASV	Ephesians	5	26	that he might sanctify it , having cleansed it by the [ j ] washing of water with the word ,
ASV	Ephesians	5	27	that he might present the church to himself a glorious church , not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing ; but that it should be holy and without blemish .
ASV	Ephesians	5	28	Even so ought husbands also to love their own wives as their own bodies . He that loveth his own wife loveth himself :
ASV	Ephesians	5	29	for no man ever hated his own flesh ; but nourisheth and cherisheth it , even as Christ also the church ;
ASV	Ephesians	5	30	because we are members of his body .
ASV	Ephesians	5	31	[ k ] For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother , and shall cleave to his wife ; and the two shall become one flesh .
ASV	Ephesians	5	32	This mystery is great : but I speak in regard of Christ and of the church .
ASV	Ephesians	5	33	Nevertheless do ye also severally love each one his own wife even as himself ; and let the wife see that she fear her husband .

ASV	Ephesians	6	3	that it may be well with thee , and thou [ b ] mayest live long on the [ c ] earth .
ASV	Ephesians	6	4	And , ye fathers , provoke not your children to wrath : but nurture them in the chastening and admonition of the Lord .
ASV	Ephesians	6	5	[ d ] Servants , be obedient unto them that according to the flesh are your [ e ] masters , with fear and trembling , in singleness of your heart , as unto Christ ;
ASV	Ephesians	6	7	with good will doing service , as unto the Lord , and not unto men :
ASV	Ephesians	6	8	knowing that whatsoever good thing each one doeth , the same shall he receive again from the Lord , whether he be bond or free .
ASV	Ephesians	6	9	And , ye [ h ] masters , do the same things unto them , and forbear threatening : knowing that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven , and there is no respect of persons with him .
ASV	Ephesians	6	10	[ i ] Finally , [ j ] be strong in the Lord , and in the strength of his might .
ASV	Ephesians	6	11	Put on the whole armor of God , that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil .
ASV	Ephesians	6	12	For our wrestling is not against [ k ] flesh and blood , but against the principalities , against the powers , against the world-rulers of this darkness , against the spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places .
ASV	Ephesians	6	13	Wherefore take up the whole armor of God , that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day , and , having done all , to stand .
ASV	Ephesians	6	14	Stand therefore , having girded your loins with truth , and having put on the breastplate of righteousness ,
ASV	Ephesians	6	15	and having shod your feet with the preparation of the [ l ] gospel of peace ;

ASV	Ephesians	6	18	with all prayer and supplication praying at all seasons in the Spirit , and watching thereunto in all perseverance and supplication for all the saints ,
ASV	Ephesians	6	19	and on my behalf , that utterance may be given unto me [ m ] in opening my mouth , to make known with boldness the mystery of the [ n ] gospel ,
ASV	Ephesians	6	20	for which I am an ambassador in [ o ] chains ; that in it I may speak boldly , as I ought to speak .

ASV	Ephesians	6	22	whom I have sent unto you for this very purpose , that ye may know our state , and that he may comfort your hearts .

ASV	Philippians	1	1	Paul and Timothy , [ a ] servants of Christ Jesus , to all the saints in Christ Jesus that are at Philippi , with the [ b ] bishops and deacons :
ASV	Philippians	1	2	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
ASV	Philippians	1	3	I thank my God upon all my remembrance of you ,
ASV	Philippians	1	4	always in every supplication of mine on behalf of you all making my supplication with joy ,
ASV	Philippians	1	5	.
ASV	Philippians	1	6	being confident of this very thing , that he who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Jesus Christ :
ASV	Philippians	1	7	even as it is right for me to be thus minded on behalf of you all , because [ d ] I have you in my heart , inasmuch as , both in my bonds and in the defence and confirmation of the [ e ] gospel , ye all are partakers with me of grace .
ASV	Philippians	1	8	For God is my witness , how I long after you all in the tender mercies of Christ Jesus .
ASV	Philippians	1	9	And this I pray , that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and all discernment ;
ASV	Philippians	1	10	so that ye may [ f ] approve the things that are excellent ; that ye may be sincere and void of offence unto the day of Christ ;
ASV	Philippians	1	11	being filled with the [ g ] fruits of righteousness , which are through Jesus Christ , unto the glory and praise of God .
ASV	Philippians	1	12	Now I would have you know , brethren , that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the progress of the [ h ] gospel ;
ASV	Philippians	1	13	so that my bonds became manifest in Christ [ i ] throughout the whole praetorian guard , and to all the rest ;
ASV	Philippians	1	14	and that most of the brethren in the Lord , [ j ] being confident through my bonds , are more abundantly bold to speak the word of God without fear .
ASV	Philippians	1	15	Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife ; and some also of good will :
ASV	Philippians	1	16	[ k ] the one do it of love , knowing that I am set for the defence of the [ l ] gospel ;
ASV	Philippians	1	17	[ m ] but the other proclaim Christ of faction , not sincerely , thinking to raise up affliction for me in my bonds .
ASV	Philippians	1	18	What then ? only that in every way , whether in pretence or in truth , Christ is proclaimed ; and therein I rejoice , yea , and will rejoice .
ASV	Philippians	1	19	For I know that this shall turn out to my salvation , through your supplication and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ ,
ASV	Philippians	1	20	according to my earnest expectation and hope , that in nothing shall I be put to shame , but that with all boldness , as always , so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body , whether by life , or by death .
ASV	Philippians	1	21	For to me to live is Christ , and to die is gain .
ASV	Philippians	1	22	[ n ] But if to live in the flesh , —if [ o ] this shall bring fruit from my work , then [ p ] what I shall choose I know not .
ASV	Philippians	1	23	But I am in a strait betwixt the two , having the desire to depart and be with Christ ; for it is very far better :
ASV	Philippians	1	24	yet to abide in the flesh is more needful for your sake .
ASV	Philippians	1	25	And having this confidence , I know that I shall abide , yea , and abide with you all , for your progress and joy [ q ] in the faith ;
ASV	Philippians	1	26	that your glorying may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my presence with you again .
ASV	Philippians	1	27	Only [ r ] let your manner of life be worthy of the [ s ] gospel of Christ : that , whether I come and see you or be absent , I may hear of your state , that ye stand fast in one spirit , with one soul striving [ t ] for the faith of the [ u ] gospel ;
ASV	Philippians	1	28	and in nothing affrighted by the adversaries : which is for them an evident token of perdition , but of your salvation , and that from God ;
ASV	Philippians	1	29	because to you it hath been granted in the behalf of Christ , not only to believe on him , but also to suffer in his behalf :
ASV	Philippians	1	30	having the same conflict which ye saw in me , and now hear to be in me .

See marginal note on Mt . 4:23 . - Philippians 1:7 Or , ye have me in your heart - Philippians 1:7 Greek good tidings . See verse
ASV	Philippians	2	2	make full my joy , that ye be of the same mind , having the same love , being of one accord , [ b ] of one mind ;
ASV	Philippians	2	3	doing nothing through faction or through vainglory , but in lowliness of mind each counting other better than himself ;
ASV	Philippians	2	4	not looking each of you to his own things , but each of you also to the things of others .
ASV	Philippians	2	5	Have this mind in you , which was also in Christ Jesus :
ASV	Philippians	2	6	who , existing in the form of God , counted not the being on an equality with God a thing to be grasped ,
ASV	Philippians	2	7	but emptied himself , taking the form of a [ c ] servant , [ d ] being made in the likeness of men ;
ASV	Philippians	2	8	and being found in fashion as a man , he humbled himself , becoming obedient even unto death , yea , the death of the cross .
ASV	Philippians	2	9	Wherefore also God highly exalted him , and gave unto him the name which is above every name ;
ASV	Philippians	2	10	that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow , of things in heaven and things on earth and [ e ] things under the earth ,
ASV	Philippians	2	11	and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord , to the glory of God the Father .
ASV	Philippians	2	12	So then , my beloved , even as ye have always obeyed , not [ f ] as in my presence only , but now much more in my absence , work out your own salvation with fear and trembling ;
ASV	Philippians	2	13	for it is God who worketh in you both to will and to work , for his good pleasure .
ASV	Philippians	2	14	Do all things without murmurings and questionings :
ASV	Philippians	2	15	that ye may become blameless and harmless , children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation , among whom ye are seen as [ g ] lights in the world ,
ASV	Philippians	2	16	holding forth the word of life ; that I may have whereof to glory in the day of Christ , that I did not run in vain neither labor in vain .
ASV	Philippians	2	17	Yea , and if I am [ h ] offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith , I joy , and rejoice with you all :
ASV	Philippians	2	18	and in the same manner do ye also joy , and rejoice with me .
ASV	Philippians	2	19	But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy shortly unto you , that I also may be of good comfort , when I know your state .
ASV	Philippians	2	20	For I have no man likeminded , who will care [ i ] truly for your state .
ASV	Philippians	2	21	For they all seek their own , not the things of Jesus Christ .
ASV	Philippians	2	22	But ye know the proof of him , that , as a child serveth a father , so he served with me in furtherance of the [ j ] gospel .
ASV	Philippians	2	23	Him therefore I hope to send forthwith , so soon as I shall see how it will go with me :
ASV	Philippians	2	24	but I trust in the Lord that I myself also shall come shortly .
ASV	Philippians	2	25	But I counted it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus , my brother and fellow-worker and fellow-soldier , and your [ k ] messenger and minister to my need ;
ASV	Philippians	2	26	since he longed [ l ] after you all , and was sore troubled , because ye had heard that he was sick :
ASV	Philippians	2	27	for indeed he was sick nigh unto death : but God had mercy on him ; and not on him only , but on me also , that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow .
ASV	Philippians	2	28	I have sent him therefore the more diligently , that , when ye see him again , ye may rejoice , and that I may be the less sorrowful .
ASV	Philippians	2	29	Receive him therefore in the Lord with all joy ; and hold such in honor :
ASV	Philippians	2	30	because for the work of [ m ] Christ he came nigh unto death , hazarding his life to supply that which was lacking in your service toward me .

ASV	Philippians	3	3	for we are the circumcision , who worship by the Spirit of God , and glory in Christ Jesus , and have no confidence in the flesh :
ASV	Philippians	3	2	Beware of the dogs , beware of the evil workers , beware of the concision :
ASV	Philippians	3	4	though I myself might have confidence even in the flesh : if any other man [ a ] thinketh to have confidence in the flesh , I yet more :
ASV	Philippians	3	5	circumcised the eighth day , of the stock of Israel , of the tribe of Benjamin , a Hebrew of Hebrews ; as touching the law , a Pharisee ;
ASV	Philippians	3	6	as touching zeal , persecuting the church ; as touching the righteousness which is in the law , found blameless .
ASV	Philippians	3	7	Howbeit what things were [ b ] gain to me , these have I counted loss for Christ .
ASV	Philippians	3	8	Yea verily , and I count all things to be loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord : for whom I suffered the loss of all things , and do count them but refuse , that I may gain Christ ,
ASV	Philippians	3	9	and be found in him , [ c ] not having a righteousness of mine own , even that which is of the law , but that which is through faith in Christ , the righteousness which is from God [ d ] by faith :
ASV	Philippians	3	10	that I may know him , and the power of his resurrection , and the fellowship of his sufferings , becoming conformed unto his death ;
ASV	Philippians	3	11	if by any means I may attain unto the resurrection from the dead .
ASV	Philippians	3	12	Not that I have already obtained , or am already made perfect : but I press on , if so be that I may [ e ] lay hold on that for which also I was laid hold on by Christ Jesus .
ASV	Philippians	3	13	Brethren , I count not myself [ f ] yet to have laid hold : but one thing I do , forgetting the things which are behind , and stretching forward to the things which are before ,
ASV	Philippians	3	14	I press on toward the goal unto the prize of the [ g ] high calling of God in Christ Jesus .
ASV	Philippians	3	15	Let us therefore , as many as are [ h ] perfect , be thus minded : and if in anything ye are otherwise minded , this also shall God reveal unto you :
ASV	Philippians	3	16	only , whereunto we have attained , by that same rule let us walk .
ASV	Philippians	3	17	Brethren , be ye imitators together of me , and mark them that so walk even as ye have us for an ensample .
ASV	Philippians	3	18	For many walk , of whom I told you often , and now tell you even weeping , that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ :
ASV	Philippians	3	19	whose end is perdition , whose god is the belly , and whose glory is in their shame , who mind earthly things .
ASV	Philippians	3	20	For our [ i ] citizenship is in heaven ; whence also we wait for a Saviour , the Lord Jesus Christ :

ASV	Philippians	4	12	I know how to be abased , and I know also how to abound : in everything and in all things have I learned the secret both to be filled and to be hungry , both to abound and to be in want .

ASV	Philippians	4	17	Not that I seek for the gift ; but I seek for the fruit that increaseth to your account .
ASV	Philippians	4	18	But I have all things , and abound : I am filled , having received from Epaphroditus the things that came from you , an odor of a sweet smell , a sacrifice acceptable , well-pleasing to God .
ASV	Philippians	4	19	And my God shall supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus .

ASV	Colossians	1	2	[ b ] to the saints and faithful brethren in Christ that are at Colossae : Grace to you and peace from God our Father .
ASV	Colossians	1	3	We give thanks to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , praying always for you ,
ASV	Colossians	1	4	having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus , and of the love which ye have toward all the saints ,
ASV	Colossians	1	5	because of the hope which is laid up for you in the heavens , whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the [ c ] gospel ,
ASV	Colossians	1	6	which is come unto you ; even as it is also in all the world bearing fruit and increasing , as it doth in you also , since the day ye heard and knew the grace of God in truth ;
ASV	Colossians	1	7	even as ye learned of Epaphras our beloved fellow-servant , who is a faithful minister of Christ on [ d ] our behalf ,
ASV	Colossians	1	8	who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit .
ASV	Colossians	1	9	For this cause we also , since the day we heard it , do not cease to pray and make request for you , that ye may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding ,
ASV	Colossians	1	10	to walk worthily of the Lord [ e ] unto all pleasing , bearing fruit in every good work , and increasing [ f ] in the knowledge of God ;
ASV	Colossians	1	11	[ g ] strengthened [ h ] with all power , according to the might of his glory , unto all [ i ] patience and longsuffering with joy ;
ASV	Colossians	1	12	giving thanks unto the Father , who made [ j ] us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light ;
ASV	Colossians	1	13	who delivered us out of the power of darkness , and translated us into the kingdom of the Son of his love ;
ASV	Colossians	1	14	in whom we have our redemption , the forgiveness of our sins :
ASV	Colossians	1	15	who is the image of the invisible God , the firstborn of all creation ;
ASV	Colossians	1	16	for in him were all things created , in the heavens and upon the earth , things visible and things invisible , whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers ; all things have been created through him , and unto him ;
ASV	Colossians	1	17	and he is before all things , and in him all things [ k ] consist .
ASV	Colossians	1	18	And he is the head of the body , the church : who is the beginning , the firstborn from the dead ; [ l ] that in all things he might have the preeminence .
ASV	Colossians	1	19	[ m ] For it was the good pleasure of the Father that in him should all the fulness dwell ;
ASV	Colossians	1	20	and through him to reconcile all things [ n ] unto [ o ] himself , having made peace through the blood of his cross ; through him , I say , whether things upon the earth , or things in the heavens .
ASV	Colossians	1	21	And you , being in time past alienated and enemies in your mind in your evil works ,
ASV	Colossians	1	22	yet now [ p ] hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death , to present you holy and without blemish and unreproveable before him :
ASV	Colossians	1	23	if so be that ye continue in the faith , grounded and stedfast , and not moved away from the hope of the [ q ] gospel which ye heard , which was preached in all creation under heaven ; whereof I Paul was made a minister .
ASV	Colossians	1	24	Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake , and fill up on my part that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body ’ s sake , which is the church ;
ASV	Colossians	1	25	whereof I was made a minister , according to the [ r ] dispensation of God which was given me to you-ward , to fulfil the word of God ,
ASV	Colossians	1	26	even the mystery which hath been hid [ s ] for ages and generations : but now hath it been manifested to his saints ,
ASV	Colossians	1	27	to whom God was pleased to make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles , which is Christ in you , the hope of glory :
ASV	Colossians	1	28	whom we proclaim , admonishing every man and teaching every man in all wisdom , that we may present every man perfect in Christ ;

ASV	Colossians	2	2	that their hearts may be comforted , they being knit together in love , and unto all riches of the [ a ] full assurance of understanding , that they may know the mystery of God , [ b ] even Christ ,
ASV	Colossians	2	3	in whom are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge hidden .
ASV	Colossians	2	4	This I say , that no one may delude you with persuasiveness of speech .
ASV	Colossians	2	5	For though I am absent in the flesh , yet am I with you in the spirit , joying and beholding your order , and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ .
ASV	Colossians	2	6	As therefore ye received Christ Jesus the Lord , so walk in him ,
ASV	Colossians	2	7	rooted and builded up in him , and established [ c ] in your faith , even as ye were taught , abounding [ d ] in thanksgiving .
ASV	Colossians	2	8	[ e ] Take heed lest there shall be any one that maketh spoil of you through his philosophy and vain deceit , after the tradition of men , after the [ f ] rudiments of the world , and not after Christ :
ASV	Colossians	2	9	for in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily ,
ASV	Colossians	2	10	and in him ye are made full , who is the head of all principality and power :
ASV	Colossians	2	11	in whom ye were also circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands , in the putting off of the body of the flesh , in the circumcision of Christ ;
ASV	Colossians	2	12	having been buried with him in baptism , wherein ye were also raised with him through faith in the working of God , who raised him from the dead .
ASV	Colossians	2	13	And you , being dead through your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh , you , I say , did he make alive together with him , having forgiven us all our trespasses ;
ASV	Colossians	2	14	having blotted out [ g ] the bond written in ordinances that was against us , which was contrary to us : and he hath taken it out of the way , nailing it to the cross ;
ASV	Colossians	2	15	[ h ] having despoiled the principalities and the powers , he made a show of them openly , triumphing over them in it .
ASV	Colossians	2	16	Let no man therefore judge you in meat , or in drink , or in respect of a feast day or a new moon or a sabbath day :
ASV	Colossians	2	17	which are a shadow of the things to come ; but the body is Christ ’ s .
ASV	Colossians	2	18	Let no man rob you of your prize [ i ] by a voluntary humility and [ j ] worshipping of the angels , [ k ] dwelling in the things which he hath [ l ] seen , vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind ,
ASV	Colossians	2	19	and not holding fast the Head , from whom all the body , being supplied and knit together through the joints and bands , increaseth with the increase of God .
ASV	Colossians	2	20	If ye died with Christ from the [ m ] rudiments of the world , why , as though living in the world , do ye subject yourselves to ordinances ,
ASV	Colossians	2	21	Handle not , nor taste , nor touch
ASV	Colossians	2	22	( all which things are to perish with the using ) , after the precepts and doctrines of men ?
ASV	Colossians	2	23	Which things have indeed a show of wisdom in will-worship , and humility , and severity to the body ; but are not of any [ n ] value against the indulgence of the flesh .

ASV	Colossians	3	3	For ye died , and your life is hid with Christ in God .
ASV	Colossians	3	2	Set your mind on the things that are above , not on the things that are upon the earth .
ASV	Colossians	3	4	When Christ , who is [ a ] our life , shall be manifested , then shall ye also with him be manifested in glory .
ASV	Colossians	3	5	Put to death therefore your members which are upon the earth : fornication , uncleanness , passion , evil desire , and covetousness , which is idolatry ;
ASV	Colossians	3	6	for which things ’ sake cometh the wrath of God [ b ] upon the sons of disobedience :
ASV	Colossians	3	7	[ c ] wherein ye also once walked , when ye lived in these things ;
ASV	Colossians	3	8	but now do ye also put them all away : anger , wrath , malice , railing , shameful speaking out of your mouth :
ASV	Colossians	3	9	lie not one to another ; seeing that ye have put off the old man with his doings ,
ASV	Colossians	3	10	and have put on the new man , that is being renewed unto knowledge after the image of him that created him :
ASV	Colossians	3	11	where there can not be Greek and Jew , circumcision and uncircumcision , barbarian , Scythian , bondman , freeman ; but Christ is all , and in all .
ASV	Colossians	3	12	Put on therefore , as God ’ s elect , holy and beloved , a heart of compassion , kindness , lowliness , meekness , longsuffering ;
ASV	Colossians	3	13	forbearing one another , and forgiving each other , if any man have a complaint against any ; even as [ d ] the Lord forgave you , so also do ye :
ASV	Colossians	3	14	and above all these things put on love , which is the bond of perfectness .
ASV	Colossians	3	15	And let the peace of Christ [ e ] rule in your hearts , to the which also ye were called in one body ; and be ye thankful .
ASV	Colossians	3	16	Let the word of [ f ] Christ dwell in you [ g ] richly ; in all wisdom teaching and admonishing [ h ] one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs , singing with grace in your hearts unto God .
ASV	Colossians	3	17	And whatsoever ye do , in word or in deed , do all in the name of the Lord Jesus , giving thanks to God the Father through him .
ASV	Colossians	3	18	Wives , be in subjection to your husbands , as is fitting in the Lord .
ASV	Colossians	3	19	Husbands , love your wives , and be not bitter against them .
ASV	Colossians	3	20	Children , obey your parents in all things , for this is well-pleasing in the Lord .
ASV	Colossians	3	21	Fathers , provoke not your children , that they be not discouraged .
ASV	Colossians	3	22	[ i ] Servants , obey in all things them that are your [ j ] masters according to the flesh ; not with eye-service , as men-pleasers , but in singleness of heart , fearing the Lord :
ASV	Colossians	3	23	whatsoever ye do , work [ k ] heartily , as unto the Lord , and not unto men ;
ASV	Colossians	3	24	knowing that from the Lord ye shall receive the recompense of the inheritance : ye serve the Lord Christ .

ASV	1%20Thessalonians	1	4	knowing , brethren beloved of God , your election ,
ASV	1%20Thessalonians	1	5	[ c ] how that our [ d ] gospel came not unto you in word only , but also in power , and in the Holy Spirit , and in much [ e ] assurance ; even as ye know what manner of men we showed ourselves toward you for your sake .
ASV	1%20Thessalonians	1	6	And ye became imitators of us , and of the Lord , having received the word in much affliction , with joy of the Holy Spirit ;
ASV	1%20Thessalonians	1	7	so that ye became an ensample to all that believe in Macedonia and in Achaia .
ASV	1%20Thessalonians	1	8	For from you hath sounded forth the word of the Lord , not only in Macedonia and Achaia , but in every place your faith to God-ward is gone forth ; so that we need not to speak anything .
ASV	1%20Thessalonians	1	9	For they themselves report concerning us what manner of entering in we had unto you ; and how ye turned unto God from idols , to serve a living and true God ,
ASV	1%20Thessalonians	1	10	and to wait for his Son from heaven , whom he raised from the dead , even Jesus , who delivereth us from the wrath to come . Footnotes -

ASV	1%20Thessalonians	2	8	even so , being affectionately desirous of you , we were well pleased to impart unto you , not the [ e ] gospel of God only , but also our own souls , because ye were become very dear to us .
ASV	1%20Thessalonians	2	9	; compare
ASV	1%20Thessalonians	2	10	Ye are witnesses , and God also , how holily and righteously and unblamably we behaved ourselves toward you that believe :

ASV	1%20Thessalonians	2	12	to the end that ye should walk worthily of God , who [ g ] calleth you into his own kingdom and glory .
ASV	1%20Thessalonians	2	13	And for this cause we also thank God without ceasing , that , when ye received from us [ h ] the word of the message , even the word of God , ye accepted it not as the word of men , but , as it is in truth , the word of God , which also worketh in you that believe .
ASV	1%20Thessalonians	2	14	For ye , brethren , became imitators of the churches of God which are in Judaea in Christ Jesus : for ye also suffered the same things of your own countrymen , even as they did of the Jews ;
ASV	1%20Thessalonians	2	15	who both killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets , and drove out us , and please not God , and are contrary to all men ;
ASV	1%20Thessalonians	2	16	forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they may be saved ; to fill up their sins always : but the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost .
ASV	1%20Thessalonians	2	17	But we , brethren , being bereaved of you for [ i ] a short season , in presence not in heart , endeavored the more exceedingly to see your face with great desire :

ASV	1%20Thessalonians	4	6	that no man [ b ] transgress , and wrong his brother in the matter : because the Lord is an avenger in all these things , as also we [ c ] forewarned you and testified .

ASV	1%20Thessalonians	5	4	But ye , brethren , are not in darkness , that that day should overtake you [ a ] as a thief :
ASV	1%20Thessalonians	5	6	so then let us not sleep , as do the rest , but let us watch and be sober .
ASV	1%20Thessalonians	5	7	For they that sleep sleep in the night ; and they that are drunken are drunken in the night .
ASV	1%20Thessalonians	5	8	But let us , since we are of the day , be sober , putting on the breastplate of faith and love ; and for a helmet , the hope of salvation .

ASV	2%20Thessalonians	2	6	And now ye know that which restraineth , to the end that he may be revealed in his own season .
ASV	2%20Thessalonians	2	7	For the mystery of lawlessness doth already work : [ f ] only there is one that restraineth now , until he be taken out of the way .
ASV	2%20Thessalonians	2	8	And then shall be revealed the lawless one , whom the Lord [ g ] Jesus shall [ h ] slay with the breath of his mouth , and bring to nought by the manifestation of his [ i ] coming ;

ASV	2%20Thessalonians	2	13	But we are bound to give thanks to God always for you , brethren beloved of the Lord , for that God chose you [ m ] from the beginning unto salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and [ n ] belief of the truth :
ASV	2%20Thessalonians	2	14	whereunto he called you through our [ o ] gospel , to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ .

ASV	2%20Thessalonians	3	6	Now we command you , brethren , in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly , and not after the tradition which [ c ] they received of us .
ASV	2%20Thessalonians	3	7	For yourselves know how ye ought to imitate us : for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you ;
ASV	2%20Thessalonians	3	8	neither did we eat bread for nought at any man ’ s hand , but in labor and travail , working night and day , that we might not burden any of you :
ASV	2%20Thessalonians	3	9	not because we have not the right , but to make ourselves an ensample unto you , that ye should imitate us .
ASV	2%20Thessalonians	3	10	For even when we were with you , this we commanded you , If any will not work , neither let him eat .
ASV	2%20Thessalonians	3	11	For we hear of some that walk among you disorderly , that work not at all , but are busybodies .
ASV	2%20Thessalonians	3	12	Now them that are such we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ , that with quietness they work , and eat their own bread .

ASV	1%20Timothy	1	3	As I exhorted thee to tarry at Ephesus , when I was going into Macedonia , that thou mightest charge certain men not to teach a different doctrine ,
ASV	1%20Timothy	1	4	neither to give heed to fables and endless genealogies , which minister questionings , rather than a [ a ] dispensation of God which is in faith ; so do I now .
ASV	1%20Timothy	1	5	But the end of the charge is love out of a pure heart and a good conscience and faith unfeigned :
ASV	1%20Timothy	1	6	from which things some having [ b ] swerved have turned aside unto vain talking ;
ASV	1%20Timothy	1	7	desiring to be teachers of the law , though they understand neither what they say , nor whereof they confidently affirm .
ASV	1%20Timothy	1	8	But we know that the law is good , if a man use it lawfully ,
ASV	1%20Timothy	1	9	as knowing this , that law is not made for a righteous man , but for the lawless and unruly , for the ungodly and sinners , for the unholy and profane , for [ c ] murderers of fathers and [ d ] murderers of mothers , for manslayers ,
ASV	1%20Timothy	1	10	for fornicators , for abusers of themselves with men , for menstealers , for liars , for false swearers , and if there be any other thing contrary to the [ e ] sound [ f ] doctrine ;
ASV	1%20Timothy	1	11	according to the [ g ] gospel of the glory of the blessed God , which was committed to my trust .
ASV	1%20Timothy	1	12	I thank him that [ h ] enabled me , even Christ Jesus our Lord , for that he counted me faithful , appointing me to his service ;
ASV	1%20Timothy	1	13	though I was before a blasphemer , and a persecutor , and injurious : howbeit I obtained mercy , because I did it ignorantly in unbelief ;
ASV	1%20Timothy	1	14	and the grace of our Lord abounded exceedingly with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus .
ASV	1%20Timothy	1	15	Faithful is the saying , and worthy of all acceptation , that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners ; of whom I am chief :
ASV	1%20Timothy	1	16	howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy , that in me as chief might Jesus Christ show forth all his longsuffering , for an ensample of them that should thereafter believe on him unto eternal life .
ASV	1%20Timothy	1	17	Now unto the King [ i ] eternal , [ j ] immortal , invisible , the only God , be honor and glory [ k ] for ever and ever . Amen .
ASV	1%20Timothy	1	18	This charge I commit unto thee , my child Timothy , according to the prophecies which led the way to thee , that by them thou mayest war the good warfare ;
ASV	1%20Timothy	1	19	holding faith and a good conscience ; which some having thrust from them made shipwreck concerning the faith :

ASV	1%20Timothy	2	2	for kings and all that are in high place ; that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and gravity .
ASV	1%20Timothy	2	3	This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour ;
ASV	1%20Timothy	2	4	who would have all men to be saved , and come to the knowledge of the truth .
ASV	1%20Timothy	2	5	For there is one God , one mediator also between God and men , himself man , Christ Jesus ,
ASV	1%20Timothy	2	6	who gave himself a ransom for all ; the testimony to be borne in its own times ;
ASV	1%20Timothy	2	7	whereunto I was appointed a [ b ] preacher and an apostle ( I speak the truth , I lie not ) , a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth .
ASV	1%20Timothy	2	8	I desire therefore that the men pray in every place , lifting up holy hands , without wrath and [ c ] disputing .
ASV	1%20Timothy	2	9	In like manner , that women adorn themselves in modest apparel , with shamefastness and sobriety ; not with braided hair , and gold or pearls or costly raiment ;
ASV	1%20Timothy	2	10	but ( which becometh women professing godliness ) through good works .
ASV	1%20Timothy	2	11	Let a woman learn in quietness with all subjection .
ASV	1%20Timothy	2	12	But I permit not a woman to teach , nor to have dominion over a man , but to be in quietness .
ASV	1%20Timothy	2	13	For Adam was first formed , then Eve ;

ASV	1%20Timothy	3	4	one that ruleth well his own house , having his children in subjection with all gravity ;
ASV	1%20Timothy	3	5	( but if a man knoweth not how to rule his own house , how shall he take care of the church of God ? )
ASV	1%20Timothy	3	6	not a novice , lest being puffed up he fall into the [ d ] condemnation of the devil .
ASV	1%20Timothy	3	7	Moreover he must have good testimony from them that are without ; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil .
ASV	1%20Timothy	3	8	Deacons in like manner must be grave , not double-tongued , not given to much wine , not greedy of filthy lucre ;
ASV	1%20Timothy	3	9	holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience .
ASV	1%20Timothy	3	10	And let these also first be proved ; then let them serve as deacons , if they be blameless .

ASV	1%20Timothy	3	12	Let deacons be husbands of one wife , ruling their children and their own houses well .
ASV	1%20Timothy	3	13	For they that have served well as deacons gain to themselves a good standing , and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus .
ASV	1%20Timothy	3	14	These things write I unto thee , hoping to come unto thee shortly ;
ASV	1%20Timothy	3	15	but if I tarry long , that thou mayest know [ e ] how men ought to behave themselves in the house of God , which is the church of the living God , the pillar and [ f ] ground of the truth .

ASV	1%20Timothy	4	4	For every creature of God is good , and nothing is to be rejected , if it be received with thanksgiving :

ASV	1%20Timothy	4	3	forbidding to marry , and commanding to abstain from meats , which God created to be received with thanksgiving by them that believe and know the truth .
ASV	1%20Timothy	4	5	for it is sanctified through the word of God and prayer .
ASV	1%20Timothy	4	6	If thou put the brethren in mind of these things , thou shalt be a good minister of Christ Jesus , nourished in the words of the faith , and of the good doctrine which thou hast followed until now :
ASV	1%20Timothy	4	7	but refuse profane and old wives ’ fables . And exercise thyself unto godliness :
ASV	1%20Timothy	4	8	for bodily exercise is profitable [ b ] for a little ; but godliness is profitable for all things , having promise of the life which now is , and of that which is to come .
ASV	1%20Timothy	4	9	Faithful is the saying , and worthy of all acceptation .
ASV	1%20Timothy	4	10	For to this end we labor and strive , because we have our hope set on the living God , who is the Saviour of all men , specially of them that believe .
ASV	1%20Timothy	4	11	These things command and teach .

ASV	1%20Timothy	5	3	Honor widows that are widows indeed .
ASV	1%20Timothy	5	4	But if any widow hath children or grandchildren , let them learn first to show piety towards their own family , and to requite their parents : for this is acceptable in the sight of God .
ASV	1%20Timothy	5	6	But she that giveth herself to pleasure is dead while she liveth .
ASV	1%20Timothy	5	7	These things also command , that they may be without reproach .
ASV	1%20Timothy	5	8	But if any provideth not for his own , and specially his own household , he hath denied the faith , and is worse than an unbeliever .
ASV	1%20Timothy	5	9	Let none be enrolled as a widow under threescore years old , having been the wife of one man ,
ASV	1%20Timothy	5	10	well reported of for good works ; if she hath brought up children , if she hath used hospitality to strangers , if she hath washed the saints ’ feet , if she hath relieved the afflicted , if she hath diligently followed every good work .
ASV	1%20Timothy	5	11	But younger widows refuse : for when they have waxed wanton against Christ , they desire to marry ;
ASV	1%20Timothy	5	12	having condemnation , because they have rejected their first [ a ] pledge .
ASV	1%20Timothy	5	13	And withal they learn also to be idle , going about from house to house ; and not only idle , but tattlers also and busybodies , speaking things which they ought not .
ASV	1%20Timothy	5	14	I desire therefore that the younger [ b ] widows marry , bear children , rule the household , give no occasion to the adversary for reviling :
ASV	1%20Timothy	5	15	for already some are turned aside after Satan .
ASV	1%20Timothy	5	16	If any woman that believeth hath widows , let her relieve them , and let not the church be burdened ; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed .
ASV	1%20Timothy	5	17	Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor , especially those who labor in the word and in teaching .

ASV	1%20Timothy	5	21	I charge thee in the sight of God , and Christ Jesus , and the elect angels , that thou observe these things without [ d ] prejudice , doing nothing by partiality .
ASV	1%20Timothy	5	22	Lay hands hastily on no man , neither be partaker of other men ’ s sins : keep thyself pure .

ASV	1%20Timothy	6	3	If any man teacheth a different doctrine , and consenteth not to [ c ] sound words , even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ , and to the doctrine which is according to godliness ;

ASV	Hebrews	4	14	Having then a great high priest , who hath passed through the heavens , Jesus the Son of God , let us hold fast our confession .
ASV	Hebrews	4	15	For we have not a high priest that can not be touched with the feeling of our infirmities ; but one that hath been in all points tempted like as we are , yet without sin .
ASV	Hebrews	4	16	Let us therefore draw near with boldness unto the throne of grace , that we may receive mercy , and may find grace to help us in time of need .

ASV	Hebrews	5	5	So Christ also glorified not himself to be made a high priest , but he that spake unto him , [ a ] Thou art my Son , This day have I begotten thee :
ASV	Hebrews	5	2	who can bear gently with the ignorant and erring , for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity ;
ASV	Hebrews	5	3	and by reason thereof is bound , as for the people , so also for himself , to offer for sins .
ASV	Hebrews	5	4	And no man taketh the honor unto himself , but when he is called of God , even as was Aaron .
ASV	Hebrews	5	6	as he saith also in another place , [ b ] Thou art a priest for ever After the order of Melchizedek .
ASV	Hebrews	5	7	Who in the days of his flesh , having offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him [ c ] from death , and having been heard for his godly fear ,
ASV	Hebrews	5	8	though he was a Son , yet learned obedience by the things which he suffered ;
ASV	Hebrews	5	9	and having been made perfect , he became unto all them that obey him the [ d ] author of eternal salvation ;
ASV	Hebrews	5	10	named of God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek .
ASV	Hebrews	5	11	Of [ e ] whom we have many things to say , and hard of interpretation , seeing ye are become dull of hearing .
ASV	Hebrews	5	12	For when by reason of the time ye ought to be teachers , ye have need again [ f ] that some one teach you the rudiments of the [ g ] first principles of the oracles of God ; and are become such as have need of milk , and not of solid food .
ASV	Hebrews	5	13	For every one that partaketh of milk is [ h ] without experience of the word of righteousness ; for he is a babe .
ASV	Hebrews	5	14	But solid food is for [ i ] fullgrown men , even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern good and evil .

ASV	Hebrews	6	6	and then fell away , it is impossible to renew them again unto repentance ; [ g ] seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh , and put him to an open shame .
ASV	Hebrews	6	2	[ c ] of the teaching of [ d ] baptisms , and of laying on of hands , and of resurrection of the dead , and of eternal judgment .
ASV	Hebrews	6	3	And this will we do , if God permit .
ASV	Hebrews	6	4	For as touching those who were once enlightened [ e ] and tasted of the heavenly gift , and were made partakers of the Holy Spirit ,
ASV	Hebrews	6	5	and [ f ] tasted the good word of God , and the powers of the age to come ,
ASV	Hebrews	6	7	For the land which hath drunk the rain that cometh oft upon it , and bringeth forth herbs meet for them for whose sake it is also tilled , receiveth blessing from God :
ASV	Hebrews	6	8	but if it beareth thorns and thistles , it is rejected and nigh unto a curse ; whose end is to be burned .
ASV	Hebrews	6	9	But , beloved , we are persuaded better things of you , and things that [ h ] accompany salvation , though we thus speak :
ASV	Hebrews	6	10	for God is not unrighteous to forget your work and the love which ye showed toward his name , in that ye ministered unto the saints , and still do minister .
ASV	Hebrews	6	11	And we desire that each one of you may show the same diligence unto the [ i ] fulness of hope even to the end :
ASV	Hebrews	6	12	that ye be not sluggish , but imitators of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises .
ASV	Hebrews	6	13	For when God made promise to Abraham , since he could swear by none greater , he sware by himself ,
ASV	Hebrews	6	14	saying , [ j ] Surely blessing I will bless thee , and multiplying I will multiply thee .
ASV	Hebrews	6	15	And thus , having patiently endured , he obtained the promise .
ASV	Hebrews	6	16	For men swear by the greater : and in every dispute of theirs the oath is final for confirmation .
ASV	Hebrews	6	17	Wherein God , being minded to show more abundantly unto the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel , [ k ] interposed with an oath ;
ASV	Hebrews	6	18	that by two immutable things , in which it is impossible for God to lie , we may have a strong encouragement , who have fled for refuge to lay hold of the hope set before us :
ASV	Hebrews	6	19	which we have as an anchor of the soul , a hope both sure and stedfast and entering into that which is within the veil ;
ASV	Hebrews	6	20	whither as a forerunner Jesus entered for us , having become a high priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek .

ASV	Hebrews	7	7	But without any dispute the less is blessed of the better .
ASV	Hebrews	7	2	to whom also Abraham divided a tenth part of all ( being first , by interpretation , King of righteousness , and then also King of Salem , which is , King of peace ;
ASV	Hebrews	7	3	without father , without mother , without genealogy , having neither beginning of days nor end of life , but made like unto the Son of God ) , abideth a priest continually .
ASV	Hebrews	7	4	Now consider how great this man was , unto whom Abraham , the patriarch , gave a tenth out of the chief spoils .
ASV	Hebrews	7	5	And they indeed of the sons of Levi that receive the priest ’ s office have commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law , that is , of their brethren , though these have come out of the loins of Abraham :
ASV	Hebrews	7	6	but he whose genealogy is not counted from them hath taken tithes of Abraham , and hath blessed him that hath the promises .
ASV	Hebrews	7	8	And here men that die receive tithes ; but there one , of whom it is witnessed that he liveth .
ASV	Hebrews	7	9	And , so to say , through Abraham even Levi , who receiveth tithes , hath paid tithes ;
ASV	Hebrews	7	10	for he was yet in the loins of his father , when Melchizedek met him .
ASV	Hebrews	7	11	Now if there was perfection through the Levitical priesthood ( for under it hath the people received the law ) , what further need was there that another priest should arise after the order of Melchizedek , and not be reckoned after the order of Aaron ?
ASV	Hebrews	7	12	For the priesthood being changed , there is made of necessity a change also of the law .
ASV	Hebrews	7	13	For he of whom these things are said [ a ] belongeth to another tribe , from which no man hath given attendance at the altar .
ASV	Hebrews	7	14	For it is evident that our Lord hath sprung out of Judah ; as to which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priests .
ASV	Hebrews	7	15	And what we say is yet more abundantly evident , if after the likeness of Melchizedek there ariseth another priest ,
ASV	Hebrews	7	16	who hath been made , not after the law of a carnal commandment , but after the power of an [ b ] endless life :
ASV	Hebrews	7	17	for it is witnessed of him , [ c ] Thou art a priest for ever After the order of Melchizedek .
ASV	Hebrews	7	18	For there is a disannulling of a foregoing commandment because of its weakness and unprofitableness
ASV	Hebrews	7	19	( for the law made nothing perfect ) , and a bringing in thereupon of a better hope , through which we draw nigh unto God .
ASV	Hebrews	7	20	And inasmuch as it is not without the taking of an oath
ASV	Hebrews	7	21	( for they indeed have been made priests without an oath ; but he with an oath [ d ] by him that saith [ e ] of him , [ f ] The Lord sware and will not repent himself , Thou art a priest for ever ) ;
ASV	Hebrews	7	22	by so much also hath Jesus become the surety of a better covenant .
ASV	Hebrews	7	23	And they indeed have been made priests many in number , because that by death they are hindered from continuing :
ASV	Hebrews	7	24	but he , because he abideth for ever , [ g ] hath his priesthood [ h ] unchangeable .
ASV	Hebrews	7	25	Wherefore also he is able to save [ i ] to the uttermost them that draw near unto God through him , seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them .
ASV	Hebrews	7	26	For such a high priest became us , holy , guileless , undefiled , separated from sinners , and made higher than the heavens ;
ASV	Hebrews	7	27	who needeth not daily , like those high priests , to offer up sacrifices , first for his own sins , and then for the sins of the people : for this he did once for all , when he offered up himself .
ASV	Hebrews	7	28	For the law appointeth men high priests , having infirmity ; but the word of the oath , which was after the law , appointeth a Son , perfected for evermore .

ASV	Hebrews	8	8	For [ f ] finding fault with them , he saith , [ g ] Behold , the days come , saith the Lord , That I will [ h ] make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah ;
ASV	Hebrews	8	2	a minister of [ c ] the sanctuary , and of the true tabernacle , which the Lord pitched , not man .
ASV	Hebrews	8	3	For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices : wherefore it is necessary that this high priest also have somewhat to offer .
ASV	Hebrews	8	4	Now if he were on earth , he would not be a priest at all , seeing there are those who offer the gifts according to the law ;
ASV	Hebrews	8	5	who serve that which is a copy and shadow of the heavenly things , even as Moses is warned of God when he is about to [ d ] make the tabernacle : for , [ e ] See , saith he , that thou make all things according to the pattern that was showed thee in the mount .
ASV	Hebrews	8	6	But now hath he obtained a ministry the more excellent , by so much as he is also the mediator of a better covenant , which hath been enacted upon better promises .
ASV	Hebrews	8	7	For if that first covenant had been faultless , then would no place have been sought for a second .
ASV	Hebrews	8	9	Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers In the day that I took them by the hand to lead them forth out of the land of Egypt ; For they continued not in my covenant , And I regarded them not , saith the Lord .
ASV	Hebrews	8	10	For this is the covenant that [ i ] I will make with the house of Israel After those days , saith the Lord ; I will put my laws into their mind , And on their heart also will I write them : And I will be to them a God , And they shall be to me a people :
ASV	Hebrews	8	11	And they shall not teach every man his fellow-citizen , And every man his brother , saying , Know the Lord : For all shall know me , From the least to the greatest of them .
ASV	Hebrews	8	12	For I will be merciful to their iniquities , And their sins will I remember no more .
ASV	Hebrews	8	13	In that he saith , A new covenant , he hath made the first old . But that which is becoming old and waxeth aged is nigh unto vanishing away .

ASV	Hebrews	9	9	which is a figure for the time present ; according to which are offered both gifts and sacrifices that can not , as touching the conscience , make the worshipper perfect ,
ASV	Hebrews	9	2	Tim . 4:8 .
ASV	Hebrews	9	3	And after the second veil , the tabernacle which is called the Holy of holies ;
ASV	Hebrews	9	4	having a golden [ c ] altar of incense , and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold , wherein [ d ] was a golden pot holding the manna , and Aaron ’ s rod that budded , and the tables of the covenant ;
ASV	Hebrews	9	5	and above it cherubim of glory overshadowing [ e ] the mercy-seat ; of which things we can not now speak severally .
ASV	Hebrews	9	6	Now these things having been thus prepared , the priests go in continually into the first tabernacle , accomplishing the services ;
ASV	Hebrews	9	7	but into the second the high priest alone , once in the year , not without blood , which he offereth for himself , and for the [ f ] errors of the people :
ASV	Hebrews	9	8	the Holy Spirit this signifying , that the way into the holy place hath not yet been made manifest , while the first tabernacle is yet standing ;
ASV	Hebrews	9	10	being only ( with meats and drinks and divers washings ) carnal ordinances , imposed until a time of reformation .
ASV	Hebrews	9	11	But Christ having come a high priest of [ g ] the good things to come , through the greater and more perfect tabernacle , not made with hands , that is to say , not of this creation ,
ASV	Hebrews	9	12	nor yet through the blood of goats and calves , but through his own blood , entered in once for all into the holy place , having obtained eternal redemption .
ASV	Hebrews	9	13	For if the blood of goats and bulls , and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling them that have been defiled , sanctify unto the cleanness of the flesh :
ASV	Hebrews	9	14	how much more shall the blood of Christ , who through [ h ] the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish unto God , cleanse [ i ] your conscience from dead works to serve the living God ?
ASV	Hebrews	9	15	And for this cause he is the mediator of a new [ j ] covenant , that a death having taken place for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first [ k ] covenant , they that have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance .
ASV	Hebrews	9	16	For where a [ l ] testament is , there must of necessity [ m ] be the death of him that made it .
ASV	Hebrews	9	17	For a [ n ] testament is of force [ o ] where there hath been death : [ p ] for it doth never avail while he that made it liveth .
ASV	Hebrews	9	18	Wherefore even the first covenant hath not been dedicated without blood .
ASV	Hebrews	9	19	For when every commandment had been spoken by Moses unto all the people according to the law , he took the blood of the calves and the goats , with water and scarlet wool and hyssop , and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people ,
ASV	Hebrews	9	20	saying , [ q ] This is the blood of the [ r ] covenant which God commanded to you-ward .
ASV	Hebrews	9	21	Moreover the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry he sprinkled in like manner with the blood .
ASV	Hebrews	9	22	And according to the law , I may almost say , all things are cleansed with blood , and apart from shedding of blood there is no remission .
ASV	Hebrews	9	23	It was necessary therefore that the copies of the things in the heavens should be cleansed with these ; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these .
ASV	Hebrews	9	24	For Christ entered not into a holy place made with hands , like in pattern to the true ; but into heaven itself , now to appear before the face of God for us :
ASV	Hebrews	9	25	nor yet that he should offer himself often , as the high priest entereth into the holy place year by year with blood not his own ;
ASV	Hebrews	9	26	else must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world : but now once at the [ s ] end of the ages hath he been manifested to put away sin [ t ] by the sacrifice of himself .
ASV	Hebrews	9	27	And inasmuch as it is [ u ] appointed unto men once to die , and after this cometh judgment ;
ASV	Hebrews	9	28	so Christ also , having been once offered to bear the sins of many , shall appear a second time , apart from sin , to them that wait for him , unto salvation . Footnotes - Hebrews 9:2 Or , are - Hebrews 9:2 Greek the setting forth of the loaves . - Hebrews 9:4 Or , censer .
ASV	Hebrews	10	10	[ c ] By which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all .
ASV	Hebrews	10	2	Else would they not have ceased to be offered ? because the worshippers , having been once cleansed , would have had no more consciousness of sins .
ASV	Hebrews	10	3	But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance made of sins year by year .
ASV	Hebrews	10	4	For it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins .
ASV	Hebrews	10	5	Wherefore when he cometh into the world , he saith , [ b ] Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not , But a body didst thou prepare for me ;
ASV	Hebrews	10	6	In whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hadst no pleasure :
ASV	Hebrews	10	7	Then said I , Lo , I am come ( In the roll of the book it is written of me ) To do thy will , O God .
ASV	Hebrews	10	8	Saying above , Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou wouldest not , neither hadst pleasure therein ( the which are offered according to the law ) ,
ASV	Hebrews	10	9	then hath he said , Lo , I am come to do thy will . He taketh away the first , that he may establish the second .
ASV	Hebrews	10	11	And every [ d ] priest indeed standeth day by day ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices , the which can never take away sins :
ASV	Hebrews	10	12	but he , when he had offered one sacrifice for [ e ] sins for ever , sat down on the right hand of God ;
ASV	Hebrews	10	13	henceforth expecting till his enemies be made the footstool of his feet .
ASV	Hebrews	10	14	For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified .
ASV	Hebrews	10	15	And the Holy Spirit also beareth witness to us ; for after he hath said ,
ASV	Hebrews	10	16	[ f ] This is the covenant that [ g ] I will make with them After those days , saith the Lord : I will put my laws on their heart , And upon their mind also will I write them ; then saith he ,
ASV	Hebrews	10	17	And their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more .
ASV	Hebrews	10	18	Now where remission of these is , there is no more offering for sin .
ASV	Hebrews	10	19	Having therefore , brethren , boldness to enter into the holy place by the blood of Jesus ,
ASV	Hebrews	10	20	by the way which he dedicated for us , a new and living way , through the veil , that is to say , his flesh ;
ASV	Hebrews	10	21	and having a great priest over the house of God ;
ASV	Hebrews	10	22	let us draw near with a true heart in [ h ] fulness of faith , having our hearts sprinkled from an evil [ i ] conscience : and having our body washed with pure water ,
ASV	Hebrews	10	23	let us hold fast the confession of our hope that it waver not ; for he is faithful that promised :
ASV	Hebrews	10	24	and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and good works ;
ASV	Hebrews	10	25	not forsaking our own assembling together , as the custom of some is , but exhorting one another ; and so much the more , as ye see the day drawing nigh .
ASV	Hebrews	10	26	For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth , there remaineth no more a sacrifice for sins ,
ASV	Hebrews	10	27	but a certain fearful expectation of judgment , and a [ j ] fierceness of fire which shall devour the adversaries .
ASV	Hebrews	10	28	A man that hath set at nought Moses ’ law dieth without compassion on the word of two or three witnesses :
ASV	Hebrews	10	29	of how much sorer punishment , think ye , shall he be judged worthy , who hath trodden under foot the Son of God , and hath counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified [ k ] an unholy thing , and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace ?
ASV	Hebrews	10	30	For we know him that said , [ l ] Vengeance belongeth unto me , I will recompense . And again , [ m ] The Lord shall judge his people .
ASV	Hebrews	10	31	It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God .
ASV	Hebrews	10	32	But call to remembrance the former days , in which , after ye were enlightened , ye endured a great conflict of sufferings ;
ASV	Hebrews	10	33	partly , being made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions ; and partly , becoming partakers with them that were so used .
ASV	Hebrews	10	34	For ye both had compassion on them that were in bonds , and took joyfully the spoiling of your possessions , knowing that [ n ] ye have for yourselves a better possession and an abiding one .
ASV	Hebrews	10	35	Cast not away therefore your boldness , which hath great recompense of reward .
ASV	Hebrews	10	36	For ye have need of [ o ] patience , that , having done the will of God , ye may receive the promise .
ASV	Hebrews	10	37	[ p ] For yet a very little while , He that cometh shall come , and shall not tarry .
ASV	Hebrews	10	38	But [ q ] my righteous one shall live by faith : And if he shrink back , my soul hath no pleasure in him .
ASV	Hebrews	10	39	But we are not [ r ] of them that shrink back unto perdition ; but of them that have faith unto the [ s ] saving of the soul .

ASV	Hebrews	11	2	For therein the elders had witness borne to them .
ASV	Hebrews	11	3	By faith we understand that the [ c ] worlds have been framed by the word of God , so that what is seen hath not been made out of things which appear .
ASV	Hebrews	11	4	By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain , through which he had witness borne to him that he was righteous , [ d ] God bearing witness [ e ] in respect of his gifts : and through it he being dead yet speaketh .
ASV	Hebrews	11	5	By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death ; and he was not found , because God translated him : [ f ] for he hath had witness borne to him that before his translation he had been well-pleasing unto God :
ASV	Hebrews	11	6	and without faith it is impossible to be well-pleasing unto him ; for he that cometh to God must believe that he is , and that he is a rewarder of them that seek after him .
ASV	Hebrews	11	7	By faith Noah , being warned of God concerning things not seen as yet , moved with godly fear , prepared an ark to the saving of his house ; through which he condemned the world , and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith .
ASV	Hebrews	11	8	By faith Abraham , when he was called , obeyed to go out unto a place which he was to receive for an inheritance ; and he went out , not knowing whither he went .
ASV	Hebrews	11	9	By faith he became a sojourner in the land of promise , as in a land not his own , [ g ] dwelling in tents , with Isaac and Jacob , the heirs with him of the same promise :
ASV	Hebrews	11	10	for he looked for the city which hath the foundations , whose [ h ] builder and maker is God .
ASV	Hebrews	11	12	wherefore also there sprang of one , and him as good as dead , so many as the stars of heaven in multitude , and as the sand , which is by the sea-shore , innumerable .
ASV	Hebrews	11	13	These all died [ i ] in faith , not having received the promises , but having seen them and greeted them from afar , and having confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth .
ASV	Hebrews	11	14	For they that say such things make it manifest that they are seeking after a country of their own .
ASV	Hebrews	11	15	And if indeed they had been mindful of that country from which they went out , they would have had opportunity to return .
ASV	Hebrews	11	16	But now they desire a better country , that is , a heavenly : wherefore God is not ashamed of them , to be called their God ; for he hath prepared for them a city .
ASV	Hebrews	11	17	By faith Abraham , being tried , [ j ] offered up Isaac : yea , he that had gladly received the promises was offering up his only begotten son ;
ASV	Hebrews	11	18	even he [ k ] to whom it was said , [ l ] In Isaac shall thy seed be called :
ASV	Hebrews	11	19	accounting that God is able to raise up , even from the dead ; from whence he did also in a figure receive him back .
ASV	Hebrews	11	20	By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau , even concerning things to come .
ASV	Hebrews	11	21	By faith Jacob , when he was dying , blessed each of the sons of Joseph ; and worshipped , leaning upon the top of his staff .
ASV	Hebrews	11	22	By faith Joseph , when his end was nigh , made mention of the departure of the children of Israel ; and gave commandment concerning his bones .
ASV	Hebrews	11	23	By faith Moses , when he was born , was hid three months by his parents , because they saw he was a goodly child ; and they were not afraid of the king ’ s commandment .
ASV	Hebrews	11	24	By faith Moses , when he was grown up , refused to be called the son of Pharaoh ’ s daughter ;
ASV	Hebrews	11	25	choosing rather to share ill treatment with the people of God , than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season ;
ASV	Hebrews	11	26	accounting the reproach of [ m ] Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt : for he looked unto the recompense of reward .
ASV	Hebrews	11	27	By faith he forsook Egypt , not fearing the wrath of the king : for he endured , as seeing him who is invisible .
ASV	Hebrews	11	28	By faith he [ n ] kept the passover , and the sprinkling of the blood , that the destroyer of the firstborn should not touch them .
ASV	Hebrews	11	29	By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land : which the Egyptians assaying to do were swallowed up .
ASV	Hebrews	11	30	By faith the walls of Jericho fell down , after they had been compassed about for seven days .
ASV	Hebrews	11	31	By faith Rahab the harlot perished not with them that were disobedient , having received the spies with peace .
ASV	Hebrews	11	32	And what shall I more say ? for the time will fail me if I tell of Gideon , Barak , Samson , Jephthah ; of David and Samuel and the prophets :
ASV	Hebrews	11	33	who through faith subdued kingdoms , wrought righteousness , obtained promises , stopped the mouths of lions ,

ASV	Hebrews	12	4	Ye have not yet resisted unto blood , striving against sin :
ASV	Hebrews	12	5	and ye have forgotten the exhortation which reasoneth with you as with sons , [ f ] My son , regard not lightly the chastening of the Lord , Nor faint when thou art reproved of him ;
ASV	Hebrews	12	6	For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth , And scourgeth every son whom he receiveth .
ASV	Hebrews	12	7	[ g ] It is for chastening that ye endure ; God dealeth with you as with sons ; for what son is there whom his father chasteneth not ?
ASV	Hebrews	12	8	But if ye are without chastening , whereof all have been made partakers , then are ye bastards , and not sons .
ASV	Hebrews	12	9	Furthermore , we had the fathers of our flesh to chasten us , and we gave them reverence : shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of [ h ] spirits , and live ?
ASV	Hebrews	12	10	For they indeed for a few days chastened us as seemed good to them ; but he for our profit , that we may be partakers of his holiness .
ASV	Hebrews	12	11	All chastening seemeth for the present to be not joyous but grievous ; yet afterward it yieldeth peaceable fruit unto them that have been exercised thereby , even the fruit of righteousness .
ASV	Hebrews	12	13	and make straight paths for your feet , that that which is lame be not [ j ] turned out of the way , but rather be healed .
ASV	Hebrews	12	14	Follow after peace with all men , and the sanctification without which no man shall see the Lord :
ASV	Hebrews	12	15	looking carefully [ k ] lest there be any man that [ l ] falleth short of the grace of God ; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you , and thereby the many be defiled ;
ASV	Hebrews	12	16	[ m ] lest there be any fornicator , or profane person , as Esau , who for one mess of meat sold his own birthright .
ASV	Hebrews	12	17	For ye know that even when he afterward desired to inherit the blessing , he was [ n ] rejected ; for he found no place for a change of mind in his father , though he sought it diligently with tears .
ASV	Hebrews	12	18	For ye are not come unto [ o ] a mount that might be touched , and that burned with fire , and unto blackness , and darkness , and tempest ,
ASV	Hebrews	12	19	and the sound of a trumpet , and the voice of words ; which voice they that heard entreated that no word more should be spoken unto them ;
ASV	Hebrews	12	20	for they could not endure that which was enjoined , [ p ] If even a beast touch the mountain , it shall be stoned ;
ASV	Hebrews	12	21	and so fearful was the appearance , that Moses said , [ q ] I exceedingly fear and quake :
ASV	Hebrews	12	22	but ye are come unto mount Zion , and unto the city of the living God , the heavenly Jerusalem , [ r ] and to [ s ] innumerable hosts of angels ,

ASV	Hebrews	12	27	And this word , Yet once more , signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken , as of things that have been made , that those things which are not shaken may remain .

ASV	Hebrews	13	17	Obey them that have the rule over you , and submit to them : for they watch in behalf of your souls , as they that shall give account ; that they may do this with joy , and not with [ i ] grief : for this were unprofitable for you .

ASV	James	1	1	[ a ] James , a [ b ] servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ , to the twelve tribes which are of the Dispersion , [ c ] greeting .
ASV	James	1	2	Count it all joy , my brethren , when ye fall into manifold [ d ] temptations ;
ASV	James	1	3	knowing that the proving of your faith worketh [ e ] patience .
ASV	James	1	4	And let [ f ] patience have its perfect work , that ye may be perfect and entire , lacking in nothing .
ASV	James	1	5	But if any of you lacketh wisdom , let him ask of God , who giveth to all liberally and upbraideth not ; and it shall be given him .
ASV	James	1	6	But let him ask in faith , nothing doubting : for he that doubteth is like the surge of the sea driven by the wind and tossed .
ASV	James	1	7	For let not that man think [ g ] that he shall receive anything of the Lord ;
ASV	James	1	8	a doubleminded man , unstable in all his ways .
ASV	James	1	9	But let the brother of low degree glory in his high estate :
ASV	James	1	10	and the rich , in that he is made low : because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away .
ASV	James	1	11	For the sun ariseth with the scorching wind , and withereth the grass ; and the flower thereof falleth , and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth : so also shall the rich man fade away in his goings .
ASV	James	1	12	Blessed is the man that endureth temptation ; for when he hath been approved , he shall receive the crown of life , which the Lord promised to them that love him .
ASV	James	1	13	Let no man say when he is tempted , I am tempted [ h ] of God ; for God [ i ] can not be tempted with [ j ] evil , and he himself tempteth no man :
ASV	James	1	14	but each man is [ k ] tempted , when he is drawn away by his own lust , and enticed .
ASV	James	1	15	Then the lust , when it hath conceived , beareth sin : and the sin , when it is fullgrown , bringeth forth death .
ASV	James	1	16	Be not deceived , my beloved brethren .
ASV	James	1	17	Every good [ l ] gift and every perfect gift is from above , coming down from the Father of lights , with whom can be no variation , neither shadow that is cast by turning .
ASV	James	1	18	Of his own will he brought us forth by the word of truth , that we should be a kind of first-fruits of his creatures .
ASV	James	1	19	[ m ] Ye know this , my beloved brethren . But let every man be swift to hear , slow to speak , slow to wrath :
ASV	James	1	20	for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God .
ASV	James	1	21	Wherefore putting away all filthiness and overflowing of [ n ] wickedness , receive with meekness the [ o ] implanted word , which is able to save your souls .
ASV	James	1	22	But be ye doers of the word , and not hearers only , deluding your own selves .
ASV	James	1	23	For if any one is a hearer of the word and not a doer , he is like unto a man beholding [ p ] his natural face in a mirror :
ASV	James	1	24	for he beholdeth himself , and goeth away , and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was .
ASV	James	1	25	But he that looketh into the perfect law , the law of liberty , and so continueth , being not a hearer that forgetteth but a doer that worketh , this man shall be blessed in his doing .
ASV	James	1	26	If any man [ q ] thinketh himself to be religious , while he bridleth not his tongue but deceiveth his heart , this man ’ s religion is vain .
ASV	James	1	27	Pure religion and undefiled before our God and Father is this , to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction , and to keep oneself unspotted from the world .

ASV	James	2	3	and ye have regard to him that weareth the fine clothing , and say , Sit thou here in a good place ; and ye say to the poor man , Stand thou there , or sit under my footstool ;
ASV	James	2	4	[ c ] do ye not make distinctions [ d ] among yourselves , and become judges with evil thoughts ?
ASV	James	2	5	Hearken , my beloved brethren ; did not God choose them that are poor as to the world to be rich in faith , and heirs of the kingdom which he promised to them that love him ?
ASV	James	2	6	But ye have dishonored the poor man . Do not the rich oppress you , and themselves drag you before the judgment-seats ?
ASV	James	2	7	Do not they blaspheme the honorable name [ e ] by which ye are called ?
ASV	James	2	8	Howbeit if ye fulfil the royal law , according to the scripture , [ f ] Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself , ye do well :
ASV	James	2	9	but if ye have respect of persons , ye commit sin , being convicted by the law as transgressors .
ASV	James	2	10	For whosoever shall keep the whole law , and yet stumble in one point , he is become guilty of all .
ASV	James	2	11	For he that said , [ g ] Do not commit adultery , said also , Do not kill . Now if thou dost not commit adultery , but killest , thou art become a transgressor of the law .
ASV	James	2	12	So speak ye , and so do , as men that are to be judged by a law of liberty .
ASV	James	2	13	For judgment is without mercy to him that hath showed no mercy : mercy glorieth against judgment .
ASV	James	2	14	What doth it profit , my brethren , if a man say he hath faith , but have not works ? can that faith save him ?
ASV	James	2	15	If a brother or sister be naked and in lack of daily food ,
ASV	James	2	16	and one of you say unto them , Go in peace , be ye warmed and filled ; and yet ye give them not the things needful to the body ; what doth it profit ?
ASV	James	2	17	Even so faith , if it have not works , is dead in itself .
ASV	James	2	18	[ h ] Yea , a man will say , Thou hast faith , and I have works : show me thy faith apart from thy works , and I by my works will show thee my faith .
ASV	James	2	19	Thou believest that [ i ] God is one ; thou doest well : the demons also believe , and shudder .
ASV	James	2	20	But wilt thou know , O vain man , that faith apart from works is barren ?
ASV	James	2	21	Was not Abraham our father justified by works , in that he offered up Isaac his son upon the altar ?
ASV	James	2	22	[ j ] Thou seest that faith wrought with his works , and by works was faith made perfect ;
ASV	James	2	23	and the scripture was fulfilled which saith , [ k ] And Abraham believed God , and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness ; [ l ] and he was called the friend of God .
ASV	James	2	24	Ye see that by works a man is justified , and not only by faith .
ASV	James	2	25	And in like manner was not also Rahab the harlot justified by works , in that she received the messengers , and sent them out another way ?
ASV	James	2	26	For as the body apart from the spirit is dead , even so faith apart from works is dead .

ASV	James	3	3	Now if we put the horses ’ bridles into their mouths that they may obey us , we turn about their whole body also .
ASV	James	3	2	For in many things we all stumble . If any stumbleth not in word , the same is a perfect man , able to bridle the whole body also .
ASV	James	3	4	Behold , the ships also , though they are so great and are driven by rough winds , are yet turned about by a very small rudder , whither the impulse of the steersman willeth .
ASV	James	3	5	So the tongue also is a little member , and boasteth great things . Behold , [ b ] how much wood is kindled by how small a fire !
ASV	James	3	6	And the tongue is [ c ] a fire : [ d ] the world of iniquity among our members is the tongue , which defileth the whole body , and setteth on fire the wheel of [ e ] nature , and is set on fire by [ f ] hell .
ASV	James	3	7	For every [ g ] kind of beasts and birds , of creeping things and things in the sea , is tamed , and hath been tamed [ h ] by [ i ] mankind :
ASV	James	3	8	but the tongue can no man tame ; it is a restless evil , it is full of deadly poison .
ASV	James	3	9	Therewith bless we the Lord and Father ; and therewith curse we men , who are made after the likeness of God :
ASV	James	3	10	out of the same mouth cometh forth blessing and cursing . My brethren , these things ought not so to be .
ASV	James	3	11	Doth the fountain send forth from the same opening sweet water and bitter ?
ASV	James	3	12	can a fig tree , my brethren , yield olives , or a vine figs ? neither can salt water yield sweet .
ASV	James	3	13	Who is wise and understanding among you ? let him show by his good life his works in meekness of wisdom .
ASV	James	3	14	But if ye have bitter jealousy and faction in your heart , glory not and lie not against the truth .
ASV	James	3	15	This wisdom is not a wisdom that cometh down from above , but is earthly , [ j ] sensual , [ k ] devilish .
ASV	James	3	16	For where jealousy and faction are , there is confusion and every vile deed .
ASV	James	3	17	But the wisdom that is from above is first pure , then peaceable , gentle , easy to be entreated , full of mercy and good fruits , without [ l ] variance , without hypocrisy .

ASV	James	4	3	Ye ask , and receive not , because ye ask amiss , that ye may spend it in your pleasures .
ASV	James	4	5	Or think ye that the scripture [ c ] speaketh in vain ? [ d ] Doth the spirit which [ e ] he made to dwell in us long unto envying ?
ASV	James	4	6	But he giveth [ f ] more grace . Wherefore the scripture saith , [ g ] God resisteth the proud , but giveth grace to the humble .
ASV	James	4	7	Be subject therefore unto God ; but resist the devil , and he will flee from you .
ASV	James	4	8	Draw nigh to God , and he will draw nigh to you . Cleanse your hands , ye sinners ; and purify your hearts , ye doubleminded .
ASV	James	4	9	Be afflicted , and mourn , and weep : let your laughter be turned to mourning , and your joy to heaviness .
ASV	James	4	10	Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord , and he shall exalt you .
ASV	James	4	11	Speak not one against another , brethren . He that speaketh against a brother , or judgeth his brother , speaketh against the law , and judgeth the law : but if thou judgest the law , thou art not a doer of the law , but a judge .
ASV	James	4	12	One only is the lawgiver and judge , even he who is able to save and to destroy : but who art thou that judgest thy neighbor ?

ASV	James	4	15	[ h ] For that ye ought to say , If the Lord will , we shall both live , and do this or that .

ASV	James	5	3	Your gold and your silver are rusted ; and their rust shall be for a testimony [ a ] against you , and shall eat your flesh as fire . Ye have laid up your treasure in the last days .
ASV	James	5	4	Behold , the hire of the laborers who mowed your fields , which is of you kept back by fraud , crieth out : and the cries of them that reaped have entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth .
ASV	James	5	6	Ye have condemned , ye have killed the righteous one ; he doth not resist you .
ASV	James	5	7	Be patient therefore , brethren , until the [ b ] coming of the Lord . Behold , the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth , being patient over it , until [ c ] it receive the early and latter rain .
ASV	James	5	8	Be ye also patient ; establish your hearts : for the coming of the Lord is at hand .
ASV	James	5	9	Murmur not , brethren , one against another , that ye be not judged : behold , the judge standeth before the doors .
ASV	James	5	10	Take , brethren , for an example of suffering and of patience , the prophets who spake in the name of the Lord .
ASV	James	5	11	Behold , we call them blessed that endured : ye have heard of the [ d ] patience of Job , and have seen the end of the Lord , how that the Lord is full of pity , and merciful .
ASV	James	5	12	But above all things , my brethren , swear not , neither by the heaven , nor by the earth , nor by any other oath : but [ e ] let your yea be yea , and your nay , nay ; that ye fall not under judgment .
ASV	James	5	13	Is any among you suffering ? let him pray . Is any cheerful ? let him sing praise .
ASV	James	5	14	Is any among you sick ? let him call for the elders of the church ; and let them pray over him , [ f ] anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord :
ASV	James	5	15	and the prayer of faith shall save him that is sick , and the Lord shall raise him up ; and if he have committed sins , it shall be forgiven him .
ASV	James	5	16	Confess therefore your sins one to another , and pray one for another , that ye may be healed . The supplication of a righteous man availeth much in its working .
ASV	James	5	17	Elijah was a man of like [ g ] passions with us , and he prayed [ h ] fervently that it might not rain ; and it rained not on the earth for three years and six months .
ASV	James	5	18	And he prayed again ; and the heaven gave rain , and the earth brought forth her fruit .

ASV	1%20Peter	1	1	Peter 1:25 See verse
ASV	1%20Peter	1	2	according to the foreknowledge of God the Father , in sanctification of the Spirit , unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ : Grace to you and peace be multiplied .
ASV	1%20Peter	1	3	Blessed be [ a ] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , who according to his great mercy begat us again unto a living hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead ,
ASV	1%20Peter	1	4	unto an inheritance incorruptible , and undefiled , and that fadeth not away , reserved in heaven for you ,
ASV	1%20Peter	1	5	who by the power of God are guarded through faith unto a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time .
ASV	1%20Peter	1	6	Wherein ye greatly rejoice , though now for a little while , if need be , ye have been put to grief in manifold [ b ] trials ,
ASV	1%20Peter	1	7	that the proof of your faith , being more precious than gold that perisheth though it is proved by fire , may be found unto praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ :
ASV	1%20Peter	1	8	whom not having seen ye love ; on whom , though now ye see him not , yet believing , ye rejoice greatly with joy unspeakable and [ c ] full of glory :
ASV	1%20Peter	1	9	receiving the end of your faith , even the salvation of your souls .
ASV	1%20Peter	1	10	Concerning which salvation the prophets sought and searched diligently , who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you :
ASV	1%20Peter	1	11	searching what time or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did point unto , when it testified beforehand the sufferings [ d ] of Christ , and the glories that should follow them .
ASV	1%20Peter	1	12	.
ASV	1%20Peter	1	13	Wherefore girding up the loins of your mind , be sober and set your hope perfectly on the grace that [ g ] is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ ;
ASV	1%20Peter	1	14	as children of obedience , not fashioning yourselves according to your former lusts in the time of your ignorance :
ASV	1%20Peter	1	15	but [ h ] like as he who called you is holy , be ye yourselves also holy in all manner of living ;
ASV	1%20Peter	1	16	because it is written , [ i ] Ye shall be holy ; for I am holy .
ASV	1%20Peter	1	17	And if ye call on him as Father , who without respect of persons judgeth according to each man ’ s work , pass the time of your sojourning in fear :
ASV	1%20Peter	1	18	knowing that ye were redeemed , not with corruptible things , with silver or gold , from your vain manner of life handed down from your fathers ;
ASV	1%20Peter	1	19	but with precious blood , as of a lamb without blemish and without spot , even the blood of Christ :
ASV	1%20Peter	1	20	who was foreknown indeed before the foundation of the world , but was manifested at the end of the times for your sake ,
ASV	1%20Peter	1	21	who through him are believers in God , that raised him from the dead , and gave him glory ; so that your faith and hope might be in God .
ASV	1%20Peter	1	22	Seeing ye have purified your souls in your obedience to the truth unto unfeigned love of the brethren , love one another [ j ] from the heart fervently :
ASV	1%20Peter	1	23	having been begotten again , not of corruptible seed , but of incorruptible , through the word of [ k ] God , which liveth and abideth .
ASV	1%20Peter	1	24	For , [ l ] All flesh is as grass , And all the glory thereof as the flower of grass . The grass withereth , and the flower falleth :
ASV	1%20Peter	1	25	But the [ m ] word of the Lord abideth for ever . And this is the [ n ] word of good tidings which was [ o ] preached unto you . Footnotes -
ASV	1%20Peter	2	1	Peter 2:25 Or , Overseer
ASV	1%20Peter	2	2	as newborn babes , long for the [ b ] spiritual milk which is without guile , that ye may grow thereby unto salvation ;
ASV	1%20Peter	2	3	if ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious :
ASV	1%20Peter	2	4	unto whom coming , a living stone , rejected indeed of men , but with God elect , [ c ] precious ,
ASV	1%20Peter	2	5	ye also , as living stones , are built up [ d ] a spiritual house , to be a holy priesthood , to offer up spiritual sacrifices , acceptable to God through Jesus Christ .
ASV	1%20Peter	2	6	Because it is contained in [ e ] scripture , [ f ] Behold , I lay in Zion a chief corner stone , elect , [ g ] precious : And he that believeth on [ h ] him shall not be put to shame .
ASV	1%20Peter	2	7	[ i ] For you therefore that believe is the [ j ] preciousness : but for such as disbelieve , [ k ] The stone which the builders rejected , The same was made the head of the corner ;
ASV	1%20Peter	2	8	and , [ l ] A stone of stumbling , and a rock of offence ; [ m ] for they [ n ] stumble at the word , being disobedient : whereunto also they were appointed .
ASV	1%20Peter	2	9	But ye are an elect race , a royal priesthood , a holy nation , a people for God ’ s own possession , that ye may show forth the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvellous light :
ASV	1%20Peter	2	10	who in time past were no people , but now are the people of God : who had not obtained mercy , but now have obtained mercy .
ASV	1%20Peter	2	11	Beloved , I beseech you as sojourners and pilgrims , to abstain from fleshly lusts , which war against the soul ;
ASV	1%20Peter	2	12	having your behavior seemly among the Gentiles ; that , wherein they speak against you as evil-doers , they may by your good works , which they behold , glorify God in the day of visitation .
ASV	1%20Peter	2	13	Be subject to every [ o ] ordinance of man for the Lord ’ s sake : whether to the king , as supreme ;
ASV	1%20Peter	2	14	or unto governors , as sent [ p ] by him for vengeance on evil-doers and for praise to them that do well .
ASV	1%20Peter	2	15	For so is the will of God , that by well-doing ye should put to silence the ignorance of foolish men :
ASV	1%20Peter	2	16	as free , and not [ q ] using your freedom for a cloak of [ r ] wickedness , but as bondservants of God .
ASV	1%20Peter	2	17	Honor all men . Love the brotherhood . Fear God . Honor the king .
ASV	1%20Peter	2	18	[ s ] Servants , be in subjection to your masters with all fear ; not only to the good and gentle , but also to the froward .
ASV	1%20Peter	2	19	For this is [ t ] acceptable , if for conscience [ u ] toward God a man endureth griefs , suffering wrongfully .
ASV	1%20Peter	2	20	For what glory is it , if , when ye sin , and are buffeted for it , ye shall take it patiently ? but if , when ye do well , and suffer for it , ye shall take it patiently , this is [ v ] acceptable with God .
ASV	1%20Peter	2	21	For hereunto were ye called : because Christ also suffered for you , leaving you an example , that ye should follow his steps :
ASV	1%20Peter	2	22	who did no sin , neither was guile found in his mouth :
ASV	1%20Peter	2	23	who , when he was reviled , reviled not again ; when he suffered , threatened not ; but committed [ w ] himself to him that judgeth righteously :
ASV	1%20Peter	2	24	who his own self [ x ] bare our sins in his body upon the tree , that we , having died unto sins , might live unto righteousness ; by whose [ y ] stripes ye were healed .
ASV	1%20Peter	2	25	For ye were going astray like sheep ; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and [ z ] Bishop of your souls . Footnotes -

ASV	1%20Peter	3	2	beholding your chaste [ b ] behavior coupled with fear .
ASV	1%20Peter	3	4	but let it be the hidden man of the heart , in the incorruptible apparel of a meek and quiet spirit , which is in the sight of God of great price .
ASV	1%20Peter	3	5	For after this manner aforetime the holy women also , who hoped in God , adorned themselves , being in subjection to their own [ c ] husbands :
ASV	1%20Peter	3	6	as Sarah obeyed Abraham , calling him lord : whose children ye now are , if ye do well , and are not [ d ] put in fear by any terror .
ASV	1%20Peter	3	7	Ye husbands , in like manner , dwell with your wives according to knowledge , giving honor [ e ] unto the woman , as unto the weaker vessel , as being also joint-heirs of the grace of life ; to the end that your prayers be not hindered .
ASV	1%20Peter	3	8	Finally , be ye all likeminded , [ f ] compassionate , loving as brethren , tenderhearted , humbleminded :
ASV	1%20Peter	3	9	not rendering evil for evil , or reviling for reviling ; but contrariwise blessing ; for hereunto were ye called , that ye should inherit a blessing .
ASV	1%20Peter	3	10	For , [ g ] He that would love life , And see good days , Let him refrain his tongue from evil , And his lips that they speak no guile :
ASV	1%20Peter	3	11	And let him turn away from evil , and do good ; Let him seek peace , and pursue it .
ASV	1%20Peter	3	12	For the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous , And his ears unto their supplication : But the face of the Lord is upon them that do evil .
ASV	1%20Peter	3	13	And who is he that will harm you , if ye be zealous of that which is good ?
ASV	1%20Peter	3	14	But even if ye should suffer for righteousness ’ sake , blessed are ye : and fear not their fear , neither be troubled ;
ASV	1%20Peter	3	15	but sanctify in your hearts Christ as Lord : being ready always to give answer to every man that asketh you a reason concerning the hope that is in you , yet with meekness and fear :
ASV	1%20Peter	3	16	-
ASV	1%20Peter	3	17	For it is better , if the will of God should so will , that ye suffer for well-doing than for evil-doing .
ASV	1%20Peter	3	18	Because Christ also [ h ] suffered for sins once , the righteous for the unrighteous , that he might bring us to God ; being put to death in the flesh , but made alive in the spirit ;
ASV	1%20Peter	3	19	in which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison ,
ASV	1%20Peter	3	20	that aforetime were disobedient , when the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah , while the ark was a preparing , [ i ] wherein few , that is , eight souls , were saved through water :
ASV	1%20Peter	3	21	which also [ j ] after a true likeness doth now save you , even baptism , not the putting away of the filth of the flesh , but the [ k ] interrogation of a good conscience toward God , through the resurrection of Jesus Christ ;

ASV	1%20Peter	4	2	that [ c ] ye no longer should live the rest of your time in the flesh to the lusts of men , but to the will of God .
ASV	1%20Peter	4	3	For the time past may suffice to have wrought the desire of the Gentiles , and to have walked in lasciviousness , lusts , winebibbings , revellings , carousings , and abominable idolatries :
ASV	1%20Peter	4	5	who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the living and the dead .
ASV	1%20Peter	4	6	For unto this end [ e ] was the gospel preached even to the dead , that they might be judged indeed according to men in the flesh , but live according to God in the spirit .
ASV	1%20Peter	4	7	But the end of all things is at hand : be ye therefore of sound mind , and be sober unto [ f ] prayer :
ASV	1%20Peter	4	8	above all things being fervent in your love among yourselves ; for love covereth a multitude of sins :
ASV	1%20Peter	4	9	using hospitality one to another without murmuring :
ASV	1%20Peter	4	10	according as each hath received a gift , ministering it among yourselves , as good stewards of the manifold grace of God ;
ASV	1%20Peter	4	11	if any man speaketh , speaking as it were oracles of God ; if any man ministereth , ministering as of the strength which God supplieth : that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ , whose is the glory and the dominion [ g ] for ever and ever . Amen .
ASV	1%20Peter	4	12	Beloved , think it not strange concerning the fiery trial among you , which cometh upon you to prove you , as though a strange thing happened unto you :
ASV	1%20Peter	4	13	but insomuch as ye are partakers of Christ ’ s sufferings , rejoice ; that at the revelation of his glory also ye may rejoice with exceeding joy .
ASV	1%20Peter	4	14	If ye are reproached [ h ] for the name of Christ , blessed are ye ; because the Spirit of glory and the Spirit of God resteth upon you .
ASV	1%20Peter	4	15	For let none of you suffer as a murderer , or a thief , or an evil-doer , or as a meddler in other men ’ s matters :
ASV	1%20Peter	4	16	but if a man suffer as a Christian , let him not be ashamed ; but let him glorify God in this name .
ASV	1%20Peter	4	17	For the time is come for judgment to begin at the house of God : and if it begin first at us , what shall be the end of them that obey not the [ i ] gospel of God ?
ASV	1%20Peter	4	18	And if the righteous is scarcely saved , where shall the ungodly and sinner appear ?
ASV	1%20Peter	4	19	Wherefore let them also that suffer according to the will of God commit their souls in well-doing unto a faithful Creator . Footnotes -

ASV	2%20Peter	1	3	seeing that his divine power hath granted unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness , through the knowledge of him that called us [ e ] by his own glory and virtue ;
ASV	2%20Peter	1	4	whereby he hath granted unto us his precious and exceeding great promises ; that through these ye may become partakers of [ f ] the divine nature , having escaped from the corruption that is in the world by lust .
ASV	2%20Peter	1	5	Yea , and for this very cause adding on your part all diligence , in your faith supply virtue ; and in your virtue knowledge ;
ASV	2%20Peter	1	6	and in your knowledge self-control ; and in your self-control [ g ] patience ; and in your [ h ] patience godliness ;
ASV	2%20Peter	1	7	and in your godliness [ i ] brotherly kindness ; and in your [ j ] brotherly kindness love .
ASV	2%20Peter	1	8	For if these things are yours and abound , they make you to be not idle nor unfruitful unto the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ .
ASV	2%20Peter	1	9	For he that lacketh these things is blind , [ k ] seeing only what is near , having forgotten the cleansing from his old sins .
ASV	2%20Peter	1	10	Wherefore , brethren , give the more diligence to make your calling and election sure : for if ye do these things , ye shall never stumble :
ASV	2%20Peter	1	11	; 2:20 ; 3:18 ; Titus 2:13 . -
ASV	2%20Peter	1	12	Wherefore I shall be ready always to put you in remembrance of these things , though ye know them , and are established in the truth which is with you .

ASV	2%20Peter	1	15	Yea , I will give diligence that at every time ye may be able after my [ l ] decease to call these things to remembrance .
ASV	2%20Peter	1	16	For we did not follow cunningly devised fables , when we made known unto you the power and [ m ] coming of our Lord Jesus Christ , but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty .

ASV	2%20Peter	1	19	And we have the word of prophecy made more sure ; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed , as unto a lamp shining in a [ o ] dark place , until the day dawn , and the day-star arise in your hearts :

ASV	1%20John	2	7	Beloved , no new commandment write I unto you , but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning : the old commandment is the word which ye heard .
ASV	1%20John	2	8	Again , a new commandment write I unto you , which thing is true in him and in you ; because the darkness is passing away , and the true light already shineth .
ASV	1%20John	2	9	He that saith he is in the light and hateth his brother , is in the darkness even until now .
ASV	1%20John	2	10	He that loveth his brother abideth in the light , and there is no occasion of stumbling in him .
ASV	1%20John	2	11	But he that hateth his brother is in the darkness , and walketh in the darkness , and knoweth not whither he goeth , because the darkness hath blinded his eyes .
ASV	1%20John	2	12	I write unto you , my little children , because your sins are forgiven you for his name ’ s sake .
ASV	1%20John	2	13	I write unto you , fathers , because ye know him who is from the beginning . I write unto you , young men , because ye have overcome the evil one . [ b ] I have written unto you , little children , because ye know the Father .
ASV	1%20John	2	14	[ c ] I have written unto you , fathers , because ye know him who is from the beginning . [ d ] I have written unto you , young men , because ye are strong , and the word of God abideth in you , and ye have overcome the evil one .
ASV	1%20John	2	15	Love not the world , neither the things that are in the world . If any man love the world , the love of the Father is not in him .
ASV	1%20John	2	16	For all that is in the world , the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the vainglory of life , is not of the Father , but is of the world .
ASV	1%20John	2	17	And the world passeth away , and the lust thereof : but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever .
ASV	1%20John	2	18	Little children , it is the last hour : and as ye heard that antichrist cometh , even now have there arisen many antichrists ; whereby we know that it is the last hour .
ASV	1%20John	2	19	They went out from us , but they were not of us ; for if they had been of us , they would have continued with us : but they went out , that they might be made manifest [ e ] that they all are not of us .
ASV	1%20John	2	20	And ye have an anointing from the Holy One , [ f ] and ye know all things .
ASV	1%20John	2	21	I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth , but because ye know it , and [ g ] because no lie is of the truth .
ASV	1%20John	2	22	Who is the liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ ? This is the antichrist , even he that denieth the Father and the Son .
ASV	1%20John	2	23	Whosoever denieth the Son , the same hath not the Father : he that confesseth the Son hath the Father also .
ASV	1%20John	2	24	As for you , let that abide in you which ye heard from the beginning . If that which ye heard from the beginning abide in you , ye also shall abide in the Son , and in the Father .
ASV	1%20John	2	25	And this is the promise which he promised [ h ] us , even the life eternal .
ASV	1%20John	2	26	These things have I written unto you concerning them that would lead you astray .
ASV	1%20John	2	27	And as for you , the anointing which ye received of him abideth in you , and ye need not that any one teach you ; but as his anointing teacheth you concerning all things , [ i ] and is true , and is no lie , and even as it taught you , [ j ] ye abide in him .
ASV	1%20John	2	28	And now , my little children , abide in him ; that , if he shall be manifested , we may have boldness , and not be ashamed [ k ] before him at his [ l ] coming .

ASV	1%20John	3	2	Beloved , now are we children of God , and it is not yet made manifest what we shall be . We know that , if [ a ] he shall be manifested , we shall be like him ; for we shall see him even as he is .
ASV	1%20John	3	4	Every one that doeth sin doeth also lawlessness ; and sin is lawlessness .
ASV	1%20John	3	5	And ye know that he was manifested to [ b ] take away sins ; and in him is no sin .
ASV	1%20John	3	6	Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not : whosoever sinneth hath not seen him , neither [ c ] knoweth him .
ASV	1%20John	3	7	My little children , let no man lead you astray : he that doeth righteousness is righteous , even as he is righteous :
ASV	1%20John	3	8	he that doeth sin is of the devil ; for the devil sinneth from the beginning . To this end was the Son of God manifested , that he might destroy the works of the devil .
ASV	1%20John	3	9	Whosoever is begotten of God doeth no sin , because his seed abideth in him : and he can not sin , because he is begotten of God .
ASV	1%20John	3	10	In this the children of God are manifest , and the children of the devil : whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God , neither he that loveth not his brother .
ASV	1%20John	3	11	For this is the message which ye heard from the beginning , that we should love one another :
ASV	1%20John	3	12	not as Cain was of the evil one , and slew his brother . And wherefore slew he him ? Because his works were evil , and his brother ’ s righteous .
ASV	1%20John	3	13	Marvel not , brethren , if the world hateth you .
ASV	1%20John	3	14	We know that we have passed out of death into life , because we love the brethren . He that loveth not abideth in death .
ASV	1%20John	3	15	Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer : and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him .
ASV	1%20John	3	16	Hereby know we love , because he laid down his life for us : and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren .
ASV	1%20John	3	17	But whoso hath the world ’ s goods , and beholdeth his brother in need , and shutteth up his compassion from him , how doth the love of God abide in him ?
ASV	1%20John	3	18	My little children , let us not love in word , neither with the tongue ; but in deed and truth .
ASV	1%20John	3	19	Hereby shall we know that we are of the truth , and shall [ d ] assure our heart [ e ] before him :
ASV	1%20John	3	20	because if our heart condemn us , God is greater than our heart , and knoweth all things .
ASV	1%20John	3	21	Beloved , if our heart condemn us not , we have boldness toward God ;
ASV	1%20John	3	22	and whatsoever we ask we receive of him , because we keep his commandments and do the things that are pleasing in his sight .
ASV	1%20John	3	23	And this is his commandment , that we should [ f ] believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ , and love one another , even as he gave us commandment .

ASV	1%20John	4	2	Hereby know ye the Spirit of God : every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God :
ASV	1%20John	4	3	and every spirit that [ a ] confesseth not Jesus is not of God : and this is the spirit of the antichrist , whereof ye have heard that it cometh ; and now it is in the world already .
ASV	1%20John	4	5	They are of the world : therefore speak they as of the world , and the world heareth them .
ASV	1%20John	4	6	We are of God : he that knoweth God heareth us ; he who is not of God heareth us not . By this we know the spirit of truth , and the spirit of error .
ASV	1%20John	4	7	Beloved , let us love one another : for love is of God ; and every one that loveth is begotten of God , and knoweth God .
ASV	1%20John	4	8	He that loveth not knoweth not God ; for God is love .
ASV	1%20John	4	9	Herein was the love of God manifested [ b ] in us , that God hath sent his only begotten Son into the world that we might live through him .
ASV	1%20John	4	10	Herein is love , not that we loved God , but that he loved us , and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins .
ASV	1%20John	4	11	Beloved , if God so loved us , we also ought to love one another .
ASV	1%20John	4	12	No man hath beheld God at any time : if we love one another , God abideth in us , and his love is perfected in us :
ASV	1%20John	4	13	hereby we know that we abide in him and he in us , because he hath given us of his Spirit .
ASV	1%20John	4	14	And we have beheld and bear witness that the Father hath sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world .
ASV	1%20John	4	15	Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God , God abideth in him , and he in God .
ASV	1%20John	4	16	And we know and have believed the love which God hath [ c ] in us . God is love ; and he that abideth in love abideth in God , and God abideth in him .
ASV	1%20John	4	17	Herein is love made perfect with us , that we may have boldness in the day of judgment ; because as he is , even so are we in this world .
ASV	1%20John	4	18	There is no fear in love : but perfect love casteth out fear , because fear hath punishment ; and he that feareth is not made perfect in love .
ASV	1%20John	4	19	We love , because he first loved us .
ASV	1%20John	4	20	If a man say , I love God , and hateth his brother , he is a liar : for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen , [ d ] can not love God whom he hath not seen .

ASV	1%20John	5	2	Hereby we know that we love the children of God , when we love God and do his commandments .
ASV	1%20John	5	3	For this is the love of God , that we keep his commandments : and his commandments are not grievous .
ASV	1%20John	5	4	For whatsoever is begotten of God overcometh the world : and this is the victory that hath overcome the world , even our faith .
ASV	1%20John	5	6	This is he that came by water and blood , even Jesus Christ ; not [ a ] with the water only , but [ b ] with the water and [ c ] with the blood .
ASV	1%20John	5	7	And it is the Spirit that beareth witness , because the Spirit is the truth .
ASV	1%20John	5	8	For there are three who bear witness , the Spirit , and the water , and the blood : and the three agree in one .
ASV	1%20John	5	9	If we receive the witness of men , the witness of God is greater : for the witness of God is this , that he hath borne witness concerning his Son .
ASV	1%20John	5	10	He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in him : he that believeth not God hath made him a liar ; because he hath not believed in the witness that God hath borne concerning his Son .
ASV	1%20John	5	11	And the witness is this , that God gave unto us eternal life , and this life is in his Son .
ASV	1%20John	5	12	He that hath the Son hath the life ; he that hath not the Son of God hath not the life .
ASV	1%20John	5	13	These things have I written unto you , that ye may know that ye have eternal life , even unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God .
ASV	1%20John	5	14	And this is the boldness which we have toward him , that , if we ask anything according to his will , he heareth us :
ASV	1%20John	5	15	and if we know that he heareth us whatsoever we ask , we know that we have the petitions which we have asked of him .
ASV	1%20John	5	16	If any man see his brother sinning a sin not unto death , [ d ] he shall ask , and God will give him life for them that sin not unto death . There is [ e ] a sin unto death : not concerning this do I say that he should make request .
ASV	1%20John	5	17	All unrighteousness is sin : and there is [ f ] a sin not unto death .
ASV	1%20John	5	18	We know that whosoever is begotten of God sinneth not ; but he that was begotten of God keepeth [ g ] himself , and the evil one toucheth him not .
ASV	1%20John	5	19	We know that we are of God , and the whole world lieth in the evil one .

ASV	Revelation	2	11	He that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches . He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death .
ASV	Revelation	2	12	And to the angel of the church in Pergamum write : These things saith he that hath the sharp two-edged sword :
ASV	Revelation	2	13	I know where thou dwellest , even where Satan ’ s throne is ; and thou holdest fast my name , and didst not deny my faith , even in the days [ j ] of Antipas my witness , my faithful one , who was killed among you , where Satan dwelleth .
ASV	Revelation	2	14	But I have a few things against thee , because thou hast there some that hold the teaching of Balaam , who taught Balak to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel , to eat things sacrificed to idols , and to commit fornication .
ASV	Revelation	2	15	So hast thou also some that hold the teaching of the Nicolaitans in like manner .
ASV	Revelation	2	16	Repent therefore ; or else I come to thee quickly , and I will make war against them with the sword of my mouth .
ASV	Revelation	2	17	He that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches . To him that overcometh , to him will I give of the hidden manna , and I will give him a white stone , and upon the stone a new name written , which no one knoweth but he that receiveth it .
ASV	Revelation	2	18	And to the angel of the church in Thyatira write : These things saith the Son of God , who hath his eyes like a flame of fire , and his feet are like unto burnished brass :
ASV	Revelation	2	19	I know thy works , and thy love and faith and ministry and [ k ] patience , and that thy last works are more than the first .
ASV	Revelation	2	20	But I have this against thee , that thou sufferest [ l ] the woman Jezebel , who calleth herself a prophetess ; and she teacheth and seduceth my [ m ] servants to commit fornication , and to eat things sacrificed to idols .
ASV	Revelation	2	21	And I gave her time that she should repent ; and she willeth not to repent of her fornication .
ASV	Revelation	2	22	Behold , I cast her into a bed , and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation , except they repent of [ n ] her works .
ASV	Revelation	2	23	And I will kill her children with [ o ] death ; and all the churches shall know that I am he that searcheth the reins and hearts : and I will give unto each one of you according to your works .
ASV	Revelation	2	24	But to you I say , to the rest that are in Thyatira , as many as have not this teaching , who know not the deep things of Satan , as they are wont to say ; I cast upon you none other burden .
ASV	Revelation	2	25	Nevertheless that which ye have , hold fast till I come .
ASV	Revelation	2	26	And he that overcometh , and he that keepeth my works unto the end , to him will I give authority over the [ p ] nations :
ASV	Revelation	2	27	and he shall rule them with a rod of [ q ] iron , as the vessels of the potter are broken to shivers ; as I also have received of my Father :

ASV	Revelation	3	3	Remember therefore how thou hast received and didst hear ; and keep it , and repent . If therefore thou shalt not watch , I will come as a thief , and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee .
ASV	Revelation	3	2	Be thou watchful , and establish the things that remain , which were ready to die : for I have [ a ] found no works of thine perfected before my God .
ASV	Revelation	3	4	But thou hast a few names in Sardis that did not defile their garments : and they shall walk with me in white ; for they are worthy .

ASV	Revelation	3	8	I know thy works ( behold , I have [ b ] set before thee a door opened , which none can shut ) , that thou hast a little power , and didst keep my word , and didst not deny my name .
ASV	Revelation	3	9	Behold , I give of the synagogue of Satan , of them that say they are Jews , and they are not , but do lie ; behold , I will make them to come and [ c ] worship before thy feet , and to know that I have loved thee .
ASV	Revelation	3	10	Because thou didst keep the word of my [ d ] patience , I also will keep thee from the hour of [ e ] trial , that hour which is to come upon the whole [ f ] world , to [ g ] try them that dwell upon the earth .
ASV	Revelation	3	11	I come quickly : hold fast that which thou hast , that no one take thy crown .
ASV	Revelation	3	12	He that overcometh , I will make him a pillar in the [ h ] temple of my God , and he shall go out thence no more : and I will write upon him the name of my God , and the name of the city of my God , the new Jerusalem , which cometh down out of heaven from my God , and mine own new name .

ASV	Revelation	3	15	I know thy works , that thou art neither cold nor hot : I would thou wert cold or hot .
ASV	Revelation	3	16	So because thou art lukewarm , and neither hot nor cold , I will spew thee out of my mouth .
ASV	Revelation	3	17	Because thou sayest , I am rich , and have gotten riches , and have need of nothing ; and knowest not that thou art the wretched one and miserable and poor and blind and naked :
ASV	Revelation	3	18	I counsel thee to buy of me gold refined by fire , that thou mayest become rich ; and white garments , that thou mayest clothe thyself , and that the shame of thy nakedness be not made manifest ; and eyesalve to anoint thine eyes , that thou mayest see .

ASV	Revelation	4	4	And round about the throne were four and twenty thrones : and upon the thrones I saw four and twenty elders sitting , arrayed in white garments ; and on their heads crowns of gold .
ASV	Revelation	4	2	Straightway I was in the Spirit : and behold , there was a throne set in heaven , and one sitting upon the throne ;
ASV	Revelation	4	3	and he that sat was to look upon like a jasper stone and a sardius : and there was a rainbow round about the throne , like an emerald to look upon .
ASV	Revelation	4	5	And out of the throne proceed lightnings and voices and thunders . And there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne , which are the seven Spirits of God ;
ASV	Revelation	4	6	and before the throne , as it were a [ b ] sea of glass like unto crystal ; and in the midst [ c ] of the throne , and round about the throne , four living creatures full of eyes before and behind .
ASV	Revelation	4	7	And the first creature was like a lion , and the second creature like a calf , and the third creature had a face as of a man , and the fourth creature was like a flying eagle .
ASV	Revelation	4	8	And the four living creatures , having each one of them six wings , are full of eyes round about and within : and they have no rest day and night , saying , Holy , holy , holy , is the Lord God , the Almighty , who was and who is and [ d ] who is to come .
ASV	Revelation	4	9	And when the living creatures shall give glory and honor and thanks to him that sitteth on the throne , to him that liveth [ e ] for ever and ever ,
ASV	Revelation	4	10	the four and twenty elders shall fall down before him that sitteth on the throne , and shall worship him that liveth [ f ] for ever and ever , and shall cast their crowns before the throne , saying ,
ASV	Revelation	4	11	Worthy art thou , our Lord and our God , to receive the glory and the honor and the power : for thou didst create all things , and because of thy will they were , and were created .

ASV	Revelation	5	5	and one of the elders saith unto me , Weep not ; behold , the Lion that is of the tribe of Judah , the Root of David , hath overcome to open the book and the seven seals thereof .
ASV	Revelation	5	2	And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a great voice , Who is worthy to open the book , and to loose the seals thereof ?
ASV	Revelation	5	3	And no one in the heaven , or on the earth , or under the earth , was able to open the book , or to look thereon .
ASV	Revelation	5	4	And I wept much , because no one was found worthy to open the book , or to look thereon :
ASV	Revelation	5	6	And I saw [ b ] in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures , and in the midst of the elders , a Lamb standing , as though it had been slain , having seven horns , and seven eyes , which are the [ c ] seven Spirits of God , sent forth into all the earth .
ASV	Revelation	5	7	And he came , and he [ d ] taketh it out of the right hand of him that sat on the throne .
ASV	Revelation	5	8	And when he had taken the book , the four living creatures and the four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb , having each one a harp , and golden bowls full of incense , which are the prayers of the saints .
ASV	Revelation	5	9	And they sing a new song , saying , Worthy art thou to take the book , and to open the seals thereof : for thou wast slain , and didst purchase unto God with thy blood men of every tribe , and tongue , and people , and nation ,
ASV	Revelation	5	10	and madest them to be unto our God a kingdom and priests ; and they reign upon the earth .
ASV	Revelation	5	11	And I saw , and I heard a voice of many angels round about the throne and the living creatures and the elders ; and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand , and thousands of thousands ;
ASV	Revelation	5	12	saying with a great voice , Worthy is the Lamb that hath been slain to receive the power , and riches , and wisdom , and might , and honor , and glory , and blessing .
ASV	Revelation	5	13	And every created thing which is in the heaven , and on the earth , and under the earth , and on the sea , and all things that are in them , heard I saying , Unto him that sitteth on the throne , and unto the Lamb , be the blessing , and the honor , and the glory , and the dominion , [ e ] for ever and ever .

And there was given unto them authority over the fourth part of the earth , to kill with sword , and with famine , and with [ i ] death , and by the wild beasts of the earth .
ASV	Revelation	6	9	And when he opened the fifth seal , I saw underneath the altar the souls of them that had been slain for the word of God , and for the testimony which they held :
ASV	Revelation	6	10	and they cried with a great voice , saying , How long , O Master , the holy and true , dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth ?
ASV	Revelation	6	11	And there was given them to each one a white robe ; and it was said unto them , that they should rest yet for a little time , until their fellow-servants also and their brethren , who should be killed even as they were , should [ j ] have fulfilled their course .
ASV	Revelation	6	12	And I saw when he opened the sixth seal , and there was a great earthquake ; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair , and the whole moon became as blood ;
ASV	Revelation	6	13	and the stars of the heaven fell unto the earth , as a fig tree casteth her unripe figs when she is shaken of a great wind .
ASV	Revelation	6	14	And the heaven was removed as a scroll when it is rolled up ; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places .
ASV	Revelation	6	15	And the kings of the earth , and the princes , and the [ k ] chief captains , and the rich , and the strong , and every bondman and freeman , hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains ;
ASV	Revelation	6	16	and they say to the mountains and to the rocks , Fall on us , and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne , and from the wrath of the Lamb :

ASV	Revelation	7	3	saying , Hurt not the earth , neither the sea , nor the trees , till we shall have sealed the [ a ] servants of our God on their foreheads .
ASV	Revelation	7	4	And I heard the number of them that were sealed , a hundred and forty and four thousand , sealed out of every tribe of the children of Israel :

ASV	Revelation	7	9	After these things I saw , and behold , a great multitude , which no man could number , out of every nation and of all tribes and peoples and tongues , standing before the throne and before the Lamb , arrayed in white robes , and palms in their hands ;
ASV	Revelation	7	10	and they cry with a great voice , saying , Salvation unto our God who sitteth on the throne , and unto the Lamb .
ASV	Revelation	7	11	And all the angels were standing round about the throne , and about the elders and the four living creatures ; and they fell before the throne on their faces , and worshipped God ,

ASV	Revelation	8	8	And the second angel sounded , and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea : and the third part of the sea became blood ;
ASV	Revelation	8	2	And I saw the seven angels that stand before God ; and there were given unto them seven trumpets .
ASV	Revelation	8	3	And another angel came and stood [ a ] over the altar , having a golden censer ; and there was given unto him much incense , that he should [ b ] add it unto the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne .
ASV	Revelation	8	4	And the smoke of the incense , [ c ] with the prayers of the saints , went up before God out of the angel ’ s hand .
ASV	Revelation	8	5	And the angel [ d ] taketh the censer ; and he filled it with the fire of the altar , and cast it [ e ] upon the earth : and there followed thunders , and voices , and lightnings , and an earthquake .
ASV	Revelation	8	6	And the seven angels that had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound .
ASV	Revelation	8	7	And the first sounded , and there followed hail and fire , mingled with blood , and they were cast [ f ] upon the earth : and the third part of the earth was burnt up , and the third part of the trees was burnt up , and all green grass was burnt up .
ASV	Revelation	8	9	and there died the third part of the creatures which were in the sea , even they that had life ; and the third part of the ships was destroyed .
ASV	Revelation	8	10	And the third angel sounded , and there fell from heaven a great star , burning as a torch , and it fell upon the third part of the rivers , and upon the fountains of the waters ;
ASV	Revelation	8	11	and the name of the star is called Wormwood : and the third part of the waters became wormwood ; and many men died of the waters , because they were made bitter .
ASV	Revelation	8	12	And the fourth angel sounded , and the third part of the sun was smitten , and the third part of the moon , and the third part of the stars ; that the third part of them should be darkened , and the day should not shine for the third part of it , and the night in like manner .
ASV	Revelation	8	13	And I saw , and I heard [ g ] an eagle , flying in mid heaven , saying with a great voice , Woe , woe , woe , for them that dwell on the earth , by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels , who are yet to sound .

ASV	Revelation	9	9	And they had breastplates , as it were breastplates of iron ; and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots , of many horses rushing to war .
ASV	Revelation	9	2	And he opened the pit of the abyss ; and there went up a smoke out of the pit , as the smoke of a great furnace ; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit .
ASV	Revelation	9	3	And out of the smoke came forth locusts upon the earth ; and power was given them , as the scorpions of the earth have power .
ASV	Revelation	9	4	And it was said unto them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth , neither any green thing , neither any tree , but only such men as have not the seal of God on their foreheads .
ASV	Revelation	9	5	And it was given them that they should not kill them , but that they should be tormented five months : and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion , when it striketh a man .
ASV	Revelation	9	6	And in those days men shall seek death , and shall in no wise find it ; and they shall desire to die , and death fleeth from them .
ASV	Revelation	9	7	And the [ a ] shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared for war ; and upon their heads as it were crowns like unto gold , and their faces were as men ’ s faces .
ASV	Revelation	9	8	And they had hair as the hair of women , and their teeth were as the teeth of lions .
ASV	Revelation	9	10	And they have tails like unto scorpions , and stings ; and in their tails is their power to hurt men five months .
ASV	Revelation	9	11	They have over them as king the angel of the abyss : his name in Hebrew is Abaddon , and in the Greek tongue he hath the name [ b ] Apollyon .
ASV	Revelation	9	12	The first Woe is past : behold , there come yet two Woes hereafter .
ASV	Revelation	9	13	And the sixth angel sounded , and I heard [ c ] a voice from the horns of the golden altar which is before God ,
ASV	Revelation	9	14	one saying to the sixth angel that had the trumpet , Loose the four angels that are bound at the great river Euphrates .
ASV	Revelation	9	15	And the four angels were loosed , that had been prepared for the hour and day and month and year , that they should kill the third part of men .
ASV	Revelation	9	16	And the number of the armies of the horsemen was twice ten thousand times ten thousand : I heard the number of them .
ASV	Revelation	9	17	And thus I saw the horses in the vision , and them that sat on them , having breastplates as of fire and of hyacinth and of brimstone : and the heads of the horses are as the heads of lions ; and out of their mouths proceedeth fire and smoke and brimstone .
ASV	Revelation	9	18	By these three plagues was the third part of men killed , by the fire and the smoke and the brimstone , which proceeded out of their mouths .
ASV	Revelation	9	19	For the power of the horses is in their mouth , and in their tails : for their tails are like unto serpents , and have heads ; and with them they hurt .
ASV	Revelation	9	20	And the rest of mankind , who were not killed with these plagues , repented not of the works of their hands , that they should not [ d ] worship demons , and the idols of gold , and of silver , and of brass , and of stone , and of wood ; which can neither see , nor hear , nor walk :
ASV	Revelation	9	21	and they repented not of their murders , nor of their sorceries , nor of their fornication , nor of their thefts .

ASV	Revelation	10	2	and he had in his hand a little book open : and he set his right foot upon the sea , and his left upon the earth ;
ASV	Revelation	10	3	and he cried with a great voice , as a lion roareth : and when he cried , the seven thunders uttered their voices .
ASV	Revelation	10	4	And when the seven thunders uttered their voices , I was about to write : and I heard a voice from heaven saying , Seal up the things which the seven thunders uttered , and write them not .
ASV	Revelation	10	5	And the angel that I saw standing upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his right hand to heaven ,
ASV	Revelation	10	6	and sware by him that liveth [ a ] for ever and ever , who created the heaven and the things that are therein , and the earth and the things that are therein , [ b ] and the sea and the things that are therein , that there shall be [ c ] delay no longer :
ASV	Revelation	10	7	but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel , when he is about to sound , then is finished the mystery of God , according to the good tidings which he declared to his [ d ] servants the prophets .
ASV	Revelation	10	8	And the voice which I heard from heaven , I heard it again speaking with me , and saying , Go , take the book which is open in the hand of the angel that standeth upon the sea and upon the earth .
ASV	Revelation	10	9	And I went unto the angel , saying unto him that he should give me the little book . And he saith unto me , Take it , and eat it up ; and it shall make thy belly bitter , but in thy mouth it shall be sweet as honey .
ASV	Revelation	10	11	And they say unto me , Thou must prophesy again [ e ] over many peoples and nations and tongues and kings .

ASV	Revelation	11	3	And I will give unto my two witnesses , and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days , clothed in sackcloth .
ASV	Revelation	11	4	These are the two olive trees and the two [ f ] candlesticks , standing before the Lord of the earth .
ASV	Revelation	11	5	And if any man desireth to hurt them , fire proceedeth out of their mouth and devoureth their enemies ; and if any man shall desire to hurt them , in this manner must he be killed .
ASV	Revelation	11	6	These have the power to shut the heaven , that it rain not during the days of their prophecy : and they have power over the waters to turn them into blood , and to smite the earth with every plague , as often as they shall desire .
ASV	Revelation	11	7	And when they shall have finished their testimony , the beast that cometh up out of the abyss shall make war with them , and overcome them , and kill them .

ASV	Revelation	11	10	And they that dwell on the earth rejoice over them , and make merry ; and they shall send gifts one to another ; because these two prophets tormented them that dwell on the earth .
ASV	Revelation	11	12	And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them , Come up hither . And they went up into heaven in the cloud ; and their enemies beheld them .
ASV	Revelation	11	13	And in that hour there was a great earthquake , and the tenth part of the city fell ; and there were killed in the earthquake [ i ] seven thousand persons : and the rest were affrighted , and gave glory to the God of heaven .
ASV	Revelation	11	14	The second Woe is past : behold , the third Woe cometh quickly .
ASV	Revelation	11	15	And the seventh angel sounded ; and there followed great voices in heaven , and they said , The kingdom of the world is become the kingdom of our Lord , and of his Christ : and he shall reign [ j ] for ever and ever .
ASV	Revelation	11	16	And the four and twenty elders , who sit before God on their thrones , fell upon their faces and worshipped God ,
ASV	Revelation	11	17	saying , We give thee thanks , O Lord God , the Almighty , who art and who wast ; because thou hast taken thy great power , and didst reign .
ASV	Revelation	11	18	And the nations were wroth , and thy wrath came , and the time of the dead to be judged , and the time to give their reward to thy [ k ] servants the prophets , and to the saints , and to them that fear thy name , the small and the great ; and to destroy them that destroy the earth .
ASV	Revelation	11	19	And there was opened the [ l ] temple of God that is in heaven ; and there was seen in his [ m ] temple the ark of his covenant ; and there followed lightnings , and voices , and thunders , and an earthquake , and great hail .

ASV	Revelation	12	12	Therefore rejoice , O heavens , and ye that [ d ] dwell in them . Woe for the earth and for the sea : because the devil is gone down unto you , having great wrath , knowing that he hath but a short time .
ASV	Revelation	12	2	and she was with child ; and she crieth out , travailing in birth , and in pain to be delivered .
ASV	Revelation	12	3	And there was seen another sign in heaven : and behold , a great red dragon , having seven heads and ten horns , and upon his heads seven diadems .
ASV	Revelation	12	4	And his tail draweth the third part of the stars of heaven , and did cast them to the earth : and the dragon standeth before the woman that is about to be delivered , that when she is delivered he may devour her child .
ASV	Revelation	12	5	And she was delivered of a son , a man child , who is to rule all the [ a ] nations with a rod of iron : and her child was caught up unto God , and unto his throne .
ASV	Revelation	12	6	And the woman fled into the wilderness , where she hath a place prepared of God , that there they may nourish her a thousand two hundred and threescore days .
ASV	Revelation	12	7	And there was war in heaven : Michael and his angels going forth to war with the dragon ; and the dragon warred and his angels ;
ASV	Revelation	12	8	and they prevailed not , neither was their place found any more in heaven .
ASV	Revelation	12	9	And the great dragon was cast down , the old serpent , he that is called the Devil and Satan , the deceiver of the whole [ b ] world ; he was cast down to the earth , and his angels were cast down with him .
ASV	Revelation	12	10	And I heard a great voice in heaven , saying , [ c ] Now is come the salvation , and the power , and the kingdom of our God , and the authority of his Christ : for the accuser of our brethren is cast down , who accuseth them before our God day and night .
ASV	Revelation	12	11	And they overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb , and because of the word of their testimony ; and they loved not their life even unto death .
ASV	Revelation	12	13	And when the dragon saw that he was cast down to the earth , he persecuted the woman that brought forth the man child .
ASV	Revelation	12	14	And there were given to the woman the two wings of the great eagle , that she might fly into the wilderness unto her place , where she is nourished for a time , and times , and half a time , from the face of the serpent .
ASV	Revelation	12	15	And the serpent cast out of his mouth after the woman water as a river , that he might cause her to be carried away by the stream .
ASV	Revelation	12	16	And the earth helped the woman , and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed up the river which the dragon cast out of his mouth .
ASV	Revelation	12	17	And the dragon waxed wroth with the woman , and went away to make war with the rest of her seed , that keep the commandments of God , and hold the testimony of Jesus : Footnotes - Revelation 12:5 Or , Gentiles - Revelation 12:9 Greek inhabited earth . - Revelation 12:10 Or , Now is the salvation , and the power , and the kingdom , become our God ’ s , and the authority is become his Christ ’ s - Revelation 12:12 Greek tabernacle .
ASV	Revelation	13	13	And he doeth great signs , that he should even make fire to come down out of heaven upon the earth in the sight of men .
ASV	Revelation	13	1	and [ a ] he stood upon the sand of the sea . And I saw a beast coming up out of the sea , having ten horns and seven heads , and on his horns ten diadems , and upon his heads names of blasphemy .
ASV	Revelation	13	2	And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard , and his feet were as the feet of a bear , and his mouth as the mouth of a lion : and the dragon gave him his power , and his throne , and great authority .
ASV	Revelation	13	3	And I saw one of his heads as though it had been [ b ] smitten unto death ; and his death-stroke was healed : and the whole earth wondered after the beast ;
ASV	Revelation	13	4	and they [ c ] worshipped the dragon , because he gave his authority unto the beast ; and they [ d ] worshipped the beast , saying , Who is like unto the beast ? and who is able to war with him ?
ASV	Revelation	13	5	and there was given to him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies ; and there was given to him authority [ e ] to continue forty and two months .
ASV	Revelation	13	6	And he opened his mouth for blasphemies against God , to blaspheme his name , and his tabernacle , even them that [ f ] dwell in the heaven .
ASV	Revelation	13	7	[ g ] And it was given unto him to make war with the saints , and to overcome them : and there was given to him authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation .
ASV	Revelation	13	8	And all that dwell on the earth shall [ h ] worship him , every one whose name hath not been [ i ] written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb that hath been slain .
ASV	Revelation	13	9	If any man hath an ear , let him hear .
ASV	Revelation	13	10	[ j ] If any man [ k ] is for captivity , into captivity he goeth : if any man shall kill with the sword , with the sword must he be killed . Here is the [ l ] patience and the faith of the saints .
ASV	Revelation	13	11	And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth ; and he had two horns like unto a lamb , and he spake as a dragon .
ASV	Revelation	13	12	And he exerciseth all the authority of the first beast in his sight . And he maketh the earth and them that dwell therein to [ m ] worship the first beast , whose death-stroke was healed .
ASV	Revelation	13	14	And he deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by reason of the signs which it was given him to do in the sight of the beast ; saying to them that dwell on the earth , that they should make an image to the beast who hath the stroke of the sword and lived .
ASV	Revelation	13	15	And it was given unto him to give breath to it , even to the image of the beast , [ n ] that the image of the beast should both speak , and cause that as many as should not [ o ] worship the image of the beast should be killed .
ASV	Revelation	13	16	And he causeth all , the small and the great , and the rich and the poor , and the free and the bond , that there be given them a mark on their right hand , or upon their forehead ;
ASV	Revelation	13	17	and that no man should be able to buy or to sell , save he that hath the mark , even the name of the beast or the number of his name .
ASV	Revelation	13	18	Here is wisdom . He that hath understanding , let him count the number of the beast ; for it is the number of a man : and his number is [ p ] Six hundred and sixty and six .

ASV	Revelation	14	14	And I saw , and behold , a white cloud ; and on the cloud I saw one sitting like unto a son of man , having on his head a golden crown , and in his hand a sharp sickle .
ASV	Revelation	14	2	And I heard a voice from heaven , as the voice of many waters , and as the voice of a great thunder : and the voice which I heard was as the voice of harpers harping with their harps :
ASV	Revelation	14	3	and they sing as it were a new song before the throne , and before the four living creatures and the elders : and no man could learn the song save the hundred and forty and four thousand , even they that had been purchased out of the earth .
ASV	Revelation	14	4	These are they that were not defiled with women ; for they are virgins . These are they that follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth . These were purchased from among men , to be the first-fruits unto God and unto the Lamb .
ASV	Revelation	14	5	And in their mouth was found no lie : they are without blemish .
ASV	Revelation	14	6	And I saw another angel flying in mid heaven , having [ a ] eternal good tidings to proclaim unto them that [ b ] dwell on the earth , and unto every nation and tribe and tongue and people ;
ASV	Revelation	14	7	and he saith with a great voice , Fear God , and give him glory ; for the hour of his judgment is come : and [ c ] worship him that made the heaven and the earth and sea and fountains of waters .
ASV	Revelation	14	8	And another , a second angel , followed , saying , Fallen , fallen is Babylon the great , that hath made all the nations to drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication .
ASV	Revelation	14	9	And another angel , a third , followed them , saying with a great voice , If any man [ d ] worshippeth the beast and his image , and receiveth a mark on his forehead , or upon his hand ,
ASV	Revelation	14	10	he also shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God , which is [ e ] prepared unmixed in the cup of his anger ; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels , and in the presence of the Lamb :
ASV	Revelation	14	11	and the smoke of their torment goeth up [ f ] for ever and ever ; and they have no rest day and night , they that [ g ] worship the beast and his image , and whoso receiveth the mark of his name .
ASV	Revelation	14	12	Here is the [ h ] patience of the saints , they that keep the commandments of God , and the faith of Jesus .
ASV	Revelation	14	13	And I heard a voice from heaven saying , Write , Blessed are the dead who die [ i ] in the Lord from henceforth : yea , saith the Spirit , that they may rest from their labors ; for their works follow with them .
ASV	Revelation	14	15	And another angel came out from the [ j ] temple , crying with a great voice to him that sat on the cloud , Send forth thy sickle , and reap : for the hour to reap is come ; for the harvest of the earth is [ k ] ripe .
ASV	Revelation	14	16	And he that sat on the cloud cast his sickle upon the earth ; and the earth was reaped .
ASV	Revelation	14	17	And another angel came out from the [ l ] temple which is in heaven , he also having a sharp sickle .
ASV	Revelation	14	18	And another angel came out from the altar , he that hath power over fire ; and he called with a great voice to him that had the sharp sickle , saying , Send forth thy sharp sickle , and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth ; for her grapes are fully ripe .
ASV	Revelation	14	19	And the angel cast his sickle into the earth , and gathered the [ m ] vintage of the earth , and cast it into the winepress , the great winepress , of the wrath of God .
ASV	Revelation	14	20	And the winepress was trodden without the city , and there came out blood from the winepress , even unto the bridles of the horses , as far as a thousand and six hundred furlongs .

ASV	Revelation	15	15	And I saw another sign in heaven , great and marvellous , seven angels having seven plagues , which are the last , for in them is finished the wrath of God .
ASV	Revelation	15	2	And I saw as it were a [ a ] sea of glass mingled with fire ; and them that come off victorious from the beast , and from his image , and from the number of his name , standing [ b ] by the [ c ] sea of glass , having harps of God .
ASV	Revelation	15	3	And they sing the song of Moses the [ d ] servant of God , and the song of the Lamb , saying , Great and marvellous are thy works , O Lord God , the Almighty ; righteous and true are thy ways , thou King of the [ e ] ages .
ASV	Revelation	15	4	Who shall not fear , O Lord , and glorify thy name ? for thou only art holy ; for all the nations shall come and [ f ] worship before thee ; for thy righteous acts have been made manifest .
ASV	Revelation	15	5	And after these things I saw , and the [ g ] temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened :
ASV	Revelation	15	6	and there came out from the [ h ] temple the seven angels that had the seven plagues , arrayed [ i ] with precious stone , pure and bright , and girt about their breasts with golden girdles .
ASV	Revelation	15	7	And one of the four living creatures gave unto the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God , who liveth [ j ] for ever and ever .
ASV	Revelation	15	8	And the [ k ] temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God , and from his power ; and none was able to enter into the [ l ] temple , till the seven plagues of the seven angels should be finished .

ASV	Revelation	16	16	And they gathered them together into the place which is called in Hebrew [ l ] Har-Magedon .
ASV	Revelation	16	2	And the first went , and poured out his bowl into the earth ; and [ b ] it became a noisome and grievous sore upon the men that had the mark of the beast , and that [ c ] worshipped his image .
ASV	Revelation	16	3	And the second poured out his bowl into the sea ; and [ d ] it became blood as of a dead man ; and every [ e ] living soul died , even the things that were in the sea .
ASV	Revelation	16	4	And the third poured out his bowl into the rivers and the fountains of the waters ; [ f ] and [ g ] it became blood .
ASV	Revelation	16	5	And I heard the angel of the waters saying , Righteous art thou , who art and who wast , thou Holy One , because thou didst thus [ h ] judge :
ASV	Revelation	16	6	for they poured out the blood of saints and prophets , and blood hast thou given them to drink : they are worthy .
ASV	Revelation	16	7	And I heard the altar saying , Yea , O Lord God , the Almighty , true and righteous are thy judgments .
ASV	Revelation	16	8	And the fourth poured out his bowl upon the sun ; and it was given unto [ i ] it to scorch men with fire .
ASV	Revelation	16	9	And men were scorched with great heat : and they blasphemed the name of God who hath the power over these plagues ; and they repented not to give him glory .
ASV	Revelation	16	10	And the fifth poured out his bowl upon the throne of the beast ; and his kingdom was darkened ; and they gnawed their tongues for pain ,
ASV	Revelation	16	11	and they blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores ; and they repented not of their works .
ASV	Revelation	16	12	And the sixth poured out his bowl upon the great river , the river Euphrates ; and the water thereof was dried up , that the way might be made ready for the kings that come from the sunrising .
ASV	Revelation	16	13	And I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon , and out of the mouth of the beast , and out of the mouth of the false prophet , three unclean spirits , as it were frogs :
ASV	Revelation	16	14	for they are spirits of demons , working signs ; which go forth [ j ] unto the kings of the whole [ k ] world , to gather them together unto the war of the great day of God , the Almighty .
ASV	Revelation	16	15	( Behold , I come as a thief . Blessed is he that watcheth , and keepeth his garments , lest he walk naked , and they see his shame . )
ASV	Revelation	16	17	And the seventh poured out his bowl upon the air ; and there came forth a great voice out of the [ m ] temple , from the throne , saying , It is done :
ASV	Revelation	16	18	and there were lightnings , and voices , and thunders ; and there was a great earthquake , such as was not since [ n ] there were men upon the earth , so great an earthquake , so mighty .
ASV	Revelation	16	19	And the great city was divided into three parts , and the cities of the [ o ] nations fell : and Babylon the great was remembered in the sight of God , to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath .
ASV	Revelation	16	20	And every island fled away , and the mountains were not found .
ASV	Revelation	16	21	And great hail , every stone about the weight of a talent , cometh down out of heaven upon men : and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail ; for the plague thereof is exceeding great .

ASV	Revelation	17	17	For God did put in their hearts to do his mind , and to come to one mind , and to give their kingdom unto the beast , until the words of God should be accomplished .
ASV	Revelation	17	2	with whom the kings of the earth committed fornication , and they that dwell in the earth were made drunken with the wine of her fornication .
ASV	Revelation	17	3	And he carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness : and I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet-colored beast , [ a ] full of names of blasphemy , having seven heads and ten horns .
ASV	Revelation	17	4	And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet , and [ b ] decked with gold and precious stone and pearls , having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations , [ c ] even the unclean things of her fornication ,
ASV	Revelation	17	5	and upon her forehead a name written , [ d ] Mystery , Babylon the Great , the Mother of the Harlots and of the Abominations of the Earth .
ASV	Revelation	17	6	And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints , and with the blood of the [ e ] martyrs of Jesus . And when I saw her , I wondered with a great wonder .
ASV	Revelation	17	7	And the angel said unto me , Wherefore didst thou wonder ? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman , and of the beast that carrieth her , which hath the seven heads and the ten horns .
ASV	Revelation	17	8	The beast that thou sawest was , and is not ; and is about to come up out of the abyss , [ f ] and to go into perdition . And they that dwell on the earth shall wonder , they whose name hath not been written [ g ] in the book of life from the foundation of the world , when they behold the beast , how that he was , and is not , and [ h ] shall come .
ASV	Revelation	17	9	Here is the [ i ] mind that hath wisdom . The seven heads are seven mountains , on which the woman sitteth :
ASV	Revelation	17	10	and [ j ] they are seven kings ; the five are fallen , the one is , the other is not yet come ; and when he cometh , he must continue a little while .
ASV	Revelation	17	11	And the beast that was , and is not , is himself also an eighth , and is of the seven ; and he goeth into perdition .
ASV	Revelation	17	12	And the ten horns that thou sawest are ten kings , who have received no kingdom as yet ; but they receive authority as kings , with the beast , for one hour .
ASV	Revelation	17	13	These have one mind , and they give their power and authority unto the beast .
ASV	Revelation	17	14	These shall war against the Lamb , and the Lamb shall overcome them , for he is Lord of lords , and King of kings ; and they also shall overcome that are with him , called and chosen and faithful .
ASV	Revelation	17	15	And he saith unto me , The waters which thou sawest , where the harlot sitteth , are peoples , and multitudes , and nations , and tongues .
ASV	Revelation	17	16	And the ten horns which thou sawest , and the beast , these shall hate the harlot , and shall make her desolate and naked , and shall eat her flesh , and shall burn her utterly with fire .

ASV	Revelation	18	2	And he cried with a mighty voice , saying , Fallen , fallen is Babylon the great , and is become a habitation of demons , and a [ a ] hold of every unclean spirit , and a [ b ] hold of every unclean and hateful bird .
ASV	Revelation	18	3	For [ c ] by [ d ] the wine of the wrath of her fornication all the nations are fallen ; and the kings of the earth committed fornication with her , and the merchants of the earth waxed rich by the power of her [ e ] wantonness .
ASV	Revelation	18	4	And I heard another voice from heaven , saying , Come forth , my people , out of her , that ye have no fellowship with her sins , and that ye receive not of her plagues :
ASV	Revelation	18	5	for her sins [ f ] have reached even unto heaven , and God hath remembered her iniquities .
ASV	Revelation	18	6	Render unto her even as she rendered , and double unto her the double according to her works : in the cup which she mingled , mingle unto her double .
ASV	Revelation	18	7	How much soever she glorified herself , and waxed [ g ] wanton , so much give her of torment and mourning : for she saith in her heart , I sit a queen , and am no widow , and shall in no wise see mourning .
ASV	Revelation	18	8	Therefore in one day shall her plagues come , death , and mourning , and famine ; and she shall be utterly burned with fire ; for strong is [ h ] the Lord God who judged her .
ASV	Revelation	18	9	And the kings of the earth , who committed fornication and lived [ i ] wantonly with her , shall weep and wail over her , when they look upon the smoke of her burning ,
ASV	Revelation	18	10	standing afar off for the fear of her torment , saying , Woe , woe , the great city , Babylon , the strong city ! for in one hour is thy judgment come .
ASV	Revelation	18	11	And the merchants of the earth weep and mourn over her , for no man buyeth their [ j ] merchandise any more ;
ASV	Revelation	18	12	[ k ] merchandise of gold , and silver , and precious stone , and pearls , and fine linen , and purple , and silk , and scarlet ; and all thyine wood , and every vessel of ivory , and every vessel made of most precious wood , and of brass , and iron , and marble ;
ASV	Revelation	18	13	and cinnamon , and [ l ] spice , and incense , and ointment , and frankincense , and wine , and oil , and fine flour , and wheat , and cattle , and sheep ; and merchandise of horses and chariots and [ m ] slaves ; and [ n ] souls of men .
ASV	Revelation	18	14	And the fruits which thy soul lusted after are gone from thee , and all things that were dainty and sumptuous are perished from thee , and men shall find them no more at all .
ASV	Revelation	18	15	The merchants of these things , who were made rich by her , shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment , weeping and mourning ;
ASV	Revelation	18	16	saying , Woe , woe , the great city , she that was arrayed in fine linen and purple and scarlet , and [ o ] decked with gold and precious stone and pearl !
ASV	Revelation	18	17	for in one hour so great riches is made desolate . And every shipmaster , and every one that saileth any whither , and mariners , and as many as [ p ] gain their living by sea , stood afar off ,
ASV	Revelation	18	19	And they cast dust on their heads , and cried , weeping and mourning , saying , Woe , woe , the great city , wherein all that had their ships in the sea were made rich by reason of her costliness ! for in one hour is she made desolate .
ASV	Revelation	18	20	Rejoice over her , thou heaven , and ye saints , and ye apostles , and ye prophets ; for God hath judged your judgment on her .
ASV	Revelation	18	21	And [ q ] a strong angel took up a stone as it were a great millstone and cast it into the sea , saying , Thus with a mighty fall shall Babylon , the great city , be cast down , and shall be found no more at all .
ASV	Revelation	18	22	And the voice of harpers and minstrels and flute-players and trumpeters shall be heard no more at all in thee ; and no craftsman , [ r ] of whatsoever craft , shall be found any more at all in thee ; and the voice of a mill shall be heard no more at all in thee ;
ASV	Revelation	18	23	and the light of a lamp shall shine no more at all in thee ; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee : for thy merchants were the princes of the earth ; for with thy sorcery were all the nations deceived .

ASV	Revelation	19	19	And I saw the beast , and the kings of the earth , and their armies , gathered together to make war against him that sat upon the horse , and against his army .
ASV	Revelation	19	2	for true and righteous are his judgments ; for he hath judged the great harlot , her that corrupted the earth with her fornication , and he hath avenged the blood of his [ a ] servants at her hand .
ASV	Revelation	19	3	And a second time they [ b ] say , Hallelujah . And her smoke goeth up [ c ] for ever and ever .

ASV	Revelation	19	6	And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude , and as the voice of many waters , and as the voice of mighty thunders , saying , Hallelujah : for the Lord our God , the Almighty , reigneth .
ASV	Revelation	19	7	Let us rejoice and be exceeding glad , and let us give the glory unto him : for the marriage of the Lamb is come , and his wife hath made herself ready .

ASV	Revelation	19	10	And I fell down before his feet to [ e ] worship him . And he saith unto me , See thou do it not : I am a fellow-servant with thee and with thy brethren that hold the testimony of Jesus : [ f ] worship God : for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy .
ASV	Revelation	19	11	And I saw the heaven opened ; and behold , a white horse , and he that sat thereon [ g ] called Faithful and True ; and in righteousness he doth judge and make war .
ASV	Revelation	19	12	And his eyes are a flame of fire , and upon his head are many diadems ; and he hath a name written which no one knoweth but he himself .
ASV	Revelation	19	13	And he is arrayed in a garment [ h ] sprinkled with blood : and his name is called The Word of God .
ASV	Revelation	19	14	And the armies which are in heaven followed him upon white horses , clothed in fine linen , white and pure .
ASV	Revelation	19	15	And out of his mouth proceedeth a sharp sword , that with it he should smite the nations : and he shall rule them with a rod of iron : and he treadeth the [ i ] winepress of the fierceness of the wrath of God , the Almighty .
ASV	Revelation	19	16	And he hath on his garment and on his thigh a name written , King of Kings , and Lord of Lords .
ASV	Revelation	19	17	And I saw [ j ] an angel standing in the sun ; and he cried with a loud voice , saying to all the birds that fly in mid heaven , Come and be gathered together unto the great supper of God ;
ASV	Revelation	19	18	that ye may eat the flesh of kings , and the flesh of [ k ] captains , and the flesh of mighty men , and the flesh of horses and of them that sit thereon , and the flesh of all men , both free and bond , and small and great .
ASV	Revelation	19	20	And the beast was taken , and with him the false prophet that wrought the signs in his sight , wherewith he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast and them that [ l ] worshipped his image : they two were cast alive into the lake of fire that burneth with brimstone :
ASV	Revelation	19	21	and the rest were killed with the sword of him that sat upon the horse , even the sword which came forth out of his mouth : and all the birds were filled with their flesh .
