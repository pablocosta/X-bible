CJB	Matthew	1	9	‘ Uziyahu was the father of Yotam , Yotam was the father of Achaz , Achaz was the father of Hizkiyahu ,
CJB	Matthew	1	10	Hizkiyahu was the father of M ’ nasheh , M ’ nasheh was the father of Amon , Amon was the father of Yoshiyahu ,
CJB	Matthew	1	11	Yoshiyahu was the father of Y ’ khanyahu and his brothers at the time of the Exile to Bavel .
CJB	Matthew	1	12	After the Babylonian Exile , Y ’ khanyahu was the father of Sh ’ altiel , Sh ’ altiel was the father of Z ’ rubavel ,
CJB	Matthew	1	13	Z ’ rubavel was the father of Avihud , Avihud was the father of Elyakim , Elyakim was the father of ‘ Azur ,

CJB	Matthew	1	17	Thus there were fourteen generations from Avraham to David , fourteen generations from David to the Babylonian Exile , and fourteen generations from the Babylonian Exile to the Messiah .
CJB	Matthew	1	18	Here is how the birth of Yeshua the Messiah took place . When his mother Miryam was engaged to Yosef , before they were married , she was found to be pregnant from the Ruach HaKodesh .
CJB	Matthew	1	19	Her husband-to-be , Yosef , was a man who did what was right ; so he made plans to break the engagement quietly , rather than put her to public shame .
CJB	Matthew	1	20	But while he was thinking about this , an angel of Adonai appeared to him in a dream and said , “ Yosef , son of David , do not be afraid to take Miryam home with you as your wife ; for what has been conceived in her is from the Ruach HaKodesh .
CJB	Matthew	1	21	She will give birth to a son , and you are to name him Yeshua , [ which means ‘ Adonai saves , ’ ] because he will save his people from their sins. ”
CJB	Matthew	1	22	All this happened in order to fulfill what Adonai had said through the prophet ,
CJB	Matthew	1	23	“ The virgin will conceive and bear a son , and they will call him ‘ Immanu El. ” [ a ] ( The name means , “ God is with us. ” )
CJB	Matthew	1	24	When Yosef awoke he did what the angel of Adonai had told him to do — he took Miryam home to be his wife ,
CJB	Matthew	1	25	but he did not have sexual relations with her until she had given birth to a son , and he named him Yeshua . Footnotes - Matthew 1:23 Isaiah 7:14
CJB	Matthew	2	2	) - Matthew 2:15 Hosea 11:1 - Matthew 2:18 Jeremiah 31:14 (
CJB	Matthew	2	3	When King Herod heard of this he became very agitated , and so did everyone else in Yerushalayim .
CJB	Matthew	2	4	He called together all the head cohanim and Torah-teachers of the people and asked them , “ Where will the Messiah be born ? ”
CJB	Matthew	2	5	“ In Beit-Lechem of Y ’ hudah , ” they replied , “ because the prophet wrote ,
CJB	Matthew	2	6	‘ And you , Beit-Lechem in the land of Y ’ hudah , are by no means the least among the rulers of Y ’ hudah ; for from you will come a Ruler who will shepherd my people Isra ’ el. ’ ” [ a ]
CJB	Matthew	2	7	Herod summoned the Magi to meet with him privately and asked them exactly when the star had appeared .
CJB	Matthew	2	8	Then he sent them to Beit-Lechem with these instructions : “ Search carefully for the child ; and when you find him , let me know , so that I too may go and worship him. ”
CJB	Matthew	2	9	After they had listened to the king , they went away ; and the star which they had seen in the east went in front of them until it came and stopped over the place where the child was .
CJB	Matthew	2	10	When they saw the star , they were overjoyed .
CJB	Matthew	2	11	Upon entering the house , they saw the child with his mother Miryam ; and they prostrated themselves and worshipped him . Then they opened their bags and presented him gifts of gold , frankincense and myrrh .
CJB	Matthew	2	12	But they had been warned in a dream not to return to Herod , so they took another route back to their own country .
CJB	Matthew	2	13	After they had gone , an angel of Adonai appeared to Yosef in a dream and said , “ Get up , take the child and his mother , and escape to Egypt , and stay there until I tell you to leave . For Herod is going to look for the child in order to kill him. ”
CJB	Matthew	2	14	So he got up , took the child and his mother , and left during the night for Egypt ,
CJB	Matthew	2	15	)
CJB	Matthew	2	16	Meanwhile , when Herod realized that the Magi had tricked him , he was furious and gave orders to kill all the boys in and around Beit-Lechem who were two years old or less , calculating from the time the Magi had told him .
CJB	Matthew	2	17	In this way were fulfilled the words spoken through the prophet Yirmeyahu ,
CJB	Matthew	2	18	“ A voice was heard in Ramah , sobbing and lamenting loudly . It was Rachel sobbing for her children and refusing to be comforted , because they are no longer alive. ” [ c ]
CJB	Matthew	2	19	After Herod ’ s death , an angel of Adonai appeared in a dream to Yosef in Egypt
CJB	Matthew	2	20	and said , “ Get up , take the child and his mother , and go to Eretz-Yisra ’ el , for those who wanted to kill the child are dead. ”
CJB	Matthew	2	21	So he got up , took the child and his mother , and went back to Eretz-Yisra ’ el .
CJB	Matthew	2	22	However , when he heard that Archelaus had succeeded his father Herod as king of Y ’ hudah , he was afraid to go there . Warned in a dream , he withdrew to the Galil
CJB	Matthew	2	23	and settled in a town called Natzeret , so that what had been spoken by the prophets might be fulfilled , that he will be called a Natzrati . Footnotes - Matthew 2:6 Micah 5:1 (
CJB	Matthew	3	3	This is the man Yesha ‘ yahu was talking about when he said , “ The voice of someone crying out : ‘ In the desert prepare the way of Adonai ! Make straight paths for him ! ’ ” [ a ]
CJB	Matthew	3	2	“ Turn from your sins to God , for the Kingdom of Heaven is near ! ”
CJB	Matthew	3	4	Yochanan wore clothes of camel ’ s hair with a leather belt around his waist , and his food was locusts and wild honey .
CJB	Matthew	3	5	People went out to him from Yerushalayim , from all Y ’ hudah , and from the whole region around the Yarden .
CJB	Matthew	3	6	Confessing their sins , they were immersed by him in the Yarden River .
CJB	Matthew	3	7	But when Yochanan saw many of the P ’ rushim and Tz ’ dukim coming to be immersed by him , he said to them , “ You snakes ! Who warned you to escape the coming punishment ?
CJB	Matthew	3	8	If you have really turned from your sins to God , produce fruit that will prove it !
CJB	Matthew	3	9	And don ’ t suppose you can comfort yourselves by saying , ‘ Avraham is our father ’ ! For I tell you that God can raise up for Avraham sons from these stones !
CJB	Matthew	3	10	Already the axe is at the root of the trees , ready to strike ; every tree that doesn ’ t produce good fruit will be chopped down and thrown in the fire !
CJB	Matthew	3	11	It ’ s true that I am immersing you in water so that you might turn from sin to God ; but the one coming after me is more powerful than I — I ’ m not worthy even to carry his sandals — and he will immerse you in the Ruach HaKodesh and in fire .
CJB	Matthew	3	12	He has with him his winnowing fork ; and he will clear out his threshing floor , gathering his wheat into the barn but burning up the straw with unquenchable fire ! ”
CJB	Matthew	3	13	Then Yeshua came from the Galil to the Yarden to be immersed by Yochanan .
CJB	Matthew	3	14	But Yochanan tried to stop him . “ You are coming to me ? I ought to be immersed by you ! ”
CJB	Matthew	3	15	However , Yeshua answered him , “ Let it be this way now , because we should do everything righteousness requires. ” Then Yochanan let him .
CJB	Matthew	3	16	As soon as Yeshua had been immersed , he came up out of the water . At that moment heaven was opened , he saw the Spirit of God coming down upon him like a dove ,
CJB	Matthew	3	17	and a voice from heaven said , “ This is my Son , whom I love ; I am well pleased with him. ” Footnotes - Matthew 3:3 Isaiah 40:3
CJB	Matthew	4	4	But he answered , “ The Tanakh says , ‘ Man does not live on bread alone , but on every word that comes from the mouth of Adonai ’ ” [ a ]
CJB	Matthew	4	2	)
CJB	Matthew	4	3	The Tempter came and said to him , “ If you are the Son of God , order these stones to become bread. ”
CJB	Matthew	4	5	Then the Adversary took him to the holy city and set him on the highest point of the Temple .
CJB	Matthew	4	6	“ If you are the Son of God , ” he said , “ jump ! For the Tanakh says , ‘ He will order his angels to be responsible for you . . . . They will support you with their hands , so that you will not hurt your feet on the stones. ’ ” [ b ]
CJB	Matthew	4	7	Yeshua replied to him , “ But it also says , ‘ Do not put Adonai your God to the test. ’ ” [ c ]
CJB	Matthew	4	8	Once more , the Adversary took him up to the summit of a very high mountain , showed him all the kingdoms of the world in all their glory ,
CJB	Matthew	4	9	and said to him , “ All this I will give you if you will bow down and worship me. ”
CJB	Matthew	4	10	“ Away with you , Satan ! ” Yeshua told him , “ For the Tanakh says , ‘ Worship Adonai your God , and serve only him. ’ ” [ d ]
CJB	Matthew	4	11	Then the Adversary let him alone , and angels came and took care of him .
CJB	Matthew	4	12	When Yeshua heard that Yochanan had been put in prison , he returned to the Galil ;
CJB	Matthew	4	13	but he left Natzeret and came to live in K ’ far-Nachum , a lake shore town near the boundary between Z ’ vulun and Naftali .
CJB	Matthew	4	14	This happened in order to fulfill what Yesha ‘ yahu the prophet had said ,
CJB	Matthew	4	15	“ Land of Z ’ vulun and land of Naftali , toward the lake , beyond the Yarden , Galil-of-the-Goyim —
CJB	Matthew	4	16	the people living in darkness have seen a great light ; upon those living in the region , in the shadow of death , light has dawned. ” [ e ]
CJB	Matthew	4	17	From that time on , Yeshua began proclaiming , “ Turn from your sins to God , for the Kingdom of Heaven is near ! ”
CJB	Matthew	4	18	As Yeshua walked by Lake Kinneret , he saw two brothers who were fishermen — Shim ‘ on , known as Kefa , and his brother Andrew — throwing their net into the lake .
CJB	Matthew	4	19	Yeshua said to them , “ Come after me , and I will make you fishers for men ! ”
CJB	Matthew	4	20	At once they left their nets and went with him .
CJB	Matthew	4	21	Going on from there , he saw two other brothers — Ya ’ akov Ben-Zavdai and Yochanan his brother — in the boat with their father Zavdai , repairing their nets ; and he called them .
CJB	Matthew	4	22	At once they left the boat and their father and went with Yeshua .
CJB	Matthew	4	23	Yeshua went all over the Galil teaching in their synagogues , proclaiming the Good News of the Kingdom , and healing people from every kind of disease and sickness .
CJB	Matthew	4	24	Word of him spread throughout all Syria , and people brought to him all who were ill , suffering from various diseases and pains , and those held in the power of demons , and epileptics and paralytics ; and he healed them .
CJB	Matthew	4	25	Huge crowds followed him from the Galil , the Ten Towns , Yerushalayim , Y ’ hudah , and ‘ Ever-HaYarden .

CJB	Matthew	5	11	“ How blessed you are when people insult you and persecute you and tell all kinds of vicious lies about you because you follow me !
CJB	Matthew	5	12	Rejoice , be glad , because your reward in heaven is great — they persecuted the prophets before you in the same way .
CJB	Matthew	5	13	“ You are salt for the Land . But if salt becomes tasteless , how can it be made salty again ? It is no longer good for anything except being thrown out for people to trample on .

CJB	Matthew	5	15	Likewise , when people light a lamp , they don ’ t cover it with a bowl but put it on a lampstand , so that it shines for everyone in the house .
CJB	Matthew	5	16	In the same way , let your light shine before people , so that they may see the good things you do and praise your Father in heaven .
CJB	Matthew	5	17	“ Don ’ t think that I have come to abolish the Torah or the Prophets . I have come not to abolish but to complete .
CJB	Matthew	5	18	) - Matthew 5:31 Deuteronomy 24:1 - Matthew 5:33 Leviticus 19:12 ; Numbers 30:3 (
CJB	Matthew	5	19	So whoever disobeys the least of these mitzvot and teaches others to do so will be called the least in the Kingdom of Heaven . But whoever obeys them and so teaches will be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven .
CJB	Matthew	5	20	For I tell you that unless your righteousness is far greater than that of the Torah-teachers and P ’ rushim , you will certainly not enter the Kingdom of Heaven !
CJB	Matthew	5	21	) - Matthew 5:35 Isaiah 66:1 - Matthew 5:35 Psalm 48:3 (
CJB	Matthew	5	22	But I tell you that anyone who nurses anger against his brother will be subject to judgment ; that whoever calls his brother , ‘ You good-for-nothing ! ’ will be brought before the Sanhedrin ; that whoever says , ‘ Fool ! ’ incurs the penalty of burning in the fire of Gei-Hinnom !
CJB	Matthew	5	23	So if you are offering your gift at the Temple altar and you remember there that your brother has something against you ,
CJB	Matthew	5	24	leave your gift where it is by the altar , and go , make peace with your brother . Then come back and offer your gift .
CJB	Matthew	5	25	If someone sues you , come to terms with him quickly , while you and he are on the way to court ; or he may hand you over to the judge , and the judge to the officer of the court , and you may be thrown in jail !
CJB	Matthew	5	26	Yes indeed ! I tell you , you will certainly not get out until you have paid the last penny .
CJB	Matthew	5	27	“ You have heard that our fathers were told , ‘ Do not commit adultery. ’ [ c ]
CJB	Matthew	5	28	But I tell you that a man who even looks at a woman with the purpose of lusting after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart .
CJB	Matthew	5	29	If your right eye makes you sin , gouge it out and throw it away ! Better that you should lose one part of you than have your whole body thrown into Gei-Hinnom .
CJB	Matthew	5	30	And if your right hand makes you sin , cut it off and throw it away ! Better that you should lose one part of you than have your whole body thrown into Gei-Hinnom .
CJB	Matthew	5	31	“ It was said , ‘ Whoever divorces his wife must give her a get. ’ [ d ]
CJB	Matthew	5	32	But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife , except on the ground of fornication , makes her an adulteress ; and that anyone who marries a divorcee commits adultery .
CJB	Matthew	5	33	“ Again , you have heard that our fathers were told , ‘ Do not break your oath , ’ and ‘ Keep your vows to Adonai. ’ [ e ]
CJB	Matthew	5	34	But I tell you not to swear at all — not ‘ by heaven , ’ because it is God ’ s throne ;
CJB	Matthew	5	35	not ‘ by the earth , ’ because it is his footstool ; [ f ] and not ‘ by Yerushalayim , ’ because it is the city of the Great King . [ g ]
CJB	Matthew	5	36	And don ’ t swear by your head , because you can ’ t make a single hair white or black .
CJB	Matthew	5	37	Just let your ‘ Yes ’ be a simple ‘ Yes , ’ and your ‘ No ’ a simple ‘ No ’ ; anything more than this has its origin in evil .
CJB	Matthew	5	38	“ You have heard that our fathers were told , ‘ Eye for eye and tooth for tooth. ’ [ h ]

CJB	Matthew	5	41	And if a soldier forces you to carry his pack for one mile , carry it for two !

CJB	Matthew	5	43	“ You have heard that our fathers were told , ‘ Love your neighbor [ i ] — and hate your enemy. ’
CJB	Matthew	5	44	But I tell you , love your enemies ! Pray for those who persecute you !
CJB	Matthew	5	45	Then you will become children of your Father in heaven . For he makes his sun shine on good and bad people alike , and he sends rain to the righteous and the unrighteous alike .
CJB	Matthew	5	46	What reward do you get if you love only those who love you ? Why , even tax-collectors do that !
CJB	Matthew	5	47	And if you are friendly only to your friends , are you doing anything out of the ordinary ? Even the Goyim do that !
CJB	Matthew	5	48	Therefore , be perfect , just as your Father in heaven is perfect . Footnotes - Matthew 5:5 Psalm 37:11 - Matthew 5:21 Exodus 20:13 , Deuteronomy 5:17 - Matthew 5:27 Exodus 20:13 (
CJB	Matthew	6	6	But you , when you pray , go into your room , close the door , and pray to your Father in secret . Your Father , who sees what is done in secret , will reward you .
CJB	Matthew	6	2	So , when you do tzedakah , don ’ t announce it with trumpets to win people ’ s praise , like the hypocrites in the synagogues and on the streets . Yes ! I tell you , they have their reward already !
CJB	Matthew	6	3	But you , when you do tzedakah , don ’ t even let your left hand know what your right hand is doing .
CJB	Matthew	6	4	Then your tzedakah will be in secret ; and your Father , who sees what you do in secret , will reward you .
CJB	Matthew	6	5	“ When you pray , don ’ t be like the hypocrites , who love to pray standing in the synagogues and on street corners , so that people can see them . Yes ! I tell you , they have their reward already !
CJB	Matthew	6	7	“ And when you pray , don ’ t babble on and on like the pagans , who think God will hear them better if they talk a lot .
CJB	Matthew	6	8	Don ’ t be like them , because your Father knows what you need before you ask him .
CJB	Matthew	6	9	You , therefore , pray like this : ‘ Our Father in heaven ! May your Name be kept holy .
CJB	Matthew	6	10	May your Kingdom come , your will be done on earth as in heaven .
CJB	Matthew	6	11	Give us the food we need today .
CJB	Matthew	6	12	Forgive us what we have done wrong , as we too have forgiven those who have wronged us .
CJB	Matthew	6	13	is not found in the oldest manuscripts .
CJB	Matthew	6	14	For if you forgive others their offenses , your heavenly Father will also forgive you ;
CJB	Matthew	6	15	but if you do not forgive others their offenses , your heavenly Father will not forgive yours .
CJB	Matthew	6	16	“ Now when you fast , don ’ t go around looking miserable , like the hypocrites . They make sour faces so that people will know they are fasting . Yes ! I tell you , they have their reward already !
CJB	Matthew	6	17	But you , when you fast , wash your face and groom yourself ,
CJB	Matthew	6	18	so that no one will know you are fasting — except your Father , who is with you in secret . Your Father , who sees what is done in secret , will reward you .
CJB	Matthew	6	19	“ Do not store up for yourselves wealth here on earth , where moths and rust destroy , and burglars break in and steal .
CJB	Matthew	6	20	Instead , store up for yourselves wealth in heaven , where neither moth nor rust destroys , and burglars do not break in or steal .
CJB	Matthew	6	21	For where your wealth is , there your heart will be also .
CJB	Matthew	6	22	‘ The eye is the lamp of the body. ’ So if you have a ‘ good eye ’ [ that is , if you are generous ] your whole body will be full of light ;
CJB	Matthew	6	23	but if you have an ‘ evil eye ’ [ if you are stingy ] your whole body will be full of darkness . If , then , the light in you is darkness , how great is that darkness !
CJB	Matthew	6	24	No one can be slave to two masters ; for he will either hate the first and love the second , or scorn the second and be loyal to the first . You can ’ t be a slave to both God and money .
CJB	Matthew	6	25	“ Therefore , I tell you , don ’ t worry about your life — what you will eat or drink ; or about your body — what you will wear . Isn ’ t life more than food and the body more than clothing ?
CJB	Matthew	6	26	Look at the birds flying about ! They neither plant nor harvest , nor do they gather food into barns ; yet your heavenly Father feeds them . Aren ’ t you worth more than they are ?
CJB	Matthew	6	27	Can any of you by worrying add a single hour to his life ?
CJB	Matthew	6	28	“ And why be anxious about clothing ? Think about the fields of wild irises , and how they grow . They neither work nor spin thread ,
CJB	Matthew	6	29	yet I tell you that not even Shlomo in all his glory was clothed as beautifully as one of these .
CJB	Matthew	6	30	If this is how God clothes grass in the field — which is here today and gone tomorrow , thrown in an oven — won ’ t he much more clothe you ? What little trust you have !
CJB	Matthew	6	31	“ So don ’ t be anxious , asking , ‘ What will we eat ? , ’ ‘ What will we drink ? ’ or ‘ How will we be clothed ? ’
CJB	Matthew	6	32	For it is the pagans who set their hearts on all these things . Your heavenly Father knows you need them all .
CJB	Matthew	6	33	But seek first his Kingdom and his righteousness , and all these things will be given to you as well .
CJB	Matthew	6	34	Don ’ t worry about tomorrow — tomorrow will worry about itself ! Today has enough tsuris already ! Footnotes - Matthew 6:13 The latter half of verse
CJB	Matthew	7	7	“ Keep asking , and it will be given to you ; keep seeking , and you will find ; keep knocking , and the door will be opened to you .
CJB	Matthew	7	2	For the way you judge others is how you will be judged — the measure with which you measure out will be used to measure to you .
CJB	Matthew	7	3	Why do you see the splinter in your brother ’ s eye but not notice the log in your own eye ?
CJB	Matthew	7	4	How can you say to your brother , ‘ Let me take the splinter out of your eye , ’ when you have the log in your own eye ?
CJB	Matthew	7	5	You hypocrite ! First , take the log out of your own eye ; then you will see clearly , so that you can remove the splinter from your brother ’ s eye !
CJB	Matthew	7	6	“ Don ’ t give to dogs what is holy , and don ’ t throw your pearls to the pigs . If you do , they may trample them under their feet , then turn and attack you .

CJB	Matthew	7	9	Is there anyone here who , if his son asks him for a loaf of bread , will give him a stone ?
CJB	Matthew	7	10	or if he asks for a fish , will give him a snake ?
CJB	Matthew	7	11	So if you , even though you are bad , know how to give your children gifts that are good , how much more will your Father in heaven keep giving good things to those who keep asking him !
CJB	Matthew	7	12	“ Always treat others as you would like them to treat you ; that sums up the teaching of the Torah and the Prophets .
CJB	Matthew	7	13	“ Go in through the narrow gate ; for the gate that leads to destruction is wide and the road broad , and many travel it ;
CJB	Matthew	7	14	but it is a narrow gate and a hard road that leads to life , and only a few find it .
CJB	Matthew	7	15	“ Beware of the false prophets ! They come to you wearing sheep ’ s clothing , but underneath they are hungry wolves !
CJB	Matthew	7	16	You will recognize them by their fruit . Can people pick grapes from thorn bushes , or figs from thistles ?
CJB	Matthew	7	17	Likewise , every healthy tree produces good fruit , but a poor tree produces bad fruit .
CJB	Matthew	7	18	A healthy tree can not bear bad fruit , or a poor tree good fruit .
CJB	Matthew	7	19	Any tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown in the fire !
CJB	Matthew	7	20	So you will recognize them by their fruit .
CJB	Matthew	7	21	“ Not everyone who says to me , ‘ Lord , Lord ! ’ will enter the Kingdom of Heaven , only those who do what my Father in heaven wants .
CJB	Matthew	7	22	On that Day , many will say to me , ‘ Lord , Lord ! Didn ’ t we prophesy in your name ? Didn ’ t we expel demons in your name ? Didn ’ t we perform many miracles in your name ? ’
CJB	Matthew	7	23	Then I will tell them to their faces , ‘ I never knew you ! Get away from me , you workers of lawlessness ! ’ [ a ]
CJB	Matthew	7	24	“ So , everyone who hears these words of mine and acts on them will be like a sensible man who built his house on bedrock .
CJB	Matthew	7	25	The rain fell , the rivers flooded , the winds blew and beat against that house , but it didn ’ t collapse , because its foundation was on rock .
CJB	Matthew	7	26	But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not act on them will be like a stupid man who built his house on sand .
CJB	Matthew	7	27	The rain fell , the rivers flooded , the wind blew and beat against that house , and it collapsed — and its collapse was horrendous ! ”
CJB	Matthew	7	28	When Yeshua had finished saying these things , the crowds were amazed at the way he taught ,
CJB	Matthew	7	29	for he was not instructing them like their Torah-teachers but as one who had authority himself . Footnotes - Matthew 7:23 Psalm 6:9 (
CJB	Matthew	8	8	But the officer answered , “ Sir , I am unfit to have you come into my home . Rather , if you will only give the command , my orderly will recover .
CJB	Matthew	8	2	Then a man afflicted with tzara ‘ at came , kneeled down in front of him and said , “ Sir , if you are willing , you can make me clean. ”
CJB	Matthew	8	3	Yeshua reached out his hand , touched him and said , “ I am willing ! Be cleansed ! ” And at once he was cleansed from his tzara ‘ at .
CJB	Matthew	8	4	Then Yeshua said to him , “ See that you tell no one ; but as a testimony to the people , go and let the cohen examine you , and offer the sacrifice that Moshe commanded. ”
CJB	Matthew	8	5	As Yeshua entered K ’ far-Nachum , a Roman army officer came up and pleaded for help .
CJB	Matthew	8	6	“ Sir , my orderly is lying at home paralyzed and suffering terribly ! ”
CJB	Matthew	8	7	Yeshua said , “ I will go and heal him. ”
CJB	Matthew	8	9	For I too am a man under authority . I have soldiers under me , and I say to this one , ‘ Go ! ’ and he goes ; to another , ‘ Come ! ’ and he comes ; to my slave , ‘ Do this ! ’ and he does it. ”
CJB	Matthew	8	10	On hearing this Yeshua was amazed and said to the people following him , “ Yes ! I tell you , I have not found anyone in Isra ’ el with such trust !
CJB	Matthew	8	11	Moreover , I tell you that many will come from the east and from the west to take their places at the feast in the Kingdom of Heaven with Avraham , Yitz ’ chak and Ya ‘ akov .
CJB	Matthew	8	12	But those born for the Kingdom will be thrown outside in the dark , where people will wail and grind their teeth ! ”
CJB	Matthew	8	13	Then Yeshua said to the officer , “ Go ; let it be for you as you have trusted. ” And his orderly was healed at that very moment .
CJB	Matthew	8	14	Yeshua went to Kefa ’ s home and there saw Kefa ’ s mother-in-law sick in bed with a fever .
CJB	Matthew	8	15	He touched her hand , the fever left her , and she got up and began helping him .
CJB	Matthew	8	16	When evening came , many people held in the power of demons were brought to him . He expelled the spirits with a word and healed all who were ill.
CJB	Matthew	8	17	This was done to fulfill what had been spoken through the prophet Yesha ‘ yahu , “ He himself took our weaknesses and bore our diseases ” [ a ]
CJB	Matthew	8	18	When Yeshua saw the crowd around him , he gave orders to cross to the other side of the lake .
CJB	Matthew	8	19	A Torah-teacher approached and said to him , “ Rabbi , I will follow you wherever you go. ”
CJB	Matthew	8	20	Yeshua said to him , “ The foxes have holes , and the birds flying about have nests , but the Son of Man has no home of his own. ”
CJB	Matthew	8	21	Another of the talmidim said to him , “ Sir , first let me go and bury my father. ”
CJB	Matthew	8	22	But Yeshua replied , “ Follow me , and let the dead bury their own dead. ”
CJB	Matthew	8	23	He boarded the boat , and his talmidim followed .
CJB	Matthew	8	24	Then , without warning , a furious storm arose on the lake , so that waves were sweeping over the boat . But Yeshua was sleeping .
CJB	Matthew	8	25	So they came and roused him , saying , “ Sir ! Help ! We ’ re about to die ! ”
CJB	Matthew	8	26	He said to them , “ Why are you afraid ? So little trust you have ! ” Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the waves , and there was a dead calm .
CJB	Matthew	8	27	The men were astounded . They asked , “ What kind of man is this , that even the winds and sea obey him ? ”
CJB	Matthew	8	28	When Yeshua arrived at the other side of the lake , in the Gadarenes ’ territory , there came out of the burial caves two men controlled by demons , so violent that no one dared travel on that road .
CJB	Matthew	8	29	They screamed , “ What do you want with us , Son of God ? Have you come here to torture us before the appointed time ? ”
CJB	Matthew	8	30	Now some distance from them a large herd of pigs was feeding .
CJB	Matthew	8	31	The demons begged him , “ If you are going to drive us out , send us into the herd of pigs. ”
CJB	Matthew	8	32	“ All right , go ! ” he told them . So they came out and went into the pigs , whereupon the entire herd rushed down the hillside into the lake and drowned .
CJB	Matthew	8	33	The swineherds fled , went off to the town and told the whole story , including what had happened to the demonized men .
CJB	Matthew	8	34	At this , the whole town came out to meet Yeshua . When they saw him , they begged him to leave their district . Footnotes - Matthew 8:17 Isaiah 53:4
CJB	Matthew	9	9	As Yeshua passed on from there he spotted a tax-collector named Mattityahu sitting in his collection booth . He said to him , “ Follow me ! ” and he got up and followed him .
CJB	Matthew	9	2	Some people brought him a paralyzed man lying on a mattress . When Yeshua saw their trust , he said to the paralyzed man , “ Courage , son ! Your sins are forgiven. ”
CJB	Matthew	9	3	On seeing this , some of the Torah-teachers said among themselves , “ This man is blaspheming ! ”
CJB	Matthew	9	4	Yeshua , knowing what they were thinking , said , “ Why are you entertaining evil thoughts in your hearts ?
CJB	Matthew	9	5	Tell me , which is easier to say — ‘ Your sins are forgiven ’ or ‘ Get up and walk ’ ?
CJB	Matthew	9	6	But look ! I will prove to you that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins. ” He then said to the paralyzed man , “ Get up , pick up your mattress , and go home ! ”
CJB	Matthew	9	7	And the man got up and went home .
CJB	Matthew	9	8	When the crowds saw this , they were awestruck and said a b ’ rakhah to God the Giver of such authority to human beings .
CJB	Matthew	9	10	While Yeshua was in the house eating , many tax-collectors and sinners came and joined him and his talmidim at the meal .
CJB	Matthew	9	11	When the P ’ rushim saw this , they said to his talmidim , “ Why does your rabbi eat with tax-collectors and sinners ? ”
CJB	Matthew	9	12	But Yeshua heard the question and answered , “ The ones who need a doctor aren ’ t the healthy but the sick .
CJB	Matthew	9	13	As for you , go and learn what this means : ‘ I want compassion rather than animal-sacrifices. ’ [ a ] For I didn ’ t come to call the ‘ righteous , ’ but sinners ! ”
CJB	Matthew	9	14	Next , Yochanan ’ s talmidim came to him and asked , “ Why is it that we and the P ’ rushim fast frequently , but your talmidim don ’ t fast at all ? ”
CJB	Matthew	9	15	Yeshua said to them , “ Can wedding guests mourn while the bridegroom is still with them ? But the time will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them ; then they will fast .
CJB	Matthew	9	16	No one patches an old coat with a piece of unshrunk cloth , because the patch tears away from the coat and leaves a worse hole .
CJB	Matthew	9	17	Nor do people put new wine in old wineskins ; if they do , the skins burst , the wine spills and the wineskins are ruined . No , they pour new wine into freshly prepared wineskins , and in this way both are preserved. ”
CJB	Matthew	9	18	While he was talking , an official came in , kneeled down in front of him and said , “ My daughter has just died . But if you come and lay your hand on her , she will live. ”
CJB	Matthew	9	19	Yeshua , with his talmidim , got up and followed him .
CJB	Matthew	9	20	A woman who had had a hemorrhage for twelve years approached him from behind and touched the tzitzit on his robe .
CJB	Matthew	9	21	For she said to herself , “ If I can only touch his robe , I will be healed. ”
CJB	Matthew	9	22	Yeshua turned , saw her and said , “ Courage , daughter ! Your trust has healed you. ” And she was instantly healed .
CJB	Matthew	9	23	When Yeshua arrived at the official ’ s house and saw the flute-players , and the crowd in an uproar ,
CJB	Matthew	9	24	he said , “ Everybody out ! The girl isn ’ t dead , she ’ s only sleeping ! ” And they jeered at him .
CJB	Matthew	9	25	But after the people had been put outside , he entered and took hold of the girl ’ s hand , and she got up .
CJB	Matthew	9	26	News of this spread through all that region .
CJB	Matthew	9	27	As Yeshua went on from there , two blind men began following him , shouting , “ Son of David ! Take pity on us ! ”
CJB	Matthew	9	28	When he entered the house , the blind men came up , and Yeshua said to them , “ Do you believe that I have the power to do this ? ” They replied , “ Yes , sir. ”
CJB	Matthew	9	29	Then he touched their eyes and said , “ Let it happen to you according to your trust ” ;
CJB	Matthew	9	30	and their sight was restored . Yeshua warned them severely , “ See that no one knows about it. ”
CJB	Matthew	9	31	But instead , they went away and talked about him throughout that district .
CJB	Matthew	9	32	As they were going , a man controlled by a demon and unable to speak was brought to Yeshua .
CJB	Matthew	9	33	After the demon was expelled the man who had been mute spoke , and the crowds were amazed . “ Nothing like this has ever been seen in Isra ’ el , ” they said .
CJB	Matthew	9	34	But the P ’ rushim said , “ It is through the ruler of the demons that he expels demons. ”
CJB	Matthew	9	35	Yeshua went about all the towns and villages , teaching in their synagogues , proclaiming the Good News of the Kingdom , and healing every kind of disease and weakness .
CJB	Matthew	9	36	When he saw the crowds , he had compassion on them because they were harried and helpless , like sheep without a shepherd .
CJB	Matthew	9	37	Then he said to his talmidim , “ The harvest is rich , but the workers are few .
CJB	Matthew	9	38	Pray that the Lord of the harvest will send out workers to gather in his harvest. ” Footnotes - Matthew 9:13 Hosea 6:6
CJB	Matthew	10	10	and for the trip don ’ t take a pack , an extra shirt , shoes or a walking stick — a worker should be given what he needs .
CJB	Matthew	10	2	These are the names of the twelve emissaries : First , Shim ‘ on , called Kefa , and Andrew his brother , Ya ‘ akov Ben-Zavdai and Yochanan his brother ,
CJB	Matthew	10	3	Philip and Bar-Talmai , T ’ oma and Mattityahu the tax-collector , Ya ‘ akov Bar-Halfai and Taddai ,
CJB	Matthew	10	4	Shim ‘ on the Zealot , and Y ’ hudah from K ’ riot , who betrayed him .
CJB	Matthew	10	5	These twelve Yeshua sent out with the following instructions : “ Don ’ t go into the territory of the Goyim , and don ’ t enter any town in Shomron ,
CJB	Matthew	10	6	but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Matthew	10	7	As you go , proclaim , ‘ The Kingdom of Heaven is near , ’
CJB	Matthew	10	8	heal the sick , raise the dead , cleanse those afflicted with tzara ’ at , expel demons . You have received without paying , so give without asking payment .
CJB	Matthew	10	9	Don ’ t take money in your belts , no gold , no silver , no copper ;
CJB	Matthew	10	11	“ When you come to a town or village , look for someone trustworthy and stay with him until you leave .
CJB	Matthew	10	12	When you enter someone ’ s household , say , ‘ Shalom aleikhem ! ’
CJB	Matthew	10	13	If the home deserves it , let your shalom rest on it ; if not , let your shalom return to you .
CJB	Matthew	10	14	But if the people of a house or town will not welcome you or listen to you , leave it and shake its dust from your feet !
CJB	Matthew	10	15	Yes , I tell you , it will be more tolerable on the Day of Judgment for the people of S ’ dom and ‘ Amora than for that town !
CJB	Matthew	10	16	“ Pay attention ! I am sending you out like sheep among wolves , so be as prudent as snakes and as harmless as doves .
CJB	Matthew	10	17	Be on guard , for there will be people who will hand you over to the local Sanhedrins and flog you in their synagogues .
CJB	Matthew	10	18	On my account you will be brought before governors and kings as a testimony to them and to the Goyim .
CJB	Matthew	10	19	But when they bring you to trial , do not worry about what to say or how to say it ; when the time comes , you will be given what you should say .
CJB	Matthew	10	20	For it will not be just you speaking , but the Spirit of your heavenly Father speaking through you .
CJB	Matthew	10	21	“ A brother will betray his brother to death , and a father his child ; children will turn against their parents and have them put to death .
CJB	Matthew	10	22	Everyone will hate you because of me , but whoever holds out till the end will be preserved from harm .
CJB	Matthew	10	23	When you are persecuted in one town , run away to another . Yes indeed ; I tell you , you will not finish going through the towns of Isra ’ el before the Son of Man comes .
CJB	Matthew	10	24	“ A talmid is not greater than his rabbi , a slave is not greater than his master .
CJB	Matthew	10	25	It is enough for a talmid that he become like his rabbi , and a slave like his master . Now if people have called the head of the house Ba ‘ al-Zibbul , how much more will they malign the members of his household !
CJB	Matthew	10	26	So do not fear them ; for there is nothing covered that will not be uncovered , or hidden that will not be known .
CJB	Matthew	10	27	What I tell you in the dark , speak in the light ; what is whispered in your ear , proclaim on the housetops .
CJB	Matthew	10	28	“ Do not fear those who kill the body but are powerless to kill the soul . Rather , fear him who can destroy both soul and body in Gei-Hinnom .
CJB	Matthew	10	29	Aren ’ t sparrows sold for next to nothing , two for an assarion ? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground without your Father ’ s consent .
CJB	Matthew	10	30	As for you , every hair on your head has been counted .
CJB	Matthew	10	31	So do not be afraid , you are worth more than many sparrows .
CJB	Matthew	10	32	“ Whoever acknowledges me in the presence of others I will also acknowledge in the presence of my Father in heaven .
CJB	Matthew	10	33	But whoever disowns me before others I will disown before my Father in heaven .
CJB	Matthew	10	34	“ Don ’ t suppose that I have come to bring peace to the Land . It is not peace I have come to bring , but a sword !
CJB	Matthew	10	35	For I have come to set
CJB	Matthew	10	36	a man against his father , a daughter against her mother , a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law , so that a man ’ s enemies will be the members of his own household . [ a ]
CJB	Matthew	10	37	Whoever loves his father or mother more than he loves me is not worthy of me ; anyone who loves his son or daughter more than he loves me is not worthy of me .
CJB	Matthew	10	38	And anyone who does not take up his execution-stake and follow me is not worthy of me .
CJB	Matthew	10	39	Whoever finds his own life will lose it , but the person who loses his life for my sake will find it .
CJB	Matthew	10	40	“ Whoever receives you is receiving me , and whoever receives me is receiving the One who sent me .
CJB	Matthew	10	41	Anyone who receives a prophet because he is a prophet will receive the reward a prophet gets , and anyone who receives a tzaddik because he is a tzaddik will receive the reward a tzaddik gets .
CJB	Matthew	10	42	Indeed , if someone gives just a cup of cold water to one of these little ones because he is my talmid — yes ! — I tell you , he will certainly not lose his reward ! ” Footnotes - Matthew 10:36 Micah 7:6
CJB	Matthew	11	11	Yes ! I tell you that among those born of women there has not arisen anyone greater than Yochanan the Immerser ! Yet the one who is least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he !
CJB	Matthew	11	2	Meanwhile , Yochanan the Immerser , who had been put in prison , heard what the Messiah had been doing ; so he sent a message to him through his talmidim ,
CJB	Matthew	11	3	asking , “ Are you the one who is to come , or should we look for someone else ? ”
CJB	Matthew	11	4	Yeshua answered , “ Go and tell Yochanan what you are hearing and seeing —
CJB	Matthew	11	5	the blind are seeing again , the lame are walking , people with tzara ’ at are being cleansed , the deaf are hearing , [ a ] the dead are being raised , [ b ] the Good News is being told to the poor [ c ] —
CJB	Matthew	11	6	and how blessed is anyone not offended by me ! ”
CJB	Matthew	11	7	As they were leaving , Yeshua began speaking about Yochanan to the crowds : “ What did you go out to the desert to see ? Reeds swaying in the breeze ?
CJB	Matthew	11	8	No ? then what did you go out to see ? Someone who was well dressed ? Well-dressed people live in kings ’ palaces .
CJB	Matthew	11	9	Nu , so why did you go out ? To see a prophet ! Yes ! and I tell you he ’ s much more than a prophet .
CJB	Matthew	11	10	This is the one about whom the Tanakh says , ‘ See , I am sending out my messenger ahead of you ; he will prepare your way before you. ’ [ d ]
CJB	Matthew	11	12	From the time of Yochanan the Immerser until now , the Kingdom of Heaven has been suffering violence ; yes , violent ones are trying to snatch it away .
CJB	Matthew	11	13	For all the prophets and the Torah prophesied until Yochanan .
CJB	Matthew	11	14	Indeed , if you are willing to accept it , he is Eliyahu , whose coming was predicted .
CJB	Matthew	11	15	- Matthew 11:29 Jeremiah 6:16
CJB	Matthew	11	16	“ Oh , what can I compare this generation with ? They ’ re like children sitting in the marketplaces , calling out to each other ,
CJB	Matthew	11	17	‘ We made happy music , but you wouldn ’ t dance ! We made sad music , but you wouldn ’ t cry ! ’
CJB	Matthew	11	18	For Yochanan came , fasting , not drinking — so they say , ‘ He has a demon. ’
CJB	Matthew	11	19	The Son of Man came , eating freely and drinking wine — so they say , ‘ Aha ! A glutton and a drunkard ! A friend of tax-collectors and sinners ! ’ Well , the proof of wisdom is in the actions it produces. ”
CJB	Matthew	11	20	Then Yeshua began to denounce the towns in which he had done most of his miracles , because the people had not turned from their sins to God .
CJB	Matthew	11	21	“ Woe to you , Korazin ! Woe to you , Beit-Tzaidah ! Why , if the miracles done in you had been done in Tzor and Tzidon , they would long ago have put on sackcloth and ashes as evidence that they had changed their ways .
CJB	Matthew	11	22	But I tell you it will be more bearable for Tzor and Tzidon than for you on the Day of Judgment !
CJB	Matthew	11	23	And you , K ’ far-Nachum , will you be exalted to heaven ? No , you will be brought down to Sh ’ ol ! [ e ] For if the miracles done in you had been done in S ’ dom , it would still be in existence today .
CJB	Matthew	11	24	But I tell you that on the Day of Judgment it will be more bearable for the land of S ’ dom than for you ! ”
CJB	Matthew	11	25	It was at that time that Yeshua said , “ I thank you , Father , Lord of heaven and earth , that you concealed these things from the sophisticated and educated and revealed them to ordinary folks .
CJB	Matthew	11	26	Yes , Father , I thank you that it pleased you to do this .
CJB	Matthew	11	27	“ My Father has handed over everything to me . Indeed , no one fully knows the Son except the Father , and no one fully knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son wishes to reveal him .
CJB	Matthew	11	28	“ Come to me , all of you who are struggling and burdened , and I will give you rest .
CJB	Matthew	11	29	Take my yoke upon you and learn from me , because I am gentle and humble in heart , and you will find rest for your souls . [ f ]
CJB	Matthew	11	30	For my yoke is easy , and my burden is light. ” Footnotes - Matthew 11:5 Isaiah 35:5–6 - Matthew 11:5 Isaiah 26:19 - Matthew 11:5 Isaiah 61:1 - Matthew 11:10 Malachi 3:1 - Matthew 11:23 Isaiah 14:13 ,
CJB	Matthew	12	12	How much more valuable is a man than a sheep ! Therefore , what is permitted on Shabbat is to do good. ”
CJB	Matthew	12	2	On seeing this , the P ’ rushim said to him , “ Look ! Your talmidim are violating Shabbat ! ”
CJB	Matthew	12	3	But he said to them , “ Haven ’ t you ever read what David did when he and those with him were hungry ?
CJB	Matthew	12	4	He entered the House of God and ate the Bread of the Presence ! ” — which was prohibited , both to him and to his companions ; it is permitted only to the cohanim .
CJB	Matthew	12	5	“ Or haven ’ t you read in the Torah that on Shabbat the cohanim profane Shabbat and yet are blameless ?
CJB	Matthew	12	6	I tell you , there is in this place something greater than the Temple !
CJB	Matthew	12	7	If you knew what ‘ I want compassion rather than animal-sacrifice ’ [ a ] meant , you would not condemn the innocent .
CJB	Matthew	12	8	For the Son of Man is Lord of Shabbat ! ”
CJB	Matthew	12	9	Going on from that place , he went into their synagogue .
CJB	Matthew	12	10	A man there had a shriveled hand . Looking for a reason to accuse him of something , they asked him , “ Is healing permitted on Shabbat ? ”
CJB	Matthew	12	11	But he answered , “ If you have a sheep that falls in a pit on Shabbat , which of you won ’ t take hold of it and lift it out ?
CJB	Matthew	12	13	Then to the man he said , “ Hold out your hand. ” As he held it out , it became restored , as sound as the other one .
CJB	Matthew	12	14	But the P ’ rushim went out and began plotting how they might do away with Yeshua .
CJB	Matthew	12	15	Aware of this , he left that area . Many people followed him ; and he healed them all
CJB	Matthew	12	16	but warned them not to make him known .
CJB	Matthew	12	17	This was to fulfill what had been spoken through Yesha ‘ yahu the prophet ,
CJB	Matthew	12	18	“ Here is my servant , whom I have chosen , my beloved , with whom I am well pleased ; I will put my Spirit on him , and he will announce justice to the Gentiles .
CJB	Matthew	12	19	He will not fight or shout , no one will hear his voice in the streets ;
CJB	Matthew	12	20	he will not snap off a broken reed or snuff out a smoldering wick until he has brought justice through to victory .
CJB	Matthew	12	21	In him the Gentiles will put their hope. ” [ b ]
CJB	Matthew	12	22	Then some people brought him a man controlled by demons who was blind and mute ; and Yeshua healed him , so that he could both speak and see .
CJB	Matthew	12	23	The crowds were astounded and asked , “ This couldn ’ t be the Son of David , could it ? ”
CJB	Matthew	12	24	But when the P ’ rushim heard of it , they said , “ It is only by Ba ‘ al-Zibbul ” — the ruler of the demons — “ that this man drives out demons. ”
CJB	Matthew	12	25	However , knowing what they were thinking , Yeshua said to them , “ Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined , and every city or household divided against itself will not survive .
CJB	Matthew	12	26	If Satan drives out Satan , he is divided against himself ; so how can his kingdom survive ?
CJB	Matthew	12	27	Besides , if I drive out demons by Ba ‘ al-Zibbul , by whom do your people drive them out ? So , they will be your judges !
CJB	Matthew	12	28	But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of God , then the Kingdom of God has come upon you !
CJB	Matthew	12	29	“ Or again , how can someone break into a strong man ’ s house and make off with his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man ? After that he can ransack his house .
CJB	Matthew	12	30	“ Those who are not with me are against me , and those who do not gather with me are scattering .
CJB	Matthew	12	31	Because of this , I tell you that people will be forgiven any sin and blasphemy , but blaspheming the Ruach HaKodesh will not be forgiven .
CJB	Matthew	12	32	One can say something against the Son of Man and be forgiven ; but whoever keeps on speaking against the Ruach HaKodesh will never be forgiven , neither in the ‘ olam hazeh nor in the ‘ olam haba .
CJB	Matthew	12	33	“ If you make a tree good , its fruit will be good ; and if you make a tree bad , its fruit will be bad ; for a tree is known by its fruit .
CJB	Matthew	12	34	You snakes ! How can you who are evil say anything good ? For the mouth speaks what overflows from the heart .
CJB	Matthew	12	35	The good person brings forth good things from his store of good , and the evil person brings forth evil things from his store of evil .
CJB	Matthew	12	36	Moreover , I tell you this : on the Day of Judgment people will have to give account for every careless word they have spoken ;
CJB	Matthew	12	37	for by your own words you will be acquitted , and by your own words you will be condemned. ”
CJB	Matthew	12	38	At this some of the Torah-teachers said , “ Rabbi , we want to see a miraculous sign from you. ”
CJB	Matthew	12	39	He replied , “ A wicked and adulterous generation asks for a sign ? No ! None will be given to it but the sign of the prophet Yonah .
CJB	Matthew	12	40	For just as Yonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the sea-monster , [ c ] so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the depths of the earth .
CJB	Matthew	12	41	The people of Ninveh will stand up at the Judgment with this generation and condemn it , for they turned from their sins to God when Yonah preached , but what is here now is greater than Yonah .
CJB	Matthew	12	42	The Queen of the South will stand up at the Judgment with this generation and condemn it , for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Shlomo , but what is here now is greater than Shlomo .
CJB	Matthew	12	43	“ When an unclean spirit comes out of a person , it travels through dry country seeking rest and does not find it .
CJB	Matthew	12	44	Then it says to itself , ‘ I will return to the house I left. ’ When it arrives , it finds the house standing empty , swept clean and put in order .
CJB	Matthew	12	45	Then it goes and takes with it seven other spirits more evil than itself , and they come and live there — so that in the end , the person is worse off than he was before . This is how it will be for this wicked generation. ”
CJB	Matthew	12	46	He was still speaking to the crowd when his mother and brothers appeared outside , asking to talk with him .
CJB	Matthew	12	47	: Someone told him , “ Your mother and brothers are standing outside , asking to talk with you . ”
CJB	Matthew	12	48	But to the one who had informed him he replied , “ Who is my mother ? Who are my brothers ? ”
CJB	Matthew	12	49	Pointing to his talmidim , he said , “ Look ! Here are my mother and my brothers !
CJB	Matthew	12	50	Whoever does what my Father in heaven wants , that person is my brother and sister and mother. ” Footnotes - Matthew 12:7 Hosea 6:6 - Matthew 12:21 Isaiah 42:1–4 - Matthew 12:40 Jonah 2:1 ( 1:17 ) - Matthew 12:47 Some manuscripts include verse
CJB	Matthew	13	13	Here is why I speak to them in parables : they look without seeing and listen without hearing or understanding .
CJB	Matthew	13	2	but such a large crowd gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat there while the crowd stood on the shore .
CJB	Matthew	13	3	He told them many things in parables : “ A farmer went out to sow his seed .
CJB	Matthew	13	4	As he sowed , some seed fell alongside the path ; and the birds came and ate it up .
CJB	Matthew	13	5	Other seed fell on rocky patches where there was not much soil . It sprouted quickly because the soil was shallow ;
CJB	Matthew	13	6	but when the sun had risen , the young plants were scorched ; and since their roots were not deep , they dried up .
CJB	Matthew	13	7	Other seed fell among thorns , which grew up and choked the plants .
CJB	Matthew	13	8	But others fell into rich soil and produced grain , a hundred or sixty or thirty times as much as had been sown .
CJB	Matthew	13	9	Those who have ears , let them hear ! ”
CJB	Matthew	13	10	Then the talmidim came and asked Yeshua , “ Why are you speaking to them in parables ? ”
CJB	Matthew	13	11	He answered , “ Because it has been given to you to know the secrets of the Kingdom of Heaven , but it has not been given to them .
CJB	Matthew	13	12	For anyone who has something will be given more , so that he will have plenty ; but from anyone who has nothing , even what he does have will be taken away .
CJB	Matthew	13	14	That is , in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Yesha ‘ yahu which says , ‘ You will keep on hearing but never understand , and keep on seeing but never perceive ,
CJB	Matthew	13	15	because the heart of this people has become dull — with their ears they barely hear , and their eyes they have closed , so as not to see with their eyes , hear with their ears , understand with their heart , and do t ’ shuvah , so that I could heal them. ’
CJB	Matthew	13	16	But you , how blessed are your eyes , because they see , and your ears , because they hear !
CJB	Matthew	13	17	Yes indeed ! I tell you that many a prophet and many a tzaddik longed to see the things you are seeing but did not see them , and to hear the things you are hearing but did not hear them .
CJB	Matthew	13	18	“ So listen to what the parable of the sower means .
CJB	Matthew	13	19	Whoever hears the message about the Kingdom , but doesn ’ t understand it , is like the seed sown along the path — the Evil One comes and seizes what was sown in his heart .
CJB	Matthew	13	20	The seed sown on rocky ground is like a person who hears the message and accepts it with joy at once ,
CJB	Matthew	13	21	but has no root in himself . So he stays on for a while ; but as soon as some trouble or persecution arises on account of the message , he immediately falls away .
CJB	Matthew	13	22	Now the seed sown among thorns stands for someone who hears the message , but it is choked by the worries of the world and the deceitful glamor of wealth , so that it produces nothing .
CJB	Matthew	13	23	However , what was sown on rich soil is the one who hears the message and understands it ; such a person will surely bear fruit , a hundred or sixty or thirty times what was sown. ”
CJB	Matthew	13	24	Yeshua put before them another parable . “ The Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field ;
CJB	Matthew	13	25	but while people were sleeping , his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat , then went away .
CJB	Matthew	13	26	When the wheat sprouted and formed heads of grain , the weeds also appeared .
CJB	Matthew	13	27	The owner ’ s servants came to him and said , ‘ Sir didn ’ t you sow good seed in your field ? Where have the weeds come from ? ’
CJB	Matthew	13	28	He answered , ‘ An enemy has done this. ’ The servants asked him , ‘ Then do you want us to go and pull them up ? ’
CJB	Matthew	13	29	But he said , ‘ No , because if you pull up the weeds , you might uproot some of the wheat at the same time .
CJB	Matthew	13	30	Let them both grow together until the harvest ; and at harvest-time I will tell the reapers to collect the weeds first and tie them in bundles to be burned , but to gather the wheat into my barn. ’ ”
CJB	Matthew	13	31	Yeshua put before them another parable . “ The Kingdom of Heaven is like a mustard seed which a man takes and sows in his field .
CJB	Matthew	13	32	It is the smallest of all seeds , but when it grows up it is larger than any garden plant and becomes a tree , so that the birds flying about come and nest in its branches. ”
CJB	Matthew	13	33	And he told them yet another parable . “ The Kingdom of Heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed with a bushel of flour , then waited until the whole batch of dough rose. ”
CJB	Matthew	13	34	All these things Yeshua said to the crowds in parables ; indeed , he said nothing to them without using a parable .
CJB	Matthew	13	35	This was to fulfill what had been spoken through the prophet , “ I will open my mouth in parables , I will say what has been hidden since the creation of the universe. ” [ a ]
CJB	Matthew	13	36	Then he left the crowds and went into the house . His talmidim approached him and said , “ Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field. ”
CJB	Matthew	13	37	He answered , “ The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man ;
CJB	Matthew	13	38	the field is the world . As for the good seed , these are the people who belong to the Kingdom ; and the weeds are the people who belong to the Evil One .
CJB	Matthew	13	39	The enemy who sows them is the Adversary , the harvest is the end of the age , and the harvesters are angels .
CJB	Matthew	13	40	Just as the weeds are collected and burned up in the fire , so will it be at the end of the age .
CJB	Matthew	13	41	The Son of Man will send forth his angels , and they will collect out of his Kingdom all the things that cause people to sin and all the people who are far from Torah ;
CJB	Matthew	13	42	and they will throw them into the fiery furnace , where people will wail and grind their teeth .
CJB	Matthew	13	43	Then the righteous will shine forth like the sun in the Kingdom of their Father . Whoever has ears , let him hear !
CJB	Matthew	13	44	“ The Kingdom of Heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field . A man found it , hid it again , then in great joy went and sold everything he owned , and bought that field .
CJB	Matthew	13	45	“ Again , the Kingdom of Heaven is like a merchant on the lookout for fine pearls .
CJB	Matthew	13	46	On finding one very valuable pearl he went away , sold everything he owned and bought it .
CJB	Matthew	13	47	“ Once more , the Kingdom of Heaven is like a net thrown into the lake , that caught all kinds of fish .
CJB	Matthew	13	48	When it was full , the fishermen brought the net up onto the shore , sat down and collected the good fish in baskets , but threw the bad fish away .
CJB	Matthew	13	49	So it will be at the close of the age — the angels will go forth and separate the evil people from among the righteous
CJB	Matthew	13	50	and throw them into the fiery furnace , where they will wail and grind their teeth .
CJB	Matthew	13	51	“ Have you understood all these things ? ” “ Yes , ” they answered .
CJB	Matthew	13	52	He said to them , “ So then , every Torah-teacher who has been made into a talmid for the Kingdom of Heaven is like the owner of a home who brings out of his storage room both new things and old. ”
CJB	Matthew	13	53	When Yeshua had finished these parables , he left
CJB	Matthew	13	54	and went to his home town . There he taught them in their synagogue in a way that astounded them , so that they asked , “ Where do this man ’ s wisdom and miracles come from ?
CJB	Matthew	13	55	Isn ’ t he the carpenter ’ s son ? Isn ’ t his mother called Miryam ? and his brothers Ya ‘ akov , Yosef , Shim ‘ on and Y ’ hudah ?
CJB	Matthew	13	56	And his sisters , aren ’ t they all with us ? So where does he get all this ? ”
CJB	Matthew	13	57	And they took offense at him . But Yeshua said to them , “ The only place people don ’ t respect a prophet is in his home town and in his own house. ”
CJB	Matthew	13	58	And he did few miracles there because of their lack of trust . Footnotes - Matthew 13:35 Psalm 78:2
CJB	Matthew	14	14	So when he came ashore , he saw a huge crowd ; and , filled with compassion for them , he healed those of them who were sick .
CJB	Matthew	14	2	and said to his attendants , “ This must be Yochanan the Immerser . He has been raised from the dead ; that is why these miraculous powers are at work in him. ”
CJB	Matthew	14	3	For Herod had arrested Yochanan , put him in chains and thrown him in prison because of Herodias , the wife of his brother Philip ;
CJB	Matthew	14	4	since Yochanan had told Herod , “ It violates the Torah for you to have her as your wife. ”
CJB	Matthew	14	5	Herod had wanted to put Yochanan to death ; but he was afraid of the people , in whose eyes Yochanan was a prophet .
CJB	Matthew	14	6	However , at Herod ’ s birthday celebration , Herodias ’ daughter danced before the company and pleased Herod so much
CJB	Matthew	14	7	that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked .
CJB	Matthew	14	8	Prompted by her mother , she said , “ Give me here on a platter the head of Yochanan the Immerser. ”
CJB	Matthew	14	9	The king became deeply upset ; but out of regard for the oaths he had sworn before his dinner guests , he ordered that her wish be granted ,
CJB	Matthew	14	10	and sent and had Yochanan beheaded in prison .
CJB	Matthew	14	11	The head was brought on a platter to the girl , and she gave it to her mother .
CJB	Matthew	14	12	Yochanan ’ s talmidim came , took the body and buried it ; then they went and told Yeshua .
CJB	Matthew	14	13	On hearing about this , Yeshua left in a boat to be by himself in the wilderness . But the people learned of it and followed him from the towns by land .
CJB	Matthew	14	15	As evening approached , the talmidim came to him and said , “ This is a remote place and it ’ s getting late . Send the crowds away , so that they can go and buy food for themselves in the villages. ”
CJB	Matthew	14	16	But Yeshua replied , “ They don ’ t need to go away . Give them something to eat , yourselves ! ”
CJB	Matthew	14	17	“ All we have with us , ” they said , “ is five loaves of bread and two fish. ”
CJB	Matthew	14	18	He said , “ Bring them here to me. ”
CJB	Matthew	14	19	After instructing the crowds to sit down on the grass , he took the five loaves and the two fish and , looking up toward heaven , made a b ’ rakhah . Then he broke the loaves and gave them to the talmidim , who gave them to the crowds .
CJB	Matthew	14	20	They all ate as much as they wanted , and they took up twelve baskets full of the pieces left over .
CJB	Matthew	14	21	Those eating numbered about five thousand men , plus women and children .
CJB	Matthew	14	22	Immediately he had the talmidim get in the boat and go on ahead of him to the other side , while he sent the crowds away .
CJB	Matthew	14	23	After he had sent the crowds away , he went up into the hills by himself to pray . Night came on , and he was there alone .
CJB	Matthew	14	24	But by this time , the boat was several miles from shore , battling a rough sea and a headwind .
CJB	Matthew	14	25	Around four o ’ clock in the morning , he came toward them , walking on the lake !
CJB	Matthew	14	26	When the talmidim saw him walking on the lake , they were terrified . “ It ’ s a ghost ! ” they said and screamed with fear .
CJB	Matthew	14	27	But at once Yeshua spoke to them . “ Courage , ” he said , “ it is I . Stop being afraid. ”
CJB	Matthew	14	28	Then Kefa called to him , “ Lord , if it is really you , tell me to come to you on the water. ”
CJB	Matthew	14	29	“ Come ! ” he said . So Kefa got out of the boat and walked on the water toward Yeshua .
CJB	Matthew	14	30	But when he saw the wind , he became afraid ; and as he began to sink , he yelled , “ Lord ! Save me ! ”
CJB	Matthew	14	31	Yeshua immediately stretched out his hand , took hold of him , and said to him , “ Such little trust ! Why did you doubt ? ”
CJB	Matthew	14	32	As they went up into the boat , the wind ceased .
CJB	Matthew	14	33	The men in the boat fell down before him and exclaimed , “ You really are God ’ s son ! ”
CJB	Matthew	14	34	Having made the crossing , they landed at Ginosar .
CJB	Matthew	14	35	When the people of the place recognized him , they sent word throughout the neighborhood and brought him everyone who was ill.
CJB	Matthew	14	36	They begged him that the sick people might only touch the tzitzit on his robe , and all who touched it were completely healed .
CJB	Matthew	15	15	Kefa said to him , “ Explain the parable to us. ”
CJB	Matthew	15	2	“ Why is it that your talmidim break the Tradition of the Elders ? They don ’ t do n ’ tilat-yadayim before they eat ! ”
CJB	Matthew	15	3	He answered , “ Indeed , why do you break the command of God by your tradition ?
CJB	Matthew	15	4	For God said , ‘ Honor your father and mother , ’ [ a ] and ‘ Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death. ’ [ b ]
CJB	Matthew	15	5	But you say , ‘ If anyone says to his father or mother , “ I have promised to give to God what I might have used to help you , ”
CJB	Matthew	15	6	then he is rid of his duty to honor his father or mother. ’ Thus by your tradition you make null and void the word of God !
CJB	Matthew	15	7	You hypocrites ! Yesha ‘ yahu was right when he prophesied about you ,
CJB	Matthew	15	8	‘ These people honor me with their lips , but their hearts are far away from me .
CJB	Matthew	15	9	Their worship of me is useless , because they teach man-made rules as if they were doctrines. ’ ” [ c ]
CJB	Matthew	15	10	Then he called the crowd to him and said , “ Listen and understand this !
CJB	Matthew	15	11	What makes a person unclean is not what goes into his mouth ; rather , what comes out of his mouth , that is what makes him unclean ! ”
CJB	Matthew	15	12	The talmidim came to him and said , “ Do you know that the P ’ rushim were offended by what you said ? ”
CJB	Matthew	15	13	He replied , “ Every plant that my Father in heaven has not planted will be pulled up by the roots .
CJB	Matthew	15	14	Let them be . They are blind guides . When a blind man guides another blind man , both will fall in a pit. ”
CJB	Matthew	15	16	So he said , “ Don ’ t you understand even now ?
CJB	Matthew	15	17	Don ’ t you see that anything that enters the mouth goes into the stomach and passes out into the latrine ?
CJB	Matthew	15	18	But what comes out of your mouth is actually coming from your heart , and that is what makes a person unclean .
CJB	Matthew	15	19	For out of the heart come forth wicked thoughts , murder , adultery and other kinds of sexual immorality , theft , lies , slanders . . . .
CJB	Matthew	15	20	These are what really make a person unclean , but eating without doing n ’ tilat-yadayim does not make a person unclean. ”
CJB	Matthew	15	21	Yeshua left that place and went off to the region of Tzor and Tzidon .
CJB	Matthew	15	22	A woman from Kena ‘ an who was living there came to him , pleading , “ Sir , have pity on me . Son of David ! My daughter is cruelly held under the power of demons ! ”
CJB	Matthew	15	23	But Yeshua did not say a word to her . Then his talmidim came to him and urged him , “ Send her away , because she is following us and keeps pestering us with her crying. ”
CJB	Matthew	15	24	He said , “ I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Isra ’ el. ”
CJB	Matthew	15	25	But she came , fell at his feet and said , “ Sir , help me ! ”
CJB	Matthew	15	26	He answered , “ It is not right to take the children ’ s food and toss it to their pet dogs. ”
CJB	Matthew	15	27	She said , “ That is true , sir , but even the dogs eat the leftovers that fall from their master ’ s table. ”
CJB	Matthew	15	28	Then Yeshua answered her , “ Lady , you are a person of great trust . Let your desire be granted. ” And her daughter was healed at that very moment .
CJB	Matthew	15	29	Yeshua left there and went along the shore of Lake Kinneret . He climbed a hill and sat down ;
CJB	Matthew	15	30	and large crowds came to him , bringing with them the lame , the blind , the crippled , the mute and many others . They laid them at his feet , and he healed them .
CJB	Matthew	15	31	The people were amazed as they saw mute people speaking , crippled people cured , lame people walking and blind people seeing ; and they said a b ’ rakhah to the God of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Matthew	15	32	Yeshua called his talmidim to him and said , “ I feel sorry for these people , because they have been with me three days , and now they have nothing to eat . I don ’ t want to send them away hungry , because they might collapse on the way home. ”
CJB	Matthew	15	33	The talmidim said to him , “ Where will we find enough loaves of bread in this remote place to satisfy so big a crowd ? ”
CJB	Matthew	15	34	Yeshua asked them , “ How many loaves do you have ? ” They said , “ Seven , and a few fish. ”
CJB	Matthew	15	35	After telling the crowd to sit down on the ground ,
CJB	Matthew	15	36	he took the seven loaves and the fish , made a b ’ rakhah , broke the loaves and gave them to the talmidim , who gave them to the people .
CJB	Matthew	15	37	Everyone ate his fill , and they took seven large baskets full of the leftover pieces .
CJB	Matthew	15	38	Those eating numbered four thousand men , plus women and children .
CJB	Matthew	15	39	After sending the crowd away , he got in the boat and went off to the region of Magadan . Footnotes - Matthew 15:4 Exodus 20:12 ; Deuteronomy 5:16 - Matthew 15:4 Exodus 21:17 ; Leviticus 20:9 - Matthew 15:9 Isaiah 29:13
CJB	Matthew	16	16	Shim ‘ on Kefa answered , “ You are the Mashiach , the Son of the living God. ”
CJB	Matthew	16	2	But his response was , “ When it is evening , you say , ‘ Fair weather ahead , ’ because the sky is red ;
CJB	Matthew	16	3	and in the morning you say , ‘ Storm today ! ’ because the sky is red and overcast . You know how to read the appearance of the sky , but you can ’ t read the signs of the times !
CJB	Matthew	16	4	A wicked and adulterous generation is asking for a sign ? It will certainly not be given a sign — except the sign of Yonah ! ” With that he left them and went off .
CJB	Matthew	16	5	The talmidim , in crossing to the other side of the lake , had forgotten to bring any bread .
CJB	Matthew	16	6	So when Yeshua said to them , “ Watch out ! Guard yourselves against the hametz of the P ’ rushim and Tz ’ dukim , ”
CJB	Matthew	16	7	they thought he said it because they hadn ’ t brought bread .
CJB	Matthew	16	8	But Yeshua , aware of this , said , “ Such little trust you have ! Why are you talking with each other about not having bread ?
CJB	Matthew	16	9	Don ’ t you understand yet ? Don ’ t you remember the five loaves of the five thousand and how many baskets you filled ?
CJB	Matthew	16	10	Or the seven loaves of the four thousand and how many baskets you filled ?
CJB	Matthew	16	11	How can you possibly think I was talking to you about bread ? Guard yourselves from the hametz of the P ’ rushim and Tz ’ dukim ! ”
CJB	Matthew	16	12	Then they understood — they were to guard themselves not from yeast for bread but from the teaching of the P ’ rushim and Tz ’ dukim .
CJB	Matthew	16	13	When Yeshua came into the territory around Caesarea Philippi , he asked his talmidim , “ Who are people saying the Son of Man is ? ”
CJB	Matthew	16	14	They said , “ Well , some say Yochanan the Immerser , others Eliyahu , still others Yirmeyahu or one of the prophets. ”
CJB	Matthew	16	15	“ But you , ” he said to them , “ who do you say I am ? ”
CJB	Matthew	16	17	“ Shim ‘ on Bar-Yochanan , ” Yeshua said to him , “ how blessed you are ! For no human being revealed this to you , no , it was my Father in heaven .
CJB	Matthew	16	18	I also tell you this : you are Kefa , ” [ which means ‘ Rock , ’ ] “ and on this rock I will build my Community , and the gates of Sh ’ ol will not overcome it .
CJB	Matthew	16	19	I will give you the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven . Whatever you prohibit on earth will be prohibited in heaven , and whatever you permit on earth will be permitted in heaven. ”
CJB	Matthew	16	20	Then he warned the talmidim not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah .
CJB	Matthew	16	21	From that time on , Yeshua began making it clear to his talmidim that he had to go to Yerushalayim and endure much suffering at the hands of the elders , the head cohanim and the Torah-teachers ; and that he had to be put to death ; but that on the third day , he had to be raised to life .
CJB	Matthew	16	22	Kefa took him aside and began rebuking him , “ Heaven be merciful , Lord ! By no means will this happen to you ! ”
CJB	Matthew	16	23	But Yeshua turned his back on Kefa , saying , “ Get behind me , Satan ! You are an obstacle in my path , because your thinking is from a human perspective , not from God ’ s perspective ! ”
CJB	Matthew	16	24	Then Yeshua told his talmidim , “ If anyone wants to come after me , let him say ‘ No ’ to himself , take up his execution-stake , and keep following me .
CJB	Matthew	16	25	For whoever wants to save his own life will destroy it , but whoever destroys his life for my sake will find it .
CJB	Matthew	16	26	What good will it do someone if he gains the whole world but forfeits his life ? Or , what can a person give in exchange for his life ?
CJB	Matthew	16	27	For the Son of Man will come in his Father ’ s glory , with his angels ; and then he will repay everyone according to his conduct .
CJB	Matthew	16	28	Yes ! I tell you that there are some people standing here who will not experience death until they see the Son of Man coming in his Kingdom ! ”
CJB	Matthew	17	17	Yeshua answered , “ Perverted people , without any trust ! How long will I be with you ? How long must I put up with you ? Bring him here to me ! ”
CJB	Matthew	17	2	As they watched , he began to change form — his face shone like the sun , and his clothing became as white as light .
CJB	Matthew	17	3	Then they looked and saw Moshe and Eliyahu speaking with him .
CJB	Matthew	17	4	Kefa said to Yeshua , “ It ’ s good that we ’ re here , Lord . I ’ ll put up three shelters if you want — one for you , one for Moshe and one for Eliyahu. ”
CJB	Matthew	17	5	While he was still speaking , a bright cloud enveloped them ; and a voice from the cloud said , “ This is my Son , whom I love , with whom I am well pleased . Listen to him ! ”
CJB	Matthew	17	6	When the talmidim heard this , they were so frightened that they fell face down on the ground .
CJB	Matthew	17	7	But Yeshua came and touched them . “ Get up ! ” he said , “ Don ’ t be afraid. ”
CJB	Matthew	17	8	So they opened their eyes , looked up and saw only Yeshua by himself .
CJB	Matthew	17	9	As they came down the mountain , Yeshua ordered them , “ Don ’ t tell anyone what you have seen until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead. ”
CJB	Matthew	17	10	The talmidim asked him , “ Then why do the Torah-teachers say that Eliyahu must come first ? ”
CJB	Matthew	17	11	He answered , “ On the one hand , Eliyahu is coming and will restore all things ;
CJB	Matthew	17	12	on the other hand , I tell you that Eliyahu has come already , and people did not recognize him but did whatever they pleased to him . In the same way , the Son of Man too is about to suffer at their hands. ”
CJB	Matthew	17	13	Then the talmidim understood that he was talking to them about Yochanan the Immerser .
CJB	Matthew	17	14	As they came up to the crowd , a man approached Yeshua , kneeled down in front of him ,
CJB	Matthew	17	15	and said , “ Sir , have mercy on my son , because he is an epileptic and has such terrible fits that he often falls into the fire or into the water .
CJB	Matthew	17	16	I brought him to your talmidim , but they couldn ’ t heal him. ”
CJB	Matthew	17	18	Yeshua rebuked the demon , and it came out of the boy , so that from that moment he was healed .
CJB	Matthew	17	19	Then the talmidim went to him privately and said , “ Why couldn ’ t we drive it out ? ”
CJB	Matthew	17	20	He said to them , “ Because you have such little trust ! Yes ! I tell you that if you have trust as tiny as a mustard seed , you will be able to say to this mountain , ‘ Move from here to there ! ’ and it will move ; indeed , nothing will be impossible for you ! ”
CJB	Matthew	17	21	: But this kind does not go out except through prayer and fasting . ”
CJB	Matthew	17	22	As they were going about together in the Galil , Yeshua said to them , “ The Son of Man is about to be betrayed into the hands of people
CJB	Matthew	17	23	who will put him to death , and on the third day he will be raised. ” And they were filled with sadness .
CJB	Matthew	17	24	When they came to K ’ far-Nachum , the collectors of the half-shekel came to Kefa and said , “ Doesn ’ t your rabbi pay the Temple tax ? ”
CJB	Matthew	17	25	“ Of course he does , ” said Kefa . When he arrived home , Yeshua spoke first . “ Shim ‘ on , what ’ s your opinion ? The kings of the earth — from whom do they collect duties and taxes ? From their sons or from others ? ”
CJB	Matthew	17	26	“ From others , ” he answered . “ Then , ” said Yeshua , “ The sons are exempt .
CJB	Matthew	17	27	But to avoid offending them — go to the lake , throw out a line , and take the first fish you catch . Open its mouth , and you will find a shekel . Take it and give it to them for me and for you. ” Footnotes - Matthew 17:21 Some manuscripts include verse
CJB	Matthew	18	18	Yes ! I tell you people that whatever you prohibit on earth will be prohibited in heaven , and whatever you permit on earth will be permitted in heaven .
CJB	Matthew	18	2	He called a child to him , stood him among them ,
CJB	Matthew	18	3	and said , “ Yes ! I tell you that unless you change and become like little children , you won ’ t even enter the Kingdom of Heaven !
CJB	Matthew	18	4	So the greatest in the Kingdom is whoever makes himself as humble as this child .
CJB	Matthew	18	5	Whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me ;
CJB	Matthew	18	6	and whoever ensnares one of these little ones who trust me , it would be better for him to have a millstone hung around his neck and be drowned in the open sea !
CJB	Matthew	18	7	Woe to the world because of snares ! For there must be snares , but woe to the person who sets the snare !
CJB	Matthew	18	8	“ So if your hand or foot becomes a snare for you , cut it off and throw it away ! Better that you should be maimed or crippled and obtain eternal life than keep both hands or both feet and be thrown into everlasting fire !
CJB	Matthew	18	9	And if your eye is a snare for you , gouge it out and fling it away ! Better that you should be one-eyed and obtain eternal life than keep both eyes and be thrown into the fire of Gei-Hinnom .
CJB	Matthew	18	10	See that you never despise one of these little ones , for I tell you that their angels in heaven are continually seeing the face of my Father in heaven .
CJB	Matthew	18	11	: For the Son of Man came to save the lost . - Matthew 18:16 Deuteronomy 19:15
CJB	Matthew	18	12	“ What ’ s your opinion ? What will somebody do who has a hundred sheep , and one of them wanders away ? Won ’ t he leave the ninety-nine on the hillsides and go off to find the stray ?
CJB	Matthew	18	13	And if he happens to find it ? Yes ! I tell you he is happier over it than over the ninety-nine that never strayed !
CJB	Matthew	18	14	Thus your Father in heaven does not want even one of these little ones to be lost .
CJB	Matthew	18	15	“ Moreover , if your brother commits a sin against you , go and show him his fault — but privately , just between the two of you . If he listens to you , you have won back your brother .
CJB	Matthew	18	16	If he doesn ’ t listen , take one or two others with you so that every accusation can be supported by the testimony of two or three witnesses . [ b ]
CJB	Matthew	18	17	If he refuses to hear them , tell the congregation ; and if he refuses to listen even to the congregation , treat him as you would a pagan or a tax-collector .

CJB	Matthew	18	20	For wherever two or three are assembled in my name , I am there with them. ”
CJB	Matthew	18	21	Then Kefa came up and said to him , “ Rabbi , how often can my brother sin against me and I have to forgive him ? As many as seven times ? ”
CJB	Matthew	18	22	“ No , not seven times , ” answered Yeshua , “ but seventy times seven !
CJB	Matthew	18	23	Because of this , the Kingdom of Heaven may be compared with a king who decided to settle accounts with his deputies .
CJB	Matthew	18	24	Right away they brought forward a man who owed him many millions ;
CJB	Matthew	18	25	and since he couldn ’ t pay , his master ordered that he , his wife , his children and all his possessions be sold to pay the debt .
CJB	Matthew	18	26	But the servant fell down before him . ‘ Be patient with me , ’ he begged , ‘ and I will pay back everything. ’
CJB	Matthew	18	27	So out of pity for him , the master let him go and forgave the debt .
CJB	Matthew	18	28	“ But as that servant was leaving , he came upon one of his fellow servants who owed him some tiny sum . He grabbed him and began to choke him , crying , ‘ Pay back what you owe me ! ’
CJB	Matthew	18	29	His fellow servant fell before him and begged , ‘ Be patient with me , and I will pay you back. ’
CJB	Matthew	18	30	But he refused ; instead , he had him thrown in jail until he should repay the debt .
CJB	Matthew	18	31	When the other servants saw what had happened , they were extremely distressed ; and they went and told their master everything that had taken place .
CJB	Matthew	18	32	Then the master summoned his servant and said , ‘ You wicked servant ! I forgave you all that debt just because you begged me to do it .
CJB	Matthew	18	33	Shouldn ’ t you have had pity on your fellow servant , just as I had pity on you ? ’
CJB	Matthew	18	34	And in anger his master turned him over to the jailers for punishment until he paid back everything he owed .
CJB	Matthew	18	35	This is how my heavenly Father will treat you , unless you each forgive your brother from your hearts. ” Footnotes - Matthew 18:11 Some manuscripts include verse

CJB	Matthew	19	2	Great crowds followed him , and he healed them there .

CJB	Matthew	19	4	He replied , “ Haven ’ t you read that at the beginning the Creator made them male and female , [ a ]
CJB	Matthew	19	5	and that he said , ‘ For this reason a man should leave his father and mother and be united with his wife , and the two are to become one flesh ’ ? [ b ]
CJB	Matthew	19	6	Thus they are no longer two , but one . So then , no one should split apart what God has joined together. ”
CJB	Matthew	19	7	They said to him , “ Then why did Moshe give the commandment that a man should hand his wife a get and divorce her ? ” [ c ]
CJB	Matthew	19	8	He answered , “ Moshe allowed you to divorce your wives because your hearts are so hardened . But this is not how it was at the beginning .
CJB	Matthew	19	9	Now what I say to you is that whoever divorces his wife , except on the ground of sexual immorality , and marries another woman commits adultery ! ”
CJB	Matthew	19	10	The talmidim said to him , “ If that is how things are between husband and wife , it would be better not to marry ! ”
CJB	Matthew	19	11	He said to them , “ Not everyone grasps this teaching , only those for whom it is meant .
CJB	Matthew	19	12	For there are different reasons why men do not marry — some because they were born without the desire , some because they have been castrated , and some because they have renounced marriage for the sake of the Kingdom of Heaven . Whoever can grasp this , let him do so. ”
CJB	Matthew	19	13	Then children were brought to him so that he might lay his hands on them and pray for them , but the talmidim rebuked the people bringing them .
CJB	Matthew	19	14	However , Yeshua said , “ Let the children come to me , don ’ t stop them , for the Kingdom of Heaven belongs to such as these. ”
CJB	Matthew	19	15	Then , after laying his hands on them , he went on his way .
CJB	Matthew	19	16	A man approached Yeshua and said , “ Rabbi , what good thing should I do in order to have eternal life ? ” He said to him ,
CJB	Matthew	19	17	“ Why are you asking me about good ? There is One who is good ! But if you want to obtain eternal life , observe the mitzvot. ”
CJB	Matthew	19	18	The man asked him , “ Which ones ? ” and Yeshua said , “ Don ’ t murder , don ’ t commit adultery , don ’ t steal , don ’ t give false testimony [ d ]
CJB	Matthew	19	20	The young man said to him , “ I have kept all these ; where do I still fall short ? ”
CJB	Matthew	19	21	Yeshua said to him , “ If you are serious about reaching the goal , go and sell your possessions , give to the poor , and you will have riches in heaven . Then come , follow me ! ”
CJB	Matthew	19	22	But when the young man heard this , he went away sad , because he was wealthy .
CJB	Matthew	19	23	Then Yeshua said to his talmidim , “ Yes . I tell you that it will be very hard for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of Heaven .
CJB	Matthew	19	24	Furthermore , I tell you that it is easier for a camel to pass through a needle ’ s eye than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God. ”
CJB	Matthew	19	25	When the talmidim heard this they were utterly amazed . “ Then who , ” they asked , “ can be saved ? ”
CJB	Matthew	19	26	Yeshua looked at them and said , “ Humanly , this is impossible ; but with God everything is possible. ”
CJB	Matthew	19	27	Kefa replied , “ Look , we have left everything and followed you . So what will we have ? ”
CJB	Matthew	19	28	Yeshua said to them , “ Yes . I tell you that in the regenerated world , when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne , you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones and judge the twelve tribes of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Matthew	19	29	Everyone who has left houses , brothers , sisters , father , mother , children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times more , and he will obtain eternal life .
CJB	Matthew	19	30	But many who are first will be last , and many who are last will be first . Footnotes - Matthew 19:4 Genesis 1:27 , 5:2 - Matthew 19:5 Genesis 2:24 - Matthew 19:7 Deuteronomy 24:1 ,
CJB	Matthew	20	20	Then Zavdai ’ s sons came to Yeshua with their mother . She bowed down , begging a favor from him .
CJB	Matthew	20	2	After agreeing with the workers on a wage of one denarius , [ the standard daily wage , ] he sent them off to his vineyard .
CJB	Matthew	20	3	Then , on going out at about nine in the morning , he saw more men standing around in the market-square doing nothing ,
CJB	Matthew	20	4	and said to them , ‘ You go to the vineyard too — I ’ ll pay you a fair wage. ’ So they went .
CJB	Matthew	20	5	At noon , and again around three in the afternoon , he did the same thing .
CJB	Matthew	20	6	About an hour before sundown , he went out , found still others standing around , and asked them , ‘ Why have you been standing here all day , doing nothing ? ”
CJB	Matthew	20	7	They said to him , ‘ Because no one hired us. ’ ‘ You too , ’ he told them , ‘ go to the vineyard. ’
CJB	Matthew	20	8	“ When evening came , the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman , ‘ Call the workers and pay them their wages , starting with the last ones hired and ending with the first. ’
CJB	Matthew	20	9	The workers who came an hour before sunset each received a denarius ,
CJB	Matthew	20	10	so the workers who came first expected they would get more , but each of them also received just a denarius .
CJB	Matthew	20	11	On receiving their wages , they began grumbling to the farmer ,
CJB	Matthew	20	12	‘ These latecomers have worked only one hour , while we have borne the brunt of the day ’ s work in the hot sun , yet you have put them on an equal footing with us ! ’
CJB	Matthew	20	13	But he answered one of them , ‘ Look , friend , I ’ m not being unfair with you . Didn ’ t you agree to work today for a denarius ?
CJB	Matthew	20	14	Now take your pay and go ! I choose to give the last worker as much as I ’ m giving you .
CJB	Matthew	20	15	Haven ’ t I the right to do what I want with what belongs to me ? Or do you begrudge my generosity ? ’
CJB	Matthew	20	16	Thus the last ones will be first and the first last. ”
CJB	Matthew	20	17	As Yeshua was going up to Yerushalayim , he took the twelve talmidim aside by themselves and said to them , as they went on their way ,
CJB	Matthew	20	18	“ We are now going up to Yerushalayim , where the Son of Man will be handed over to the head cohanim and Torah-teachers . They will sentence him to death
CJB	Matthew	20	19	and turn him over to the Goyim , who will jeer at him , beat him and execute him on a stake as a criminal . But on the third day , he will be raised. ”
CJB	Matthew	20	21	He said to her , “ What do you want ? ” She replied , “ Promise that when you become king , these two sons of mine may sit , one on your right and the other on your left. ”
CJB	Matthew	20	22	But Yeshua answered , “ You people don ’ t know what you are asking . Can you drink the cup that I am about to drink ? ” They said to him , “ We can. ”
CJB	Matthew	20	23	He said to them , “ Yes , you will drink my cup . But to sit on my right and on my left is not mine to give , it is for those for whom my Father has prepared it. ”
CJB	Matthew	20	24	Now when the other ten heard about this , they were outraged at the two brothers .
CJB	Matthew	20	25	But Yeshua called them and said , “ You know that among the Goyim , those who are supposed to rule them become tyrants , and their superiors become dictators .
CJB	Matthew	20	26	Among you , it must not be like that . On the contrary , whoever among you wants to be a leader must become your servant ,
CJB	Matthew	20	27	and whoever wants to be first must be your slave !
CJB	Matthew	20	28	For the Son of Man did not come to be served , but to serve — and to give his life as a ransom for many. ”
CJB	Matthew	20	29	As they were leaving Yericho , a large crowd followed Yeshua .
CJB	Matthew	20	30	Two blind men sitting by the side of the road heard that he was passing by and shouted , “ Son of David ! Have pity on us ! ”
CJB	Matthew	20	31	The crowd scolded them and told them to be quiet , but they shouted all the louder , “ Lord ! Son of David ! Have pity on us ! ”
CJB	Matthew	20	32	Yeshua stopped , called them and said , “ What do you want me to do for you ? ”
CJB	Matthew	20	33	They said to him , “ Lord , open our eyes. ”
CJB	Matthew	20	34	Filled with tenderness , Yeshua touched their eyes ; and instantly they received their sight and followed him .
CJB	Matthew	21	21	Yeshua answered them , “ Yes ! I tell you , if you have trust and don ’ t doubt , you will not only do what was done to this fig tree ; but even if you say to this mountain , ‘ Go and throw yourself into the sea ! ’ it will be done .

CJB	Matthew	21	3	If anyone says anything to you , tell him , ‘ The Lord needs them ’ ; and he will let them go at once. ”
CJB	Matthew	21	4	This happened in order to fulfill what had been spoken through the prophet ,
CJB	Matthew	21	5	“ Say to the daughter of Tziyon , ‘ Look ! Your King is coming to you , riding humbly on a donkey , and on a colt , the offspring of a beast of burden ! ’ [ a ]
CJB	Matthew	21	6	So the talmidim went and did as Yeshua had directed them .
CJB	Matthew	21	7	They brought the donkey and the colt and put their robes on them , and Yeshua sat on them .
CJB	Matthew	21	8	Crowds of people carpeted the road with their clothing , while others cut branches from trees and spread them on the road .
CJB	Matthew	21	9	The crowds ahead of him and behind shouted , “ Please ! Deliver us ! ” [ b ] to the Son of David ; “ Blessed is he who comes in the name of Adonai ! ”
CJB	Matthew	21	10	When he entered Yerushalayim , the whole city was stirred . “ Who is this ? ” they asked .
CJB	Matthew	21	11	And the crowds answered , “ This is Yeshua , the prophet from Natzeret in the Galil. ”
CJB	Matthew	21	12	Yeshua entered the Temple grounds and drove out those who were doing business there , both the merchants and their customers . He upset the desks of the money-changers and knocked over the benches of those who were selling pigeons .
CJB	Matthew	21	13	He said to them , “ It has been written , ‘ My house will be called a house of prayer. ’ [ e ] But you are making it into a den of robbers ! ” [ f ]
CJB	Matthew	21	14	Blind and lame people came up to him in the Temple , and he healed them .
CJB	Matthew	21	15	But when the head cohanim and Torah-teachers saw the wonderful things he was doing , and the children crying out in the Temple , “ Please deliver us ! ” [ g ] to the Son of David , they were furious .
CJB	Matthew	21	16	They said to him , “ Do you hear what they ’ re saying ? ” Yeshua replied , “ Of course ! Haven ’ t you ever read , ‘ From the mouth of children and infants you have prepared praise for yourself ’ ? ” [ h ]
CJB	Matthew	21	17	With that , he left them and went outside the city to Beit-Anyah , where he spent the night .
CJB	Matthew	21	18	The next morning , on his way back to the city , he felt hungry .
CJB	Matthew	21	19	Spotting a fig tree by the road , he went up to it but found nothing on it except leaves . So he said to it , “ May you never again bear fruit ! ” and immediately the fig tree dried up .
CJB	Matthew	21	20	The talmidim saw this and were amazed . “ How did the fig tree dry up so quickly ? ” they asked .
CJB	Matthew	21	22	In other words , you will receive everything you ask for in prayer , no matter what it is , provided you have trust. ”
CJB	Matthew	21	23	He went into the Temple area ; and as he was teaching , the head cohanim and the elders of the people approached him and demanded , “ What s ’ mikhah do you have that authorizes you to do these things ? And who gave you this s ’ mikhah ? ”
CJB	Matthew	21	24	Yeshua answered , “ I too will ask you a question . If you answer it , then I will tell you by what s ’ mikhah I do these things .
CJB	Matthew	21	25	The immersion of Yochanan — where did it come from ? From Heaven or from a human source ? ” They discussed it among themselves : “ If we say , ‘ From Heaven , ’ he will say , ‘ Then why didn ’ t you believe him ? ’
CJB	Matthew	21	26	But if we say , ‘ From a human source , ’ we are afraid of the people , for they all regard Yochanan as a prophet. ”
CJB	Matthew	21	27	So they answered Yeshua , “ We don ’ t know. ” And he replied , “ Then I won ’ t tell you by what s ’ mikhah I do these things .
CJB	Matthew	21	28	“ But give me your opinion : a man had two sons . He went to the first and said , ‘ Son , go and work today in the vineyard. ’
CJB	Matthew	21	29	He answered , ‘ I don ’ t want to ’ ; but later he changed his mind and went .
CJB	Matthew	21	30	The father went to his other son and said the same thing . This one answered , ‘ I will , sir ’ ; but he didn ’ t go .
CJB	Matthew	21	31	Which of the two did what his father wanted ? ” “ The first , ” they replied . “ That ’ s right ! ” Yeshua said to them . “ I tell you that the tax-collectors and prostitutes are going into the Kingdom of God ahead of you !
CJB	Matthew	21	32	For Yochanan came to you showing the path to righteousness , and you wouldn ’ t trust him . The tax-collectors and prostitutes trusted him ; but you , even after you saw this , didn ’ t change your minds later and trust him .
CJB	Matthew	21	33	“ Now listen to another parable . There was a farmer who planted a vineyard . He put a wall around it , dug a pit for the winepress and built a tower ; then he rented it to tenants and left .
CJB	Matthew	21	34	When harvest-time came , he sent his servants to the tenants to collect his share of the crop .
CJB	Matthew	21	35	But the tenants seized his servants — this one they beat up , that one they killed , another they stoned .
CJB	Matthew	21	36	So he sent some other servants , more than the first group , and they did the same to them .
CJB	Matthew	21	37	Finally , he sent them his son , saying , ‘ My son they will respect. ’
CJB	Matthew	21	38	But when the tenants saw the son , they said to each other , ‘ This is the heir . Come , let ’ s kill him and take his inheritance ! ’
CJB	Matthew	21	39	So they grabbed him , threw him out of the vineyard and killed him .
CJB	Matthew	21	40	Now when the owner of the vineyard comes , what will he do to those tenants ? ”
CJB	Matthew	21	41	They answered him , “ He will viciously destroy those vicious men and rent out the vineyard to other tenants who will give him his share of the crop when it ’ s due. ”
CJB	Matthew	21	42	Yeshua said to them , “ Haven ’ t you ever read in the Tanakh , ‘ The very rock which the builders rejected has become the cornerstone ! This has come from Adonai , and in our eyes it is amazing ’ ? [ i ]
CJB	Matthew	21	43	Therefore , I tell you that the Kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to the kind of people that will produce its fruit ! ”
CJB	Matthew	21	44	: Whoever falls on this stone will be broken in pieces ; but if it falls on him , he will be crushed to powder ! ”
CJB	Matthew	21	45	As the head cohanim and the P ’ rushim listened to his stories , they saw that he was speaking about them .
CJB	Matthew	21	46	But when they set about to arrest him , they were afraid of the crowds ; because the crowds considered him a prophet .

CJB	Matthew	22	22	On hearing this , they were amazed ; and they left him and went away .
CJB	Matthew	22	2	“ The Kingdom of Heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding feast for his son ,
CJB	Matthew	22	3	but when he sent his slaves to summon the invited guests to the wedding , they refused to come .
CJB	Matthew	22	4	So he sent some more slaves , instructing them to tell the guests , ‘ Look , I ’ ve prepared my banquet , I ’ ve slaughtered my bulls and my fattened cattle , and everything is ready . Come to the wedding ! ’
CJB	Matthew	22	5	But they weren ’ t interested and went off , one to his farm , another to his business ;
CJB	Matthew	22	6	and the rest grabbed his slaves , mistreated them and killed them .
CJB	Matthew	22	7	The king was furious and sent his soldiers , who killed those murderers and burned down their city .
CJB	Matthew	22	8	“ Then he said to his slaves , ‘ Well , the wedding feast is ready ; but the ones who were invited didn ’ t deserve it .
CJB	Matthew	22	9	So go out to the street-corners and invite to the banquet as many as you find. ’
CJB	Matthew	22	10	The slaves went out into the streets , gathered all the people they could find , the bad along with the good ; and the wedding hall was filled with guests .
CJB	Matthew	22	11	“ Now when the king came in to look at the guests , he saw there a man who wasn ’ t dressed for a wedding ; so he asked him ,
CJB	Matthew	22	12	‘ Friend , how did you get in here without wedding clothes ? ’ The man was speechless .
CJB	Matthew	22	13	Then the king said to the servants , ‘ Bind him hand and foot , and throw him outside in the dark ! ’ In that place people will wail and grind their teeth ,
CJB	Matthew	22	14	for many are invited , but few are chosen. ”
CJB	Matthew	22	15	Then the P ’ rushim went away and put together a plan to trap Yeshua with his own words .
CJB	Matthew	22	16	They sent him some of their talmidim and some members of Herod ’ s party . They said , “ Rabbi , we know that you tell the truth and really teach what God ’ s way is . You aren ’ t concerned with what other people think about you , since you pay no attention to a person ’ s status .
CJB	Matthew	22	17	So tell us your opinion : does Torah permit paying taxes to the Roman Emperor or not ? ”
CJB	Matthew	22	18	Yeshua , however , knowing their malicious intent , said , “ You hypocrites ! Why are you trying to trap me ?
CJB	Matthew	22	19	Show me the coin used to pay the tax ! ” They brought him a denarius ;
CJB	Matthew	22	20	and he asked them , “ Whose name and picture are these ? ”
CJB	Matthew	22	21	“ The Emperor ’ s , ” they replied . Yeshua said to them , “ Nu , give the Emperor what belongs to the Emperor . And give to God what belongs to God ! ”
CJB	Matthew	22	23	That same day , some Tz ’ dukim came to him . They are the ones who say there is no such thing as resurrection , so they put to him a sh ’ eilah :
CJB	Matthew	22	24	“ Rabbi , Moshe said , ‘ If a man dies childless , his brother must marry his widow and have children to preserve the man ’ s family line. ’ [ a ]
CJB	Matthew	22	25	There were seven brothers . The first one married and then died ; and since he had no children , he left his widow to his brother .
CJB	Matthew	22	26	The same thing happened to the second brother , and the third , and finally to all seven .
CJB	Matthew	22	27	After them all , the woman died .
CJB	Matthew	22	28	Now in the Resurrection — of the seven , whose wife will she be ? For they all married her. ”
CJB	Matthew	22	29	Yeshua answered them , “ The reason you go astray is that you are ignorant both of the Tanakh and of the power of God .
CJB	Matthew	22	30	For in the Resurrection , neither men nor women will marry ; rather , they will be like angels in heaven .
CJB	Matthew	22	31	And as for whether the dead are resurrected , haven ’ t you read what God said to you ,
CJB	Matthew	22	32	‘ I am the God of Avraham , the God of Yitz ’ chak and the God of Ya ‘ akov ’ ? [ b ] He is God not of the dead but of the living ! ”
CJB	Matthew	22	33	When the crowds heard how he taught , they were astounded ;
CJB	Matthew	22	34	but when the P ’ rushim learned that he had silenced the Tz ’ dukim , they got together ,
CJB	Matthew	22	35	and one of them who was a Torah expert asked a sh ’ eilah to trap him :
CJB	Matthew	22	36	“ Rabbi , which of the mitzvot in the Torah is the most important ? ”
CJB	Matthew	22	37	He told him , “ ‘ You are to love Adonai your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength. ’ [ c ]
CJB	Matthew	22	38	This is the greatest and most important mitzvah .
CJB	Matthew	22	39	And a second is similar to it , ‘ You are to love your neighbor as yourself. ’ [ d ]
CJB	Matthew	22	40	All of the Torah and the Prophets are dependent on these two mitzvot. ”
CJB	Matthew	22	41	Then , turning to the assembled P ’ rushim , Yeshua put a sh ’ eilah to them :
CJB	Matthew	22	42	“ Tell me your view concerning the Messiah : whose son is he ? ” They said to him , “ David ’ s. ”
CJB	Matthew	22	43	“ Then how is it , ” he asked them , “ that David , inspired by the Spirit , calls him ‘ Lord , ’ when he says ,
CJB	Matthew	22	44	‘ Adonai said to my Lord , “ Sit here at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet ” ’ ? [ e ]
CJB	Matthew	22	45	If David thus calls him ‘ Lord , ’ how is he his son ? ”
CJB	Matthew	22	46	No one could think of anything to say in reply ; and from that day on , no one dared put to him another sh ’ eilah . Footnotes - Matthew 22:24 Deuteronomy 25:5–6 - Matthew 22:32 Exodus 3:6 - Matthew 22:37 Deuteronomy 6:5 - Matthew 22:39 Leviticus 19:18 - Matthew 22:44 Psalm 110:1

CJB	Matthew	23	4	They tie heavy loads onto people ’ s shoulders but won ’ t lift a finger to help carry them .
CJB	Matthew	23	5	Everything they do is done to be seen by others ; for they make their t ’ fillin broad and their tzitziyot long ,

CJB	Matthew	23	7	and they love being greeted deferentially in the marketplaces and being called ‘ Rabbi. ’
CJB	Matthew	23	8	“ But you are not to let yourselves be called ‘ Rabbi ’ ; because you have one Rabbi , and you are all each other ’ s brothers .

CJB	Matthew	23	24	Blind guides ! — straining out a gnat , meanwhile swallowing a camel !
CJB	Matthew	23	25	“ Woe to you hypocritical Torah-teachers and P ’ rushim ! You clean the outside of the cup and the dish , but inside they are full of robbery and self-indulgence .
CJB	Matthew	23	26	Blind Parush ! First clean the inside of the cup , so that the outside may be clean too .
CJB	Matthew	23	27	“ Woe to you hypocritical Torah-teachers and P ’ rushim ! You are like whitewashed tombs , which look fine on the outside but inside are full of dead people ’ s bones and all kinds of rottenness .
CJB	Matthew	23	28	Likewise , you appear to people from the outside to be good and honest , but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and far from Torah .
CJB	Matthew	23	29	“ Woe to you hypocritical Torah-teachers and P ’ rushim ! You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the graves of the tzaddikim ,
CJB	Matthew	23	30	and you say , ‘ Had we lived when our fathers did , we would never have taken part in killing the prophets. ’
CJB	Matthew	23	31	In this you testify against yourselves that you are worthy descendants of those who murdered the prophets .
CJB	Matthew	23	32	Go ahead then , finish what your fathers started !
CJB	Matthew	23	33	“ You snakes ! Sons of snakes ! How can you escape being condemned to Gei-Hinnom ?
CJB	Matthew	23	34	Therefore I am sending you prophets and sages and Torah-teachers — some of them you will kill , indeed , you will have them executed on stakes as criminals ; some you will flog in your synagogues and pursue from town to town .
CJB	Matthew	23	35	And so , on you will fall the guilt for all the innocent blood that has ever been shed on earth , from the blood of innocent Hevel to the blood of Z ’ kharyah Ben-Berekhyah , whom you murdered between the Temple and the altar .
CJB	Matthew	23	36	Yes ! I tell you that all this will fall on this generation !
CJB	Matthew	23	37	“ Yerushalayim ! Yerushalayim ! You kill the prophets ! You stone those who are sent to you ! How often I wanted to gather your children , just as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings , but you refused !
CJB	Matthew	23	38	Look ! God is abandoning your house to you , leaving it desolate . [ b ]
CJB	Matthew	23	39	For I tell you , from now on , you will not see me again until you say , ‘ Blessed is he who comes in the name of Adonai. ’ ” [ c ] Footnotes - Matthew 23:14 Some manuscripts include verse
CJB	Matthew	24	24	For there will appear false Messiahs and false prophets performing great miracles — amazing things ! — so as to fool even the chosen , if possible .
CJB	Matthew	24	2	But he answered them , “ You see all these ? Yes ! I tell you , they will be totally destroyed — not a single stone will be left standing ! ”
CJB	Matthew	24	3	When he was sitting on the Mount of Olives , the talmidim came to him privately . “ Tell us , ” they said , “ when will these things happen ? And what will be the sign that you are coming , and that the ‘ olam hazeh is ending ? ”
CJB	Matthew	24	4	Yeshua replied : “ Watch out ! Don ’ t let anyone fool you !
CJB	Matthew	24	5	For many will come in my name , saying , ‘ I am the Messiah ! ’ and they will lead many astray .
CJB	Matthew	24	6	You will hear the noise of wars nearby and the news of wars far off ; see to it that you don ’ t become frightened . Such things must happen , but the end is yet to come .
CJB	Matthew	24	7	For peoples will fight each other , nations will fight each other , and there will be famines and earthquakes in various parts of the world ;
CJB	Matthew	24	8	all this is but the beginning of the ‘ birth-pains. ’
CJB	Matthew	24	9	At that time you will be arrested and handed over to be punished and put to death , and all peoples will hate you because of me .
CJB	Matthew	24	10	At that time many will be trapped into betraying and hating each other ,
CJB	Matthew	24	11	many false prophets will appear and fool many people ;
CJB	Matthew	24	12	and many people ’ s love will grow cold because of increased distance from Torah .
CJB	Matthew	24	13	But whoever holds out till the end will be delivered .
CJB	Matthew	24	14	And this Good News about the Kingdom will be announced throughout the whole world as a witness to all the Goyim . It is then that the end will come .
CJB	Matthew	24	15	“ So when you see the abomination that causes devastation spoken about through the prophet Dani ’ el standing in the Holy Place ” [ a ] ( let the reader understand the allusion ) ,
CJB	Matthew	24	16	“ that will be the time for those in Y ’ hudah to escape to the hills .
CJB	Matthew	24	17	If someone is on the roof , he must not go down to gather his belongings from his house ;
CJB	Matthew	24	18	if someone is in the field , he must not turn back to get his coat .
CJB	Matthew	24	19	What a terrible time it will be for pregnant women and nursing mothers !
CJB	Matthew	24	20	Pray that you will not have to escape in winter or on Shabbat .
CJB	Matthew	24	21	- Matthew 24:30 Zechariah 12:10–14 - Matthew 24:30 Daniel 7:13–14 - Matthew 24:31 Isaiah 27:13
CJB	Matthew	24	22	Indeed , if the length of this time had not been limited , no one would survive ; but for the sake of those who have been chosen , its length will be limited .
CJB	Matthew	24	23	“ At that time , if someone says to you , ‘ Look ! Here ’ s the Messiah ! ’ or , ‘ There he is ! ’ don ’ t believe him .
CJB	Matthew	24	25	There ! I have told you in advance !
CJB	Matthew	24	26	So if people say to you , ‘ Listen ! He ’ s out in the desert ! ’ don ’ t go ; or , ‘ Look ! He ’ s hidden away in a secret room ! ’ don ’ t believe it .
CJB	Matthew	24	27	For when the Son of Man does come , it will be like lightning that flashes out of the east and fills the sky to the western horizon .
CJB	Matthew	24	28	Wherever there ’ s a dead body , that ’ s where you find the vultures .
CJB	Matthew	24	29	“ But immediately following the trouble of those times , the sun will grow dark , the moon will stop shining , [ c ] the stars will fall from the sky , and the powers in heaven will be shaken . [ d ]
CJB	Matthew	24	30	“ Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky , all the tribes of the Land will mourn , [ e ] and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with tremendous power and glory . [ f ]
CJB	Matthew	24	31	He will send out his angels with a great shofar ; [ g ] and they will gather together his chosen people from the four winds , from one end of heaven to the other .
CJB	Matthew	24	32	“ Now let the fig tree teach you its lesson : when its branches begin to sprout and leaves appear , you know that summer is approaching .
CJB	Matthew	24	33	In the same way , when you see all these things , you are to know that the time is near , right at the door .
CJB	Matthew	24	34	Yes ! I tell you that this people will certainly not pass away before all these things happen .
CJB	Matthew	24	35	Heaven and earth will pass away , but my words will never pass away .
CJB	Matthew	24	36	“ But when that day and hour will come , no one knows — not the angels in heaven , not the Son , only the Father .
CJB	Matthew	24	37	For the Son of Man ’ s coming will be just as it was in the days of Noach .
CJB	Matthew	24	38	Back then , before the Flood , people went on eating and drinking , taking wives and becoming wives , right up till the day Noach entered the ark ;
CJB	Matthew	24	39	and they didn ’ t know what was happening until the Flood came and swept them all away . It will be just like that when the Son of Man comes .
CJB	Matthew	24	40	Then there will be two men in a field — one will be taken and the other left behind .
CJB	Matthew	24	41	There will be two women grinding flour at the mill — one will be taken and the other left behind .
CJB	Matthew	24	42	So stay alert , because you don ’ t know on what day your Lord will come .
CJB	Matthew	24	43	But you do know this : had the owner of the house known when the thief was coming , he would have stayed awake and not allowed his house to be broken into .
CJB	Matthew	24	44	Therefore you too must always be ready , for the Son of Man will come when you are not expecting him .
CJB	Matthew	24	45	“ Who is the faithful and sensible servant whose master puts him in charge of the household staff , to give them their food at the proper time ?
CJB	Matthew	24	46	It will go well with that servant if he is found doing his job when his master comes .
CJB	Matthew	24	47	Yes , I tell you that he will put him in charge of all he owns .
CJB	Matthew	24	48	But if that servant is wicked and says to himself , ‘ My master is taking his time ’ ;
CJB	Matthew	24	49	and he starts beating up his fellow servants and spends his time eating and drinking with drunkards ;
CJB	Matthew	24	50	then his master will come on a day the servant does not expect , at a time he doesn ’ t know ;
CJB	Matthew	24	51	and he will cut him in two and put him with the hypocrites , where people will wail and grind their teeth !

CJB	Matthew	25	25	I was afraid , so I went and hid your talent in the ground . Here ! Take what belongs to you ! ’
CJB	Matthew	25	2	Five of them were foolish and five were sensible .
CJB	Matthew	25	3	The foolish ones took lamps with them but no oil ,
CJB	Matthew	25	4	whereas the others took flasks of oil with their lamps .
CJB	Matthew	25	5	Now the bridegroom was late , so they all went to sleep .
CJB	Matthew	25	6	It was the middle of the night when the cry rang out , ‘ The bridegroom is here ! Go out to meet him ! ’
CJB	Matthew	25	7	The girls all woke up and prepared their lamps for lighting .
CJB	Matthew	25	8	The foolish ones said to the sensible ones , ‘ Give us some of your oil , because our lamps are going out. ’
CJB	Matthew	25	9	‘ No , ’ they replied , ‘ there may not be enough for both you and us . Go to the oil dealers and buy some for yourselves. ’
CJB	Matthew	25	10	But as they were going off to buy , the bridegroom came . Those who were ready went with him to the wedding feast , and the door was shut .
CJB	Matthew	25	11	Later , the other bridesmaids came . ‘ Sir ! Sir ! ’ they cried , ‘ Let us in ! ’
CJB	Matthew	25	12	But he answered , ‘ Indeed ! I tell you , I don ’ t know you ! ’
CJB	Matthew	25	13	So stay alert , because you know neither the day nor the hour .
CJB	Matthew	25	14	“ For it will be like a man about to leave home for awhile , who entrusted his possessions to his servants .
CJB	Matthew	25	15	To one he gave five talents [ equivalent to a hundred years ’ wages ] ; to another , two talents ; and to another , one talent — to each according to his ability . Then he left .
CJB	Matthew	25	16	The one who had received five talents immediately went out , invested it and earned another five .
CJB	Matthew	25	17	Similarly , the one given two earned another two .
CJB	Matthew	25	18	But the one given one talent went off , dug a hole in the ground and hid his master ’ s money .
CJB	Matthew	25	19	“ After a long time , the master of those servants returned to settle accounts with them .
CJB	Matthew	25	20	The one who had received five talents came forward bringing the other five and said , ‘ Sir , you gave me five talents ; here , I have made five more. ’
CJB	Matthew	25	21	His master said to him , ‘ Excellent ! You are a good and trustworthy servant . You have been faithful with a small amount , so I will put you in charge of a large amount . Come and join in your master ’ s happiness ! ’
CJB	Matthew	25	22	Also the one who had received two came forward and said , ‘ Sir , you gave me two talents ; here , I have made two more. ’
CJB	Matthew	25	23	His master said to him , ‘ Excellent ! you are a good and trustworthy servant . You have been faithful with a small amount , so I will put you in charge of a large amount . Come and join in your master ’ s happiness ! ’
CJB	Matthew	25	24	“ Now the one who had received one talent came forward and said , ‘ I knew you were a hard man . You harvest where you didn ’ t plant and gather where you didn ’ t sow seed .
CJB	Matthew	25	26	‘ You wicked , lazy servant ! ’ said his master , ‘ So you knew , did you , that I harvest where I haven ’ t planted ? and that I gather where I didn ’ t sow seed ?
CJB	Matthew	25	27	Then you should have deposited my money with the bankers , so that when I returned , I would at least have gotten back interest with my capital !
CJB	Matthew	25	28	Take the talent from him and give it to the one who has ten .
CJB	Matthew	25	29	For everyone who has something will be given more , so that he will have more than enough ; but from anyone who has nothing , even what he does have will be taken away .
CJB	Matthew	25	30	As for this worthless servant , throw him out in the dark , where people will wail and grind their teeth ! ’
CJB	Matthew	25	31	“ When the Son of Man comes in his glory , accompanied by all the angels , he will sit on his glorious throne .
CJB	Matthew	25	32	All the nations will be assembled before him , and he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates sheep from goats .
CJB	Matthew	25	33	The ‘ sheep ’ he will place at his right hand and the ‘ goats ’ at his left .
CJB	Matthew	25	34	“ Then the King will say to those on his right , ‘ Come , you whom my Father has blessed , take your inheritance , the Kingdom prepared for you from the founding of the world .
CJB	Matthew	25	35	For I was hungry and you gave me food , I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink , I was a stranger and you made me your guest ,
CJB	Matthew	25	36	I needed clothes and you provided them , I was sick and you took care of me , I was in prison and you visited me. ’
CJB	Matthew	25	37	Then the people who have done what God wants will reply , ‘ Lord , when did we see you hungry and feed you , or thirsty and give you something to drink ?
CJB	Matthew	25	38	When did we see you a stranger and make you our guest , or needing clothes and provide them ?
CJB	Matthew	25	39	When did we see you sick or in prison , and visit you ? ’
CJB	Matthew	25	40	The King will say to them , ‘ Yes ! I tell you that whenever you did these things for one of the least important of these brothers of mine , you did them for me ! ’
CJB	Matthew	25	41	“ Then he will also speak to those on his left , saying , ‘ Get away from me , you who are cursed ! Go off into the fire prepared for the Adversary and his angels !
CJB	Matthew	25	42	For I was hungry and you gave me no food , thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink ,
CJB	Matthew	25	43	a stranger and you did not welcome me , needing clothes and you did not give them to me , sick and in prison and you did not visit me. ’
CJB	Matthew	25	44	Then they too will reply , ‘ Lord , when did we see you hungry , thirsty , a stranger , needing clothes , sick or in prison , and not take care of you ? ’
CJB	Matthew	25	45	And he will answer them , ‘ Yes ! I tell you that whenever you refused to do it for the least important of these people , you refused to do it for me ! ’
CJB	Matthew	25	46	They will go off to eternal punishment , but those who have done what God wants will go to eternal life . ”
CJB	Matthew	26	26	While they were eating , Yeshua took a piece of matzah , made the b ’ rakhah , broke it , gave it to the talmidim and said , “ Take ! Eat ! This is my body ! ”
CJB	Matthew	26	2	“ As you know , Pesach is two days away , and the Son of Man will be handed over to be nailed to the execution-stake. ”
CJB	Matthew	26	3	Then the head cohanim and the elders of the people gathered in the palace of Kayafa the cohen hagadol .
CJB	Matthew	26	4	They made plans to arrest Yeshua surreptitiously and have him put to death ;
CJB	Matthew	26	5	but they said , “ Not during the festival , or the people will riot. ”
CJB	Matthew	26	6	Yeshua was in Beit-Anyah , at the home of Shim ‘ on , the man who had had tzara ’ at .
CJB	Matthew	26	7	A woman who had an alabaster jar filled with very expensive perfume approached Yeshua while he was eating and began pouring it on his head .
CJB	Matthew	26	8	When the talmidim saw it , they became very angry . “ Why this waste ? ” they asked .
CJB	Matthew	26	9	“ This could have been sold for a lot of money and given to the poor. ”
CJB	Matthew	26	10	But Yeshua , aware of what was going on , said to them , “ Why are you bothering this woman ? She has done a beautiful thing for me .
CJB	Matthew	26	11	The poor you will always have with you , but you will not always have me .
CJB	Matthew	26	12	She poured this perfume on me to prepare my body for burial .
CJB	Matthew	26	13	Yes ! I tell you that throughout the whole world , wherever this Good News is proclaimed , what she has done will be told in her memory. ”
CJB	Matthew	26	14	Then one of the Twelve , the one called Y ’ hudah from K ’ riot , went to the head cohanim
CJB	Matthew	26	15	and said , “ What are you willing to give me if I turn Yeshua over to you ? ” They counted out thirty silver coins and gave them to Y ’ hudah . [ a ]
CJB	Matthew	26	16	From then on he looked for a good opportunity to betray him .
CJB	Matthew	26	17	On the first day for matzah , the talmidim came to Yeshua and asked , “ Where do you want us to prepare your Seder ? ”
CJB	Matthew	26	18	“ Go into the city , to so-and-so , ” he replied , “ and tell him that the Rabbi says , ‘ My time is near , my talmidim and I are celebrating Pesach at your house. ’ ”
CJB	Matthew	26	19	The talmidim did as Yeshua directed and prepared the Seder .
CJB	Matthew	26	20	When evening came , Yeshua reclined with the twelve talmidim ;
CJB	Matthew	26	21	and as they were eating , he said , “ Yes , I tell you that one of you is going to betray me. ”
CJB	Matthew	26	22	They became terribly upset and began asking him , one after the other , “ Lord , you don ’ t mean me , do you ? ”
CJB	Matthew	26	23	He answered , “ The one who dips his matzah in the dish with me is the one who will betray me .
CJB	Matthew	26	24	The Son of Man will die just as the Tanakh says he will ; but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed ! It would have been better for him had he never been born ! ”
CJB	Matthew	26	25	Y ’ hudah , the one who was betraying him , then asked , “ Surely , Rabbi , you don ’ t mean me ? ” He answered , “ The words are yours. ”
CJB	Matthew	26	27	Also he took a cup of wine , made the b ’ rakhah , and gave it to them , saying , “ All of you , drink from it !
CJB	Matthew	26	28	For this is my blood , which ratifies the New Covenant , my blood shed on behalf of many , so that they may have their sins forgiven .
CJB	Matthew	26	29	I tell you , I will not drink this ‘ fruit of the vine ’ again until the day I drink new wine with you in my Father ’ s Kingdom. ”
CJB	Matthew	26	30	After singing the Hallel , they went out to the Mount of Olives .
CJB	Matthew	26	31	Yeshua then said to them , “ Tonight you will all lose faith in me , as the Tanakh says , ‘ I will strike the shepherd dead , and the sheep of the flock will be scattered. ’ [ b ]
CJB	Matthew	26	32	But after I have been raised , I will go ahead of you into the Galil. ”
CJB	Matthew	26	33	“ I will never lose faith in you , ” Kefa answered , “ even if everyone else does. ”
CJB	Matthew	26	34	Yeshua said to him , “ Yes ! I tell you that tonight before the rooster crows , you will disown me three times ! ”
CJB	Matthew	26	35	“ Even if I must die with you , ” Kefa replied , “ I will never disown you ! ” And all the talmidim said the same thing .
CJB	Matthew	26	36	Then Yeshua went with his talmidim to a place called Gat-Sh ’ manim and said to them , “ Sit here while I go over there and pray. ”
CJB	Matthew	26	37	He took with him Kefa and Zavdai ’ s two sons . Grief and anguish came over him ,
CJB	Matthew	26	38	and he said to them , “ My heart is so filled with sadness that I could die ! Remain here and stay awake with me. ”
CJB	Matthew	26	39	Going on a little farther , he fell on his face , praying , “ My Father , if possible , let this cup pass from me ! Yet — not what I want , but what you want ! ”
CJB	Matthew	26	40	He returned to the talmidim and found them sleeping . He said to Kefa , “ Were you so weak that you couldn ’ t stay awake with me for even an hour ?
CJB	Matthew	26	41	Stay awake , and pray that you will not be put to the test — the spirit indeed is eager , but human nature is weak. ”
CJB	Matthew	26	42	A second time he went off and prayed . “ My Father , if this cup can not pass away unless I drink it , let what you want be done. ”
CJB	Matthew	26	43	Again he returned and found them sleeping , their eyes were so heavy .
CJB	Matthew	26	44	Leaving them again , he went off and prayed a third time , saying the same words .
CJB	Matthew	26	45	Then he came to the talmidim and said , “ For now , go on sleeping , take your rest . . . . Look ! The time has come for the Son of Man to be betrayed into the hands of sinners .
CJB	Matthew	26	46	Get up ! Let ’ s go ! Here comes my betrayer ! ”
CJB	Matthew	26	47	While Yeshua was still speaking , Y ’ hudah ( one of the Twelve ! ) came , and with him a large crowd carrying swords and clubs , from the head cohanim and elders of the people .
CJB	Matthew	26	48	The betrayer had arranged to give them a signal : “ The man I kiss is the one you want — grab him ! ”
CJB	Matthew	26	49	He went straight up to Yeshua , said , “ Shalom , Rabbi ! ” and kissed him .
CJB	Matthew	26	50	Yeshua said to him , “ Friend , do what you came to do. ” Then they moved forward , laid hold of Yeshua and arrested him .
CJB	Matthew	26	51	At that , one of the men with Yeshua reached for his sword , drew it out and struck at the servant of the cohen hagadol , cutting off his ear .
CJB	Matthew	26	52	Yeshua said to him , “ Put your sword back where it belongs , for everyone who uses the sword will die by the sword .
CJB	Matthew	26	53	Don ’ t you know that I can ask my Father , and he will instantly provide more than a dozen armies of angels to help me ?
CJB	Matthew	26	54	But if I did that , how could the passages in the Tanakh be fulfilled that say it has to happen this way ? ”
CJB	Matthew	26	55	Then Yeshua addressed the crowd : “ So you came out to take me with swords and clubs , the way you would the leader of a rebellion ? Every day I sat in the Temple court , teaching ; and you didn ’ t seize me then .
CJB	Matthew	26	56	But all this has happened so that what the prophets wrote may be fulfilled. ” Then the talmidim all deserted him and ran away .
CJB	Matthew	26	57	Those who had seized Yeshua led him off to Kayafa the cohen hagadol , where the Torah-teachers and elders were assembled .
CJB	Matthew	26	58	Kefa followed him at a distance as far as the courtyard of the cohen hagadol ; then he went inside and sat down with the guards to see what the outcome would be .
CJB	Matthew	26	59	The head cohanim and the whole Sanhedrin looked for some false evidence against Yeshua , so that they might put him to death .
CJB	Matthew	26	60	But they didn ’ t find any , even though many liars came forward to give testimony . At last , however , two people came forward and said ,
CJB	Matthew	26	61	“ This man said , ‘ I can tear down God ’ s Temple and build it again in three days. ’ ”
CJB	Matthew	26	62	The cohen hagadol stood up and said , “ Have you nothing to say to the accusation these men are making ? ”
CJB	Matthew	26	63	Yeshua remained silent . The cohen hagadol said to him , “ I put you under oath ! By the living God , tell us if you are the Mashiach , the Son of God ! ”
CJB	Matthew	26	64	Yeshua said to him , “ The words are your own . But I tell you that one day you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of HaG ’ vurah and coming on the clouds of heaven. ” [ c ]
CJB	Matthew	26	65	At this , the cohen hagadol tore his robes . “ Blasphemy ! ” he said . “ Why do we still need witnesses ? You heard him blaspheme !
CJB	Matthew	26	66	What is your verdict ? ” “ Guilty , ” they answered . “ He deserves death ! ”
CJB	Matthew	26	67	Then they spit in his face and pounded him with their fists ; and those who were beating him
CJB	Matthew	26	68	said , “ Now , you ‘ Messiah , ’ ‘ prophesy ’ to us : who hit you that time ? ”
CJB	Matthew	26	69	Kefa was sitting outside in the courtyard when a servant girl came up to him . “ You too were with Yeshua from the Galil , ” she said .
CJB	Matthew	26	70	But he denied it in front of everyone — “ I don ’ t know what you ’ re talking about ! ”
CJB	Matthew	26	71	He went out onto the porch , and another girl saw him and said to the people there , “ This man was with Yeshua of Natzeret. ”
CJB	Matthew	26	72	Again he denied it , swearing , “ I don ’ t know the man ! ”
CJB	Matthew	26	73	After a little while , the bystanders approached Kefa and said , “ You must be one of them — your accent gives you away. ”
CJB	Matthew	26	74	This time he began to invoke a curse on himself as he swore , “ I do not know the man ! ” — and immediately a rooster crowed .
CJB	Matthew	26	75	Kefa remembered what Yeshua had said , “ Before the rooster crows , you will disown me three times ” ; and he went outside and cried bitterly . Footnotes - Matthew 26:15 Zechariah 11:12 - Matthew 26:31 Zechariah 13:7 - Matthew 26:64 Daniel 7:13 ; Psalm 110:1
CJB	Matthew	27	27	The governor ’ s soldiers took Yeshua into the headquarters building , and the whole battalion gathered around him .
CJB	Matthew	27	2	Then they put him in chains , led him away and handed him over to Pilate the governor .
CJB	Matthew	27	3	When Y ’ hudah , who had betrayed him , saw that Yeshua had been condemned , he was seized with remorse and returned the thirty silver coins to the head cohanim and elders ,
CJB	Matthew	27	4	saying , “ I sinned in betraying an innocent man to death. ” “ What is that to us ? ” they answered . “ That ’ s your problem. ”
CJB	Matthew	27	5	Hurling the pieces of silver into the sanctuary , he left ; then he went off and hanged himself .
CJB	Matthew	27	6	The head cohanim took the silver coins and said , “ It is prohibited to put this into the Temple treasury , because it is blood money. ”

CJB	Matthew	27	10	and used them to buy the potter ’ s field , just as the Lord directed me. ” [ a ]
CJB	Matthew	27	11	Meanwhile , Yeshua was brought before the governor , and the governor put this question to him : “ Are you the King of the Jews ? ” Yeshua answered , “ The words are yours. ”
CJB	Matthew	27	12	But when he was accused by the head cohanim and elders , he gave no answer .
CJB	Matthew	27	13	Then Pilate said to him , “ Don ’ t you hear all these charges they are making against you ? ”
CJB	Matthew	27	14	But to the governor ’ s great amazement , he did not say a single word in reply to the accusations .
CJB	Matthew	27	15	It was the governor ’ s custom during a festival to set free one prisoner , whomever the crowd asked for .
CJB	Matthew	27	16	There was at that time a notorious prisoner being held , named Yeshua Bar-Abba .
CJB	Matthew	27	17	So when a crowd had gathered , Pilate said to them , “ Whom do you want me to set free for you ? Bar-Abba ? or Yeshua , called ‘ the Messiah ’ ? ”
CJB	Matthew	27	18	For he understood that it was out of jealousy that they had handed him over .
CJB	Matthew	27	19	While he was sitting in court , his wife sent him a message , “ Leave that innocent man alone . Today in a dream I suffered terribly because of him. ”
CJB	Matthew	27	20	But the head cohanim persuaded the crowd to ask for Bar-Abba ’ s release and to have Yeshua executed on the stake .
CJB	Matthew	27	21	)
CJB	Matthew	27	22	Pilate said to them , “ Then what should I do with Yeshua , called ‘ the Messiah ’ ? ” They all said , “ Put him to death on the stake ! Put him to death on the stake ! ”
CJB	Matthew	27	23	When he asked , “ Why ? What crime has he committed ? ” they shouted all the louder , “ Put him to death on the stake ! ”
CJB	Matthew	27	24	When Pilate saw that he was accomplishing nothing , but rather that a riot was starting , he took water , washed his hands in front of the crowd , and said , “ My hands are clean of this man ’ s blood ; it ’ s your responsibility. ”
CJB	Matthew	27	25	All the people answered , “ His blood is on us and on our children ! ”
CJB	Matthew	27	26	Then he released to them Bar-Abba ; but Yeshua , after having him whipped , he handed over to be executed on a stake .
CJB	Matthew	27	28	They stripped off his clothes and put on him a scarlet robe ,
CJB	Matthew	27	29	wove thorn-branches into a crown and put it on his head , and put a stick in his right hand . Then they kneeled down in front of him and made fun of him : “ Hail to the King of the Jews ! ”
CJB	Matthew	27	30	They spit on him and used the stick to beat him about the head .
CJB	Matthew	27	31	When they had finished ridiculing him , they took off the robe , put his own clothes back on him and led him away to be nailed to the execution-stake .
CJB	Matthew	27	32	As they were leaving , they met a man from Cyrene named Shim ‘ on ; and they forced him to carry Yeshua ’ s execution-stake .
CJB	Matthew	27	33	When they arrived at a place called Gulgolta ( which means “ place of a skull ” ) ,
CJB	Matthew	27	34	they gave him wine mixed with bitter gall to drink ; but after tasting it , he would not drink it .
CJB	Matthew	27	35	After they had nailed him to the stake , they divided his clothes among them by throwing dice .
CJB	Matthew	27	36	Then they sat down to keep watch over him there .
CJB	Matthew	27	37	Above his head they placed the written notice stating the charge against him , THIS IS YESHUA THE KING OF THE JEWS
CJB	Matthew	27	38	Then two robbers were placed on execution-stakes with him , one on the right and one on the left .
CJB	Matthew	27	39	People passing by hurled insults at him , shaking their heads [ b ]
CJB	Matthew	27	40	and saying , “ So you can destroy the Temple , can you , and rebuild it in three days ? Save yourself , if you are the Son of God , and come down from the stake ! ”
CJB	Matthew	27	41	Likewise , the head cohanim jeered at him , along with the Torah-teachers and elders ,
CJB	Matthew	27	42	“ He saved others , but he can ’ t save himself ! ” “ So he ’ s King of Isra ’ el , is he ? Let him come down now from the stake ! Then we ’ ll believe him ! ”
CJB	Matthew	27	43	“ He trusted God ? So , let him rescue him if he wants him ! [ c ] After all , he did say , ‘ I ’ m the Son of God ’ ! ”
CJB	Matthew	27	44	Even the robbers nailed up with him insulted him in the same way .
CJB	Matthew	27	45	From noon until three o ’ clock in the afternoon , all the Land was covered with darkness .
CJB	Matthew	27	46	At about three , Yeshua uttered a loud cry , “ Eli ! Eli ! L ’ mah sh ’ vaktani ? ( My God ! My God ! Why have you deserted me ? ) ” [ d ]
CJB	Matthew	27	47	On hearing this , some of the bystanders said , “ He ’ s calling for Eliyahu. ”
CJB	Matthew	27	48	Immediately one of them ran and took a sponge , soaked it in vinegar , put it on a stick and gave it to him to drink . [ e ]
CJB	Matthew	27	49	The rest said , “ Wait ! Let ’ s see if Eliyahu comes and rescues him. ”
CJB	Matthew	27	50	But Yeshua , again crying out in a loud voice , yielded up his spirit .
CJB	Matthew	27	51	At that moment the parokhet in the Temple was ripped in two from top to bottom ; and there was an earthquake , with rocks splitting apart .
CJB	Matthew	27	52	Also the graves were opened , and the bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life ;
CJB	Matthew	27	53	and after Yeshua rose , they came out of the graves and went into the holy city , where many people saw them .
CJB	Matthew	27	54	When the Roman officer and those with him who were keeping watch over Yeshua saw the earthquake and what was happening , they were awestruck and said , “ He really was a son of God. ”
CJB	Matthew	27	55	There were many women there , looking on from a distance ; they had followed Yeshua from the Galil , helping him .
CJB	Matthew	27	56	Among them were Miryam from Magdala , Miryam the mother of Ya ‘ akov and Yosef , and the mother of Zavdai ’ s sons .
CJB	Matthew	27	57	Towards evening , there came a wealthy man from Ramatayim named Yosef , who was himself a talmid of Yeshua .
CJB	Matthew	27	58	He approached Pilate and asked for Yeshua ’ s body , and Pilate ordered it to be given to him .
CJB	Matthew	27	59	Yosef took the body , wrapped it in a clean linen sheet ,
CJB	Matthew	27	60	and laid it in his own tomb , which he had recently had cut out of the rock . After rolling a large stone in front of the entrance to the tomb , he went away .
CJB	Matthew	27	61	Miryam of Magdala and the other Miryam stayed there , sitting opposite the grave .
CJB	Matthew	27	62	Next day , after the preparation , the head cohanim and the P ’ rushim went together to Pilate
CJB	Matthew	27	63	and said , “ Sir , we remember that that deceiver said while he was still alive , ‘ After three days I will be raised. ’
CJB	Matthew	27	64	Therefore , order that the grave be made secure till the third day ; otherwise the talmidim may come , steal him away and say to the people , ‘ He was raised from the dead ’ ; and the last deception will be worse than the first. ”
CJB	Matthew	27	65	Pilate said to them , “ You may have your guard . Go and make the grave as secure as you know how. ”
CJB	Matthew	27	66	So they went and made the grave secure by sealing the stone and putting the guard on watch . Footnotes - Matthew 27:10 Zechariah 11:12–13 , where Hebrew yotzer means “ treasury ” ; here it means “ potter ” ( see v.
CJB	Matthew	27	1	) - Matthew 27:48 Psalm 69:22 (
CJB	Matthew	28	28	After Shabbat , as the next day was dawning , Miryam of Magdala and the other Miryam went to see the grave .
CJB	Matthew	28	2	Suddenly there was a violent earthquake , for an angel of Adonai came down from heaven , rolled away the stone and sat on it .
CJB	Matthew	28	3	His appearance was like lightning , and his clothes were as white as snow .
CJB	Matthew	28	4	The guards were so terrified at him that they trembled and became like dead men .
CJB	Matthew	28	5	But the angel said to the women , “ Don ’ t be afraid . I know you are looking for Yeshua , who was executed on the stake .
CJB	Matthew	28	6	He is not here , because he has been raised — just as he said ! Come and look at the place where he lay .
CJB	Matthew	28	7	Then go quickly and tell the talmidim , ‘ He has been raised from the dead , and now he is going to the Galil ahead of you . You will see him there. ’ Now I have told you. ”
CJB	Matthew	28	8	So they left the tomb quickly , frightened yet filled with joy ; and they ran to give the news to his talmidim .
CJB	Matthew	28	9	Suddenly Yeshua met them and said , “ Shalom ! ” They came up and took hold of his feet as they fell down in front of him .
CJB	Matthew	28	10	Then Yeshua said to them , “ Don ’ t be afraid ! Go and tell my brothers to go to the Galil , and they will see me there. ”
CJB	Matthew	28	11	As they were going , some of the guards went into the city and reported to the head cohanim everything that had happened .
CJB	Matthew	28	12	Then they met with the elders ; and after discussing the matter , they gave the soldiers a sizeable sum of money
CJB	Matthew	28	13	and said to them , “ Tell people , ‘ His talmidim came during the night and stole his body while we were sleeping. ’
CJB	Matthew	28	14	If the governor hears of it , we will put things right with him and keep you from getting in trouble. ”
CJB	Matthew	28	15	The soldiers took the money and did as they were told , and this story has been spread about by Judeans till this very day .
CJB	Matthew	28	16	So the eleven talmidim went to the hill in the Galil where Yeshua had told them to go .
CJB	Matthew	28	17	When they saw him , they prostrated themselves before him ; but some hesitated .
CJB	Matthew	28	18	Yeshua came and talked with them . He said , “ All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me .
CJB	Matthew	28	19	Therefore , go and make people from all nations into talmidim , immersing them into the reality of the Father , the Son and the Ruach HaKodesh ,
CJB	Matthew	28	20	and teaching them to obey everything that I have commanded you . And remember ! I will be with you always , yes , even until the end of the age . ”
CJB	Mark	1	1	The beginning of the Good News of Yeshua the Messiah , the Son of God :
CJB	Mark	1	2	It is written in the prophet Yesha ‘ yahu , “ See , I am sending my messenger ahead of you ; he will prepare the way before you. ” [ a ]
CJB	Mark	1	3	“ The voice of someone crying out : ‘ In the desert prepare the way for Adonai ! Make straight paths for him ! ’ ” [ b ]
CJB	Mark	1	4	So it was that Yochanan the Immerser appeared in the desert , proclaiming an immersion involving turning to God from sin in order to be forgiven .
CJB	Mark	1	5	People went out to him from all over Y ’ hudah , as did all the inhabitants of Yerushalayim . Confessing their sins , they were immersed by him in the Yarden River .
CJB	Mark	1	6	Yochanan wore clothes of camel ’ s hair , with a leather belt around his waist ; he ate locusts and wild honey .
CJB	Mark	1	7	He proclaimed : “ After me is coming someone who is more powerful than I — I ’ m not worthy even to bend down and untie his sandals .
CJB	Mark	1	8	I have immersed you in water , but he will immerse you in the Ruach HaKodesh. ”
CJB	Mark	1	9	Shortly thereafter , Yeshua came from Natzeret in the Galil and was immersed in the Yarden by Yochanan .
CJB	Mark	1	10	Immediately upon coming up out of the water , he saw heaven torn open and the Spirit descending upon him like a dove ;
CJB	Mark	1	11	then a voice came from heaven , “ You are my Son , whom I love ; I am well pleased with you. ”
CJB	Mark	1	12	Immediately the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness ,
CJB	Mark	1	13	and he was in the wilderness forty days being tempted by the Adversary . He was with the wild animals , and the angels took care of him .
CJB	Mark	1	14	After Yochanan had been arrested , Yeshua came into the Galil proclaiming the Good News from God :
CJB	Mark	1	15	“ The time has come , God ’ s Kingdom is near ! Turn to God from your sins and believe the Good News ! ”
CJB	Mark	1	16	As he walked beside Lake Kinneret , he saw Shim ‘ on and Andrew , Shim ‘ on ’ s brother , casting a net into the lake ; for they were fishermen .
CJB	Mark	1	17	Yeshua said to them , “ Come , follow me , and I will make you into fishers for men ! ”
CJB	Mark	1	18	At once they left their nets and followed him .
CJB	Mark	1	19	Going on a little farther , he saw Ya ‘ akov Ben-Zavdai and Yochanan , his brother , in their boat , repairing their nets .
CJB	Mark	1	20	Immediately he called them , and they left their father Zavdai in the boat with the hired men and went after Yeshua .
CJB	Mark	1	21	They entered K ’ far-Nachum , and on Shabbat Yeshua went into the synagogue and began teaching .
CJB	Mark	1	22	They were amazed at the way he taught , for he did not instruct them like the Torah-teachers but as one who had authority himself .
CJB	Mark	1	23	In their synagogue just then was a man with an unclean spirit in him , who shouted ,
CJB	Mark	1	24	“ What do you want with us , Yeshua from Natzeret ? Have you come to destroy us ? I know who you are — the Holy One of God ! ”
CJB	Mark	1	25	But Yeshua rebuked the unclean spirit , “ Be quiet and come out of him ! ”
CJB	Mark	1	26	Throwing the man into a convulsion , it gave a loud shriek and came out of him .
CJB	Mark	1	27	They were all so astounded that they began asking each other , “ What is this ? A new teaching , one with authority behind it ! He gives orders even to the unclean spirits , and they obey him ! ”
CJB	Mark	1	28	And the news about him spread quickly through the whole region of the Galil .
CJB	Mark	1	29	They left the synagogue and went with Ya ‘ akov and Yochanan to the home of Shim ‘ on and Andrew .
CJB	Mark	1	30	Shim ‘ on ’ s mother-in-law was lying sick with a fever , and they told Yeshua about her .
CJB	Mark	1	31	He came , took her by the hand and lifted her onto her feet . The fever left her , and she began helping them .
CJB	Mark	1	32	That evening after sundown , they brought to Yeshua all who were ill or held in the power of demons ,
CJB	Mark	1	33	and the whole town came crowding around the door .
CJB	Mark	1	34	He healed many who were ill with various diseases and expelled many demons , but he did not allow the demons to speak , because they knew who he was .
CJB	Mark	1	35	Very early in the morning , while it was still dark , Yeshua got up , left , went away to a lonely spot and stayed there praying .
CJB	Mark	1	36	But Shim ‘ on and those with him went after him ;
CJB	Mark	1	37	and when they found him , they said , “ Everybody is looking for you. ”
CJB	Mark	1	38	He answered , “ Let ’ s go somewhere else — to the other villages around here . I have to proclaim the message there too — in fact this is why I came out. ”
CJB	Mark	1	39	So he traveled all through the Galil , preaching in their synagogues and expelling demons .
CJB	Mark	1	40	A man afflicted with tzara ‘ at came to Yeshua and begged him on his knees , “ If you are willing , you can make me clean. ”
CJB	Mark	1	41	Moved with pity , Yeshua reached out his hand , touched him and said to him , “ I am willing ! Be cleansed ! ”
CJB	Mark	1	42	Instantly the tzara ‘ at left him , and he was cleansed .
CJB	Mark	1	43	Yeshua sent him away with this stern warning :
CJB	Mark	1	44	“ See to it that you tell no one ; instead , as a testimony to the people , go and let the cohen examine you , and offer for your cleansing what Moshe commanded. ”
CJB	Mark	1	45	But he went out and began spreading the news , talking freely about it ; so that Yeshua could no longer enter a town openly but stayed out in the country , where people continued coming to him from all around .
CJB	Mark	2	2	and so many people gathered around the house that there was no longer any room , not even in front of the door . While he was preaching the message to them ,
CJB	Mark	2	3	four men came to him carrying a paralyzed man .
CJB	Mark	2	4	They could not get near Yeshua because of the crowd , so they stripped the roof over the place where he was , made an opening , and lowered the stretcher with the paralytic lying on it .
CJB	Mark	2	5	Seeing their trust , Yeshua said to the paralyzed man , “ Son , your sins are forgiven. ”
CJB	Mark	2	6	Some Torah-teachers sitting there thought to themselves ,
CJB	Mark	2	7	“ How can this fellow say such a thing ? He is blaspheming ! Who can forgive sins except God ? ”
CJB	Mark	2	8	But immediately Yeshua , perceiving in his spirit what they were thinking , said to them , “ Why are you thinking these things ?
CJB	Mark	2	9	Which is easier to say to the paralyzed man ? ‘ Your sins are forgiven ’ ? or ‘ Get up , pick up your stretcher and walk ’ ?
CJB	Mark	2	10	But look ! I will prove to you that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins. ” He then said to the paralytic ,
CJB	Mark	2	11	“ I say to you : get up , pick up your stretcher and go home ! ”
CJB	Mark	2	12	In front of everyone the man got up , picked up his stretcher at once and left . They were all utterly amazed and praised God , saying , “ We have never seen anything like this ! ”
CJB	Mark	2	13	Yeshua went out again by the lake . All the crowd came to him , and he began teaching them .
CJB	Mark	2	14	As he passed on from there , he saw Levi Ben-Halfai sitting in his tax-collection booth and said to him , “ Follow me ! ” And he got up and followed him .
CJB	Mark	2	15	As Yeshua was in Levi ’ s house eating , many tax-collectors and sinners were sitting with Yeshua and his talmidim , for there were many of them among his followers .
CJB	Mark	2	16	When the Torah-teachers and the P ’ rushim saw that he was eating with sinners and tax-collectors , they said to his talmidim , “ Why does he eat with tax-collectors and sinners ? ”
CJB	Mark	2	17	But , hearing the question , Yeshua answered them , “ The ones who need a doctor aren ’ t the healthy but the sick . I didn ’ t come to call the ‘ righteous ’ but sinners ! ”
CJB	Mark	2	18	Also Yochanan ’ s talmidim and the P ’ rushim were fasting ; and they came and asked Yeshua , “ Why is it that Yochanan ’ s talmidim and the talmidim of the P ’ rushim fast , but your talmidim don ’ t fast ? ”
CJB	Mark	2	19	Yeshua answered them , “ Can wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is still with them ? As long as they have the bridegroom with them , fasting is out of the question .
CJB	Mark	2	20	But the time will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them ; and when that day comes , they will fast .
CJB	Mark	2	21	No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old coat ; if he does , the new patch tears away from the old cloth and leaves a worse hole .
CJB	Mark	2	22	And no one puts new wine in old wineskins ; if he does , the wine will burst the skins , and both the wine and the skins will be ruined . Rather , new wine is for freshly prepared wineskins. ”
CJB	Mark	2	23	One Shabbat Yeshua was passing through some wheat fields ; and as they went along , his talmidim began picking heads of grain .
CJB	Mark	2	24	The P ’ rushim said to him , “ Look ! Why are they violating Shabbat ? ”
CJB	Mark	2	25	He said to them , “ Haven ’ t you ever read what David did when he and those with him were hungry and needed food ?
CJB	Mark	2	26	He entered the House of God when Evyatar was cohen gadol and ate the Bread of the Presence , ” — which is forbidden for anyone to eat but the cohanim — “ and even gave some to his companions. ”
CJB	Mark	2	27	Then he said to them , “ Shabbat was made for mankind , not mankind for Shabbat ;
CJB	Mark	2	28	So the Son of Man is Lord even of Shabbat . ”
CJB	Mark	3	3	He said to the man with the shriveled hand , “ Come up where we can see you ! ”
CJB	Mark	3	2	Looking for a reason to accuse him of something , people watched him carefully to see if he would heal him on Shabbat .
CJB	Mark	3	4	Then to them he said , “ What is permitted on Shabbat ? Doing good or doing evil ? Saving life or killing ? ” But they said nothing .
CJB	Mark	3	5	Then , looking them over and feeling both anger with them and sympathy for them at the stoniness of their hearts , he said to the man , “ Hold out your hand. ” As he held it out , it became restored .
CJB	Mark	3	6	The P ’ rushim went out and immediately began plotting with some members of Herod ’ s party how to do away with him .
CJB	Mark	3	7	Yeshua went off with his talmidim to the lake , and great numbers followed him from the Galil .
CJB	Mark	3	8	When they heard what he was doing , great numbers also followed him from Y ’ hudah , Yerushalayim , Idumea , the territory beyond the Yarden , and the Tzor-Tzidon area .
CJB	Mark	3	9	He told his talmidim to have a boat ready for him , so that he could escape the crush of the crowd if necessary ,
CJB	Mark	3	10	for he had healed many people , and all the sick kept pressing forward to touch him .
CJB	Mark	3	11	Whenever the unclean spirits saw him , they would fall down in front of him and scream , “ You are the Son of God ! ”
CJB	Mark	3	12	But he warned them strictly not to make him known .
CJB	Mark	3	13	Then he went up into the hill country and summoned to himself those he wanted , and they came to him .
CJB	Mark	3	14	He appointed twelve to be with him , to be sent out to preach
CJB	Mark	3	15	and to have authority to expel demons :
CJB	Mark	3	16	Shim ‘ on , to whom he gave another name , “ Kefa ” ;
CJB	Mark	3	17	Ya ‘ akov Ben-Zavdai and Yochanan , Ya ‘ akov ’ s brother — to them he gave the name “ B ’ nei-Regesh ” ( that is , “ Thunderers ” ) ;
CJB	Mark	3	18	Andrew , Philip , Bar-Talmai , Mattityahu , T ’ oma , Ya ‘ akov Ben-Halfai , Taddai , Shim ‘ on the Zealot ,
CJB	Mark	3	19	and Y ’ hudah from K ’ riot , the one who betrayed him . Then he entered a house ;
CJB	Mark	3	20	and once more , such a crowd came together that they couldn ’ t even eat .
CJB	Mark	3	21	When his family heard about this , they set out to take charge of him ; for they said , “ He ’ s out of his mind ! ”
CJB	Mark	3	22	The Torah-teachers who came down from Yerushalayim said , “ He has Ba ‘ al-Zibbul in him , ” and “ It is by the ruler of the demons that he expels the demons. ”
CJB	Mark	3	23	But he called them and spoke to them in parables : “ How can Satan expel Satan ?
CJB	Mark	3	24	If a kingdom is divided against itself , that kingdom can ’ t survive ;
CJB	Mark	3	25	and if a household is divided against itself , that household can ’ t survive .
CJB	Mark	3	26	So if Satan has rebelled against himself and is divided , he can ’ t survive either ; and that ’ s the end of him .
CJB	Mark	3	27	Furthermore , no one can break into a strong man ’ s house and make off with his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man . After that , he can ransack his house .
CJB	Mark	3	28	Yes ! I tell you that people will be forgiven all sins and whatever blasphemies they utter ;
CJB	Mark	3	29	however , someone who blasphemes against the Ruach HaKodesh never has forgiveness but is guilty of an eternal sin. ”
CJB	Mark	3	30	For they had been saying , “ He has an unclean spirit in him. ”
CJB	Mark	3	31	Then his mother and brothers arrived . Standing outside , they sent a message asking for him .
CJB	Mark	3	32	A crowd was sitting around him ; and they said to him , “ Your mother and your brothers are outside , asking for you. ”
CJB	Mark	3	33	He replied , “ Who are my mother and my brothers ? ”
CJB	Mark	3	34	Looking at those seated in a circle around him , he said , “ See ! Here are my mother and my brothers !
CJB	Mark	3	35	Whoever does what God wants is my brother , sister and mother ! ”
CJB	Mark	4	4	As he sowed , some seed fell alongside the path ; and the birds came and ate it up .
CJB	Mark	4	2	He taught them many things in parables . In the course of his teaching , he said to them :
CJB	Mark	4	3	“ Listen ! A farmer went out to sow his seed .
CJB	Mark	4	5	Other seed fell on rocky patches where there was not much soil . It sprouted quickly because the soil was shallow ;
CJB	Mark	4	6	but when the sun rose , the young plants were scorched ; and since their roots were not deep , they dried up .
CJB	Mark	4	7	Other seed fell among thorns , which grew up and choked it ; so that it yielded no grain .
CJB	Mark	4	8	But other seed fell into rich soil and produced grain ; it sprouted , and grew , and yielded a crop — thirty , sixty , even a hundred times what was sown. ”
CJB	Mark	4	9	And he concluded , “ Whoever has ears to hear with , let him hear ! ”
CJB	Mark	4	10	When Yeshua was alone , the people around him with the Twelve asked him about the parables .
CJB	Mark	4	11	He answered them , “ To you the secret of the Kingdom of God has been given ; but to those outside , everything is in parables ,
CJB	Mark	4	12	so that they may be always looking but never seeing ; always listening but never understanding . Otherwise , they might turn and be forgiven ! ” [ a ]
CJB	Mark	4	13	Then Yeshua said to them , “ Don ’ t you understand this parable ? How will you be able to understand any parable ?
CJB	Mark	4	14	The sower sows the message .
CJB	Mark	4	15	Those alongside the path where the message is sown are people who no sooner hear it than the Adversary comes and takes away the message sown in them .
CJB	Mark	4	16	Likewise , those receiving seed on rocky patches are people who hear the message and joyfully accept it at once ;
CJB	Mark	4	17	but they have no root in themselves . So they hold out for a while , but as soon as some trouble or persecution arises on account of the message , they immediately fall away .
CJB	Mark	4	18	Others are those sown among thorns — they hear the message ;
CJB	Mark	4	19	but the worries of the world , the deceitful glamor of wealth and all the other kinds of desires push in and choke the message ; so that it produces nothing .
CJB	Mark	4	20	But those sown on rich soil hear the message , accept it and bear fruit — thirty , sixty or a hundredfold. ”
CJB	Mark	4	21	He said to them , “ A lamp isn ’ t brought in to be put under a bowl or under the bed , is it ? Wouldn ’ t you put it on a lampstand ?
CJB	Mark	4	22	Indeed , nothing is hidden , except to be disclosed ; and nothing is covered up , except to come out into the open .
CJB	Mark	4	23	Those who have ears to hear with , let them hear ! ”
CJB	Mark	4	24	He also said to them , “ Pay attention to what you are hearing ! The measure with which you measure out will be used to measure to you — and more besides !
CJB	Mark	4	25	For anyone who has something will be given more ; but from anyone who has nothing , even what he does have will be taken away. ”
CJB	Mark	4	26	And he said , “ The Kingdom of God is like a man who scatters seed on the ground .
CJB	Mark	4	27	Nights he sleeps , days he ’ s awake ; and meanwhile the seeds sprout and grow — how , he doesn ’ t know .
CJB	Mark	4	28	By itself the soil produces a crop — first the stalk , then the head , and finally the full grain in the head .
CJB	Mark	4	29	But as soon as the crop is ready , the man comes with his sickle , because it ’ s harvest-time. ”
CJB	Mark	4	30	Yeshua also said , “ With what can we compare the Kingdom of God ? What illustration should we use to describe it ?
CJB	Mark	4	31	It is like a mustard seed , which , when planted , is the smallest of all the seeds in the field ;
CJB	Mark	4	32	but after it has been planted , it grows and becomes the largest of all the plants , with such big branches that the birds flying about can build nests in its shade. ”
CJB	Mark	4	33	With many parables like these he spoke the message to them , to the extent that they were capable of hearing it .
CJB	Mark	4	34	He did not say a thing to them without using a parable ; when he was alone with his own talmidim he explained everything to them .
CJB	Mark	4	35	That day , when evening had come , Yeshua said to them , “ Let ’ s cross to the other side of the lake. ”
CJB	Mark	4	36	So , leaving the crowd behind , they took him just as he was , in the boat ; and there were other boats with him .
CJB	Mark	4	37	A furious windstorm arose , and the waves broke over the boat , so that it was close to being swamped .
CJB	Mark	4	38	But he was in the stern on a cushion , asleep . They woke him and said to him , “ Rabbi , doesn ’ t it matter to you that we ’ re about to be killed ? ”
CJB	Mark	4	39	He awoke , rebuked the wind and said to the waves , “ Quiet ! Be still ! ” The wind subsided , and there was a dead calm .
CJB	Mark	4	40	He said to them , “ Why are you afraid ? Have you no trust even now ? ”
CJB	Mark	4	41	But they were terrified and asked each other , “ Who can this be , that even the wind and the waves obey him ? ” Footnotes - Mark 4:12 Isaiah 6:9–10
CJB	Mark	5	5	Night and day he wandered among the graves and through the hills , howling and gashing himself with stones .
CJB	Mark	5	2	As soon as he disembarked , a man with an unclean spirit came out of the burial caves to meet him .
CJB	Mark	5	3	He lived in the burial caves ; and no one could keep him tied up , not even with a chain .
CJB	Mark	5	4	He had often been chained hand and foot , but he would snap the chains and break the irons off his feet , and no one was strong enough to control him .
CJB	Mark	5	6	Seeing Yeshua from a distance , he ran and fell on his knees in front of him
CJB	Mark	5	7	and screamed at the top of his voice , “ What do you want with me , Yeshua , Son of God Ha ‘ Elyon ? I implore you in God ’ s name ! Don ’ t torture me ! ”
CJB	Mark	5	8	For Yeshua had already begun saying to him , “ Unclean spirit , come out of this man ! ”
CJB	Mark	5	9	Yeshua asked him , “ What ’ s your name ? ” “ My name is Legion , ” he answered , “ there are so many of us ” ;
CJB	Mark	5	10	and he kept begging Yeshua not to send them out of that region .
CJB	Mark	5	11	Now there was a large herd of pigs feeding near the hill ,
CJB	Mark	5	12	and the unclean spirits begged him , “ Send us to the pigs , so we can go into them. ”
CJB	Mark	5	13	Yeshua gave them permission . They came out and entered the pigs ; and the herd , numbering around two thousand , rushed down the hillside into the lake and were drowned .
CJB	Mark	5	14	The swineherds fled and told it in the town and in the surrounding country , and the people went to see what had happened .
CJB	Mark	5	15	They came to Yeshua and saw the man who had had the legion of demons , sitting there , dressed and in his right mind ; and they were frightened .
CJB	Mark	5	16	Those who had seen it told what had happened to the man controlled by demons and to the pigs ;
CJB	Mark	5	17	and the people began begging Yeshua to leave their district .
CJB	Mark	5	18	As he was getting into the boat , the man who had been demonized begged him to be allowed to go with him .
CJB	Mark	5	19	But Yeshua would not permit it . Instead , he said to him , “ Go home to your people , and tell them how much Adonai in his mercy has done for you. ”
CJB	Mark	5	20	He went off and began proclaiming in the Ten Towns how much Yeshua had done for him , and everyone was amazed .
CJB	Mark	5	21	Yeshua crossed in the boat to the other side of the lake , and a great crowd gathered around him .
CJB	Mark	5	22	There came to him a synagogue official , Ya ’ ir by name , who fell at his feet
CJB	Mark	5	23	and pleaded desperately with him , “ My little daughter is at the point of death . Please ! Come and lay your hands on her , so that she will get well and live ! ”
CJB	Mark	5	24	He went with him ; and a large crowd followed , pressing all around him .
CJB	Mark	5	25	Among them was a woman who had had a hemorrhage for twelve years
CJB	Mark	5	26	and had suffered a great deal under many physicians . She had spent her life savings ; yet instead of improving , she had grown worse .
CJB	Mark	5	27	She had heard about Yeshua , so she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his robe ;
CJB	Mark	5	28	for she said , “ If I touch even his clothes , I will be healed. ”
CJB	Mark	5	29	Instantly the hemorrhaging stopped , and she felt in her body that she had been healed from the disease .
CJB	Mark	5	30	At the same time , Yeshua , aware that power had gone out from him , turned around in the crowd and asked , “ Who touched my clothes ? ”
CJB	Mark	5	31	His talmidim responded , “ You see the people pressing in on you ; and still you ask , ‘ Who touched me ? ’ ”
CJB	Mark	5	32	But he kept looking around to see who had done it .
CJB	Mark	5	33	The woman , frightened and trembling , because she knew what had happened to her , came and fell down in front of him and told him the whole truth .
CJB	Mark	5	34	“ Daughter , ” he said to her , “ your trust has healed you . Go in peace , and be healed of your disease. ”
CJB	Mark	5	35	While he was still speaking , people from the synagogue official ’ s house came , saying , “ Your daughter has died . Why bother the rabbi any longer ? ”
CJB	Mark	5	36	Ignoring what they had said , Yeshua told the synagogue official , “ Don ’ t be afraid , just keep trusting. ”
CJB	Mark	5	37	He let no one follow him except Kefa , Ya ‘ akov and Yochanan , Ya ‘ akov ’ s brother .
CJB	Mark	5	38	When they came to the synagogue official ’ s house , he found a great commotion , with people weeping and wailing loudly .
CJB	Mark	5	39	On entering , he said to them , “ Why all this commotion and weeping ? The child isn ’ t dead , she ’ s just asleep ! ”
CJB	Mark	5	40	And they jeered at him . But he put them all outside , took the child ’ s father and mother and those with him , and went in where the child was .
CJB	Mark	5	41	Taking her by the hand , he said to her , “ Talita , kumi ! ” ( which means , “ Little girl , I say to you , get up ! ” ) .
CJB	Mark	5	42	At once the girl got up and began walking around ; she was twelve years old . Everybody was utterly amazed .
CJB	Mark	5	43	He gave them strict orders to say nothing about this to anyone , and told them to give her something to eat .
CJB	Mark	6	6	He was amazed at their lack of trust . Then he went through the surrounding towns and villages , teaching .
CJB	Mark	6	2	On Shabbat he started to teach in the synagogue , and many who heard him were astounded . They asked , “ Where did this man get all this ? What is this wisdom he has been given ? What are these miracles worked through him ?
CJB	Mark	6	3	Isn ’ t he just the carpenter ? the son of Miryam ? the brother of Ya ‘ akov and Yosi and Y ’ hudah and Shim ‘ on ? Aren ’ t his sisters here with us ? ” And they took offense at him .
CJB	Mark	6	4	But Yeshua said to them . “ The only place people don ’ t respect a prophet is in his home town , among his own relatives , and in his own house. ”
CJB	Mark	6	5	So he could do no miracles there , other than lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them .
CJB	Mark	6	7	Yeshua summoned the Twelve and started sending them out in pairs , giving them authority over the unclean spirits .
CJB	Mark	6	8	He instructed them , “ Take nothing for your trip except a walking stick — no bread , no pack , no money in your belt .
CJB	Mark	6	9	Wear shoes but not an extra shirt .
CJB	Mark	6	10	Whenever you enter a house , stay there until you leave the place ;
CJB	Mark	6	11	and if the people of some place will not welcome you , and they refuse to hear you , then , as you leave , shake the dust off your feet as a warning to them. ”
CJB	Mark	6	12	So they set out and preached that people should turn from sin to God ,
CJB	Mark	6	13	they expelled many demons , and they anointed many sick people with oil and healed them .
CJB	Mark	6	14	Meanwhile , King Herod heard about this , for Yeshua ’ s reputation had spread . Some were saying , “ Yochanan the Immerser has been raised from the dead ; that is why these miraculous powers are at work in him. ”
CJB	Mark	6	15	Others said , “ It is Eliyahu ! ” and still others , “ He is a prophet , like one of the old prophets. ”
CJB	Mark	6	16	But when Herod heard about it , he said , “ Yochanan , whom I had beheaded , has been raised. ”
CJB	Mark	6	17	For Herod had sent and had Yochanan arrested and chained in prison because of Herodias , the wife of his brother Philip . Herod had married her ,
CJB	Mark	6	18	but Yochanan had told him , “ It violates the Torah for you to marry your brother ’ s wife. ”
CJB	Mark	6	19	So Herodias had a grudge against him and wanted him put to death . But this she could not accomplish ,
CJB	Mark	6	20	because Herod stood in awe of Yochanan and protected him , for he knew that he was a tzaddik , a holy man . Whenever he heard him , he became deeply disturbed ; yet he liked to listen to him .
CJB	Mark	6	21	Finally , the opportunity came . Herod gave a banquet on his birthday for his nobles and officers and the leading men of the Galil .
CJB	Mark	6	22	The daughter of Herodias came in and danced , and she pleased Herod and his guests . The king said to the girl , “ Ask me for whatever you want ; I will give it to you ” ;
CJB	Mark	6	23	and he made a vow to her , “ Whatever you ask me , I will give you , up to half my kingdom. ”
CJB	Mark	6	24	So she went out and said to her mother , “ What should I ask for ? ” She said , “ The head of Yochanan the Immerser. ”
CJB	Mark	6	25	At once the daughter hurried back to the king and announced her request : “ I want you to give me right now on a platter the head of Yochanan the Immerser. ”
CJB	Mark	6	26	Herod was appalled ; but out of regard for the oaths he had sworn before his dinner guests , he did not want to break his word to her .
CJB	Mark	6	27	So the king immediately sent a soldier from his personal guard with orders to bring Yochanan ’ s head . The soldier went and beheaded Yochanan in the prison ,
CJB	Mark	6	28	brought his head on a platter , and gave it to the girl ; and the girl gave it to her mother .
CJB	Mark	6	29	When Yochanan ’ s talmidim heard of it , they came and took the body and laid it in a grave .
CJB	Mark	6	30	Those who had been sent out rejoined Yeshua and reported to him all they had done and taught .
CJB	Mark	6	31	There were so many people coming and going that they couldn ’ t even take time to eat , so he said to them , “ Come with me by yourselves to a place where we can be alone , and you can get some rest. ”
CJB	Mark	6	32	They went off by themselves to an isolated spot ;
CJB	Mark	6	33	but many people , seeing them leave and recognizing them , ran ahead on foot from all the towns and got there first .
CJB	Mark	6	34	When Yeshua came ashore , he saw a huge crowd . Filled with compassion for them , because they were like sheep without a shepherd , he began teaching them many things .
CJB	Mark	6	35	By this time , the hour was late . The talmidim came to him and said , “ This is a remote place , and it ’ s getting late .
CJB	Mark	6	36	Send the people away , so that they can go and buy food for themselves in the farms and towns around here. ”
CJB	Mark	6	37	But he answered them , “ Give them something to eat , yourselves ! ” They replied , “ We are to go and spend thousands on bread , and give it to them to eat ? ”
CJB	Mark	6	38	He asked them , “ How many loaves do you have ? Go and check. ” When they had found out , they said , “ Five . And two fish. ”
CJB	Mark	6	39	Then he ordered all the people to sit down in groups on the green grass .
CJB	Mark	6	40	They sat down in groups of fifty or a hundred .
CJB	Mark	6	41	Then he took the five loaves and the two fish , and , looking up toward heaven , made a b ’ rakhah . Next he broke up the loaves and began giving them to the talmidim to distribute . He also divided up the two fish among them all .
CJB	Mark	6	42	They all ate as much as they wanted ,
CJB	Mark	6	43	and they took up twelve baskets full of the broken pieces and fish .
CJB	Mark	6	44	Those who ate the loaves numbered five thousand men .
CJB	Mark	6	45	Immediately Yeshua had his talmidim get in the boat and go on ahead of him toward the other side of the lake , toward Beit-Tzaidah , while he sent the crowds away .
CJB	Mark	6	46	After he had left them , he went into the hills to pray .
CJB	Mark	6	47	When night came , the boat was out on the lake , and he was by himself on land .
CJB	Mark	6	48	He saw that they were having difficulty rowing , because the wind was against them ; so at around four o ’ clock in the morning he came toward them , walking on the lake ! He meant to come alongside them ;
CJB	Mark	6	49	but when they saw him walking on the lake , they thought it was a ghost and let out a shriek ;
CJB	Mark	6	50	for they had all seen him and were terrified . However , he spoke to them . “ Courage , ” he said , “ it is I . Stop being afraid ! ”
CJB	Mark	6	51	He got into the boat with them , and the wind ceased . They were completely astounded ,
CJB	Mark	6	52	for they did not understand about the loaves ; on the contrary , their hearts had been made stone-like .
CJB	Mark	6	53	After they had made the crossing , they landed at Ginosar and anchored .
CJB	Mark	6	54	As soon as they got out of the boat , the people recognized him
CJB	Mark	6	55	and began running around throughout that whole region and bringing sick people on their stretchers to any place where they heard he was .
CJB	Mark	6	56	Wherever he went , in towns , cities or country , they laid the sick in the marketplaces . They begged him to let them touch even the tzitzit on his robe , and all who touched it were healed .
CJB	Mark	7	7	Their worship of me is useless , because they teach man-made rules as if they were doctrines. ’ [ a ]
CJB	Mark	7	2	and saw that some of his talmidim ate with ritually unclean hands , that is , without doing n ’ tilat-yadayim .
CJB	Mark	7	3	( For the P ’ rushim , and indeed all the Judeans , holding fast to the Tradition of the Elders , do not eat unless they have given their hands a ceremonial washing .
CJB	Mark	7	4	Also , when they come from the marketplace they do not eat unless they have rinsed their hands up to the wrist ; and they adhere to many other traditions , such as washing cups , pots and bronze vessels . )
CJB	Mark	7	5	The P ’ rushim and the Torah-teachers asked him , “ Why don ’ t your talmidim live in accordance with the Tradition of the Elders , but instead eat with ritually unclean hands ? ”
CJB	Mark	7	6	Yeshua answered them , “ Yesha ‘ yahu was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites — as it is written , ‘ These people honor me with their lips , but their hearts are far away from me .
CJB	Mark	7	8	“ You depart from God ’ s command and hold onto human tradition .
CJB	Mark	7	9	Indeed , ” he said to them , “ you have made a fine art of departing from God ’ s command in order to keep your tradition !
CJB	Mark	7	10	For Moshe said , ‘ Honor your father and your mother , ’ [ b ] and ‘ Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death. ’ [ c ]
CJB	Mark	7	11	But you say , ‘ If someone says to his father or mother , “ I have promised as a korban ” ’ ” ( that is , as a gift to God ) “ ‘ “ what I might have used to help you , ” ’
CJB	Mark	7	12	then you no longer let him do anything for his father or mother .
CJB	Mark	7	13	Thus , with your tradition which you had handed down to you , you nullify the Word of God ! And you do other things like this. ”
CJB	Mark	7	14	Then Yeshua called the people to him again and said , “ Listen to me , all of you , and understand this !
CJB	Mark	7	15	There is nothing outside a person which , by going into him , can make him unclean . Rather , it is the things that come out of a person which make a person unclean ! ”
CJB	Mark	7	16	[ d ]
CJB	Mark	7	17	When he had left the people and entered the house , his talmidim asked him about the parable .
CJB	Mark	7	18	He replied to them , “ So you too are without understanding ? Don ’ t you see that nothing going into a person from outside can make him unclean ?
CJB	Mark	7	19	For it doesn ’ t go into his heart but into his stomach , and it passes out into the latrine. ” ( Thus he declared all foods ritually clean . )
CJB	Mark	7	20	“ It is what comes out of a person , ” he went on , “ that makes him unclean .
CJB	Mark	7	21	For from within , out of a person ’ s heart , come forth wicked thoughts , sexual immorality , theft , murder , adultery ,
CJB	Mark	7	22	greed , malice , deceit , indecency , envy , slander , arrogance , foolishness… .
CJB	Mark	7	23	All these wicked things come from within , and they make a person unclean. ”
CJB	Mark	7	24	Next , Yeshua left that district and went off to the vicinity of Tzor and Tzidon . There he found a house to stay in and wanted to remain unrecognized , but keeping hidden proved impossible .
CJB	Mark	7	25	Instead , a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit in her came to him and fell down at his feet .
CJB	Mark	7	26	The woman was a Greek , by birth a Syro-phoenician , and she begged him to drive the demon out of her daughter .
CJB	Mark	7	27	He said , “ Let the children be fed first , for it is not right to take the children ’ s food and toss it to their pet dogs. ”
CJB	Mark	7	28	She answered him , “ That is true , sir ; but even the dogs under the table eat the children ’ s leftovers. ”
CJB	Mark	7	29	Then he said to her , “ For such an answer you may go on home ; the demon has left your daughter. ”
CJB	Mark	7	30	She went back home and found the child lying on the couch , the demon gone .
CJB	Mark	7	31	Then he left the district of Tzor and went through Tzidon to Lake Kinneret and on to the region of the Ten Towns .
CJB	Mark	7	32	They brought him a man who was deaf and had a speech impediment and asked Yeshua to lay his hand on him .
CJB	Mark	7	33	Taking him off alone , away from the crowd , Yeshua put his fingers into the man ’ s ears , spat , and touched his tongue ;
CJB	Mark	7	34	then , looking up to heaven , he gave a deep groan and said to him , “ Hippatach ! ” ( that is , “ Be opened ! ” ) .
CJB	Mark	7	35	His ears were opened , his tongue was freed , and he began speaking clearly .
CJB	Mark	7	36	Yeshua ordered the people to tell no one ; but the more he insisted , the more zealously they spread the news .
CJB	Mark	7	37	People were overcome with amazement . “ Everything he does , he does well ! ” they said . “ He even makes the deaf hear and the dumb speak ! ”
CJB	Mark	8	8	The people ate their fill ; and the talmidim took up the leftover pieces , seven large basketsful .
CJB	Mark	8	2	“ I feel sorry for these people , because they have been with me three days , and now they have nothing to eat .
CJB	Mark	8	3	If I send them off to their homes hungry , they will collapse on the way ; some of them have come a long distance. ”
CJB	Mark	8	4	His talmidim said to him , “ How can anyone find enough bread to satisfy these people in a remote place like this ? ”
CJB	Mark	8	5	“ How many loaves do you have ? ” he asked them . They answered , “ Seven. ”
CJB	Mark	8	6	He then told the crowd to sit down on the ground , took the seven loaves , made a b ’ rakhah , broke the loaves and gave them to his talmidim to serve to the people .
CJB	Mark	8	7	They also had a few fish ; making a b ’ rakhah over them he also ordered these to be served .
CJB	Mark	8	9	About four thousand were there .
CJB	Mark	8	10	After sending them away , Yeshua got into the boat with his talmidim and went off to the district of Dalmanuta .
CJB	Mark	8	11	The P ’ rushim came and began arguing with him ; they wanted him to give them a sign from Heaven , because they were out to trap him .
CJB	Mark	8	12	With a sigh that came straight from his heart , he said , “ Why does this generation want a sign ? Yes ! I tell you , no sign will be given to this generation ! ”
CJB	Mark	8	13	With that , he left them , got into the boat again and went off to the other side of the lake .
CJB	Mark	8	14	Now the talmidim had forgotten to bring bread and had with them in the boat only one loaf .
CJB	Mark	8	15	So when Yeshua said to them , “ Watch out ! Guard yourselves from the hametz of the P ’ rushim and the hametz of Herod , ”
CJB	Mark	8	16	they thought he had said it because they had no bread .
CJB	Mark	8	17	But , aware of this , he said , “ Why are you talking with each other about having no bread ? Don ’ t you see or understand yet ? Have your hearts been made like stone ?
CJB	Mark	8	18	You have eyes — don ’ t you see ? You have ears — don ’ t you hear ? And don ’ t you remember ?
CJB	Mark	8	19	When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand , how many baskets full of broken pieces did you collect ? ” “ Twelve , ” they answered him .
CJB	Mark	8	20	“ And when I broke the seven loaves for the four thousand , how many baskets full of broken pieces did you collect ? ” “ Seven , ” they answered .
CJB	Mark	8	21	He said to them , “ And you still don ’ t understand ? ”
CJB	Mark	8	22	They came to Beit-Tzaidah . Some people brought him a blind man and begged Yeshua to touch him .
CJB	Mark	8	23	Taking the blind man ’ s hand , he led him outside the town . He spit in his eyes , put his hands on him and asked him , “ Do you see anything ? ”
CJB	Mark	8	24	He looked up and said , “ I see people , but they look like walking trees. ”
CJB	Mark	8	25	Then he put his hands on the blind man ’ s eyes again . He peered intently , and his eyesight was restored , so that he could see everything distinctly .
CJB	Mark	8	26	Yeshua sent him home with the words , “ Don ’ t go into town. ”
CJB	Mark	8	27	Yeshua and his talmidim went on to the towns of Caesarea Philippi . On the way , he asked his talmidim , “ Who are people saying I am ? ”
CJB	Mark	8	28	“ Some say you are Yochanan the Immerser , ” they told him , “ others say Eliyahu , and still others , one of the prophets. ”
CJB	Mark	8	29	“ But you , ” he asked , “ who do you say I am ? ” Kefa answered , “ You are the Mashiach. ”
CJB	Mark	8	30	Then Yeshua warned them not to tell anyone about him .
CJB	Mark	8	31	He began teaching them that the Son of Man had to endure much suffering and be rejected by the elders , the head cohanim and the Torah-teachers ; and that he had to be put to death ; but that after three days , he had to rise again .
CJB	Mark	8	32	He spoke very plainly about it . Kefa took him aside and began rebuking him .
CJB	Mark	8	33	But , turning around and looking at his talmidim , he rebuked Kefa . “ Get behind me , Satan ! ” he said , “ For your thinking is from a human perspective , not from God ’ s perspective ! ”
CJB	Mark	8	34	Then Yeshua called the crowd and his talmidim to him and told them , “ If anyone wants to come after me , let him say ‘ No ’ to himself , take up his execution-stake , and keep following me .
CJB	Mark	8	35	For whoever wants to save his own life will destroy it , but whoever destroys his life for my sake and for the sake of the Good News will save it .
CJB	Mark	8	36	Indeed , what will it benefit a person if he gains the whole world but forfeits his life ?
CJB	Mark	8	37	What could a person give in exchange for his life ?
CJB	Mark	8	38	For if someone is ashamed of me and of what I say in this adulterous and sinful generation , the Son of Man also will be ashamed of him when he comes in his Father ’ s glory with the holy angels .
CJB	Mark	9	9	As they came down the mountain , he warned them not to tell anyone what they had seen until after the Son of Man had risen from the dead .
CJB	Mark	9	2	Six days later , Yeshua took Kefa , Ya ‘ akov and Yochanan and led them up a high mountain privately . As they watched , he began to change form ,
CJB	Mark	9	3	and his clothes became dazzlingly white , whiter than anyone in the world could possibly bleach them .
CJB	Mark	9	4	Then they saw Eliyahu and Moshe speaking with Yeshua .
CJB	Mark	9	5	Kefa said to Yeshua , “ It ’ s good that we ’ re here , Rabbi ! Let ’ s put up three shelters — one for you , one for Moshe and one for Eliyahu. ”
CJB	Mark	9	6	( He didn ’ t know what to say , they were so frightened . )
CJB	Mark	9	7	Then a cloud enveloped them ; and a voice came out of the cloud , “ This is my Son , whom I love . Listen to him ! ”
CJB	Mark	9	8	Suddenly , when they looked around , they no longer saw anyone with them except Yeshua .
CJB	Mark	9	10	So they kept the matter to themselves ; but they continued asking each other , “ What is this ‘ rising from the dead ’ ? ”
CJB	Mark	9	11	They also asked him , “ Why do the Torah-teachers say that Eliyahu has to come first ? ”
CJB	Mark	9	12	“ Eliyahu will indeed come first , ” he answered , “ and he will restore everything . Nevertheless , why is it written in the Tanakh that the Son of Man must suffer much and be rejected ?
CJB	Mark	9	13	There ’ s more to it : I tell you that Eliyahu has come , and they did whatever they pleased to him , just as the Tanakh says about him. ”
CJB	Mark	9	14	When they got back to the talmidim , they saw a large crowd around them and some Torah-teachers arguing with them .
CJB	Mark	9	15	As soon as the crowd saw him , they were surprised and ran out to greet him .
CJB	Mark	9	16	He asked them , “ What ’ s the discussion about ? ”
CJB	Mark	9	17	One of the crowd gave him the answer : “ Rabbi , I brought my son to you because he has an evil spirit in him that makes him unable to talk .
CJB	Mark	9	18	Whenever it seizes him , it throws him to the ground — he foams at the mouth , grinds his teeth and becomes stiff all over . I asked your talmidim to drive the spirit out , but they couldn ’ t do it. ”
CJB	Mark	9	19	“ People without any trust ! ” he responded . “ How long will I be with you ? How long must I put up with you ? Bring him to me ! ”
CJB	Mark	9	20	They brought the boy to him ; and as soon as the spirit saw him , it threw the boy into a convulsion .
CJB	Mark	9	21	Yeshua asked the boy ’ s father , “ How long has this been happening to him ? ” “ Ever since childhood , ” he said ;
CJB	Mark	9	22	“ and it often tries to kill him by throwing him into the fire or into the water . But if you can do anything , have pity on us and help us ! ”
CJB	Mark	9	23	Yeshua said to him , “ What do you mean , ‘ if you can ’ ? Everything is possible to someone who has trust ! ”
CJB	Mark	9	24	Instantly the father of the child exclaimed , “ I do trust — help my lack of trust ! ”
CJB	Mark	9	25	When Yeshua saw that the crowd was closing in on them , he rebuked the unclean spirit , saying to it , “ You deaf and dumb spirit ! I command you : come out of him , and never go back into him again ! ”
CJB	Mark	9	26	Shrieking and throwing the boy into a violent fit , it came out . The boy lay there like a corpse , so that most of the people said he was dead .
CJB	Mark	9	27	But Yeshua took him by the hand and raised him to his feet , and he stood up .
CJB	Mark	9	28	After Yeshua had gone indoors , his talmidim asked him privately , “ Why couldn ’ t we drive it out ? ”
CJB	Mark	9	29	He said to them “ This is the kind of spirit that can be driven out only by prayer. ”
CJB	Mark	9	30	After leaving that place , they went on through the Galil . Yeshua didn ’ t want anyone to know ,
CJB	Mark	9	31	because he was teaching his talmidim . He told them , “ The Son of Man will be betrayed into the hands of men who will put him to death ; but after he has been killed , three days later he will rise. ”
CJB	Mark	9	32	But they didn ’ t understand what he meant , and they were afraid to ask him .
CJB	Mark	9	33	They arrived at K ’ far-Nachum . When Yeshua was inside the house , he asked them , “ What were you discussing as we were traveling ? ”
CJB	Mark	9	34	But they kept quiet ; because on the way , they had been arguing with each other about who was the greatest .
CJB	Mark	9	35	He sat down , summoned the Twelve and said to them , “ If anyone wants to be first , he must make himself last of all and servant of all. ”
CJB	Mark	9	36	He took a child and stood him among them . Then he put his arms around him and said to them ,
CJB	Mark	9	37	“ Whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me , and whoever welcomes me welcomes not me but the One who sent me. ”
CJB	Mark	9	38	Yochanan said to him , “ Rabbi , we saw a man expelling demons in your name ; and because he wasn ’ t one of us , we told him to stop. ”
CJB	Mark	9	39	But Yeshua said , “ Don ’ t stop him , because no one who works a miracle in my name will soon after be able to say something bad about me .
CJB	Mark	9	40	For whoever is not against us is for us .
CJB	Mark	9	41	Indeed , whoever gives you even a cup of water to drink because you come in the name of the Messiah — yes ! I tell you that he will certainly not lose his reward .
CJB	Mark	9	42	“ Whoever ensnares one of these little ones who trust me — it would be better for him to have a millstone hung around his neck and be thrown in the sea .
CJB	Mark	9	43	If your hand makes you sin , cut it off ! Better that you should be maimed but obtain eternal life , rather than keep both hands and go to Gei-Hinnom , to unquenchable fire !
CJB	Mark	9	44	[ a ]
CJB	Mark	9	45	And if your foot makes you sin , cut it off ! Better that you should be lame but obtain eternal life , rather than keep both feet and be thrown into Gei-Hinnom !
CJB	Mark	9	46	[ b ]
CJB	Mark	9	47	And if your eye makes you sin , pluck it out ! Better that you should be one-eyed but enter the Kingdom of God , rather than keep both eyes and be thrown into Gei-Hinnom ,
CJB	Mark	9	48	where their worm does not die , and the fire is not quenched . [ c ]
CJB	Mark	9	49	Indeed , everyone is going to be salted with fire .
CJB	Mark	9	50	Salt is excellent , but if it loses its saltiness , how will you season it ? So have salt in yourselves — that is , be at peace with each other . ”
CJB	Mark	10	10	When they were indoors once more , the talmidim asked him about this .
CJB	Mark	10	2	Some P ’ rushim came up and tried to trap him by asking him , “ Does the Torah permit a man to divorce his wife ? ”
CJB	Mark	10	3	- Mark 10:6 Genesis 1:27 , 5:2 - Mark 10:8 Genesis 2:24 - Mark 10:19 Exodus 20:12–13 (
CJB	Mark	10	4	They said , “ Moshe allowed a man to hand his wife a get and divorce her. ” [ a ]
CJB	Mark	10	5	But Yeshua said to them , “ He wrote this commandment for you because of your hardheartedness .
CJB	Mark	10	6	However , at the beginning of creation , God made them male and female . [ b ]
CJB	Mark	10	7	For this reason , a man should leave his father and mother and be united with his wife ,
CJB	Mark	10	8	and the two are to become one flesh . [ c ] Thus they are no longer two , but one .
CJB	Mark	10	9	So then , no one should break apart what God has joined together. ”
CJB	Mark	10	11	He said to them , “ Whoever divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against his wife ;
CJB	Mark	10	12	and if a wife divorces her husband and marries another man , she too commits adultery. ”
CJB	Mark	10	13	People were bringing children to him so that he might touch them , but the talmidim rebuked those people .
CJB	Mark	10	14	However , when Yeshua saw it , he became indignant and said to them , “ Let the children come to me , don ’ t stop them , for the Kingdom of God belongs to such as these .
CJB	Mark	10	15	Yes ! I tell you , whoever does not receive the Kingdom of God like a child will not enter it ! ”
CJB	Mark	10	16	) ; Deuteronomy 5:16–17 (
CJB	Mark	10	17	As he was starting on his way , a man ran up , kneeled down in front of him and asked , “ Good rabbi , what should I do to obtain eternal life ? ”
CJB	Mark	10	18	Yeshua said to him , “ Why are you calling me good ? No one is good except God !
CJB	Mark	10	19	You know the mitzvot — ‘ Don ’ t murder , don ’ t commit adultery , don ’ t steal , don ’ t give false testimony , don ’ t defraud , honor your father and mother , . . . ’ ” [ d ]
CJB	Mark	10	20	) - Mark 10:34 Isaiah 50:6 , Hosea 6:2
CJB	Mark	10	21	Yeshua , looking at him , felt love for him and said to him , “ You ’ re missing one thing . Go , sell whatever you own , give to the poor , and you will have riches in heaven . Then come , follow me ! ”
CJB	Mark	10	22	Shocked by this word , he went away sad ; because he was a wealthy man .
CJB	Mark	10	23	Yeshua looked around and said to his talmidim , “ How hard it is going to be for people with wealth to enter the Kingdom of God ! ”
CJB	Mark	10	24	The talmidim were astounded at these words ; but Yeshua said to them again , “ My friends , how hard it is to enter the Kingdom of God !
CJB	Mark	10	25	It ’ s easier for a camel to pass through a needle ’ s eye than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God. ”
CJB	Mark	10	26	They were utterly amazed and said to him , “ Then who can be saved ? ”
CJB	Mark	10	27	Yeshua looked at them and said , “ Humanly , it is impossible , but not with God ; with God , everything is possible. ”
CJB	Mark	10	28	Kefa began saying to him , “ Look , we have left everything and followed you. ”
CJB	Mark	10	29	Yeshua said , “ Yes ! I tell you that there is no one who has left house , brothers , sisters , mother , father , children or fields , for my sake and for the sake of the Good News ,
CJB	Mark	10	30	who will not receive a hundred times over , now , in the ‘ olam hazeh , homes , brothers , sisters , mothers , children and lands — with persecutions ! — and in the ‘ olam haba , eternal life .
CJB	Mark	10	31	But many who are first will be last , and many who are last will be first ! ”
CJB	Mark	10	32	They were on the road going up to Yerushalayim . Yeshua was walking ahead of them , and they were amazed — and those following were afraid . So again taking the Twelve along with him , he began telling them what was about to happen to him .
CJB	Mark	10	33	“ We are now going up to Yerushalayim , where the Son of Man will be handed over to the head cohanim and the Torah-teachers . They will sentence him to death and turn him over to the Goyim ,
CJB	Mark	10	34	who will jeer at him , spit on him , beat him and kill him ; but after three days , he will rise. ” [ e ]
CJB	Mark	10	35	Ya ‘ akov and Yochanan , the sons of Zavdai , came up to him and said , “ Rabbi , we would like you to do us a favor. ”
CJB	Mark	10	36	He said to them , “ What do you want me to do for you ? ”
CJB	Mark	10	37	They replied , “ When you are in your glory , let us sit with you , one on your right and the other on your left. ”
CJB	Mark	10	38	But Yeshua answered , “ You don ’ t know what you ’ re asking ! Can you drink the cup that I am drinking ? or be immersed with the immersion that I must undergo ? ”
CJB	Mark	10	39	They said to him , “ We can. ” Yeshua replied , “ The cup that I am drinking , you will drink ; and the immersion I am being immersed with , you will undergo .
CJB	Mark	10	40	But to sit on my right and on my left is not mine to give . Rather , it is for those for whom it has been prepared. ”
CJB	Mark	10	41	When the other ten heard about this , they became outraged at Ya ‘ akov and Yochanan .
CJB	Mark	10	42	But Yeshua called them to him and said to them , “ You know that among the Goyim , those who are supposed to rule them become tyrants , and their superiors become dictators .
CJB	Mark	10	43	But among you , it must not be like that ! On the contrary , whoever among you wants to be a leader must be your servant ;
CJB	Mark	10	44	and whoever wants to be first among you must become everyone ’ s slave !
CJB	Mark	10	45	For the Son of Man did not come to be served , but to serve — and to give his life as a ransom for many. ”
CJB	Mark	10	46	They came to Yericho ; and as Yeshua was leaving Yericho with his talmidim and a great crowd , a blind beggar , Bar-Timai ( son of Timai ) , was sitting by the side of the road .
CJB	Mark	10	47	When he heard that it was Yeshua from Natzeret , he started shouting , “ Yeshua ! Son of David ! Have pity on me ! ”
CJB	Mark	10	48	Many people scolded him and told him to be quiet , but he shouted all the louder , “ Son of David ! Have pity on me ! ”
CJB	Mark	10	49	Yeshua stopped and said , “ Call him over ! ” They called to the blind man , “ Courage ! Get up ! He ’ s calling for you ! ”
CJB	Mark	10	50	Throwing down his blanket , he jumped up and came over to Yeshua .
CJB	Mark	10	51	“ What do you want me to do for you ? ” asked Yeshua . The blind man said to him , “ Rabbi , let me be able to see again. ”
CJB	Mark	10	52	Yeshua said to him , “ Go ! Your trust has healed you. ” Instantly he received his sight and followed him on the road . Footnotes - Mark 10:4 Deuteronomy 24:1 ,
CJB	Mark	11	11	Yeshua entered Yerushalayim , went into the Temple courts and took a good look at everything ; but since it was now late , he went out with the Twelve to Beit-Anyah .
CJB	Mark	11	2	with these instructions : “ Go into the village ahead of you ; and as soon as you enter it , you will find a colt tied there that has never been ridden . Untie it , and bring it here .
CJB	Mark	11	3	If anyone asks you , ‘ Why are you doing this ? ’ tell him , ‘ The Lord needs it , ’ and he will send it here right away. ”
CJB	Mark	11	4	They went off and found a colt in the street tied in a doorway , and they untied it .
CJB	Mark	11	5	The bystanders said to them , “ What are you doing , untying that colt ? ”
CJB	Mark	11	6	They gave the answer Yeshua had told them to give , and they let them continue .
CJB	Mark	11	7	They brought the colt to Yeshua and threw their robes on it , and he sat on it .
CJB	Mark	11	8	Many people carpeted the road with their clothing , while others spread out green branches which they had cut in the fields .
CJB	Mark	11	9	Those who were ahead and those behind shouted , “ Blessed is he who comes in the name of Adonai ! ” [ c ]
CJB	Mark	11	10	“ Blessed is the coming Kingdom of our father David ! ” and ,
CJB	Mark	11	12	The next day , as they came back from Beit-Anyah , he felt hungry .
CJB	Mark	11	13	Spotting in the distance a fig tree in leaf , he went to see if he could find anything on it . When he came up to it , he found nothing but leaves ; for it wasn ’ t fig season .
CJB	Mark	11	14	He said to it , “ May no one ever eat fruit from you again ! ” And his talmidim heard what he said .
CJB	Mark	11	15	On reaching Yerushalayim , he entered the Temple courts and began driving out those who were carrying on business there , both the merchants and their customers . He also knocked over the desks of the money-changers , upset the benches of the pigeon-dealers ,
CJB	Mark	11	16	and refused to let anyone carry merchandise through the Temple courts .
CJB	Mark	11	17	Then , as he taught them , he said , “ Isn ’ t it written in the Tanakh , My house will be called a house of prayer for all the Goyim [ f ] But you have made it into a den of robbers ! ” [ g ]
CJB	Mark	11	18	The head cohanim and the Torah-teachers heard what he said and tried to find a way to do away with him ; they were afraid of him , because the crowds were utterly taken by his teaching .
CJB	Mark	11	19	When evening came , they left the city .
CJB	Mark	11	20	In the morning , as the talmidim passed by , they saw the fig tree withered all the way to its roots .
CJB	Mark	11	21	Kefa remembered and said to Yeshua , “ Rabbi ! Look ! The fig tree that you cursed has dried up ! ”
CJB	Mark	11	22	He responded , “ Have the kind of trust that comes from God !
CJB	Mark	11	23	Yes ! I tell you that whoever does not doubt in his heart but trusts that what he says will happen can say to this mountain , ‘ Go and throw yourself into the sea ! ’ and it will be done for him .
CJB	Mark	11	24	Therefore , I tell you , whatever you ask for in prayer , trust that you are receiving it , and it will be yours .
CJB	Mark	11	25	And when you stand praying , if you have anything against anyone , forgive him ; so that your Father in heaven may also forgive your offenses. ”
CJB	Mark	11	26	[ h ]
CJB	Mark	11	27	They went back into Yerushalayim ; and as he was walking in the Temple courts , there came to him the head cohanim , the Torah-teachers and the elders ;
CJB	Mark	11	28	and they said to him , “ What s ’ mikhah do you have that authorizes you to do these things ? Who gave you this s ’ mikhah authorizing you to do them ? ”
CJB	Mark	11	29	Yeshua said to them , “ I will ask you just one question : answer me , and I will tell you by what s ’ mikhah I do these things .
CJB	Mark	11	30	The immersion of Yochanan — was it from Heaven or from a human source ? Answer me. ”
CJB	Mark	11	31	They discussed it among themselves : “ If we say , ‘ From Heaven , ’ he will say , ‘ Then why didn ’ t you believe him ? ’
CJB	Mark	11	32	But if we say , ‘ From a human source , . . . ’ ” — they were afraid of the people , for they all regarded Yochanan as a genuine prophet .
CJB	Mark	11	33	So they answered Yeshua , “ We don ’ t know. ” “ Then , ” he replied , “ I won ’ t tell you by what s ’ mikhah I do these things. ” Footnotes - Mark 11:9 Psalm 118:25 - Mark 11:9 See note , p.
CJB	Mark	11	1249	. - Mark 11:17 Isaiah 56:7 - Mark 11:17 Jeremiah 7:11 - Mark 11:26 Some manuscripts include verse 11:26 : But if you do not forgive , your Father in heaven will not forgive your offenses . ”
CJB	Mark	12	12	They set about to arrest him , for they recognized that he had told the parable with reference to themselves . But they were afraid of the crowd , so they left him and went away .
CJB	Mark	12	2	When harvest-time came , he sent a servant to the tenants to collect his share of the crop from the vineyard .
CJB	Mark	12	3	But they took him , beat him up and sent him away empty-handed .
CJB	Mark	12	4	So he sent another servant ; this one they punched in the head and insulted .
CJB	Mark	12	5	He sent another one , and him they killed ; and so with many others — some they beat up , others they killed .
CJB	Mark	12	6	He had still one person left , a son whom he loved ; in the end , he sent him to them , saying , ‘ My son they will respect. ’
CJB	Mark	12	7	But the tenants said to each other , ‘ This is the heir . Come , let ’ s kill him , and the inheritance will be ours ! ’
CJB	Mark	12	8	So they seized him , killed him and threw him out of the vineyard .
CJB	Mark	12	9	What will the owner of the vineyard do ? He will come , destroy those tenants and give the vineyard to others !
CJB	Mark	12	10	Haven ’ t you read the passage in the Tanakh that says , ‘ The very rock which the builders rejected has become the cornerstone !
CJB	Mark	12	11	This has come from Adonai , and in our eyes it is amazing ’ ? ” [ a ]
CJB	Mark	12	13	Next they sent some P ’ rushim and some members of Herod ’ s party to him in order to trap him with a sh ’ eilah .
CJB	Mark	12	14	They came and said to him , “ Rabbi , we know that you tell the truth and are not concerned with what people think about you , since you pay no attention to a person ’ s status but really teach what God ’ s way is . Does Torah say that taxes are to be paid to the Roman Emperor , or not ? ”
CJB	Mark	12	15	But he , knowing their hypocrisy , said to them , “ Why are you trying to trap me ? Bring me a denarius so I can look at it. ”
CJB	Mark	12	16	They brought one ; and he asked them , “ Whose name and picture are these ? ” “ The Emperor ’ s , ” they replied .
CJB	Mark	12	17	Yeshua said , “ Give the Emperor what belongs to the Emperor . And give to God what belongs to God ! ” And they were amazed at him .
CJB	Mark	12	18	Then some Tz ’ dukim came to him . They are the ones who say there is no such thing as resurrection , so they put to him a sh ’ eilah :
CJB	Mark	12	19	“ Rabbi , Moshe wrote for us that if a man ’ s brother dies and leaves a wife but no child , his brother must take the wife and have children to preserve the man ’ s family line . [ b ]
CJB	Mark	12	20	There were seven brothers . The first one took a wife , and when he died , he left no children .
CJB	Mark	12	21	Then the second one took her and died without leaving children , and the third likewise ,
CJB	Mark	12	22	and none of the seven left children . Last of all , the woman also died .
CJB	Mark	12	23	In the Resurrection , whose wife will she be ? For all seven had her as wife. ”
CJB	Mark	12	24	Yeshua said to them , “ Isn ’ t this the reason that you go astray ? because you are ignorant both of the Tanakh and of the power of God ?
CJB	Mark	12	25	For when people rise from the dead , neither men nor women marry — they are like angels in heaven .
CJB	Mark	12	26	And as for the dead being raised , haven ’ t you read in the book of Moshe , in the passage about the bush , how God said to him , ‘ I am the God of Avraham , the God of Yitz ’ chak and the God of Ya ‘ akov ’ ? [ c ]
CJB	Mark	12	27	He is God not of the dead , but of the living ! You are going far astray ! ”
CJB	Mark	12	28	One of the Torah-teachers came up and heard them engaged in this discussion . Seeing that Yeshua answered them well , he asked him , “ Which is the most important mitzvah of them all ? ”
CJB	Mark	12	29	Yeshua answered , “ The most important is , ‘ Sh ’ ma Yisra ’ el , Adonai Eloheinu , Adonai echad [ Hear , O Isra ’ el , the Lord our God , the Lord is one ] ,
CJB	Mark	12	30	and you are to love Adonai your God with all your heart , with all your soul , with all your understanding and with all your strength. ’ [ d ]
CJB	Mark	12	31	The second is this : ‘ You are to love your neighbor as yourself. ’ [ e ] There is no other mitzvah greater than these. ”
CJB	Mark	12	32	The Torah-teacher said to him , “ Well said , Rabbi ; you speak the truth when you say that he is one , and that there is no other besides him ;
CJB	Mark	12	33	and that loving him with all one ’ s heart , understanding and strength , and loving one ’ s neighbor as oneself , mean more than all the burnt offerings and sacrifices. ”
CJB	Mark	12	34	When Yeshua saw that he responded sensibly , he said to him , “ You are not far from the Kingdom of God. ” And after that , no one dared put to him another sh ’ eilah .
CJB	Mark	12	35	As Yeshua was teaching in the Temple , he asked , “ How is it that the Torah-teachers say the Messiah is the Son of David ?
CJB	Mark	12	36	David himself , inspired by the Ruach HaKodesh , said , ‘ Adonai said to my Lord , “ Sit here at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet. ” ’ [ f ]
CJB	Mark	12	37	David himself calls him ‘ Lord ’ ; so how is he his son ? ” The great crowd listened eagerly to him .
CJB	Mark	12	38	As he taught them , he said , “ Watch out for the kind of Torah-teachers who like to walk around in robes and be greeted deferentially in the marketplaces ,
CJB	Mark	12	39	who like to have the best seats in the synagogues and take the places of honor at banquets ,
CJB	Mark	12	40	who like to swallow up widows ’ houses while making a show of davvening at great length . Their punishment will be all the worse ! ”
CJB	Mark	12	41	Then Yeshua sat down opposite the Temple treasury and watched the crowd as they put money into the offering-boxes . Many rich people put in large sums ,
CJB	Mark	12	42	but a poor widow came and put in two small coins .
CJB	Mark	12	43	He called his talmidim to him and said to them , “ Yes ! I tell you , this poor widow has put more in the offering-box than all the others making donations .
CJB	Mark	12	44	For all of them , out of their wealth , have contributed money they can easily spare ; but she , out of her poverty , has given everything she had to live on. ” Footnotes - Mark 12:11 Psalm 118:22–23 - Mark 12:19 Deuteronomy 25:5–6 - Mark 12:26 Exodus 3:6 - Mark 12:30 Deuteronomy 6:4–5 - Mark 12:31 Leviticus 19:18 - Mark 12:36 Psalm 110:1
CJB	Mark	13	13	and everyone will hate you because of me . But whoever holds out till the end will be delivered .
CJB	Mark	13	2	“ You see all these great buildings ? ” Yeshua said to him , “ They will be totally destroyed — not a single stone will be left standing ! ”
CJB	Mark	13	3	As he was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the Temple , Kefa , Ya ‘ akov , Yochanan and Andrew asked him privately ,
CJB	Mark	13	4	“ Tell us , when will these things happen ? And what sign will show when all these things are about to be accomplished ? ”
CJB	Mark	13	5	Yeshua began speaking to them : “ Watch out ! Don ’ t let anyone fool you !
CJB	Mark	13	6	Many will come in my name , saying , ‘ I am he ! ’ and they will fool many people .
CJB	Mark	13	7	When you hear the noise of wars nearby and the news of wars far off , don ’ t become frightened . Such things must happen , but the end is yet to come .
CJB	Mark	13	8	For peoples will fight each other , and nations will fight each other , there will be earthquakes in various places , there will be famines ; this is but the beginning of the ‘ birth pains. ’
CJB	Mark	13	9	“ But you , watch yourselves ! They will hand you over to the local Sanhedrins , you will be beaten up in synagogues , and on my account you will stand before governors and kings as witnesses to them .
CJB	Mark	13	10	Indeed , the Good News has to be proclaimed first to all the Goyim .
CJB	Mark	13	11	Now when they arrest you and bring you to trial , don ’ t worry beforehand about what to say . Rather , say whatever is given you when the time comes ; for it will not be just you speaking , but the Ruach HaKodesh .
CJB	Mark	13	12	Brother will betray brother to death , and a father his child ; children will turn against their parents and have them put to death ;
CJB	Mark	13	14	“ Now when you see the abomination that causes devastation [ a ] standing where it ought not to be ” ( let the reader understand the allusion ) , “ that will be the time for those in Y ’ hudah to escape to the hills .
CJB	Mark	13	15	If someone is on the roof , he must not go down and enter his house to take any of his belongings ;
CJB	Mark	13	16	if someone is in the field , he must not turn back to get his coat .
CJB	Mark	13	17	What a terrible time it will be for pregnant women and nursing mothers !
CJB	Mark	13	18	Pray that it may not happen in winter .
CJB	Mark	13	19	For there will be worse trouble at that time than there has ever been from the very beginning , when God created the universe , until now ; and there will be nothing like it again . [ b ]
CJB	Mark	13	20	Indeed , if God had not limited the duration of the trouble , no one would survive ; but for the sake of the elect , those whom he has chosen , he has limited it .
CJB	Mark	13	21	- Mark 13:26 Daniel 7:13–14
CJB	Mark	13	22	There will appear false Messiahs and false prophets performing signs and wonders for the purpose , if possible , of misleading the chosen .
CJB	Mark	13	23	But you , watch out ! I have told you everything in advance !
CJB	Mark	13	24	In those days , after that trouble , the sun will grow dark , the moon will stop shining ,
CJB	Mark	13	25	the stars will fall from the sky , and the powers in heaven will be shaken . [ c ]
CJB	Mark	13	26	Then they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with tremendous power and glory . [ d ]
CJB	Mark	13	27	He will send out his angels and gather together his chosen people from the four winds , from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven .
CJB	Mark	13	28	“ Now let the fig tree teach you its lesson : when its branches begin to sprout and leaves appear , you know that summer is approaching .
CJB	Mark	13	29	In the same way , when you see all these things happening , you are to know that the time is near , right at the door .
CJB	Mark	13	30	Yes ! I tell you that this people will certainly not pass away before all these things happen .
CJB	Mark	13	31	Heaven and earth will pass away , but my words will certainly not pass away .
CJB	Mark	13	32	However , when that day and hour will come , no one knows — not the angels in heaven , not the Son , just the Father .
CJB	Mark	13	33	Stay alert ! Be on your guard ! For you do not know when the time will come .
CJB	Mark	13	34	“ It ’ s like a man who travels away from home , puts his servants in charge , each with his own task , and tells the doorkeeper to stay alert .
CJB	Mark	13	35	So stay alert ! for you don ’ t know when the owner of the house will come ,
CJB	Mark	13	36	whether it will be evening , midnight , cockcrow or morning — you don ’ t want him to come suddenly and find you sleeping !
CJB	Mark	13	37	And what I say to you , I say to everyone : stay alert ! ” Footnotes - Mark 13:14 Daniel 9:27 ; 11:31 ; 12:11 - Mark 13:19 Joel 2:2 ; Daniel 12:1 - Mark 13:25 Isaiah 13:10 ; 34:4 ; Ezekiel 32:7 ; Joel 2:10 ; 3:4 ( 2:31 ) ; 4:15 ( 3:15 ) ; Haggai 2:6 ,
CJB	Mark	14	14	and whichever house he enters , tell him that the Rabbi says , ‘ Where is the guest room for me , where I am to eat the Pesach meal with my talmidim ? ’
CJB	Mark	14	2	for they said , “ Not during the festival , or the people will riot. ”
CJB	Mark	14	3	While he was in Beit-Anyah in the home of Shim ‘ on ( a man who had had tzara ‘ at ) , and as he was eating , a woman came with an alabaster jar of perfume , pure oil of nard , very costly . She broke the jar and poured the perfume over Yeshua ’ s head .
CJB	Mark	14	4	But some there angrily said to themselves , “ Why this waste of perfume ?
CJB	Mark	14	5	It could have been sold for a year ’ s wages and given to the poor ! ” And they scolded her .
CJB	Mark	14	6	But he said , “ Let her be . Why are you bothering her ? She has done a beautiful thing for me .
CJB	Mark	14	7	For you will always have the poor with you ; and whenever you want to , you can help them . But you will not always have me .
CJB	Mark	14	8	What she could do , she did do — in advance she poured perfume on my body to prepare it for burial .
CJB	Mark	14	9	Yes ! I tell you that wherever in the whole world this Good News is proclaimed , what she has done will be told in her memory. ”
CJB	Mark	14	10	Then Y ’ hudah from K ’ riot , who was one of the Twelve , went to the head cohanim in order to betray Yeshua to them .
CJB	Mark	14	11	They were pleased to hear this and promised to give him money . And he began looking for a good opportunity to betray Yeshua .
CJB	Mark	14	12	On the first day for matzah , when they slaughtered the lamb for Pesach , Yeshua ’ s talmidim asked him , “ Where do you want us to go and prepare your Seder ? ”
CJB	Mark	14	13	He sent two of his talmidim with these instructions : “ Go into the city , and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you . Follow him ;
CJB	Mark	14	15	He will show you a large room upstairs , furnished and ready . Make the preparations there. ”
CJB	Mark	14	16	The talmidim went off , came to the city and found things just as he had told them they would be ; and they prepared the Seder .
CJB	Mark	14	17	When evening came , Yeshua arrived with the Twelve .
CJB	Mark	14	18	As they were reclining and eating , Yeshua said , “ Yes ! I tell you that one of you is going to betray me. ”
CJB	Mark	14	19	They became upset and began asking him , one after the other , “ You don ’ t mean me , do you ? ”
CJB	Mark	14	20	“ It ’ s one of the Twelve , ” he said to them , “ someone dipping matzah in the dish with me .
CJB	Mark	14	21	For the Son of Man will die , just as the Tanakh says he will ; but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed ! It would have been better for him had he never been born ! ”
CJB	Mark	14	22	While they were eating , Yeshua took a piece of matzah , made the b ’ rakhah , broke it , gave it to them and said , “ Take it ! This is my body. ”
CJB	Mark	14	23	Also he took a cup of wine , made the b ’ rakhah , and gave it to them ; and they all drank .
CJB	Mark	14	24	He said to them , “ This is my blood , which ratifies the New Covenant , my blood shed on behalf of many people .
CJB	Mark	14	25	Yes ! I tell you , I will not drink this ‘ fruit of the vine ’ again until the day I drink new wine in the Kingdom of God. ”
CJB	Mark	14	26	After singing the Hallel , they went out to the Mount of Olives .
CJB	Mark	14	27	Yeshua said to them , “ You will all lose faith in me , for the Tanakh says , ‘ I will strike the shepherd dead , and the sheep will be scattered. ’ [ a ]
CJB	Mark	14	28	But after I have been raised , I will go ahead of you into the Galil. ”
CJB	Mark	14	29	Kefa said to him , “ Even if everyone else loses faith in you , I won ’ t. ”
CJB	Mark	14	30	Yeshua replied , “ Yes ! I tell you that this very night , before the rooster crows twice , you will disown me three times ! ”
CJB	Mark	14	31	But Kefa kept insisting , “ Even if I must die with you , I will never disown you ! ” And they all said the same thing .
CJB	Mark	14	32	They went to a place called Gat Sh ’ manim ; and Yeshua said to his talmidim , “ Sit here while I pray. ”
CJB	Mark	14	33	He took with him Kefa , Ya ‘ akov and Yochanan . Great distress and anguish came over him ;
CJB	Mark	14	34	and he said to them , “ My heart is so filled with sadness that I could die ! Remain here and stay awake. ”
CJB	Mark	14	35	Going on a little farther , he fell on the ground and prayed that if possible , the hour might pass from him :
CJB	Mark	14	36	“ Abba ! ” ( that is , “ Dear Father ! ” ) “ All things are possible for you . Take this cup away from me ! Still , not what I want , but what you want. ”
CJB	Mark	14	37	He came and found them sleeping ; and he said to Kefa , “ Shim ‘ on , are you asleep ? Couldn ’ t you stay awake one hour ?
CJB	Mark	14	38	Stay awake , and pray that you will not be put to the test — the spirit indeed is eager , but human nature is weak. ”
CJB	Mark	14	39	Again he went away and prayed , saying the same words ;
CJB	Mark	14	40	and again he came and found them sleeping , their eyes were so very heavy ; and they didn ’ t know what to answer him .
CJB	Mark	14	41	The third time , he came and said to them , “ For now , go on sleeping , take your rest . . . .There , that ’ s enough ! The time has come ! Look ! The Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners !
CJB	Mark	14	42	Get up ! Let ’ s go ! Here comes my betrayer ! ”
CJB	Mark	14	43	While Yeshua was still speaking , Y ’ hudah ( one of the Twelve ! ) came , and with him a crowd carrying swords and clubs , from the head cohanim , the Torah-teachers and the elders .
CJB	Mark	14	44	The betrayer had arranged to give them a signal : “ The man I kiss is the one you want . Grab him , and take him away under guard. ”
CJB	Mark	14	45	As he arrived , he went right up to Yeshua , said , “ Rabbi ! ” and kissed him .
CJB	Mark	14	46	Then they laid hold of Yeshua and arrested him ;
CJB	Mark	14	47	but one of the people standing nearby drew his sword and struck at the servant of the cohen hagadol , cutting off his ear .
CJB	Mark	14	48	Yeshua addressed them : “ So you came out to take me with swords and clubs , the way you would the leader of a rebellion ?
CJB	Mark	14	49	Every day I was with you in the Temple court , teaching , and you didn ’ t seize me then ! But let the Tanakh be fulfilled. ”
CJB	Mark	14	50	And they all deserted him and ran away .
CJB	Mark	14	51	There was one young man who did try to follow him ; but he was wearing only a nightshirt ; and when they tried to seize him ,
CJB	Mark	14	52	he slipped out of the nightshirt and ran away naked .
CJB	Mark	14	53	They led Yeshua to the cohen hagadol , with whom all the head cohanim , elders and Torah-teachers were assembling .
CJB	Mark	14	54	Kefa followed him at a distance right into the courtyard of the cohen hagadol , where he sat down with the guards and warmed himself by the fire .
CJB	Mark	14	55	The head cohanim and the whole Sanhedrin tried to find evidence against Yeshua , so that they might have him put to death , but they couldn ’ t find any .
CJB	Mark	14	56	For many people gave false evidence against him , but their testimonies didn ’ t agree .
CJB	Mark	14	57	Some stood up and gave this false testimony :
CJB	Mark	14	58	“ We heard him say , ‘ I will destroy this Temple made with hands ; and in three days I will build another one , not made with hands. ’ ”
CJB	Mark	14	59	Even so , their testimonies didn ’ t agree .
CJB	Mark	14	60	The cohen hagadol stood up in the front and asked Yeshua , “ Have you nothing to say to the accusations these men are making ? ”
CJB	Mark	14	61	But he remained silent and made no reply . Again the cohen hagadol questioned him : “ Are you the Mashiach , Ben-HaM ’ vorakh ? ”
CJB	Mark	14	62	“ I AM , ” answered Yeshua . “ Moreover , you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of HaG ’ vurah and coming on the clouds of heaven. ” [ b ]
CJB	Mark	14	63	At this , the cohen hagadol tore his clothes and said , “ Why do we still need witnesses ?
CJB	Mark	14	64	You heard him blaspheme ! What is your decision ? ” And they all declared him guilty and subject to the death penalty .
CJB	Mark	14	65	Then some began spitting at him ; and after blindfolding him , they started pounding him with their fists and saying to him , “ Let ’ s see you prophesy ! ” And as the guards took him , they beat him too .
CJB	Mark	14	66	Meanwhile , Kefa was still in the courtyard below . One of the serving-girls of the cohen hagadol
CJB	Mark	14	67	saw Kefa warming himself , took a look at him , and said , “ You were with the man from Natzeret , Yeshua ! ”
CJB	Mark	14	68	But he denied it , saying , “ I haven ’ t the faintest idea what you ’ re talking about ! ” He went outside into the entryway , and a rooster crowed .
CJB	Mark	14	69	The girl saw him there and started telling the bystanders , “ This fellow is one of them. ”
CJB	Mark	14	70	Again he denied it . A little later , the bystanders themselves said to Kefa , “ You must be one of them , because you ’ re from the Galil. ”
CJB	Mark	14	71	At this he began to invoke a curse on himself as he swore , “ I do not know this man you are telling me about ! ” —
CJB	Mark	14	72	and immediately the rooster crowed a second time . Then Kefa remembered what Yeshua had said to him , “ Before the rooster crows twice , you will disown me three times. ” And throwing himself down , he burst into tears .

CJB	Mark	15	15	So Pilate , wishing to satisfy the mob , set Bar-Abba free for them ; but he had Yeshua whipped and then handed him over to be executed on the stake .
CJB	Mark	15	2	Pilate put this question to him : “ Are you the King of the Jews ? ” He answered him , “ The words are yours. ”
CJB	Mark	15	3	The head cohanim too made accusations against him ,
CJB	Mark	15	4	and Pilate again inquired of him , “ Aren ’ t you going to answer ? Look how many charges they are making against you ! ”
CJB	Mark	15	5	But Yeshua made no further response , to Pilate ’ s amazement .
CJB	Mark	15	6	Now during a festival , Pilate used to set free one prisoner , whomever the crowd requested .
CJB	Mark	15	7	There was in prison among the rebels who had committed murder during the insurrection a man called Bar-Abba .
CJB	Mark	15	8	When the crowd came up and began asking Pilate to do for them what he usually did ,
CJB	Mark	15	9	he asked them , “ Do you want me to set free for you the ‘ King of the Jews ’ ? ”
CJB	Mark	15	10	For it was evident to him that it was out of jealousy that the head cohanim had handed him over .
CJB	Mark	15	11	But the head cohanim stirred up the crowd to have him release Bar-Abba for them instead .
CJB	Mark	15	12	Pilate again said to them , “ Then what should I do with the man you call the King of the Jews ? ”
CJB	Mark	15	13	They shouted back , “ Put him to death on the stake ! ”
CJB	Mark	15	14	He asked , “ Why ? What crime has he committed ? ” But they only shouted louder , “ Put him to death on the stake ! ”
CJB	Mark	15	16	The soldiers led him away inside the palace ( that is , the headquarters building ) and called together the whole battalion .
CJB	Mark	15	17	They dressed him in purple and wove thorn branches into a crown , which they put on him .
CJB	Mark	15	18	Then they began to salute him , “ Hail to the King of the Jews ! ”
CJB	Mark	15	19	They hit him on the head with a stick , spat on him and kneeled in mock worship of him .
CJB	Mark	15	20	When they had finished ridiculing him , they took off the purple robe , put his own clothes back on him and led him away to be nailed to the execution-stake .
CJB	Mark	15	21	)
CJB	Mark	15	22	They brought Yeshua to a place called Gulgolta ( which means “ place of a skull ” ) ,
CJB	Mark	15	23	and they gave him wine spiced with myrrh , but he didn ’ t take it .
CJB	Mark	15	24	Then they nailed him to the execution-stake ; and they divided his clothes among themselves , throwing dice to determine what each man should get .
CJB	Mark	15	25	It was nine in the morning when they nailed him to the stake .
CJB	Mark	15	26	Over his head , the written notice of the charge against him read , THE KING OF THE JEWS
CJB	Mark	15	27	On execution-stakes with him they placed two robbers , one on his right and one on his left .
CJB	Mark	15	28	[ a ]
CJB	Mark	15	29	People passing by hurled insults at him , shaking their heads and saying , “ Aha ! So you can destroy the Temple , can you , and rebuild it in three days ?
CJB	Mark	15	30	Save yourself and come down from the stake ! ”
CJB	Mark	15	31	Likewise , the head cohanim and the Torah-teachers made fun of him , saying to each other , “ He saved others , but he can ’ t save himself ! ”
CJB	Mark	15	32	and , “ So he ’ s the Messiah , is he ? The King of Isra ’ el ? Let him come down now from the stake ! If we see that , then we ’ ll believe him ! ” Even the men nailed up with him insulted him .
CJB	Mark	15	33	At noon , darkness covered the whole Land until three o ’ clock in the afternoon .
CJB	Mark	15	34	At three , he uttered a loud cry , “ Elohi ! Elohi ! L ’ mah sh ’ vaktani ? ” ( which means , “ My God ! My God ! Why have you deserted me ? ” ) [ b ]
CJB	Mark	15	35	On hearing this , some of the bystanders said , “ Look ! He ’ s calling for Eliyahu ! ”
CJB	Mark	15	36	One ran and soaked a sponge in vinegar , put it on a stick and gave it to him to drink . [ c ] “ Wait ! ” he said , “ Let ’ s see if Eliyahu will come and take him down. ”
CJB	Mark	15	37	But Yeshua let out a loud cry and gave up his spirit .
CJB	Mark	15	38	And the parokhet in the Temple was torn in two from top to bottom .
CJB	Mark	15	39	When the Roman officer who stood facing him saw the way he gave up his spirit , he said , “ This man really was a son of God ! ”
CJB	Mark	15	40	There were women looking on from a distance ; among them were Miryam from Magdala , Miryam the mother of the younger Ya ‘ akov and of Yosi , and Shlomit .
CJB	Mark	15	41	These women had followed him and helped him when he was in the Galil . And many other women were there who had come up with him to Yerushalayim .
CJB	Mark	15	42	Since it was Preparation Day ( that is , the day before a Shabbat ) , as evening approached ,
CJB	Mark	15	43	Yosef of Ramatayim , a prominent member of the Sanhedrin who himself was also looking forward to the Kingdom of God , went boldly to Pilate and asked for Yeshua ’ s body .
CJB	Mark	15	44	Pilate was surprised to hear that he was already dead , so he summoned the officer and asked him if he had been dead awhile .
CJB	Mark	15	45	After he had gotten confirmation from the officer that Yeshua was dead , he granted Yosef the corpse .
CJB	Mark	15	46	Yosef purchased a linen sheet ; and after taking Yeshua down , he wrapped him in the linen sheet , laid him in a tomb which had been cut out of the rock , and rolled a stone against the entrance to the tomb .
CJB	Mark	15	47	Miryam of Magdala and Miryam the mother of Yosi saw where he had been laid . Footnotes - Mark 15:28 Some manuscripts include verse 15:28 : And the passage from the Tanakh was fulfilled which says , “ He was counted with transgressors. ” ( Isaiah 53:12 ) - Mark 15:34 Psalm 22:2 (
CJB	Mark	15	1	) - Mark 15:36 Psalm 69:22 (
CJB	Mark	16	16	Whoever trusts and is immersed will be saved ; whoever does not trust will be condemned .
CJB	Mark	16	2	Very early the next day , just after sunrise , they went to the tomb .
CJB	Mark	16	3	They were asking each other , “ Who will roll away the stone from the entrance to the tomb for us ? ”
CJB	Mark	16	4	Then they looked up and saw that the stone , even though it was huge , had been rolled back already .
CJB	Mark	16	5	On entering the tomb , they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right ; and they were dumbfounded .
CJB	Mark	16	6	But he said , “ Don ’ t be so surprised ! You ’ re looking for Yeshua from Natzeret , who was executed on the stake . He has risen , he ’ s not here ! Look at the place where they laid him .
CJB	Mark	16	7	But go and tell his talmidim , especially Kefa , that he is going to the Galil ahead of you . You will see him there , just as he told you. ”
CJB	Mark	16	8	Trembling but ecstatic they went out and fled from the tomb , and they said nothing to anyone , because they were afraid . [ a ]
CJB	Mark	16	9	When Yeshua rose early Sunday , he appeared first to Miryam of Magdala , from whom he had expelled seven demons .
CJB	Mark	16	10	She went and told those who had been with him , as they were crying and mourning .
CJB	Mark	16	11	But when they heard that he was alive and that she had seen him , they wouldn ’ t believe it .
CJB	Mark	16	12	After that , Yeshua appeared in another form to two of them as they were walking into the country .
CJB	Mark	16	13	They went and told the others , but they didn ’ t believe them either .
CJB	Mark	16	14	Later , Yeshua appeared to the Eleven as they were eating , and he reproached them for their lack of trust and their spiritual insensitivity in not having believed those who had seen him after he had risen .
CJB	Mark	16	15	Then he said to them , “ As you go throughout the world , proclaim the Good News to all creation .
CJB	Mark	16	17	And these signs will accompany those who do trust : in my name they will drive out demons , speak with new tongues ,
CJB	Mark	16	18	not be injured if they handle snakes or drink poison , and heal the sick by laying hands on them. ”
CJB	Mark	16	19	So then , after he had spoken to them , the Lord Yeshua was taken up into heaven and sat at the right hand of God . [ b ]
CJB	Mark	16	20	And they went out and proclaimed everywhere , the Lord working with them and confirming the message by the accompanying signs . Footnotes - Mark 16:9 Verses 9–20 are found in many ancient Greek manuscripts but not in the two oldest ones . - Mark 16:19 Psalm 110:1
CJB	Luke	1	1	Dear Theophilos : Concerning the matters that have taken place among us , many people have undertaken to draw up accounts
CJB	Luke	1	2	based on what was handed down to us by those who from the start were eyewitnesses and proclaimers of the message .
CJB	Luke	1	3	Therefore , Your Excellency , since I have carefully investigated all these things from the beginning , it seemed good to me that I too should write you an accurate and ordered narrative ,
CJB	Luke	1	4	so that you might know how well-founded are the things about which you have been taught .
CJB	Luke	1	5	In the days of Herod , King of Y ’ hudah , there was a cohen named Z ’ kharyah who belonged to the Aviyah division . His wife was a descendant of Aharon , and her name was Elisheva .
CJB	Luke	1	6	Both of them were righteous before God , observing all the mitzvot and ordinances of Adonai blamelessly .
CJB	Luke	1	7	But they had no children , because Elisheva was barren ; and they were both well along in years .
CJB	Luke	1	8	One time , when Z ’ kharyah was fulfilling his duties as cohen during his division ’ s period of service before God ,
CJB	Luke	1	9	he was chosen by lot ( according to the custom among the cohanim ) to enter the Temple and burn incense .
CJB	Luke	1	10	All the people were outside , praying , at the time of the incense burning ,
CJB	Luke	1	11	when there appeared to him an angel of Adonai standing to the right of the incense altar .
CJB	Luke	1	12	Z ’ kharyah was startled and terrified at the sight .
CJB	Luke	1	13	But the angel said to him , “ Don ’ t be afraid , Z ’ kharyah ; because your prayer has been heard . Your wife Elisheva will bear you a son , and you are to name him Yochanan .
CJB	Luke	1	14	He will be a joy and a delight to you , and many people will rejoice when he is born ,
CJB	Luke	1	15	for he will be great in the sight of Adonai . He is never to drink wine or other liquor , and he will be filled with the Ruach HaKodesh even from his mother ’ s womb .
CJB	Luke	1	16	He will turn many of the people of Isra ’ el to Adonai their God .
CJB	Luke	1	17	He will go out ahead of Adonai in the spirit and power of Eliyahu to turn the hearts of fathers to their children [ a ] and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous , to make ready for Adonai a people prepared. ”
CJB	Luke	1	18	Z ’ kharyah said to the angel , “ How can I be sure of this ? For I am an old man ; my wife too is well on in years. ”
CJB	Luke	1	19	“ I am Gavri ’ el , ” the angel answered him , “ and I stand in the presence of God . I was sent to speak to you , to give you this good news .
CJB	Luke	1	20	Now , because you didn ’ t believe what I said , which will be fulfilled when the time comes , you will be silent , unable to speak until the day these things take place. ”
CJB	Luke	1	21	Meanwhile , the people were waiting for Z ’ kharyah ; they were surprised at his taking so long in the Temple .
CJB	Luke	1	22	But when he came out unable to talk to them , they realized that he had seen a vision in the Temple ; speechless , he communicated to them with signs .
CJB	Luke	1	23	When his period of his Temple service was over , he returned home .
CJB	Luke	1	24	Following this , Elisheva his wife conceived , and she remained five months in seclusion , saying ,
CJB	Luke	1	25	“ Adonai has done this for me ; he has shown me favor at this time , so as to remove my public disgrace. ”
CJB	Luke	1	26	In the sixth month , the angel Gavri ’ el was sent by God to a city in the Galil called Natzeret ,
CJB	Luke	1	27	to a virgin engaged to a man named Yosef , of the house of David ; the virgin ’ s name was Miryam .
CJB	Luke	1	28	Approaching her , the angel said , “ Shalom , favored lady ! Adonai is with you ! ”
CJB	Luke	1	29	She was deeply troubled by his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be .
CJB	Luke	1	30	The angel said to her , “ Don ’ t be afraid , Miryam , for you have found favor with God .
CJB	Luke	1	31	Look ! You will become pregnant , you will give birth to a son , and you are to name him Yeshua .
CJB	Luke	1	32	He will be great , he will be called Son of Ha ‘ Elyon . Adonai , God , will give him the throne of his forefather David ;
CJB	Luke	1	33	and he will rule the House of Ya ‘ akov forever — there will be no end to his Kingdom. ”
CJB	Luke	1	34	“ How can this be , ” asked Miryam of the angel , “ since I am a virgin ? ”
CJB	Luke	1	35	The angel answered her , “ The Ruach HaKodesh will come over you , the power of Ha ‘ Elyon will cover you . Therefore the holy child born to you will be called the Son of God .
CJB	Luke	1	36	“ You have a relative , Elisheva , who is an old woman ; and everyone says she is barren . But she has conceived a son and is six months pregnant !
CJB	Luke	1	37	For with God , nothing is impossible. ”
CJB	Luke	1	38	Miryam said , “ I am the servant of Adonai ; may it happen to me as you have said. ” Then the angel left her .
CJB	Luke	1	39	Without delay , Miryam set out and hurried to the town in the hill country of Y ’ hudah
CJB	Luke	1	40	where Z ’ kharyah lived , entered his house and greeted Elisheva .
CJB	Luke	1	41	When Elisheva heard Miryam ’ s greeting , the baby in her womb stirred . Elisheva was filled with the Ruach HaKodesh
CJB	Luke	1	42	and spoke up in a loud voice , “ How blessed are you among women ! And how blessed is the child in your womb !
CJB	Luke	1	43	“ But who am I , that the mother of my Lord should come to me ?
CJB	Luke	1	44	For as soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears , the baby in my womb leaped for joy !
CJB	Luke	1	45	Indeed you are blessed , because you have trusted that the promise Adonai has made to you will be fulfilled. ”
CJB	Luke	1	46	Then Miryam said , “ My soul magnifies Adonai ;
CJB	Luke	1	47	and my spirit rejoices in God , my Savior ,
CJB	Luke	1	48	who has taken notice of his servant-girl in her humble position . [ b ] For — imagine it ! — from now on , all generations will call me blessed !
CJB	Luke	1	49	“ The Mighty One has done great things for me ! Indeed , his name is holy ;
CJB	Luke	1	50	and in every generation he has mercy on those who fear him . [ c ]
CJB	Luke	1	51	“ He has performed mighty deeds with his arm , routed the secretly proud ,
CJB	Luke	1	52	brought down rulers from their thrones , raised up the humble ,
CJB	Luke	1	53	filled the hungry with good things , but sent the rich away empty .
CJB	Luke	1	54	“ He has taken the part of his servant Isra ’ el , mindful of the mercy
CJB	Luke	1	55	which he promised to our fathers , to Avraham and his seed forever. ”
CJB	Luke	1	56	Miryam stayed with Elisheva for about three months and then returned home .
CJB	Luke	1	57	The time arrived for Elisheva to have her baby , and she gave birth to a son .
CJB	Luke	1	58	Her neighbors and relatives heard how good Adonai had been to her , and they rejoiced with her .
CJB	Luke	1	59	On the eighth day , they came to do the child ’ s b ’ rit-milah . They were about to name him Z ’ kharyah , after his father ,
CJB	Luke	1	60	when his mother spoke up and said , “ No , he is to be called Yochanan. ”
CJB	Luke	1	61	They said to her , “ None of your relatives has that name , ”
CJB	Luke	1	62	and they made signs to his father to find out what he wanted him called .
CJB	Luke	1	63	He motioned for a writing tablet , and to everyone ’ s surprise he wrote , “ His name is Yochanan. ”
CJB	Luke	1	64	At that moment , his power of speech returned , and his first words were a b ’ rakhah to God .
CJB	Luke	1	65	All their neighbors were awestruck ; and throughout the hill country of Y ’ hudah , people talked about all these things .
CJB	Luke	1	66	Everyone who heard of them said to himself , “ What is this child going to be ? ” For clearly the hand of Adonai was with him .
CJB	Luke	1	67	His father Z ’ kharyah was filled with the Ruach HaKodesh and spoke this prophecy :
CJB	Luke	1	68	“ Praised be Adonai , the God of Isra ’ el , [ d ] because he has visited and made a ransom to liberate his people
CJB	Luke	1	69	by raising up for us a mighty Deliverer who is a descendant of his servant David .
CJB	Luke	1	70	It is just as he has spoken through the mouth of the prophets from the very beginning —
CJB	Luke	1	71	that we should be delivered from our enemies and from the power of all who hate us .
CJB	Luke	1	72	“ This has happened so that he might show the mercy promised to our fathers — that he would remember his holy covenant ,
CJB	Luke	1	73	the oath he swore before Avraham avinu
CJB	Luke	1	74	to grant us that we , freed from our enemies , would serve him without fear ,
CJB	Luke	1	75	in holiness and righteousness before him all our days .
CJB	Luke	1	76	You , child , will be called a prophet of Ha ‘ Elyon ; you will go before the Lord to prepare his way [ e ]
CJB	Luke	1	77	by spreading the knowledge among his people that deliverance comes by having sins forgiven
CJB	Luke	1	78	through our God ’ s most tender mercy , which causes the Sunrise to visit us from Heaven ,
CJB	Luke	1	79	to shine on those in darkness , living in the shadow of death , [ f ] and to guide our feet into the paths of peace. ”
CJB	Luke	1	80	The child grew and became strong in spirit , and he lived in the wilderness until the time came for him to appear in public to Isra ’ el .
CJB	Luke	2	2	This registration , the first of its kind , took place when Quirinius was governing in Syria .
CJB	Luke	2	3	Everyone went to be registered , each to his own town .
CJB	Luke	2	4	So Yosef , because he was a descendant of David , went up from the town of Natzeret in the Galil to the town of David , called Beit-Lechem , in Y ’ hudah ,
CJB	Luke	2	5	to be registered , with Miryam , to whom he was engaged , and who was pregnant .
CJB	Luke	2	6	While they were there , the time came for her to give birth ;
CJB	Luke	2	7	and she gave birth to her first child , a son . She wrapped him in cloth and laid him down in a feeding trough , because there was no space for them in the living-quarters .
CJB	Luke	2	8	In the countryside nearby were some shepherds spending the night in the fields , guarding their flocks ,
CJB	Luke	2	9	when an angel of Adonai appeared to them , and the Sh ’ khinah of Adonai shone around them . They were terrified ;
CJB	Luke	2	10	but the angel said to them , “ Don ’ t be afraid , because I am here announcing to you Good News that will bring great joy to all the people .
CJB	Luke	2	11	This very day , in the town of David , there was born for you a Deliverer who is the Messiah , the Lord .
CJB	Luke	2	12	Here is how you will know : you will find a baby wrapped in cloth and lying in a feeding trough. ”
CJB	Luke	2	13	Suddenly , along with the angel was a vast army from heaven praising God :
CJB	Luke	2	14	“ In the highest heaven , glory to God ! And on earth , peace among people of good will ! ”
CJB	Luke	2	15	No sooner had the angels left them and gone back into heaven than the shepherds said to one another , “ Let ’ s go over to Beit-Lechem and see this thing that has happened , that Adonai has told us about. ”
CJB	Luke	2	16	Hurrying off , they came and found Miryam and Yosef , and the baby lying in the feeding trough .
CJB	Luke	2	17	Upon seeing this , they made known what they had been told about this child ;
CJB	Luke	2	18	and all who heard were amazed by what the shepherds said to them .
CJB	Luke	2	19	Miryam treasured all these things and kept mulling them over in her heart .
CJB	Luke	2	20	Meanwhile , the shepherds returned , glorifying and praising God for everything they had heard and seen ; it had been just as they had been told .
CJB	Luke	2	21	On the eighth day , when it was time for his b ’ rit-milah , he was given the name Yeshua , which is what the angel had called him before his conception .
CJB	Luke	2	22	When the time came for their purification according to the Torah of Moshe , they took him up to Yerushalayim to present him to Adonai
CJB	Luke	2	23	( as it is written in the Torah of Adonai , “ Every firstborn male is to be consecrated to Adonai ” [ a ] )
CJB	Luke	2	24	and also to offer a sacrifice of a pair of doves or two young pigeons , [ b ] as required by the Torah of Adonai .
CJB	Luke	2	25	There was in Yerushalayim a man named Shim ‘ on . This man was a tzaddik , he was devout , he waited eagerly for God to comfort Isra ’ el , and the Ruach HaKodesh was upon him .
CJB	Luke	2	26	It had been revealed to him by the Ruach HaKodesh that he would not die before he had seen the Messiah of Adonai .
CJB	Luke	2	27	Prompted by the Spirit , he went into the Temple courts ; and when the parents brought in the child Yeshua to do for him what the Torah required ,
CJB	Luke	2	28	Shim ‘ on took him in his arms , made a b ’ rakhah to God , and said ,
CJB	Luke	2	29	“ Now , Adonai , according to your word , your servant is at peace as you let him go ;
CJB	Luke	2	30	for I have seen with my own eyes your yeshu ‘ ah ,
CJB	Luke	2	31	which you prepared in the presence of all peoples —
CJB	Luke	2	32	a light that will bring revelation to the Goyim and glory to your people Isra ’ el. ”
CJB	Luke	2	33	Yeshua ’ s father and mother were marvelling at the things Shim ‘ on was saying about him .
CJB	Luke	2	34	Shim ‘ on blessed them and said to the child ’ s mother , Miryam , “ This child will cause many in Isra ’ el to fall and to rise , he will become a sign whom people will speak against ;
CJB	Luke	2	35	moreover , a sword will pierce your own heart too . All this will happen in order to reveal many people ’ s inmost thoughts. ”
CJB	Luke	2	36	There was also a prophet named Hannah Bat-P ’ nu ’ el , of the tribe of Asher . She was a very old woman — she had lived with her husband seven years after her marriage
CJB	Luke	2	37	and had remained a widow ever since ; now she was eighty-four . She never left the Temple grounds but worshipped there night and day , fasting and praying .
CJB	Luke	2	38	She came by at that moment and began thanking God and speaking about the child to everyone who was waiting for Yerushalayim to be liberated .
CJB	Luke	2	39	When Yosef and Miryam had finished doing everything required by the Torah of Adonai , they returned to the Galil , to their town Natzeret .
CJB	Luke	2	40	The child grew and became strong and filled with wisdom — God ’ s favor was upon him .
CJB	Luke	2	41	Every year Yeshua ’ s parents went to Yerushalayim for the festival of Pesach .
CJB	Luke	2	42	When he was twelve years old , they went up for the festival , as custom required .
CJB	Luke	2	43	But after the festival was over , when his parents returned , Yeshua remained in Yerushalayim . They didn ’ t realize this ;
CJB	Luke	2	44	supposing that he was somewhere in the caravan , they spent a whole day on the road before they began searching for him among their relatives and friends .
CJB	Luke	2	45	Failing to find him , they returned to Yerushalayim to look for him .
CJB	Luke	2	46	On the third day they found him — he was sitting in the Temple court among the rabbis , not only listening to them but questioning what they said ;
CJB	Luke	2	47	and everyone who heard him was astonished at his insight and his responses .
CJB	Luke	2	48	When his parents saw him , they were shocked ; and his mother said to him , “ Son ! Why have you done this to us ? Your father and I have been terribly worried looking for you ! ”
CJB	Luke	2	49	He said to them , “ Why did you have to look for me ? Didn ’ t you know that I had to be concerning myself with my Father ’ s affairs ? ”
CJB	Luke	2	50	But they didn ’ t understand what he meant .
CJB	Luke	2	51	So he went with them to Natzeret and was obedient to them . But his mother stored up all these things in her heart .
CJB	Luke	2	52	And Yeshua grew both in wisdom and in stature , gaining favor both with other people and with God .
CJB	Luke	3	3	He went all through the Yarden region proclaiming an immersion involving turning to God from sin in order to be forgiven .
CJB	Luke	3	2	with ‘ Anan and Kayafa being the cohanim g ’ dolim ; the word of God came to Yochanan Ben-Z ’ kharyah in the desert .
CJB	Luke	3	4	It was just as had been written in the book of the sayings of the prophet Yesha ‘ yahu , “ The voice of someone crying out : ‘ In the desert prepare the way for Adonai ! Make straight paths for him !
CJB	Luke	3	5	Every valley must be filled in , every mountain and hill leveled off ; the winding roads must be straightened and the rough ways made smooth .
CJB	Luke	3	6	Then all humanity will see God ’ s deliverance. ’ ” [ a ]
CJB	Luke	3	7	Therefore , Yochanan said to the crowds who came out to be immersed by him , “ You snakes ! Who warned you to escape the coming punishment ?
CJB	Luke	3	8	If you have really turned from your sins , produce fruit that will prove it ! And don ’ t start saying to yourselves , ‘ Avraham is our father ’ ! For I tell you that God can raise up for Avraham sons from these stones !
CJB	Luke	3	9	Already the axe is at the root of the trees , ready to strike ; every tree that doesn ’ t produce good fruit will be chopped down and thrown in the fire ! ”
CJB	Luke	3	10	The crowds asked Yochanan , “ So then , what should we do ? ”
CJB	Luke	3	11	He answered , “ Whoever has two coats should share with somebody who has none , and whoever has food should do the same. ”
CJB	Luke	3	12	Tax-collectors also came to be immersed ; and they asked him , “ Rabbi , what should we do ? ”
CJB	Luke	3	13	“ Collect no more than the government assesses , ” he told them .
CJB	Luke	3	14	Some soldiers asked him , “ What about us ? What should we do ? ” To them he said , “ Don ’ t intimidate anyone , don ’ t accuse people falsely , and be satisfied with your pay. ”
CJB	Luke	3	15	The people were in a state of great expectancy , and everyone was wondering whether perhaps Yochanan himself might be the Messiah ;
CJB	Luke	3	16	so Yochanan answered them all , “ I am immersing you in water , but he who is coming is more powerful than I — I ’ m not worthy to untie his sandals ! He will immerse you in the Ruach HaKodesh and in fire .
CJB	Luke	3	17	He has with him his winnowing fork to clear out his threshing floor and gather his wheat into his barn , but he will burn up the straw with unquenchable fire ! ”
CJB	Luke	3	18	And with many other warnings besides these he announced the Good News to the people .
CJB	Luke	3	19	But Yochanan also denounced Herod the regional governor for taking as his own wife Herodias , the wife of his brother , and for all the other wicked things Herod had done ;
CJB	Luke	3	20	whereupon Herod added this to the rest : he locked up Yochanan in prison .
CJB	Luke	3	21	While all the people were being immersed , Yeshua too was immersed . As he was praying , heaven was opened ;
CJB	Luke	3	22	the Ruach HaKodesh came down on him in physical form like a dove ; and a voice came from heaven , “ You are my Son , whom I love ; I am well pleased with you. ”
CJB	Luke	3	23	Yeshua was about thirty years old when he began his public ministry . It was supposed that he was a son of Yosef who was of Eli ,
CJB	Luke	3	24	of Mattat , of Levi , of Malki , of Yannai , of Yosef ,
CJB	Luke	3	25	of Mattityahu , of Amotz , of Nachum , of Hesli , of Naggai ,
CJB	Luke	3	26	of Machat , of Mattityahu , of Shim ‘ i , of Yosef , of Yodah ,
CJB	Luke	3	27	of Yochanan , of Reisha , of Z ’ rubavel , of Sh ’ altiel , of Neri ,
CJB	Luke	3	28	of Malki , of Addi , of Kosam , of Elmadan , of Er ,
CJB	Luke	3	29	of Yeshua , of Eli ‘ ezer , of Yoram , of Mattat , of Levi ,

CJB	Luke	3	33	of Amminadav , of Admin , of Arni , of Hetzron , of Peretz , of Y ’ hudah ,
CJB	Luke	3	34	of Ya ‘ akov , of Yitz ’ chak , of Avraham , of Terach , of Nachor ,

CJB	Luke	3	37	of Metushelach , of Hanokh , of Yered , of Mahalal ’ el , of Keinan ,
CJB	Luke	3	38	of Enosh , of Shet , of Adam , of God . Footnotes - Luke 3:6 Isaiah 40:3–5
CJB	Luke	4	4	Yeshua answered him , “ The Tanakh says , ‘ Man does not live on bread alone. ’ ” [ a ]
CJB	Luke	4	2	for forty days of testing by the Adversary . During that time he ate nothing , and afterwards he was hungry .
CJB	Luke	4	3	The Adversary said to him , “ If you are the Son of God , order this stone to become bread. ”
CJB	Luke	4	5	The Adversary took him up , showed him in an instant all the kingdoms of the world ,
CJB	Luke	4	6	and said to him , “ I will give you all this power and glory . It has been handed over to me , and I can give it to whomever I choose .
CJB	Luke	4	7	So if you will worship me , it will all be yours. ”
CJB	Luke	4	8	Yeshua answered him , “ The Tanakh says , ‘ Worship Adonai your God and serve him only. ’ ” [ b ]
CJB	Luke	4	9	Then he took him to Yerushalayim , set him on the highest point of the Temple and said to him , “ If you are the Son of God , jump from here !
CJB	Luke	4	10	For the Tanakh says , ‘ He will order his angels to be responsible for you and to protect you .
CJB	Luke	4	11	They will support you with their hands , so that you will not hurt your feet on the stones. ’ ” [ c ]
CJB	Luke	4	12	Yeshua answered him , “ It also says , ‘ Do not put Adonai your God to the test. ’ ” [ d ]
CJB	Luke	4	13	When the Adversary had ended all his testings , he let him alone until an opportune time .
CJB	Luke	4	14	Yeshua returned to the Galil in the power of the Spirit , and reports about him spread throughout the countryside .
CJB	Luke	4	15	He taught in their synagogues , and everyone respected him .
CJB	Luke	4	16	Now when he went to Natzeret , where he had been brought up , on Shabbat he went to the synagogue as usual . He stood up to read ,
CJB	Luke	4	17	and he was given the scroll of the prophet Yesha ‘ yahu . Unrolling the scroll , he found the place where it was written ,
CJB	Luke	4	18	“ The Spirit of Adonai is upon me ; therefore he has anointed me to announce Good News to the poor ; he has sent me to proclaim freedom for the imprisoned and renewed sight for the blind , to release those who have been crushed ,
CJB	Luke	4	19	to proclaim a year of the favor of Adonai. ” [ e ]
CJB	Luke	4	20	After closing the scroll and returning it to the shammash , he sat down ; and the eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fixed on him .
CJB	Luke	4	21	He started to speak to them : “ Today , as you heard it read , this passage of the Tanakh was fulfilled ! ”
CJB	Luke	4	22	Everyone was speaking well of him and marvelling that such appealing words were coming from his mouth . They were even asking , “ Can this be Yosef ’ s son ? ”
CJB	Luke	4	23	Then Yeshua said to them , “ No doubt you will quote to me this proverb — ‘ “ Doctor , cure yourself ! ” We ’ ve heard about all the things that have been going on over in K ’ far-Nachum ; now do them here in your home town ! ’
CJB	Luke	4	24	Yes ! ” he said , “ I tell you that no prophet is accepted in his home town .
CJB	Luke	4	25	It ’ s true , I ’ m telling you — when Eliyahu was in Isra ’ el , and the sky was sealed off for three-and-a-half years , so that all the Land suffered a severe famine , there were many widows ;
CJB	Luke	4	26	but Eliyahu was sent to none of them , only to a widow in Tzarfat in the land of Tzidon .
CJB	Luke	4	27	Also there were many people with tzara ‘ at in Isra ’ el during the time of the prophet Elisha ; but not one of them was healed , only Na ‘ aman the Syrian. ”
CJB	Luke	4	28	On hearing this , everyone in the synagogue was filled with fury .
CJB	Luke	4	29	They rose up , drove him out of town and dragged him to the edge of the cliff on which their town was built , intending to throw him off .
CJB	Luke	4	30	But he walked right through the middle of the crowd and went away .
CJB	Luke	4	31	He went down to K ’ far-Nachum , a town in the Galil , and made a practice of teaching them on Shabbat .
CJB	Luke	4	32	They were amazed at the way he taught , because his word carried the ring of authority .
CJB	Luke	4	33	In the synagogue there was a man who had an unclean demonic spirit , who shouted in a loud voice ,
CJB	Luke	4	34	“ Yaah ! What do you want with us , Yeshua from Natzeret ? Have you come to destroy us ? I know who you are — the Holy One of God ! ”
CJB	Luke	4	35	But Yeshua rebuked it : “ Be quiet , and come out of him ! ” The demonic spirit threw the man down in the middle of the crowd and came out of him , having done him no harm .
CJB	Luke	4	36	They were all astounded and said to one another , “ What kind of teaching is this ? Why , he gives orders with power and authority to the unclean spirits , and they come out ! ”
CJB	Luke	4	37	And reports about him went out through the whole surrounding district .
CJB	Luke	4	38	Leaving the synagogue , he went to Shim ‘ on ’ s house . Shim ‘ on ’ s mother-in-law was suffering from a high fever , and they asked him to do something for her .
CJB	Luke	4	39	So , standing over her , he rebuked the fever ; and it left her . She immediately got up and began helping them .
CJB	Luke	4	40	After sunset , all those who had people sick with various diseases brought them to Yeshua , and he put his hands on each one of them and healed them ;
CJB	Luke	4	41	also demons came out of many , crying , “ You are the Son of God ! ” But , rebuking them , he did not permit them to say that they knew he was the Messiah .
CJB	Luke	4	42	When day had come , he left and went away to a lonely spot . The people looked for him , came to him and would have kept him from leaving them .
CJB	Luke	4	43	But he said to them , “ I must announce the Good News of the Kingdom of God to the other towns too — this is why I was sent. ”
CJB	Luke	4	44	He also spent time preaching in the synagogues of Y ’ hudah .
CJB	Luke	5	5	Shim ‘ on answered , “ We ’ ve worked hard all night long , Rabbi , and haven ’ t caught a thing ! But if you say so , I ’ ll let down the nets. ”
CJB	Luke	5	2	he noticed two boats pulled up on the beach , left there by the fishermen , who were cleaning their nets .
CJB	Luke	5	3	He got into one of the boats , the one belonging to Shim ‘ on , and asked him to put out a little way from shore . Then he sat down and taught the people from the boat .
CJB	Luke	5	4	When he had finished speaking , he said to Shim ‘ on , “ Put out into deep water , and let down your nets for a catch. ”
CJB	Luke	5	6	They did this and took in so many fish that their nets began to tear .
CJB	Luke	5	7	So they motioned to their partners in the other boat to come and help them ; and they came and filled both boats to the point of sinking .
CJB	Luke	5	8	When he saw this , Shim ‘ on Kefa fell at Yeshua ’ s knees and said , “ Get away from me , sir , because I ’ m a sinner ! ”
CJB	Luke	5	9	For astonishment had seized him and everyone with him at the catch of fish they had taken ,
CJB	Luke	5	10	and likewise both Ya ‘ akov and Yochanan , Shim ‘ on ’ s partners . “ Don ’ t be frightened , ” Yeshua said to Shim ‘ on , “ from now on you will be catching men — alive ! ”
CJB	Luke	5	11	And as soon as they had beached their boats , they left everything behind and followed him .
CJB	Luke	5	12	Once , when Yeshua was in one of the towns , there came a man completely covered with tzara ‘ at . On seeing Yeshua , he fell on his face and begged him , “ Sir , if you are willing , you can make me clean. ”
CJB	Luke	5	13	Yeshua reached out his hand and touched him , saying , “ I am willing ! Be cleansed ! ” Immediately the tzara ‘ at left him .
CJB	Luke	5	14	Then Yeshua warned him not to tell anyone . “ Instead , as a testimony to the people , go straight to the cohen and make an offering for your cleansing , as Moshe commanded. ”
CJB	Luke	5	15	But the news about Yeshua kept spreading all the more , so that huge crowds would gather to listen and be healed of their sicknesses .
CJB	Luke	5	16	However , he made a practice of withdrawing to remote places in order to pray .
CJB	Luke	5	17	One day when Yeshua was teaching , there were P ’ rushim and Torah-teachers present who had come from various villages in the Galil and Y ’ hudah , also from Yerushalayim ; and the power of Adonai was with him to heal the sick .
CJB	Luke	5	18	Some men came carrying a paralyzed man lying on a bed . They wanted to bring him inside and lay him in front of Yeshua ,
CJB	Luke	5	19	but they couldn ’ t find a way to get him in because of the crowd . So they went up onto the roof and lowered him on his mattress through the tiles into the middle of the gathering , right in front of Yeshua .
CJB	Luke	5	20	When Yeshua saw their trust , he said , “ Friend , your sins are forgiven you. ”
CJB	Luke	5	21	The Torah-teachers and the P ’ rushim began thinking , “ Who is this fellow that speaks such blasphemies ? Who can forgive sin except God ? ”
CJB	Luke	5	22	But Yeshua , knowing what they were thinking , answered , “ Why are you turning over such thoughts in your hearts ?
CJB	Luke	5	23	Which is easier to say ? ‘ Your sins are forgiven you ’ ? or ‘ Get up and walk ’ ?
CJB	Luke	5	24	But look ! I will prove to you that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins. ” He then said to the paralytic , “ I say to you : get up , pick up your mattress and go home ! ”
CJB	Luke	5	25	Immediately , in front of everyone , he stood up , picked up what he had been lying on , and went home praising God .
CJB	Luke	5	26	Amazement seized them all , and they made a b ’ rakhah to God ; they were awestruck , saying , “ We have seen extraordinary things today. ”
CJB	Luke	5	27	Later Yeshua went out and saw a tax-collector named Levi sitting in his tax-collection booth ; and he said to him , “ Follow me ! ”
CJB	Luke	5	28	He got up , left everything and followed him .
CJB	Luke	5	29	Levi gave a banquet at his house in Yeshua ’ s honor , and there was a large group of tax-collectors and others at the table with them .
CJB	Luke	5	30	The P ’ rushim and their Torah-teachers protested indignantly against his talmidim , saying , “ Why do you eat and drink with tax-collectors and sinners ? ”
CJB	Luke	5	31	It was Yeshua who answered them : “ The ones who need a doctor aren ’ t the healthy but the sick .
CJB	Luke	5	32	I have not come to call the ‘ righteous , ’ but rather to call sinners to turn to God from their sins. ”
CJB	Luke	5	33	Next they said to him , “ Yochanan ’ s talmidim are always fasting and davvening , and likewise the talmidim of the P ’ rushim ; but yours go on eating and drinking. ”
CJB	Luke	5	34	Yeshua said to them , “ Can you make wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is still with them ?
CJB	Luke	5	35	The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them ; and when that time comes , they will fast. ”
CJB	Luke	5	36	Then he gave them an illustration : “ No one tears a piece from a new coat and puts it on an old one ; if he does , not only will the new one continue to rip , but the piece from the new will not match the old .
CJB	Luke	5	37	Also , no one puts new wine into old wineskins ; if he does , the new wine will burst the skins and be spilled , and the skins too will be ruined .
CJB	Luke	5	38	On the contrary , new wine must be put into freshly prepared wineskins .
CJB	Luke	5	39	Besides that , after drinking old wine , people don ’ t want new ; because they say , ‘ The old is good enough . ’ ”
CJB	Luke	6	6	On another Shabbat , when Yeshua had gone into the synagogue and was teaching , a man was there who had a shriveled hand .
CJB	Luke	6	2	Some of the P ’ rushim said , “ Why are you violating Shabbat ? ”
CJB	Luke	6	3	Yeshua answered them , “ Haven ’ t you ever read what David did when he and his companions were hungry ?
CJB	Luke	6	4	He entered the House of God and took and ate the Bread of the Presence ” — which no one is permitted to eat but the cohanim .
CJB	Luke	6	5	“ The Son of Man , ” he concluded , “ is Lord of Shabbat. ”
CJB	Luke	6	7	The Torah-teachers and P ’ rushim watched Yeshua carefully to see if he would heal on Shabbat , so that they could accuse him of something .
CJB	Luke	6	8	But he knew what they were thinking and said to the man with the shriveled hand , “ Come up and stand where we can see you ! ” He got up and stood there .
CJB	Luke	6	9	Then Yeshua said to them , “ I ask you now : what is permitted on Shabbat ? Doing good or doing evil ? Saving life or destroying it ? ”
CJB	Luke	6	10	Then , after looking around at all of them , he said to the man , “ Hold out your hand. ” As he held it out , his hand was restored .
CJB	Luke	6	11	But the others were filled with fury and began discussing with each other what they could do to Yeshua .
CJB	Luke	6	12	It was around that time that Yeshua went out to the hill country to pray , and all night he continued in prayer to God .
CJB	Luke	6	13	When day came , he called his talmidim and chose from among them twelve to be known as emissaries :
CJB	Luke	6	14	Shim ‘ on , whom he named Kefa ; Andrew , his brother ; Ya ‘ akov ; Yochanan ; Philip ; Bar-Talmai ;
CJB	Luke	6	15	Mattityahu ; T ’ oma ; Ya ‘ akov Ben-Halfai ;
CJB	Luke	6	16	Shim ‘ on , the one called the Zealot ; Y ’ hudah Ben-Ya ‘ akov ; and Y ’ hudah from K ’ riot , who turned traitor .
CJB	Luke	6	17	Then he came down with them and stood on a level place . A large crowd of his talmidim was there with great numbers of people from all Y ’ hudah , Yerushalayim and the coast around Tzor and Tzidon ; they had come to hear him and be healed of their diseases .
CJB	Luke	6	18	Those who were troubled with unclean spirits were being healed ;
CJB	Luke	6	19	and the whole crowd was trying to touch him , because power kept going out from him , healing everyone .
CJB	Luke	6	20	He looked at his talmidim and said : “ How blessed are you poor ! for the Kingdom of God is yours .
CJB	Luke	6	21	“ How blessed are you who are hungry ! for you will be filled . “ How blessed are you who are crying now ! for you will laugh .
CJB	Luke	6	22	“ How blessed you are whenever people hate you and ostracize you and insult you and denounce you as a criminal on account of the Son of Man .
CJB	Luke	6	23	Be glad when that happens ; yes , dance for joy ! because in heaven your reward is great . For that is just how their fathers treated the prophets .
CJB	Luke	6	24	“ But woe to you who are rich , for you have already had all the comfort you will get !
CJB	Luke	6	25	“ Woe to you who are full now , for you will go hungry ! “ Woe to you who are laughing now , for you will mourn and cry !
CJB	Luke	6	26	“ Woe to you when people speak well of you , for that is just how their fathers treated the false prophets !
CJB	Luke	6	27	Nevertheless , to you who are listening , what I say is this : “ Love your enemies ! Do good to those who hate you ,
CJB	Luke	6	28	bless those who curse you , pray for those who mistreat you .
CJB	Luke	6	29	“ If someone hits you on one cheek , offer the other too ; if someone takes your coat , let him have your shirt as well .
CJB	Luke	6	30	“ If someone asks you for something , give it to him ; if someone takes what belongs to you , don ’ t demand it back .
CJB	Luke	6	31	“ Treat other people as you would like them to treat you .
CJB	Luke	6	32	What credit is it to you if you love only those who love you ? Why , even sinners love those who love them .
CJB	Luke	6	33	What credit is it to you if you do good only to those who do good to you ? Even sinners do that .
CJB	Luke	6	34	What credit is it to you if you lend only to those who you expect will pay you back ? Even sinners lend to each other , expecting to be repaid in full .
CJB	Luke	6	35	But love your enemies , do good , and lend expecting nothing back ! Your reward will be great , and you will be children of Ha ‘ Elyon ; for he is kind to the ungrateful and the wicked .
CJB	Luke	6	36	Show compassion , just as your Father shows compassion .
CJB	Luke	6	37	“ Don ’ t judge , and you won ’ t be judged . Don ’ t condemn , and you won ’ t be condemned . “ Forgive , and you will be forgiven .
CJB	Luke	6	38	Give , and you will receive gifts — the full measure , compacted , shaken together and overflowing , will be put right in your lap . For the measure with which you measure out will be used to measure back to you ! ”
CJB	Luke	6	39	He also told them a parable : “ Can one blind man lead another blind man ? Won ’ t they both fall into a pit ?
CJB	Luke	6	40	A talmid is not above his rabbi ; but each one , when he is fully trained , will be like his rabbi .
CJB	Luke	6	41	So why do you see the splinter in your brother ’ s eye , but not notice the log in your own eye ?
CJB	Luke	6	42	How can you say to your brother , ‘ Brother , let me remove the splinter from your eye , ’ when you yourself don ’ t see the log in your own eye ? You hypocrite ! First take the log out of your own eye ; then you will see clearly , so that you can remove the splinter from your brother ’ s eye !
CJB	Luke	6	43	“ For no good tree produces bad fruit , nor does a bad tree produce good fruit .
CJB	Luke	6	44	Each tree is recognized by its own fruit — figs aren ’ t picked from thorn bushes , nor grapes from a briar patch .
CJB	Luke	6	45	The good person produces good things from the store of good in his heart , while the evil person produces evil things from the store of evil in his heart . For his mouth speaks what overflows from his heart .
CJB	Luke	6	46	“ Why do you call me , ‘ Lord ! Lord ! ’ but not do what I say ?
CJB	Luke	6	47	Everyone who comes to me , hears my words and acts on them — I will show you what he is like :
CJB	Luke	6	48	he is like someone building a house who dug deep and laid the foundation on bedrock . When a flood came , the torrent beat against that house but couldn ’ t shake it , because it was constructed well .
CJB	Luke	6	49	And whoever hears my words but doesn ’ t act on them is like someone who built his house on the ground without any foundation . As soon as the river struck it , it collapsed and that house became a horrendous wreck ! ”
CJB	Luke	7	7	this is why I didn ’ t presume to approach you myself . Instead , just give a command and let my servant recover .
CJB	Luke	7	2	A Roman army officer there had a servant he regarded highly , who was sick to the point of death .
CJB	Luke	7	3	Hearing about Yeshua , the officer sent some Jewish elders to him with the request that he come and heal his servant .
CJB	Luke	7	4	They came to Yeshua and pleaded earnestly with him , “ He really deserves to have you do this ,
CJB	Luke	7	5	for he loves our people — in fact , he built the synagogue for us ! ”
CJB	Luke	7	6	So Yeshua went with them . He had not gone far from the house , when the officer sent friends who said to him , “ Sir , don ’ t trouble yourself . I ’ m not worthy to have you come under my roof —
CJB	Luke	7	8	For I too am a man set under authority . I have soldiers under me ; and I say to this one , ‘ Go ! ’ and he goes ; and to another , ‘ Come ! ’ and he comes ; and to my slave , ‘ Do this ! ’ and he does it. ”
CJB	Luke	7	9	Yeshua was astonished at him when he heard this ; and he turned and said to the crowd following him , “ I tell you , not even in Isra ’ el have I found such trust ! ”
CJB	Luke	7	10	When the messengers got back to the officer ’ s house , they found the servant in good health .
CJB	Luke	7	11	The next day Yeshua , accompanied by his talmidim and a large crowd , went to a town called Na ‘ im .
CJB	Luke	7	12	As he approached the town gate , a dead man was being carried out for burial . His mother was a widow , this had been her only son , and a sizeable crowd from the town was with her .
CJB	Luke	7	13	When the Lord saw her , he felt compassion for her and said to her , “ Don ’ t cry. ”
CJB	Luke	7	14	Then he came close and touched the coffin , and the pallbearers halted . He said , “ Young man , I say to you : get up ! ”
CJB	Luke	7	15	The dead man sat up and began to speak , and Yeshua gave him to his mother . [ a ]
CJB	Luke	7	16	They were all filled with awe and gave glory to God , saying , “ A great prophet has appeared among us , ” and , “ God has come to help his people. ”
CJB	Luke	7	17	This report about him spread throughout all Y ’ hudah and the surrounding countryside .
CJB	Luke	7	18	Yochanan ’ s talmidim informed him of all these things . Then Yochanan called two of his talmidim
CJB	Luke	7	19	and sent them to the Lord to ask , “ Are you the one who is to come ? Or should we look for someone else ? ”
CJB	Luke	7	20	When the men came to him , they said , “ Yochanan the Immerser has sent us to you to ask , ‘ Are you the one who is to come ? Or should we keep looking — for someone else ? ’ ”
CJB	Luke	7	21	Right then he was healing many people of diseases , pains and evil spirits , and giving sight to many who were blind .
CJB	Luke	7	22	So he answered them by saying , “ Go , tell Yochanan what you have been seeing and hearing : the blind are seeing again , the lame are walking , people with tzara ‘ at are being cleansed , the deaf are hearing , the dead are being raised , the Good News is being told to the poor [ b ] —
CJB	Luke	7	23	and how blessed is anyone not offended by me ! ”
CJB	Luke	7	24	When the messengers from Yochanan had gone , Yeshua began speaking to the crowds about Yochanan : “ What did you go out into the desert to see ? Reeds swaying in the breeze ?
CJB	Luke	7	25	No ? then what did you go out to see ? Someone who was well dressed ? But people who dress beautifully and live in luxury are found in kings ’ palaces .
CJB	Luke	7	26	Nu , so what did you go out to see ? A prophet ! Yes , and I tell you he ’ s much more than a prophet .
CJB	Luke	7	27	This is the one about whom the Tanakh says , ‘ See , I am sending out my messenger ahead of you ; he will prepare your way before you. ’ [ c ]
CJB	Luke	7	28	I tell you that among those born of women there has not arisen anyone greater than Yochanan the Immerser ! Yet the one who is least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he ! ”
CJB	Luke	7	29	All the people who heard him , even the tax-collectors , by undergoing Yochanan ’ s immersion acknowledged that God was right ;
CJB	Luke	7	30	but the P ’ rushim and the Torah-teachers , by not letting themselves be immersed by him , nullified for themselves God ’ s plan .
CJB	Luke	7	31	“ Therefore , ” said the Lord , “ how can I describe the people of this generation ? What are they like ?
CJB	Luke	7	32	They are like children sitting in the marketplaces , calling to one another , ‘ We made happy music , but you wouldn ’ t dance ! We made sad music , but you wouldn ’ t cry ! ’
CJB	Luke	7	33	For Yochanan has come not eating bread and not drinking wine ; and you say , ‘ He has a demon ! ’
CJB	Luke	7	34	The Son of Man has come eating and drinking ; and you say , ‘ Aha ! A glutton and a drunkard ! A friend of tax-collectors and sinners ! ’
CJB	Luke	7	35	Well , the proof of wisdom is in all the kinds of people it produces. ”
CJB	Luke	7	36	One of the P ’ rushim invited Yeshua to eat with him , and he went into the home of the Parush and took his place at the table .
CJB	Luke	7	37	A woman who lived in that town , a sinner , who was aware that he was eating in the home of the Parush , brought an alabaster box of very expensive perfume ,
CJB	Luke	7	38	stood behind Yeshua at his feet and wept until her tears began to wet his feet . Then she wiped his feet with her own hair , kissed his feet and poured the perfume on them .
CJB	Luke	7	39	When the Parush who had invited him saw what was going on , he said to himself , “ If this man were really a prophet , he would have known who is touching him and what sort of woman she is , that she is a sinner. ”
CJB	Luke	7	40	Yeshua answered , “ Shim ‘ on , I have something to say to you. ” “ Say it , Rabbi , ” he replied .
CJB	Luke	7	41	“ A certain creditor had two debtors ; the one owed ten times as much as the other .
CJB	Luke	7	42	When they were unable to pay him back , he canceled both their debts . Now which of them will love him more ? ”
CJB	Luke	7	43	Shim ‘ on answered , “ I suppose the one for whom he canceled the larger debt. ” “ Your judgment is right , ” Yeshua said to him .
CJB	Luke	7	44	Then , turning to the woman , he said to Shim ‘ on , “ Do you see this woman ? I came into your house — you didn ’ t give me water for my feet , but this woman has washed my feet with her tears and dried them with her hair !
CJB	Luke	7	45	You didn ’ t give me a kiss ; but from the time I arrived , this woman has not stopped kissing my feet !
CJB	Luke	7	46	You didn ’ t put oil on my head , but this woman poured perfume on my feet !
CJB	Luke	7	47	Because of this , I tell you that her sins — which are many ! — have been forgiven , because she loved much . But someone who has been forgiven only a little loves only a little. ”
CJB	Luke	7	48	Then he said to her , “ Your sins have been forgiven. ”
CJB	Luke	7	49	At this , those eating with him began saying among themselves , “ Who is this fellow that presumes to forgive sins ? ”
CJB	Luke	7	50	But he said to the woman , “ Your trust has saved you ; go in peace . ”
CJB	Luke	8	8	But some fell into rich soil , and grew , and produced a hundred times as much as had been sown. ” After saying this , he called out , “ Whoever has ears to hear with , let him hear ! ”
CJB	Luke	8	2	and a number of women who had been healed from evil spirits and illnesses — Miryam ( called Magdalit ) , from whom seven demons had gone out ;
CJB	Luke	8	3	Yochanah the wife of Herod ’ s finance minister Kuza ; Shoshanah ; and many other women who drew on their own wealth to help him .
CJB	Luke	8	4	After a large crowd had gathered from the people who kept coming to him from town after town , Yeshua told this parable :
CJB	Luke	8	5	“ A farmer went out to sow his seed . As he sowed , some fell along the path and was stepped on , and the birds flying around ate it up .
CJB	Luke	8	6	Some fell on rock ; and after it sprouted , it dried up from lack of moisture .
CJB	Luke	8	7	Some fell in the midst of thorns , and the thorns grew up with it and choked it .
CJB	Luke	8	9	His talmidim asked him what this parable might mean ,
CJB	Luke	8	10	and he said , “ To you it has been given to know the secrets of the Kingdom of God ; but the rest are taught in parables , so that they may look but not see , and listen but not understand . [ a ]
CJB	Luke	8	11	“ The parable is this : the seed is God ’ s message .
CJB	Luke	8	12	The ones along the path are those who hear , but then the Adversary comes and takes the message out of their hearts , in order to keep them from being saved by trusting it .
CJB	Luke	8	13	The ones on rock are those who , when they hear the word , accept it with joy ; but these have no root — they go on trusting for awhile ; but when a time of testing comes , they apostatize .
CJB	Luke	8	14	As for what fell in the midst of thorns these are the ones who hear ; but as they go along , worries and wealth and life ’ s gratifications crowd in and choke them , so that their fruit never matures .
CJB	Luke	8	15	But what fell in rich soil — these are the ones who , when they hear the message , hold onto it with a good , receptive heart ; and by persevering , they bring forth a harvest .
CJB	Luke	8	16	“ No one who has lit a lamp covers it with a bowl or puts it under a bed ; no , he puts it on a stand ; so that those coming in may see the light .
CJB	Luke	8	17	For nothing is hidden that will not be disclosed , nothing is covered up that will not be known and come out into the open .
CJB	Luke	8	18	Pay attention , then , to how you hear ! For anyone who has something will be given more ; but from anyone who has nothing , even what he seems to have will be taken away. ”
CJB	Luke	8	19	Then Yeshua ’ s mother and brothers came to see him , but they couldn ’ t get near him because of the crowd .
CJB	Luke	8	20	It was reported to him , “ Your mother and your brothers are standing outside and want to see you. ”
CJB	Luke	8	21	But he gave them this answer : “ My mother and brothers are those who hear God ’ s message and act on it ! ”
CJB	Luke	8	22	One day Yeshua got into a boat with his talmidim and said to them , “ Let ’ s cross to the other side of the lake. ”
CJB	Luke	8	23	So they set out ; and as they were sailing , he fell asleep . A windstorm came down on the lake , so that the boat began to fill up with water , putting them in great danger .
CJB	Luke	8	24	They went and woke him , saying , “ Rabbi ! Rabbi ! We ’ re about to die ! ” He woke up , rebuked the wind and the rough water ; and they calmed down , so that it was still .
CJB	Luke	8	25	Then he said to the talmidim , “ Where is your trust ? ” Awestruck , they marveled , asking one another , “ Who can this be , that he commands even the wind and the water , and they obey him ? ”
CJB	Luke	8	26	They sailed on and landed in the region of the Gerasenes , which is opposite the Galil .
CJB	Luke	8	27	As Yeshua stepped ashore , a man from the town who had demons came to meet him . For a long time he had not worn clothes ; and he lived , not in a house , but in the burial caves .
CJB	Luke	8	28	Catching sight of Yeshua , he screamed , fell down in front of him and yelled , “ Yeshua ! Son of God Ha ‘ Elyon ! What do you want with me ? I beg you , don ’ t torture me ! ”
CJB	Luke	8	29	For Yeshua had ordered the unclean spirit to come out of the man . It had often taken hold of him — he had been kept under guard , chained hand and foot , but had broken the bonds and been driven by the demon into the desert .
CJB	Luke	8	30	Yeshua asked him , “ What is your name ? ” “ Legion , ” he said , because many demons had entered him .
CJB	Luke	8	31	They begged Yeshua not to order them to go off into the Bottomless Pit .
CJB	Luke	8	32	Now there was a herd of many pigs , feeding on the hill ; and the demons begged him to let them go into these . So he gave them permission .
CJB	Luke	8	33	The demons came out of the man and entered the pigs , whereupon the herd rushed down the hillside into the lake and were drowned .
CJB	Luke	8	34	When the swineherds saw what had happened , they fled and told it in the town and in the country ;
CJB	Luke	8	35	and the people came out to see for themselves . They came to Yeshua and found the man out of whom the demons had gone , sitting — dressed and in his right mind — at the feet of Yeshua ; and they were frightened .
CJB	Luke	8	36	Those who had seen it told how the formerly demonized man had been delivered .
CJB	Luke	8	37	Then all the people of the Gerasene district asked him to leave them , for they had been seized with great fear . So he boarded the boat and returned .
CJB	Luke	8	38	The man from whom the demons had gone out begged that he might go with him ; but Yeshua sent him away , saying ,
CJB	Luke	8	39	“ Go back to your home and tell how much God has done for you. ” He went away proclaiming throughout the whole town how much Yeshua had done for him .
CJB	Luke	8	40	When Yeshua got back , the crowd welcomed him ; for they were all expecting him .
CJB	Luke	8	41	Then there came a man named Ya ’ ir who was president of the synagogue . Falling at Yeshua ’ s feet , he pleaded with him to come to his house ;
CJB	Luke	8	42	for he had an only daughter , about twelve years old ; and she was dying . As he went , with the crowds on every side virtually choking him ,
CJB	Luke	8	43	a woman who had had a hemorrhage for twelve years , and could not be healed by anyone ,
CJB	Luke	8	44	came up behind him and touched the tzitzit on his robe ; instantly her hemorrhaging stopped .
CJB	Luke	8	45	Yeshua asked , “ Who touched me ? ” When they all denied doing it , Kefa said , “ Rabbi ! The crowds are hemming you in and jostling you ! ”
CJB	Luke	8	46	But Yeshua said , “ Someone did touch me , because I felt power go out of me. ”
CJB	Luke	8	47	Seeing she could not escape notice , the woman , quaking with fear , threw herself down before him and confessed in front of everyone why she had touched him and how she had been instantly healed .
CJB	Luke	8	48	He said to her , “ My daughter , your trust has saved you ; go in peace. ”
CJB	Luke	8	49	While Yeshua was still speaking , a man came from the synagogue president ’ s house . “ Your daughter has died , ” he said . “ Don ’ t bother the rabbi any more. ”
CJB	Luke	8	50	But on hearing this , Yeshua answered him , “ Don ’ t be afraid ! Just go on trusting , and she will be made well. ”
CJB	Luke	8	51	When he arrived at the house , he didn ’ t allow anyone to go in with him except Kefa , Yochanan , Ya ‘ akov and the child ’ s father and mother
CJB	Luke	8	52	All the people were wailing and mourning for her ; but he said , “ Don ’ t weep ; she hasn ’ t died , she ’ s sleeping. ”
CJB	Luke	8	53	They jeered at him , since they knew she had died .
CJB	Luke	8	54	But he took her by the hand , called out , “ Little girl , get up ! ”
CJB	Luke	8	55	and her spirit returned . She stood up at once , and he directed that something be given her to eat .
CJB	Luke	8	56	Her parents were astounded , but he instructed them to tell no one what had happened . Footnotes - Luke 8:10 Isaiah 6:9
CJB	Luke	9	9	Herod said , “ I had Yochanan beheaded , so who is this about whom I keep hearing such things ? ” And he began trying to see him .
CJB	Luke	9	2	and he sent them out to proclaim the Kingdom of God and to heal .
CJB	Luke	9	3	He said to them , “ Take nothing for your trip — neither a walking stick nor a pack , neither bread nor money ; and don ’ t have two shirts .
CJB	Luke	9	4	Whatever house you enter , stay there and go out from there .
CJB	Luke	9	5	Wherever they don ’ t welcome you , shake the dust from your feet when you leave that town as a warning to them. ”
CJB	Luke	9	6	They set out and went through village after village , healing and announcing the Good News everywhere .
CJB	Luke	9	7	Herod the governor heard about all that was going on and was perplexed , because it was said by some that Yochanan had been raised from the dead ,
CJB	Luke	9	8	by others that Eliyahu had appeared , and by others that one of the prophets of long ago had come back to life .
CJB	Luke	9	10	On their return , the emissaries detailed to Yeshua what they had done . Then , taking them with him , he withdrew by himself to a town called Beit-Tzaidah .
CJB	Luke	9	11	But the crowds found out and followed him . Welcoming them , he went on to speak to them about the Kingdom of God and to heal those who needed to be healed .
CJB	Luke	9	12	The day began to draw to a close . The Twelve came to him and said , “ Send the crowd away , so that they can go and get lodging and food in the towns and farms around here , because where we are is a remote place. ”
CJB	Luke	9	13	But he said to them , “ Give them something to eat , yourselves ! ” They said , “ We have no more than five loaves of bread and two fish — unless we ourselves are supposed to go and buy food for all these people ! ”
CJB	Luke	9	14	( For there were about five thousand men . ) He said to his talmidim , “ Make them sit down in groups of about fifty each. ”
CJB	Luke	9	15	They did what he told them and had them all sit down .
CJB	Luke	9	16	Then he took the five loaves and the two fish and , looking up toward heaven , made a b ’ rakhah , broke the loaves and began giving them to the talmidim to distribute to the crowd .
CJB	Luke	9	17	Everyone ate as much as he wanted ; and they took up what was left over , twelve baskets full of broken pieces .
CJB	Luke	9	18	Once when Yeshua was praying in private , his talmidim were with him ; and he asked them , “ Who are the crowds saying I am ? ”
CJB	Luke	9	19	They answered , “ Yochanan the Immerser ; but others say Eliyahu , and others that some prophet of long ago has risen. ”
CJB	Luke	9	20	“ But you , ” he said to them , “ who do you say I am ? ” Kefa answered , “ The Mashiach of God ! ”
CJB	Luke	9	21	However , he , warning them , ordered them to tell this to no one ,
CJB	Luke	9	22	adding , “ The Son of Man has to endure much suffering and be rejected by the elders , the head cohanim and the Torah-teachers ; and he has to be put to death ; but on the third day , he has to be raised to life. ”
CJB	Luke	9	23	Then to everyone he said , “ If anyone wants to come after me , let him say ‘ No ’ to himself , take up his execution-stake daily and keep following me .
CJB	Luke	9	24	For whoever tries to save his own life will destroy it , but whoever destroys his life on my account will save it .
CJB	Luke	9	25	What will it benefit a person if he gains the whole world but destroys or forfeits his own life ?
CJB	Luke	9	26	For if someone is ashamed of me and of what I say , the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his glory and that of the Father and of the holy angels .
CJB	Luke	9	27	I tell you the truth , there are some people standing here who will not experience death until they see the Kingdom of God. ”
CJB	Luke	9	28	About a week after Yeshua said these things , he took Kefa , Yochanan and Ya ‘ akov with him and went up to the hill country to pray .
CJB	Luke	9	29	As he was praying , the appearance of his face changed ; and his clothing became gleaming white .
CJB	Luke	9	30	Suddenly there were two men talking with him — Moshe and Eliyahu !
CJB	Luke	9	31	They appeared in glorious splendor and spoke of his exodus , which he was soon to accomplish in Yerushalayim .
CJB	Luke	9	32	Kefa and those with him had been sound asleep ; but on becoming fully awake , they saw his glory and the two men standing with him .
CJB	Luke	9	33	As the men were leaving Yeshua , Kefa said to him , not knowing what he was saying , “ It ’ s good that we ’ re here , Rabbi ! Let ’ s put up three shelters — one for you , one for Moshe and one for Eliyahu. ”
CJB	Luke	9	34	As he spoke , a cloud came and enveloped them . They were frightened as they entered the cloud ;
CJB	Luke	9	35	and a voice came out of the cloud , saying , “ This is my Son , whom I have chosen . Listen to him ! ”
CJB	Luke	9	36	When the voice spoke , Yeshua was alone once more . They kept quiet — at that time they told no one anything of what they had seen .
CJB	Luke	9	37	The next day , as they were coming down out of the hill country , a large crowd met him .
CJB	Luke	9	38	Suddenly a man in the crowd shouted , “ Rabbi ! Look at my son , I beg you , because he ’ s my only child !
CJB	Luke	9	39	What happens is this : a spirit seizes him , and suddenly it lets out a shriek and throws him into convulsions with foaming at the mouth ; and only with difficulty will it leave him . It ’ s destroying him !
CJB	Luke	9	40	I asked your talmidim to drive the spirit out , but they couldn ’ t. ”
CJB	Luke	9	41	“ Perverted people , without any trust ! ” Yeshua answered , “ How long do I have to be with you and put up with you ? Bring your son here. ”
CJB	Luke	9	42	Even as the boy was coming , the demon dashed him to the ground and threw him into a fit . But Yeshua rebuked the unclean spirit , healed the boy and gave him back to his father .
CJB	Luke	9	43	All were struck with amazement at the greatness of God . While they were all marvelling at everything Yeshua was doing , he said to his talmidim ,
CJB	Luke	9	44	“ Listen very carefully to what I ’ m going to say . The Son of Man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men. ”
CJB	Luke	9	45	But they didn ’ t understand what he meant by this . It had been concealed from them so that they would not grasp its meaning , and they were afraid to ask him about it .
CJB	Luke	9	46	An argument arose among the talmidim as to which of them might be the greatest .
CJB	Luke	9	47	But Yeshua , knowing the thoughts of their hearts , took a child , stood him beside himself ,
CJB	Luke	9	48	and said to them , “ Whoever welcomes this child in my name welcomes me , and whoever welcomes me welcomes the One who sent me . In other words , the one who is least among you all — this is the one who is great. ”
CJB	Luke	9	49	Yochanan responded , “ Rabbi , we saw someone expelling demons in your name ; and we stopped him because he doesn ’ t follow you along with us. ”
CJB	Luke	9	50	Yeshua said to him , “ Don ’ t stop such people , because whoever isn ’ t against you is for you. ”
CJB	Luke	9	51	As the time approached for him to be taken up into heaven , he made his decision to set out for Yerushalayim .
CJB	Luke	9	52	He sent messengers ahead of him , who went and entered a village in Shomron to make preparations for him .
CJB	Luke	9	53	However , the people there would not let him stay , because his destination was Yerushalayim .
CJB	Luke	9	54	When the talmidim Ya ‘ akov and Yochanan saw this , they said , “ Sir , do you want us to call down fire from heaven to destroy them ? ” [ a ]
CJB	Luke	9	55	But he turned and rebuked them . [ b ]
CJB	Luke	9	56	And they went on to another village .
CJB	Luke	9	57	As they were traveling on the road , a man said to him , “ I will follow you wherever you go. ”
CJB	Luke	9	58	Yeshua answered him , “ The foxes have holes , and the birds flying about have nests , but the Son of Man has no home of his own. ”
CJB	Luke	9	59	To another he said , “ Follow me ! ” but the man replied , “ Sir , first let me go away and bury my father. ”
CJB	Luke	9	60	Yeshua said , “ Let the dead bury their own dead ; you , go and proclaim the Kingdom of God ! ”
CJB	Luke	9	61	Yet another said , “ I will follow you , sir , but first let me say good-by to the people at home. ”
CJB	Luke	9	62	To him Yeshua said , “ No one who puts his hand to the plow and keeps looking back is fit to serve in the Kingdom of God . ”
CJB	Luke	10	10	But whenever you enter a town and they don ’ t make you welcome , go out into its streets and say ,
CJB	Luke	10	2	He said to them , “ To be sure , there is a large harvest . But there are few workers . Therefore , plead with the Lord of the Harvest that he speed workers out to gather in his harvest .
CJB	Luke	10	3	Get going now , but pay attention ! I am sending you out like lambs among wolves .
CJB	Luke	10	4	Don ’ t carry a money-belt or a pack , and don ’ t stop to shmoose with people on the road .
CJB	Luke	10	5	“ Whenever you enter a house , first say , ‘ Shalom ! ’ to the household .
CJB	Luke	10	6	If a seeker of shalom is there , your ‘ Shalom ! ’ will find its rest with him ; and if there isn ’ t , it will return to you .
CJB	Luke	10	7	Stay in that same house , eating and drinking what they offer , for a worker deserves his wages — don ’ t move about from house to house .
CJB	Luke	10	8	“ Whenever you come into a town where they make you welcome , eat what is put in front of you .
CJB	Luke	10	9	Heal the sick there , and tell them , ‘ The Kingdom of God is near you. ’
CJB	Luke	10	11	‘ Even the dust of your town that sticks to our feet we wipe off as a sign against you ! But understand this : the Kingdom of God is near ! ’
CJB	Luke	10	12	I tell you , it will be more tolerable on the Day of Judgment for S ’ dom than for that town .
CJB	Luke	10	13	“ Woe to you , Korazin ! Woe to you , Beit-Tzaidah ! For if the miracles done in you had been done in Tzor and Tzidon , they would long ago have put on sackcloth and ashes as evidence that they had changed their ways .
CJB	Luke	10	14	But at the Judgment it will be more bearable for Tzor and Tzidon than for you !
CJB	Luke	10	15	- Luke 10:27 Deuteronomy 6:5 ; Leviticus 19:18
CJB	Luke	10	16	“ Whoever listens to you listens to me , also whoever rejects you rejects me , and whoever rejects me rejects the One who sent me. ”
CJB	Luke	10	17	The seventy came back jubilant . “ Lord , ” they said , “ with your power , even the demons submit to us ! ”
CJB	Luke	10	18	Yeshua said to them , “ I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven .
CJB	Luke	10	19	Remember , I have given you authority ; so you can trample down snakes and scorpions , indeed , all the Enemy ’ s forces ; and you will remain completely unharmed .
CJB	Luke	10	20	Nevertheless , don ’ t be glad that the spirits submit to you ; be glad that your names have been recorded in heaven. ”
CJB	Luke	10	21	At that moment he was filled with joy by the Ruach HaKodesh and said , “ Father , Lord of heaven and earth , I thank you because you concealed these things from the sophisticated and educated , yet revealed them to ordinary people . Yes , Father , I thank you that it pleased you to do this .
CJB	Luke	10	22	“ My Father has handed over everything to me . Indeed , no one fully knows who the Son is except the Father , and who the Father is except the Son and those to whom the Son wishes to reveal him. ”
CJB	Luke	10	23	Then , turning to the talmidim , he said , privately , “ How blessed are the eyes that see what you are seeing !
CJB	Luke	10	24	Indeed , I tell you that many prophets and kings wanted to see the things you are seeing but did not see them , and to hear the things you are hearing but did not hear them. ”
CJB	Luke	10	25	An expert in Torah stood up to try and trap him by asking , “ Rabbi , what should I do to obtain eternal life ? ”
CJB	Luke	10	26	But Yeshua said to him , “ What is written in the Torah ? How do you read it ? ”
CJB	Luke	10	27	He answered , “ You are to love Adonai your God with all your heart , with all your soul , with all your strength and with all your understanding ; and your neighbor as yourself. ” [ b ]
CJB	Luke	10	28	“ That ’ s the right answer , ” Yeshua said . “ Do this , and you will have life. ”
CJB	Luke	10	29	But he , wanting to justify himself , said to Yeshua , “ And who is my ‘ neighbor ’ ? ”
CJB	Luke	10	30	Taking up the question , Yeshua said : “ A man was going down from Yerushalayim to Yericho when he was attacked by robbers . They stripped him naked and beat him up , then went off , leaving him half dead .
CJB	Luke	10	31	By coincidence , a cohen was going down on that road ; but when he saw him , he passed by on the other side .
CJB	Luke	10	32	Likewise a Levi who reached the place and saw him also passed by on the other side .
CJB	Luke	10	33	“ But a man from Shomron who was traveling came upon him ; and when he saw him , he was moved with compassion .
CJB	Luke	10	34	So he went up to him , put oil and wine on his wounds and bandaged them . Then he set him on his own donkey , brought him to an inn and took care of him .
CJB	Luke	10	35	The next day , he took out two days ’ wages , gave them to the innkeeper and said , ‘ Look after him ; and if you spend more than this , I ’ ll pay you back when I return. ’
CJB	Luke	10	36	Of these three , which one seems to you to have become the ‘ neighbor ’ of the man who fell among robbers ? ”
CJB	Luke	10	37	He answered , “ The one who showed mercy toward him. ” Yeshua said to him , “ You go and do as he did. ”
CJB	Luke	10	38	On their way Yeshua and his talmidim came to a village where a woman named Marta welcomed him into her home .
CJB	Luke	10	39	She had a sister called Miryam who also sat at the Lord ’ s feet and heard what he had to say .
CJB	Luke	10	40	But Marta was busy with all the work to be done ; so , going up to him , she said , “ Sir , don ’ t you care that my sister has been leaving me to do all the work by myself ? ”
CJB	Luke	10	41	However , the Lord answered her , “ Marta , Marta , you are fretting and worrying about so many things !
CJB	Luke	10	42	But there is only one thing that is essential . Miryam has chosen the right thing , and it won ’ t be taken away from her. ” Footnotes - Luke 10:15 Isaiah 14:13 ,
CJB	Luke	11	11	“ Is there any father here who , if his son asked him for a fish , would instead of a fish give him a snake ?
CJB	Luke	11	2	He said to them , “ When you pray , say : ‘ Father , May your name be kept holy . May your Kingdom come .
CJB	Luke	11	3	Give us each day the food we need .
CJB	Luke	11	4	Forgive us our sins , for we too forgive everyone who has wronged us . And do not lead us to hard testing. ’ ”
CJB	Luke	11	5	He also said to them , “ Suppose one of you has a friend ; and you go to him in the middle of the night and say to him , ‘ Friend , lend me three loaves of bread ,
CJB	Luke	11	6	because a friend of mine who has been travelling has just arrived at my house , and I have nothing for him to eat. ’
CJB	Luke	11	7	Now the one inside may answer , ‘ Don ’ t bother me ! The door is already shut , my children are with me in bed — I can ’ t get up to give you anything ! ’
CJB	Luke	11	8	But I tell you , even if he won ’ t get up because the man is his friend , yet because of the man ’ s hutzpah he will get up and give him as much as he needs .
CJB	Luke	11	9	“ Moreover , I myself say to you : keep asking , and it will be given to you ; keep seeking , and you will find ; keep knocking , and the door will be opened to you .
CJB	Luke	11	10	For everyone who goes on asking receives ; and he who goes on seeking finds ; and to him who continues knocking , the door will be opened .
CJB	Luke	11	12	or if he asked for an egg would give him a scorpion ?
CJB	Luke	11	13	So if you , even though you are bad , know how to give your children gifts that are good , how much more will the Father keep giving the Ruach HaKodesh from heaven to those who keep asking him ! ”
CJB	Luke	11	14	He was expelling a demon that was mute . When the demon had gone out , the man who had been mute spoke ; and the people were astounded .
CJB	Luke	11	15	But some of them said , “ It is by Ba ‘ al-Zibbul ” — the ruler of the demons — “ that he expels the demons. ”
CJB	Luke	11	16	And others , trying to trap him , demanded from him a sign from Heaven .
CJB	Luke	11	17	But he , knowing what they were thinking , said to them , “ Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined , with one house collapsing on another .
CJB	Luke	11	18	So if the Adversary too is divided against himself , how can his kingdom survive ? I ’ m asking because you claim it is by Ba ‘ al-Zibbul that I drive out the demons .
CJB	Luke	11	19	If I drive out demons by Ba ‘ al-Zibbul , by whom do your people drive them out ? So , they will be your judges !
CJB	Luke	11	20	But if I drive out demons by the finger of God , [ a ] then the Kingdom of God has come upon you !
CJB	Luke	11	21	“ When a strong man who is fully equipped for battle guards his own house , his possessions are secure .
CJB	Luke	11	22	But when someone stronger attacks and defeats him , he carries off all the armor and weaponry on which the man was depending , and divides up the spoils .
CJB	Luke	11	23	Those who are not with me are against me , and those who do not gather with me are scattering .
CJB	Luke	11	24	“ When an unclean spirit comes out of a person , it travels through dry country seeking rest . On finding none , it says , ‘ I will return to the house I left. ’
CJB	Luke	11	25	When it arrives , it finds the house swept clean and put in order .
CJB	Luke	11	26	Then it goes and takes seven other spirits more evil than itself , and they come and live there — so that in the end the person is worse off than he was before. ”
CJB	Luke	11	27	As Yeshua was saying these things , a woman in the crowd raised her voice to call out , “ How blessed is the mother that gave birth to you and nursed you from her breast ! ”
CJB	Luke	11	28	But he said , “ Far more blessed are those who hear the word of God and obey it ! ”
CJB	Luke	11	29	As the people crowded around him , Yeshua went on to say , “ This generation is a wicked generation ! It asks for a sign , but no sign will be given to it — except the sign of Yonah .
CJB	Luke	11	30	For just as Yonah became a sign to the people of Ninveh , so will the Son of Man be for this generation .
CJB	Luke	11	31	The Queen of the South will appear at the Judgment with the people of this generation and condemn them ; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Shlomo , and what is here now is greater than Shlomo .
CJB	Luke	11	32	The people of Ninveh will stand up at the Judgment with this generation and condemn it , for they turned to God from their sins when Yonah preached , and what is here now is greater than Yonah .
CJB	Luke	11	33	“ No one who has kindled a lamp hides it or places it under a bowl ; rather , he puts it on a stand , so that those coming in may see its light .
CJB	Luke	11	34	The lamp of your body is the eye . When you have a ‘ good eye , ’ [ that is , when you are generous , ] your whole body is full of light ; but when you have an ‘ evil eye , ’ [ when you are stingy , ] your body is full of darkness .
CJB	Luke	11	35	So take care that the light in you is not darkness !
CJB	Luke	11	36	If , then , your whole body is filled with light , with no part dark , it will be wholly lighted , as when a brightly lit lamp shines on you. ”
CJB	Luke	11	37	As Yeshua spoke , a Parush asked him to eat dinner with him ; so he went in and took his place at the table ;
CJB	Luke	11	38	and the Parush was surprised that he didn ’ t begin by doing n ’ tilat yadayim before the meal .
CJB	Luke	11	39	However , the Lord said to him , “ Now then , you P ’ rushim , you clean the outside of the cup and plate ; but inside , you are full of robbery and wickedness .
CJB	Luke	11	40	Fools ! Didn ’ t the One who made the outside make the inside too ?
CJB	Luke	11	41	Rather , give as alms what is inside , and then everything will be clean for you !
CJB	Luke	11	42	“ But woe to you P ’ rushim ! You pay your tithes of mint and rue and every garden herb , but you ignore justice and the love of God . You have an obligation to do these things — but without disregarding the others !
CJB	Luke	11	43	“ Woe to you P ’ rushim , because you love the best seat in the synagogues and being greeted deferentially in the marketplaces !
CJB	Luke	11	44	“ Woe to you , because you are like unmarked graves , which people walk over without knowing it. ”
CJB	Luke	11	45	One of the experts in Torah answered him , “ Rabbi , by saying these things you are insulting us also. ”
CJB	Luke	11	46	Yeshua said , “ Woe to you Torah experts too ! You load people down with burdens they can hardly bear , and you won ’ t lift a finger to help them !
CJB	Luke	11	47	“ Woe to you ! You build tombs in memory of the prophets , but your fathers murdered them !
CJB	Luke	11	48	Thus you testify that you completely approve of what your fathers did — they did the killing , you do the building !
CJB	Luke	11	49	Therefore the Wisdom of God said , ‘ I will send them prophets and emissaries ; they will kill some and persecute others ’ ;
CJB	Luke	11	50	so that on this generation will fall the responsibility for all the prophets ’ blood that has been shed since the world was established ,
CJB	Luke	11	51	from the blood of Hevel to the blood of Z ’ kharyah , who was killed between the altar and the Holy Place . Yes , I tell you , the responsibility for it will fall on this generation !
CJB	Luke	11	52	“ Woe to you Torah experts ! For you have taken away the key of knowledge ! Not only did you yourselves not go in , you also have stopped those who were trying to enter ! ”
CJB	Luke	11	53	As Yeshua left that place , the Torah-teachers and the P ’ rushim began to oppose him bitterly and to provoke him to express his views on all sorts of subjects ,
CJB	Luke	11	54	laying traps to catch him in something he might say . Footnotes - Luke 11:20 Exodus 31:18
CJB	Luke	12	12	because when the time comes , the Ruach HaKodesh will teach you what you need to say. ”
CJB	Luke	12	2	There is nothing covered up that will not be uncovered , or hidden that will not become known .
CJB	Luke	12	3	What you have spoken in the dark will be heard in the light , and what you have whispered behind closed doors will be proclaimed on the housetops .
CJB	Luke	12	4	“ My friends , I tell you : don ’ t fear those who kill the body but then have nothing more they can do .
CJB	Luke	12	5	I will show you whom to fear : fear him who after killing you has authority to throw you into Gei-Hinnom ! Yes , I tell you , this is the one to fear !
CJB	Luke	12	6	Aren ’ t sparrows sold for next to nothing , five for two assarions ? And not one of them has been forgotten by God .
CJB	Luke	12	7	Why , every hair on your head has been counted ! Don ’ t be afraid , you are worth more than many sparrows .
CJB	Luke	12	8	“ Moreover , I tell you , whoever acknowledges me in the presence of others , the Son of Man will also acknowledge in the presence of God ’ s angels .
CJB	Luke	12	9	But whoever disowns me before others will be disowned before God ’ s angels .
CJB	Luke	12	10	Also , everyone who says something against the Son of Man will have it forgiven him ; but whoever has blasphemed the Ruach HaKodesh will not be forgiven .
CJB	Luke	12	11	“ When they bring you before the synagogues and the ruling powers and the authorities , don ’ t worry about how you will defend yourself or what you will say ;
CJB	Luke	12	13	Someone in the crowd said to him , “ Rabbi , tell my brother to share with me the property we inherited. ”
CJB	Luke	12	14	But Yeshua answered him , “ My friend , who appointed me judge or arbitrator over you ? ”
CJB	Luke	12	15	Then to the people he said , “ Be careful to guard against all forms of greed , because even if someone is rich , his life does not consist in what he owns. ”
CJB	Luke	12	16	And he gave them this illustration : “ There was a man whose land was very productive .
CJB	Luke	12	17	He debated with himself , ‘ What should I do ? I haven ’ t enough room for all my crops. ’
CJB	Luke	12	18	Then he said , ‘ This is what I will do : I ’ ll tear down my barns and build bigger ones , and I ’ ll store all my wheat and other goods there .
CJB	Luke	12	19	Then I ’ ll say to myself , “ You ’ re a lucky man ! You have a big supply of goods laid up that will last many years . Start taking it easy ! Eat ! Drink ! Enjoy yourself ! ” ’
CJB	Luke	12	20	But God said to him , ‘ You fool ! This very night you will die ! And the things you prepared — whose will they be ? ’
CJB	Luke	12	21	That ’ s how it is with anyone who stores up wealth for himself without being rich toward God. ”
CJB	Luke	12	22	To his talmidim Yeshua said , “ Because of this I tell you , don ’ t worry about your life — what you will eat or drink ; or about your body — what you will wear .
CJB	Luke	12	23	For life is more than food , and the body is more than clothing .
CJB	Luke	12	24	Think about the ravens ! They neither plant nor harvest , they have neither storerooms nor barns , yet God feeds them . You are worth much more than the birds !
CJB	Luke	12	25	Can any of you by worrying add an hour to his life ?
CJB	Luke	12	26	If you can ’ t do a little thing like that , why worry about the rest ?
CJB	Luke	12	27	Think about the wild irises , and how they grow . They neither work nor spin thread ; yet , I tell you , not even Shlomo in all his glory was clothed as beautifully as one of these .
CJB	Luke	12	28	If this is how God clothes grass , which is alive in the field today and thrown in the oven tomorrow , how much more will he clothe you ! What little trust you have !
CJB	Luke	12	29	“ In other words , don ’ t strive after what you will eat and what you will drink — don ’ t be anxious .
CJB	Luke	12	30	For all the pagan nations in the world set their hearts on these things . Your Father knows that you need them too .
CJB	Luke	12	31	Rather , seek his Kingdom ; and these things will be given to you as well .
CJB	Luke	12	32	Have no fear , little flock , for your Father has resolved to give you the Kingdom !
CJB	Luke	12	33	Sell what you own and do tzedakah — make for yourselves purses that don ’ t wear out , riches in heaven that never fail , where no burglar comes near , where no moth destroys .
CJB	Luke	12	34	For where your wealth is , there your heart will be also .
CJB	Luke	12	35	“ Be dressed for action and have your lamps lit ,
CJB	Luke	12	36	like people waiting for their master ’ s return after a wedding feast ; so that when he comes and knocks , they will open the door for him without delay .
CJB	Luke	12	37	Happy the slaves whom the master finds alert when he comes ! Yes ! I tell you he will put on his work clothes , seat them at the table , and come serve them himself !
CJB	Luke	12	38	Whether it is late at night or early in the morning , if this is how he finds them , those slaves are happy .
CJB	Luke	12	39	“ But notice this : no house-owner would let his house be broken into if he knew when the thief was coming .
CJB	Luke	12	40	You too , be ready ! For the Son of Man will come when you are not expecting him. ”
CJB	Luke	12	41	Kefa said , “ Sir , are you telling this parable for our benefit only or for everyone ’ s ? ”
CJB	Luke	12	42	The Lord replied , “ Nu , who is the faithful and sensible manager whose master puts him in charge of the household staff to give them their share of food at the proper time ?
CJB	Luke	12	43	It will go well with that servant if he is found doing his job when his master comes .
CJB	Luke	12	44	Yes , I tell you he will put him in charge of all he owns .
CJB	Luke	12	45	But if that servant says to himself , ‘ My master is taking his time coming , ’ and starts bullying the men- and women-servants , and eating and drinking , getting drunk ,
CJB	Luke	12	46	then his master will come on a day when the servant isn ’ t expecting him , at a time he doesn ’ t know in advance ; his master will cut him in two and put him with the disloyal .
CJB	Luke	12	47	Now the servant who knew what his master wanted but didn ’ t prepare or act according to his will , will be whipped with many lashes ;
CJB	Luke	12	48	however , the one who did what deserves a beating , but didn ’ t know , will receive few lashes . From him who has been given much , much will be demanded — from someone to whom people entrust much , they ask still more .
CJB	Luke	12	49	“ I have come to set fire to the earth ! And how I wish it were already kindled !
CJB	Luke	12	50	I have an immersion to undergo — how pressured I feel till it ’ s over !
CJB	Luke	12	51	Do you think that I have come to bring peace in the Land ? Not peace , I tell you , but division !
CJB	Luke	12	52	For from now on , a household of five will be divided , three against two , two against three .
CJB	Luke	12	53	Father will be divided against son and son against father , mother against daughter and daughter against mother , mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law. ” [ a ]
CJB	Luke	12	54	Then to the crowds Yeshua said , “ When you see a cloud-bank rising in the west , at once you say that a rainstorm is coming ;
CJB	Luke	12	55	and when the wind is from the south , you say there will be a heat wave , and there is .
CJB	Luke	12	56	Hypocrites ! You know how to interpret the appearance of the earth and the sky — how is it that you don ’ t know how to interpret this present time ?
CJB	Luke	12	57	Why don ’ t you decide for yourselves what is the right course to follow ?
CJB	Luke	12	58	If someone brings a lawsuit against you , take pains to settle with him first ; otherwise he will take the matter to court , and the judge will turn you over to the bailiff , and the bailiff will throw you in jail .
CJB	Luke	12	59	I tell you , you won ’ t get out of there till you have paid the last penny ! ” Footnotes - Luke 12:53 Micah 7:6
CJB	Luke	13	13	He put his hands on her , and at once she stood upright and began to glorify God .
CJB	Luke	13	2	His answer to them was , “ Do you think that just because they died so horribly , these folks from the Galil were worse sinners than all the others from the Galil ?
CJB	Luke	13	3	No , I tell you . Rather , unless you turn to God from your sins , you will all die as they did !
CJB	Luke	13	4	“ Or what about those eighteen people who died when the tower at Shiloach fell on them ? Do you think they were worse offenders than all the other people living in Yerushalayim ?
CJB	Luke	13	5	No , I tell you . Rather , unless you turn from your sins , you will all die similarly. ”
CJB	Luke	13	6	Then Yeshua gave this illustration : “ A man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard , and he came looking for fruit but didn ’ t find any .
CJB	Luke	13	7	So he said to the man who took care of the vineyard , ‘ Here , I ’ ve come looking for fruit on this fig tree for three years now without finding any . Cut it down — why let it go on using up the soil ? ’
CJB	Luke	13	8	But he answered , ‘ Sir , leave it alone one more year . I ’ ll dig around it and put manure on it .
CJB	Luke	13	9	If it bears fruit next year , well and good ; if not , you will have it cut down then. ’ ”
CJB	Luke	13	10	Yeshua was teaching in one of the synagogues on Shabbat .
CJB	Luke	13	11	A woman came up who had a spirit which had crippled her for eighteen years ; she was bent double and unable to stand erect at all .
CJB	Luke	13	12	On seeing her , Yeshua called her and said to her , “ Lady , you have been set free from your weakness ! ”
CJB	Luke	13	14	But the president of the synagogue , indignant that Yeshua had healed on Shabbat , spoke up and said to the congregation , “ There are six days in the week for working ; so come during those days to be healed , not on Shabbat ! ”
CJB	Luke	13	15	However , the Lord answered him , “ You hypocrites ! Each one of you on Shabbat — don ’ t you unloose your ox or your donkey from the stall and lead him off to drink ?
CJB	Luke	13	16	This woman is a daughter of Avraham , and the Adversary kept her tied up for eighteen years ! Shouldn ’ t she be freed from this bondage on Shabbat ? ”
CJB	Luke	13	17	By these words , Yeshua put to shame the people who opposed him ; but the rest of the crowd were happy about all the wonderful things that were taking place through him .
CJB	Luke	13	18	So he went on to say , “ What is the Kingdom of God like ? With what will we compare it ?
CJB	Luke	13	19	It is like a mustard seed that a man took and planted in his own garden , and it grew and became a tree , and the birds flying about nested in its branches. ”
CJB	Luke	13	20	Again he said , “ With what will I compare the Kingdom of God ?
CJB	Luke	13	21	It is like yeast that a woman took and mixed with a bushel of flour , then waited until the whole batch of dough rose. ”
CJB	Luke	13	22	Yeshua continued traveling through town after town and village after village , teaching and making his way toward Yerushalayim .
CJB	Luke	13	23	Someone asked him , “ Are only a few people being saved ? ”
CJB	Luke	13	24	He answered , “ Struggle to get in through the narrow door , because — I ’ m telling you ! — many will be demanding to get in and won ’ t be able to ,
CJB	Luke	13	25	once the owner of the house has gotten up and shut the door . You will stand outside , knocking at the door and saying , ‘ Lord ! Open up for us ! ’ But he will answer , ‘ I don ’ t know you or where you come from ! ’
CJB	Luke	13	26	Then you will say , ‘ We ate and drank with you ! you taught in our streets ! ’
CJB	Luke	13	27	and he will tell you , ‘ I don ’ t know where you ’ re from . Get away from me , all you workers of wickedness ! ’
CJB	Luke	13	28	You will cry and grind your teeth when you see Avraham , Yitz ’ chak , Ya ‘ akov and all the prophets inside the Kingdom of God , but yourselves thrown outside .
CJB	Luke	13	29	Moreover , people will come from the east , the west , the north and the south to sit at table in the Kingdom of God .
CJB	Luke	13	30	And notice that some who are last will be first , and some who are first will be last. ”
CJB	Luke	13	31	Just at that moment , some P ’ rushim came up and said to Yeshua , “ Get out and go away from here , because Herod wants to kill you ! ”
CJB	Luke	13	32	He said to them , “ Go , tell that fox , ‘ Pay attention : today and tomorrow I am driving out demons and healing people , and on the third day I reach my goal. ’
CJB	Luke	13	33	Nevertheless , I must keep travelling today , tomorrow and the next day ; because it is unthinkable that a prophet should die anywhere but in Yerushalayim .
CJB	Luke	13	34	“ Yerushalayim ! Yerushalayim ! You kill the prophets ! You stone those who are sent to you ! How often I wanted to gather your children , just as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings , but you refused !
CJB	Luke	13	35	Look ! God is abandoning your house to you ! I tell you , you will not see me again until you say , ‘ Blessed is he who comes in the name of Adonai ! ’ ” [ a ] Footnotes - Luke 13:35 Psalm 118:26
CJB	Luke	14	14	How blessed you will be that they have nothing with which to repay you ! For you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous. ”
CJB	Luke	14	2	In front of him was a man whose body was swollen with fluid .
CJB	Luke	14	3	Yeshua spoke up and asked the Torah experts and P ’ rushim , “ Does the Torah allow healing on Shabbat or not ? ”
CJB	Luke	14	4	But they said nothing . So , taking hold of him , he healed him and sent him away .
CJB	Luke	14	5	To them he said , “ Which of you , if a son or an ox falls into a well , will hesitate to haul him out on Shabbat ? ”
CJB	Luke	14	6	And to these things they could give no answer .
CJB	Luke	14	7	When Yeshua noticed how the guests were choosing for themselves the best seats at the table , he told them this parable :
CJB	Luke	14	8	“ When you are invited by someone to a wedding feast , don ’ t sit down in the best seat ; because if there is someone more important than you who has been invited ,
CJB	Luke	14	9	the person who invited both of you might come and say to you , ‘ Give this man your place. ’ Then you will be humiliated as you go to take the least important place .
CJB	Luke	14	10	Instead , when you are invited , go and sit in the least important place ; so that when the one who invited you comes , he will say to you , ‘ Go on up to a better seat. ’ Then you will be honored in front of everyone sitting with you .
CJB	Luke	14	11	Because everyone who exalts himself will be humbled , but everyone who humbles himself will be exalted. ”
CJB	Luke	14	12	Yeshua also said to the one who had invited him , “ When you give a lunch or a dinner , don ’ t invite your friends , brothers , relatives or rich neighbors ; for they may well invite you in return , and that will be your repayment .
CJB	Luke	14	13	Instead , when you have a party , invite poor people , disfigured people , the crippled , the blind !
CJB	Luke	14	15	On hearing this , one of the people at the table with Yeshua said to him , “ How blessed are those who eat bread in the Kingdom of God ! ”
CJB	Luke	14	16	But he replied , “ Once a man gave a banquet and invited many people .
CJB	Luke	14	17	When the time came for the banquet , he sent his slave to tell those who had been invited , ‘ Come ! Everything is ready ! ’
CJB	Luke	14	18	But they responded with a chorus of excuses . The first said to him , ‘ I ’ ve just bought a field , and I have to go out and see it . Please accept my apologies. ’
CJB	Luke	14	19	Another said , ‘ I ’ ve just bought five yoke of oxen , and I ’ m on my way to test them out . Please accept my apologies. ’
CJB	Luke	14	20	Still another said , ‘ I have just gotten married , so I can ’ t come. ’
CJB	Luke	14	21	The slave came and reported these things to his master . “ Then the owner of the house , in a rage , told his slave , ‘ Quick , go out into the streets and alleys of the city ; and bring in the poor , the disfigured , the blind and the crippled ! ’
CJB	Luke	14	22	The slave said , ‘ Sir , what you ordered has been done , and there is still room. ’
CJB	Luke	14	23	The master said to the slave , ‘ Go out to the country roads and boundary walls , and insistently persuade people to come in , so that my house will be full .
CJB	Luke	14	24	I tell you , not one of those who were invited will get a taste of my banquet ! ’ ”
CJB	Luke	14	25	Large crowds were traveling along with Yeshua . Turning , he said to them ,
CJB	Luke	14	26	“ If anyone comes to me and does not hate his father , his mother , his wife , his children , his brothers and his sisters , yes , and his own life besides , he can not be my talmid .
CJB	Luke	14	27	Whoever does not carry his own execution-stake and come after me can not be my talmid .
CJB	Luke	14	28	“ Suppose one of you wants to build a tower . Don ’ t you sit down and estimate the cost , to see if you have enough capital to complete it ?
CJB	Luke	14	29	If you don ’ t , then when you have laid the foundation but can ’ t finish , all the onlookers start making fun of you
CJB	Luke	14	30	and say , ‘ This is the man who began to build , but couldn ’ t finish ! ’
CJB	Luke	14	31	“ Or again , suppose one king is going out to wage war with another king . Doesn ’ t he first sit down and consider whether he , with his ten thousand troops , has enough strength to meet the other one , who is coming against him with twenty thousand ?
CJB	Luke	14	32	If he hasn ’ t , then while the other is still far away , he sends a delegation to inquire about terms for peace .
CJB	Luke	14	33	“ So every one of you who doesn ’ t renounce all that he has can not be my talmid .
CJB	Luke	14	34	Salt is excellent . But if even the salt becomes tasteless , what can be used to season it ?
CJB	Luke	14	35	It is fit for neither soil nor manure — people throw it out . Those who have ears that can hear , let them hear ! ”
CJB	Luke	15	15	“ So he went and attached himself to one of the citizens of that country , who sent him into his fields to feed pigs .
CJB	Luke	15	2	and the P ’ rushim and Torah-teachers kept grumbling . “ This fellow , ” they said , “ welcomes sinners — he even eats with them ! ”
CJB	Luke	15	3	So he told them this parable :
CJB	Luke	15	4	“ If one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them , doesn ’ t he leave the other ninety-nine in the desert and go after the lost one until he finds it ?
CJB	Luke	15	5	When he does find it , he joyfully hoists it onto his shoulders ;
CJB	Luke	15	6	and when he gets home , he calls his friends and neighbors together and says , ‘ Come , celebrate with me , because I have found my lost sheep ! ’
CJB	Luke	15	7	I tell you that in the same way , there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who turns to God from his sins than over ninety-nine righteous people who have no need to repent .
CJB	Luke	15	8	“ Another example : what woman , if she has ten drachmas and loses one of these valuable coins , won ’ t light a lamp , sweep the house and search all over until she finds it ?
CJB	Luke	15	9	And when she does find it , she calls her friends and neighbors together and says , ‘ Come , celebrate with me , because I have found the drachma I lost. ’
CJB	Luke	15	10	In the same way , I tell you , there is joy among God ’ s angels when one sinner repents. ”
CJB	Luke	15	11	Again Yeshua said , “ A man had two sons .
CJB	Luke	15	12	The younger of them said to his father , ‘ Father , give me the share of the estate that will be mine. ’ So the father divided the property between them .
CJB	Luke	15	13	As soon as he could convert his share into cash , the younger son left home and went off to a distant country , where he squandered his money in reckless living .
CJB	Luke	15	14	But after he had spent it all , a severe famine arose throughout that country , and he began to feel the pinch .
CJB	Luke	15	16	He longed to fill his stomach with the carob pods the pigs were eating , but no one gave him any .
CJB	Luke	15	17	“ At last he came to his senses and said , ‘ Any number of my father ’ s hired workers have food to spare ; and here I am , starving to death !
CJB	Luke	15	18	I ’ m going to get up and go back to my father and say to him , “ Father , I have sinned against Heaven and against you ;
CJB	Luke	15	19	I am no longer worthy to be called your son ; treat me like one of your hired workers. ” ’
CJB	Luke	15	20	So he got up and started back to his father . “ But while he was still a long way off , his father saw him and was moved with pity . He ran and threw his arms around him and kissed him warmly .
CJB	Luke	15	21	His son said to him , ‘ Father , I have sinned against Heaven and against you ; I am no longer worthy to be called your son — ’
CJB	Luke	15	22	but his father said to his slaves , ‘ Quick , bring out a robe , the best one , and put it on him ; and put a ring on his finger and shoes on his feet ;
CJB	Luke	15	23	and bring the calf that has been fattened up , and kill it . Let ’ s eat and have a celebration !
CJB	Luke	15	24	For this son of mine was dead , but now he ’ s alive again ! He was lost , but now he has been found ! ’ And they began celebrating .
CJB	Luke	15	25	“ Now his older son was in the field . As he came close to the house , he heard music and dancing .
CJB	Luke	15	26	So he called one of the servants and asked , ‘ What ’ s going on ? ’
CJB	Luke	15	27	The servant told him , ‘ Your brother has come back , and your father has slaughtered the calf that was fattened up , because he has gotten him back safe and sound. ’
CJB	Luke	15	28	But the older son became angry and refused to go inside . “ So his father came out and pleaded with him .
CJB	Luke	15	29	‘ Look , ’ the son answered , ‘ I have worked for you all these years , and I have never disobeyed your orders . But you have never even given me a young goat , so that I could celebrate with my friends .
CJB	Luke	15	30	Yet this son of yours comes , who squandered your property with prostitutes , and for him you slaughter the fattened calf ! ’
CJB	Luke	15	31	‘ Son , you are always with me , ’ said the father , ‘ and everything I have is yours .
CJB	Luke	15	32	We had to celebrate and rejoice , because this brother of yours was dead but has come back to life — he was lost but has been found . ’ ”
CJB	Luke	16	16	Up to the time of Yochanan there were the Torah and the Prophets . Since then the Good News of the Kingdom of God has been proclaimed , and everyone is pushing to get in .
CJB	Luke	16	2	So he summoned him and asked him , ‘ What is this I hear about you ? Turn in your accounts , for you can no longer be manager. ’
CJB	Luke	16	3	“ ‘ What am I to do ? ’ said the manager to himself . ‘ My boss is firing me , I ’ m not strong enough to dig ditches , and I ’ m ashamed to go begging .
CJB	Luke	16	4	Aha ! I know what I ’ ll do — something that will make people welcome me into their homes after I ’ ve lost my job here ! ’
CJB	Luke	16	5	“ So , after making appointments with each of his employer ’ s debtors , he said to the first , ‘ How much do you owe my boss ? ’
CJB	Luke	16	6	‘ Eight hundred gallons of olive oil , ’ he replied . ‘ Take your note back , ’ he told him . ‘ Now , quickly ! Sit down and write one for four hundred ! ’
CJB	Luke	16	7	To the next he said , ‘ And you , how much do you owe ? ’ ‘ A thousand bushels of wheat , ’ he replied . ‘ Take your note back and write one for eight hundred. ’
CJB	Luke	16	8	“ And the employer of this dishonest manager applauded him for acting so shrewdly ! For the worldly have more sekhel than those who have received the light — in dealing with their own kind of people !
CJB	Luke	16	9	“ Now what I say to you is this : use worldly wealth to make friends for yourselves , so that when it gives out , you may be welcomed into the eternal home .
CJB	Luke	16	10	Someone who is trustworthy in a small matter is also trustworthy in large ones , and someone who is dishonest in a small matter is also dishonest in large ones .
CJB	Luke	16	11	So if you haven ’ t been trustworthy in handling worldly wealth , who is going to trust you with the real thing ?
CJB	Luke	16	12	And if you haven ’ t been trustworthy with what belongs to someone else , who will give you what ought to belong to you ?
CJB	Luke	16	13	No servant can be slave to two masters , for he will either hate the first and love the second , or scorn the second and be loyal to the first . You can ’ t be a slave to both God and money. ”
CJB	Luke	16	14	The P ’ rushim heard all this , and since they were money-lovers , they ridiculed him .
CJB	Luke	16	15	He said to them , “ You people make yourselves look righteous to others , but God knows your hearts ; what people regard highly is an abomination before God !
CJB	Luke	16	17	But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one stroke of a letter in the Torah to become void .
CJB	Luke	16	18	Every man who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery , and a man who marries a woman divorced by her husband commits adultery .
CJB	Luke	16	19	“ Once there was a rich man who used to dress in the most expensive clothing and spent his days in magnificent luxury .
CJB	Luke	16	20	At his gate had been laid a beggar named El ‘ azar who was covered with sores .
CJB	Luke	16	21	He would have been glad to eat the scraps that fell from the rich man ’ s table ; but instead , even the dogs would come and lick his sores .
CJB	Luke	16	22	In time the beggar died and was carried away by the angels to Avraham ’ s side ; the rich man also died and was buried .
CJB	Luke	16	23	“ In Sh ’ ol , where he was in torment , the rich man looked up and saw Avraham far away with El ‘ azar at his side .
CJB	Luke	16	24	He called out , ‘ Father Avraham , take pity on me , and send El ‘ azar just to dip the tip of his finger in water to cool my tongue , because I ’ m in agony in this fire ! ’
CJB	Luke	16	25	However , Avraham said , ‘ Son , remember that when you were alive , you got the good things while he got the bad ; but now he gets his consolation here , while you are the one in agony .
CJB	Luke	16	26	Yet that isn ’ t all : between you and us a deep rift has been established , so that those who would like to pass from here to you can not , nor can anyone cross over from there to us. ’
CJB	Luke	16	27	“ He answered , ‘ Then , father , I beg you to send him to my father ’ s house ,
CJB	Luke	16	28	where I have five brothers , to warn them ; so that they may be spared having to come to this place of torment too. ’
CJB	Luke	16	29	But Avraham said , ‘ They have Moshe and the Prophets ; they should listen to them. ’
CJB	Luke	16	30	However , he said , ‘ No , father Avraham , they need more . If someone from the dead goes to them , they ’ ll repent ! ’
CJB	Luke	16	31	But he replied , ‘ If they won ’ t listen to Moshe and the Prophets , they won ’ t be convinced even if someone rises from the dead ! ’ ”
CJB	Luke	17	17	Yeshua said , “ Weren ’ t ten cleansed ? Where are the other nine ?
CJB	Luke	17	2	It would be to his advantage that he have a millstone hung around his neck and he be thrown into the sea , rather than that he ensnare one of these little ones .
CJB	Luke	17	3	Watch yourselves ! If your brother sins , rebuke him ; and if he repents , forgive him .
CJB	Luke	17	4	Also , if seven times in one day he sins against you , and seven times he comes to you and says , ‘ I repent , ’ you are to forgive him. ”
CJB	Luke	17	5	The emissaries said to the Lord , “ Increase our trust. ”
CJB	Luke	17	6	The Lord replied , “ If you had trust as tiny as a mustard seed , you could say to this fig tree , ‘ Be uprooted and replanted in the sea ! ’ and it would obey you .
CJB	Luke	17	7	If one of you has a slave tending the sheep or plowing , when he comes back from the field , will you say to him , ‘ Come along now , sit down and eat ’ ?
CJB	Luke	17	8	No , you ’ ll say , ‘ Get my supper ready , dress for work , and serve me until I have finished eating and drinking ; after that , you may eat and drink. ’
CJB	Luke	17	9	Does he thank the slave because he did what he was told to do ? No !
CJB	Luke	17	10	It ’ s the same with you — when you have done everything you were told to do , you should be saying , ‘ We ’ re just ordinary slaves , we have only done our duty. ’ ”
CJB	Luke	17	11	On his way to Yerushalayim , Yeshua passed along the border country between Shomron and the Galil .
CJB	Luke	17	12	As he entered one of the villages , ten men afflicted with tzara ‘ at met him . They stood at a distance
CJB	Luke	17	13	and called out , “ Yeshua ! Rabbi ! Have pity on us ! ”
CJB	Luke	17	14	On seeing them , he said , “ Go and let the cohanim examine you ! ” And as they went , they were cleansed .
CJB	Luke	17	15	One of them , as soon as he noticed that he had been healed , returned shouting praises to God ,
CJB	Luke	17	16	and fell on his face at Yeshua ’ s feet to thank him . Now he was from Shomron .
CJB	Luke	17	18	Was no one found coming back to give glory to God except this foreigner ? ”
CJB	Luke	17	19	And to the man from Shomron he said , “ Get up , you may go ; your trust has saved you. ”
CJB	Luke	17	20	The P ’ rushim asked Yeshua when the Kingdom of God would come . “ The Kingdom of God , ” he answered , “ does not come with visible signs ;
CJB	Luke	17	21	nor will people be able to say , ‘ Look ! Here it is ! ’ or , ‘ Over there ! ’ Because , you see , the Kingdom of God is among you. ”
CJB	Luke	17	22	Then he said to his talmidim , “ The time is coming when you will long to see even one of the days of the Son of Man , but you will not see it .
CJB	Luke	17	23	People will say to you , ‘ Look ! Right here ! ’ or , ‘ See ! Over there ! ’ Don ’ t run off , don ’ t follow them ,
CJB	Luke	17	24	because the Son of Man in his day will be like lightning that flashes and lights up the sky from one horizon to the other .
CJB	Luke	17	25	But first he must endure horrible suffering and be rejected by this generation .
CJB	Luke	17	26	“ Also , at the time of the Son of Man , it will be just as it was at the time of Noach .
CJB	Luke	17	27	People ate and drank , and men and women married , right up until the day Noach entered the ark ; then the flood came and destroyed them all .
CJB	Luke	17	28	Likewise , as it was in the time of Lot — people ate and drank , bought and sold , planted and built ;
CJB	Luke	17	29	but the day Lot left S ’ dom , fire and sulfur rained down from heaven and destroyed them all .
CJB	Luke	17	30	That is how it will be on the day the Son of Man is revealed .
CJB	Luke	17	31	On that day , if someone is on the roof with his belongings in his house , he must not go down to take them away . Similarly , if someone is in the field , he must not turn back —
CJB	Luke	17	32	remember Lot ’ s wife !
CJB	Luke	17	33	Whoever aims at preserving his own life will lose it , but whoever loses his life will stay alive .
CJB	Luke	17	34	I tell you , on that night there will be two people in one bed — one will be taken and the other left behind .
CJB	Luke	17	35	There will be two women grinding grain together — one will be taken and the other left behind. ”
CJB	Luke	17	36	: Two men will be in a field — one will be taken and the other left behind . ”
CJB	Luke	17	37	They asked him , “ Where , Lord ? ” He answered , “ Wherever there ’ s a dead body , that ’ s where the vultures gather. ” Footnotes - Luke 17:36 Some manuscripts have verse
CJB	Luke	18	18	One of the leaders asked him , “ Good rabbi , what should I do to obtain eternal life ? ”
CJB	Luke	18	2	“ In a certain town , there was a judge who neither feared God nor respected other people .
CJB	Luke	18	3	There was also in that town a widow who kept coming to him and saying , ‘ Give me a judgment against the man who is trying to ruin me. ’
CJB	Luke	18	4	For a long time he refused ; but after awhile , he said to himself , ‘ I don ’ t fear God , and I don ’ t respect other people ;
CJB	Luke	18	5	but because this widow is such a nudnik , I will see to it that she gets justice — otherwise , she ’ ll keep coming and pestering me till she wears me out ! ’ ”
CJB	Luke	18	6	Then the Lord commented , “ Notice what this corrupt judge says .
CJB	Luke	18	7	Now won ’ t God grant justice to his chosen people who cry out to him day and night ? Is he delaying long over them ?
CJB	Luke	18	8	I tell you that he will judge in their favor , and quickly ! But when the Son of Man comes , will he find this trust on the earth at all ? ”
CJB	Luke	18	9	Also , to some who were relying on their own righteousness and looking down on everyone else , he told this parable :
CJB	Luke	18	10	“ Two men went up to the Temple to pray , one a Parush and the other a tax-collector .
CJB	Luke	18	11	The Parush stood and prayed to himself , ‘ O God ! I thank you that I am not like the rest of humanity — greedy , dishonest , immoral , or like this tax-collector !
CJB	Luke	18	12	I fast twice a week , I pay tithes on my entire income , . . . ’
CJB	Luke	18	13	But the tax-collector , standing far off , would not even raise his eyes toward heaven , but beat his breast and said , ‘ God ! Have mercy on me , sinner that I am ! ’
CJB	Luke	18	14	I tell you , this man went down to his home right with God rather than the other . For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled , but everyone who humbles himself will be exalted. ”
CJB	Luke	18	15	People brought him babies to touch ; but when the talmidim saw the people doing this , they rebuked them .
CJB	Luke	18	16	) ; Deuteronomy 5:16–17 (
CJB	Luke	18	17	Yes ! I tell you that whoever does not receive the Kingdom of God like a little child will not enter it at all ! ”
CJB	Luke	18	19	Yeshua said to him , “ Why are you calling me good ? No one is good but God !
CJB	Luke	18	20	)
CJB	Luke	18	21	He replied , “ I have kept all these since I was a boy. ”
CJB	Luke	18	22	On hearing this Yeshua said to him , “ There is one thing you still lack . Sell whatever you have , distribute the proceeds to the poor , and you will have riches in heaven . Then come , follow me ! ”
CJB	Luke	18	23	But when the man heard this , he became very sad , because he was very rich .
CJB	Luke	18	24	Yeshua looked at him and said , “ How hard it is for people with wealth to enter the Kingdom of God !
CJB	Luke	18	25	It ’ s easier for a camel to pass through a needle ’ s eye than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God ! ”
CJB	Luke	18	26	Those who heard this asked , “ Then who can be saved ? ”
CJB	Luke	18	27	He said , “ What is impossible humanly is possible with God. ”
CJB	Luke	18	28	Kefa said , “ Look , we have left our homes and followed you. ”
CJB	Luke	18	29	Yeshua answered them , “ Yes ! I tell you that everyone who has left house , wife , brothers , parents or children , for the sake of the kingdom of God ,
CJB	Luke	18	30	will receive many times as much in the ‘ olam hazeh , and in the ‘ olam haba eternal life. ”
CJB	Luke	18	31	Then , taking the Twelve , Yeshua said to them , “ We are now going up to Yerushalayim , where everything written through the prophets about the Son of Man will come true .
CJB	Luke	18	32	For he will be handed over to the Goyim and be ridiculed , insulted and spat upon .
CJB	Luke	18	33	Then , after they have beaten him , they will kill him . But on the third day he will rise. ”
CJB	Luke	18	34	However , they understood none of this ; its meaning had been hidden from them , and they had no idea what he was talking about .
CJB	Luke	18	35	As Yeshua approached Yericho , a blind man was sitting by the road , begging .
CJB	Luke	18	36	When he heard the crowd going past , he asked what it was all about ;
CJB	Luke	18	37	and they told him , “ Yeshua from Natzeret is passing by. ”
CJB	Luke	18	38	He called out , “ Yeshua ! Son of David ! Have pity on me ! ”
CJB	Luke	18	39	Those in front scolded him in order to get him to shut up , but he shouted all the louder , “ Son of David ! Have pity on me ! ”
CJB	Luke	18	40	Yeshua stopped and ordered the man to be brought to him . When he had come , Yeshua asked him ,
CJB	Luke	18	41	“ What do you want me to do for you ? ” The blind man said , “ Lord , let me be able to see. ”
CJB	Luke	18	42	Yeshua said to him , “ See again ! your trust has healed you ! ”
CJB	Luke	18	43	Instantly he received his sight and began following him , glorifying God ; and when all the people saw it , they too praised God . Footnotes - Luke 18:20 Exodus 20:12–13 (
CJB	Luke	19	19	and to this one he said , ‘ You be in charge of five towns. ’
CJB	Luke	19	2	when a man named Zakkai appeared who was a chief tax-collector and a wealthy man .
CJB	Luke	19	3	He was trying to see who Yeshua was ; but , being short , he couldn ’ t , because of the crowd .
CJB	Luke	19	4	So he ran on ahead and climbed a fig tree in order to see him , for Yeshua was about to pass that way .
CJB	Luke	19	5	When he came to the place , he looked up and said to him , “ Zakkai ! Hurry ! Come down , because I have to stay at your house today ! ”
CJB	Luke	19	6	He climbed down as fast as he could and welcomed Yeshua joyfully .
CJB	Luke	19	7	Everyone who saw it began muttering , “ He has gone to be the house-guest of a sinner. ”
CJB	Luke	19	8	But Zakkai stood there and said to the Lord , “ Here , Lord , I am giving half of all I own to the poor ; and if I have cheated anyone , I will pay him back four times as much. ”
CJB	Luke	19	9	Yeshua said to him , “ Today salvation has come to this house , inasmuch as this man too is a son of Avraham .
CJB	Luke	19	10	For the Son of Man came to seek and save what was lost. ”
CJB	Luke	19	11	While they were listening to this , Yeshua went on to tell a parable , because he was near Yerushalayim , and the people supposed that the Kingdom of God was about to appear at any moment .
CJB	Luke	19	12	Therefore he said , “ A nobleman went to a country far away to have himself crowned king and then return .
CJB	Luke	19	13	Calling ten of his servants , he gave them ten manim [ a maneh is about three months ’ wages ] and said to them , ‘ Do business with this while I ’ m away. ’
CJB	Luke	19	14	But his countrymen hated him , and they sent a delegation after him to say , ‘ We don ’ t want this man to rule over us. ’
CJB	Luke	19	15	“ However , he returned , having been made king , and sent for the servants to whom he had given the money , to find out what each one had earned in his business dealings .
CJB	Luke	19	16	The first one came in and said , ‘ Sir , your maneh has earned ten more manim. ’
CJB	Luke	19	17	‘ Excellent ! ’ he said to him . ‘ You are a good servant . Because you have been trustworthy in a small matter , I am putting you in charge of ten towns. ’
CJB	Luke	19	18	The second one came and said , ‘ Sir , your maneh has earned five more manim ;
CJB	Luke	19	20	“ Then another one came and said , ‘ Sir , here is your maneh . I kept it hidden in a piece of cloth ,
CJB	Luke	19	21	because I was afraid of you — you take out what you didn ’ t put in , and you harvest what you didn ’ t plant. ’
CJB	Luke	19	22	To him the master said , ‘ You wicked servant ! I will judge you by your own words ! So you knew , did you , that I was a severe man , taking out what I didn ’ t put in and harvesting what I didn ’ t plant ?
CJB	Luke	19	23	Then why didn ’ t you put my money in the bank ? Then , when I returned , I would have gotten it back with interest ! ’
CJB	Luke	19	24	To those standing by , he said , ‘ Take the maneh from him and give it to the one with ten manim. ’
CJB	Luke	19	25	They said to him , ‘ Sir , he already has ten manim ! ’
CJB	Luke	19	26	But the master answered , ‘ I tell you , everyone who has something will be given more ; but from anyone who has nothing , even what he does have will be taken away .
CJB	Luke	19	27	However , as for these enemies of mine who did not want me to be their king , bring them here and execute them in my presence ! ’ ”
CJB	Luke	19	28	After saying this , Yeshua went on and began the ascent to Yerushalayim .
CJB	Luke	19	29	As he approached Beit-Pagei and Beit-Anyah , by the Mount of Olives , he sent two talmidim ,
CJB	Luke	19	30	instructing them , “ Go into the village ahead ; on entering it , you will find a colt tied up that has never been ridden . Untie it and bring it here .
CJB	Luke	19	31	If anyone asks why you are untying it , tell him , ‘ The Lord needs it. ’ ”
CJB	Luke	19	32	Those who were sent went off and found it just as he had told them .
CJB	Luke	19	33	As they were untying the colt , its owners said to them , “ Why are you untying the colt ? ”
CJB	Luke	19	34	and they said , “ Because the Lord needs it. ”
CJB	Luke	19	35	They brought it to Yeshua ; and , throwing their robes on the colt , they put Yeshua on it .
CJB	Luke	19	36	As he went along , people carpeted the road with their clothing ;
CJB	Luke	19	37	and as he came near Yerushalayim , where the road descends from the Mount of Olives , the entire band of talmidim began to sing and praise God at the top of their voices for all the powerful works they had seen :
CJB	Luke	19	38	“ Blessed is the King who is coming in the name of Adonai ! ” [ a ] “ Shalom in heaven ! ” and “ Glory in the highest places ! ”
CJB	Luke	19	39	Some of the P ’ rushim in the crowd said to him , “ Rabbi ! Reprimand your talmidim ! ”
CJB	Luke	19	40	But he answered them , “ I tell you that if they keep quiet , the stones will shout ! ”
CJB	Luke	19	41	When Yeshua had come closer and could see the city , he wept over it ,
CJB	Luke	19	42	saying , “ If you only knew today what is needed for shalom ! But for now it is hidden from your sight .
CJB	Luke	19	43	For the days are coming upon you when your enemies will set up a barricade around you , encircle you , hem you in on every side ,
CJB	Luke	19	44	and dash you to the ground , you and your children within your walls , leaving not one stone standing on another — and all because you did not recognize your opportunity when God offered it ! ”
CJB	Luke	19	45	Then Yeshua entered the Temple grounds and began driving out those doing business there ,
CJB	Luke	19	46	saying to them , “ The Tanakh says , ‘ My House is to be a house of prayer , ’ [ b ] but you have made it into a den of robbers ! ” [ c ]
CJB	Luke	19	47	Every day he taught at the Temple . The head cohanim , the Torah-teachers and the leaders of the people tried to find a way of putting an end to him ;
CJB	Luke	19	48	but they couldn ’ t find any way of doing it , because all the people were hanging onto his every word . Footnotes - Luke 19:38 Psalm 118:26 - Luke 19:46 Isaiah 56:7 - Luke 19:46 Jeremiah 7:11
CJB	Luke	20	20	So they kept a close watch on the situation . They sent spies who hypocritically represented themselves as righteous , so that they might seize hold of something Yeshua said , as an excuse to hand him over to the jurisdiction and authority of the governor .
CJB	Luke	20	2	and said , “ Tell us , what s ’ mikhah do you have that authorizes you to do these things ? Who gave you this s ’ mikhah ? ”
CJB	Luke	20	3	He answered , “ I too will ask you a question . Tell me ,
CJB	Luke	20	4	the immersion of Yochanan — was it from Heaven or from a human source ? ”
CJB	Luke	20	5	They discussed it among themselves , saying , “ If we say , ‘ From Heaven , ’ he will say , ‘ Then why didn ’ t you believe him ? ’
CJB	Luke	20	6	But if we say , ‘ From a human source , ’ all the people will stone us , because they ’ re convinced that Yochanan was a prophet. ”
CJB	Luke	20	7	So they answered , “ We don ’ t know where it came from. ”
CJB	Luke	20	8	Yeshua said to them , “ Then I won ’ t tell you by what s ’ mikhah I do these things. ”
CJB	Luke	20	9	Next Yeshua told the people this parable : “ A man planted a vineyard , rented it to tenant-farmers and went away for a long time .
CJB	Luke	20	10	When the time came , he sent a servant to the tenants to receive his share of the crop from the vineyard ; but the tenants beat him up and sent him away empty-handed .
CJB	Luke	20	11	He sent another servant ; they beat him too , insulted him and sent him away empty-handed .
CJB	Luke	20	12	He sent yet a third ; this one they wounded and threw out .
CJB	Luke	20	13	“ Then the owner of the vineyard said , ‘ What am I to do ? I will send my son , whom I love ; maybe they will respect him. ’
CJB	Luke	20	14	But when the tenants saw him , they discussed it among themselves and said , ‘ This is the heir ; let ’ s kill him , so that the inheritance will be ours ! ’
CJB	Luke	20	15	And they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him . “ Now what will the owner of the vineyard do to them ?
CJB	Luke	20	16	He will come and put an end to those tenants and give the vineyard to others ! ” When the people heard this , they said , “ Heaven forbid ! ”
CJB	Luke	20	17	But Yeshua looked searchingly at them and said , “ Then what is this which is written in the Tanakh , ‘ The very rock which the builders rejected has become the cornerstone ’ ? [ a ]
CJB	Luke	20	18	Whoever falls on that stone will be broken in pieces ; but if it falls on him , he will be crushed to powder ! ”
CJB	Luke	20	19	The Torah-teachers and the head cohanim would have seized him at that very moment , because they knew that he had aimed this parable at them , but they were afraid of the people .
CJB	Luke	20	21	They put to him this sh ’ eilah : “ Rabbi , we know that you speak and teach straightforwardly , showing no partiality but really teaching what God ’ s way is .
CJB	Luke	20	22	Does Torah permit us to pay taxes to the Roman Emperor or not ? ”
CJB	Luke	20	23	But he , spotting their craftiness , said to them ,
CJB	Luke	20	24	“ Show me a denarius ! Whose name and picture does it have ? ” “ The Emperor ’ s , ” they replied .
CJB	Luke	20	25	“ Then , ” he said to them , “ give the Emperor what belongs to the Emperor . And give God what belongs to God ! ”
CJB	Luke	20	26	They were unable to trap him by anything he said publicly ; indeed , amazed at his answer , they fell silent .
CJB	Luke	20	27	Some Tz ’ dukim , who say there is no resurrection , came to Yeshua
CJB	Luke	20	28	and put to him a sh ’ eilah : “ Rabbi , Moshe wrote for us that if a man dies leaving a wife but no children , his brother must take the wife and have children to preserve the man ’ s family line . [ b ]
CJB	Luke	20	29	Now there were seven brothers . The first took a wife and died childless ,
CJB	Luke	20	30	then the second
CJB	Luke	20	31	and third took her , and likewise all seven , but they all died without leaving children .
CJB	Luke	20	32	Lastly , the woman also died .
CJB	Luke	20	33	In the Resurrection , which one ’ s wife will she be ? For all seven were married to her. ”
CJB	Luke	20	34	Yeshua said to them , “ In this age , men and women marry ;
CJB	Luke	20	35	but those judged worthy of the age to come , and of resurrection from the dead , do not get married ,
CJB	Luke	20	36	because they can no longer die . Being children of the Resurrection , they are like angels ; indeed , they are children of God .
CJB	Luke	20	37	“ But even Moshe showed that the dead are raised ; for in the passage about the bush , he calls Adonai ‘ the God of Avraham , the God of Yitz ’ chak and the God of Ya ‘ akov. ’ [ c ]
CJB	Luke	20	38	Now he is not God of the dead , but of the living — to him all are alive. ”
CJB	Luke	20	39	Some of the Torah-teachers answered , “ Well spoken , Rabbi. ”
CJB	Luke	20	40	For they no longer dared put to him a sh ’ eilah .
CJB	Luke	20	41	But he said to them , “ How is it that people say the Messiah is David ’ s son ? ”
CJB	Luke	20	42	For David himself says in the book of Psalms ,
CJB	Luke	20	43	‘ Adonai said to my Lord , “ Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies your footstool. ” ’ [ d ]
CJB	Luke	20	44	David thus calls him ‘ Lord. ’ So how can he be David ’ s son ? ”
CJB	Luke	20	45	Within the hearing of all the people , Yeshua said to his talmidim ,
CJB	Luke	20	46	“ Watch out for the kind of Torah-teachers that like to walk around in robes and be greeted deferentially in the marketplaces , the kind that like to have the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets ,
CJB	Luke	20	47	the kind that swallow up widows ’ houses while making a show of davvening at great length . Their punishment will be all the worse ! ” Footnotes - Luke 20:17 Psalm 118:22 - Luke 20:28 Deuteronomy 25:5 - Luke 20:37 Exodus 3:6 - Luke 20:43 Psalm 110:1
CJB	Luke	21	21	- Luke 21:27 Daniel 7:13–14
CJB	Luke	21	2	he also saw a poor widow put in two small coins .
CJB	Luke	21	3	He said , “ I tell you the truth , this poor widow has put in more than all the others .
CJB	Luke	21	4	For they , out of their wealth , have contributed money they could easily spare ; but she , out of her poverty , has given all she had to live on. ”
CJB	Luke	21	5	As some people were remarking about the Temple , how beautiful its stonework and memorial decorations were , he said ,
CJB	Luke	21	6	“ The time is coming when what you see here will be totally destroyed — not a single stone will be left standing ! ”
CJB	Luke	21	7	They asked him , “ Rabbi , if this is so , when will these events take place ? And what sign will show that they are about to happen ? ”
CJB	Luke	21	8	He answered , “ Watch out ! Don ’ t be fooled ! For many will come in my name , saying , ‘ I am he ! ’ and , ‘ The time has come ! ’ Don ’ t go after them .
CJB	Luke	21	9	And when you hear of wars and revolutions , don ’ t panic . For these things must happen first , but the end will not follow immediately. ”
CJB	Luke	21	10	Then he told them , “ Peoples will fight each other , nations will fight each other ,
CJB	Luke	21	11	there will be great earthquakes , there will be epidemics and famines in various places , and there will be fearful sights and great signs from Heaven .
CJB	Luke	21	12	But before all this , they will arrest you and persecute you , handing you over to the synagogues and prisons ; and you will be brought before kings and governors . This will all be on account of me ,
CJB	Luke	21	13	but it will prove an opportunity for you to bear witness .
CJB	Luke	21	14	So make up your minds not to worry , rehearsing your defense beforehand ;
CJB	Luke	21	15	for I myself will give you an eloquence and a wisdom that no adversary will be able to resist or refute .
CJB	Luke	21	16	You will be betrayed even by parents , brothers , relatives and friends ; some of you they will have put to death ;
CJB	Luke	21	17	and everyone will hate you because of me .
CJB	Luke	21	18	But not a hair of your head will be lost .
CJB	Luke	21	19	By standing firm you will save your lives .
CJB	Luke	21	20	“ However , when you see Yerushalayim surrounded by armies , then you are to understand that she is about to be destroyed .
CJB	Luke	21	22	For these are the days of vengeance , when everything that has been written in the Tanakh will come true .
CJB	Luke	21	23	What a terrible time it will be for pregnant women and nursing mothers ! For there will be great distress in the Land and judgment on the people .
CJB	Luke	21	24	Some will fall by the edge of the sword , others will be carried into all the countries of the Goyim , and Yerushalayim will be trampled down by the Goyim until the age of the Goyim has run its course .
CJB	Luke	21	25	“ There will appear signs in the sun , moon and stars ; and on earth , nations will be in anxiety and bewilderment at the sound and surge of the sea ,
CJB	Luke	21	26	as people faint with fear at the prospect of what is overtaking the world ; for the powers in heaven will be shaken . [ a ]
CJB	Luke	21	27	And then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with tremendous power and glory . [ b ]
CJB	Luke	21	28	When these things start to happen , stand up and hold your heads high ; because you are about to be liberated ! ”
CJB	Luke	21	29	Then he told them a parable : “ Look at the fig tree , Indeed , all the trees .
CJB	Luke	21	30	As soon as they sprout leaves , you can see for yourselves that summer is near .
CJB	Luke	21	31	In the same way , when you see these things taking place , you are to know that the Kingdom of God is near !
CJB	Luke	21	32	Yes ! I tell you that this people will certainly not pass away before it has all happened .
CJB	Luke	21	33	Heaven and earth will pass away , but my words will certainly not pass away .
CJB	Luke	21	34	“ But keep watch on yourselves , or your hearts will become dulled by carousing , drunkenness and the worries of everyday living , and that Day will be sprung upon you suddenly like a trap !
CJB	Luke	21	35	For it will close in on everyone , no matter where they live , throughout the whole world .
CJB	Luke	21	36	Stay alert , always praying that you will have the strength to escape all the things that will happen and to stand in the presence of the Son of Man. ”
CJB	Luke	21	37	Yeshua spent his days at the Temple , teaching ; while at night he went out and stayed on the hill called the Mount of Olives .
CJB	Luke	21	38	All the people would rise with the dawn to come and hear him at the Temple courts . Footnotes - Luke 21:26 Haggai 2:6 ,
CJB	Luke	22	22	The Son of Man is going to his death according to God ’ s plan , but woe to that man by whom he is being betrayed ! ”
CJB	Luke	22	2	and the head cohanim and the Torah-teachers began trying to find some way to get rid of Yeshua , because they were afraid of the people .
CJB	Luke	22	3	At this point the Adversary went into Y ’ hudah from K ’ riot , who was one of the Twelve .
CJB	Luke	22	4	He approached the head cohanim and the Temple guard and discussed with them how he might turn Yeshua over to them .
CJB	Luke	22	5	They were pleased and offered to pay him money .
CJB	Luke	22	6	He agreed and began looking for a good opportunity to betray Yeshua without the people ’ s knowledge .
CJB	Luke	22	7	Then came the day of matzah , on which the Passover lamb had to be killed .
CJB	Luke	22	8	Yeshua sent Kefa and Yochanan , instructing them , “ Go and prepare our Seder , so we can eat. ”
CJB	Luke	22	9	They asked him , “ Where do you want us to prepare it ? ”
CJB	Luke	22	10	He told them , “ As you ’ re going into the city , a man carrying a jar of water will meet you . Follow him into the house he enters ,
CJB	Luke	22	11	and say to its owner , ‘ The Rabbi says to you , “ Where is the guest room , where I am to eat the Pesach meal with my talmidim ? ” ’
CJB	Luke	22	12	He will show you a large room upstairs already furnished ; make the preparations there. ”
CJB	Luke	22	13	They went and found things just as Yeshua had told them they would be , and they prepared for the Seder .
CJB	Luke	22	14	When the time came , Yeshua and the emissaries reclined at the table ,
CJB	Luke	22	15	and he said to them , “ I have really wanted so much to celebrate this Seder with you before I die !
CJB	Luke	22	16	For I tell you , it is certain that I will not celebrate it again until it is given its full meaning in the Kingdom of God. ”
CJB	Luke	22	17	Then , taking a cup of wine , he made the b ’ rakhah and said , “ Take this and share it among yourselves .
CJB	Luke	22	18	For I tell you that from now on , I will not drink the ‘ fruit of the vine ’ until the Kingdom of God comes. ”
CJB	Luke	22	19	Also , taking a piece of matzah , he made the b ’ rakhah , broke it , gave it to them and said , “ This is my body , which is being given for you ; do this in memory of me. ”
CJB	Luke	22	20	He did the same with the cup after the meal , saying , “ This cup is the New Covenant , ratified by my blood , which is being poured out for you .
CJB	Luke	22	21	“ But look ! The person who is betraying me is here at the table with me !
CJB	Luke	22	23	They began asking each other which of them could be about to do such a thing .
CJB	Luke	22	24	An argument arose among them as to which of them should be considered the greatest .
CJB	Luke	22	25	But Yeshua said to them , “ The kings of the Goyim lord it over them ; and those in authority over them are given the title , ‘ Benefactor. ’
CJB	Luke	22	26	But not so with you ! On the contrary , let the greater among you become like the younger , and one who rules like one who serves .
CJB	Luke	22	27	For who is greater ? The one reclining at the table ? or the one who serves ? It ’ s the one reclining at the table , isn ’ t it ? But I myself am among you like one who serves .
CJB	Luke	22	28	“ You are the ones who have stayed with me throughout my trials .
CJB	Luke	22	29	Just as my Father gave me the right to rule , so I give you an appointment ,
CJB	Luke	22	30	namely , to eat and drink at my table in my Kingdom and to sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Luke	22	31	“ Shim ‘ on , Shim ‘ on , listen ! The Adversary demanded to have you people for himself , to sift you like wheat !
CJB	Luke	22	32	But I prayed for you , Shim ‘ on , that your trust might not fail . And you , once you have turned back in repentance , strengthen your brothers ! ”
CJB	Luke	22	33	Shim ‘ on said to him , “ Lord , I am prepared to go with you both to prison and to death ! ”
CJB	Luke	22	34	Yeshua replied , “ I tell you , Kefa , the rooster will not crow today until you have denied three times that you know me. ”
CJB	Luke	22	35	He said to them , “ When I sent you out without wallet , pack or shoes , were you ever short of anything ? ” “ Not a thing , ” they answered .
CJB	Luke	22	36	“ But now , ” he said , if you have a wallet or a pack , take it ; and if you don ’ t have a sword , sell your robe to buy one .
CJB	Luke	22	37	For I tell you this : the passage from the Tanakh that says , ‘ He was counted with transgressors , ’ [ a ] has to be fulfilled in me ; since what is happening to me has a purpose. ”
CJB	Luke	22	38	They said , “ Look , Lord , there are two swords right here ! ” “ Enough ! ” he replied .
CJB	Luke	22	39	On leaving , Yeshua went as usual to the Mount of Olives ; and the talmidim followed him .
CJB	Luke	22	40	When he arrived , he said to them , “ Pray that you won ’ t be put to the test. ”
CJB	Luke	22	41	He went about a stone ’ s throw away from them , kneeled down and prayed ,
CJB	Luke	22	42	“ Father , if you are willing , take this cup away from me ; still , let not my will but yours be done. ”
CJB	Luke	22	43	There appeared to him an angel from heaven giving him strength ,
CJB	Luke	22	44	and in great anguish he prayed more intensely , so that his sweat became like drops of blood falling to the ground .
CJB	Luke	22	45	On rising from prayer and coming to the talmidim , he found them sleeping because of their grief .
CJB	Luke	22	46	He said to them , “ Why are you sleeping ? Get up and pray that you won ’ t be put to the test ! ”
CJB	Luke	22	47	While he was still speaking , a crowd of people arrived , with the man called Y ’ hudah ( one of the Twelve ! ) leading them . He came up to Yeshua to kiss him ,
CJB	Luke	22	48	but Yeshua said to him , “ Y ’ hudah , are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss ? ”
CJB	Luke	22	49	When his followers saw what was going to happen , they said , “ Lord , should we use our swords ? ”
CJB	Luke	22	50	One of them struck at the slave of the cohen hagadol and cut off his right ear .
CJB	Luke	22	51	But Yeshua answered , “ Just let me do this , ” and , touching the man ’ s ear , he healed him .
CJB	Luke	22	52	Then Yeshua said to the head cohanim , the officers of the Temple guard and the elders who had come to seize him , “ So you came out just as you would to the leader of a rebellion , with swords and clubs ?
CJB	Luke	22	53	Every day I was there with you in the Temple court , yet you didn ’ t arrest me . But this is your hour — the hour when darkness rules. ”
CJB	Luke	22	54	Having seized him , they led him away and brought him into the house of the cohen hagadol . Kefa followed at a distance ;
CJB	Luke	22	55	but when they had lit a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together , Kefa joined them .
CJB	Luke	22	56	One of the servant girls saw him sitting in the light of the fire , stared at him and said , “ This man also was with him. ”
CJB	Luke	22	57	But he denied it : “ Lady , I don ’ t even know him. ”
CJB	Luke	22	58	A little later , someone else saw him and said , “ You ’ re one of them too ” ; but Kefa said , “ Man , I am not ! ”
CJB	Luke	22	59	About an hour later , another man asserted emphatically , “ There can be no doubt that this fellow was with him , because he too is from the Galil ! ”
CJB	Luke	22	60	But Kefa said , “ Man , I don ’ t know what you ’ re talking about ! ” And instantly , while he was still speaking , a rooster crowed .
CJB	Luke	22	61	The Lord turned and looked straight at Kefa ; and Kefa remembered what the Lord had said , “ Before the rooster crows today , you will deny me three times. ”
CJB	Luke	22	62	And he went outside and cried bitterly .
CJB	Luke	22	63	Meanwhile , the men who were holding Yeshua made fun of him . They beat him ,
CJB	Luke	22	64	blindfolded him , and kept asking him , “ Now , ‘ prophesy ’ ! Who hit you that time ? ”
CJB	Luke	22	65	And they said many other insulting things to him .
CJB	Luke	22	66	At daybreak , the people ’ s council of elders , including both head cohanim and Torah-teachers , met and led him off to their Sanhedrin ,
CJB	Luke	22	67	where they said , “ If you are the Mashiach , tell us. ” He answered , “ If I tell you , you won ’ t believe me ;
CJB	Luke	22	68	and if I ask you , you won ’ t answer .
CJB	Luke	22	69	But from now on , the Son of Man will be sitting at the right hand of HaG ’ vurah , ” [ b ]
CJB	Luke	22	70	They all said , “ Does this mean , then , that you are the Son of God ? ” And he answered them , “ You say I am. ”
CJB	Luke	22	71	They said , “ Why do we need additional testimony ? We have heard it ourselves from his own mouth ! ” Footnotes - Luke 22:37 Isaiah 53:12 - Luke 22:69 Psalm 110:1
CJB	Luke	23	23	But they went on yelling insistently , demanding that he be executed on the stake ; and their shouting prevailed .
CJB	Luke	23	2	where they started accusing him . “ We found this man subverting our nation , forbidding us to pay taxes to the Emperor and claiming that he himself is the Messiah — a king ! ”
CJB	Luke	23	3	Pilate asked him , “ Are you the king of the Jews ? ” And he answered him , “ The words are yours. ”
CJB	Luke	23	4	Pilate said to the head cohanim and the crowds , “ I find no ground for a charge against this man. ”
CJB	Luke	23	5	)
CJB	Luke	23	6	On hearing this , Pilate asked if the man was from the Galil ;
CJB	Luke	23	7	) - Luke 23:36 Psalm 69:22 (
CJB	Luke	23	8	Herod was delighted to see Yeshua , because he had heard about him and for a long time had been wanting to meet him ; indeed , he hoped to see him perform some miracle .
CJB	Luke	23	9	He questioned him at great length , but Yeshua made no reply .
CJB	Luke	23	10	However , the head cohanim and the Torah-teachers stood there , vehemently pressing their case against him .
CJB	Luke	23	11	Herod and his soldiers treated Yeshua with contempt and made fun of him . Then , dressing him in an elegant robe , they sent him back to Pilate .
CJB	Luke	23	12	That day Herod and Pilate became friends with each other ; previously they had been enemies .
CJB	Luke	23	13	Pilate summoned the head cohanim , the leaders and the people ,
CJB	Luke	23	14	and said to them , “ You brought this man before me on a charge of subverting the people . I examined him in your presence and did not find the man guilty of the crime you are accusing him of .
CJB	Luke	23	15	And neither did Herod , because he sent him back to us . Clearly , he has not done anything that merits the death penalty .
CJB	Luke	23	16	Therefore , what I will do is have him flogged and release him. ”
CJB	Luke	23	17	: For he was required to release one man to them at the festival . - Luke 23:30 Hosea 10:8 - Luke 23:34 Psalm 22:19 (
CJB	Luke	23	18	) - Luke 23:35 Psalm 22:8 (
CJB	Luke	23	19	( He was a man who had been thrown in prison for causing a riot in the city and for murder . )
CJB	Luke	23	20	Pilate appealed to them again , because he wanted to release Yeshua .
CJB	Luke	23	21	) - Luke 23:46 Psalm 31:6 (
CJB	Luke	23	22	A third time he asked them , “ But what has this man done wrong ? I haven ’ t found any reason to put him to death . So I ’ m going to have him flogged and set free. ”
CJB	Luke	23	24	Pilate decided to grant their demand ;
CJB	Luke	23	25	he released the man who had been thrown in prison for insurrection and murder , the one they had asked for ; and Yeshua he surrendered to their will .
CJB	Luke	23	26	As the Roman soldiers led Yeshua away , they grabbed hold of a man from Cyrene named Shim ‘ on , who was on his way in from the country . They put the execution-stake on his back and made him carry it behind Yeshua .
CJB	Luke	23	27	Large numbers of people followed , including women crying and wailing over him .
CJB	Luke	23	28	Yeshua turned to them and said , “ Daughters of Yerushalayim , don ’ t cry for me ; cry for yourselves and your children !
CJB	Luke	23	29	For the time is coming when people will say , ‘ The childless women are the lucky ones — those whose wombs have never borne a child , whose breasts have never nursed a baby !
CJB	Luke	23	30	Then They will begin to say to the mountains , ‘ Fall on us ! ’ and to the hills , ‘ Cover us ! ’ [ b ]
CJB	Luke	23	31	For if they do these things when the wood is green , what is going to happen when it ’ s dry ? ”
CJB	Luke	23	32	Two other men , both criminals , were led out to be executed with him .
CJB	Luke	23	33	When they came to the place called The Skull , they nailed him to a stake ; and they nailed the criminals to stakes , one on the right and one on the left .
CJB	Luke	23	34	Yeshua said , “ Father , forgive them ; they don ’ t understand what they are doing. ” They divided up his clothes by throwing dice . [ c ]
CJB	Luke	23	35	The people stood watching , and the rulers sneered at him . [ d ] “ He saved others , ” they said , “ so if he really is the Messiah , the one chosen by God , let him save himself ! ”
CJB	Luke	23	36	The soldiers too ridiculed him ; they came up , offered him vinegar [ e ]
CJB	Luke	23	37	and said , “ If you are the king of the Jews , save yourself ! ”
CJB	Luke	23	38	And there was a notice over him which read , THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS
CJB	Luke	23	39	One of the criminals hanging there hurled insults at him . “ Aren ’ t you the Messiah ? Save yourself and us ! ”
CJB	Luke	23	40	But the other one spoke up and rebuked the first , saying , “ Have you no fear of God ? You ’ re getting the same punishment as he is .
CJB	Luke	23	41	Ours is only fair ; we ’ re getting what we deserve for what we did . But this man did nothing wrong. ”
CJB	Luke	23	42	Then he said , “ Yeshua , remember me when you come as King. ”
CJB	Luke	23	43	Yeshua said to him , “ Yes ! I promise that you will be with me today in Gan- ‘ Eden. ”
CJB	Luke	23	44	It was now about noon , and darkness covered the whole Land until three o ’ clock in the afternoon ;
CJB	Luke	23	45	the sun did not shine . Also the parokhet in the Temple was split down the middle .
CJB	Luke	23	46	Crying out with a loud voice , Yeshua said , “ Father ! Into your hands I commit my spirit. ” [ f ] With these words he gave up his spirit .
CJB	Luke	23	47	When the Roman officer saw what had happened , he began to praise God and said , “ Surely this man was innocent ! ”
CJB	Luke	23	48	And when all the crowds that had gathered to watch the spectacle saw the things that had occurred , they returned home beating their breasts .
CJB	Luke	23	49	All his friends , including the women who had accompanied him from the Galil , had been standing at a distance ; they saw it all .
CJB	Luke	23	50	There was a man named Yosef , a member of the Sanhedrin . He was a good man , a tzaddik ;
CJB	Luke	23	51	and he had not been in agreement with either the Sanhedrin ’ s motivation or their action . He came from the town of Ramatayim , a town of the Judeans ; and he looked forward to the Kingdom of God .
CJB	Luke	23	52	This man approached Pilate and asked for Yeshua ’ s body .
CJB	Luke	23	53	He took it down , wrapped it in a linen sheet , and placed it in a tomb cut into the rock , that had never been used .
CJB	Luke	23	54	It was Preparation Day , and a Shabbat was about to begin .
CJB	Luke	23	55	The women who had come with Yeshua from the Galil followed ; they saw the tomb and how his body was placed in it .
CJB	Luke	23	56	Then they went back home to prepare spices and ointments . On Shabbat the women rested , in obedience to the commandment ; Footnotes - Luke 23:17 Some manuscripts have verse
CJB	Luke	24	24	Some of our friends went to the tomb and found it exactly as the women had said , but they didn ’ t see him. ”
CJB	Luke	24	2	and found the stone rolled away from the tomb !
CJB	Luke	24	3	On entering , they discovered that the body of the Lord Yeshua was gone !
CJB	Luke	24	4	They were standing there , not knowing what to think about it , when suddenly two men in dazzlingly bright clothing stood next to them .
CJB	Luke	24	5	Terror-stricken , they bowed down with their faces to the ground . The two men said to them , “ Why are you looking for the living among the dead ?
CJB	Luke	24	6	He is not here ; he has been raised . Remember how he told you while he was still in the Galil ,
CJB	Luke	24	7	‘ The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be executed on a stake as a criminal , but on the third day be raised again ’ ? ”
CJB	Luke	24	8	Then they remembered his words ;
CJB	Luke	24	9	and , returning from the tomb , they told everything to the Eleven and to all the rest .
CJB	Luke	24	10	The women who told the emissaries these things were Miryam of Magdala , Yochanah , Miryam the mother of Ya ‘ akov , and the others in their circle .
CJB	Luke	24	11	But the emissaries didn ’ t believe them ; in fact , they thought that what they said was utter nonsense !
CJB	Luke	24	12	However , Kefa got up and ran to the tomb . Stooping down , he saw only the burial cloths and went home wondering what had happened .
CJB	Luke	24	13	That same day , two of them were going toward a village about seven miles from Yerushalayim called Amma ’ us ,
CJB	Luke	24	14	and they were talking with each other about all the things that had happened .
CJB	Luke	24	15	As they talked and discussed , Yeshua himself came up and walked along with them ,
CJB	Luke	24	16	but something kept them from recognizing him .
CJB	Luke	24	17	He asked them , “ What are you talking about with each other as you walk along ? ” They stopped short , their faces downcast ;
CJB	Luke	24	18	and one of them , named Cleopas , answered him , “ Are you the only person staying in Yerushalayim that doesn ’ t know the things that have been going on there the last few days ? ”
CJB	Luke	24	19	“ What things ? ” he asked them . They said to him , “ The things about Yeshua from Natzeret . He was a prophet and proved it by the things he did and said before God and all the people .
CJB	Luke	24	20	Our head cohanim and our leaders handed him over , so that he could be sentenced to death and executed on a stake as a criminal .
CJB	Luke	24	21	And we had hoped that he would be the one to liberate Isra ’ el ! Besides all that , today is the third day since these things happened ;
CJB	Luke	24	22	and this morning , some of the women astounded us . They were at the tomb early
CJB	Luke	24	23	and couldn ’ t find his body , so they came back ; but they also reported that they had seen a vision of angels who say he ’ s alive !
CJB	Luke	24	25	He said to them , “ Foolish people ! So unwilling to put your trust in everything the prophets spoke !
CJB	Luke	24	26	Didn ’ t the Messiah have to die like this before entering his glory ? ”
CJB	Luke	24	27	Then , starting with Moshe and all the prophets , he explained to them the things that can be found throughout the Tanakh concerning himself .
CJB	Luke	24	28	They approached the village where they were going . He made as if he were going on farther ;
CJB	Luke	24	29	but they held him back , saying , “ Stay with us , for it ’ s almost evening , and it ’ s getting dark. ” So he went in to stay with them .
CJB	Luke	24	30	As he was reclining with them at the table , he took the matzah , made the b ’ rakhah , broke it and handed it to them .
CJB	Luke	24	31	Then their eyes were opened , and they recognized him . But he became invisible to them .
CJB	Luke	24	32	They said to each other , “ Didn ’ t our hearts burn inside us as he spoke to us on the road , opening up the Tanakh to us ? ”
CJB	Luke	24	33	They got up at once , returned to Yerushalayim and found the Eleven gathered together with their friends ,
CJB	Luke	24	34	saying , “ It ’ s true ! The Lord has risen ! Shim ‘ on saw him ! ”
CJB	Luke	24	35	Then the two told what had happened on the road and how he had become known to them in the breaking of the matzah .
CJB	Luke	24	36	They were still talking about it when — there he was , standing among them !
CJB	Luke	24	37	Startled and terrified , they thought they were seeing a ghost .
CJB	Luke	24	38	But he said to them , “ Why are you so upset ? Why are these doubts welling up inside you ?
CJB	Luke	24	39	Look at my hands and my feet — it is I , myself ! Touch me and see — a ghost doesn ’ t have flesh and bones , as you can see I do. ”
CJB	Luke	24	40	As he said this , he showed them his hands and feet .
CJB	Luke	24	41	While they were still unable to believe it for joy and stood there dumbfounded , he said to them , “ Have you something here to eat ? ”
CJB	Luke	24	42	They gave him a piece of broiled fish ,
CJB	Luke	24	43	which he took and ate in their presence .
CJB	Luke	24	44	Yeshua said to them , “ This is what I meant when I was still with you and told you that everything written about me in the Torah of Moshe , the Prophets and the Psalms had to be fulfilled. ”
CJB	Luke	24	45	Then he opened their minds , so that they could understand the Tanakh ,
CJB	Luke	24	46	telling them , “ Here is what it says : the Messiah is to suffer and to rise from the dead on the third day ;
CJB	Luke	24	47	and in his name repentance leading to forgiveness of sins is to be proclaimed to people from all nations , starting with Yerushalayim .
CJB	Luke	24	48	You are witnesses of these things .
CJB	Luke	24	49	Now I am sending forth upon you what my Father promised , so stay here in the city until you have been equipped with power from above. ”
CJB	Luke	24	50	He led them out toward Beit-Anyah ; then , raising his hands , he said a b ’ rakhah over them ;
CJB	Luke	24	51	and as he was blessing them , he withdrew from them and was carried up into heaven .
CJB	Luke	24	52	They bowed in worship to him , then returned to Yerushalayim , overflowing with joy .
CJB	Luke	24	53	And they spent all their time in the Temple courts , praising God .
CJB	John	1	1	In the beginning was the Word , and the Word was with God , and the Word was God .
CJB	John	1	2	He was with God in the beginning .
CJB	John	1	3	All things came to be through him , and without him nothing made had being .
CJB	John	1	4	In him was life , and the life was the light of mankind .
CJB	John	1	5	The light shines in the darkness , and the darkness has not suppressed it .
CJB	John	1	6	There was a man sent from God whose name was Yochanan .
CJB	John	1	7	He came to be a testimony , to bear witness concerning the light ; so that through him , everyone might put his trust in God and be faithful to him .
CJB	John	1	8	He himself was not that light ; no , he came to bear witness concerning the light .
CJB	John	1	9	This was the true light , which gives light to everyone entering the world .
CJB	John	1	10	He was in the world — the world came to be through him — yet the world did not know him .
CJB	John	1	11	He came to his own homeland , yet his own people did not receive him .
CJB	John	1	12	But to as many as did receive him , to those who put their trust in his person and power , he gave the right to become children of God ,
CJB	John	1	13	not because of bloodline , physical impulse or human intention , but because of God .
CJB	John	1	14	The Word became a human being and lived with us , and we saw his Sh ’ khinah , the Sh ’ khinah of the Father ’ s only Son , full of grace and truth .
CJB	John	1	15	Yochanan witnessed concerning him when he cried out , “ This is the man I was talking about when I said , ‘ The one coming after me has come to rank ahead of me , because he existed before me. ’ ”
CJB	John	1	16	We have all received from his fullness , yes , grace upon grace .
CJB	John	1	17	For the Torah was given through Moshe ; grace and truth came through Yeshua the Messiah .
CJB	John	1	18	No one has ever seen God ; but the only and unique Son , who is identical with God and is at the Father ’ s side — he has made him known .
CJB	John	1	19	Here is Yochanan ’ s testimony : when the Judeans sent cohanim and L ’ vi ’ im from Yerushalayim to ask him , “ Who are you ? ”
CJB	John	1	20	he was very straightforward and stated clearly , “ I am not the Messiah. ”
CJB	John	1	21	“ Then who are you ? ” they asked him . “ Are you Eliyahu ? ” “ No , I am not , ” he said . “ Are you ‘ the prophet , ’ the one we ’ re expecting ? ” “ No , ” he replied .
CJB	John	1	22	So they said to him , “ Who are you ? — so that we can give an answer to the people who sent us . What do you have to say about yourself ? ”
CJB	John	1	23	He answered in the words of Yesha ‘ yahu the prophet , “ I am The voice of someone crying out : ‘ In the desert make the way of Adonai straight ! ’ ” [ a ]
CJB	John	1	24	Some of those who had been sent were P ’ rushim .
CJB	John	1	25	They asked him , “ If you are neither the Messiah nor Eliyahu nor ‘ the prophet , ’ then why are you immersing people ? ”
CJB	John	1	26	To them Yochanan replied , “ I am immersing people in water , but among you is standing someone whom you don ’ t know .
CJB	John	1	27	He is the one coming after me — I ’ m not good enough even to untie his sandal ! ”
CJB	John	1	28	All this took place in Beit-Anyah , east of the Yarden , where Yochanan was immersing .
CJB	John	1	29	The next day , Yochanan saw Yeshua coming toward him and said , “ Look ! God ’ s lamb ! The one who is taking away the sin of the world !
CJB	John	1	30	This is the man I was talking about when I said , ‘ After me is coming someone who has come to rank above me , because he existed before me. ’
CJB	John	1	31	I myself did not know who he was , but the reason I came immersing with water was so that he might be made known to Isra ’ el. ”
CJB	John	1	32	Then Yochanan gave this testimony : “ I saw the Spirit coming down from heaven like a dove , and remaining on him .
CJB	John	1	33	I myself did not know who he was , but the one who sent me to immerse in water said to me , ‘ The one on whom you see the Spirit descending and remaining , this is the one who immerses in the Ruach HaKodesh. ’
CJB	John	1	34	And I have seen and borne witness that this is the Son of God. ”
CJB	John	1	35	The next day , Yochanan was again standing with two of his talmidim .
CJB	John	1	36	On seeing Yeshua walking by , he said , “ Look ! God ’ s lamb ! ”
CJB	John	1	37	His two talmidim heard him speaking , and they followed Yeshua .
CJB	John	1	38	Yeshua turned and saw them following him , and he asked them , “ What are you looking for ? ” They said to him , “ Rabbi ! ” ( which means “ Teacher ! ” ) “ Where are you staying ? ”
CJB	John	1	39	He said to them , “ Come and see. ” So they went and saw where he was staying , and remained with him the rest of the day — it was about four o ’ clock in the afternoon .
CJB	John	1	40	One of the two who had heard Yochanan and had followed Yeshua was Andrew the brother of Shim ‘ on Kefa .
CJB	John	1	41	The first thing he did was to find his brother Shim ‘ on and tell him , “ We ’ ve found the Mashiach ! ” ( The word means “ one who has been anointed. ” )
CJB	John	1	42	He took him to Yeshua . Looking at him , Yeshua said , “ You are Shim ‘ on Bar-Yochanan ; you will be known as Kefa. ” ( The name means “ rock. ” )
CJB	John	1	43	The next day , having decided to leave for the Galil , Yeshua found Philip and said , “ Follow me ! ”
CJB	John	1	44	Philip was from Beit-Tzaidah , the town where Andrew and Kefa lived .
CJB	John	1	45	Philip found Natan ’ el and told him , “ We ’ ve found the one that Moshe wrote about in the Torah , also the Prophets — it ’ s Yeshua Ben-Yosef from Natzeret ! ”
CJB	John	1	46	Natan ’ el answered him , “ Natzeret ? Can anything good come from there ? ” “ Come and see , ” Philip said to him .
CJB	John	1	47	Yeshua saw Natan ’ el coming toward him and remarked about him , “ Here ’ s a true son of Isra ’ el — nothing false in him ! ”
CJB	John	1	48	Natan ’ el said to him , “ How do you know me ? ” Yeshua answered him , “ Before Philip called you , when you were under the fig tree , I saw you. ”
CJB	John	1	49	Natan ’ el said , “ Rabbi , you are the Son of God ! You are the King of Isra ’ el ! ”
CJB	John	1	50	Yeshua answered him , “ you believe all this just because I told you I saw you under the fig tree ? You will see greater things than that ! ”
CJB	John	1	51	Then he said to him , “ Yes indeed ! I tell you that you will see heaven opened and the angels of God going up and coming down [ b ] on the Son of Man ! ”
CJB	John	2	2	Yeshua too was invited to the wedding , along with his talmidim .
CJB	John	2	3	The wine ran out , and Yeshua ’ s mother said to him , “ They have no more wine. ”
CJB	John	2	4	Yeshua replied , “ Mother , why should that concern me ? — or you ? My time hasn ’ t come yet. ”
CJB	John	2	5	His mother said to the servants , “ Do whatever he tells you. ”
CJB	John	2	6	Now six stone water-jars were standing there for the Jewish ceremonial washings , each with a capacity of twenty or thirty gallons .
CJB	John	2	7	Yeshua told them , “ Fill the jars with water , ” and they filled them to the brim .
CJB	John	2	8	He said , “ Now draw some out , and take it to the man in charge of the banquet ” ; and they took it .
CJB	John	2	9	The man in charge tasted the water ; it had now turned into wine ! He did not know where it had come from , but the servants who had drawn the water knew . So he called the bridegroom
CJB	John	2	10	and said to him , “ Everyone else serves the good wine first and the poorer wine after people have drunk freely . But you have kept the good wine until now ! ”
CJB	John	2	11	This , the first of Yeshua ’ s miraculous signs , he did at Kanah in the Galil ; he manifested his glory , and his talmidim came to trust in him .
CJB	John	2	12	Afterwards , he , his mother and brothers , and his talmidim went down to K ’ far-Nachum and stayed there a few days .
CJB	John	2	13	It was almost time for the festival of Pesach in Y ’ hudah , so Yeshua went up to Yerushalayim .
CJB	John	2	14	In the Temple grounds he found those who were selling cattle , sheep and pigeons , and others who were sitting at tables exchanging money .
CJB	John	2	15	He made a whip from cords and drove them all out of the Temple grounds , the sheep and cattle as well . He knocked over the money-changers ’ tables , scattering their coins ;
CJB	John	2	16	and to the pigeon-sellers he said , “ Get these things out of here ! How dare you turn my Father ’ s house into a market ? ”
CJB	John	2	17	( His talmidim later recalled that the Tanakh says , “ Zeal for your house will devour me. ” ) [ b ]
CJB	John	2	18	So the Judeans confronted him by asking him , “ What miraculous sign can you show us to prove you have the right to do all this ? ”
CJB	John	2	19	Yeshua answered them , “ Destroy this temple , and in three days I will raise it up again. ”
CJB	John	2	20	The Judeans said , “ It took
CJB	John	2	46	years to build this Temple , and you ’ re going to raise it in three days ? ”
CJB	John	2	21	But the “ temple ” he had spoken of was his body .
CJB	John	2	22	Therefore , when he was raised from the dead , his talmidim remembered that he had said this , and they trusted in the Tanakh and in what Yeshua had said .
CJB	John	2	23	Now while Yeshua was in Yerushalayim at the Pesach festival , there were many people who “ believed in his name ” when they saw the miracles he performed .
CJB	John	2	24	But he did not commit himself to them , for he knew what people are like —
CJB	John	2	25	that is , he didn ’ t need anyone to inform him about a person , because he knew what was in the person ’ s heart .
CJB	John	3	3	“ Yes , indeed , ” Yeshua answered him , “ I tell you that unless a person is born again from above , he can not see the Kingdom of God. ”
CJB	John	3	2	This man came to Yeshua by night and said to him , “ Rabbi , we know it is from God that you have come as a teacher ; for no one can do these miracles you perform unless God is with him. ”
CJB	John	3	4	Nakdimon said to him , “ How can a grown man be ‘ born ’ ? Can he go back into his mother ’ s womb and be born a second time ? ”
CJB	John	3	5	Yeshua answered , “ Yes , indeed , I tell you that unless a person is born from water and the Spirit , he can not enter the Kingdom of God .
CJB	John	3	6	What is born from the flesh is flesh , and what is born from the Spirit is spirit .
CJB	John	3	7	Stop being amazed at my telling you that you must be born again from above !
CJB	John	3	8	The wind blows where it wants to , and you hear its sound , but you don ’ t know where it comes from or where it ’ s going . That ’ s how it is with everyone who has been born from the Spirit. ”
CJB	John	3	9	Nakdimon replied , “ How can this happen ? ”
CJB	John	3	10	Yeshua answered him , “ You hold the office of teacher in Isra ’ el , and you don ’ t know this ?
CJB	John	3	11	Yes , indeed ! I tell you that what we speak about , we know ; and what we give evidence of , we have seen ; but you people don ’ t accept our evidence !
CJB	John	3	12	If you people don ’ t believe me when I tell you about the things of the world , how will you believe me when I tell you about the things of heaven ?
CJB	John	3	13	No one has gone up into heaven ; there is only the one who has come down from heaven , the Son of Man .
CJB	John	3	14	Just as Moshe lifted up the serpent in the desert , so must the Son of Man be lifted up ;
CJB	John	3	15	so that everyone who trusts in him may have eternal life .
CJB	John	3	16	“ For God so loved the world that he gave his only and unique Son , so that everyone who trusts in him may have eternal life , instead of being utterly destroyed .
CJB	John	3	17	For God did not send the Son into the world to judge the world , but rather so that through him , the world might be saved .
CJB	John	3	18	Those who trust in him are not judged ; those who do not trust have been judged already , in that they have not trusted in the one who is God ’ s only and unique Son .
CJB	John	3	19	“ Now this is the judgment : the light has come into the world , but people loved the darkness rather than the light . Why ? Because their actions were wicked .
CJB	John	3	20	For everyone who does evil things hates the light and avoids it , so that his actions won ’ t be exposed .
CJB	John	3	21	But everyone who does what is true comes to the light , so that all may see that his actions are accomplished through God. ”
CJB	John	3	22	After this , Yeshua and his talmidim went out into the countryside of Y ’ hudah , where he stayed awhile with them and immersed people .
CJB	John	3	23	Yochanan too was immersing at Einayim , near Shalem , because there was plenty of water there ; and people kept coming to be immersed .
CJB	John	3	24	( This was before Yochanan ’ s imprisonment . )
CJB	John	3	25	A discussion arose between some of Yochanan ’ s talmidim and a Judean about ceremonial washing ;
CJB	John	3	26	and they came to Yochanan and said to him , “ Rabbi , you know the man who was with you on the other side of the Yarden , the one you spoke about ? Well , here he is , immersing ; and everyone is going to him ! ”
CJB	John	3	27	Yochanan answered , “ No one can receive anything unless it has been given to him from Heaven .
CJB	John	3	28	You yourselves can confirm that I did not say I was the Messiah , but that I have been sent ahead of him .
CJB	John	3	29	The bridegroom is the one who has the bride ; but the bridegroom ’ s friend , who stands and listens to him , is overjoyed at the sound of the bridegroom ’ s voice . So this joy of mine is now complete .
CJB	John	3	30	He must become more important , while I become less important .
CJB	John	3	31	“ He who comes from above is above all . He who is from the earth is from the earth and talks from an earthly point of view ; he who comes from heaven is above all .
CJB	John	3	32	He testifies about what he has actually seen and heard , yet no one accepts what he says !
CJB	John	3	33	Whoever does accept what he says puts his seal on the fact that God is true ,
CJB	John	3	34	because the one whom God sent speaks God ’ s words . For God does not give him the Spirit in limited degree —
CJB	John	3	35	the Father loves the Son and has put everything in his hands .
CJB	John	3	36	Whoever trusts in the Son has eternal life . But whoever disobeys the Son will not see that life but remains subject to God ’ s wrath . ”
CJB	John	4	4	This meant that he had to pass through Shomron .
CJB	John	4	2	( although it was not Yeshua himself who immersed but his talmidim ) ,
CJB	John	4	3	Yeshua left Y ’ hudah and set out again for the Galil .
CJB	John	4	5	He came to a town in Shomron called Sh ’ khem , near the field Ya ‘ akov had given to his son Yosef .
CJB	John	4	6	Ya ‘ akov ’ s Well was there ; so Yeshua , exhausted from his travel , sat down by the well ; it was about noon .
CJB	John	4	7	A woman from Shomron came to draw some water ; and Yeshua said to her , “ Give me a drink of water. ”
CJB	John	4	8	( His talmidim had gone into town to buy food . )
CJB	John	4	9	The woman from Shomron said to him , “ How is it that you , a Jew , ask for water from me , a woman of Shomron ? ” ( For Jews don ’ t associate with people from Shomron . )
CJB	John	4	10	Yeshua answered her , “ If you knew God ’ s gift , that is , who it is saying to you , ‘ Give me a drink of water , ’ then you would have asked him ; and he would have given you living water. ”
CJB	John	4	11	She said to him , “ Sir , you don ’ t have a bucket , and the well is deep ; so where do you get this ‘ living water ’ ?
CJB	John	4	12	You aren ’ t greater than our father Ya ‘ akov , are you ? He gave us this well and drank from it , and so did his sons and his cattle. ”
CJB	John	4	13	Yeshua answered , “ Everyone who drinks this water will get thirsty again ,
CJB	John	4	14	but whoever drinks the water I will give him will never be thirsty again ! On the contrary , the water I give him will become a spring of water inside him , welling up into eternal life ! ”
CJB	John	4	15	“ Sir , give me this water , ” the woman said to him , “ so that I won ’ t have to be thirsty and keep coming here to draw water. ”
CJB	John	4	16	He said to her , “ Go , call your husband , and come back. ”
CJB	John	4	17	She answered , “ I don ’ t have a husband. ” Yeshua said to her , “ You ’ re right , you don ’ t have a husband !
CJB	John	4	18	You ’ ve had five husbands in the past , and you ’ re not married to the man you ’ re living with now ! You ’ ve spoken the truth ! ”
CJB	John	4	19	“ Sir , I can see that you are a prophet , ” the woman replied .
CJB	John	4	20	“ Our fathers worshipped on this mountain , but you people say that the place where one has to worship is in Yerushalayim. ”
CJB	John	4	21	Yeshua said , “ Lady , believe me , the time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Yerushalayim .
CJB	John	4	22	You people don ’ t know what you are worshipping ; we worship what we do know , because salvation comes from the Jews .
CJB	John	4	23	But the time is coming — indeed , it ’ s here now — when the true worshippers will worship the Father spiritually and truly , for these are the kind of people the Father wants worshipping him .
CJB	John	4	24	God is spirit ; and worshippers must worship him spiritually and truly. ”
CJB	John	4	25	The woman replied , “ I know that Mashiach is coming ” ( that is , “ the one who has been anointed ” ) . “ When he comes , he will tell us everything. ”
CJB	John	4	26	Yeshua said to her , “ I , the person speaking to you , am he. ”
CJB	John	4	27	Just then , his talmidim arrived . They were amazed that he was talking with a woman ; but none of them said , “ What do you want ? ” or , “ Why are you talking with her ? ”
CJB	John	4	28	So the woman left her water-jar , went back to the town and said to the people there ,
CJB	John	4	29	“ Come , see a man who told me everything I ’ ve ever done . Could it be that this is the Messiah ? ”
CJB	John	4	30	They left the town and began coming toward him .
CJB	John	4	31	Meanwhile , the talmidim were urging Yeshua , “ Rabbi , eat something. ”
CJB	John	4	32	But he answered , “ I have food to eat that you don ’ t know about. ”
CJB	John	4	33	At this , the talmidim asked one another , “ Could someone have brought him food ? ”
CJB	John	4	34	Yeshua said to them , “ My food is to do what the one who sent me wants and to bring his work to completion .
CJB	John	4	35	Don ’ t you have a saying , ‘ Four more months and then the harvest ’ ? Well , what I say to you is : open your eyes and look at the fields ! They ’ re already ripe for harvest !
CJB	John	4	36	The one who reaps receives his wages and gathers fruit for eternal life , so that the reaper and the sower may be glad together —
CJB	John	4	37	for in this matter , the proverb , ‘ One sows and another reaps , ’ holds true .
CJB	John	4	38	I sent you to reap what you haven ’ t worked for . Others have done the hard labor , and you have benefited from their work. ”
CJB	John	4	39	Many people from that town in Shomron put their trust in him because of the woman ’ s testimony , “ He told me all the things I did. ”
CJB	John	4	40	So when these people from Shomron came to him , they asked him to stay with them . He stayed two days ,
CJB	John	4	41	and many more came to trust because of what he said .
CJB	John	4	42	They said to the woman , “ We no longer trust because of what you said , because we have heard for ourselves . We know indeed that this man really is the Savior of the world. ”
CJB	John	4	43	After the two days , he went on from there toward the Galil .
CJB	John	4	44	Now Yeshua himself said , “ A prophet is not respected in his own country. ”
CJB	John	4	45	But when he arrived in the Galil , the people there welcomed him , because they had seen all he had done at the festival in Yerushalayim ; since they had been there too .
CJB	John	4	46	He went again to Kanah in the Galil , where he had turned the water into wine . An officer in the royal service was there ; his son was ill in K ’ far-Nachum .
CJB	John	4	47	This man , on hearing that Yeshua had come from Y ’ hudah to the Galil , went and asked him to come down and heal his son , for he was at the point of death .
CJB	John	4	48	Yeshua answered , “ Unless you people see signs and miracles , you simply will not trust ! ”
CJB	John	4	49	The officer said to him , “ Sir , come down before my child dies. ”
CJB	John	4	50	Yeshua replied , “ You may go , your son is alive. ” The man believed what Yeshua said and left .
CJB	John	4	51	As he was going down , his servants met him with the news that his son was alive
CJB	John	4	52	So he asked them at what time he had gotten better ; and they said , “ The fever left him yesterday at one o ’ clock in the afternoon. ”
CJB	John	4	53	The father knew that that was the very hour when Yeshua had told him , “ Your son is alive ” ; and he and all his household trusted .
CJB	John	4	54	This was a second sign that Yeshua did ; he did it after he had come from Y ’ hudah into the Galil .
CJB	John	5	5	One man was there who had been ill for thirty-eight years .
CJB	John	5	2	In Yerushalayim , by the Sheep Gate , is a pool called in Aramaic , Beit-Zata ,
CJB	John	5	3	in which lay a crowd of invalids — blind , lame , crippled .
CJB	John	5	4	for at certain times an angel of Adonai went down into the pool and disturbed the water , and whoever stepped into the water first after it was disturbed was healed of whatever disease he had .
CJB	John	5	6	Yeshua , seeing this man and knowing that he had been there a long time , said to him , “ Do you want to be healed ? ”
CJB	John	5	7	The sick man answered , “ I have no one to put me in the pool when the water is disturbed ; and while I ’ m trying to get there , someone goes in ahead of me. ”
CJB	John	5	8	Yeshua said to him , “ Get up , pick up your mat and walk ! ”
CJB	John	5	9	Immediately the man was healed , and he picked up his mat and walked . Now that day was Shabbat ,
CJB	John	5	10	so the Judeans said to the man who had been healed , “ It ’ s Shabbat ! It ’ s against Torah for you to carry your mat ! ”
CJB	John	5	11	But he answered them , “ The man who healed me — he ’ s the one who told me , ‘ Pick up your mat and walk. ’ ”
CJB	John	5	12	They asked him , “ Who is the man who told you to pick it up and walk ? ”
CJB	John	5	13	But the man who had been healed didn ’ t know who it was , because Yeshua had slipped away into the crowd .
CJB	John	5	14	Afterwards Yeshua found him in the Temple court and said to him , “ See , you are well ! Now stop sinning , or something worse may happen to you ! ”
CJB	John	5	15	The man went off and told the Judeans it was Yeshua who had healed him ;
CJB	John	5	16	and on account of this , the Judeans began harassing Yeshua because he did these things on Shabbat .
CJB	John	5	17	But he answered them , “ My Father has been working until now , and I too am working. ”
CJB	John	5	18	This answer made the Judeans all the more intent on killing him — not only was he breaking Shabbat ; but also , by saying that God was his own Father , he was claiming equality with God .
CJB	John	5	19	Therefore , Yeshua said this to them : “ Yes , indeed ! I tell you that the Son can not do anything on his own , but only what he sees the Father doing ; whatever the Father does , the Son does too .
CJB	John	5	20	For the Father loves the Son and shows him everything he does ; and he will show him even greater things than these , so that you will be amazed .
CJB	John	5	21	Just as the Father raises the dead and makes them alive , so too the Son makes alive anyone he wants .
CJB	John	5	22	The Father does not judge anyone but has entrusted all judgment to the Son ,
CJB	John	5	23	so that all may honor the Son as they honor the Father . Whoever fails to honor the Son is not honoring the Father who sent him .
CJB	John	5	24	Yes , indeed ! I tell you that whoever hears what I am saying and trusts the One who sent me has eternal life — that is , he will not come up for judgment but has already crossed over from death to life !
CJB	John	5	25	Yes , indeed ! I tell you that there is coming a time — in fact , it ’ s already here — when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God , and those who listen will come to life .
CJB	John	5	26	For just as the Father has life in himself , so he has given the Son life to have in himself .
CJB	John	5	27	Also he has given him authority to execute judgment , because he is the Son of Man .
CJB	John	5	28	Don ’ t be surprised at this ; because the time is coming when all who are in the grave will hear his voice
CJB	John	5	29	and come out — those who have done good to a resurrection of life , and those who have done evil to a resurrection of judgment .
CJB	John	5	30	I can ’ t do a thing on my own . As I hear , I judge ; and my judgment is right ; because I don ’ t seek my own desire , but the desire of the one who sent me .
CJB	John	5	31	“ If I testify on my own behalf , my testimony is not valid .
CJB	John	5	32	But there is someone else testifying on my behalf , and I know that the testimony he is making is valid —
CJB	John	5	33	you have sent to Yochanan , and he has testified to the truth .
CJB	John	5	34	Not that I collect human testimony ; rather , I say these things so that you might be saved .
CJB	John	5	35	He was a lamp burning and shining , and for a little while you were willing to bask in his light .
CJB	John	5	36	“ But I have a testimony that is greater than Yochanan ’ s . For the things the Father has given me to do , the very things I am doing now , testify on my behalf that the Father has sent me .
CJB	John	5	37	“ In addition , the Father who sent me has himself testified on my behalf . But you have never heard his voice or seen his shape ;
CJB	John	5	38	moreover , his word does not stay in you , because you don ’ t trust the one he sent .
CJB	John	5	39	You keep examining the Tanakh because you think that in it you have eternal life . Those very Scriptures bear witness to me ,
CJB	John	5	40	but you won ’ t come to me in order to have life !
CJB	John	5	41	“ I don ’ t collect praise from men ,
CJB	John	5	42	but I do know you people — I know that you have no love for God in you !
CJB	John	5	43	I have come in my Father ’ s name , and you don ’ t accept me ; if someone else comes in his own name , him you will accept .
CJB	John	5	44	How can you trust ? You ’ re busy collecting praise from each other , instead of seeking praise from God only .
CJB	John	5	45	“ But don ’ t think that it is I who will be your accuser before the Father . Do you know who will accuse you ? Moshe , the very one you have counted on !
CJB	John	5	46	For if you really believed Moshe , you would believe me ; because it was about me that he wrote .
CJB	John	5	47	But if you don ’ t believe what he wrote , how are you going to believe what I say ? ” Footnotes - John 5:4 Some manuscripts have verses 3b–4 : . . . , waiting for the water to move ;
CJB	John	6	6	( Now Yeshua said this to test Philip , for Yeshua himself knew what he was about to do . )
CJB	John	6	2	and a large crowd followed him , because they had seen the miracles he had performed on the sick .
CJB	John	6	3	Yeshua went up into the hills and sat down there with his talmidim .
CJB	John	6	4	Now the Judean festival of Pesach was coming up ;
CJB	John	6	5	so when Yeshua looked up and saw that a large crowd was approaching , he said to Philip , “ Where will we be able to buy bread , so that these people can eat ? ”
CJB	John	6	7	Philip answered , “ Half a year ’ s wages wouldn ’ t buy enough bread for them — each one would get only a bite ! ”
CJB	John	6	8	One of the talmidim , Andrew the brother of Shim ‘ on Kefa , said to him ,
CJB	John	6	9	“ There ’ s a young fellow here who has five loaves of barley bread and two fish . But how far will they go among so many ? ”
CJB	John	6	10	Yeshua said , “ Have the people sit down. ” There was a lot of grass there , so they sat down . The number of men was about five thousand .
CJB	John	6	11	Then Yeshua took the loaves of bread , and , after making a b ’ rakhah , gave to all who were sitting there , and likewise with the fish , as much as they wanted .
CJB	John	6	12	After they had eaten their fill , he told his talmidim , “ Gather the leftover pieces , so that nothing gets wasted. ”
CJB	John	6	13	They gathered them and filled twelve baskets with the pieces from the five barley loaves left by those who had eaten .
CJB	John	6	14	When the people saw the miracle he had performed , they said , “ This has to be ‘ the prophet ’ who is supposed to come into the world. ”
CJB	John	6	15	Yeshua knew that they were on the point of coming and seizing him , in order to make him king ; so he went back to the hills again . This time he went by himself .
CJB	John	6	16	When evening came , his talmidim went down to the lake ,
CJB	John	6	17	got into a boat and set out across the lake toward K ’ far-Nachum . By now it was dark , Yeshua had not yet joined them ,
CJB	John	6	18	and the sea was getting rough , because a strong wind was blowing .
CJB	John	6	19	They had rowed three or four miles when they saw Yeshua approaching the boat , walking on the lake ! They were terrified ;
CJB	John	6	20	but he said to them , “ Stop being afraid , it is I. ”
CJB	John	6	21	Then they were willing to take him into the boat , and instantly the boat reached the land they were heading for .
CJB	John	6	22	The next day , the crowd which had stayed on the other side of the lake noticed that there had been only one boat there , and that Yeshua had not entered the boat with his talmidim , but that the talmidim had been alone when they sailed off .
CJB	John	6	23	Then other boats , from Tiberias , came ashore near the place where they had eaten the bread after the Lord had made the b ’ rakhah .
CJB	John	6	24	Accordingly , when the crowd saw that neither Yeshua nor his talmidim were there , they themselves boarded the boats and made for K ’ far-Nachum in search of Yeshua .
CJB	John	6	25	When they found him on the other side of the lake , they asked him , “ Rabbi , when did you get here ? ”
CJB	John	6	26	Yeshua answered , “ Yes , indeed ! I tell you , you ’ re not looking for me because you saw miraculous signs , but because you ate the bread and had all you wanted !
CJB	John	6	27	Don ’ t work for the food which passes away but for the food that stays on into eternal life , which the Son of Man will give you . For this is the one on whom God the Father has put his seal. ”
CJB	John	6	28	So they said to him , “ What should we do in order to perform the works of God ? ”
CJB	John	6	29	Yeshua answered , “ Here ’ s what the work of God is : to trust in the one he sent ! ”
CJB	John	6	30	They said to him , “ Nu , what miracle will you do for us , so that we may see it and trust you ? What work can you perform ?
CJB	John	6	31	Our fathers ate man in the desert — as it says in the Tanakh , ‘ He gave them bread from heaven to eat. ’ [ a ]
CJB	John	6	32	Yeshua said to them , “ Yes , indeed ! I tell you it wasn ’ t Moshe who gave you the bread from heaven . But my Father is giving you the genuine bread from heaven ;
CJB	John	6	33	for God ’ s bread is the one who comes down out of heaven and gives life to the world. ”
CJB	John	6	34	They said to him , “ Sir , give us this bread from now on. ”
CJB	John	6	35	Yeshua answered , “ I am the bread which is life ! Whoever comes to me will never go hungry , and whoever trusts in me will never be thirsty .
CJB	John	6	36	I told you that you have seen but still don ’ t trust .
CJB	John	6	37	Everyone the Father gives me will come to me , and whoever comes to me I will certainly not turn away .
CJB	John	6	38	For I have come down from heaven to do not my own will but the will of the One who sent me .
CJB	John	6	39	And this is the will of the One who sent me : that I should not lose any of all those he has given me but should raise them up on the Last Day .
CJB	John	6	40	Yes , this is the will of my Father : that all who see the Son and trust in him should have eternal life , and that I should raise them up on the Last Day. ”
CJB	John	6	41	At this the Judeans began grumbling about him because he said , “ I am the bread which has come down from heaven. ”
CJB	John	6	42	They said , “ Isn ’ t this Yeshua Ben-Yosef ? We know his father and mother ! How can he now say , ‘ I have come down from heaven ’ ? ”
CJB	John	6	43	Yeshua answered them , “ Stop grumbling to each other !
CJB	John	6	44	No one can come to me unless the Father — the One who sent me — draws him . And I will raise him up on the Last Day .
CJB	John	6	45	It is written in the Prophets , ‘ They will all be taught by Adonai. ’ [ b ] Everyone who listens to the Father and learns from him comes to me .
CJB	John	6	46	Not that anyone has seen the Father except the one who is from God — he has seen the Father .
CJB	John	6	47	Yes , indeed ! I tell you , whoever trusts has eternal life :
CJB	John	6	48	I am the bread which is life .
CJB	John	6	49	Your fathers ate the man in the desert ; they died .
CJB	John	6	50	But the bread that comes down from heaven is such that a person may eat it and not die .
CJB	John	6	51	I am the living bread that has come down from heaven ; if anyone eats this bread , he will live forever . Furthermore , the bread that I will give is my own flesh ; and I will give it for the life of the world. ”
CJB	John	6	52	At this , the Judeans disputed with one another , saying , “ How can this man give us his flesh to eat ? ”
CJB	John	6	53	Then Yeshua said to them , “ Yes , indeed ! I tell you that unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood , you do not have life in yourselves .
CJB	John	6	54	Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life — that is , I will raise him up on the Last Day .
CJB	John	6	55	For my flesh is true food , and my blood is true drink .
CJB	John	6	56	Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood lives in me , and I live in him .
CJB	John	6	57	Just as the living Father sent me , and I live through the Father , so also whoever eats me will live through me .
CJB	John	6	58	So this is the bread that has come down from heaven — it is not like the bread the fathers ate ; they ’ re dead , but whoever eats this bread will live forever ! ”
CJB	John	6	59	He said these things as he was teaching in a synagogue in K ’ far-Nachum .
CJB	John	6	60	On hearing it , many of his talmidim said , “ This is a hard word — who can bear to listen to it ? ”
CJB	John	6	61	But Yeshua , aware that his talmidim were grumbling about this , said to them , “ This is a trap for you ?
CJB	John	6	62	Suppose you were to see the Son of Man going back up to where he was before ?
CJB	John	6	63	It is the Spirit who gives life , the flesh is no help . The words I have spoken to you are Spirit and life ,
CJB	John	6	64	yet some among you do not trust. ” ( For Yeshua knew from the outset which ones would not trust him , also which one would betray him . )
CJB	John	6	65	“ This , ” he said , “ is why I told you that no one can come to me unless the Father has made it possible for him. ”
CJB	John	6	66	From this time on , many of his talmidim turned back and no longer traveled around with him .
CJB	John	6	67	So Yeshua said to the Twelve , “ Don ’ t you want to leave too ? ”
CJB	John	6	68	Shim ‘ on Kefa answered him , “ Lord , to whom would we go ? You have the word of eternal life .
CJB	John	6	69	We have trusted , and we know that you are the Holy One of God. ”
CJB	John	6	70	Yeshua answered them , “ Didn ’ t I choose you , the Twelve ? Yet one of you is an adversary. ”
CJB	John	6	71	( He was speaking of Y ’ hudah Ben-Shim ‘ on , from K ’ riot ; for this man — one of the Twelve ! — was soon to betray him . )
CJB	John	7	7	The world can ’ t hate you , but it does hate me , because I keep telling it how wicked its ways are .
CJB	John	7	2	But the festival of Sukkot in Y ’ hudah was near ;
CJB	John	7	3	so his brothers said to him , “ Leave here and go into Y ’ hudah , so that your talmidim can see the miracles you do ;
CJB	John	7	4	for no one who wants to become known acts in secret . If you ’ re doing these things , show yourself to the world ! ”
CJB	John	7	5	( His brothers spoke this way because they had not put their trust in him . )
CJB	John	7	6	Yeshua said to them , “ My time has not yet come ; but for you , any time is right .
CJB	John	7	8	You , go on up to the festival ; as for me , I am not going up to this festival now , because the right time for me has not yet come. ”
CJB	John	7	9	Having said this , he stayed on in the Galil .
CJB	John	7	10	But after his brothers had gone up to the festival , he too went up , not publicly but in secret .
CJB	John	7	11	At the festival , the Judeans were looking for him . “ Where is he ? ” they asked .
CJB	John	7	12	And among the crowds there was much whispering about him . Some said , “ He ’ s a good man ” ; but others said , “ No , he is deceiving the masses. ”
CJB	John	7	13	However , no one spoke about him openly , for fear of the Judeans .
CJB	John	7	14	Not until the festival was half over did Yeshua go up to the Temple courts and begin to teach .
CJB	John	7	15	The Judeans were surprised : “ How does this man know so much without having studied ? ” they asked .
CJB	John	7	16	So Yeshua gave them an answer : “ My teaching is not my own , it comes from the One who sent me .
CJB	John	7	17	If anyone wants to do his will , he will know whether my teaching is from God or I speak on my own .
CJB	John	7	18	A person who speaks on his own is trying to win praise for himself ; but a person who tries to win praise for the one who sent him is honest , there is nothing false about him .
CJB	John	7	19	Didn ’ t Moshe give you the Torah ? Yet not one of you obeys the Torah ! Why are you out to kill me ? ”
CJB	John	7	20	“ You have a demon ! ” the crowd answered . “ Who ’ s out to kill you ? ”
CJB	John	7	21	Yeshua answered them , “ I did one thing ; and because of this , all of you are amazed .
CJB	John	7	22	Moshe gave you b ’ rit-milah — not that it came from Moshe but from the Patriarchs — and you do a boy ’ s b ’ rit-milah on Shabbat .
CJB	John	7	23	If a boy is circumcised on Shabbat so that the Torah of Moshe will not be broken , why are you angry with me because I made a man ’ s whole body well on Shabbat ?
CJB	John	7	24	Stop judging by surface appearances , and judge the right way ! ”
CJB	John	7	25	Some of the Yerushalayim people said , “ Isn ’ t this the man they ’ re out to kill ?
CJB	John	7	26	Yet here he is , speaking openly ; and they don ’ t say anything to him . It couldn ’ t be , could it , that the authorities have actually concluded he ’ s the Messiah ?
CJB	John	7	27	Surely not — we know where this man comes from ; but when the Messiah comes , no one will know where he comes from. ”
CJB	John	7	28	Whereupon Yeshua , continuing to teach in the Temple courts , cried out , “ Indeed you do know me ! And you know where I ’ m from ! And I have not come on my own ! The One who sent me is real . But him you don ’ t know !
CJB	John	7	29	I do know him , because I am with him , and he sent me ! ”
CJB	John	7	30	At this , they tried to arrest him ; but no one laid a hand on him ; because his time had not yet come .
CJB	John	7	31	However , many in the crowd put their trust in him and said , “ When the Messiah comes , will he do more miracles than this man has done ? ”
CJB	John	7	32	The P ’ rushim heard the crowd whispering these things about Yeshua ; so the head cohanim and the P ’ rushim sent some of the Temple guards to arrest him .
CJB	John	7	33	Yeshua said , “ I will be with you only a little while longer ; then I will go away to the One who sent me .
CJB	John	7	34	You will look for me and not find me ; indeed , where I am , you can not come. ”
CJB	John	7	35	The Judeans said to themselves , “ Where is this man about to go , that we won ’ t find him ? Does he intend to go to the Greek Diaspora and teach the Greek-speaking Jews ?
CJB	John	7	36	And when he says , ‘ You will look for me and not find me ; indeed , where I am , you can not come ’ — what does he mean ? ”
CJB	John	7	37	Now on the last day of the festival , Hoshana Rabbah , Yeshua stood and cried out , “ If anyone is thirsty , let him keep coming to me and drinking !
CJB	John	7	38	Whoever puts his trust in me , as the Scripture says , rivers of living water will flow from his inmost being ! ”
CJB	John	7	39	( Now he said this about the Spirit , whom those who trusted in him were to receive later — the Spirit had not yet been given , because Yeshua had not yet been glorified . )
CJB	John	7	40	On hearing his words , some people in the crowd said , “ Surely this man is ‘ the prophet ’ ” ;
CJB	John	7	41	others said , “ This is the Messiah. ” But others said , “ How can the Messiah come from the Galil ?
CJB	John	7	42	Doesn ’ t the Tanakh say that the Messiah is from the seed of David [ a ] and comes from Beit-Lechem , [ b ] the village where David lived ? ”
CJB	John	7	43	So the people were divided because of him .
CJB	John	7	44	Some wanted to arrest him , but no one laid a hand on him .
CJB	John	7	45	The guards came back to the head cohanim and the P ’ rushim , who asked them , “ Why didn ’ t you bring him in ? ”
CJB	John	7	46	The guards replied , “ No one ever spoke the way this man speaks ! ”
CJB	John	7	47	“ You mean you ’ ve been taken in as well ? ” the P ’ rushim retorted .
CJB	John	7	48	“ Has any of the authorities trusted him ? Or any of the P ’ rushim ? No !
CJB	John	7	49	True , these ‘ am-ha ’ aretz do , but they know nothing about the Torah , they are under a curse ! ”
CJB	John	7	50	Nakdimon , the man who had gone to Yeshua before and was one of them , said to them ,
CJB	John	7	51	“ Our Torah doesn ’ t condemn a man — does it ? — until after hearing from him and finding out what he ’ s doing. ”
CJB	John	7	52	They replied , “ You aren ’ t from the Galil too , are you ? Study the Tanakh , and see for yourself that no prophet comes from the Galil ! ” [ c ]
CJB	John	7	53	Then they all left , each one to his own home .
CJB	John	8	8	Then he bent down and wrote in the dust again .
CJB	John	8	2	At daybreak , he appeared again in the Temple Court , where all the people gathered around him , and he sat down to teach them .
CJB	John	8	3	The Torah-teachers and the P ’ rushim brought in a woman who had been caught committing adultery and made her stand in the center of the group .
CJB	John	8	4	Then they said to him , “ Rabbi , this woman was caught in the very act of committing adultery .
CJB	John	8	5	Now in our Torah , Moshe commanded that such a woman be stoned to death . What do you say about it ? ”
CJB	John	8	6	They said this to trap him , so that they might have ground for bringing charges against him ; but Yeshua bent down and began writing in the dust with his finger .
CJB	John	8	7	When they kept questioning him , he straightened up and said to them , “ The one of you who is without sin , let him be the first to throw a stone at her. ”
CJB	John	8	9	On hearing this , they began to leave , one by one , the older ones first , until he was left alone , with the woman still there .
CJB	John	8	10	Standing up , Yeshua said to her , “ Where are they ? Has no one condemned you ? ”
CJB	John	8	11	She said , “ No one , sir. ” Yeshua said , “ Neither do I condemn you . Now go , and don ’ t sin any more. ”
CJB	John	8	12	Yeshua spoke to them again : “ I am the light of the world ; whoever follows me will never walk in darkness but will have the light which gives life. ”
CJB	John	8	13	So the P ’ rushim said to him , “ Now you ’ re testifying on your own behalf ; your testimony is not valid. ”
CJB	John	8	14	Yeshua answered them , “ Even if I do testify on my own behalf , my testimony is indeed valid ; because I know where I came from and where I ’ m going ; but you do not know where I came from or where I ’ m going .
CJB	John	8	15	You judge by merely human standards . As for me , I pass judgment on no one ;
CJB	John	8	16	but if I were indeed to pass judgment , my judgment would be valid ; because it is not I alone who judge , but I and the One who sent me .
CJB	John	8	17	And even in your Torah it is written that the testimony of two people is valid .
CJB	John	8	18	I myself testify on my own behalf , and so does the Father who sent me. ”
CJB	John	8	19	They said to him , “ Where is this ‘ father ’ of yours ? ” Yeshua answered , “ You know neither me nor my Father ; if you knew me , you would know my Father too. ”
CJB	John	8	20	He said these things when he was teaching in the Temple treasury room ; yet no one arrested him , because his time had not yet come .
CJB	John	8	21	Again he told them , “ I am going away , and you will look for me , but you will die in your sin — where I am going , you can not come. ”
CJB	John	8	22	The Judeans said , “ Is he going to commit suicide ? Is that what he means when he says , ‘ Where I am going , you can not come ’ ? ”
CJB	John	8	23	Yeshua said to them , “ You are from below , I am from above ; you are of this world , I am not of this world .
CJB	John	8	24	This is why I said to you that you will die in your sins ; for if you do not trust that I AM [ who I say I am ] , you will die in your sins. ”
CJB	John	8	25	At this , they said to him , “ You ? Who are you ? ” Yeshua answered , “ Just what I ’ ve been telling you from the start .
CJB	John	8	26	There are many things I could say about you , and many judgments I could make . However , the One who sent me is true ; so I say in the world only what I have heard from him. ”
CJB	John	8	27	They did not understand that he was talking to them about the Father .
CJB	John	8	28	So Yeshua said , “ When you lift up the Son of Man , then you will know that I AM [ who I say I am ] , and that of myself I do nothing , but say only what the Father has taught me .
CJB	John	8	29	Also , the One who sent me is still with me ; he did not leave me to myself , because I always do what pleases him. ”
CJB	John	8	30	Many people who heard him say these things trusted in him .
CJB	John	8	31	So Yeshua said to the Judeans who had trusted him , “ If you obey what I say , then you are really my talmidim ,
CJB	John	8	32	you will know the truth , and the truth will set you free. ”
CJB	John	8	33	They answered , “ We are the seed of Avraham and have never been slaves to anyone ; so what do you mean by saying , ‘ You will be set free ’ ? ”
CJB	John	8	34	Yeshua answered them , “ Yes , indeed ! I tell you that everyone who practices sin is a slave of sin .
CJB	John	8	35	Now a slave does not remain with a family forever , but a son does remain with it forever .
CJB	John	8	36	So if the Son frees you , you will really be free !
CJB	John	8	37	I know you are the seed of Avraham . Yet you are out to kill me , because what I am saying makes no headway in you .
CJB	John	8	38	I say what my Father has shown me ; you do what your father has told you ! ”
CJB	John	8	39	They answered him , “ Our father is Avraham. ” Yeshua replied , “ If you are children of Avraham , then do the things Avraham did !
CJB	John	8	40	As it is , you are out to kill me , a man who has told you the truth which I heard from God . Avraham did nothing like that !
CJB	John	8	41	You are doing the things your father does. ” “ We ’ re not illegitimate children ! ” they said to him . “ We have only one Father — God ! ”
CJB	John	8	42	Yeshua replied to them , “ If God were your Father , you would love me ; because I came out from God ; and now I have arrived here . I did not come on my own ; he sent me .
CJB	John	8	43	Why don ’ t you understand what I ’ m saying ? Because you can ’ t bear to listen to my message .
CJB	John	8	44	You belong to your father , Satan , and you want to carry out your father ’ s desires . From the start he was a murderer , and he has never stood by the truth , because there is no truth in him . When he tells a lie , he is speaking in character ; because he is a liar — indeed , the inventor of the lie !
CJB	John	8	45	But as for me , because I tell the truth you don ’ t believe me .
CJB	John	8	46	Which one of you can show me where I ’ m wrong ? If I ’ m telling the truth , why don ’ t you believe me ?
CJB	John	8	47	Whoever belongs to God listens to what God says ; the reason you don ’ t listen is that you don ’ t belong to God. ”
CJB	John	8	48	The Judeans answered him , “ Aren ’ t we right in saying you are from Shomron and have a demon ? ”
CJB	John	8	49	Yeshua replied , “ Me ? I have no demon . I am honoring my Father . But you dishonor me .
CJB	John	8	50	I am not seeking praise for myself . There is One who is seeking it , and he is the judge .
CJB	John	8	51	Yes , indeed ! I tell you that whoever obeys my teaching will never see death. ”
CJB	John	8	52	The Judeans said to him , “ Now we know for sure that you have a demon ! Avraham died , and so did the prophets ; yet you say , ‘ Whoever obeys my teaching will never taste death. ’
CJB	John	8	53	Avraham avinu died ; you aren ’ t greater than he , are you ? And the prophets also died . Who do you think you are ? ”
CJB	John	8	54	Yeshua answered , “ If I praise myself , my praise counts for nothing . The One who is praising me is my Father , the very one about whom you keep saying , ‘ He is our God. ’
CJB	John	8	55	Now you have not known him , but I do know him ; indeed , if I were to say that I don ’ t know him , I would be a liar like you ! But I do know him , and I obey his word .
CJB	John	8	56	Avraham , your father , was glad that he would see my day ; then he saw it and was overjoyed. ”
CJB	John	8	57	“ Why , you ’ re not yet fifty years old , ” the Judeans replied , “ and you have seen Avraham ? ”
CJB	John	8	58	Yeshua said to them , “ Yes , indeed ! Before Avraham came into being , I AM ! ”
CJB	John	8	59	At this , they picked up stones to throw at him ; but Yeshua was hidden and left the Temple grounds .
CJB	John	9	9	Some said , “ Yes , he ’ s the one ” ; while others said , “ No , but he looks like him. ” However , he himself said , “ I ’ m the one. ”
CJB	John	9	2	His talmidim asked him , “ Rabbi , who sinned — this man or his parents — to cause him to be born blind ? ”
CJB	John	9	3	Yeshua answered , “ His blindness is due neither to his sin nor to that of his parents ; it happened so that God ’ s power might be seen at work in him .
CJB	John	9	4	As long as it is day , we must keep doing the work of the One who sent me ; the night is coming , when no one can work .
CJB	John	9	5	While I am in the world , I am the light of the world. ”
CJB	John	9	6	Having said this , he spit on the ground , made some mud with the saliva , put the mud on the man ’ s eyes ,
CJB	John	9	7	and said to him , “ Go , wash off in the Pool of Shiloach ! ” ( The name means “ sent. ” ) So he went and washed and came away seeing .
CJB	John	9	8	His neighbors and those who previously had seen him begging said , “ Isn ’ t this the man who used to sit and beg ? ”
CJB	John	9	10	“ How were your eyes opened ? ” they asked him .
CJB	John	9	11	He answered , “ The man called Yeshua made mud , put it on my eyes , and told me , ‘ Go to Shiloach and wash ! ’ So I went ; and as soon as I had washed , I could see. ”
CJB	John	9	12	They said to him , “ Where is he ? ” and he replied , “ I don ’ t know. ”
CJB	John	9	13	They took the man who had been blind to the P ’ rushim .
CJB	John	9	14	Now the day on which Yeshua had made the mud and opened his eyes was Shabbat .
CJB	John	9	15	So the P ’ rushim asked him again how he had become able to see ; and he told them , “ He put mud on my eyes , then I washed , and now I can see. ”
CJB	John	9	16	At this , some of the P ’ rushim said , “ This man is not from God , because he doesn ’ t keep Shabbat. ” But others said , “ How could a man who is a sinner do miracles like these ? ” And there was a split among them .
CJB	John	9	17	So once more they spoke to the blind man : “ Since you ’ re the one whose eyes he opened , what do you say about him ? ” He replied : “ He is a prophet. ”
CJB	John	9	18	The Judeans , however , were unwilling to believe that he had formerly been blind , but now could see , until they had summoned the man ’ s parents .
CJB	John	9	19	They asked them , “ Is this your son , who you say was born blind ? How is it that now he can see ? ”
CJB	John	9	20	His parents answered , “ We know that this is our son and that he was born blind ;
CJB	John	9	21	but how it is that he can see now , we don ’ t know ; nor do we know who opened his eyes . Ask him — he ’ s old enough , he can speak for himself ! ”
CJB	John	9	22	The parents said this because they were afraid of the Judeans , for the Judeans had already agreed that anyone who acknowledged Yeshua as the Messiah would be banned from the synagogue .
CJB	John	9	23	This is why his parents said , “ He ’ s old enough , ask him. ”
CJB	John	9	24	So a second time they called the man who had been blind ; and they said to him , “ Swear to God that you will tell the truth ! We know that this man is a sinner. ”
CJB	John	9	25	He answered , “ Whether he ’ s a sinner or not I don ’ t know . One thing I do know : I was blind , now I see. ”
CJB	John	9	26	So they said to him , “ What did he do to you ? How did he open your eyes ? ”
CJB	John	9	27	“ I already told you , ” he answered , “ and you didn ’ t listen . Why do you want to hear it again ? Maybe you too want to become his talmidim ? ”
CJB	John	9	28	Then they railed at him . “ You may be his talmid , ” they said , “ but we are talmidim of Moshe !
CJB	John	9	29	We know that God has spoken to Moshe , but as for this fellow — we don ’ t know where he ’ s from ! ”
CJB	John	9	30	“ What a strange thing , ” the man answered , “ that you don ’ t know where he ’ s from — considering that he opened my eyes !
CJB	John	9	31	We know that God doesn ’ t listen to sinners ; but if anyone fears God and does his will , God does listen to him .
CJB	John	9	32	In all history no one has ever heard of someone ’ s opening the eyes of a man born blind .
CJB	John	9	33	If this man were not from God , he couldn ’ t do a thing ! ”
CJB	John	9	34	“ Why , you mamzer ! ” they retorted , “ Are you lecturing us ? ” And they threw him out .
CJB	John	9	35	Yeshua heard that they had thrown the man out . He found him and said , “ Do you trust in the Son of Man ? ”
CJB	John	9	36	“ Sir , ” he answered , “ tell me who he is , so that I can trust in him. ”
CJB	John	9	37	Yeshua said to him , “ You have seen him . In fact , he ’ s the one speaking with you now. ”
CJB	John	9	38	“ Lord , I trust ! ” he said , and he kneeled down in front of him .
CJB	John	9	39	Yeshua said , “ It is to judge that I came into this world , so that those who do not see might see , and those who do see might become blind. ”
CJB	John	9	40	Some of the P ’ rushim nearby heard this and said to him , “ So we ’ re blind too , are we ? ”
CJB	John	9	41	Yeshua answered them , “ If you were blind , you would not be guilty of sin . But since you still say , ‘ We see , ’ your guilt remains .
CJB	John	10	10	The thief comes only in order to steal , kill and destroy ; I have come so that they may have life , life in its fullest measure .
CJB	John	10	2	But the one who goes in through the gate is the sheep ’ s own shepherd .
CJB	John	10	3	This is the one the gate-keeper admits , and the sheep hear his voice . He calls his own sheep , each one by name , and leads them out .
CJB	John	10	4	After taking out all that are his own , he goes on ahead of them ; and the sheep follow him because they recognize his voice .
CJB	John	10	5	They never follow a stranger but will run away from him , because strangers ’ voices are unfamiliar to them. ”
CJB	John	10	6	Yeshua used this indirect manner of speaking with them , but they didn ’ t understand what he was talking to them about .
CJB	John	10	7	So Yeshua said to them again , “ Yes , indeed ! I tell you that I am the gate for the sheep .
CJB	John	10	8	All those who have come before me have been thieves and robbers , but the sheep didn ’ t listen to them .
CJB	John	10	9	I am the gate ; if someone enters through me , he will be safe and will go in and out and find pasture .
CJB	John	10	11	“ I am the good shepherd . The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep .
CJB	John	10	12	The hired hand , since he isn ’ t a shepherd and the sheep aren ’ t his own , sees the wolf coming , abandons the sheep and runs away . Then the wolf drags them off and scatters them .
CJB	John	10	13	The hired worker behaves like this because that ’ s all he is , a hired worker ; so it doesn ’ t matter to him what happens to the sheep .
CJB	John	10	14	I am the good shepherd ; I know my own , and my own know me —
CJB	John	10	15	just as the Father knows me , and I know the Father — and I lay down my life on behalf of the sheep .
CJB	John	10	16	Also I have other sheep which are not from this pen ; I need to bring them , and they will hear my voice ; and there will be one flock , one shepherd .
CJB	John	10	17	“ This is why the Father loves me : because I lay down my life — in order to take it up again !
CJB	John	10	18	No one takes it away from me ; on the contrary , I lay it down of my own free will . I have the power to lay it down , and I have the power to take it up again . This is what my Father commanded me to do. ”
CJB	John	10	19	Again there was a split among the Judeans because of what he said .
CJB	John	10	20	Many of them said , “ He has a demon ! ” and “ He ’ s meshugga ! Why do you listen to him ? ”
CJB	John	10	21	Others said , “ These are not the deeds of a man who is demonized — how can a demon open blind people ’ s eyes ? ”
CJB	John	10	22	Then came Hanukkah in Yerushalayim . It was winter ,
CJB	John	10	23	and Yeshua was walking around inside the Temple area , in Shlomo ’ s Colonnade .
CJB	John	10	24	So the Judeans surrounded him and said to him , “ How much longer are you going to keep us in suspense ? If you are the Messiah , tell us publicly ! ”
CJB	John	10	25	Yeshua answered them , “ I have already told you , and you don ’ t trust me . The works I do in my Father ’ s name testify on my behalf ,
CJB	John	10	26	but the reason you don ’ t trust is that you are not included among my sheep .
CJB	John	10	27	My sheep listen to my voice , I recognize them , they follow me ,
CJB	John	10	28	and I give them eternal life . They will absolutely never be destroyed , and no one will snatch them from my hands .
CJB	John	10	29	My Father , who gave them to me , is greater than all ; and no one can snatch them from the Father ’ s hands .
CJB	John	10	30	I and the Father are one. ”
CJB	John	10	31	Once again the Judeans picked up rocks in order to stone him .
CJB	John	10	32	Yeshua answered them , “ You have seen me do many good deeds that reflect the Father ’ s power ; for which one of these deeds are you stoning me ? ”
CJB	John	10	33	The Judeans replied , “ We are not stoning you for any good deed , but for blasphemy — because you , who are only a man , are making yourself out to be God [ a ] . ”
CJB	John	10	34	Yeshua answered them , “ Isn ’ t it written in your Torah , ‘ I have said , “ You people are Elohim ’ ” ? [ b ]
CJB	John	10	35	If he called ‘ elohim ’ the people to whom the word of Elohim was addressed ( and the Tanakh can not be broken ) ,
CJB	John	10	36	then are you telling the one whom the Father set apart as holy and sent into the world , ‘ You are committing blasphemy , ’ just because I said , ‘ I am a son of Elohim ’ ?
CJB	John	10	37	“ If I am not doing deeds that reflect my Father ’ s power , don ’ t trust me .
CJB	John	10	38	But if I am , then , even if you don ’ t trust me , trust the deeds ; so that you may understand once and for all that the Father is united with me , and I am united with the Father. ”
CJB	John	10	39	One more time they tried to arrest him , but he slipped out of their hands .
CJB	John	10	40	He went off again beyond the Yarden , where Yochanan had been immersing at first , and stayed there .
CJB	John	10	41	Many people came to him and said , “ Yochanan performed no miracles , but everything Yochanan said about this man was true. ”
CJB	John	10	42	And many people there put their trust in him . Footnotes - John 10:33 Hebrew : Elohim - John 10:34 Psalm 82:6
CJB	John	11	11	Yeshua said these things , and afterwards he said to the talmidim , “ Our friend El ‘ azar has gone to sleep ; but I am going in order to wake him up. ”
CJB	John	11	2	( This Miryam , whose brother El ‘ azar had become sick , is the one who poured perfume on the Lord and wiped his feet with her hair . )
CJB	John	11	3	So the sisters sent a message to Yeshua , “ Lord , the man you love is sick. ”
CJB	John	11	4	On hearing it , he said , “ This sickness will not end in death . No , it is for God ’ s glory , so that the Son of God may receive glory through it. ”
CJB	John	11	5	Yeshua loved Marta and her sister and El ‘ azar ;
CJB	John	11	6	so when he heard he was sick , first he stayed where he was two more days ;
CJB	John	11	7	then , after this , he said to the talmidim , “ Let ’ s go back to Y ’ hudah. ”
CJB	John	11	8	The talmidim replied , “ Rabbi ! Just a short while ago the Judeans were out to stone you — and you want to go back there ? ”
CJB	John	11	9	Yeshua answered , “ Aren ’ t there twelve hours of daylight ? If a person walks during daylight , he doesn ’ t stumble ; because he sees the light of this world .
CJB	John	11	10	But if a person walks at night , he does stumble ; because he has no light with him. ”
CJB	John	11	12	The talmidim said to him , “ Lord , if he has gone to sleep , he will get better. ”
CJB	John	11	13	Now Yeshua had used the phrase to speak about El ‘ azar ’ s death , but they thought he had been talking literally about sleep .
CJB	John	11	14	So Yeshua told them in plain language , “ El ‘ azar has died .
CJB	John	11	15	And for your sakes , I am glad that I wasn ’ t there , so that you may come to trust . But let ’ s go to him. ”
CJB	John	11	16	Then T ’ oma ( the name means “ twin ” ) said to his fellow talmidim , “ Yes , we should go , so that we can die with him ! ”
CJB	John	11	17	On arrival , Yeshua found that El ‘ azar had already been in the tomb for four days .
CJB	John	11	18	Now Beit-Anyah was about two miles from Yerushalayim ,
CJB	John	11	19	and many of the Judeans had come to Marta and Miryam in order to comfort them at the loss of their brother .
CJB	John	11	20	So when Marta heard that Yeshua was coming , she went out to meet him ; but Miryam continued sitting shiv ‘ ah in the house .
CJB	John	11	21	Marta said to Yeshua , “ Lord , if you had been here , my brother would not have died .
CJB	John	11	22	Even now I know that whatever you ask of God , God will give you. ”
CJB	John	11	23	Yeshua said to her , “ Your brother will rise again. ”
CJB	John	11	24	Marta said , “ I know that he will rise again at the Resurrection on the Last Day. ”
CJB	John	11	25	Yeshua said to her , “ I AM the Resurrection and the Life ! Whoever puts his trust in me will live , even if he dies ;
CJB	John	11	26	and everyone living and trusting in me will never die . Do you believe this ? ”
CJB	John	11	27	She said to him , “ Yes , Lord , I believe that you are the Messiah , the Son of God , the one coming into the world. ”
CJB	John	11	28	After saying this , she went off and secretly called Miryam , her sister : “ The Rabbi is here and is calling for you. ”
CJB	John	11	29	When she heard this , she jumped up and went to him .
CJB	John	11	30	Yeshua had not yet come into the village but was still where Marta had met him ;
CJB	John	11	31	so when the Judeans who had been with Miryam in the house comforting her saw her get up quickly and go out , they followed her , thinking she was going to the tomb to mourn there .
CJB	John	11	32	When Miryam came to where Yeshua was and saw him , she fell at his feet and said to him , “ Lord , if you had been here , my brother would not have died. ”
CJB	John	11	33	When Yeshua saw her crying , and also the Judeans who came with her crying , he was deeply moved and also troubled .
CJB	John	11	34	He said , “ Where have you buried him ? ” They said , “ Lord , come and see. ”
CJB	John	11	35	Yeshua cried ;
CJB	John	11	36	so the Judeans there said , “ See how he loved him ! ”
CJB	John	11	37	But some of them said , “ He opened the blind man ’ s eyes . Couldn ’ t he have kept this one from dying ? ”
CJB	John	11	38	Yeshua , again deeply moved , came to the tomb . It was a cave , and a stone was lying in front of the entrance .
CJB	John	11	39	Yeshua said , “ Take the stone away ! ” Marta , the sister of the dead man , said to Yeshua , “ By now his body must smell , for it has been four days since he died ! ”
CJB	John	11	40	Yeshua said to her , “ Didn ’ t I tell you that if you keep trusting , you will see the glory of God ? ”
CJB	John	11	41	So they removed the stone . Yeshua looked upward and said , “ Father , I thank you that you have heard me .
CJB	John	11	42	I myself know that you always hear me , but I say this because of the crowd standing around , so that they may believe that you have sent me. ”
CJB	John	11	43	Having said this , he shouted , “ El ‘ azar ! Come out ! ”
CJB	John	11	44	The man who had been dead came out , his hands and feet wrapped in strips of linen and his face covered with a cloth . Yeshua said to them , “ Unwrap him , and let him go ! ”
CJB	John	11	45	At this , many of the Judeans who had come to visit Miryam , and had seen what Yeshua had done , trusted in him .
CJB	John	11	46	But some of them went off to the P ’ rushim and told them what he had done .
CJB	John	11	47	So the head cohanim and the P ’ rushim called a meeting of the Sanhedrin and said , “ What are we going to do ? — for this man is performing many miracles .
CJB	John	11	48	If we let him keep going on this way , everyone will trust in him , and the Romans will come and destroy both the Temple and the nation. ”
CJB	John	11	49	But one of them , Kayafa , who was cohen gadol that year , said to them , “ You people don ’ t know anything !
CJB	John	11	50	You don ’ t see that it ’ s better for you if one man dies on behalf of the people , so that the whole nation won ’ t be destroyed. ”
CJB	John	11	51	Now he didn ’ t speak this way on his own initiative ; rather , since he was cohen gadol that year , he was prophesying that Yeshua was about to die on behalf of the nation ,
CJB	John	11	52	and not for the nation alone , but so that he might gather into one the scattered children of God .
CJB	John	11	53	From that day on , they made plans to have him put to death .
CJB	John	11	54	Therefore Yeshua no longer walked around openly among the Judeans but went away from there into the region near the desert , to a town called Efrayim , and stayed there with his talmidim .
CJB	John	11	55	The Judean festival of Pesach was near , and many people went up from the country to Yerushalayim to perform the purification ceremony prior to Pesach .
CJB	John	11	56	They were looking for Yeshua , and as they stood in the Temple courts they said to each other , “ What do you think ? that he simply won ’ t come to the festival ? ”
CJB	John	11	57	Moreover , the head cohanim and the P ’ rushim had given orders that anyone knowing Yeshua ’ s whereabouts should inform them , so that they could have him arrested .
CJB	John	12	12	The next day , the large crowd that had come for the festival heard that Yeshua was on his way into Yerushalayim .
CJB	John	12	2	so they gave a dinner there in his honor . Marta served the meal , and El ‘ azar was among those at the table with him .
CJB	John	12	3	Miryam took a whole pint of pure oil of spikenard , which is very expensive , poured it on Yeshua ’ s feet and wiped his feet with her hair , so that the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume .
CJB	John	12	4	But one of the talmidim , Y ’ hudah from K ’ riot , the one who was about to betray him , said ,
CJB	John	12	5	“ This perfume is worth a year ’ s wages ! Why wasn ’ t it sold and the money given to the poor ? ”
CJB	John	12	6	Now he said this not out of concern for the poor , but because he was a thief — he was in charge of the common purse and used to steal from it .
CJB	John	12	7	Yeshua said , “ Leave her alone ! She kept this for the day of my burial .
CJB	John	12	8	You always have the poor among you , but you will not always have me. ”
CJB	John	12	9	A large crowd of Judeans learned that he was there ; and they came not only because of Yeshua , but also so that they could see El ‘ azar , whom he had raised from the dead .
CJB	John	12	10	The head cohanim then decided to do away with El ‘ azar too ,
CJB	John	12	11	since it was because of him that large numbers of the Judeans were leaving their leaders and putting their trust in Yeshua .
CJB	John	12	13	They took palm branches and went out to meet him , shouting , “ Deliver us ! ” [ a ] “ Blessed is he who comes in the name of Adonai , [ b ] the King of Isra ’ el ! ”
CJB	John	12	14	After finding a donkey colt , Yeshua mounted it , just as the Tanakh says —
CJB	John	12	15	“ Daughter of Tziyon , don ’ t be afraid ! Look ! your King is coming , sitting on a donkey ’ s colt. ” [ c ]
CJB	John	12	16	His talmidim did not understand this at first ; but after Yeshua had been glorified , then they remembered that the Tanakh said this about him , and that they had done this for him .
CJB	John	12	17	The group that had been with him when he called El ‘ azar out of the tomb and raised him from the dead had been telling about it .
CJB	John	12	18	It was because of this too that the crowd came out to meet him — they had heard that he had performed this miracle .
CJB	John	12	19	The P ’ rushim said to each other , “ Look , you ’ re getting nowhere ! Why , the whole world has gone after him ! ”
CJB	John	12	20	Among those who went up to worship at the festival were some Greek-speaking Jews .
CJB	John	12	21	They approached Philip , the one from Beit-Tzaidah in the Galil , with a request . “ Sir , ” they said , “ we would like to see Yeshua. ”
CJB	John	12	22	Philip came and told Andrew ; then Andrew and Philip went and told Yeshua .
CJB	John	12	23	Yeshua gave them this answer : “ The time has come for the Son of Man to be glorified .
CJB	John	12	24	Yes , indeed ! I tell you that unless a grain of wheat that falls to the ground dies , it stays just a grain ; but if it dies , it produces a big harvest .
CJB	John	12	25	He who loves his life loses it , but he who hates his life in this world will keep it safe right on into eternal life !
CJB	John	12	26	If someone is serving me , let him follow me ; wherever I am , my servant will be there too . My Father will honor anyone who serves me .
CJB	John	12	27	“ Now I am in turmoil . What can I say — ‘ Father , save me from this hour ’ ? No , it was for this very reason that I have come to this hour . I will say this :
CJB	John	12	28	‘ Father , glorify your name ! ’ ” At this a bat-kol came out of heaven , “ I have glorified it before , and I will glorify it again ! ”
CJB	John	12	29	The crowd standing there and hearing it said that it had thundered ; others said , “ An angel spoke to him. ”
CJB	John	12	30	Yeshua answered , “ This bat-kol did not come for my sake but for yours .
CJB	John	12	31	Now is the time for this world to be judged , now the ruler of this world will be expelled .
CJB	John	12	32	As for me , when I am lifted up from the earth , I will draw everyone to myself. ”
CJB	John	12	33	He said this to indicate what kind of death he would die .
CJB	John	12	34	The crowd answered , “ We have learned from the Torah that the Messiah remains forever . How is it that you say the Son of Man has to be ‘ lifted up ’ ? Who is this ‘ Son of Man ’ ? ”
CJB	John	12	35	Yeshua said to them , “ The light will be with you only a little while longer . Walk while you have the light , or the dark will overtake you ; he who walks in the dark doesn ’ t know where he ’ s going .
CJB	John	12	36	While you have the light , put your trust in the light , so that you may become people of light. ” Yeshua said these things , then went off and kept himself hidden from them .
CJB	John	12	37	Even though he had performed so many miracles in their presence , they still did not put their trust in him ,
CJB	John	12	38	in order that what Yesha ‘ yahu the prophet had said might be fulfilled , “ Adonai , who has believed our report ? To whom has the arm of Adonai been revealed ? ” [ d ]
CJB	John	12	39	The reason they could not believe was — as Yesha ‘ yahu said elsewhere —
CJB	John	12	40	“ He has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts , so that they do not see with their eyes , understand with their hearts , and do t ’ shuvah , so that I could heal them. ” [ e ]
CJB	John	12	41	( Yesha ‘ yahu said these things because he saw the Sh ’ khinah of Yeshua and spoke about him . )
CJB	John	12	42	Nevertheless , many of the leaders did trust in him ; but because of the P ’ rushim they did not say so openly , out of fear of being banned from the synagogue ;
CJB	John	12	43	for they loved praise from other people more than praise from God .
CJB	John	12	44	Yeshua declared publicly , “ Those who put their trust in me are trusting not merely in me , but in the One who sent me .
CJB	John	12	45	Also those who see me see the One who sent me .
CJB	John	12	46	I have come as a light into the world , so that everyone who trusts in me might not remain in the dark .
CJB	John	12	47	If anyone hears what I am saying and does not observe it , I don ’ t judge him ; for I did not come to judge the world , but to save the world .
CJB	John	12	48	Those who reject me and don ’ t accept what I say have a judge — the word which I have spoken will judge them on the Last Day .
CJB	John	12	49	For I have not spoken on my own initiative , but the Father who sent me has given me a command , namely , what to say and how to say it .
CJB	John	12	50	And I know that his command is eternal life . So what I say is simply what the Father has told me to say. ” Footnotes - John 12:13 Psalm 118:25 - John 12:13 Psalm 118:26 - John 12:15 Zechariah 9:9 - John 12:38 Isaiah 53:1 - John 12:40 Isaiah 6:10
CJB	John	13	13	You call me ‘ Rabbi ’ and ‘ Lord , ’ and you are right , because I am .
CJB	John	13	2	They were at supper , and the Adversary had already put the desire to betray him into the heart of Y ’ hudah Ben-Shim ‘ on from K ’ riot .
CJB	John	13	3	Yeshua was aware that the Father had put everything in his power , and that he had come from God and was returning to God .
CJB	John	13	4	So he rose from the table , removed his outer garments and wrapped a towel around his waist .
CJB	John	13	5	Then he poured some water into a basin and began to wash the feet of the talmidim and wipe them off with the towel wrapped around him .
CJB	John	13	6	He came to Shim ‘ on Kefa , who said to him , “ Lord ! You are washing my feet ? ”
CJB	John	13	7	Yeshua answered him , “ You don ’ t understand yet what I am doing , but in time you will understand. ”
CJB	John	13	8	“ No ! ” said Kefa , “ You will never wash my feet ! ” Yeshua answered him , “ If I don ’ t wash you , you have no share with me. ”
CJB	John	13	9	)
CJB	John	13	10	Yeshua said to him , “ A man who has had a bath doesn ’ t need to wash , except his feet — his body is already clean . And you people are clean , but not all of you. ”
CJB	John	13	11	( He knew who was betraying him ; this is why he said , “ Not all of you are clean. ” )
CJB	John	13	12	After he had washed their feet , taken back his clothes and returned to the table , he said to them , “ Do you understand what I have done to you ?
CJB	John	13	14	Now if I , the Lord and Rabbi , have washed your feet , you also should wash each other ’ s feet .
CJB	John	13	15	For I have set you an example , so that you may do as I have done to you .
CJB	John	13	16	Yes , indeed ! I tell you , a slave is not greater than his master , nor is an emissary greater than the one who sent him .
CJB	John	13	17	If you know these things , you will be blessed if you do them .
CJB	John	13	18	“ I ’ m not talking to all of you — I know which ones I have chosen . But the words of the Tanakh must be fulfilled that say , ‘ The one eating my bread has turned against me. ’ [ a ]
CJB	John	13	19	I ’ m telling you now , before it happens ; so that when it does happen , you may believe that I AM [ who I say I am ] .
CJB	John	13	20	Yes , indeed ! I tell you that a person who receives someone I send receives me , and that anyone who receives me receives the One who sent me. ”
CJB	John	13	21	After saying this , Yeshua , in deep anguish of spirit , declared , “ Yes , indeed ! I tell you that one of you will betray me. ”
CJB	John	13	22	The talmidim stared at one another , totally mystified — whom could he mean ?
CJB	John	13	23	One of his talmidim , the one Yeshua particularly loved , was reclining close beside him .
CJB	John	13	24	So Shim ‘ on Kefa motioned to him and said , “ Ask which one he ’ s talking about. ”
CJB	John	13	25	Leaning against Yeshua ’ s chest , he asked Yeshua , “ Lord , who is it ? ”
CJB	John	13	26	Yeshua answered , “ It ’ s the one to whom I give this piece of matzah after I dip it in the dish. ” So he dipped the piece of matzah and gave it to Y ’ hudah Ben-Shim ‘ on from K ’ riot .
CJB	John	13	27	As soon as Y ’ hudah took the piece of matzah , the Adversary went into him . “ What you are doing , do quickly ! ” Yeshua said to him .
CJB	John	13	28	But no one at the table understood why he had said this to him .
CJB	John	13	29	Some thought that since Y ’ hudah was in charge of the common purse , Yeshua was telling him , “ Buy what we need for the festival , ” or telling him to give something to the poor .
CJB	John	13	30	As soon as he had taken the piece of matzah , Y ’ hudah went out , and it was night .
CJB	John	13	31	After Y ’ hudah had left , Yeshua said , “ Now the Son of Man has been glorified , and God has been glorified in him .
CJB	John	13	32	If the Son has glorified God , God will himself glorify the Son , and will do so without delay .
CJB	John	13	33	Little children , I will be with you only a little longer . You will look for me ; and , as I said to the Judeans , ‘ Where I am going , you can not come , ’ now I say it to you as well .
CJB	John	13	34	“ I am giving you a new command : that you keep on loving each other . In the same way that I have loved you , you are also to keep on loving each other .
CJB	John	13	35	Everyone will know that you are my talmidim by the fact that you have love for each other. ”
CJB	John	13	36	Shim ‘ on Kefa said to him , “ Lord , where are you going ? ” Yeshua answered , “ Where I am going , you can not follow me now ; but you will follow later. ”
CJB	John	13	37	“ Lord , ” Kefa said to him , “ why can ’ t I follow you now ? I will lay down my life for you ! ”
CJB	John	13	38	Yeshua answered , “ You will lay down your life for me ? Yes , indeed ! I tell you , before the rooster crows you will disown me three times . Footnotes - John 13:18 Psalm 41:10 (
CJB	John	14	14	If you ask me for something in my name , I will do it .
CJB	John	14	2	In my Father ’ s house are many places to live . If there weren ’ t , I would have told you ; because I am going there to prepare a place for you .
CJB	John	14	3	Since I am going and preparing a place for you , I will return to take you with me ; so that where I am , you may be also .
CJB	John	14	4	Furthermore , you know where I ’ m going ; and you know the way there. ”
CJB	John	14	5	T ’ oma said to him , “ Lord , we don ’ t know where you ’ re going ; so how can we know the way ? ”
CJB	John	14	6	Yeshua said , “ I AM the Way — and the Truth and the Life ; no one comes to the Father except through me .
CJB	John	14	7	Because you have known me , you will also know my Father ; from now on , you do know him — in fact , you have seen him. ”
CJB	John	14	8	Philip said to him , “ Lord , show us the Father , and it will be enough for us. ”
CJB	John	14	9	Yeshua replied to him , “ Have I been with you so long without your knowing me , Philip ? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father ; so how can you say , ‘ Show us the Father ’ ?
CJB	John	14	10	Don ’ t you believe that I am united with the Father , and the Father united with me ? What I am telling you , I am not saying on my own initiative ; the Father living in me is doing his own works .
CJB	John	14	11	Trust me , that I am united with the Father , and the Father united with me . But if you can ’ t , then trust because of the works themselves .
CJB	John	14	12	Yes , indeed ! I tell you that whoever trusts in me will also do the works I do ! Indeed , he will do greater ones , because I am going to the Father .
CJB	John	14	13	In fact , whatever you ask for in my name , I will do ; so that the Father may be glorified in the Son .
CJB	John	14	15	“ If you love me , you will keep my commands ;
CJB	John	14	16	and I will ask the Father , and he will give you another comforting Counselor like me , the Spirit of Truth , to be with you forever .
CJB	John	14	17	The world can not receive him , because it neither sees nor knows him . You know him , because he is staying with you and will be united with you .
CJB	John	14	18	I will not leave you orphans — I am coming to you .
CJB	John	14	19	In just a little while , the world will no longer see me ; but you will see me . Because I live , you too will live .
CJB	John	14	20	When that day comes , you will know that I am united with my Father , and you with me , and I with you .
CJB	John	14	21	Whoever has my commands and keeps them is the one who loves me , and the one who loves me will be loved by my Father , and I will love him and reveal myself to him. ”
CJB	John	14	22	Y ’ hudah ( not the one from K ’ riot ) said to him , “ What has happened , Lord , that you are about to reveal yourself to us and not to the world ? ”
CJB	John	14	23	Yeshua answered him , “ If someone loves me , he will keep my word ; and my Father will love him , and we will come to him and make our home with him .
CJB	John	14	24	Someone who doesn ’ t love me doesn ’ t keep my words — and the word you are hearing is not my own but that of the Father who sent me .
CJB	John	14	25	“ I have told you these things while I am still with you .
CJB	John	14	26	But the Counselor , the Ruach HaKodesh , whom the Father will send in my name , will teach you everything ; that is , he will remind you of everything I have said to you .
CJB	John	14	27	“ What I am leaving with you is shalom — I am giving you my shalom . I don ’ t give the way the world gives . Don ’ t let yourselves be upset or frightened .
CJB	John	14	28	You heard me tell you , ‘ I am leaving , and I will come back to you. ’ If you loved me , you would have been glad that I am going to the Father ; because the Father is greater than I .
CJB	John	14	29	“ Also , I have said it to you now , before it happens ; so that when it does happen , you will trust .
CJB	John	14	30	“ I won ’ t be talking with you much longer , because the ruler of this world is coming . He has no claim on me ;
CJB	John	14	31	rather , this is happening so that the world may know that I love the Father , and that I do as the Father has commanded me . “ Get up ! Let ’ s get going !
CJB	John	15	15	I no longer call you slaves , because a slave doesn ’ t know what his master is about ; but I have called you friends , because everything I have heard from my Father I have made known to you .
CJB	John	15	2	Every branch which is part of me but fails to bear fruit , he cuts off ; and every branch that does bear fruit , he prunes , so that it may bear more fruit .
CJB	John	15	3	Right now , because of the word which I have spoken to you , you are pruned .
CJB	John	15	4	)
CJB	John	15	5	“ I am the vine and you are the branches . Those who stay united with me , and I with them , are the ones who bear much fruit ; because apart from me you can ’ t do a thing .
CJB	John	15	6	Unless a person remains united with me , he is thrown away like a branch and dries up . Such branches are gathered and thrown into the fire , where they are burned up .
CJB	John	15	7	“ If you remain united with me , and my words with you , then ask whatever you want , and it will happen for you .
CJB	John	15	8	This is how my Father is glorified — in your bearing much fruit ; this is how you will prove to be my talmidim .
CJB	John	15	9	“ Just as my Father has loved me , I too have loved you ; so stay in my love .
CJB	John	15	10	If you keep my commands , you will stay in my love — just as I have kept my Father ’ s commands and stay in his love .
CJB	John	15	11	I have said this to you so that my joy may be in you , and your joy be complete .
CJB	John	15	12	“ This is my command : that you keep on loving each other just as I have loved you .
CJB	John	15	13	No one has greater love than a person who lays down his life for his friends .
CJB	John	15	14	You are my friends , if you do what I command you .
CJB	John	15	16	You did not choose me , I chose you ; and I have commissioned you to go and bear fruit , fruit that will last ; so that whatever you ask from the Father in my name he may give you .
CJB	John	15	17	This is what I command you : keep loving each other !
CJB	John	15	18	“ If the world hates you , understand that it hated me first .
CJB	John	15	19	If you belonged to the world , the world would have loved its own . But because you do not belong to the world — on the contrary , I have picked you out of the world — therefore the world hates you .
CJB	John	15	20	Remember what I told you , ‘ A slave is not greater than his master. ’ If they persecuted me , they will persecute you too ; if they kept my word , they will keep yours too .
CJB	John	15	21	But they will do all this to you on my account , because they don ’ t know the One who sent me .
CJB	John	15	22	“ If I had not come and spoken to them , they wouldn ’ t be guilty of sin ; but now , they have no excuse for their sin .
CJB	John	15	23	Whoever hates me hates my Father also .
CJB	John	15	24	If I had not done in their presence works which no one else ever did , they would not be guilty of sin ; but now , they have seen them and have hated both me and my Father .
CJB	John	15	25	But this has happened in order to fulfill the words in their Torah which read , ‘ They hated me for no reason at all. ’ [ a ]
CJB	John	15	26	“ When the Counselor comes , whom I will send you from the Father — the Spirit of Truth , who keeps going out from the Father — he will testify on my behalf .
CJB	John	15	27	And you testify too , because you have been with me from the outset . Footnotes - John 15:25 Psalms 35:19 ; 69:5 (
CJB	John	16	16	“ In a little while , you will see me no more ; then , a little while later , you will see me. ”
CJB	John	16	2	They will ban you from the synagogue ; in fact , the time will come when anyone who kills you will think he is serving God !
CJB	John	16	3	They will do these things because they have understood neither the Father nor me .
CJB	John	16	4	But I have told you this , so that when the time comes for it to happen , you will remember that I told you . I didn ’ t tell you this at first , because I was with you .
CJB	John	16	5	But now I am going to the One who sent me . “ Not one of you is asking me , ‘ Where are you going ? ’
CJB	John	16	6	Instead , because I have said these things to you , you are overcome with grief .
CJB	John	16	7	But I tell you the truth , it is to your advantage that I go away ; for if I don ’ t go away , the comforting Counselor will not come to you . However , if I do go , I will send him to you .
CJB	John	16	8	“ When he comes , he will show that the world is wrong about sin , about righteousness and about judgment —
CJB	John	16	9	about sin , in that people don ’ t put their trust in me ;
CJB	John	16	10	about righteousness , in that I am going to the Father and you will no longer see me ;
CJB	John	16	11	about judgment , in that the ruler of this world has been judged .
CJB	John	16	12	“ I still have many things to tell you , but you can ’ t bear them now .
CJB	John	16	13	However , when the Spirit of Truth comes , he will guide you into all the truth ; for he will not speak on his own initiative but will say only what he hears . He will also announce to you the events of the future .
CJB	John	16	14	He will glorify me , because he will receive from what is mine and announce it to you .
CJB	John	16	15	Everything the Father has is mine ; this is why I said that he receives from what is mine and will announce it to you .
CJB	John	16	17	At this , some of the talmidim said to one another , “ What is this that he ’ s telling us , ‘ In a little while , you won ’ t see me ; then , a little while later , you will see me ’ ? and , ‘ I am going to the Father ’ ? ”
CJB	John	16	18	They went on saying , “ What is this ‘ little while ’ ? We don ’ t understand what he ’ s talking about. ”
CJB	John	16	19	Yeshua knew that they wanted to ask him , so he said to them , “ Are you asking each other what I meant by saying , ‘ In a little while , you won ’ t see me ; and then , a little while later , you will see me ’ ?
CJB	John	16	20	Yes , it ’ s true . I tell you that you will sob and mourn , and the world will rejoice ; you will grieve , but your grief will turn to joy .
CJB	John	16	21	When a woman is giving birth , she is in pain ; because her time has come . But when the baby is born , she forgets her suffering out of joy that a child has come into the world .
CJB	John	16	22	So you do indeed feel grief now , but I am going to see you again . Then your hearts will be full of joy , and no one will take your joy away from you .
CJB	John	16	23	“ When that day comes , you won ’ t ask anything of me ! Yes , indeed ! I tell you that whatever you ask from the Father , he will give you in my name .
CJB	John	16	24	Till now you haven ’ t asked for anything in my name . Keep asking , and you will receive , so that your joy may be complete .
CJB	John	16	25	“ I have said these things to you with the help of illustrations ; however , a time is coming when I will no longer speak indirectly but will talk about the Father in plain language .
CJB	John	16	26	When that day comes , you will ask in my name . I am not telling you that I will pray to the Father on your behalf ,
CJB	John	16	27	for the Father himself loves you , because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God .
CJB	John	16	28	“ I came from the Father and have come into the world ; again , I am leaving the world and returning to the Father. ”
CJB	John	16	29	The talmidim said to him , “ Look , you ’ re talking plainly right now , you ’ re not speaking indirectly at all .
CJB	John	16	30	Now we know that you know everything , and that you don ’ t need to have people put their questions into words . This makes us believe that you came from God. ”
CJB	John	16	31	Yeshua answered , “ Now you do believe .
CJB	John	16	32	But a time is coming — indeed it has come already — when you will be scattered , each one looking out for himself ; and you will leave me all alone . Yet I am not alone ; because the Father is with me .
CJB	John	16	33	“ I have said these things to you so that , united with me , you may have shalom . In the world , you have tsuris . But be brave ! I have conquered the world ! ”
CJB	John	17	17	Set them apart for holiness by means of the truth — your word is truth .
CJB	John	17	2	just as you gave him authority over all mankind , so that he might give eternal life to all those whom you have given him .
CJB	John	17	3	And eternal life is this : to know you , the one true God , and him whom you sent , Yeshua the Messiah .
CJB	John	17	4	“ I glorified you on earth by finishing the work you gave me to do .
CJB	John	17	5	Now , Father , glorify me alongside yourself . Give me the same glory I had with you before the world existed .
CJB	John	17	6	“ I made your name known to the people you gave me out of the world . They were yours , you gave them to me , and they have kept your word .
CJB	John	17	7	Now they know that everything you have given me is from you ,
CJB	John	17	8	because the words you gave me I have given to them , and they have received them . They have really come to know that I came from you , and they have come to trust that you sent me .
CJB	John	17	9	“ I am praying for them . I am not praying for the world , but for those you have given to me , because they are yours .
CJB	John	17	10	Indeed , all I have is yours , and all you have is mine , and in them I have been glorified .
CJB	John	17	11	Now I am no longer in the world . They are in the world , but I am coming to you . Holy Father , guard them by the power of your name , which you have given to me , so that they may be one , just as we are .
CJB	John	17	12	When I was with them , I guarded them by the power of your name , which you have given to me ; yes , I kept watch over them ; and not one of them was destroyed ( except the one meant for destruction , so that the Tanakh might be fulfilled ) .
CJB	John	17	13	But now , I am coming to you ; and I say these things while I am still in the world so that they may have my joy made complete in themselves .
CJB	John	17	14	“ I have given them your word , and the world hated them , because they do not belong to the world — just as I myself do not belong to the world .
CJB	John	17	15	I don ’ t ask you to take them out of the world , but to protect them from the Evil One .
CJB	John	17	16	They do not belong to the world , just as I do not belong to the world .
CJB	John	17	18	Just as you sent me into the world , I have sent them into the world .
CJB	John	17	19	On their behalf I am setting myself apart for holiness , so that they too may be set apart for holiness by means of the truth .
CJB	John	17	20	“ I pray not only for these , but also for those who will trust in me because of their word ,
CJB	John	17	21	that they may all be one . Just as you , Father , are united with me and I with you , I pray that they may be united with us , so that the world may believe that you sent me .
CJB	John	17	22	The glory which you have given to me , I have given to them ; so that they may be one , just as we are one —
CJB	John	17	23	I united with them and you with me , so that they may be completely one , and the world thus realize that you sent me , and that you have loved them just as you have loved me .
CJB	John	17	24	“ Father , I want those you have given me to be with me where I am ; so that they may see my glory , which you have given me because you loved me before the creation of the world .
CJB	John	17	25	Righteous Father , the world has not known you , but I have known you , and these people have known that you sent me .
CJB	John	17	26	I made your name known to them , and I will continue to make it known ; so that the love with which you have loved me may be in them , and I myself may be united with them . ”
CJB	John	18	18	Now the slaves and guards had lit a fire because it was cold , and they were standing around it warming themselves ; Kefa joined them and stood warming himself too .
CJB	John	18	2	Now Y ’ hudah , who was betraying him , also knew the place ; because Yeshua had often met there with his talmidim .
CJB	John	18	3	So Y ’ hudah went there , taking with him a detachment of Roman soldiers and some Temple guards provided by the head cohanim and the P ’ rushim ; they carried weapons , lanterns and torches .
CJB	John	18	4	Yeshua , who knew everything that was going to happen to him , went out and asked them , “ Whom do you want ? ”
CJB	John	18	5	“ Yeshua from Natzeret , ” they answered . He said to them , “ I AM. ” Also standing with them was Y ’ hudah , the one who was betraying him .
CJB	John	18	6	When he said , “ I AM , ” they went backward from him and fell to the ground .
CJB	John	18	7	So he inquired of them once more , “ Whom do you want ? ” and they said , “ Yeshua from Natzeret. ”
CJB	John	18	8	“ I told you , ‘ I AM , ’ ” answered Yeshua , “ so if I ’ m the one you want , let these others go. ”
CJB	John	18	9	This happened so that what he had said might be fulfilled , “ I have not lost one of those you gave me. ”
CJB	John	18	10	Then Shim ‘ on Kefa , who had a sword , drew it and struck the slave of the cohen hagadol , cutting off his right ear ; the slave ’ s name was Melekh .
CJB	John	18	11	Yeshua said to Kefa , “ Put your sword back in its scabbard ! This is the cup the Father has given me ; am I not to drink it ? ”
CJB	John	18	12	So the detachment of Roman soldiers and their captain , together with the Temple Guard of the Judeans , arrested Yeshua , tied him up ,
CJB	John	18	13	and took him first to ‘ Anan , the father-in-law of Kayafa , who was cohen gadol that fateful year .
CJB	John	18	14	( It was Kayafa who had advised the Judeans that it would be good for one man to die on behalf of the people . )
CJB	John	18	15	Shim ‘ on Kefa and another talmid followed Yeshua . The second talmid was known to the cohen hagadol , and he went with Yeshua into the courtyard of the cohen hagadol ;
CJB	John	18	16	but Kefa stood outside by the gate . So the other talmid , the one known to the cohen hagadol , went back out and spoke to the woman on duty at the gate , then brought Kefa inside .
CJB	John	18	17	The woman at the gate said to Kefa , “ Aren ’ t you another of that man ’ s talmidim ? ” He said , “ No , I ’ m not. ”
CJB	John	18	19	The cohen hagadol questioned Yeshua about his talmidim and about what he taught .
CJB	John	18	20	Yeshua answered , “ I have spoken quite openly to everyone ; I have always taught in a synagogue or in the Temple where all Jews meet together , and I have said nothing in secret ;
CJB	John	18	21	so why are you questioning me ? Question the ones who heard what I said to them ; look , they know what I said. ”
CJB	John	18	22	At these words , one of the guards standing by slapped Yeshua in the face and said , “ This is how you talk to the cohen hagadol ? ”
CJB	John	18	23	Yeshua answered him , “ If I said something wrong , state publicly what was wrong ; but if I was right , why are you hitting me ? ”
CJB	John	18	24	So ‘ Anan sent him , still tied up , to Kayafa the cohen hagadol .
CJB	John	18	25	Meanwhile , Shim ‘ on Kefa was standing and warming himself . They said to him , “ Aren ’ t you also one of his talmidim ? ” He denied it , saying , “ No , I am not. ”
CJB	John	18	26	One of the slaves of the cohen hagadol , a relative of the man whose ear Kefa had cut off , said , “ Didn ’ t I see you with him in the grove of trees ? ”
CJB	John	18	27	So again Kefa denied it , and instantly a rooster crowed .
CJB	John	18	28	They led Yeshua from Kayafa to the governor ’ s headquarters . By now it was early morning . They did not enter the headquarters building because they didn ’ t want to become ritually defiled and thus unable to eat the Pesach meal .
CJB	John	18	29	So Pilate went outside to them and said , “ What charge are you bringing against this man ? ”
CJB	John	18	30	They answered , “ If he hadn ’ t done something wrong , we wouldn ’ t have brought him to you. ”
CJB	John	18	31	Pilate said to them , “ You take him and judge him according to your own law. ” The Judeans replied , “ We don ’ t have the legal power to put anyone to death. ”
CJB	John	18	32	This was so that what Yeshua had said , about how he was going to die , might be fulfilled .
CJB	John	18	33	So Pilate went back into the headquarters , called Yeshua and said to him , “ Are you the king of the Jews ? ”
CJB	John	18	34	Yeshua answered , “ Are you asking this on your own , or have other people told you about me ? ”
CJB	John	18	35	Pilate replied , “ Am I a Jew ? Your own nation and head cohanim have handed you over to me ; what have you done ? ”
CJB	John	18	36	Yeshua answered , “ My kingship does not derive its authority from this world ’ s order of things . If it did , my men would have fought to keep me from being arrested by the Judeans . But my kingship does not come from here. ”
CJB	John	18	37	“ So then , ” Pilate said to him , “ You are a king , after all. ” Yeshua answered , “ You say I am a king . The reason I have been born , the reason I have come into the world , is to bear witness to the truth . Every one who belongs to the truth listens to me. ”
CJB	John	18	38	Pilate asked him , “ What is truth ? ” Having said this , Pilate went outside again to the Judeans and told them , “ I don ’ t find any case against him .
CJB	John	18	39	However , you have a custom that at Passover I set one prisoner free . Do you want me to set free for you the ‘ king of the Jews ’ ? ”
CJB	John	18	40	But they yelled back , “ No , not this man but Bar-Abba ! ” ( Bar-Abba was a revolutionary . )
CJB	John	19	19	Pilate also had a notice written and posted on the stake ; it read , YESHUA FROM NATZERET THE KING OF THE JEWS
CJB	John	19	2	The soldiers twisted thorn-branches into a crown and placed it on his head , put a purple robe on him ,
CJB	John	19	3	and went up to him , saying over and over , “ Hail , ‘ king of the Jews ’ ! ” and hitting him in the face .
CJB	John	19	4	Pilate went outside once more and said to the crowd , “ Look , I ’ m bringing him out to you to get you to understand that I find no case against him. ”
CJB	John	19	5	So Yeshua came out , wearing the thorn-branch crown and the purple robe . Pilate said to them , “ Look at the man ! ”
CJB	John	19	6	When the head cohanim and the Temple guards saw him they shouted , “ Put him to death on the stake ! Put him to death on the stake ! ” Pilate said to them , “ You take him out yourselves and put him to death on the stake , because I don ’ t find any case against him. ”
CJB	John	19	7	The Judeans answered him , “ We have a law ; according to that law , he ought to be put to death , because he made himself out to be the Son of God. ”
CJB	John	19	8	On hearing this , Pilate became even more frightened .
CJB	John	19	9	He went back into the headquarters and asked Yeshua , “ Where are you from ? ” But Yeshua didn ’ t answer .
CJB	John	19	10	So Pilate said to him , “ You refuse to speak to me ? Don ’ t you understand that it is in my power either to set you free or to have you executed on the stake ? ”
CJB	John	19	11	Yeshua answered , “ You would have no power over me if it hadn ’ t been given to you from above ; this is why the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin. ”
CJB	John	19	12	On hearing this , Pilate tried to find a way to set him free ; but the Judeans shouted , “ If you set this man free , it means you ’ re not a ‘ Friend of the Emperor ’ ! Everyone who claims to be a king is opposing the Emperor ! ”
CJB	John	19	13	When Pilate heard what they were saying , he brought Yeshua outside and sat down on the judge ’ s seat in the place called The Pavement ( in Aramaic , Gabta ) ;
CJB	John	19	14	it was about noon on Preparation Day for Pesach . He said to the Judeans , “ Here ’ s your king ! ”
CJB	John	19	15	They shouted , “ Take him away ! Take him away ! Put him to death on the stake ! ” Pilate said to them , “ You want me to execute your king on a stake ? ” The head cohanim answered , “ We have no king but the Emperor. ”
CJB	John	19	16	Then Pilate handed Yeshua over to them to have him put to death on the stake . So they took charge of Yeshua .
CJB	John	19	17	Carrying the stake himself he went out to the place called Skull ( in Aramaic , Gulgolta ) .
CJB	John	19	18	) - John 19:36 Psalm 34:21 (
CJB	John	19	20	) ; Exodus 12:46 ; Numbers 9:12 - John 19:37 Zechariah 12:10
CJB	John	19	21	The Judeans ’ head cohanim therefore said to Pilate , “ Don ’ t write , ‘ The King of the Jews , ’ but ‘ He said , “ I am King of the Jews. ” ’ ”
CJB	John	19	22	Pilate answered , “ What I have written , I have written. ”
CJB	John	19	23	When the soldiers had nailed Yeshua to the stake , they took his clothes and divided them into four shares , a share for each soldier , with the under-robe left over . Now the under-robe was seamless , woven in one piece from top to bottom ;
CJB	John	19	24	so they said to one another , “ We shouldn ’ t tear it in pieces ; let ’ s draw for it. ” This happened in order to fulfill the words from the Tanakh , “ They divided my clothes among themselves and gambled for my robe. ” [ a ] This is why the soldiers did these things .
CJB	John	19	25	Nearby Yeshua ’ s execution stake stood his mother , his mother ’ s sister Miryam the wife of K ’ lofah , and Miryam from Magdala .
CJB	John	19	26	When Yeshua saw his mother and the talmid whom he loved standing there , he said to his mother , “ Mother , this is your son. ”
CJB	John	19	27	Then he said to the talmid , “ This is your mother. ” And from that time on , the talmid took her into his own home .
CJB	John	19	28	After this , knowing that all things had accomplished their purpose , Yeshua , in order to fulfill the words of the Tanakh , said , “ I ’ m thirsty. ”
CJB	John	19	29	A jar full of cheap sour wine was there ; so they soaked a sponge in the wine , coated it with oregano leaves and held it up to his mouth .
CJB	John	19	30	After Yeshua had taken the wine , he said , “ It is accomplished ! ” And , letting his head droop , he delivered up his spirit .
CJB	John	19	31	It was Preparation Day , and the Judeans did not want the bodies to remain on the stake on Shabbat , since it was an especially important Shabbat . So they asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies removed .
CJB	John	19	32	The soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man who had been put on a stake beside Yeshua , then the legs of the other one ;
CJB	John	19	33	but when they got to Yeshua and saw that he was already dead , they didn ’ t break his legs .
CJB	John	19	34	However , one of the soldiers stabbed his side with a spear , and at once blood and water flowed out .
CJB	John	19	35	The man who saw it has testified about it , and his testimony is true . And he knows that he tells the truth , so you too can trust .
CJB	John	19	36	For these things happened in order to fulfill this passage of the Tanakh : “ Not one of his bones will be broken. ” [ b ]
CJB	John	19	37	And again , another passage says , “ They will look at him whom they have pierced. ” [ c ]
CJB	John	19	38	After this , Yosef of Ramatayim , who was a talmid of Yeshua , but a secret one out of fear of the Judeans , asked Pilate if he could have Yeshua ’ s body . Pilate gave his consent , so Yosef came and took the body away .
CJB	John	19	39	Also Nakdimon , who at first had gone to see Yeshua by night , came with some seventy pounds of spices — a mixture of myrrh and aloes .
CJB	John	19	40	They took Yeshua ’ s body and wrapped it up in linen sheets with the spices , in keeping with Judean burial practice .
CJB	John	19	41	In the vicinity of where he had been executed was a garden , and in the garden was a new tomb in which no one had ever been buried .
CJB	John	19	42	So , because it was Preparation Day for the Judeans , and because the tomb was close by , that is where they buried Yeshua . Footnotes - John 19:24 Psalm 22:19 (
CJB	John	20	20	Having greeted them , he showed them his hands and his side . The talmidim were overjoyed to see the Lord .
CJB	John	20	2	So she came running to Shim ‘ on Kefa and the other talmid , the one Yeshua loved , and said to them , “ They ’ ve taken the Lord out of the tomb , and we don ’ t know where they ’ ve put him ! ”
CJB	John	20	3	Then Kefa and the other talmid started for the tomb .
CJB	John	20	4	They both ran , but the other talmid outran Kefa and reached the tomb first .
CJB	John	20	5	Stooping down , he saw the linen burial-sheets lying there but did not go in .
CJB	John	20	6	Then , following him , Shim ‘ on Kefa arrived , entered the tomb and saw the burial-sheets lying there ,
CJB	John	20	7	also the cloth that had been around his head , lying not with the sheets but in a separate place and still folded up .
CJB	John	20	8	Then the other talmid , who had arrived at the tomb first , also went in ; he saw , and he trusted .
CJB	John	20	9	( They had not yet come to understand that the Tanakh teaches that the Messiah has to rise from the dead . )
CJB	John	20	10	So the talmidim returned home ,
CJB	John	20	11	but Miryam stood outside crying . As she cried , she bent down , peered into the tomb ,
CJB	John	20	12	and saw two angels in white sitting where the body of Yeshua had been , one at the head and one at the feet .
CJB	John	20	13	“ Why are you crying ? ” they asked her . “ They took my Lord , ” she said to them , “ and I don ’ t know where they have put him. ”
CJB	John	20	14	As she said this , she turned around and saw Yeshua standing there , but she didn ’ t know it was he .
CJB	John	20	15	Yeshua said to her , “ Lady , why are you crying ? Whom are you looking for ? ” Thinking he was the gardener , she said to him , “ Sir , if you ’ re the one who carried him away , just tell me where you put him ; and I ’ ll go and get him myself. ”
CJB	John	20	16	Yeshua said to her , “ Miryam ! ” Turning , she cried out to him in Hebrew , “ Rabbani ! ” ( that is , “ Teacher ! ” )
CJB	John	20	17	“ Stop holding onto me , ” Yeshua said to her , “ because I haven ’ t yet gone back to the Father . But go to my brothers , and tell them that I am going back to my Father and your Father , to my God and your God. ”
CJB	John	20	18	Miryam of Magdala went to the talmidim with the news that she had seen the Lord and that he had told her this .
CJB	John	20	19	In the evening that same day , the first day of the week , when the talmidim were gathered together behind locked doors out of fear of the Judeans , Yeshua came , stood in the middle and said , “ Shalom aleikhem ! ”
CJB	John	20	21	“ Shalom aleikhem ! ” Yeshua repeated . “ Just as the Father sent me , I myself am also sending you. ”
CJB	John	20	22	Having said this , he breathed on them and said to them , “ Receive the Ruach HaKodesh !
CJB	John	20	23	If you forgive someone ’ s sins , their sins are forgiven ; if you hold them , they are held. ”
CJB	John	20	24	Now T ’ oma ( the name means “ twin ” ) , one of the Twelve , was not with them when Yeshua came .
CJB	John	20	25	When the other talmidim told him , “ We have seen the Lord , ” he replied , “ Unless I see the nail marks in his hands , put my finger into the place where the nails were and put my hand into his side , I refuse to believe it. ”
CJB	John	20	26	A week later his talmidim were once more in the room , and this time T ’ oma was with them . Although the doors were locked , Yeshua came , stood among them and said , “ Shalom aleikhem ! ”
CJB	John	20	27	Then he said to T ’ oma , “ Put your finger here , look at my hands , take your hand and put it into my side . Don ’ t be lacking in trust , but have trust ! ”
CJB	John	20	28	T ’ oma answered him , “ My Lord and my God ! ”
CJB	John	20	29	Yeshua said to him , “ Have you trusted because you have seen me ? How blessed are those who do not see , but trust anyway ! ”
CJB	John	20	30	In the presence of the talmidim Yeshua performed many other miracles which have not been recorded in this book .
CJB	John	20	31	But these which have been recorded are here so that you may trust that Yeshua is the Messiah , the Son of God , and that by this trust you may have life because of who he is .
CJB	John	21	21	On seeing him , Kefa said to Yeshua , “ Lord , what about him ? ”
CJB	John	21	2	Shim ‘ on Kefa and T ’ oma ( his name means “ twin ” ) were together with Natan ’ el from Kanah in the Galil , the sons of Zavdai , and two other talmidim .
CJB	John	21	3	Shim ‘ on Kefa said , “ I ’ m going fishing. ” They said to him , “ We ’ re coming with you. ” They went and got into the boat , but that night they didn ’ t catch anything .
CJB	John	21	4	However , just as day was breaking , Yeshua stood on shore , but the talmidim didn ’ t know it was he .
CJB	John	21	5	He said to them , “ You don ’ t have any fish , do you ? ” “ No , ” they answered him .
CJB	John	21	6	He said to them , “ Throw in your net to starboard and you will catch some. ” So they threw in their net , and there were so many fish in it that they couldn ’ t haul it aboard .
CJB	John	21	7	The talmid Yeshua loved said to Kefa , “ It ’ s the Lord ! ” On hearing it was the Lord , Shim ‘ on Kefa threw on his coat , because he was stripped for work , and plunged into the lake ;
CJB	John	21	8	but the other talmidim followed in the boat , dragging the net full of fish ; for they weren ’ t far from shore , only about a hundred yards .
CJB	John	21	9	When they stepped ashore , they saw a fire of burning coals with a fish on it , and some bread .
CJB	John	21	10	Yeshua said to them , “ Bring some of the fish you have just caught. ”
CJB	John	21	11	Shim ‘ on Kefa went up and dragged the net ashore . It was full of fish ,
CJB	John	21	153	of them ; but even with so many , the net wasn ’ t torn .
CJB	John	21	12	Yeshua said to them , “ Come and have breakfast. ” None of the talmidim dared to ask him , “ Who are you ? ” They knew it was the Lord .
CJB	John	21	13	Yeshua came , took the bread and gave it to them , and did the same with the fish .
CJB	John	21	14	This was now the third time Yeshua had appeared to the talmidim after being raised from the dead .
CJB	John	21	15	After breakfast , Yeshua said to Shim ‘ on Kefa , “ Shim ‘ on Bar-Yochanan , do you love me more than these ? ” He replied , “ Yes , Lord , you know I ’ m your friend. ” He said to him , “ Feed my lambs. ”
CJB	John	21	16	A second time he said to him , “ Shim ‘ on Bar-Yochanan , do you love me ? ” He replied , “ Yes , Lord , you know I ’ m your friend. ” He said to him , “ Shepherd my sheep. ”
CJB	John	21	17	The third time he said to him , “ Shim ‘ on Bar-Yochanan , are you my friend ? ” Shim ‘ on was hurt that he questioned him a third time : “ Are you my friend ? ” So he replied , “ Lord , you know everything ! You know I ’ m your friend ! ” Yeshua said to him , “ Feed my sheep !
CJB	John	21	18	Yes , indeed ! I tell you , when you were younger , you put on your clothes and went where you wanted . But when you grow old , you will stretch out your hands , and someone else will dress you and carry you where you do not want to go. ”
CJB	John	21	19	He said this to indicate the kind of death by which Kefa would bring glory to God . Then Yeshua said to him , “ Follow me ! ”
CJB	John	21	20	Kefa turned and saw the talmid Yeshua especially loved following behind , the one who had leaned against him at the supper and had asked , “ Who is the one who is betraying you ? ”
CJB	John	21	22	Yeshua said to him , “ If I want him to stay on until I come , what is it to you ? You , follow me ! ”
CJB	John	21	23	Therefore the word spread among the brothers that that talmid would not die . However , Yeshua didn ’ t say he wouldn ’ t die , but simply , “ If I want him to stay on until I come , what is it to you ? ”
CJB	John	21	24	This one is the talmid who is testifying about these things and who has recorded them . And we know that his testimony is true .
CJB	John	21	25	But there are also many other things Yeshua did ; and if they were all to be recorded , I don ’ t think the whole world could contain the books that would have to be written !
CJB	Romans	1	1	From : Sha ’ ul , a slave of the Messiah Yeshua , an emissary because I was called and set apart for the Good News of God .
CJB	Romans	1	2	God promised this Good News in advance through his prophets in the Tanakh .
CJB	Romans	1	3	It concerns his Son — he is descended from David physically ;
CJB	Romans	1	4	he was powerfully demonstrated to be Son of God spiritually , set apart by his having been resurrected from the dead ; he is Yeshua the Messiah , our Lord .
CJB	Romans	1	5	Through him we received grace and were given the work of being an emissary on his behalf promoting trust-grounded obedience among all the Gentiles ,
CJB	Romans	1	6	including you , who have been called by Yeshua the Messiah .
CJB	Romans	1	7	To : All those in Rome whom God loves , who have been called , who have been set apart for him : Grace to you and shalom from God our Father and the Lord Yeshua the Messiah .
CJB	Romans	1	8	First , I thank my God through Yeshua the Messiah for all of you , because the report of your trust is spreading throughout the whole world .
CJB	Romans	1	9	For God , whom I serve in my spirit by spreading the Good News about his Son , is my witness that I regularly remember you
CJB	Romans	1	10	in my prayers ; and I always pray that somehow , now or in the future , I might , by God ’ s will , succeed in coming to visit you .
CJB	Romans	1	11	For I long to see you , so that I might share with you some spiritual gift that can make you stronger —
CJB	Romans	1	12	or , to put it another way , so that by my being with you , we might , through the faith we share , encourage one another .
CJB	Romans	1	13	Brothers , I want you to know that although I have been prevented from visiting you until now , I have often planned to do so , in order that I might have some fruit among you , just as I have among the other Gentiles .
CJB	Romans	1	14	I owe a debt to both civilized Greeks and uncivilized people , to both the educated and the ignorant ;
CJB	Romans	1	15	therefore I am eager to proclaim the Good News also to you who live in Rome .
CJB	Romans	1	16	For I am not ashamed of the Good News , since it is God ’ s powerful means of bringing salvation to everyone who keeps on trusting , to the Jew especially , but equally to the Gentile .
CJB	Romans	1	17	For in it is revealed how God makes people righteous in his sight ; and from beginning to end it is through trust — as the Tanakh puts it , “ But the person who is righteous will live his life by trust. ” [ a ]
CJB	Romans	1	18	What is revealed is God ’ s anger from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of people who in their wickedness keep suppressing the truth ;
CJB	Romans	1	19	because what is known about God is plain to them , since God has made it plain to them .
CJB	Romans	1	20	For ever since the creation of the universe his invisible qualities — both his eternal power and his divine nature — have been clearly seen , because they can be understood from what he has made . Therefore , they have no excuse ;
CJB	Romans	1	21	because , although they know who God is , they do not glorify him as God or thank him . On the contrary , they have become futile in their thinking ; and their undiscerning hearts have become darkened .
CJB	Romans	1	22	Claiming to be wise , they have become fools !
CJB	Romans	1	23	In fact , they have exchanged the glory of the immortal God for mere images , like a mortal human being , or like birds , animals or reptiles !
CJB	Romans	1	24	This is why God has given them up to the vileness of their hearts ’ lusts , to the shameful misuse of each other ’ s bodies .
CJB	Romans	1	25	They have exchanged the truth of God for falsehood , by worshipping and serving created things , rather than the Creator — praised be he for ever . Amen .
CJB	Romans	1	26	This is why God has given them up to degrading passions ; so that their women exchange natural sexual relations for unnatural ;
CJB	Romans	1	27	and likewise the men , giving up natural relations with the opposite sex , burn with passion for one another , men committing shameful acts with other men and receiving in their own persons the penalty appropriate to their perversion .
CJB	Romans	1	28	In other words , since they have not considered God worth knowing , God has given them up to worthless ways of thinking ; so that they do improper things .
CJB	Romans	1	29	They are filled with every kind of wickedness , evil , greed and vice ; stuffed with jealousy , murder , quarrelling , dishonesty and ill-will ; they are gossips ,
CJB	Romans	1	30	slanderers , haters of God ; they are insolent , arrogant and boastful ; they plan evil schemes ; they disobey their parents ;
CJB	Romans	1	31	they are brainless , faithless , heartless and ruthless .
CJB	Romans	1	32	They know well enough God ’ s righteous decree that people who do such things deserve to die ; yet not only do they keep doing them , but they applaud others who do the same . Footnotes - Romans 1:17 Habakkuk 2:4
CJB	Romans	2	2	We know that God ’ s judgment lands impartially on those who do such things ;
CJB	Romans	2	3	do you think that you , a mere man passing judgment on others who do such things , yet doing them yourself , will escape the judgment of God ?
CJB	Romans	2	4	Or perhaps you despise the riches of his kindness , forbearance and patience ; because you don ’ t realize that God ’ s kindness is intended to lead you to turn from your sins .
CJB	Romans	2	5	But by your stubbornness , by your unrepentant heart , you are storing up anger for yourself on the Day of Anger , when God ’ s righteous judgment will be revealed ;
CJB	Romans	2	6	for he will pay back each one according to his deeds . [ a ]
CJB	Romans	2	7	To those who seek glory , honor and immortality by perseverance in doing good , he will pay back eternal life .
CJB	Romans	2	8	But to those who are self-seeking , who disobey the truth and obey evil , he will pay back wrath and anger .
CJB	Romans	2	9	Yes , he will pay back misery and anguish to every human being who does evil , to the Jew first , then to the Gentile ;
CJB	Romans	2	10	but glory and honor and shalom to everyone who keeps doing what is good , to the Jew first , then to the Gentile .
CJB	Romans	2	11	For God does not show favoritism .
CJB	Romans	2	12	) , Proverbs 24:12 - Romans 2:15 Jeremiah 31:32 (
CJB	Romans	2	13	For it is not merely the hearers of Torah whom God considers righteous ; rather , it is the doers of what Torah says who will be made righteous in God ’ s sight .
CJB	Romans	2	14	) , Deuteronomy 5:17 (
CJB	Romans	2	15	) , Deuteronomy 5:17 (
CJB	Romans	2	16	on a day when God passes judgment on people ’ s inmost secrets . ( According to the Good News as I proclaim it , he does this through the Messiah Yeshua . )
CJB	Romans	2	17	But if you call yourself a Jew and rest on Torah and boast about God
CJB	Romans	2	18	) - Romans 2:24 Isaiah 52:5 , Ezekiel 36:20
CJB	Romans	2	19	) - Romans 2:22 Exodus 20:13 (
CJB	Romans	2	20	an instructor for the spiritually unaware and a teacher of children , since in the Torah you have the embodiment of knowledge and truth ;
CJB	Romans	2	21	then , you who teach others , don ’ t you teach yourself ? Preaching , “ Thou shalt not steal , ” [ c ] do you steal ?
CJB	Romans	2	22	Saying , “ Thou shalt not commit adultery , ” [ d ] do you commit adultery ? Detesting idols , do you commit idolatrous acts ?
CJB	Romans	2	23	You who take such pride in Torah , do you , by disobeying the Torah , dishonor God ? —
CJB	Romans	2	24	as it says in the Tanakh , “ For it is because of you that God ’ s name is blasphemed by the Goyim. ” [ e ]
CJB	Romans	2	25	For circumcision is indeed of value if you do what Torah says . But if you are a transgressor of Torah , your circumcision has become uncircumcision !
CJB	Romans	2	26	Therefore , if an uncircumcised man keeps the righteous requirements of the Torah , won ’ t his uncircumcision be counted as circumcision ?
CJB	Romans	2	27	Indeed , the man who is physically uncircumcised but obeys the Torah will stand as a judgment on you who have had a b ’ rit-milah and have Torah written out but violate it !
CJB	Romans	2	28	For the real Jew is not merely Jewish outwardly : true circumcision is not only external and physical .

CJB	Romans	3	5	Now if our unrighteousness highlights God ’ s righteousness , what should we say ? That God is unrighteous to inflict his anger on us ? ( I am speaking here the way people commonly do . )
CJB	Romans	3	6	Heaven forbid ! Else , how could God judge the world ?
CJB	Romans	3	7	“ But , ” you say , “ if , through my lie , God ’ s truth is enhanced and brings him greater glory , why am I still judged merely for being a sinner ? ”
CJB	Romans	3	8	Indeed ! Why not say ( as some people slander us by claiming we do say ) , “ Let us do evil , so that good may come of it ” ? Against them the judgment is a just one !
CJB	Romans	3	9	) - Romans 3:13 Psalm 140:4 (
CJB	Romans	3	10	As the Tanakh puts it , “ There is no one righteous , not even one ! No one understands ,
CJB	Romans	3	11	no one seeks God ,
CJB	Romans	3	12	all have turned away and at the same time become useless ; there is no one who shows kindness , not a single one ! [ b ]
CJB	Romans	3	13	“ Their throats are open graves , they use their tongues to deceive . [ c ] Vipers ’ venom is under their lips . [ d ]
CJB	Romans	3	14	Their mouths are full of curses and bitterness . [ e ]
CJB	Romans	3	15	“ Their feet rush to shed blood ,
CJB	Romans	3	16	in their ways are ruin and misery ,
CJB	Romans	3	17	and the way of shalom they do not know . [ f ]
CJB	Romans	3	18	“ There is no fear of God before their eyes. ” [ g ]
CJB	Romans	3	19	Moreover , we know that whatever the Torah says , it says to those living within the framework of the Torah , in order that every mouth may be stopped and the whole world be shown to deserve God ’ s adverse judgment .
CJB	Romans	3	20	For in his sight no one alive will be considered righteous [ h ] on the ground of legalistic observance of Torah commands , because what Torah really does is show people how sinful they are .
CJB	Romans	3	21	But now , quite apart from Torah , God ’ s way of making people righteous in his sight has been made clear — although the Torah and the Prophets give their witness to it as well —
CJB	Romans	3	22	and it is a righteousness that comes from God , through the faithfulness of Yeshua the Messiah , to all who continue trusting . For it makes no difference whether one is a Jew or a Gentile ,
CJB	Romans	3	23	since all have sinned and come short of earning God ’ s praise .
CJB	Romans	3	24	By God ’ s grace , without earning it , all are granted the status of being considered righteous before him , through the act redeeming us from our enslavement to sin that was accomplished by the Messiah Yeshua .
CJB	Romans	3	25	God put Yeshua forward as the kapparah for sin through his faithfulness in respect to his bloody sacrificial death . This vindicated God ’ s righteousness ; because , in his forbearance , he had passed over [ with neither punishment nor remission ] the sins people had committed in the past ;
CJB	Romans	3	26	and it vindicates his righteousness in the present age by showing that he is righteous himself and is also the one who makes people righteous on the ground of Yeshua ’ s faithfulness .
CJB	Romans	3	27	So what room is left for boasting ? None at all ! What kind of Torah excludes it ? One that has to do with legalistic observance of rules ? No , rather , a Torah that has to do with trusting .
CJB	Romans	3	28	Therefore , we hold the view that a person comes to be considered righteous by God on the ground of trusting , which has nothing to do with legalistic observance of Torah commands .
CJB	Romans	3	29	Or is God the God of the Jews only ? Isn ’ t he also the God of the Gentiles ? Yes , he is indeed the God of the Gentiles ;
CJB	Romans	3	30	because , as you will admit , God is one . [ i ] Therefore , he will consider righteous the circumcised on the ground of trusting and the uncircumcised through that same trusting .
CJB	Romans	3	31	Does it follow that we abolish Torah by this trusting ? Heaven forbid ! On the contrary , we confirm Torah . Footnotes - Romans 3:4 Psalm 51:6 (
CJB	Romans	3	1	) - Romans 3:20 Psalm 143:2 - Romans 3:30 Deuteronomy 6:4
CJB	Romans	4	4	Now the account of someone who is working is credited not on the ground of grace but on the ground of what is owed him .
CJB	Romans	4	2	For if Avraham came to be considered righteous by God because of legalistic observances , then he has something to boast about . But this is not how it is before God !
CJB	Romans	4	3	For what does the Tanakh say ? “ Avraham put his trust in God , and it was credited to his account as righteousness. ” [ a ]
CJB	Romans	4	5	- Romans 4:17 Genesis 17:5 - Romans 4:18 Genesis 15:5 - Romans 4:22 Genesis 15:6
CJB	Romans	4	6	In the same way , the blessing which David pronounces is on those whom God credits with righteousness apart from legalistic observances :
CJB	Romans	4	7	“ Blessed are those whose transgressions are forgiven , whose sins are covered over ;
CJB	Romans	4	8	Blessed is the man whose sin Adonai will not reckon against his account. ” [ b ]
CJB	Romans	4	9	Now is this blessing for the circumcised only ? Or is it also for the uncircumcised ? For we say that Avraham ’ s trust was credited to his account as righteousness ;
CJB	Romans	4	10	but what state was he in when it was so credited — circumcision or uncircumcision ? Not in circumcision , but in uncircumcision !
CJB	Romans	4	11	In fact , he received circumcision as a sign , as a seal of the righteousness he had been credited with on the ground of the trust he had while he was still uncircumcised . This happened so that he could be the father of every uncircumcised person who trusts and thus has righteousness credited to him ,
CJB	Romans	4	12	and at the same time be the father of every circumcised person who not only has had a b ’ rit-milah , but also follows in the footsteps of the trust which Avraham avinu had when he was still uncircumcised .
CJB	Romans	4	13	For the promise to Avraham and his seed [ c ] that he would inherit the world did not come through legalism but through the righteousness that trust produces .
CJB	Romans	4	14	For if the heirs are produced by legalism , then trust is pointless and the promise worthless .
CJB	Romans	4	15	For what law brings is punishment . But where there is no law , there is also no violation .
CJB	Romans	4	16	The reason the promise is based on trusting is so that it may come as God ’ s free gift , a promise that can be relied on by all the seed , not only those who live within the framework of the Torah , but also those with the kind of trust Avraham had — Avraham avinu for all of us .
CJB	Romans	4	17	This accords with the Tanakh , where it says , “ I have appointed you to be a father to many nations. ” [ d ] Avraham is our father in God ’ s sight because he trusted God as the one who gives life to the dead and calls nonexistent things into existence .
CJB	Romans	4	18	For he was past hope , yet in hope he trusted that he would indeed become a father to many nations , in keeping with what he had been told , “ So many will your seed be. ” [ e ]
CJB	Romans	4	19	His trust did not waver when he considered his own body — which was as good as dead , since he was about a hundred years old — or when he considered that Sarah ’ s womb was dead too .
CJB	Romans	4	20	He did not by lack of trust decide against God ’ s promises . On the contrary , by trust he was given power as he gave glory to God ,
CJB	Romans	4	21	for he was fully convinced that what God had promised he could also accomplish .
CJB	Romans	4	22	This is why it was credited to his account as righteousness . [ f ]
CJB	Romans	4	23	But the words , “ it was credited to his account . . . , ” were not written for him only .
CJB	Romans	4	24	They were written also for us , who will certainly have our account credited too , because we have trusted in him who raised Yeshua our Lord from the dead —
CJB	Romans	4	25	Yeshua , who was delivered over to death because of our offences and raised to life in order to make us righteous . Footnotes - Romans 4:3 Genesis 15:6 - Romans 4:8 Psalm 32:1–2 - Romans 4:13 Genesis 15:3 ,
CJB	Romans	5	5	and this hope does not let us down , because God ’ s love for us has already been poured out in our hearts through the Ruach HaKodesh who has been given to us .
CJB	Romans	5	2	Also through him and on the ground of our trust , we have gained access to this grace in which we stand ; so let us boast about the hope of experiencing God ’ s glory .
CJB	Romans	5	3	But not only that , let us also boast in our troubles ; because we know that trouble produces endurance ,
CJB	Romans	5	4	endurance produces character , and character produces hope ;
CJB	Romans	5	6	For while we were still helpless , at the right time , the Messiah died on behalf of ungodly people .
CJB	Romans	5	7	Now it is a rare event when someone gives up his life even for the sake of somebody righteous , although possibly for a truly good person one might have the courage to die .
CJB	Romans	5	8	But God demonstrates his own love for us in that the Messiah died on our behalf while we were still sinners .
CJB	Romans	5	9	Therefore , since we have now come to be considered righteous by means of his bloody sacrificial death , how much more will we be delivered through him from the anger of God ’ s judgment !
CJB	Romans	5	10	For if we were reconciled with God through his Son ’ s death when we were enemies , how much more will we be delivered by his life , now that we are reconciled !
CJB	Romans	5	11	And not only will we be delivered in the future , but we are boasting about God right now , because he has acted through our Lord Yeshua the Messiah , through whom we have already received that reconciliation .
CJB	Romans	5	12	Here is how it works : it was through one individual that sin entered the world , and through sin , death ; and in this way death passed through to the whole human race , inasmuch as everyone sinned .
CJB	Romans	5	13	Sin was indeed present in the world before Torah was given , but sin is not counted as such when there is no Torah .
CJB	Romans	5	14	Nevertheless death ruled from Adam until Moshe , even over those whose sinning was not exactly like Adam ’ s violation of a direct command . In this , Adam prefigured the one who was to come .
CJB	Romans	5	15	But the free gift is not like the offence . For if , because of one man ’ s offence , many died , then how much more has God ’ s grace , that is , the gracious gift of one man , Yeshua the Messiah , overflowed to many !
CJB	Romans	5	16	No , the free gift is not like what resulted from one man ’ s sinning ; for from one sinner came judgment that brought condemnation ; but the free gift came after many offences and brought acquittal .
CJB	Romans	5	17	For if , because of the offence of one man , death ruled through that one man ; how much more will those receiving the overflowing grace , that is , the gift of being considered righteous , rule in life through the one man Yeshua the Messiah !
CJB	Romans	5	18	In other words , just as it was through one offence that all people came under condemnation , so also it is through one righteous act that all people come to be considered righteous .
CJB	Romans	5	19	For just as through the disobedience of the one man , many were made sinners , so also through the obedience of the other man , many will be made righteous .
CJB	Romans	5	20	And the Torah came into the picture so that the offence would proliferate ; but where sin proliferated , grace proliferated even more .
CJB	Romans	5	21	All this happened so that just as sin ruled by means of death , so also grace might rule through causing people to be considered righteous , so that they might have eternal life , through Yeshua the Messiah , our Lord .
CJB	Romans	6	6	We know that our old self was put to death on the execution-stake with him , so that the entire body of our sinful propensities might be destroyed , and we might no longer be enslaved to sin .
CJB	Romans	6	2	Heaven forbid ! How can we , who have died to sin , still live in it ?
CJB	Romans	6	3	Don ’ t you know that those of us who have been immersed into the Messiah Yeshua have been immersed into his death ?
CJB	Romans	6	4	Through immersion into his death we were buried with him ; so that just as , through the glory of the Father , the Messiah was raised from the dead , likewise we too might live a new life .
CJB	Romans	6	5	For if we have been united with him in a death like his , we will also be united with him in a resurrection like his .
CJB	Romans	6	7	For someone who has died has been cleared from sin .
CJB	Romans	6	8	Now since we died with the Messiah , we trust that we will also live with him .
CJB	Romans	6	9	We know that the Messiah has been raised from the dead , never to die again ; death has no authority over him .
CJB	Romans	6	10	For his death was a unique event that need not be repeated ; but his life , he keeps on living for God .
CJB	Romans	6	11	In the same way , consider yourselves to be dead to sin but alive for God , by your union with the Messiah Yeshua .
CJB	Romans	6	12	Therefore , do not let sin rule in your mortal bodies , so that it makes you obey its desires ;
CJB	Romans	6	13	and do not offer any part of yourselves to sin as an instrument for wickedness . On the contrary , offer yourselves to God as people alive from the dead , and your various parts to God as instruments for righteousness .
CJB	Romans	6	14	For sin will not have authority over you ; because you are not under legalism but under grace .
CJB	Romans	6	15	Therefore , what conclusion should we reach ? “ Let ’ s go on sinning , because we ’ re not under legalism but under grace ” ? Heaven forbid !
CJB	Romans	6	16	Don ’ t you know that if you present yourselves to someone as obedient slaves , then , of the one whom you are obeying , you are slaves — whether of sin , which leads to death , or of obedience , which leads to being made righteous ?
CJB	Romans	6	17	By God ’ s grace , you , who were once slaves to sin , obeyed from your heart the pattern of teaching to which you were exposed ;
CJB	Romans	6	18	and after you had been set free from sin , you became enslaved to righteousness .
CJB	Romans	6	19	( I am using popular language because your human nature is so weak . ) For just as you used to offer your various parts as slaves to impurity and lawlessness , which led to more lawlessness ; so now offer your various parts as slaves to righteousness , which leads to being made holy , set apart for God .
CJB	Romans	6	20	For when you were slaves of sin , you were free in relationship to righteousness ;
CJB	Romans	6	21	but what benefit did you derive from the things of which you are now ashamed ? The end result of those things was death .
CJB	Romans	6	22	However , now , freed from sin and enslaved to God , you do get the benefit — it consists in being made holy , set apart for God , and its end result is eternal life .
CJB	Romans	6	23	For what one earns from sin is death ; but eternal life is what one receives as a free gift from God , in union with the Messiah Yeshua , our Lord .
CJB	Romans	7	7	Therefore , what are we to say ? That the Torah is sinful ? Heaven forbid ! Rather , the function of the Torah was that without it , I would not have known what sin is . For example , I would not have become conscious of what greed is if the Torah had not said , “ Thou shalt not covet. ” [ a ]
CJB	Romans	7	2	For example , a married woman is bound by Torah to her husband while he is alive ; but if the husband dies , she is released from the part of the Torah that deals with husbands .
CJB	Romans	7	3	Therefore , while the husband is alive , she will be called an adulteress if she marries another man ; but if the husband dies , she is free from that part of the Torah ; so that if she marries another man , she is not an adulteress .
CJB	Romans	7	4	Thus , my brothers , you have been made dead with regard to the Torah through the Messiah ’ s body , so that you may belong to someone else , namely , the one who has been raised from the dead , in order for us to bear fruit for God .
CJB	Romans	7	5	For when we were living according to our old nature , the passions connected with sins worked through the Torah in our various parts , with the result that we bore fruit for death .
CJB	Romans	7	6	But now we have been released from this aspect of the Torah , because we have died to that which had us in its clutches , so that we are serving in the new way provided by the Spirit and not in the old way of outwardly following the letter of the law .
CJB	Romans	7	8	But sin , seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment , worked in me all kinds of evil desires — for apart from Torah , sin is dead .
CJB	Romans	7	9	I was once alive outside the framework of Torah . But when the commandment really encountered me , sin sprang to life ,
CJB	Romans	7	10	and I died . The commandment that was intended to bring me life was found to be bringing me death !
CJB	Romans	7	11	For sin , seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment , deceived me ; and through the commandment , sin killed me .
CJB	Romans	7	12	So the Torah is holy ; that is , the commandment is holy , just and good .
CJB	Romans	7	13	Then did something good become for me the source of death ? Heaven forbid ! Rather , it was sin working death in me through something good , so that sin might be clearly exposed as sin , so that sin through the commandment might come to be experienced as sinful beyond measure .
CJB	Romans	7	14	For we know that the Torah is of the Spirit ; but as for me , I am bound to the old nature , sold to sin as a slave .
CJB	Romans	7	15	I don ’ t understand my own behavior — I don ’ t do what I want to do ; instead , I do the very thing I hate !
CJB	Romans	7	16	Now if I am doing what I don ’ t want to do , I am agreeing that the Torah is good .
CJB	Romans	7	17	) , Deuteronomy 5:18 (
CJB	Romans	7	18	For I know that there is nothing good housed inside me — that is , inside my old nature . I can want what is good , but I can ’ t do it !
CJB	Romans	7	19	For I don ’ t do the good I want ; instead , the evil that I don ’ t want is what I do !
CJB	Romans	7	20	But if I am doing what “ the real me ” doesn ’ t want , it is no longer “ the real me ” doing it but the sin housed inside me .
CJB	Romans	7	21	)
CJB	Romans	7	22	For in my inner self I completely agree with God ’ s Torah ;
CJB	Romans	7	23	but in my various parts , I see a different “ torah , ” one that battles with the Torah in my mind and makes me a prisoner of sin ’ s “ torah , ” which is operating in my various parts .
CJB	Romans	7	24	What a miserable creature I am ! Who will rescue me from this body bound for death ?
CJB	Romans	7	25	Thanks be to God [ , he will ] ! — through Yeshua the Messiah , our Lord ! To sum up : with my mind , I am a slave of God ’ s Torah ; but with my old nature , I am a slave of sin ’ s “ Torah. ” Footnotes - Romans 7:7 Exodus 20:14 (
CJB	Romans	8	8	Thus , those who identify with their old nature can not please God .
CJB	Romans	8	2	Why ? Because the Torah of the Spirit , which produces this life in union with Messiah Yeshua , has set me free from the “ Torah ” of sin and death .
CJB	Romans	8	3	For what the Torah could not do by itself , because it lacked the power to make the old nature cooperate , God did by sending his own Son as a human being with a nature like our own sinful one [ but without sin ] . God did this in order to deal with sin , and in so doing he executed the punishment against sin in human nature ,
CJB	Romans	8	4	so that the just requirement of the Torah might be fulfilled in us who do not run our lives according to what our old nature wants but according to what the Spirit wants .
CJB	Romans	8	5	For those who identify with their old nature set their minds on the things of the old nature , but those who identify with the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit .
CJB	Romans	8	6	Having one ’ s mind controlled by the old nature is death , but having one ’ s mind controlled by the Spirit is life and shalom .
CJB	Romans	8	7	For the mind controlled by the old nature is hostile to God , because it does not submit itself to God ’ s Torah — indeed , it can not .
CJB	Romans	8	9	But you , you do not identify with your old nature but with the Spirit — provided the Spirit of God is living inside you , for anyone who doesn ’ t have the Spirit of the Messiah doesn ’ t belong to him .
CJB	Romans	8	10	However , if the Messiah is in you , then , on the one hand , the body is dead because of sin ; but , on the other hand , the Spirit is giving life because God considers you righteous .
CJB	Romans	8	11	And if the Spirit of the One who raised Yeshua from the dead is living in you , then the One who raised the Messiah Yeshua from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit living in you .
CJB	Romans	8	12	So then , brothers , we don ’ t owe a thing to our old nature that would require us to live according to our old nature .
CJB	Romans	8	13	For if you live according to your old nature , you will certainly die ; but if , by the Spirit , you keep putting to death the practices of the body , you will live .
CJB	Romans	8	14	All who are led by God ’ s Spirit are God ’ s sons .
CJB	Romans	8	15	For you did not receive a spirit of slavery to bring you back again into fear ; on the contrary , you received the Spirit , who makes us sons and by whose power we cry out , “ Abba ! ” ( that is , “ Dear Father ! ” ) .
CJB	Romans	8	16	The Spirit himself bears witness with our own spirits that we are children of God ;
CJB	Romans	8	17	and if we are children , then we are also heirs , heirs of God and joint-heirs with the Messiah — provided we are suffering with him in order also to be glorified with him .
CJB	Romans	8	18	I don ’ t think the sufferings we are going through now are even worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed to us in the future .
CJB	Romans	8	19	The creation waits eagerly for the sons of God to be revealed ;
CJB	Romans	8	20	for the creation was made subject to frustration — not willingly , but because of the one who subjected it . But it was given a reliable hope
CJB	Romans	8	21	that it too would be set free from its bondage to decay and would enjoy the freedom accompanying the glory that God ’ s children will have .
CJB	Romans	8	22	)
CJB	Romans	8	23	and not only it , but we ourselves , who have the firstfruits of the Spirit , groan inwardly as we continue waiting eagerly to be made sons — that is , to have our whole bodies redeemed and set free .
CJB	Romans	8	24	It was in this hope that we were saved . But if we see what we hope for , it isn ’ t hope — after all , who hopes for what he already sees ?
CJB	Romans	8	25	But if we continue hoping for something we don ’ t see , then we still wait eagerly for it , with perseverance .
CJB	Romans	8	26	Similarly , the Spirit helps us in our weakness ; for we don ’ t know how to pray the way we should . But the Spirit himself pleads on our behalf with groanings too deep for words ;
CJB	Romans	8	27	and the one who searches hearts knows exactly what the Spirit is thinking , because his pleadings for God ’ s people accord with God ’ s will .
CJB	Romans	8	28	Furthermore , we know that God causes everything to work together for the good of those who love God and are called in accordance with his purpose ;
CJB	Romans	8	29	because those whom he knew in advance , he also determined in advance would be conformed to the pattern of his Son , so that he might be the firstborn among many brothers ;
CJB	Romans	8	30	and those whom he thus determined in advance , he also called ; and those whom he called , he also caused to be considered righteous ; and those whom he caused to be considered righteous he also glorified !
CJB	Romans	8	31	What , then , are we to say to these things ? If God is for us , who can be against us ?
CJB	Romans	8	32	He who did not spare even his own Son , but gave him up on behalf of us all — is it possible that , having given us his Son , he would not give us everything else too ?
CJB	Romans	8	33	So who will bring a charge against God ’ s chosen people ? Certainly not God — he is the one who causes them to be considered righteous !
CJB	Romans	8	34	Who punishes them ? Certainly not the Messiah Yeshua , who died and — more than that — has been raised , is at the right hand of God and is actually pleading on our behalf !
CJB	Romans	8	35	Who will separate us from the love of the Messiah ? Trouble ? Hardship ? Persecution ? Hunger ? Poverty ? Danger ? War ?
CJB	Romans	8	36	As the Tanakh puts it , “ For your sake we are being put to death all day long , we are considered sheep to be slaughtered. ” [ a ]
CJB	Romans	8	37	No , in all these things we are superconquerors , through the one who has loved us .
CJB	Romans	8	38	For I am convinced that neither death nor life , neither angels nor other heavenly rulers , neither what exists nor what is coming ,
CJB	Romans	8	39	neither powers above nor powers below , nor any other created thing will be able to separate us from the love of God which comes to us through the Messiah Yeshua , our Lord . Footnotes - Romans 8:36 Psalm 44:23 (

CJB	Romans	9	4	the people of Isra ’ el ! They were made God ’ s children , the Sh ’ khinah has been with them , the covenants are theirs , likewise the giving of the Torah , the Temple service and the promises ;
CJB	Romans	9	5	the Patriarchs are theirs ; and from them , as far as his physical descent is concerned , came the Messiah , who is over all . Praised be Adonai for ever ! Amen .
CJB	Romans	9	6	But the present condition of Isra ’ el does not mean that the Word of God has failed . For not everyone from Isra ’ el is truly part of Isra ’ el ;
CJB	Romans	9	7	indeed , not all the descendants are seed of Avraham ; [ a ] rather , “ What is to be called your ‘ seed ’ will be in Yitz ’ chak. ” [ b ]
CJB	Romans	9	8	In other words , it is not the physical children who are children of God , but the children the promise refers to who are considered seed .
CJB	Romans	9	10	And even more to the point is the case of Rivkah ; for both her children were conceived in a single act with Yitz ’ chak , our father ;
CJB	Romans	9	11	and before they were born , before they had done anything at all , either good or bad ( so that God ’ s plan might remain a matter of his sovereign choice , not dependent on what they did , but on God , who does the calling ) ,
CJB	Romans	9	12	it was said to her , “ The older will serve the younger. ” [ d ]
CJB	Romans	9	13	This accords with where it is written , “ Ya ‘ akov I loved , but Esav I hated. ” [ e ]
CJB	Romans	9	14	So are we to say , “ It is unjust for God to do this ” ? Heaven forbid !
CJB	Romans	9	15	For to Moshe he says , “ I will have mercy on whom I have mercy , and I will pity whom I pity. ” [ f ]
CJB	Romans	9	16	Thus it doesn ’ t depend on human desires or efforts , but on God , who has mercy .
CJB	Romans	9	17	For the Tanakh says to Pharaoh , “ It is for this very reason that I raised you up , so that in connection with you I might demonstrate my power , so that my name might be known throughout the world. ” [ g ]
CJB	Romans	9	18	So then , he has mercy on whom he wants , and he hardens whom he wants .
CJB	Romans	9	19	But you will say to me , “ Then why does he still find fault with us ? After all , who resists his will ? ”
CJB	Romans	9	20	Who are you , a mere human being , to talk back to God ? Will what is formed say to him who formed it , “ Why did you make me this way ? ” [ h ]
CJB	Romans	9	21	Or has the potter no right to make from a given lump of clay this pot for honorable use and that one for dishonorable ?

CJB	Romans	9	24	that is , to us , whom he called not only from among the Jews but also from among the Gentiles ?
CJB	Romans	9	25	As indeed he says in Hoshea , “ Those who were not my people I will call my people ; her who was not loved I will call loved ;
CJB	Romans	9	26	and in the very place where they were told , ‘ You are not my people , ’ there they will be called sons of the living God ! ” [ i ]
CJB	Romans	9	27	But Yesha ‘ yahu , referring to Isra ’ el , cries out , “ Even if the number of people in Isra ’ el is as large as the number of grains of sand by the sea , only a remnant will be saved .
CJB	Romans	9	28	For Adonai will fulfill his word on the earth with certainty and without delay. ” [ j ]
CJB	Romans	9	29	Also , as Yesha ‘ yahu said earlier , “ If Adonai-Tzva ’ ot had not left us a seed , we would have become like S ’ dom , we would have resembled ‘ Amora. ” [ k ]
CJB	Romans	9	30	So , what are we to say ? This : that Gentiles , even though they were not striving for righteousness , have obtained righteousness ; but it is a righteousness grounded in trusting !
CJB	Romans	9	31	However , Isra ’ el , even though they kept pursuing a Torah that offers righteousness , did not reach what the Torah offers .
CJB	Romans	9	32	Why ? Because they did not pursue righteousness as being grounded in trusting but as if it were grounded in doing legalistic works . They stumbled over the stone that makes people stumble . [ l ]
CJB	Romans	9	33	As the Tanakh puts it , “ Look , I am laying in Tziyon a stone that will make people stumble , a rock that will trip them up . But he who rests his trust on it will not be humiliated. ” [ m ] Footnotes - Romans 9:7
CJB	Romans	10	10	For with the heart one goes on trusting and thus continues toward righteousness , while with the mouth one keeps on making public acknowledgement and thus continues toward deliverance .
CJB	Romans	10	2	for I can testify to their zeal for God . But it is not based on correct understanding ;
CJB	Romans	10	3	for , since they are unaware of God ’ s way of making people righteous and instead seek to set up their own , they have not submitted themselves to God ’ s way of making people righteous .
CJB	Romans	10	4	) - Romans 10:19 Deuteronomy 32:21 - Romans 10:20 Isaiah 65:1 - Romans 10:21 Isaiah 65:2
CJB	Romans	10	5	For Moshe writes about the righteousness grounded in the Torah that the person who does these things will attain life through them . [ a ]
CJB	Romans	10	6	Moreover , the righteousness grounded in trusting says : “ Do not say in your heart , ‘ Who will ascend to heaven ? ’ ” — that is , to bring the Messiah down —
CJB	Romans	10	7	or , “ ‘ Who will descend into Sh ’ ol ? ’ ” — that is , to bring the Messiah up from the dead .
CJB	Romans	10	8	What , then , does it say ? “ The word is near you , in your mouth and in your heart. ” [ b ] — that is , the word about trust which we proclaim , namely ,
CJB	Romans	10	9	that if you acknowledge publicly with your mouth that Yeshua is Lord and trust in your heart that God raised him from the dead , you will be delivered .
CJB	Romans	10	11	For the passage quoted says that everyone who rests his trust on him will not be humiliated . [ c ]
CJB	Romans	10	12	That means that there is no difference between Jew and Gentile — Adonai is the same for everyone , rich toward everyone who calls on him ,
CJB	Romans	10	13	since everyone who calls on the name of Adonai will be delivered . [ d ]
CJB	Romans	10	14	But how can they call on someone if they haven ’ t trusted in him ? And how can they trust in someone if they haven ’ t heard about him ? And how can they hear about someone if no one is proclaiming him ?
CJB	Romans	10	15	And how can people proclaim him unless God sends them ? — as the Tanakh puts it , “ How beautiful are the feet of those announcing good news about good things ! ” [ e ]
CJB	Romans	10	16	The problem is that they haven ’ t all paid attention to the Good News and obeyed it . For Yesha ‘ yahu says , “ Adonai , who has trusted what he has heard from us ? ” [ f ]
CJB	Romans	10	17	So trust comes from what is heard , and what is heard comes through a word proclaimed about the Messiah .
CJB	Romans	10	18	“ But , I say , isn ’ t it rather that they didn ’ t hear ? ” No , they did hear — “ Their voice has gone out throughout the whole world and their words to the ends of the earth. ” [ g ]
CJB	Romans	10	19	“ But , I say , isn ’ t it rather that Isra ’ el didn ’ t understand ? ” “ I will provoke you to jealousy over a non-nation , over a nation void of understanding I will make you angry. ” [ h ]
CJB	Romans	10	20	Moreover , Yesha ‘ yahu boldly says , “ I was found by those who were not looking for me , I became known to those who did not ask for me ” ; [ i ]
CJB	Romans	10	21	but to Isra ’ el he says , “ All day long I held out my hands to a people who kept disobeying and contradicting. ” [ j ] Footnotes - Romans 10:5 Leviticus 18:5 - Romans 10:8 Deuteronomy 30:11–14 - Romans 10:11 Isaiah 28:16 - Romans 10:13 Joel 3:5 ( 2:32 ) - Romans 10:15 Isaiah 52:7 - Romans 10:16 Isaiah 53:1 - Romans 10:18 Psalm 19:5 (

CJB	Romans	11	5	It ’ s the same way in the present age : there is a remnant , chosen by grace .
CJB	Romans	11	6	( Now if it is by grace , it is accordingly not based on legalistic works ; if it were otherwise , grace would no longer be grace . )
CJB	Romans	11	7	What follows is that Isra ’ el has not attained the goal for which she is striving . The ones chosen have obtained it , but the rest have been made stonelike ,
CJB	Romans	11	8	just as the Tanakh says , “ God has given them a spirit of dullness — eyes that do not see and ears that do not hear , right down to the present day. ” [ e ]
CJB	Romans	11	9	And David says , “ Let their dining table become for them a snare and a trap , a pitfall and a punishment .
CJB	Romans	11	10	Let their eyes be darkened , so that they can ’ t see , with their backs bent continually. ” [ f ]
CJB	Romans	11	12	Moreover , if their stumbling is bringing riches to the world — that is , if Isra ’ el ’ s being placed temporarily in a condition less favored than that of the Gentiles is bringing riches to the latter — how much greater riches will Isra ’ el in its fullness bring them !
CJB	Romans	11	13	However , to those of you who are Gentiles I say this : since I myself am an emissary sent to the Gentiles , I make known the importance of my work
CJB	Romans	11	14	- Romans 11:4
CJB	Romans	11	15	For if their casting Yeshua aside means reconciliation for the world , what will their accepting him mean ? It will be life from the dead !
CJB	Romans	11	16	Now if the hallah offered as firstfruits is holy , so is the whole loaf . And if the root is holy , so are the branches .
CJB	Romans	11	17	But if some of the branches were broken off , and you — a wild olive — were grafted in among them and have become equal sharers in the rich root of the olive tree ,
CJB	Romans	11	18	then don ’ t boast as if you were better than the branches ! However , if you do boast , remember that you are not supporting the root , the root is supporting you .
CJB	Romans	11	19	So you will say , “ Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in. ”
CJB	Romans	11	20	True , but so what ? They were broken off because of their lack of trust . However , you keep your place only because of your trust . So don ’ t be arrogant ; on the contrary , be terrified !
CJB	Romans	11	21	For if God did not spare the natural branches , he certainly won ’ t spare you !
CJB	Romans	11	22	So take a good look at God ’ s kindness and his severity : on the one hand , severity toward those who fell off ; but , on the other hand , God ’ s kindness toward you — provided you maintain yourself in that kindness ! Otherwise , you too will be cut off !
CJB	Romans	11	23	Moreover , the others , if they do not persist in their lack of trust , will be grafted in ; because God is able to graft them back in .
CJB	Romans	11	24	For if you were cut out of what is by nature a wild olive tree and grafted , contrary to nature , into a cultivated olive tree , how much more will these natural branches be grafted back into their own olive tree !
CJB	Romans	11	25	For , brothers , I want you to understand this truth which God formerly concealed but has now revealed , so that you won ’ t imagine you know more than you actually do . It is that stoniness , to a degree , has come upon Isra ’ el , until the Gentile world enters in its fullness ;
CJB	Romans	11	26	and that it is in this way that all Isra ’ el will be saved . As the Tanakh says , “ Out of Tziyon will come the Redeemer ; he will turn away ungodliness from Ya ‘ akov
CJB	Romans	11	27	and this will be my covenant with them , . . . when I take away their sins. ” [ h ]
CJB	Romans	11	28	With respect to the Good News they are hated for your sake . But with respect to being chosen they are loved for the Patriarchs ’ sake ,
CJB	Romans	11	29	for God ’ s free gifts and his calling are irrevocable .
CJB	Romans	11	30	Just as you yourselves were disobedient to God before but have received mercy now because of Isra ’ el ’ s disobedience ;
CJB	Romans	11	31	so also Isra ’ el has been disobedient now , so that by your showing them the same mercy that God has shown you , they too may now receive God ’ s mercy .
CJB	Romans	11	32	For God has shut up all mankind together in disobedience , in order that he might show mercy to all .
CJB	Romans	11	33	O the depth of the riches and the wisdom and knowledge of God ! How inscrutable are his judgments ! How unsearchable are his ways !
CJB	Romans	11	34	For , ‘ Who has known the mind of the Lord ? Who has been his counselor ? ’ [ i ]
CJB	Romans	11	35	Or , ‘ Who has given him anything and made him pay it back ? ’ [ j ]
CJB	Romans	11	36	For from him and through him and to him are all things . To him be the glory forever ! Amen . Footnotes - Romans 11:1
CJB	Romans	11	1	Kings 19:18 - Romans 11:8 Deuteronomy 29:3 (
CJB	Romans	12	12	Rejoice in your hope , be patient in your troubles , and continue steadfastly in prayer .
CJB	Romans	12	2	In other words , do not let yourselves be conformed to the standards of the ‘ olam hazeh . Instead , keep letting yourselves be transformed by the renewing of your minds ; so that you will know what God wants and will agree that what he wants is good , satisfying and able to succeed .
CJB	Romans	12	3	For I am telling every single one of you , through the grace that has been given to me , not to have exaggerated ideas about your own importance . Instead , develop a sober estimate of yourself based on the standard which God has given to each of you , namely , trust .
CJB	Romans	12	4	For just as there are many parts that compose one body , but the parts don ’ t all have the same function ;
CJB	Romans	12	5	so there are many of us , and in union with the Messiah we comprise one body , with each of us belonging to the others .
CJB	Romans	12	6	But we have gifts that differ and which are meant to be used according to the grace that has been given to us . If your gift is prophecy , use it to the extent of your trust ;
CJB	Romans	12	7	if it is serving , use it to serve ; if you are a teacher , use your gift in teaching ;
CJB	Romans	12	8	if you are a counselor , use your gift to comfort and exhort ; if you are someone who gives , do it simply and generously ; if you are in a position of leadership , lead with diligence and zeal ; if you are one who does acts of mercy , do them cheerfully .
CJB	Romans	12	9	Don ’ t let love be a mere outward show . Recoil from what is evil , and cling to what is good .
CJB	Romans	12	10	Love each other devotedly and with brotherly love ; and set examples for each other in showing respect .
CJB	Romans	12	11	Don ’ t be lazy when hard work is needed , but serve the Lord with spiritual fervor .
CJB	Romans	12	13	Share what you have with God ’ s people , and practice hospitality .
CJB	Romans	12	14	Bless those who persecute you — bless them , don ’ t curse them !
CJB	Romans	12	15	Rejoice with those who rejoice , and weep with those who weep .
CJB	Romans	12	16	Be sensitive to each other ’ s needs — don ’ t think yourselves better than others , but make humble people your friends . Don ’ t be conceited .
CJB	Romans	12	17	Repay no one evil for evil , but try to do what everyone regards as good .
CJB	Romans	12	18	If possible , and to the extent that it depends on you , live in peace with all people .
CJB	Romans	12	19	Never seek revenge , my friends ; instead , leave that to God ’ s anger ; for in the Tanakh it is written , “ Adonai says , ‘ Vengeance is my responsibility ; I will repay. ’ ” [ a ]
CJB	Romans	12	20	On the contrary , “ If your enemy is hungry , feed him ; if he is thirsty , give him something to drink . For by doing this , you will heap fiery coals [ of shame ] on his head. ” [ b ]
CJB	Romans	12	21	Do not be conquered by evil , but conquer evil with good . Footnotes - Romans 12:19 Deuteronomy 32:41 - Romans 12:20 Proverbs 25:21–22
CJB	Romans	13	13	Let us live properly , as people do in the daytime — not partying and getting drunk , not engaging in sexual immorality and other excesses , not quarrelling and being jealous .
CJB	Romans	13	2	Therefore , whoever resists the authorities is resisting what God has instituted ; and those who resist will bring judgment on themselves .
CJB	Romans	13	3	For rulers are no terror to good conduct , but to bad . Would you like to be unafraid of the person in authority ? Then simply do what is good , and you will win his approval ;
CJB	Romans	13	4	for he is God ’ s servant , there for your benefit . But if you do what is wrong , be afraid ! Because it is not for nothing that he holds the power of the sword ; for he is God ’ s servant , there as an avenger to punish wrongdoers .
CJB	Romans	13	5	Another reason to obey , besides fear of punishment , is for the sake of conscience .
CJB	Romans	13	6	This is also why you pay taxes ; for the authorities are God ’ s public officials , constantly attending to these duties .
CJB	Romans	13	7	Pay everyone what he is owed : if you owe the tax-collector , pay your taxes ; if you owe the revenue-collector , pay revenue ; if you owe someone respect , pay him respect ; if you owe someone honor , pay him honor .
CJB	Romans	13	8	Don ’ t owe anyone anything — except to love one another ; for whoever loves his fellow human being has fulfilled Torah .
CJB	Romans	13	9	For the commandments , “ Don ’ t commit adultery , ” “ Don ’ t murder , ” “ Don ’ t steal , ” “ Don ’ t covet , ” [ a ] and any others are summed up in this one rule : “ Love your neighbor as yourself. ” [ b ]
CJB	Romans	13	10	Love does not do harm to a neighbor ; therefore love is the fullness of Torah .
CJB	Romans	13	11	Besides all this , you know at what point of history we stand ; so it is high time for you to rouse yourselves from sleep ; for the final deliverance is nearer than when we first came to trust .
CJB	Romans	13	12	The night is almost over , the day is almost here . So let us put aside the deeds of darkness and arm ourselves with the weapons of light .
CJB	Romans	13	14	Instead , clothe yourselves with the Lord Yeshua the Messiah ; and don ’ t waste your time thinking about how to provide for the sinful desires of your old nature . Footnotes - Romans 13:9 Exodus 20:13–14 (
CJB	Romans	13	17	) , Deuteronomy 5:17–18 (
CJB	Romans	13	21	) - Romans 13:9 Leviticus 19:18
CJB	Romans	14	14	I know — that is , I have been persuaded by the Lord Yeshua the Messiah — that nothing is unclean in itself . But if a person considers something unclean , then for him it is unclean ;
CJB	Romans	14	2	One person has the trust that will allow him to eat anything , while another whose trust is weak eats only vegetables .
CJB	Romans	14	3	The one who eats anything must not look down on the one who abstains ; and the abstainer must not pass judgment on the one who eats anything , because God has accepted him —
CJB	Romans	14	4	who are you to pass judgment on someone else ’ s servant ? It is before his own master that he will stand or fall ; and the fact is that he will stand , because the Lord is able to make him stand .
CJB	Romans	14	5	One person considers some days more holy than others , while someone else regards them as being all alike . What is important is for each to be fully convinced in his own mind .
CJB	Romans	14	6	He who observes a day as special does so to honor the Lord . Also he who eats anything , eats to honor the Lord , since he gives thanks to God ; likewise the abstainer abstains to honor the Lord , and he too gives thanks to God .
CJB	Romans	14	7	For none of us lives only in relation to himself , and none of us dies only in relation to himself ;
CJB	Romans	14	8	for if we live , we live in relation to the Lord ; and if we die , we die in relation to the Lord . So whether we live or die , we belong to the Lord —
CJB	Romans	14	9	indeed , it was for this very reason that the Messiah died and came back to life , so that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living .
CJB	Romans	14	10	You then , why do you pass judgment on your brother ? Or why do you look down on your brother ? For all of us will stand before God ’ s judgment seat ;
CJB	Romans	14	11	since it is written in the Tanakh , “ As I live , says Adonai , every knee will bend before me , and every tongue will publicly acknowledge God. ” [ a ]
CJB	Romans	14	12	So then , every one of us will have to give an account of himself to God .
CJB	Romans	14	13	Therefore , let ’ s stop passing judgment on each other ! Instead , make this one judgment — not to put a stumbling block or a snare in a brother ’ s way .
CJB	Romans	14	15	and if your brother is being upset by the food you eat , your life is no longer one of love . Do not , by your eating habits , destroy someone for whom the Messiah died !
CJB	Romans	14	16	Do not let what you know to be good , be spoken of as bad ;
CJB	Romans	14	17	for the Kingdom of God is not eating and drinking , but righteousness , shalom and joy in the Ruach HaKodesh .
CJB	Romans	14	18	Anyone who serves the Messiah in this fashion both pleases God and wins the approval of other people .
CJB	Romans	14	19	So then , let us pursue the things that make for shalom and mutual upbuilding .
CJB	Romans	14	20	Don ’ t tear down God ’ s work for the sake of food . True enough , all things are clean ; but it is wrong for anybody by his eating to cause someone to fall away .
CJB	Romans	14	21	What is good is not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything that causes your brother to stumble .
CJB	Romans	14	22	The belief you hold about such things , keep between yourself and God . Happy the person who is free of self-condemnation when he approves of something !
CJB	Romans	14	23	But the doubter comes under condemnation if he eats , because his action is not based on trust . And anything not based on trust is a sin . Footnotes - Romans 14:11 Isaiah 45:23
CJB	Romans	15	15	But on some points I have written you quite boldly by way of reminding you about them , because of the grace God has given me
CJB	Romans	15	2	Samuel 22:50 , Psalm 18:50 (
CJB	Romans	15	3	For even the Messiah did not please himself ; rather , as the Tanakh says , ‘ The insults of those insulting you fell on me. ’ [ a ]
CJB	Romans	15	4	For everything written in the past was written to teach us , so that with the encouragement of the Tanakh we might patiently hold on to our hope .
CJB	Romans	15	5	And may God , the source of encouragement and patience , give you the same attitude among yourselves as the Messiah Yeshua had ,
CJB	Romans	15	6	so that with one accord and with one voice you may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah .
CJB	Romans	15	7	So welcome each other , just as the Messiah has welcomed you into God ’ s glory .
CJB	Romans	15	8	For I say that the Messiah became a servant of the Jewish people in order to show God ’ s truthfulness by making good his promises to the Patriarchs ,
CJB	Romans	15	9	) - Romans 15:9
CJB	Romans	15	10	And again it says , “ Gentiles , rejoice with his people. ” [ c ]
CJB	Romans	15	11	And again , “ Praise Adonai , all Gentiles ! Let all peoples praise him ! ” [ d ]
CJB	Romans	15	12	And again , Yesha ‘ yahu says , “ The root of Yishai will come , he who arises to rule Gentiles ; Gentiles will put their hope in him. ” [ e ]
CJB	Romans	15	13	May God , the source of hope , fill you completely with joy and shalom as you continue trusting , so that by the power of the Ruach HaKodesh you may overflow with hope .
CJB	Romans	15	14	Now I myself am convinced , my brothers , that you are full of goodness , filled with knowledge and well able to counsel each other .
CJB	Romans	15	16	to be a servant of the Messiah Yeshua for the Gentiles , with the priestly duty of presenting the Good News of God , so that the Gentiles may be an acceptable offering , made holy by the Ruach HaKodesh .
CJB	Romans	15	17	In union with the Messiah Yeshua , then , I have reason to be proud of my service to God ;
CJB	Romans	15	18	for I will not dare speak of anything except what the Messiah has accomplished through me to bring the Gentiles to obedience by my words and deeds ,
CJB	Romans	15	19	through the power of signs and miracles , through the power of the Spirit of God . So from Yerushalayim all the way to Illyricum I have fully proclaimed the Good News of the Messiah .
CJB	Romans	15	20	I have always made it my ambition to proclaim the Good News where the Messiah was not yet known , so that I would not be building on someone else ’ s foundation ,
CJB	Romans	15	21	but rather , as the Tanakh puts it , “ Those who have not been told about him will see , and those who have not heard will understand. ” [ f ]
CJB	Romans	15	22	This is also why I have so often been prevented from visiting you .
CJB	Romans	15	23	But now , since there is no longer a place in these regions that needs me , and since I have wanted for many years to come to you ,
CJB	Romans	15	24	I hope to see you as I pass through on my way to Spain , and to have you help me travel there after I have enjoyed your company awhile .
CJB	Romans	15	25	But now I am going to Yerushalayim with aid for God ’ s people there .
CJB	Romans	15	26	For Macedonia and Achaia thought it would be good to make some contribution to the poor among God ’ s people in Yerushalayim .
CJB	Romans	15	27	They were pleased to do it , but the fact is that they owe it to them . For if the Gentiles have shared with the Jews in spiritual matters , then the Gentiles clearly have a duty to help the Jews in material matters .
CJB	Romans	15	28	So when I have finished this task and made certain that they have received this fruit , I will leave for Spain and visit you on my way there ;
CJB	Romans	15	29	and I know that when I come to you , it will be with the full measure of the Messiah ’ s blessings .
CJB	Romans	15	30	And now I urge you , brothers , by our Lord Yeshua the Messiah and by the love of the Spirit , to join me in my struggle by praying to God on my behalf
CJB	Romans	15	31	that I will be rescued from the unbelievers in Y ’ hudah , and that my service for Yerushalayim will be acceptable to God ’ s people there .
CJB	Romans	15	32	Then , if it is God ’ s will , I will come to you with joy and have a time of rest among you .
CJB	Romans	15	33	Now may the God of shalom be with you all . Amen . Footnotes - Romans 15:3 Psalm 69:10 (

CJB	Romans	16	16	Greet one another with a holy kiss . All the Messiah ’ s congregations send their greetings to you .
CJB	Romans	16	2	so that you may welcome her in the Lord , as God ’ s people should , and give her whatever assistance she may need from you ; for she has been a big help to many people — including myself .
CJB	Romans	16	3	Give my greetings to Priscilla and Aquila , my fellow workers for the Messiah Yeshua .
CJB	Romans	16	4	They risked their necks to save my life ; not only I thank them , but also all the Messianic communities among the Gentiles .
CJB	Romans	16	5	And give my greetings to the congregation that meets in their house . Give my greetings to my dear friend Epaenetus , who was the first person in the province of Asia to put his trust in the Messiah .
CJB	Romans	16	6	Give my greetings to Miryam , who has worked very hard for you .
CJB	Romans	16	7	Greetings to Andronicus and Junia , relatives of mine who were in prison with me . They are well known among the emissaries ; also they came to trust in the Messiah before I did .
CJB	Romans	16	8	Greetings to Ampliatus , my dear friend in the Lord .
CJB	Romans	16	9	Greetings to Urbanus , our fellow worker for the Messiah , and to my dear friend Stachys .
CJB	Romans	16	10	Greetings to Appeles , whose trust in the Messiah has been tested and proved . Greet those in the household of Aristobulus .
CJB	Romans	16	11	Greet my relative , Herodion .
CJB	Romans	16	12	Greet Tryphaena and Tryphosa , women who are working hard for the Lord . Greet my dear friend Persis , another woman who has done a lot of hard work for the Lord .
CJB	Romans	16	13	Greet Rufus , chosen by the Lord , and his mother , who has been a mother to me too .
CJB	Romans	16	14	Greet Asyncritus , Phlegon , Hermes , Patrobas , Hermas and the brothers who are with them .
CJB	Romans	16	15	Greet Philologus , Julia , Nereus and his sister , and Olympas , and all of God ’ s people who are with them .
CJB	Romans	16	17	I urge you , brothers , to watch out for those who cause divisions and put snares alongside the teaching in which you have been trained — keep away from them .
CJB	Romans	16	18	For men like these are not serving our Lord the Messiah but their own belly ; by smooth talk and flattery they deceive the innocent .
CJB	Romans	16	19	For everyone has heard about your obedience ; therefore I rejoice over you . However , I want you to be wise concerning good , but innocent concerning evil .
CJB	Romans	16	20	And God , the source of shalom , will soon crush the Adversary under your feet . The grace of our Lord Yeshua be with you .
CJB	Romans	16	21	Timothy , my fellow-worker , sends greetings to you ; so do Lucius , Jason and Sosipater , my relatives .
CJB	Romans	16	22	I , Tertius , the one writing down this letter , greet you in the Lord .
CJB	Romans	16	23	My host Gaius , in whose home the whole congregation meets , greets you . Erastus the city treasurer and brother Quartus greet you .
CJB	Romans	16	24	: The grace of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah be with you all . Amen .
CJB	Romans	16	25	Now to God , who can strengthen you , according to my Good News , in harmony with the revelation of the secret truth which is the proclamation of Yeshua the Messiah , kept hidden in silence for ages and ages ,
CJB	Romans	16	26	but manifested now through prophetic writings , in keeping with the command of God the Eternal , and communicated to all the Gentiles to promote in them trust-grounded obedience —
CJB	Romans	16	27	to the only wise God , through Yeshua the Messiah , be the glory forever and ever ! Amen . Footnotes - Romans 16:24 Some manuscripts have verse
CJB	1%20Corinthians	1	1	Corinthians 1:31 Jeremiah 9:23 (
CJB	1%20Corinthians	1	2	To : God ’ s Messianic community in Corinth , consisting of those who have been set apart by Yeshua the Messiah and called to be God ’ s holy people — along with everyone everywhere who calls on the name of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah , their Lord as well as ours :
CJB	1%20Corinthians	1	3	Grace to you and shalom from God our Father and the Lord Yeshua the Messiah .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	1	4	I thank my God always for you because of God ’ s love and kindness given to you through the Messiah Yeshua ,
CJB	1%20Corinthians	1	5	in that you have been enriched by him in so many ways , particularly in power of speech and depth of knowledge .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	1	6	Indeed , the testimony about the Messiah has become firmly established in you ;
CJB	1%20Corinthians	1	7	so that you are not lacking any spiritual gift and are eagerly awaiting the revealing of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	1	8	He will enable you to hold out until the end and thus be blameless on the Day of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah —
CJB	1%20Corinthians	1	9	God is trustworthy : it was he who called you into fellowship with his Son , Yeshua the Messiah , our Lord .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	1	10	Nevertheless , brothers , I call on you in the name of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah to agree , all of you , in what you say , and not to let yourselves remain split into factions but be restored to having a common mind and a common purpose .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	1	11	For some of Chloe ’ s people have made it known to me , my brothers , that there are quarrels among you .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	1	12	I say this because one of you says , “ I follow Sha ’ ul ” ; another says , “ I follow Apollos ” ; another , “ I follow Kefa ” ; while still another says , “ I follow the Messiah ! ”
CJB	1%20Corinthians	1	13	Has the Messiah been split in pieces ? Was it Sha ’ ul who was put to death on a stake for you ? Were you immersed into the name of Sha ’ ul ?
CJB	1%20Corinthians	1	14	I thank God that I didn ’ t immerse any of you except Crispus and Gaius —
CJB	1%20Corinthians	1	15	otherwise someone might say that you were indeed immersed into my name .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	1	16	( Oh yes , I did also immerse Stephanas and his household ; beyond that , I can ’ t remember whether I immersed anyone else . )
CJB	1%20Corinthians	1	17	For the Messiah did not send me to immerse but to proclaim the Good News — and to do it without relying on “ wisdom ” that consists of mere rhetoric , so as not to rob the Messiah ’ s execution-stake of its power .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	1	18	For the message about the execution-stake is nonsense to those in the process of being destroyed , but to us in the process of being saved it is the power of God .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	1	19	Indeed , the Tanakh says , “ I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and frustrate the intelligence of the intelligent. ” [ a ]
CJB	1%20Corinthians	1	20	Where does that leave the philosopher , the Torah-teacher , or any of today ’ s thinkers ? Hasn ’ t God made this world ’ s wisdom look pretty foolish ?
CJB	1%20Corinthians	1	21	For God ’ s wisdom ordained that the world , using its own wisdom , would not come to know him . Therefore God decided to use the “ nonsense ” of what we proclaim as his means of saving those who come to trust in it .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	1	22	Precisely because Jews ask for signs and Greeks try to find wisdom ,
CJB	1%20Corinthians	1	23	we go on proclaiming a Messiah executed on a stake as a criminal ! To Jews this is an obstacle , and to Greeks it is nonsense ;
CJB	1%20Corinthians	1	24	)
CJB	1%20Corinthians	1	25	For God ’ s “ nonsense ” is wiser than humanity ’ s “ wisdom. ” And God ’ s “ weakness ” is stronger than humanity ’ s “ strength. ”
CJB	1%20Corinthians	1	26	Just look at yourselves , brothers — look at those whom God has called ! Not many of you are wise by the world ’ s standards , not many wield power or boast noble birth .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	1	27	But God chose what the world considers nonsense in order to shame the wise ; God chose what the world considers weak in order to shame the strong ;
CJB	1%20Corinthians	1	28	and God chose what the world looks down on as common or regards as nothing in order to bring to nothing what the world considers important ;
CJB	1%20Corinthians	1	29	so that no one should boast before God .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	1	30	It is his doing that you are united with the Messiah Yeshua . He has become wisdom for us from God , and righteousness and holiness and redemption as well !
CJB	1%20Corinthians	1	31	Therefore — as the Tanakh says — “ Let anyone who wants to boast , boast about Adonai. ” [ b ] Footnotes -
CJB	1%20Corinthians	2	1	Corinthians 2:16 Isaiah 40:13
CJB	1%20Corinthians	2	2	for I had decided that while I was with you I would forget everything except Yeshua the Messiah , and even him only as someone who had been executed on a stake as a criminal .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	2	3	Also I myself was with you as somebody weak , nervous and shaking all over from fear ;
CJB	1%20Corinthians	2	4	) , 52:15 -
CJB	1%20Corinthians	2	5	so that your trust might not rest on human wisdom but on God ’ s power .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	2	6	Yet there is a wisdom that we are speaking to those who are mature enough for it . But it is not the wisdom of this world or of this world ’ s leaders , who are in the process of passing away .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	2	7	On the contrary , we are communicating a secret wisdom from God which has been hidden until now but which , before history began , God had decreed would bring us glory .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	2	8	Not one of this world ’ s leaders has understood it ; because if they had , they would not have executed the Lord from whom this glory flows .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	2	9	But , as the Tanakh says , “ No eye has seen , no ear has heard and no one ’ s heart has imagined all the things that God has prepared for those who love him. ” [ a ]
CJB	1%20Corinthians	2	10	It is to us , however , that God has revealed these things . How ? Through the Spirit . For the Spirit probes all things , even the profoundest depths of God .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	2	11	For who knows the inner workings of a person except the person ’ s own spirit inside him ? So too no one knows the inner workings of God except God ’ s Spirit .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	2	12	Now we have not received the spirit of the world but the Spirit of God , so that we might understand the things God has so freely given us .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	2	13	These are the things we are talking about when we avoid the manner of speaking that human wisdom would dictate and instead use a manner of speaking taught by the Spirit , by which we explain things of the Spirit to people who have the Spirit .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	2	14	Now the natural man does not receive the things from the Spirit of God — to him they are nonsense ! Moreover , he is unable to grasp them , because they are evaluated through the Spirit .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	2	15	But the person who has the Spirit can evaluate everything , while no one is in a position to evaluate him .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	2	16	For who has known the mind of Adonai ? Who will counsel him ? [ b ] But we have the mind of the Messiah ! Footnotes -
CJB	1%20Corinthians	3	1	Corinthians 3:20 Psalm 94:11
CJB	1%20Corinthians	3	3	For you are still worldly ! Isn ’ t it obvious from all the jealousy and quarrelling among you that you are worldly and living by merely human standards ?
CJB	1%20Corinthians	3	2	I gave you milk , not solid food , because you were not yet ready for it . But you aren ’ t ready for it now either !
CJB	1%20Corinthians	3	4	For when one says , “ I follow Sha ’ ul ” and another , “ I follow Apollos , ” aren ’ t you being merely human ?
CJB	1%20Corinthians	3	5	After all , what is Apollos ? What is Sha ’ ul ? Only servants through whom you came to trust . Indeed , it was the Lord who brought you to trust through one of us or through another .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	3	6	I planted the seed , and Apollos watered it , but it was God who made it grow .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	3	7	So neither the planter nor the waterer is anything , only God who makes things grow —
CJB	1%20Corinthians	3	8	planter and waterer are the same . However , each will be rewarded according to his work .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	3	9	For we are God ’ s co-workers ; you are God ’ s field , God ’ s building .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	3	10	Using the grace God gave me , I laid a foundation , like a skilled master-builder ; and another man is building on it . But let each one be careful how he builds .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	3	11	For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid , which is Yeshua the Messiah .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	3	12	Some will use gold , silver or precious stones in building on this foundation ; while others will use wood , grass or straw .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	3	13	But each one ’ s work will be shown for what it is ; the Day will disclose it , because it will be revealed by fire — the fire will test the quality of each one ’ s work .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	3	14	If the work someone has built on the foundation survives , he will receive a reward ;
CJB	1%20Corinthians	3	15	if it is burned up , he will have to bear the loss : he will still escape with his life , but it will be like escaping through a fire .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	3	16	Don ’ t you know that you people are God ’ s temple and that God ’ s Spirit lives in you ?
CJB	1%20Corinthians	3	17	So if anyone destroys God ’ s temple , God will destroy him . For God ’ s temple is holy , and you yourselves are that temple .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	3	18	Let no one fool himself . If someone among you thinks he is wise ( by this world ’ s standards ) , let him become “ foolish , ” so that he may become really wise .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	3	19	For the wisdom of this world is nonsense , as far as God is concerned ; inasmuch as the Tanakh says , “ He traps the wise in their own cleverness , ” [ a ]
CJB	1%20Corinthians	3	20	and again , “ Adonai knows that the thoughts of the wise are worthless. ” [ b ]
CJB	1%20Corinthians	3	21	So let no one boast about human beings , for all things are yours —
CJB	1%20Corinthians	3	22	whether Sha ’ ul or Apollos or Kefa or the world or life or death or the present or the future : they all belong to you ,
CJB	1%20Corinthians	3	23	and you belong to the Messiah , and the Messiah belongs to God . Footnotes -
CJB	1%20Corinthians	4	1	Corinthians
CJB	1%20Corinthians	4	4	I am not aware of anything against me , but this does not make me innocent . The one who is evaluating me is the Lord .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	4	2	Now the one thing that is asked of a trustee is that he be found trustworthy .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	4	3	And it matters very little to me how I am evaluated by you or by any human court ; in fact , I don ’ t even evaluate myself .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	4	5	So don ’ t pronounce judgment prematurely , before the Lord comes ; for he will bring to light what is now hidden in darkness ; he will expose the motives of people ’ s hearts ; and then each will receive from God whatever praise he deserves .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	4	6	Now in what I have said here , brothers , I have used myself and Apollos as examples to teach you not to go beyond what the Tanakh says , proudly taking the side of one leader against another .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	4	7	After all , what makes you so special ? What do you have that you didn ’ t receive as a gift ? And if in fact it was a gift , why do you boast as if it weren ’ t ?
CJB	1%20Corinthians	4	8	You are glutted already ? You are rich already ? You have become kings , even though we are not ? Well , I wish you really were kings , so that we might share the kingship with you !
CJB	1%20Corinthians	4	9	For I think God has been placing us emissaries on display at the tail of the parade , like men condemned to die in the public arena : we have become a spectacle before the whole universe , angels as well as men .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	4	10	For the Messiah ’ s sake we are fools , but united with the Messiah you are wise ! We are weak , but you are strong ; you are honored , but we are dishonored .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	4	11	Till this very moment we go hungry and thirsty , we are dressed in rags , we are treated roughly , we wander from place to place ,
CJB	1%20Corinthians	4	12	we exhaust ourselves working with our own hands for our living . When we are cursed , we keep on blessing ; when we are persecuted , we go on putting up with it ;
CJB	1%20Corinthians	4	13	when we are slandered , we continue making our appeal . We are the world ’ s garbage , the scum of the earth — yes , to this moment !
CJB	1%20Corinthians	4	14	I am not writing you this to make you feel ashamed , but , as my dear children , to confront you and get you to change .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	4	15	For even if you have ten thousand trainers in connection with the Messiah , you do not have many fathers ; for in connection with the Messiah Yeshua it was I who became your father by means of the Good News .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	4	16	Therefore I urge you to imitate me .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	4	17	This is why I have sent you Timothy , my beloved and trustworthy child in the Lord . He will remind you of the way of life I follow in union with the Messiah Yeshua and teach everywhere in every congregation .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	4	18	When I didn ’ t come to visit you , some of you became arrogant .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	4	19	But I am coming to you soon , if the Lord wills ; and I will take cognizance not of the talk of these arrogant people but of their power .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	4	20	For the Kingdom of God is not a matter of words but of power .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	4	21	Which do you prefer — should I come to you with a stick ? or with love in a spirit of gentleness ?
CJB	1%20Corinthians	5	1	Corinthians 5:13 Deuteronomy 13:6 (
CJB	1%20Corinthians	5	5	) ; 17:7,12 ; 19:19 ; 21:21 ; 22:21 ,
CJB	1%20Corinthians	5	2	And you stay proud ? Shouldn ’ t you rather have felt some sadness that would have led you to remove from your company the man who has done this thing ?
CJB	1%20Corinthians	5	3	For I myself , even though I am absent physically , am with you spiritually ; and I have already judged the man who has done this as if I were present .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	5	4	In the name of the Lord Yeshua , when you are assembled , with me present spiritually and the power of our Lord Yeshua among us ,
CJB	1%20Corinthians	5	6	Your boasting is not good . Don ’ t you know the saying , “ It takes only a little hametz to leaven a whole batch of dough ? ”
CJB	1%20Corinthians	5	7	Get rid of the old hametz , so that you can be a new batch of dough , because in reality you are unleavened . For our Pesach lamb , the Messiah , has been sacrificed .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	5	8	So let us celebrate the Seder not with leftover hametz , the hametz of wickedness and evil , but with the matzah of purity and truth .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	5	9	In my earlier letter I wrote you not to associate with people who engage in sexual immorality .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	5	10	I didn ’ t mean the sexually immoral people outside your community , or the greedy , or the thieves or the idol-worshippers — for then you would have to leave the world altogether !
CJB	1%20Corinthians	5	11	No , what I wrote you was not to associate with anyone who is supposedly a brother but who also engages in sexual immorality , is greedy , worships idols , is abusive , gets drunk or steals . With such a person you shouldn ’ t even eat !
CJB	1%20Corinthians	5	12	For what business is it of mine to judge outsiders ? Isn ’ t it those who are part of the community that you should be judging ?
CJB	1%20Corinthians	5	13	God will judge those who are outside . Just expel the evildoer from among yourselves . [ a ] Footnotes -

CJB	1%20Corinthians	6	6	Instead , a brother brings a lawsuit against another brother , and that before unbelievers !
CJB	1%20Corinthians	6	2	Don ’ t you know that God ’ s people are going to judge the universe ? If you are going to judge the universe , are you incompetent to judge these minor matters ?
CJB	1%20Corinthians	6	3	Don ’ t you know that we will judge angels , not to mention affairs of everyday life ?
CJB	1%20Corinthians	6	4	So if you require judgments about matters of everyday life , why do you put them in front of men who have no standing in the Messianic Community ?
CJB	1%20Corinthians	6	5	I say , shame on you ! Can it be that there isn ’ t one person among you wise enough to be able to settle a dispute between brothers ?
CJB	1%20Corinthians	6	7	Actually , if you are bringing lawsuits against each other , it is already a defeat for you . Why not rather be wronged ? Why not rather be cheated ?
CJB	1%20Corinthians	6	8	Instead , you yourselves wrong and cheat ; and you do it to your own brothers !
CJB	1%20Corinthians	6	9	Don ’ t you know that unrighteous people will have no share in the Kingdom of God ? Don ’ t delude yourselves — people who engage in sex before marriage , who worship idols , who engage in sex after marriage with someone other than their spouse , who engage in active or passive homosexuality ,
CJB	1%20Corinthians	6	10	who steal , who are greedy , who get drunk , who assail people with contemptuous language , who rob — none of them will share in the Kingdom of God .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	6	11	Some of you used to do these things . But you have cleansed yourselves , you have been set apart for God , you have come to be counted righteous through the power of the Lord Yeshua the Messiah and the Spirit of our God .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	6	12	You say , “ For me , everything is permitted ” ? Maybe , but not everything is helpful . “ For me , everything is permitted ” ? Maybe , but as far as I am concerned , I am not going to let anything gain control over me .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	6	13	“ Food is meant for the stomach and the stomach for food ” ? Maybe , but God will put an end to both of them . Anyhow , the body is not meant for sexual immorality but for the Lord , and the Lord is for the body .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	6	14	God raised up the Lord , and he will raise us up too by his power .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	6	15	Don ’ t you know that your bodies are parts of the Messiah ? So , am I to take parts of the Messiah and make them parts of a prostitute ? Heaven forbid !
CJB	1%20Corinthians	6	16	Don ’ t you know that a man who joins himself to a prostitute becomes physically one with her ? For the Tanakh says , “ The two will become one flesh ” ; [ a ]
CJB	1%20Corinthians	6	17	but the person who is joined to the Lord is one spirit .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	6	18	Run from sexual immorality ! Every other sin a person commits is outside the body , but the fornicator sins against his own body .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	6	19	Or don ’ t you know that your body is a temple for the Ruach HaKodesh who lives inside you , whom you received from God ? The fact is , you don ’ t belong to yourselves ;

CJB	1%20Corinthians	7	7	Actually , I wish everyone were like me ; but each has his own gift from God , one this , another that .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	7	2	Well , because of the danger of sexual immorality , let each man have his own wife and each woman her own husband .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	7	3	The husband should give his wife what she is entitled to in the marriage relationship , and the wife should do the same for her husband .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	7	4	The wife is not in charge of her own body , but her husband is ; likewise , the husband is not in charge of his own body , but his wife is .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	7	5	Do not deprive each other , except for a limited time , by mutual agreement , and then only so as to have extra time for prayer ; but afterwards , come together again . Otherwise , because of your lack of self-control , you may succumb to the Adversary ’ s temptation .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	7	6	I am giving you this as a suggestion , not as a command .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	7	8	Now to the single people and the widows I say that it is fine if they remain unmarried like me ;
CJB	1%20Corinthians	7	9	but if they can ’ t exercise self-control , they should get married ; because it is better to get married than to keep burning with sexual desire .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	7	10	To those who are married I have a command , and it is not from me but from the Lord : a woman is not to separate herself from her husband
CJB	1%20Corinthians	7	11	But if she does separate herself , she is to remain single or be reconciled with her husband . Also , a husband is not to leave his wife .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	7	12	To the rest I say — I , not the Lord : if any brother has a wife who is not a believer , and she is satisfied to go on living with him , he should not leave her .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	7	13	Also , if any woman has an unbelieving husband who is satisfied to go on living with her , she is not to leave him .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	7	14	For the unbelieving husband has been set aside for God by the wife , and the unbelieving wife has been set aside for God by the brother — otherwise your children would be “ unclean , ” but as it is , they are set aside for God .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	7	15	But if the unbelieving spouse separates himself , let him be separated . In circumstances like these , the brother or sister is not enslaved — God has called you to a life of peace .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	7	16	For how do you know , wife , whether you will save your husband ? Or how do you know , husband , whether you will save your wife ?
CJB	1%20Corinthians	7	17	Only let each person live the life the Lord has assigned him and live it in the condition he was in when God called him . This is the rule I lay down in all the congregations .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	7	18	Was someone already circumcised when he was called ? Then he should not try to remove the marks of his circumcision . Was someone uncircumcised when he was called ? He shouldn ’ t undergo b ’ rit-milah .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	7	19	Being circumcised means nothing , and being uncircumcised means nothing ; what does mean something is keeping God ’ s commandments .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	7	20	Each person should remain in the condition he was in when he was called .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	7	21	Were you a slave when you were called ? Well , don ’ t let it bother you ; although if you can gain your freedom , take advantage of the opportunity .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	7	22	For a person who was a slave when he was called is the Lord ’ s freedman ; likewise , someone who was a free man when he was called is a slave of the Messiah .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	7	23	You were bought at a price , so do not become slaves of other human beings .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	7	24	Brothers , let each one remain with God in the condition in which he was called .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	7	25	Now the question about the unmarried : I do not have a command from the Lord , but I offer an opinion as one who by the Lord ’ s mercy is worthy to be trusted .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	7	26	I suppose that in a time of stress like the present it is good for a person to stay as he is .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	7	27	That means that if a man has a wife , he should not seek to be free of her ; and if he is unmarried , he should not look for a wife .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	7	28	But if you marry you do not sin , and if a girl marries she does not sin . It is just that those who get married will have the normal problems of married life , and I would rather spare you .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	7	29	What I am saying , brothers , is that there is not much time left : from now on a man with a wife should live as if he had none —
CJB	1%20Corinthians	7	30	and those who are sad should live as if they weren ’ t , those who are happy as if they weren ’ t ,
CJB	1%20Corinthians	7	31	and those who deal in worldly affairs as if not engrossed in them — because the present scheme of things in this world won ’ t last much longer .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	7	32	What I want is for you to be free of concern . An unmarried man concerns himself with the Lord ’ s affairs ,
CJB	1%20Corinthians	7	33	with how to please the Lord ; but the married man concerns himself with the world ’ s affairs , with how to please his wife ;
CJB	1%20Corinthians	7	34	and he finds himself split . Likewise the woman who is no longer married or the girl who has never been married concerns herself with the Lord ’ s affairs , with how to be holy both physically and spiritually ; but the married woman concerns herself with the world ’ s affairs , with how to please her husband .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	7	35	I am telling you this for your own benefit , not to put restrictions on you — I am simply concerned that you live in a proper manner and serve the Lord with undivided devotion .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	7	36	Now if a man thinks he is behaving dishonorably by treating his fiancée this way , and if there is strong sexual desire , so that marriage is what ought to happen ; then let him do what he wants — he is not sinning : let them get married .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	7	37	But if a man has firmly made up his mind , being under no compulsion but having complete control over his will , if he has decided within himself to keep his fiancée a virgin , he will be doing well .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	7	38	So the man who marries his fiancée will do well , and the man who doesn ’ t marry will do better .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	7	39	A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives , but if the husband dies she is free to marry anyone she wishes , provided he is a believer in the Lord .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	7	40	However , in my opinion , she will be happier if she remains unmarried , and in saying this I think I have God ’ s Spirit .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	8	1	Corinthians
CJB	1%20Corinthians	8	8	Now food will not improve our relationship with God — we will be neither poorer if we abstain nor richer if we eat .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	8	2	The person who thinks he “ knows ” something doesn ’ t yet know in the way he ought to know .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	8	3	However , if someone loves God , God knows him .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	8	4	So , as for eating food sacrificed to idols , we “ know ” that , as you say , “ An idol has no real existence in the world , and there is only one God. ”
CJB	1%20Corinthians	8	5	For even if there are so-called “ gods , ” either in heaven or on earth — as in fact there are “ gods ” and “ lords ” galore —
CJB	1%20Corinthians	8	6	yet for us there is one God , the Father , from whom all things come and for whom we exist ; and one Lord , Yeshua the Messiah , through whom were created all things and through whom we have our being .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	8	7	But not everyone has this knowledge . Moreover , some people are still so accustomed to idols that when they eat food which has been sacrificed to them , they think of it as really affected by the idol ; and their consciences , being weak , are thus defiled .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	8	9	However watch out that your mastery of the situation does not become a stumbling block to the weak .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	8	10	You have this “ knowledge ” ; but suppose someone with a weak conscience sees you sitting , eating a meal in the temple of an idol . Won ’ t he be built up wrongly to eat this food which has been sacrificed to idols ?
CJB	1%20Corinthians	8	11	Thus by your “ knowledge ” this weak person is destroyed , this brother for whom the Messiah died ;
CJB	1%20Corinthians	8	12	and so , when you sin against the brothers by wounding their conscience when it is weak , you are sinning against the Messiah !
CJB	1%20Corinthians	8	13	To sum up , if food will be a snare for my brother , I will never eat meat again , lest I cause my brother to sin .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	9	1	Corinthians 9:9 Deuteronomy 25:4
CJB	1%20Corinthians	9	9	for in the Torah of Moshe it is written , “ You are not to put a muzzle on an ox when it is treading out the grain. ” [ a ] If God is concerned about cattle ,
CJB	1%20Corinthians	9	2	Even if to others I am not an emissary , at least I am to you ; for you are living proof that I am the Lord ’ s emissary .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	9	3	That is my defense when people put me under examination .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	9	4	Don ’ t we have the right to be given food and drink ?
CJB	1%20Corinthians	9	5	Don ’ t we have the right to take along with us a believing wife , as do the other emissaries , also the Lord ’ s brothers and Kefa ?
CJB	1%20Corinthians	9	6	Or are Bar-Nabba and I the only ones required to go on working for our living ?
CJB	1%20Corinthians	9	7	Did you ever hear of a soldier paying his own expenses ? or of a farmer planting a vineyard without eating its grapes ? Who shepherds a flock without drinking some of the milk ?
CJB	1%20Corinthians	9	8	What I am saying is not based merely on human authority , because the Torah says the same thing —
CJB	1%20Corinthians	9	10	all the more does he say this for our sakes . Yes , it was written for us , meaning that he who plows and he who threshes should work expecting to get a share of the crop .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	9	11	If we have sown spiritual seed among you , is it too much if we reap a material harvest from you ?
CJB	1%20Corinthians	9	12	If others are sharing in this right to be supported by you , don ’ t we have a greater claim to it ? But we don ’ t make use of this right . Rather , we put up with all kinds of things so as not to impede in any way the Good News about the Messiah .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	9	13	Don ’ t you know that those who work in the Temple get their food from the Temple , and those who serve at the altar get a share of the sacrifices offered there ?
CJB	1%20Corinthians	9	14	In the same way , the Lord directed that those who proclaim the Good News should get their living from the Good News .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	9	15	But I have not made use of any of these rights . Nor am I writing now to secure them for myself , for I would rather die than be deprived of my ground for boasting !
CJB	1%20Corinthians	9	16	For I can ’ t boast merely because I proclaim the Good News — this I do from inner compulsion : woe is me if I don ’ t proclaim the Good News !
CJB	1%20Corinthians	9	17	For if I do this willingly , I have a reward ; but if I do it unwillingly , I still do it , simply because I ’ ve been entrusted with a job .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	9	18	So then , what is my reward ? Just this : that in proclaiming the Good News I can make it available free of charge , without making use of the rights to which it entitles me .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	9	19	For although I am a free man , not bound to do anyone ’ s bidding , I have made myself a slave to all in order to win as many people as possible .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	9	20	That is , with Jews , what I did was put myself in the position of a Jew , in order to win Jews . With people in subjection to a legalistic perversion of the Torah , I put myself in the position of someone under such legalism , in order to win those under this legalism , even though I myself am not in subjection to a legalistic perversion of the Torah .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	9	21	With those who live outside the framework of Torah , I put myself in the position of someone outside the Torah in order to win those outside the Torah — although I myself am not outside the framework of God ’ s Torah but within the framework of Torah as upheld by the Messiah .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	9	22	With the “ weak ” I became “ weak , ” in order to win the “ weak. ” With all kinds of people I have become all kinds of things , so that in all kinds of circumstances I might save at least some of them .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	9	23	But I do it all because of the rewards promised by the Good News , so that I may share in them along with the others who come to trust .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	9	24	Don ’ t you know that in a race all the runners compete , but only one wins the prize ? So then , run to win !
CJB	1%20Corinthians	9	25	Now every athlete in training submits himself to strict discipline , and he does it just to win a laurel wreath that will soon wither away . But we do it to win a crown that will last forever .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	9	26	Accordingly , I don ’ t run aimlessly but straight for the finish line ; I don ’ t shadow-box but try to make every punch count .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	9	27	I treat my body hard and make it my slave so that , after proclaiming the Good News to others , I myself will not be disqualified . Footnotes -

CJB	1%20Corinthians	10	3	also they all ate the same food from the Spirit ,
CJB	1%20Corinthians	10	4	and they all drank the same drink from the Spirit — for they drank from a Spirit-sent Rock which followed them , and that Rock was the Messiah .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	10	5	Yet with the majority of them God was not pleased , so their bodies were strewn across the desert .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	10	6	Now these things took place as prefigurative historical events , warning us not to set our hearts on evil things as they did .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	10	7	Don ’ t be idolaters , as some of them were — as the Tanakh puts it , “ The people sat down to eat and drink , then got up to indulge in revelry. ” [ a ]
CJB	1%20Corinthians	10	8	And let us not engage in sexual immorality , as some of them did , with the consequence that 23,000 died in a single day .

CJB	1%20Corinthians	10	12	Therefore , let anyone who thinks he is standing up be careful not to fall !
CJB	1%20Corinthians	10	13	No temptation has seized you beyond what people normally experience , and God can be trusted not to allow you to be tempted beyond what you can bear . On the contrary , along with the temptation he will also provide the way out , so that you will be able to endure .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	10	14	Therefore , my dear friends , run from idolatry !
CJB	1%20Corinthians	10	15	I speak to you as sensible people ; judge for yourselves what I am saying .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	10	16	The “ cup of blessing ” over which we make the b ’ rakhah — isn ’ t it a sharing in the bloody sacrificial death of the Messiah ? The bread we break , isn ’ t it a sharing in the body of the Messiah ?
CJB	1%20Corinthians	10	17	Because there is one loaf of bread , we who are many constitute one body , since we all partake of the one loaf of bread .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	10	18	Look at physical Isra ’ el : don ’ t those who eat the sacrifices participate in the altar ?
CJB	1%20Corinthians	10	19	So , what am I saying ? That food sacrificed to idols has any significance in itself ? or that an idol has significance in itself ?
CJB	1%20Corinthians	10	20	No , what I am saying is that the things which pagans sacrifice , they sacrifice not to God but to demons ; and I don ’ t want you to become sharers of the demons !
CJB	1%20Corinthians	10	21	You can ’ t drink both a cup of the Lord and a cup of demons , you can ’ t partake in both a meal of the Lord and a meal of demons .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	10	22	Or are we trying to make the Lord jealous ? We aren ’ t stronger than he is , are we ?
CJB	1%20Corinthians	10	23	“ Everything is permitted , ” you say ? Maybe , but not everything is helpful . “ Everything is permitted ? ” Maybe , but not everything is edifying .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	10	24	No one should be looking out for his own interests , but for those of his fellow .

CJB	1%20Corinthians	10	28	But if someone says to you , “ This meat was offered as a sacrifice , ” then don ’ t eat it , out of consideration for the person who pointed it out and also for conscience ’ s sake —

CJB	1%20Corinthians	11	1	Corinthians
CJB	1%20Corinthians	11	11	Nevertheless , in union with the Lord neither is woman independent of man nor is man independent of woman ;
CJB	1%20Corinthians	11	2	Now I praise you because you have remembered everything I told you and observe the traditions just the way I passed them on to you .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	11	3	But I want you to understand that the head of every man is the Messiah , and the head of a wife is her husband , and the head of the Messiah is God .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	11	4	Every man who prays or prophesies wearing something down over his head brings shame to his head ,
CJB	1%20Corinthians	11	5	but every woman who prays or prophesies with her head unveiled brings shame to her head — there is no difference between her and a woman who has had her head shaved .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	11	6	For if a woman is not veiled , let her also have her hair cut short ; but if it is shameful for a woman to wear her hair cut short or to have her head shaved , then let her be veiled .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	11	7	For a man indeed should not have his head veiled , because he is the image and glory of God , and the woman is the glory of man .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	11	8	For man was not made from woman , but woman from man ;
CJB	1%20Corinthians	11	9	and indeed man was not created for the sake of the woman but woman for the sake of the man .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	11	10	The reason a woman should show by veiling her head that she is under authority has to do with the angels .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	11	12	for as the woman was made from the man , so also the man is now born through the woman . But everything is from God .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	11	13	Decide for yourselves : is it appropriate for a woman to pray to God when she is unveiled ?
CJB	1%20Corinthians	11	14	Doesn ’ t the nature of things itself teach you that a man who wears his hair long degrades himself ?
CJB	1%20Corinthians	11	15	But a woman who wears her hair long enhances her appearance , because her hair has been given to her as a covering .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	11	16	However , if anyone wants to argue about it , the fact remains that we have no such custom , nor do the Messianic communities of God .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	11	17	But in giving you this next instruction I do not praise you , because when you meet together it does more harm than good !
CJB	1%20Corinthians	11	18	For , in the first place , I hear that when you gather together as a congregation you divide up into cliques ; and to a degree I believe it
CJB	1%20Corinthians	11	19	( granted that there must be some divisions among you in order to show who are the ones in the right ) .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	11	20	Thus , when you gather together , it is not to eat a meal of the Lord ;
CJB	1%20Corinthians	11	21	because as you eat your meal , each one goes ahead on his own ; so that one stays hungry while another is already drunk !
CJB	1%20Corinthians	11	22	Don ’ t you have homes to eat and drink in ? Or are you trying to show your contempt for God ’ s Messianic community and embarrass those who are poor ? What am I supposed to say to you ? Am I supposed to praise you ? Well , for this I don ’ t praise you !
CJB	1%20Corinthians	11	23	For what I received from the Lord is just what I passed on to you — that the Lord Yeshua , on the night he was betrayed , took bread ;
CJB	1%20Corinthians	11	24	and after he had made the b ’ rakhah he broke it and said , “ This is my body , which is for you . Do this as a memorial to me ” ;
CJB	1%20Corinthians	11	25	likewise also the cup after the meal , saying , “ This cup is the New Covenant effected by my blood ; do this , as often as you drink it , as a memorial to me. ”
CJB	1%20Corinthians	11	26	For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup , you proclaim the death of the Lord , until he comes .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	11	27	Therefore , whoever eats the Lord ’ s bread or drinks the Lord ’ s cup in an unworthy manner will be guilty of desecrating the body and blood of the Lord !
CJB	1%20Corinthians	11	28	So let a person examine himself first , and then he may eat of the bread and drink from the cup ;
CJB	1%20Corinthians	11	29	for a person who eats and drinks without recognizing the body eats and drinks judgment upon himself .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	11	30	This is why many among you are weak and sick , and some have died !
CJB	1%20Corinthians	11	31	If we would examine ourselves , we would not come under judgment .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	11	32	But when we are judged by the Lord , we are being disciplined , so that we will not be condemned along with the world .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	11	33	So then , my brothers , when you gather together to eat , wait for one another .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	11	34	If someone is hungry , he should eat at home , so that when you meet together it will not result in judgment . As for the other matters , I will instruct you about them when I come .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	12	1	Corinthians
CJB	1%20Corinthians	12	12	For just as the body is one but has many parts ; and all the parts of the body , though many , constitute one body ; so it is with the Messiah .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	12	2	You know that when you were pagans , no matter how you felt you were being led , you were being led astray to idols , which can ’ t speak at all .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	12	3	Therefore , I want to make it clear to you that no one speaking by the Spirit of God ever says , “ Yeshua is cursed ! ” and no one can say , “ Yeshua is Lord , ” except by the Ruach HaKodesh .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	12	4	Now there are different kinds of gifts , but the same Spirit gives them .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	12	5	Also there are different ways of serving , but it is the same Lord being served .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	12	6	And there are different modes of working , but it is the same God working them all in everyone .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	12	7	Moreover , to each person is given the particular manifestation of the Spirit that will be for the common good .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	12	8	To one , through the Spirit , is given a word of wisdom ; to another , a word of knowledge , in accordance with the same Spirit ;
CJB	1%20Corinthians	12	9	to another , faith , by the same Spirit ; and to another , gifts of healing , by the one Spirit ;
CJB	1%20Corinthians	12	10	to another , the working of miracles ; to another , prophecy ; to another , the ability to judge between spirits ; to another , the ability to speak in different kinds of tongues ; and to yet another , the ability to interpret tongues .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	12	11	One and the same Spirit is at work in all these things , distributing to each person as he chooses .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	12	13	For it was by one Spirit that we were all immersed into one body , whether Jews or Gentiles , slaves or free ; and we were all given the one Spirit to drink .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	12	14	For indeed the body is not one part but many .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	12	15	If the foot says , “ I ’ m not a hand , so I ’ m not part of the body , ” that doesn ’ t make it stop being part of the body .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	12	16	And if the ear says , “ I ’ m not an eye , so I ’ m not part of the body , ” that doesn ’ t make it stop being part of the body .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	12	17	If the whole body were an eye , how could it hear ? If it were all hearing , how could it smell ?
CJB	1%20Corinthians	12	18	But as it is , God arranged each of the parts in the body exactly as he wanted them .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	12	19	Now if they were all just one part , where would the body be ?
CJB	1%20Corinthians	12	20	But as it is , there are indeed many parts , yet just one body .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	12	21	So the eye can not say to the hand , “ I don ’ t need you ” ; or the head to the feet , “ I don ’ t need you. ”
CJB	1%20Corinthians	12	22	On the contrary , the parts of the body that seem to be less important turn out to be all the more necessary ;
CJB	1%20Corinthians	12	23	and upon body parts which we consider less dignified we bestow greater dignity ; and the parts that aren ’ t attractive are the ones we make as attractive as we can ,
CJB	1%20Corinthians	12	24	while our attractive parts have no need for such treatment . Indeed , God has put the body together in such a way that he gives greater dignity to the parts that lack it ,
CJB	1%20Corinthians	12	25	So that there will be no disagreements within the body , but rather all the parts will be equally concerned for all the others .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	12	26	Thus if one part suffers , all the parts suffer with it ; and if one part is honored , all the parts share its happiness .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	12	27	Now you together constitute the body of the Messiah , and individually you are parts of it .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	12	28	And God has placed in the Messianic Community first , emissaries ; second , prophets ; third , teachers ; then those who work miracles ; then those with gifts of healing ; those with ability to help ; those skilled in administration ; and those who speak in various tongues .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	12	29	Not all are emissaries , are they ? Not all are prophets , are they ? or teachers ? or miracle-workers ?
CJB	1%20Corinthians	12	30	Not all have gifts of healing , not all speak in tongues , not all interpret , do they ?
CJB	1%20Corinthians	12	31	Eagerly seek the better gifts . But now I will show you the best way of all .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	13	1	Corinthians
CJB	1%20Corinthians	13	13	But for now , three things last — trust , hope , love ; and the greatest of these is love .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	13	2	I may have the gift of prophecy , I may fathom all mysteries , know all things , have all faith — enough to move mountains ; but if I lack love , I am nothing .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	13	3	I may give away everything that I own , I may even hand over my body to be burned ; but if I lack love , I gain nothing .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	13	4	Love is patient and kind , not jealous , not boastful ,
CJB	1%20Corinthians	13	5	not proud , rude or selfish , not easily angered , and it keeps no record of wrongs .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	13	6	Love does not gloat over other people ’ s sins but takes its delight in the truth .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	13	7	Love always bears up , always trusts , always hopes , always endures .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	13	8	Love never ends ; but prophecies will pass , tongues will cease , knowledge will pass .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	13	9	For our knowledge is partial , and our prophecy partial ;
CJB	1%20Corinthians	13	10	but when the perfect comes , the partial will pass .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	13	11	When I was a child , I spoke like a child , thought like a child , argued like a child ; now that I have become a man , I have finished with childish ways .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	13	12	For now we see obscurely in a mirror , but then it will be face to face . Now I know partly ; then I will know fully , just as God has fully known me .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	14	1	Corinthians 14:21 Isaiah 28:11–12
CJB	1%20Corinthians	14	14	For if I pray in a tongue , my spirit does pray , but my mind is unproductive .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	14	2	For someone speaking in a tongue is not speaking to people but to God , because no one can understand , since he is uttering mysteries in the power of the Spirit .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	14	3	But someone prophesying is speaking to people , edifying , encouraging and comforting them .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	14	4	A person speaking in a tongue does edify himself , but a person prophesying edifies the congregation .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	14	5	I wish you would all speak in tongues , but even more I wish you would all prophesy . The person who prophesies is greater than the person who speaks in tongues , unless someone gives an interpretation , so that the congregation can be edified .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	14	6	Brothers , suppose I come to you now speaking in tongues . How can I be of benefit to you unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or teaching ?
CJB	1%20Corinthians	14	7	Even with lifeless musical instruments , such as a flute or a harp , how will anyone recognize the melody if one note can ’ t be distinguished from another ?
CJB	1%20Corinthians	14	8	And if the bugle gives an unclear sound , who will get ready for battle ?
CJB	1%20Corinthians	14	9	It ’ s the same with you : how will anyone know what you are saying unless you use your tongue to produce intelligible speech ? You will be talking to the air !
CJB	1%20Corinthians	14	10	There are undoubtedly all kinds of sounds in the world , and none is altogether meaningless ;
CJB	1%20Corinthians	14	11	but if I don ’ t know what a person ’ s sounds mean , I will be a foreigner to the speaker and the speaker will be a foreigner to me .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	14	12	Likewise with you : since you eagerly seek the things of the Spirit , seek especially what will help in edifying the congregation .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	14	13	Therefore someone who speaks in a tongue should pray for the power to interpret .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	14	15	So , what about it ? I will pray with my spirit , but I will also pray with my mind ; I will sing with my spirit , but I will also sing with my mind .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	14	16	Otherwise , if you are giving thanks with your spirit , how will someone who has not yet received much instruction be able to say , “ Amen , ” when you have finished giving thanks , since he doesn ’ t know what you are saying ?
CJB	1%20Corinthians	14	17	For undoubtedly you are giving thanks very nicely , but the other person is not being edified .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	14	18	I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you ,
CJB	1%20Corinthians	14	19	but in a congregation meeting I would rather say five words with my mind in order to instruct others than ten thousand words in a tongue !
CJB	1%20Corinthians	14	20	Brothers , don ’ t be children in your thinking . In evil , be like infants ; but in your thinking , be grown-up .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	14	21	In the Torah it is written , “ By other tongues , by the lips of foreigners I will speak to this people . But even then they will not listen to me , ” says Adonai . [ a ]
CJB	1%20Corinthians	14	22	Thus tongues are a sign not for believers but for unbelievers , while prophecy is not for unbelievers but for believers .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	14	23	So if the whole congregation comes together with everybody speaking in tongues , and uninstructed people or unbelievers come in , won ’ t they say you ’ re crazy ?
CJB	1%20Corinthians	14	24	But if you all prophesy , and some unbeliever or uninstructed person enters , he is convicted of sin by all , he is brought under judgment by all ,
CJB	1%20Corinthians	14	25	and the secrets of his heart are laid bare ; so he falls on his face and worships God , saying , “ God is really here among you ! ”
CJB	1%20Corinthians	14	26	What is our conclusion , brothers ? Whenever you come together , let everyone be ready with a psalm or a teaching or a revelation , or ready to use his gift of tongues or give an interpretation ; but let everything be for edification .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	14	27	If the gift of tongues is exercised , let it be by two or at most three , and each in turn ; and let someone interpret .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	14	28	And if there is no one present who can interpret , let the people who speak in tongues keep silent when the congregation meets — they can speak to themselves and to God .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	14	29	Let two or three prophets speak , while the others weigh what is said .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	14	30	And if something is revealed to a prophet who is sitting down , let the first one be silent .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	14	31	For you can all prophesy one by one , with the result that all will learn something and all will be encouraged .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	14	32	Also , the prophets ’ spirits are under the prophets ’ control ;
CJB	1%20Corinthians	14	33	for God is not a God of unruliness but of shalom . As in all the congregations of God ’ s people ,
CJB	1%20Corinthians	14	34	let the wives remain silent when the congregation meets ; they are certainly not permitted to speak out . Rather , let them remain subordinate , as also the Torah says ;
CJB	1%20Corinthians	14	35	and if there is something they want to know , let them ask their own husbands at home ; for it is shameful for a woman to speak out in a congregational meeting .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	14	36	Did the word of God originate with you ? Or are you the only people it has reached ?
CJB	1%20Corinthians	14	37	If anyone thinks he is a prophet or is endowed with the Spirit , let him acknowledge that what I am writing you is a command of the Lord .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	14	38	But if someone doesn ’ t recognize this , then let him remain unrecognized .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	14	39	So , my brothers , eagerly seek to prophesy ; and do not forbid speaking in tongues ;
CJB	1%20Corinthians	14	40	but let all things be done in a proper and orderly way . Footnotes -
CJB	1%20Corinthians	15	1	Corinthians 15:55 Hosea 13:14
CJB	1%20Corinthians	15	15	furthermore , we are shown up as false witnesses for God in having testified that God raised up the Messiah , whom he did not raise if it is true that the dead are not raised .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	15	2	and by which you are being saved — provided you keep holding fast to the message I proclaimed to you . For if you don ’ t , your trust will have been in vain .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	15	3	For among the first things I passed on to you was what I also received , namely this : the Messiah died for our sins , in accordance with what the Tanakh says ;
CJB	1%20Corinthians	15	4	and he was buried ; and he was raised on the third day , in accordance with what the Tanakh says ;
CJB	1%20Corinthians	15	5	and he was seen by Kefa , then by the Twelve ;
CJB	1%20Corinthians	15	6	) -
CJB	1%20Corinthians	15	7	Later he was seen by Ya ‘ akov , then by all the emissaries ;
CJB	1%20Corinthians	15	8	and last of all he was seen by me , even though I was born at the wrong time .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	15	9	For I am the least of all the emissaries , unfit to be called an emissary , because I persecuted the Messianic Community of God .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	15	10	But by God ’ s grace I am what I am , and his grace towards me was not in vain ; on the contrary , I have worked harder than all of them , although it was not I but the grace of God with me .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	15	11	Anyhow , whether I or they , this is what we proclaim , and this is what you believed .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	15	12	But if it has been proclaimed that the Messiah has been raised from the dead , how is it that some of you are saying there is no such thing as a resurrection of the dead ?
CJB	1%20Corinthians	15	13	If there is no resurrection of the dead , then the Messiah has not been raised ;
CJB	1%20Corinthians	15	14	and if the Messiah has not been raised , then what we have proclaimed is in vain ; also your trust is in vain ;
CJB	1%20Corinthians	15	16	For if the dead are not raised , then the Messiah has not been raised either ;
CJB	1%20Corinthians	15	17	and if the Messiah has not been raised , your trust is useless , and you are still in your sins .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	15	18	Also , if this is the case , those who died in union with the Messiah are lost .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	15	19	If it is only for this life that we have put our hope in the Messiah , we are more pitiable than anyone .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	15	20	But the fact is that the Messiah has been raised from the dead , the firstfruits of those who have died .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	15	21	For since death came through a man , also the resurrection of the dead has come through a man .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	15	22	For just as in connection with Adam all die , so in connection with the Messiah all will be made alive .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	15	23	But each in his own order : the Messiah is the firstfruits ; then those who belong to the Messiah , at the time of his coming ;
CJB	1%20Corinthians	15	24	then the culmination , when he hands over the Kingdom to God the Father , after having put an end to every rulership , yes , to every authority and power .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	15	25	For he has to rule until he puts all his enemies under his feet .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	15	26	The last enemy to be done away with will be death ,
CJB	1%20Corinthians	15	27	for “ He put everything in subjection under his feet. ” [ a ] But when it says that “ everything ” has been subjected , obviously the word does not include God , who is himself the one subjecting everything to the Messiah .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	15	28	Now when everything has been subjected to the Son , then he will subject himself to God , who subjected everything to him ; so that God may be everything in everyone .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	15	29	Were it otherwise , what would the people accomplish who are immersed on behalf of the dead ? If the dead are not actually raised , why are people immersed for them ?
CJB	1%20Corinthians	15	30	For that matter , we ourselves — why do we keep facing danger hour by hour ?
CJB	1%20Corinthians	15	31	Brothers , by the right to be proud which the Messiah Yeshua our Lord gives me , I solemnly tell you that I die every day .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	15	32	If my fighting with “ wild beasts ” in Ephesus was done merely on a human basis , what do I gain by it ? If dead people are not raised , we might as well live by the saying , “ Let ’ s eat and drink , for tomorrow we die ! ” [ b ]
CJB	1%20Corinthians	15	33	Don ’ t be fooled . “ Bad company ruins good character. ”
CJB	1%20Corinthians	15	34	Come to your senses ! Live righteously and stop sinning ! There are some people who lack knowledge of God — I say this to your shame .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	15	35	But someone will ask , “ In what manner are the dead raised ? What sort of body do they have ? ”
CJB	1%20Corinthians	15	36	Stupid ! When you sow a seed , it doesn ’ t come alive unless it first dies .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	15	37	Also , what you sow is not the body that will be , but a bare seed of , say , wheat or something else ;
CJB	1%20Corinthians	15	38	but God gives it the body he intended for it ; and to each kind of seed he gives its own body .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	15	39	Not all living matter is the same living matter ; on the contrary , there is one kind for human beings , another kind of living matter for animals , another for birds and another for fish .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	15	40	Further , there are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies ; but the beauty of heavenly bodies is one thing , while the beauty of earthly bodies is something else .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	15	41	The sun has one kind of beauty , the moon another , the stars yet another ; indeed , each star has its own individual kind of beauty .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	15	42	So it is with the resurrection of the dead . When the body is “ sown , ” it decays ; when it is raised , it can not decay .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	15	43	When sown , it is without dignity ; when raised , it will be beautiful . When sown , it is weak ; when raised , it will be strong .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	15	44	When sown , it is an ordinary human body ; when raised , it will be a body controlled by the Spirit . If there is an ordinary human body , there is also a body controlled by the Spirit .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	15	45	In fact , the Tanakh says so : Adam , the first man , became a living human being ; [ c ] but the last “ Adam ” has become a life-giving Spirit .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	15	46	Note , however , that the body from the Spirit did not come first , but the ordinary human one ; the one from the Spirit comes afterwards .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	15	47	The first man is from the earth , made of dust ; the second man is from heaven .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	15	48	People born of dust are like the man of dust , and people born from heaven are like the man from heaven ;
CJB	1%20Corinthians	15	49	and just as we have borne the image of the man of dust , so also we will bear the image of the man from heaven .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	15	50	Let me say this , brothers : flesh and blood can not share in the Kingdom of God , nor can something that decays share in what does not decay .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	15	51	Look , I will tell you a secret — not all of us will die ! But we will all be changed !
CJB	1%20Corinthians	15	52	It will take but a moment , the blink of an eye , at the final shofar . For the shofar will sound , and the dead will be raised to live forever , and we too will be changed .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	15	53	For this material which can decay must be clothed with imperishability , this which is mortal must be clothed with immortality .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	15	54	When what decays puts on imperishability and what is mortal puts on immortality , then this passage in the Tanakh will be fulfilled : “ Death is swallowed up in victory . [ d ]
CJB	1%20Corinthians	15	55	“ Death , where is your victory ? Death , where is your sting ? ” [ e ]
CJB	1%20Corinthians	15	56	The sting of death is sin ; and sin draws its power from the Torah ;
CJB	1%20Corinthians	15	57	but thanks be to God , who gives us the victory through our Lord Yeshua the Messiah !
CJB	1%20Corinthians	15	58	So , my dear brothers , stand firm and immovable , always doing the Lord ’ s work as vigorously as you can , knowing that united with the Lord your efforts are not in vain . Footnotes -
CJB	1%20Corinthians	16	1	Corinthians
CJB	1%20Corinthians	16	16	I urge you to submit yourselves to people like these and to everyone who works and toils with them .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	16	2	Every week , on Motza ’ ei-Shabbat , each of you should set some money aside , according to his resources , and save it up ; so that when I come I won ’ t have to do fundraising .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	16	3	And when I arrive , I will give letters of introduction to the people you have approved , and I will send them to carry your gift to Yerushalayim .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	16	4	If it seems appropriate that I go too , they will go along with me .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	16	5	I will visit you after I have gone through Macedonia , for I am intending to pass through Macedonia ,
CJB	1%20Corinthians	16	6	and I may stay with you or even spend the winter , so that you may help me continue my travels wherever I may go .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	16	7	For I don ’ t want to see you now , when I am only passing through ; because I am hoping to spend some time with you , if the Lord allows it .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	16	8	But I will remain in Ephesus until Shavu ‘ ot ,
CJB	1%20Corinthians	16	9	because a great and important door has opened for my work , and there are many people opposing me .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	16	10	If Timothy comes , see that he has nothing to be afraid of while he is with you ; for he is doing the Lord ’ s work , just as I am .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	16	11	So let no one treat him with disrespect . Help him on his way in peace , so that he will return to me , for the brothers and I are expecting him .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	16	12	As for brother Apollos , I strongly urged him to go and visit you along with the other brothers ; and although it was not at all his desire to come at this time , he will come when he has the opportunity .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	16	13	Stay alert , stand firm in the faith , behave like a mentsh , grow strong .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	16	14	Let everything you do be done in love .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	16	15	Now , brothers , you know that the household of Stephanas were the first people in Achaia to put their trust in the Messiah , and they have devoted themselves to serving God ’ s people .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	16	17	I am glad that Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus are here , because they have helped make up for your not being here .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	16	18	They have refreshed my spirit , just as they have yours . I want you to show appreciation for people like these .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	16	19	The congregations in the province of Asia send greetings to you . Aquila and Priscilla greet you in union with the Lord , as does the congregation that meets in their house .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	16	20	All the brothers send you their greetings . Greet one another with a holy kiss .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	16	21	Now , I Sha ’ ul , greet you in my own handwriting .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	16	22	If anyone does not love the Lord , a curse on him ! Marana , ta ! [ Our Lord , come ! ]
CJB	1%20Corinthians	16	23	May the grace of the Lord Yeshua be with you .
CJB	1%20Corinthians	16	24	My love is with you all , in union with the Messiah Yeshua .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	1	2	Grace to you and shalom from God our Father and the Lord Yeshua the Messiah .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	1	1	From : Sha ’ ul , by God ’ s will an emissary of the Messiah Yeshua , and brother Timothy To : God ’ s Messianic community in Corinth , along with all God ’ s people throughout Achaia :
CJB	2%20Corinthians	1	3	Praised be God , Father of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah , compassionate Father , God of all encouragement and comfort ;
CJB	2%20Corinthians	1	4	who encourages us in all our trials , so that we can encourage others in whatever trials they may be undergoing with the encouragement we ourselves have received from God .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	1	5	For just as the Messiah ’ s sufferings overflow into us , so through the Messiah our encouragement also overflows .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	1	6	So if we undergo trials , it is for your encouragement and deliverance ; and if we are encouraged , that should encourage you when you have to endure sufferings like those we are experiencing .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	1	7	Moreover , our hope for you remains staunch , because we know that as you share in the sufferings , you will also share in the encouragement .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	1	8	For , brothers , we want you to know about the trials we have undergone in the province of Asia . The burden laid on us was so far beyond what we could bear that we even despaired of living through it .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	1	9	In our hearts we felt we were under sentence of death . However , this was to get us to rely not on ourselves but on God , who raises the dead !
CJB	2%20Corinthians	1	10	He rescued us from such deadly peril , and he will rescue us again ! The one in whom we have placed our hope will indeed continue to rescue us .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	1	11	And you must add your help by praying for us ; for the more people there are praying , the more people there will be to give thanks when their prayer for us is answered .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	1	12	For we take pride in this : that our conscience assures us that in our dealings with the world , and especially with you , we have conducted ourselves with frankness and godly pureness of motive — not by worldly wisdom but by God-given grace .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	1	13	There are no hidden meanings in our letters other than what you can read and understand ; and my hope is that you will understand fully ,
CJB	2%20Corinthians	1	14	as indeed you have already understood us in part ; so that on the Day of our Lord Yeshua you can be as proud of us as we are of you .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	1	15	So sure was I of this that I had planned to come and see you , so that you might have the benefit of a second visit .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	1	16	I wanted to visit you on my way to Macedonia , visit you again on my way back from Macedonia , and then have you send me on my way to Y ’ hudah .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	1	17	Did I make these plans lightly ? Or do I make plans the way a worldly man does , ready to say , “ Yes , yes , ” and “ No , no , ” in the same breath ?
CJB	2%20Corinthians	1	18	As surely as God is trustworthy , we don ’ t say “ Yes ” when we mean “ No. ”
CJB	2%20Corinthians	1	19	For the Son of God , the Messiah Yeshua , who was proclaimed among you through us — that is , through me and Sila and Timothy — was not a yes-and-no man ; on the contrary , with him it is always “ Yes ! ”
CJB	2%20Corinthians	1	20	For however many promises God has made , they all find their “ Yes ” in connection with him ; that is why it is through him that we say the “ Amen ” when we give glory to God .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	1	21	Moreover , it is God who sets both us and you in firm union with the Messiah ; he has anointed us ,
CJB	2%20Corinthians	1	22	put his seal on us , and given us his Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee for the future .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	1	23	I call God to witness — he knows what my life is like — that the reason I held back from coming to Corinth was out of consideration for you !
CJB	2%20Corinthians	1	24	We are not trying to dictate how you must live out your trust in the Messiah , for in your trust you are standing firm . Rather , we are working with you for your own happiness .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	2	2	For if I cause you pain , who is left to make me happy except the people I have pained ?
CJB	2%20Corinthians	2	3	Indeed , this is why I wrote as I did — so that when I came , I would not have to be pained by those who ought to be making me happy ; for I had enough confidence in all of you to believe that unless I could be happy , none of you could be happy either .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	2	4	I wrote to you with a greatly distressed and anguished heart , and with many tears , not in order to cause you pain , but to get you to realize how very much I love you .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	2	5	Now if someone has been a cause of pain , it is not I whom he has pained , but , in some measure — I don ’ t want to overstate it — all of you .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	2	6	For such a person the punishment already imposed on him by the majority is sufficient ,
CJB	2%20Corinthians	2	7	so that now you should do the opposite — forgive him , encourage him , comfort him . Otherwise such a person might be swallowed up in overwhelming depression .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	2	8	So I urge you to show that you really do love him .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	2	9	The reason I wrote you was to see if you would pass the test , to see if you would fully obey me .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	2	10	Anyone you forgive , I forgive too . For indeed , whatever I have forgiven , if there has been anything to forgive , has been for your sake in the presence of the Messiah
CJB	2%20Corinthians	2	11	so that we will not be taken advantage of by the Adversary — for we are quite aware of his schemes !
CJB	2%20Corinthians	2	12	Now when I went to Troas to proclaim the Good News of the Messiah , since a door had been opened for me by the Lord ,
CJB	2%20Corinthians	2	13	I could not rest , because I failed to find my brother Titus . So I left the people there and went on to Macedonia .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	2	14	But thanks be to God , who in the Messiah constantly leads us in a triumphal procession and through us spreads everywhere the fragrance of what it means to know him !
CJB	2%20Corinthians	2	15	For to God we are the aroma of the Messiah , both among those being saved and among those being lost ;
CJB	2%20Corinthians	2	16	to the latter , we are the smell of death leading only to more death ; but to the former , we are the sweet smell of life leading to more life . Who is equal to such a task ?
CJB	2%20Corinthians	2	17	For we are not like a lot of folks who go about huckstering God ’ s message for a fee ; on the contrary , we speak out of a sincere heart , as people sent by God , standing in God ’ s presence , living in union with the Messiah .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	3	2	Corinthians 3:16 Exodus 34:34
CJB	2%20Corinthians	3	3	You make it clear that you are a letter from the Messiah placed in our care , written not with ink but by the Spirit of the living God , not on stone tablets but on human hearts .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	3	4	Such is the confidence we have through the Messiah toward God .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	3	5	It is not that we are competent in ourselves to count anything as having come from us ; on the contrary , our competence is from God .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	3	6	He has even made us competent to be workers serving a New Covenant , the essence of which is not a written text but the Spirit . For the written text brings death , but the Spirit gives life .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	3	7	Now if that which worked death , by means of a written text engraved on stone tablets , came with glory — such glory that the people of Isra ’ el could not stand to look at Moshe ’ s face because of its brightness , even though that brightness was already fading away —
CJB	2%20Corinthians	3	8	won ’ t the working of the Spirit be accompanied by even greater glory ?
CJB	2%20Corinthians	3	9	For if there was glory in what worked to declare people guilty , how much more must the glory abound in what works to declare people innocent !
CJB	2%20Corinthians	3	10	In fact , by comparison with this greater glory , what was made glorious before has no glory now .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	3	11	For if there was glory in what faded away , how much more glory must there be in what lasts .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	3	12	Therefore , with a hope like this , we are very open —
CJB	2%20Corinthians	3	13	unlike Moshe , who put a veil over his face , so that the people of Isra ’ el would not see the fading brightness come to an end .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	3	14	What is more , their minds were made stonelike ; for to this day the same veil remains over them when they read the Old Covenant ; it has not been unveiled , because only by the Messiah is the veil taken away .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	3	15	Yes , till today , whenever Moshe is read , a veil lies over their heart .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	3	16	“ But , ” says the Torah , “ whenever someone turns to Adonai , the veil is taken away. ” [ a ]
CJB	2%20Corinthians	3	17	Now , “ Adonai ” in this text means the Spirit . And where the Spirit of Adonai is , there is freedom .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	3	18	So all of us , with faces unveiled , see as in a mirror the glory of the Lord ; and we are being changed into his very image , from one degree of glory to the next , by Adonai the Spirit . Footnotes -
CJB	2%20Corinthians	4	2	Corinthians 4:13 Psalm 116:10
CJB	2%20Corinthians	4	4	They do not come to trust because the god of the ‘ olam hazeh has blinded their minds , in order to prevent them from seeing the light shining from the Good News about the glory of the Messiah , who is the image of God .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	4	3	So if indeed our Good News is veiled , it is veiled only to those in the process of being lost .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	4	5	For what we are proclaiming is not ourselves , but the Messiah Yeshua as Lord , with ourselves as slaves for you because of Yeshua .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	4	6	For it is the God who once said , “ Let light shine out of darkness , ” who has made his light shine in our hearts , the light of the knowledge of God ’ s glory shining in the face of the Messiah Yeshua .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	4	7	But we have this treasure in clay jars , so that it will be evident that such overwhelming power comes from God and not from us .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	4	8	We have all kinds of troubles , but we are not crushed ; we are perplexed , yet not in despair ;
CJB	2%20Corinthians	4	9	persecuted , yet not abandoned ; knocked down , yet not destroyed .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	4	10	We always carry in our bodies the dying of Yeshua , so that the life of Yeshua may be manifested in our bodies too .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	4	11	For we who are alive are always being handed over to death for Yeshua ’ s sake , so that Yeshua ’ s life also might be manifested in our mortal bodies .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	4	12	Thus death is at work in us but life in you .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	4	13	The Tanakh says , “ I trusted , therefore I spoke. ” [ a ] Since we have that same Spirit who enables us to trust , we also trust and therefore speak ;
CJB	2%20Corinthians	4	14	because we know that he who raised the Lord Yeshua will also raise us with Yeshua and bring us along with you into his presence .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	4	15	All this is for your sakes , so that as grace flows out to more and more people , it may cause thanksgiving to overflow and bring glory to God .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	4	16	This is why we do not lose courage . Though our outer self is heading for decay , our inner self is being renewed daily .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	4	17	For our light and transient troubles are achieving for us an everlasting glory whose weight is beyond description .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	4	18	We concentrate not on what is seen but on what is not seen , since things seen are temporary , but things not seen are eternal . Footnotes -
CJB	2%20Corinthians	5	2	For in this tent , our earthly body , we groan with desire to have around us the home from heaven that will be ours .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	5	5	Moreover , it is God who has prepared us for this very thing , and as a pledge he has given us his Spirit .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	5	3	With this around us we will not be found naked .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	5	4	Yes , while we are in this body , we groan with the sense of being oppressed : it is not so much that we want to take something off , but rather to put something on over it ; so that what must die may be swallowed up by the Life .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	5	6	So we are always confident — we know that so long as we are at home in the body , we are away from our home with the Lord ;
CJB	2%20Corinthians	5	7	for we live by trust , not by what we see .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	5	8	We are confident , then , and would much prefer to leave our home in the body and come to our home with the Lord .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	5	9	Therefore , whether at home or away from home , we try our utmost to please him ;
CJB	2%20Corinthians	5	10	for we must all appear before the Messiah ’ s court of judgment , where everyone will receive the good or bad consequences of what he did while he was in the body .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	5	11	So it is with the fear of the Lord before us that we try to persuade people . Moreover , God knows us as we really are ; and I hope that in your consciences you too know us as we really are .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	5	12	We are not recommending ourselves to you again but giving you a reason to be proud of us , so that you will be able to answer those who boast about a person ’ s appearance rather than his inner qualities .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	5	13	If we are insane , it is for God ’ s sake ; and if we are sane , it is for your sake .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	5	14	For the Messiah ’ s love has hold of us , because we are convinced that one man died on behalf of all mankind ( which implies that all mankind was already dead ) ,
CJB	2%20Corinthians	5	15	and that he died on behalf of all in order that those who live should not live any longer for themselves but for the one who on their behalf died and was raised .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	5	16	So from now on , we do not look at anyone from a worldly viewpoint . Even if we once regarded the Messiah from a worldly viewpoint , we do so no longer .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	5	17	Therefore , if anyone is united with the Messiah , he is a new creation — the old has passed ; look , what has come is fresh and new !
CJB	2%20Corinthians	5	18	And it is all from God , who through the Messiah has reconciled us to himself and has given us the work of that reconciliation ,
CJB	2%20Corinthians	5	19	which is that God in the Messiah was reconciling mankind to himself , not counting their sins against them , and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	5	20	Therefore we are ambassadors of the Messiah ; in effect , God is making his appeal through us . What we do is appeal on behalf of the Messiah , “ Be reconciled to God !
CJB	2%20Corinthians	5	21	God made this sinless man be a sin offering on our behalf , so that in union with him we might fully share in God ’ s righteousness . ”
CJB	2%20Corinthians	6	2	Samuel 7:14 , Isaiah 43:6
CJB	2%20Corinthians	6	6	We commend ourselves by our purity , knowledge , patience and kindness ; by the Ruach HaKodesh ; by genuineness of love
CJB	2%20Corinthians	6	3	We try not to put obstacles in anyone ’ s path , so that no one can find fault with the work we do .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	6	4	On the contrary , we try to commend ourselves in every way as workers for God by continually enduring troubles , hardships , calamities ,
CJB	2%20Corinthians	6	5	beatings , imprisonments , riots , overwork , lack of sleep and food .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	6	7	and truthfulness of speech ; and by God ’ s power . We commend ourselves through our use of righteous weapons , whether for pressing our cause or defending it ;
CJB	2%20Corinthians	6	8	through being honored and dishonored , praised and blamed , considered deceptive and sincere ,
CJB	2%20Corinthians	6	9	unknown and famous . And we commend ourselves as God ’ s workers headed for death , yet look ! we ’ re alive ! as punished , yet not killed ;
CJB	2%20Corinthians	6	10	as having reason to be sad , yet always filled with joy ; as poor , yet making many people rich ; as having nothing , yet having everything !
CJB	2%20Corinthians	6	11	Dear friends in Corinth ! We have spoken frankly to you , we have opened our hearts wide .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	6	12	Any constraint you feel has not been imposed by us , but by your own inner selves .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	6	13	So , just to be “ fair ” ( I am using the language of children ) , open wide your hearts too .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	6	14	Do not yoke yourselves together in a team with unbelievers . For how can righteousness and lawlessness be partners ? What fellowship does light have with darkness ?
CJB	2%20Corinthians	6	15	What harmony can there be between the Messiah and B ’ liya ‘ al ? What does a believer have in common with an unbeliever ?
CJB	2%20Corinthians	6	16	What agreement can there be between the temple of God and idols ? For we are the temple of the living God — as God said , “ I will house myself in them , . . . and I will walk among you . I will be their God , and they will be my people. ” [ b ]
CJB	2%20Corinthians	6	17	Therefore Adonai says , “ ‘ Go out from their midst ; separate yourselves ; don ’ t even touch what is unclean . [ c ] Then I myself will receive you . [ d ]

CJB	2%20Corinthians	7	2	Make room for us in your hearts — we haven ’ t wronged anyone , we haven ’ t corrupted anyone , we haven ’ t exploited anyone .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	7	7	However , it was not only his arrival which encouraged us , but also how encouraged he was about you , as he told us how you long to see me , how distressed you are over my situation , how zealous you are in my defense — this news made me even happier !
CJB	2%20Corinthians	7	3	I am not saying this to put blame on you , for I have already said that you have a place in our hearts , whether we live together or die together ;
CJB	2%20Corinthians	7	4	that I am very confident in you ; that I am very proud of you ; that you have filled me with encouragement ; and that in spite of all our troubles , I am overflowing with joy .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	7	5	For indeed when we came into Macedonia , our bodies had no rest . On the contrary , we faced all kinds of troubles — altercations without , apprehensions within .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	7	6	But God , who encourages the downhearted , encouraged us with the arrival of Titus !
CJB	2%20Corinthians	7	8	If I caused you pain by my letter , I do not regret it . Even if I did regret it before — for I do see that that letter did distress you , though only for a short time —
CJB	2%20Corinthians	7	9	now I rejoice not because you were pained , but because the pain led you to turn back to God . For you handled the pain in God ’ s way , so that you were not harmed by us at all .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	7	10	Pain handled in God ’ s way produces a turning from sin to God which leads to salvation , and there is nothing to regret in that ! But pain handled in the world ’ s way produces only death .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	7	11	For just look at what handling the pain God ’ s way produced in you ! What earnest diligence , what eagerness to clear yourselves , what indignation , what fear , what longing , what zeal , what readiness to put things right ! In everything you have proved yourselves blameless in the matter .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	7	12	So even though I wrote to you , it was not for the sake of either the one who did the wrong or the one wronged , but so that before God you could see for yourselves how deep is your devotion to us .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	7	13	This is the reason we have been encouraged . Besides our own encouragement , we had the even greater joy of seeing how happy Titus was , because all of you set his mind at rest .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	7	14	For I had boasted somewhat about you to him , and now I have not been made to look foolish . On the contrary , just as everything we have said to you is true , so too our boasting in front of Titus has proved true .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	7	15	And his affection for you is all the greater as he remembers how ready you were to obey and how you received him with reverence and respect .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	7	16	I am glad that I can have such complete confidence in you .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	8	2	Corinthians 8:21 Proverbs 3:4 ( Septuagint )
CJB	2%20Corinthians	8	8	I am not issuing an order ; rather , I am testing the genuineness of your love against the diligence of others .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	8	3	I tell you they have not merely given according to their means , but of their own free will they have given beyond their means .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	8	4	They begged and pleaded with us for the privilege of sharing in this service for God ’ s people .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	8	5	Also , they didn ’ t do this in the way we had expected , but first they gave themselves to the Lord , which means , by God ’ s will , to us .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	8	6	All this has led us to urge Titus to bring this same gracious gift to completion among you , since he has already made a beginning of it .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	8	7	Just as you excel in everything — in faith , in speech , in knowledge , in diligence of every kind , and in your love for us — see that you excel in this gift too .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	8	9	For you know how generous our Lord Yeshua the Messiah was — for your sakes he impoverished himself , even though he was rich , so that he might make you rich by means of his poverty .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	8	10	As I say , in regard to this matter I am only giving an opinion . A year ago you were not only the first to take action but the first to want to do so . Now it would be to your advantage
CJB	2%20Corinthians	8	11	to finish what you started , so that your eagerness in wanting to commence the project may be matched by your eagerness to complete it , as you contribute from what you have .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	8	12	For if the eagerness to give is there , the acceptability of the gift will be measured by what you have , not by what you don ’ t have .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	8	13	It is not that relief for others should cause trouble for you , but that there should be a kind of reciprocity :
CJB	2%20Corinthians	8	14	at present your abundance can help those in need ; so that when you are in need , their abundance can help you — thus there is reciprocity .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	8	15	It is as the Tanakh says , “ He who gathered much had nothing extra , and he who gathered little had nothing lacking. ” [ a ]
CJB	2%20Corinthians	8	16	Now I thank God for making Titus as devoted to you as we are ;
CJB	2%20Corinthians	8	17	for he not only responded to our urging , but , being so devoted , he is coming to you on his own initiative .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	8	18	And with him we are sending the brother whose work for the Good News is praised in all the congregations ;
CJB	2%20Corinthians	8	19	not only that , he has also been appointed by the congregations to travel with us , so that the way we administer this charitable work will bring honor to the Lord and show our eagerness to help .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	8	20	Our aim in this is to show that our conduct in dealing with these substantial sums is above reproach ;
CJB	2%20Corinthians	8	21	for we take pains to do what is right not only in the sight of God but also in the sight of other people . [ b ]
CJB	2%20Corinthians	8	22	With these two we are sending another brother of ours , one whose diligence we have tested many times in many ways , but who is now all the more diligent because of his great confidence in you .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	8	23	As for Titus , he is my partner who works with me on your behalf ; and the other brothers with him are emissaries of the congregations and bring honor to the Messiah .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	8	24	So the love you show these men will justify our pride in you to them , and through them to the congregations that sent them . Footnotes -
CJB	2%20Corinthians	9	2	Corinthians 9:9 Psalm 112:9
CJB	2%20Corinthians	9	9	as the Tanakh says , “ He gave generously to the poor ; his tzedakah lasts forever. ” [ b ]
CJB	2%20Corinthians	9	3	But now I am sending the brothers so that our boast about you in this regard will not prove hollow , so that you will be ready , as I said you would be .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	9	4	For if some Macedonians were to come with me and find you unprepared , we would be humiliated at having been so confident — to say nothing of how you would feel .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	9	5	So I thought it necessary to urge these brothers to go on to you ahead of me and prepare your promised gift in plenty of time ; this way it will be ready when I come and will be a genuine gift , not something extracted by pressure .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	9	6	Here ’ s the point : he who plants sparingly also harvests sparingly .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	9	7	Each should give according to what he has decided in his heart , not grudgingly or under compulsion , for God loves a cheerful giver . [ a ]
CJB	2%20Corinthians	9	8	Moreover , God has the power to provide you with every gracious gift in abundance , so that always in every way you will have all you need yourselves and be able to provide abundantly for every good cause —
CJB	2%20Corinthians	9	10	He who provides both seed for the planter and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed and increase the harvest of your tzedakah .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	9	11	You will be enriched in every way , so that you can be generous in everything . And through us your generosity will cause people to thank God ,
CJB	2%20Corinthians	9	12	because rendering this holy service not only provides for the needs of God ’ s people , but it also overflows in the many thanks people will be giving to God .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	9	13	In offering this service you prove to these people that you glorify God by actually doing what your acknowledgement of the Good News of the Messiah requires , namely , sharing generously with them and with everyone .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	9	14	And in their prayers for you they will feel a strong affection for you because of how gracious God has been to you .

CJB	2%20Corinthians	10	3	For although we do live in the world , we do not wage war in a worldly way ;
CJB	2%20Corinthians	10	4	because the weapons we use to wage war are not worldly . On the contrary , they have God ’ s power for demolishing strongholds . We demolish arguments
CJB	2%20Corinthians	10	5	and every arrogance that raises itself up against the knowledge of God ; we take every thought captive and make it obey the Messiah .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	10	6	And when you have become completely obedient , then we will be ready to punish every act of disobedience .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	10	7	You are looking at the surface of things . If anyone is convinced that he belongs to the Messiah , he should remind himself that we belong to the Messiah as much as he does .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	10	8	For even if I boast a little too much about the authority the Lord has given us — authority to build you up , not tear you down — I am not ashamed .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	10	9	My object is not to seem as if I were trying to frighten you with these letters .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	10	11	Such a person should realize that what we say in our letters when absent , we will do when present .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	10	12	We don ’ t dare class or compare ourselves with some of the people who advertise themselves . In measuring themselves against each other and comparing themselves with each other , they are simply stupid .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	10	13	We will not boast about what lies outside the area of work which God has given us ; rather , we will boast within our assigned area , and that area does reach as far as you .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	10	14	We are not overextending our boasting as if we had not reached as far as you ; for we did come all the way to you with the Good News of the Messiah .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	10	15	We do not boast about the area in which others labor ; but our hope is that as your trust grows , we will be magnified in your midst in relation to our own area of work , so that we can go on to do even more ,
CJB	2%20Corinthians	10	16	namely , to proclaim the Good News in regions beyond you . Our hope is not to boast about the work already done by someone else .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	10	17	So , let anyone who wants to boast , boast about Adonai ; [ a ]

CJB	2%20Corinthians	11	2	For I am jealous for you with God ’ s kind of jealousy ; since I promised to present you as a pure virgin in marriage to your one husband , the Messiah ;
CJB	2%20Corinthians	11	11	Why won ’ t I ever accept your support ? Is it that I don ’ t love you ? God knows I do !
CJB	2%20Corinthians	11	3	and I fear that somehow your minds may be seduced away from simple and pure devotion to the Messiah , just as Havah was deceived by the serpent and his craftiness .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	11	4	For if someone comes and tells you about some other Yeshua than the one we told you about , or if you receive a spirit different from the one you received or accept some so-called “ good news ” different from the Good News you already accepted , you bear with him well enough !
CJB	2%20Corinthians	11	5	For I don ’ t consider myself in any way inferior to these “ super-emissaries. ”
CJB	2%20Corinthians	11	6	I may not be a skilled speaker , but I do have the knowledge ; anyhow , we have made this clear to you in every way and in every circumstance .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	11	7	Or did I sin in humbling myself so that you could be exalted , in proclaiming God ’ s Good News to you free of charge ?
CJB	2%20Corinthians	11	8	I robbed other congregations by accepting support from them in order to serve you .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	11	9	And when I was with you and had needs , I did not burden anyone : my needs were met by the brothers who came from Macedonia . In nothing have I been a burden to you , nor will I be .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	11	10	The truthfulness of the Messiah is in me , so that this boast concerning me is not going to be silenced anywhere in Achaia .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	11	12	No , I do it — and will go on doing it — in order to cut the ground from under those who want an excuse to boast that they work the same way we do .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	11	13	The fact is that such men are pseudo-emissaries : they tell lies about their work and masquerade as emissaries of the Messiah .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	11	14	There is nothing surprising in that , for the Adversary himself masquerades as an angel of light ;
CJB	2%20Corinthians	11	15	so it ’ s no great thing if his workers masquerade as servants of righteousness . They will meet the end their deeds deserve .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	11	16	I repeat : don ’ t let anyone think I am a fool . But even if you do , at least receive me as a fool ; so that I too may do a little boasting !
CJB	2%20Corinthians	11	17	What I am saying is not in accordance with the Lord ; rather , this conceited boasting is spoken as a fool would speak .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	11	18	Since many people boast in a worldly way , I too will boast this way .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	11	19	For since you yourselves are so wise , you gladly put up with fools !
CJB	2%20Corinthians	11	20	You put up with it if someone makes slaves of you , exploits you , takes you in , puffs himself up , slaps you in the face .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	11	21	To my shame , I must admit that we have been too “ weak ” to do such things ! But if anyone dares to boast about something — I ’ m talking like a fool ! — I am just as daring .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	11	22	Are they Hebrew-speakers ? So am I . Are they of the people of Isra ’ el ? So am I . Are they descendants of Avraham ? So am I .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	11	23	Are they servants of the Messiah ? ( I ’ m talking like a madman ! ) I ’ m a better one ! I ’ ve worked much harder , been imprisoned more often , suffered more beatings , been near death over and over .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	11	24	Five times I received “ forty lashes less one ” from the Jews .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	11	25	Three times I was beaten with rods . Once I was stoned . Three times I was shipwrecked . I spent a night and a day in the open sea .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	11	26	In my many travels I have been exposed to danger from rivers , danger from robbers , danger from my own people , danger from Gentiles , danger in the city , danger in the desert , danger at sea , danger from false brothers .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	11	27	I have toiled and endured hardship , often not had enough sleep , been hungry and thirsty , frequently gone without food , been cold and naked .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	11	28	And besides these external matters , there is the daily pressure of my anxious concern for all the congregations .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	11	29	Who is weak without my sharing his weakness ? Who falls into sin without my burning inside ?
CJB	2%20Corinthians	11	30	If I must boast , I will boast about things that show how weak I am .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	11	31	God the Father of the Lord Yeshua — blessed be he forever — knows that I am not lying !
CJB	2%20Corinthians	11	32	When I was in Dalmanuta , the governor under King Aretas had the city of Dalmanuta guarded in order to arrest me ;
CJB	2%20Corinthians	11	33	but I was lowered in a basket through an opening in the wall and escaped his clutches .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	12	2	I know a man in union with the Messiah who fourteen years ago was snatched up to the third heaven ; whether he was in the body or outside the body I don ’ t know , God knows .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	12	12	The things that prove I am an emissary — signs , wonders and miracles — were done in your presence , despite what I had to endure .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	12	3	And I know that such a man — whether in the body or apart from the body I don ’ t know , God knows —
CJB	2%20Corinthians	12	4	was snatched into Gan- ‘ Eden and heard things that can not be put into words , things unlawful for a human being to utter .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	12	5	About such a man I will boast ; but about myself I will not boast , except in regard to my weaknesses .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	12	6	If I did want to boast , I would not be foolish ; because I would be speaking the truth . But , because of the extraordinary greatness of the revelations , I refrain , so that no one will think more of me than what my words or deeds may warrant .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	12	7	Therefore , to keep me from becoming overly proud , I was given a thorn in my flesh , a messenger from the Adversary to pound away at me , so that I wouldn ’ t grow conceited .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	12	8	Three times I begged the Lord to take this thing away from me ;
CJB	2%20Corinthians	12	9	but he told me , “ My grace is enough for you , for my power is brought to perfection in weakness. ” Therefore , I am very happy to boast about my weaknesses , in order that the Messiah ’ s power will rest upon me .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	12	10	Yes , I am well pleased with weaknesses , insults , hardships , persecutions and difficulties endured on behalf of the Messiah ; for it is when I am weak that I am strong .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	12	11	I have behaved like a fool , but you forced me to do it — you who should have been commending me . For I am in no way inferior to the “ super-emissaries , ” even if I am nothing .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	12	13	Is there any way in which you have been behind any of the other congregations , other than in my not having been a burden to you ? For this unfairness , please forgive me !
CJB	2%20Corinthians	12	14	Look , I am ready this third time to come and visit you ; and I will not be a burden to you ; for it is not what you own that I want , but you ! Children are not supposed to save up for their parents , but parents for their children .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	12	15	And as for me , I will most gladly spend everything I have and be spent myself too for your sakes . If I love you more , am I to be loved less ?
CJB	2%20Corinthians	12	16	Let it be granted , then , that I was not a burden to you ; but , crafty fellow that I am , I took you with trickery !
CJB	2%20Corinthians	12	17	Was it perhaps through someone I sent you
CJB	2%20Corinthians	12	18	that I took advantage of you ? I urged Titus to go and sent the brother with him ; Titus didn ’ t take advantage of you , did he ? Didn ’ t we live by the same Spirit and show you the same path ?
CJB	2%20Corinthians	12	19	Perhaps you think that all this time we have been defending ourselves before you . No , we have been speaking in the sight of God , as those united with the Messiah should ; and , my dear friends , it is all for your upbuilding .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	12	20	For I am afraid of coming and finding you not the way I want you to be , and also of not being found the way you want me to be . I am afraid of finding quarreling and jealousy , anger and rivalry , slander and gossip , arrogance and disorder .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	12	21	I am afraid that when I come again , my God may humiliate me in your presence , and that I will be grieved over many of those who sinned in the past and have not repented of the impurity , fornication and debauchery that they have engaged in .

CJB	2%20Corinthians	13	13	All God ’ s people send greetings to you .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	13	3	since you are looking for proof of the Messiah speaking in me . He is not weak in dealing with you , but he is powerful among you .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	13	4	For although he was executed on a stake in weakness , now he lives by God ’ s power . And we too are weak in union with him , but in dealing with you we will live with him by God ’ s power .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	13	5	Examine yourselves to see whether you are living the life of trust . Test yourselves . Don ’ t you realize that Yeshua the Messiah is in you ? — unless you fail to pass the test .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	13	6	But I hope you will realize that we are not failures .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	13	7	And we pray to God that you will do nothing wrong . We are not concerned with our appearing successful , but with your doing what is right , even if we appear to be failures .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	13	8	For we can not act against the truth , only for it .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	13	9	So we rejoice whenever we are weak and you are strong ; indeed , what we pray for is that you become perfect .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	13	10	I write these things while away from you , so that when I am with you I will not have to use my authority to deal sharply with you , for the Lord gave it to me for building up and not for tearing down .
CJB	2%20Corinthians	13	11	And now , brothers , shalom ! Put yourselves in order , pay attention to my advice , be of one mind , live in shalom — and the God of love and shalom will be with you .

CJB	Galatians	1	3	Grace and shalom to you from God our Father and from the Lord Yeshua the Messiah ,

CJB	Galatians	1	5	To him be the glory forever and ever ! Amen .
CJB	Galatians	1	6	I am astounded that you are so quick to remove yourselves from me , the one who called you by the Messiah ’ s grace , and turn to some other supposedly “ Good News , ”
CJB	Galatians	1	7	which is not good news at all ! What is really happening is that certain people are pestering you and trying to pervert the genuine Good News of the Messiah .
CJB	Galatians	1	8	But even if we — or , for that matter , an angel from heaven ! — were to announce to you some so-called “ Good News ” contrary to the Good News we did announce to you , let him be under a curse forever !
CJB	Galatians	1	9	We said it before , and I say it again : if anyone announces “ Good News ” contrary to what you received , let him be under a curse forever !
CJB	Galatians	1	10	Now does that sound as if I were trying to win human approval ? No ! I want God ’ s approval ! Or that I ’ m trying to cater to people ? If I were still doing that , I would not be a servant of the Messiah .
CJB	Galatians	1	11	Furthermore , let me make clear to you , brothers , that the Good News as I proclaim it is not a human product ;
CJB	Galatians	1	12	because neither did I receive it from someone else nor was I taught it — it came through a direct revelation from Yeshua the Messiah .
CJB	Galatians	1	13	For you have heard about my former way of life in [ traditional ] Judaism — how I did my best to persecute God ’ s Messianic Community and destroy it ;
CJB	Galatians	1	14	and how , since I was more of a zealot for the traditions handed down by my forefathers than most Jews my age , I advanced in [ traditional ] Judaism more rapidly than they did .
CJB	Galatians	1	15	But when God , who picked me out before I was born and called me by his grace , chose
CJB	Galatians	1	16	to reveal his Son to me , so that I might announce him to the Gentiles , I did not consult anyone ;
CJB	Galatians	1	17	and I did not go up to Yerushalayim to see those who were emissaries before me . Instead , I immediately went off to Arabia and afterwards returned to Dammesek .
CJB	Galatians	1	18	Not until three years later did I go up to Yerushalayim to make Kefa ’ s acquaintance , and I stayed with him for two weeks ,
CJB	Galatians	1	19	but I did not see any of the other emissaries except Ya ‘ akov the Lord ’ s brother .
CJB	Galatians	1	20	( Concerning these matters I am writing you about , I declare before God that I am not lying ! )
CJB	Galatians	1	21	Next I went to Syria and Cilicia ;
CJB	Galatians	1	22	but in Y ’ hudah , the Messianic congregations didn ’ t even know what I looked like —
CJB	Galatians	1	23	they were only hearing the report , “ The one who used to persecute us now preaches the Good News of the faith he was formerly out to destroy ” ;
CJB	Galatians	1	24	and they praised God for me .
CJB	Galatians	2	2	I went up in obedience to a revelation , and I explained to them the Good News as I proclaim it among the Gentiles — but privately , to the acknowledged leaders . I did this out of concern that my current or previous work might have been in vain .
CJB	Galatians	2	3	But they didn ’ t force my Gentile companion Titus to undergo b ’ rit-milah .
CJB	Galatians	2	4	Indeed , the question came up only because some men who pretended to be brothers had been sneaked in — they came in surreptitiously to spy out the freedom we have in the Messiah Yeshua , so that they might enslave us .
CJB	Galatians	2	5	Not even for a minute did we give in to them , so that the truth of the Good News might be preserved for you .
CJB	Galatians	2	6	Moreover , those who were the acknowledged leaders — what they were makes no difference to me ; God does not judge by outward appearances — these leaders added nothing to me .
CJB	Galatians	2	7	On the contrary , they saw that I had been entrusted with the Good News for the Uncircumcised , just as Kefa had been for the Circumcised ;
CJB	Galatians	2	8	since the One working in Kefa to make him an emissary to the Circumcised had worked in me to make me an emissary to the Gentiles .
CJB	Galatians	2	9	So , having perceived what grace had been given to me , Ya ‘ akov , Kefa and Yochanan , the acknowledged pillars of the community , extended to me and Bar-Nabba the right hand of fellowship ; so that we might go to the Gentiles , and they to the Circumcised .
CJB	Galatians	2	10	Their only request was that we should remember the poor — which very thing I have spared no pains to do .
CJB	Galatians	2	11	Furthermore , when Kefa came to Antioch , I opposed him publicly , because he was clearly in the wrong .
CJB	Galatians	2	12	For prior to the arrival of certain people from [ the community headed by ] Ya ‘ akov , he had been eating with the Gentile believers ; but when they came , he withdrew and separated himself , because he was afraid of the faction who favored circumcising Gentile believers .
CJB	Galatians	2	13	And the other Jewish believers became hypocrites along with him , so that even Bar-Nabba was led astray by their hypocrisy .
CJB	Galatians	2	14	But when I saw that they were not walking a straight path , keeping in line with the truth of the Good News , I said to Kefa , right in front of everyone , “ If you , who are a Jew , live like a Goy and not like a Jew , why are you forcing the Goyim to live like Jews ?
CJB	Galatians	2	15	We are Jews by birth , not so-called ‘ Goyishe sinners ’ ;
CJB	Galatians	2	16	even so , we have come to realize that a person is not declared righteous by God on the ground of his legalistic observance of Torah commands , but through the Messiah Yeshua ’ s trusting faithfulness . Therefore , we too have put our trust in Messiah Yeshua and become faithful to him , in order that we might be declared righteous on the ground of the Messiah ’ s trusting faithfulness and not on the ground of our legalistic observance of Torah commands . For on the ground of legalistic observance of Torah commands , no one will be declared righteous . [ a ]
CJB	Galatians	2	17	But if , in seeking to be declared righteous by God through our union with the Messiah , we ourselves are indeed found to be sinners , then is the Messiah an aider and abettor of sin ? Heaven forbid !
CJB	Galatians	2	18	Indeed , if I build up again the legalistic bondage which I destroyed , I really do make myself a transgressor .
CJB	Galatians	2	19	For it was through letting the Torah speak for itself that I died to its traditional legalistic misinterpretation , so that I might live in direct relationship with God .
CJB	Galatians	2	20	When the Messiah was executed on the stake as a criminal , I was too ; so that my proud ego no longer lives . But the Messiah lives in me , and the life I now live in my body I live by the same trusting faithfulness that the Son of God had , who loved me and gave himself up for me .
CJB	Galatians	2	21	I do not reject God ’ s gracious gift ; for if the way in which one attains righteousness is through legalism , then the Messiah ’ s death was pointless . Footnotes - Galatians 2:16 Psalm 143:2
CJB	Galatians	3	3	Are you that stupid ? Having begun with the Spirit ’ s power , do you think you can reach the goal under your own power ?
CJB	Galatians	3	2	I want to know from you just this one thing : did you receive the Spirit by legalistic observance of Torah commands or by trusting in what you heard and being faithful to it ?
CJB	Galatians	3	4	Have you suffered so much for nothing ? If that ’ s the way you think , your suffering certainly will have been for nothing !
CJB	Galatians	3	5	What about God , who supplies you with the Spirit and works miracles among you — does he do it because of your legalistic observance of Torah commands or because you trust in what you heard and are faithful to it ?
CJB	Galatians	3	6	It was the same with Avraham : “ He trusted in God and was faithful to him , and that was credited to his account as righteousness. ” [ a ]
CJB	Galatians	3	7	Be assured , then , that it is those who live by trusting and being faithful who are really children of Avraham .
CJB	Galatians	3	8	Also the Tanakh , foreseeing that God would consider the Gentiles righteous when they live by trusting and being faithful , told the Good News to Avraham in advance by saying , “ In connection with you , all the Goyim will be blessed. ” [ b ]
CJB	Galatians	3	9	So then , those who rely on trusting and being faithful are blessed along with Avraham , who trusted and was faithful .
CJB	Galatians	3	10	For everyone who depends on legalistic observance of Torah commands lives under a curse , since it is written , “ Cursed is everyone who does not keep on doing everything written in the Scroll of the Torah. ” [ c ]
CJB	Galatians	3	11	Now it is evident that no one comes to be declared righteous by God through legalism , since “ The person who is righteous will attain life by trusting and being faithful. ” [ d ]
CJB	Galatians	3	12	Furthermore , legalism is not based on trusting and being faithful , but on [ a misuse of ] the text that says , “ Anyone who does these things will attain life through them. ” [ e ]
CJB	Galatians	3	13	The Messiah redeemed us from the curse pronounced in the Torah by becoming cursed on our behalf ; for the Tanakh says , “ Everyone who hangs from a stake comes under a curse. ” [ f ]
CJB	Galatians	3	14	Yeshua the Messiah did this so that in union with him the Gentiles might receive the blessing announced to Avraham , so that through trusting and being faithful , we might receive what was promised , namely , the Spirit .
CJB	Galatians	3	15	Brothers , let me make an analogy from everyday life : when someone swears an oath , no one else can set it aside or add to it .
CJB	Galatians	3	16	Now the promises were made to Avraham and to his seed . It doesn ’ t say , “ and to seeds , ” as if to many ; on the contrary , it speaks of one — “ and to your seed ” [ g ] — and this “ one ” is the Messiah .
CJB	Galatians	3	17	Here is what I am saying : the legal part of the Torah , which came into being
CJB	Galatians	3	430	years later , does not nullify an oath sworn by God , so as to abolish the promise .
CJB	Galatians	3	18	For if the inheritance comes from the legal part of the Torah , it no longer comes from a promise . But God gave it to Avraham through a promise .
CJB	Galatians	3	19	So then , why the legal part of the Torah ? It was added in order to create transgressions , until the coming of the seed about whom the promise had been made . Moreover , it was handed down through angels and a mediator .
CJB	Galatians	3	20	Now a mediator implies more than one , but God is one .
CJB	Galatians	3	21	Does this mean that the legal part of the Torah stands in opposition to God ’ s promises ? Heaven forbid ! For if the legal part of the Torah which God gave had had in itself the power to give life , then righteousness really would have come by legalistically following such a Torah .
CJB	Galatians	3	22	But instead , the Tanakh shuts up everything under sin ; so that what had been promised might be given , on the basis of Yeshua the Messiah ’ s trusting faithfulness , to those who continue to be trustingly faithful .
CJB	Galatians	3	23	Now before the time for this trusting faithfulness came , we were imprisoned in subjection to the system which results from perverting the Torah into legalism , kept under guard until this yet-to-come trusting faithfulness would be revealed .
CJB	Galatians	3	24	Accordingly , the Torah functioned as a custodian until the Messiah came , so that we might be declared righteous on the ground of trusting and being faithful .
CJB	Galatians	3	25	But now that the time for this trusting faithfulness has come , we are no longer under a custodian .
CJB	Galatians	3	26	For in union with the Messiah , you are all children of God through this trusting faithfulness ;
CJB	Galatians	3	27	because as many of you as were immersed into the Messiah have clothed yourselves with the Messiah , in whom
CJB	Galatians	3	28	there is neither Jew nor Gentile , neither slave nor freeman , neither male nor female ; for in union with the Messiah Yeshua , you are all one .
CJB	Galatians	3	29	Also , if you belong to the Messiah , you are seed of Avraham and heirs according to the promise . Footnotes - Galatians 3:6 Genesis 15:6 - Galatians 3:8 Genesis 12:3 - Galatians 3:10 Deuteronomy 27:26 - Galatians 3:11 Habakkuk 2:4 - Galatians 3:12 Leviticus 18:5 - Galatians 3:13 Deuteronomy 21:22–23 - Galatians 3:16 Genesis 12:7 ; 13:15 ; 17:7 ; 24:7
CJB	Galatians	4	4	but when the appointed time arrived , God sent forth his Son . He was born from a woman , born into a culture in which legalistic perversion of the Torah was the norm ,
CJB	Galatians	4	2	rather , he is subject to guardians and caretakers until the time previously set by his father .
CJB	Galatians	4	3	So it is with us — when we were “ children ” we were slaves to the elemental spirits of the universe ;
CJB	Galatians	4	5	so that he might redeem those in subjection to this legalism and thus enable us to be made God ’ s sons .
CJB	Galatians	4	6	Now because you are sons , God has sent forth into our hearts the Spirit of his Son , the Spirit who cries out , “ Abba ! ” ( that is , “ Dear Father ! ” ) .
CJB	Galatians	4	7	So through God you are no longer a slave but a son , and if you are a son you are also an heir .
CJB	Galatians	4	8	In the past , when you did not know God , you served as slaves beings which in reality are non-gods .
CJB	Galatians	4	9	But now you do know God , and , more than that , you are known by God . So how is it that you turn back again to those weak and miserable elemental spirits ? Do you want to enslave yourselves to them once more ?
CJB	Galatians	4	10	You observe special days , months , seasons and years !
CJB	Galatians	4	11	I fear for you that my work among you has been wasted !
CJB	Galatians	4	12	Brothers , I beg of you : put yourselves in my place — after all , I put myself in your place . It isn ’ t that you have done me any wrong —
CJB	Galatians	4	13	you know that it was because I was ill that I proclaimed the Good News to you at first ;
CJB	Galatians	4	14	and even though my physical condition must have tempted you to treat me with scorn , you did not display any sign of disdain or disgust . No , you welcomed me as if I had been an angel of God , as if I had been the Messiah Yeshua himself !
CJB	Galatians	4	15	So what has become of the joy you felt ? For I bear you witness that had it been possible , you would have gouged out your eyes and given them to me .
CJB	Galatians	4	16	Have I now become your enemy because I tell you the truth ?
CJB	Galatians	4	17	True , these teachers are zealous for you , but their motives are not good . They want to separate you from us so that you will become zealous for them .
CJB	Galatians	4	18	To be zealous is good , provided always that the cause is good . Indeed , whether I am present with you or not ,
CJB	Galatians	4	19	my dear children , I am suffering the pains of giving birth to you all over again — and this will go on until the Messiah takes shape in you .
CJB	Galatians	4	20	I wish I could be present with you now and change my tone of voice . I don ’ t know what to do with you .
CJB	Galatians	4	21	Tell me , you who want to be in subjection to the system that results from perverting the Torah into legalism , don ’ t you hear what the Torah itself says ?
CJB	Galatians	4	22	It says that Avraham had two sons , one by the slave woman and one by the free woman .
CJB	Galatians	4	23	The one by the slave woman was born according to the limited capabilities of human beings , but the one by the free woman was born through the miracle-working power of God fulfilling his promise .
CJB	Galatians	4	24	Now , to make a midrash on these things : the two women are two covenants . One is from Mount Sinai and bears children for slavery — this is Hagar .
CJB	Galatians	4	25	Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia ; she corresponds to the present Yerushalayim , for she serves as a slave along with her children .
CJB	Galatians	4	26	But the Yerushalayim above is free , and she is our mother ;
CJB	Galatians	4	27	for the Tanakh says , “ Rejoice , you barren woman who does not bear children ! Break forth and shout , you who are not in labor ! For the deserted wife will have more children than the one whose husband is with her ! ” [ a ]
CJB	Galatians	4	28	You , brothers , like Yitz ’ chak , are children referred to in a promise of God .
CJB	Galatians	4	29	But just as then the one born according to limited human capability persecuted the one born through the Spirit ’ s supernatural power , so it is now .
CJB	Galatians	4	30	Nevertheless , what does the Tanakh say ? “ Get rid of the slave woman and her son , for by no means will the son of the slave woman inherit along with the son of the free woman ! ” [ b ]
CJB	Galatians	4	31	So , brothers , we are children not of the slave woman , but of the free woman . Footnotes - Galatians 4:27 Isaiah 54:1 - Galatians 4:30 Genesis 2l:10
CJB	Galatians	5	5	For it is by the power of the Spirit , who works in us because we trust and are faithful , that we confidently expect our hope of attaining righteousness to be fulfilled .
CJB	Galatians	5	2	Mark my words — I , Sha ’ ul , tell you that if you undergo b ’ rit-milah the Messiah will be of no advantage to you at all !
CJB	Galatians	5	3	Again , I warn you : any man who undergoes b ’ rit-milah is obligated to observe the entire Torah !
CJB	Galatians	5	4	You who are trying to be declared righteous by God through legalism have severed yourselves from the Messiah ! You have fallen away from God ’ s grace !
CJB	Galatians	5	6	When we are united with the Messiah Yeshua , neither being circumcised nor being uncircumcised matters ; what matters is trusting faithfulness expressing itself through love .
CJB	Galatians	5	7	You were running the race well ; who has stopped you from following the truth ?
CJB	Galatians	5	8	Whatever means of persuasion he used was not from the One who calls you .
CJB	Galatians	5	9	“ It takes only a little hametz to leaven the whole batch of dough. ”
CJB	Galatians	5	10	I am confident that since you are united with the Lord , you will take no other view ; and I am confident that the one who has been disturbing you , whoever he may be , will have to bear his punishment .
CJB	Galatians	5	11	And as for me , brothers , if I am still preaching that circumcision is necessary , why am I still being persecuted ? If that were the case , my preaching about the execution-stake would cause no offense whatever .
CJB	Galatians	5	12	I wish the people who are bothering you would go the whole way and castrate themselves !
CJB	Galatians	5	13	For , brothers , you were called to be free . Only do not let that freedom become an excuse for allowing your old nature to have its way . Instead , serve one another in love .
CJB	Galatians	5	14	For the whole of the Torah is summed up in this one sentence : “ Love your neighbor as yourself ” ; [ a ]
CJB	Galatians	5	15	but if you go on snapping at each other and tearing each other to pieces , watch out , or you will be destroyed by each other !
CJB	Galatians	5	16	What I am saying is this : run your lives by the Spirit . Then you will not do what your old nature wants .
CJB	Galatians	5	17	For the old nature wants what is contrary to the Spirit , and the Spirit wants what is contrary to the old nature . These oppose each other , so that you find yourselves unable to carry out your good intentions .
CJB	Galatians	5	18	But if you are led by the Spirit , then you are not in subjection to the system that results from perverting the Torah into legalism .
CJB	Galatians	5	19	And it is perfectly evident what the old nature does . It expresses itself in sexual immorality , impurity and indecency ;
CJB	Galatians	5	20	involvement with the occult and with drugs ; in feuding , fighting , becoming jealous and getting angry ; in selfish ambition , factionalism , intrigue
CJB	Galatians	5	21	and envy ; in drunkenness , orgies and things like these . I warn you now as I have warned you before : those who do such things will have no share in the Kingdom of God !
CJB	Galatians	5	22	But the fruit of the Spirit is love , joy , peace , patience , kindness , goodness , faithfulness ,
CJB	Galatians	5	23	humility , self control . Nothing in the Torah stands against such things .
CJB	Galatians	5	24	Moreover , those who belong to the Messiah Yeshua have put their old nature to death on the stake , along with its passions and desires .
CJB	Galatians	5	25	Since it is through the Spirit that we have Life , let it also be through the Spirit that we order our lives day by day .
CJB	Galatians	5	26	Let us not become conceited , provoking and envying each other . Footnotes - Galatians 5:14 Leviticus 19:18
CJB	Galatians	6	6	But whoever is being instructed in the Word should share all the good things he has with his instructor .
CJB	Galatians	6	2	Bear one another ’ s burdens — in this way you will be fulfilling the Torah ’ s true meaning , which the Messiah upholds .
CJB	Galatians	6	3	For if anyone thinks he is something when he is really nothing , he is fooling himself .
CJB	Galatians	6	4	So let each of you scrutinize his own actions . Then if you do find something to boast about , at least the boasting will be based on what you have actually done and not merely on a judgment that you are better than someone else ;
CJB	Galatians	6	5	for each person will carry his own load .
CJB	Galatians	6	7	Don ’ t delude yourselves : no one makes a fool of God ! A person reaps what he sows .
CJB	Galatians	6	8	Those who keep sowing in the field of their old nature , in order to meet its demands , will eventually reap ruin ; but those who keep sowing in the field of the Spirit will reap from the Spirit everlasting life .
CJB	Galatians	6	9	So let us not grow weary of doing what is good ; for if we don ’ t give up , we will in due time reap the harvest .
CJB	Galatians	6	10	Therefore , as the opportunity arises , let us do what is good to everyone , and especially to the family of those who are trustingly faithful .
CJB	Galatians	6	11	Look at the large letters I use as I close in my own handwriting .
CJB	Galatians	6	12	It is those who want to look good outwardly who are trying to get you to be circumcised . The only reason they are doing it is to escape persecution for preaching about the Messiah ’ s execution-stake .
CJB	Galatians	6	13	For even those who are getting circumcised don ’ t observe the Torah . On the contrary , they want you to get circumcised so that they can boast of having gained your adherence .
CJB	Galatians	6	14	But as for me , Heaven forbid that I should boast about anything except the execution-stake of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah ! Through him , as far as I am concerned , the world has been put to death on the stake ; and through him , as far as the world is concerned , I have been put to death on the stake .
CJB	Galatians	6	15	For neither being circumcised nor being uncircumcised matters ; what matters is being a new creation .
CJB	Galatians	6	16	And as many as order their lives by this rule , shalom upon them and mercy , and upon the Isra ’ el of God !
CJB	Galatians	6	17	From now on , I don ’ t want anyone to give me any more tsuris , because I have scars on my body to prove that I belong to Yeshua !
CJB	Galatians	6	18	The grace of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah be with your spirit , brothers . Amen .
CJB	Ephesians	1	1	From : Sha ’ ul , by God ’ s will an emissary of the Messiah Yeshua To : God ’ s people living in Ephesus , that is , those who are trusting in the Messiah Yeshua :
CJB	Ephesians	1	2	Grace to you and shalom from God our Father and the Lord Yeshua the Messiah .
CJB	Ephesians	1	3	Praised be Adonai , Father of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah , who in the Messiah has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in heaven .
CJB	Ephesians	1	4	In the Messiah he chose us in love before the creation of the universe to be holy and without defect in his presence .
CJB	Ephesians	1	5	He determined in advance that through Yeshua the Messiah we would be his sons — in keeping with his pleasure and purpose —
CJB	Ephesians	1	6	)
CJB	Ephesians	1	7	In union with him , through the shedding of his blood , we are set free — our sins are forgiven ; this accords with the wealth of the grace
CJB	Ephesians	1	8	he has lavished on us . In all his wisdom and insight
CJB	Ephesians	1	9	he has made known to us his secret plan , which by his own will he designed beforehand in connection with the Messiah
CJB	Ephesians	1	10	and will put into effect when the time is ripe — his plan to place everything in heaven and on earth under the Messiah ’ s headship .
CJB	Ephesians	1	11	Also in union with him we were given an inheritance , we who were picked in advance according to the purpose of the One who effects everything in keeping with the decision of his will ,
CJB	Ephesians	1	12	so that we who earlier had put our hope in the Messiah would bring him praise commensurate with his glory .
CJB	Ephesians	1	13	Furthermore , you who heard the message of the truth , the Good News offering you deliverance , and put your trust in the Messiah were sealed by him with the promised Ruach HaKodesh ,
CJB	Ephesians	1	14	who guarantees our inheritance until we come into possession of it and thus bring him praise commensurate with his glory .
CJB	Ephesians	1	15	For this reason , ever since I heard about your trust in the Lord Yeshua and your love for all God ’ s people ,
CJB	Ephesians	1	16	I have not stopped giving thanks for you . In my prayers I keep asking
CJB	Ephesians	1	17	the God of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah , the glorious Father , to give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation , so that you will have full knowledge of him .
CJB	Ephesians	1	18	I pray that he will give light to the eyes of your hearts , so that you will understand the hope to which he has called you , what rich glories there are in the inheritance he has promised his people ,
CJB	Ephesians	1	19	and how surpassingly great is his power working in us who trust him . It works with the same mighty strength he used
CJB	Ephesians	1	20	when he worked in the Messiah to raise him from the dead and seat him at his right hand in heaven ,
CJB	Ephesians	1	21	far above every ruler , authority , power , dominion or any other name that can be named either in the ‘ olam hazeh or in the ‘ olam haba .
CJB	Ephesians	1	22	Also , he has put all things under his feet [ a ] and made him head over everything for the Messianic Community ,
CJB	Ephesians	1	23	which is his body , the full expression of him who fills all creation . Footnotes - Ephesians 1:22 Psalm 8:7 (
CJB	Ephesians	2	2	You walked in the ways of the ‘ olam hazeh and obeyed the Ruler of the Powers of the Air , who is still at work among the disobedient .
CJB	Ephesians	2	3	Indeed , we all once lived this way — we followed the passions of our old nature and obeyed the wishes of our old nature and our own thoughts . In our natural condition we were headed for God ’ s wrath , just like everyone else .
CJB	Ephesians	2	4	But God is so rich in mercy and loves us with such intense love
CJB	Ephesians	2	5	that , even when we were dead because of our acts of disobedience , he brought us to life along with the Messiah — it is by grace that you have been delivered .
CJB	Ephesians	2	6	That is , God raised us up with the Messiah Yeshua and seated us with him in heaven ,
CJB	Ephesians	2	7	in order to exhibit in the ages to come how infinitely rich is his grace , how great is his kindness toward us who are united with the Messiah Yeshua .
CJB	Ephesians	2	8	For you have been delivered by grace through trusting , and even this is not your accomplishment but God ’ s gift .
CJB	Ephesians	2	9	You were not delivered by your own actions ; therefore no one should boast .
CJB	Ephesians	2	10	For we are of God ’ s making , created in union with the Messiah Yeshua for a life of good actions already prepared by God for us to do .
CJB	Ephesians	2	11	Therefore , remember your former state : you Gentiles by birth — called the Uncircumcised by those who , merely because of an operation on their flesh , are called the Circumcised —
CJB	Ephesians	2	12	at that time had no Messiah . You were estranged from the national life of Isra ’ el . You were foreigners to the covenants embodying God ’ s promise . You were in this world without hope and without God .
CJB	Ephesians	2	13	But now , you who were once far off have been brought near through the shedding of the Messiah ’ s blood .
CJB	Ephesians	2	14	For he himself is our shalom — he has made us both one and has broken down the m ’ chitzah which divided us
CJB	Ephesians	2	15	by destroying in his own body the enmity occasioned by the Torah , with its commands set forth in the form of ordinances . He did this in order to create in union with himself from the two groups a single new humanity and thus make shalom ,
CJB	Ephesians	2	16	and in order to reconcile to God both in a single body by being executed on a stake as a criminal and thus in himself killing that enmity .
CJB	Ephesians	2	17	Also , when he came , he announced as Good News shalom to you far off and shalom to those nearby , [ a ]
CJB	Ephesians	2	18	news that through him we both have access in one Spirit to the Father .
CJB	Ephesians	2	19	So then , you are no longer foreigners and strangers . On the contrary , you are fellow-citizens with God ’ s people and members of God ’ s family .
CJB	Ephesians	2	20	You have been built on the foundation of the emissaries and the prophets , with the cornerstone being Yeshua the Messiah himself .
CJB	Ephesians	2	21	In union with him the whole building is held together , and it is growing into a holy temple in union with the Lord .
CJB	Ephesians	2	22	Yes , in union with him , you yourselves are being built together into a spiritual dwelling-place for God ! Footnotes - Ephesians 2:17 Isaiah 57:19
CJB	Ephesians	3	3	and that it was by a revelation that this secret plan was made known to me . I have already written about it briefly ,
CJB	Ephesians	3	2	I assume that you have heard of the work God in his grace has given me to do for your benefit ,
CJB	Ephesians	3	4	and if you read what I have written , you will grasp how I understand this secret plan concerning the Messiah .
CJB	Ephesians	3	5	In past generations it was not made known to mankind , as the Spirit is now revealing it to his emissaries and prophets ,
CJB	Ephesians	3	6	that in union with the Messiah and through the Good News the Gentiles were to be joint heirs , a joint body and joint sharers with the Jews in what God has promised .
CJB	Ephesians	3	7	I became a servant of this Good News by God ’ s gracious gift , which he gave me through the operation of his power .
CJB	Ephesians	3	8	To me , the least important of all God ’ s holy people , was given this privilege of announcing to the Gentiles the Good News of the Messiah ’ s unfathomable riches ,
CJB	Ephesians	3	9	and of letting everyone see how this secret plan is going to work out . This plan , kept hidden for ages by God , the Creator of everything ,
CJB	Ephesians	3	10	is for the rulers and authorities in heaven to learn , through the existence of the Messianic Community , how many-sided God ’ s wisdom is .
CJB	Ephesians	3	11	This accords with God ’ s age-old purpose , accomplished in the Messiah Yeshua , our Lord .
CJB	Ephesians	3	12	In union with him , through his faithfulness , we have boldness and confidence when we approach God .
CJB	Ephesians	3	13	So I ask you not to be discouraged by the troubles I endure on your behalf — it is all for your glory .
CJB	Ephesians	3	14	For this reason , I fall on my knees before the Father ,
CJB	Ephesians	3	15	from whom every family in heaven and on earth receives its character .
CJB	Ephesians	3	16	I pray that from the treasures of his glory he will empower you with inner strength by his Spirit ,
CJB	Ephesians	3	17	so that the Messiah may live in your hearts through your trusting . Also I pray that you will be rooted and founded in love ,
CJB	Ephesians	3	18	so that you , with all God ’ s people , will be given strength to grasp the breadth , length , height and depth of the Messiah ’ s love ,
CJB	Ephesians	3	19	yes , to know it , even though it is beyond all knowing , so that you will be filled with all the fullness of God .
CJB	Ephesians	3	20	Now to him who by his power working in us is able to do far beyond anything we can ask or imagine ,
CJB	Ephesians	3	21	to him be glory in the Messianic Community and in the Messiah Yeshua from generation to generation forever . Amen .
CJB	Ephesians	4	4	)
CJB	Ephesians	4	2	Always be humble , gentle and patient , bearing with one another in love ,
CJB	Ephesians	4	3	and making every effort to preserve the unity the Spirit gives through the binding power of shalom .
CJB	Ephesians	4	5	And there is one Lord , one trust , one immersion ,
CJB	Ephesians	4	6	and one God , the Father of all , who rules over all , works through all and is in all .
CJB	Ephesians	4	7	Each one of us , however , has been given grace to be measured by the Messiah ’ s bounty .
CJB	Ephesians	4	8	This is why it says , “ After he went up into the heights , he led captivity captive and he gave gifts to mankind. ” [ a ]
CJB	Ephesians	4	9	Now this phrase , “ he went up , ” what can it mean if not that he first went down into the lower parts , that is , the earth ?
CJB	Ephesians	4	10	The one who went down is himself the one who also went up , far above all of heaven , in order to fill all things .
CJB	Ephesians	4	11	Furthermore , he gave some people as emissaries , some as prophets , some as proclaimers of the Good News , and some as shepherds and teachers .
CJB	Ephesians	4	12	Their task is to equip God ’ s people for the work of service that builds the body of the Messiah ,
CJB	Ephesians	4	13	until we all arrive at the unity implied by trusting and knowing the Son of God , at full manhood , at the standard of maturity set by the Messiah ’ s perfection .
CJB	Ephesians	4	14	We will then no longer be infants tossed about by the waves and blown along by every wind of teaching , at the mercy of people clever in devising ways to deceive .
CJB	Ephesians	4	15	Instead , speaking the truth in love , we will in every respect grow up into him who is the head , the Messiah .
CJB	Ephesians	4	16	Under his control , the whole body is being fitted and held together by the support of every joint , with each part working to fulfill its function ; this is how the body grows and builds itself up in love .
CJB	Ephesians	4	17	Therefore I say this — indeed , in union with the Lord I insist on it : do not live any longer as the pagans live , with their sterile ways of thinking .
CJB	Ephesians	4	18	) - Ephesians 4:25 Zechariah 8:16 - Ephesians 4:26 Psalm 4:5 (
CJB	Ephesians	4	19	They have lost all feeling , so they have abandoned themselves to sensuality , practicing any kind of impurity and always greedy for more .
CJB	Ephesians	4	20	But this is not the lesson you learned from the Messiah !
CJB	Ephesians	4	21	If you really listened to him and were instructed about him , then you learned that since what is in Yeshua is truth ,
CJB	Ephesians	4	22	then , so far as your former way of life is concerned , you must strip off your old nature , because your old nature is thoroughly rotted by its deceptive desires ;
CJB	Ephesians	4	23	and you must let your spirits and minds keep being renewed ,
CJB	Ephesians	4	24	and clothe yourselves with the new nature created to be godly , which expresses itself in the righteousness and holiness that flow from the truth .
CJB	Ephesians	4	25	Therefore , stripping off falsehood , let everyone speak truth with his neighbor , [ b ] because we are intimately related to each other as parts of a body .
CJB	Ephesians	4	26	Be angry , but don ’ t sin [ c ] — don ’ t let the sun go down before you have dealt with the cause of your anger ;
CJB	Ephesians	4	27	otherwise you leave room for the Adversary .
CJB	Ephesians	4	28	The thief must stop stealing ; instead , he should make an honest living by his own efforts . This way he will be able to share with those in need .
CJB	Ephesians	4	29	Let no harmful language come from your mouth , only good words that are helpful in meeting the need , words that will benefit those who hear them .
CJB	Ephesians	4	30	Don ’ t cause grief to God ’ s Ruach HaKodesh , for he has stamped you as his property until the day of final redemption .
CJB	Ephesians	4	31	Get rid of all bitterness , rage , anger , violent assertiveness and slander , along with all spitefulness .
CJB	Ephesians	4	32	Instead , be kind to each other , tenderhearted ; and forgive each other , just as in the Messiah God has also forgiven you . Footnotes - Ephesians 4:8 Psalm 68:19 (
CJB	Ephesians	5	5	For of this you can be sure : every sexually immoral , impure or greedy person — that is , every idol-worshipper — has no share in the Kingdom of the Messiah and of God .
CJB	Ephesians	5	2	and live a life of love , just as also the Messiah loved us , indeed , on our behalf gave himself up as an offering , as a slaughtered sacrifice to God with a pleasing fragrance .
CJB	Ephesians	5	3	Among you there should not even be mentioned sexual immorality , or any kind of impurity , or greed ; these are utterly inappropriate for God ’ s holy people .
CJB	Ephesians	5	4	Also out of place are obscenity and stupid talk or coarse language ; instead , you should be giving thanks .
CJB	Ephesians	5	6	Let no one deceive you with empty talk ; for it is because of these things that God ’ s judgment is coming on those who disobey him .
CJB	Ephesians	5	7	So don ’ t become partners with them !
CJB	Ephesians	5	8	For you used to be darkness ; but now , united with the Lord , you are light . Live like children of light ,
CJB	Ephesians	5	9	for the fruit of the light is in every kind of goodness , rightness and truth —
CJB	Ephesians	5	10	try to determine what will please the Lord .
CJB	Ephesians	5	11	Have nothing to do with the deeds produced by darkness , but instead expose them ,
CJB	Ephesians	5	12	for it is shameful even to speak of the things these people do in secret .
CJB	Ephesians	5	13	But everything exposed to the light is revealed clearly for what it is ,
CJB	Ephesians	5	14	since anything revealed is a light . This is why it says , “ Get up , sleeper ! Arise from the dead , and the Messiah will shine on you ! ”
CJB	Ephesians	5	15	Therefore , pay careful attention to how you conduct your life — live wisely , not unwisely .
CJB	Ephesians	5	16	Use your time well , for these are evil days .
CJB	Ephesians	5	17	So don ’ t be foolish , but try to understand what the will of the Lord is .
CJB	Ephesians	5	18	Don ’ t get drunk with wine , because it makes you lose control . Instead , keep on being filled with the Spirit —
CJB	Ephesians	5	19	sing psalms , hymns and spiritual songs to each other ; sing to the Lord and make music in your heart to him ;
CJB	Ephesians	5	20	always give thanks for everything to God the Father in the name of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah .
CJB	Ephesians	5	21	Submit to one another in fear of the Messiah .
CJB	Ephesians	5	22	Wives should submit to their husbands as they do to the Lord ;
CJB	Ephesians	5	23	because the husband is head of the wife , just as the Messiah , as head of the Messianic Community , is himself the one who keeps the body safe .
CJB	Ephesians	5	24	Just as the Messianic Community submits to the Messiah , so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything .
CJB	Ephesians	5	25	As for husbands , love your wives , just as the Messiah loved the Messianic Community , indeed , gave himself up on its behalf ,
CJB	Ephesians	5	26	in order to set it apart for God , making it clean through immersion in the mikveh , so to speak ,
CJB	Ephesians	5	27	in order to present the Messianic Community to himself as a bride to be proud of , without a spot , wrinkle or any such thing , but holy and without defect .
CJB	Ephesians	5	28	This is how husbands ought to love their wives — like their own bodies ; for the man who loves his wife is loving himself .
CJB	Ephesians	5	29	Why , no one ever hated his own flesh ! On the contrary , he feeds it well and takes care of it , just as the Messiah does the Messianic Community ,
CJB	Ephesians	5	30	because we are parts of his Body .
CJB	Ephesians	5	31	“ Therefore a man will leave his father and mother and remain with his wife , and the two will become one. ” [ a ]
CJB	Ephesians	5	32	There is profound truth hidden here , which I say concerns the Messiah and the Messianic Community .
CJB	Ephesians	5	33	However , the text also applies to each of you individually : let each man love his wife as he does himself , and see that the wife respects her husband . Footnotes - Ephesians 5:31 Genesis 2:24
CJB	Ephesians	6	6	Don ’ t obey just to win their favor , serving only when they are watching you ; but serve as slaves of the Messiah , doing what God wants with all your heart .
CJB	Ephesians	6	2	“ Honor your father and mother ” — this is the first commandment that embodies a promise —
CJB	Ephesians	6	3	“ so that it may go well with you , and you may live long in the Land. ” [ a ]
CJB	Ephesians	6	4	Fathers , don ’ t irritate your children and make them resentful ; instead , raise them with the Lord ’ s kind of discipline and guidance .
CJB	Ephesians	6	5	Slaves , obey your human masters with the same fear , trembling and single-heartedness with which you obey the Messiah .
CJB	Ephesians	6	7	Work willingly as slaves , as people do who are serving not merely human beings but the Lord .
CJB	Ephesians	6	8	Remember that whoever does good work , whether he be a slave or a free man , will be rewarded by the Lord .
CJB	Ephesians	6	9	And masters , treat your slaves the same way . Don ’ t threaten them . Remember that in heaven both you and they have the same Master , and he has no favorites .
CJB	Ephesians	6	10	Finally , grow powerful in union with the Lord , in union with his mighty strength !
CJB	Ephesians	6	11	Use all the armor and weaponry that God provides , so that you will be able to stand against the deceptive tactics of the Adversary .
CJB	Ephesians	6	12	For we are not struggling against human beings , but against the rulers , authorities and cosmic powers governing this darkness , against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realm .
CJB	Ephesians	6	13	So take up every piece of war equipment God provides ; so that when the evil day comes , you will be able to resist ; and when the battle is won , you will still be standing .
CJB	Ephesians	6	14	Therefore , stand ! Have the belt of truth buckled around your waist , [ b ] put on righteousness for a breastplate , [ c ]
CJB	Ephesians	6	15	and wear on your feet the readiness that comes from the Good News of shalom . [ d ]
CJB	Ephesians	6	16	Always carry the shield of trust , with which you will be able to extinguish all the flaming arrows of the Evil One .
CJB	Ephesians	6	17	And take the helmet of deliverance ; [ e ] along with the sword given by the Spirit , that is , the Word of God ;
CJB	Ephesians	6	18	as you pray at all times , with all kinds of prayers and requests , in the Spirit , vigilantly and persistently , for all God ’ s people .
CJB	Ephesians	6	19	And pray for me , too , that whenever I open my mouth , the words will be given to me to be bold in making known the secret of the Good News ,
CJB	Ephesians	6	20	for which I am an ambassador in chains . Pray that I may speak boldly , the way I should .
CJB	Ephesians	6	21	Now , so that you may also be informed about how I am and what I am doing , Tychicus , the dear brother and a faithful worker for the Lord , will tell you everything .
CJB	Ephesians	6	22	This is the very reason I have sent him to you , so that you may know how we are getting along and so that he may comfort and encourage you .
CJB	Ephesians	6	23	Shalom to the brothers . May God the Father and the Lord Yeshua the Messiah give you love and trust .
CJB	Ephesians	6	24	Grace be to all who love our Lord Yeshua the Messiah with undying love . Footnotes - Ephesians 6:3 Exodus 20:12 ; Deuteronomy 5:16 - Ephesians 6:14 Isaiah 11:5 - Ephesians 6:14 Isaiah 59:17 - Ephesians 6:15 Isaiah 52:7 - Ephesians 6:17 Isaiah 59:17
CJB	Philippians	1	1	From : Sha ’ ul and Timothy , slaves of the Messiah Yeshua To : All God ’ s people united with the Messiah Yeshua and living in Philippi , along with the congregation leaders and shammashim :
CJB	Philippians	1	2	Grace to you and shalom from God our Father and the Lord Yeshua the Messiah .
CJB	Philippians	1	3	I thank my God every time I think of you .
CJB	Philippians	1	4	Whenever I pray for all of you I always pray with joy ,
CJB	Philippians	1	5	because you have shared in proclaiming the Good News from the very first day until now .
CJB	Philippians	1	6	And I am sure of this : that the One who began a good work among you will keep it growing until it is completed on the Day of the Messiah Yeshua .
CJB	Philippians	1	7	It is right for me to think this way about you all , because I have you on my heart ; for whether I am in chains or defending and establishing the Good News , you are all sharing with me in this privileged work .
CJB	Philippians	1	8	God can testify how I long for all of you with the deep affection of the Messiah Yeshua .
CJB	Philippians	1	9	And this is my prayer : that your love may more and more overflow in fullness of knowledge and depth of discernment ,
CJB	Philippians	1	10	so that you will be able to determine what is best and thus be pure and without blame for the Day of the Messiah ,
CJB	Philippians	1	11	filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Yeshua the Messiah — to the glory and praise of God .
CJB	Philippians	1	12	Now , brothers , I want you to know that what has happened to me has helped in advancing the Good News .
CJB	Philippians	1	13	It has become clear to the whole palace and to everyone else that it is because of the Messiah that I am in chains .
CJB	Philippians	1	14	Also , my being in prison has given most of the brothers in the Lord confidence , so that they have become much more bold in speaking the word of God fearlessly .
CJB	Philippians	1	15	True , some are proclaiming the Messiah out of jealousy and rivalry , but others are doing it in goodwill .
CJB	Philippians	1	16	The latter act from love , aware that I am put where I am for defending the Good News ;
CJB	Philippians	1	17	while the former announce the Messiah out of selfish ambition , with impure motives , supposing they can stir up trouble for me in prison .
CJB	Philippians	1	18	But so what ? All that matters is that in every way , whether honestly or in pretense , the Messiah is being proclaimed ; and in that I rejoice . Yes , and I will continue to rejoice ,
CJB	Philippians	1	19	for I know that this will work out for my deliverance , [ a ] because of your prayers and the support I get from the Spirit of Yeshua the Messiah .
CJB	Philippians	1	20	It all accords with my earnest expectation and hope that I will have nothing to be ashamed of ; but rather , now , as always , the Messiah will be honored by my body , whether it is alive or dead .
CJB	Philippians	1	21	For to me , life is the Messiah , and death is gain .
CJB	Philippians	1	22	But if by living on in the body I can do fruitful work , then I don ’ t know which to choose .
CJB	Philippians	1	23	I am caught in a dilemma : my desire is to go off and be with the Messiah — that is better by far —
CJB	Philippians	1	24	but because of you , the greater need is to stay on in the body .
CJB	Philippians	1	25	Yes , I am convinced of this ; so I know I will stay on with you in order to help you progress in the faith and have joy in it .
CJB	Philippians	1	26	Then , through my being with you again , you will have even greater reason for boasting about the Messiah Yeshua .
CJB	Philippians	1	27	Only conduct your lives in a way worthy of the Good News of the Messiah ; so that whether I come and see you or I hear about you from a distance , you stand firm , united in spirit , fighting with one accord for the faith of the Good News ,
CJB	Philippians	1	28	not frightened by anything the opposition does . This will be for them an indication that they are headed for destruction and you for deliverance . And this is from God ;
CJB	Philippians	1	29	because for the Messiah ’ s sake it has been granted to you not only to trust in him but also to suffer on his behalf ,
CJB	Philippians	1	30	to fight the same battles you once saw me fight and now hear that I am still fighting . Footnotes - Philippians 1:19 Job 13:16
CJB	Philippians	2	2	then complete my joy by having a common purpose and a common love , by being one in heart and mind .
CJB	Philippians	2	3	Do nothing out of rivalry or vanity ; but , in humility , regard each other as better than yourselves —
CJB	Philippians	2	4	look out for each other ’ s interests and not just for your own .
CJB	Philippians	2	5	Let your attitude toward one another be governed by your being in union with the Messiah Yeshua :
CJB	Philippians	2	6	Though he was in the form of God , he did not regard equality with God something to be possessed by force .
CJB	Philippians	2	7	On the contrary , he emptied himself , in that he took the form of a slave by becoming like human beings are . And when he appeared as a human being ,
CJB	Philippians	2	8	he humbled himself still more by becoming obedient even to death — death on a stake as a criminal !
CJB	Philippians	2	9	Therefore God raised him to the highest place and gave him the name above every name ;
CJB	Philippians	2	10	that in honor of the name given Yeshua , every knee will bow — in heaven , on earth and under the earth —
CJB	Philippians	2	11	and every tongue will acknowledge [ a ] that Yeshua the Messiah is Adonai — to the glory of God the Father .
CJB	Philippians	2	12	So , my dear friends , just as you have always obeyed when I was with you , it is even more important that you obey now when I am away from you : keep working out your deliverance with fear and trembling , [ b ]
CJB	Philippians	2	13	for God is the one working among you both the willing and the working for what pleases him .
CJB	Philippians	2	14	Do everything without kvetching or arguing ,
CJB	Philippians	2	15	so that you may be blameless and pure children of God , without defect in the midst of a twisted and perverted generation , [ c ] among whom you shine like stars in the sky ,
CJB	Philippians	2	16	as you hold on to the Word of Life . If you do this , I will be able to boast , when the Day of the Messiah comes , that I did not run or toil for nothing .
CJB	Philippians	2	17	Indeed , even if my lifeblood is poured out as a drink offering over the sacrifice and service of your faith , I will still be glad and rejoice with you all .
CJB	Philippians	2	18	Likewise , you too should be glad and rejoice with me .
CJB	Philippians	2	19	But I hope in the Lord Yeshua to send Timothy to you shortly , so that I too may be cheered by knowing how you are doing .
CJB	Philippians	2	20	I have no one who compares with him , who will care so sincerely for your welfare —
CJB	Philippians	2	21	people all put their own interests ahead of the Messiah Yeshua ’ s .
CJB	Philippians	2	22	But you know his character , that like a child with his father he slaved with me to advance the Good News .
CJB	Philippians	2	23	So I hope to send him just as soon as I see how things will go with me ,
CJB	Philippians	2	24	and I am confident in the Lord that before long I myself will come too .
CJB	Philippians	2	25	Also I considered it necessary to send you Epaphroditus , my brother , fellow-worker and fellow-soldier , the emissary whom you sent to take care of my needs ;
CJB	Philippians	2	26	since he has been longing for you all and has been distressed because you heard he was ill.
CJB	Philippians	2	27	Indeed he was ill , close to death ; but God had mercy on him — and not only on him , but also on me — otherwise I would have had sorrow piled on sorrow .
CJB	Philippians	2	28	Therefore , I am all the more eager to send him , so that you may rejoice when you see him again ; and I , for my part , may be less sad .
CJB	Philippians	2	29	So give him a joyful welcome in the Lord ; honor such people .
CJB	Philippians	2	30	For he risked his life and nearly died working for the Messiah , in order to give me the help you were not in a position to give . Footnotes - Philippians 2:11 Isaiah 45:23 - Philippians 2:12 Psalm 2:11 - Philippians 2:15 Deuteronomy 32:5
CJB	Philippians	3	3	For it is we who are the Circumcised , we who worship by the Spirit of God and make our boast in the Messiah Yeshua ! We do not put confidence in human qualifications ,
CJB	Philippians	3	2	beware of the dogs , those evildoers , the Mutilated !
CJB	Philippians	3	4	even though I certainly have grounds for putting confidence in such things . If anyone else thinks he has grounds for putting confidence in human qualifications , I have better grounds : -
CJB	Philippians	3	5	b ’ rit-milah on the eighth day , - by birth belonging to the people of Isra ’ el , - from the tribe of Binyamin , - a Hebrew-speaker , with Hebrew-speaking parents , - in regard to the Torah , a Parush , -
CJB	Philippians	3	6	in regard to zeal , a persecutor of the Messianic Community , - in regard to the righteousness demanded by legalism , blameless .
CJB	Philippians	3	7	But the things that used to be advantages for me , I have , because of the Messiah , come to consider a disadvantage .
CJB	Philippians	3	8	Not only that , but I consider everything a disadvantage in comparison with the supreme value of knowing the Messiah Yeshua as my Lord . It was because of him that I gave up everything and regard it all as garbage , in order to gain the Messiah
CJB	Philippians	3	9	and be found in union with him , not having any righteousness of my own based on legalism , but having that righteousness which comes through the Messiah ’ s faithfulness , the righteousness from God based on trust .
CJB	Philippians	3	10	Yes , I gave it all up in order to know him , that is , to know the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings as I am being conformed to his death ,
CJB	Philippians	3	11	so that somehow I might arrive at being resurrected from the dead .
CJB	Philippians	3	12	It is not that I have already obtained it or already reached the goal — no , I keep pursuing it in the hope of taking hold of that for which the Messiah Yeshua took hold of me .
CJB	Philippians	3	13	Brothers , I , for my part , do not think of myself as having yet gotten hold of it ; but one thing I do : forgetting what is behind me and straining forward toward what lies ahead ,
CJB	Philippians	3	14	I keep pursuing the goal in order to win the prize offered by God ’ s upward calling in the Messiah Yeshua .
CJB	Philippians	3	15	Therefore , as many of us as are mature , let us keep paying attention to this ; and if you are differently minded about anything , God will also reveal this to you .
CJB	Philippians	3	16	Only let our conduct fit the level we have already reached .
CJB	Philippians	3	17	Brothers , join in imitating me , and pay attention to those who live according to the pattern we have set for you .
CJB	Philippians	3	18	For many — I have told you about them often before , and even now I say it with tears — live as enemies of the Messiah ’ s execution-stake .
CJB	Philippians	3	19	They are headed for destruction ! Their god is the belly ; they are proud of what they ought to be ashamed of , since they are concerned about the things of the world .
CJB	Philippians	3	20	But we are citizens of heaven , and it is from there that we expect a Deliverer , the Lord Yeshua the Messiah .
CJB	Philippians	3	21	He will change the bodies we have in this humble state and make them like his glorious body , using the power which enables him to bring everything under his control .
CJB	Philippians	4	4	Rejoice in union with the Lord always ! I will say it again : rejoice !
CJB	Philippians	4	2	I beg Evodia and I beg Syntyche to agree with each other in union with the Lord .
CJB	Philippians	4	3	I also request you , loyal Syzygus , to help these women ; for they have worked hard proclaiming the Good News with me , along with Clement and the rest of my fellow-workers whose names are in the Book of Life .
CJB	Philippians	4	5	Let everyone see how reasonable and gentle you are . The Lord is near !
CJB	Philippians	4	6	Don ’ t worry about anything ; on the contrary , make your requests known to God by prayer and petition , with thanksgiving .
CJB	Philippians	4	7	Then God ’ s shalom , passing all understanding , will keep your hearts and minds safe in union with the Messiah Yeshua .
CJB	Philippians	4	8	In conclusion , brothers , focus your thoughts on what is true , noble , righteous , pure , lovable or admirable , on some virtue or on something praiseworthy .
CJB	Philippians	4	9	Keep doing what you have learned and received from me , what you have heard and seen me doing ; then the God who gives shalom will be with you .
CJB	Philippians	4	10	In union with the Lord I greatly rejoice that now , after this long time , you have let your concern for me express itself again . Of course , you were concerned for me all along , but you had no opportunity to express it .
CJB	Philippians	4	11	Not that I am saying this to call attention to any need of mine ; since , as far as I am concerned , I have learned to be content regardless of circumstances .
CJB	Philippians	4	12	I know what it is to be in want , and I know what it is to have more than enough — in everything and in every way I have learned the secret of being full and being hungry , of having abundance and being in need .
CJB	Philippians	4	13	I can do all things through him who gives me power .
CJB	Philippians	4	14	Nevertheless , it was good of you to share in my trouble .
CJB	Philippians	4	15	And you Philippians yourselves know that in the early days of my work spreading the Good News , when I left Macedonia , not a single congregation shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving — only you .
CJB	Philippians	4	16	Indeed , in Thessalonica when I needed it , you sent me aid twice .
CJB	Philippians	4	17	I am not seeking the gift ; rather , I am looking for what will increase the credit balance of your account .
CJB	Philippians	4	18	I have been more than paid in full : I have been filled , since I have received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent — they are a fragrant aroma , [ a ] an acceptable sacrifice , one that pleases God well .
CJB	Philippians	4	19	Moreover , my God will fill every need of yours according to his glorious wealth , in union with the Messiah Yeshua .
CJB	Philippians	4	20	And to God our Father be the glory forever and ever . Amen .
CJB	Philippians	4	21	Greet each of God ’ s people in the Messiah Yeshua . The brothers with me send their greetings to you .
CJB	Philippians	4	22	All God ’ s people send greetings , but especially those in the Emperor ’ s household .
CJB	Philippians	4	23	The grace of the Lord Yeshua the Messiah be with your spirit . Footnotes - Philippians 4:18 Genesis 8:21 ; Exodus 29:18
CJB	Colossians	1	1	From : Sha ’ ul , by God ’ s will an emissary of the Messiah Yeshua , and brother Timothy
CJB	Colossians	1	2	To : God ’ s people in Colosse , faithful brothers in the Messiah : Grace to you and shalom from God our Father .
CJB	Colossians	1	3	Whenever we pray , we always give thanks for you to God , the Father of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah .
CJB	Colossians	1	4	For we have heard of your trust in the Messiah Yeshua and of the love you have for all God ’ s people .
CJB	Colossians	1	5	Both spring from the confident hope that you will receive what is stored up for you in heaven . You heard of this earlier in the message about the truth . This Good News
CJB	Colossians	1	6	has made its presence felt among you , just as it is also being fruitful and multiplying [ a ] throughout the world in the same way as it has among you since the day you heard and understood the grace of God as it really is .
CJB	Colossians	1	7	You learned it from Epaphras , our dear fellow-slave and a faithful worker for the Messiah on your behalf ;
CJB	Colossians	1	8	and he has told us about the love which the Spirit has given you .
CJB	Colossians	1	9	Therefore , from the day we heard of it , we have not stopped praying for you , asking God to fill you with the knowledge of his will in all the wisdom and understanding which the Spirit gives ;
CJB	Colossians	1	10	so that you may live lives worthy of the Lord and entirely pleasing to him , being fruitful in every good work and multiplying in the full knowledge of God .
CJB	Colossians	1	11	We pray that you will be continually strengthened with all the power that comes from his glorious might ; so that you will be able to persevere and be patient in any situation , joyfully
CJB	Colossians	1	12	giving thanks to the Father for having made you fit to share in the inheritance of his people in the light .
CJB	Colossians	1	13	He has rescued us from the domain of darkness and transferred us into the Kingdom of his dear Son .
CJB	Colossians	1	14	It is through his Son that we have redemption — that is , our sins have been forgiven .
CJB	Colossians	1	15	He is the visible image of the invisible God . He is supreme over all creation ,
CJB	Colossians	1	16	because in connection with him were created all things — in heaven and on earth , visible and invisible , whether thrones , lordships , rulers or authorities — they have all been created through him and for him .
CJB	Colossians	1	17	He existed before all things , and he holds everything together .
CJB	Colossians	1	18	Also he is head of the Body , the Messianic Community — he is the beginning , the firstborn from the dead , so that he might hold first place in everything .
CJB	Colossians	1	19	For it pleased God to have his full being live in his Son
CJB	Colossians	1	20	and through his Son to reconcile to himself all things , whether on earth or in heaven , making peace through him , through having his Son shed his blood by being executed on a stake .
CJB	Colossians	1	21	In other words , you , who at one time were separated from God and had a hostile attitude towards him because of your wicked deeds ,
CJB	Colossians	1	22	he has now reconciled in the Son ’ s physical body through his death ; in order to present you holy and without defect or reproach before himself —
CJB	Colossians	1	23	provided , of course , that you continue in your trusting , grounded and steady , and don ’ t let yourselves be moved away from the hope offered in the Good News you heard . This is the Good News that has been proclaimed in all creation under heaven ; and I , Sha ’ ul , have become a servant of it .
CJB	Colossians	1	24	I rejoice in my present sufferings on your behalf ! Yes , I am completing in my own flesh what has been lacking of the Messiah ’ s afflictions , on behalf of his Body , the Messianic Community .
CJB	Colossians	1	25	I became a servant of the Good News because God gave me this work to do for your benefit . The work is to make fully known the message from God ,
CJB	Colossians	1	26	the secret hidden for generations , for ages , but now made clear to the people he has set apart for himself .
CJB	Colossians	1	27	To them God wanted to make known how great among the Gentiles is the glorious richness of this secret . And the secret is this : the Messiah is united with you people ! In that rests your hope of glory !
CJB	Colossians	1	28	We , for our part , proclaim him ; we warn , confront and teach everyone in all wisdom ; so that we may present everyone as having reached the goal , united with the Messiah .
CJB	Colossians	1	29	It is for this that I toil , striving with all the energy that he stirs up in me so mightily . Footnotes - Colossians 1:6 Genesis 1:28
CJB	Colossians	2	2	My purpose is that they may be encouraged , that they may be joined together in love , and that they may have all the riches derived from being assured of understanding and fully knowing God ’ s secret truth , which is — the Messiah !
CJB	Colossians	2	3	It is in him that all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden .
CJB	Colossians	2	4	I say this so that no one will fool you with plausible but specious arguments .
CJB	Colossians	2	5	For although I am away from you physically , I am with you in spirit , rejoicing as I see the disciplined and resolute firmness of your trust in the Messiah .
CJB	Colossians	2	6	Therefore , just as you received the Messiah Yeshua as Lord , keep living your life united with him .
CJB	Colossians	2	7	Remain deeply rooted in him ; continue being built up in him and confirmed in your trust , the way you were taught , so that you overflow in thanksgiving .
CJB	Colossians	2	8	Watch out , so that no one will take you captive by means of philosophy and empty deceit , following human tradition which accords with the elemental spirits of the world but does not accord with the Messiah .
CJB	Colossians	2	9	For in him , bodily , lives the fullness of all that God is .
CJB	Colossians	2	10	And it is in union with him that you have been made full — he is the head of every rule and authority .
CJB	Colossians	2	11	Also it was in union with him that you were circumcised with a circumcision not done by human hands , but accomplished by stripping away the old nature ’ s control over the body . In this circumcision done by the Messiah ,
CJB	Colossians	2	12	you were buried along with him by being immersed ; and in union with him , you were also raised up along with him by God ’ s faithfulness that worked when he raised Yeshua from the dead .
CJB	Colossians	2	13	You were dead because of your sins , that is , because of your “ foreskin , ” your old nature . But God made you alive along with the Messiah by forgiving you all your sins .
CJB	Colossians	2	14	He wiped away the bill of charges against us . Because of the regulations , it stood as a testimony against us ; but he removed it by nailing it to the execution-stake .
CJB	Colossians	2	15	Stripping the rulers and authorities of their power , he made a public spectacle of them , triumphing over them by means of the stake .
CJB	Colossians	2	16	So don ’ t let anyone pass judgment on you in connection with eating and drinking , or in regard to a Jewish festival or Rosh-Hodesh or Shabbat .
CJB	Colossians	2	17	These are a shadow of things that are coming , but the body is of the Messiah .
CJB	Colossians	2	18	Don ’ t let anyone deny you the prize by insisting that you engage in self-mortification or angel-worship . Such people are always going on about some vision they have had , and they vainly puff themselves up by their worldly outlook .
CJB	Colossians	2	19	They fail to hold to the Head , from whom the whole Body , receiving supply and being held together by its joints and ligaments , grows as God makes it grow .
CJB	Colossians	2	20	If , along with the Messiah , you died to the elemental spirits of the world , then why , as if you still belonged to the world , are you letting yourselves be bothered by its rules ? —
CJB	Colossians	2	21	“ Don ’ t touch this ! ” “ Don ’ t eat that ! ” “ Don ’ t handle the other ! ”
CJB	Colossians	2	22	Such prohibitions are concerned with things meant to perish by being used [ not by being avoided ! ] , and they are based on man-made rules and teachings . [ a ]
CJB	Colossians	2	23	They do indeed have the outward appearance of wisdom , with their self-imposed religious observances , false humility and asceticism ; but they have no value at all in restraining people from indulging their old nature . Footnotes - Colossians 2:22 Isaiah 29:13
CJB	Colossians	3	3	For you have died , and your life is hidden with the Messiah in God .
CJB	Colossians	3	2	Focus your minds on the things above , not on things here on earth .
CJB	Colossians	3	4	When the Messiah , who is our life , appears , then you too will appear with him in glory !
CJB	Colossians	3	5	Therefore , put to death the earthly parts of your nature — sexual immorality , impurity , lust , evil desires and greed ( which is a form of idolatry ) ;
CJB	Colossians	3	6	for it is because of these things that God ’ s anger is coming on those who disobey him .
CJB	Colossians	3	7	True enough , you used to practice these things in the life you once lived ;
CJB	Colossians	3	8	but now , put them all away — anger , exasperation , meanness , slander and obscene talk .
CJB	Colossians	3	9	Never lie to one another ; because you have stripped away the old self , with its ways ,
CJB	Colossians	3	10	and have put on the new self , which is continually being renewed in fuller and fuller knowledge , closer and closer to the image of its Creator .
CJB	Colossians	3	11	The new self allows no room for discriminating between Gentile and Jew , circumcised and uncircumcised , foreigner , savage , slave , free man ; on the contrary , in all , the Messiah is everything .
CJB	Colossians	3	12	Therefore , as God ’ s chosen people , holy and dearly loved , clothe yourselves with feelings of compassion and with kindness , humility , gentleness and patience .
CJB	Colossians	3	13	Bear with one another ; if anyone has a complaint against someone else , forgive him . Indeed , just as the Lord has forgiven you , so you must forgive .
CJB	Colossians	3	14	Above all these , clothe yourselves with love , which binds everything together perfectly ;
CJB	Colossians	3	15	and let the shalom which comes from the Messiah be your heart ’ s decision-maker , for this is why you were called to be part of a single Body . And be thankful —
CJB	Colossians	3	16	let the Word of the Messiah , in all its richness , live in you , as you teach and counsel each other in all wisdom , and as you sing psalms , hymns and spiritual songs with gratitude to God in your hearts .
CJB	Colossians	3	17	That is , everything you do or say , do in the name of the Lord Yeshua , giving thanks through him to God the Father .
CJB	Colossians	3	18	Wives , subject yourselves to your husbands , as is appropriate in the Lord .
CJB	Colossians	3	19	Husbands , love your wives and don ’ t treat them harshly .
CJB	Colossians	3	20	Children , obey your parents in everything ; for this pleases the Lord .
CJB	Colossians	3	21	Fathers , don ’ t irritate your children and make them resentful , or they will become discouraged .
CJB	Colossians	3	22	Slaves , obey your human masters in everything , not serving only when they are watching you , to win their favor , but single-heartedly , fearing the Lord .
CJB	Colossians	3	23	Whatever work you do , put yourself into it , as those who are serving not merely other people , but the Lord .
CJB	Colossians	3	24	Remember that as your reward , you will receive the inheritance from the Lord . You are slaving for the Lord , for the Messiah .
CJB	Colossians	3	25	Don ’ t worry — whoever is doing wrong will be paid in kind for his wrong , and there is no favoritism shown . Footnotes - Colossians 3:1 Psalm 110:1
CJB	Colossians	4	4	And pray that I may speak , as I should , in a way that makes the message clear .
CJB	Colossians	4	2	Keep persisting in prayer , staying alert in it and being thankful .
CJB	Colossians	4	3	Include prayer for us , too , that God may open a door for us to proclaim the message about the secret of the Messiah — for that is why I am in prison .
CJB	Colossians	4	5	Behave wisely toward outsiders , making full use of every opportunity —
CJB	Colossians	4	6	let your conversation always be gracious and interesting , so that you will know how to respond to any particular individual .
CJB	Colossians	4	7	Our dear brother Tychicus , who is a faithful worker and fellow-slave in the Lord , will give you all the news about me .
CJB	Colossians	4	8	I have sent him to you for this very reason — so that you might know how we are , and so that he might encourage you .
CJB	Colossians	4	9	I have sent him with Onesimus , the dear and faithful brother , who is one of you ; they will tell you everything that has happened here .
CJB	Colossians	4	10	Aristarchus , my fellow prisoner , sends greetings , as does Mark , Bar-Nabba ’ s cousin , concerning whom you have received instructions — if he comes to you , welcome him .
CJB	Colossians	4	11	Yeshua , the one called Justus , also sends greetings . These three are among the Circumcised ; and among my fellow workers for the Kingdom of God , only they have turned out to be a comfort to me .
CJB	Colossians	4	12	Epaphras sends greetings ; he is one of you , a slave of the Messiah Yeshua who always agonizes in his prayer on your behalf , praying that you may stand firm , mature and fully confident , as you devote yourselves completely to God ’ s will .
CJB	Colossians	4	13	For I can testify to him that he works hard for you and for those in Laodicea and Hierapolis .
CJB	Colossians	4	14	Our dear friend Luke , the doctor , and Demas send you greetings .
CJB	Colossians	4	15	Give my greetings to the brothers in Laodicea , also to Nympha and the congregation that meets in her home .
CJB	Colossians	4	16	After this letter has been read to you , have it read also in the congregation of the Laodiceans ; and you , in turn , are to read the letter that will come from Laodicea .
CJB	Colossians	4	17	And tell Archippus , “ See that you complete the task you were given in the Lord. ”
CJB	Colossians	4	18	This greeting I , Sha ’ ul , write with my own hand . Remember my imprisonment ! Grace be with you !
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	1	1	From : Sha ’ ul , Sila and Timothy To : The Messianic Community of the Thessalonians , united with God the Father and the Lord Yeshua the Messiah : Grace to you and shalom .
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	1	2	We always thank God for all of you , regularly mentioning you in our prayers ,
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	1	3	calling to mind before God our Father what our Lord Yeshua the Messiah has brought about in you — how your trust produces action , your love hard work , and your hope perseverance .
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	1	4	We know , brothers , that God has loved and chosen you ;
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	1	5	that the Good News we brought did not become for you a matter only of words , but also one of power , the Ruach HaKodesh and total conviction — just as you know how we lived for your sakes when we were with you .
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	1	6	You , indeed , became imitators of us and of the Lord ; so that even though you were going through severe troubles , you received the Word with joy from the Ruach HaKodesh .
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	1	7	Thus you became a pattern for all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia ;
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	1	8	for the Lord ’ s message sounded forth from you not only in Macedonia and Achaia , but everywhere your trust toward God became known . The result is that we don ’ t need to say anything ;
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	1	9	since they themselves keep telling us about the welcome we received from you and how you turned to God from idols , to serve the true God , the one who is alive ,
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	1	10	and to wait for his Son Yeshua , whom he raised from the dead , to appear from heaven and rescue us from the impending fury of God ’ s judgment .
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	2	1	Thessalonians
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	2	2	On the contrary , although we had already suffered and been outraged in Philippi , as you know , we had the courage , united with our God , to tell you the Good News even under great pressure .
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	2	3	For the appeal we make does not flow from error or from impure motives , neither do we try to trick people .
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	2	4	Instead , since God has tested us and found us fit to be entrusted with Good News , this is how we speak : not to win favor with people but with God , who tests our hearts .
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	2	5	For , as you know , never did we employ flattering talk , nor did we put on a false front to mask greed — God is witness .
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	2	6	Nor did we seek human praise — either from you or from others .
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	2	7	As emissaries of the Messiah , we could have made our weight felt ; but instead , we were gentle when we were with you , like a mother feeding and caring for her children .
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	2	8	We were so devoted to you that we were glad to share with you not only God ’ s Good News but also our own lives , because you had become very dear to us .
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	2	9	For you remember , brothers , our toil and hardship , how we worked night and day not to put a burden on any of you while we were proclaiming God ’ s Good News to you .
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	2	10	You are witnesses , and so is God , of how holy , righteous and blameless our behavior was in the sight of you believers ;
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	2	11	for you know that we treated each one of you the way a father treats his children —
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	2	12	we encouraged you and comforted you and appealed to you to lead lives worthy of God , who calls you into his Kingdom and glory .
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	2	13	Another reason we regularly thank God is that when you heard the Word of God from us , you received it not merely as a human word , but as it truly is , God ’ s Word , which is at work in you believers .
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	2	14	For , brothers , you came to be imitators of God ’ s congregations in Y ’ hudah that are united with the Messiah Yeshua — you suffered the same things from your countrymen as they did from the Judeans who
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	2	15	both killed the Lord Yeshua and the prophets , and chased us out too . They are displeasing God and opposing all mankind
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	2	16	by trying to keep us from speaking to the Gentiles , so that they may be delivered . Their object seems to be always to make their sins as bad as possible ! But God ’ s fury will catch up with them in the end .
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	2	17	And as for us , brothers , when we were deprived of your company for a short time — in person , but not in thought — we missed you and tried hard to come and see you .
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	2	18	We wanted so much to come to you — I , Sha ’ ul , tried more than once — but the Adversary stopped us .
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	2	19	For when our Lord Yeshua returns , what will be our hope , our joy , our crown to boast about ? Won ’ t it be you ?
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	2	20	Yes , you are our glory and our joy !
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	3	1	Thessalonians
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	3	3	so that none of you would let these persecutions unsettle him . For you yourselves know that these are bound to come to us ;
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	3	2	and sent Timothy , our brother and God ’ s fellow worker for the Good News of the Messiah , to make you solid and encourage you in your trust ;
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	3	4	even when we were with you , we kept telling you in advance that we were about to be persecuted ; and indeed it has happened , as you know .
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	3	5	That is the reason why , after I could stand it no longer , I sent to find out about your trust . I was afraid that somehow the Tempter had tempted you , and our hard work had been wasted .
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	3	6	But now Timothy has come to us from you , bringing good news about your trust and love , and telling us that you remember us well and are always longing to see us , just as we long to see you .
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	3	7	Because of this , brothers , in spite of all our trouble and distress , we were comforted over you — because of your trust ;
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	3	8	so that now we are alive ; since you continue to stand fast , united with the Lord .
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	3	9	Indeed , how can we thank God enough for you or express to our God all the joy we feel because of you ?
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	3	10	Night and day we pray as hard as we can that we will be able to see you face to face and supply whatever shortcomings there may be in your trust .
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	3	11	May God our Father and our Lord Yeshua direct our way to you .
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	3	12	And as for you , may the Lord make you increase and overflow in love toward each other , indeed , toward everyone , just as we do toward you ;
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	3	13	so that he may give you the inner strength to be blameless , by reason of your holiness , when you stand before God our Father at the coming of our Lord Yeshua with all his angels .
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	4	1	Thessalonians
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	4	4	that each of you know how to manage his sexual impulses in a holy and honorable manner ,
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	4	2	For you know what instructions we gave you on the authority of the Lord Yeshua .
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	4	3	What God wants is that you be holy , that you keep away from sexual immorality ,
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	4	5	without giving in to lustful desires , like the pagans who don ’ t know God .
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	4	6	No one should wrong his brother in this matter or take advantage of him , because the Lord punishes all who do such things — as we have explained to you before at length .
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	4	7	For God did not call us to live an unclean life but a holy one .
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	4	8	Therefore , whoever rejects this teaching is rejecting not a man but God , indeed , the One who gives you the Ruach HaKodesh , which is his .
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	4	9	Concerning love for the brothers we do not need to write you , for you yourselves have been taught by God to love each other ;
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	4	10	and you do love all the brothers throughout Macedonia . But we urge you , brothers , to do it even more .
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	4	11	Also , make it your ambition to live quietly , to mind your own business and to earn your living by your own efforts — just as we told you .
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	4	12	Then your daily life will gain the respect of outsiders , and you will not be dependent on anyone .
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	4	13	Now , brothers , we want you to know the truth about those who have died ; otherwise , you might become sad the way other people
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	4	14	do who have nothing to hope for . For since we believe that Yeshua died and rose again , we also believe that in the same way God , through Yeshua , will take with him those who have died .
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	4	15	When we say this , we base it on the Lord ’ s own word : we who remain alive when the Lord comes will certainly not take precedence over those who have died .
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	4	16	For the Lord himself will come down from heaven with a rousing cry , with a call from one of the ruling angels , and with God ’ s shofar ; those who died united with the Messiah will be the first to rise ;
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	4	17	then we who are left still alive will be caught up with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air ; and thus we will always be with the Lord .
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	4	18	So encourage each other with these words .
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	5	1	Thessalonians 5:8 Isaiah 59:17
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	5	5	for you are all people who belong to the light , who belong to the day . We don ’ t belong to the night or to darkness ,
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	5	2	because you yourselves well know that the Day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night .
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	5	3	When people are saying , “ Everything is so peaceful and secure , ” then destruction will suddenly come upon them , the way labor pains come upon a pregnant woman , and there is no way they will escape .
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	5	4	But you , brothers , are not in the dark , so that the Day should take you by surprise like a thief ;
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	5	6	so let ’ s not be asleep , like the rest are ; on the contrary , let us stay alert and sober .
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	5	7	People who sleep , sleep at night ; and people who get drunk , get drunk at night .
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	5	8	But since we belong to the day , let us stay sober , putting on trust and love as a breastplate and the hope of being delivered as a helmet . [ a ]
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	5	9	For God has not intended that we should experience his fury , but that we should gain deliverance through our Lord Yeshua the Messiah ,
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	5	10	who died on our behalf so that whether we are alive or dead , we may live along with him .
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	5	11	Therefore , encourage each other , and build each other up — just as you are doing .
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	5	12	We ask you , brothers , to respect those who are working hard among you , those who are guiding you in the Lord and confronting you in order to help you change .
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	5	13	Treat them with the highest regard and love because of the work they are doing . Live at peace among yourselves ;
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	5	14	but we urge you , brothers , to confront those who are lazy , your aim being to help them change , to encourage the timid , to assist the weak , and to be patient with everyone .
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	5	15	See that no one repays evil for evil ; on the contrary , always try to do good to each other , indeed , to everyone .
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	5	16	Always be joyful .
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	5	17	Pray regularly .
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	5	18	In everything give thanks , for this is what God wants from you who are united with the Messiah Yeshua .
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	5	19	Don ’ t quench the Spirit ,
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	5	20	don ’ t despise inspired messages .
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	5	21	But do test everything — hold onto what is good ,
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	5	22	but keep away from every form of evil .
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	5	23	May the God of shalom make you completely holy — may your entire spirit , soul and body be kept blameless for the coming of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah .
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	5	24	The one calling you is faithful , and he will do it .
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	5	25	Brothers , keep praying for us .
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	5	26	Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss .
CJB	1%20Thessalonians	5	27	I charge you in the Lord to have this letter read to all the brothers .

CJB	2%20Thessalonians	1	3	We have to keep thanking God for you always , brothers , as is appropriate ; because your trust continues to grow greater , and the love you each have for one another continues to increase .
CJB	2%20Thessalonians	1	4	Therefore , we boast about you in the congregations of God because of your perseverance and trust in all the persecutions and troubles you are going through .
CJB	2%20Thessalonians	1	5	This is clear evidence that God ’ s judgment is just ; and as a result , you will be counted worthy of the Kingdom of God for which you are suffering .
CJB	2%20Thessalonians	1	6	For it is justice for God to pay back trouble to those who are troubling you ,
CJB	2%20Thessalonians	1	7	and to give rest along with us to you who are being troubled , when the Lord Yeshua is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels
CJB	2%20Thessalonians	1	8	in a fiery flame . Then he will punish those who don ’ t know God , [ a ] that is , those who don ’ t listen to the Good News of our Lord Yeshua and obey it .
CJB	2%20Thessalonians	1	9	They will suffer the just penalty of eternal destruction , far away from the face of the Lord and the glory of his might . [ b ]
CJB	2%20Thessalonians	1	10	On that Day , when he comes to be glorified by his holy people and admired by all who have trusted , you will be among them , because you trusted our witness to you .
CJB	2%20Thessalonians	1	11	With this in view , we always pray for you that our God may make you worthy of his calling and may fulfill by his power every good purpose of yours and every action stemming from your trust .
CJB	2%20Thessalonians	1	12	In this way , the name of our Lord Yeshua will be glorified in you , and you in him , in accordance with the grace of our God and the Lord Yeshua the Messiah . Footnotes -

CJB	2%20Thessalonians	2	9	When this man who avoids Torah comes , the Adversary will give him the power to work all kinds of false miracles , signs and wonders .
CJB	2%20Thessalonians	2	10	He will enable him to deceive , in all kinds of wicked ways , those who are headed for destruction because they would not receive the love of the truth that could have saved them .
CJB	2%20Thessalonians	2	11	This is why God is causing them to go astray , so that they will believe the Lie .
CJB	2%20Thessalonians	2	12	The result will be that all who have not believed the truth , but have taken their pleasure in wickedness , will be condemned .
CJB	2%20Thessalonians	2	13	But we have to keep thanking God for you always , brothers whom the Lord loves , because God chose you as firstfruits for deliverance by giving you the holiness that has its origin in the Spirit and the faithfulness that has its origin in the truth .
CJB	2%20Thessalonians	2	14	He called you to this through our Good News , so that you could have the glory of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah .
CJB	2%20Thessalonians	2	15	Therefore , brothers , stand firm ; and hold to the traditions you were taught by us , whether we spoke them or wrote them in a letter .
CJB	2%20Thessalonians	2	16	And may our Lord Yeshua the Messiah himself and God our Father , who has loved us and by his grace given us eternal comfort and a good hope ,
CJB	2%20Thessalonians	2	17	comfort your hearts and strengthen you in every good word and deed . Footnotes -
CJB	2%20Thessalonians	3	2	and that we may be rescued from wicked and evil people , for not everyone has trust .
CJB	2%20Thessalonians	3	3	But the Lord is worthy of trust ; he will make you firm and guard you from the Evil One .
CJB	2%20Thessalonians	3	4	Yes , united with the Lord we are confident about you , that you are doing the things we are telling you to do , and that you will keep on doing them .
CJB	2%20Thessalonians	3	5	May the Lord direct your hearts into God ’ s love and the perseverance which the Messiah gives .
CJB	2%20Thessalonians	3	6	Now , in the name of the Lord Yeshua the Messiah we command you , brothers , to stay away from any brother who is leading a life of idleness , a life not in keeping with the tradition you received from us .
CJB	2%20Thessalonians	3	7	For you yourselves know how you must imitate us , that we were not idle when we were among you .
CJB	2%20Thessalonians	3	8	We did not accept anyone ’ s food without paying ; on the contrary , we labored and toiled , day and night , working so as not to be a burden to any of you .
CJB	2%20Thessalonians	3	9	It was not that we hadn ’ t the right to be supported , but so that we could make ourselves an example to imitate .
CJB	2%20Thessalonians	3	10	For even when we were with you , we gave you this command : if someone won ’ t work , he shouldn ’ t eat !
CJB	2%20Thessalonians	3	11	We hear that some of you are leading a life of idleness — not busy working , just busybodies !
CJB	2%20Thessalonians	3	12	We command such people — and in union with the Lord Yeshua the Messiah we urge them — to settle down , get to work , and earn their own living .
CJB	2%20Thessalonians	3	13	And you brothers who are doing what is good , don ’ t slack off !
CJB	2%20Thessalonians	3	14	Furthermore , if anyone does not obey what we are saying in this letter , take note of him and have nothing to do with him , so that he will be ashamed .
CJB	2%20Thessalonians	3	15	But don ’ t consider him an enemy ; on the contrary , confront him as a brother and try to help him change .
CJB	2%20Thessalonians	3	16	Now may the Lord of shalom himself give you shalom always in all ways . The Lord be with all of you .
CJB	2%20Thessalonians	3	17	The greeting in my own handwriting : From Sha ’ ul . This is the mark of genuineness in every letter , this is what my handwriting looks like .
CJB	2%20Thessalonians	3	18	The grace of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah be with you all .
CJB	1%20Timothy	1	1	From : Sha ’ ul , an emissary of the Messiah Yeshua by command of God our deliverer and the Messiah Yeshua our hope ,
CJB	1%20Timothy	1	2	To : Timothy , a true son because of your trust : Grace , mercy and shalom from God the Father and the Messiah Yeshua our Lord .
CJB	1%20Timothy	1	3	As I counseled you when I was leaving for Macedonia , stay on in Ephesus , so that you may order certain people who are teaching a different doctrine to stop .
CJB	1%20Timothy	1	4	Have them stop devoting their attention to myths and never-ending genealogies ; these divert people to speculating instead of doing God ’ s work , which requires trust .
CJB	1%20Timothy	1	5	The purpose of this order is to promote love from a clean heart , from a good conscience and from sincere trust .
CJB	1%20Timothy	1	6	Some , by aiming amiss , have wandered off into fruitless discussion .
CJB	1%20Timothy	1	7	They want to be teachers of Torah , but they understand neither their own words nor the matters about which they make such emphatic pronouncements .
CJB	1%20Timothy	1	8	We know that the Torah is good , provided one uses it in the way the Torah itself intends .
CJB	1%20Timothy	1	9	We are aware that Torah is not for a person who is righteous , but for those who are heedless of Torah and rebellious , ungodly and sinful , wicked and worldly , for people who kill their fathers and mothers , for murderers ,
CJB	1%20Timothy	1	10	the sexually immoral — both heterosexual and homosexual — slave dealers , liars , perjurers , and anyone who acts contrary to the sound teaching
CJB	1%20Timothy	1	11	that accords with the Good News of the glorious and blessed God . This Good News was entrusted to me ;
CJB	1%20Timothy	1	12	and I thank the one who has given me strength , the Messiah Yeshua , our Lord , that he considered me trustworthy enough to put me in his service ,
CJB	1%20Timothy	1	13	even though I used to be a man who blasphemed and persecuted and was arrogant ! But I received mercy because I had acted in unbelief , not understanding what I was doing .
CJB	1%20Timothy	1	14	Our Lord ’ s grace overflowed to me with trust and love that come through the Messiah Yeshua .
CJB	1%20Timothy	1	15	So here is a statement you can trust , one that fully deserves to be accepted : the Messiah came into the world to save sinners , and I ’ m the number one sinner !
CJB	1%20Timothy	1	16	But this is precisely why I received mercy — so that in me , as the number one sinner , Yeshua the Messiah might demonstrate how very patient he is , as an example to those who would later come to trust in him and thereby have eternal life .
CJB	1%20Timothy	1	17	So to the King — eternal , imperishable and invisible , the only God there is — let there be honor and glory for ever and ever ! Amen .
CJB	1%20Timothy	1	18	This charge , son Timothy , I put to you , in keeping with the prophecies already made about you , so that by these prophecies you may fight the good fight ,
CJB	1%20Timothy	1	19	armed with trust and a good conscience . By rejecting conscience , some have made shipwreck of their trust ;
CJB	1%20Timothy	1	20	among them are Hymenaeus and Alexander . I have turned them over to the Adversary , so that they will learn not to insult God .
CJB	1%20Timothy	2	1	Timothy 2:5 Deuteronomy 6:4
CJB	1%20Timothy	2	2	including kings and all in positions of prominence ; so that we may lead quiet and peaceful lives , being godly and upright in everything .
CJB	1%20Timothy	2	3	This is what God , our Deliverer , regards as good ; this is what meets his approval .
CJB	1%20Timothy	2	4	He wants all humanity to be delivered and come to full knowledge of the truth .
CJB	1%20Timothy	2	5	For God is one ; [ a ] and there is but one Mediator between God and humanity , Yeshua the Messiah , himself human ,
CJB	1%20Timothy	2	6	who gave himself as a ransom on behalf of all , thus providing testimony to God ’ s purpose at just the right time .
CJB	1%20Timothy	2	7	This is why I myself was appointed a proclaimer , even an emissary — I am telling the truth , not lying ! — a trustworthy and truthful teacher of the Goyim .
CJB	1%20Timothy	2	8	Therefore , it is my wish that when the men pray , no matter where , they should lift up hands that are holy — they should not become angry or get into arguments .
CJB	1%20Timothy	2	9	Likewise , the women , when they pray , should be dressed modestly and sensibly in respectable attire , not with elaborate hairstyles and gold jewelry , or pearls , or expensive clothes .
CJB	1%20Timothy	2	10	Rather , they should adorn themselves with what is appropriate for women who claim to be worshipping God , namely , good deeds .
CJB	1%20Timothy	2	11	Let a woman learn in peace , fully submitted ;
CJB	1%20Timothy	2	12	but I do not permit a woman to teach a man or exercise authority over him ; rather , she is to remain at peace .
CJB	1%20Timothy	2	13	For Adam was formed first , then Havah .
CJB	1%20Timothy	2	14	Also it was not Adam who was deceived , but the woman who , on being deceived , became involved in the transgression .
CJB	1%20Timothy	2	15	Nevertheless , the woman will be delivered through childbearing , provided that she continues trusting , loving and living a holy life with modesty . Footnotes -
CJB	1%20Timothy	3	1	Timothy
CJB	1%20Timothy	3	3	He must not drink excessively or get into fights ; rather , he must be kind and gentle . He must not be a lover of money .
CJB	1%20Timothy	3	2	A congregation leader must be above reproach , he must be faithful to his wife , temperate , self-controlled , orderly , hospitable and able to teach .
CJB	1%20Timothy	3	4	He must manage his own household well , having children who obey him with all proper respect ;
CJB	1%20Timothy	3	5	for if a man can ’ t manage his own household , how will he be able to care for God ’ s Messianic Community ?
CJB	1%20Timothy	3	6	He must not be a new believer , because he might become puffed up with pride and thus fall under the same judgment as did the Adversary .
CJB	1%20Timothy	3	7	Furthermore , he must be well regarded by outsiders , so that he won ’ t fall into disgrace and into the Adversary ’ s trap .
CJB	1%20Timothy	3	8	Likewise , the shammashim must be of good character , people whose word can be trusted . They must not give themselves to excessive drinking or be greedy for dishonest gain .
CJB	1%20Timothy	3	9	They must possess the formerly hidden truth of the faith with a clean conscience .
CJB	1%20Timothy	3	10	And first , let them be tested ; then , if they prove themselves blameless , let them be appointed shammashim .
CJB	1%20Timothy	3	11	Similarly , the wives must be of good character , not gossips , but temperate , faithful in everything .
CJB	1%20Timothy	3	12	Let the shammashim each be faithful to his wife , managing his children and household well .
CJB	1%20Timothy	3	13	For those who serve well as shammashim gain good standing for themselves and much boldness in the trust that comes through Yeshua the Messiah .
CJB	1%20Timothy	3	14	I hope to visit you soon ; but I am writing these things
CJB	1%20Timothy	3	15	so that if I am delayed , you may know how one should behave in the household of God , which is the Messianic Community of the living God , the pillar and support of the truth .
CJB	1%20Timothy	3	16	Great beyond all question is the formerly hidden truth underlying our faith : He was manifested physically and proved righteous spiritually , seen by angels and proclaimed among the nations , trusted throughout the world and raised up in glory to heaven .
CJB	1%20Timothy	4	1	Timothy
CJB	1%20Timothy	4	4	For everything created by God is good , and nothing received with thanksgiving needs to be rejected ,
CJB	1%20Timothy	4	2	Such teachings come from the hypocrisy of liars whose own consciences have been burned , as if with a red-hot branding iron .
CJB	1%20Timothy	4	3	They forbid marriage and require abstinence from foods which God created to be eaten with thanksgiving by those who have come to trust and to know the truth .
CJB	1%20Timothy	4	5	because the word of God and prayer make it holy .
CJB	1%20Timothy	4	6	If you present all this to the brothers , you will be serving the Messiah Yeshua well ; it will show that you have digested the words of the faith and of the good teaching which you have followed .
CJB	1%20Timothy	4	7	But refuse godless bubbe-meises , and exercise yourself in godliness .
CJB	1%20Timothy	4	8	For although physical exercise does have some value , godliness is valuable for everything , since it holds promise both for the present life and for the life to come .
CJB	1%20Timothy	4	9	Here is a statement you can trust , one that fully deserves to be accepted
CJB	1%20Timothy	4	10	( indeed , it is for this that we toil and strive ) : we have our hope set on a living God who is the deliverer of all humanity , especially of those who trust .
CJB	1%20Timothy	4	11	Command these things and teach them .
CJB	1%20Timothy	4	12	Don ’ t let anyone look down on you because of your youth ; on the contrary , set the believers an example in your speech , behavior , love , trust and purity .
CJB	1%20Timothy	4	13	Until I come , pay attention to the public reading of the Scriptures .
CJB	1%20Timothy	4	14	Do not neglect your gift , which you were given through a prophecy when the body of elders gave you s ’ mikhah .
CJB	1%20Timothy	4	15	Be diligent about this work , throw yourself into it , so that your progress may be clear to everyone .
CJB	1%20Timothy	4	16	Pay attention to yourself and to the teaching , continue in it , for by so doing you will deliver both yourself and those who hear you .
CJB	1%20Timothy	5	1	Timothy 5:19 Deuteronomy 17:6 ; 19:15
CJB	1%20Timothy	5	5	Now the widow who is really in need , the one who has been left all alone , has set her hope on God and continues in petitions and prayers night and day .
CJB	1%20Timothy	5	2	older women like mothers and younger women like sisters , with absolute purity .
CJB	1%20Timothy	5	3	Show respect to widows who are really in need .
CJB	1%20Timothy	5	4	But if a widow has children or grandchildren , first let them learn to do their religious duty to their own family and thus repay some of the debt they owe their forebears , for this is what is acceptable in the sight of God .
CJB	1%20Timothy	5	6	But the one who is self-indulgent is already dead , even though she lives .
CJB	1%20Timothy	5	7	And instruct them about this , so that they will not be open to blame .
CJB	1%20Timothy	5	8	Moreover , anyone who does not provide for his own people , especially for his family , has disowned the faith and is worse than an unbeliever .
CJB	1%20Timothy	5	9	Let a widow be enrolled on the list of widows only if she is more than sixty years old , was faithful to her husband ,
CJB	1%20Timothy	5	10	and is known for her good deeds — as one who has reared her children well , showed hospitality , washed the feet of God ’ s people , helped those in trouble , and engaged in all kinds of good work .
CJB	1%20Timothy	5	11	But refuse to enroll younger widows , for when they begin to feel natural passions that alienate them from the Messiah , they want to get married .
CJB	1%20Timothy	5	12	This brings them under condemnation for having set aside the trust they had at first .
CJB	1%20Timothy	5	13	Besides that , they learn to be idle , going around from house to house ; and not only idle , but gossips and busybodies , saying things they shouldn ’ t .
CJB	1%20Timothy	5	14	Therefore , I would rather the young widows get married , have children and take charge of their homes , so as to give the opposition no occasion for slandering us .
CJB	1%20Timothy	5	15	For already some have turned astray to follow the Adversary .
CJB	1%20Timothy	5	16	If any believing woman has relatives who are widows , she should provide relief for them — the congregation shouldn ’ t be burdened , so that it may help the widows who are really in need .
CJB	1%20Timothy	5	17	The leaders who lead well should be considered worthy of double honor , especially those working hard at communicating the Word and at teaching .
CJB	1%20Timothy	5	18	For the Tanakh says , “ You are not to muzzle an ox when it is treading out the grain , ” [ a ] in other words , “ The worker deserves his wages. ”
CJB	1%20Timothy	5	19	Never listen to any accusation against a leader unless it is supported by two or three witnesses . [ b ]
CJB	1%20Timothy	5	20	Rebuke before the whole assembly those leaders who continue sinning , as a warning to the others .
CJB	1%20Timothy	5	21	Before God , the Messiah Yeshua and the chosen angels , I solemnly charge you to observe these instructions , not pre-judging and not doing anything out of favoritism .
CJB	1%20Timothy	5	22	Do not be hasty in granting s ’ mikhah to anyone , and do not share in other people ’ s sins — keep yourself pure .
CJB	1%20Timothy	5	23	Stop drinking water ; instead , use a little wine for the sake of your digestion and because of your frequent illnesses .
CJB	1%20Timothy	5	24	The sins of some people are obvious and go ahead of them to judgment , but the sins of others follow afterwards .
CJB	1%20Timothy	5	25	Likewise , good deeds are obvious ; and even when they are not , they can ’ t stay hidden . Footnotes -
CJB	1%20Timothy	6	1	Timothy
CJB	1%20Timothy	6	6	Now true religion does bring great riches , but only to those who are content with what they have .
CJB	1%20Timothy	6	2	And those who have believing masters are not to show them less respect on the ground that they are brothers ; on the contrary , they should serve all the more diligently , since those benefiting from their service are believers whom they love . Teach and exhort people about these things .
CJB	1%20Timothy	6	3	If anyone teaches differently and does not agree to the sound precepts of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah and to the doctrine that is in keeping with godliness ,
CJB	1%20Timothy	6	4	he is swollen with conceit and understands nothing . Instead , he has a morbid desire for controversies and word-battles , out of which come jealousy , dissension , insults , evil suspicions ,
CJB	1%20Timothy	6	5	and constant wrangling among people whose minds no longer function properly and who have been deprived of the truth , so that they imagine that religion is a road to riches .
CJB	1%20Timothy	6	7	For we have brought nothing into the world ; and we can take nothing out of it ;
CJB	1%20Timothy	6	8	so if we have food and clothing , we will be satisfied with these .
CJB	1%20Timothy	6	9	Furthermore , those whose goal is to be rich fall into temptation ; they get trapped in many foolish and hurtful ambitions which plunge them into ruin and destruction .
CJB	1%20Timothy	6	10	For the love of money is a root of all the evils ; because of this craving , some people have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves to the heart with many pains .
CJB	1%20Timothy	6	11	But you , as a man of God , flee from these things ; and pursue righteousness , godliness , faithfulness , love , steadfastness , gentleness .
CJB	1%20Timothy	6	12	Fight the good fight of the faith , take hold of the eternal life to which you were called when you testified so well to your faith before many witnesses .
CJB	1%20Timothy	6	13	I charge you before God , who gives life to all things , and before the Messiah Yeshua , who in his witness to Pontius Pilate gave the same good testimony ,
CJB	1%20Timothy	6	14	to obey your commission spotlessly and irreproachably until our Lord Yeshua the Messiah appears .
CJB	1%20Timothy	6	15	His appearing will be brought about in its own time by the blessed and sole Sovereign , who is King of kings and Lord of lords ,
CJB	1%20Timothy	6	16	who alone is immortal , who dwells in unapproachable light that no human being has ever seen or can see — to him be honor and eternal power . Amen .
CJB	1%20Timothy	6	17	As for those who do have riches in this present world , charge them not to be proud and not to let their hopes rest on the uncertainties of riches but to rest their hopes on God , who richly provides us with all things for our enjoyment .
CJB	1%20Timothy	6	18	Charge them to do good , to be rich in good deeds , to be generous and ready to share .
CJB	1%20Timothy	6	19	In this way they will treasure up for themselves a good foundation for the future , so that they may lay hold of the real life .
CJB	1%20Timothy	6	20	Oh , Timothy ! Keep safe what has been entrusted to you . Turn away from the ungodly babblings and the argumentative opposition of what is falsely called “ knowledge. ”
CJB	1%20Timothy	6	21	For many who promise this “ knowledge ” have missed the mark , as far as the faith is concerned . Grace be with you .
CJB	2%20Timothy	1	2	To : Timothy , my dear son : Grace , mercy and shalom from God the Father and the Messiah Yeshua , our Lord .
CJB	2%20Timothy	1	1	From : Sha ’ ul , an emissary of the Messiah Yeshua by God ’ s will , which holds forth a promise of life through being united with Messiah Yeshua
CJB	2%20Timothy	1	3	I give thanks to God , whom , like my forbears , I worship with a clean conscience , as I regularly remember you in my prayers night and day .
CJB	2%20Timothy	1	4	I am reminded of your tears , and I long to see you , so that I might be filled with joy .
CJB	2%20Timothy	1	5	I recall your sincere trust , the same trust that your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice had first ; and I am convinced that you too now have this trust .
CJB	2%20Timothy	1	6	For this reason , I am reminding you to fan the flame of God ’ s gift , which you received through s ’ mikhah from me .
CJB	2%20Timothy	1	7	For God gave us a Spirit who produces not timidity , but power , love and self-discipline .
CJB	2%20Timothy	1	8	So don ’ t be ashamed of bearing testimony to our Lord or to me , his prisoner . On the contrary , accept your share in suffering disgrace for the sake of the Good News . God will give you the strength for it ,
CJB	2%20Timothy	1	9	since he delivered us and called us to a life of holiness as his people . It was not because of our deeds , but because of his own purpose and the grace which he gave to us who are united with the Messiah Yeshua . He did this before the beginning of time ,
CJB	2%20Timothy	1	10	but made it public only now through the appearing of our Deliverer , the Messiah Yeshua , who abolished death and , through the Good News , revealed life and immortality .
CJB	2%20Timothy	1	11	It was for this Good News that I was appointed a proclaimer , emissary and teacher of the Goyim ;
CJB	2%20Timothy	1	12	and this is why I suffer as I do . But I am not ashamed , because I know him in whom I have put my trust , and I am persuaded that he can keep safe until that Day what he has entrusted to me .
CJB	2%20Timothy	1	13	Follow the pattern of the sound teachings you have heard from me , with trust and the love which is yours in the Messiah Yeshua .
CJB	2%20Timothy	1	14	Keep safe the great treasure that has been entrusted to you , with the help of the Ruach HaKodesh , who lives in us .
CJB	2%20Timothy	1	15	You know that everyone in the province of Asia turned away from me , including Phygelus and Ermogenes .
CJB	2%20Timothy	1	16	May the Lord show mercy to the household of Onesiphorus , because he was often a comfort to me and was not ashamed of my being in prison .
CJB	2%20Timothy	1	17	On the contrary , when he came to Rome , he diligently searched for me and found me .
CJB	2%20Timothy	1	18	May the Lord grant it to him to find mercy from Adonai on that Day . And you know very well how much he helped me in Ephesus .
CJB	2%20Timothy	2	2	Timothy 2:19 Numbers 16:26
CJB	2%20Timothy	2	3	Accept your share in suffering disgrace as a good soldier of the Messiah Yeshua .
CJB	2%20Timothy	2	4	No soldier on duty gets involved with civilian affairs , since he has to please his commanding officer .
CJB	2%20Timothy	2	5	Also an athlete can ’ t win a contest unless he competes according to the rules .
CJB	2%20Timothy	2	6	The farmer who has done the hard work should be the first to receive a share of the harvest .
CJB	2%20Timothy	2	7	Think about what I am saying , for the Lord will enable you to understand everything .
CJB	2%20Timothy	2	8	Remember Yeshua the Messiah , who was raised from the dead , who was a descendant of David . This is the Good News I proclaim ,
CJB	2%20Timothy	2	9	and for which I am suffering to the point of being bound in chains — but the Word of God is not bound in chains !
CJB	2%20Timothy	2	10	Why do I persevere through it all ? For the sake of those who have been chosen , so that they too may obtain the deliverance that comes through the Messiah Yeshua , with eternal glory .
CJB	2%20Timothy	2	11	Here is a statement you can trust : If we have died with him , we will also live with him .
CJB	2%20Timothy	2	12	If we persevere , we will also rule with him If we disown him , he will also disown us .
CJB	2%20Timothy	2	13	If we are faithless , he remains faithful , for he can not disown himself .
CJB	2%20Timothy	2	14	Keep reminding people of this , and charge them solemnly before the Lord not to engage in word-battles . They accomplish nothing useful and are a catastrophe for the hearers !
CJB	2%20Timothy	2	15	Do all you can to present yourself to God as someone worthy of his approval , as a worker with no need to be ashamed , because he deals straightforwardly with the Word of the Truth .
CJB	2%20Timothy	2	16	But keep away from godless babbling , for those who engage in it will only become more ungodly ,
CJB	2%20Timothy	2	17	and their teaching will eat away at people like gangrene . Hymenaeus and Philetus are among these ;
CJB	2%20Timothy	2	18	they have missed the mark , as far as the truth is concerned , by saying that our resurrection has already taken place ; and they are overturning some people ’ s faith .
CJB	2%20Timothy	2	19	Nevertheless , God ’ s firm foundation stands , stamped with these words : “ The Lord knows his own , ” [ a ] and , “ Let everyone who claims he belongs to the Lord stand apart from wrongdoing. ” [ b ]
CJB	2%20Timothy	2	20	In a large house there are dishes and pots not only of gold and silver , but also of wood and clay . That is , some are meant for honorable use and some for dishonorable .
CJB	2%20Timothy	2	21	If a person keeps himself free of defilement by the latter , he will be a vessel set aside for honorable use by the master of the house and ready for every kind of good work .
CJB	2%20Timothy	2	22	So , flee the passions of youth ; and , along with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart , pursue righteousness , faithfulness , love and peace .
CJB	2%20Timothy	2	23	But stay away from stupid and ignorant controversies — you know that they lead to fights ,
CJB	2%20Timothy	2	24	and a slave of the Lord shouldn ’ t fight . On the contrary , he should be kind to everyone , a good teacher , and not resentful when mistreated .
CJB	2%20Timothy	2	25	Also he should be gentle as he corrects his opponents . For God may perhaps grant them the opportunity to turn from their sins , acquire full knowledge of the truth ,
CJB	2%20Timothy	2	26	come to their senses and escape the trap of the Adversary , after having been captured alive by him to do his will . Footnotes -

CJB	2%20Timothy	3	4	traitorous , headstrong , swollen with conceit , loving pleasure rather than God ,
CJB	2%20Timothy	3	5	as they retain the outer form of religion but deny its power . Stay away from these people !
CJB	2%20Timothy	3	6	For some of them worm their way into homes and get control of weak-willed women who are heaped with sins and swayed by various impulses ,

CJB	2%20Timothy	3	8	In the same way as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moshe , so also these people oppose the truth . They are people with corrupted minds , whose trust can not pass the test .
CJB	2%20Timothy	3	9	However , they won ’ t get very far ; because everyone will see how stupid they are , just as happened with those two .
CJB	2%20Timothy	3	10	But you , you have closely followed my teaching , conduct , purpose in life , trust , steadfastness , love and perseverance —
CJB	2%20Timothy	3	11	as well as the persecutions and sufferings that came my way in Antioch , Iconium and Lystra . What persecutions I endured ! Yet the Lord rescued me from all of them .
CJB	2%20Timothy	3	12	And indeed , all who want to live a godly life united with the Messiah Yeshua will be persecuted ,
CJB	2%20Timothy	3	13	while evil people and impostors will go from bad to worse , deceiving others and being deceived themselves .
CJB	2%20Timothy	3	14	But you , continue in what you have learned and have become convinced of , recalling the people from whom you learned it ;
CJB	2%20Timothy	3	15	and recalling too how from childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures , which can give you the wisdom that leads to deliverance through trusting in Yeshua the Messiah .
CJB	2%20Timothy	3	16	All Scripture is God-breathed and is valuable for teaching the truth , convicting of sin , correcting faults and training in right living ;

CJB	2%20Timothy	4	4	Yes , they will stop listening to the truth , but will turn aside to follow myths .
CJB	2%20Timothy	4	3	For the time is coming when people will not have patience for sound teaching , but will cater to their passions and gather around themselves teachers who say whatever their ears itch to hear .
CJB	2%20Timothy	4	5	But you , remain steady in every situation , endure suffering , do the work that a proclaimer of the Good News should , and do everything your service to God requires .
CJB	2%20Timothy	4	6	For as for me , I am already being poured out on the altar ; yes , the time for my departure has arrived .
CJB	2%20Timothy	4	7	I have fought the good fight , I have finished the race , I have kept the faith .
CJB	2%20Timothy	4	8	All that awaits me now is the crown of righteousness which the Lord , “ the Righteous Judge , ” will award to me on that Day — and not only to me , but also to all who have longed for him to appear .

CJB	Titus	1	1	From : Sha ’ ul , God ’ s slave and an emissary of Yeshua the Messiah , sent to promote among God ’ s chosen people the trust and knowledge of truth which lead to godliness
CJB	Titus	1	2	and which are based on the certain hope of eternal life . God , who does not lie , promised that life before the beginning of time
CJB	Titus	1	3	but made public this word of his in its own season through a proclamation with which I have been entrusted by order of God , our Deliverer .
CJB	Titus	1	4	To : Titus , a true son in the faith we share : Grace and shalom from God the Father and from the Messiah Yeshua , our Deliverer .
CJB	Titus	1	5	The reason I left you in Crete was so that you might attend to the matters still not in order and appoint congregation leaders in each city — those were my instructions .
CJB	Titus	1	6	A leader must be blameless , husband to one wife , with believing children who do not have a reputation for being wild or rebellious .
CJB	Titus	1	7	For an overseer , as someone entrusted with God ’ s affairs , must be blameless — he must not be self-willed or quick-tempered , he must not drink excessively , get into fights or be greedy for dishonest gain .
CJB	Titus	1	8	On the contrary , he must be hospitable , devoted to good , sober-mindedness , uprightness , holiness and self-control .
CJB	Titus	1	9	He must hold firmly to the trustworthy Message that agrees with the doctrine ; so that by his sound teaching he will be able to exhort and encourage , and also to refute those who speak against it .
CJB	Titus	1	10	For there are many , especially from the Circumcision faction , who are rebellious , who delude people ’ s minds with their worthless and misleading talk .
CJB	Titus	1	11	They must be silenced ; because they are upsetting entire households by teaching what they have no business teaching , and doing it for the sake of dishonest gain .
CJB	Titus	1	12	Even one of the Cretans ’ own prophets has said , “ Cretans are always liars , evil brutes , lazy gluttons ” —
CJB	Titus	1	13	and it ’ s true ! For this reason , you must be severe when you rebuke those who have followed this false teaching , so that they will come to be sound in their trust
CJB	Titus	1	14	and no longer pay attention to Judaistic myths or to the commands of people who reject the truth .
CJB	Titus	1	15	To all who are themselves pure , everything is pure . But to those who are defiled and without trust , nothing is pure — even their minds and consciences have been defiled .
CJB	Titus	1	16	They claim to know God , but with their actions they deny him . They are detestable and disobedient ; they have proved themselves unfit to do anything good .
CJB	Titus	2	2	Tell the older men to be serious , sensible , self-controlled and sound in their trust , love and perseverance .
CJB	Titus	2	3	Likewise , tell the older women to behave the way people leading a holy life should . They shouldn ’ t be slanderers or slaves to excessive drinking . They should teach what is good ,
CJB	Titus	2	4	thus training the younger women to love their husbands and children ,
CJB	Titus	2	5	to be self-controlled and pure , to take good care of their homes and submit to their husbands . In this way , God ’ s message will not be brought into disgrace .
CJB	Titus	2	6	Similarly , urge the young men to be self-controlled ,
CJB	Titus	2	7	and in everything set them an example yourself by doing what is good . When you are teaching , have integrity and be serious ;
CJB	Titus	2	8	let everything you say be so wholesome that an opponent will be put to shame because he will have nothing bad to say about us .
CJB	Titus	2	9	Tell slaves to submit to their masters in everything , to give satisfaction without talking back
CJB	Titus	2	10	or pilfering . On the contrary , they should demonstrate complete faithfulness always , so that in every way they will make the teaching about God our Deliverer more attractive .
CJB	Titus	2	11	For God ’ s grace , which brings deliverance , has appeared to all people .
CJB	Titus	2	12	It teaches us to renounce godlessness and worldly pleasures , and to live self-controlled , upright and godly lives now , in this age ;
CJB	Titus	2	13	while continuing to expect the blessed fulfillment of our certain hope , which is the appearing of the Sh ’ khinah of our great God and the appearing of our Deliverer , Yeshua the Messiah .
CJB	Titus	2	14	He gave himself up on our behalf in order to free us from all violation of Torah and purify for himself a people who would be his own , eager to do good .
CJB	Titus	2	15	These are the things you should say . Encourage and rebuke with full authority ; don ’ t let anyone look down on you .
CJB	Titus	3	3	For at one time , we too were foolish and disobedient , deceived and enslaved by a variety of passions and pleasures . We spent our lives in evil and envy ; people hated us , and we hated each other .
CJB	Titus	3	2	to slander no one , to avoid quarrelling , to be friendly , and to behave gently towards everyone .
CJB	Titus	3	4	But when the kindness and love for mankind of God our Deliverer was revealed ,
CJB	Titus	3	5	he delivered us . It was not on the ground of any righteous deeds we had done , but on the ground of his own mercy . He did it by means of the mikveh of rebirth and the renewal brought about by the Ruach HaKodesh ,
CJB	Titus	3	6	whom he poured out on us generously through Yeshua the Messiah , our Deliverer .
CJB	Titus	3	7	He did it so that by his grace we might come to be considered righteous by God and become heirs , with the certain hope of eternal life .
CJB	Titus	3	8	You can trust what I have just said , and I want you to speak with confidence about these things , so that those who have put their trust in God may apply themselves to doing good deeds . These are both good in themselves and valuable to the community .
CJB	Titus	3	9	But avoid stupid controversies , genealogies , quarrels and fights about the Torah ; because they are worthless and futile .
CJB	Titus	3	10	Warn a divisive person once , then a second time ; and after that , have nothing more to do with him .
CJB	Titus	3	11	You may be sure that such a person has been perverted and is sinning : he stands self-condemned .
CJB	Titus	3	12	When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you . Do your best to come to me in Nicopolis , for I have decided to spend the winter there .
CJB	Titus	3	13	Do your best to help Zenas the Torah expert and Apollos with their arrangements for travelling , so that they will lack nothing .
CJB	Titus	3	14	And have our people learn to apply themselves to doing good deeds that meet genuine needs , so that they will not be unproductive .
CJB	Titus	3	15	All who are with me send you greetings . Give our greetings to our friends in the faith . Grace be with you all .
CJB	Philemon	1	1	From : Sha ’ ul , a prisoner for the sake of the Messiah Yeshua , and brother Timothy To : Our dear fellow-worker Philemon ,
CJB	Philemon	1	2	along with sister Apphia , our fellow-soldier Archippus and the congregation that gathers in your home :
CJB	Philemon	1	3	Grace and shalom to you from God our Father and the Lord Yeshua the Messiah .
CJB	Philemon	1	4	I thank my God every time I mention you in my prayers , Philemon ,
CJB	Philemon	1	5	for I am hearing about your love and commitment to the Lord Yeshua and to all God ’ s people .
CJB	Philemon	1	6	I pray that the fellowship based on your commitment will produce full understanding of every good thing that is ours in union with the Messiah .
CJB	Philemon	1	7	For your love has given me much joy and encouragement . Brother , you have refreshed the hearts of God ’ s people .
CJB	Philemon	1	8	Therefore , I would not hesitate , in union with the Messiah , to direct you to do the thing you ought to do .
CJB	Philemon	1	9	But since I Sha ’ ul , am the kind of person I am , an old man and now for the Messiah Yeshua ’ s sake a prisoner besides , I prefer to appeal to you on the basis of love .
CJB	Philemon	1	10	My request to you concerns my son , of whom I became the father while here in prison , Onesimus .
CJB	Philemon	1	11	His name means “ useful , ” and although he was once useless to you , he has now become most useful — not only to you but also to me ;
CJB	Philemon	1	12	so that in returning him to you I am sending a part of my very heart .
CJB	Philemon	1	13	I would dearly have loved to keep him with me , in order for him to serve me in your place while I am in prison because of the Good News .
CJB	Philemon	1	14	But I didn ’ t want to do anything without your consent , so that the good you do for me may be voluntary and not forced .
CJB	Philemon	1	15	Perhaps the reason he was separated from you for a brief period was so that you could have him back forever ,
CJB	Philemon	1	16	no longer as a slave but as more than a slave , as a dear brother . And that he is , especially to me . But how much dearer he must be to you , both humanly and in union with the Lord !
CJB	Philemon	1	17	So if you are in fellowship with me , receive him as you would me .
CJB	Philemon	1	18	And if he has wronged you in any way or owes you anything , charge it to me .
CJB	Philemon	1	19	I , Sha ’ ul , write with my own hand . I will repay it . ( I won ’ t mention , of course , that you owe me your very life . )
CJB	Philemon	1	20	Yes , brother , please do me this favor in the Lord ; refresh my heart in the Messiah .
CJB	Philemon	1	21	Trusting that you will respond positively , I write knowing that you will indeed do more than I am asking .
CJB	Philemon	1	22	One more thing : please get a room ready for me . For I hope that through the prayers of you all God will give me a chance to visit you .
CJB	Philemon	1	23	Epaphras , my fellow-prisoner for the sake of the Messiah Yeshua , sends greetings to you ,
CJB	Philemon	1	24	as do Mark , Aristarchus , Demas and Luke , my fellow-workers .
CJB	Philemon	1	25	The grace of the Lord Yeshua the Messiah be with your spirit .
CJB	Hebrews	1	1	Chronicles 17:13 - Hebrews 1:6 Psalm 97:7 - Hebrews 1:7 Psalm 104:4 - Hebrews 1:9 Psalm 45:7–8 ( 6–7 ) - Hebrews 1:12 Psalm 102:26–28 ( 25–27 ) - Hebrews 1:13 Psalm 110:1
CJB	Hebrews	1	2	Samuel 7:14 ;
CJB	Hebrews	1	3	This Son is the radiance of the Sh ’ khinah , the very expression of God ’ s essence , upholding all that exists by his powerful word ; and after he had , through himself , made purification for sins , he sat down at the right hand of HaG ’ dulah BaM ’ romim . [ a ]
CJB	Hebrews	1	4	So he has become much better than angels , and the name God has given him is superior to theirs .
CJB	Hebrews	1	5	For to which of the angels did God ever say , “ You are my Son ; today I have become your Father ” ? [ b ] Also , God never said of any angel , “ I will be his Father , and he will be my Son. ” [ c ]
CJB	Hebrews	1	6	And again , when God brings his Firstborn into the world , he says , “ Let all God ’ s angels worship him. ” [ d ]
CJB	Hebrews	1	7	Indeed , when speaking of angels , he says , “ . . . who makes his angels winds and his servants fiery flames ” ; [ e ]
CJB	Hebrews	1	8	but to the Son , he says , “ Your throne , O God , will last forever and ever ; you rule your Kingdom with a scepter of equity ;
CJB	Hebrews	1	9	you have loved righteousness and hated wickedness . Therefore , O God , your God has anointed you with the oil of joy in preference to your companions ” ; [ f ]
CJB	Hebrews	1	10	and , “ In the beginning , Lord , you laid the foundations of the earth ; heaven is the work of your hands .
CJB	Hebrews	1	11	They will vanish , but you will remain ; like clothing , they will all grow old ;
CJB	Hebrews	1	12	and you will fold them up like a coat . Yes , they will be changed like clothing , but you remain the same , your years will never end. ” [ g ]
CJB	Hebrews	1	13	Moreover , to which of the angels has he ever said , “ Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet ” ? [ h ]
CJB	Hebrews	1	14	Aren ’ t they all merely spirits who serve , sent out to help those whom God will deliver ? Footnotes - Hebrews 1:3 Psalm 110:1 - Hebrews 1:5 Psalm 2:7 - Hebrews 1:5
CJB	Hebrews	2	2	For if the word God spoke through angels became binding , so that every violation and act of disobedience received its just deserts in full measure ,
CJB	Hebrews	2	3	then how will we escape if we ignore such a great deliverance ? This deliverance , which was first declared by the Lord , was confirmed to us by those who heard him ;
CJB	Hebrews	2	4	while God also bore witness to it with various signs , wonders and miracles , and with gifts of the Ruach HaKodesh which he distributed as he chose .
CJB	Hebrews	2	5	For it was not to angels that God subjected the ‘ olam haba — which is what we are talking about .
CJB	Hebrews	2	6	And there is a place where someone has given this solemn testimony : “ What is mere man , that you concern yourself with him ? or the son of man , that you watch over him with such care ?
CJB	Hebrews	2	7	You made him a little lower than the angels , you crowned him with glory and honor ,
CJB	Hebrews	2	8	you put everything in subjection under his feet. ” [ a ] In subjecting everything to him , he left nothing unsubjected to him . However , at present , we don ’ t see everything subjected to him — at least , not yet .
CJB	Hebrews	2	9	But we do see Yeshua — who indeed was made for a little while lower than the angels — now crowned with glory and honor because he suffered death , so that by God ’ s grace he might taste death for all humanity .
CJB	Hebrews	2	10	For in bringing many sons to glory , it was only fitting that God , the Creator and Preserver of everything , should bring the Initiator of their deliverance to the goal through sufferings .
CJB	Hebrews	2	11	For both Yeshua , who sets people apart for God , and the ones being set apart have a common origin — this is why he is not ashamed to call them brothers
CJB	Hebrews	2	12	when he says , “ I will proclaim your name to my brothers ; in the midst of the congregation I will sing your praise. ” [ b ]
CJB	Hebrews	2	13	Also , “ I will put my trust in him , . . . ” [ c ] and then it goes on , “ Here I am , along with the children God has given me. ” [ d ]
CJB	Hebrews	2	14	Therefore , since the children share a common physical nature as human beings , he became like them and shared that same human nature ; so that by his death he might render ineffective the one who had power over death ( that is , the Adversary )
CJB	Hebrews	2	15	and thus set free those who had been in bondage all their lives because of their fear of death .
CJB	Hebrews	2	16	Indeed , it is obvious that he does not take hold of angels to help them ; on the contrary , “ He takes hold of the seed of Avraham. ” [ e ]
CJB	Hebrews	2	17	This is why he had to become like his brothers in every respect — so that he might become a merciful and faithful cohen gadol in the service of God , making a kapparah for the sins of the people .
CJB	Hebrews	2	18	For since he himself suffered death when he was put to the test , he is able to help those who are being tested now . Footnotes - Hebrews 2:8 Psalm 8:5–7 ( 4–6 ) - Hebrews 2:12 Psalm 22:23 (
CJB	Hebrews	2	22	) - Hebrews 2:13 Isaiah 8:17 - Hebrews 2:13 Isaiah 8:18 ( Septuagint ) - Hebrews 2:16 Isaiah 41:8–9
CJB	Hebrews	3	3	But Yeshua deserves more honor than Moshe , just as the builder of the house deserves more honor than the house .
CJB	Hebrews	3	2	He was faithful to God , who appointed him ; just as “ Moshe was faithful in all God ’ s house. ” [ a ]
CJB	Hebrews	3	4	For every house is built by someone , but the one who built everything is God .
CJB	Hebrews	3	5	Also , Moshe was faithful in all God ’ s house , as a servant giving witness to things God would divulge later .
CJB	Hebrews	3	6	But the Messiah , as Son , was faithful over God ’ s house . And we are that house of his , provided we hold firmly to the courage and confidence inspired by what we hope for .
CJB	Hebrews	3	7	Therefore , as the Ruach HaKodesh says , “ Today , if you hear God ’ s voice ,
CJB	Hebrews	3	8	don ’ t harden your hearts , as you did in the Bitter Quarrel on that day in the Wilderness when you put God to the test .
CJB	Hebrews	3	9	Yes , your fathers put me to the test ; they challenged me , and they saw my work for forty years !
CJB	Hebrews	3	10	Therefore , I was disgusted with that generation — I said , ‘ Their hearts are always going astray , they have not understood how I do things ’ ;
CJB	Hebrews	3	11	in my anger , I swore that they would not enter my rest. ” [ b ]
CJB	Hebrews	3	12	Watch out , brothers , so that there will not be in any one of you an evil heart lacking trust , which could lead you to apostatize from the living God !
CJB	Hebrews	3	13	Instead , keep exhorting each other every day , as long as it is called Today , so that none of you will become hardened by the deceit of sin .
CJB	Hebrews	3	14	For we have become sharers in the Messiah , provided , however , that we hold firmly to the conviction we began with , right through until the goal is reached .
CJB	Hebrews	3	15	Now where it says , “ Today , if you hear God ’ s voice , don ’ t harden your hearts , as you did in the Bitter Quarrel , ” [ c ]
CJB	Hebrews	3	16	who were the people who , after they heard , quarreled so bitterly ? All those whom Moshe brought out of Egypt .
CJB	Hebrews	3	17	And with whom was God disgusted for forty years ? Those who sinned — yes , they fell dead in the Wilderness !
CJB	Hebrews	3	18	And to whom was it that he swore that they would not enter his rest ? Those who were disobedient .
CJB	Hebrews	3	19	So we see that they were unable to enter because of lack of trust . Footnotes - Hebrews 3:2 Numbers 12:7 - Hebrews 3:11 Psalm 95:7–11 - Hebrews 3:15 Psalm 95:7–8
CJB	Hebrews	4	4	For there is a place where it is said , concerning the seventh day , “ And God rested on the seventh day from all his works. ” [ b ]
CJB	Hebrews	4	2	for Good News has also been proclaimed to us , just as it was to them . But the message they heard didn ’ t do them any good , because those who heard it did not combine it with trust .
CJB	Hebrews	4	3	For it is we who have trusted who enter the rest . It is just as he said , “ And in my anger , I swore that they would not enter my rest. ” [ a ] He swore this even though his works have been in existence since the founding of the universe .
CJB	Hebrews	4	5	And once more , our present text says , “ They will not enter my rest. ” [ c ]
CJB	Hebrews	4	6	Therefore , since it still remains for some to enter it , and those who received the Good News earlier did not enter ,
CJB	Hebrews	4	7	he again fixes a certain day , “ Today , ” saying through David , so long afterwards , in the text already given , “ Today , if you hear God ’ s voice , don ’ t harden your hearts. ” [ d ]
CJB	Hebrews	4	8	For if Y ’ hoshua had given them rest , God would not have spoken later of another “ day. ”
CJB	Hebrews	4	9	So there remains a Shabbat-keeping for God ’ s people .
CJB	Hebrews	4	10	For the one who has entered God ’ s rest has also rested from his own works , as God did from his .
CJB	Hebrews	4	11	Therefore , let us do our best to enter that rest ; so that no one will fall short because of the same kind of disobedience .
CJB	Hebrews	4	12	See , the Word of God is alive ! It is at work and is sharper than any double-edged sword — it cuts right through to where soul meets spirit and joints meet marrow , and it is quick to judge the inner reflections and attitudes of the heart .
CJB	Hebrews	4	13	Before God , nothing created is hidden , but all things are naked and open to the eyes of him to whom we must render an account .
CJB	Hebrews	4	14	Therefore , since we have a great cohen gadol who has passed through to the highest heaven , Yeshua , the Son of God , let us hold firmly to what we acknowledge as true .
CJB	Hebrews	4	15	For we do not have a cohen gadol unable to empathize with our weaknesses ; since in every respect he was tempted just as we are , the only difference being that he did not sin .
CJB	Hebrews	4	16	Therefore , let us confidently approach the throne from which God gives grace , so that we may receive mercy and find grace in our time of need . Footnotes - Hebrews 4:3 Psalm 95:11 - Hebrews 4:4 Genesis 2:2 - Hebrews 4:5 Psalm 95:11 - Hebrews 4:7 Psalm 95:7–8
CJB	Hebrews	5	5	So neither did the Messiah glorify himself to become cohen gadol ; rather , it was the One who said to him , “ You are my Son ; today I have become your Father. ” [ a ]
CJB	Hebrews	5	2	He can deal gently with the ignorant and with those who go astray , since he too is subject to weakness .
CJB	Hebrews	5	3	Also , because of this weakness , he has to offer sacrifices for his own sins , as well as those of the people .
CJB	Hebrews	5	4	And no one takes this honor upon himself , rather , he is called by God , just as Aharon was .
CJB	Hebrews	5	6	Also , as he says in another place , “ You are a cohen forever , to be compared with Malki-Tzedek. ” [ b ]
CJB	Hebrews	5	7	During Yeshua ’ s life on earth , he offered up prayers and petitions , crying aloud and shedding tears , to the One who had the power to deliver him from death ; and he was heard because of his godliness .
CJB	Hebrews	5	8	Even though he was the Son , he learned obedience through his sufferings .
CJB	Hebrews	5	9	And after he had been brought to the goal , he became the source of eternal deliverance to all who obey him ,
CJB	Hebrews	5	10	since he had been proclaimed by God as a cohen gadol to be compared with Malki-Tzedek .
CJB	Hebrews	5	11	We have much to say about this subject , but it is hard to explain , because you have become sluggish in understanding .
CJB	Hebrews	5	12	For although by this time you ought to be teachers , you need someone to teach you the very first principles of God ’ s Word all over again ! You need milk , not solid food !
CJB	Hebrews	5	13	Anyone who has to drink milk is still a baby , without experience in applying the Word about righteousness .
CJB	Hebrews	5	14	But solid food is for the mature , for those whose faculties have been trained by continuous exercise to distinguish good from evil . Footnotes - Hebrews 5:5 Psalm 2:7 - Hebrews 5:6 Psalm 110:4
CJB	Hebrews	6	6	and then have fallen away — it is impossible to renew them so that they turn from their sin , as long as for themselves they keep executing the Son of God on the stake all over again and keep holding him up to public contempt .
CJB	Hebrews	6	2	and instruction about washings , s ’ mikhah , the resurrection of the dead and eternal punishment .
CJB	Hebrews	6	3	And , God willing , this is what we will do .
CJB	Hebrews	6	4	For when people have once been enlightened , tasted the heavenly gift , become sharers in the Ruach HaKodesh ,
CJB	Hebrews	6	5	and tasted the goodness of God ’ s Word and the powers of the ‘ olam haba —
CJB	Hebrews	6	7	For the land that soaks up frequent rains and then brings forth a crop useful to its owners receives a blessing from God ;
CJB	Hebrews	6	8	but if it keeps producing thorns and thistles , it fails the test and is close to being cursed ; [ a ] in the end , it will be burned .
CJB	Hebrews	6	9	Now even though we speak this way , dear friends , we are confident that you have the better things that come with being delivered .
CJB	Hebrews	6	10	For God is not so unfair as to forget your work and the love you showed for him in your past service to his people — and in your present service too .
CJB	Hebrews	6	11	However , we want each one of you to keep showing the same diligence right up to the end , when your hope will be realized ;
CJB	Hebrews	6	12	so that you will not become sluggish , but will be imitators of those who by their trust and patience are receiving what has been promised .
CJB	Hebrews	6	13	For when God made his promise to Avraham , he swore an oath to do what he had promised ; and since there was no one greater than himself for him to swear by , he swore by himself [ b ]
CJB	Hebrews	6	14	and said , “ I will certainly bless you , and I will certainly give you many descendants ” ; [ c ]
CJB	Hebrews	6	15	and so , after waiting patiently , Avraham saw the promise fulfilled .
CJB	Hebrews	6	16	Now people swear oaths by someone greater than themselves , and confirmation by an oath puts an end to all dispute .
CJB	Hebrews	6	17	Therefore , when God wanted to demonstrate still more convincingly the unchangeable character of his intentions to those who were to receive what he had promised , he added an oath to the promise ;
CJB	Hebrews	6	18	so that through two unchangeable things , in neither of which God could lie , we , who have fled to take a firm hold on the hope set before us , would be strongly encouraged .
CJB	Hebrews	6	19	We have this hope as a sure and safe anchor for ourselves , a hope that goes right on through to what is inside the parokhet ,
CJB	Hebrews	6	20	where a forerunner has entered on our behalf , namely , Yeshua , who has become a cohen gadol forever , to be compared with Malki-Tzedek . [ d ] Footnotes - Hebrews 6:8 Genesis 3:17–18 - Hebrews 6:13 Genesis 22:16 - Hebrews 6:14 Genesis 22:17 - Hebrews 6:20 Psalm 110:4
CJB	Hebrews	7	7	and it is beyond all dispute that the one who blesses has higher status than the one who receives the blessing .
CJB	Hebrews	7	2	also Avraham gave him a tenth of everything . [ a ] Now first of all , by translation of his name , he is “ king of righteousness ” ; and then he is also king of Shalem , which means “ king of peace. ”
CJB	Hebrews	7	3	There is no record of his father , mother , ancestry , birth or death ; rather , like the Son of God , he continues as a cohen for all time .
CJB	Hebrews	7	4	Just think how great he was ! Even the Patriarch Avraham gave him a tenth of the choicest spoils .
CJB	Hebrews	7	5	Now the descendants of Levi who became cohanim have a commandment in the Torah to take a tenth of the income of the people , that is , from their own brothers , despite the fact that they too are descended from Avraham .
CJB	Hebrews	7	6	But Malki-Tzedek , even though he was not descended from Levi , took a tenth from Avraham . Also , he blessed Avraham , the man who received God ’ s promises ;
CJB	Hebrews	7	8	Moreover , in the case of the cohanim , the tenth is received by men who die ; while in the case of Malki-Tzedek , it is received by someone who is testified to be still alive .
CJB	Hebrews	7	9	One might go even further and say that Levi , who himself receives tenths , paid a tenth through Avraham ;
CJB	Hebrews	7	10	inasmuch as he was still in his ancestor Avraham ’ s body when Malki-Tzedek met him .
CJB	Hebrews	7	11	Therefore , if it had been possible to reach the goal through the system of cohanim derived from Levi ( since in connection with it , the people were given the Torah ) , what need would there have been for another , different kind of cohen , the one spoken of as to be compared with Malki-Tzedek and not to be compared with Aharon ?
CJB	Hebrews	7	12	For if the system of cohanim is transformed , there must of necessity occur a transformation of Torah .
CJB	Hebrews	7	13	The one about whom these things are said belongs to another tribe , from which no one has ever served at the altar ;
CJB	Hebrews	7	14	for everyone knows that our Lord arose out of Y ’ hudah , and that Moshe said nothing about this tribe when he spoke about cohanim .
CJB	Hebrews	7	15	It becomes even clearer if a “ different kind of cohen , ” one like Malki-Tzedek , arises ,
CJB	Hebrews	7	16	one who became a cohen not by virtue of a rule in the Torah concerning physical descent , but by virtue of the power of an indestructible life .
CJB	Hebrews	7	17	For it is stated , “ You are a cohen FOREVER , to be compared with Malki-Tzedek. ” [ b ]
CJB	Hebrews	7	18	Thus , on the one hand , the earlier rule is set aside because of its weakness and inefficacy
CJB	Hebrews	7	19	( for the Torah did not bring anything to the goal ) ; and , on the other hand , a hope of something better is introduced , through which we are drawing near to God .
CJB	Hebrews	7	20	What is more , God swore an oath . For no oath was sworn in connection with those who become cohanim now ;
CJB	Hebrews	7	21	but Yeshua became a cohen by the oath which God swore when he said to him , “ Adonai has sworn and will not change his mind , ‘ You are a cohen forever. ’ ” [ c ]
CJB	Hebrews	7	22	Also this shows how much better is the covenant of which Yeshua has become guarantor .
CJB	Hebrews	7	23	Moreover , the present cohanim are many in number , because they are prevented by death from continuing in office .
CJB	Hebrews	7	24	But because he lives forever , his position as cohen does not pass on to someone else ;
CJB	Hebrews	7	25	and consequently , he is totally able to deliver those who approach God through him ; since he is alive forever and thus forever able to intercede on their behalf .
CJB	Hebrews	7	26	This is the kind of cohen gadol that meets our need — holy , without evil , without stain , set apart from sinners and raised higher than the heavens ;
CJB	Hebrews	7	27	one who does not have the daily necessity , like the other cohanim g ’ dolim , of offering up sacrifices first for their own sins and only then for those of the people ; because he offered one sacrifice , once and for all , by offering up himself .
CJB	Hebrews	7	28	For the Torah appoints as cohanim g ’ dolim men who have weakness ; but the text which speaks about the swearing of the oath , a text written later than the Torah , appoints a Son who has been brought to the goal forever .

CJB	Hebrews	8	8	For God does find fault with the people when he says , “ ‘ See ! The days are coming , ’ says Adonai , ‘ when I will establish over the house of Isra ’ el and over the house of Y ’ hudah a new covenant .
CJB	Hebrews	8	2	There he serves in the Holy Place , that is , in the true Tent of Meeting , the one erected not by human beings but by Adonai .
CJB	Hebrews	8	3	For every cohen gadol is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices ; so this cohen gadol too has to have something he can offer .
CJB	Hebrews	8	4	Now if he were on earth , he wouldn ’ t be a cohen at all , since there already are cohanim offering the gifts required by the Torah .
CJB	Hebrews	8	5	But what they are serving is only a copy and shadow of the heavenly original ; for when Moshe was about to erect the Tent , God warned him , “ See to it that you make everything according to the pattern you were shown on the mountain. ” [ b ]
CJB	Hebrews	8	6	But now the work Yeshua has been given to do is far superior to theirs , just as the covenant he mediates is better . For this covenant has been given as Torah on the basis of better promises .
CJB	Hebrews	8	7	Indeed , if the first covenant had not given ground for faultfinding , there would have been no need for a second one .
CJB	Hebrews	8	9	“ ‘ It will not be like the covenant which I made with their fathers on the day when I took them by their hand and led them forth out of the land of Egypt ; because they , for their part , did not remain faithful to my covenant ; so I , for my part , stopped concerning myself with them , ’ says Adonai .
CJB	Hebrews	8	10	“ ‘ For this is the covenant which I will make with the house of Isra ’ el after those days , ’ says Adonai : ‘ I will put my Torah in their minds and write it on their hearts ; I will be their God , and they will be my people .
CJB	Hebrews	8	11	“ ‘ None of them will teach his fellow-citizen or his brother , saying , “ Know Adonai ! ” For all will know me , from the least of them to the greatest ,
CJB	Hebrews	8	12	because I will be merciful toward their wickednesses and remember their sins no more. ’ ” [ c ]
CJB	Hebrews	8	13	By using the term , “ new , ” he has made the first covenant “ old ” ; and something being made old , something in the process of aging , is on its way to vanishing altogether .

CJB	Hebrews	9	9	This symbolizes the present age and indicates that the conscience of the person performing the service can not be brought to the goal by the gifts and sacrifices he offers .
CJB	Hebrews	9	2	A tent was set up , the outer one , which was called the Holy Place ; in it were the menorah , the table and the Bread of the Presence .
CJB	Hebrews	9	3	Behind the second parokhet was a tent called the Holiest Place ,
CJB	Hebrews	9	4	which had the golden altar for burning incense and the Ark of the Covenant , entirely covered with gold . In the Ark were the gold jar containing the man , Aharon ’ s rod that sprouted and the stone Tablets of the Covenant ;
CJB	Hebrews	9	5	and above it were the k ’ ruvim representing the Sh ’ khinah , casting their shadow on the lid of the Ark — but now is not the time to discuss these things in detail .
CJB	Hebrews	9	6	With things so arranged , the cohanim go into the outer tent all the time to discharge their duties ;
CJB	Hebrews	9	7	but only the cohen hagadol enters the inner one ; and he goes in only once a year , and he must always bring blood , which he offers both for himself and for the sins committed in ignorance by the people .
CJB	Hebrews	9	8	By this arrangement , the Ruach HaKodesh showed that so long as the first Tent had standing , the way into the Holiest Place was still closed .
CJB	Hebrews	9	10	For they involve only food and drink and various ceremonial washings — regulations concerning the outward life , imposed until the time for God to reshape the whole structure .
CJB	Hebrews	9	11	But when the Messiah appeared as cohen gadol of the good things that are happening already , then , through the greater and more perfect Tent which is not man-made ( that is , it is not of this created world ) ,
CJB	Hebrews	9	12	he entered the Holiest Place once and for all . And he entered not by means of the blood of goats and calves , but by means of his own blood , thus setting people free forever .
CJB	Hebrews	9	13	For if sprinkling ceremonially unclean persons with the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer restores their outward purity ;
CJB	Hebrews	9	14	then how much more the blood of the Messiah , who , through the eternal Spirit , offered himself to God as a sacrifice without blemish , will purify our conscience from works that lead to death , so that we can serve the living God !
CJB	Hebrews	9	15	It is because of this death that he is mediator of a new covenant [ or will ] . [ a ] Because a death has occurred which sets people free from the transgressions committed under the first covenant , those who have been called may receive the promised eternal inheritance .
CJB	Hebrews	9	16	For where there is a will , there must necessarily be produced evidence of its maker ’ s death ,
CJB	Hebrews	9	17	since a will goes into effect only upon death ; it never has force while its maker is still alive .
CJB	Hebrews	9	18	This is why the first covenant too was inaugurated with blood .
CJB	Hebrews	9	19	After Moshe had proclaimed every command of the Torah to all the people , he took the blood of the calves with some water and used scarlet wool and hyssop to sprinkle both the scroll itself and all the people ;
CJB	Hebrews	9	20	and he said , “ This is the blood of the covenant which God has ordained for you. ” [ b ]
CJB	Hebrews	9	21	Likewise , he sprinkled with the blood both the Tent and all the things used in its ceremonies .
CJB	Hebrews	9	22	In fact , according to the Torah , almost everything is purified with blood ; indeed , without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins .
CJB	Hebrews	9	23	Now this is how the copies of the heavenly things had to be purified , but the heavenly things themselves require better sacrifices than these .
CJB	Hebrews	9	24	For the Messiah has entered a Holiest Place which is not man-made and merely a copy of the true one , but into heaven itself , in order to appear now on our behalf in the very presence of God .
CJB	Hebrews	9	25	Further , he did not enter heaven to offer himself over and over again , like the cohen hagadol who enters the Holiest Place year after year with blood that is not his own ;
CJB	Hebrews	9	26	for then he would have had to suffer death many times — from the founding of the universe on . But as it is , he has appeared once at the end of the ages in order to do away with sin through the sacrifice of himself .
CJB	Hebrews	9	27	Just as human beings have to die once , but after this comes judgment ,
CJB	Hebrews	9	28	so also the Messiah , having been offered once to bear the sins of many , [ c ] will appear a second time , not to deal with sin , but to deliver those who are eagerly waiting for him . Footnotes - Hebrews 9:15 Jeremiah 31:30 (
CJB	Hebrews	9	31	) - Hebrews 9:20 Exodus 24:8 - Hebrews 9:28 Isaiah 53:12
CJB	Hebrews	10	10	It is in connection with this will that we have been separated for God and made holy , once and for all , through the offering of Yeshua the Messiah ’ s body .
CJB	Hebrews	10	2	Otherwise , wouldn ’ t the offering of those sacrifices have ceased ? For if the people performing the service had been cleansed once and for all , they would no longer have sins on their conscience .
CJB	Hebrews	10	3	No , it is quite the contrary — in these sacrifices is a reminder of sins , year after year .
CJB	Hebrews	10	4	For it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins .
CJB	Hebrews	10	5	This is why , on coming into the world , he says , “ It has not been your will to have an animal sacrifice and a meal offering ; rather , you have prepared for me a body .
CJB	Hebrews	10	6	No , you have not been pleased with burnt offerings and sin offerings .
CJB	Hebrews	10	7	Then I said , ‘ Look ! In the scroll of the book it is written about me . I have come to do your will. ’ ” [ a ]
CJB	Hebrews	10	8	In saying first , “ You neither willed nor were pleased with animal sacrifices , meal offerings , burnt offerings and sin offerings , ” things which are offered in accordance with the Torah ;
CJB	Hebrews	10	9	and then , “ Look , I have come to do your will ” ; he takes away the first system in order to set up the second .
CJB	Hebrews	10	11	Now every cohen stands every day doing his service , offering over and over the same sacrifices , which can never take away sins .
CJB	Hebrews	10	12	But this one , after he had offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins , sat down at the right hand of God ,
CJB	Hebrews	10	13	from then on to wait until his enemies be made a footstool for his feet . [ b ]
CJB	Hebrews	10	14	For by a single offering he has brought to the goal for all time those who are being set apart for God and made holy .
CJB	Hebrews	10	15	And the Ruach HaKodesh too bears witness to us ; for after saying ,
CJB	Hebrews	10	16	“ ‘ This is the covenant which I will make with them after those days , ’ says Adonai : ‘ I will put my Torah on their hearts , and write it on their minds . . . , ’ ” [ c ]
CJB	Hebrews	10	17	he then adds , “ ‘ And their sins and their wickednesses I will remember no more. ’ ” [ d ]
CJB	Hebrews	10	18	Now where there is forgiveness for these , an offering for sins is no longer needed .
CJB	Hebrews	10	19	So , brothers , we have confidence to use the way into the Holiest Place opened by the blood of Yeshua .
CJB	Hebrews	10	20	He inaugurated it for us as a new and living way through the parokhet , by means of his flesh .
CJB	Hebrews	10	21	We also have a great cohen over God ’ s household .
CJB	Hebrews	10	22	Therefore , let us approach the Holiest Place with a sincere heart , in the full assurance that comes from trusting — with our hearts sprinkled clean from a bad conscience and our bodies washed with pure water . [ e ]
CJB	Hebrews	10	23	Let us continue holding fast to the hope we acknowledge , without wavering ; for the One who made the promise is trustworthy .
CJB	Hebrews	10	24	And let us keep paying attention to one another , in order to spur each other on to love and good deeds ,
CJB	Hebrews	10	25	not neglecting our own congregational meetings , as some have made a practice of doing , but , rather , encouraging each other . And let us do this all the more as you see the Day approaching .
CJB	Hebrews	10	26	For if we deliberately continue to sin after receiving the knowledge of the truth , there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins ,
CJB	Hebrews	10	27	but only the terrifying prospect of Judgment , of raging fire that will consume the enemies . [ f ]
CJB	Hebrews	10	28	Someone who disregards the Torah of Moshe is put to death without mercy on the word of two or three witnesses . [ g ]
CJB	Hebrews	10	29	Think how much worse will be the punishment deserved by someone who has trampled underfoot the Son of God ; who has treated as something common the blood of the covenant [ h ] which made him holy ; and who has insulted the Spirit , giver of God ’ s grace !
CJB	Hebrews	10	30	For the One we know is the One who said , “ Vengeance is my responsibility ; I will repay , ” and then said , “ Adonai will judge his people. ” [ i ]
CJB	Hebrews	10	31	It is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God !
CJB	Hebrews	10	32	But remember the earlier days , when , after you had received the light , you endured a hard struggle with sufferings .
CJB	Hebrews	10	33	) - Hebrews 10:17 Jeremiah 31:33 (

CJB	Hebrews	10	35	So don ’ t throw away that courage of yours , which carries with it such a great reward .
CJB	Hebrews	10	36	For you need to hold out ; so that , by having done what God wills , you may receive what he has promised .
CJB	Hebrews	10	37	For “ There is so , so little time ! The One coming will indeed come , he will not delay .
CJB	Hebrews	10	38	But the person who is righteous will live his life by trusting , and if he shrinks back , I will not be pleased with him. ” [ j ]
CJB	Hebrews	10	39	However , we are not the kind who shrink back and are destroyed ; on the contrary , we keep trusting and thus preserve our lives ! Footnotes - Hebrews 10:7 Psalm 40:7–9 ( 6–8 ) - Hebrews 10:13 Psalm 110:1 - Hebrews 10:16 Jeremiah 31:32 (
CJB	Hebrews	11	11	By trusting , he received potency to father a child , even when he was past the age for it , as was Sarah herself ; because he regarded the One who had made the promise as trustworthy .
CJB	Hebrews	11	2	It was for this that Scripture attested the merit of the people of old .
CJB	Hebrews	11	3	By trusting , we understand that the universe was created through a spoken word of God , so that what is seen did not come into being out of existing phenomena .
CJB	Hebrews	11	4	By trusting , Hevel offered a greater sacrifice than Kayin ; because of this , he was attested as righteous , with God giving him this testimony on the ground of his gifts . Through having trusted , he still continues to speak , even though he is dead .
CJB	Hebrews	11	5	By trusting , Hanokh was taken away from this life without seeing death — “ He was not to be found , because God took him away ” — for he has been attested as having been , prior to being taken away , well pleasing to God . [ b ]
CJB	Hebrews	11	6	And without trusting , it is impossible to be well pleasing to God , because whoever approaches him must trust that he does exist and that he becomes a Rewarder to those who seek him out .
CJB	Hebrews	11	7	By trusting , Noach , after receiving divine warning about things as yet unseen , was filled with holy fear and built an ark to save his household . Through this trusting , he put the world under condemnation and received the righteousness that comes from trusting .
CJB	Hebrews	11	8	By trusting , Avraham obeyed , after being called to go out [ c ] to a place which God would give him as a possession ; indeed , he went out without knowing where he was going .
CJB	Hebrews	11	9	By trusting , he lived as a temporary resident in the Land of the promise , as if it were not his , staying in tents with Yitz ’ chak and Ya ‘ akov , who were to receive what was promised along with him .
CJB	Hebrews	11	10	For he was looking forward to the city with permanent foundations , of which the architect and builder is God .
CJB	Hebrews	11	12	) ; Exodus 32:13 ; Deuteronomy 1:10 ; 10:22 - Hebrews 11:13
CJB	Hebrews	11	13	All these people kept on trusting until they died , without receiving what had been promised . They had only seen it and welcomed it from a distance , while acknowledging that they were aliens and temporary residents on the earth . [ e ]
CJB	Hebrews	11	14	For people who speak this way make it clear that they are looking for a fatherland .
CJB	Hebrews	11	15	Now if they were to keep recalling the one they left , they would have an opportunity to return ;
CJB	Hebrews	11	16	but as it is , they aspire to a better fatherland , a heavenly one . This is why God is not ashamed to be called their God , for he has prepared for them a city .
CJB	Hebrews	11	17	By trusting , Avraham , when he was put to the test , offered up Yitz ’ chak as a sacrifice . Yes , he offered up his only son , he who had received the promises ,
CJB	Hebrews	11	18	to whom it had been said , “ What is called your ‘ seed ’ will be in Yitz ’ chak. ” [ f ]
CJB	Hebrews	11	19	For he had concluded that God could even raise people from the dead ! And , figuratively speaking , he did so receive him .
CJB	Hebrews	11	20	By trusting , Yitz ’ chak in his blessings over Ya ‘ akov and Esav made reference to events yet to come .
CJB	Hebrews	11	21	By trusting , Ya ‘ akov , when he was dying , blessed each of Yosef ’ s sons , leaning on his walking-stick as he bowed in prayer . [ g ]
CJB	Hebrews	11	22	)
CJB	Hebrews	11	23	By trusting , the parents of Moshe hid him for three months after he was born , because they saw that he was a beautiful child , [ h ] and they weren ’ t afraid of the king ’ s decree .
CJB	Hebrews	11	24	By trusting , Moshe , after he had grown up , [ i ] refused to be called the son of Pharaoh ’ s daughter .
CJB	Hebrews	11	25	He chose being mistreated along with God ’ s people rather than enjoying the passing pleasures of sin .
CJB	Hebrews	11	26	He had come to regard abuse suffered on behalf of the Messiah as greater riches than the treasures of Egypt , for he kept his eyes fixed on the reward .
CJB	Hebrews	11	27	By trusting , he left Egypt , not fearing the king ’ s anger ; he persevered as one who sees the unseen .
CJB	Hebrews	11	28	By trusting , he obeyed the requirements for the Pesach , including the smearing of the blood , so that the Destroyer of the firstborn would not touch the firstborn of Isra ’ el .
CJB	Hebrews	11	29	By trusting , they walked through the Red Sea as through dry land ; when the Egyptians tried to do it , the sea swallowed them up .
CJB	Hebrews	11	30	By trusting , the walls of Yericho fell down — after the people had marched around them for seven days .
CJB	Hebrews	11	31	By trusting , Rachav the prostitute welcomed the spies and therefore did not die along with those who were disobedient .
CJB	Hebrews	11	32	What more should I say ? There isn ’ t time to tell about Gid ‘ on , Barak , Shimshon , Yiftach , David , Sh ’ mu ’ el and the prophets ;
CJB	Hebrews	11	33	who , through trusting , conquered kingdoms , worked righteousness , received what was promised , shut the mouths of lions , [ j ]
CJB	Hebrews	11	34	quenched the power of fire , escaped the edge of the sword , had their weakness turned to strength , grew mighty in battle and routed foreign armies .
CJB	Hebrews	11	35	Women received back their dead resurrected ; other people were stretched on the rack and beaten to death , refusing to be ransomed , so that they would gain a better resurrection .
CJB	Hebrews	11	36	Others underwent the trials of being mocked and whipped , then chained and imprisoned .
CJB	Hebrews	11	37	They were stoned , sawed in two , murdered by the sword ; they went about clothed in sheepskins and goatskins , destitute , persecuted , mistreated ,
CJB	Hebrews	11	38	wandering about in deserts and mountains , living in caves and holes in the ground ! The world was not worthy of them !
CJB	Hebrews	11	39	All of these had their merit attested because of their trusting . Nevertheless , they did not receive what had been promised ,
CJB	Hebrews	11	40	because God had planned something better that would involve us , so that only with us would they be brought to the goal . Footnotes - Hebrews 11:1 Habakkuk 2:4 - Hebrews 11:5 Genesis 5:24 - Hebrews 11:8 Genesis 12:1 - Hebrews 11:12 Genesis 15:5–6 ; 22:17 ; 32:13 (

CJB	Hebrews	12	3	Yes , think about him who endured such hostility against himself from sinners , so that you won ’ t grow tired or become despondent .
CJB	Hebrews	12	4	You have not yet resisted to the point of shedding blood in the contest against sin .
CJB	Hebrews	12	5	Also you have forgotten the counsel which speaks with you as sons : “ My son , don ’ t despise the discipline of Adonai or become despondent when he corrects you .
CJB	Hebrews	12	6	For Adonai disciplines those he loves and whips everyone he accepts as a son. ” [ c ]
CJB	Hebrews	12	7	Regard your endurance as discipline ; God is dealing with you as sons . For what son goes undisciplined by his father ?
CJB	Hebrews	12	8	All legitimate sons undergo discipline ; so if you don ’ t , you ’ re a mamzer and not a son !
CJB	Hebrews	12	9	Furthermore , we had physical fathers who disciplined us , and we respected them ; how much more should we submit to our spiritual Father and live !
CJB	Hebrews	12	10	For they disciplined us only for a short time and only as best they could ; but he disciplines us in a way that provides genuine benefit to us and enables us to share in his holiness .
CJB	Hebrews	12	11	Now , all discipline , while it is happening , does indeed seem painful , not enjoyable ; but for those who have been trained by it , it later produces its peaceful fruit , which is righteousness .
CJB	Hebrews	12	13	and make a level path for your feet ; [ e ] so that what has been injured will not get wrenched out of joint but rather will be healed .
CJB	Hebrews	12	14	Keep pursuing shalom with everyone and the holiness without which no one will see the Lord .
CJB	Hebrews	12	15	See to it that no one misses out on God ’ s grace , that no root of bitterness [ f ] springing up causes trouble and thus contaminates many ,
CJB	Hebrews	12	16	and that no one is sexually immoral , or godless like Esav , who in exchange for a single meal gave up his rights as the firstborn .
CJB	Hebrews	12	17	For you know that afterwards , when he wanted to obtain his father ’ s blessing , he was rejected ; indeed , even though he sought it with tears , his change of heart was to no avail .

CJB	Hebrews	12	25	See that you don ’ t reject the One speaking ! For if those did not escape who rejected him when he gave divine warning on earth , think how much less we will escape if we turn away from him when he warns from heaven .

CJB	Hebrews	12	28	Therefore , since we have received an unshakeable Kingdom , let us have grace , through which we may offer service that will please God , with reverence and fear .

CJB	Hebrews	13	3	Remember those in prison and being mistreated , as if you were in prison with them and undergoing their torture yourselves .
CJB	Hebrews	13	4	Marriage is honorable in every respect ; and , in particular , sex within marriage is pure . But God will indeed punish fornicators and adulterers .
CJB	Hebrews	13	5	Keep your lives free from the love of money ; and be satisfied with what you have ; for God himself has said , “ I will never fail you or abandon you. ” [ a ]
CJB	Hebrews	13	6	Therefore , we say with confidence , “ Adonai is my helper ; I will not be afraid — what can a human being do to me ? ” [ b ]
CJB	Hebrews	13	7	Remember your leaders , those who spoke God ’ s message to you . Reflect on the results of their way of life , and imitate their trust —
CJB	Hebrews	13	8	Yeshua the Messiah is the same yesterday , today and forever .
CJB	Hebrews	13	9	Do not be carried away by various strange teachings ; for what is good is for the heart to be strengthened by grace , not by foods . People who have made these the focus of their lives have not benefited thereby .
CJB	Hebrews	13	10	We have an altar from which those who serve in the Tent are not permitted to eat .
CJB	Hebrews	13	11	For the cohen hagadol brings the blood of animals into the Holiest Place as a sin offering , but their bodies are burned outside the camp . [ c ]
CJB	Hebrews	13	12	So too Yeshua suffered death outside the gate , in order to make the people holy through his own blood .
CJB	Hebrews	13	14	For we have no permanent city here ; on the contrary , we seek the one to come .
CJB	Hebrews	13	15	Through him , therefore , let us offer God a sacrifice of praise continually . [ d ] For this is the natural product of lips that acknowledge his name .
CJB	Hebrews	13	16	But don ’ t forget doing good and sharing with others , for with such sacrifices God is well pleased .
CJB	Hebrews	13	17	Obey your leaders and submit to them , for they keep watch over your lives , as people who will have to render an account . So make it a task of joy for them , not one of groaning ; for that is of no advantage to you .
CJB	Hebrews	13	18	Keep praying for us , for we are certain that we have a clear conscience and want to conduct ourselves properly in everything we do .
CJB	Hebrews	13	19	And all the more I beg you to do this , so that I may be restored to you that much sooner .
CJB	Hebrews	13	20	The God of shalom brought up from the dead the great Shepherd of the sheep , our Lord Yeshua , by the blood of an eternal covenant .
CJB	Hebrews	13	21	May that God equip you with every good thing you need to do his will ; and may he do in us whatever pleases him , through Yeshua the Messiah . To him be the glory forever and ever . Amen .
CJB	Hebrews	13	22	Now I urge you , brothers , to bear with my message of exhortation ; for I have written you only briefly .

CJB	James	1	1	From : Ya ‘ akov , a slave of God and of the Lord Yeshua the Messiah To : The Twelve Tribes in the Diaspora : Shalom !
CJB	James	1	2	Regard it all as joy , my brothers , when you face various kinds of temptations ;
CJB	James	1	3	for you know that the testing of your trust produces perseverance .
CJB	James	1	4	But let perseverance do its complete work ; so that you may be complete and whole , lacking in nothing .
CJB	James	1	5	Now if any of you lacks wisdom , let him ask God , who gives to all generously and without reproach ; and it will be given to him .
CJB	James	1	6	But let him ask in trust , doubting nothing ; for the doubter is like a wave in the sea being tossed and driven by the wind .
CJB	James	1	7	Indeed that person should not think that he will receive anything from the Lord ,
CJB	James	1	8	because he is double-minded , unstable in all his ways .
CJB	James	1	9	Let the brother in humble circumstances boast about his high position .
CJB	James	1	10	But let the rich brother boast about his being humbled ; since , like a wildflower , he will pass away .
CJB	James	1	11	For just as the sun rises with the sharav and dries up the plant , so that its flower falls off and its beauty is destroyed , so too the rich person going about his business will wither away .
CJB	James	1	12	How blessed is the man who perseveres through temptation ! For after he has passed the test , he will receive as his crown the Life which God has promised to those who love him .
CJB	James	1	13	No one being tempted should say , “ I am being tempted by God. ” For God can not be tempted by evil , and God himself tempts no one .
CJB	James	1	14	Rather , each person is being tempted whenever he is being dragged off and enticed by the bait of his own desire .
CJB	James	1	15	Then , having conceived , the desire gives birth to sin ; and when sin is fully grown , it gives birth to death .
CJB	James	1	16	Don ’ t delude yourselves , my dear brothers .
CJB	James	1	17	Every good act of giving and every perfect gift is from above , coming down from the Father who made the heavenly lights ; with him there is neither variation nor darkness caused by turning .
CJB	James	1	18	Having made his decision , he gave birth to us through a Word that can be relied upon , in order that we should be a kind of firstfruits of all that he created .
CJB	James	1	19	Therefore , my dear brothers , let every person be quick to listen but slow to speak , slow to get angry ;
CJB	James	1	20	for a person ’ s anger does not accomplish God ’ s righteousness !
CJB	James	1	21	So rid yourselves of all vulgarity and obvious evil , and receive meekly the Word implanted in you that can save your lives .
CJB	James	1	22	Don ’ t deceive yourselves by only hearing what the Word says , but do it !
CJB	James	1	23	For whoever hears the Word but doesn ’ t do what it says is like someone who looks at his face in a mirror ,
CJB	James	1	24	who looks at himself , goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like .
CJB	James	1	25	But if a person looks closely into the perfect Torah , which gives freedom , and continues , becoming not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work it requires , then he will be blessed in what he does .
CJB	James	1	26	Anyone who thinks he is religiously observant but does not control his tongue is deceiving himself , and his observance counts for nothing .
CJB	James	1	27	The religious observance that God the Father considers pure and faultless is this : to care for orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being contaminated by the world .
CJB	James	2	2	Chronicles 20:7
CJB	James	2	3	If you show more respect to the man wearing the fancy clothes and say to him , “ Have this good seat here , ” while to the poor man you say , “ You , stand over there , ” or , “ Sit down on the floor by my feet , ”
CJB	James	2	4	then aren ’ t you creating distinctions among yourselves , and haven ’ t you made yourselves into judges with evil motives ?
CJB	James	2	5	Listen , my dear brothers , hasn ’ t God chosen the poor of the world to be rich in faith and to receive the Kingdom which he promised to those who love him ?
CJB	James	2	6	But you despise the poor ! Aren ’ t the rich the ones who oppress you and drag you into court ?
CJB	James	2	7	Aren ’ t they the ones who insult the good name of Him to whom you belong ?
CJB	James	2	8	If you truly attain the goal of Kingdom Torah , in conformity with the passage that says , “ Love your neighbor as yourself , ” [ a ] you are doing well .
CJB	James	2	9	But if you show favoritism , your actions constitute sin , since you are convicted under the Torah as transgressors .
CJB	James	2	10	For a person who keeps the whole Torah , yet stumbles at one point , has become guilty of breaking them all .
CJB	James	2	11	For the One who said , “ Don ’ t commit adultery , ” [ b ] also said , “ Don ’ t murder. ” [ c ] Now , if you don ’ t commit adultery but do murder , you have become a transgressor of the Torah .
CJB	James	2	12	Keep speaking and acting like people who will be judged by a Torah which gives freedom .
CJB	James	2	13	For judgment will be without mercy toward one who doesn ’ t show mercy ; but mercy wins out over judgment .

CJB	James	2	15	Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food ,
CJB	James	2	16	and someone says to him , “ Shalom ! Keep warm and eat hearty ! ” without giving him what he needs , what good does it do ?
CJB	James	2	17	Thus , faith by itself , unaccompanied by actions , is dead .
CJB	James	2	18	) - James 2:11 Exodus 20:13 ; Deuteronomy 5:17 - James 2:19 Deuteronomy 6:4 - James 2:23 Genesis 15:6 - James 2:23 Isaiah 41:8 ;
CJB	James	2	19	You believe that “ God is one ” ? [ d ] Good for you ! The demons believe it too — the thought makes them shudder with fear !
CJB	James	2	20	But , foolish fellow , do you want to be shown that such “ faith ” apart from actions is barren ?
CJB	James	2	21	Wasn ’ t Avraham avinu declared righteous because of actions when he offered up his son Yitz ’ chak on the altar ?
CJB	James	2	22	You see that his faith worked with his actions ; by the actions the faith was made complete ;
CJB	James	2	23	and the passage of the Tanakh was fulfilled which says , “ Avraham had faith in God , and it was credited to his account as righteousness. ” [ e ] He was even called God ’ s friend . [ f ]
CJB	James	2	24	You see that a person is declared righteous because of actions and not because of faith alone .
CJB	James	2	25	Likewise , wasn ’ t Rachav the prostitute also declared righteous because of actions when she welcomed the messengers and sent them out by another route ?
CJB	James	2	26	Indeed , just as the body without a spirit is dead , so too faith without actions is dead . Footnotes - James 2:8 Leviticus 19:18 - James 2:11 Exodus 20:13 (
CJB	James	3	3	If we put a bit into a horse ’ s mouth to make it obey us , we control its whole body as well .
CJB	James	3	2	For we all stumble in many ways ; if someone does not stumble in what he says , he is a mature man who can bridle his whole body .
CJB	James	3	4	And think of a ship — although it is huge and is driven by strong winds , yet the pilot can steer it wherever he wants with just a small rudder .
CJB	James	3	5	So too the tongue is a tiny part of the body , yet it boasts great things . See how a little fire sets a whole forest ablaze !
CJB	James	3	6	Yes , the tongue is a fire , a world of wickedness . The tongue is so placed in our body that it defiles every part of it , setting ablaze the whole of our life ; and it is set on fire by Gei-Hinnom itself .
CJB	James	3	7	For people have tamed and continue to tame all kinds of animals , birds , reptiles and sea creatures ;
CJB	James	3	8	but the tongue no one can tame — it is an unstable and evil thing , full of death-dealing poison !
CJB	James	3	9	With it we bless Adonai , the Father ; and with it we curse people , who were made in the image of God . [ a ]
CJB	James	3	10	Out of the same mouth come blessing and cursing ! Brothers , it isn ’ t right for things to be this way .
CJB	James	3	11	A spring doesn ’ t send both fresh and bitter water from the same opening , does it ?
CJB	James	3	12	Can a fig tree yield olives , my brothers ? or a grapevine , figs ? Neither does salt water produce fresh .
CJB	James	3	13	Who among you is wise and understanding ? Let him demonstrate it by his good way of life , by actions done in the humility that grows out of wisdom .
CJB	James	3	14	But if you harbor in your hearts bitter jealousy and selfish ambition , don ’ t boast and attack the truth with lies !
CJB	James	3	15	This wisdom is not the kind that comes down from above ; on the contrary , it is worldly , unspiritual , demonic .
CJB	James	3	16	For where there are jealousy and selfish ambition , there will be disharmony and every foul practice .
CJB	James	3	17	But the wisdom from above is , first of all , pure , then peaceful , kind , open to reason , full of mercy and good fruits , without partiality and without hypocrisy .
CJB	James	3	18	And peacemakers who sow seed in peace raise a harvest of righteousness . Footnotes - James 3:9 Genesis 1:26–27
CJB	James	4	4	You unfaithful wives ! Don ’ t you know that loving the world is hating God ? Whoever chooses to be the world ’ s friend makes himself God ’ s enemy !
CJB	James	4	2	You desire things and don ’ t have them . You kill , and you are jealous , and you still can ’ t get them . So you fight and quarrel . The reason you don ’ t have is that you don ’ t pray !
CJB	James	4	3	Or you pray and don ’ t receive , because you pray with the wrong motive , that of wanting to indulge your own desires .
CJB	James	4	5	Or do you suppose the Scripture speaks in vain when it says that there is a spirit in us which longs to envy ?
CJB	James	4	6	But the grace he gives is greater , which is why it says , “ God opposes the arrogant , but to the humble he gives grace. ” [ a ]
CJB	James	4	7	Therefore , submit to God . Moreover , take a stand against the Adversary , and he will flee from you .
CJB	James	4	8	Come close to God , and he will come close to you . Clean your hands , sinners ; and purify your hearts , you double-minded people !
CJB	James	4	9	Wail , mourn , sob ! Let your laughter be turned into mourning and your joy into gloom !
CJB	James	4	10	Humble yourselves before the Lord , and he will lift you up .
CJB	James	4	11	Brothers , stop speaking against each other ! Whoever speaks against a brother or judges a brother is speaking against Torah and judging Torah . And if you judge Torah , you are not a doer of what Torah says , but a judge .
CJB	James	4	12	There is but one Giver of Torah ; he is also the Judge , with the power to deliver and to destroy . Who do you think you are , judging your fellow human being ?
CJB	James	4	13	Now listen , you who say , “ Today or tomorrow we will go to such-and-such a city , stay there a year trading and make a profit ” !
CJB	James	4	14	You don ’ t even know if you will be alive tomorrow ! For all you are is a mist that appears for a little while and then disappears .
CJB	James	4	15	Instead , you ought to say , “ If Adonai wants it to happen , we will live ” to do this or that .
CJB	James	4	16	But as it is , in your arrogance you boast . All such boasting is evil .
CJB	James	4	17	So then , anyone who knows the right thing to do and fails to do it is committing a sin . Footnotes - James 4:6 Proverbs 3:34
CJB	James	5	5	You have led a life of luxury and self-indulgence here on earth — in a time of slaughter , you have gone on eating to your heart ’ s content .
CJB	James	5	2	Your riches have rotted , and your clothes have become moth-eaten ;
CJB	James	5	3	your gold and silver have corroded , and their corrosion will be evidence against you and will eat up your flesh like fire ! This is the acharit-hayamim , and you have been storing up wealth !
CJB	James	5	4	Listen ! The wages you have fraudulently withheld from the workers who mowed your fields are calling out against you , and the outcries of those who harvested have reached the ears of Adonai-Tzva ’ ot .
CJB	James	5	6	You have condemned , you have murdered the innocent ; they have not withstood you .
CJB	James	5	7	So , brothers , be patient until the Lord returns . See how the farmer waits for the precious “ fruit of the earth ” — he is patient over it until it receives the fall and spring rains . [ a ]
CJB	James	5	8	You too , be patient ; keep up your courage ; for the Lord ’ s return is near .
CJB	James	5	9	Don ’ t grumble against one another , brothers , so that you won ’ t come under condemnation — look ! the Judge is standing at the door !
CJB	James	5	10	As an example of suffering mistreatment and being patient , brothers , take the prophets who spoke in the name of Adonai .
CJB	James	5	11	Look , we regard those who persevered as blessed . You have heard of the perseverance of Iyov , and you know what the purpose of Adonai was , that Adonai is very compassionate and merciful . [ b ]
CJB	James	5	12	Above all , brothers , stop swearing oaths — not “ By heaven , ” not “ By the earth , ” and not by any other formula ; rather , let your “ Yes ” be simply “ Yes ” and your “ No ” simply “ No , ” so that you won ’ t fall under condemnation .
CJB	James	5	13	Is someone among you in trouble ? He should pray . Is someone feeling good ? He should sing songs of praise .
CJB	James	5	14	Is someone among you ill ? He should call for the elders of the congregation . They will pray for him and rub olive oil on him in the name of the Lord .
CJB	James	5	15	The prayer offered with trust will heal the one who is ill — the Lord will restore his health ; and if he has committed sins , he will be forgiven .
CJB	James	5	16	Therefore , openly acknowledge your sins to one another , and pray for each other , so that you may be healed . The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective .
CJB	James	5	17	Eliyahu was only a human being like us ; yet he prayed fervently that it might not rain , and no rain fell on the Land for three years and six months .
CJB	James	5	18	Then he prayed again , and heaven gave rain , and the Land produced its crops .
CJB	James	5	19	My brothers , if one of you wanders from the truth , and someone causes him to return ,
CJB	James	5	20	you should know that whoever turns a sinner from his wandering path will save him from death and cover many sins . [ c ] Footnotes - James 5:7 Deuteronomy 11:14 ; Jeremiah 5:24 ; Joel 2:23 - James 5:11 Exodus 34:6 ; Psalms 103:8 ; 111:4 - James 5:20 Proverbs 10:12

CJB	1%20Peter	1	5	Meanwhile , through trusting , you are being protected by God ’ s power for a deliverance ready to be revealed at the Last Time .
CJB	1%20Peter	1	6	Rejoice in this , even though for a little while you may have to experience grief in various trials .
CJB	1%20Peter	1	7	Even gold is tested for genuineness by fire . The purpose of these trials is so that your trust ’ s genuineness , which is far more valuable than perishable gold , will be judged worthy of praise , glory and honor at the revealing of Yeshua the Messiah .
CJB	1%20Peter	1	8	Without having seen him , you love him . Without seeing him now , but trusting in him , you continue to be full of joy that is glorious beyond words .
CJB	1%20Peter	1	9	And you are receiving what your trust is aiming at , namely , your deliverance .
CJB	1%20Peter	1	10	The prophets , who prophesied about this gift of deliverance that was meant for you , pondered and inquired diligently about it .
CJB	1%20Peter	1	11	They were trying to find out the time and circumstances to which the Spirit of the Messiah in them was referring in predicting the Messiah ’ s sufferings and the glorious things to follow .
CJB	1%20Peter	1	12	It was revealed to them that their service when they spoke about these things was not for their own benefit , but for yours . And these same things have now been proclaimed to you by those who communicated the Good News to you through the Ruach HaKodesh sent from heaven . Even angels long to look into these things !
CJB	1%20Peter	1	13	Therefore , get your minds ready for work , keep yourselves under control , and fix your hopes fully on the gift you will receive when Yeshua the Messiah is revealed .
CJB	1%20Peter	1	14	As people who obey God , do not let yourselves be shaped by the evil desires you used to have when you were still ignorant .
CJB	1%20Peter	1	15	On the contrary , following the Holy One who called you , become holy yourselves in your entire way of life ;
CJB	1%20Peter	1	16	since the Tanakh says , “ You are to be holy because I am holy. ” [ a ]
CJB	1%20Peter	1	17	Also , if you are addressing as Father the one who judges impartially according to each person ’ s actions , you should live out your temporary stay on earth in fear .
CJB	1%20Peter	1	18	You should be aware that the ransom paid to free you from the worthless way of life which your fathers passed on to you did not consist of anything perishable like silver or gold ;
CJB	1%20Peter	1	19	on the contrary , it was the costly bloody sacrificial death of the Messiah , as of a lamb without defect or spot .
CJB	1%20Peter	1	20	God knew him before the founding of the universe , but revealed him in the acharit-hayamim for your sakes .
CJB	1%20Peter	1	21	Through him you trust in God , who raised him from the dead and gave him glory ; so that your trust and hope are in God .
CJB	1%20Peter	1	22	Now that you have purified yourselves by obeying the truth , so that you have a sincere love for your brothers , love each other deeply , with all your heart .
CJB	1%20Peter	1	23	You have been born again not from some seed that will decay , but from one that can not decay , through the living Word of God that lasts forever .
CJB	1%20Peter	1	24	For all humanity is like grass , all its glory is like a wildflower — the grass withers , and the flower falls off ;

CJB	1%20Peter	2	13	For the sake of the Lord , submit yourselves to every human authority — whether to the emperor as being supreme ,
CJB	1%20Peter	2	14	or to governors as being sent by him to punish wrongdoers and praise those who do what is good .
CJB	1%20Peter	2	15	For it is God ’ s will that your doing good should silence the ignorant talk of foolish people .
CJB	1%20Peter	2	16	Submit as people who are free , but not letting your freedom serve as an excuse for evil ; rather , submit as God ’ s slaves .

CJB	1%20Peter	3	13	For who will hurt you if you become zealots for what is good ?
CJB	1%20Peter	3	14	But even if you do suffer for being righteous , you are blessed ! Moreover , don ’ t fear what they fear or be disturbed ,
CJB	1%20Peter	3	15	but treat the Messiah as holy , as Lord in your hearts ; [ b ] while remaining always ready to give a reasoned answer to anyone who asks you to explain the hope you have in you — yet with humility and fear ,
CJB	1%20Peter	3	16	keeping your conscience clear , so that when you are spoken against , those who abuse the good behavior flowing from your union with the Messiah may be put to shame .
CJB	1%20Peter	3	17	For if God has in fact willed that you should suffer , it is better that you suffer for doing what is good than for doing what is evil .
CJB	1%20Peter	3	18	For the Messiah himself died for sins , once and for all , a righteous person on behalf of unrighteous people , so that he might bring you to God . He was put to death in the flesh but brought to life by the Spirit ;
CJB	1%20Peter	3	19	and in this form he went and made a proclamation to the imprisoned spirits ,
CJB	1%20Peter	3	20	to those who were disobedient long ago , in the days of Noach , when God waited patiently during the building of the ark , in which a few people — to be specific , eight — were delivered by means of water .
CJB	1%20Peter	3	21	This also prefigures what delivers us now , the water of immersion , which is not the removal of dirt from the body , but one ’ s pledge to keep a good conscience toward God , through the resurrection of Yeshua the Messiah .
CJB	1%20Peter	3	22	He has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God , [ c ] with angels , authorities and powers subject to him . Footnotes -

CJB	1%20Peter	4	4	They think it strange that you don ’ t plunge with them into the same flood of dissoluteness , and so they heap insults on you .
CJB	1%20Peter	4	2	with the result that he lives the rest of his earthly life no longer controlled by human desires , but by God ’ s will .
CJB	1%20Peter	4	3	For you have spent enough time already living the way the pagans want you to live — in debauchery , lust , drunkenness , orgies , wild parties and forbidden idol-worship .
CJB	1%20Peter	4	5	But they will have to give an account to him who stands ready to judge the living and the dead .
CJB	1%20Peter	4	6	This is why he was proclaimed to those who have died ; it was so that , although physically they would receive the judgment common to all humanity , they might live by the Spirit in the way that God has provided .
CJB	1%20Peter	4	7	The accomplishing of the goal of all things is close at hand . Therefore , keep alert and self-controlled , so that you can pray .
CJB	1%20Peter	4	8	More than anything , keep loving each other actively ; because love covers many sins . [ a ]
CJB	1%20Peter	4	9	Welcome one another into your homes without grumbling .
CJB	1%20Peter	4	10	As each one has received some spiritual gift , he should use it to serve others , like good managers of God ’ s many-sided grace —
CJB	1%20Peter	4	11	if someone speaks , let him speak God ’ s words ; if someone serves , let him do so out of strength that God supplies ; so that in everything God may be glorified through Yeshua the Messiah — to him be glory and power forever and ever . Amen .
CJB	1%20Peter	4	12	Dear friends , don ’ t regard as strange the fiery ordeal occurring among you to test you , as if something extraordinary were happening to you .
CJB	1%20Peter	4	13	Rather , to the extent that you share the fellowship of the Messiah ’ s sufferings , rejoice ; so that you will rejoice even more when his Sh ’ khinah is revealed .
CJB	1%20Peter	4	14	If you are being insulted because you bear the name of the Messiah , how blessed you are ! For the Spirit of the Sh ’ khinah , that is , the Spirit of God , is resting on you !
CJB	1%20Peter	4	15	Let none of you suffer for being a murderer or a thief or an evildoer or a meddler in other people ’ s affairs .
CJB	1%20Peter	4	16	But if anyone suffers for being Messianic , let him not be ashamed ; but let him bring glory to God by the way he bears this name .
CJB	1%20Peter	4	17	For the time has come for the judgment to begin . It begins with the household of God ; and if it starts with us , what will the outcome be for those who are disobeying God ’ s Good News ? —
CJB	1%20Peter	4	18	“ If the righteous is barely delivered , where will the ungodly and sinful end up ? ” [ b ]
CJB	1%20Peter	4	19	So let those who are suffering according to God ’ s will entrust themselves to a faithful Creator by continuing to do what is good . Footnotes -

CJB	1%20Peter	5	5	Likewise , you who are less experienced , submit to leaders . Further , all of you should clothe yourselves in humility toward one another , because God opposes the arrogant , but to the humble he gives grace . [ a ]
CJB	1%20Peter	5	2	shepherd the flock of God that is in your care , exercising oversight not out of constraint , but willingly , as God wants ; and not out of a desire for dishonest gain , but with enthusiasm ;
CJB	1%20Peter	5	3	also not as machers domineering over those in your care , but as people who become examples to the flock .
CJB	1%20Peter	5	4	Then , when the Chief Shepherd appears , you will receive glory as your unfading crown .
CJB	1%20Peter	5	6	Therefore , humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God , so that at the right time he may lift you up .
CJB	1%20Peter	5	7	Throw all your anxieties upon him , because he cares about you .
CJB	1%20Peter	5	8	Stay sober , stay alert ! Your enemy , the Adversary , stalks about like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour .
CJB	1%20Peter	5	9	Stand against him , firm in your trust , knowing that your brothers throughout the world are going through the same kinds of suffering .
CJB	1%20Peter	5	10	You will have to suffer only a little while ; after that , God , who is full of grace , the one who called you to his eternal glory in union with the Messiah , will himself restore , establish and strengthen you and make you firm .
CJB	1%20Peter	5	11	To him be the power forever and ever . Amen .
CJB	1%20Peter	5	12	Through Sila , whom I regard as a faithful brother , I have written you briefly , encouraging you and giving my witness that this is God ’ s true grace . Stand firm in it !

CJB	2%20Peter	1	2	May grace and shalom be yours in full measure , as you come to a full knowledge of God and Yeshua our Lord .
CJB	2%20Peter	1	1	From : Shim ‘ on Kefa , a slave and emissary of Yeshua the Messiah To : Those who , through the righteousness of our God and of our Deliverer Yeshua the Messiah , have been given the same kind of trust as ours :
CJB	2%20Peter	1	3	God ’ s power has given us everything we need for life and godliness , through our knowing the One who called us to his own glory and goodness .
CJB	2%20Peter	1	4	By these he has given us valuable and superlatively great promises , so that through them you might come to share in God ’ s nature and escape the corruption which evil desires have brought into the world .
CJB	2%20Peter	1	5	For this very reason , try your hardest to furnish your faith with goodness , goodness with knowledge ,
CJB	2%20Peter	1	6	knowledge with self-control , self-control with perseverance , perseverance with godliness ,
CJB	2%20Peter	1	7	godliness with brotherly affection , and brotherly affection with love .
CJB	2%20Peter	1	8	For if you have these qualities in abundance , they keep you from being barren and unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah .
CJB	2%20Peter	1	9	Indeed , whoever lacks them is blind , so shortsighted that he forgets that his past sins have been washed away .
CJB	2%20Peter	1	10	Therefore , brothers , try even harder to make your being called and chosen a certainty . For if you keep doing this , you will never stumble .
CJB	2%20Peter	1	11	Thus you will be generously supplied with everything you need to enter the eternal Kingdom of our Lord and Deliverer , Yeshua the Messiah .
CJB	2%20Peter	1	12	For this reason , I will always remind you about these things , even though you know them and are firmly established in the truth you already have .
CJB	2%20Peter	1	13	And I consider it right to keep stirring you up with reminders , as long as I am in the tent of this body .
CJB	2%20Peter	1	14	I know that I will soon lay aside this tent of mine , as our Lord Yeshua the Messiah has made clear to me .
CJB	2%20Peter	1	15	And I will do my best to see that after my exodus , you will be able to remember these things at all times .
CJB	2%20Peter	1	16	For when we made known to you the power and the coming of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah , we did not rely on cunningly contrived myths . On the contrary , we saw his majesty with our own eyes .
CJB	2%20Peter	1	17	For we were there when he received honor and glory from God the Father ; and the voice came to him from the grandeur of the Sh ’ khinah , saying , “ This is my son , whom I love ; I am well pleased with him ! ”
CJB	2%20Peter	1	18	We heard this voice come out of heaven when we were with him on the holy mountain .
CJB	2%20Peter	1	19	Yes , we have the prophetic Word made very certain . You will do well to pay attention to it as to a light shining in a dark , murky place , until the Day dawns and the Morning Star rises in your hearts .
CJB	2%20Peter	1	20	First of all , understand this : no prophecy of Scripture is to be interpreted by an individual on his own ;
CJB	2%20Peter	1	21	for never has a prophecy come as a result of human willing — on the contrary , people moved by the Ruach HaKodesh spoke a message from God .
CJB	2%20Peter	2	2	Peter 2:22 Proverbs 26:11
CJB	2%20Peter	2	3	In their greed they will exploit you with fabricated stories . Their punishment , decreed long ago , is not idle ; their destruction is not asleep !
CJB	2%20Peter	2	4	For God did not spare the angels who sinned ; on the contrary , he put them in gloomy dungeons lower than Sh ’ ol to be held for judgment .
CJB	2%20Peter	2	5	And he did not spare the ancient world ; on the contrary , he preserved Noach , a herald of righteousness , with seven others , and brought the Flood upon a world of ungodly people .
CJB	2%20Peter	2	6	And he condemned the cities of S ’ dom and ‘ Amora , reducing them to ashes and ruin , as a warning to those in the future who would live ungodly lives ;
CJB	2%20Peter	2	7	but he rescued Lot , a righteous man who was distressed by the debauchery of those unprincipled people ;
CJB	2%20Peter	2	8	for the wicked deeds which that righteous man saw and heard , as he lived among them , tormented his righteous heart day after day .
CJB	2%20Peter	2	9	So the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trials and how to hold the wicked until the Day of Judgment while continuing to punish them ,
CJB	2%20Peter	2	10	especially those who follow their old natures in lust for filth and who despise authority . Presumptuous and self-willed , these false teachers do not tremble at insulting angelic beings ;
CJB	2%20Peter	2	11	whereas angels , though stronger and more powerful , do not bring before the Lord an insulting charge against them .
CJB	2%20Peter	2	12	But these people , acting without thinking , like animals without reason , born to be captured and destroyed , insult things about which they have no knowledge . When they are destroyed , their destruction will be total —
CJB	2%20Peter	2	13	they will be paid back harm as wages for the harm they are doing . Their idea of pleasure is carousing in broad daylight ; they are spots and defects reveling in their deceptions as they share meals with you —
CJB	2%20Peter	2	14	for they have eyes always on the lookout for a woman who will commit adultery , eyes that never stop sinning ; and they have a heart that has exercised itself in greed ; so that they seduce unstable people . What a cursed brood !
CJB	2%20Peter	2	15	These people have left the straight way and wandered off to follow the way of Bil ‘ am Ben-B ‘ or , who loved the wages of doing harm
CJB	2%20Peter	2	16	but was rebuked for his sin — a dumb beast of burden spoke out with a human voice and restrained the prophet ’ s insanity !
CJB	2%20Peter	2	17	Waterless springs they are , mists driven by a gust of wind ; for them has been reserved the blackest darkness .
CJB	2%20Peter	2	18	Mouthing grandiosities of nothingness , they play on the desires of the old nature , in order to seduce with debaucheries people who have just begun to escape from those whose way of life is wrong .
CJB	2%20Peter	2	19	They promise them freedom , but they themselves are slaves of corruption ; for a person is slave to whatever has defeated him .
CJB	2%20Peter	2	20	Indeed , if they have once escaped the pollutions of the world through knowing our Lord and Deliverer , Yeshua the Messiah , and then have again become entangled and defeated by them , their latter condition has become worse than their former .
CJB	2%20Peter	2	21	It would have been better for them not to have known the Way of righteousness than , fully knowing , to turn from the holy command delivered to them .
CJB	2%20Peter	2	22	What has happened to them accords with the true proverb , “ A dog returns to its own vomit. ” [ a ] Yes , “ The pig washed itself , only to wallow in the mud ! ” Footnotes -
CJB	2%20Peter	3	2	Peter 3:13 Isaiah 65:17 ; 66:22
CJB	2%20Peter	3	3	First , understand this : during the Last Days , scoffers will come , following their own desires
CJB	2%20Peter	3	4	and asking , “ Where is this promised ‘ coming ’ of his ? For our fathers have died , and everything goes on just as it has since the beginning of creation. ”
CJB	2%20Peter	3	5	But , wanting so much to be right about this , they overlook the fact that it was by God ’ s Word that long ago there were heavens , and there was land which arose out of water and existed between the waters ,
CJB	2%20Peter	3	6	and that by means of these things the world of that time was flooded with water and destroyed .
CJB	2%20Peter	3	7	It is by that same Word that the present heavens and earth , having been preserved , are being kept for fire until the Day of Judgment , when ungodly people will be destroyed .
CJB	2%20Peter	3	8	Moreover , dear friends , do not ignore this : with the Lord , one day is like a thousand years and a thousand years like one day [ a ]
CJB	2%20Peter	3	9	The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise , as some people think of slowness ; on the contrary , he is patient with you ; for it is not his purpose that anyone should be destroyed , but that everyone should turn from his sins .
CJB	2%20Peter	3	10	However , the Day of the Lord will come “ like a thief. ” On that Day the heavens will disappear with a roar , the elements will melt and disintegrate , and the earth and everything in it will be burned up .
CJB	2%20Peter	3	11	Since everything is going to be destroyed like this , what kind of people should you be ? You should lead holy and godly lives ,
CJB	2%20Peter	3	12	as you wait for the Day of God and work to hasten its coming . That Day will bring on the destruction of the heavens by fire , and the elements will melt from the heat ;
CJB	2%20Peter	3	13	but we , following along with his promise , wait for new heavens and a new earth , [ b ] in which righteousness will be at home .
CJB	2%20Peter	3	14	Therefore , dear friends , as you look for these things , do everything you can to be found by him without spot or defect and at peace .
CJB	2%20Peter	3	15	And think of our Lord ’ s patience as deliverance , just as our dear brother Sha ’ ul also wrote you , following the wisdom God gave him .
CJB	2%20Peter	3	16	Indeed , he speaks about these things in all his letters . They contain some things that are hard to understand , things which the uninstructed and unstable distort , to their own destruction , as they do the other Scriptures .
CJB	2%20Peter	3	17	But you , dear friends , since you know this in advance , guard yourselves ; so that you will not be led away by the errors of the wicked and fall from your own secure position .
CJB	2%20Peter	3	18	And keep growing in grace and knowledge of our Lord and Deliverer , Yeshua the Messiah . To him be the glory , both now and forever ! Amen . Footnotes -
CJB	1%20John	1	1	The Word , which gives life ! He existed from the beginning . We have heard him , we have seen him with our eyes , we have contemplated him , we have touched him with our hands !
CJB	1%20John	1	2	The life appeared , and we have seen it . We are testifying to it and announcing it to you — eternal life ! He was with the Father , and he appeared to us .
CJB	1%20John	1	3	What we have seen and heard , we are proclaiming to you ; so that you too may have fellowship with us . Our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son , Yeshua the Messiah .
CJB	1%20John	1	4	We are writing these things so that our joy may be complete .
CJB	1%20John	1	5	And this is the message which we have heard from him and proclaim to you : God is light , and there is no darkness in him — none !
CJB	1%20John	1	6	If we claim to have fellowship with him while we are walking in the darkness , we are lying and not living out the truth .
CJB	1%20John	1	7	But if we are walking in the light , as he is in the light , then we have fellowship with each other , and the blood of his Son Yeshua purifies us from all sin .
CJB	1%20John	1	8	If we claim not to have sin , we are deceiving ourselves , and the truth is not in us .
CJB	1%20John	1	9	If we acknowledge our sins , then , since he is trustworthy and just , he will forgive them and purify us from all wrongdoing .
CJB	1%20John	1	10	If we claim we have not been sinning , we are making him out to be a liar , and his Word is not in us .
CJB	1%20John	2	1	John
CJB	1%20John	2	2	Also , he is the kapparah for our sins — and not only for ours , but also for those of the whole world .
CJB	1%20John	2	3	The way we can be sure we know him is if we are obeying his commands .
CJB	1%20John	2	4	Anyone who says , “ I know him , ” but isn ’ t obeying his commands is a liar — the truth is not in him .
CJB	1%20John	2	5	But if someone keeps doing what he says , then truly love for God has been brought to its goal in him . This is how we are sure that we are united with him .
CJB	1%20John	2	6	A person who claims to be continuing in union with him ought to conduct his life the way he did .
CJB	1%20John	2	7	Dear friends , I am not writing you a new command . On the contrary , it is an old command , which you have had from the beginning ; the old command is the message which you have heard before .
CJB	1%20John	2	8	Yet I am writing you a new command , and its reality is seen both in him and in you , because the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining .
CJB	1%20John	2	9	Anyone who claims to be in this light while hating his brother is still in the dark .
CJB	1%20John	2	10	The person who keeps loving his brother remains in the light , and there is nothing in him that could make him trip .
CJB	1%20John	2	11	But the person who hates his brother is in the dark — yes , he is walking in the dark , and he doesn ’ t know where he is going , because the darkness has blinded his eyes .
CJB	1%20John	2	12	You children , I am writing you because your sins have been forgiven for his sake .
CJB	1%20John	2	13	You fathers , I am writing you because you have known him who has existed from the beginning . You young people , I am writing you because you have overcome the Evil One .
CJB	1%20John	2	14	You children , I have written you because you have known the Father . You fathers , I have written you because you have known him who has existed from the beginning . You young people , I have written you because you are strong — the Word of God remains in you , and you have overcome the Evil One .
CJB	1%20John	2	15	Do not love the world or the things of the world . If someone loves the world , then love for the Father is not in him ;
CJB	1%20John	2	16	because all the things of the world — the desires of the old nature , the desires of the eyes , and the pretensions of life — are not from the Father but from the world .
CJB	1%20John	2	17	And the world is passing away , along with its desires . But whoever does God ’ s will remains forever .
CJB	1%20John	2	18	Children , this is the Last Hour . You have heard that an Anti-Messiah is coming ; and in fact , many anti-Messiahs have arisen now — which is how we know that this is the Last Hour .
CJB	1%20John	2	19	They went out from us , but they weren ’ t part of us ; for had they been part of us , they would have remained with us .
CJB	1%20John	2	20	But you have received the Messiah ’ s anointing from HaKadosh , and you know all this .
CJB	1%20John	2	21	It is not because you don ’ t know the truth that I have written to you , but because you do know it , and because no lie has its origin in the truth .
CJB	1%20John	2	22	Who is a liar at all , if not the person who denies that Yeshua is the Messiah ? Such a person is an anti-Messiah — he is denying the Father and the Son .
CJB	1%20John	2	23	Everyone who denies the Son is also without the Father , but the person who acknowledges the Son has the Father as well .
CJB	1%20John	2	24	Let what you heard from the beginning remain in you . If what you heard from the beginning remains in you , you will also remain in union with both the Son and the Father .
CJB	1%20John	2	25	And this is what he has promised us : eternal life .
CJB	1%20John	2	26	I have written you these things about the people who are trying to deceive you .
CJB	1%20John	2	27	As for you , the Messianic anointing you received from the Father remains in you , so that you have no need for anyone to teach you . On the contrary , as his Messianic anointing continues to teach you about all things , and is true , not a counterfeit , so , just as he taught you , remain united with him .
CJB	1%20John	2	28	And now , children , remain united with him ; so that when he appears , we may have confidence and not shrink back from him in shame at his coming .
CJB	1%20John	2	29	If you know that he is righteous , you should also know that he is the Father of everyone who does what is right .
CJB	1%20John	3	1	John
CJB	1%20John	3	3	And everyone who has this hope in him continues purifying himself , since God is pure .
CJB	1%20John	3	2	Dear friends , we are God ’ s children now ; and it has not yet been made clear what we will become . We do know that when he appears , we will be like him ; because we will see him as he really is .
CJB	1%20John	3	4	Everyone who keeps sinning is violating Torah — indeed , sin is violation of Torah .
CJB	1%20John	3	5	You know that he appeared in order to take away sins , and that there is no sin in him .
CJB	1%20John	3	6	So no one who remains united with him continues sinning ; everyone who does continue sinning has neither seen him nor known him .
CJB	1%20John	3	7	Children , don ’ t let anyone deceive you — it is the person that keeps on doing what is right who is righteous , just as God is righteous .
CJB	1%20John	3	8	The person who keeps on sinning is from the Adversary , because from the very beginning the Adversary has kept on sinning . It was for this very reason that the Son of God appeared , to destroy these doings of the Adversary .
CJB	1%20John	3	9	No one who has God as his Father keeps on sinning , because the seed planted by God remains in him . That is , he can not continue sinning , because he has God as his Father .
CJB	1%20John	3	10	Here is how one can distinguish clearly between God ’ s children and those of the Adversary : everyone who does not continue doing what is right is not from God . Likewise , anyone who fails to keep loving his brother is not from God .
CJB	1%20John	3	11	For this is the message which you have heard from the beginning : that we should love each other
CJB	1%20John	3	12	and not be like Kayin , who was from the Evil One and murdered his own brother . Why did he murder him ? Because his own actions were evil , and his brother ’ s were righteous .
CJB	1%20John	3	13	Don ’ t be amazed , brothers , if the world hates you .
CJB	1%20John	3	14	We , for our part , know that we have passed from death to life because we keep loving the brothers . The person who fails to keep on loving is still under the power of death .
CJB	1%20John	3	15	Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer , and you know that no murderer has eternal life in him .
CJB	1%20John	3	16	The way that we have come to know love is through his having laid down his life for us . And we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers !
CJB	1%20John	3	17	If someone has worldly possessions and sees his brother in need , yet closes his heart against him , how can he be loving God ?
CJB	1%20John	3	18	Children , let us love not with words and talk , but with actions and in reality !
CJB	1%20John	3	19	Here is how we will know that we are from the truth and will set our hearts at rest in his presence :
CJB	1%20John	3	20	if our hearts know something against us , God is greater than our hearts , and he knows everything .
CJB	1%20John	3	21	Dear friends , if our hearts know nothing against us , we have confidence in approaching God ;
CJB	1%20John	3	22	then , whatever we ask for , we receive from him ; because we are obeying his commands and doing the things that please him .
CJB	1%20John	3	23	This is his command : that we are to trust in the person and power of his Son Yeshua the Messiah and to keep loving one another , just as he commanded us .
CJB	1%20John	3	24	Those who obey his commands remain united with him and he with them . Here is how we know that he remains united with us : by the Spirit whom he gave us .
CJB	1%20John	4	1	John
CJB	1%20John	4	4	You , children , are from God and have overcome the false prophets , because he who is in you is greater than he who is in the world .
CJB	1%20John	4	2	Here is how you recognize the Spirit of God : every spirit which acknowledges that Yeshua the Messiah came as a human being is from God ,
CJB	1%20John	4	3	and every spirit which does not acknowledge Yeshua is not from God — in fact , this is the spirit of the Anti-Messiah . You have heard that he is coming . Well , he ’ s here now , in the world already !
CJB	1%20John	4	5	They are from the world ; therefore , they speak from the world ’ s viewpoint ; and the world listens to them .
CJB	1%20John	4	6	We are from God . Whoever knows God listens to us ; whoever is not from God doesn ’ t listen to us . This is how we distinguish the Spirit of truth from the spirit of error .
CJB	1%20John	4	7	Beloved friends , let us love one another ; because love is from God ; and everyone who loves has God as his Father and knows God .
CJB	1%20John	4	8	Those who do not love , do not know God ; because God is love .
CJB	1%20John	4	9	Here is how God showed his love among us : God sent his only Son into the world , so that through him we might have life .
CJB	1%20John	4	10	Here is what love is : not that we have loved God , but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the kapparah for our sins .
CJB	1%20John	4	11	Beloved friends , if this is how God loved us , we likewise ought to love one another .
CJB	1%20John	4	12	No one has ever seen God ; if we love one another , God remains united with us , and our love for him has been brought to its goal in us .
CJB	1%20John	4	13	Here is how we know that we remain united with him and he with us : he has given to us from his own Spirit .
CJB	1%20John	4	14	Moreover , we have seen and we testify that the Father has sent his Son as Deliverer of the world .
CJB	1%20John	4	15	If someone acknowledges that Yeshua is the Son of God , God remains united with him , and he with God .
CJB	1%20John	4	16	Also we have come to know and trust the love that God has for us . God is love ; and those who remain in this love remain united with God , and God remains united with them .
CJB	1%20John	4	17	Here is how love has been brought to maturity with us : as the Messiah is , so are we in the world . This gives us confidence for the Day of Judgment .
CJB	1%20John	4	18	There is no fear in love . On the contrary , love that has achieved its goal gets rid of fear , because fear has to do with punishment ; the person who keeps fearing has not been brought to maturity in regard to love .
CJB	1%20John	4	19	We ourselves love now because he loved us first .
CJB	1%20John	4	20	If anyone says , “ I love God , ” and hates his brother , he is a liar . For if a person does not love his brother , whom he has seen , then he can not love God , whom he has not seen .
CJB	1%20John	4	21	Yes , this is the command we have from him : whoever loves God must love his brother too .
CJB	1%20John	5	1	John
CJB	1%20John	5	5	Who does overcome the world if not the person who believes that Yeshua is the Son of God ?
CJB	1%20John	5	2	Here is how we know that we love God ’ s children : when we love God , we also do what he commands .
CJB	1%20John	5	3	For loving God means obeying his commands . Moreover , his commands are not burdensome ,
CJB	1%20John	5	4	because everything which has God as its Father overcomes the world . And this is what victoriously overcomes the world : our trust .
CJB	1%20John	5	6	He is the one who came by means of water and blood , Yeshua the Messiah — not with water only , but with the water and the blood . And the Spirit bears witness , because the Spirit is the truth .
CJB	1%20John	5	7	There are three witnesses —
CJB	1%20John	5	8	the Spirit , the water and the blood — and these three are in agreement .
CJB	1%20John	5	9	If we accept human witness , God ’ s witness is stronger , because it is the witness which God has given about his Son .
CJB	1%20John	5	10	Those who keep trusting in the Son of God have this witness in them . Those who do not keep trusting God have made him out to be a liar , because they have not trusted in the witness which God has given about his Son .
CJB	1%20John	5	11	And this is the witness : God has given us eternal life , and this life is in his Son .
CJB	1%20John	5	12	Those who have the Son have the life ; those who do not have the Son of God do not have the life .
CJB	1%20John	5	13	I have written you these things so that you may know that you have eternal life — you who keep trusting in the person and power of the Son of God .
CJB	1%20John	5	14	This is the confidence we have in his presence : if we ask anything that accords with his will , he hears us .
CJB	1%20John	5	15	And if we know that he hears us — whatever we ask — then we know that we have what we have asked from him .
CJB	1%20John	5	16	If anyone sees his brother committing a sin that does not lead to death , he will ask ; and God will give him life for those whose sinning does not lead to death . There is sin that does lead to death ; I am not saying he should pray about that .
CJB	1%20John	5	17	All wrongdoing is sin , but there is sin that does not lead to death .
CJB	1%20John	5	18	We know that everyone who has God as his Father does not go on sinning ; on the contrary , the Son born of God protects him , and the Evil One does not touch him .
CJB	1%20John	5	19	We know that we are from God , and that the whole world lies in the power of the Evil One .
CJB	1%20John	5	20	And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us discernment , so that we may know who is genuine ; moreover , we are united with the One who is genuine , united with his Son Yeshua the Messiah . He is the genuine God and eternal life .
CJB	1%20John	5	21	Children , guard yourselves against false gods !
CJB	2%20John	1	2	because of the Truth which remains united with us and will be with us forever :
CJB	2%20John	1	1	From : The Elder To : The chosen lady and her children , whom I love in truth — and not only I but also all who have come to know the truth —
CJB	2%20John	1	3	Grace , mercy and shalom will be with us from God the Father and from Yeshua the Messiah , the Son of the Father , in truth and love .
CJB	2%20John	1	4	I was very happy when I found some of your children living in truth , just as the Father commanded us .
CJB	2%20John	1	5	And now , dear lady , I am requesting that we love one another — not as if this were a new command I am writing you , for it is the one which we have had from the beginning .
CJB	2%20John	1	6	Moreover , love is this : that we should live according to his commands . This is the command , as you people have heard from the beginning ; live by it !
CJB	2%20John	1	7	For many deceivers have gone out into the world , people who do not acknowledge Yeshua the Messiah ’ s coming as a human being . Such a person is a deceiver and an anti-Messiah .
CJB	2%20John	1	8	Watch yourselves , so that you won ’ t lose what you have worked for , but will receive your full reward .
CJB	2%20John	1	9	Everyone who goes ahead and does not remain true to what the Messiah has taught does not have God . Those who remain true to his teaching have both the Father and the Son .
CJB	2%20John	1	10	If someone comes to you and does not bring this teaching , don ’ t welcome him into your home . Don ’ t even say , “ Shalom ! ” to him ;
CJB	2%20John	1	11	for the person who says , “ Shalom ! ” to him shares in his evil deeds .
CJB	2%20John	1	12	Although I have much to write you people , I would rather not use paper and ink . Instead , I hope to come and see you and to talk with you face to face , so that our joy may be complete .
CJB	2%20John	1	13	The children of your chosen sister send you their greetings .
CJB	3%20John	1	3	For I was so happy when some brothers came and testified how faithful you are to the truth , as you continue living in the truth .
CJB	3%20John	1	1	From : The Elder To : Dear Gaius , whom I love in truth :
CJB	3%20John	1	2	Dear friend , I am praying that everything prosper with you and that you be in good health , as I know you are prospering spiritually .
CJB	3%20John	1	4	Nothing gives me greater joy than hearing that my children are living in the truth .
CJB	3%20John	1	5	Dear friend , you are faithful in all the work you are doing for the brothers , even when they are strangers to you .
CJB	3%20John	1	6	They have testified to your love in front of the congregation . You will be doing well if you send them on their way in a manner worthy of God ,
CJB	3%20John	1	7	since it was for the sake of HaShem that they went out without accepting anything from the Goyim .
CJB	3%20John	1	8	It is we , therefore , who should support such people ; so that we may share in their work for the truth .
CJB	3%20John	1	9	I wrote something to the congregation ; but Diotrephes , who likes to be the macher among them , doesn ’ t recognize our authority .
CJB	3%20John	1	10	So if I come , I will bring up everything he is doing , including his spiteful and groundless gossip about us . And as if that weren ’ t enough for him , he refuses to recognize the brothers ’ authority either ; moreover , he stops those who want to do so and tries to drive them out of the congregation !
CJB	3%20John	1	11	Dear friend , don ’ t imitate the bad , but the good . Those who do what is good are from God ; those who do what is bad are not from God .
CJB	3%20John	1	12	Everyone speaks well of Demetrius , and so does the truth itself . We vouch for him , and you know that our testimony is true .
CJB	3%20John	1	13	I have much to write you , but I don ’ t want to write with pen and ink ;
CJB	3%20John	1	14	however , I am hoping to see you very soon , and we will speak face to face . Shalom to you . Your friends send you their greetings . Greet each of our friends by name .
CJB	Jude	1	1	From : Y ’ hudah , a slave of Yeshua the Messiah and a brother of Ya ‘ akov To : Those who have been called , who are loved by God the Father and kept for Yeshua the Messiah :
CJB	Jude	1	2	May mercy , love and shalom be yours in full measure .
CJB	Jude	1	3	Dear friends , I was busily at work writing to you about the salvation we share , when I found it necessary to write , urging you to keep contending earnestly for the faith which was once and for all passed on to God ’ s people .
CJB	Jude	1	4	For certain individuals , the ones written about long ago as being meant for this condemnation , have wormed their way in — ungodly people who pervert God ’ s grace into a license for debauchery and disown our only Master and Lord , Yeshua the Messiah .
CJB	Jude	1	5	Since you already know all this , my purpose is only to remind you that Adonai , who once delivered the people from Egypt , later destroyed those who did not trust .
CJB	Jude	1	6	And the angels that did not keep within their original authority , but abandoned their proper sphere , he has kept in darkness , bound with everlasting chains for the Judgment of the Great Day .
CJB	Jude	1	7	And S ’ dom , ‘ Amora and the surrounding cities , following a pattern like theirs , committing sexual sins and perversions , lie exposed as a warning of the everlasting fire awaiting those who must undergo punishment .
CJB	Jude	1	8	Likewise , these people , with their visions , defile their own flesh , despise godly authority and insult angelic beings .
CJB	Jude	1	9	When Mikha ’ el , one of the ruling angels , took issue with the Adversary , arguing over the body of Moshe , he did not dare bring against him an insulting charge , but said , “ May Adonai rebuke you. ”
CJB	Jude	1	10	However , these people insult anything they don ’ t understand ; and what they do understand naturally , without thinking , like animals — by these things they are destroyed !
CJB	Jude	1	11	Woe to them , in that they have walked the road of Kayin , they have given themselves over for money to the error of Bil ‘ am , they have been destroyed in the rebellion of Korach .
CJB	Jude	1	12	These men are filthy spots at your festive gatherings meant to foster love ; they share your meals without a qualm , while caring only for themselves . They are waterless clouds carried along by the winds ; trees without fruit even in autumn , and doubly dead because they have been uprooted ;
CJB	Jude	1	13	savage sea-waves heaving forth their shameful deeds like foam ; wandering stars for whom the blackest darkness has been reserved forever .
CJB	Jude	1	14	Moreover , Hanokh , in the seventh generation starting with Adam , also prophesied about these men , saying , “ Look ! Adonai came with his myriads of holy ones
CJB	Jude	1	15	to execute judgment against everyone , that is , to convict all the godless for their godless deeds which they have done in such a godless way , and for all the harsh words these godless sinners have spoken against him. ”
CJB	Jude	1	16	These people are grumblers and complainers , they follow their evil passions , their mouths speak grandiosities , and they flatter others to gain advantage .
CJB	Jude	1	17	But you , dear friends , keep in mind the words spoken in advance by the emissaries of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah .
CJB	Jude	1	18	They told you , “ During the acharit-hayamim there will be scoffers following their own godless passions. ”
CJB	Jude	1	19	These are the people who cause divisions . They are controlled by their impulses , because they don ’ t have the Spirit .
CJB	Jude	1	20	But you , dear friends , build yourselves up in your most holy faith , and pray in union with the Ruach HaKodesh .
CJB	Jude	1	21	Thus keep yourselves in God ’ s love , as you wait for our Lord Yeshua the Messiah to give you the mercy that leads to eternal life .
CJB	Jude	1	22	Rebuke some who are disputing ;
CJB	Jude	1	23	save others , snatching them out of the fire ; and to yet others , show mercy , but with fear , hating even the clothes stained by their vices .
CJB	Jude	1	24	Now , to the one who can keep you from falling and set you without defect and full of joy in the presence of his Sh ’ khinah —
CJB	Jude	1	25	to God alone , our Deliverer , through Yeshua the Messiah , our Lord — be glory , majesty , power and authority before all time , now and forever . Amen .
CJB	Revelation	1	1	This is the revelation which God gave to Yeshua the Messiah , so that he could show his servants what must happen very soon . He communicated it by sending his angel to his servant Yochanan ,
CJB	Revelation	1	2	who bore witness to the Word of God and to the testimony of Yeshua the Messiah , as much as he saw .
CJB	Revelation	1	3	Blessed are the reader and hearers of the words of this prophecy , provided they obey the things written in it ! For the time is near !
CJB	Revelation	1	4	From : Yochanan To : The seven Messianic communities in the province of Asia : Grace and shalom to you from the One who is , who was and who is coming ; from the sevenfold Spirit before his throne ;
CJB	Revelation	1	5	and from Yeshua the Messiah , the faithful witness , the firstborn from the dead and the ruler of the earth ’ s kings . To him , the one who loves us , who has freed us from our sins at the cost of his blood ,
CJB	Revelation	1	6	who has caused us to be a kingdom , that is , cohanim for God , his Father — to him be the glory and the rulership forever and ever . Amen .
CJB	Revelation	1	7	Look ! He is coming with the clouds ! [ a ] Every eye will see him , including those who pierced him ; and all the tribes of the Land will mourn him . [ b ] Yes ! Amen !
CJB	Revelation	1	8	“ I am the ‘ A ’ and the ‘ Z , ’ ” says Adonai , God of heaven ’ s armies , the One who is , who was and who is coming .
CJB	Revelation	1	9	I , Yochanan , am a brother of yours and a fellow-sharer in the suffering , kingship and perseverance that come from being united with Yeshua . I had been exiled to the island called Patmos for having proclaimed the message of God and borne witness to Yeshua .
CJB	Revelation	1	10	I came to be , in the Spirit , on the Day of the Lord ; and I heard behind me a loud voice , like a trumpet ,
CJB	Revelation	1	11	saying , “ Write down what you see on a scroll , and send it to the seven Messianic communities — Ephesus , Smyrna , Pergamum , Thyatira , Sardis , Philadelphia and Laodicea ! ”
CJB	Revelation	1	12	I turned around to see who was speaking to me ; and when I had turned , I saw seven gold menorahs ;
CJB	Revelation	1	13	and among the menorahs was someone like a Son of Man , wearing a robe down to his feet and a gold band around his chest . [ c ]
CJB	Revelation	1	14	His head and hair were as white as snow-white wool , his eyes like a fiery flame ,
CJB	Revelation	1	15	his feet like burnished brass refined in a furnace , and his voice like the sound of rushing waters . [ d ]
CJB	Revelation	1	16	In his right hand he held seven stars , out of his mouth went a sharp double-edged sword , and his face was like the sun shining in full strength .
CJB	Revelation	1	17	When I saw him , I fell down at his feet like a dead man . He placed his right hand upon me and said , “ Don ’ t be afraid ! I am the First and the Last ,
CJB	Revelation	1	18	the Living One . I was dead , but look ! — I am alive forever and ever ! And I hold the keys to Death and Sh ’ ol .
CJB	Revelation	1	19	So write down what you see , both what is now , and what will happen afterwards .
CJB	Revelation	1	20	Here is the secret meaning of the seven stars you saw in my right hand , and of the seven gold menorahs : the seven stars are the angels of the seven Messianic communities , and the seven menorahs are the seven Messianic communities .

CJB	Revelation	2	2	“ I know what you have been doing , how hard you have worked , how you have persevered , and how you can ’ t stand wicked people ; so you tested those who call themselves emissaries but aren ’ t — and you found them to be liars .
CJB	Revelation	2	3	You are persevering , and you have suffered for my sake without growing weary .
CJB	Revelation	2	4	But I have this against you : you have lost the love you had at first .
CJB	Revelation	2	5	Therefore , remember where you were before you fell , turn from this sin , and do what you used to do before . Otherwise , I will come to you and remove your menorah from its place — if you don ’ t turn from your sin !
CJB	Revelation	2	6	But you have this in your favor : you hate what the Nicolaitans do — I hate it too .
CJB	Revelation	2	7	Those who have ears , let them hear what the Spirit is saying to the Messianic communities . To him winning the victory I will give the right to eat from the Tree of Life which is in God ’ s Gan- ‘ Eden. ” ’
CJB	Revelation	2	8	“ To the angel of the Messianic Community in Smyrna , write : ‘ Here is the message from the First and the Last , who died and came alive again :

CJB	Revelation	2	10	Don ’ t be afraid of what you are about to suffer . Look , the Adversary is going to have some of you thrown in prison , in order to put you to the test ; and you will face an ordeal for ten days . Remain faithful , even to the point of death ; and I will give you life as your crown .
CJB	Revelation	2	11	Those who have ears , let them hear what the Spirit is saying to the Messianic communities . He who wins the victory will not be hurt at all by the second death. ” ’
CJB	Revelation	2	12	“ To the angel of the Messianic Community in Pergamum , write : ‘ Here is the message from the one who has the sharp double-edged sword :
CJB	Revelation	2	13	“ I know where you are living , there where the Adversary ’ s throne is . Yet you are holding onto my name . You did not deny trusting me even at the time when my faithful witness Antipas was put to death in your town , there where the Adversary lives .
CJB	Revelation	2	14	Nevertheless , I have a few things against you : you have some people who hold to the teaching of Bil ‘ am , who taught Balak to set a trap for the people of Isra ’ el , so that they would eat food that had been sacrificed to idols and commit sexual sin .
CJB	Revelation	2	15	Likewise , you too have people who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans .
CJB	Revelation	2	16	Therefore , turn from these sins . Otherwise , I will come to you very soon and make war against them with the sword of my mouth .
CJB	Revelation	2	17	Those who have ears , let them hear what the Spirit is saying to the Messianic communities . To him winning the victory I will give some of the hidden man . I will also give him a white stone , on which is written a new name that nobody knows except the one receiving it. ” ’
CJB	Revelation	2	18	“ To the angel of the Messianic Community in Thyatira , write : ‘ Here is the message from the Son of God , whose eyes are like a fiery flame and whose feet are like burnished brass :
CJB	Revelation	2	19	I know what you are doing , your love , trust , service and perseverance . And I know that you are doing more now than before .
CJB	Revelation	2	20	But I have this against you : you continue to tolerate that Izevel woman , the one who claims to be a prophet , but is teaching and deceiving my servants to commit sexual sin and eat food that has been sacrificed to idols .
CJB	Revelation	2	21	I gave her time to turn from her sin , but she doesn ’ t want to repent of her immorality .
CJB	Revelation	2	22	So I am throwing her into a sickbed ; and those who commit adultery with her I am throwing into great trouble , unless they turn from the sins connected with what she does ;
CJB	Revelation	2	23	and I will strike her children dead ! Then all the Messianic communities will know that I am the one who searches minds and hearts , and that I will give to each of you what your deeds deserve .
CJB	Revelation	2	24	But to the rest of you in Thyatira , to those who do not hold this teaching , who have not learned what some people call the ‘ deep things ’ of the Adversary , I say this : I am not loading you up with another burden ;
CJB	Revelation	2	25	only hold fast to what you have until I come .
CJB	Revelation	2	26	To him who wins the victory and does what I want until the goal is reached , I will give him authority over the nations ;
CJB	Revelation	2	27	he will rule them with a staff of iron and dash them to pieces like pottery , [ a ]
CJB	Revelation	2	28	just as I have received authority from my Father . I will also give him the morning star .

CJB	Revelation	3	3	So remember what you received and heard , and obey it , and turn from your sin ! For if you don ’ t wake up , I will come like a thief ; and you don ’ t know at what moment I will come upon you .
CJB	Revelation	3	2	Wake up , and strengthen what remains , before it dies too ! For I have found what you are doing incomplete in the sight of my God .
CJB	Revelation	3	4	Nevertheless , you do have a few people in Sardis who have not soiled their clothes ; and they will walk with me , clothed in white , because they are worthy .
CJB	Revelation	3	5	He who wins the victory will , like them , be dressed in white clothing ; and I will not blot his name out of the Book of Life ; in fact , I will acknowledge him individually before my Father and before his angels .

CJB	Revelation	4	4	Surrounding the throne were twenty-four other thrones , and on the thrones sat twenty-four elders dressed in white clothing and wearing gold crowns on their heads .
CJB	Revelation	4	2	Instantly I was in the Spirit , and there before me in heaven stood a throne , and on the throne Someone was sitting .
CJB	Revelation	4	3	The One sitting there gleamed like diamonds and rubies , and a rainbow shining like emerald encircled the throne .
CJB	Revelation	4	5	From the throne came forth lightnings , voices and thunderings ; and before the throne were seven flaming torches , which are the sevenfold Spirit of God .
CJB	Revelation	4	6	In front of the throne was what looked like a sea of glass , clear as crystal . In the center , around the throne , were four living beings covered with eyes in front and behind .
CJB	Revelation	4	7	The first living being was like a lion , the second living being was like an ox , the third living being had a face that looked human , and the fourth living being was like a flying eagle . [ a ]

CJB	Revelation	5	7	He came and took the scroll out of the right hand of the One sitting on the throne .
CJB	Revelation	5	8	When he took the scroll , the four living beings and the twenty-four elders fell down in front of the Lamb . Each one held a harp and gold bowls filled with pieces of incense , which are the prayers of God ’ s people ;

CJB	Revelation	5	13	And I heard every creature in heaven , on earth , under the earth and on the sea — yes , everything in them — saying , “ To the One sitting on the throne and to the Lamb belong praise , honor , glory and power forever and ever ! ”
CJB	Revelation	5	14	The four living beings said , “ Amen ! ” and the elders fell down and worshipped .
CJB	Revelation	6	6	Then I heard what sounded like a voice from among the four living beings say , “ Two pounds of wheat for a day ’ s wages ! Six pounds of barley for the same price ! But don ’ t damage the oil or the wine ! ”
CJB	Revelation	6	2	I looked , and there in front of me was a white horse ; its rider had a bow and was given a crown ; and he rode off as a conqueror to conquer .
CJB	Revelation	6	3	When he broke the second seal , I heard the second living being say , “ Go ! ”
CJB	Revelation	6	4	Another horse went out , a red one ; and its rider was given the power to take peace away from the earth and make people slaughter each other . He was given a great sword .
CJB	Revelation	6	5	When he broke the third seal , I heard the third living being say , “ Go ! ” I looked , and there in front of me was a black horse , and its rider held in his hand a pair of scales .
CJB	Revelation	6	7	When he broke the fourth seal , I heard the voice of the fourth living being say , “ Go ! ”
CJB	Revelation	6	8	I looked , and there in front of me was a pallid , sickly-looking horse . Its rider ’ s name was Death , and Sh ’ ol followed behind him . They were given authority to kill one-quarter of the world by war , by famine , by plagues and with the wild animals of the earth .
CJB	Revelation	6	9	When the Lamb broke the fifth seal , I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been put to death for proclaiming the Word of God , that is , for bearing witness .
CJB	Revelation	6	10	They cried out in a loud voice , “ Sovereign Ruler , HaKadosh , the True One , how long will it be before you judge the people living on earth and avenge our blood ? ”
CJB	Revelation	6	11	Each of them was given a white robe ; and they were told to wait a little longer , until the full number of their fellow-servants should be reached , of their brothers who would be killed , just as they had been .
CJB	Revelation	6	12	Then I watched as he broke the sixth seal , and there was a great earthquake , the sun turned black as sackcloth worn in mourning , and the full moon became blood-red .
CJB	Revelation	6	13	The stars fell from heaven to earth just as a fig tree drops its figs when shaken by a strong wind .
CJB	Revelation	6	14	The sky receded like a scroll being rolled up , and every mountain and island was moved from its place .
CJB	Revelation	6	15	Then the earth ’ s kings , the rulers , the generals , the rich and the mighty — indeed , everyone , slave and free — hid himself in caves and among the rocks in the mountains ,
CJB	Revelation	6	16	and said to the mountains and rocks , “ Fall on us , and hide us [ a ] from the face of the One sitting on the throne and from the fury of the Lamb !
CJB	Revelation	6	17	For the Great Day of their fury has come , and who can stand ? ” Footnotes - Revelation 6:16 Hosea 10:8
CJB	Revelation	7	7	After this , I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth , holding back the four winds of the earth , so that no wind would blow on the land , on the sea or on any tree .
CJB	Revelation	7	2	I saw another angel coming up from the east with a seal from the living God , and he shouted to the four angels who had been given power to harm the land and the sea ,
CJB	Revelation	7	3	“ Do not harm the land or the sea or the trees until we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads ! ”
CJB	Revelation	7	4	I heard how many were sealed — 144,000 from every tribe of the people of Isra ’ el : |5 From the tribe of Y ’ hudah||12,000 were sealed| |from the tribe of Re ’ uven||12,000| |from the tribe of Gad , ||12,000| |6 from the tribe of Asher||12,000| |from the tribe of Naftali||12,000| |from the tribe of M ’ nasheh||12,000| |7 from the tribe of Shim ‘ on||12,000| |from the tribe of Levi||12,000| |from the tribe of Yissakhar||12,000| |8 from the tribe of Z ’ vulun||12,000| |from the tribe of Yosef||12,000| |from the tribe of Binyamin||12,000|
CJB	Revelation	7	9	After this , I looked ; and there before me was a huge crowd , too large for anyone to count , from every nation , tribe , people and language . They were standing in front of the throne and in front of the Lamb , dressed in white robes and holding palm branches in their hands ;
CJB	Revelation	7	10	and they shouted , “ Victory to our God , who sits on the throne , and to the Lamb ! ”
CJB	Revelation	7	11	All the angels stood around the throne , the elders and the four living beings ; they fell face down before the throne and worshipped God , saying ,
CJB	Revelation	7	12	“ Amen ! “ Praise and glory , wisdom and thanks , honor and power and strength belong to our God forever and ever ! “ Amen ! ”
CJB	Revelation	7	13	One of the elders asked me , “ These people dressed in white robes — who are they , and where are they from ? ”
CJB	Revelation	7	14	“ Sir , ” I answered , “ you know. ” Then he told me , “ These are the people who have come out of the Great Persecution . They have washed their robes and made them white with the blood of the Lamb .
CJB	Revelation	7	15	That is why they are before God ’ s throne . “ Day and night they serve him in his Temple ; and the One who sits on the throne will put his Sh ’ khinah upon them .
CJB	Revelation	7	16	“ They will never again be hungry , they will never again be thirsty , the sun will not beat down on them , nor will any burning heat . [ a ]
CJB	Revelation	7	17	“ For the Lamb at the center of the throne will shepherd them , will lead them to springs of living water , [ b ] and God will wipe every tear from their eyes. ” [ c ] Footnotes - Revelation 7:16 Isaiah 49:10 - Revelation 7:17 Isaiah 49:10 ; Jeremiah 2:13 ; Ezekiel 34:23 ; Psalm 23:1–2 - Revelation 7:17 Isaiah 25:8
CJB	Revelation	8	8	The second angel sounded his shofar , and what looked like an enormous blazing mountain was hurled into the sea . A third of the sea turned to blood ,
CJB	Revelation	8	2	Then I saw the seven angels who stand before God , and they were given seven shofars .
CJB	Revelation	8	3	Another angel came and stood at the altar with a gold incense-bowl , and he was given a large quantity of incense to add to the prayers of all God ’ s people
CJB	Revelation	8	4	on the gold altar in front of the throne . The smoke of the incense went up with the prayers of God ’ s people from the hand of the angel before God .
CJB	Revelation	8	5	Then the angel took the incense-bowl , filled it with fire from the altar and threw it down onto the earth ; and there followed peals of thunder , voices , flashes of lightning and an earthquake .
CJB	Revelation	8	6	Now the seven angels with the seven shofars prepared to sound them .
CJB	Revelation	8	7	The first one sounded his shofar ; and there came hail and fire mingled with blood , and it was thrown down upon the earth . A third of the earth was burned up , a third of the trees were burned up , and all green grass was burned up .
CJB	Revelation	8	9	a third of the living creatures in the sea died , and a third of the ships were destroyed .
CJB	Revelation	8	10	The third angel sounded his shofar ; and a great star , blazing like a torch , fell from the sky onto a third of the rivers and onto the springs of water .
CJB	Revelation	8	11	The name of the star was “ Bitterness , ” and a third of the water became bitter , and many people died from the water that had been turned bitter .
CJB	Revelation	8	12	The fourth angel sounded his shofar ; and a third of the sun was struck , also a third of the moon and a third of the stars ; so that a third of them were darkened , the day had a third less light , and the night likewise .
CJB	Revelation	8	13	Then I looked , and I heard a lone eagle give a loud cry , as it flew in mid-heaven , “ Woe ! Woe ! Woe to the people living on earth , because of the remaining blasts from the three angels who have yet to sound their shofars ! ”
CJB	Revelation	9	9	Their chests were like iron breastplates , and the sound their wings made was like the roar of many horses and chariots rushing into battle .
CJB	Revelation	9	2	He opened the shaft of the Abyss , and there went up smoke from the shaft like the smoke of a huge furnace ; the sun was darkened , and the sky too , by the smoke from the shaft .
CJB	Revelation	9	3	Then out of the smoke onto the earth came locusts , and they were given power like the power scorpions have on earth .
CJB	Revelation	9	4	They were instructed not to harm the grass on the earth , any green plant or any tree , but only the people who did not have the seal of God on their foreheads .
CJB	Revelation	9	5	The locusts were not allowed to kill them , only to inflict pain on them for five months ; and the pain they caused was like the pain of a scorpion sting .
CJB	Revelation	9	6	In those days people will seek death but will not find it ; they will long to die , but death will elude them .
CJB	Revelation	9	7	Now these locusts looked like horses outfitted for battle . On their heads were what looked like crowns of gold , and their faces were like human faces .
CJB	Revelation	9	8	They had hair like women ’ s hair , and their teeth were like those of lions .
CJB	Revelation	9	10	They had tails like those of scorpions , with stings ; and in their tails was their power to hurt people for five months .
CJB	Revelation	9	11	They had as king over them the angel of the Abyss , whose name in Hebrew is “ Abaddon ” and in our language , “ Destroyer. ”
CJB	Revelation	9	12	The first woe has passed , but there are still two woes to come .
CJB	Revelation	9	13	The sixth angel sounded his shofar , and I heard a voice from the four horns of the gold altar before God ,
CJB	Revelation	9	14	saying to the sixth angel , the one with the shofar , “ Release the four angels that are bound at the great river Euphrates ! ”
CJB	Revelation	9	15	And they were released . These four angels had been kept ready for this moment , for this day and month and year , to kill a third of mankind ;
CJB	Revelation	9	16	and the number of cavalry soldiers was two hundred million ! — I heard the number .
CJB	Revelation	9	17	Here is how the horses looked in the vision : the riders had breastplates that were fire-red , iris-blue and sulfur-yellow ; the horses ’ heads were like lions ’ heads ; and from their mouths issued fire , smoke and sulfur .
CJB	Revelation	9	18	It was these three plagues that killed a third of mankind — the fire , smoke and sulfur issuing from the horses ’ mouths .
CJB	Revelation	9	19	For the power of the horses was in their mouths — and also in their tails , for their tails were like snakes with heads , and with them they could cause injury .
CJB	Revelation	9	20	The rest of mankind , those who were not killed by these plagues , even then did not turn from what they had made with their own hands — they did not stop worshipping demons and idols made of gold , silver , bronze , stone and wood , which can not see or hear or walk . [ a ]
CJB	Revelation	9	21	Nor did they turn from their murdering , their involvement with the occult and with drugs , their sexual immorality or their stealing . Footnotes - Revelation 9:20 Psalms 115:4–7 ; 135:15–17 ; Daniel 5:23
CJB	Revelation	10	10	I took the little scroll from the angel ’ s hand and ate it ; and in my mouth it was sweet as honey ; but after I had swallowed it , my stomach turned bitter .
CJB	Revelation	10	2	and he had a little scroll lying open in his hand . He planted his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land ,
CJB	Revelation	10	3	and shouted in a voice as loud as the roar of a lion ; and when he shouted , seven thunderclaps sounded with voices that spoke .
CJB	Revelation	10	4	When the seven thunders spoke , I was about to write ; but I heard a voice from heaven say , “ Seal up the things the seven thunders said , do not write them down ! ”
CJB	Revelation	10	5	Then the angel I saw standing on the sea and on the land lifted his right hand toward heaven
CJB	Revelation	10	6	and swore by the One who lives forever and ever , [ a ] who created heaven and what is in it , earth and what is in it , and the sea and what is in it : [ b ] “ There will be no more delay ;
CJB	Revelation	10	7	on the contrary , in the days of the sound from the seventh angel when he sounds his shofar , the hidden plan of God will be brought to completion , the Good News as he proclaimed it to his servants the prophets. ”
CJB	Revelation	10	8	Next the voice which I had heard from heaven spoke to me again and said , “ Go , take the scroll lying open in the hand of the angel standing on the sea and on the land ! ”
CJB	Revelation	10	9	So I went over to the angel and asked him to give me the little scroll ; and he said to me , “ Take it and eat it . It will turn your stomach bitter , but in your mouth it will be sweet as honey. ”
CJB	Revelation	10	11	Then I was told , “ You must prophesy again about many peoples , nations , languages and kings. ” Footnotes - Revelation 10:6 Deuteronomy 32:40 ; Daniel 12:7 - Revelation 10:6 Nehemiah 9:6 ; see also Exodus 20:11 ; Psalm 146:6
CJB	Revelation	11	11	But after the three-and-a-half days a breath of life from God entered them , they stood up on their feet , and great fear fell on those who saw them .
CJB	Revelation	11	2	But the court outside the Temple , leave that out ; don ’ t measure it ; because it has been given to the Goyim , and they will trample over the holy city for forty-two months .
CJB	Revelation	11	3	“ Also I will give power to my two witnesses ; and they will prophesy for 1,260 days , dressed in sackcloth. ”
CJB	Revelation	11	4	These are the two olive trees and the two menorahs standing before the Lord of the earth .
CJB	Revelation	11	5	If anyone tries to do them harm , fire comes out of their mouth and consumes their enemies — yes , if anyone tries to harm them , that is how he must die .
CJB	Revelation	11	6	They have the authority to shut up the sky , so that no rain falls during the period of their prophesying ; also they have the authority to turn the waters into blood and to strike the earth with every kind of plague as often as they want .
CJB	Revelation	11	7	When they finish their witnessing , the beast coming up out of the Abyss will fight against them , overcome them and kill them ;
CJB	Revelation	11	8	and their dead bodies will lie in the main street of the great city whose name , to reflect its spiritual condition , is “ S ’ dom ” and “ Egypt ” — the city where their Lord was executed on a stake .
CJB	Revelation	11	9	Some from the nations , tribes , languages and peoples see their bodies for three-and-a-half days and do not permit the corpses to be placed in a tomb .
CJB	Revelation	11	10	The people living in the Land rejoice over them , they celebrate and send each other gifts , because these two prophets tormented them so .
CJB	Revelation	11	12	Then the two heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them , “ Come up here ! ” And they went up into heaven in a cloud , while their enemies watched them .
CJB	Revelation	11	13	In that hour there was a great earthquake , and a tenth of the city collapsed . Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake , and the rest were awestruck and gave glory to the God of heaven .
CJB	Revelation	11	14	The second woe has passed ; see , the third woe is coming quickly
CJB	Revelation	11	15	The seventh angel sounded his shofar ; and there were loud voices in heaven , saying , “ The kingdom of the world has become the Kingdom of our Lord and his Messiah , and he will rule forever and ever ! ”
CJB	Revelation	11	16	The twenty-four elders sitting on their thrones in God ’ s presence fell on their faces and worshipped God ,
CJB	Revelation	11	17	saying , “ We thank you , Adonai , God of heaven ’ s armies , [ a ] the One who is and was , that you have taken your power and have begun to rule .
CJB	Revelation	11	18	“ The Goyim raged . [ b ] But now your rage has come , the time for the dead to be judged , the time for rewarding your servants the prophets and your holy people , those who stand in awe of your name , both small and great . It is also the time for destroying those who destroy the earth. ”
CJB	Revelation	11	19	Then the Temple of God in heaven was opened , and the Ark of the Covenant was seen in his Temple ; and there were flashes of lightning , voices , peals of thunder , an earthquake and violent hail . Footnotes - Revelation 11:17 Amos 3:13 ; 4:13 - Revelation 11:18 Psalm 2:1
CJB	Revelation	12	12	“ Therefore , rejoice , heaven and you who live there ! But woe to you , land and sea , for the Adversary has come down to you , and he is very angry , because he knows that his time is short ! ”
CJB	Revelation	12	2	She was pregnant and about to give birth , and she screamed in the agony of labor .
CJB	Revelation	12	3	Another sign was seen in heaven there was a great red dragon with seven heads and ten horns , and on his heads were seven royal crowns .
CJB	Revelation	12	4	Its tail swept a third of the stars out of heaven and threw them down to the earth . It stood in front of the woman about to give birth , so that it might devour the child the moment it was born .
CJB	Revelation	12	5	She gave birth to a son , a male child , the one who will rule all the nations with a staff of iron . [ a ] But her child was snatched up to God and his throne ;
CJB	Revelation	12	6	and she fled into the desert , where she has a place prepared by God so that she can be taken care of for 1,260 days .
CJB	Revelation	12	7	Next there was a battle in heaven — Mikha ’ el and his angels fought against the dragon , and the dragon and his angels fought back .
CJB	Revelation	12	8	But it was not strong enough to win , so that there was no longer any place for them in heaven .
CJB	Revelation	12	9	The great dragon was thrown out , that ancient serpent , also known as the Devil and Satan [ the Adversary ] , the deceiver of the whole world . He was hurled down to the earth , and his angels were hurled down with him .
CJB	Revelation	12	10	Then I heard a loud voice in heaven saying , “ Now have come God ’ s victory , power and kingship , and the authority of his Messiah ; because the Accuser of our brothers , who accuses them day and night before God , has been thrown out !
CJB	Revelation	12	11	“ They defeated him because of the Lamb ’ s blood and because of the message of their witness . Even when facing death they did not cling to life .
CJB	Revelation	12	13	When the dragon saw that he had been hurled down to the earth , he went in pursuit of the woman who had given birth to the male child .
CJB	Revelation	12	14	But the woman was given the two wings of the great eagle , so that she could fly to her place in the desert , where she is taken care of for a season and two seasons and half a season , [ b ] away from the serpent ’ s presence .
CJB	Revelation	12	15	The serpent spewed water like a river out of its mouth after the woman , in order to sweep her away in the flood ;
CJB	Revelation	12	16	but the land came to her rescue — it opened its mouth and swallowed up the river which the dragon had spewed out of its mouth .
CJB	Revelation	12	17	The dragon was infuriated over the woman and went off to fight the rest of her children , those who obey God ’ s commands and bear witness to Yeshua .
CJB	Revelation	12	18	Then the dragon stood on the seashore ; Footnotes - Revelation 12:5 Psalm 2:9 - Revelation 12:14 Daniel 7:25 ; 12:7
CJB	Revelation	13	13	It performs great miracles , even causing fire to come down from heaven onto the earth as people watch .
CJB	Revelation	13	2	The beast which I saw was like a leopard , but with feet like those of a bear and a mouth like the mouth of a lion . To it the dragon gave its power , its throne and great authority .
CJB	Revelation	13	3	One of the heads of the beast appeared to have received a fatal wound , but its fatal wound was healed , and the whole earth followed after the beast in amazement .
CJB	Revelation	13	4	They worshipped the dragon , because he had given his authority to the beast ; and they worshipped the beast , saying , “ Who is like the beast ? Who can fight against it ? ”
CJB	Revelation	13	5	It was given a mouth speaking arrogant blasphemies ; and it was given authority to act for forty-two months .
CJB	Revelation	13	6	So it opened its mouth in blasphemies against God to insult his name and his Sh ’ khinah , and those living in heaven ;
CJB	Revelation	13	7	it was allowed to make war on God ’ s holy people and to defeat them ; and it was given authority over every tribe , people , language and nation .
CJB	Revelation	13	8	Everyone living on earth will worship it except those whose names are written in the Book of Life belonging to the Lamb slaughtered before the world was founded .
CJB	Revelation	13	9	Those who have ears , let them hear !
CJB	Revelation	13	10	“ If anyone is meant for captivity , into captivity he goes ! If anyone is to be killed with the sword , with the sword he is to be killed ! ” [ a ] This is when God ’ s holy people must persevere and trust !
CJB	Revelation	13	11	Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth . It had two horns like those of a lamb , but it spoke like a dragon .
CJB	Revelation	13	12	It exercises all the authority of the first beast in its presence ; and it makes the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast , the one whose fatal wound had been healed .
CJB	Revelation	13	14	It deceives the people living on earth by the miracles it is allowed to perform in the presence of the beast , and it tells them to make an image honoring the beast that was struck by the sword but came alive again .
CJB	Revelation	13	15	It was allowed to put breath into the image of the beast , so that the image of the beast could even speak ; and it was allowed to cause anyone who would not worship the image of the beast to be put to death .
CJB	Revelation	13	16	Also it forces everyone — great and small , rich and poor , free and slave — to receive a mark on his right hand or on his forehead
CJB	Revelation	13	17	preventing anyone from buying or selling unless he has the mark , that is , the name of the beast or the number of its name .
CJB	Revelation	13	18	This is where wisdom is needed ; those who understand should count the number of the beast , for it is the number of a person , and its number is
CJB	Revelation	13	666	. Footnotes - Revelation 13:10 Jeremiah 15:2 , 43:11
CJB	Revelation	14	14	Then I looked , and there before me was a white cloud . Sitting on the cloud was someone like a Son of Man [ b ] with a gold crown on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand .
CJB	Revelation	14	2	I heard a sound from heaven like the sound of rushing waters and like the sound of pealing thunder ; the sound I heard was also like that of harpists playing on their harps .
CJB	Revelation	14	3	They were singing a new song before the throne and before the four living beings and the elders , and no one could learn the song except the 144,000 who have been ransomed from the world .
CJB	Revelation	14	4	These are the ones who have not defiled themselves with women , for they are virgins ; they follow the Lamb wherever he goes ; they have been ransomed from among humanity as firstfruits for God and the Lamb ;
CJB	Revelation	14	5	on their lips no lie was found — they are without defect .
CJB	Revelation	14	6	Next I saw another angel flying in mid-heaven with everlasting Good News to proclaim to those living on the earth — to every nation , tribe , language and people .
CJB	Revelation	14	7	In a loud voice he said , “ Fear God , give him glory , for the hour has come when he will pass judgment ! Worship the One who made heaven and earth , the sea and the springs of water ! ”
CJB	Revelation	14	8	Another angel , a second one , followed , saying , “ She has fallen ! She has fallen ! Bavel the Great ! [ a ] She made all the nations drink the wine of God ’ s fury caused by her whoring ! ”
CJB	Revelation	14	9	Another angel , a third one , followed them and said in a loud voice , “ If anyone worships the beast and its image and receives the mark on his forehead or on his hand ,
CJB	Revelation	14	10	he will indeed drink the wine of God ’ s fury poured undiluted into the cup of his rage . He will be tormented by fire and sulfur before the holy angels and before the Lamb ,
CJB	Revelation	14	11	and the smoke from their tormenting goes up forever and ever . They have no rest , day or night , those who worship the beast and its image and those who receive the mark of its name. ”
CJB	Revelation	14	12	This is when perseverance is needed on the part of God ’ s people , those who observe his commands and exercise Yeshua ’ s faithfulness .
CJB	Revelation	14	13	Next I heard a voice from heaven saying , “ Write : ‘ How blessed are the dead who die united with the Lord , from now on ! ’ ‘ Yes , ’ says the Spirit , ‘ now they may rest from their efforts , for the things they have accomplished follow along with them. ’ ”
CJB	Revelation	14	15	Another angel came out of the Temple and shouted to the one sitting on the cloud , “ Start using your sickle to reap , because the time to reap has come — the earth ’ s harvest is ripe ! ”
CJB	Revelation	14	16	The one sitting on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth , and the earth was harvested .
CJB	Revelation	14	17	Another angel came out of the Temple in heaven , and he too had a sharp sickle .
CJB	Revelation	14	18	Then out from the altar went yet another angel , who was in charge of the fire ; and he called in a loud voice to the one with the sharp sickle , “ Use your sharp sickle , and gather the clusters of grapes from the earth ’ s vine , because they are ripe ! ”
CJB	Revelation	14	19	The angel swung his sickle down onto the earth , gathered the earth ’ s grapes and threw them into the great winepress of God ’ s fury .
CJB	Revelation	14	20	The winepress was trodden outside the city , and blood flowed from the winepress as high as the horses ’ bridles for two hundred miles ! Footnotes - Revelation 14:8 Isaiah 21:9 - Revelation 14:14 Daniel 7:13
CJB	Revelation	15	15	Then I saw another sign in heaven , a great and wonderful one — seven angels with the seven plagues that are the final ones ; because with them , God ’ s fury is finished .
CJB	Revelation	15	2	I saw what looked like a sea of glass mixed with fire . Those defeating the beast , its image and the number of its name were standing by the sea of glass , holding harps which God had given them .
CJB	Revelation	15	3	They were singing the song of Moshe , the servant of God , and the song of the Lamb : “ Great and wonderful are the things you have done , Adonai , God of heaven ’ s armies ! [ a ] Just and true are your ways , king of the nations !
CJB	Revelation	15	4	Adonai , who will not fear and glorify your name ? because you alone are holy . All nations will come and worship before you , for your righteous deeds have been revealed. ”
CJB	Revelation	15	5	After this I looked , and the sanctuary ( that is , the Tent of Witness in heaven ) was opened ,
CJB	Revelation	15	6	and out of the sanctuary came the seven angels with the seven plagues . They were dressed in clean bright linen and had gold belts around their chests .
CJB	Revelation	15	7	One of the four living beings gave to the seven angels seven gold bowls filled with the fury of God , who lives forever and ever .
CJB	Revelation	15	8	Then the sanctuary was filled with smoke from God ’ s Sh ’ khinah , that is , from his power ; and no one could enter the sanctuary until the seven plagues of the seven angels had accomplished their purpose . Footnotes - Revelation 15:3 Amos 3:13 , 4:13
CJB	Revelation	16	16	And they gathered the kings to the place which in Hebrew is called Har Megiddo .
CJB	Revelation	16	2	So the first one went and poured his bowl onto the earth , and disgusting and painful sores appeared on all the people who had the mark of the beast and worshipped its image .
CJB	Revelation	16	3	The second one poured out his bowl into the sea , and it became like the blood of a dead person , and every living thing in the sea died .
CJB	Revelation	16	4	The third one poured out his bowl into the rivers and springs of water , and they turned to blood .
CJB	Revelation	16	5	Then I heard the angel of the waters say , “ O HaKadosh , the One who is and was , you are just in these judgments of yours .
CJB	Revelation	16	6	They poured out the blood of your people and your prophets , so you have made them drink blood . They deserve it ! ”
CJB	Revelation	16	7	Then I heard the altar say , “ Yes , Adonai , God of heaven ’ s armies , [ a ] your judgments are true and just ! ”
CJB	Revelation	16	8	The fourth one poured out his bowl on the sun , and it was permitted to burn people with fire .
CJB	Revelation	16	9	People were burned by the intense heat ; yet they cursed the name of God , who had the authority over these plagues , instead of turning from their sins to give him glory .
CJB	Revelation	16	10	The fifth one poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast , and its kingdom grew dark . People gnawed on their tongues from the pain ,
CJB	Revelation	16	11	yet they cursed the God of heaven because of their pains and sores , and did not turn from their sinful deeds .
CJB	Revelation	16	12	The sixth one poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates , and its water dried up , in order to prepare the way for the kings from the east .
CJB	Revelation	16	13	And I saw three unclean spirits that looked like frogs ; they came from the mouth of the dragon , from the mouth of the beast and from the mouth of the false prophet .
CJB	Revelation	16	14	They are miracle-working demonic spirits which go out to the kings of the whole inhabited world to assemble them for the War of the Great Day of Adonai-Tzva ’ ot .
CJB	Revelation	16	15	( “ Look ! I am coming like a thief ! How blessed are those who stay alert and keep their clothes clean , so that they won ’ t be walking naked and be publicly put to shame ! ” )
CJB	Revelation	16	17	The seventh one poured out his bowl on the air , and a loud voice came out of the Temple from the throne , saying , “ It is done ! ”
CJB	Revelation	16	18	There were flashes of lightning , voices and peals of thunder ; and there was a massive earthquake , such as has never occurred since mankind has been on earth , so violent was the earthquake .
CJB	Revelation	16	19	The great city was split into three parts , the cities of the nations fell , and God remembered Bavel the Great and made her drink the wine from the cup of his raging fury .
CJB	Revelation	16	20	Every island fled , and no mountains were to be found .
CJB	Revelation	16	21	And huge seventy-pound hailstones fell on people from the sky . But the people cursed God for the plague of hail , that it was such a terrible plague . Footnotes - Revelation 16:7 Amos 3:13 ; 4:13
CJB	Revelation	17	17	For God put it in their hearts to do what will fulfill his purpose , that is , to be of one mind and give their kingdom to the beast until God ’ s words have accomplished their intent .
CJB	Revelation	17	2	The kings of the earth went whoring with her , and the people living on earth have become drunk from the wine of her whoring. ”
CJB	Revelation	17	3	He carried me off in the Spirit to a desert , and I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast filled with blasphemous names and having seven heads and ten horns .
CJB	Revelation	17	4	The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet and glittered with gold , precious stones and pearls . In her hand was a gold cup filled with the obscene and filthy things produced by her whoring .
CJB	Revelation	17	5	On her forehead was written a name with a hidden meaning , BAVEL THE GREAT MOTHER OF WHORES AND OF THE EARTH ’ S OBSCENITIES
CJB	Revelation	17	6	I saw the woman drunk from the blood of God ’ s people , that is , from the blood of the people who testify about Yeshua . On seeing her , I was altogether astounded .
CJB	Revelation	17	7	Then the angel said to me , “ Why are you astounded ? I will tell you the hidden meaning of the woman and of the beast with seven heads and ten horns that was carrying her .
CJB	Revelation	17	8	The beast you saw once was , now is not , and will come up from the Abyss ; but it is on its way to destruction . The people living on earth whose names have not been written in the Book of Life since the founding of the world will be astounded to see the beast that once was , now is not , but is to appear .
CJB	Revelation	17	9	This calls for a mind with wisdom : the seven heads are seven hills on which the woman is sitting ; also they are seven kings —
CJB	Revelation	17	10	five have fallen , one is living now and the other is yet to come ; and when he does come , he must remain only a little while .
CJB	Revelation	17	11	The beast which once was and now is not is an eighth king ; it comes from the seven and is on its way to destruction .
CJB	Revelation	17	12	The ten horns you saw are ten kings who have not yet begun to rule , but they receive power as kings for one hour , along with the beast .
CJB	Revelation	17	13	They have one mind , and they hand over their power and authority to the beast .
CJB	Revelation	17	14	They will go to war against the Lamb , but the Lamb will defeat them , because he is Lord of lords and King of kings , and those who are called , chosen and faithful will overcome along with him. ”
CJB	Revelation	17	15	Then he said to me , “ The waters that you saw , where the whore is sitting , are peoples , crowds , nations and languages .
CJB	Revelation	17	16	As for the ten horns that you saw and the beast , they will hate the whore , bring her to ruin , leave her naked , eat her flesh and consume her with fire .
CJB	Revelation	17	18	And the woman you saw is the great city that rules over the kings of the earth . ”
CJB	Revelation	18	18	and cried out when they saw the smoke as she burned , “ What city was like the great city ? ”
CJB	Revelation	18	2	He cried out in a strong voice , “ She has fallen ! She has fallen ! Bavel the Great ! [ a ] She has become a home for demons , a prison for every unclean spirit , a prison for every unclean , hated bird .
CJB	Revelation	18	3	“ For all the nations have drunk of the wine of God ’ s fury caused by her whoring — yes , the kings of the earth went whoring with her , and from her unrestrained love of luxury the world ’ s businessmen have grown rich. ”
CJB	Revelation	18	4	Then I heard another voice out of heaven say : “ My people , come out of her ! so that you will not share in her sins , so that you will not be infected by her plagues ,
CJB	Revelation	18	5	for her sins are a sticky mass piled up to heaven , and God has remembered her crimes .
CJB	Revelation	18	6	“ Render to her as she rendered to others ! Pay her back double for what she has done ! Use the cup in which she has brewed to brew her a double-sized drink !
CJB	Revelation	18	7	“ Give her as much torment and sorrow as the glory and luxury she gave herself ! For in her heart she says , ‘ I sit a queen — I am not a widow , I will never see sorrow. ’
CJB	Revelation	18	8	“ Therefore , her plagues will come in a single day — death , sorrow and famine ; and she will be burned with fire , because Adonai , God , her Judge , is mighty ”
CJB	Revelation	18	9	The kings of the earth who went whoring with her and shared her luxury will sob and wail over her when they see the smoke as she burns .
CJB	Revelation	18	10	Standing at a distance , for fear of her torment , they will say , “ Oh no ! The great city ! Bavel , the mighty city ! In a single hour your judgment has come ! ”
CJB	Revelation	18	11	The world ’ s businessmen weep and mourn over her , because no one is buying their merchandise any more —
CJB	Revelation	18	12	stocks of gold and silver , gems and pearls , fine linen and purple , silk and scarlet , all rare woods , all ivory goods , all kinds of things made of scented wood , brass , iron and marble ;
CJB	Revelation	18	13	cinnamon , cardamom , incense , myrrh , frankincense , wine , oil , flour , grain , cattle , sheep , horses , chariots — and bodies — and people ’ s souls .
CJB	Revelation	18	14	The fruits you lusted for with all your heart have gone ! All the luxury and flashiness have been destroyed , never to return !
CJB	Revelation	18	15	The sellers of these things , who got rich from her , will stand at a distance , for fear of her torment , weeping and mourning ,
CJB	Revelation	18	16	and saying , “ Oh no ! The great city used to wear fine linen , purple and scarlet ! She glittered with gold , precious stones and pearls !
CJB	Revelation	18	17	Such great wealth — in a single hour , ruined ! ” All the ship masters , passengers , sailors and everyone making his living from the sea stood at a distance
CJB	Revelation	18	19	And they threw dust on their heads as they wept and mourned , saying , “ Oh no ! The great city ! The abundance of her wealth made all the ship owners rich ! In a single hour she is ruined ! ”
CJB	Revelation	18	20	Rejoice over her , heaven ! Rejoice , people of God , emissaries and prophets ! For in judging her , God has vindicated you .
CJB	Revelation	18	21	Then a mighty angel picked up a boulder the size of a great millstone , and hurled it into the sea , saying , “ With violence like this will the great city Bavel be hurled down , never to be found again !
CJB	Revelation	18	22	“ The sound of harpists and musicians , flute-players and trumpeters will never again be heard in you . No worker of any trade will ever again be found in you , the sound of a mill will never again be heard in you ,
CJB	Revelation	18	23	the light of a lamp will never again shine in you , the voice of bridegroom and bride will never again be heard in you . “ For your businessmen were the most powerful on earth , all the nations were deceived by your magic spell .
CJB	Revelation	18	24	“ In her was found the blood of prophets and of God ’ s people , indeed , of all who have ever been slaughtered on earth ! ” Footnotes - Revelation 18:2 Isaiah 21:9
CJB	Revelation	19	19	I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to do battle with the rider of the horse and his army .
CJB	Revelation	19	2	For his judgments are true and just . He has judged the great whore who corrupted the earth with her whoring . He has taken vengeance on her who has the blood of his servants on her hands. ”
CJB	Revelation	19	3	And a second time they said , “ Halleluyah ! Her smoke goes up forever and ever ! ”
CJB	Revelation	19	4	The twenty-four elders and the four living beings fell down and worshipped God , sitting on the throne , and said , “ Amen ! Halleluyah ! ”
CJB	Revelation	19	5	A voice went out from the throne , saying , “ Praise our God , all you his servants , you who fear him , small and great ! ”
CJB	Revelation	19	6	Then I heard what sounded like the roar of a huge crowd , like the sound of rushing waters , like loud peals of thunder , saying , “ Halleluyah ! Adonai , God of heaven ’ s armies , [ a ] has begun his reign !
CJB	Revelation	19	7	“ Let us rejoice and be glad ! Let us give him the glory ! For the time has come for the wedding of the Lamb , and his Bride has prepared herself —
CJB	Revelation	19	8	fine linen , bright and clean has been given her to wear. ” ( “ Fine linen ” means the righteous deeds of God ’ s people . )
CJB	Revelation	19	9	The angel said to me , “ Write : ‘ How blessed are those who have been invited to the wedding feast of the Lamb ! ’ ” Then he added , “ These are God ’ s very words. ”
CJB	Revelation	19	10	I fell at his feet to worship him ; but he said , “ Don ’ t do that ! I ’ m only a fellow-servant with you and your brothers who have the testimony of Yeshua . Worship God ! For the testimony of Yeshua is the Spirit of prophecy. ”
CJB	Revelation	19	11	Next I saw heaven opened , and there before me was a white horse . Sitting on it was the one called Faithful and True , and it is in righteousness that he passes judgment and goes to battle .
CJB	Revelation	19	12	His eyes were like a fiery flame , and on his head were many royal crowns . And he had a name written which no one knew but himself .
CJB	Revelation	19	13	He was wearing a robe that had been soaked in blood , and the name by which he is called is , “ THE WORD OF GOD. ”
CJB	Revelation	19	14	The armies of heaven , clothed in fine linen , white and pure , were following him on white horses .
CJB	Revelation	19	15	And out of his mouth comes a sharp sword with which to strike down nations — “ He will rule them with a staff of iron. ” [ b ] It is he who treads the winepress from which flows the wine of the furious rage of Adonai , God of heaven ’ s armies .
CJB	Revelation	19	16	And on his robe and on his thigh he has a name written : KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS .
CJB	Revelation	19	17	Then I saw an angel standing in the sun , and he cried out in a loud voice to all the birds that fly about in mid-heaven , “ Come , gather together for the great feast God is giving ,
CJB	Revelation	19	18	to eat the flesh of kings , the flesh of generals , the flesh of important men , the flesh of horses and their riders and the flesh of all kinds of people , free and slave , small and great ! ”
CJB	Revelation	19	20	But the beast was taken captive , and with it the false prophet who , in its presence , had done the miracles which he had used to deceive those who had received the mark of the beast and those who had worshipped his image . The beast and the false prophet were both thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur .
CJB	Revelation	19	21	The rest were killed with the sword that goes out of the mouth of the rider on the horse , and all the birds gorged themselves on their flesh . Footnotes - Revelation 19:6 Amos 3:13 ; 4:13 - Revelation 19:15 Psalm 2:9
CJB	Revelation	20	20	Next I saw an angel coming down from heaven , who had the key to the Abyss and a great chain in his hand .
CJB	Revelation	20	2	He seized the dragon , that ancient serpent , who is the Devil and Satan [ the Adversary ] , and chained him up for a thousand years .
CJB	Revelation	20	3	He threw him into the Abyss , locked it and sealed it over him ; so that he could not deceive the nations any more until the thousand years were over . After that , he has to be set free for a little while .
CJB	Revelation	20	4	Then I saw thrones , and those seated on them received authority to judge . And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for testifying about Yeshua and proclaiming the Word of God , also those who had not worshipped the beast or its image and had not received the mark on their foreheads and on their hands . They came to life and ruled with the Messiah for a thousand years .
CJB	Revelation	20	5	( The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were over . ) This is the first resurrection .
CJB	Revelation	20	6	Blessed and holy is anyone who has a part in the first resurrection ; over him the second death has no power . On the contrary , they will be cohanim of God and of the Messiah , and they will rule with him for the thousand years .
CJB	Revelation	20	7	When the thousand years are over , the Adversary will be set free from his prison
CJB	Revelation	20	8	and will go out to deceive the nations in the four quarters of the earth , Gog and Magog , [ a ] to gather them for the battle . Their number is countless as the sand on the seashore ;
CJB	Revelation	20	9	and they came up over the breadth of the Land and surrounded the camp of God ’ s people and the city he loves . But fire came down from heaven and consumed them .
CJB	Revelation	20	10	The Adversary who had deceived them was hurled into the lake of fire and sulfur , where the beast and the false prophet were ; and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever .
CJB	Revelation	20	11	Next I saw a great white throne and the One sitting on it . Earth and heaven fled from his presence , and no place was found for them .
CJB	Revelation	20	12	And I saw the dead , both great and small , standing in front of the throne . Books were opened ; and another book was opened , the Book of Life ; and the dead were judged from what was written in the books , according to what they had done .
CJB	Revelation	20	13	The sea gave up the dead in it ; and Death and Sh ’ ol gave up the dead in them ; and they were judged , each according to what he had done .
CJB	Revelation	20	14	Then Death and Sh ’ ol were hurled into the lake of fire . This is the second death — the lake of fire .
CJB	Revelation	20	15	Anyone whose name was not found written in the Book of Life was hurled into the lake of fire . Footnotes - Revelation 20:8 Ezekiel 38:2
CJB	Revelation	21	21	The twelve gates were twelve pearls , with each gate made of a single pearl . The city ’ s main street was pure gold , transparent as glass .
CJB	Revelation	21	2	Chronicles 6:18
CJB	Revelation	21	3	I heard a loud voice from the throne say , “ See ! God ’ s Sh ’ khinah is with mankind , and he will live with them . They will be his people , and he himself , God-with-them , will be their God . [ b ]
CJB	Revelation	21	4	He will wipe away every tear from their eyes . There will no longer be any death ; and there will no longer be any mourning , crying or pain ; because the old order has passed away. ”
CJB	Revelation	21	5	Then the One sitting on the throne said , “ Look ! I am making everything new ! ” Also he said , “ Write , ‘ These words are true and trustworthy ! ’ ”
CJB	Revelation	21	6	And he said to me , “ It is done ! I am the ‘ A ’ and the ‘ Z , ’ the Beginning and the End . To anyone who is thirsty I myself will give water free of charge from the Fountain of Life .
CJB	Revelation	21	7	He who wins the victory will receive these things , and I will be his God , and he will be my son .
CJB	Revelation	21	8	But as for the cowardly , the untrustworthy , the vile , the murderers , the sexually immoral , those involved with the occult and with drugs , idol-worshippers , and all liars — their destiny is the lake burning with fire and sulfur , the second death. ”

CJB	Revelation	21	14	The wall of the city was built on twelve foundation-stones , and on these were the twelve names of the twelve emissaries of the Lamb .
CJB	Revelation	21	15	The angel speaking with me had a gold measuring-rod with which to measure the city , its gates and its wall .
CJB	Revelation	21	16	The city is laid out in a square , its length equal to its width . With his rod he measured the city at 1,500 miles , with length , width and height the same .
CJB	Revelation	21	17	He measured its wall at
CJB	Revelation	21	216	feet by human standards of measurement , which the angel was using .
CJB	Revelation	21	18	The wall was made of diamond and the city of pure gold resembling pure glass .
CJB	Revelation	21	19	The foundations of the city wall were decorated with all kinds of precious stones — the first foundation stone was diamond , the second sapphire , the third chalcedony , the fourth emerald ,
CJB	Revelation	21	20	the fifth sardonyx , the sixth carnelian , the seventh chrysolite , the eighth beryl , the ninth topaz , the tenth chrysoprase , the eleventh turquoise and the twelfth amethyst .
CJB	Revelation	21	22	I saw no Temple in the city , for Adonai , God of heaven ’ s armies , is its Temple , as is the Lamb .
CJB	Revelation	21	23	The city has no need for the sun or the moon to shine on it , because God ’ s Sh ’ khinah gives it light , and its lamp is the Lamb .
CJB	Revelation	21	24	The nations will walk by its light , and the kings of the earth will bring their splendor into it .
CJB	Revelation	21	25	Its gates will never close , they stay open all day because night will not exist there ,
CJB	Revelation	21	26	and the honor and splendor of the nations will be brought into it .
CJB	Revelation	21	27	Nothing impure may enter it , nor anyone who does shameful things or lies ; the only ones who may enter are those whose names are written in the Lamb ’ s Book of Life . Footnotes - Revelation 21:1 Isaiah 65:17 , 66:22 - Revelation 21:3 Leviticus 26:11–12 ; Isaiah 7:14 ; 8:8 ,

CJB	Revelation	22	22	Next the angel showed me the river of the water of life , sparkling like crystal , flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb .
CJB	Revelation	22	2	Between the main street and the river was the Tree of Life producing twelve kinds of fruit , a different kind every month ; and the leaves of the tree were for healing the nations —
CJB	Revelation	22	3	no longer will there be any curses . The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in the city , and his servants will worship him ;
CJB	Revelation	22	4	they will see his face , and his name will be on their foreheads .
CJB	Revelation	22	5	Night will no longer exist , so they will need neither the light of a lamp nor the light of the sun , because Adonai , God , will shine upon them . And they will reign as kings forever and ever .

CJB	Revelation	22	7	“ Look ! I am coming very soon . Blessed is the person who obeys the words of the prophecy written in this book ! ”
