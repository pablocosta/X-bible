NKJV	Matthew	2	4	And when he had gathered all ( E ) the chief priests and ( F ) scribes of the people together , ( G ) he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born .
NKJV	Matthew	2	5	So they said to him , “ In Bethlehem of Judea , for thus it is written by the prophet :
NKJV	Matthew	2	6	‘ But ( H ) you , Bethlehem , in the land of Judah , Are not the least among the rulers of Judah ; For out of you shall come a Ruler ( I ) Who will shepherd My people Israel. ’ ”
NKJV	Matthew	2	7	Then Herod , when he had secretly called the [ b ] wise men , determined from them what time the ( J ) star appeared .
NKJV	Matthew	2	8	And he sent them to Bethlehem and said , “ Go and search carefully for the young Child , and when you have found Him , bring back word to me , that I may come and worship Him also. ”
NKJV	Matthew	2	9	When they heard the king , they departed ; and behold , the star which they had seen in the East went before them , till it came and stood over where the young Child was .
NKJV	Matthew	2	10	When they saw the star , they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy .
NKJV	Matthew	2	11	And when they had come into the house , they saw the young Child with Mary His mother , and fell down and worshiped Him . And when they had opened their treasures , ( K ) they presented gifts to Him : gold , frankincense , and myrrh .

NKJV	Matthew	2	17	Then was fulfilled what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet , saying :
NKJV	Matthew	2	18	“ A ( N ) voice was heard in Ramah , Lamentation , weeping , and great mourning , Rachel weeping for her children , Refusing to be comforted , Because they are no more. ” The Home in Nazareth ( O )

NKJV	Matthew	2	20	( P ) saying , “ Arise , take the young Child and His mother , and go to the land of Israel , for those who ( Q ) sought the young Child ’ s life are dead. ”
NKJV	Matthew	2	21	Then he arose , took the young Child and His mother , and came into the land of Israel .
NKJV	Matthew	2	22	But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea instead of his father Herod , he was afraid to go there . And being warned by God in a ( R ) dream , he turned aside ( S ) into the region of Galilee .
NKJV	Matthew	2	23	And he came and dwelt in a city called ( T ) Nazareth , that it might be fulfilled ( U ) which was spoken by the prophets , “ He shall be called a Nazarene. ” Footnotes - Matthew 2:1 Gr . magoi - Matthew 2:7 Gr . magoi Scripture taken from the New King James Version® . Copyright ©

NKJV	Matthew	3	15	But Jesus answered and said to him , “ Permit it to be so now , for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness. ” Then he allowed Him .

NKJV	Matthew	5	13	“ You are the salt of the earth ; ( S ) but if the salt loses its flavor , how shall it be seasoned ? It is then good for nothing but to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by men .
NKJV	Matthew	5	14	( T ) “ You are the light of the world . A city that is set on a hill can not be hidden .
NKJV	Matthew	5	15	Nor do they ( U ) light a lamp and put it under a basket , but on a lampstand , and it gives light to all who are in the house .
NKJV	Matthew	5	16	Let your light so shine before men , ( V ) that they may see your good works and ( W ) glorify your Father in heaven . Christ Fulfills the Law
NKJV	Matthew	5	17	( X ) “ Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets . I did not come to destroy but to fulfill .
NKJV	Matthew	5	18	For assuredly , I say to you , ( Y ) till heaven and earth pass away , one [ b ] jot or one [ c ] tittle will by no means pass from the law till all is fulfilled .
NKJV	Matthew	5	19	( Z ) Whoever therefore breaks one of the least of these commandments , and teaches men so , shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven ; but whoever does and teaches them , he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven .

NKJV	Matthew	5	35	nor by the earth , for it is His footstool ; nor by Jerusalem , for it is the city of ( AV ) the great King .
NKJV	Matthew	5	36	Nor shall you swear by your head , because you can not make one hair white or black .

NKJV	Matthew	7	2	For with what [ b ] judgment you judge , you will be judged ; ( C ) and with the measure you use , it will be measured back to you .
NKJV	Matthew	7	3	( D ) And why do you look at the speck in your brother ’ s eye , but do not consider the plank in your own eye ?
NKJV	Matthew	7	4	Or how can you say to your brother , ‘ Let me remove the speck from your eye ’ ; and look , a plank is in your own eye ?
NKJV	Matthew	7	5	Hypocrite ! First remove the plank from your own eye , and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother ’ s eye .
NKJV	Matthew	7	6	( E ) “ Do not give what is holy to the dogs ; nor cast your pearls before swine , lest they trample them under their feet , and turn and tear you in pieces . Keep Asking , Seeking , Knocking ( F )
NKJV	Matthew	7	8	For ( H ) everyone who asks receives , and he who seeks finds , and to him who knocks it will be opened .
NKJV	Matthew	7	9	( I ) Or what man is there among you who , if his son asks for bread , will give him a stone ?
NKJV	Matthew	7	10	Or if he asks for a fish , will he give him a serpent ?
NKJV	Matthew	7	11	If you then , ( J ) being evil , know how to give good gifts to your children , how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him !
NKJV	Matthew	7	12	Therefore , ( K ) whatever you want men to do to you , do also to them , for ( L ) this is the Law and the Prophets . The Narrow Way ( M )
NKJV	Matthew	7	13	( N ) “ Enter by the narrow gate ; for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction , and there are many who go in by it .
NKJV	Matthew	7	14	[ c ] Because narrow is the gate and [ d ] difficult is the way which leads to life , and there are few who find it . You Will Know Them by Their Fruits ( O )
NKJV	Matthew	7	15	( P ) “ Beware of false prophets , ( Q ) who come to you in sheep ’ s clothing , but inwardly they are ravenous wolves .
NKJV	Matthew	7	16	( R ) You will know them by their fruits . ( S ) Do men gather grapes from thornbushes or figs from thistles ?
NKJV	Matthew	7	17	Even so , ( T ) every good tree bears good fruit , but a bad tree bears bad fruit .
NKJV	Matthew	7	18	A good tree can not bear bad fruit , nor can a bad tree bear good fruit .
NKJV	Matthew	7	19	( U ) Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire .
NKJV	Matthew	7	20	Therefore by their fruits you will know them . I Never Knew You ( V )
NKJV	Matthew	7	21	“ Not everyone who says to Me , ( W ) ‘ Lord , Lord , ’ shall enter the kingdom of heaven , but he who ( X ) does the will of My Father in heaven .
NKJV	Matthew	7	22	Many will say to Me in that day , ‘ Lord , Lord , have we ( Y ) not prophesied in Your name , cast out demons in Your name , and done many wonders in Your name ? ’
NKJV	Matthew	7	23	And ( Z ) then I will declare to them , ‘ I never knew you ; ( AA ) depart from Me , you who practice lawlessness ! ’ Build on the Rock ( AB )
NKJV	Matthew	7	24	“ Therefore ( AC ) whoever hears these sayings of Mine , and does them , I will liken him to a wise man who built his house on the rock :
NKJV	Matthew	7	25	and the rain descended , the floods came , and the winds blew and beat on that house ; and it did not fall , for it was founded on the rock .
NKJV	Matthew	7	26	“ But everyone who hears these sayings of Mine , and does not do them , will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand :
NKJV	Matthew	7	27	and the rain descended , the floods came , and the winds blew and beat on that house ; and it fell . And great was its fall. ”
NKJV	Matthew	7	28	And so it was , when Jesus had ended these sayings , that ( AD ) the people were astonished at His teaching ,
NKJV	Matthew	7	29	( AE ) for He taught them as one having authority , and not as the scribes . Footnotes - Matthew 7:1 Condemn - Matthew 7:2 Condemnation - Matthew 7:14 NU , M How narrow . . . ! - Matthew 7:14 confined Scripture taken from the New King James Version® . Copyright ©

NKJV	Matthew	8	8	The centurion answered and said , “ Lord , ( K ) I am not worthy that You should come under my roof . But only ( L ) speak a word , and my servant will be healed .
NKJV	Matthew	8	2	( B ) And behold , a leper came and ( C ) worshiped Him , saying , “ Lord , if You are willing , You can make me clean. ”
NKJV	Matthew	8	3	Then Jesus put out His hand and touched him , saying , “ I am willing ; be cleansed. ” Immediately his leprosy ( D ) was cleansed .
NKJV	Matthew	8	4	And Jesus said to him , ( E ) “ See that you tell no one ; but go your way , show yourself to the priest , and offer the gift that ( F ) Moses ( G ) commanded , as a testimony to them. ” Jesus Heals a Centurion ’ s Servant ( H )
NKJV	Matthew	8	5	( I ) Now when Jesus had entered Capernaum , a ( J ) centurion came to Him , pleading with Him ,
NKJV	Matthew	8	6	saying , “ Lord , my servant is lying at home paralyzed , dreadfully tormented. ”
NKJV	Matthew	8	7	And Jesus said to him , “ I will come and heal him. ”
NKJV	Matthew	8	9	For I also am a man under authority , having soldiers under me . And I say to this one , ‘ Go , ’ and he goes ; and to another , ‘ Come , ’ and he comes ; and to my servant , ‘ Do this , ’ and he does it. ”
NKJV	Matthew	8	10	When Jesus heard it , He marveled , and said to those who followed , “ Assuredly , I say to you , I have not found such great faith , not even in Israel !
NKJV	Matthew	8	11	And I say to you that ( M ) many will come from east and west , and sit down with Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven .
NKJV	Matthew	8	12	But ( N ) the sons of the kingdom ( O ) will be cast out into outer darkness . There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. ”
NKJV	Matthew	8	13	Then Jesus said to the centurion , “ Go your way ; and as you have believed , so let it be done for you. ” And his servant was healed that same hour . Peter ’ s Mother-in-Law Healed ( P )
NKJV	Matthew	8	14	( Q ) Now when Jesus had come into Peter ’ s house , He saw ( R ) his wife ’ s mother lying sick with a fever .
NKJV	Matthew	8	15	So He touched her hand , and the fever left her . And she arose and served [ a ] them . Many Healed in the Evening ( S )
NKJV	Matthew	8	16	( T ) When evening had come , they brought to Him many who were demon-possessed . And He cast out the spirits with a word , and healed all who were sick ,
NKJV	Matthew	8	17	that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet , saying : ( U ) “ He Himself took our infirmities And bore our sicknesses. ” The Cost of Discipleship ( V )
NKJV	Matthew	8	18	And when Jesus saw great multitudes about Him , He gave a command to depart to the other side .
NKJV	Matthew	8	19	( W ) Then a certain scribe came and said to Him , “ Teacher , I will follow You wherever You go. ”
NKJV	Matthew	8	20	And Jesus said to him , “ Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests , but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head. ”
NKJV	Matthew	8	21	( X ) Then another of His disciples said to Him , “ Lord , ( Y ) let me first go and bury my father. ”
NKJV	Matthew	8	22	But Jesus said to him , “ Follow Me , and let the dead bury their own dead. ” Wind and Wave Obey Jesus ( Z )
NKJV	Matthew	8	23	Now when He got into a boat , His disciples followed Him .
NKJV	Matthew	8	24	( AA ) And suddenly a great tempest arose on the sea , so that the boat was covered with the waves . But He was asleep .
NKJV	Matthew	8	25	Then His disciples came to Him and awoke Him , saying , “ Lord , save us ! We are perishing ! ”
NKJV	Matthew	8	26	But He said to them , “ Why are you fearful , O you of little faith ? ” Then ( AB ) He arose and rebuked the winds and the sea , and there was a great calm .
NKJV	Matthew	8	27	So the men marveled , saying , [ b ] “ Who can this be , that even the winds and the sea obey Him ? ” Two Demon-Possessed Men Healed ( AC )
NKJV	Matthew	8	28	( AD ) When He had come to the other side , to the country of the [ c ] Gergesenes , there met Him two demon-possessed men , coming out of the tombs , exceedingly fierce , so that no one could pass that way .
NKJV	Matthew	8	29	And suddenly they cried out , saying , “ What have we to do with You , Jesus , You Son of God ? Have You come here to torment us before the time ? ”
NKJV	Matthew	8	30	Now a good way off from them there was a herd of many swine feeding .
NKJV	Matthew	8	31	So the demons begged Him , saying , “ If You cast us out , [ d ] permit us to go away into the herd of swine. ”
NKJV	Matthew	8	32	And He said to them , “ Go. ” So when they had come out , they went into the herd of swine . And suddenly the whole herd of swine ran violently down the steep place into the sea , and perished in the water .
NKJV	Matthew	8	33	Then those who kept them fled ; and they went away into the city and told everything , including what had happened to the demon-possessed men .
NKJV	Matthew	8	34	And behold , the whole city came out to meet Jesus . And when they saw Him , ( AE ) they begged Him to depart from their region .

NKJV	Matthew	9	9	( H ) As Jesus passed on from there , He saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax office . And He said to him , “ Follow Me. ” So he arose and followed Him .
NKJV	Matthew	9	2	( C ) Then behold , they brought to Him a paralytic lying on a bed . ( D ) When Jesus saw their faith , He said to the paralytic , “ Son , be of good cheer ; your sins are forgiven you. ”
NKJV	Matthew	9	3	And at once some of the scribes said within themselves , “ This Man blasphemes ! ”
NKJV	Matthew	9	4	But Jesus , ( E ) knowing their thoughts , said , “ Why do you think evil in your hearts ?
NKJV	Matthew	9	5	For which is easier , to say , ‘ Your sins are forgiven you , ’ or to say , ‘ Arise and walk ’ ?
NKJV	Matthew	9	6	But that you may know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins ” —then He said to the paralytic , “ Arise , take up your bed , and go to your house. ”
NKJV	Matthew	9	7	And he arose and departed to his house .
NKJV	Matthew	9	8	Now when the multitudes saw it , they ( F ) marveled [ a ] and glorified God , who had given such power to men . Matthew the Tax Collector ( G )
NKJV	Matthew	9	10	( I ) Now it happened , as Jesus sat at the table in the house , that behold , many tax collectors and sinners came and sat down with Him and His disciples .
NKJV	Matthew	9	11	And when the Pharisees saw it , they said to His disciples , “ Why does your Teacher eat with ( J ) tax collectors and ( K ) sinners ? ”
NKJV	Matthew	9	12	When Jesus heard that , He said to them , “ Those who are well have no need of a physician , but those who are sick .
NKJV	Matthew	9	13	But go and learn what this means : ( L ) ‘ I desire mercy and not sacrifice. ’ For I did not come to call the righteous , ( M ) but sinners , [ b ] to repentance. ” Jesus Is Questioned About Fasting ( N )
NKJV	Matthew	9	14	Then the disciples of John came to Him , saying , ( O ) “ Why do we and the Pharisees fast [ c ] often , but Your disciples do not fast ? ”
NKJV	Matthew	9	15	And Jesus said to them , “ Can ( P ) the [ d ] friends of the bridegroom mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them ? But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them , and ( Q ) then they will fast .
NKJV	Matthew	9	16	No one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment ; for [ e ] the patch pulls away from the garment , and the tear is made worse .
NKJV	Matthew	9	17	Nor do they put new wine into old wineskins , or else the wineskins [ f ] break , the wine is spilled , and the wineskins are ruined . But they put new wine into new wineskins , and both are preserved. ” A Girl Restored to Life and a Woman Healed ( R )
NKJV	Matthew	9	18	( S ) While He spoke these things to them , behold , a ruler came and worshiped Him , saying , “ My daughter has just died , but come and lay Your hand on her and she will live. ”
NKJV	Matthew	9	19	So Jesus arose and followed him , and so did His ( T ) disciples .
NKJV	Matthew	9	20	( U ) And suddenly , a woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years came from behind and ( V ) touched the hem of His garment .
NKJV	Matthew	9	21	For she said to herself , “ If only I may touch His garment , I shall be made well. ”
NKJV	Matthew	9	22	But Jesus turned around , and when He saw her He said , “ Be of good cheer , daughter ; ( W ) your faith has made you well. ” And the woman was made well from that hour .
NKJV	Matthew	9	23	( X ) When Jesus came into the ruler ’ s house , and saw ( Y ) the flute players and the noisy crowd wailing ,
NKJV	Matthew	9	24	He said to them , ( Z ) “ Make room , for the girl is not dead , but sleeping. ” And they ridiculed Him .
NKJV	Matthew	9	25	But when the crowd was put outside , He went in and ( AA ) took her by the hand , and the girl arose .
NKJV	Matthew	9	26	And the ( AB ) report of this went out into all that land . Two Blind Men Healed
NKJV	Matthew	9	27	When Jesus departed from there , ( AC ) two blind men followed Him , crying out and saying , ( AD ) “ Son of David , have mercy on us ! ”
NKJV	Matthew	9	28	And when He had come into the house , the blind men came to Him . And Jesus said to them , “ Do you believe that I am able to do this ? ” They said to Him , “ Yes , Lord. ”
NKJV	Matthew	9	29	Then He touched their eyes , saying , “ According to your faith let it be to you. ”
NKJV	Matthew	9	30	And their eyes were opened . And Jesus sternly warned them , saying , ( AE ) “ See that no one knows it. ”
NKJV	Matthew	9	31	( AF ) But when they had departed , they [ g ] spread the news about Him in all that [ h ] country . A Mute Man Speaks
NKJV	Matthew	9	32	( AG ) As they went out , behold , they brought to Him a man , mute and demon-possessed .
NKJV	Matthew	9	33	And when the demon was cast out , the mute spoke . And the multitudes marveled , saying , “ It was never seen like this in Israel ! ”
NKJV	Matthew	9	34	But the Pharisees said , ( AH ) “ He casts out demons by the ruler of the demons. ” The Compassion of Jesus ( AI )
NKJV	Matthew	9	35	Then Jesus went about all the cities and villages , ( AJ ) teaching in their synagogues , preaching the gospel of the kingdom , and healing every sickness and every disease [ i ] among the people .
NKJV	Matthew	9	36	( AK ) But when He saw the multitudes , He was moved with compassion for them , because they were [ j ] weary and scattered , ( AL ) like sheep having no shepherd .
NKJV	Matthew	9	37	Then He said to His disciples , ( AM ) “ The harvest truly is plentiful , but the laborers are few .
NKJV	Matthew	9	38	( AN ) Therefore pray the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into His harvest. ” Footnotes - Matthew 9:8 NU were afraid - Matthew 9:13 NU omits to repentance - Matthew 9:14 NU brackets often as disputed . - Matthew 9:15 Lit . sons of the bridechamber - Matthew 9:16 Lit . that which is put on - Matthew 9:17 burst - Matthew 9:31 Lit . made Him known - Matthew 9:31 Lit . land - Matthew 9:35 NU omits among the people - Matthew 9:36 NU , M harassed Scripture taken from the New King James Version® .

NKJV	Matthew	10	5	These twelve Jesus sent out and commanded them , saying : ( G ) “ Do not go into the way of the Gentiles , and do not enter a city of ( H ) the Samaritans .
NKJV	Matthew	10	6	( I ) But go rather to the ( J ) lost sheep of the house of Israel .
NKJV	Matthew	10	7	( K ) And as you go , preach , saying , ( L ) ‘ The kingdom of heaven [ c ] is at hand. ’
NKJV	Matthew	10	8	Heal the sick , [ d ] cleanse the lepers , [ e ] raise the dead , cast out demons . ( M ) Freely you have received , freely give .
NKJV	Matthew	10	9	( N ) Provide neither gold nor silver nor ( O ) copper in your money belts ,
NKJV	Matthew	10	11	( Q ) “ Now whatever city or town you enter , inquire who in it is worthy , and stay there till you go out .
NKJV	Matthew	10	12	And when you go into a household , greet it .
NKJV	Matthew	10	13	( R ) If the household is worthy , let your peace come upon it . ( S ) But if it is not worthy , let your peace return to you .
NKJV	Matthew	10	14	( T ) And whoever will not receive you nor hear your words , when you depart from that house or city , ( U ) shake off the dust from your feet .
NKJV	Matthew	10	15	Assuredly , I say to you , ( V ) it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city ! Persecutions Are Coming ( W )
NKJV	Matthew	10	16	( X ) “ Behold , I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves . ( Y ) Therefore be wise as serpents and ( Z ) harmless [ f ] as doves .
NKJV	Matthew	10	17	But beware of men , for ( AA ) they will deliver you up to councils and ( AB ) scourge you in their synagogues .
NKJV	Matthew	10	18	( AC ) You will be brought before governors and kings for My sake , as a testimony to them and to the Gentiles .
NKJV	Matthew	10	19	( AD ) But when they deliver you up , do not worry about how or what you should speak . For ( AE ) it will be given to you in that hour what you should speak ;
NKJV	Matthew	10	20	( AF ) for it is not you who speak , but the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you .
NKJV	Matthew	10	21	( AG ) “ Now brother will deliver up brother to death , and a father his child ; and children will rise up against parents and cause them to be put to death .
NKJV	Matthew	10	22	And ( AH ) you will be hated by all for My name ’ s sake . ( AI ) But he who endures to the end will be saved .
NKJV	Matthew	10	23	( AJ ) When they persecute you in this city , flee to another . For assuredly , I say to you , you will not have ( AK ) gone through the cities of Israel ( AL ) before the Son of Man comes .
NKJV	Matthew	10	24	( AM ) “ A disciple is not above his teacher , nor a servant above his master .
NKJV	Matthew	10	25	It is enough for a disciple that he be like his teacher , and a servant like his master . If ( AN ) they have called the master of the house [ g ] Beelzebub , how much more will they call those of his household !
NKJV	Matthew	10	26	Therefore do not fear them . ( AO ) For there is nothing covered that will not be revealed , and hidden that will not be known . Jesus Teaches the Fear of God ( AP )
NKJV	Matthew	10	27	“ Whatever I tell you in the dark , ( AQ ) speak in the light ; and what you hear in the ear , preach on the housetops .
NKJV	Matthew	10	28	( AR ) And do not fear those who kill the body but can not kill the soul . But rather ( AS ) fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in [ h ] hell .
NKJV	Matthew	10	29	Are not two ( AT ) sparrows sold for a [ i ] copper coin ? And not one of them falls to the ground apart from your Father ’ s will .
NKJV	Matthew	10	30	( AU ) But the very hairs of your head are all numbered .
NKJV	Matthew	10	31	Do not fear therefore ; you are of more value than many sparrows . Confess Christ Before Men ( AV )
NKJV	Matthew	10	32	( AW ) “ Therefore whoever confesses Me before men , ( AX ) him I will also confess before My Father who is in heaven .
NKJV	Matthew	10	33	( AY ) But whoever denies Me before men , him I will also deny before My Father who is in heaven . Christ Brings Division ( AZ )
NKJV	Matthew	10	34	( BA ) “ Do not think that I came to bring peace on earth . I did not come to bring peace but a sword .
NKJV	Matthew	10	35	For I have come to ( BB ) ‘ set [ j ] a man against his father , a daughter against her mother , and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law ’ ;
NKJV	Matthew	10	36	and ( BC ) ‘ a man ’ s enemies will be those of his own household. ’
NKJV	Matthew	10	37	( BD ) He who loves father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me . And he who loves son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me .
NKJV	Matthew	10	38	( BE ) And he who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me .
NKJV	Matthew	10	39	( BF ) He who finds his life will lose it , and he who loses his life for My sake will find it . A Cup of Cold Water ( BG )
NKJV	Matthew	10	40	( BH ) “ He who receives you receives Me , and he who receives Me receives Him who sent Me .
NKJV	Matthew	10	41	( BI ) He who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet ’ s reward . And he who receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man ’ s reward .

NKJV	Matthew	11	11	“ Assuredly , I say to you , among those born of women there has not risen one greater than John the Baptist ; but he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he .
NKJV	Matthew	11	2	( C ) And when John had heard ( D ) in prison about the works of Christ , he [ a ] sent two of his disciples
NKJV	Matthew	11	3	and said to Him , “ Are You ( E ) the Coming One , or do we look for another ? ”
NKJV	Matthew	11	4	Jesus answered and said to them , “ Go and tell John the things which you hear and see :
NKJV	Matthew	11	5	( F ) The blind see and the lame walk ; the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear ; the dead are raised up and ( G ) the poor have the gospel preached to them .
NKJV	Matthew	11	6	And blessed is he who is not ( H ) offended because of Me. ”
NKJV	Matthew	11	7	( I ) As they departed , Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John : “ What did you go out into the wilderness to see ? ( J ) A reed shaken by the wind ?
NKJV	Matthew	11	8	But what did you go out to see ? A man clothed in soft garments ? Indeed , those who wear soft clothing are in kings ’ houses .
NKJV	Matthew	11	9	But what did you go out to see ? A prophet ? Yes , I say to you , ( K ) and more than a prophet .
NKJV	Matthew	11	10	For this is he of whom it is written : ( L ) ‘ Behold , I send My messenger before Your face , Who will prepare Your way before You. ’
NKJV	Matthew	11	12	( M ) And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffers violence , and the violent take it by force .
NKJV	Matthew	11	13	( N ) For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John .
NKJV	Matthew	11	14	And if you are willing to receive it , he is ( O ) Elijah who is to come .
NKJV	Matthew	11	15	( P ) He who has ears to hear , let him hear !
NKJV	Matthew	11	16	( Q ) “ But to what shall I liken this generation ? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling to their companions ,
NKJV	Matthew	11	17	and saying : ‘ We played the flute for you , And you did not dance ; We mourned to you , And you did not [ b ] lament. ’
NKJV	Matthew	11	18	For John came neither eating nor drinking , and they say , ‘ He has a demon. ’
NKJV	Matthew	11	19	The Son of Man came eating and drinking , and they say , ‘ Look , a glutton and a [ c ] winebibber , ( R ) a friend of tax collectors and sinners ! ’ ( S ) But wisdom is justified by her [ d ] children. ” Woe to the Impenitent Cities ( T )
NKJV	Matthew	11	20	( U ) Then He began to rebuke the cities in which most of His mighty works had been done , because they did not repent :
NKJV	Matthew	11	21	“ Woe to you , Chorazin ! Woe to you , Bethsaida ! For if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon , they would have repented long ago ( V ) in sackcloth and ashes .
NKJV	Matthew	11	22	But I say to you , ( W ) it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than for you .
NKJV	Matthew	11	23	And you , Capernaum , ( X ) who [ e ] are exalted to heaven , will be brought down to Hades ; for if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in Sodom , it would have remained until this day .
NKJV	Matthew	11	24	But I say to you ( Y ) that it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for you. ” Jesus Gives True Rest ( Z )
NKJV	Matthew	11	25	( AA ) At that time Jesus answered and said , “ I thank You , Father , Lord of heaven and earth , that ( AB ) You have hidden these things from the wise and prudent ( AC ) and have revealed them to babes .
NKJV	Matthew	11	26	Even so , Father , for so it seemed good in Your sight .
NKJV	Matthew	11	27	( AD ) All things have been delivered to Me by My Father , and no one knows the Son except the Father . ( AE ) Nor does anyone know the Father except the Son , and the one to whom the Son wills to reveal Him .
NKJV	Matthew	11	28	Come to ( AF ) Me , all you who labor and are heavy laden , and I will give you rest .
NKJV	Matthew	11	29	Take My yoke upon you ( AG ) and learn from Me , for I am [ f ] gentle and ( AH ) lowly in heart , ( AI ) and you will find rest for your souls .

NKJV	Matthew	12	12	Of how much more value then is a man than a sheep ? Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath. ”
NKJV	Matthew	12	2	And when the Pharisees saw it , they said to Him , “ Look , Your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath ! ”
NKJV	Matthew	12	3	But He said to them , “ Have you not read ( D ) what David did when he was hungry , he and those who were with him :
NKJV	Matthew	12	4	how he entered the house of God and ate ( E ) the showbread which was not lawful for him to eat , nor for those who were with him , ( F ) but only for the priests ?
NKJV	Matthew	12	5	Or have you not read in the ( G ) law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple [ a ] profane the Sabbath , and are blameless ?

NKJV	Matthew	12	7	But if you had known what this means , ( I ) ‘ I desire mercy and not sacrifice , ’ you would not have condemned the guiltless .
NKJV	Matthew	12	8	For the Son of Man is Lord [ b ] even of the Sabbath. ” Healing on the Sabbath ( J )
NKJV	Matthew	12	9	( K ) Now when He had departed from there , He went into their synagogue .
NKJV	Matthew	12	10	And behold , there was a man who had a withered hand . And they asked Him , saying , ( L ) “ Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath ? ” —that they might accuse Him .
NKJV	Matthew	12	11	Then He said to them , “ What man is there among you who has one sheep , and if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath , will not lay hold of it and lift it out ?
NKJV	Matthew	12	13	Then He said to the man , “ Stretch out your hand. ” And he stretched it out , and it was restored as whole as the other .
NKJV	Matthew	12	14	Then ( M ) the Pharisees went out and plotted against Him , how they might destroy Him . Behold , My Servant
NKJV	Matthew	12	15	But when Jesus knew it , ( N ) He withdrew from there . ( O ) And great [ c ] multitudes followed Him , and He healed them all .
NKJV	Matthew	12	16	Yet He ( P ) warned them not to make Him known ,
NKJV	Matthew	12	17	that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet , saying :
NKJV	Matthew	12	18	“ Behold ! ( Q ) My Servant whom I have chosen , My Beloved ( R ) in whom My soul is well pleased ! I will put My Spirit upon Him , And He will declare justice to the Gentiles .
NKJV	Matthew	12	19	He will not quarrel nor cry out , Nor will anyone hear His voice in the streets .
NKJV	Matthew	12	20	A bruised reed He will not break , And smoking flax He will not quench , Till He sends forth justice to victory ;
NKJV	Matthew	12	21	And in His name Gentiles will trust. ” A House Divided Can not Stand ( S )
NKJV	Matthew	12	22	( T ) Then one was brought to Him who was demon-possessed , blind and mute ; and He healed him , so that the [ d ] blind and mute man both spoke and saw .
NKJV	Matthew	12	23	And all the multitudes were amazed and said , “ Could this be the ( U ) Son of David ? ”
NKJV	Matthew	12	24	( V ) Now when the Pharisees heard it they said , “ This fellow does not cast out demons except by [ e ] Beelzebub , the ruler of the demons. ”
NKJV	Matthew	12	25	But Jesus ( W ) knew their thoughts , and said to them : “ Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation , and every city or house divided against itself will not stand .
NKJV	Matthew	12	26	If Satan casts out Satan , he is divided against himself . How then will his kingdom stand ?
NKJV	Matthew	12	27	And if I cast out demons by Beelzebub , by whom do your sons cast them out ? Therefore they shall be your judges .
NKJV	Matthew	12	28	But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God , ( X ) surely the kingdom of God has come upon you .
NKJV	Matthew	12	29	( Y ) Or how can one enter a strong man ’ s house and plunder his goods , unless he first binds the strong man ? And then he will plunder his house .
NKJV	Matthew	12	30	He who is not with Me is against Me , and he who does not gather with Me scatters abroad . The Unpardonable Sin ( Z )
NKJV	Matthew	12	31	“ Therefore I say to you , ( AA ) every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men , ( AB ) but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven men .
NKJV	Matthew	12	32	Anyone who ( AC ) speaks a word against the Son of Man , ( AD ) it will be forgiven him ; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit , it will not be forgiven him , either in this age or in the age to come . A Tree Known by Its Fruit ( AE )
NKJV	Matthew	12	33	“ Either make the tree good and ( AF ) its fruit good , or else make the tree bad and its fruit bad ; for a tree is known by its fruit .
NKJV	Matthew	12	34	( AG ) Brood [ f ] of vipers ! How can you , being evil , speak good things ? ( AH ) For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks .
NKJV	Matthew	12	35	A good man out of the good treasure [ g ] of his heart brings forth good things , and an evil man out of the evil treasure brings forth evil things .
NKJV	Matthew	12	36	But I say to you that for every idle word men may speak , they will give account of it in the day of judgment .
NKJV	Matthew	12	37	For by your words you will be justified , and by your words you will be condemned. ” The Scribes and Pharisees Ask for a Sign ( AI )
NKJV	Matthew	12	38	( AJ ) Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered , saying , “ Teacher , we want to see a sign from You. ”
NKJV	Matthew	12	39	But He answered and said to them , “ An evil and ( AK ) adulterous generation seeks after a sign , and no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah .
NKJV	Matthew	12	40	( AL ) For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish , so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth .
NKJV	Matthew	12	41	( AM ) The men of Nineveh will rise up in the judgment with this generation and ( AN ) condemn it , ( AO ) because they repented at the preaching of Jonah ; and indeed a greater than Jonah is here .
NKJV	Matthew	12	42	( AP ) The queen of the South will rise up in the judgment with this generation and condemn it , for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon ; and indeed a greater than Solomon is here . An Unclean Spirit Returns ( AQ )
NKJV	Matthew	12	43	( AR ) “ When an unclean spirit goes out of a man , ( AS ) he goes through dry places , seeking rest , and finds none .
NKJV	Matthew	12	44	Then he says , ‘ I will return to my house from which I came. ’ And when he comes , he finds it empty , swept , and put in order .
NKJV	Matthew	12	45	Then he goes and takes with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself , and they enter and dwell there ; ( AT ) and the last state of that man is worse than the first . So shall it also be with this wicked generation. ” Jesus ’ Mother and Brothers Send for Him ( AU )
NKJV	Matthew	12	46	While He was still talking to the multitudes , ( AV ) behold , His mother and ( AW ) brothers stood outside , seeking to speak with Him .
NKJV	Matthew	12	47	Then one said to Him , “ Look , ( AX ) Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside , seeking to speak with You. ”
NKJV	Matthew	12	48	But He answered and said to the one who told Him , “ Who is My mother and who are My brothers ? ”
NKJV	Matthew	12	49	And He stretched out His hand toward His disciples and said , “ Here are My mother and My ( AY ) brothers !
NKJV	Matthew	12	50	For ( AZ ) whoever does the will of My Father in heaven is My brother and sister and mother. ” Footnotes - Matthew 12:5 desecrate - Matthew 12:8 NU , M omit even - Matthew 12:15 NU brackets multitudes as disputed . - Matthew 12:22 NU omits blind and - Matthew 12:24 NU , M Beelzebul , a Philistine deity - Matthew 12:34 Offspring - Matthew 12:35 NU , M omit of his heart Scripture taken from the New King James Version® .

NKJV	Matthew	13	3	Then He spoke many things to them in parables , saying : ( E ) “ Behold , a sower went out to sow .
NKJV	Matthew	13	4	And as he sowed , some seed fell by the wayside ; and the birds came and devoured them .
NKJV	Matthew	13	5	Some fell on stony places , where they did not have much earth ; and they immediately sprang up because they had no depth of earth .
NKJV	Matthew	13	6	But when the sun was up they were scorched , and because they had no root they withered away .
NKJV	Matthew	13	7	And some fell among thorns , and the thorns sprang up and choked them .
NKJV	Matthew	13	8	But others fell on good ground and yielded a crop : some ( F ) a hundredfold , some sixty , some thirty .
NKJV	Matthew	13	9	( G ) He who has ears to hear , let him hear ! ” The Purpose of Parables ( H )
NKJV	Matthew	13	10	And the disciples came and said to Him , “ Why do You speak to them in parables ? ”
NKJV	Matthew	13	11	He answered and said to them , “ Because ( I ) it has been given to you to know the [ a ] mysteries of the kingdom of heaven , but to them it has not been given .
NKJV	Matthew	13	12	( J ) For whoever has , to him more will be given , and he will have abundance ; but whoever does not have , even what he has will be taken away from him .
NKJV	Matthew	13	14	And in them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled , which says : ( K ) ‘ Hearing you will hear and shall not understand , And seeing you will see and not ( L ) perceive ;
NKJV	Matthew	13	15	For the hearts of this people have grown dull . Their ears ( M ) are hard of hearing , And their eyes they have ( N ) closed , Lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears , Lest they should understand with their hearts and turn , So that I [ b ] should ( O ) heal them. ’
NKJV	Matthew	13	16	But ( P ) blessed are your eyes for they see , and your ears for they hear ;
NKJV	Matthew	13	17	for assuredly , I say to you ( Q ) that many prophets and righteous men desired to see what you see , and did not see it , and to hear what you hear , and did not hear it . The Parable of the Sower Explained ( R )
NKJV	Matthew	13	18	( S ) “ Therefore hear the parable of the sower :
NKJV	Matthew	13	19	When anyone hears the word ( T ) of the kingdom , and does not understand it , then the wicked one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart . This is he who received seed by the wayside .
NKJV	Matthew	13	20	But he who received the seed on stony places , this is he who hears the word and immediately ( U ) receives it with joy ;
NKJV	Matthew	13	21	yet he has no root in himself , but endures only for a while . For when ( V ) tribulation or persecution arises because of the word , immediately ( W ) he stumbles .
NKJV	Matthew	13	22	Now ( X ) he who received seed ( Y ) among the thorns is he who hears the word , and the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word , and he becomes unfruitful .
NKJV	Matthew	13	23	But he who received seed on the good ground is he who hears the word and understands it , who indeed bears ( Z ) fruit and produces : some a hundredfold , some sixty , some thirty. ” The Parable of the Wheat and the Tares
NKJV	Matthew	13	24	Another parable He put forth to them , saying : “ The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field ;
NKJV	Matthew	13	25	but while men slept , his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat and went his way .
NKJV	Matthew	13	26	But when the grain had sprouted and produced a crop , then the tares also appeared .
NKJV	Matthew	13	27	So the servants of the owner came and said to him , ‘ Sir , did you not sow good seed in your field ? How then does it have tares ? ’
NKJV	Matthew	13	28	He said to them , ‘ An enemy has done this. ’ The servants said to him , ‘ Do you want us then to go and gather them up ? ’
NKJV	Matthew	13	29	But he said , ‘ No , lest while you gather up the tares you also uproot the wheat with them .
NKJV	Matthew	13	30	Let both grow together until the harvest , and at the time of harvest I will say to the reapers , “ First gather together the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them , but ( AA ) gather the wheat into my barn. ” ’ ” The Parable of the Mustard Seed ( AB )
NKJV	Matthew	13	31	Another parable He put forth to them , saying : ( AC ) “ The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed , which a man took and sowed in his field ,
NKJV	Matthew	13	32	which indeed is the least of all the seeds ; but when it is grown it is greater than the herbs and becomes a ( AD ) tree , so that the birds of the air come and nest in its branches. ” The Parable of the Leaven ( AE )
NKJV	Matthew	13	33	( AF ) Another parable He spoke to them : “ The kingdom of heaven is like leaven , which a woman took and hid in three [ c ] measures of meal till ( AG ) it was all leavened. ” Prophecy and the Parables
NKJV	Matthew	13	34	( AH ) All these things Jesus spoke to the multitude in parables ; and without a parable He did not speak to them ,
NKJV	Matthew	13	35	that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet , saying : ( AI ) “ I will open My mouth in parables ; ( AJ ) I will utter things kept secret from the foundation of the world. ” The Parable of the Tares Explained
NKJV	Matthew	13	36	Then Jesus sent the multitude away and went into the house . And His disciples came to Him , saying , “ Explain to us the parable of the tares of the field. ”
NKJV	Matthew	13	37	He answered and said to them : “ He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man .
NKJV	Matthew	13	38	( AK ) The field is the world , the good seeds are the sons of the kingdom , but the tares are ( AL ) the sons of the wicked one .
NKJV	Matthew	13	39	The enemy who sowed them is the devil , ( AM ) the harvest is the end of the age , and the reapers are the angels .
NKJV	Matthew	13	40	Therefore as the tares are gathered and burned in the fire , so it will be at the end of this age .
NKJV	Matthew	13	41	The Son of Man will send out His angels , ( AN ) and they will gather out of His kingdom all things that offend , and those who practice lawlessness ,
NKJV	Matthew	13	42	( AO ) and will cast them into the furnace of fire . ( AP ) There will be wailing and gnashing of teeth .
NKJV	Matthew	13	43	( AQ ) Then the righteous will shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father . ( AR ) He who has ears to hear , let him hear ! The Parable of the Hidden Treasure
NKJV	Matthew	13	44	“ Again , the kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field , which a man found and hid ; and for joy over it he goes and ( AS ) sells all that he has and ( AT ) buys that field . The Parable of the Pearl of Great Price
NKJV	Matthew	13	45	“ Again , the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking beautiful pearls ,
NKJV	Matthew	13	46	who , when he had found ( AU ) one pearl of great price , went and sold all that he had and bought it . The Parable of the Dragnet
NKJV	Matthew	13	47	“ Again , the kingdom of heaven is like a dragnet that was cast into the sea and ( AV ) gathered some of every kind ,
NKJV	Matthew	13	48	which , when it was full , they drew to shore ; and they sat down and gathered the good into vessels , but threw the bad away .
NKJV	Matthew	13	49	So it will be at the end of the age . The angels will come forth , ( AW ) separate the wicked from among the just ,
NKJV	Matthew	13	50	and cast them into the furnace of fire . There will be wailing and gnashing of teeth. ”
NKJV	Matthew	13	51	[ d ] Jesus said to them , “ Have you understood all these things ? ” They said to Him , “ Yes , [ e ] Lord. ”
NKJV	Matthew	13	52	Then He said to them , “ Therefore every [ f ] scribe instructed [ g ] concerning the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings out of his treasure ( AX ) things new and old. ” Jesus Rejected at Nazareth ( AY )
NKJV	Matthew	13	53	Now it came to pass , when Jesus had finished these parables , that He departed from there .
NKJV	Matthew	13	54	( AZ ) When He had come to His own country , He taught them in their synagogue , so that they were astonished and said , “ Where did this Man get this wisdom and these mighty works ?
NKJV	Matthew	13	55	( BA ) Is this not the carpenter ’ s son ? Is not His mother called Mary ? And ( BB ) His brothers ( BC ) James , [ h ] Joses , Simon , and Judas ?
NKJV	Matthew	13	56	And His sisters , are they not all with us ? Where then did this Man get all these things ? ”
NKJV	Matthew	13	57	So they ( BD ) were offended at Him . But Jesus said to them , ( BE ) “ A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and in his own house. ”
NKJV	Matthew	13	58	Now ( BF ) He did not do many mighty works there because of their unbelief . Footnotes - Matthew 13:11 secret or hidden truths - Matthew 13:15 NU , M would - Matthew 13:33 Gr . sata , same as a Heb . seah ; approximately

NKJV	Matthew	14	14	And when Jesus went out He saw a great multitude ; and He ( H ) was moved with compassion for them , and healed their sick .
NKJV	Matthew	14	2	and said to his servants , “ This is John the Baptist ; he is risen from the dead , and therefore these powers are at work in him. ”
NKJV	Matthew	14	3	( C ) For Herod had laid hold of John and bound him , and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias , his brother Philip ’ s wife .
NKJV	Matthew	14	4	Because John had said to him , ( D ) “ It is not lawful for you to have her. ”
NKJV	Matthew	14	5	And although he wanted to put him to death , he feared the multitude , ( E ) because they counted him as a prophet .
NKJV	Matthew	14	6	But when Herod ’ s birthday was celebrated , the daughter of Herodias danced before them and pleased Herod .
NKJV	Matthew	14	7	Therefore he promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask .
NKJV	Matthew	14	8	So she , having been prompted by her mother , said , “ Give me John the Baptist ’ s head here on a platter. ”
NKJV	Matthew	14	9	And the king was sorry ; nevertheless , because of the oaths and because of those who sat with him , he commanded it to be given to her .
NKJV	Matthew	14	10	So he sent and had John beheaded in prison .
NKJV	Matthew	14	11	And his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl , and she brought it to her mother .
NKJV	Matthew	14	12	Then his disciples came and took away the body and buried it , and went and told Jesus . Feeding the Five Thousand ( F )
NKJV	Matthew	14	13	( G ) When Jesus heard it , He departed from there by boat to a deserted place by Himself . But when the multitudes heard it , they followed Him on foot from the cities .
NKJV	Matthew	14	15	( I ) When it was evening , His disciples came to Him , saying , “ This is a deserted place , and the hour is already late . Send the multitudes away , that they may go into the villages and buy themselves food. ”
NKJV	Matthew	14	16	But Jesus said to them , “ They do not need to go away . You give them something to eat. ”
NKJV	Matthew	14	17	And they said to Him , “ We have here only five loaves and two fish. ”
NKJV	Matthew	14	18	He said , “ Bring them here to Me. ”
NKJV	Matthew	14	19	Then He commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass . And He took the five loaves and the two fish , and looking up to heaven , ( J ) He blessed and broke and gave the loaves to the disciples ; and the disciples gave to the multitudes .
NKJV	Matthew	14	20	So they all ate and were filled , and they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments that remained .
NKJV	Matthew	14	21	Now those who had eaten were about five thousand men , besides women and children . Jesus Walks on the Sea ( K )
NKJV	Matthew	14	22	Immediately Jesus [ a ] made His disciples get into the boat and go before Him to the other side , while He sent the multitudes away .
NKJV	Matthew	14	23	( L ) And when He had sent the multitudes away , He went up on the mountain by Himself to pray . ( M ) Now when evening came , He was alone there .
NKJV	Matthew	14	24	But the boat was now [ b ] in the middle of the sea , tossed by the waves , for the wind was contrary .
NKJV	Matthew	14	25	Now in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went to them , walking on the sea .
NKJV	Matthew	14	26	And when the disciples saw Him ( N ) walking on the sea , they were troubled , saying , “ It is a ghost ! ” And they cried out for fear .
NKJV	Matthew	14	27	But immediately Jesus spoke to them , saying , [ c ] “ Be of good ( O ) cheer ! [ d ] It is I ; do not be afraid. ”
NKJV	Matthew	14	28	And Peter answered Him and said , “ Lord , if it is You , command me to come to You on the water. ”
NKJV	Matthew	14	29	So He said , “ Come. ” And when Peter had come down out of the boat , he walked on the water to go to Jesus .
NKJV	Matthew	14	30	But when he saw [ e ] that the wind was boisterous , he was afraid ; and beginning to sink he cried out , saying , “ Lord , save me ! ”
NKJV	Matthew	14	31	And immediately Jesus stretched out His hand and caught him , and said to him , “ O you of ( P ) little faith , why did you doubt ? ”
NKJV	Matthew	14	32	And when they got into the boat , the wind ceased .
NKJV	Matthew	14	33	Then those who were in the boat [ f ] came and worshiped Him , saying , “ Truly ( Q ) You are the Son of God. ” Many Touch Him and Are Made Well ( R )
NKJV	Matthew	14	34	( S ) When they had crossed over , they came [ g ] to the land of Gennesaret .
NKJV	Matthew	14	35	And when the men of that place recognized Him , they sent out into all that surrounding region , brought to Him all who were sick ,
NKJV	Matthew	14	36	and begged Him that they might only ( T ) touch the hem of His garment . And ( U ) as many as touched it were made perfectly well .

NKJV	Matthew	15	15	( N ) Then Peter answered and said to Him , “ Explain this parable to us. ”
NKJV	Matthew	15	2	( C ) “ Why do Your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders ? For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread. ”
NKJV	Matthew	15	3	He answered and said to them , “ Why do you also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition ?
NKJV	Matthew	15	4	For God commanded , saying , ( D ) ‘ Honor your father and your mother ’ ; and , ( E ) ‘ He who curses father or mother , let him be put to death. ’
NKJV	Matthew	15	5	But you say , ‘ Whoever says to his father or mother , ( F ) “ Whatever profit you might have received from me is a gift to God ” —
NKJV	Matthew	15	6	then he need not honor his father [ a ] or mother. ’ Thus you have made the [ b ] commandment of God of no effect by your tradition .
NKJV	Matthew	15	7	( G ) Hypocrites ! Well did Isaiah prophesy about you , saying :
NKJV	Matthew	15	8	‘ These ( H ) people [ c ] draw near to Me with their mouth , And honor Me with their lips , But their heart is far from Me .
NKJV	Matthew	15	9	And in vain they worship Me , ( I ) Teaching as doctrines the commandments of men. ’ ”
NKJV	Matthew	15	10	( J ) When He had called the multitude to Himself , He said to them , “ Hear and understand :
NKJV	Matthew	15	11	( K ) Not what goes into the mouth defiles a man ; but what comes out of the mouth , this defiles a man. ”
NKJV	Matthew	15	12	Then His disciples came and said to Him , “ Do You know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying ? ”
NKJV	Matthew	15	13	But He answered and said , ( L ) “ Every plant which My heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted .
NKJV	Matthew	15	14	Let them alone . ( M ) They are blind leaders of the blind . And if the blind leads the blind , both will fall into a ditch. ”
NKJV	Matthew	15	16	So Jesus said , ( O ) “ Are you also still without understanding ?
NKJV	Matthew	15	17	Do you not yet understand that ( P ) whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and is eliminated ?
NKJV	Matthew	15	18	But ( Q ) those things which proceed out of the mouth come from the heart , and they defile a man .
NKJV	Matthew	15	19	( R ) For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts , murders , adulteries , fornications , thefts , false witness , blasphemies .
NKJV	Matthew	15	20	These are the things which defile a man , but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile a man. ” A Gentile Shows Her Faith ( S )
NKJV	Matthew	15	21	( T ) Then Jesus went out from there and departed to the region of Tyre and Sidon .
NKJV	Matthew	15	22	And behold , a woman of Canaan came from that region and cried out to Him , saying , “ Have mercy on me , O Lord , ( U ) Son of David ! My daughter is severely demon-possessed. ”
NKJV	Matthew	15	23	But He answered her not a word . And His disciples came and urged Him , saying , “ Send her away , for she cries out after us. ”
NKJV	Matthew	15	24	But He answered and said , ( V ) “ I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. ”
NKJV	Matthew	15	25	Then she came and worshiped Him , saying , “ Lord , help me ! ”
NKJV	Matthew	15	26	But He answered and said , “ It is not good to take the children ’ s bread and throw it to the little ( W ) dogs. ”
NKJV	Matthew	15	27	And she said , “ Yes , Lord , yet even the little dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters ’ table. ”
NKJV	Matthew	15	28	Then Jesus answered and said to her , “ O woman , ( X ) great is your faith ! Let it be to you as you desire. ” And her daughter was healed from that very hour . Jesus Heals Great Multitudes ( Y )
NKJV	Matthew	15	29	( Z ) Jesus departed from there , ( AA ) skirted the Sea of Galilee , and went up on the mountain and sat down there .
NKJV	Matthew	15	30	( AB ) Then great multitudes came to Him , having with them the lame , blind , mute , [ d ] maimed , and many others ; and they laid them down at Jesus ’ ( AC ) feet , and He healed them .
NKJV	Matthew	15	31	So the multitude marveled when they saw the mute speaking , the [ e ] maimed made whole , the lame walking , and the blind seeing ; and they ( AD ) glorified the God of Israel . Feeding the Four Thousand ( AE )
NKJV	Matthew	15	32	( AF ) Now Jesus called His disciples to Himself and said , “ I have compassion on the multitude , because they have now continued with Me three days and have nothing to eat . And I do not want to send them away hungry , lest they faint on the way. ”
NKJV	Matthew	15	33	( AG ) Then His disciples said to Him , “ Where could we get enough bread in the wilderness to fill such a great multitude ? ”
NKJV	Matthew	15	34	Jesus said to them , “ How many loaves do you have ? ” And they said , “ Seven , and a few little fish. ”
NKJV	Matthew	15	35	So He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground .
NKJV	Matthew	15	36	And ( AH ) He took the seven loaves and the fish and ( AI ) gave thanks , broke them and gave them to His disciples ; and the disciples gave to the multitude .
NKJV	Matthew	15	37	So they all ate and were filled , and they took up seven large baskets full of the fragments that were left .
NKJV	Matthew	15	38	Now those who ate were four thousand men , besides women and children .
NKJV	Matthew	15	39	( AJ ) And He sent away the multitude , got into the boat , and came to the region of [ f ] Magdala .

NKJV	Matthew	16	7	And they reasoned among themselves , saying , “ It is because we have taken no bread. ”
NKJV	Matthew	16	8	But Jesus , being aware of it , said to them , “ O you of little faith , why do you reason among yourselves because you [ d ] have brought no bread ?

NKJV	Matthew	16	10	( H ) Nor the seven loaves of the four thousand and how many large baskets you took up ?
NKJV	Matthew	16	11	How is it you do not understand that I did not speak to you concerning bread ? —but to beware of the [ e ] leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees. ”

NKJV	Matthew	16	15	He said to them , “ But who do ( M ) you say that I am ? ”
NKJV	Matthew	16	17	Jesus answered and said to him , “ Blessed are you , Simon Bar-Jonah , ( O ) for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you , but ( P ) My Father who is in heaven .

NKJV	Matthew	16	22	Then Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him , saying , [ i ] “ Far be it from You , Lord ; this shall not happen to You ! ”

NKJV	Matthew	16	24	( AA ) Then Jesus said to His disciples , “ If anyone desires to come after Me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and ( AB ) follow Me .

NKJV	Matthew	17	10	And His disciples asked Him , saying , ( I ) “ Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first ? ”
NKJV	Matthew	17	11	Jesus answered and said to them , “ Indeed , Elijah is coming [ b ] first and will ( J ) restore all things .

NKJV	Matthew	18	25	But as he was not able to pay , his master commanded ( AB ) that he be sold , with his wife and children and all that he had , and that payment be made .
NKJV	Matthew	18	26	The servant therefore fell down before him , saying , ‘ Master , have patience with me , and I will pay you all. ’
NKJV	Matthew	18	27	Then the master of that servant was moved with compassion , released him , and forgave him the debt .
NKJV	Matthew	18	28	“ But that servant went out and found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii ; and he laid hands on him and took him by the throat , saying , ‘ Pay me what you owe ! ’

NKJV	Matthew	19	8	He said to them , “ Moses , because of the ( H ) hardness of your hearts , permitted you to divorce your ( I ) wives , but from the beginning it was not so .

NKJV	Matthew	19	18	He said to Him , “ Which ones ? ” Jesus said , ( V ) “ ‘ You shall not murder , ’ ‘ You shall not commit adultery , ’ ‘ You shall not steal , ’ ‘ You shall not bear false witness , ’
NKJV	Matthew	19	20	The young man said to Him , “ All these things I have ( Y ) kept [ g ] from my youth . What do I still lack ? ”
NKJV	Matthew	19	21	Jesus said to him , “ If you want to be perfect , ( Z ) go , sell what you have and give to the poor , and you will have treasure in heaven ; and come , follow Me. ”
NKJV	Matthew	19	22	But when the young man heard that saying , he went away sorrowful , for he had great possessions . With God All Things Are Possible ( AA )

NKJV	Matthew	19	25	When His disciples heard it , they were greatly astonished , saying , “ Who then can be saved ? ”
NKJV	Matthew	19	26	But Jesus looked at them and said to them , “ With men this is impossible , but ( AC ) with God all things are possible. ”
NKJV	Matthew	19	27	Then Peter answered and said to Him , “ See , ( AD ) we have left all and followed You . Therefore what shall we have ? ”
NKJV	Matthew	19	28	So Jesus said to them , “ Assuredly I say to you , that in the regeneration , when the Son of Man sits on the throne of His glory , ( AE ) you who have followed Me will also sit on twelve thrones , judging the twelve tribes of Israel .

NKJV	Matthew	21	16	and said to Him , “ Do You hear what these are saying ? ” And Jesus said to them , “ Yes . Have you never read , ( Q ) ‘ Out of the mouth of babes and nursing infants You have perfected praise ’ ? ”
NKJV	Matthew	21	17	Then He left them and ( R ) went out of the city to Bethany , and He lodged there . The Fig Tree Withered ( S )
NKJV	Matthew	21	18	( T ) Now in the morning , as He returned to the city , He was hungry .
NKJV	Matthew	21	19	( U ) And seeing a fig tree by the road , He came to it and found nothing on it but leaves , and said to it , “ Let no fruit grow on you ever again. ” Immediately the fig tree withered away . The Lesson of the Withered Fig Tree ( V )
NKJV	Matthew	21	20	( W ) And when the disciples saw it , they marveled , saying , “ How did the fig tree wither away so soon ? ”
NKJV	Matthew	21	22	And ( AA ) whatever things you ask in prayer , believing , you will receive. ” Jesus ’ Authority Questioned ( AB )
NKJV	Matthew	21	23	( AC ) Now when He came into the temple , the chief priests and the elders of the people confronted Him as He was teaching , and ( AD ) said , “ By what authority are You doing these things ? And who gave You this authority ? ”
NKJV	Matthew	21	24	But Jesus answered and said to them , “ I also will ask you one thing , which if you tell Me , I likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things :
NKJV	Matthew	21	25	The ( AE ) baptism of ( AF ) John—where was it from ? From heaven or from men ? ” And they reasoned among themselves , saying , “ If we say , ‘ From heaven , ’ He will say to us , ‘ Why then did you not believe him ? ’
NKJV	Matthew	21	26	But if we say , ‘ From men , ’ we ( AG ) fear the multitude , ( AH ) for all count John as a prophet. ”
NKJV	Matthew	21	27	So they answered Jesus and said , “ We do not know. ” And He said to them , “ Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things . The Parable of the Two Sons
NKJV	Matthew	21	28	“ But what do you think ? A man had two sons , and he came to the first and said , ‘ Son , go , work today in my ( AI ) vineyard. ’
NKJV	Matthew	21	29	He answered and said , ‘ I will not , ’ but afterward he regretted it and went .
NKJV	Matthew	21	30	Then he came to the second and said likewise . And he answered and said , ‘ I go , sir , ’ but he did not go .
NKJV	Matthew	21	31	Which of the two did the will of his father ? ” They said to Him , “ The first. ” Jesus said to them , ( AJ ) “ Assuredly , I say to you that tax collectors and harlots enter the kingdom of God before you .
NKJV	Matthew	21	32	For ( AK ) John came to you in the way of righteousness , and you did not believe him ; ( AL ) but tax collectors and harlots believed him ; and when you saw it , you did not afterward [ f ] relent and believe him . The Parable of the Wicked Vinedressers ( AM )
NKJV	Matthew	21	33	“ Hear another parable : There was a certain landowner ( AN ) who planted a vineyard and set a hedge around it , dug a winepress in it and built a tower . And he leased it to vinedressers and ( AO ) went into a far country .
NKJV	Matthew	21	34	Now when vintage-time drew near , he sent his servants to the vinedressers , that they might receive its fruit .
NKJV	Matthew	21	35	( AP ) And the vinedressers took his servants , beat one , killed one , and stoned another .
NKJV	Matthew	21	36	Again he sent other servants , more than the first , and they did likewise to them .
NKJV	Matthew	21	37	Then last of all he sent his ( AQ ) son to them , saying , ‘ They will respect my son. ’
NKJV	Matthew	21	38	But when the vinedressers saw the son , they said among themselves , ( AR ) ‘ This is the heir . ( AS ) Come , let us kill him and seize his inheritance. ’
NKJV	Matthew	21	39	( AT ) So they took him and cast him out of the vineyard and killed him .
NKJV	Matthew	21	40	“ Therefore , when the owner of the vineyard comes , what will he do to those vinedressers ? ”
NKJV	Matthew	21	41	( AU ) They said to Him , ( AV ) “ He will destroy those wicked men miserably , ( AW ) and lease his vineyard to other vinedressers who will [ g ] render to him the fruits in their seasons. ”
NKJV	Matthew	21	42	Jesus said to them , “ Have you never read in the Scriptures : ( AX ) ‘ The stone which the builders rejected Has become the chief cornerstone . This was the Lord ’ s doing , And it is marvelous in our eyes ’ ?
NKJV	Matthew	21	43	“ Therefore I say to you , ( AY ) the kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to a nation bearing the fruits of it .
NKJV	Matthew	21	44	And ( AZ ) whoever falls on this stone will be broken ; but on whomever it falls , ( BA ) it will grind him to powder. ”
NKJV	Matthew	21	45	Now when the chief priests and Pharisees heard His parables , they [ h ] perceived that He was speaking of them .
NKJV	Matthew	21	46	But when they sought to lay hands on Him , they ( BB ) feared the multitudes , because ( BC ) they took Him for a prophet .

NKJV	Matthew	22	22	When they had heard these words , they marveled , and left Him and went their way . The Sadducees : What About the Resurrection ? ( Q )
NKJV	Matthew	22	2	“ The kingdom of heaven is like a certain king who arranged a marriage for his son ,
NKJV	Matthew	22	3	and sent out his servants to call those who were invited to the wedding ; and they were not willing to come .
NKJV	Matthew	22	4	Again , he sent out other servants , saying , ‘ Tell those who are invited , “ See , I have prepared my dinner ; ( C ) my oxen and fatted cattle are killed , and all things are ready . Come to the wedding. ” ’
NKJV	Matthew	22	5	But they made light of it and went their ways , one to his own farm , another to his business .
NKJV	Matthew	22	6	And the rest seized his servants , treated them [ a ] spitefully , and killed them .
NKJV	Matthew	22	7	But when the king heard about it , he was furious . And he sent out ( D ) his armies , destroyed those murderers , and burned up their city .
NKJV	Matthew	22	8	Then he said to his servants , ‘ The wedding is ready , but those who were invited were not ( E ) worthy .
NKJV	Matthew	22	9	Therefore go into the highways , and as many as you find , invite to the wedding. ’
NKJV	Matthew	22	10	So those servants went out into the highways and ( F ) gathered together all whom they found , both bad and good . And the wedding hall was filled with guests .
NKJV	Matthew	22	11	“ But when the king came in to see the guests , he saw a man there ( G ) who did not have on a wedding garment .
NKJV	Matthew	22	12	So he said to him , ‘ Friend , how did you come in here without a wedding garment ? ’ And he was ( H ) speechless .
NKJV	Matthew	22	13	Then the king said to the servants , ‘ Bind him hand and foot , [ b ] take him away , and cast him ( I ) into outer darkness ; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. ’
NKJV	Matthew	22	14	( J ) “ For many are called , but few are chosen. ” The Pharisees : Is It Lawful to Pay Taxes to Caesar ? ( K )
NKJV	Matthew	22	15	( L ) Then the Pharisees went and plotted how they might entangle Him in His talk .
NKJV	Matthew	22	16	And they sent to Him their disciples with the ( M ) Herodians , saying , “ Teacher , we know that You are true , and teach the way of God in truth ; nor do You care about anyone , for You do not [ c ] regard the person of men .
NKJV	Matthew	22	17	Tell us , therefore , what do You think ? Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar , or not ? ”
NKJV	Matthew	22	18	But Jesus [ d ] perceived their wickedness , and said , “ Why do you test Me , you hypocrites ?
NKJV	Matthew	22	19	Show Me the tax money. ” So they brought Him a denarius .
NKJV	Matthew	22	20	And He said to them , “ Whose image and inscription is this ? ”
NKJV	Matthew	22	21	They said to Him , “ Caesar ’ s. ” And He said to them , ( N ) “ Render [ e ] therefore to Caesar the things that are ( O ) Caesar ’ s , and to God the things that are ( P ) God ’ s. ”
NKJV	Matthew	22	23	( R ) The same day the Sadducees , ( S ) who say there is no resurrection , came to Him and asked Him ,
NKJV	Matthew	22	24	saying : “ Teacher , ( T ) Moses said that if a man dies , having no children , his brother shall marry his wife and raise up offspring for his brother .
NKJV	Matthew	22	25	Now there were with us seven brothers . The first died after he had married , and having no offspring , left his wife to his brother .
NKJV	Matthew	22	26	Likewise the second also , and the third , even to the seventh .
NKJV	Matthew	22	27	Last of all the woman died also .
NKJV	Matthew	22	28	Therefore , in the resurrection , whose wife of the seven will she be ? For they all had her. ”
NKJV	Matthew	22	29	Jesus answered and said to them , “ You are [ f ] mistaken , ( U ) not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God .
NKJV	Matthew	22	30	For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage , but ( V ) are like angels [ g ] of God in heaven .
NKJV	Matthew	22	31	But concerning the resurrection of the dead , have you not read what was spoken to you by God , saying ,
NKJV	Matthew	22	32	( W ) ‘ I am the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ’ ? God is not the God of the dead , but of the living. ”
NKJV	Matthew	22	33	And when the multitudes heard this , ( X ) they were astonished at His teaching . The Scribes : Which Is the First Commandment of All ? ( Y )
NKJV	Matthew	22	34	( Z ) But when the Pharisees heard that He had silenced the Sadducees , they gathered together .
NKJV	Matthew	22	35	Then one of them , ( AA ) a lawyer , asked Him a question , testing Him , and saying ,
NKJV	Matthew	22	36	“ Teacher , which is the great commandment in the law ? ”
NKJV	Matthew	22	37	Jesus said to him , ( AB ) “ ‘ You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart , with all your soul , and with all your mind. ’
NKJV	Matthew	22	38	This is the first and great commandment .
NKJV	Matthew	22	39	And the second is like it : ( AC ) ‘ You shall love your neighbor as yourself. ’
NKJV	Matthew	22	40	( AD ) On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets. ” Jesus : How Can David Call His Descendant Lord ? ( AE )
NKJV	Matthew	22	41	( AF ) While the Pharisees were gathered together , Jesus asked them ,
NKJV	Matthew	22	42	saying , “ What do you think about the Christ ? Whose Son is He ? ” They said to Him , “ The ( AG ) Son of David. ”
NKJV	Matthew	22	43	He said to them , “ How then does David in the Spirit call Him ‘ Lord , ’ saying :
NKJV	Matthew	22	44	‘ The ( AH ) Lord said to my Lord , “ Sit at My right hand , Till I make Your enemies Your footstool ” ’ ?
NKJV	Matthew	22	45	If David then calls Him ‘ Lord , ’ how is He his Son ? ”

NKJV	Matthew	25	17	And likewise he who had received two gained two more also .
NKJV	Matthew	25	18	But he who had received one went and dug in the ground , and hid his lord ’ s money .

NKJV	Matthew	26	7	a woman came to Him having an alabaster flask of very costly fragrant oil , and she poured it on His head as He sat at the table .
NKJV	Matthew	26	8	( H ) But when His disciples saw it , they were indignant , saying , “ Why this waste ?

NKJV	Matthew	26	32	But after I have been raised , ( AN ) I will go before you to Galilee. ”
NKJV	Matthew	26	33	Peter answered and said to Him , “ Even if all are [ g ] made to stumble because of You , I will never be made to stumble. ”

NKJV	Matthew	26	37	And He took with Him Peter and ( AR ) the two sons of Zebedee , and He began to be sorrowful and deeply distressed .
NKJV	Matthew	26	38	Then He said to them , ( AS ) “ My soul is exceedingly sorrowful , even to death . Stay here and watch with Me. ”
NKJV	Matthew	26	39	He went a little farther and fell on His face , and ( AT ) prayed , saying , ( AU ) “ O My Father , if it is possible , ( AV ) let this cup pass from Me ; nevertheless , ( AW ) not as I will , but as You will. ”
NKJV	Matthew	26	40	Then He came to the disciples and found them sleeping , and said to Peter , “ What ! Could you not watch with Me one hour ?
NKJV	Matthew	26	41	( AX ) Watch and pray , lest you enter into temptation . ( AY ) The spirit indeed is willing , but the flesh is weak. ”
NKJV	Matthew	26	42	Again , a second time , He went away and prayed , saying , “ O My Father , [ h ] if this cup can not pass away from Me unless I drink it , Your will be done. ”
NKJV	Matthew	26	43	And He came and found them asleep again , for their eyes were heavy .
NKJV	Matthew	26	44	So He left them , went away again , and prayed the third time , saying the same words .
NKJV	Matthew	26	45	Then He came to His disciples and said to them , “ Are you still sleeping and resting ? Behold , the hour [ i ] is at hand , and the Son of Man is being ( AZ ) betrayed into the hands of sinners .

NKJV	Matthew	26	52	But Jesus said to him , “ Put your sword in its place , ( BF ) for all who take the sword will [ j ] perish by the sword .
NKJV	Matthew	26	53	Or do you think that I can not now pray to My Father , and He will provide Me with ( BG ) more than twelve legions of angels ?
NKJV	Matthew	26	54	How then could the Scriptures be fulfilled , ( BH ) that it must happen thus ? ”
NKJV	Matthew	26	55	In that hour Jesus said to the multitudes , “ Have you come out , as against a robber , with swords and clubs to take Me ? I sat daily with you , teaching in the temple , and you did not seize Me .

NKJV	Matthew	26	60	[ l ] but found none . Even though ( BO ) many false witnesses came forward , they found none . But at last ( BP ) two [ m ] false witnesses came forward
NKJV	Matthew	26	61	and said , “ This fellow said , ( BQ ) ‘ I am able to destroy the temple of God and to build it in three days. ’ ”
NKJV	Matthew	26	62	( BR ) And the high priest arose and said to Him , “ Do You answer nothing ? What is it these men testify against You ? ”
NKJV	Matthew	26	63	But ( BS ) Jesus kept silent . And the high priest answered and said to Him , ( BT ) “ I put You under oath by the living God : Tell us if You are the Christ , the Son of God ! ”
NKJV	Matthew	26	64	Jesus said to him , “ It is as you said . Nevertheless , I say to you , ( BU ) hereafter you will see the Son of Man ( BV ) sitting at the right hand of the Power , and coming on the clouds of heaven. ”
NKJV	Matthew	26	65	( BW ) Then the high priest tore his clothes , saying , “ He has spoken blasphemy ! What further need do we have of witnesses ? Look , now you have heard His ( BX ) blasphemy !
NKJV	Matthew	26	66	What do you think ? ” They answered and said , ( BY ) “ He is deserving of death. ”
NKJV	Matthew	26	67	( BZ ) Then they spat in His face and beat Him ; and ( CA ) others struck Him with [ n ] the palms of their hands ,

NKJV	Matthew	26	71	And when he had gone out to the gateway , another girl saw him and said to those who were there , “ This fellow also was with Jesus of Nazareth. ”
NKJV	Matthew	26	72	But again he denied with an oath , “ I do not know the Man ! ”
NKJV	Matthew	26	73	And a little later those who stood by came up and said to Peter , “ Surely you also are one of them , for your ( CE ) speech betrays you. ”
NKJV	Matthew	26	74	Then ( CF ) he began to [ o ] curse and [ p ] swear , saying , “ I do not know the Man ! ” Immediately a rooster crowed .

NKJV	Matthew	27	3	( E ) Then Judas , His betrayer , seeing that He had been condemned , was remorseful and brought back the thirty ( F ) pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders ,
NKJV	Matthew	27	4	saying , “ I have sinned by betraying innocent blood. ” And they said , “ What is that to us ? You see to it ! ”
NKJV	Matthew	27	5	Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and ( G ) departed , and went and hanged himself .
NKJV	Matthew	27	6	But the chief priests took the silver pieces and said , “ It is not lawful to put them into the treasury , because they are the price of blood. ”
NKJV	Matthew	27	7	And they consulted together and bought with them the potter ’ s field , to bury strangers in .
NKJV	Matthew	27	8	Therefore that field has been called ( H ) the Field of Blood to this day .

NKJV	Matthew	27	16	And at that time they had a notorious prisoner called [ b ] Barabbas .
NKJV	Matthew	27	17	Therefore , when they had gathered together , Pilate said to them , “ Whom do you want me to release to you ? Barabbas , or Jesus who is called Christ ? ”
NKJV	Matthew	27	18	For he knew that they had handed Him over because of ( R ) envy .
NKJV	Matthew	27	19	While he was sitting on the judgment seat , his wife sent to him , saying , “ Have nothing to do with that just Man , for I have suffered many things today in a dream because of Him. ”

NKJV	Matthew	27	21	The governor answered and said to them , “ Which of the two do you want me to release to you ? ” They said , ( T ) “ Barabbas ! ”
NKJV	Matthew	27	22	Pilate said to them , “ What then shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ ? ” They all said to him , “ Let Him be crucified ! ”
NKJV	Matthew	27	23	Then the governor said , ( U ) “ Why , what evil has He done ? ” But they cried out all the more , saying , “ Let Him be crucified ! ”
NKJV	Matthew	27	24	When Pilate saw that he could not prevail at all , but rather that a [ c ] tumult was rising , he ( V ) took water and washed his hands before the multitude , saying , “ I am innocent of the blood of this [ d ] just Person . You see to it. ”
NKJV	Matthew	27	25	And all the people answered and said , ( W ) “ His blood be on us and on our children. ”
NKJV	Matthew	27	26	Then he released Barabbas to them ; and when ( X ) he had [ e ] scourged Jesus , he delivered Him to be crucified . The Soldiers Mock Jesus ( Y )

NKJV	Matthew	27	37	And they ( AN ) put up over His head the accusation written against Him : THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS .
NKJV	Matthew	27	38	( AO ) Then two robbers were crucified with Him , one on the right and another on the left .
NKJV	Matthew	27	39	And ( AP ) those who passed by blasphemed Him , wagging their heads
NKJV	Matthew	27	40	and saying , ( AQ ) “ You who destroy the temple and build it in three days , save Yourself ! ( AR ) If You are the Son of God , come down from the cross. ”
NKJV	Matthew	27	41	Likewise the chief priests also , mocking with the [ k ] scribes and elders , said ,

NKJV	Matthew	27	63	saying , “ Sir , we remember , while He was still alive , how that deceiver said , ( BK ) ‘ After three days I will rise. ’
NKJV	Matthew	27	64	Therefore command that the tomb be made secure until the third day , lest His disciples come [ p ] by night and steal Him away , and say to the people , ‘ He has risen from the dead. ’ So the last deception will be worse than the first. ”
NKJV	Matthew	27	65	Pilate said to them , “ You have a guard ; go your way , make it as secure as you know how. ”

NKJV	Mark	2	2	[ a ] Immediately many gathered together , so that there was no longer room to receive them , not even near the door . And He preached the word to them .
NKJV	Mark	2	3	Then they came to Him , bringing a ( C ) paralytic who was carried by four men .
NKJV	Mark	2	4	And when they could not come near Him because of the crowd , they uncovered the roof where He was . So when they had broken through , they let down the bed on which the paralytic was lying .
NKJV	Mark	2	5	When Jesus saw their faith , He said to the paralytic , “ Son , your sins are forgiven you. ”
NKJV	Mark	2	6	And some of the scribes were sitting there and reasoning in their hearts ,
NKJV	Mark	2	7	“ Why does this Man speak blasphemies like this ? ( D ) Who can forgive sins but God alone ? ”
NKJV	Mark	2	8	But immediately , when Jesus perceived in His spirit that they reasoned thus within themselves , He said to them , “ Why do you reason about these things in your hearts ?
NKJV	Mark	2	9	( E ) Which is easier , to say to the paralytic , ‘ Your sins are forgiven you , ’ or to say , ‘ Arise , take up your bed and walk ’ ?
NKJV	Mark	2	10	But that you may know that the Son of Man has [ b ] power on earth to forgive sins ” —He said to the paralytic ,
NKJV	Mark	2	11	“ I say to you , arise , take up your bed , and go to your house. ”

NKJV	Mark	2	16	And when the scribes [ c ] and Pharisees saw Him eating with the tax collectors and sinners , they said to His disciples , “ How is it that He eats and drinks with tax collectors and sinners ? ”
NKJV	Mark	2	17	When Jesus heard it , He said to them , ( M ) “ Those who are well have no need of a physician , but those who are sick . I did not come to call the righteous , but sinners , [ d ] to repentance. ” Jesus Is Questioned About Fasting ( N )
NKJV	Mark	2	18	( O ) The disciples of John and of the Pharisees were fasting . Then they came and said to Him , “ Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast , but Your disciples do not fast ? ”
NKJV	Mark	2	19	And Jesus said to them , “ Can the [ e ] friends of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them ? As long as they have the bridegroom with them they can not fast .

NKJV	Mark	2	25	But He said to them , “ Have you never read ( U ) what David did when he was in need and hungry , he and those with him :

NKJV	Mark	2	27	And He said to them , “ The Sabbath was made for man , and not man for the ( W ) Sabbath .

NKJV	Mark	3	4	Then He said to them , “ Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil , to save life or to kill ? ” But they kept silent .
NKJV	Mark	3	5	And when He had looked around at them with anger , being grieved by the ( E ) hardness of their hearts , He said to the man , “ Stretch out your hand. ” And he stretched it out , and his hand was restored [ c ] as whole as the other .

NKJV	Mark	3	8	and Jerusalem and Idumea and beyond the Jordan ; and those from Tyre and Sidon , a great multitude , when they heard how ( J ) many things He was doing , came to Him .
NKJV	Mark	3	9	So He told His disciples that a small boat should be kept ready for Him because of the multitude , lest they should crush Him .
NKJV	Mark	3	10	For He healed ( K ) many , so that as many as had afflictions pressed about Him to ( L ) touch Him .
NKJV	Mark	3	11	( M ) And the unclean spirits , whenever they saw Him , fell down before Him and cried out , saying , ( N ) “ You are the Son of God. ”
NKJV	Mark	3	12	But ( O ) He sternly warned them that they should not make Him known . The Twelve Apostles ( P )
NKJV	Mark	3	13	( Q ) And He went up on the mountain and called to Him those He Himself wanted . And they came to Him .

NKJV	Mark	3	20	Then the multitude came together again , ( T ) so that they could not so much as eat bread .
NKJV	Mark	3	21	But when His ( U ) own people heard about this , they went out to lay hold of Him , ( V ) for they said , “ He is out of His mind. ”
NKJV	Mark	3	22	And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said , ( W ) “ He has Beelzebub , ” and , “ By the ( X ) ruler of the demons He casts out demons. ”
NKJV	Mark	3	23	( Y ) So He called them to Himself and said to them in parables : “ How can Satan cast out Satan ?
NKJV	Mark	3	24	If a kingdom is divided against itself , that kingdom can not stand .
NKJV	Mark	3	25	And if a house is divided against itself , that house can not stand .

NKJV	Mark	4	4	And it happened , as he sowed , that some seed fell by the wayside ; and the birds [ a ] of the air came and devoured it .
NKJV	Mark	4	2	Then He taught them many things by parables , ( C ) and said to them in His teaching :
NKJV	Mark	4	3	“ Listen ! Behold , a sower went out to sow .
NKJV	Mark	4	5	Some fell on stony ground , where it did not have much earth ; and immediately it sprang up because it had no depth of earth .
NKJV	Mark	4	6	But when the sun was up it was scorched , and because it had no root it withered away .
NKJV	Mark	4	7	And some seed fell among thorns ; and the thorns grew up and choked it , and it yielded no [ b ] crop .
NKJV	Mark	4	8	But other seed fell on good ground and yielded a crop that sprang up , increased and produced : some thirtyfold , some sixty , and some a hundred. ”
NKJV	Mark	4	9	And He said [ c ] to them , “ He who has ears to hear , let him hear ! ” The Purpose of Parables ( D )
NKJV	Mark	4	10	( E ) But when He was alone , those around Him with the twelve asked Him about the parable .
NKJV	Mark	4	11	And He said to them , “ To you it has been given to ( F ) know the [ d ] mystery of the kingdom of God ; but to ( G ) those who are outside , all things come in parables ,
NKJV	Mark	4	12	so that ( H ) ‘ Seeing they may see and not perceive , And hearing they may hear and not understand ; Lest they should turn , And their sins be forgiven them. ’ ” The Parable of the Sower Explained ( I )
NKJV	Mark	4	13	And He said to them , “ Do you not understand this parable ? How then will you understand all the parables ?
NKJV	Mark	4	14	( J ) The sower sows the word .
NKJV	Mark	4	15	And these are the ones by the wayside where the word is sown . When they hear , Satan comes immediately and takes away the word that was sown in their hearts .
NKJV	Mark	4	16	These likewise are the ones sown on stony ground who , when they hear the word , immediately receive it with gladness ;
NKJV	Mark	4	17	and they have no root in themselves , and so endure only for a time . Afterward , when tribulation or persecution arises for the word ’ s sake , immediately they stumble .
NKJV	Mark	4	18	Now these are the ones sown among thorns ; they are the ones who hear the word ,
NKJV	Mark	4	19	and the ( K ) cares of this world , ( L ) the deceitfulness of riches , and the desires for other things entering in choke the word , and it becomes unfruitful .
NKJV	Mark	4	20	But these are the ones sown on good ground , those who hear the word , [ e ] accept it , and bear ( M ) fruit : some thirtyfold , some sixty , and some a hundred. ” Light Under a Basket ( N )
NKJV	Mark	4	21	( O ) Also He said to them , “ Is a lamp brought to be put under a basket or under a bed ? Is it not to be set on a lampstand ?
NKJV	Mark	4	22	( P ) For there is nothing hidden which will not be revealed , nor has anything been kept secret but that it should come to light .
NKJV	Mark	4	23	( Q ) If anyone has ears to hear , let him hear. ”
NKJV	Mark	4	24	Then He said to them , “ Take heed what you hear . ( R ) With the same measure you use , it will be measured to you ; and to you who hear , more will be given .
NKJV	Mark	4	25	( S ) For whoever has , to him more will be given ; but whoever does not have , even what he has will be taken away from him. ” The Parable of the Growing Seed
NKJV	Mark	4	26	And He said , ( T ) “ The kingdom of God is as if a man should [ f ] scatter seed on the ground ,
NKJV	Mark	4	27	and should sleep by night and rise by day , and the seed should sprout and ( U ) grow , he himself does not know how .
NKJV	Mark	4	28	For the earth ( V ) yields crops by itself : first the blade , then the head , after that the full grain in the head .
NKJV	Mark	4	29	But when the grain ripens , immediately ( W ) he puts in the sickle , because the harvest has come. ” The Parable of the Mustard Seed ( X )
NKJV	Mark	4	30	Then He said , ( Y ) “ To what shall we liken the kingdom of God ? Or with what parable shall we picture it ?
NKJV	Mark	4	31	It is like a mustard seed which , when it is sown on the ground , is smaller than all the seeds on earth ;
NKJV	Mark	4	32	but when it is sown , it grows up and becomes greater than all herbs , and shoots out large branches , so that the birds of the air may nest under its shade. ” Jesus ’ Use of Parables
NKJV	Mark	4	33	( Z ) And with many such parables He spoke the word to them as they were able to hear it .
NKJV	Mark	4	34	But without a parable He did not speak to them . And when they were alone , ( AA ) He explained all things to His disciples . Wind and Wave Obey Jesus ( AB )
NKJV	Mark	4	35	( AC ) On the same day , when evening had come , He said to them , “ Let us cross over to the other side. ”
NKJV	Mark	4	36	Now when they had left the multitude , they took Him along in the boat as He was . And other little boats were also with Him .
NKJV	Mark	4	37	And a great windstorm arose , and the waves beat into the boat , so that it was already filling .
NKJV	Mark	4	38	But He was in the stern , asleep on a pillow . And they awoke Him and said to Him , ( AD ) “ Teacher , ( AE ) do You not care that we are perishing ? ”
NKJV	Mark	4	39	Then He arose and ( AF ) rebuked the wind , and said to the sea , ( AG ) “ Peace , [ g ] be still ! ” And the wind ceased and there was a great calm .
NKJV	Mark	4	40	But He said to them , “ Why are you so fearful ? ( AH ) How [ h ] is it that you have no faith ? ”
NKJV	Mark	4	41	And they feared exceedingly , and said to one another , “ Who can this be , that even the wind and the sea obey Him ! ” Scripture taken from the New King James Version® . Copyright ©

NKJV	Mark	5	5	And always , night and day , he was in the mountains and in the tombs , crying out and cutting himself with stones .
NKJV	Mark	5	2	And when He had come out of the boat , immediately there met Him out of the tombs a man with an ( C ) unclean spirit ,
NKJV	Mark	5	3	who had his dwelling among the tombs ; and no one could bind [ b ] him , not even with chains ,
NKJV	Mark	5	4	because he had often been bound with shackles and chains . And the chains had been pulled apart by him , and the shackles broken in pieces ; neither could anyone tame him .
NKJV	Mark	5	6	When he saw Jesus from afar , he ran and worshiped Him .
NKJV	Mark	5	7	And he cried out with a loud voice and said , “ What have I to do with You , Jesus , Son of the Most High God ? I ( D ) implore [ c ] You by God that You do not torment me. ”
NKJV	Mark	5	8	For He said to him , ( E ) “ Come out of the man , unclean spirit ! ”
NKJV	Mark	5	9	Then He asked him , “ What is your name ? ” And he answered , saying , “ My name is Legion ; for we are many. ”
NKJV	Mark	5	10	Also he begged Him earnestly that He would not send them out of the country .
NKJV	Mark	5	11	Now a large herd of ( F ) swine was feeding there near the mountains .
NKJV	Mark	5	12	So all the demons begged Him , saying , “ Send us to the swine , that we may enter them. ”
NKJV	Mark	5	13	And [ d ] at once Jesus gave them permission . Then the unclean spirits went out and entered the swine ( there were about two thousand ) ; and the herd ran violently down the steep place into the sea , and drowned in the sea .
NKJV	Mark	5	14	So those who fed the swine fled , and they told it in the city and in the country . And they went out to see what it was that had happened .
NKJV	Mark	5	15	Then they came to Jesus , and saw the one who had been ( G ) demon-possessed and had the legion , ( H ) sitting and ( I ) clothed and in his right mind . And they were afraid .
NKJV	Mark	5	16	And those who saw it told them how it happened to him who had been demon-possessed , and about the swine .
NKJV	Mark	5	17	Then ( J ) they began to plead with Him to depart from their region .
NKJV	Mark	5	18	And when He got into the boat , ( K ) he who had been demon-possessed begged Him that he might be with Him .
NKJV	Mark	5	19	However , Jesus did not permit him , but said to him , “ Go home to your friends , and tell them what great things the Lord has done for you , and how He has had compassion on you. ”
NKJV	Mark	5	20	And he departed and began to ( L ) proclaim in [ e ] Decapolis all that Jesus had done for him ; and all ( M ) marveled . A Girl Restored to Life and a Woman Healed ( N )
NKJV	Mark	5	21	( O ) Now when Jesus had crossed over again by boat to the other side , a great multitude gathered to Him ; and He was by the sea .

NKJV	Mark	5	23	and begged Him earnestly , saying , “ My little daughter lies at the point of death . Come and ( Q ) lay Your hands on her , that she may be healed , and she will live. ”
NKJV	Mark	5	24	So Jesus went with him , and a great multitude followed Him and thronged Him .
NKJV	Mark	5	25	Now a certain woman ( R ) had a flow of blood for twelve years ,
NKJV	Mark	5	26	and had suffered many things from many physicians . She had spent all that she had and was no better , but rather grew worse .
NKJV	Mark	5	27	When she heard about Jesus , she came behind Him in the crowd and ( S ) touched His garment .
NKJV	Mark	5	28	For she said , “ If only I may touch His clothes , I shall be made well. ”
NKJV	Mark	5	29	Immediately the fountain of her blood was dried up , and she felt in her body that she was healed of the [ f ] affliction .
NKJV	Mark	5	30	And Jesus , immediately knowing in Himself that ( T ) power had gone out of Him , turned around in the crowd and said , “ Who touched My clothes ? ”
NKJV	Mark	5	31	But His disciples said to Him , “ You see the multitude thronging You , and You say , ‘ Who touched Me ? ’ ”
NKJV	Mark	5	32	And He looked around to see her who had done this thing .
NKJV	Mark	5	33	But the woman , ( U ) fearing and trembling , knowing what had happened to her , came and fell down before Him and told Him the whole truth .
NKJV	Mark	5	34	And He said to her , “ Daughter , ( V ) your faith has made you well . ( W ) Go in peace , and be healed of your affliction. ”
NKJV	Mark	5	35	( X ) While He was still speaking , some came from the ruler of the synagogue ’ s house who said , “ Your daughter is dead . Why trouble the Teacher any further ? ”
NKJV	Mark	5	36	As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken , He said to the ruler of the synagogue , “ Do not be afraid ; only ( Y ) believe. ”
NKJV	Mark	5	37	And He permitted no one to follow Him except Peter , James , and John the brother of James .
NKJV	Mark	5	38	Then He came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue , and saw [ g ] a tumult and those who ( Z ) wept and wailed loudly .
NKJV	Mark	5	39	When He came in , He said to them , “ Why make this commotion and weep ? The child is not dead , but ( AA ) sleeping. ”
NKJV	Mark	5	40	And they ridiculed Him . ( AB ) But when He had put them all outside , He took the father and the mother of the child , and those who were with Him , and entered where the child was lying .
NKJV	Mark	5	41	Then He took the child by the hand , and said to her , “ Talitha , cumi , ” which is translated , “ Little girl , I say to you , arise. ”
NKJV	Mark	5	42	Immediately the girl arose and walked , for she was twelve years of age . And they were ( AC ) overcome with great amazement .
NKJV	Mark	5	43	But ( AD ) He commanded them strictly that no one should know it , and said that something should be given her to eat . Scripture taken from the New King James Version® . Copyright ©

NKJV	Mark	6	6	And ( I ) He marveled because of their unbelief . ( J ) Then He went about the villages in a circuit , teaching . Sending Out the Twelve ( K )
NKJV	Mark	6	2	And when the Sabbath had come , He began to teach in the synagogue . And many hearing Him were ( C ) astonished , saying , ( D ) “ Where did this Man get these things ? And what wisdom is this which is given to Him , that such mighty works are performed by His hands !
NKJV	Mark	6	3	Is this not the carpenter , the Son of Mary , and ( E ) brother of James , Joses , Judas , and Simon ? And are not His sisters here with us ? ” So they ( F ) were offended at Him .
NKJV	Mark	6	4	But Jesus said to them , ( G ) “ A prophet is not without honor except in his own country , among his own relatives , and in his own house. ”
NKJV	Mark	6	5	( H ) Now He could do no mighty work there , except that He laid His hands on a few sick people and healed them .
NKJV	Mark	6	7	( L ) And He called the twelve to Himself , and began to send them out ( M ) two by two , and gave them power over unclean spirits .
NKJV	Mark	6	8	He commanded them to take nothing for the journey except a staff—no bag , no bread , no copper in their money belts—
NKJV	Mark	6	9	but ( N ) to wear sandals , and not to put on two tunics .

NKJV	Mark	6	14	( T ) Now King Herod heard of Him , for His name had become well known . And he said , “ John the Baptist is risen from the dead , and therefore ( U ) these powers are at work in him. ”
NKJV	Mark	6	15	( V ) Others said , “ It is Elijah. ” And others said , “ It is [ c ] the Prophet , ( W ) or like one of the prophets. ”
NKJV	Mark	6	16	( X ) But when Herod heard , he said , “ This is John , whom I beheaded ; he has been raised from the dead ! ”
NKJV	Mark	6	17	For Herod himself had sent and laid hold of John , and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias , his brother Philip ’ s wife ; for he had married her .
NKJV	Mark	6	18	Because John had said to Herod , ( Y ) “ It is not lawful for you to have your brother ’ s wife. ”
NKJV	Mark	6	19	Therefore Herodias [ d ] held it against him and wanted to kill him , but she could not ;
NKJV	Mark	6	20	for Herod ( Z ) feared John , knowing that he was a just and holy man , and he protected him . And when he heard him , he [ e ] did many things , and heard him gladly .
NKJV	Mark	6	21	( AA ) Then an opportune day came when Herod ( AB ) on his birthday gave a feast for his nobles , the high officers , and the chief men of Galilee .
NKJV	Mark	6	22	And when Herodias ’ daughter herself came in and danced , and pleased Herod and those who sat with him , the king said to the girl , “ Ask me whatever you want , and I will give it to you. ”
NKJV	Mark	6	23	He also swore to her , ( AC ) “ Whatever you ask me , I will give you , up to half my kingdom. ”
NKJV	Mark	6	24	So she went out and said to her mother , “ What shall I ask ? ” And she said , “ The head of John the Baptist ! ”
NKJV	Mark	6	25	Immediately she came in with haste to the king and asked , saying , “ I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter. ”
NKJV	Mark	6	26	( AD ) And the king was exceedingly sorry ; yet , because of the oaths and because of those who sat with him , he did not want to refuse her .
NKJV	Mark	6	27	Immediately the king sent an executioner and commanded his head to be brought . And he went and beheaded him in prison ,
NKJV	Mark	6	28	brought his head on a platter , and gave it to the girl ; and the girl gave it to her mother .
NKJV	Mark	6	29	When his disciples heard of it , they came and ( AE ) took away his corpse and laid it in a tomb . Feeding the Five Thousand ( AF )
NKJV	Mark	6	30	( AG ) Then the apostles gathered to Jesus and told Him all things , both what they had done and what they had taught .
NKJV	Mark	6	31	( AH ) And He said to them , “ Come aside by yourselves to a deserted place and rest a while. ” For ( AI ) there were many coming and going , and they did not even have time to eat .
NKJV	Mark	6	32	( AJ ) So they departed to a deserted place in the boat by themselves .
NKJV	Mark	6	33	But [ f ] the multitudes saw them departing , and many ( AK ) knew Him and ran there on foot from all the cities . They arrived before them and came together to Him .
NKJV	Mark	6	34	( AL ) And Jesus , when He came out , saw a great multitude and was moved with compassion for them , because they were like ( AM ) sheep not having a shepherd . So ( AN ) He began to teach them many things .
NKJV	Mark	6	35	( AO ) When the day was now far spent , His disciples came to Him and said , “ This is a deserted place , and already the hour is late .

NKJV	Mark	6	38	But He said to them , “ How many loaves do you have ? Go and see. ” And when they found out they said , ( AQ ) “ Five , and two fish. ”
NKJV	Mark	6	39	Then He ( AR ) commanded them to make them all sit down in groups on the green grass .
NKJV	Mark	6	40	So they sat down in ranks , in hundreds and in fifties .
NKJV	Mark	6	41	And when He had taken the five loaves and the two fish , He ( AS ) looked up to heaven , ( AT ) blessed and broke the loaves , and gave them to His disciples to set before them ; and the two fish He divided among them all .
NKJV	Mark	6	42	So they all ate and were filled .

NKJV	Mark	6	45	( AV ) Immediately He [ i ] made His disciples get into the boat and go before Him to the other side , to Bethsaida , while He sent the multitude away .
NKJV	Mark	6	46	And when He had sent them away , He ( AW ) departed to the mountain to pray .
NKJV	Mark	6	47	Now when evening came , the boat was in the middle of the sea ; and He was alone on the land .
NKJV	Mark	6	48	Then He saw them straining at rowing , for the wind was against them . Now about the fourth watch of the night He came to them , walking on the sea , and ( AX ) would have passed them by .
NKJV	Mark	6	49	And when they saw Him walking on the sea , they supposed it was a ( AY ) ghost , and cried out ;
NKJV	Mark	6	50	for they all saw Him and were troubled . But immediately He talked with them and said to them , ( AZ ) “ Be [ j ] of good cheer ! It is I ; do not be ( BA ) afraid. ”
NKJV	Mark	6	51	Then He went up into the boat to them , and the wind ( BB ) ceased . And they were greatly ( BC ) amazed in themselves beyond measure , and marveled .
NKJV	Mark	6	52	For ( BD ) they had not understood about the loaves , because their ( BE ) heart was hardened . Many Touch Him and Are Made Well ( BF )
NKJV	Mark	6	53	( BG ) When they had crossed over , they came to the land of Gennesaret and anchored there .

NKJV	Mark	7	3	For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they wash their hands [ c ] in a special way , holding the ( D ) tradition of the elders .
NKJV	Mark	7	4	When they come from the marketplace , they do not eat unless they wash. And there are many other things which they have received and hold , like the washing of cups , pitchers , copper vessels , and couches .
NKJV	Mark	7	5	( E ) Then the Pharisees and scribes asked Him , “ Why do Your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders , but eat bread with unwashed hands ? ”
NKJV	Mark	7	6	He answered and said to them , “ Well did Isaiah prophesy of you ( F ) hypocrites , as it is written : ( G ) ‘ This people honors Me with their lips , But their heart is far from Me .

NKJV	Mark	7	9	He said to them , “ All too well ( H ) you [ e ] reject the commandment of God , that you may keep your tradition .

NKJV	Mark	9	35	And He sat down , called the twelve , and said to them , ( AG ) “ If anyone desires to be first , he shall be last of all and servant of all. ”
NKJV	Mark	9	36	Then ( AH ) He took a little child and set him in the midst of them . And when He had taken him in His arms , He said to them ,
NKJV	Mark	9	37	“ Whoever receives one of these little children in My name receives Me ; and ( AI ) whoever receives Me , receives not Me but Him who sent Me. ” Jesus Forbids Sectarianism ( AJ )
NKJV	Mark	9	38	( AK ) Now John answered Him , saying , “ Teacher , we saw someone who does not follow us casting out demons in Your name , and we forbade him because he does not follow us. ”
NKJV	Mark	9	39	But Jesus said , “ Do not forbid him , ( AL ) for no one who works a miracle in My name can soon afterward speak evil of Me .
NKJV	Mark	9	40	For ( AM ) he who is not against [ g ] us is on [ h ] our side .

NKJV	Mark	10	10	In the house His disciples also asked Him again about the same matter .
NKJV	Mark	10	2	( C ) The Pharisees came and asked Him , “ Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife ? ” testing Him .
NKJV	Mark	10	3	And He answered and said to them , “ What did Moses command you ? ”
NKJV	Mark	10	4	They said , ( D ) “ Moses permitted a man to write a certificate of divorce , and to dismiss her. ”
NKJV	Mark	10	5	And Jesus answered and said to them , “ Because of the hardness of your heart he wrote you this [ a ] precept .
NKJV	Mark	10	6	But from the beginning of the creation , God ( E ) ‘ made them male and female. ’
NKJV	Mark	10	7	( F ) ‘ For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife ,
NKJV	Mark	10	8	and the two shall become one flesh ’ ; so then they are no longer two , but one flesh .
NKJV	Mark	10	9	Therefore what God has joined together , let not man separate. ”
NKJV	Mark	10	11	So He said to them , ( G ) “ Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her .
NKJV	Mark	10	12	And if a woman divorces her husband and marries another , she commits adultery. ” Jesus Blesses Little Children ( H )
NKJV	Mark	10	13	( I ) Then they brought little children to Him , that He might touch them ; but the disciples rebuked those who brought them .
NKJV	Mark	10	14	But when Jesus saw it , He was greatly displeased and said to them , “ Let the little children come to Me , and do not forbid them ; for ( J ) of such is the kingdom of God .
NKJV	Mark	10	15	Assuredly , I say to you , ( K ) whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will ( L ) by no means enter it. ”
NKJV	Mark	10	16	And He took them up in His arms , laid His hands on them , and blessed them . Jesus Counsels the Rich Young Ruler ( M )
NKJV	Mark	10	17	( N ) Now as He was going out on the road , one came running , knelt before Him , and asked Him , “ Good Teacher , what shall I ( O ) do that I may inherit eternal life ? ”
NKJV	Mark	10	18	So Jesus said to him , “ Why do you call Me good ? No one is good but One , that is , ( P ) God .
NKJV	Mark	10	19	You know the commandments : ( Q ) ‘ Do not commit adultery , ’ ‘ Do not murder , ’ ‘ Do not steal , ’ ‘ Do not bear false witness , ’ ‘ Do not defraud , ’ ‘ Honor your father and your mother. ’ ”
NKJV	Mark	10	20	And he answered and said to Him , “ Teacher , all these things I have ( R ) kept from my youth. ”
NKJV	Mark	10	21	Then Jesus , looking at him , loved him , and said to him , “ One thing you lack : Go your way , ( S ) sell whatever you have and give to the poor , and you will have ( T ) treasure in heaven ; and come , ( U ) take up the cross , and follow Me. ”
NKJV	Mark	10	22	But he was sad at this word , and went away sorrowful , for he had great possessions . With God All Things Are Possible ( V )
NKJV	Mark	10	23	( W ) Then Jesus looked around and said to His disciples , “ How hard it is for those who have riches to enter the kingdom of God ! ”
NKJV	Mark	10	24	And the disciples were astonished at His words . But Jesus answered again and said to them , “ Children , how hard it is [ b ] for those ( X ) who trust in riches to enter the kingdom of God !
NKJV	Mark	10	25	It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a ( Y ) rich man to enter the kingdom of God. ”
NKJV	Mark	10	26	And they were greatly astonished , saying among themselves , “ Who then can be saved ? ”
NKJV	Mark	10	27	But Jesus looked at them and said , “ With men it is impossible , but not ( Z ) with God ; for with God all things are possible. ”
NKJV	Mark	10	28	( AA ) Then Peter began to say to Him , “ See , we have left all and followed You. ”
NKJV	Mark	10	29	So Jesus answered and said , “ Assuredly , I say to you , there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or father or mother [ c ] or wife or children or [ d ] lands , for My sake and the gospel ’ s ,
NKJV	Mark	10	30	( AB ) who shall not receive a hundredfold now in this time—houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands , with ( AC ) persecutions—and in the age to come , eternal life .
NKJV	Mark	10	31	( AD ) But many who are first will be last , and the last first. ” Jesus a Third Time Predicts His Death and Resurrection ( AE )
NKJV	Mark	10	32	( AF ) Now they were on the road , going up to Jerusalem , and Jesus was going before them ; and they were amazed . And as they followed they were afraid . ( AG ) Then He took the twelve aside again and began to tell them the things that would happen to Him :
NKJV	Mark	10	33	“ Behold , we are going up to Jerusalem , and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and to the scribes ; and they will condemn Him to death and deliver Him to the Gentiles ;
NKJV	Mark	10	34	and they will mock Him , and [ e ] scourge Him , and spit on Him , and kill Him . And the third day He will rise again. ” Greatness Is Serving ( AH )
NKJV	Mark	10	35	( AI ) Then James and John , the sons of Zebedee , came to Him , saying , “ Teacher , we want You to do for us whatever we ask. ”
NKJV	Mark	10	36	And He said to them , “ What do you want Me to do for you ? ”
NKJV	Mark	10	37	They said to Him , “ Grant us that we may sit , one on Your right hand and the other on Your left , in Your glory. ”
NKJV	Mark	10	38	But Jesus said to them , “ You do not know what you ask . Are you able to drink the ( AJ ) cup that I drink , and be baptized with the ( AK ) baptism that I am baptized with ? ”
NKJV	Mark	10	39	They said to Him , “ We are able. ” So Jesus said to them , ( AL ) “ You will indeed drink the cup that I drink , and with the baptism I am baptized with you will be baptized ;
NKJV	Mark	10	40	but to sit on My right hand and on My left is not Mine to give , but it is for those ( AM ) for whom it is prepared. ”
NKJV	Mark	10	41	( AN ) And when the ten heard it , they began to be greatly displeased with James and John .
NKJV	Mark	10	42	But Jesus called them to Himself and said to them , ( AO ) “ You know that those who are considered rulers over the Gentiles lord it over them , and their great ones exercise authority over them .
NKJV	Mark	10	43	( AP ) Yet it shall not be so among you ; but whoever desires to become great among you shall be your servant .
NKJV	Mark	10	44	And whoever of you desires to be first shall be slave of all .
NKJV	Mark	10	45	For even ( AQ ) the Son of Man did not come to be served , but to serve , and ( AR ) to give His life a ransom for many. ” Jesus Heals Blind Bartimaeus ( AS )
NKJV	Mark	10	46	( AT ) Now they came to Jericho . As He went out of Jericho with His disciples and a great multitude , blind Bartimaeus , the son of Timaeus , sat by the road begging .
NKJV	Mark	10	47	And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth , he began to cry out and say , “ Jesus , ( AU ) Son of David , ( AV ) have mercy on me ! ”
NKJV	Mark	10	48	Then many warned him to be quiet ; but he cried out all the more , “ Son of David , have mercy on me ! ”
NKJV	Mark	10	49	So Jesus stood still and commanded him to be called . Then they called the blind man , saying to him , “ Be of good cheer . Rise , He is calling you. ”
NKJV	Mark	10	50	And throwing aside his garment , he rose and came to Jesus .
NKJV	Mark	10	51	So Jesus answered and said to him , “ What do you want Me to do for you ? ” The blind man said to Him , [ f ] “ Rabboni , that I may receive my sight. ”
NKJV	Mark	10	52	Then Jesus said to him , “ Go your way ; ( AW ) your faith has [ g ] made you well. ” And immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus on the road .

NKJV	Mark	11	11	( F ) And Jesus went into Jerusalem and into the temple . So when He had looked around at all things , as the hour was already late , He went out to Bethany with the twelve . The Fig Tree Withered ( G )
NKJV	Mark	11	2	and He said to them , “ Go into the village opposite you ; and as soon as you have entered it you will find a colt tied , on which no one has sat . Loose it and bring it .
NKJV	Mark	11	3	And if anyone says to you , ‘ Why are you doing this ? ’ say , ‘ The Lord has need of it , ’ and immediately he will send it here. ”
NKJV	Mark	11	4	So they went their way , and found [ b ] the colt tied by the door outside on the street , and they loosed it .
NKJV	Mark	11	5	But some of those who stood there said to them , “ What are you doing , loosing the colt ? ”
NKJV	Mark	11	6	And they spoke to them just as Jesus had commanded . So they let them go .
NKJV	Mark	11	7	Then they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their clothes on it , and He sat on it .
NKJV	Mark	11	8	( C ) And many spread their clothes on the road , and others cut down leafy branches from the trees and spread them on the road .
NKJV	Mark	11	9	Then those who went before and those who followed cried out , saying : “ Hosanna ! ( D ) ‘ Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord ! ’
NKJV	Mark	11	10	Blessed is the kingdom of our father David That comes [ c ] in the name of the Lord ! ( E ) Hosanna in the highest ! ”
NKJV	Mark	11	12	( H ) Now the next day , when they had come out from Bethany , He was hungry .
NKJV	Mark	11	13	( I ) And seeing from afar a fig tree having leaves , He went to see if perhaps He would find something on it . When He came to it , He found nothing but leaves , for it was not the season for figs .
NKJV	Mark	11	14	In response Jesus said to it , “ Let no one eat fruit from you ever again. ” And His disciples heard it . Jesus Cleanses the Temple ( J )
NKJV	Mark	11	15	( K ) So they came to Jerusalem . Then Jesus went into the temple and began to drive out those who bought and sold in the temple , and overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold ( L ) doves .
NKJV	Mark	11	16	And He would not allow anyone to carry wares through the temple .
NKJV	Mark	11	17	Then He taught , saying to them , “ Is it not written , ( M ) ‘ My house shall be called a house of prayer for all nations ’ ? But you have made it a ( N ) ‘ den of thieves. ’ ”
NKJV	Mark	11	18	And ( O ) the scribes and chief priests heard it and sought how they might destroy Him ; for they feared Him , because ( P ) all the people were astonished at His teaching .
NKJV	Mark	11	19	When evening had come , He went out of the city . The Lesson of the Withered Fig Tree ( Q )
NKJV	Mark	11	20	( R ) Now in the morning , as they passed by , they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots .
NKJV	Mark	11	21	And Peter , remembering , said to Him , “ Rabbi , look ! The fig tree which You cursed has withered away. ”
NKJV	Mark	11	22	So Jesus answered and said to them , “ Have faith in God .
NKJV	Mark	11	23	For ( S ) assuredly , I say to you , whoever says to this mountain , ‘ Be removed and be cast into the sea , ’ and does not doubt in his heart , but believes that those things he says will be done , he will have whatever he says .
NKJV	Mark	11	24	Therefore I say to you , ( T ) whatever things you ask when you pray , believe that you receive them , and you will have them . Forgiveness and Prayer ( U )
NKJV	Mark	11	25	“ And whenever you stand praying , ( V ) if you have anything against anyone , forgive him , that your Father in heaven may also forgive you your trespasses .

NKJV	Mark	11	27	Then they came again to Jerusalem . ( Y ) And as He was walking in the temple , the chief priests , the scribes , and the elders came to Him .
NKJV	Mark	11	28	And they said to Him , “ By what ( Z ) authority are You doing these things ? And who gave You this authority to do these things ? ”
NKJV	Mark	11	29	But Jesus answered and said to them , “ I also will ask you one question ; then answer Me , and I will tell you by what authority I do these things :
NKJV	Mark	11	30	The ( AA ) baptism of John—was it from heaven or from men ? Answer Me. ”
NKJV	Mark	11	31	And they reasoned among themselves , saying , “ If we say , ‘ From heaven , ’ He will say , ‘ Why then did you not believe him ? ’
NKJV	Mark	11	32	But if we say , ‘ From men ’ ” —they feared the people , for ( AB ) all counted John to have been a prophet indeed .
NKJV	Mark	11	33	So they answered and said to Jesus , “ We do not know. ” And Jesus answered and said to them , “ Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things. ” Footnotes - Mark 11:1 M Bethsphage - Mark 11:4 NU , M a - Mark 11:10 NU omits in the name of the Lord - Mark 11:26 NU omits v.

NKJV	Mark	12	2	Now at vintage-time he sent a servant to the vinedressers , that he might receive some of the fruit of the vineyard from the vinedressers .
NKJV	Mark	12	3	And they took him and beat him and sent him away empty-handed .
NKJV	Mark	12	4	Again he sent them another servant , [ b ] and at him they threw stones , wounded him in the head , and sent him away shamefully treated .
NKJV	Mark	12	5	And again he sent another , and him they killed ; and many others , ( C ) beating some and killing some .
NKJV	Mark	12	6	Therefore still having one son , his beloved , he also sent him to them last , saying , ‘ They will respect my son. ’
NKJV	Mark	12	7	But those [ c ] vinedressers said among themselves , ‘ This is the heir . Come , let us kill him , and the inheritance will be ours. ’
NKJV	Mark	12	8	So they took him and ( D ) killed him and cast him out of the vineyard .
NKJV	Mark	12	9	“ Therefore what will the owner of the vineyard do ? He will come and destroy the vinedressers , and give the vineyard to others .
NKJV	Mark	12	10	Have you not even read this Scripture : ( E ) ‘ The stone which the builders rejected Has become the chief cornerstone .
NKJV	Mark	12	11	This was the Lord ’ s doing , And it is marvelous in our eyes ’ ? ”
NKJV	Mark	12	13	( H ) Then they sent to Him some of the Pharisees and the Herodians , to catch Him in His words .
NKJV	Mark	12	14	When they had come , they said to Him , “ Teacher , we know that You are true , and [ d ] care about no one ; for You do not [ e ] regard the person of men , but teach the ( I ) way of God in truth . Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar , or not ?
NKJV	Mark	12	15	Shall we pay , or shall we not pay ? ” But He , knowing their ( J ) hypocrisy , said to them , “ Why do you test Me ? Bring Me a denarius that I may see it. ”
NKJV	Mark	12	16	So they brought it . And He said to them , “ Whose image and inscription is this ? ” They said to Him , “ Caesar ’ s. ”
NKJV	Mark	12	17	And Jesus answered and said to them , [ f ] “ Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar ’ s , and to ( K ) God the things that are God ’ s. ” And they marveled at Him . The Sadducees : What About the Resurrection ? ( L )
NKJV	Mark	12	18	( M ) Then some Sadducees , ( N ) who say there is no resurrection , came to Him ; and they asked Him , saying :
NKJV	Mark	12	19	“ Teacher , ( O ) Moses wrote to us that if a man ’ s brother dies , and leaves his wife behind , and leaves no children , his brother should take his wife and raise up offspring for his brother .
NKJV	Mark	12	20	Now there were seven brothers . The first took a wife ; and dying , he left no offspring .
NKJV	Mark	12	21	And the second took her , and he died ; nor did he leave any offspring . And the third likewise .
NKJV	Mark	12	22	So the seven had her and left no offspring . Last of all the woman died also .
NKJV	Mark	12	23	Therefore , in the resurrection , when they rise , whose wife will she be ? For all seven had her as wife. ”
NKJV	Mark	12	24	Jesus answered and said to them , “ Are you not therefore [ g ] mistaken , because you do not know the Scriptures nor the power of God ?
NKJV	Mark	12	25	For when they rise from the dead , they neither marry nor are given in marriage , but ( P ) are like angels in heaven .
NKJV	Mark	12	26	But concerning the dead , that they ( Q ) rise , have you not read in the book of Moses , in the burning bush passage , how God spoke to him , saying , ( R ) ‘ I am the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ’ ?
NKJV	Mark	12	27	He is not the God of the dead , but the God of the living . You are therefore greatly [ h ] mistaken. ” The Scribes : Which Is the First Commandment of All ? ( S )
NKJV	Mark	12	28	( T ) Then one of the scribes came , and having heard them reasoning together , [ i ] perceiving that He had answered them well , asked Him , “ Which is the [ j ] first commandment of all ? ”
NKJV	Mark	12	29	Jesus answered him , “ The [ k ] first of all the commandments is : ( U ) ‘ Hear , O Israel , the Lord our God , the Lord is one .

NKJV	Mark	12	31	And the second , like it , is this : ( W ) ‘ You shall love your neighbor as yourself. ’ There is no other commandment greater than ( X ) these. ”
NKJV	Mark	12	32	So the scribe said to Him , “ Well said , Teacher . You have spoken the truth , for there is one God , ( Y ) and there is no other but He .
NKJV	Mark	12	33	And to love Him with all the heart , with all the understanding , [ m ] with all the soul , and with all the strength , and to love one ’ s neighbor as oneself , ( Z ) is more than all the whole burnt offerings and sacrifices. ”
NKJV	Mark	12	34	Now when Jesus saw that he answered wisely , He said to him , “ You are not far from the kingdom of God. ” ( AA ) But after that no one dared question Him . Jesus : How Can David Call His Descendant Lord ? ( AB )
NKJV	Mark	12	35	( AC ) Then Jesus answered and said , while He taught in the temple , “ How is it that the scribes say that the Christ is the Son of David ?
NKJV	Mark	12	36	For David himself said ( AD ) by the Holy Spirit : ( AE ) ‘ The Lord said to my Lord , “ Sit at My right hand , Till I make Your enemies Your footstool. ” ’
NKJV	Mark	12	37	Therefore David himself calls Him ‘ Lord ’ ; how is He then his ( AF ) Son ? ” And the common people heard Him gladly . Beware of the Scribes ( AG )
NKJV	Mark	12	38	Then ( AH ) He said to them in His teaching , ( AI ) “ Beware of the scribes , who desire to go around in long robes , ( AJ ) love greetings in the marketplaces ,
NKJV	Mark	12	39	the ( AK ) best seats in the synagogues , and the best places at feasts ,

NKJV	Mark	12	41	( AN ) Now Jesus sat opposite the treasury and saw how the people put money ( AO ) into the treasury . And many who were rich put in much .
NKJV	Mark	12	42	Then one poor widow came and threw in two [ o ] mites , which make a [ p ] quadrans .
NKJV	Mark	12	43	So He called His disciples to Himself and said to them , “ Assuredly , I say to you that ( AP ) this poor widow has put in more than all those who have given to the treasury ;

NKJV	Mark	13	2	And Jesus answered and said to him , “ Do you see these great buildings ? ( C ) Not one stone shall be left upon another , that shall not be thrown down. ” The Signs of the Times and the End of the Age ( D )
NKJV	Mark	13	3	Now as He sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple , ( E ) Peter , ( F ) James , ( G ) John , and ( H ) Andrew asked Him privately ,
NKJV	Mark	13	4	( I ) “ Tell us , when will these things be ? And what will be the sign when all these things will be fulfilled ? ”
NKJV	Mark	13	5	And Jesus , answering them , began to say : ( J ) “ Take heed that no one deceives you .
NKJV	Mark	13	6	For many will come in My name , saying , ‘ I am He , ’ and will deceive many .
NKJV	Mark	13	7	But when you hear of wars and rumors of wars , do not be troubled ; for such things must happen , but the end is not yet .
NKJV	Mark	13	8	For nation will rise against nation , and ( K ) kingdom against kingdom . And there will be earthquakes in various places , and there will be famines [ a ] and troubles . ( L ) These are the beginnings of [ b ] sorrows .
NKJV	Mark	13	9	“ But ( M ) watch out for yourselves , for they will deliver you up to councils , and you will be beaten in the synagogues . You will [ c ] be brought before rulers and kings for My sake , for a testimony to them .
NKJV	Mark	13	10	And ( N ) the gospel must first be preached to all the nations .
NKJV	Mark	13	11	( O ) But when they arrest you and deliver you up , do not worry beforehand , [ d ] or premeditate what you will speak . But whatever is given you in that hour , speak that ; for it is not you who speak , ( P ) but the Holy Spirit .
NKJV	Mark	13	12	Now ( Q ) brother will betray brother to death , and a father his child ; and children will rise up against parents and cause them to be put to death .

NKJV	Mark	13	17	( X ) But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days !
NKJV	Mark	13	18	And pray that your flight may not be in winter .
NKJV	Mark	13	19	( Y ) For in those days there will be tribulation , such as has not been since the beginning of the creation which God created until this time , nor ever shall be .
NKJV	Mark	13	20	And unless the Lord had shortened those days , no flesh would be saved ; but for the elect ’ s sake , whom He chose , He shortened the days .
NKJV	Mark	13	21	( Z ) “ Then if anyone says to you , ‘ Look , here is the Christ ! ’ or , ‘ Look , He is there ! ’ do not believe it .

NKJV	Mark	13	28	( AH ) “ Now learn this parable from the fig tree : When its branch has already become tender , and puts forth leaves , you know that summer is near .

NKJV	Mark	14	32	( AB ) Then they came to a place which was named Gethsemane ; and He said to His disciples , “ Sit here while I pray. ”
NKJV	Mark	14	33	And He ( AC ) took Peter , James , and John with Him , and He began to be troubled and deeply distressed .
NKJV	Mark	14	34	Then He said to them , ( AD ) “ My soul is exceedingly sorrowful , even to death . Stay here and watch. ”
NKJV	Mark	14	35	He went a little farther , and fell on the ground , and prayed that if it were possible , the hour might pass from Him .
NKJV	Mark	14	36	And He said , ( AE ) “ Abba , Father , ( AF ) all things are possible for You . Take this cup away from Me ; ( AG ) nevertheless , not what I will , but what You will. ”
NKJV	Mark	14	37	Then He came and found them sleeping , and said to Peter , “ Simon , are you sleeping ? Could you not watch one hour ?
NKJV	Mark	14	38	( AH ) Watch and pray , lest you enter into temptation . ( AI ) The spirit indeed is willing , but the flesh is weak. ”
NKJV	Mark	14	39	Again He went away and prayed , and spoke the same words .
NKJV	Mark	14	40	And when He returned , He found them asleep again , for their eyes were heavy ; and they did not know what to answer Him .
NKJV	Mark	14	41	Then He came the third time and said to them , “ Are you still sleeping and resting ? It is enough ! ( AJ ) The hour has come ; behold , the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners .

NKJV	Mark	14	44	Now His betrayer had given them a signal , saying , “ Whomever I ( AN ) kiss , He is the One ; seize Him and lead Him away safely. ”
NKJV	Mark	14	45	As soon as he had come , immediately he went up to Him and said to Him , “ Rabbi , Rabbi ! ” and kissed Him .
NKJV	Mark	14	46	Then they laid their hands on Him and took Him .
NKJV	Mark	14	47	And one of those who stood by drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest , and cut off his ear .
NKJV	Mark	14	48	( AO ) Then Jesus answered and said to them , “ Have you come out , as against a robber , with swords and clubs to take Me ?

NKJV	Mark	14	54	But ( AW ) Peter followed Him at a distance , right into the courtyard of the high priest . And he sat with the servants and warmed himself at the fire .
NKJV	Mark	14	55	( AX ) Now the chief priests and all the council sought testimony against Jesus to put Him to death , but found none .
NKJV	Mark	14	56	For many bore ( AY ) false witness against Him , but their testimonies [ k ] did not agree .
NKJV	Mark	14	57	Then some rose up and bore false witness against Him , saying ,
NKJV	Mark	14	58	“ We heard Him say , ( AZ ) ‘ I will destroy this temple made with hands , and within three days I will build another made without hands. ’ ”
NKJV	Mark	14	59	But not even then did their testimony agree .
NKJV	Mark	14	60	( BA ) And the high priest stood up in the midst and asked Jesus , saying , “ Do You answer nothing ? What is it these men testify against You ? ”
NKJV	Mark	14	61	But ( BB ) He kept silent and answered nothing . ( BC ) Again the high priest asked Him , saying to Him , “ Are You the Christ , the Son of the Blessed ? ”
NKJV	Mark	14	62	Jesus said , “ I am . ( BD ) And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power , and coming with the clouds of heaven. ”
NKJV	Mark	14	63	Then the high priest tore his clothes and said , “ What further need do we have of witnesses ?
NKJV	Mark	14	64	You have heard the ( BE ) blasphemy ! What do you think ? ” And they all condemned Him to be deserving of ( BF ) death .
NKJV	Mark	14	65	Then some began to ( BG ) spit on Him , and to blindfold Him , and to beat Him , and to say to Him , “ Prophesy ! ” And the officers [ l ] struck Him with the palms of their hands . Peter Denies Jesus , and Weeps ( BH )

NKJV	Mark	15	3	And the chief priests accused Him of many things , but He ( E ) answered nothing .
NKJV	Mark	15	4	( F ) Then Pilate asked Him again , saying , “ Do You answer nothing ? See how many things [ a ] they testify against You ! ”

NKJV	Mark	15	6	Now ( I ) at the feast he was accustomed to releasing one prisoner to them , whomever they requested .
NKJV	Mark	15	7	And there was one named Barabbas , who was chained with his fellow rebels ; they had committed murder in the rebellion .
NKJV	Mark	15	8	Then the multitude , [ b ] crying aloud , began to ask him to do just as he had always done for them .
NKJV	Mark	15	9	But Pilate answered them , saying , “ Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews ? ”
NKJV	Mark	15	10	For he knew that the chief priests had handed Him over because of envy .
NKJV	Mark	15	11	But ( J ) the chief priests stirred up the crowd , so that he should rather release Barabbas to them .
NKJV	Mark	15	12	Pilate answered and said to them again , “ What then do you want me to do with Him whom you call the ( K ) King of the Jews ? ”
NKJV	Mark	15	13	So they cried out again , “ Crucify Him ! ”
NKJV	Mark	15	14	Then Pilate said to them , “ Why , ( L ) what evil has He done ? ” But they cried out all the more , “ Crucify Him ! ”
NKJV	Mark	15	16	( P ) Then the soldiers led Him away into the hall called [ c ] Praetorium , and they called together the whole garrison .
NKJV	Mark	15	17	And they clothed Him with purple ; and they twisted a crown of thorns , put it on His head ,
NKJV	Mark	15	18	and began to salute Him , “ Hail , King of the Jews ! ”
NKJV	Mark	15	19	Then they ( Q ) struck Him on the head with a reed and spat on Him ; and bowing the knee , they worshiped Him .
NKJV	Mark	15	20	And when they had ( R ) mocked Him , they took the purple off Him , put His own clothes on Him , and led Him out to crucify Him . The King on a Cross ( S )

NKJV	Mark	15	22	( U ) And they brought Him to the place Golgotha , which is translated , Place of a Skull .
NKJV	Mark	15	23	( V ) Then they gave Him wine mingled with myrrh to drink , but He did not take it .
NKJV	Mark	15	24	And when they crucified Him , ( W ) they divided His garments , casting lots for them to determine what every man should take .
NKJV	Mark	15	25	Now ( X ) it was the third hour , and they crucified Him .

NKJV	Mark	15	30	save Yourself , and come down from the cross ! ”
NKJV	Mark	15	31	Likewise the chief priests also , ( AE ) mocking among themselves with the scribes , said , “ He saved ( AF ) others ; Himself He can not save .
NKJV	Mark	15	32	Let the Christ , the King of Israel , descend now from the cross , that we may see and [ f ] believe. ” Even ( AG ) those who were crucified with Him reviled Him . Jesus Dies on the Cross ( AH )
NKJV	Mark	15	33	Now ( AI ) when the sixth hour had come , there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour .
NKJV	Mark	15	34	And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice , saying , “ Eloi , Eloi , lama sabachthani ? ” which is translated , ( AJ ) “ My God , My God , why have You forsaken Me ? ”
NKJV	Mark	15	35	Some of those who stood by , when they heard that , said , “ Look , He is calling for Elijah ! ”
NKJV	Mark	15	36	Then ( AK ) someone ran and filled a sponge full of sour wine , put it on a reed , and ( AL ) offered it to Him to drink , saying , “ Let Him alone ; let us see if Elijah will come to take Him down. ”

NKJV	Mark	15	44	Pilate marveled that He was already dead ; and summoning the centurion , he asked him if He had been dead for some time .
NKJV	Mark	15	45	So when he found out from the centurion , he granted the body to Joseph .
NKJV	Mark	15	46	( AV ) Then he bought fine linen , took Him down , and wrapped Him in the linen . And he laid Him in a tomb which had been hewn out of the rock , and rolled a stone against the door of the tomb .

NKJV	Mark	16	3	And they said among themselves , “ Who will roll away the stone from the door of the tomb for us ? ”
NKJV	Mark	16	4	But when they looked up , they saw that the stone had been rolled away—for it was very large .
NKJV	Mark	16	5	( E ) And entering the tomb , they saw a young man clothed in a long white robe sitting on the right side ; and they were alarmed .
NKJV	Mark	16	6	( F ) But he said to them , “ Do not be alarmed . You seek Jesus of Nazareth , who was crucified . He is risen ! He is not here . See the place where they laid Him .
NKJV	Mark	16	7	But go , tell His disciples—and Peter—that He is going [ a ] before you into Galilee ; there you will see Him , ( G ) as He said to you. ”

NKJV	Luke	1	2	just as those who ( B ) from the beginning were ( C ) eyewitnesses and ministers of the word ( D ) delivered them to us ,
NKJV	Luke	1	3	it seemed good to me also , having [ b ] had perfect understanding of all things from the very first , to write to you an orderly account , ( E ) most excellent Theophilus ,
NKJV	Luke	1	4	( F ) that you may know the certainty of those things in which you were instructed . John ’ s Birth Announced to Zacharias
NKJV	Luke	1	5	There was ( G ) in the days of Herod , the king of Judea , a certain priest named Zacharias , ( H ) of the division of ( I ) Abijah . His ( J ) wife was of the daughters of Aaron , and her name was Elizabeth .
NKJV	Luke	1	6	And they were both righteous before God , walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless .
NKJV	Luke	1	7	But they had no child , because Elizabeth was barren , and they were both well advanced in years .
NKJV	Luke	1	8	So it was , that while he was serving as priest before God in the order of his division ,
NKJV	Luke	1	9	according to the custom of the priesthood , [ c ] his lot fell ( K ) to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord .
NKJV	Luke	1	10	( L ) And the whole multitude of the people was praying outside at the hour of incense .
NKJV	Luke	1	11	Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him , standing on the right side of ( M ) the altar of incense .
NKJV	Luke	1	12	And when Zacharias saw him , ( N ) he was troubled , and fear fell upon him .
NKJV	Luke	1	13	But the angel said to him , “ Do not be afraid , Zacharias , for your prayer is heard ; and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son , and ( O ) you shall call his name John .
NKJV	Luke	1	14	And you will have joy and gladness , and ( P ) many will rejoice at his birth .
NKJV	Luke	1	15	For he will be ( Q ) great in the sight of the Lord , and ( R ) shall drink neither wine nor strong drink . He will also be filled with the Holy Spirit , ( S ) even from his mother ’ s womb .
NKJV	Luke	1	16	And he will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God .
NKJV	Luke	1	17	( T ) He will also go before Him in the spirit and power of Elijah , ‘ to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children , ’ and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just , to make ready a people prepared for the Lord. ”
NKJV	Luke	1	18	And Zacharias said to the angel , ( U ) “ How shall I know this ? For I am an old man , and my wife is well advanced in years. ”
NKJV	Luke	1	19	And the angel answered and said to him , “ I am ( V ) Gabriel , who stands in the presence of God , and was sent to speak to you and bring you [ d ] these glad ( W ) tidings .
NKJV	Luke	1	20	But behold , ( X ) you will be mute and not able to speak until the day these things take place , because you did not believe my words which will be fulfilled in their own time. ”
NKJV	Luke	1	21	And the people waited for Zacharias , and marveled that he lingered so long in the temple .
NKJV	Luke	1	22	But when he came out , he could not speak to them ; and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple , for he beckoned to them and remained speechless .
NKJV	Luke	1	23	So it was , as soon as ( Y ) the days of his service were completed , that he departed to his own house .
NKJV	Luke	1	24	Now after those days his wife Elizabeth conceived ; and she hid herself five months , saying ,
NKJV	Luke	1	25	“ Thus the Lord has dealt with me , in the days when He looked on me , to ( Z ) take away my reproach among people. ” Christ ’ s Birth Announced to Mary
NKJV	Luke	1	26	Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth ,
NKJV	Luke	1	27	to a virgin ( AA ) betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph , of the house of David . The virgin ’ s name was Mary .
NKJV	Luke	1	28	And having come in , the angel said to her , ( AB ) “ Rejoice , highly favored one , ( AC ) the Lord is with you ; [ e ] blessed are you among women ! ”
NKJV	Luke	1	29	But [ f ] when she saw him , ( AD ) she was troubled at his saying , and considered what manner of greeting this was .
NKJV	Luke	1	30	Then the angel said to her , “ Do not be afraid , Mary , for you have found ( AE ) favor with God .
NKJV	Luke	1	31	( AF ) And behold , you will conceive in your womb and bring forth a Son , and ( AG ) shall call His name Jesus .

NKJV	Luke	1	33	( AL ) And He will reign over the house of Jacob forever , and of His kingdom there will be no end. ”
NKJV	Luke	1	34	Then Mary said to the angel , “ How can this be , since I [ g ] do not know a man ? ”
NKJV	Luke	1	35	And the angel answered and said to her , ( AM ) “ The Holy Spirit will come upon you , and the power of the Highest will overshadow you ; therefore , also , that Holy One who is to be born will be called ( AN ) the Son of God .
NKJV	Luke	1	36	Now indeed , Elizabeth your relative has also conceived a son in her old age ; and this is now the sixth month for her who was called barren .
NKJV	Luke	1	37	For ( AO ) with God nothing will be impossible. ”
NKJV	Luke	1	38	Then Mary said , “ Behold the maidservant of the Lord ! Let it be to me according to your word. ” And the angel departed from her . Mary Visits Elizabeth
NKJV	Luke	1	39	Now Mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste , ( AP ) to a city of Judah ,

NKJV	Luke	1	42	Then she spoke out with a loud voice and said , ( AR ) “ Blessed are you among women , and blessed is the fruit of your womb !
NKJV	Luke	1	43	But why is this granted to me , that the mother of my Lord should come to me ?
NKJV	Luke	1	44	For indeed , as soon as the voice of your greeting sounded in my ears , the babe leaped in my womb for joy .
NKJV	Luke	1	45	( AS ) Blessed is she who [ h ] believed , for there will be a fulfillment of those things which were told her from the Lord. ” The Song of Mary
NKJV	Luke	1	46	And Mary said : ( AT ) “ My soul [ i ] magnifies the Lord ,
NKJV	Luke	1	47	And my spirit has ( AU ) rejoiced in ( AV ) God my Savior .
NKJV	Luke	1	48	For ( AW ) He has regarded the lowly state of His maidservant ; For behold , henceforth ( AX ) all generations will call me blessed .
NKJV	Luke	1	49	For He who is mighty ( AY ) has done great things for me , And ( AZ ) holy is His name .
NKJV	Luke	1	50	And ( BA ) His mercy is on those who fear Him From generation to generation .
NKJV	Luke	1	51	( BB ) He has shown strength with His arm ; ( BC ) He has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts .
NKJV	Luke	1	52	( BD ) He has put down the mighty from their thrones , And exalted the lowly .
NKJV	Luke	1	53	He has ( BE ) filled the hungry with good things , And the rich He has sent away empty .
NKJV	Luke	1	54	He has helped His ( BF ) servant Israel , ( BG ) In remembrance of His mercy ,
NKJV	Luke	1	55	( BH ) As He spoke to our ( BI ) fathers , To Abraham and to his ( BJ ) seed forever. ”

NKJV	Luke	1	60	His mother answered and said , ( BM ) “ No ; he shall be called John. ”
NKJV	Luke	1	61	But they said to her , “ There is no one among your relatives who is called by this name. ”
NKJV	Luke	1	62	So they made signs to his father—what he would have him called .
NKJV	Luke	1	63	And he asked for a writing tablet , and wrote , saying , “ His name is John. ” So they all marveled .
NKJV	Luke	1	64	Immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed , and he spoke , praising God .
NKJV	Luke	1	65	Then fear came on all who dwelt around them ; and all these sayings were discussed throughout all the hill country of Judea .

NKJV	Luke	1	68	“ Blessed ( BQ ) is the Lord God of Israel , For ( BR ) He has visited and redeemed His people ,
NKJV	Luke	1	69	( BS ) And has raised up a horn of salvation for us In the house of His servant David ,
NKJV	Luke	1	70	( BT ) As He spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets , Who have been ( BU ) since the world began ,
NKJV	Luke	1	71	That we should be saved from our enemies And from the hand of all who hate us ,
NKJV	Luke	1	72	( BV ) To perform the mercy promised to our fathers And to remember His holy covenant ,

NKJV	Luke	1	77	To give ( CB ) knowledge of salvation to His people By the remission of their sins ,
NKJV	Luke	1	78	Through the tender mercy of our God , With which the [ j ] Dayspring from on high [ k ] has visited us ;
NKJV	Luke	1	79	( CC ) To give light to those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death , To ( CD ) guide our feet into the way of peace. ”

NKJV	Luke	2	4	Joseph also went up from Galilee , out of the city of Nazareth , into Judea , to ( C ) the city of David , which is called Bethlehem , ( D ) because he was of the house and lineage of David ,
NKJV	Luke	2	5	to be registered with Mary , ( E ) his betrothed [ a ] wife , who was with child .
NKJV	Luke	2	6	So it was , that while they were there , the days were completed for her to be delivered .

NKJV	Luke	2	12	And this will be the sign to you : You will find a Babe wrapped in swaddling cloths , lying in a [ d ] manger. ”
NKJV	Luke	2	13	( M ) And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying :
NKJV	Luke	2	15	So it was , when the angels had gone away from them into heaven , that the shepherds said to one another , “ Let us now go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has come to pass , which the Lord has made known to us. ”
NKJV	Luke	2	16	And they came with haste and found Mary and Joseph , and the Babe lying in a manger .
NKJV	Luke	2	17	Now when they had seen Him , they made [ f ] widely known the saying which was told them concerning this Child .
NKJV	Luke	2	18	And all those who heard it marveled at those things which were told them by the shepherds .
NKJV	Luke	2	19	( Q ) But Mary kept all these things and pondered them in her heart .

NKJV	Luke	2	26	And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not ( AA ) see death before he had seen the Lord ’ s Christ .
NKJV	Luke	2	27	So he came ( AB ) by the Spirit into the temple . And when the parents brought in the Child Jesus , to do for Him according to the custom of the law ,
NKJV	Luke	2	28	he took Him up in his arms and blessed God and said :
NKJV	Luke	2	29	“ Lord , ( AC ) now You are letting Your servant depart in peace , According to Your word ;

NKJV	Luke	2	31	Which You have prepared before the face of all peoples ,
NKJV	Luke	2	32	( AE ) A light to bring revelation to the Gentiles , And the glory of Your people Israel. ”
NKJV	Luke	2	33	[ h ] And Joseph and His mother marveled at those things which were spoken of Him .

NKJV	Luke	2	37	and this woman was a widow [ i ] of about eighty-four years , who did not depart from the temple , but served God with fastings and prayers ( AJ ) night and day .
NKJV	Luke	2	38	And coming in that instant she gave thanks to [ j ] the Lord , and spoke of Him to all those who ( AK ) looked for redemption in Jerusalem . The Family Returns to Nazareth

NKJV	Luke	2	43	When they had finished the ( AP ) days , as they returned , the Boy Jesus lingered behind in Jerusalem . And [ l ] Joseph and His mother did not know it ;
NKJV	Luke	2	44	but supposing Him to have been in the company , they went a day ’ s journey , and sought Him among their relatives and acquaintances .
NKJV	Luke	2	45	So when they did not find Him , they returned to Jerusalem , seeking Him .

NKJV	Luke	3	8	Therefore bear fruits ( K ) worthy of repentance , and do not begin to say to yourselves , ‘ We have Abraham as our father. ’ For I say to you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones .
NKJV	Luke	3	9	And even now the ax is laid to the root of the trees . Therefore ( L ) every tree which does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. ”

NKJV	Luke	3	16	John answered , saying to all , ( S ) “ I indeed baptize you with water ; but One mightier than I is coming , whose sandal strap I am not worthy to loose . He will ( T ) baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire .
NKJV	Luke	3	17	His winnowing fan is in His hand , and He will thoroughly clean out His threshing floor , and ( U ) gather the wheat into His barn ; but the chaff He will burn with unquenchable fire. ”
NKJV	Luke	3	18	And with many other exhortations he preached to the people .
NKJV	Luke	3	19	( V ) But Herod the tetrarch , being rebuked by him concerning Herodias , his [ d ] brother Philip ’ s wife , and for all the evils which Herod had done ,

NKJV	Luke	4	3	And the devil said to Him , “ If You are ( E ) the Son of God , command this stone to become bread. ”
NKJV	Luke	4	5	[ d ] Then the devil , taking Him up on a high mountain , showed Him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time .
NKJV	Luke	4	6	And the devil said to Him , “ All this authority I will give You , and their glory ; for ( G ) this has been delivered to me , and I give it to whomever I wish .
NKJV	Luke	4	7	Therefore , if You will worship before me , all will be Yours. ”
NKJV	Luke	4	8	And Jesus answered and said to him , [ e ] “ Get behind Me , Satan ! [ f ] For it is written , ( H ) ‘ You shall worship the Lord your God , and Him only you shall serve. ’ ”
NKJV	Luke	4	9	( I ) Then he brought Him to Jerusalem , set Him on the pinnacle of the temple , and said to Him , “ If You are the Son of God , throw Yourself down from here .

NKJV	Luke	4	16	So He came to ( V ) Nazareth , where He had been brought up . And as His custom was , ( W ) He went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day , and stood up to read .
NKJV	Luke	4	17	And He was handed the book of the prophet Isaiah . And when He had opened the book , He found the place where it was written :

NKJV	Luke	4	21	And He began to say to them , “ Today this Scripture is ( Z ) fulfilled in your hearing. ”

NKJV	Luke	4	23	He said to them , “ You will surely say this proverb to Me , ‘ Physician , heal yourself ! Whatever we have heard done in ( AC ) Capernaum , [ k ] do also here in ( AD ) Your country. ’ ”
NKJV	Luke	4	24	Then He said , “ Assuredly , I say to you , no ( AE ) prophet is accepted in his own country .
NKJV	Luke	4	25	But I tell you truly , ( AF ) many widows were in Israel in the days of Elijah , when the heaven was shut up three years and six months , and there was a great famine throughout all the land ;
NKJV	Luke	4	26	but to none of them was Elijah sent except to [ l ] Zarephath , in the region of Sidon , to a woman who was a widow .
NKJV	Luke	4	27	( AG ) And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet , and none of them was cleansed except Naaman the Syrian. ”
NKJV	Luke	4	28	So all those in the synagogue , when they heard these things , were ( AH ) filled with [ m ] wrath ,
NKJV	Luke	4	29	( AI ) and rose up and thrust Him out of the city ; and they led Him to the brow of the hill on which their city was built , that they might throw Him down over the cliff .

NKJV	Luke	4	33	( AO ) Now in the synagogue there was a man who had a spirit of an unclean demon . And he cried out with a loud voice ,
NKJV	Luke	4	34	saying , “ Let us alone ! What have we to do with You , Jesus of Nazareth ? Did You come to destroy us ? ( AP ) I know who You are— ( AQ ) the Holy One of God ! ”
NKJV	Luke	4	35	But Jesus rebuked him , saying , [ n ] “ Be quiet , and come out of him ! ” And when the demon had thrown him in their midst , it came out of him and did not hurt him .
NKJV	Luke	4	36	Then they were all amazed and spoke among themselves , saying , “ What a word this is ! For with authority and power He commands the unclean spirits , and they come out. ”
NKJV	Luke	4	37	And the report about Him went out into every place in the surrounding region . Peter ’ s Mother-in-Law Healed ( AR )

NKJV	Luke	5	5	But Simon answered and said to Him , “ Master , we have toiled all night and caught ( F ) nothing ; nevertheless ( G ) at Your word I will let down the net. ”
NKJV	Luke	5	2	and saw two boats standing by the lake ; but the fishermen had gone from them and were washing their nets .
NKJV	Luke	5	3	Then He got into one of the boats , which was Simon ’ s , and asked him to put out a little from the land . And He ( D ) sat down and taught the multitudes from the boat .
NKJV	Luke	5	4	When He had stopped speaking , He said to Simon , ( E ) “ Launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch. ”
NKJV	Luke	5	6	And when they had done this , they caught a great number of fish , and their net was breaking .
NKJV	Luke	5	7	So they signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them . And they came and filled both the boats , so that they began to sink .
NKJV	Luke	5	8	When Simon Peter saw it , he fell down at Jesus ’ knees , saying , ( H ) “ Depart from me , for I am a sinful man , O Lord ! ”
NKJV	Luke	5	9	For he and all who were with him were ( I ) astonished at the catch of fish which they had taken ;
NKJV	Luke	5	10	and so also were James and John , the sons of Zebedee , who were partners with Simon . And Jesus said to Simon , “ Do not be afraid . ( J ) From now on you will catch men. ”
NKJV	Luke	5	11	So when they had brought their boats to land , ( K ) they [ a ] forsook all and followed Him . Jesus Cleanses a Leper ( L )
NKJV	Luke	5	12	( M ) And it happened when He was in a certain city , that behold , a man who was full of ( N ) leprosy saw Jesus ; and he fell on his face and [ b ] implored Him , saying , “ Lord , if You are willing , You can make me clean. ”
NKJV	Luke	5	13	Then He put out His hand and touched him , saying , “ I am willing ; be cleansed. ” ( O ) Immediately the leprosy left him .
NKJV	Luke	5	14	( P ) And He charged him to tell no one , “ But go and show yourself to the priest , and make an offering for your cleansing , as a testimony to them , ( Q ) just as Moses commanded. ”
NKJV	Luke	5	15	However , ( R ) the report went around concerning Him all the more ; and ( S ) great multitudes came together to hear , and to be healed by Him of their infirmities .
NKJV	Luke	5	16	( T ) So He Himself often withdrew into the wilderness and ( U ) prayed . Jesus Forgives and Heals a Paralytic ( V )
NKJV	Luke	5	17	Now it happened on a certain day , as He was teaching , that there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting by , who had come out of every town of Galilee , Judea , and Jerusalem . And the power of the Lord was present [ c ] to heal them .
NKJV	Luke	5	18	( W ) Then behold , men brought on a bed a man who was paralyzed , whom they sought to bring in and lay before Him .
NKJV	Luke	5	19	And when they could not find how they might bring him in , because of the crowd , they went up on the housetop and let him down with his bed through the tiling into the midst ( X ) before Jesus .
NKJV	Luke	5	20	When He saw their faith , He said to him , “ Man , your sins are forgiven you. ”
NKJV	Luke	5	21	( Y ) And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason , saying , “ Who is this who speaks blasphemies ? ( Z ) Who can forgive sins but God alone ? ”
NKJV	Luke	5	22	But when Jesus ( AA ) perceived their thoughts , He answered and said to them , “ Why are you reasoning in your hearts ?
NKJV	Luke	5	23	Which is easier , to say , ‘ Your sins are forgiven you , ’ or to say , ‘ Rise up and walk ’ ?
NKJV	Luke	5	24	But that you may know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins ” —He said to the man who was paralyzed , ( AB ) “ I say to you , arise , take up your bed , and go to your house. ”
NKJV	Luke	5	25	Immediately he rose up before them , took up what he had been lying on , and departed to his own house , ( AC ) glorifying God .
NKJV	Luke	5	26	And they were all amazed , and they ( AD ) glorified God and were filled with fear , saying , “ We have seen strange things today ! ” Matthew the Tax Collector ( AE )
NKJV	Luke	5	27	( AF ) After these things He went out and saw a tax collector named Levi , sitting at the tax office . And He said to him , ( AG ) “ Follow Me. ”
NKJV	Luke	5	28	So he left all , rose up , and ( AH ) followed Him .
NKJV	Luke	5	29	( AI ) Then Levi gave Him a great feast in his own house . And ( AJ ) there were a great number of tax collectors and others who sat down with them .
NKJV	Luke	5	30	[ d ] And their scribes and the Pharisees [ e ] complained against His disciples , saying , ( AK ) “ Why do You eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners ? ”
NKJV	Luke	5	31	Jesus answered and said to them , “ Those who are well have no need of a physician , but those who are sick .
NKJV	Luke	5	32	( AL ) I have not come to call the righteous , but sinners , to repentance. ” Jesus Is Questioned About Fasting ( AM )
NKJV	Luke	5	33	Then they said to Him , ( AN ) “ Why [ f ] do the disciples of John fast often and make prayers , and likewise those of the Pharisees , but Yours eat and drink ? ”
NKJV	Luke	5	34	And He said to them , “ Can you make the friends of the bridegroom fast while the ( AO ) bridegroom is with them ?
NKJV	Luke	5	35	But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them ; then they will fast in those days. ”
NKJV	Luke	5	36	( AP ) Then He spoke a parable to them : “ No one [ g ] puts a piece from a new garment on an old one ; otherwise the new makes a tear , and also the piece that was taken out of the new does not match the old .
NKJV	Luke	5	37	And no one puts new wine into old wineskins ; or else the new wine will burst the wineskins and be spilled , and the wineskins will be ruined .
NKJV	Luke	5	38	But new wine must be put into new wineskins , [ h ] and both are preserved .
NKJV	Luke	5	39	And no one , having drunk old wine , [ i ] immediately desires new ; for he says , ‘ The old is [ j ] better. ’ ” Footnotes - Luke 5:11 left behind - Luke 5:12 begged - Luke 5:17 NU with Him to heal - Luke 5:30 NU But the Pharisees and their scribes - Luke 5:30 grumbled - Luke 5:33 NU omits Why do , making the verse a statement - Luke 5:36 NU tears a piece from a new garment and puts it on an old one - Luke 5:38 NU omits and both are preserved - Luke 5:39 NU omits immediately - Luke 5:39 NU good Scripture taken from the New King James Version® .

NKJV	Luke	6	6	( G ) Now it happened on another Sabbath , also , that He entered the synagogue and taught . And a man was there whose right hand was withered .
NKJV	Luke	6	2	And some of the Pharisees said to them , “ Why are you doing ( C ) what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath ? ”
NKJV	Luke	6	3	But Jesus answering them said , “ Have you not even read this , ( D ) what David did when he was hungry , he and those who were with him :
NKJV	Luke	6	4	how he went into the house of God , took and ate the showbread , and also gave some to those with him , ( E ) which is not lawful for any but the priests to eat ? ”
NKJV	Luke	6	5	And He said to them , “ The Son of Man is also Lord of the Sabbath. ” Healing on the Sabbath ( F )
NKJV	Luke	6	7	So the scribes and Pharisees watched Him closely , whether He would ( H ) heal on the Sabbath , that they might find an ( I ) accusation against Him .
NKJV	Luke	6	8	But He ( J ) knew their thoughts , and said to the man who had the withered hand , “ Arise and stand here. ” And he arose and stood .
NKJV	Luke	6	9	Then Jesus said to them , “ I will ask you one thing : ( K ) Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil , to save life or [ b ] to destroy ? ”
NKJV	Luke	6	10	And when He had looked around at them all , He said to [ c ] the man , “ Stretch out your hand. ” And he did so , and his hand was restored [ d ] as whole as the other .
NKJV	Luke	6	11	But they were filled with rage , and discussed with one another what they might do to Jesus . The Twelve Apostles ( L )
NKJV	Luke	6	12	Now it came to pass in those days that He went out to the mountain to pray , and continued all night in ( M ) prayer to God .
NKJV	Luke	6	13	And when it was day , He called His disciples to Himself ; ( N ) and from them He chose ( O ) twelve whom He also named apostles :
NKJV	Luke	6	14	Simon , ( P ) whom He also named Peter , and Andrew his brother ; James and John ; Philip and Bartholomew ;
NKJV	Luke	6	15	Matthew and Thomas ; James the son of Alphaeus , and Simon called the Zealot ;
NKJV	Luke	6	16	Judas ( Q ) the son of James , and ( R ) Judas Iscariot who also became a traitor . Jesus Heals a Great Multitude ( S )
NKJV	Luke	6	17	And He came down with them and stood on a level place with a crowd of His disciples ( T ) and a great multitude of people from all Judea and Jerusalem , and from the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon , who came to hear Him and be healed of their diseases ,
NKJV	Luke	6	18	as well as those who were tormented with unclean spirits . And they were healed .
NKJV	Luke	6	19	And the whole multitude ( U ) sought to ( V ) touch Him , for ( W ) power went out from Him and healed them all . The Beatitudes ( X )
NKJV	Luke	6	20	Then He lifted up His eyes toward His disciples , and said : ( Y ) “ Blessed are you poor , For yours is the kingdom of God .
NKJV	Luke	6	21	( Z ) Blessed are you who hunger now , For you shall be ( AA ) filled . [ e ] ( AB ) Blessed are you who weep now , For you shall ( AC ) laugh .
NKJV	Luke	6	22	( AD ) Blessed are you when men hate you , And when they ( AE ) exclude you , And revile you , and cast out your name as evil , For the Son of Man ’ s sake .
NKJV	Luke	6	23	( AF ) Rejoice in that day and leap for joy ! For indeed your reward is great in heaven , For ( AG ) in like manner their fathers did to the prophets . Jesus Pronounces Woes
NKJV	Luke	6	24	“ But ( AH ) woe to you ( AI ) who are rich , For ( AJ ) you have received your consolation .
NKJV	Luke	6	25	( AK ) Woe to you who are full , For you shall hunger . ( AL ) Woe to you who laugh now , For you shall mourn and ( AM ) weep .
NKJV	Luke	6	26	( AN ) Woe [ f ] to you when [ g ] all men speak well of you , For so did their fathers to the false prophets . Love Your Enemies ( AO )
NKJV	Luke	6	27	( AP ) “ But I say to you who hear : Love your enemies , do good to those who hate you ,
NKJV	Luke	6	28	( AQ ) bless those who curse you , and ( AR ) pray for those who spitefully use you .
NKJV	Luke	6	29	( AS ) To him who strikes you on the one cheek , offer the other also . ( AT ) And from him who takes away your cloak , do not withhold your tunic either .
NKJV	Luke	6	30	( AU ) Give to everyone who asks of you . And from him who takes away your goods do not ask them back .
NKJV	Luke	6	31	( AV ) And just as you want men to do to you , you also do to them likewise .
NKJV	Luke	6	32	( AW ) “ But if you love those who love you , what credit is that to you ? For even sinners love those who love them .
NKJV	Luke	6	33	And if you do good to those who do good to you , what credit is that to you ? For even sinners do the same .
NKJV	Luke	6	34	( AX ) And if you lend to those from whom you hope to receive back , what credit is that to you ? For even sinners lend to sinners to receive as much back .
NKJV	Luke	6	35	But ( AY ) love your enemies , ( AZ ) do good , and ( BA ) lend , [ h ] hoping for nothing in return ; and your reward will be great , and ( BB ) you will be sons of the Most High . For He is kind to the unthankful and evil .
NKJV	Luke	6	36	( BC ) Therefore be merciful , just as your Father also is merciful . Do Not Judge ( BD )
NKJV	Luke	6	37	( BE ) “ Judge not , and you shall not be judged . Condemn not , and you shall not be condemned . ( BF ) Forgive , and you will be forgiven .
NKJV	Luke	6	38	( BG ) Give , and it will be given to you : good measure , pressed down , shaken together , and running over will be put into your ( BH ) bosom . For ( BI ) with the same measure that you use , it will be measured back to you. ”
NKJV	Luke	6	39	And He spoke a parable to them : ( BJ ) “ Can the blind lead the blind ? Will they not both fall into the ditch ?
NKJV	Luke	6	40	( BK ) A disciple is not above his teacher , but everyone who is perfectly trained will be like his teacher .
NKJV	Luke	6	41	( BL ) And why do you look at the speck in your brother ’ s eye , but do not perceive the plank in your own eye ?
NKJV	Luke	6	42	Or how can you say to your brother , ‘ Brother , let me remove the speck that is in your eye , ’ when you yourself do not see the plank that is in your own eye ? Hypocrite ! First remove the plank from your own eye , and then you will see clearly to remove the speck that is in your brother ’ s eye . A Tree Is Known by Its Fruit ( BM )
NKJV	Luke	6	43	( BN ) “ For a good tree does not bear bad fruit , nor does a bad tree bear good fruit .
NKJV	Luke	6	44	For ( BO ) every tree is known by its own fruit . For men do not gather figs from thorns , nor do they gather grapes from a bramble bush .
NKJV	Luke	6	45	( BP ) A good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth good ; and an evil man out of the evil [ i ] treasure of his heart brings forth evil . For out ( BQ ) of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks . Build on the Rock ( BR )
NKJV	Luke	6	46	( BS ) “ But why do you call Me ‘ Lord , Lord , ’ and not do the things which I say ?
NKJV	Luke	6	47	( BT ) Whoever comes to Me , and hears My sayings and does them , I will show you whom he is like :
NKJV	Luke	6	48	He is like a man building a house , who dug deep and laid the foundation on the rock . And when the flood arose , the stream beat vehemently against that house , and could not shake it , for it was [ j ] founded on the rock .
NKJV	Luke	6	49	But he who heard and did nothing is like a man who built a house on the earth without a foundation , against which the stream beat vehemently ; and immediately it [ k ] fell . And the ruin of that house was great. ” Footnotes Scripture taken from the New King James Version® . Copyright ©

NKJV	Luke	7	7	Therefore I did not even think myself worthy to come to You . But ( C ) say the word , and my servant will be healed .
NKJV	Luke	7	2	And a certain centurion ’ s servant , who was dear to him , was sick and ready to die .
NKJV	Luke	7	3	So when he heard about Jesus , he sent elders of the Jews to Him , pleading with Him to come and heal his servant .
NKJV	Luke	7	4	And when they came to Jesus , they begged Him earnestly , saying that the one for whom He should do this was deserving ,
NKJV	Luke	7	5	“ for he loves our nation , and has built us a synagogue. ”
NKJV	Luke	7	6	Then Jesus went with them . And when He was already not far from the house , the centurion sent friends to Him , saying to Him , “ Lord , do not trouble Yourself , for I am not worthy that You should enter under my roof .
NKJV	Luke	7	8	For I also am a man placed under ( D ) authority , having soldiers under me . And I say to one , ‘ Go , ’ and he goes ; and to another , ‘ Come , ’ and he comes ; and to my servant , ‘ Do this , ’ and he does it. ”
NKJV	Luke	7	9	When Jesus heard these things , He marveled at him , and turned around and said to the crowd that followed Him , “ I say to you , I have not found such great faith , not even in Israel ! ”
NKJV	Luke	7	10	And those who were sent , returning to the house , found the servant well [ a ] who had been sick . Jesus Raises the Son of the Widow of Nain
NKJV	Luke	7	11	Now it happened , the day after , that He went into a city called Nain ; and many of His disciples went with Him , and a large crowd .
NKJV	Luke	7	12	And when He came near the gate of the city , behold , a dead man was being carried out , the only son of his mother ; and she was a widow . And a large crowd from the city was with her .
NKJV	Luke	7	13	When the Lord saw her , He had ( E ) compassion on her and said to her , ( F ) “ Do not weep. ”
NKJV	Luke	7	14	Then He came and touched the open coffin , and those who carried him stood still . And He said , “ Young man , I say to you , ( G ) arise. ”
NKJV	Luke	7	15	So he who was dead ( H ) sat up and began to speak . And He ( I ) presented him to his mother .
NKJV	Luke	7	16	( J ) Then fear [ b ] came upon all , and they ( K ) glorified God , saying , ( L ) “ A great prophet has risen up among us ” ; and , ( M ) “ God has visited His people. ”
NKJV	Luke	7	17	And this report about Him went throughout all Judea and all the surrounding region . John the Baptist Sends Messengers to Jesus ( N )
NKJV	Luke	7	18	( O ) Then the disciples of John reported to him concerning all these things .
NKJV	Luke	7	19	And John , calling two of his disciples to him , sent them to [ c ] Jesus , saying , “ Are You ( P ) the Coming One , or [ d ] do we look for another ? ”
NKJV	Luke	7	20	When the men had come to Him , they said , “ John the Baptist has sent us to You , saying , ‘ Are You the Coming One , or do we look for another ? ’ ”
NKJV	Luke	7	21	And that very hour He cured many of [ e ] infirmities , afflictions , and evil spirits ; and to many blind He gave sight .
NKJV	Luke	7	22	( Q ) Jesus answered and said to them , “ Go and tell John the things you have seen and heard : ( R ) that the blind ( S ) see , the lame ( T ) walk , the lepers are ( U ) cleansed , the deaf ( V ) hear , the dead are raised , ( W ) the poor have the gospel preached to them .
NKJV	Luke	7	23	And blessed is he who is not [ f ] offended because of Me. ”
NKJV	Luke	7	24	( X ) When the messengers of John had departed , He began to speak to the multitudes concerning John : “ What did you go out into the wilderness to see ? A reed shaken by the wind ?
NKJV	Luke	7	25	But what did you go out to see ? A man clothed in soft garments ? Indeed those who are gorgeously appareled and live in luxury are in kings ’ courts .
NKJV	Luke	7	26	But what did you go out to see ? A prophet ? Yes , I say to you , and more than a prophet .
NKJV	Luke	7	27	This is he of whom it is written : ( Y ) ‘ Behold , I send My messenger before Your face , Who will prepare Your way before You. ’
NKJV	Luke	7	28	For I say to you , among those born of women there is [ g ] not a ( Z ) greater prophet than John the Baptist ; but he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he. ”
NKJV	Luke	7	29	And when all the people heard Him , even the tax collectors [ h ] justified God , ( AA ) having been baptized with the baptism of John .
NKJV	Luke	7	30	But the Pharisees and [ i ] lawyers rejected ( AB ) the will of God for themselves , not having been baptized by him .
NKJV	Luke	7	31	[ j ] And the Lord said , ( AC ) “ To what then shall I liken the men of this generation , and what are they like ?
NKJV	Luke	7	32	They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling to one another , saying : ‘ We played the flute for you , And you did not dance ; We mourned to you , And you did not weep. ’
NKJV	Luke	7	33	For ( AD ) John the Baptist came ( AE ) neither eating bread nor drinking wine , and you say , ‘ He has a demon. ’
NKJV	Luke	7	34	The Son of Man has come ( AF ) eating and drinking , and you say , ‘ Look , a glutton and a [ k ] winebibber , a friend of tax collectors and sinners ! ’
NKJV	Luke	7	35	( AG ) But wisdom is justified by all her children. ” A Sinful Woman Forgiven
NKJV	Luke	7	36	( AH ) Then one of the Pharisees asked Him to eat with him . And He went to the Pharisee ’ s house , and sat down to eat .
NKJV	Luke	7	37	And behold , a woman in the city who was a sinner , when she knew that Jesus sat at the table in the Pharisee ’ s house , brought an alabaster flask of fragrant oil ,
NKJV	Luke	7	38	and stood at His feet behind Him weeping ; and she began to wash His feet with her tears , and wiped them with the hair of her head ; and she kissed His feet and anointed them with the fragrant oil .
NKJV	Luke	7	39	Now when the Pharisee who had invited Him saw this , he spoke to himself , saying , ( AI ) “ This Man , if He were a prophet , would know who and what manner of woman this is who is touching Him , for she is a sinner. ”
NKJV	Luke	7	40	And Jesus answered and said to him , “ Simon , I have something to say to you. ” So he said , “ Teacher , say it. ”
NKJV	Luke	7	41	“ There was a certain creditor who had two debtors . One owed five hundred ( AJ ) denarii , and the other fifty .
NKJV	Luke	7	42	And when they had nothing with which to repay , he freely forgave them both . Tell Me , therefore , which of them will love him more ? ”
NKJV	Luke	7	43	Simon answered and said , “ I suppose the one whom he forgave more. ” And He said to him , “ You have rightly judged. ”
NKJV	Luke	7	44	Then He turned to the woman and said to Simon , “ Do you see this woman ? I entered your house ; you gave Me no ( AK ) water for My feet , but she has washed My feet with her tears and wiped them with the hair of her head .
NKJV	Luke	7	45	You gave Me no ( AL ) kiss , but this woman has not ceased to kiss My feet since the time I came in .
NKJV	Luke	7	46	( AM ) You did not anoint My head with oil , but this woman has anointed My feet with fragrant oil .
NKJV	Luke	7	47	( AN ) Therefore I say to you , her sins , which are many , are forgiven , for she loved much . But to whom little is forgiven , the same loves little. ”
NKJV	Luke	7	48	Then He said to her , ( AO ) “ Your sins are forgiven. ”
NKJV	Luke	7	49	And those who sat at the table with Him began to say to themselves , ( AP ) “ Who is this who even forgives sins ? ”
NKJV	Luke	7	50	Then He said to the woman , ( AQ ) “ Your faith has saved you .

NKJV	Luke	8	8	But others fell on good ground , sprang up , and yielded [ e ] a crop a hundredfold. ” When He had said these things He cried , ( E ) “ He who has ears to hear , let him hear ! ” The Purpose of Parables ( F )
NKJV	Luke	8	2	and ( A ) certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and [ b ] infirmities—Mary called Magdalene , ( B ) out of whom had come seven demons ,
NKJV	Luke	8	3	and Joanna the wife of Chuza , Herod ’ s steward , and Susanna , and many others who provided for [ c ] Him from their [ d ] substance . The Parable of the Sower ( C )
NKJV	Luke	8	4	( D ) And when a great multitude had gathered , and they had come to Him from every city , He spoke by a parable :
NKJV	Luke	8	5	“ A sower went out to sow his seed . And as he sowed , some fell by the wayside ; and it was trampled down , and the birds of the air devoured it .
NKJV	Luke	8	6	Some fell on rock ; and as soon as it sprang up , it withered away because it lacked moisture .
NKJV	Luke	8	7	And some fell among thorns , and the thorns sprang up with it and choked it .
NKJV	Luke	8	9	( G ) Then His disciples asked Him , saying , “ What does this parable mean ? ”
NKJV	Luke	8	10	And He said , “ To you it has been given to know the [ f ] mysteries of the kingdom of God , but to the rest it is given in parables , that ( H ) ‘ Seeing they may not see , And hearing they may not understand. ’ The Parable of the Sower Explained ( I )
NKJV	Luke	8	11	( J ) “ Now the parable is this : The seed is the ( K ) word of God .
NKJV	Luke	8	12	Those by the wayside are the ones who hear ; then the devil comes and takes away the word out of their hearts , lest they should believe and be saved .
NKJV	Luke	8	13	But the ones on the rock are those who , when they hear , receive the word with joy ; and these have no root , who believe for a while and in time of [ g ] temptation fall away .
NKJV	Luke	8	14	Now the ones that fell among thorns are those who , when they have heard , go out and are choked with cares , ( L ) riches , and pleasures of life , and bring no fruit to maturity .
NKJV	Luke	8	15	But the ones that fell on the good ground are those who , having heard the word with a noble and good heart , keep it and bear fruit with ( M ) patience . [ h ] The Parable of the Revealed Light ( N )
NKJV	Luke	8	16	( O ) “ No one , when he has lit a lamp , covers it with a vessel or puts it under a bed , but sets it on a lampstand , that those who enter may see the ( P ) light .
NKJV	Luke	8	17	( Q ) For nothing is secret that will not be ( R ) revealed , nor anything hidden that will not be known and come to light .
NKJV	Luke	8	18	Therefore take heed how you hear . ( S ) For whoever has , to him more will be given ; and whoever does not have , even what he [ i ] seems to ( T ) have will be taken from him. ” Jesus ’ Mother and Brothers Come to Him ( U )
NKJV	Luke	8	19	( V ) Then His mother and brothers came to Him , and could not approach Him because of the crowd .
NKJV	Luke	8	20	And it was told Him by some , who said , “ Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside , desiring to see You. ”
NKJV	Luke	8	21	But He answered and said to them , “ My mother and My brothers are these who hear the word of God and do it. ” Wind and Wave Obey Jesus ( W )
NKJV	Luke	8	22	( X ) Now it happened , on a certain day , that He got into a boat with His disciples . And He said to them , “ Let us cross over to the other side of the lake. ” And they launched out .
NKJV	Luke	8	23	But as they sailed He fell asleep . And a windstorm came down on the lake , and they were filling with water , and were in [ j ] jeopardy .
NKJV	Luke	8	24	And they came to Him and awoke Him , saying , “ Master , Master , we are perishing ! ” Then He arose and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water . And they ceased , and there was a calm .
NKJV	Luke	8	25	But He said to them , ( Y ) “ Where is your faith ? ” And they were afraid , and marveled , saying to one another , ( Z ) “ Who can this be ? For He commands even the winds and water , and they obey Him ! ” A Demon-Possessed Man Healed ( AA )
NKJV	Luke	8	26	( AB ) Then they sailed to the country of the [ k ] Gadarenes , which is opposite Galilee .
NKJV	Luke	8	27	And when He stepped out on the land , there met Him a certain man from the city who had demons [ l ] for a long time . And he wore no clothes , nor did he live in a house but in the tombs .
NKJV	Luke	8	28	When he saw Jesus , he ( AC ) cried out , fell down before Him , and with a loud voice said , ( AD ) “ What have I to do with ( AE ) You , Jesus , Son of the Most High God ? I beg You , do not torment me ! ”
NKJV	Luke	8	29	For He had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man . For it had often seized him , and he was kept under guard , bound with chains and shackles ; and he broke the bonds and was driven by the demon into the wilderness .
NKJV	Luke	8	30	Jesus asked him , saying , “ What is your name ? ” And he said , “ Legion , ” because many demons had entered him .
NKJV	Luke	8	31	And they begged Him that He would not command them to go out ( AF ) into the abyss .
NKJV	Luke	8	32	Now a herd of many ( AG ) swine was feeding there on the mountain . So they begged Him that He would permit them to enter them . And He permitted them .
NKJV	Luke	8	33	Then the demons went out of the man and entered the swine , and the herd ran violently down the steep place into the lake and drowned .
NKJV	Luke	8	34	When those who fed them saw what had happened , they fled and told it in the city and in the country .
NKJV	Luke	8	35	Then they went out to see what had happened , and came to Jesus , and found the man from whom the demons had departed , ( AH ) sitting at the ( AI ) feet of Jesus , clothed and in his ( AJ ) right mind . And they were afraid .
NKJV	Luke	8	36	They also who had seen it told them by what means he who had been demon-possessed was [ m ] healed .
NKJV	Luke	8	37	( AK ) Then the whole multitude of the surrounding region of the [ n ] Gadarenes ( AL ) asked Him to ( AM ) depart from them , for they were seized with great ( AN ) fear . And He got into the boat and returned .
NKJV	Luke	8	38	Now ( AO ) the man from whom the demons had departed begged Him that he might be with Him . But Jesus sent him away , saying ,
NKJV	Luke	8	39	“ Return to your own house , and tell what great things God has done for you. ” And he went his way and proclaimed throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done for him . A Girl Restored to Life and a Woman Healed
NKJV	Luke	8	40	So it was , when Jesus returned , that the multitude welcomed Him , for they were all waiting for Him .
NKJV	Luke	8	41	( AP ) And behold , there came a man named Jairus , and he was a ruler of the synagogue . And he fell down at Jesus ’ feet and begged Him to come to his house ,
NKJV	Luke	8	42	for he had an only daughter about twelve years of age , and she ( AQ ) was dying . But as He went , the multitudes thronged Him .
NKJV	Luke	8	43	( AR ) Now a woman , having a ( AS ) flow of blood for twelve years , who had spent all her livelihood on physicians and could not be healed by any ,
NKJV	Luke	8	44	came from behind and ( AT ) touched the border of His garment . And immediately her flow of blood stopped .

NKJV	Luke	8	47	Now when the woman saw that she was not hidden , she came trembling ; and falling down before Him , she declared to Him in the presence of all the people the reason she had touched Him and how she was healed immediately .
NKJV	Luke	8	48	And He said to her , “ Daughter , [ q ] be of good cheer ; ( AV ) your faith has made you well . ( AW ) Go in peace. ”
NKJV	Luke	8	49	( AX ) While He was still speaking , someone came from the ruler of the synagogue ’ s house , saying to him , “ Your daughter is dead . Do not trouble the [ r ] Teacher. ”

NKJV	Luke	8	51	When He came into the house , He permitted no one to go [ s ] in except [ t ] Peter , James , and John , and the father and mother of the girl .
NKJV	Luke	8	52	Now all wept and mourned for her ; but He said , ( AZ ) “ Do not weep ; she is not dead , ( BA ) but sleeping. ”
NKJV	Luke	8	53	And they ridiculed Him , knowing that she was dead .
NKJV	Luke	8	54	But He [ u ] put them all outside , took her by the hand and called , saying , “ Little girl , ( BB ) arise. ”

NKJV	Luke	9	2	( D ) He sent them to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick .

NKJV	Luke	9	4	( F ) “ Whatever house you enter , stay there , and from there depart .
NKJV	Luke	9	5	( G ) And whoever will not receive you , when you go out of that city , ( H ) shake off the very dust from your feet as a testimony against them. ”
NKJV	Luke	9	6	( I ) So they departed and went through the towns , preaching the gospel and healing everywhere . Herod Seeks to See Jesus ( J )
NKJV	Luke	9	7	( K ) Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by Him ; and he was perplexed , because it was said by some that John had risen from the dead ,
NKJV	Luke	9	8	and by some that Elijah had appeared , and by others that one of the old prophets had risen again .
NKJV	Luke	9	10	( N ) And the apostles , when they had returned , told Him all that they had done . ( O ) Then He took them and went aside privately into a deserted place belonging to the city called Bethsaida .
NKJV	Luke	9	11	But when the multitudes knew it , they followed Him ; and He received them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God , and healed those who had need of healing .
NKJV	Luke	9	12	( P ) When the day began to wear away , the twelve came and said to Him , “ Send the multitude away , that they may go into the surrounding towns and country , and lodge and get provisions ; for we are in a deserted place here. ”
NKJV	Luke	9	13	But He said to them , “ You give them something to eat. ” And they said , “ We have no more than five loaves and two fish , unless we go and buy food for all these people. ”
NKJV	Luke	9	14	For there were about five thousand men . Then He said to His disciples , “ Make them sit down in groups of fifty. ”
NKJV	Luke	9	15	And they did so , and made them all sit down .
NKJV	Luke	9	16	Then He took the five loaves and the two fish , and looking up to heaven , He ( Q ) blessed and broke them , and gave them to the disciples to set before the multitude .
NKJV	Luke	9	17	So they all ate and were [ a ] filled , and twelve baskets of the leftover fragments were taken up by them . Peter Confesses Jesus as the Christ ( R )
NKJV	Luke	9	18	( S ) And it happened , as He was alone praying , that His disciples joined Him , and He asked them , saying , “ Who do the crowds say that I am ? ”
NKJV	Luke	9	19	So they answered and said , ( T ) “ John the Baptist , but some say Elijah ; and others say that one of the old prophets has risen again. ”
NKJV	Luke	9	20	He said to them , “ But who do you say that I am ? ” ( U ) Peter answered and said , “ The Christ of God. ” Jesus Predicts His Death and Resurrection ( V )
NKJV	Luke	9	21	( W ) And He strictly warned and commanded them to tell this to no one ,

NKJV	Luke	9	23	( Z ) Then He said to them all , “ If anyone desires to come after Me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross [ b ] daily , and follow Me .
NKJV	Luke	9	24	( AA ) For whoever desires to save his life will lose it , but whoever loses his life for My sake will save it .
NKJV	Luke	9	25	( AB ) For what profit is it to a man if he gains the whole world , and is himself destroyed or lost ?
NKJV	Luke	9	26	( AC ) For whoever is ashamed of Me and My words , of him the Son of Man will be ( AD ) ashamed when He comes in His own glory , and in His Father ’ s , and of the holy angels .
NKJV	Luke	9	27	( AE ) But I tell you truly , there are some standing here who shall not taste death till they see the kingdom of God. ” Jesus Transfigured on the Mount ( AF )
NKJV	Luke	9	28	( AG ) Now it came to pass , about eight days after these sayings , that He took Peter , John , and James and went up on the mountain to pray .
NKJV	Luke	9	29	As He prayed , the appearance of His face was altered , and His robe became white and glistening .
NKJV	Luke	9	30	And behold , two men talked with Him , who were ( AH ) Moses and ( AI ) Elijah ,
NKJV	Luke	9	31	who appeared in glory and spoke of His [ c ] decease which He was about to accomplish at Jerusalem .
NKJV	Luke	9	32	But Peter and those with him ( AJ ) were heavy with sleep ; and when they were fully awake , they saw His glory and the two men who stood with Him .
NKJV	Luke	9	33	Then it happened , as they were parting from Him , that Peter said to Jesus , “ Master , it is good for us to be here ; and let us make three [ d ] tabernacles : one for You , one for Moses , and one for Elijah ” —not knowing what he said .
NKJV	Luke	9	34	While he was saying this , a cloud came and overshadowed them ; and they were fearful as they entered the ( AK ) cloud .
NKJV	Luke	9	35	And a voice came out of the cloud , saying , ( AL ) “ This is [ e ] My beloved Son . ( AM ) Hear Him ! ”
NKJV	Luke	9	36	When the voice had ceased , Jesus was found alone . ( AN ) But they kept quiet , and told no one in those days any of the things they had seen . A Boy Is Healed ( AO )
NKJV	Luke	9	37	( AP ) Now it happened on the next day , when they had come down from the mountain , that a great multitude met Him .
NKJV	Luke	9	38	Suddenly a man from the multitude cried out , saying , “ Teacher , I implore You , look on my son , for he is my only child .
NKJV	Luke	9	39	And behold , a spirit seizes him , and he suddenly cries out ; it convulses him so that he foams at the mouth ; and it departs from him with great difficulty , bruising him .
NKJV	Luke	9	40	So I implored Your disciples to cast it out , but they could not. ”
NKJV	Luke	9	41	Then Jesus answered and said , “ O [ f ] faithless and perverse generation , how long shall I be with you and [ g ] bear with you ? Bring your son here. ”
NKJV	Luke	9	42	And as he was still coming , the demon threw him down and convulsed him . Then Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit , healed the child , and gave him back to his father . Jesus Again Predicts His Death ( AQ )
NKJV	Luke	9	43	And they were all amazed at the majesty of God . But while everyone marveled at all the things which Jesus did , He said to His disciples ,
NKJV	Luke	9	44	( AR ) “ Let these words sink down into your ears , for the Son of Man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men. ”
NKJV	Luke	9	45	( AS ) But they did not understand this saying , and it was hidden from them so that they did not perceive it ; and they were afraid to ask Him about this saying . Who Is the Greatest ? ( AT )
NKJV	Luke	9	46	( AU ) Then a dispute arose among them as to which of them would be greatest .
NKJV	Luke	9	47	And Jesus , ( AV ) perceiving the thought of their heart , took a ( AW ) little child and set him by Him ,
NKJV	Luke	9	48	and said to them , ( AX ) “ Whoever receives this little child in My name receives Me ; and ( AY ) whoever receives Me ( AZ ) receives Him who sent Me . ( BA ) For he who is least among you all will be great. ” Jesus Forbids Sectarianism ( BB )
NKJV	Luke	9	49	( BC ) Now John answered and said , “ Master , we saw someone casting out demons in Your name , and we forbade him because he does not follow with us. ”
NKJV	Luke	9	50	But Jesus said to him , “ Do not forbid him , for ( BD ) he who is not against [ h ] us is on [ i ] our side. ” A Samaritan Village Rejects the Savior
NKJV	Luke	9	51	Now it came to pass , when the time had come for ( BE ) Him to be received up , that He steadfastly set His face to go to Jerusalem ,
NKJV	Luke	9	52	and sent messengers before His face . And as they went , they entered a village of the Samaritans , to prepare for Him .
NKJV	Luke	9	53	But ( BF ) they did not receive Him , because His face was set for the journey to Jerusalem .
NKJV	Luke	9	54	And when His disciples ( BG ) James and John saw this , they said , “ Lord , do You want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them , [ j ] just as ( BH ) Elijah did ? ”

NKJV	Luke	9	57	( BL ) Now it happened as they journeyed on the road , that someone said to Him , “ Lord , I will follow You wherever You go. ”
NKJV	Luke	9	58	And Jesus said to him , “ Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests , but the Son of Man ( BM ) has nowhere to lay His head. ”
NKJV	Luke	9	59	( BN ) Then He said to another , “ Follow Me. ” But he said , “ Lord , let me first go and bury my father. ”
NKJV	Luke	9	60	Jesus said to him , “ Let the dead bury their own dead , but you go and preach the kingdom of God. ”
NKJV	Luke	9	61	And another also said , “ Lord , ( BO ) I will follow You , but let me first go and bid them farewell who are at my house. ”

NKJV	Luke	10	19	Behold , ( Z ) I give you the authority to trample on serpents and scorpions , and over all the power of the enemy , and nothing shall by any means hurt you .
NKJV	Luke	10	20	Nevertheless do not rejoice in this , that the spirits are subject to you , but [ f ] rather rejoice because ( AA ) your names are written in heaven. ” Jesus Rejoices in the Spirit ( AB )
NKJV	Luke	10	21	( AC ) In that hour Jesus rejoiced in the Spirit and said , “ I thank You , Father , Lord of heaven and earth , that You have hidden these things from the wise and prudent and revealed them to babes . Even so , Father , for so it seemed good in Your sight .

NKJV	Luke	10	23	Then He turned to His disciples and said privately , ( AF ) “ Blessed are the eyes which see the things you see ;

NKJV	Luke	10	25	And behold , a certain [ h ] lawyer stood up and tested Him , saying , ( AI ) “ Teacher , what shall I do to inherit eternal life ? ”
NKJV	Luke	10	26	He said to him , “ What is written in the law ? What is your reading of it ? ”
NKJV	Luke	10	27	So he answered and said , ( AJ ) “ ‘ You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart , with all your soul , with all your strength , and with all your mind , ’ and ( AK ) ‘ your neighbor as yourself. ’ ”
NKJV	Luke	10	28	And He said to him , “ You have answered rightly ; do this and ( AL ) you will live. ”
NKJV	Luke	10	29	But he , wanting to ( AM ) justify himself , said to Jesus , “ And who is my neighbor ? ”
NKJV	Luke	10	30	Then Jesus answered and said : “ A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho , and fell among [ i ] thieves , who stripped him of his clothing , wounded him , and departed , leaving him half dead .
NKJV	Luke	10	31	Now by chance a certain priest came down that road . And when he saw him , ( AN ) he passed by on the other side .
NKJV	Luke	10	32	Likewise a Levite , when he arrived at the place , came and looked , and passed by on the other side .
NKJV	Luke	10	33	But a certain ( AO ) Samaritan , as he journeyed , came where he was . And when he saw him , he had ( AP ) compassion .
NKJV	Luke	10	34	So he went to him and bandaged his wounds , pouring on oil and wine ; and he set him on his own animal , brought him to an inn , and took care of him .
NKJV	Luke	10	35	On the next day , [ j ] when he departed , he took out two ( AQ ) denarii , gave them to the innkeeper , and said to him , ‘ Take care of him ; and whatever more you spend , when I come again , I will repay you. ’
NKJV	Luke	10	36	So which of these three do you think was neighbor to him who fell among the thieves ? ”
NKJV	Luke	10	37	And he said , “ He who showed mercy on him. ” Then Jesus said to him , ( AR ) “ Go and do likewise. ” Mary and Martha Worship and Serve
NKJV	Luke	10	38	Now it happened as they went that He entered a certain village ; and a certain woman named ( AS ) Martha welcomed Him into her house .
NKJV	Luke	10	39	And she had a sister called Mary , ( AT ) who also ( AU ) sat at [ k ] Jesus ’ feet and heard His word .
NKJV	Luke	10	40	But Martha was distracted with much serving , and she approached Him and said , “ Lord , do You not care that my sister has left me to serve alone ? Therefore tell her to help me. ”
NKJV	Luke	10	41	And [ l ] Jesus answered and said to her , “ Martha , Martha , you are worried and troubled about many things .

NKJV	Luke	11	5	And He said to them , “ Which of you shall have a friend , and go to him at midnight and say to him , ‘ Friend , lend me three loaves ;
NKJV	Luke	11	6	for a friend of mine has come to me on his journey , and I have nothing to set before him ’ ;
NKJV	Luke	11	7	and he will answer from within and say , ‘ Do not trouble me ; the door is now shut , and my children are with me in bed ; I can not rise and give to you ’ ?

NKJV	Luke	11	9	( F ) “ So I say to you , ask , and it will be given to you ; ( G ) seek , and you will find ; knock , and it will be opened to you .
NKJV	Luke	11	10	For everyone who asks receives , and he who seeks finds , and to him who knocks it will be opened .

NKJV	Luke	11	14	( K ) And He was casting out a demon , and it was mute . So it was , when the demon had gone out , that the mute spoke ; and the multitudes marveled .
NKJV	Luke	11	15	But some of them said , ( L ) “ He casts out demons by [ f ] Beelzebub , the ruler of the demons. ”
NKJV	Luke	11	16	Others , testing Him , ( M ) sought from Him a sign from heaven .
NKJV	Luke	11	17	( N ) But ( O ) He , knowing their thoughts , said to them : “ Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation , and a house divided against a house falls .
NKJV	Luke	11	18	If Satan also is divided against himself , how will his kingdom stand ? Because you say I cast out demons by Beelzebub .
NKJV	Luke	11	19	And if I cast out demons by Beelzebub , by whom do your sons cast them out ? Therefore they will be your judges .
NKJV	Luke	11	20	But if I cast out demons ( P ) with the finger of God , surely the kingdom of God has come upon you .
NKJV	Luke	11	21	( Q ) When a strong man , fully armed , guards his own palace , his goods are in peace .
NKJV	Luke	11	22	But ( R ) when a stronger than he comes upon him and overcomes him , he takes from him all his armor in which he trusted , and divides his [ g ] spoils .
NKJV	Luke	11	23	( S ) He who is not with Me is against Me , and he who does not gather with Me scatters . An Unclean Spirit Returns ( T )
NKJV	Luke	11	24	( U ) “ When an unclean spirit goes out of a man , he goes through dry places , seeking rest ; and finding none , he says , ‘ I will return to my house from which I came. ’
NKJV	Luke	11	25	And when he comes , he finds it swept and put in order .
NKJV	Luke	11	26	Then he goes and takes with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself , and they enter and dwell there ; and ( V ) the last state of that man is worse than the first. ” Keeping the Word
NKJV	Luke	11	27	And it happened , as He spoke these things , that a certain woman from the crowd raised her voice and said to Him , ( W ) “ Blessed is the womb that bore You , and the breasts which nursed You ! ”
NKJV	Luke	11	28	But He said , ( X ) “ More than that , blessed are those who hear the word of God and keep it ! ” Seeking a Sign ( Y )
NKJV	Luke	11	29	( Z ) And while the crowds were thickly gathered together , He began to say , “ This is an evil generation . It seeks a ( AA ) sign , and no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah [ h ] the prophet .
NKJV	Luke	11	30	For as ( AB ) Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites , so also the Son of Man will be to this generation .
NKJV	Luke	11	31	( AC ) The queen of the South will rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them , for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon ; and indeed a ( AD ) greater than Solomon is here .
NKJV	Luke	11	32	The men of Nineveh will rise up in the judgment with this generation and condemn it , for ( AE ) they repented at the preaching of Jonah ; and indeed a greater than Jonah is here . The Lamp of the Body ( AF )
NKJV	Luke	11	33	( AG ) “ No one , when he has lit a lamp , puts it in a secret place or under a ( AH ) basket , but on a lampstand , that those who come in may see the light .
NKJV	Luke	11	34	( AI ) The lamp of the body is the eye . Therefore , when your eye is [ i ] good , your whole body also is full of light . But when your eye is [ j ] bad , your body also is full of darkness .
NKJV	Luke	11	35	Therefore take heed that the light which is in you is not darkness .
NKJV	Luke	11	36	If then your whole body is full of light , having no part dark , the whole body will be full of light , as when the bright shining of a lamp gives you light. ” Woe to the Pharisees and Lawyers
NKJV	Luke	11	37	And as He spoke , a certain Pharisee asked Him to dine with him . So He went in and sat down to eat .
NKJV	Luke	11	38	( AJ ) When the Pharisee saw it , he marveled that He had not first washed before dinner .
NKJV	Luke	11	39	( AK ) Then the Lord said to him , “ Now you Pharisees make the outside of the cup and dish clean , but ( AL ) your inward part is full of [ k ] greed and wickedness .
NKJV	Luke	11	40	Foolish ones ! Did not ( AM ) He who made the outside make the inside also ?
NKJV	Luke	11	41	( AN ) But rather give alms of [ l ] such things as you have ; then indeed all things are clean to you .
NKJV	Luke	11	42	( AO ) “ But woe to you Pharisees ! For you tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs , and ( AP ) pass by justice and the ( AQ ) love of God . These you ought to have done , without leaving the others undone .
NKJV	Luke	11	43	( AR ) Woe to you Pharisees ! For you love the [ m ] best seats in the synagogues and greetings in the marketplaces .
NKJV	Luke	11	44	( AS ) Woe to you , [ n ] scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! ( AT ) For you are like graves which are not seen , and the men who walk over them are not aware of them. ”
NKJV	Luke	11	45	Then one of the lawyers answered and said to Him , “ Teacher , by saying these things You reproach us also. ”
NKJV	Luke	11	46	And He said , “ Woe to you also , lawyers ! ( AU ) For you load men with burdens hard to bear , and you yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers .
NKJV	Luke	11	47	( AV ) Woe to you ! For you build the tombs of the prophets , and your fathers killed them .
NKJV	Luke	11	48	In fact , you bear witness that you approve the deeds of your fathers ; for they indeed killed them , and you build their tombs .
NKJV	Luke	11	49	Therefore the wisdom of God also said , ( AW ) ‘ I will send them prophets and apostles , and some of them they will kill and persecute , ’
NKJV	Luke	11	50	that the blood of all the prophets which was shed from the foundation of the world may be required of this generation ,
NKJV	Luke	11	51	( AX ) from the blood of Abel to ( AY ) the blood of Zechariah who perished between the altar and the temple . Yes , I say to you , it shall be required of this generation .
NKJV	Luke	11	52	( AZ ) “ Woe to you lawyers ! For you have taken away the key of knowledge . You did not enter in yourselves , and those who were entering in you hindered. ”
NKJV	Luke	11	53	[ o ] And as He said these things to them , the scribes and the Pharisees began to assail Him vehemently , and to cross-examine Him about many things ,
NKJV	Luke	11	54	lying in wait for Him , [ p ] and ( BA ) seeking to catch Him in something He might say , [ q ] that they might accuse Him . Footnotes - Luke 11:2 NU omits Our - Luke 11:2 NU omits in heaven - Luke 11:2 NU omits the rest of v.

NKJV	Luke	12	2	( D ) For there is nothing covered that will not be revealed , nor hidden that will not be known .
NKJV	Luke	12	3	Therefore whatever you have spoken in the dark will be heard in the light , and what you have spoken in the ear in inner rooms will be proclaimed on the housetops . Jesus Teaches the Fear of God ( E )
NKJV	Luke	12	4	( F ) “ And I say to you , ( G ) My friends , do not be afraid of those who kill the body , and after that have no more that they can do .
NKJV	Luke	12	5	But I will show you whom you should fear : Fear Him who , after He has killed , has power to cast into hell ; yes , I say to you , ( H ) fear Him !
NKJV	Luke	12	6	“ Are not five sparrows sold for two [ b ] copper coins ? And ( I ) not one of them is forgotten before God .
NKJV	Luke	12	7	But the very hairs of your head are all numbered . Do not fear therefore ; you are of more value than many sparrows . Confess Christ Before Men ( J )
NKJV	Luke	12	8	( K ) “ Also I say to you , whoever confesses Me ( L ) before men , him the Son of Man also will confess before the angels of God .
NKJV	Luke	12	9	But he who ( M ) denies Me before men will be denied before the angels of God .
NKJV	Luke	12	10	“ And ( N ) anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man , it will be forgiven him ; but to him who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit , it will not be forgiven .
NKJV	Luke	12	11	( O ) “ Now when they bring you to the synagogues and magistrates and authorities , do not worry about how or what you should answer , or what you should say .
NKJV	Luke	12	13	Then one from the crowd said to Him , “ Teacher , tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me. ”
NKJV	Luke	12	14	But He said to him , ( Q ) “ Man , who made Me a judge or an arbitrator over you ? ”
NKJV	Luke	12	15	And He said to them , ( R ) “ Take heed and beware of [ c ] covetousness , for one ’ s life does not consist in the abundance of the things he possesses. ”
NKJV	Luke	12	16	Then He spoke a parable to them , saying : “ The ground of a certain rich man yielded plentifully .
NKJV	Luke	12	17	And he thought within himself , saying , ‘ What shall I do , since I have no room to store my crops ? ’
NKJV	Luke	12	18	So he said , ‘ I will do this : I will pull down my barns and build greater , and there I will store all my crops and my goods .
NKJV	Luke	12	19	And I will say to my soul , ( S ) “ Soul , you have many goods laid up for many years ; take your ease ; ( T ) eat , drink , and be merry. ” ’
NKJV	Luke	12	20	But God said to him , ‘ Fool ! This night ( U ) your soul will be required of you ; ( V ) then whose will those things be which you have provided ? ’
NKJV	Luke	12	21	“ So is he who lays up treasure for himself , ( W ) and is not rich toward God. ” Do Not Worry ( X )
NKJV	Luke	12	22	Then He said to His disciples , “ Therefore I say to you , ( Y ) do not worry about your life , what you will eat ; nor about the body , what you will put on .
NKJV	Luke	12	23	Life is more than food , and the body is more than clothing .
NKJV	Luke	12	24	Consider the ravens , for they neither sow nor reap , which have neither storehouse nor barn ; and ( Z ) God feeds them . Of how much more value are you than the birds ?
NKJV	Luke	12	25	And which of you by worrying can add one cubit to his stature ?
NKJV	Luke	12	26	If you then are not able to do the least , why [ d ] are you anxious for the rest ?
NKJV	Luke	12	27	Consider the lilies , how they grow : they neither toil nor spin ; and yet I say to you , even ( AA ) Solomon in all his glory was not [ e ] arrayed like one of these .
NKJV	Luke	12	28	If then God so clothes the grass , which today is in the field and tomorrow is thrown into the oven , how much more will He clothe you , O you of ( AB ) little faith ?
NKJV	Luke	12	29	“ And do not seek what you should eat or what you should drink , nor have an anxious mind .
NKJV	Luke	12	30	For all these things the nations of the world seek after , and your Father ( AC ) knows that you need these things .
NKJV	Luke	12	31	( AD ) But seek [ f ] the kingdom of God , and all these things shall be added to you .
NKJV	Luke	12	32	“ Do not fear , little flock , for ( AE ) it is your Father ’ s good pleasure to give you the kingdom .
NKJV	Luke	12	33	( AF ) Sell what you have and give ( AG ) alms ; ( AH ) provide yourselves money bags which do not grow old , a treasure in the heavens that does not fail , where no thief approaches nor moth destroys .
NKJV	Luke	12	34	For where your treasure is , there your heart will be also . The Faithful Servant and the Evil Servant ( AI )
NKJV	Luke	12	35	( AJ ) “ Let your waist be girded and ( AK ) your lamps burning ;
NKJV	Luke	12	36	and you yourselves be like men who wait for their master , when he will return from the wedding , that when he comes and knocks they may open to him immediately .
NKJV	Luke	12	37	( AL ) Blessed are those servants whom the master , when he comes , will find watching . Assuredly , I say to you that he will gird himself and have them sit down to eat , and will come and serve them .
NKJV	Luke	12	38	And if he should come in the second watch , or come in the third watch , and find them so , blessed are those servants .
NKJV	Luke	12	39	( AM ) But know this , that if the master of the house had known what hour the thief would come , he would [ g ] have watched and not allowed his house to be broken into .
NKJV	Luke	12	40	( AN ) Therefore you also be ready , for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect. ”
NKJV	Luke	12	41	Then Peter said to Him , “ Lord , do You speak this parable only to us , or to all people ? ”
NKJV	Luke	12	42	And the Lord said , ( AO ) “ Who then is that faithful and wise steward , whom his master will make ruler over his household , to give them their portion of food [ h ] in due season ?
NKJV	Luke	12	43	Blessed is that servant whom his master will find so doing when he comes .
NKJV	Luke	12	44	( AP ) Truly , I say to you that he will make him ruler over all that he has .
NKJV	Luke	12	45	( AQ ) But if that servant says in his heart , ‘ My master is delaying his coming , ’ and begins to beat the male and female servants , and to eat and drink and be drunk ,
NKJV	Luke	12	46	the master of that servant will come on a ( AR ) day when he is not looking for him , and at an hour when he is not aware , and will cut him in two and appoint him his portion with the unbelievers .
NKJV	Luke	12	47	And ( AS ) that servant who ( AT ) knew his master ’ s will , and did not prepare himself or do according to his will , shall be beaten with many stripes .
NKJV	Luke	12	48	( AU ) But he who did not know , yet committed things deserving of stripes , shall be beaten with few . For everyone to whom much is given , from him much will be required ; and to whom much has been committed , of him they will ask the more . Christ Brings Division ( AV )
NKJV	Luke	12	49	( AW ) “ I came to send fire on the earth , and how I wish it were already kindled !
NKJV	Luke	12	50	But ( AX ) I have a baptism to be baptized with , and how distressed I am till it is ( AY ) accomplished !
NKJV	Luke	12	51	( AZ ) Do you suppose that I came to give peace on earth ? I tell you , not at all , ( BA ) but rather division .
NKJV	Luke	12	52	( BB ) For from now on five in one house will be divided : three against two , and two against three .
NKJV	Luke	12	53	( BC ) Father will be divided against son and son against father , mother against daughter and daughter against mother , mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. ” Discern the Time ( BD )
NKJV	Luke	12	54	Then He also said to the multitudes , ( BE ) “ Whenever you see a cloud rising out of the west , immediately you say , ‘ A shower is coming ’ ; and so it is .
NKJV	Luke	12	55	And when you see the ( BF ) south wind blow , you say , ‘ There will be hot weather ’ ; and there is .
NKJV	Luke	12	56	Hypocrites ! You can discern the face of the sky and of the earth , but how is it you do not discern ( BG ) this time ? Make Peace with Your Adversary
NKJV	Luke	12	57	“ Yes , and why , even of yourselves , do you not judge what is right ?
NKJV	Luke	12	58	( BH ) When you go with your adversary to the magistrate , make every effort ( BI ) along the way to settle with him , lest he drag you to the judge , the judge deliver you to the officer , and the officer throw you into prison .

NKJV	Luke	13	5	I tell you , no ; but unless you repent you will all likewise perish. ” The Parable of the Barren Fig Tree
NKJV	Luke	13	6	He also spoke this parable : ( A ) “ A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard , and he came seeking fruit on it and found none .
NKJV	Luke	13	7	Then he said to the keeper of his vineyard , ‘ Look , for three years I have come seeking fruit on this fig tree and find none . Cut it down ; why does it [ b ] use up the ground ? ’
NKJV	Luke	13	8	But he answered and said to him , ‘ Sir , let it alone this year also , until I dig around it and fertilize it .
NKJV	Luke	13	9	[ c ] And if it bears fruit , well . But if not , after that you can ( B ) cut it down. ’ ” A Spirit of Infirmity
NKJV	Luke	13	10	Now He was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath .
NKJV	Luke	13	11	And behold , there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years , and was bent over and could in no way [ d ] raise herself up .
NKJV	Luke	13	12	But when Jesus saw her , He called her to Him and said to her , “ Woman , you are loosed from your ( C ) infirmity. ”
NKJV	Luke	13	14	But the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation , because Jesus had ( E ) healed on the Sabbath ; and he said to the crowd , ( F ) “ There are six days on which men ought to work ; therefore come and be healed on them , and ( G ) not on the Sabbath day. ”
NKJV	Luke	13	15	The Lord then answered him and said , [ e ] “ Hypocrite ! ( H ) Does not each one of you on the Sabbath loose his ox or donkey from the stall , and lead it away to water it ?
NKJV	Luke	13	16	So ought not this woman , ( I ) being a daughter of Abraham , whom Satan has bound—think of it—for eighteen years , be loosed from this bond on the Sabbath ? ”
NKJV	Luke	13	17	And when He said these things , all His adversaries were put to shame ; and all the multitude rejoiced for all the glorious things that were ( J ) done by Him . The Parable of the Mustard Seed ( K )
NKJV	Luke	13	18	( L ) Then He said , “ What is the kingdom of God like ? And to what shall I compare it ?
NKJV	Luke	13	19	It is like a mustard seed , which a man took and put in his garden ; and it grew and became a [ f ] large tree , and the birds of the air nested in its branches. ” The Parable of the Leaven ( M )
NKJV	Luke	13	20	And again He said , “ To what shall I liken the kingdom of God ?
NKJV	Luke	13	21	It is like [ g ] leaven , which a woman took and hid in three ( N ) measures [ h ] of meal till it was all leavened. ” The Narrow Way ( O )
NKJV	Luke	13	22	( P ) And He went through the cities and villages , teaching , and journeying toward Jerusalem .
NKJV	Luke	13	23	Then one said to Him , “ Lord , are there ( Q ) few who are saved ? ” And He said to them ,
NKJV	Luke	13	24	( R ) “ Strive to enter through the narrow gate , for ( S ) many , I say to you , will seek to enter and will not be able .
NKJV	Luke	13	25	( T ) When once the Master of the house has risen up and ( U ) shut the door , and you begin to stand outside and knock at the door , saying , ( V ) ‘ Lord , Lord , open for us , ’ and He will answer and say to you , ( W ) ‘ I do not know you , where you are from , ’
NKJV	Luke	13	26	then you will begin to say , ‘ We ate and drank in Your presence , and You taught in our streets. ’
NKJV	Luke	13	27	( X ) But He will say , ‘ I tell you I do not know you , where you are from . ( Y ) Depart from Me , all you workers of iniquity. ’
NKJV	Luke	13	28	( Z ) There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth , ( AA ) when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God , and yourselves thrust out .
NKJV	Luke	13	29	They will come from the east and the west , from the north and the south , and sit down in the kingdom of God .
NKJV	Luke	13	30	( AB ) And indeed there are last who will be first , and there are first who will be last. ”
NKJV	Luke	13	31	[ i ] On that very day some Pharisees came , saying to Him , “ Get out and depart from here , for Herod wants to kill You. ”
NKJV	Luke	13	32	And He said to them , “ Go , tell that fox , ‘ Behold , I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow , and the third day ( AC ) I shall be [ j ] perfected. ’
NKJV	Luke	13	33	Nevertheless I must journey today , tomorrow , and the day following ; for it can not be that a prophet should perish outside of Jerusalem . Jesus Laments over Jerusalem ( AD )
NKJV	Luke	13	34	( AE ) “ O Jerusalem , Jerusalem , the one who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her ! How often I wanted to gather your children together , as a hen gathers her brood under her wings , but you were not willing !

NKJV	Luke	14	2	And behold , there was a certain man before Him who had dropsy .
NKJV	Luke	14	3	And Jesus , answering , spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees , saying , ( A ) “ Is it lawful to heal on the [ a ] Sabbath ? ”
NKJV	Luke	14	4	But they kept silent . And He took him and healed him , and let him go .
NKJV	Luke	14	5	Then He answered them , saying , ( B ) “ Which of you , having a [ b ] donkey or an ox that has fallen into a pit , will not immediately pull him out on the Sabbath day ? ”
NKJV	Luke	14	6	And they could not answer Him regarding these things . Take the Lowly Place
NKJV	Luke	14	7	So He told a parable to those who were invited , when He noted how they chose the best places , saying to them :
NKJV	Luke	14	8	“ When you are invited by anyone to a wedding feast , do not sit down in the best place , lest one more honorable than you be invited by him ;
NKJV	Luke	14	9	and he who invited you and him come and say to you , ‘ Give place to this man , ’ and then you begin with shame to take the lowest place .
NKJV	Luke	14	10	( C ) But when you are invited , go and sit down in the lowest place , so that when he who invited you comes he may say to you , ‘ Friend , go up higher. ’ Then you will have glory in the presence of those who sit at the table with you .
NKJV	Luke	14	11	( D ) For whoever exalts himself will be [ c ] humbled , and he who humbles himself will be exalted. ”
NKJV	Luke	14	12	Then He also said to him who invited Him , “ When you give a dinner or a supper , do not ask your friends , your brothers , your relatives , nor rich neighbors , lest they also invite you back , and you be repaid .
NKJV	Luke	14	13	But when you give a feast , invite ( E ) the poor , the [ d ] maimed , the lame , the blind .
NKJV	Luke	14	15	Now when one of those who sat at the table with Him heard these things , he said to Him , ( H ) “ Blessed is he who shall eat [ e ] bread in the kingdom of God ! ”
NKJV	Luke	14	16	( I ) Then He said to him , “ A certain man gave a great supper and invited many ,
NKJV	Luke	14	17	and ( J ) sent his servant at supper time to say to those who were invited , ‘ Come , for all things are now ready. ’
NKJV	Luke	14	18	But they all with one accord began to make excuses . The first said to him , ‘ I have bought a piece of ground , and I must go and see it . I ask you to have me excused. ’
NKJV	Luke	14	19	And another said , ‘ I have bought five yoke of oxen , and I am going to test them . I ask you to have me excused. ’
NKJV	Luke	14	20	Still another said , ‘ I have married a wife , and therefore I can not come. ’
NKJV	Luke	14	21	So that servant came and reported these things to his master . Then the master of the house , being angry , said to his servant , ‘ Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city , and bring in here the poor and the [ f ] maimed and the lame and the blind. ’
NKJV	Luke	14	22	And the servant said , ‘ Master , it is done as you commanded , and still there is room. ’
NKJV	Luke	14	23	Then the master said to the servant , ‘ Go out into the highways and hedges , and compel them to come in , that my house may be filled .
NKJV	Luke	14	24	For I say to you ( K ) that none of those men who were invited shall taste my supper. ’ ” Leaving All to Follow Christ ( L )
NKJV	Luke	14	25	Now great multitudes went with Him . And He turned and said to them ,
NKJV	Luke	14	26	( M ) “ If anyone comes to Me ( N ) and does not hate his father and mother , wife and children , brothers and sisters , ( O ) yes , and his own life also , he can not be My disciple .
NKJV	Luke	14	27	And ( P ) whoever does not bear his cross and come after Me can not be My disciple .
NKJV	Luke	14	28	For ( Q ) which of you , intending to build a tower , does not sit down first and count the cost , whether he has enough to finish it—
NKJV	Luke	14	29	lest , after he has laid the foundation , and is not able to finish , all who see it begin to mock him ,
NKJV	Luke	14	30	saying , ‘ This man began to build and was not able to finish ’ ?
NKJV	Luke	14	31	Or what king , going to make war against another king , does not sit down first and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand ?
NKJV	Luke	14	32	Or else , while the other is still a great way off , he sends a delegation and asks conditions of peace .
NKJV	Luke	14	33	So likewise , whoever of you ( R ) does not forsake all that he has can not be My disciple . Tasteless Salt Is Worthless ( S )
NKJV	Luke	14	34	( T ) “ Salt is good ; but if the salt has lost its flavor , how shall it be seasoned ?

NKJV	Luke	15	15	Then he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country , and he sent him into his fields to feed swine .
NKJV	Luke	15	2	And the Pharisees and scribes complained , saying , “ This Man [ a ] receives sinners ( C ) and eats with them. ”
NKJV	Luke	15	3	So He spoke this parable to them , saying :
NKJV	Luke	15	4	( D ) “ What man of you , having a hundred sheep , if he loses one of them , does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness , and go after the one which is lost until he finds it ?
NKJV	Luke	15	5	And when he has found it , he lays it on his shoulders , rejoicing .
NKJV	Luke	15	6	And when he comes home , he calls together his friends and neighbors , saying to them , ( E ) ‘ Rejoice with me , for I have found my sheep ( F ) which was lost ! ’
NKJV	Luke	15	7	I say to you that likewise there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents ( G ) than over ninety-nine [ b ] just persons who ( H ) need no repentance . The Parable of the Lost Coin
NKJV	Luke	15	8	“ Or what woman , having ten silver [ c ] coins , if she loses one coin , does not light a lamp , sweep the house , and search carefully until she finds it ?
NKJV	Luke	15	9	And when she has found it , she calls her friends and neighbors together , saying , ‘ Rejoice with me , for I have found the piece which I lost ! ’
NKJV	Luke	15	10	Likewise , I say to you , there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents. ” The Parable of the Lost Son
NKJV	Luke	15	11	Then He said : “ A certain man had two sons .
NKJV	Luke	15	12	And the younger of them said to his father , ‘ Father , give me the portion of goods that falls to me. ’ So he divided to them ( I ) his livelihood .
NKJV	Luke	15	13	And not many days after , the younger son gathered all together , journeyed to a far country , and there wasted his possessions with [ d ] prodigal living .
NKJV	Luke	15	14	But when he had spent all , there arose a severe famine in that land , and he began to be in want .
NKJV	Luke	15	16	And he would gladly have filled his stomach with the [ e ] pods that the swine ate , and no one gave him anything .
NKJV	Luke	15	17	“ But when he came to himself , he said , ‘ How many of my father ’ s hired servants have bread enough and to spare , and I perish with hunger !
NKJV	Luke	15	18	I will arise and go to my father , and will say to him , “ Father , ( J ) I have sinned against heaven and before you ,
NKJV	Luke	15	19	and I am no longer worthy to be called your son . Make me like one of your hired servants. ” ’
NKJV	Luke	15	20	“ And he arose and came to his father . But ( K ) when he was still a great way off , his father saw him and had compassion , and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him .
NKJV	Luke	15	21	And the son said to him , ‘ Father , I have sinned against heaven ( L ) and in your sight , and am no longer worthy to be called your son. ’
NKJV	Luke	15	22	“ But the father said to his servants , [ f ] ‘ Bring out the best robe and put it on him , and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet .
NKJV	Luke	15	23	And bring the fatted calf here and kill it , and let us eat and be merry ;
NKJV	Luke	15	24	( M ) for this my son was dead and is alive again ; he was lost and is found. ’ And they began to be merry .
NKJV	Luke	15	25	“ Now his older son was in the field . And as he came and drew near to the house , he heard music and dancing .
NKJV	Luke	15	26	So he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant .

NKJV	Luke	15	28	“ But he was angry and would not go in . Therefore his father came out and pleaded with him .
NKJV	Luke	15	29	So he answered and said to his father , ‘ Lo , these many years I have been serving you ; I never transgressed your commandment at any time ; and yet you never gave me a young goat , that I might make merry with my friends .
NKJV	Luke	15	30	But as soon as this son of yours came , who has devoured your livelihood with harlots , you killed the fatted calf for him. ’
NKJV	Luke	15	31	“ And he said to him , ‘ Son , you are always with me , and all that I have is yours .
NKJV	Luke	15	32	It was right that we should make merry and be glad , ( N ) for your brother was dead and is alive again , and was lost and is found. ’ ” Footnotes - Luke 15:2 welcomes - Luke 15:7 upright - Luke 15:8 Gr . drachma , a valuable coin often worn in a ten-piece garland by married women - Luke 15:13 wasteful - Luke 15:16 carob pods - Luke 15:22 NU Quickly bring Scripture taken from the New King James Version® .

NKJV	Luke	16	16	( L ) “ The law and the prophets were until John . Since that time the kingdom of God has been preached , and everyone is pressing into it .
NKJV	Luke	16	2	So he called him and said to him , ‘ What is this I hear about you ? Give an ( A ) account of your stewardship , for you can no longer be steward. ’
NKJV	Luke	16	3	“ Then the steward said within himself , ‘ What shall I do ? For my master is taking the stewardship away from me . I can not dig ; I am ashamed to beg .
NKJV	Luke	16	4	I have resolved what to do , that when I am put out of the stewardship , they may receive me into their houses. ’
NKJV	Luke	16	5	“ So he called every one of his master ’ s debtors to him , and said to the first , ‘ How much do you owe my master ? ’
NKJV	Luke	16	6	And he said , ‘ A hundred [ b ] measures of oil. ’ So he said to him , ‘ Take your bill , and sit down quickly and write fifty. ’
NKJV	Luke	16	7	Then he said to another , ‘ And how much do you owe ? ’ So he said , ‘ A hundred [ c ] measures of wheat. ’ And he said to him , ‘ Take your bill , and write eighty. ’

NKJV	Luke	16	13	( F ) “ No servant can serve two masters ; for either he will hate the one and love the other , or else he will be loyal to the one and despise the other . You can not serve God and mammon. ” The Law , the Prophets , and the Kingdom
NKJV	Luke	16	14	Now the Pharisees , ( G ) who were lovers of money , also heard all these things , and they [ f ] derided Him .
NKJV	Luke	16	15	And He said to them , “ You are those who ( H ) justify yourselves ( I ) before men , but ( J ) God knows your hearts . For ( K ) what is highly esteemed among men is an abomination in the sight of God .
NKJV	Luke	16	17	( M ) And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one [ g ] tittle of the law to fail .
NKJV	Luke	16	18	( N ) “ Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery ; and whoever marries her who is divorced from her husband commits adultery . The Rich Man and Lazarus
NKJV	Luke	16	19	“ There was a certain rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and [ h ] fared sumptuously every day .
NKJV	Luke	16	20	But there was a certain beggar named Lazarus , full of sores , who was laid at his gate ,
NKJV	Luke	16	21	desiring to be fed with [ i ] the crumbs which fell from the rich man ’ s table . Moreover the dogs came and licked his sores .
NKJV	Luke	16	22	So it was that the beggar died , and was carried by the angels to ( O ) Abraham ’ s bosom . The rich man also died and was buried .
NKJV	Luke	16	23	And being in torments in Hades , he lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham afar off , and Lazarus in his bosom .
NKJV	Luke	16	24	“ Then he cried and said , ‘ Father Abraham , have mercy on me , and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and ( P ) cool my tongue ; for I ( Q ) am tormented in this flame. ’
NKJV	Luke	16	25	But Abraham said , ‘ Son , ( R ) remember that in your lifetime you received your good things , and likewise Lazarus evil things ; but now he is comforted and you are tormented .
NKJV	Luke	16	26	And besides all this , between us and you there is a great gulf fixed , so that those who want to pass from here to you can not , nor can those from there pass to us. ’
NKJV	Luke	16	27	“ Then he said , ‘ I beg you therefore , father , that you would send him to my father ’ s house ,
NKJV	Luke	16	28	for I have five brothers , that he may testify to them , lest they also come to this place of torment. ’
NKJV	Luke	16	29	Abraham said to him , ( S ) ‘ They have Moses and the prophets ; let them hear them. ’
NKJV	Luke	16	30	And he said , ‘ No , father Abraham ; but if one goes to them from the dead , they will repent. ’
NKJV	Luke	16	31	But he said to him , ( T ) ‘ If they do not hear Moses and the prophets , ( U ) neither will they be persuaded though one rise from the dead. ’ ” Footnotes - Luke 16:1 squandering - Luke 16:6 Gr . batos , same as Heb . bath ;

NKJV	Luke	17	17	So Jesus answered and said , “ Were there not ten cleansed ? But where are the nine ?
NKJV	Luke	17	2	It would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck , and he were thrown into the sea , than that he should [ b ] offend one of these little ones .
NKJV	Luke	17	3	Take heed to yourselves . ( D ) If your brother sins [ c ] against you , ( E ) rebuke him ; and if he repents , forgive him .
NKJV	Luke	17	4	And if he sins against you seven times in a day , and seven times in a day returns [ d ] to you , saying , ‘ I repent , ’ you shall forgive him. ” Faith and Duty ( F )
NKJV	Luke	17	5	And the apostles said to the Lord , “ Increase our faith. ”
NKJV	Luke	17	6	( G ) So the Lord said , “ If you have faith as a mustard seed , you can say to this mulberry tree , ‘ Be pulled up by the roots and be planted in the sea , ’ and it would obey you .
NKJV	Luke	17	7	And which of you , having a servant plowing or tending sheep , will say to him when he has come in from the field , ‘ Come at once and sit down to eat ’ ?
NKJV	Luke	17	8	But will he not rather say to him , ‘ Prepare something for my supper , and gird yourself ( H ) and serve me till I have eaten and drunk , and afterward you will eat and drink ’ ?

NKJV	Luke	17	11	Now it happened ( J ) as He went to Jerusalem that He passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee .
NKJV	Luke	17	12	Then as He entered a certain village , there met Him ten men who were lepers , ( K ) who stood afar off .
NKJV	Luke	17	13	And they lifted up their voices and said , “ Jesus , Master , have mercy on us ! ”
NKJV	Luke	17	14	So when He saw them , He said to them , ( L ) “ Go , show yourselves to the priests. ” And so it was that as they went , they were cleansed .
NKJV	Luke	17	15	And one of them , when he saw that he was healed , returned , and with a loud voice ( M ) glorified God ,
NKJV	Luke	17	16	and fell down on his face at His feet , giving Him thanks . And he was a ( N ) Samaritan .
NKJV	Luke	17	18	Were there not any found who returned to give glory to God except this foreigner ? ”
NKJV	Luke	17	19	( O ) And He said to him , “ Arise , go your way . Your faith has made you well. ” The Coming of the Kingdom ( P )
NKJV	Luke	17	20	Now when He was asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come , He answered them and said , “ The kingdom of God does not come with observation ;
NKJV	Luke	17	21	( Q ) nor will they say , [ f ] ‘ See here ! ’ or ‘ See there ! ’ For indeed , ( R ) the kingdom of God is [ g ] within you. ”
NKJV	Luke	17	22	Then He said to the disciples , ( S ) “ The days will come when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man , and you will not see it .
NKJV	Luke	17	23	( T ) And they will say to you , [ h ] ‘ Look here ! ’ or ‘ Look there ! ’ Do not go after them or follow them .
NKJV	Luke	17	24	( U ) For as the lightning that flashes out of one part under heaven shines to the other part under heaven , so also the Son of Man will be in His day .
NKJV	Luke	17	25	( V ) But first He must suffer many things and be ( W ) rejected by this generation .
NKJV	Luke	17	26	( X ) And as it ( Y ) was in the ( Z ) days of ( AA ) Noah , so it will be also in the days of the Son of Man :
NKJV	Luke	17	27	They ate , they drank , they married wives , they were given in marriage , until the ( AB ) day that Noah entered the ark , and the flood came and ( AC ) destroyed them all .
NKJV	Luke	17	28	( AD ) Likewise as it was also in the days of Lot : They ate , they drank , they bought , they sold , they planted , they built ;
NKJV	Luke	17	29	but on ( AE ) the day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all .
NKJV	Luke	17	30	Even so will it be in the day when the Son of Man ( AF ) is revealed .
NKJV	Luke	17	31	“ In that day , he ( AG ) who is on the housetop , and his [ i ] goods are in the house , let him not come down to take them away . And likewise the one who is in the field , let him not turn back .
NKJV	Luke	17	32	( AH ) Remember Lot ’ s wife .
NKJV	Luke	17	33	( AI ) Whoever seeks to save his life will lose it , and whoever loses his life will preserve it .
NKJV	Luke	17	34	( AJ ) I tell you , in that night there will be two [ j ] men in one bed : the one will be taken and the other will be left .

NKJV	Luke	18	18	( N ) Now a certain ruler asked Him , saying , “ Good Teacher , what shall I do to inherit eternal life ? ”
NKJV	Luke	18	2	saying : “ There was in a certain city a judge who did not fear God nor [ a ] regard man .
NKJV	Luke	18	3	Now there was a widow in that city ; and she came to him , saying , [ b ] ‘ Get justice for me from my adversary. ’
NKJV	Luke	18	4	And he would not for a while ; but afterward he said within himself , ‘ Though I do not fear God nor regard man ,
NKJV	Luke	18	5	( B ) yet because this widow troubles me I will [ c ] avenge her , lest by her continual coming she weary me. ’ ”
NKJV	Luke	18	6	Then the Lord said , “ Hear what the unjust judge said .
NKJV	Luke	18	7	And ( C ) shall God not avenge His own elect who cry out day and night to Him , though He bears long with them ?
NKJV	Luke	18	8	I tell you ( D ) that He will avenge them speedily . Nevertheless , when the Son of Man comes , will He really find faith on the earth ? ” The Parable of the Pharisee and the Tax Collector
NKJV	Luke	18	9	Also He spoke this parable to some ( E ) who trusted in themselves that they were righteous , and despised others :
NKJV	Luke	18	10	“ Two men went up to the temple to pray , one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector .
NKJV	Luke	18	11	The Pharisee ( F ) stood and prayed thus with himself , ( G ) ‘ God , I thank You that I am not like other men—extortioners , unjust , adulterers , or even as this tax collector .
NKJV	Luke	18	12	I fast twice a week ; I give tithes of all that I possess. ’
NKJV	Luke	18	13	And the tax collector , standing afar off , would not so much as raise his eyes to heaven , but beat his breast , saying , ‘ God , be merciful to me a sinner ! ’
NKJV	Luke	18	14	I tell you , this man went down to his house justified rather than the other ; ( H ) for everyone who exalts himself will be [ d ] humbled , and he who humbles himself will be exalted. ” Jesus Blesses Little Children ( I )
NKJV	Luke	18	15	( J ) Then they also brought infants to Him that He might touch them ; but when the disciples saw it , they rebuked them .
NKJV	Luke	18	16	But Jesus called them to Him and said , “ Let the little children come to Me , and do not forbid them ; for ( K ) of such is the kingdom of God .
NKJV	Luke	18	17	( L ) Assuredly , I say to you , whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will by no means enter it. ” Jesus Counsels the Rich Young Ruler ( M )
NKJV	Luke	18	19	So Jesus said to him , “ Why do you call Me good ? No one is good but ( O ) One , that is , God .
NKJV	Luke	18	20	You know the commandments : ( P ) ‘ Do not commit adultery , ’ ‘ Do not murder , ’ ‘ Do not steal , ’ ‘ Do not bear false witness , ’ ( Q ) ‘ Honor your father and your mother. ’ ”
NKJV	Luke	18	21	And he said , “ All ( R ) these things I have kept from my youth. ”
NKJV	Luke	18	22	So when Jesus heard these things , He said to him , “ You still lack one thing . ( S ) Sell all that you have and distribute to the poor , and you will have treasure in heaven ; and come , follow Me. ”
NKJV	Luke	18	23	But when he heard this , he became very sorrowful , for he was very rich . With God All Things Are Possible ( T )
NKJV	Luke	18	24	And when Jesus saw that he became very sorrowful , He said , ( U ) “ How hard it is for those who have riches to enter the kingdom of God !
NKJV	Luke	18	25	For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God. ”
NKJV	Luke	18	26	And those who heard it said , “ Who then can be saved ? ”
NKJV	Luke	18	27	But He said , ( V ) “ The things which are impossible with men are possible with God. ”
NKJV	Luke	18	28	( W ) Then Peter said , “ See , we have left [ e ] all and followed You. ”
NKJV	Luke	18	29	So He said to them , “ Assuredly , I say to you , ( X ) there is no one who has left house or parents or brothers or wife or children , for the sake of the kingdom of God ,
NKJV	Luke	18	30	( Y ) who shall not receive many times more in this present time , and in the age to come eternal life. ” Jesus a Third Time Predicts His Death and Resurrection ( Z )
NKJV	Luke	18	31	( AA ) Then He took the twelve aside and said to them , “ Behold , we are going up to Jerusalem , and all things ( AB ) that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of Man will be [ f ] accomplished .
NKJV	Luke	18	32	For ( AC ) He will be delivered to the Gentiles and will be mocked and insulted and spit upon .
NKJV	Luke	18	33	They will scourge Him and kill Him . And the third day He will rise again. ”
NKJV	Luke	18	34	( AD ) But they understood none of these things ; this saying was hidden from them , and they did not know the things which were spoken . A Blind Man Receives His Sight ( AE )
NKJV	Luke	18	35	( AF ) Then it happened , as He was coming near Jericho , that a certain blind man sat by the road begging .
NKJV	Luke	18	36	And hearing a multitude passing by , he asked what it meant .
NKJV	Luke	18	37	So they told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by .
NKJV	Luke	18	38	And he cried out , saying , “ Jesus , ( AG ) Son of David , have mercy on me ! ”
NKJV	Luke	18	39	Then those who went before warned him that he should be quiet ; but he cried out all the more , “ Son of David , have mercy on me ! ”
NKJV	Luke	18	40	So Jesus stood still and commanded him to be brought to Him . And when he had come near , He asked him ,
NKJV	Luke	18	41	saying , “ What do you want Me to do for you ? ” He said , “ Lord , that I may receive my sight. ”
NKJV	Luke	18	42	Then Jesus said to him , “ Receive your sight ; ( AH ) your faith has made you well. ”
NKJV	Luke	18	43	And immediately he received his sight , and followed Him , ( AI ) glorifying God . And all the people , when they saw it , gave praise to God .

NKJV	Luke	19	19	Likewise he said to him , ‘ You also be over five cities. ’
NKJV	Luke	19	2	Now behold , there was a man named Zacchaeus who was a chief tax collector , and he was rich .
NKJV	Luke	19	3	And he sought to ( B ) see who Jesus was , but could not because of the crowd , for he was of short stature .
NKJV	Luke	19	4	So he ran ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see Him , for He was going to pass that way .
NKJV	Luke	19	5	And when Jesus came to the place , He looked up [ a ] and saw him , and said to him , “ Zacchaeus , [ b ] make haste and come down , for today I must stay at your house. ”
NKJV	Luke	19	6	So he [ c ] made haste and came down , and received Him joyfully .
NKJV	Luke	19	7	But when they saw it , they all [ d ] complained , saying , ( C ) “ He has gone to be a guest with a man who is a sinner. ”
NKJV	Luke	19	8	Then Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord , “ Look , Lord , I give half of my goods to the ( D ) poor ; and if I have taken anything from anyone by ( E ) false accusation , ( F ) I restore fourfold. ”
NKJV	Luke	19	9	And Jesus said to him , “ Today salvation has come to this house , because ( G ) he also is ( H ) a son of Abraham ;
NKJV	Luke	19	10	( I ) for the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which was lost. ” The Parable of the Minas ( J )
NKJV	Luke	19	11	Now as they heard these things , He spoke another parable , because He was near Jerusalem and because ( K ) they thought the kingdom of God would appear immediately .
NKJV	Luke	19	12	( L ) Therefore He said : “ A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return .
NKJV	Luke	19	13	So he called ten of his servants , delivered to them ten [ e ] minas , and said to them , ‘ Do business till I come. ’
NKJV	Luke	19	14	( M ) But his citizens hated him , and sent a delegation after him , saying , ‘ We will not have this man to reign over us. ’
NKJV	Luke	19	15	“ And so it was that when he returned , having received the kingdom , he then commanded these servants , to whom he had given the money , to be called to him , that he might know how much every man had gained by trading .
NKJV	Luke	19	16	Then came the first , saying , ‘ Master , your mina has earned ten minas. ’
NKJV	Luke	19	17	And he said to him , ( N ) ‘ Well done , good servant ; because you were ( O ) faithful in a very little , have authority over ten cities. ’
NKJV	Luke	19	18	And the second came , saying , ‘ Master , your mina has earned five minas. ’
NKJV	Luke	19	20	“ Then another came , saying , ‘ Master , here is your mina , which I have kept put away in a handkerchief .
NKJV	Luke	19	21	( P ) For I feared you , because you are [ f ] an austere man . You collect what you did not deposit , and reap what you did not sow. ’
NKJV	Luke	19	22	And he said to him , ( Q ) ‘ Out of your own mouth I will judge you , you wicked servant . ( R ) You knew that I was an austere man , collecting what I did not deposit and reaping what I did not sow .
NKJV	Luke	19	23	Why then did you not put my money in the bank , that at my coming I might have collected it with interest ? ’
NKJV	Luke	19	24	“ And he said to those who stood by , ‘ Take the mina from him , and give it to him who has ten minas. ’
NKJV	Luke	19	25	( But they said to him , ‘ Master , he has ten minas. ’ )
NKJV	Luke	19	26	‘ For I say to you , ( S ) that to everyone who has will be given ; and from him who does not have , even what he has will be taken away from him .
NKJV	Luke	19	27	But bring here those enemies of mine , who did not want me to reign over them , and slay them before me. ’ ” The Triumphal Entry ( T )
NKJV	Luke	19	28	When He had said this , ( U ) He went on ahead , going up to Jerusalem .
NKJV	Luke	19	29	( V ) And it came to pass , when He drew near to [ g ] Bethphage and ( W ) Bethany , at the mountain called ( X ) Olivet , that He sent two of His disciples ,
NKJV	Luke	19	30	saying , “ Go into the village opposite you , where as you enter you will find a colt tied , on which no one has ever sat . Loose it and bring it here .
NKJV	Luke	19	31	And if anyone asks you , ‘ Why are you loosing it ? ’ thus you shall say to him , ‘ Because the Lord has need of it. ’ ”
NKJV	Luke	19	32	So those who were sent went their way and found it just ( Y ) as He had said to them .
NKJV	Luke	19	33	But as they were loosing the colt , the owners of it said to them , “ Why are you loosing the colt ? ”
NKJV	Luke	19	34	And they said , “ The Lord has need of him. ”
NKJV	Luke	19	35	Then they brought him to Jesus . ( Z ) And they threw their own clothes on the colt , and they set Jesus on him .
NKJV	Luke	19	36	And as He went , many spread their clothes on the road .
NKJV	Luke	19	37	Then , as He was now drawing near the descent of the Mount of Olives , the whole multitude of the disciples began to ( AA ) rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works they had seen ,
NKJV	Luke	19	38	saying : ( AB ) “ ‘ Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord ! ’ ( AC ) Peace in heaven and glory in the highest ! ”
NKJV	Luke	19	39	And some of the Pharisees called to Him from the crowd , “ Teacher , rebuke Your disciples. ”
NKJV	Luke	19	40	But He answered and said to them , “ I tell you that if these should keep silent , ( AD ) the stones would immediately cry out. ” Jesus Weeps over Jerusalem
NKJV	Luke	19	41	Now as He drew near , He saw the city and ( AE ) wept over it ,
NKJV	Luke	19	42	saying , “ If you had known , even you , especially in this ( AF ) your day , the things that ( AG ) make for your ( AH ) peace ! But now they are hidden from your eyes .
NKJV	Luke	19	43	For days will come upon you when your enemies will ( AI ) build an embankment around you , surround you and close you in on every side ,
NKJV	Luke	19	44	( AJ ) and level you , and your children within you , to the ground ; and ( AK ) they will not leave in you one stone upon another , ( AL ) because you did not know the time of your visitation. ” Jesus Cleanses the Temple ( AM )
NKJV	Luke	19	45	( AN ) Then He went into the temple and began to drive out those who [ h ] bought and sold in it ,
NKJV	Luke	19	46	saying to them , “ It is written , ( AO ) ‘ My house [ i ] is a house of prayer , ’ but you have made it a ( AP ) ‘ den of thieves. ’ ”
NKJV	Luke	19	47	And He ( AQ ) was teaching daily in the temple . But ( AR ) the chief priests , the scribes , and the leaders of the people sought to destroy Him ,
NKJV	Luke	19	48	and were unable to do anything ; for all the people were very attentive to ( AS ) hear Him .

NKJV	Luke	20	20	( R ) So they watched Him , and sent spies who pretended to be righteous , that they might seize on His words , in order to deliver Him to the power and the authority of the governor .
NKJV	Luke	20	2	and spoke to Him , saying , “ Tell us , ( C ) by what authority are You doing these things ? Or who is he who gave You this authority ? ”
NKJV	Luke	20	3	But He answered and said to them , “ I also will ask you one thing , and answer Me :
NKJV	Luke	20	4	The ( D ) baptism of John—was it from heaven or from men ? ”
NKJV	Luke	20	5	And they reasoned among themselves , saying , “ If we say , ‘ From heaven , ’ He will say , ‘ Why [ a ] then did you not believe him ? ’
NKJV	Luke	20	6	But if we say , ‘ From men , ’ all the people will stone us , ( E ) for they are persuaded that John was a prophet. ”
NKJV	Luke	20	7	So they answered that they did not know where it was from .
NKJV	Luke	20	8	And Jesus said to them , “ Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things. ” The Parable of the Wicked Vinedressers ( F )
NKJV	Luke	20	9	Then He began to tell the people this parable : ( G ) “ A certain man planted a vineyard , leased it to [ b ] vinedressers , and went into a far country for a long time .
NKJV	Luke	20	10	Now at [ c ] vintage-time he ( H ) sent a servant to the vinedressers , that they might give him some of the fruit of the vineyard . But the vinedressers beat him and sent him away empty-handed .
NKJV	Luke	20	11	Again he sent another servant ; and they beat him also , treated him shamefully , and sent him away empty-handed .
NKJV	Luke	20	12	And again he sent a third ; and they wounded him also and cast him out .
NKJV	Luke	20	13	“ Then the owner of the vineyard said , ‘ What shall I do ? I will send my beloved son . Probably they will respect him when they see him. ’
NKJV	Luke	20	14	But when the vinedressers saw him , they reasoned among themselves , saying , ‘ This is the ( I ) heir . Come , ( J ) let us kill him , that the inheritance may be ( K ) ours. ’
NKJV	Luke	20	15	So they cast him out of the vineyard and ( L ) killed him . Therefore what will the owner of the vineyard do to them ?
NKJV	Luke	20	16	He will come and destroy those vinedressers and give the vineyard to ( M ) others. ” And when they heard it they said , “ Certainly not ! ”
NKJV	Luke	20	17	Then He looked at them and said , “ What then is this that is written : ( N ) ‘ The stone which the builders rejected Has become the chief cornerstone ’ ?
NKJV	Luke	20	18	Whoever falls on that stone will be ( O ) broken ; but ( P ) on whomever it falls , it will grind him to powder. ”

NKJV	Luke	20	22	Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not ? ”

NKJV	Luke	20	24	Show Me a denarius . Whose image and inscription does it have ? ” They answered and said , “ Caesar ’ s. ”
NKJV	Luke	20	25	And He said to them , ( T ) “ Render [ f ] therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar ’ s , and to God the things that are God ’ s. ”

NKJV	Luke	20	27	( V ) Then some of the Sadducees , ( W ) who deny that there is a resurrection , came to Him and asked Him ,
NKJV	Luke	20	28	saying : “ Teacher , Moses wrote to us that if a man ’ s brother dies , having a wife , and he dies without children , his brother should take his wife and raise up offspring for his brother .

NKJV	Luke	20	34	Jesus answered and said to them , “ The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage .
NKJV	Luke	20	35	But those who are ( X ) counted worthy to attain that age , and the resurrection from the dead , neither marry nor are given in marriage ;
NKJV	Luke	20	36	nor can they die anymore , for ( Y ) they are equal to the angels and are sons of God , ( Z ) being sons of the resurrection .
NKJV	Luke	20	37	But even Moses showed in the burning bush passage that the dead are raised , when he called the Lord ( AA ) ‘ the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob. ’
NKJV	Luke	20	38	For He is not the God of the dead but of the living , for ( AB ) all live to Him. ”
NKJV	Luke	20	39	Then some of the scribes answered and said , “ Teacher , You have spoken well. ”
NKJV	Luke	20	40	But after that they dared not question Him anymore . Jesus : How Can David Call His Descendant Lord ? ( AC )
NKJV	Luke	20	41	And He said to them , ( AD ) “ How can they say that the Christ is the Son of David ?
NKJV	Luke	20	42	Now David himself said in the Book of Psalms : ( AE ) ‘ The Lord said to my Lord , “ Sit at My right hand ,
NKJV	Luke	20	43	Till I make Your enemies Your footstool. ” ’
NKJV	Luke	20	44	Therefore David calls Him ‘ Lord ’ ; ( AF ) how is He then his Son ? ” Beware of the Scribes ( AG )

NKJV	Luke	22	2	And ( C ) the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might kill Him , for they feared the people .
NKJV	Luke	22	3	( D ) Then Satan entered Judas , surnamed Iscariot , who was numbered among the ( E ) twelve .

NKJV	Luke	23	8	Now when Herod saw Jesus , ( L ) he was exceedingly glad ; for he had desired for a long time to see Him , because ( M ) he had heard many things about Him , and he hoped to see some miracle done by Him .

NKJV	Luke	23	27	And a great multitude of the people followed Him , and women who also mourned and lamented Him .
NKJV	Luke	23	28	But Jesus , turning to them , said , “ Daughters of Jerusalem , do not weep for Me , but weep for yourselves and for your children .

NKJV	Luke	23	43	And Jesus said to him , “ Assuredly , I say to you , today you will be with Me in ( AP ) Paradise. ” Jesus Dies on the Cross ( AQ )
NKJV	Luke	23	44	( AR ) Now it [ l ] was about the sixth hour , and there was darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour .
NKJV	Luke	23	45	Then the sun was [ m ] darkened , and ( AS ) the veil of the temple was torn in [ n ] two .
NKJV	Luke	23	46	And when Jesus had cried out with a loud voice , He said , “ Father , ( AT ) ‘ into Your hands I commit My spirit. ’ ” ( AU ) Having said this , He breathed His last .
NKJV	Luke	23	47	( AV ) So when the centurion saw what had happened , he glorified God , saying , “ Certainly this was a righteous Man ! ”
NKJV	Luke	23	48	And the whole crowd who came together to that sight , seeing what had been done , beat their breasts and returned .
NKJV	Luke	23	49	( AW ) But all His acquaintances , and the women who followed Him from Galilee , stood at a distance , watching these things . Jesus Buried in Joseph ’ s Tomb ( AX )
NKJV	Luke	23	50	( AY ) Now behold , there was a man named Joseph , a council member , a good and just man .
NKJV	Luke	23	51	He had not consented to their decision and deed . He was from Arimathea , a city of the Jews , ( AZ ) who [ o ] himself was also waiting for the kingdom of God .
NKJV	Luke	23	52	This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus .
NKJV	Luke	23	53	( BA ) Then he took it down , wrapped it in linen , and laid it in a tomb that was hewn out of the rock , where no one had ever lain before .
NKJV	Luke	23	54	That day was ( BB ) the Preparation , and the Sabbath drew near .
NKJV	Luke	23	55	And the women ( BC ) who had come with Him from Galilee followed after , and ( BD ) they observed the tomb and how His body was laid .
NKJV	Luke	23	56	Then they returned and ( BE ) prepared spices and fragrant oils . And they rested on the Sabbath ( BF ) according to the commandment . Footnotes - Luke 23:2 NU our - Luke 23:6 NU omits of Galilee - Luke 23:11 troops - Luke 23:15 NU he sent Him back to us - Luke 23:17 NU omits v.

NKJV	Luke	24	24	And ( X ) certain of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said ; but Him they did not see. ”
NKJV	Luke	24	2	( D ) But they found the stone rolled away from the tomb .
NKJV	Luke	24	3	( E ) Then they went in and did not find the body of the Lord Jesus .
NKJV	Luke	24	4	And it happened , as they were [ b ] greatly perplexed about this , that ( F ) behold , two men stood by them in shining garments .
NKJV	Luke	24	5	Then , as they were afraid and bowed their faces to the earth , they said to them , “ Why do you seek the living among the dead ?
NKJV	Luke	24	6	He is not here , but is risen ! ( G ) Remember how He spoke to you when He was still in Galilee ,
NKJV	Luke	24	7	saying , ‘ The Son of Man must be ( H ) delivered into the hands of sinful men , and be crucified , and the third day rise again. ’ ”
NKJV	Luke	24	8	And ( I ) they remembered His words .
NKJV	Luke	24	9	( J ) Then they returned from the tomb and told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest .
NKJV	Luke	24	10	It was Mary Magdalene , ( K ) Joanna , Mary the mother of James , and the other women with them , who told these things to the apostles .
NKJV	Luke	24	11	( L ) And their words seemed to them like [ c ] idle tales , and they did not believe them .
NKJV	Luke	24	12	( M ) But Peter arose and ran to the tomb ; and stooping down , he saw the linen cloths [ d ] lying by themselves ; and he departed , marveling to himself at what had happened . The Road to Emmaus ( N )
NKJV	Luke	24	13	( O ) Now behold , two of them were traveling that same day to a village called Emmaus , which was [ e ] seven miles from Jerusalem .
NKJV	Luke	24	14	And they talked together of all these things which had happened .
NKJV	Luke	24	15	So it was , while they conversed and reasoned , that ( P ) Jesus Himself drew near and went with them .
NKJV	Luke	24	16	But ( Q ) their eyes were restrained , so that they did not know Him .
NKJV	Luke	24	17	And He said to them , “ What kind of conversation is this that you have with one another as you [ f ] walk and are sad ? ”
NKJV	Luke	24	18	Then the one ( R ) whose name was Cleopas answered and said to Him , “ Are You the only stranger in Jerusalem , and have You not known the things which happened there in these days ? ”
NKJV	Luke	24	19	And He said to them , “ What things ? ” So they said to Him , “ The things concerning Jesus of Nazareth , ( S ) who was a Prophet ( T ) mighty in deed and word before God and all the people ,
NKJV	Luke	24	20	( U ) and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered Him to be condemned to death , and crucified Him .
NKJV	Luke	24	21	But we were hoping ( V ) that it was He who was going to redeem Israel . Indeed , besides all this , today is the third day since these things happened .
NKJV	Luke	24	22	Yes , and ( W ) certain women of our company , who arrived at the tomb early , astonished us .
NKJV	Luke	24	23	When they did not find His body , they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels who said He was alive .
NKJV	Luke	24	25	Then He said to them , “ O foolish ones , and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken !
NKJV	Luke	24	26	( Y ) Ought not the Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into His ( Z ) glory ? ”
NKJV	Luke	24	27	And beginning at ( AA ) Moses and ( AB ) all the Prophets , He [ g ] expounded to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself . The Disciples ’ Eyes Opened
NKJV	Luke	24	28	Then they drew near to the village where they were going , and ( AC ) He [ h ] indicated that He would have gone farther .
NKJV	Luke	24	29	But ( AD ) they constrained Him , saying , ( AE ) “ Abide with us , for it is toward evening , and the day is far spent. ” And He went in to stay with them .
NKJV	Luke	24	30	Now it came to pass , as ( AF ) He sat at the table with them , that He took bread , blessed and broke it , and gave it to them .
NKJV	Luke	24	31	Then their eyes were opened and they knew Him ; and He vanished from their sight .
NKJV	Luke	24	32	And they said to one another , “ Did not our heart burn within us while He talked with us on the road , and while He opened the Scriptures to us ? ”
NKJV	Luke	24	33	So they rose up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem , and found the eleven and those who were with them gathered together ,
NKJV	Luke	24	34	saying , “ The Lord is risen indeed , and ( AG ) has appeared to Simon ! ”
NKJV	Luke	24	35	And they told about the things that had happened on the road , and how He was [ i ] known to them in the breaking of bread . Jesus Appears to His Disciples ( AH )
NKJV	Luke	24	36	( AI ) Now as they said these things , Jesus Himself stood in the midst of them , and said to them , “ Peace to you. ”
NKJV	Luke	24	37	But they were terrified and frightened , and supposed they had seen ( AJ ) a spirit .
NKJV	Luke	24	38	And He said to them , “ Why are you troubled ? And why do doubts arise in your hearts ?
NKJV	Luke	24	39	Behold My hands and My feet , that it is I Myself . ( AK ) Handle Me and see , for a ( AL ) spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see I have. ”

NKJV	Luke	24	42	So they gave Him a piece of a broiled fish [ k ] and some honeycomb .
NKJV	Luke	24	43	( AO ) And He took it and ate in their presence . The Scriptures Opened
NKJV	Luke	24	44	Then He said to them , ( AP ) “ These are the words which I spoke to you while I was still with you , that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms concerning Me. ”
NKJV	Luke	24	45	And ( AQ ) He opened their understanding , that they might comprehend the Scriptures .
NKJV	Luke	24	46	Then He said to them , ( AR ) “ Thus it is written , [ l ] and thus it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day ,

NKJV	Luke	24	50	And He led them out ( AX ) as far as Bethany , and He lifted up His hands and blessed them .
NKJV	Luke	24	51	( AY ) Now it came to pass , while He blessed them , that He was parted from them and carried up into heaven .

NKJV	John	1	1	In the beginning ( B ) was the Word , and the ( C ) Word was ( D ) with God , and the Word was ( E ) God .
NKJV	John	1	2	( F ) He was in the beginning with God .
NKJV	John	1	3	( G ) All things were made through Him , and without Him nothing was made that was made .
NKJV	John	1	4	( H ) In Him was life , and ( I ) the life was the light of men .
NKJV	John	1	5	And ( J ) the light shines in the darkness , and the darkness did not [ a ] comprehend it . John ’ s Witness : The True Light
NKJV	John	1	6	There was a ( K ) man sent from God , whose name was John .
NKJV	John	1	7	This man came for a ( L ) witness , to bear witness of the Light , that all through him might ( M ) believe .
NKJV	John	1	8	He was not that Light , but was sent to bear witness of that ( N ) Light .
NKJV	John	1	9	( O ) That [ b ] was the true Light which gives light to every man coming into the world .
NKJV	John	1	10	He was in the world , and the world was made through Him , and ( P ) the world did not know Him .
NKJV	John	1	11	( Q ) He came to His [ c ] own , and His [ d ] own did not receive Him .
NKJV	John	1	12	But ( R ) as many as received Him , to them He gave the [ e ] right to become children of God , to those who believe in His name :
NKJV	John	1	13	( S ) who were born , not of blood , nor of the will of the flesh , nor of the will of man , but of God . The Word Becomes Flesh
NKJV	John	1	14	( T ) And the Word ( U ) became ( V ) flesh and dwelt among us , and ( W ) we beheld His glory , the glory as of the only begotten of the Father , ( X ) full of grace and truth .
NKJV	John	1	15	( Y ) John bore witness of Him and cried out , saying , “ This was He of whom I said , ( Z ) ‘ He who comes after me [ f ] is preferred before me , ( AA ) for He was before me. ’ ”
NKJV	John	1	16	[ g ] And of His ( AB ) fullness we have all received , and grace for grace .
NKJV	John	1	17	For ( AC ) the law was given through Moses , but ( AD ) grace and ( AE ) truth came through Jesus Christ .
NKJV	John	1	18	( AF ) No one has seen God at any time . ( AG ) The only begotten [ h ] Son , who is in the bosom of the Father , He has declared Him . A Voice in the Wilderness ( AH )
NKJV	John	1	19	Now this is ( AI ) the testimony of John , when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him , “ Who are you ? ”
NKJV	John	1	20	( AJ ) He confessed , and did not deny , but confessed , “ I am not the Christ. ”
NKJV	John	1	21	And they asked him , “ What then ? Are you Elijah ? ” He said , “ I am not. ” “ Are you ( AK ) the Prophet ? ” And he answered , “ No. ”
NKJV	John	1	22	Then they said to him , “ Who are you , that we may give an answer to those who sent us ? What do you say about yourself ? ”
NKJV	John	1	23	He said : ( AL ) “ I am ( AM ) ‘ The voice of one crying in the wilderness : “ Make straight the way of the Lord , ” ’ as the prophet Isaiah said. ”
NKJV	John	1	24	Now those who were sent were from the Pharisees .
NKJV	John	1	25	And they asked him , saying , “ Why then do you baptize if you are not the Christ , nor Elijah , nor the Prophet ? ”
NKJV	John	1	26	John answered them , saying , ( AN ) “ I baptize with water , ( AO ) but there stands One among you whom you do not know .
NKJV	John	1	27	( AP ) It is He who , coming after me , [ i ] is preferred before me , whose sandal strap I am not worthy to loose. ”
NKJV	John	1	28	These things were done ( AQ ) in [ j ] Bethabara beyond the Jordan , where John was baptizing . The Lamb of God ( AR )
NKJV	John	1	29	The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him , and said , “ Behold ! ( AS ) The Lamb of God ( AT ) who takes away the sin of the world !
NKJV	John	1	30	This is He of whom I said , ‘ After me comes a Man who [ k ] is preferred before me , for He was before me. ’
NKJV	John	1	31	I did not know Him ; but that He should be revealed to Israel , ( AU ) therefore I came baptizing with water. ”
NKJV	John	1	32	( AV ) And John bore witness , saying , “ I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove , and He remained upon Him .
NKJV	John	1	33	I did not know Him , but He who sent me to baptize with water said to me , ‘ Upon whom you see the Spirit descending , and remaining on Him , ( AW ) this is He who baptizes with the Holy Spirit. ’
NKJV	John	1	34	And I have seen and testified that this is the ( AX ) Son of God. ” The First Disciples
NKJV	John	1	35	Again , the next day , John stood with two of his disciples .
NKJV	John	1	36	And looking at Jesus as He walked , he said , ( AY ) “ Behold the Lamb of God ! ”
NKJV	John	1	37	The two disciples heard him speak , and they ( AZ ) followed Jesus .
NKJV	John	1	38	Then Jesus turned , and seeing them following , said to them , “ What do you seek ? ” They said to Him , “ Rabbi ” ( which is to say , when translated , Teacher ) , “ where are You staying ? ”
NKJV	John	1	39	He said to them , “ Come and see. ” They came and saw where He was staying , and remained with Him that day ( now it was about the tenth hour ) .
NKJV	John	1	40	One of the two who heard John speak , and followed Him , was ( BA ) Andrew , Simon Peter ’ s brother .
NKJV	John	1	41	He first found his own brother Simon , and said to him , “ We have found the [ l ] Messiah ” ( which is translated , the Christ ) .
NKJV	John	1	42	And he brought him to Jesus . Now when Jesus looked at him , He said , “ You are Simon the son of [ m ] Jonah . ( BB ) You shall be called Cephas ” ( which is translated , [ n ] A Stone ) . Philip and Nathanael
NKJV	John	1	43	The following day Jesus wanted to go to Galilee , and He found ( BC ) Philip and said to him , “ Follow Me. ”
NKJV	John	1	44	Now ( BD ) Philip was from Bethsaida , the city of Andrew and Peter .
NKJV	John	1	45	Philip found ( BE ) Nathanael and said to him , “ We have found Him of whom ( BF ) Moses in the law , and also the ( BG ) prophets , wrote—Jesus ( BH ) of Nazareth , the ( BI ) son of Joseph. ”
NKJV	John	1	46	And Nathanael said to him , ( BJ ) “ Can anything good come out of Nazareth ? ” Philip said to him , “ Come and see. ”
NKJV	John	1	47	Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward Him , and said of him , “ Behold , ( BK ) an Israelite indeed , in whom is no deceit ! ”
NKJV	John	1	48	Nathanael said to Him , “ How do You know me ? ” Jesus answered and said to him , “ Before Philip called you , when you were under the fig tree , I saw you. ”
NKJV	John	1	49	Nathanael answered and said to Him , “ Rabbi , ( BL ) You are the Son of God ! You are ( BM ) the King of Israel ! ”
NKJV	John	1	50	Jesus answered and said to him , “ Because I said to you , ‘ I saw you under the fig tree , ’ do you believe ? You will see greater things than these. ”
NKJV	John	1	51	And He said to him , “ Most assuredly , I say to you , ( BN ) hereafter [ o ] you shall see heaven open , and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man. ” Footnotes - John 1:5 Or overcome - John 1:9 Or That was the true Light which , coming into the world , gives light to every man . - John 1:11 His own things or domain - John 1:11 His own people - John 1:12 authority - John 1:15 ranks higher than I - John 1:16 NU For - John 1:18 NU God - John 1:27 ranks higher than I - John 1:28 NU , M Bethany - John 1:30 ranks higher than I - John 1:41 Lit .

NKJV	John	2	2	Now both Jesus and His disciples were invited to the wedding .
NKJV	John	2	3	And when they ran out of wine , the mother of Jesus said to Him , “ They have no wine. ”
NKJV	John	2	4	Jesus said to her , ( D ) “ Woman , ( E ) what does your concern have to do with Me ? ( F ) My hour has not yet come. ”
NKJV	John	2	5	His mother said to the servants , “ Whatever He says to you , do it. ”
NKJV	John	2	6	Now there were set there six waterpots of stone , ( G ) according to the manner of purification of the Jews , containing twenty or thirty gallons apiece .
NKJV	John	2	7	Jesus said to them , “ Fill the waterpots with water. ” And they filled them up to the brim .
NKJV	John	2	8	And He said to them , “ Draw some out now , and take it to the master of the feast. ” And they took it .
NKJV	John	2	9	When the master of the feast had tasted ( H ) the water that was made wine , and did not know where it came from ( but the servants who had drawn the water knew ) , the master of the feast called the bridegroom .
NKJV	John	2	10	And he said to him , “ Every man at the beginning sets out the good wine , and when the guests have well drunk , then the inferior . You have kept the good wine until now ! ”
NKJV	John	2	11	This ( I ) beginning of signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee , ( J ) and [ a ] manifested His glory ; and His disciples believed in Him .
NKJV	John	2	12	After this He went down to ( K ) Capernaum , He , His mother , ( L ) His brothers , and His disciples ; and they did not stay there many days . Jesus Cleanses the Temple ( M )
NKJV	John	2	13	( N ) Now the Passover of the Jews was at hand , and Jesus went up to Jerusalem .
NKJV	John	2	14	( O ) And He found in the temple those who sold oxen and sheep and doves , and the money changers [ b ] doing business .
NKJV	John	2	15	When He had made a whip of cords , He drove them all out of the temple , with the sheep and the oxen , and poured out the changers ’ money and overturned the tables .
NKJV	John	2	16	And He said to those who sold doves , “ Take these things away ! Do not make ( P ) My Father ’ s house a house of merchandise ! ”
NKJV	John	2	17	Then His disciples remembered that it was written , ( Q ) “ Zeal for Your house [ c ] has eaten Me up. ”
NKJV	John	2	18	So the Jews answered and said to Him , ( R ) “ What sign do You show to us , since You do these things ? ”
NKJV	John	2	19	Jesus answered and said to them , ( S ) “ Destroy this temple , and in three days I will raise it up. ”
NKJV	John	2	20	Then the Jews said , “ It has taken forty-six years to build this temple , and will You raise it up in three days ? ”
NKJV	John	2	21	But He was speaking ( T ) of the temple of His body .
NKJV	John	2	22	Therefore , when He had risen from the dead , ( U ) His disciples remembered that He had said this [ d ] to them ; and they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus had said . The Discerner of Hearts
NKJV	John	2	23	Now when He was in Jerusalem at the Passover , during the feast , many believed in His name when they saw the ( V ) signs which He did .
NKJV	John	2	24	But Jesus did not commit Himself to them , because He ( W ) knew all men ,
NKJV	John	2	25	and had no need that anyone should testify of man , for ( X ) He knew what was in man . Scripture taken from the New King James Version® . Copyright ©

NKJV	John	3	3	Jesus answered and said to him , “ Most assuredly , I say to you , ( D ) unless one is born [ a ] again , he can not see the kingdom of God. ”
NKJV	John	3	2	( A ) This man came to Jesus by night and said to Him , “ Rabbi , we know that You are a teacher come from God ; for ( B ) no one can do these signs that You do unless ( C ) God is with him. ”
NKJV	John	3	4	Nicodemus said to Him , “ How can a man be born when he is old ? Can he enter a second time into his mother ’ s womb and be born ? ”
NKJV	John	3	5	Jesus answered , “ Most assuredly , I say to you , ( E ) unless one is born of water and the Spirit , he can not enter the kingdom of God .
NKJV	John	3	6	That which is born of the flesh is ( F ) flesh , and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit .
NKJV	John	3	7	Do not marvel that I said to you , ‘ You must be born again. ’
NKJV	John	3	8	( G ) The wind blows where it wishes , and you hear the sound of it , but can not tell where it comes from and where it goes . So is everyone who is born of the Spirit. ”
NKJV	John	3	9	Nicodemus answered and said to Him , ( H ) “ How can these things be ? ”
NKJV	John	3	10	Jesus answered and said to him , “ Are you the teacher of Israel , and do not know these things ?
NKJV	John	3	11	( I ) Most assuredly , I say to you , We speak what We know and testify what We have seen , and ( J ) you do not receive Our witness .
NKJV	John	3	12	If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe , how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things ?
NKJV	John	3	13	( K ) No one has ascended to heaven but He who came down from heaven , that is , the Son of Man [ b ] who is in heaven .
NKJV	John	3	14	( L ) And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness , even so ( M ) must the Son of Man be lifted up ,
NKJV	John	3	15	that whoever ( N ) believes in Him should [ c ] not perish but ( O ) have eternal life .
NKJV	John	3	16	( P ) For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten ( Q ) Son , that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life .
NKJV	John	3	17	( R ) For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world , but that the world through Him might be saved .
NKJV	John	3	18	( S ) “ He who believes in Him is not condemned ; but he who does not believe is condemned already , because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God .
NKJV	John	3	19	And this is the condemnation , ( T ) that the light has come into the world , and men loved darkness rather than light , because their deeds were evil .
NKJV	John	3	20	For ( U ) everyone practicing evil hates the light and does not come to the light , lest his deeds should be exposed .
NKJV	John	3	21	But he who does the truth comes to the light , that his deeds may be clearly seen , that they have been ( V ) done in God. ” John the Baptist Exalts Christ
NKJV	John	3	22	After these things Jesus and His disciples came into the land of Judea , and there He remained with them ( W ) and baptized .
NKJV	John	3	23	Now John also was baptizing in Aenon near ( X ) Salim , because there was much water there . ( Y ) And they came and were baptized .
NKJV	John	3	24	For ( Z ) John had not yet been thrown into prison .
NKJV	John	3	25	Then there arose a dispute between some of John ’ s disciples and the Jews about purification .
NKJV	John	3	26	And they came to John and said to him , “ Rabbi , He who was with you beyond the Jordan , ( AA ) to whom you have testified—behold , He is baptizing , and all ( AB ) are coming to Him ! ”
NKJV	John	3	27	John answered and said , ( AC ) “ A man can receive nothing unless it has been given to him from heaven .
NKJV	John	3	28	You yourselves bear me witness , that I said , ( AD ) ‘ I am not the Christ , ’ but , ( AE ) ‘ I have been sent before Him. ’
NKJV	John	3	29	( AF ) He who has the bride is the bridegroom ; but ( AG ) the friend of the bridegroom , who stands and hears him , rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom ’ s voice . Therefore this joy of mine is fulfilled .
NKJV	John	3	30	( AH ) He must increase , but I must decrease .
NKJV	John	3	31	( AI ) He who comes from above ( AJ ) is above all ; ( AK ) he who is of the earth is earthly and speaks of the earth . ( AL ) He who comes from heaven is above all .
NKJV	John	3	32	And ( AM ) what He has seen and heard , that He testifies ; and no one receives His testimony .
NKJV	John	3	33	He who has received His testimony ( AN ) has certified that God is true .
NKJV	John	3	34	( AO ) For He whom God has sent speaks the words of God , for God does not give the Spirit ( AP ) by measure .
NKJV	John	3	35	( AQ ) The Father loves the Son , and has given all things into His hand .
NKJV	John	3	36	( AR ) He who believes in the Son has everlasting life ; and he who does not believe the Son shall not see life , but the ( AS ) wrath of God abides on him. ” Scripture taken from the New King James Version® . Copyright ©

NKJV	John	4	4	But He needed to go through Samaria .
NKJV	John	4	2	( though Jesus Himself did not baptize , but His disciples ) ,
NKJV	John	4	3	He left Judea and departed again to Galilee .
NKJV	John	4	5	So He came to a city of Samaria which is called Sychar , near the plot of ground that ( B ) Jacob ( C ) gave to his son Joseph .
NKJV	John	4	6	Now Jacob ’ s well was there . Jesus therefore , being wearied from His journey , sat thus by the well . It was about the sixth hour .
NKJV	John	4	7	A woman of Samaria came to draw water . Jesus said to her , “ Give Me a drink. ”
NKJV	John	4	8	For His disciples had gone away into the city to buy food .
NKJV	John	4	9	Then the woman of Samaria said to Him , “ How is it that You , being a Jew , ask a drink from me , a Samaritan woman ? ” For ( D ) Jews have no dealings with ( E ) Samaritans .
NKJV	John	4	10	Jesus answered and said to her , “ If you knew the ( F ) gift of God , and who it is who says to you , ‘ Give Me a drink , ’ you would have asked Him , and He would have given you ( G ) living water. ”
NKJV	John	4	11	The woman said to Him , “ Sir , You have nothing to draw with , and the well is deep . Where then do You get that living water ?
NKJV	John	4	12	Are You greater than our father Jacob , who gave us the well , and drank from it himself , as well as his sons and his livestock ? ”
NKJV	John	4	13	Jesus answered and said to her , “ Whoever drinks of this water will thirst again ,
NKJV	John	4	14	but ( H ) whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him will never thirst . But the water that I shall give him ( I ) will become in him a fountain of water springing up into everlasting life. ”
NKJV	John	4	15	( J ) The woman said to Him , “ Sir , give me this water , that I may not thirst , nor come here to draw. ”
NKJV	John	4	16	Jesus said to her , “ Go , call your husband , and come here. ”
NKJV	John	4	17	The woman answered and said , “ I have no husband. ” Jesus said to her , “ You have well said , ‘ I have no husband , ’
NKJV	John	4	18	for you have had five husbands , and the one whom you now have is not your husband ; in that you spoke truly. ”
NKJV	John	4	19	The woman said to Him , “ Sir , ( K ) I perceive that You are a prophet .
NKJV	John	4	20	Our fathers worshiped on ( L ) this mountain , and you Jews say that in ( M ) Jerusalem is the place where one ought to worship. ”
NKJV	John	4	21	Jesus said to her , “ Woman , believe Me , the hour is coming ( N ) when you will neither on this mountain , nor in Jerusalem , worship the Father .
NKJV	John	4	22	You worship ( O ) what you do not know ; we know what we worship , for ( P ) salvation is of the Jews .
NKJV	John	4	23	But the hour is coming , and now is , when the true worshipers will ( Q ) worship the Father in ( R ) spirit ( S ) and truth ; for the Father is seeking such to worship Him .
NKJV	John	4	24	( T ) God is Spirit , and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth. ”
NKJV	John	4	25	The woman said to Him , “ I know that Messiah ( U ) is coming ” ( who is called Christ ) . “ When He comes , ( V ) He will tell us all things. ”
NKJV	John	4	26	Jesus said to her , ( W ) “ I who speak to you am He. ” The Whitened Harvest
NKJV	John	4	27	And at this point His disciples came , and they marveled that He talked with a woman ; yet no one said , “ What do You seek ? ” or , “ Why are You talking with her ? ”
NKJV	John	4	28	The woman then left her waterpot , went her way into the city , and said to the men ,
NKJV	John	4	29	“ Come , see a Man ( X ) who told me all things that I ever did . Could this be the Christ ? ”
NKJV	John	4	30	Then they went out of the city and came to Him .
NKJV	John	4	31	In the meantime His disciples urged Him , saying , “ Rabbi , eat. ”
NKJV	John	4	32	But He said to them , “ I have food to eat of which you do not know. ”
NKJV	John	4	33	Therefore the disciples said to one another , “ Has anyone brought Him anything to eat ? ”
NKJV	John	4	34	Jesus said to them , ( Y ) “ My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me , and to ( Z ) finish His work .
NKJV	John	4	35	Do you not say , ‘ There are still four months and then comes ( AA ) the harvest ’ ? Behold , I say to you , lift up your eyes and look at the fields , ( AB ) for they are already white for harvest !
NKJV	John	4	36	( AC ) And he who reaps receives wages , and gathers fruit for eternal life , that ( AD ) both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together .
NKJV	John	4	37	For in this the saying is true : ( AE ) ‘ One sows and another reaps. ’
NKJV	John	4	38	I sent you to reap that for which you have not labored ; ( AF ) others have labored , and you have entered into their labors. ” The Savior of the World
NKJV	John	4	39	And many of the Samaritans of that city believed in Him ( AG ) because of the word of the woman who testified , “ He told me all that I ever did. ”
NKJV	John	4	40	So when the Samaritans had come to Him , they urged Him to stay with them ; and He stayed there two days .
NKJV	John	4	41	And many more believed because of His own ( AH ) word .
NKJV	John	4	42	Then they said to the woman , “ Now we believe , not because of what you said , for ( AI ) we ourselves have heard Him and we know that this is indeed [ a ] the Christ , the Savior of the world. ” Welcome at Galilee
NKJV	John	4	43	Now after the two days He departed from there and went to Galilee .
NKJV	John	4	44	For ( AJ ) Jesus Himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country .
NKJV	John	4	45	So when He came to Galilee , the Galileans received Him , ( AK ) having seen all the things He did in Jerusalem at the feast ; ( AL ) for they also had gone to the feast . A Nobleman ’ s Son Healed
NKJV	John	4	46	So Jesus came again to Cana of Galilee ( AM ) where He had made the water wine . And there was a certain [ b ] nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum .
NKJV	John	4	47	When he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee , he went to Him and implored Him to come down and heal his son , for he was at the point of death .
NKJV	John	4	48	Then Jesus said to him , ( AN ) “ Unless you people see signs and wonders , you will by no means believe. ”
NKJV	John	4	49	The nobleman said to Him , “ Sir , come down before my child dies ! ”
NKJV	John	4	50	Jesus said to him , “ Go your way ; your son lives. ” So the man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him , and he went his way .
NKJV	John	4	51	And as he was now going down , his servants met him and told him , saying , “ Your son lives ! ”
NKJV	John	4	52	Then he inquired of them the hour when he got better . And they said to him , “ Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him. ”
NKJV	John	4	53	So the father knew that it was at the same hour in which Jesus said to him , “ Your son lives. ” And he himself believed , and his whole household .

NKJV	John	5	5	Now a certain man was there who had an infirmity thirty-eight years .
NKJV	John	5	2	Now there is in Jerusalem ( C ) by the Sheep Gate a pool , which is called in Hebrew , [ a ] Bethesda , having five porches .
NKJV	John	5	3	In these lay a great multitude of sick people , blind , lame , [ b ] paralyzed , [ c ] waiting for the moving of the water .
NKJV	John	5	4	For an angel went down at a certain time into the pool and stirred up the water ; then whoever stepped in first , after the stirring of the water , was made well of whatever disease he had .
NKJV	John	5	6	When Jesus saw him lying there , and knew that he already had been in that condition a long time , He said to him , “ Do you want to be made well ? ”
NKJV	John	5	7	The sick man answered Him , “ Sir , I have no man to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up ; but while I am coming , another steps down before me. ”
NKJV	John	5	8	Jesus said to him , ( D ) “ Rise , take up your bed and walk. ”
NKJV	John	5	9	And immediately the man was made well , took up his bed , and walked . And ( E ) that day was the Sabbath .
NKJV	John	5	10	The Jews therefore said to him who was cured , “ It is the Sabbath ; ( F ) it is not lawful for you to carry your bed. ”
NKJV	John	5	11	He answered them , “ He who made me well said to me , ‘ Take up your bed and walk. ’ ”
NKJV	John	5	12	Then they asked him , “ Who is the Man who said to you , ‘ Take up your bed and walk ’ ? ”
NKJV	John	5	13	But the one who was ( G ) healed did not know who it was , for Jesus had withdrawn , a multitude being in that place .
NKJV	John	5	14	Afterward Jesus found him in the temple , and said to him , “ See , you have been made well . ( H ) Sin no more , lest a worse thing come upon you. ”
NKJV	John	5	15	The man departed and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well . Honor the Father and the Son
NKJV	John	5	16	For this reason the Jews ( I ) persecuted Jesus , [ d ] and sought to kill Him , because He had done these things on the Sabbath .
NKJV	John	5	17	But Jesus answered them , ( J ) “ My Father has been working until now , and I have been working. ”
NKJV	John	5	18	Therefore the Jews ( K ) sought all the more to kill Him , because He not only broke the Sabbath , but also said that God was His Father , ( L ) making Himself equal with God .
NKJV	John	5	19	Then Jesus answered and said to them , “ Most assuredly , I say to you , ( M ) the Son can do nothing of Himself , but what He sees the Father do ; for whatever He does , the Son also does in like manner .
NKJV	John	5	20	For ( N ) the Father loves the Son , and ( O ) shows Him all things that He Himself does ; and He will show Him greater works than these , that you may marvel .
NKJV	John	5	21	For as the Father raises the dead and gives life to them , ( P ) even so the Son gives life to whom He will .
NKJV	John	5	22	For the Father judges no one , but ( Q ) has committed all judgment to the Son ,
NKJV	John	5	23	that all should honor the Son just as they honor the Father . ( R ) He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him . Life and Judgment Are Through the Son
NKJV	John	5	24	“ Most assuredly , I say to you , ( S ) he who hears My word and believes in Him who sent Me has everlasting life , and shall not come into judgment , ( T ) but has passed from death into life .
NKJV	John	5	25	Most assuredly , I say to you , the hour is coming , and now is , when ( U ) the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God ; and those who hear will live .
NKJV	John	5	26	For ( V ) as the Father has life in Himself , so He has granted the Son to have ( W ) life in Himself ,
NKJV	John	5	27	and ( X ) has given Him authority to execute judgment also , ( Y ) because He is the Son of Man .
NKJV	John	5	28	Do not marvel at this ; for the hour is coming in which all who are in the graves will ( Z ) hear His voice
NKJV	John	5	29	( AA ) and come forth— ( AB ) those who have done good , to the resurrection of life , and those who have done evil , to the resurrection of condemnation .
NKJV	John	5	30	( AC ) I can of Myself do nothing . As I hear , I judge ; and My judgment is righteous , because ( AD ) I do not seek My own will but the will of the Father who sent Me . The Fourfold Witness
NKJV	John	5	31	( AE ) “ If I bear witness of Myself , My witness is not [ e ] true .
NKJV	John	5	32	( AF ) There is another who bears witness of Me , and I know that the witness which He witnesses of Me is true .
NKJV	John	5	33	You have sent to John , ( AG ) and he has borne witness to the truth .
NKJV	John	5	34	Yet I do not receive testimony from man , but I say these things that you may be saved .
NKJV	John	5	35	He was the burning and ( AH ) shining lamp , and ( AI ) you were willing for a time to rejoice in his light .
NKJV	John	5	36	But ( AJ ) I have a greater witness than John ’ s ; for ( AK ) the works which the Father has given Me to finish—the very ( AL ) works that I do—bear witness of Me , that the Father has sent Me .
NKJV	John	5	37	And the Father Himself , who sent Me , ( AM ) has testified of Me . You have neither heard His voice at any time , ( AN ) nor seen His form .
NKJV	John	5	38	But you do not have His word abiding in you , because whom He sent , Him you do not believe .
NKJV	John	5	39	( AO ) You search the Scriptures , for in them you think you have eternal life ; and ( AP ) these are they which testify of Me .
NKJV	John	5	40	( AQ ) But you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life .
NKJV	John	5	41	( AR ) “ I do not receive honor from men .
NKJV	John	5	42	But I know you , that you do not have the love of God in you .
NKJV	John	5	43	I have come in My Father ’ s name , and you do not receive Me ; if another comes in his own name , him you will receive .
NKJV	John	5	44	( AS ) How can you believe , who receive honor from one another , and do not seek ( AT ) the honor that comes from the only God ?
NKJV	John	5	45	Do not think that I shall accuse you to the Father ; ( AU ) there is one who accuses you—Moses , in whom you trust .
NKJV	John	5	46	For if you believed Moses , you would believe Me ; ( AV ) for he wrote about Me .

NKJV	John	6	6	But this He said to test him , for He Himself knew what He would do .
NKJV	John	6	2	Then a great multitude followed Him , because they saw His signs which He performed on those who were ( D ) diseased . [ a ]
NKJV	John	6	3	And Jesus went up on the mountain , and there He sat with His disciples .
NKJV	John	6	4	( E ) Now the Passover , a feast of the Jews , was near .
NKJV	John	6	5	( F ) Then Jesus lifted up His eyes , and seeing a great multitude coming toward Him , He said to ( G ) Philip , “ Where shall we buy bread , that these may eat ? ”
NKJV	John	6	7	Philip answered Him , ( H ) “ Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not sufficient for them , that every one of them may have a little. ”
NKJV	John	6	8	One of His disciples , ( I ) Andrew , Simon Peter ’ s brother , said to Him ,
NKJV	John	6	9	“ There is a lad here who has five barley loaves and two small fish , ( J ) but what are they among so many ? ”
NKJV	John	6	10	Then Jesus said , “ Make the people sit down. ” Now there was much grass in the place . So the men sat down , in number about five thousand .
NKJV	John	6	11	And Jesus took the loaves , and when He had given thanks He distributed them [ b ] to the disciples , and the disciples to those sitting down ; and likewise of the fish , as much as they wanted .
NKJV	John	6	12	So when they were filled , He said to His disciples , “ Gather up the fragments that remain , so that nothing is lost. ”
NKJV	John	6	13	Therefore they gathered them up , and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves which were left over by those who had eaten .
NKJV	John	6	14	Then those men , when they had seen the sign that Jesus did , said , “ This is truly ( K ) the Prophet who is to come into the world. ” Jesus Walks on the Sea ( L )
NKJV	John	6	15	Therefore when Jesus perceived that they were about to come and take Him by force to make Him ( M ) king , He departed again to the mountain by Himself alone .
NKJV	John	6	16	( N ) Now when evening came , His disciples went down to the sea ,
NKJV	John	6	17	got into the boat , and went over the sea toward Capernaum . And it was already dark , and Jesus had not come to them .
NKJV	John	6	18	Then the sea arose because a great wind was blowing .
NKJV	John	6	19	So when they had rowed about [ c ] three or four miles , they saw Jesus walking on the sea and drawing near the boat ; and they were ( O ) afraid .
NKJV	John	6	20	But He said to them , ( P ) “ It is I ; do not be afraid. ”
NKJV	John	6	21	Then they willingly received Him into the boat , and immediately the boat was at the land where they were going . The Bread from Heaven
NKJV	John	6	22	On the following day , when the people who were standing on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there , except [ d ] that one [ e ] which His disciples had entered , and that Jesus had not entered the boat with His disciples , but His disciples had gone away alone—
NKJV	John	6	23	however , other boats came from Tiberias , near the place where they ate bread after the Lord had given thanks—
NKJV	John	6	24	when the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there , nor His disciples , they also got into boats and came to Capernaum , ( Q ) seeking Jesus .
NKJV	John	6	25	or
NKJV	John	6	26	Jesus answered them and said , “ Most assuredly , I say to you , you seek Me , not because you saw the signs , but because you ate of the loaves and were filled .
NKJV	John	6	27	( R ) Do not labor for the food which perishes , but ( S ) for the food which endures to everlasting life , which the Son of Man will give you , ( T ) because God the Father has set His seal on Him. ”
NKJV	John	6	28	Then they said to Him , “ What shall we do , that we may work the works of God ? ”
NKJV	John	6	29	Jesus answered and said to them , ( U ) “ This is the work of God , that you believe in Him whom He sent. ”

NKJV	John	6	31	( W ) Our fathers ate the manna in the desert ; as it is written , ( X ) ‘ He gave them bread from heaven to eat. ’ ”
NKJV	John	6	32	Then Jesus said to them , “ Most assuredly , I say to you , Moses did not give you the bread from heaven , but ( Y ) My Father gives you the true bread from heaven .
NKJV	John	6	33	For the bread of God is He who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world. ”
NKJV	John	6	34	( Z ) Then they said to Him , “ Lord , give us this bread always. ”
NKJV	John	6	35	And Jesus said to them , ( AA ) “ I am the bread of life . ( AB ) He who comes to Me shall never hunger , and he who believes in Me shall never ( AC ) thirst .
NKJV	John	6	36	( AD ) But I said to you that you have seen Me and yet ( AE ) do not believe .
NKJV	John	6	37	( AF ) All that the Father gives Me will come to Me , and ( AG ) the one who comes to Me I will [ f ] by no means cast out .
NKJV	John	6	38	For I have come down from heaven , ( AH ) not to do My own will , ( AI ) but the will of Him who sent Me .
NKJV	John	6	39	This is the will of the Father who sent Me , ( AJ ) that of all He has given Me I should lose nothing , but should raise it up at the last day .
NKJV	John	6	40	And this is the will of Him who sent Me , ( AK ) that everyone who sees the Son and believes in Him may have everlasting life ; and I will raise him up at the last day. ” Rejected by His Own
NKJV	John	6	41	The Jews then [ g ] complained about Him , because He said , “ I am the bread which came down from heaven. ”
NKJV	John	6	42	And they said , ( AL ) “ Is not this Jesus , the son of Joseph , whose father and mother we know ? How is it then that He says , ‘ I have come down from heaven ’ ? ”
NKJV	John	6	43	Jesus therefore answered and said to them , [ h ] “ Do not murmur among yourselves .
NKJV	John	6	44	( AM ) No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me ( AN ) draws him ; and I will raise him up at the last day .
NKJV	John	6	45	It is written in the prophets , ( AO ) ‘ And they shall all be taught by God. ’ ( AP ) Therefore everyone who [ i ] has heard and learned from the Father comes to Me .
NKJV	John	6	46	( AQ ) Not that anyone has seen the Father , ( AR ) except He who is from God ; He has seen the Father .
NKJV	John	6	47	Most assuredly , I say to you , ( AS ) he who believes [ j ] in Me has everlasting life .
NKJV	John	6	48	( AT ) I am the bread of life .
NKJV	John	6	49	( AU ) Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness , and are dead .
NKJV	John	6	50	( AV ) This is the bread which comes down from heaven , that one may eat of it and not die .
NKJV	John	6	51	I am the living bread ( AW ) which came down from heaven . If anyone eats of this bread , he will live forever ; and ( AX ) the bread that I shall give is My flesh , which I shall give for the life of the world. ”
NKJV	John	6	52	The Jews therefore ( AY ) quarreled among themselves , saying , “ How can this Man give us His flesh to eat ? ”
NKJV	John	6	53	Then Jesus said to them , “ Most assuredly , I say to you , unless ( AZ ) you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood , you have no life in you .
NKJV	John	6	54	( BA ) Whoever eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life , and I will raise him up at the last day .
NKJV	John	6	55	For My flesh is [ k ] food indeed , and My blood is [ l ] drink indeed .
NKJV	John	6	56	He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood ( BB ) abides in Me , and I in him .
NKJV	John	6	57	As the living Father sent Me , and I live because of the Father , so he who feeds on Me will live because of Me .
NKJV	John	6	58	( BC ) This is the bread which came down from heaven—not ( BD ) as your fathers ate the manna , and are dead . He who eats this bread will live forever. ”
NKJV	John	6	59	These things He said in the synagogue as He taught in Capernaum . Many Disciples Turn Away
NKJV	John	6	60	( BE ) Therefore many of His disciples , when they heard this , said , “ This is a [ m ] hard saying ; who can understand it ? ”
NKJV	John	6	61	When Jesus knew in Himself that His disciples [ n ] complained about this , He said to them , “ Does this [ o ] offend you ?
NKJV	John	6	62	( BF ) What then if you should see the Son of Man ascend where He was before ?
NKJV	John	6	63	( BG ) It is the Spirit who gives life ; the ( BH ) flesh profits nothing . The ( BI ) words that I speak to you are spirit , and they are life .
NKJV	John	6	64	But ( BJ ) there are some of you who do not believe. ” For ( BK ) Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who did not believe , and who would betray Him .
NKJV	John	6	65	And He said , “ Therefore ( BL ) I have said to you that no one can come to Me unless it has been granted to him by My Father. ”
NKJV	John	6	66	( BM ) From that time many of His disciples went [ p ] back and walked with Him no more .
NKJV	John	6	67	Then Jesus said to the twelve , “ Do you also want to go away ? ”
NKJV	John	6	68	But Simon Peter answered Him , “ Lord , to whom shall we go ? You have ( BN ) the words of eternal life .
NKJV	John	6	69	( BO ) Also we have come to believe and know that You are the [ q ] Christ , the Son of the living God. ”
NKJV	John	6	70	Jesus answered them , ( BP ) “ Did I not choose you , the twelve , ( BQ ) and one of you is a devil ? ”
NKJV	John	6	71	He spoke of ( BR ) Judas Iscariot , the son of Simon , for it was he who would ( BS ) betray Him , being one of the twelve . Footnotes - John 6:2 sick - John 6:11 NU omits to the disciples , and the disciples - John 6:19 Lit .

NKJV	John	7	7	( G ) The world can not hate you , but it hates Me ( H ) because I testify of it that its works are evil .
NKJV	John	7	2	( B ) Now the Jews ’ Feast of Tabernacles was at hand .
NKJV	John	7	3	( C ) His brothers therefore said to Him , “ Depart from here and go into Judea , that Your disciples also may see the works that You are doing .
NKJV	John	7	4	For no one does anything in secret while he himself seeks to be known openly . If You do these things , show Yourself to the world. ”
NKJV	John	7	5	For ( D ) even His ( E ) brothers did not believe in Him .
NKJV	John	7	6	Then Jesus said to them , ( F ) “ My time has not yet come , but your time is always ready .
NKJV	John	7	8	You go up to this feast . I am not [ b ] yet going up to this feast , ( I ) for My time has not yet fully come. ”
NKJV	John	7	9	When He had said these things to them , He remained in Galilee . The Heavenly Scholar
NKJV	John	7	10	But when His brothers had gone up , then He also went up to the feast , not openly , but as it were in secret .
NKJV	John	7	11	Then ( J ) the Jews sought Him at the feast , and said , “ Where is He ? ”
NKJV	John	7	12	And ( K ) there was much complaining among the people concerning Him . ( L ) Some said , “ He is good ” ; others said , “ No , on the contrary , He deceives the people. ”
NKJV	John	7	13	However , no one spoke openly of Him ( M ) for fear of the Jews .
NKJV	John	7	14	Now about the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the temple and ( N ) taught .
NKJV	John	7	15	( O ) And the Jews marveled , saying , “ How does this Man know letters , having never studied ? ”
NKJV	John	7	16	[ c ] Jesus answered them and said , ( P ) “ My doctrine is not Mine , but His who sent Me .
NKJV	John	7	17	( Q ) If anyone wills to do His will , he shall know concerning the doctrine , whether it is from God or whether I speak on My own authority .
NKJV	John	7	18	( R ) He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory ; but He who ( S ) seeks the glory of the One who sent Him is true , and ( T ) no unrighteousness is in Him .
NKJV	John	7	19	( U ) Did not Moses give you the law , yet none of you keeps the law ? ( V ) Why do you seek to kill Me ? ”
NKJV	John	7	20	The people answered and said , ( W ) “ You have a demon . Who is seeking to kill You ? ”
NKJV	John	7	21	Jesus answered and said to them , “ I did one work , and you all marvel .
NKJV	John	7	22	( X ) Moses therefore gave you circumcision ( not that it is from Moses , ( Y ) but from the fathers ) , and you circumcise a man on the Sabbath .
NKJV	John	7	23	If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath , so that the law of Moses should not be broken , are you angry with Me because ( Z ) I made a man completely well on the Sabbath ?
NKJV	John	7	24	( AA ) Do not judge according to appearance , but judge with righteous judgment. ” Could This Be the Christ ?
NKJV	John	7	25	Now some of them from Jerusalem said , “ Is this not He whom they seek to ( AB ) kill ?
NKJV	John	7	26	But look ! He speaks boldly , and they say nothing to Him . ( AC ) Do the rulers know indeed that this is [ d ] truly the Christ ?
NKJV	John	7	27	( AD ) However , we know where this Man is from ; but when the Christ comes , no one knows where He is from. ”
NKJV	John	7	28	Then Jesus cried out , as He taught in the temple , saying , ( AE ) “ You both know Me , and you know where I am from ; and ( AF ) I have not come of Myself , but He who sent Me ( AG ) is true , ( AH ) whom you do not know .
NKJV	John	7	29	[ e ] But ( AI ) I know Him , for I am from Him , and He sent Me. ”
NKJV	John	7	30	Therefore ( AJ ) they sought to take Him ; but ( AK ) no one laid a hand on Him , because His hour had not yet come .
NKJV	John	7	31	And ( AL ) many of the people believed in Him , and said , “ When the Christ comes , will He do more signs than these which this Man has done ? ” Jesus and the Religious Leaders
NKJV	John	7	32	The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things concerning Him , and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take Him .
NKJV	John	7	33	Then Jesus said [ f ] to them , ( AM ) “ I shall be with you a little while longer , and then I ( AN ) go to Him who sent Me .
NKJV	John	7	34	You ( AO ) will seek Me and not find Me , and where I am you ( AP ) can not come. ”
NKJV	John	7	35	Then the Jews said among themselves , “ Where does He intend to go that we shall not find Him ? Does He intend to go to ( AQ ) the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks ?
NKJV	John	7	36	What is this thing that He said , ‘ You will seek Me and not find Me , and where I am you can not come ’ ? ” The Promise of the Holy Spirit
NKJV	John	7	37	( AR ) On the last day , that great day of the feast , Jesus stood and cried out , saying , ( AS ) “ If anyone thirsts , let him come to Me and drink .
NKJV	John	7	38	( AT ) He who believes in Me , as the Scripture has said , ( AU ) out of his heart will flow rivers of living water. ”
NKJV	John	7	39	( AV ) But this He spoke concerning the Spirit , whom those [ g ] believing in Him would receive ; for the [ h ] Holy Spirit was not yet given , because Jesus was not yet ( AW ) glorified . Who Is He ?
NKJV	John	7	40	Therefore [ i ] many from the crowd , when they heard this saying , said , “ Truly this is ( AX ) the Prophet. ”
NKJV	John	7	41	Others said , “ This is ( AY ) the Christ. ” But some said , “ Will the Christ come out of Galilee ?
NKJV	John	7	42	( AZ ) Has not the Scripture said that the Christ comes from the seed of David and from the town of Bethlehem , ( BA ) where David was ? ”
NKJV	John	7	43	So ( BB ) there was a division among the people because of Him .
NKJV	John	7	44	Now ( BC ) some of them wanted to take Him , but no one laid hands on Him . Rejected by the Authorities
NKJV	John	7	45	Then the officers came to the chief priests and Pharisees , who said to them , “ Why have you not brought Him ? ”
NKJV	John	7	46	The officers answered , ( BD ) “ No man ever spoke like this Man ! ”
NKJV	John	7	47	Then the Pharisees answered them , “ Are you also deceived ?
NKJV	John	7	48	Have any of the rulers or the Pharisees believed in Him ?
NKJV	John	7	49	But this crowd that does not know the law is accursed. ”
NKJV	John	7	50	Nicodemus ( BE ) ( he who came to [ j ] Jesus [ k ] by night , being one of them ) said to them ,
NKJV	John	7	51	( BF ) “ Does our law judge a man before it hears him and knows what he is doing ? ”
NKJV	John	7	52	They answered and said to him , “ Are you also from Galilee ? Search and look , for ( BG ) no prophet [ l ] has arisen out of Galilee. ” An Adulteress Faces the Light of the World

NKJV	John	8	8	And again He stooped down and wrote on the ground .
NKJV	John	8	2	Now [ a ] early in the morning He came again into the temple , and all the people came to Him ; and He sat down and ( A ) taught them .
NKJV	John	8	3	Then the scribes and Pharisees brought to Him a woman caught in adultery . And when they had set her in the midst ,
NKJV	John	8	4	they said to Him , “ Teacher , [ b ] this woman was caught in ( B ) adultery , in the very act .
NKJV	John	8	5	( C ) Now [ c ] Moses , in the law , commanded us [ d ] that such should be stoned . But what do You [ e ] say ? ”
NKJV	John	8	6	This they said , testing Him , that they ( D ) might have something of which to accuse Him . But Jesus stooped down and wrote on the ground with His finger , [ f ] as though He did not hear .
NKJV	John	8	7	So when they continued asking Him , He [ g ] raised Himself up and said to them , ( E ) “ He who is without sin among you , let him throw a stone at her first. ”
NKJV	John	8	9	Then those who heard it , ( F ) being [ h ] convicted by their conscience , went out one by one , beginning with the oldest even to the last . And Jesus was left alone , and the woman standing in the midst .
NKJV	John	8	10	When Jesus had raised Himself up [ i ] and saw no one but the woman , He said to her , “ Woman , where are those accusers [ j ] of yours ? Has no one condemned you ? ”
NKJV	John	8	11	She said , “ No one , Lord. ” And Jesus said to her , ( G ) “ Neither do I condemn you ; go [ k ] and ( H ) sin no more. ”
NKJV	John	8	12	Then Jesus spoke to them again , saying , ( I ) “ I am the light of the world . He who ( J ) follows Me shall not walk in darkness , but have the light of life. ” Jesus Defends His Self-Witness
NKJV	John	8	13	The Pharisees therefore said to Him , ( K ) “ You bear witness of Yourself ; Your witness is not [ l ] true. ”
NKJV	John	8	14	Jesus answered and said to them , “ Even if I bear witness of Myself , My witness is true , for I know where I came from and where I am going ; but ( L ) you do not know where I come from and where I am going .
NKJV	John	8	15	( M ) You judge according to the flesh ; ( N ) I judge no one .
NKJV	John	8	16	And yet if I do judge , My judgment is true ; for ( O ) I am not alone , but I am with the Father who sent Me .
NKJV	John	8	17	( P ) It is also written in your law that the testimony of two men is true .
NKJV	John	8	18	I am One who bears witness of Myself , and ( Q ) the Father who sent Me bears witness of Me. ”
NKJV	John	8	19	Then they said to Him , “ Where is Your Father ? ” Jesus answered , ( R ) “ You know neither Me nor My Father . ( S ) If you had known Me , you would have known My Father also. ”
NKJV	John	8	20	These words Jesus spoke in ( T ) the treasury , as He taught in the temple ; and ( U ) no one laid hands on Him , for ( V ) His hour had not yet come . Jesus Predicts His Departure
NKJV	John	8	21	Then Jesus said to them again , “ I am going away , and ( W ) you will seek Me , and ( X ) will die in your sin . Where I go you can not come. ”
NKJV	John	8	22	So the Jews said , “ Will He kill Himself , because He says , ‘ Where I go you can not come ’ ? ”
NKJV	John	8	23	And He said to them , ( Y ) “ You are from beneath ; I am from above . ( Z ) You are of this world ; I am not of this world .
NKJV	John	8	24	( AA ) Therefore I said to you that you will die in your sins ; ( AB ) for if you do not believe that I am He , you will die in your sins. ”
NKJV	John	8	25	Then they said to Him , “ Who are You ? ” And Jesus said to them , “ Just what I ( AC ) have been saying to you from the beginning .
NKJV	John	8	26	I have many things to say and to judge concerning you , but ( AD ) He who sent Me is true ; and ( AE ) I speak to the world those things which I heard from Him. ”
NKJV	John	8	27	They did not understand that He spoke to them of the Father .
NKJV	John	8	28	Then Jesus said to them , “ When you ( AF ) lift [ m ] up the Son of Man , ( AG ) then you will know that I am He , and ( AH ) that I do nothing of Myself ; but ( AI ) as My Father taught Me , I speak these things .
NKJV	John	8	29	And ( AJ ) He who sent Me is with Me . ( AK ) The Father has not left Me alone , ( AL ) for I always do those things that please Him. ”
NKJV	John	8	30	As He spoke these words , ( AM ) many believed in Him . The Truth Shall Make You Free
NKJV	John	8	31	Then Jesus said to those Jews who believed Him , “ If you ( AN ) abide in My word , you are My disciples indeed .
NKJV	John	8	32	And you shall know the ( AO ) truth , and ( AP ) the truth shall make you free. ”
NKJV	John	8	33	They answered Him , ( AQ ) “ We are Abraham ’ s descendants , and have never been in bondage to anyone . How can You say , ‘ You will be made free ’ ? ”
NKJV	John	8	34	Jesus answered them , “ Most assuredly , I say to you , ( AR ) whoever commits sin is a slave of sin .
NKJV	John	8	35	And ( AS ) a slave does not abide in the house forever , but a son abides forever .
NKJV	John	8	36	( AT ) Therefore if the Son makes you free , you shall be free indeed . Abraham ’ s Seed and Satan ’ s
NKJV	John	8	37	“ I know that you are Abraham ’ s descendants , but ( AU ) you seek to kill Me , because My word has no place in you .
NKJV	John	8	38	( AV ) I speak what I have seen with My Father , and you do what you have [ n ] seen with your father. ”
NKJV	John	8	39	They answered and said to Him , ( AW ) “ Abraham is our father. ” Jesus said to them , ( AX ) “ If you were Abraham ’ s children , you would do the works of Abraham .
NKJV	John	8	40	( AY ) But now you seek to kill Me , a Man who has told you the truth ( AZ ) which I heard from God . Abraham did not do this .
NKJV	John	8	41	You do the deeds of your father. ” Then they said to Him , “ We were not born of fornication ; ( BA ) we have one Father—God. ”
NKJV	John	8	42	Jesus said to them , ( BB ) “ If God were your Father , you would love Me , for ( BC ) I proceeded forth and came from God ; ( BD ) nor have I come of Myself , but He sent Me .
NKJV	John	8	43	( BE ) Why do you not understand My speech ? Because you are not able to listen to My word .
NKJV	John	8	44	( BF ) You are of your father the devil , and the ( BG ) desires of your father you want to ( BH ) do . He was a murderer from the beginning , and ( BI ) does not stand in the truth , because there is no truth in him . When he speaks a lie , he speaks from his own resources , for he is a liar and the father of it .
NKJV	John	8	45	But because I tell the truth , you do not believe Me .
NKJV	John	8	46	Which of you convicts Me of sin ? And if I tell the truth , why do you not believe Me ?
NKJV	John	8	47	( BJ ) He who is of God hears God ’ s words ; therefore you do not hear , because you are not of God. ” Before Abraham Was , I AM
NKJV	John	8	48	Then the Jews answered and said to Him , “ Do we not say rightly that You are a Samaritan and ( BK ) have a demon ? ”
NKJV	John	8	49	Jesus answered , “ I do not have a demon ; but I honor My Father , and ( BL ) you dishonor Me .
NKJV	John	8	50	And ( BM ) I do not seek My own glory ; there is One who seeks and judges .
NKJV	John	8	51	Most assuredly , I say to you , ( BN ) if anyone keeps My word he shall never see death. ”
NKJV	John	8	52	Then the Jews said to Him , “ Now we know that You ( BO ) have a demon ! ( BP ) Abraham is dead , and the prophets ; and You say , ‘ If anyone keeps My word he shall never taste death. ’
NKJV	John	8	53	Are You greater than our father Abraham , who is dead ? And the prophets are dead . ( BQ ) Who do You make Yourself out to be ? ”
NKJV	John	8	54	Jesus answered , ( BR ) “ If I honor Myself , My honor is nothing . ( BS ) It is My Father who honors Me , of whom you say that He is [ o ] your God .
NKJV	John	8	55	Yet ( BT ) you have not known Him , but I know Him . And if I say , ‘ I do not know Him , ’ I shall be a liar like you ; but I do know Him and ( BU ) keep His word .
NKJV	John	8	56	Your father Abraham ( BV ) rejoiced to see My day , ( BW ) and he saw it and was glad. ”
NKJV	John	8	57	Then the Jews said to Him , “ You are not yet fifty years old , and have You seen Abraham ? ”
NKJV	John	8	58	Jesus said to them , “ Most assuredly , I say to you , ( BX ) before Abraham was , ( BY ) I AM. ”

NKJV	John	9	9	Some said , “ This is he. ” Others said , [ c ] “ He is like him. ” He said , “ I am he. ”
NKJV	John	9	2	And His disciples asked Him , saying , “ Rabbi , ( A ) who sinned , this man or his parents , that he was born blind ? ”
NKJV	John	9	3	Jesus answered , “ Neither this man nor his parents sinned , ( B ) but that the works of God should be revealed in him .
NKJV	John	9	4	( C ) I [ a ] must work the works of Him who sent Me while it is ( D ) day ; the night is coming when no one can work .
NKJV	John	9	5	As long as I am in the world , ( E ) I am the light of the world. ”
NKJV	John	9	6	When He had said these things , ( F ) He spat on the ground and made clay with the saliva ; and He anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay .
NKJV	John	9	7	And He said to him , “ Go , wash ( G ) in the pool of Siloam ” ( which is translated , Sent ) . So ( H ) he went and washed , and came back seeing .
NKJV	John	9	8	Therefore the neighbors and those who previously had seen that he was [ b ] blind said , “ Is not this he who sat and begged ? ”
NKJV	John	9	10	Therefore they said to him , “ How were your eyes opened ? ”
NKJV	John	9	11	He answered and said , ( I ) “ A Man called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes and said to me , ‘ Go to [ d ] the pool of Siloam and wash. ’ So I went and washed , and I received sight. ”
NKJV	John	9	12	Then they said to him , “ Where is He ? ” He said , “ I do not know. ” The Pharisees Excommunicate the Healed Man
NKJV	John	9	13	They brought him who formerly was blind to the Pharisees .
NKJV	John	9	14	Now it was a Sabbath when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes .
NKJV	John	9	15	Then the Pharisees also asked him again how he had received his sight . He said to them , “ He put clay on my eyes , and I washed , and I see. ”
NKJV	John	9	16	Therefore some of the Pharisees said , “ This Man is not from God , because He does not [ e ] keep the Sabbath. ” Others said , ( J ) “ How can a man who is a sinner do such signs ? ” And ( K ) there was a division among them .
NKJV	John	9	17	They said to the blind man again , “ What do you say about Him because He opened your eyes ? ” He said , ( L ) “ He is a prophet. ”
NKJV	John	9	18	But the Jews did not believe concerning him , that he had been blind and received his sight , until they called the parents of him who had received his sight .
NKJV	John	9	19	And they asked them , saying , “ Is this your son , who you say was born blind ? How then does he now see ? ”
NKJV	John	9	20	His parents answered them and said , “ We know that this is our son , and that he was born blind ;
NKJV	John	9	21	but by what means he now sees we do not know , or who opened his eyes we do not know . He is of age ; ask him . He will speak for himself. ”
NKJV	John	9	22	His parents said these things because ( M ) they feared the Jews , for the Jews had agreed already that if anyone confessed that He was Christ , he ( N ) would be put out of the synagogue .
NKJV	John	9	23	Therefore his parents said , “ He is of age ; ask him. ”
NKJV	John	9	24	So they again called the man who was blind , and said to him , ( O ) “ Give God the glory ! ( P ) We know that this Man is a sinner. ”
NKJV	John	9	25	He answered and said , “ Whether He is a sinner or not I do not know . One thing I know : that though I was blind , now I see. ”
NKJV	John	9	26	Then they said to him again , “ What did He do to you ? How did He open your eyes ? ”
NKJV	John	9	27	He answered them , “ I told you already , and you did not listen . Why do you want to hear it again ? Do you also want to become His disciples ? ”
NKJV	John	9	28	Then they reviled him and said , “ You are His disciple , but we are Moses ’ disciples .
NKJV	John	9	29	We know that God ( Q ) spoke to ( R ) Moses ; as for this fellow , ( S ) we do not know where He is from. ”
NKJV	John	9	30	The man answered and said to them , ( T ) “ Why , this is a marvelous thing , that you do not know where He is from ; yet He has opened my eyes !
NKJV	John	9	31	Now we know that ( U ) God does not hear sinners ; but if anyone is a worshiper of God and does His will , He hears him .
NKJV	John	9	32	Since the world began it has been unheard of that anyone opened the eyes of one who was born blind .
NKJV	John	9	33	( V ) If this Man were not from God , He could do nothing. ”
NKJV	John	9	34	They answered and said to him , ( W ) “ You were completely born in sins , and are you teaching us ? ” And they [ f ] cast him out . True Vision and True Blindness
NKJV	John	9	35	Jesus heard that they had cast him out ; and when He had ( X ) found him , He said to him , “ Do you ( Y ) believe in ( Z ) the Son of [ g ] God ? ”
NKJV	John	9	36	He answered and said , “ Who is He , Lord , that I may believe in Him ? ”
NKJV	John	9	37	And Jesus said to him , “ You have both seen Him and ( AA ) it is He who is talking with you. ”
NKJV	John	9	38	Then he said , “ Lord , I believe ! ” And he ( AB ) worshiped Him .
NKJV	John	9	39	And Jesus said , ( AC ) “ For judgment I have come into this world , ( AD ) that those who do not see may see , and that those who see may be made blind. ”
NKJV	John	9	40	Then some of the Pharisees who were with Him heard these words , ( AE ) and said to Him , “ Are we blind also ? ”
NKJV	John	9	41	Jesus said to them , ( AF ) “ If you were blind , you would have no sin ; but now you say , ‘ We see. ’ Therefore your sin remains . Scripture taken from the New King James Version® . Copyright ©

NKJV	John	10	10	The thief does not come except to steal , and to kill , and to destroy . I have come that they may have life , and that they may have it more abundantly .
NKJV	John	10	2	But he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep .
NKJV	John	10	3	To him the doorkeeper opens , and the sheep hear his voice ; and he calls his own sheep by ( A ) name and leads them out .
NKJV	John	10	4	And when he brings out his own sheep , he goes before them ; and the sheep follow him , for they know his voice .
NKJV	John	10	5	Yet they will by no means follow a ( B ) stranger , but will flee from him , for they do not know the voice of strangers. ”
NKJV	John	10	6	Jesus used this illustration , but they did not understand the things which He spoke to them . Jesus the Good Shepherd
NKJV	John	10	7	Then Jesus said to them again , “ Most assuredly , I say to you , I am the door of the sheep .
NKJV	John	10	8	All who ever came [ a ] before Me are thieves and robbers , but the sheep did not hear them .
NKJV	John	10	9	( C ) I am the door . If anyone enters by Me , he will be saved , and will go in and out and find pasture .
NKJV	John	10	11	( D ) “ I am the good shepherd . The good shepherd gives His life for the sheep .
NKJV	John	10	12	But a [ b ] hireling , he who is not the shepherd , one who does not own the sheep , sees the wolf coming and ( E ) leaves the sheep and flees ; and the wolf catches the sheep and scatters them .
NKJV	John	10	13	The hireling flees because he is a hireling and does not care about the sheep .
NKJV	John	10	14	I am the good shepherd ; and ( F ) I know My sheep , and ( G ) am known by My own .
NKJV	John	10	15	( H ) As the Father knows Me , even so I know the Father ; ( I ) and I lay down My life for the sheep .
NKJV	John	10	16	And ( J ) other sheep I have which are not of this fold ; them also I must bring , and they will hear My voice ; ( K ) and there will be one flock and one shepherd .
NKJV	John	10	17	“ Therefore My Father ( L ) loves Me , ( M ) because I lay down My life that I may take it again .
NKJV	John	10	18	No one takes it from Me , but I lay it down of Myself . I ( N ) have power to lay it down , and I have power to take it again . ( O ) This command I have received from My Father. ”
NKJV	John	10	19	Therefore ( P ) there was a division again among the Jews because of these sayings .
NKJV	John	10	20	And many of them said , ( Q ) “ He has a demon and is [ c ] mad . Why do you listen to Him ? ”
NKJV	John	10	21	Others said , “ These are not the words of one who has a demon . ( R ) Can a demon ( S ) open the eyes of the blind ? ” The Shepherd Knows His Sheep
NKJV	John	10	22	Now it was the Feast of Dedication in Jerusalem , and it was winter .
NKJV	John	10	23	And Jesus walked in the temple , ( T ) in Solomon ’ s porch .
NKJV	John	10	24	Then the Jews surrounded Him and said to Him , “ How long do You keep us in [ d ] doubt ? If You are the Christ , tell us plainly. ”
NKJV	John	10	25	Jesus answered them , “ I told you , and you do not believe . ( U ) The works that I do in My Father ’ s name , they ( V ) bear witness of Me .
NKJV	John	10	26	But ( W ) you do not believe , because you are not of My sheep , [ e ] as I said to you .
NKJV	John	10	27	( X ) My sheep hear My voice , and I know them , and they follow Me .
NKJV	John	10	28	And I give them eternal life , and they shall never perish ; neither shall anyone snatch them out of My hand .
NKJV	John	10	29	( Y ) My Father , ( Z ) who has given them to Me , is greater than all ; and no one is able to snatch them out of My Father ’ s hand .
NKJV	John	10	30	( AA ) I and My Father are one. ” Renewed Efforts to Stone Jesus
NKJV	John	10	31	Then ( AB ) the Jews took up stones again to stone Him .
NKJV	John	10	32	Jesus answered them , “ Many good works I have shown you from My Father . For which of those works do you stone Me ? ”
NKJV	John	10	33	The Jews answered Him , saying , “ For a good work we do not stone You , but for ( AC ) blasphemy , and because You , being a Man , ( AD ) make Yourself God. ”
NKJV	John	10	34	Jesus answered them , “ Is it not written in your law , ( AE ) ‘ I said , “ You are gods ” ’ ?
NKJV	John	10	35	If He called them gods , ( AF ) to whom the word of God came ( and the Scripture ( AG ) can not be broken ) ,
NKJV	John	10	36	do you say of Him ( AH ) whom the Father sanctified and ( AI ) sent into the world , ‘ You are blaspheming , ’ ( AJ ) because I said , ‘ I am ( AK ) the Son of God ’ ?
NKJV	John	10	37	( AL ) If I do not do the works of My Father , do not believe Me ;
NKJV	John	10	38	but if I do , though you do not believe Me , ( AM ) believe the works , that you may know and [ f ] believe ( AN ) that the Father is in Me , and I in Him. ”
NKJV	John	10	39	( AO ) Therefore they sought again to seize Him , but He escaped out of their hand . The Believers Beyond Jordan
NKJV	John	10	40	And He went away again beyond the Jordan to the place ( AP ) where John was baptizing at first , and there He stayed .
NKJV	John	10	41	Then many came to Him and said , “ John performed no sign , ( AQ ) but all the things that John spoke about this Man were true. ”

NKJV	John	11	11	These things He said , and after that He said to them , “ Our friend Lazarus ( H ) sleeps , but I go that I may wake him up. ”
NKJV	John	11	2	( B ) It was that Mary who anointed the Lord with fragrant oil and wiped His feet with her hair , whose brother Lazarus was sick .
NKJV	John	11	3	Therefore the sisters sent to Him , saying , “ Lord , behold , he whom You love is sick. ”
NKJV	John	11	4	When Jesus heard that , He said , “ This sickness is not unto death , but for the glory of God , that the Son of God may be glorified through it. ”
NKJV	John	11	5	Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus .
NKJV	John	11	6	So , when He heard that he was sick , ( C ) He stayed two more days in the place where He was .
NKJV	John	11	7	Then after this He said to the disciples , “ Let us go to Judea again. ”
NKJV	John	11	8	The disciples said to Him , “ Rabbi , lately the Jews sought to ( D ) stone You , and are You going there again ? ”
NKJV	John	11	9	Jesus answered , “ Are there not twelve hours in the day ? ( E ) If anyone walks in the day , he does not stumble , because he sees the ( F ) light of this world .
NKJV	John	11	10	But ( G ) if one walks in the night , he stumbles , because the light is not in him. ”
NKJV	John	11	12	Then His disciples said , “ Lord , if he sleeps he will get well. ”
NKJV	John	11	13	However , Jesus spoke of his death , but they thought that He was speaking about taking rest in sleep .

NKJV	John	11	17	So when Jesus came , He found that he had already been in the tomb four days .
NKJV	John	11	18	Now Bethany was near Jerusalem , about [ a ] two miles away .
NKJV	John	11	19	And many of the Jews had joined the women around Martha and Mary , to comfort them concerning their brother .
NKJV	John	11	20	Then Martha , as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming , went and met Him , but Mary was sitting in the house .
NKJV	John	11	21	Now Martha said to Jesus , “ Lord , if You had been here , my brother would not have died .
NKJV	John	11	22	But even now I know that ( J ) whatever You ask of God , God will give You. ”
NKJV	John	11	23	Jesus said to her , “ Your brother will rise again. ”

NKJV	John	11	25	Jesus said to her , “ I am ( L ) the resurrection and the life . ( M ) He who believes in Me , though he may ( N ) die , he shall live .
NKJV	John	11	26	And whoever lives and believes in Me shall never die . Do you believe this ? ”
NKJV	John	11	27	She said to Him , “ Yes , Lord , ( O ) I believe that You are the Christ , the Son of God , who is to come into the world. ” Jesus and Death , the Last Enemy
NKJV	John	11	28	And when she had said these things , she went her way and secretly called Mary her sister , saying , “ The Teacher has come and is calling for you. ”
NKJV	John	11	29	As soon as she heard that , she arose quickly and came to Him .
NKJV	John	11	30	Now Jesus had not yet come into the town , but [ b ] was in the place where Martha met Him .
NKJV	John	11	31	( P ) Then the Jews who were with her in the house , and comforting her , when they saw that Mary rose up quickly and went out , followed her , [ c ] saying , “ She is going to the tomb to weep there. ”
NKJV	John	11	32	Then , when Mary came where Jesus was , and saw Him , she ( Q ) fell down at His feet , saying to Him , ( R ) “ Lord , if You had been here , my brother would not have died. ”
NKJV	John	11	33	Therefore , when Jesus saw her weeping , and the Jews who came with her weeping , He groaned in the spirit and was troubled .
NKJV	John	11	34	And He said , “ Where have you laid him ? ” They said to Him , “ Lord , come and see. ”
NKJV	John	11	35	( S ) Jesus wept .
NKJV	John	11	36	Then the Jews said , “ See how He loved him ! ”
NKJV	John	11	37	And some of them said , “ Could not this Man , ( T ) who opened the eyes of the blind , also have kept this man from dying ? ” Lazarus Raised from the Dead
NKJV	John	11	38	Then Jesus , again groaning in Himself , came to the tomb . It was a cave , and a ( U ) stone lay against it .
NKJV	John	11	39	Jesus said , “ Take away the stone. ” Martha , the sister of him who was dead , said to Him , “ Lord , by this time there is a stench , for he has been dead four days. ”
NKJV	John	11	40	Jesus said to her , “ Did I not say to you that if you would believe you would ( V ) see the glory of God ? ”
NKJV	John	11	41	Then they took away the stone [ d ] from the place where the dead man was lying . And Jesus lifted up His eyes and said , “ Father , I thank You that You have heard Me .
NKJV	John	11	42	And I know that You always hear Me , but ( W ) because of the people who are standing by I said this , that they may believe that You sent Me. ”
NKJV	John	11	43	Now when He had said these things , He cried with a loud voice , “ Lazarus , come forth ! ”
NKJV	John	11	44	And he who had died came out bound hand and foot with ( X ) graveclothes , and ( Y ) his face was wrapped with a cloth . Jesus said to them , “ Loose him , and let him go. ” The Plot to Kill Jesus ( Z )
NKJV	John	11	45	Then many of the Jews who had come to Mary , ( AA ) and had seen the things Jesus did , believed in Him .
NKJV	John	11	46	But some of them went away to the Pharisees and ( AB ) told them the things Jesus did .
NKJV	John	11	47	( AC ) Then the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered a council and said , ( AD ) “ What shall we do ? For this Man works many signs .
NKJV	John	11	48	If we let Him alone like this , everyone will believe in Him , and the Romans will come and take away both our place and nation. ”
NKJV	John	11	49	And one of them , ( AE ) Caiaphas , being high priest that year , said to them , “ You know nothing at all ,
NKJV	John	11	50	( AF ) nor do you consider that it is expedient for [ e ] us that one man should die for the people , and not that the whole nation should perish. ”
NKJV	John	11	51	Now this he did not say on his own authority ; but being high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation ,
NKJV	John	11	52	and ( AG ) not for that nation only , but ( AH ) also that He would gather together in one the children of God who were scattered abroad .
NKJV	John	11	53	Then , from that day on , they plotted to ( AI ) put Him to death .
NKJV	John	11	54	( AJ ) Therefore Jesus no longer walked openly among the Jews , but went from there into the country near the wilderness , to a city called ( AK ) Ephraim , and there remained with His disciples .
NKJV	John	11	55	( AL ) And the Passover of the Jews was near , and many went from the country up to Jerusalem before the Passover , to ( AM ) purify themselves .
NKJV	John	11	56	( AN ) Then they sought Jesus , and spoke among themselves as they stood in the temple , “ What do you think—that He will not come to the feast ? ”
NKJV	John	11	57	Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a command , that if anyone knew where He was , he should report it , that they might ( AO ) seize Him . Footnotes - John 11:18 Lit .

NKJV	John	12	12	( M ) The next day a great multitude that had come to the feast , when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem ,
NKJV	John	12	2	( C ) There they made Him a supper ; and Martha served , but Lazarus was one of those who sat at the table with Him .
NKJV	John	12	3	Then ( D ) Mary took a pound of very costly oil of ( E ) spikenard , anointed the feet of Jesus , and wiped His feet with her hair . And the house was filled with the fragrance of the oil .
NKJV	John	12	4	But one of His disciples , ( F ) Judas Iscariot , Simon ’ s son , who would betray Him , said ,
NKJV	John	12	5	“ Why was this fragrant oil not sold for [ b ] three hundred denarii and given to the poor ? ”
NKJV	John	12	6	This he said , not that he cared for the poor , but because he was a thief , and ( G ) had the money box ; and he used to take what was put in it .
NKJV	John	12	7	But Jesus said , “ Let her alone ; [ c ] she has kept this for the day of My burial .
NKJV	John	12	8	For ( H ) the poor you have with you always , but Me you do not have always. ” The Plot to Kill Lazarus
NKJV	John	12	9	Now a great many of the Jews knew that He was there ; and they came , not for Jesus ’ sake only , but that they might also see Lazarus , ( I ) whom He had raised from the dead .
NKJV	John	12	10	( J ) But the chief priests plotted to put Lazarus to death also ,
NKJV	John	12	11	( K ) because on account of him many of the Jews went away and believed in Jesus . The Triumphal Entry ( L )
NKJV	John	12	13	took branches of palm trees and went out to meet Him , and cried out : “ Hosanna ! ( N ) ‘ Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord ! ’ The King of Israel ! ”
NKJV	John	12	14	( O ) Then Jesus , when He had found a young donkey , sat on it ; as it is written :
NKJV	John	12	15	“ Fear ( P ) not , daughter of Zion ; Behold , your King is coming , Sitting on a donkey ’ s colt. ”
NKJV	John	12	16	( Q ) His disciples did not understand these things at first ; ( R ) but when Jesus was glorified , ( S ) then they remembered that these things were written about Him and that they had done these things to Him .
NKJV	John	12	17	Therefore the people , who were with Him when He called Lazarus out of his tomb and raised him from the dead , bore witness .
NKJV	John	12	18	( T ) For this reason the people also met Him , because they heard that He had done this sign .
NKJV	John	12	19	The Pharisees therefore said among themselves , ( U ) “ You see that you are accomplishing nothing . Look , the world has gone after Him ! ” The Fruitful Grain of Wheat
NKJV	John	12	20	Now there ( V ) were certain Greeks among those ( W ) who came up to worship at the feast .
NKJV	John	12	21	Then they came to Philip , ( X ) who was from Bethsaida of Galilee , and asked him , saying , “ Sir , we wish to see Jesus. ”
NKJV	John	12	22	Philip came and told Andrew , and in turn Andrew and Philip told Jesus .
NKJV	John	12	23	But Jesus answered them , saying , ( Y ) “ The hour has come that the Son of Man should be glorified .
NKJV	John	12	24	Most assuredly , I say to you , ( Z ) unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies , it remains alone ; but if it dies , it produces much [ d ] grain .
NKJV	John	12	25	( AA ) He who loves his life will lose it , and he who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life .
NKJV	John	12	26	If anyone serves Me , let him ( AB ) follow Me ; and ( AC ) where I am , there My servant will be also . If anyone serves Me , him My Father will honor . Jesus Predicts His Death on the Cross
NKJV	John	12	27	( AD ) “ Now My soul is troubled , and what shall I say ? ‘ Father , save Me from this hour ’ ? ( AE ) But for this purpose I came to this hour .
NKJV	John	12	28	Father , glorify Your name. ” ( AF ) Then a voice came from heaven , saying , “ I have both glorified it and will glorify it again. ”
NKJV	John	12	29	Therefore the people who stood by and heard it said that it had thundered . Others said , “ An angel has spoken to Him. ”
NKJV	John	12	30	Jesus answered and said , ( AG ) “ This voice did not come because of Me , but for your sake .
NKJV	John	12	31	Now is the judgment of this world ; now ( AH ) the ruler of this world will be cast out .
NKJV	John	12	32	And I , ( AI ) if I am [ e ] lifted up from the earth , will draw ( AJ ) all peoples to Myself. ”
NKJV	John	12	33	( AK ) This He said , signifying by what death He would die .
NKJV	John	12	34	The people answered Him , ( AL ) “ We have heard from the law that the Christ remains forever ; and how can You say , ‘ The Son of Man must be lifted up ’ ? Who is this Son of Man ? ”
NKJV	John	12	35	Then Jesus said to them , “ A little while longer ( AM ) the light is with you . ( AN ) Walk while you have the light , lest darkness overtake you ; ( AO ) he who walks in darkness does not know where he is going .
NKJV	John	12	36	While you have the light , believe in the light , that you may become ( AP ) sons of light. ” These things Jesus spoke , and departed , and ( AQ ) was hidden from them . Who Has Believed Our Report ?
NKJV	John	12	37	But although He had done so many ( AR ) signs before them , they did not believe in Him ,
NKJV	John	12	38	that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled , which he spoke : ( AS ) “ Lord , who has believed our report ? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed ? ”
NKJV	John	12	39	Therefore they could not believe , because Isaiah said again :
NKJV	John	12	40	“ He ( AT ) has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts , ( AU ) Lest they should see with their eyes , Lest they should understand with their hearts and turn , So that I should heal them. ”
NKJV	John	12	41	( AV ) These things Isaiah said [ f ] when he saw His glory and spoke of Him . Walk in the Light
NKJV	John	12	42	Nevertheless even among the rulers many believed in Him , but ( AW ) because of the Pharisees they did not confess Him , lest they should be put out of the synagogue ;
NKJV	John	12	43	( AX ) for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God .
NKJV	John	12	44	Then Jesus cried out and said , ( AY ) “ He who believes in Me , ( AZ ) believes not in Me ( BA ) but in Him who sent Me .
NKJV	John	12	45	And ( BB ) he who sees Me sees Him who sent Me .
NKJV	John	12	46	( BC ) I have come as a light into the world , that whoever believes in Me should not abide in darkness .
NKJV	John	12	47	And if anyone hears My words and does not [ g ] believe , ( BD ) I do not judge him ; for ( BE ) I did not come to judge the world but to save the world .
NKJV	John	12	48	( BF ) He who rejects Me , and does not receive My words , has that which judges him— ( BG ) the word that I have spoken will judge him in the last day .
NKJV	John	12	49	For ( BH ) I have not spoken on My own authority ; but the Father who sent Me gave Me a command , ( BI ) what I should say and what I should speak .
NKJV	John	12	50	And I know that His command is everlasting life . Therefore , whatever I speak , just as the Father has told Me , so I ( BJ ) speak. ” Footnotes - John 12:1 NU omits who had been dead - John 12:5 About one year ’ s wages for a worker - John 12:7 NU that she may keep - John 12:24 Lit . fruit - John 12:32 Crucified - John 12:41 NU because - John 12:47 NU keep them Scripture taken from the New King James Version® .

NKJV	John	13	13	( O ) You call Me Teacher and Lord , and you say well , for so I am .
NKJV	John	13	2	And [ a ] supper being ended , ( D ) the devil having already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot , Simon ’ s son , to betray Him ,
NKJV	John	13	3	Jesus , knowing ( E ) that the Father had given all things into His hands , and that He ( F ) had come from God and ( G ) was going to God ,
NKJV	John	13	4	( H ) rose from supper and laid aside His garments , took a towel and girded Himself .
NKJV	John	13	5	After that , He poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples ’ feet , and to wipe them with the towel with which He was girded .
NKJV	John	13	6	Then He came to Simon Peter . And Peter said to Him , ( I ) “ Lord , are You washing my feet ? ”
NKJV	John	13	7	Jesus answered and said to him , “ What I am doing you ( J ) do not understand now , ( K ) but you will know after this. ”
NKJV	John	13	8	Peter said to Him , “ You shall never wash my feet ! ” Jesus answered him , ( L ) “ If I do not wash you , you have no part with Me. ”
NKJV	John	13	9	Simon Peter said to Him , “ Lord , not my feet only , but also my hands and my head ! ”
NKJV	John	13	10	Jesus said to him , “ He who is bathed needs only to wash his feet , but is completely clean ; and ( M ) you are clean , but not all of you. ”
NKJV	John	13	11	For ( N ) He knew who would betray Him ; therefore He said , “ You are not all clean. ”
NKJV	John	13	12	So when He had washed their feet , taken His garments , and sat down again , He said to them , “ Do you [ b ] know what I have done to you ?
NKJV	John	13	14	( P ) If I then , your Lord and Teacher , have washed your feet , ( Q ) you also ought to wash one another ’ s feet .
NKJV	John	13	15	For ( R ) I have given you an example , that you should do as I have done to you .
NKJV	John	13	16	( S ) Most assuredly , I say to you , a servant is not greater than his master ; nor is he who is sent greater than he who sent him .
NKJV	John	13	17	( T ) If you know these things , blessed are you if you do them . Jesus Identifies His Betrayer ( U )
NKJV	John	13	18	“ I do not speak concerning all of you . I know whom I have chosen ; but that the ( V ) Scripture may be fulfilled , ( W ) ‘ He who eats [ c ] bread with Me has lifted up his heel against Me. ’
NKJV	John	13	19	( X ) Now I tell you before it comes , that when it does come to pass , you may believe that I am He .
NKJV	John	13	20	( Y ) Most assuredly , I say to you , he who receives whomever I send receives Me ; and he who receives Me receives Him who sent Me. ”
NKJV	John	13	21	( Z ) When Jesus had said these things , ( AA ) He was troubled in spirit , and testified and said , “ Most assuredly , I say to you , ( AB ) one of you will betray Me. ”
NKJV	John	13	22	Then the disciples looked at one another , perplexed about whom He spoke .
NKJV	John	13	23	Now ( AC ) there was [ d ] leaning on Jesus ’ bosom one of His disciples , whom Jesus loved .
NKJV	John	13	24	Simon Peter therefore motioned to him to ask who it was of whom He spoke .
NKJV	John	13	25	Then , leaning [ e ] back on Jesus ’ breast , he said to Him , “ Lord , who is it ? ”
NKJV	John	13	26	Jesus answered , “ It is he to whom I shall give a piece of bread when I have dipped it. ” And having dipped the bread , He gave it to ( AD ) Judas Iscariot , the son of Simon .
NKJV	John	13	27	( AE ) Now after the piece of bread , Satan entered him . Then Jesus said to him , “ What you do , do quickly. ”
NKJV	John	13	28	But no one at the table knew for what reason He said this to him .
NKJV	John	13	29	For some thought , because ( AF ) Judas had the money box , that Jesus had said to him , “ Buy those things we need for the feast , ” or that he should give something to the poor .
NKJV	John	13	30	Having received the piece of bread , he then went out immediately . And it was night . The New Commandment
NKJV	John	13	31	So , when he had gone out , Jesus said , ( AG ) “ Now the Son of Man is glorified , and ( AH ) God is glorified in Him .
NKJV	John	13	32	If God is glorified in Him , God will also glorify Him in Himself , and ( AI ) glorify Him immediately .
NKJV	John	13	33	Little children , I shall be with you a ( AJ ) little while longer . You will seek Me ; ( AK ) and as I said to the Jews , ‘ Where I am going , you can not come , ’ so now I say to you .
NKJV	John	13	34	( AL ) A new commandment I give to you , that you love one another ; as I have loved you , that you also love one another .
NKJV	John	13	35	( AM ) By this all will know that you are My disciples , if you have love for one another. ” Jesus Predicts Peter ’ s Denial
NKJV	John	13	36	Simon Peter said to Him , “ Lord , where are You going ? ” Jesus answered him , “ Where I ( AN ) am going you can not follow Me now , but ( AO ) you shall follow Me afterward. ”
NKJV	John	13	37	Peter said to Him , “ Lord , why can I not follow You now ? I will ( AP ) lay down my life for Your sake. ”

NKJV	John	14	22	( AD ) Judas ( not Iscariot ) said to Him , “ Lord , how is it that You will manifest Yourself to us , and not to the world ? ”
NKJV	John	14	23	Jesus answered and said to him , “ If anyone loves Me , he will keep My word ; and My Father will love him , ( AE ) and We will come to him and make Our home with him .

NKJV	John	16	16	“ A ( S ) little while , and you will not see Me ; and again a little while , and you will see Me , ( T ) because I go to the Father. ”
NKJV	John	16	2	( B ) They will put you out of the synagogues ; yes , the time is coming ( C ) that whoever kills you will think that he offers God service .
NKJV	John	16	3	And ( D ) these things they will do [ a ] to you because they have not known the Father nor Me .
NKJV	John	16	4	But these things I have told you , that when [ b ] the time comes , you may remember that I told you of them . “ And these things I did not say to you at the beginning , because I was with you . The Work of the Holy Spirit
NKJV	John	16	5	“ But now I ( E ) go away to Him who sent Me , and none of you asks Me , ‘ Where are You going ? ’
NKJV	John	16	6	But because I have said these things to you , ( F ) sorrow has filled your heart .
NKJV	John	16	7	Nevertheless I tell you the truth . It is to your advantage that I go away ; for if I do not go away , the Helper will not come to you ; but ( G ) if I depart , I will send Him to you .
NKJV	John	16	8	And when He has ( H ) come , He will convict the world of sin , and of righteousness , and of judgment :
NKJV	John	16	9	( I ) of sin , because they do not believe in Me ;
NKJV	John	16	10	( J ) of righteousness , ( K ) because I go to My Father and you see Me no more ;
NKJV	John	16	11	( L ) of judgment , because ( M ) the ruler of this world is judged .
NKJV	John	16	12	“ I still have many things to say to you , ( N ) but you can not bear them now .
NKJV	John	16	13	However , when He , ( O ) the Spirit of truth , has come , ( P ) He will guide you into all truth ; for He will not speak on His own authority , but whatever He hears He will speak ; and He will tell you things to come .
NKJV	John	16	14	( Q ) He will glorify Me , for He will take of what is Mine and declare it to you .
NKJV	John	16	15	( R ) All things that the Father has are Mine . Therefore I said that He [ c ] will take of Mine and declare it to you . Sorrow Will Turn to Joy
NKJV	John	16	17	Then some of His disciples said among themselves , “ What is this that He says to us , ‘ A little while , and you will not see Me ; and again a little while , and you will see Me ’ ; and , ‘ because I go to the Father ’ ? ”
NKJV	John	16	18	They said therefore , “ What is this that He says , ‘ A little while ’ ? We do not [ d ] know what He is saying. ”
NKJV	John	16	19	Now Jesus knew that they desired to ask Him , and He said to them , “ Are you inquiring among yourselves about what I said , ‘ A little while , and you will not see Me ; and again a little while , and you will see Me ’ ?
NKJV	John	16	20	Most assuredly , I say to you that you will weep and ( U ) lament , but the world will rejoice ; and you will be sorrowful , but your sorrow will be turned into ( V ) joy .
NKJV	John	16	21	( W ) A woman , when she is in labor , has sorrow because her hour has come ; but as soon as she has given birth to the child , she no longer remembers the anguish , for joy that a human being has been born into the world .
NKJV	John	16	22	Therefore you now have sorrow ; but I will see you again and ( X ) your heart will rejoice , and your joy no one will take from you .
NKJV	John	16	23	“ And in that day you will ask Me nothing . ( Y ) Most assuredly , I say to you , whatever you ask the Father in My name He will give you .
NKJV	John	16	24	Until now you have asked nothing in My name . Ask , and you will receive , ( Z ) that your joy may be ( AA ) full . Jesus Christ Has Overcome the World
NKJV	John	16	25	“ These things I have spoken to you in figurative language ; but the time is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figurative language , but I will tell you ( AB ) plainly about the Father .
NKJV	John	16	26	In that day you will ask in My name , and I do not say to you that I shall pray the Father for you ;
NKJV	John	16	27	( AC ) for the Father Himself loves you , because you have loved Me , and ( AD ) have believed that I came forth from God .
NKJV	John	16	28	( AE ) I came forth from the Father and have come into the world . Again , I leave the world and go to the Father. ”
NKJV	John	16	29	His disciples said to Him , “ See , now You are speaking plainly , and using no figure of speech !
NKJV	John	16	30	Now we are sure that ( AF ) You know all things , and have no need that anyone should question You . By this ( AG ) we believe that You came forth from God. ”
NKJV	John	16	31	Jesus answered them , “ Do you now believe ?
NKJV	John	16	32	( AH ) Indeed the hour is coming , yes , has now come , that you will be scattered , ( AI ) each to his [ e ] own , and will leave Me alone . And ( AJ ) yet I am not alone , because the Father is with Me .
NKJV	John	16	33	These things I have spoken to you , that ( AK ) in Me you may have peace .

NKJV	John	17	13	But now I come to You , and these things I speak in the world , that they may have My joy fulfilled in themselves .
NKJV	John	17	14	I have given them Your word ; ( Z ) and the world has hated them because they are not of the world , ( AA ) just as I am not of the world .
NKJV	John	17	15	I do not pray that You should take them out of the world , but ( AB ) that You should keep them from the evil one .
NKJV	John	17	16	They are not of the world , just as I am not of the world .
NKJV	John	17	18	( AE ) As You sent Me into the world , I also have sent them into the world .
NKJV	John	17	19	And ( AF ) for their sakes I sanctify Myself , that they also may be sanctified by the truth . Jesus Prays for All Believers

NKJV	John	18	18	Now the servants and officers who had made a fire of coals stood there , for it was cold , and they warmed themselves . And Peter stood with them and warmed himself . Jesus Questioned by the High Priest
NKJV	John	18	2	And Judas , who betrayed Him , also knew the place ; ( D ) for Jesus often met there with His disciples .
NKJV	John	18	3	( E ) Then Judas , having received a detachment of troops , and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees , came there with lanterns , torches , and weapons .
NKJV	John	18	4	Jesus therefore , ( F ) knowing all things that would come upon Him , went forward and said to them , “ Whom are you seeking ? ”
NKJV	John	18	5	They answered Him , ( G ) “ Jesus [ a ] of Nazareth. ” Jesus said to them , “ I am He. ” And Judas , who ( H ) betrayed Him , also stood with them .
NKJV	John	18	6	Now when He said to them , “ I am He , ” they drew back and fell to the ground .
NKJV	John	18	7	Then He asked them again , “ Whom are you seeking ? ” And they said , “ Jesus of Nazareth. ”
NKJV	John	18	8	Jesus answered , “ I have told you that I am He . Therefore , if you seek Me , let these go their way , ”
NKJV	John	18	9	that the saying might be fulfilled which He spoke , ( I ) “ Of those whom You gave Me I have lost none. ”
NKJV	John	18	10	( J ) Then Simon Peter , having a sword , drew it and struck the high priest ’ s servant , and cut off his right ear . The servant ’ s name was Malchus .
NKJV	John	18	11	So Jesus said to Peter , “ Put your sword into the sheath . Shall I not drink ( K ) the cup which My Father has given Me ? ” Before the High Priest
NKJV	John	18	12	Then the detachment of troops and the captain and the officers of the Jews arrested Jesus and bound Him .
NKJV	John	18	13	And ( L ) they led Him away to ( M ) Annas first , for he was the father-in-law of ( N ) Caiaphas who was high priest that year .
NKJV	John	18	14	( O ) Now it was Caiaphas who advised the Jews that it was [ b ] expedient that one man should die for the people . Peter Denies Jesus ( P )
NKJV	John	18	15	( Q ) And Simon Peter followed Jesus , and so did ( R ) another [ c ] disciple . Now that disciple was known to the high priest , and went with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest .
NKJV	John	18	16	( S ) But Peter stood at the door outside . Then the other disciple , who was known to the high priest , went out and spoke to her who kept the door , and brought Peter in .
NKJV	John	18	17	Then the servant girl who kept the door said to Peter , “ You are not also one of this Man ’ s disciples , are you ? ” He said , “ I am ( T ) not. ”
NKJV	John	18	19	The high priest then asked Jesus about His disciples and His doctrine .
NKJV	John	18	20	Jesus answered him , ( U ) “ I spoke openly to the world . I always taught ( V ) in synagogues and ( W ) in the temple , where [ d ] the Jews always meet , and in secret I have said nothing .
NKJV	John	18	21	Why do you ask Me ? Ask ( X ) those who have heard Me what I said to them . Indeed they know what I said. ”
NKJV	John	18	22	And when He had said these things , one of the officers who stood by ( Y ) struck [ e ] Jesus with the palm of his hand , saying , “ Do You answer the high priest like that ? ”
NKJV	John	18	23	Jesus answered him , “ If I have spoken evil , bear witness of the evil ; but if well , why do you strike Me ? ”
NKJV	John	18	24	( Z ) Then Annas sent Him bound to ( AA ) Caiaphas the high priest . Peter Denies Twice More
NKJV	John	18	25	Now Simon Peter stood and warmed himself . ( AB ) Therefore they said to him , “ You are not also one of His disciples , are you ? ” He denied it and said , “ I am not ! ”
NKJV	John	18	26	One of the servants of the high priest , a relative of him whose ear Peter cut off , said , “ Did I not see you in the garden with Him ? ”
NKJV	John	18	27	Peter then denied again ; and ( AC ) immediately a rooster crowed . In Pilate ’ s Court ( AD )
NKJV	John	18	28	( AE ) Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the Praetorium , and it was early morning . ( AF ) But they themselves did not go into the [ f ] Praetorium , lest they should be defiled , but that they might eat the Passover .
NKJV	John	18	29	( AG ) Pilate then went out to them and said , “ What accusation do you bring against this Man ? ”
NKJV	John	18	30	They answered and said to him , “ If He were not [ g ] an evildoer , we would not have delivered Him up to you. ”
NKJV	John	18	31	Then Pilate said to them , “ You take Him and judge Him according to your law. ” Therefore the Jews said to him , “ It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death , ”
NKJV	John	18	32	( AH ) that the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled which He spoke , ( AI ) signifying by what death He would die .
NKJV	John	18	33	( AJ ) Then Pilate entered the [ h ] Praetorium again , called Jesus , and said to Him , “ Are You the King of the Jews ? ”
NKJV	John	18	34	Jesus answered him , “ Are you speaking for yourself about this , or did others tell you this concerning Me ? ”
NKJV	John	18	35	Pilate answered , “ Am I a Jew ? Your own nation and the chief priests have delivered You to me . What have You done ? ”
NKJV	John	18	36	( AK ) Jesus answered , ( AL ) “ My kingdom is not of this world . If My kingdom were of this world , My servants would fight , so that I should not be delivered to the Jews ; but now My kingdom is not from here. ”
NKJV	John	18	37	Pilate therefore said to Him , “ Are You a king then ? ” Jesus answered , “ You say rightly that I am a king . For this cause I was born , and for this cause I have come into the world , ( AM ) that I should bear ( AN ) witness to the truth . Everyone who ( AO ) is of the truth ( AP ) hears My voice. ”
NKJV	John	18	38	Pilate said to Him , “ What is truth ? ” And when he had said this , he went out again to the Jews , and said to them , ( AQ ) “ I find no fault in Him at all . Taking the Place of Barabbas ( AR )
NKJV	John	18	39	( AS ) “ But you have a custom that I should release someone to you at the Passover . Do you therefore want me to release to you the King of the Jews ? ”
NKJV	John	18	40	( AT ) Then they all cried again , saying , “ Not this Man , but Barabbas ! ” ( AU ) Now Barabbas was a robber .

NKJV	John	19	19	( T ) Now Pilate wrote a title and put it on the cross . And the writing was : JESUS OF NAZARETH , THE KING OF THE JEWS .
NKJV	John	19	2	And the soldiers twisted a crown of thorns and put it on His head , and they put on Him a purple robe .
NKJV	John	19	3	[ a ] Then they said , “ Hail , King of the Jews ! ” And they ( C ) struck Him with their hands .
NKJV	John	19	4	Pilate then went out again , and said to them , “ Behold , I am bringing Him out to you , ( D ) that you may know that I find no fault in Him. ” Pilate ’ s Decision
NKJV	John	19	5	Then Jesus came out , wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe . And Pilate said to them , “ Behold the Man ! ”
NKJV	John	19	6	( E ) Therefore , when the chief priests and officers saw Him , they cried out , saying , “ Crucify Him , crucify Him ! ” Pilate said to them , “ You take Him and crucify Him , for I find no fault in Him. ”
NKJV	John	19	7	The Jews answered him , ( F ) “ We have a law , and according to [ b ] our law He ought to die , because ( G ) He made Himself the Son of God. ”
NKJV	John	19	8	Therefore , when Pilate heard that saying , he was the more afraid ,
NKJV	John	19	9	and went again into the Praetorium , and said to Jesus , “ Where are You from ? ” ( H ) But Jesus gave him no answer .
NKJV	John	19	10	Then Pilate said to Him , “ Are You not speaking to me ? Do You not know that I have [ c ] power to crucify You , and power to release You ? ”
NKJV	John	19	11	Jesus answered , ( I ) “ You could have no power at all against Me unless it had been given you from above . Therefore ( J ) the one who delivered Me to you has the greater sin. ”
NKJV	John	19	12	From then on Pilate sought to release Him , but the Jews cried out , saying , “ If you let this Man go , you are not Caesar ’ s friend . ( K ) Whoever makes himself a king speaks against Caesar. ”
NKJV	John	19	13	( L ) When Pilate therefore heard that saying , he brought Jesus out and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called The Pavement , but in Hebrew , Gabbatha .
NKJV	John	19	14	Now ( M ) it was the Preparation Day of the Passover , and about the sixth hour . And he said to the Jews , “ Behold your King ! ”
NKJV	John	19	15	But they cried out , “ Away with Him , away with Him ! Crucify Him ! ” Pilate said to them , “ Shall I crucify your King ? ” The chief priests answered , ( N ) “ We have no king but Caesar ! ”
NKJV	John	19	16	( O ) Then he delivered Him to them to be crucified . Then they took Jesus [ d ] and led Him away . The King on a Cross ( P )
NKJV	John	19	17	( Q ) And He , bearing His cross , ( R ) went out to a place called the Place of a Skull , which is called in Hebrew , Golgotha ,
NKJV	John	19	18	where they crucified Him , and ( S ) two others with Him , one on either side , and Jesus in the center .
NKJV	John	19	20	Then many of the Jews read this title , for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city ; and it was written in Hebrew , Greek , and Latin .
NKJV	John	19	21	Therefore the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate , “ Do not write , ‘ The King of the Jews , ’ but , ‘ He said , “ I am the King of the Jews. ” ’ ”
NKJV	John	19	22	Pilate answered , “ What I have written , I have written. ”
NKJV	John	19	23	( U ) Then the soldiers , when they had crucified Jesus , took His garments and made four parts , to each soldier a part , and also the tunic . Now the tunic was without seam , woven from the top in one piece .
NKJV	John	19	24	They said therefore among themselves , “ Let us not tear it , but cast lots for it , whose it shall be , ” that the Scripture might be fulfilled which says : ( V ) “ They divided My garments among them , And for My clothing they cast lots. ” Therefore the soldiers did these things . Behold Your Mother
NKJV	John	19	25	( W ) Now there stood by the cross of Jesus His mother , and His mother ’ s sister , Mary the wife of ( X ) Clopas , and Mary Magdalene .
NKJV	John	19	26	When Jesus therefore saw His mother , and ( Y ) the disciple whom He loved standing by , He said to His mother , ( Z ) “ Woman , behold your son ! ”
NKJV	John	19	27	Then He said to the disciple , “ Behold your mother ! ” And from that hour that disciple took her ( AA ) to his own home . It Is Finished
NKJV	John	19	28	After this , Jesus , [ e ] knowing that all things were now accomplished , ( AB ) that the Scripture might be fulfilled , said , “ I thirst ! ”
NKJV	John	19	29	Now a vessel full of sour wine was sitting there ; and ( AC ) they filled a sponge with sour wine , put it on hyssop , and put it to His mouth .
NKJV	John	19	30	So when Jesus had received the sour wine , He said , ( AD ) “ It is finished ! ” And bowing His head , He gave up His spirit . Jesus ’ Side Is Pierced
NKJV	John	19	31	( AE ) Therefore , because it was the Preparation Day , ( AF ) that the bodies should not remain on the cross on the Sabbath ( for that Sabbath was a ( AG ) high day ) , the Jews asked Pilate that their legs might be broken , and that they might be taken away .
NKJV	John	19	32	Then the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and of the other who was crucified with Him .
NKJV	John	19	33	But when they came to Jesus and saw that He was already dead , they did not break His legs .
NKJV	John	19	34	But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear , and immediately ( AH ) blood and water came out .
NKJV	John	19	35	And he who has seen has testified , and his testimony is ( AI ) true ; and he knows that he is telling the truth , so that you may ( AJ ) believe .
NKJV	John	19	36	For these things were done that the Scripture should be fulfilled , ( AK ) “ Not one of His bones shall be broken. ”
NKJV	John	19	37	And again another Scripture says , ( AL ) “ They shall look on Him whom they pierced. ” Jesus Buried in Joseph ’ s Tomb ( AM )
NKJV	John	19	38	( AN ) After this , Joseph of Arimathea , being a disciple of Jesus , but secretly , ( AO ) for fear of the Jews , asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus ; and Pilate gave him permission . So he came and took the body of Jesus .
NKJV	John	19	39	And ( AP ) Nicodemus , who at first came to Jesus by night , also came , bringing a mixture of ( AQ ) myrrh and aloes , about a hundred pounds .
NKJV	John	19	40	Then they took the body of Jesus , and ( AR ) bound it in strips of linen with the spices , as the custom of the Jews is to bury .
NKJV	John	19	41	Now in the place where He was crucified there was a garden , and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid .
NKJV	John	19	42	So ( AS ) there they laid Jesus , ( AT ) because of the Jews ’ Preparation Day , for the tomb was nearby .

NKJV	John	20	20	When He had said this , He ( X ) showed them His hands and His side . ( Y ) Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord .
NKJV	John	20	2	Then she ran and came to Simon Peter , and to the ( D ) other disciple , ( E ) whom Jesus loved , and said to them , “ They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb , and we do not know where they have laid Him. ”
NKJV	John	20	3	( F ) Peter therefore went out , and the other disciple , and were going to the tomb .
NKJV	John	20	4	So they both ran together , and the other disciple outran Peter and came to the tomb first .
NKJV	John	20	5	And he , stooping down and looking in , saw ( G ) the linen cloths lying there ; yet he did not go in .
NKJV	John	20	6	Then Simon Peter came , following him , and went into the tomb ; and he saw the linen cloths lying there ,
NKJV	John	20	7	and ( H ) the [ a ] handkerchief that had been around His head , not lying with the linen cloths , but folded together in a place by itself .
NKJV	John	20	8	Then the ( I ) other disciple , who came to the tomb first , went in also ; and he saw and believed .
NKJV	John	20	9	For as yet they did not [ b ] know the ( J ) Scripture , that He must rise again from the dead .
NKJV	John	20	10	Then the disciples went away again to their own homes . Mary Magdalene Sees the Risen Lord
NKJV	John	20	11	( K ) But Mary stood outside by the tomb weeping , and as she wept she stooped down and looked into the tomb .
NKJV	John	20	12	And she saw two angels in white sitting , one at the head and the other at the feet , where the body of Jesus had lain .
NKJV	John	20	13	Then they said to her , “ Woman , why are you weeping ? ” She said to them , “ Because they have taken away my Lord , and I do not know where they have laid Him. ”
NKJV	John	20	14	( L ) Now when she had said this , she turned around and saw Jesus standing there , and ( M ) did not know that it was Jesus .
NKJV	John	20	15	Jesus said to her , “ Woman , why are you weeping ? Whom are you seeking ? ” She , supposing Him to be the gardener , said to Him , “ Sir , if You have carried Him away , tell me where You have laid Him , and I will take Him away. ”
NKJV	John	20	16	Jesus said to her , ( N ) “ Mary ! ” She turned and said to [ c ] Him , “ Rabboni ! ” ( which is to say , Teacher ) .
NKJV	John	20	17	Jesus said to her , “ Do not cling to Me , for I have not yet ( O ) ascended to My Father ; but go to ( P ) My brethren and say to them , ( Q ) ‘ I am ascending to My Father and your Father , and to ( R ) My God and your God. ’ ”

NKJV	John	20	19	( U ) Then , the same day at evening , being the first day of the week , when the doors were shut where the disciples were [ e ] assembled , for ( V ) fear of the Jews , Jesus came and stood in the midst , and said to them , ( W ) “ Peace be with you. ”
NKJV	John	20	21	So Jesus said to them again , “ Peace to you ! ( Z ) As the Father has sent Me , I also send you. ”
NKJV	John	20	22	And when He had said this , He breathed on them , and said to them , “ Receive the Holy Spirit .
NKJV	John	20	23	( AA ) If you forgive the sins of any , they are forgiven them ; if you retain the sins of any , they are retained. ” Seeing and Believing
NKJV	John	20	24	Now Thomas , ( AB ) called the Twin , one of the twelve , was not with them when Jesus came .
NKJV	John	20	25	The other disciples therefore said to him , “ We have seen the Lord. ” So he said to them , “ Unless I see in His hands the print of the nails , and put my finger into the print of the nails , and put my hand into His side , I will not believe. ”
NKJV	John	20	26	And after eight days His disciples were again inside , and Thomas with them . Jesus came , the doors being shut , and stood in the midst , and said , “ Peace to you ! ”
NKJV	John	20	27	Then He said to Thomas , “ Reach your finger here , and look at My hands ; and ( AC ) reach your hand here , and put it into My side . Do not be ( AD ) unbelieving , but believing. ”
NKJV	John	20	28	And Thomas answered and said to Him , “ My Lord and my God ! ”
NKJV	John	20	29	Jesus said to him , [ f ] “ Thomas , because you have seen Me , you have believed . ( AE ) Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed. ” That You May Believe
NKJV	John	20	30	And ( AF ) truly Jesus did many other signs in the presence of His disciples , which are not written in this book ;
NKJV	John	20	31	( AG ) but these are written that ( AH ) you may believe that Jesus ( AI ) is the Christ , the Son of God , ( AJ ) and that believing you may have life in His name .

NKJV	John	21	21	Peter , seeing him , said to Jesus , “ But Lord , what about this man ? ”
NKJV	John	21	2	Simon Peter , ( B ) Thomas called the Twin , ( C ) Nathanael of ( D ) Cana in Galilee , ( E ) the sons of Zebedee , and two others of His disciples were together .
NKJV	John	21	3	Simon Peter said to them , “ I am going fishing. ” They said to him , “ We are going with you also. ” They went out and [ a ] immediately got into the boat , and that night they caught nothing .
NKJV	John	21	4	But when the morning had now come , Jesus stood on the shore ; yet the disciples ( F ) did not know that it was Jesus .
NKJV	John	21	5	Then ( G ) Jesus said to them , “ Children , have you any food ? ” They answered Him , “ No. ”
NKJV	John	21	6	And He said to them , ( H ) “ Cast the net on the right side of the boat , and you will find some. ” So they cast , and now they were not able to draw it in because of the multitude of fish .
NKJV	John	21	7	Therefore ( I ) that disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter , “ It is the Lord ! ” Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord , he put on his outer garment ( for he had removed it ) , and plunged into the sea .
NKJV	John	21	8	But the other disciples came in the little boat ( for they were not far from land , but about two hundred cubits ) , dragging the net with fish .
NKJV	John	21	9	Then , as soon as they had come to land , they saw a fire of coals there , and fish laid on it , and bread .
NKJV	John	21	10	Jesus said to them , “ Bring some of the fish which you have just caught. ”
NKJV	John	21	11	Simon Peter went up and dragged the net to land , full of large fish , one hundred and fifty-three ; and although there were so many , the net was not broken .
NKJV	John	21	12	Jesus said to them , ( J ) “ Come and eat breakfast. ” Yet none of the disciples dared ask Him , “ Who are You ? ” —knowing that it was the Lord .
NKJV	John	21	13	Jesus then came and took the bread and gave it to them , and likewise the fish .
NKJV	John	21	14	This is now ( K ) the third time Jesus showed Himself to His disciples after He was raised from the dead . Jesus Restores Peter
NKJV	John	21	15	So when they had eaten breakfast , Jesus said to Simon Peter , “ Simon , son of [ b ] Jonah , do you love Me more than these ? ” He said to Him , “ Yes , Lord ; You know that I [ c ] love You. ” He said to him , ( L ) “ Feed My lambs. ”
NKJV	John	21	16	He said to him again a second time , “ Simon , son of [ d ] Jonah , do you love Me ? ” He said to Him , “ Yes , Lord ; You know that I [ e ] love You. ” ( M ) He said to him , “ Tend My ( N ) sheep. ”
NKJV	John	21	17	He said to him the third time , “ Simon , son of [ f ] Jonah , do you [ g ] love Me ? ” Peter was grieved because He said to him the third time , “ Do you love Me ? ” And he said to Him , “ Lord , ( O ) You know all things ; You know that I love You. ” Jesus said to him , “ Feed My sheep .
NKJV	John	21	18	( P ) Most assuredly , I say to you , when you were younger , you girded yourself and walked where you wished ; but when you are old , you will stretch out your hands , and another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish. ”
NKJV	John	21	19	This He spoke , signifying ( Q ) by what death he would glorify God . And when He had spoken this , He said to him , ( R ) “ Follow Me. ” The Beloved Disciple and His Book
NKJV	John	21	20	Then Peter , turning around , saw the disciple ( S ) whom Jesus loved following , ( T ) who also had leaned on His breast at the supper , and said , “ Lord , who is the one who betrays You ? ”
NKJV	John	21	22	Jesus said to him , “ If I [ h ] will that he remain ( U ) till I come , what is that to you ? You follow Me. ”
NKJV	John	21	23	Then this saying went out among the brethren that this disciple would not die . Yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die , but , “ If I will that he remain till I come , what is that to you ? ”
NKJV	John	21	24	This is the disciple who ( V ) testifies of these things , and wrote these things ; and we know that his testimony is true .
NKJV	John	21	25	( W ) And there are also many other things that Jesus did , which if they were written one by one , ( X ) I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that would be written .

NKJV	Romans	1	1	Paul , a bondservant of Jesus Christ , ( A ) called to be an apostle , ( B ) separated to the gospel of God
NKJV	Romans	1	2	( C ) which He promised before ( D ) through His prophets in the Holy Scriptures ,
NKJV	Romans	1	3	concerning His Son Jesus Christ our Lord , who [ a ] was ( E ) born of the seed of David according to the flesh ,
NKJV	Romans	1	4	and ( F ) declared to be the Son of God with power according ( G ) to the Spirit of holiness , by the resurrection from the dead .
NKJV	Romans	1	5	Through Him ( H ) we have received grace and apostleship for ( I ) obedience to the faith among all nations ( J ) for His name ,
NKJV	Romans	1	6	among whom you also are the called of Jesus Christ ;
NKJV	Romans	1	7	To all who are in Rome , beloved of God , ( K ) called to be saints : ( L ) Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ . Desire to Visit Rome
NKJV	Romans	1	8	First , ( M ) I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all , that ( N ) your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world .
NKJV	Romans	1	9	For ( O ) God is my witness , ( P ) whom I serve [ b ] with my spirit in the gospel of His Son , that ( Q ) without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers ,
NKJV	Romans	1	10	making request if , by some means , now at last I may find a way in the will of God to come to you .
NKJV	Romans	1	11	For I long to see you , that ( R ) I may impart to you some spiritual gift , so that you may be established—
NKJV	Romans	1	12	that is , that I may be encouraged together with you by ( S ) the mutual faith both of you and me .
NKJV	Romans	1	13	Now I do not want you to be unaware , brethren , that I often planned to come to you ( but ( T ) was hindered until now ) , that I might have some ( U ) fruit among you also , just as among the other Gentiles .
NKJV	Romans	1	14	I am a debtor both to Greeks and to barbarians , both to wise and to unwise .
NKJV	Romans	1	15	So , as much as is in me , I am ready to preach the gospel to you who are in Rome also . The Just Live by Faith
NKJV	Romans	1	16	For ( V ) I am not ashamed of the gospel [ c ] of Christ , for ( W ) it is the power of God to salvation for everyone who believes , ( X ) for the Jew first and also for the Greek .
NKJV	Romans	1	17	For ( Y ) in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith ; as it is written , ( Z ) “ The just shall live by faith. ” God ’ s Wrath on Unrighteousness
NKJV	Romans	1	18	( AA ) For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and ( AB ) unrighteousness of men , who [ d ] suppress the truth in unrighteousness ,
NKJV	Romans	1	19	because ( AC ) what may be known of God is [ e ] manifest [ f ] in them , for ( AD ) God has shown it to them .
NKJV	Romans	1	20	For since the creation of the world ( AE ) His invisible attributes are clearly seen , being understood by the things that are made , even His eternal power and [ g ] Godhead , so that they are without excuse ,
NKJV	Romans	1	21	because , although they knew God , they did not glorify Him as God , nor were thankful , but ( AF ) became futile in their thoughts , and their foolish hearts were darkened .
NKJV	Romans	1	22	( AG ) Professing to be wise , they became fools ,
NKJV	Romans	1	23	and changed the glory of the ( AH ) incorruptible ( AI ) God into an image made like [ h ] corruptible man—and birds and four-footed animals and creeping things .
NKJV	Romans	1	24	( AJ ) Therefore God also gave them up to uncleanness , in the lusts of their hearts , ( AK ) to dishonor their bodies ( AL ) among themselves ,
NKJV	Romans	1	25	who exchanged ( AM ) the truth of God ( AN ) for the lie , and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator , who is blessed forever . Amen .
NKJV	Romans	1	26	For this reason God gave them up to ( AO ) vile passions . For even their [ i ] women exchanged the natural use for what is against nature .
NKJV	Romans	1	27	Likewise also the [ j ] men , leaving the natural use of the [ k ] woman , burned in their lust for one another , men with men committing what is shameful , and receiving in themselves the penalty of their error which was due .
NKJV	Romans	1	28	And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge , God gave them over to a debased mind , to do those things ( AP ) which are not fitting ;
NKJV	Romans	1	29	being filled with all unrighteousness , [ l ] sexual immorality , wickedness , [ m ] covetousness , [ n ] maliciousness ; full of envy , murder , strife , deceit , evil-mindedness ; they are whisperers ,
NKJV	Romans	1	30	backbiters , haters of God , violent , proud , boasters , inventors of evil things , disobedient to parents ,
NKJV	Romans	1	31	[ o ] undiscerning , untrustworthy , unloving , [ p ] unforgiving , unmerciful ;
NKJV	Romans	1	32	who , ( AQ ) knowing the righteous judgment of God , that those who practice such things ( AR ) are deserving of death , not only do the same but also ( AS ) approve of those who practice them .

NKJV	Romans	2	2	But we know that the judgment of God is according to truth against those who practice such things .
NKJV	Romans	2	3	And do you think this , O man , you who judge those practicing such things , and doing the same , that you will escape the judgment of God ?
NKJV	Romans	2	4	Or do you despise ( C ) the riches of His goodness , ( D ) forbearance , and ( E ) longsuffering , ( F ) not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance ?
NKJV	Romans	2	5	But in accordance with your hardness and your [ a ] impenitent heart ( G ) you are [ b ] treasuring up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God ,
NKJV	Romans	2	6	who ( H ) “ will render to each one according to his deeds ” :
NKJV	Romans	2	7	eternal life to those who by patient continuance in doing good seek for glory , honor , and immortality ;
NKJV	Romans	2	8	but to those who are self-seeking and ( I ) do not obey the truth , but obey unrighteousness—indignation and wrath ,
NKJV	Romans	2	9	tribulation and anguish , on every soul of man who does evil , of the Jew ( J ) first and also of the [ c ] Greek ;
NKJV	Romans	2	10	( K ) but glory , honor , and peace to everyone who works what is good , to the Jew first and also to the Greek .
NKJV	Romans	2	11	For ( L ) there is no partiality with God .
NKJV	Romans	2	12	For as many as have sinned without law will also perish without law , and as many as have sinned in the law will be judged by the law
NKJV	Romans	2	13	( for ( M ) not the hearers of the law are just in the sight of God , but the doers of the law will be justified ;
NKJV	Romans	2	14	for when Gentiles , who do not have the law , by nature do the things in the law , these , although not having the law , are a law to themselves ,
NKJV	Romans	2	15	who show the ( N ) work of the law written in their hearts , their ( O ) conscience also bearing witness , and between themselves their thoughts accusing or else excusing them )
NKJV	Romans	2	16	( P ) in the day when God will judge the secrets of men ( Q ) by Jesus Christ , ( R ) according to my gospel . The Jews Guilty as the Gentiles
NKJV	Romans	2	17	[ d ] Indeed ( S ) you are called a Jew , and ( T ) rest [ e ] on the law , ( U ) and make your boast in God ,
NKJV	Romans	2	18	and ( V ) know His will , and ( W ) approve the things that are excellent , being instructed out of the law ,
NKJV	Romans	2	19	and ( X ) are confident that you yourself are a guide to the blind , a light to those who are in darkness ,
NKJV	Romans	2	20	an instructor of the foolish , a teacher of babes , ( Y ) having the form of knowledge and truth in the law .
NKJV	Romans	2	21	( Z ) You , therefore , who teach another , do you not teach yourself ? You who preach that a man should not steal , do you steal ?
NKJV	Romans	2	22	You who say , “ Do not commit adultery , ” do you commit adultery ? You who abhor idols , ( AA ) do you rob temples ?
NKJV	Romans	2	23	You who ( AB ) make your boast in the law , do you dishonor God through breaking the law ?
NKJV	Romans	2	24	For ( AC ) “ the name of God is ( AD ) blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you , ” as it is written . Circumcision of No Avail
NKJV	Romans	2	25	( AE ) For circumcision is indeed profitable if you keep the law ; but if you are a breaker of the law , your circumcision has become uncircumcision .
NKJV	Romans	2	26	Therefore , ( AF ) if an uncircumcised man keeps the righteous requirements of the law , will not his uncircumcision be counted as circumcision ?
NKJV	Romans	2	27	And will not the physically uncircumcised , if he fulfills the law , ( AG ) judge you who , even with your [ f ] written code and circumcision , are a transgressor of the law ?
NKJV	Romans	2	28	For ( AH ) he is not a Jew who is one outwardly , nor is circumcision that which is outward in the flesh ;
NKJV	Romans	2	29	but he is a Jew ( AI ) who is one inwardly ; and ( AJ ) circumcision is that of the heart , ( AK ) in the Spirit , not in the letter ; ( AL ) whose [ g ] praise is not from men but from God .

NKJV	Romans	3	3	For what if ( B ) some did not believe ? ( C ) Will their unbelief make the faithfulness of God without effect ?
NKJV	Romans	3	2	Much in every way ! Chiefly because ( A ) to them were committed the [ a ] oracles of God .
NKJV	Romans	3	4	( D ) Certainly not ! Indeed , let ( E ) God be [ b ] true but ( F ) every man a liar . As it is written : ( G ) “ That You may be justified in Your words , And may overcome when You are judged. ”
NKJV	Romans	3	5	But if our unrighteousness demonstrates the righteousness of God , what shall we say ? Is God unjust who inflicts wrath ? ( H ) ( I speak as a man . )
NKJV	Romans	3	6	Certainly not ! For then ( I ) how will God judge the world ?
NKJV	Romans	3	7	For if the truth of God has increased through my lie to His glory , why am I also still judged as a sinner ?
NKJV	Romans	3	8	And why not say , ( J ) “ Let us do evil that good may come ” ? —as we are slanderously reported and as some affirm that we say . Their [ c ] condemnation is just . All Have Sinned ( K )
NKJV	Romans	3	9	What then ? Are we better than they ? Not at all . For we have previously charged both Jews and Greeks that ( L ) they are all under sin .
NKJV	Romans	3	10	As it is written : ( M ) “ There is none righteous , no , not one ;
NKJV	Romans	3	11	There is none who understands ; There is none who seeks after God .
NKJV	Romans	3	12	They have all turned aside ; They have together become unprofitable ; There is none who does good , no , not one. ”
NKJV	Romans	3	13	“ Their ( N ) throat is an open [ d ] tomb ; With their tongues they have practiced deceit ” ; ( O ) “ The poison of asps is under their lips ” ;
NKJV	Romans	3	14	“ Whose ( P ) mouth is full of cursing and bitterness. ”
NKJV	Romans	3	15	“ Their ( Q ) feet are swift to shed blood ;
NKJV	Romans	3	16	Destruction and misery are in their ways ;
NKJV	Romans	3	17	And the way of peace they have not known. ”
NKJV	Romans	3	18	“ There ( R ) is no fear of God before their eyes. ”
NKJV	Romans	3	19	Now we know that whatever ( S ) the law says , it says to those who are under the law , that ( T ) every mouth may be stopped , and all the world may become [ e ] guilty before God .
NKJV	Romans	3	20	Therefore ( U ) by the deeds of the law no flesh will be justified in His sight , for by the law is the knowledge of sin . God ’ s Righteousness Through Faith
NKJV	Romans	3	21	But now ( V ) the righteousness of God apart from the law is revealed , ( W ) being witnessed by the Law ( X ) and the Prophets ,
NKJV	Romans	3	22	even the righteousness of God , through faith in Jesus Christ , to all [ f ] and on all who believe . For ( Y ) there is no difference ;
NKJV	Romans	3	23	for ( Z ) all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God ,
NKJV	Romans	3	24	being justified [ g ] freely ( AA ) by His grace ( AB ) through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus ,
NKJV	Romans	3	25	whom God set forth ( AC ) as a [ h ] propitiation ( AD ) by His blood , through faith , to demonstrate His righteousness , because in His forbearance God had passed over ( AE ) the sins that were previously committed ,
NKJV	Romans	3	26	to demonstrate at the present time His righteousness , that He might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus . Boasting Excluded
NKJV	Romans	3	27	( AF ) Where is boasting then ? It is excluded . By what law ? Of works ? No , but by the law of faith .
NKJV	Romans	3	28	Therefore we conclude ( AG ) that a man is [ i ] justified by faith apart from the deeds of the law .
NKJV	Romans	3	29	Or is He the God of the Jews only ? Is He not also the God of the Gentiles ? Yes , of the Gentiles also ,
NKJV	Romans	3	30	since ( AH ) there is one God who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith .
NKJV	Romans	3	31	Do we then make void the law through faith ? Certainly not ! On the contrary , we establish the law .

NKJV	Romans	4	4	Now ( F ) to him who works , the wages are not counted [ c ] as grace but as debt . David Celebrates the Same Truth
NKJV	Romans	4	2	For if Abraham was ( D ) justified by works , he has something to boast about , but not before God .
NKJV	Romans	4	3	For what does the Scripture say ? ( E ) “ Abraham believed God , and it was [ b ] accounted to him for righteousness. ”
NKJV	Romans	4	5	But to him who ( G ) does not work but believes on Him who justifies ( H ) the ungodly , his faith is accounted for righteousness ,
NKJV	Romans	4	6	just as David also ( I ) describes the blessedness of the man to whom God imputes righteousness apart from works :
NKJV	Romans	4	7	“ Blessed ( J ) are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven , And whose sins are covered ;
NKJV	Romans	4	8	Blessed is the man to whom the Lord shall not impute sin. ” Abraham Justified Before Circumcision
NKJV	Romans	4	9	Does this blessedness then come upon the circumcised only , or upon the uncircumcised also ? For we say that faith was accounted to Abraham for righteousness .
NKJV	Romans	4	10	How then was it accounted ? While he was circumcised , or uncircumcised ? Not while circumcised , but while uncircumcised .
NKJV	Romans	4	11	And ( K ) he received the sign of circumcision , a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while still uncircumcised , that ( L ) he might be the father of all those who believe , though they are uncircumcised , that righteousness might be imputed to them also ,
NKJV	Romans	4	12	and the father of circumcision to those who not only are of the circumcision , but who also walk in the steps of the faith which our father ( M ) Abraham had while still uncircumcised . The Promise Granted Through Faith
NKJV	Romans	4	13	For the promise that he would be the ( N ) heir of the world was not to Abraham or to his seed through the law , but through the righteousness of faith .
NKJV	Romans	4	14	For ( O ) if those who are of the law are heirs , faith is made void and the promise made of no effect ,
NKJV	Romans	4	15	because ( P ) the law brings about wrath ; for where there is no law there is no transgression .
NKJV	Romans	4	16	Therefore it is of faith that it might be ( Q ) according to grace , ( R ) so that the promise might be [ d ] sure to all the seed , not only to those who are of the law , but also to those who are of the faith of Abraham , ( S ) who is the father of us all
NKJV	Romans	4	17	( as it is written , ( T ) “ I have made you a father of many nations ” ) in the presence of Him whom he believed—God , ( U ) who gives life to the dead and calls those ( V ) things which do not exist as though they did ;
NKJV	Romans	4	18	who , contrary to hope , in hope believed , so that he became the father of many nations , according to what was spoken , ( W ) “ So shall your descendants be. ”
NKJV	Romans	4	19	And not being weak in faith , ( X ) he did not consider his own body , already dead ( since he was about a hundred years old ) , ( Y ) and the deadness of Sarah ’ s womb .
NKJV	Romans	4	20	He did not waver at the promise of God through unbelief , but was strengthened in faith , giving glory to God ,
NKJV	Romans	4	21	and being fully convinced that what He had promised ( Z ) He was also able to perform .
NKJV	Romans	4	22	And therefore ( AA ) “ it was accounted to him for righteousness. ”
NKJV	Romans	4	23	Now ( AB ) it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed to him ,
NKJV	Romans	4	24	but also for us . It shall be imputed to us who believe ( AC ) in Him who raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead ,
NKJV	Romans	4	25	( AD ) who was delivered up because of our offenses , and ( AE ) was raised because of our justification .

NKJV	Romans	5	5	( I ) Now hope does not disappoint , ( J ) because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who was given to us . Christ in Our Place
NKJV	Romans	5	2	( C ) through whom also we have access by faith into this grace ( D ) in which we stand , and ( E ) rejoice in hope of the glory of God .
NKJV	Romans	5	3	And not only that , but ( F ) we also glory in tribulations , ( G ) knowing that tribulation produces [ b ] perseverance ;
NKJV	Romans	5	4	( H ) and perseverance , [ c ] character ; and character , hope .
NKJV	Romans	5	6	For when we were still without strength , [ d ] in due time ( K ) Christ died for the ungodly .
NKJV	Romans	5	7	For scarcely for a righteous man will one die ; yet perhaps for a good man someone would even dare to die .
NKJV	Romans	5	8	But ( L ) God demonstrates His own love toward us , in that while we were still sinners , Christ died for us .
NKJV	Romans	5	9	Much more then , having now been justified ( M ) by His blood , we shall be saved ( N ) from wrath through Him .
NKJV	Romans	5	10	For ( O ) if when we were enemies ( P ) we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son , much more , having been reconciled , we shall be saved ( Q ) by His life .
NKJV	Romans	5	11	And not only that , but we also ( R ) rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ , through whom we have now received the reconciliation . Death in Adam , Life in Christ ( S )
NKJV	Romans	5	12	Therefore , just as ( T ) through one man sin entered the world , and ( U ) death through sin , and thus death spread to all men , because all sinned—
NKJV	Romans	5	13	( For until the law sin was in the world , but ( V ) sin is not imputed when there is no law .
NKJV	Romans	5	14	Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses , even over those who had not sinned according to the likeness of the transgression of Adam , ( W ) who is a type of Him who was to come .
NKJV	Romans	5	15	But the free gift is not like the [ e ] offense . For if by the one man ’ s offense many died , much more the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one Man , Jesus Christ , abounded ( X ) to many .
NKJV	Romans	5	16	And the gift is not like that which came through the one who sinned . For the judgment which came from one offense resulted in condemnation , but the free gift which came from many [ f ] offenses resulted in justification .
NKJV	Romans	5	17	For if by the one man ’ s [ g ] offense death reigned through the one , much more those who receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One , Jesus Christ . )
NKJV	Romans	5	18	Therefore , as through [ h ] one man ’ s offense judgment came to all men , resulting in condemnation , even so through ( Y ) one [ i ] Man ’ s righteous act the free gift came ( Z ) to all men , resulting in justification of life .
NKJV	Romans	5	19	For as by one man ’ s disobedience many were made sinners , so also by ( AA ) one Man ’ s obedience many will be made righteous .
NKJV	Romans	5	20	Moreover ( AB ) the law entered that the offense might abound . But where sin abounded , grace ( AC ) abounded much more ,
NKJV	Romans	5	21	so that as sin reigned in death , even so grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord .

NKJV	Romans	6	6	knowing this , that ( J ) our old man was crucified with Him , that ( K ) the body of sin might be [ a ] done away with , that we should no longer be slaves of sin .
NKJV	Romans	6	2	Certainly not ! How shall we who ( B ) died to sin live any longer in it ?
NKJV	Romans	6	3	Or do you not know that ( C ) as many of us as were baptized into Christ Jesus ( D ) were baptized into His death ?
NKJV	Romans	6	4	Therefore we were ( E ) buried with Him through baptism into death , that ( F ) just as Christ was raised from the dead by ( G ) the glory of the Father , ( H ) even so we also should walk in newness of life .
NKJV	Romans	6	5	( I ) For if we have been united together in the likeness of His death , certainly we also shall be in the likeness of His resurrection ,
NKJV	Romans	6	7	For ( L ) he who has died has been [ b ] freed from sin .
NKJV	Romans	6	8	Now ( M ) if we died with Christ , we believe that we shall also live with Him ,
NKJV	Romans	6	9	knowing that ( N ) Christ , having been raised from the dead , dies no more . Death no longer has dominion over Him .
NKJV	Romans	6	10	For the death that He died , ( O ) He died to sin once for all ; but the life that He lives , ( P ) He lives to God .
NKJV	Romans	6	11	Likewise you also , [ c ] reckon yourselves to be ( Q ) dead indeed to sin , but ( R ) alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord .
NKJV	Romans	6	12	( S ) Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body , that you should obey it in its lusts .
NKJV	Romans	6	13	And do not present your ( T ) members as [ d ] instruments of unrighteousness to sin , but ( U ) present yourselves to God as being alive from the dead , and your members as instruments of righteousness to God .
NKJV	Romans	6	14	For ( V ) sin shall not have dominion over you , for you are not under law but under grace . From Slaves of Sin to Slaves of God
NKJV	Romans	6	15	What then ? Shall we sin ( W ) because we are not under law but under grace ? Certainly not !
NKJV	Romans	6	16	Do you not know that ( X ) to whom you present yourselves slaves to obey , you are that one ’ s slaves whom you obey , whether of sin leading to death , or of obedience leading to righteousness ?
NKJV	Romans	6	17	But God be thanked that though you were slaves of sin , yet you obeyed from the heart ( Y ) that form of doctrine to which you were [ e ] delivered .
NKJV	Romans	6	18	And ( Z ) having been set free from sin , you became slaves of righteousness .
NKJV	Romans	6	19	I speak in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh . For just as you presented your members as slaves of uncleanness , and of lawlessness leading to more lawlessness , so now present your members as slaves of righteousness [ f ] for holiness .
NKJV	Romans	6	20	For when you were ( AA ) slaves of sin , you were free in regard to righteousness .
NKJV	Romans	6	21	( AB ) What fruit did you have then in the things of which you are now ashamed ? For ( AC ) the end of those things is death .
NKJV	Romans	6	22	But now ( AD ) having been set free from sin , and having become slaves of God , you have your fruit [ g ] to holiness , and the end , everlasting life .
NKJV	Romans	6	23	For ( AE ) the wages of sin is death , but ( AF ) the [ h ] gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord .

NKJV	Romans	7	7	What shall we say then ? Is the law sin ? Certainly not ! On the contrary , ( H ) I would not have known sin except through the law . For I would not have known covetousness unless the law had said , ( I ) “ You shall not covet. ”
NKJV	Romans	7	2	For ( A ) the woman who has a husband is bound by the law to her husband as long as he lives . But if the husband dies , she is released from the law of her husband .
NKJV	Romans	7	3	So then ( B ) if , while her husband lives , she marries another man , she will be called an adulteress ; but if her husband dies , she is free from that law , so that she is no adulteress , though she has married another man .
NKJV	Romans	7	4	Therefore , my brethren , you also have become ( C ) dead to the law through the body of Christ , that you may be married to another—to Him who was raised from the dead , that we should ( D ) bear fruit to God .
NKJV	Romans	7	5	For when we were in the flesh , the sinful passions which were aroused by the law ( E ) were at work in our members ( F ) to bear fruit to death .
NKJV	Romans	7	6	But now we have been delivered from the law , having died to what we were held by , so that we should serve ( G ) in the newness of the Spirit and not in the oldness of the letter . Sin ’ s Advantage in the Law
NKJV	Romans	7	8	But ( J ) sin , taking opportunity by the commandment , produced in me all manner of evil desire . For ( K ) apart from the law sin was dead .
NKJV	Romans	7	9	I was alive once without the law , but when the commandment came , sin revived and I died .
NKJV	Romans	7	10	And the commandment , ( L ) which was to bring life , I found to bring death .
NKJV	Romans	7	11	For sin , taking occasion by the commandment , deceived me , and by it killed me .
NKJV	Romans	7	12	Therefore ( M ) the law is holy , and the commandment holy and just and good . Law Can not Save from Sin
NKJV	Romans	7	13	Has then what is good become death to me ? Certainly not ! But sin , that it might appear sin , was producing death in me through what is good , so that sin through the commandment might become exceedingly sinful .
NKJV	Romans	7	14	For we know that the law is spiritual , but I am carnal , ( N ) sold under sin .
NKJV	Romans	7	15	For what I am doing , I do not understand . ( O ) For what I will to do , that I do not practice ; but what I hate , that I do .
NKJV	Romans	7	16	If , then , I do what I will not to do , I agree with the law that it is good .
NKJV	Romans	7	17	But now , it is no longer I who do it , but sin that dwells in me .
NKJV	Romans	7	18	For I know that ( P ) in me ( that is , in my flesh ) nothing good dwells ; for to will is present with me , but how to perform what is good I do not find .
NKJV	Romans	7	19	For the good that I will to do , I do not do ; but the evil I will not to do , that I practice .
NKJV	Romans	7	20	Now if I do what I will not to do , it is no longer I who do it , but sin that dwells in me .
NKJV	Romans	7	21	I find then a law , that evil is present with me , the one who wills to do good .
NKJV	Romans	7	22	For I ( Q ) delight in the law of God according to ( R ) the inward man .
NKJV	Romans	7	23	But ( S ) I see another law in ( T ) my members , warring against the law of my mind , and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members .
NKJV	Romans	7	24	O wretched man that I am ! Who will deliver me ( U ) from this body of death ?
NKJV	Romans	7	25	( V ) I thank God—through Jesus Christ our Lord ! So then , with the mind I myself serve the law of God , but with the flesh the law of sin . Footnotes - Romans 7:1 rules Scripture taken from the New King James Version® . Copyright ©

NKJV	Romans	8	8	So then , those who are in the flesh can not please God .
NKJV	Romans	8	2	For ( B ) the law of ( C ) the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from ( D ) the law of sin and death .
NKJV	Romans	8	3	For ( E ) what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh , ( F ) God did by sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh , on account of sin : He condemned sin in the flesh ,
NKJV	Romans	8	4	that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who ( G ) do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit .
NKJV	Romans	8	5	For ( H ) those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh , but those who live according to the Spirit , ( I ) the things of the Spirit .
NKJV	Romans	8	6	For ( J ) to be [ b ] carnally minded is death , but to be spiritually minded is life and peace .
NKJV	Romans	8	7	Because ( K ) the [ c ] carnal mind is enmity against God ; for it is not subject to the law of God , ( L ) nor indeed can be .
NKJV	Romans	8	9	But you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit , if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you . Now if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ , he is not His .
NKJV	Romans	8	10	And if Christ is in you , the body is dead because of sin , but the Spirit is life because of righteousness .
NKJV	Romans	8	11	But if the Spirit of ( M ) Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you , ( N ) He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies [ d ] through His Spirit who dwells in you . Sonship Through the Spirit
NKJV	Romans	8	12	( O ) Therefore , brethren , we are debtors—not to the flesh , to live according to the flesh .
NKJV	Romans	8	13	For ( P ) if you live according to the flesh you will die ; but if by the Spirit you ( Q ) put to death the deeds of the body , you will live .
NKJV	Romans	8	14	For ( R ) as many as are led by the Spirit of God , these are sons of God .
NKJV	Romans	8	15	For ( S ) you did not receive the spirit of bondage again ( T ) to fear , but you received the ( U ) Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out , ( V ) “ Abba , [ e ] Father. ”
NKJV	Romans	8	16	( W ) The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God ,
NKJV	Romans	8	17	and if children , then ( X ) heirs—heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ , ( Y ) if indeed we suffer with Him , that we may also be glorified together . From Suffering to Glory
NKJV	Romans	8	18	For I consider that ( Z ) the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us .
NKJV	Romans	8	19	For ( AA ) the earnest expectation of the creation eagerly waits for the revealing of the sons of God .
NKJV	Romans	8	20	For ( AB ) the creation was subjected to futility , not willingly , but because of Him who subjected it in hope ;
NKJV	Romans	8	21	because the creation itself also will be delivered from the bondage of [ f ] corruption into the glorious ( AC ) liberty of the children of God .
NKJV	Romans	8	22	For we know that the whole creation ( AD ) groans and labors with birth pangs together until now .
NKJV	Romans	8	23	Not only that , but we also who have ( AE ) the firstfruits of the Spirit , ( AF ) even we ourselves groan ( AG ) within ourselves , eagerly waiting for the adoption , the ( AH ) redemption of our body .
NKJV	Romans	8	24	For we were saved in this hope , but ( AI ) hope that is seen is not hope ; for why does one still hope for what he sees ?
NKJV	Romans	8	25	But if we hope for what we do not see , we eagerly wait for it with perseverance .
NKJV	Romans	8	26	Likewise the Spirit also helps in our weaknesses . For ( AJ ) we do not know what we should pray for as we ought , but ( AK ) the Spirit Himself makes intercession [ g ] for us with groanings which can not be uttered .
NKJV	Romans	8	27	Now ( AL ) He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is , because He makes intercession for the saints ( AM ) according to the will of God .
NKJV	Romans	8	28	And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God , to those ( AN ) who are the called according to His purpose .
NKJV	Romans	8	29	For whom ( AO ) He foreknew , ( AP ) He also predestined ( AQ ) to be conformed to the image of His Son , ( AR ) that He might be the firstborn among many brethren .
NKJV	Romans	8	30	Moreover whom He predestined , these He also ( AS ) called ; whom He called , these He also ( AT ) justified ; and whom He justified , these He also ( AU ) glorified . God ’ s Everlasting Love
NKJV	Romans	8	31	What then shall we say to these things ? ( AV ) If God is for us , who can be against us ?
NKJV	Romans	8	32	( AW ) He who did not spare His own Son , but ( AX ) delivered Him up for us all , how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things ?
NKJV	Romans	8	33	Who shall bring a charge against God ’ s elect ? ( AY ) It is God who justifies .
NKJV	Romans	8	34	( AZ ) Who is he who condemns ? It is Christ who died , and furthermore is also risen , ( BA ) who is even at the right hand of God , ( BB ) who also makes intercession for us .
NKJV	Romans	8	35	Who shall separate us from the love of Christ ? Shall tribulation , or distress , or persecution , or famine , or nakedness , or peril , or sword ?
NKJV	Romans	8	36	As it is written : ( BC ) “ For Your sake we are killed all day long ; We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. ”
NKJV	Romans	8	37	( BD ) Yet in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us .
NKJV	Romans	8	38	For I am persuaded that neither death nor life , nor angels nor ( BE ) principalities nor powers , nor things present nor things to come ,
NKJV	Romans	8	39	nor height nor depth , nor any other created thing , shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord . Footnotes - Romans 8:1 NU omits the rest of v.

NKJV	Romans	9	9	For this is the word of promise : ( S ) “ At this time I will come and Sarah shall have a son. ”
NKJV	Romans	9	2	( B ) that I have great sorrow and continual grief in my heart .
NKJV	Romans	9	3	For ( C ) I could wish that I myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren , my [ a ] countrymen according to the flesh ,
NKJV	Romans	9	4	who are Israelites , ( D ) to whom pertain the adoption , ( E ) the glory , ( F ) the covenants , ( G ) the giving of the law , ( H ) the service of God , and ( I ) the promises ;
NKJV	Romans	9	5	( J ) of whom are the fathers and from ( K ) whom , according to the flesh , Christ came , ( L ) who is over all , the eternally blessed God . Amen . Israel ’ s Rejection and God ’ s Purpose ( M )
NKJV	Romans	9	6	( N ) But it is not that the word of God has taken no effect . For ( O ) they are not all Israel who are of Israel ,
NKJV	Romans	9	7	( P ) nor are they all children because they are the seed of Abraham ; but , ( Q ) “ In Isaac your seed shall be called. ”
NKJV	Romans	9	8	That is , those who are the children of the flesh , these are not the children of God ; but ( R ) the children of the promise are counted as the seed .
NKJV	Romans	9	10	And not only this , but when ( T ) Rebecca also had conceived by one man , even by our father Isaac
NKJV	Romans	9	11	( for the children not yet being born , nor having done any good or evil , that the purpose of God according to election might stand , not of works but of ( U ) Him who calls ) ,
NKJV	Romans	9	12	it was said to her , ( V ) “ The older shall serve the younger. ”
NKJV	Romans	9	13	As it is written , ( W ) “ Jacob I have loved , but Esau I have hated. ” Israel ’ s Rejection and God ’ s Justice
NKJV	Romans	9	14	What shall we say then ? ( X ) Is there unrighteousness with God ? Certainly not !
NKJV	Romans	9	15	For He says to Moses , ( Y ) “ I will have mercy on whomever I will have mercy , and I will have compassion on whomever I will have compassion. ”
NKJV	Romans	9	16	So then it is not of him who wills , nor of him who runs , but of God who shows mercy .
NKJV	Romans	9	17	For ( Z ) the Scripture says to the Pharaoh , ( AA ) “ For this very purpose I have raised you up , that I may show My power in you , and that My name may be declared in all the earth. ”
NKJV	Romans	9	18	Therefore He has mercy on whom He wills , and whom He wills He ( AB ) hardens .
NKJV	Romans	9	19	You will say to me then , “ Why does He still find fault ? For ( AC ) who has resisted His will ? ”
NKJV	Romans	9	20	But indeed , O man , who are you to reply against God ? ( AD ) Will the thing formed say to him who formed it , “ Why have you made me like this ? ”
NKJV	Romans	9	21	Does not the ( AE ) potter have power over the clay , from the same lump to make ( AF ) one vessel for honor and another for dishonor ?
NKJV	Romans	9	22	What if God , wanting to show His wrath and to make His power known , endured with much longsuffering ( AG ) the vessels of wrath ( AH ) prepared for destruction ,
NKJV	Romans	9	23	and that He might make known ( AI ) the riches of His glory on the vessels of mercy , which He had ( AJ ) prepared beforehand for glory ,
NKJV	Romans	9	24	even us whom He ( AK ) called , ( AL ) not of the Jews only , but also of the Gentiles ?
NKJV	Romans	9	25	As He says also in Hosea : ( AM ) “ I will call them My people , who were not My people , And her beloved , who was not beloved. ”
NKJV	Romans	9	26	“ And ( AN ) it shall come to pass in the place where it was said to them , ‘ You are not My people , ’ There they shall be called sons of the living God. ”
NKJV	Romans	9	27	Isaiah also cries out concerning Israel : ( AO ) “ Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea , ( AP ) The remnant will be saved .
NKJV	Romans	9	28	For [ b ] He will finish the work and cut it short in righteousness , ( AQ ) Because the Lord will make a short work upon the earth. ”
NKJV	Romans	9	29	And as Isaiah said before : ( AR ) “ Unless the Lord of [ c ] Sabaoth had left us a seed , ( AS ) We would have become like Sodom , And we would have been made like Gomorrah. ” Present Condition of Israel
NKJV	Romans	9	30	What shall we say then ? ( AT ) That Gentiles , who did not pursue righteousness , have attained to righteousness , ( AU ) even the righteousness of faith ;
NKJV	Romans	9	31	but Israel , ( AV ) pursuing the law of righteousness , ( AW ) has not attained to the law [ d ] of righteousness .
NKJV	Romans	9	32	Why ? Because they did not seek it by faith , but as it were , [ e ] by the works of the law . For ( AX ) they stumbled at that stumbling stone .
NKJV	Romans	9	33	As it is written : ( AY ) “ Behold , I lay in Zion a stumbling stone and rock of offense , And ( AZ ) whoever believes on Him will not be put to shame. ” Footnotes - Romans 9:3 Or relatives - Romans 9:28 NU the Lord will finish the work and cut it short upon the earth - Romans 9:29 Lit. , in Heb. , Hosts - Romans 9:31 NU omits of righteousness - Romans 9:32 NU by works , omitting of the law Scripture taken from the New King James Version® .

NKJV	Romans	10	10	For with the heart one believes unto righteousness , and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation .
NKJV	Romans	10	2	For I bear them witness ( A ) that they have a zeal for God , but not according to knowledge .
NKJV	Romans	10	3	For they being ignorant of ( B ) God ’ s righteousness , and seeking to establish their own ( C ) righteousness , have not submitted to the righteousness of God .
NKJV	Romans	10	4	For ( D ) Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes .
NKJV	Romans	10	5	For Moses writes about the righteousness which is of the law , ( E ) “ The man who does those things shall live by them. ”
NKJV	Romans	10	6	But the righteousness of faith speaks in this way , ( F ) “ Do not say in your heart , ‘ Who will ascend into heaven ? ’ ” ( that is , to bring Christ down from above )
NKJV	Romans	10	7	or , ( G ) “ ‘ Who will descend into the abyss ? ’ ” ( that is , to bring Christ up from the dead ) .
NKJV	Romans	10	8	But what does it say ? ( H ) “ The word is near you , in your mouth and in your heart ” ( that is , the word of faith which we preach ) :
NKJV	Romans	10	9	that ( I ) if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead , you will be saved .
NKJV	Romans	10	11	For the Scripture says , ( J ) “ Whoever believes on Him will not be put to shame. ”
NKJV	Romans	10	12	For ( K ) there is no distinction between Jew and Greek , for ( L ) the same Lord over all ( M ) is rich to all who call upon Him .
NKJV	Romans	10	13	For ( N ) “ whoever calls ( O ) on the name of the Lord shall be saved. ” Israel Rejects the Gospel
NKJV	Romans	10	14	How then shall they call on Him in whom they have not believed ? And how shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard ? And how shall they hear ( P ) without a preacher ?
NKJV	Romans	10	15	And how shall they preach unless they are sent ? As it is written : ( Q ) “ How beautiful are the feet of those who [ b ] preach the gospel of peace , Who bring glad tidings of good things ! ”
NKJV	Romans	10	16	But they have not all obeyed the gospel . For Isaiah says , ( R ) “ Lord , who has believed our report ? ”
NKJV	Romans	10	17	So then faith comes by hearing , and hearing by the word of God .
NKJV	Romans	10	18	But I say , have they not heard ? Yes indeed : ( S ) “ Their sound has gone out to all the earth , And their words to the ends of the world. ”
NKJV	Romans	10	19	But I say , did Israel not know ? First Moses says : ( T ) “ I will provoke you to jealousy by those who are not a nation , I will move you to anger by a ( U ) foolish nation. ”
NKJV	Romans	10	20	But Isaiah is very bold and says : ( V ) “ I was found by those who did not seek Me ; I was made manifest to those who did not ask for Me. ”
NKJV	Romans	10	21	But to Israel he says : ( W ) “ All day long I have stretched out My hands To a disobedient and contrary people. ” Footnotes - Romans 10:1 NU them - Romans 10:15 NU omits preach the gospel of peace , Who Scripture taken from the New King James Version® . Copyright ©

NKJV	Romans	11	11	I say then , have they stumbled that they should fall ? Certainly not ! But ( N ) through their [ b ] fall , to provoke them to ( O ) jealousy , salvation has come to the Gentiles .
NKJV	Romans	11	2	God has not cast away His people whom ( D ) He foreknew . Or do you not know what the Scripture says of Elijah , how he pleads with God against Israel , saying ,
NKJV	Romans	11	3	( E ) “ Lord , they have killed Your prophets and torn down Your altars , and I alone am left , and they seek my life ” ?
NKJV	Romans	11	4	But what does the divine response say to him ? ( F ) “ I have reserved for Myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal. ”
NKJV	Romans	11	5	( G ) Even so then , at this present time there is a remnant according to the election of grace .

NKJV	Romans	11	7	What then ? ( I ) Israel has not obtained what it seeks ; but the elect have obtained it , and the rest were ( J ) blinded .
NKJV	Romans	11	8	Just as it is written : ( K ) “ God has given them a spirit of stupor , ( L ) Eyes that they should not see And ears that they should not hear , To this very day. ”
NKJV	Romans	11	9	And David says : ( M ) “ Let their table become a snare and a trap , A stumbling block and a recompense to them .
NKJV	Romans	11	10	Let their eyes be darkened , so that they do not see , And bow down their back always. ” Israel ’ s Rejection Not Final
NKJV	Romans	11	12	Now if their [ c ] fall is riches for the world , and their failure riches for the Gentiles , how much more their fullness !
NKJV	Romans	11	13	For I speak to you Gentiles ; inasmuch as ( P ) I am an apostle to the Gentiles , I magnify my ministry ,
NKJV	Romans	11	14	if by any means I may provoke to jealousy those who are my flesh and ( Q ) save some of them .
NKJV	Romans	11	15	For if their being cast away is the reconciling of the world , what will their acceptance be ( R ) but life from the dead ?
NKJV	Romans	11	16	For if ( S ) the firstfruit is holy , the lump is also holy ; and if the root is holy , so are the branches .
NKJV	Romans	11	17	And if ( T ) some of the branches were broken off , ( U ) and you , being a wild olive tree , were grafted in among them , and with them became a partaker of the root and [ d ] fatness of the olive tree ,
NKJV	Romans	11	18	( V ) do not boast against the branches . But if you do boast , remember that you do not support the root , but the root supports you .
NKJV	Romans	11	19	You will say then , “ Branches were broken off that I might be grafted in. ”
NKJV	Romans	11	20	Well said . Because of ( W ) unbelief they were broken off , and you stand by faith . Do not be haughty , but fear .
NKJV	Romans	11	21	For if God did not spare the natural branches , He may not spare you either .
NKJV	Romans	11	22	Therefore consider the goodness and severity of God : on those who fell , severity ; but toward you , [ e ] goodness , ( X ) if you continue in His goodness . Otherwise ( Y ) you also will be cut off .
NKJV	Romans	11	23	And they also , ( Z ) if they do not continue in unbelief , will be grafted in , for God is able to graft them in again .
NKJV	Romans	11	24	For if you were cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature , and were grafted contrary to nature into a cultivated olive tree , how much more will these , who are natural branches , be grafted into their own olive tree ?
NKJV	Romans	11	25	For I do not desire , brethren , that you should be ignorant of this mystery , lest you should be ( AA ) wise in your own [ f ] opinion , that ( AB ) blindness in part has happened to Israel ( AC ) until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in .

NKJV	Romans	11	27	For ( AE ) this is My covenant with them , When I take away their sins. ”
NKJV	Romans	11	28	Concerning the gospel they are enemies for your sake , but concerning the election they are ( AF ) beloved for the sake of the fathers .
NKJV	Romans	11	29	For the gifts and the calling of God are ( AG ) irrevocable .
NKJV	Romans	11	30	For as you ( AH ) were once disobedient to God , yet have now obtained mercy through their disobedience ,
NKJV	Romans	11	31	even so these also have now been disobedient , that through the mercy shown you they also may obtain mercy .
NKJV	Romans	11	32	For God has [ h ] committed them ( AI ) all to disobedience , that He might have mercy on all .
NKJV	Romans	11	33	Oh , the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God ! How unsearchable are His judgments and His ways past finding out !

NKJV	Romans	12	3	For I say , ( F ) through the grace given to me , to everyone who is among you , ( G ) not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think , but to think soberly , as God has dealt ( H ) to each one a measure of faith .
NKJV	Romans	12	4	For ( I ) as we have many members in one body , but all the members do not have the same function ,
NKJV	Romans	12	5	so ( J ) we , being many , are one body in Christ , and individually members of one another .
NKJV	Romans	12	6	Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is ( K ) given to us , let us use them : if prophecy , let us ( L ) prophesy in proportion to our faith ;

NKJV	Romans	12	10	( T ) Be kindly affectionate to one another with brotherly love , ( U ) in honor giving preference to one another ;
NKJV	Romans	12	11	not lagging in diligence , fervent in spirit , serving the Lord ;

NKJV	Romans	12	18	If it is possible , as much as depends on you , ( AG ) live peaceably with all men .
NKJV	Romans	12	19	Beloved , ( AH ) do not avenge yourselves , but rather give place to wrath ; for it is written , ( AI ) “ Vengeance is Mine , I will repay , ” says the Lord .
NKJV	Romans	12	20	Therefore ( AJ ) “ If your enemy is hungry , feed him ; If he is thirsty , give him a drink ; For in so doing you will heap coals of fire on his head. ”

NKJV	Romans	13	13	( O ) Let us walk [ c ] properly , as in the day , ( P ) not in revelry and drunkenness , ( Q ) not in lewdness and lust , ( R ) not in strife and envy .
NKJV	Romans	13	2	Therefore whoever resists ( B ) the authority resists the ordinance of God , and those who resist will [ a ] bring judgment on themselves .
NKJV	Romans	13	3	For rulers are not a terror to good works , but to evil . Do you want to be unafraid of the authority ? ( C ) Do what is good , and you will have praise from the same .
NKJV	Romans	13	4	For he is God ’ s minister to you for good . But if you do evil , be afraid ; for he does not bear the sword in vain ; for he is God ’ s minister , an avenger to execute wrath on him who practices evil .
NKJV	Romans	13	5	Therefore ( D ) you must be subject , not only because of wrath ( E ) but also for conscience ’ sake .
NKJV	Romans	13	6	For because of this you also pay taxes , for they are God ’ s ministers attending continually to this very thing .
NKJV	Romans	13	7	( F ) Render therefore to all their due : taxes to whom taxes are due , customs to whom customs , fear to whom fear , honor to whom honor . Love Your Neighbor ( G )
NKJV	Romans	13	8	Owe no one anything except to love one another , for ( H ) he who loves another has fulfilled the law .
NKJV	Romans	13	9	For the commandments , ( I ) “ You shall not commit adultery , ” “ You shall not murder , ” “ You shall not steal , ” [ b ] “ You shall not bear false witness , ” “ You shall not covet , ” and if there is any other commandment , are all summed up in this saying , namely , ( J ) “ You shall love your neighbor as yourself. ”
NKJV	Romans	13	10	Love does no harm to a neighbor ; therefore ( K ) love is the fulfillment of the law . Put on Christ
NKJV	Romans	13	11	And do this , knowing the time , that now it is high time ( L ) to awake out of sleep ; for now our salvation is nearer than when we first believed .
NKJV	Romans	13	12	The night is far spent , the day is at hand . ( M ) Therefore let us cast off the works of darkness , and ( N ) let us put on the armor of light .

NKJV	Romans	14	14	I know and am convinced by the Lord Jesus ( P ) that there is nothing unclean of itself ; but to him who considers anything to be unclean , to him it is unclean .
NKJV	Romans	14	2	For one believes he ( B ) may eat all things , but he who is weak eats only vegetables .
NKJV	Romans	14	3	Let not him who eats despise him who does not eat , and ( C ) let not him who does not eat judge him who eats ; for God has received him .
NKJV	Romans	14	4	( D ) Who are you to judge another ’ s servant ? To his own master he stands or falls . Indeed , he will be made to stand , for God is able to make him stand .
NKJV	Romans	14	5	( E ) One person esteems one day above another ; another esteems every day alike . Let each be fully convinced in his own mind .
NKJV	Romans	14	6	He who ( F ) observes the day , observes it to the Lord ; [ a ] and he who does not observe the day , to the Lord he does not observe it . He who eats , eats to the Lord , for ( G ) he gives God thanks ; and he who does not eat , to the Lord he does not eat , and gives God thanks .
NKJV	Romans	14	7	For ( H ) none of us lives to himself , and no one dies to himself .
NKJV	Romans	14	8	For if we ( I ) live , we live to the Lord ; and if we die , we die to the Lord . Therefore , whether we live or die , we are the Lord ’ s .
NKJV	Romans	14	9	For ( J ) to this end Christ died [ b ] and rose and lived again , that He might be ( K ) Lord of both the dead and the living .
NKJV	Romans	14	10	But why do you judge your brother ? Or why do you show contempt for your brother ? For ( L ) we shall all stand before the judgment seat of [ c ] Christ .
NKJV	Romans	14	11	For it is written : ( M ) “ As I live , says the Lord , Every knee shall bow to Me , And every tongue shall confess to God. ”
NKJV	Romans	14	12	So then ( N ) each of us shall give account of himself to God .
NKJV	Romans	14	13	Therefore let us not judge one another [ d ] anymore , but rather resolve this , ( O ) not to put a stumbling block or a cause to fall in our brother ’ s way . The Law of Love
NKJV	Romans	14	15	Yet if your brother is grieved because of your food , you are no longer walking in love . ( Q ) Do not destroy with your food the one for whom Christ died .
NKJV	Romans	14	16	( R ) Therefore do not let your good be spoken of as evil ;
NKJV	Romans	14	17	( S ) for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking , but righteousness and ( T ) peace and joy in the Holy Spirit .
NKJV	Romans	14	18	For he who serves Christ in [ e ] these things ( U ) is acceptable to God and approved by men .
NKJV	Romans	14	19	( V ) Therefore let us pursue the things which make for peace and the things by which ( W ) one may [ f ] edify another .
NKJV	Romans	14	20	( X ) Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of food . ( Y ) All things indeed are pure , ( Z ) but it is evil for the man who eats with [ g ] offense .

NKJV	Romans	15	15	Nevertheless , brethren , I have written more boldly to you on some points , as reminding you , ( T ) because of the grace given to me by God ,
NKJV	Romans	15	2	( B ) Let each of us please his neighbor for his good , leading to [ b ] edification .
NKJV	Romans	15	3	( C ) For even Christ did not please Himself ; but as it is written , ( D ) “ The reproaches of those who reproached You fell on Me. ”
NKJV	Romans	15	4	For ( E ) whatever things were written before were written for our learning , that we through the [ c ] patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope .
NKJV	Romans	15	5	( F ) Now may the God of patience and comfort grant you to be like-minded toward one another , according to Christ Jesus ,
NKJV	Romans	15	6	that you may ( G ) with one mind and one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ . Glorify God Together
NKJV	Romans	15	7	Therefore ( H ) receive one another , just ( I ) as Christ also received [ d ] us , to the glory of God .
NKJV	Romans	15	8	Now I say that ( J ) Jesus Christ has become a [ e ] servant to the circumcision for the truth of God , ( K ) to confirm the promises made to the fathers ,
NKJV	Romans	15	9	and ( L ) that the Gentiles might glorify God for His mercy , as it is written : ( M ) “ For this reason I will confess to You among the Gentiles , And sing to Your name. ”
NKJV	Romans	15	10	And again he says : ( N ) “ Rejoice , O Gentiles , with His people ! ”
NKJV	Romans	15	11	And again : ( O ) “ Praise the Lord , all you Gentiles ! Laud Him , all you peoples ! ”
NKJV	Romans	15	12	And again , Isaiah says : ( P ) “ There shall be a root of Jesse ; And He who shall rise to reign over the Gentiles , In Him the Gentiles shall hope. ”
NKJV	Romans	15	13	Now may the God of hope fill you with all ( Q ) joy and peace in believing , that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit . From Jerusalem to Illyricum
NKJV	Romans	15	14	Now ( R ) I myself am confident concerning you , my brethren , that you also are full of goodness , ( S ) filled with all knowledge , able also to admonish [ f ] one another .
NKJV	Romans	15	16	that ( U ) I might be a minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles , ministering the gospel of God , that the ( V ) offering [ g ] of the Gentiles might be acceptable , sanctified by the Holy Spirit .
NKJV	Romans	15	17	Therefore I have reason to glory in Christ Jesus ( W ) in the things which pertain to God .
NKJV	Romans	15	18	For I will not dare to speak of any of those things ( X ) which Christ has not accomplished through me , in word and deed , ( Y ) to make the Gentiles obedient—
NKJV	Romans	15	19	( Z ) in mighty signs and wonders , by the power of the Spirit of God , so that from Jerusalem and round about to Illyricum I have fully preached the gospel of Christ .
NKJV	Romans	15	20	And so I have made it my aim to preach the gospel , not where Christ was named , ( AA ) lest I should build on another man ’ s foundation ,
NKJV	Romans	15	21	but as it is written : ( AB ) “ To whom He was not announced , they shall see ; And those who have not heard shall understand. ” Plan to Visit Rome
NKJV	Romans	15	22	For this reason ( AC ) I also have been much hindered from coming to you .
NKJV	Romans	15	23	But now no longer having a place in these parts , and ( AD ) having a great desire these many years to come to you ,
NKJV	Romans	15	24	whenever I journey to Spain , [ h ] I shall come to you . For I hope to see you on my journey , ( AE ) and to be helped on my way there by you , if first I may ( AF ) enjoy your company for a while .
NKJV	Romans	15	25	But now ( AG ) I am going to Jerusalem to [ i ] minister to the saints .
NKJV	Romans	15	26	For ( AH ) it pleased those from Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor among the saints who are in Jerusalem .
NKJV	Romans	15	27	It pleased them indeed , and they are their debtors . For ( AI ) if the Gentiles have been partakers of their spiritual things , ( AJ ) their duty is also to minister to them in material things .
NKJV	Romans	15	28	Therefore , when I have performed this and have sealed to them ( AK ) this fruit , I shall go by way of you to Spain .
NKJV	Romans	15	29	( AL ) But I know that when I come to you , I shall come in the fullness of the blessing [ j ] of the gospel of Christ .
NKJV	Romans	15	30	Now I beg you , brethren , through the Lord Jesus Christ , and ( AM ) through the love of the Spirit , ( AN ) that you strive together with me in prayers to God for me ,
NKJV	Romans	15	31	( AO ) that I may be delivered from those in Judea who [ k ] do not believe , and that ( AP ) my service for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints ,
NKJV	Romans	15	32	( AQ ) that I may come to you with joy ( AR ) by the will of God , and may ( AS ) be refreshed together with you .

NKJV	1%20Corinthians	1	2	To the church of God which is at Corinth , to those who ( D ) are [ a ] sanctified in Christ Jesus , ( E ) called to be saints , with all who in every place call on the name of Jesus Christ ( F ) our Lord , ( G ) both theirs and ours :
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	1	3	( H ) Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ . Spiritual Gifts at Corinth
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	1	4	( I ) I thank my God always concerning you for the grace of God which was given to you by Christ Jesus ,
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	1	5	that you were enriched in everything by Him ( J ) in all [ b ] utterance and all knowledge ,
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	1	6	even as ( K ) the testimony of Christ was confirmed [ c ] in you ,
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	1	7	so that you come short in no gift , eagerly ( L ) waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	1	8	( M ) who will also confirm you to the end , ( N ) that you may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	1	9	( O ) God is faithful , by whom you were called into ( P ) the fellowship of His Son , Jesus Christ our Lord . Sectarianism Is Sin
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	1	10	Now I plead with you , brethren , by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , ( Q ) that you all [ d ] speak the same thing , and that there be no [ e ] divisions among you , but that you be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	1	11	For it has been declared to me concerning you , my brethren , by those of Chloe ’ s household , that there are [ f ] contentions among you .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	1	12	Now I say this , that ( R ) each of you says , “ I am of Paul , ” or “ I am of ( S ) Apollos , ” or “ I am of ( T ) Cephas , ” or “ I am of Christ. ”
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	1	13	( U ) Is Christ divided ? Was Paul crucified for you ? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul ?
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	1	14	I thank God that I baptized ( V ) none of you except ( W ) Crispus and ( X ) Gaius ,
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	1	15	lest anyone should say that I had baptized in my own name .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	1	16	Yes , I also baptized the household of ( Y ) Stephanas . Besides , I do not know whether I baptized any other .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	1	17	For Christ did not send me to baptize , but to preach the gospel , ( Z ) not with wisdom of words , lest the cross of Christ should be made of no effect . Christ the Power and Wisdom of God ( AA )
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	1	18	For the [ g ] message of the cross is ( AB ) foolishness to ( AC ) those who are perishing , but to us ( AD ) who are being saved it is the ( AE ) power of God .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	1	19	For it is written : ( AF ) “ I will destroy the wisdom of the wise , And bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent. ”
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	1	20	( AG ) Where is the wise ? Where is the scribe ? Where is the [ h ] disputer of this age ? ( AH ) Has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world ?
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	1	21	For since , in the ( AI ) wisdom of God , the world through wisdom did not know God , it pleased God through the foolishness of the message preached to save those who believe .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	1	22	For ( AJ ) Jews request a sign , and Greeks seek after wisdom ;
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	1	23	but we preach Christ crucified , ( AK ) to the Jews a [ i ] stumbling block and to the [ j ] Greeks ( AL ) foolishness ,
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	1	24	but to those who are called , both Jews and Greeks , Christ ( AM ) the power of God and ( AN ) the wisdom of God .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	1	25	Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men , and the weakness of God is stronger than men . Glory Only in the Lord
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	1	26	For [ k ] you see your calling , brethren , ( AO ) that not many wise according to the flesh , not many mighty , not many [ l ] noble , are called .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	1	27	But ( AP ) God has chosen the foolish things of the world to put to shame the wise , and God has chosen the weak things of the world to put to shame the things which are mighty ;
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	1	28	and the [ m ] base things of the world and the things which are despised God has chosen , and the things which are not , to bring to nothing the things that are ,
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	1	29	that no flesh should glory in His presence .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	1	30	But of Him you are in Christ Jesus , who became for us wisdom from God—and ( AQ ) righteousness and sanctification and redemption—
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	1	31	that , as it is written , ( AR ) “ He who glories , let him glory in the Lord. ” Footnotes -

NKJV	1%20Corinthians	2	2	For I determined not to know anything among you ( A ) except Jesus Christ and Him crucified .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	2	3	( B ) I was with you ( C ) in weakness , in fear , and in much trembling .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	2	4	And my speech and my preaching ( D ) were not with persuasive words of [ b ] human wisdom , ( E ) but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power ,
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	2	5	that your faith should not be in the wisdom of men but in the ( F ) power of God . Spiritual Wisdom
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	2	6	However , we speak wisdom among those who are mature , yet not the wisdom of this age , nor of the rulers of this age , who are coming to nothing .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	2	7	But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery , the hidden wisdom which God [ c ] ordained before the ages for our glory ,
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	2	8	which none of the rulers of this age knew ; for ( G ) had they known , they would not have ( H ) crucified the Lord of glory .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	2	9	But as it is written : ( I ) “ Eye has not seen , nor ear heard , Nor have entered into the heart of man The things which God has prepared for those who love Him. ”
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	2	10	But ( J ) God has revealed them to us through His Spirit . For the Spirit searches all things , yes , the deep things of God .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	2	11	For what man knows the things of a man except the ( K ) spirit of the man which is in him ? ( L ) Even so no one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God .

NKJV	1%20Corinthians	2	14	( N ) But the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God , for they are foolishness to him ; nor can he know them , because they are spiritually discerned .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	2	15	But he who is spiritual judges all things , yet he himself is rightly judged by no one .

NKJV	1%20Corinthians	3	3	for you are still carnal . For where there are envy , strife , and divisions among you , are you not carnal and [ a ] behaving like mere men ?
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	3	2	I fed you with ( B ) milk and not with solid food ; ( C ) for until now you were not able to receive it , and even now you are still not able ;
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	3	4	For when one says , “ I am of Paul , ” and another , “ I am of Apollos , ” are you not carnal ? Watering , Working , Warning
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	3	5	Who then is Paul , and who is Apollos , but ( D ) ministers through whom you believed , as the Lord gave to each one ?
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	3	6	( E ) I planted , ( F ) Apollos watered , ( G ) but God gave the increase .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	3	7	So then ( H ) neither he who plants is anything , nor he who waters , but God who gives the increase .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	3	8	Now he who plants and he who waters are one , ( I ) and each one will receive his own reward according to his own labor .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	3	9	For ( J ) we are God ’ s fellow workers ; you are God ’ s field , you are ( K ) God ’ s building .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	3	10	( L ) According to the grace of God which was given to me , as a wise master builder I have laid ( M ) the foundation , and another builds on it . But let each one take heed how he builds on it .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	3	11	For no other foundation can anyone lay than ( N ) that which is laid , ( O ) which is Jesus Christ .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	3	12	Now if anyone builds on this foundation with gold , silver , precious stones , wood , hay , straw ,
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	3	13	each one ’ s work will become clear ; for the Day ( P ) will declare it , because ( Q ) it will be revealed by fire ; and the fire will test each one ’ s work , of what sort it is .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	3	14	If anyone ’ s work which he has built on it endures , he will receive a reward .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	3	15	If anyone ’ s work is burned , he will suffer loss ; but he himself will be saved , yet so as through fire .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	3	16	( R ) Do you not know that you are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you ?
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	3	17	If anyone [ b ] defiles the temple of God , God will destroy him . For the temple of God is holy , which temple you are . Avoid Worldly Wisdom
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	3	18	( S ) Let no one deceive himself . If anyone among you seems to be wise in this age , let him become a fool that he may become wise .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	3	19	For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God . For it is written , ( T ) “ He catches the wise in their own craftiness ” ;
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	3	20	and again , ( U ) “ The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise , that they are futile. ”
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	3	21	Therefore let no one boast in men . For ( V ) all things are yours :
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	3	22	whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas , or the world or life or death , or things present or things to come—all are yours .

NKJV	1%20Corinthians	4	4	For I know of nothing against myself , yet I am not justified by this ; but He who judges me is the Lord .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	4	2	Moreover it is required in stewards that one be found faithful .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	4	3	But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you or by a human [ a ] court . In fact , I do not even judge myself .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	4	5	( C ) Therefore judge nothing before the time , until the Lord comes , who will both bring to ( D ) light the hidden things of darkness and ( E ) reveal the [ b ] counsels of the hearts . ( F ) Then each one ’ s praise will come from God . Fools for Christ ’ s Sake
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	4	6	Now these things , brethren , I have figuratively transferred to myself and Apollos for your sakes , that you may learn in us not to think beyond what is written , that none of you may be [ c ] puffed up on behalf of one against the other .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	4	7	For who [ d ] makes you differ from another ? And ( G ) what do you have that you did not receive ? Now if you did indeed receive it , why do you boast as if you had not received it ?
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	4	8	You are already full ! ( H ) You are already rich ! You have reigned as kings without us—and indeed I could wish you did reign , that we also might reign with you !
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	4	9	For I think that God has displayed us , the apostles , last , as men condemned to death ; for we have been made a ( I ) spectacle [ e ] to the world , both to angels and to men .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	4	10	We are ( J ) fools for Christ ’ s sake , but you are wise in Christ ! ( K ) We are weak , but you are strong ! You are distinguished , but we are dishonored !
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	4	11	To the present hour we both hunger and thirst , and we are poorly clothed , and beaten , and homeless .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	4	12	( L ) And we labor , working with our own hands . ( M ) Being reviled , we bless ; being persecuted , we endure ;
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	4	13	being defamed , we [ f ] entreat . ( N ) We have been made as the filth of the world , the offscouring of all things until now . Paul ’ s Paternal Care
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	4	14	I do not write these things to shame you , but ( O ) as my beloved children I warn you .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	4	15	For though you might have ten thousand instructors in Christ , yet you do not have many fathers ; for ( P ) in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	4	16	Therefore I urge you , ( Q ) imitate me .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	4	17	For this reason I have sent ( R ) Timothy to you , ( S ) who is my beloved and faithful son in the Lord , who will ( T ) remind you of my ways in Christ , as I ( U ) teach everywhere ( V ) in every church .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	4	18	( W ) Now some are [ g ] puffed up , as though I were not coming to you .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	4	19	( X ) But I will come to you shortly , ( Y ) if the Lord wills , and I will know , not the word of those who are puffed up , but the power .

NKJV	1%20Corinthians	5	3	( D ) For I indeed , as absent in body but present in spirit , have already judged ( as though I were present ) him who has so done this deed .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	5	4	In the ( E ) name of our Lord Jesus Christ , when you are gathered together , along with my spirit , ( F ) with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	5	6	( I ) Your glorying is not good . Do you not know that ( J ) a little leaven leavens the whole lump ?
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	5	7	Therefore [ d ] purge out the old leaven , that you may be a new lump , since you truly are unleavened . For indeed ( K ) Christ , our ( L ) Passover , was sacrificed [ e ] for us .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	5	8	Therefore ( M ) let us keep the feast , ( N ) not with old leaven , nor ( O ) with the leaven of malice and wickedness , but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth . Immorality Must Be Judged
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	5	9	I wrote to you in my epistle ( P ) not to [ f ] keep company with sexually immoral people .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	5	10	Yet I certainly did not mean with the sexually immoral people of this world , or with the covetous , or extortioners , or idolaters , since then you would need to go ( Q ) out of the world .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	5	11	But now I have written to you not to keep company ( R ) with anyone named a brother , who is sexually immoral , or covetous , or an idolater , or a reviler , or a drunkard , or an extortioner— ( S ) not even to eat with such a person .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	5	12	For what have I to do with judging those also who are outside ? Do you not judge those who are inside ?

NKJV	1%20Corinthians	6	3	Do you not know that we shall ( C ) judge angels ? How much more , things that pertain to this life ?
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	6	4	If then you have [ a ] judgments concerning things pertaining to this life , do you appoint those who are least esteemed by the church to judge ?
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	6	5	I say this to your shame . Is it so , that there is not a wise man among you , not even one , who will be able to judge between his brethren ?
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	6	7	Now therefore , it is already an utter failure for you that you go to law against one another . ( D ) Why do you not rather accept wrong ? Why do you not rather let yourselves be cheated ?
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	6	8	No , you yourselves do wrong and cheat , and you do these things to your brethren !
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	6	9	Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God ? Do not be deceived . ( E ) Neither fornicators , nor idolaters , nor adulterers , nor [ b ] homosexuals , nor [ c ] sodomites ,
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	6	10	nor thieves , nor covetous , nor drunkards , nor revilers , nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	6	11	And such were ( F ) some of you . ( G ) But you were washed , but you were [ d ] sanctified , but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God . Glorify God in Body and Spirit
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	6	12	( H ) All things are lawful for me , but all things are not [ e ] helpful . All things are lawful for me , but I will not be brought under the power of [ f ] any .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	6	13	( I ) Foods for the stomach and the stomach for foods , but God will destroy both it and them . Now the body is not for ( J ) sexual immorality but ( K ) for the Lord , ( L ) and the Lord for the body .

NKJV	1%20Corinthians	7	7	For ( F ) I wish that all men were even as I myself . But each one has his own gift from God , one in this manner and another in that .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	7	2	Nevertheless , because of sexual immorality , let each man have his own wife , and let each woman have her own husband .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	7	3	( B ) Let the husband render to his wife the affection due her , and likewise also the wife to her husband .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	7	4	The wife does not have authority over her own body , but the husband does . And likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body , but the wife does .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	7	5	( C ) Do not deprive one another except with consent for a time , that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer ; and come together again so that ( D ) Satan does not tempt you because of your lack of self-control .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	7	6	But I say this as a concession , ( E ) not as a commandment .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	7	8	But I say to the unmarried and to the widows : ( G ) It is good for them if they remain even as I am ;
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	7	9	but ( H ) if they can not exercise self-control , let them marry . For it is better to marry than to burn with passion . Keep Your Marriage Vows
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	7	10	Now to the married I command , yet not I but the ( I ) Lord : ( J ) A wife is not to depart from her husband .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	7	11	But even if she does depart , let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband . And a husband is not to divorce his wife .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	7	12	But to the rest I , not the Lord , say : If any brother has a wife who does not believe , and she is willing to live with him , let him not divorce her .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	7	13	And a woman who has a husband who does not believe , if he is willing to live with her , let her not divorce him .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	7	14	For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife , and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband ; otherwise ( K ) your children would be unclean , but now they are holy .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	7	15	But if the unbeliever departs , let him depart ; a brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases . But God has called us ( L ) to peace .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	7	16	For how do you know , O wife , whether you will ( M ) save your husband ? Or how do you know , O husband , whether you will save your wife ? Live as You Are Called
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	7	17	But as God has distributed to each one , as the Lord has called each one , so let him walk . And ( N ) so I [ a ] ordain in all the churches .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	7	18	Was anyone called while circumcised ? Let him not become uncircumcised . Was anyone called while uncircumcised ? ( O ) Let him not be circumcised .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	7	19	( P ) Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing , but ( Q ) keeping the commandments of God is what matters .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	7	20	Let each one remain in the same calling in which he was called .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	7	21	Were you called while a slave ? Do not be concerned about it ; but if you can be made free , rather use it .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	7	22	For he who is called in the Lord while a slave is ( R ) the Lord ’ s freedman . Likewise he who is called while free is ( S ) Christ ’ s slave .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	7	23	( T ) You were bought at a price ; do not become slaves of men .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	7	24	Brethren , let each one remain with ( U ) God in that state in which he was called . To the Unmarried and Widows
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	7	25	Now concerning virgins : ( V ) I have no commandment from the Lord ; yet I give judgment as one ( W ) whom the Lord in His mercy has made ( X ) trustworthy .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	7	26	I suppose therefore that this is good because of the present distress— ( Y ) that it is good for a man to remain as he is :
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	7	27	Are you bound to a wife ? Do not seek to be loosed . Are you loosed from a wife ? Do not seek a wife .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	7	28	But even if you do marry , you have not sinned ; and if a virgin marries , she has not sinned . Nevertheless such will have trouble in the flesh , but I would spare you .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	7	29	But ( Z ) this I say , brethren , the time is short , so that from now on even those who have wives should be as though they had none ,
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	7	30	those who weep as though they did not weep , those who rejoice as though they did not rejoice , those who buy as though they did not possess ,
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	7	31	and those who use this world as not ( AA ) misusing it . For ( AB ) the form of this world is passing away .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	7	32	But I want you to be without [ b ] care . ( AC ) He who is unmarried [ c ] cares for the things of the Lord—how he may please the Lord .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	7	33	But he who is married cares about the things of the world—how he may please his wife .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	7	34	There is a difference between a wife and a virgin . The unmarried woman ( AD ) cares about the things of the Lord , that she may be holy both in body and in spirit . But she who is married cares about the things of the world—how she may please her husband .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	7	35	And this I say for your own profit , not that I may put a leash on you , but for what is proper , and that you may serve the Lord without distraction .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	7	36	But if any man thinks he is behaving improperly toward his [ d ] virgin , if she is past the flower of youth , and thus it must be , let him do what he wishes . He does not sin ; let them marry .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	7	37	Nevertheless he who stands steadfast in his heart , having no necessity , but has power over his own will , and has so determined in his heart that he will keep his [ e ] virgin , does well .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	7	38	( AE ) So then he who gives [ f ] her in marriage does well , but he who does not give her in marriage does better .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	7	39	( AF ) A wife is bound by law as long as her husband lives ; but if her husband dies , she is at liberty to be married to whom she wishes , ( AG ) only in the Lord .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	7	40	But she is happier if she remains as she is , ( AH ) according to my judgment—and ( AI ) I think I also have the Spirit of God . Footnotes -

NKJV	1%20Corinthians	8	8	But ( O ) food does not commend us to God ; for neither if we eat are we the better , nor if we do not eat are we the worse .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	8	2	And ( D ) if anyone thinks that he knows anything , he knows nothing yet as he ought to know .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	8	3	But if anyone loves God , this one is known by Him .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	8	4	Therefore concerning the eating of things offered to idols , we know that ( E ) an idol is nothing in the world , ( F ) and that there is no other God but one .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	8	5	For even if there are ( G ) so-called gods , whether in heaven or on earth ( as there are many gods and many lords ) ,
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	8	6	yet ( H ) for us there is one God , the Father , ( I ) of whom are all things , and we for Him ; and ( J ) one Lord Jesus Christ , ( K ) through whom are all things , and ( L ) through whom we live .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	8	7	However , there is not in everyone that knowledge ; for some , ( M ) with consciousness of the idol , until now eat it as a thing offered to an idol ; and their conscience , being weak , is ( N ) defiled .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	8	9	But ( P ) beware lest somehow this liberty of yours become ( Q ) a [ c ] stumbling block to those who are weak .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	8	10	For if anyone sees you who have knowledge eating in an idol ’ s temple , will not ( R ) the conscience of him who is weak be emboldened to eat those things offered to idols ?
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	8	11	And ( S ) because of your knowledge shall the weak brother perish , for whom Christ died ?
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	8	12	But ( T ) when you thus sin against the brethren , and wound their weak conscience , you sin against Christ .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	8	13	Therefore , ( U ) if food makes my brother stumble , I will never again eat meat , lest I make my brother stumble . Footnotes -

NKJV	1%20Corinthians	9	2	If I am not an apostle to others , yet doubtless I am to you . For you are ( D ) the [ a ] seal of my apostleship in the Lord .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	9	3	My defense to those who examine me is this :
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	9	4	( E ) Do we have no [ b ] right to eat and drink ?
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	9	5	Do we have no right to take along [ c ] a believing wife , as do also the other apostles , ( F ) the brothers of the Lord , and ( G ) Cephas ?
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	9	6	Or is it only Barnabas and I ( H ) who have no right to refrain from working ?
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	9	7	Who ever ( I ) goes to war at his own expense ? Who ( J ) plants a vineyard and does not eat of its fruit ? Or who ( K ) tends a flock and does not drink of the milk of the flock ?
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	9	8	Do I say these things as a mere man ? Or does not the law say the same also ?
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	9	10	Or does He say it altogether for our sakes ? For our sakes , no doubt , this is written , that ( M ) he who plows should plow in hope , and he who threshes in hope should be partaker of his hope .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	9	11	( N ) If we have sown spiritual things for you , is it a great thing if we reap your material things ?
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	9	12	If others are partakers of this right over you , are we not even more ? ( O ) Nevertheless we have not used this right , but endure all things ( P ) lest we hinder the gospel of Christ .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	9	13	( Q ) Do you not know that those who minister the holy things eat of the things of the ( R ) temple , and those who serve at the altar partake of the offerings of the altar ?
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	9	14	Even so ( S ) the Lord has commanded ( T ) that those who preach the gospel should live from the gospel .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	9	15	But ( U ) I have used none of these things , nor have I written these things that it should be done so to me ; for ( V ) it would be better for me to die than that anyone should make my boasting void .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	9	16	For if I preach the gospel , I have nothing to boast of , for ( W ) necessity is laid upon me ; yes , woe is me if I do not preach the gospel !
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	9	17	For if I do this willingly , ( X ) I have a reward ; but if against my will , ( Y ) I have been entrusted with a stewardship .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	9	18	What is my reward then ? That ( Z ) when I preach the gospel , I may present the gospel [ d ] of Christ without charge , that I ( AA ) may not abuse my authority in the gospel . Serving All Men
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	9	19	For though I am ( AB ) free from all men , ( AC ) I have made myself a servant to all , ( AD ) that I might win the more ;
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	9	20	and ( AE ) to the Jews I became as a Jew , that I might win Jews ; to those who are under the law , as under the [ e ] law , that I might win those who are under the law ;
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	9	21	( AF ) to ( AG ) those who are without law , as without law ( AH ) ( not being without [ f ] law toward God , but under [ g ] law toward Christ ) , that I might win those who are without law ;
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	9	22	( AI ) to the weak I became [ h ] as weak , that I might win the weak . ( AJ ) I have become all things to all men , ( AK ) that I might by all means save some .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	9	23	Now this I do for the gospel ’ s sake , that I may be partaker of it with you . Striving for a Crown
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	9	24	Do you not know that those who run in a race all run , but one receives the prize ? ( AL ) Run in such a way that you may [ i ] obtain it .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	9	25	And everyone who competes for the prize [ j ] is temperate in all things . Now they do it to obtain a perishable crown , but we for ( AM ) an imperishable crown .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	9	26	Therefore I run thus : ( AN ) not with uncertainty . Thus I fight : not as one who beats the air .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	9	27	( AO ) But I discipline my body and ( AP ) bring it into subjection , lest , when I have preached to others , I myself should become ( AQ ) disqualified . Footnotes -

NKJV	1%20Corinthians	10	10	nor complain , as ( N ) some of them also complained , and ( O ) were destroyed by ( P ) the destroyer .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	10	2	all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea ,
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	10	3	all ate the same ( C ) spiritual food ,
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	10	4	and all drank the same ( D ) spiritual drink . For they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them , and that Rock was Christ .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	10	5	But with most of them God was not well pleased , for their bodies ( E ) were scattered in the wilderness .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	10	6	Now these things became our examples , to the intent that we should not lust after evil things as ( F ) they also lusted .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	10	7	( G ) And do not become idolaters as were some of them . As it is written , ( H ) “ The people sat down to eat and drink , and rose up to play. ”
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	10	8	( I ) Nor let us commit sexual immorality , as ( J ) some of them did , and ( K ) in one day twenty-three thousand fell ;
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	10	9	nor let us [ a ] tempt Christ , as ( L ) some of them also tempted , and ( M ) were destroyed by serpents ;
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	10	11	Now [ b ] all these things happened to them as examples , and ( Q ) they were written for our [ c ] admonition , ( R ) upon whom the ends of the ages have come .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	10	12	Therefore ( S ) let him who thinks he stands take heed lest he fall .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	10	13	No temptation has overtaken you except such as is common to man ; but ( T ) God is faithful , ( U ) who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able , but with the temptation will also make the way of escape , that you may be able to [ d ] bear it . Flee from Idolatry
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	10	14	Therefore , my beloved , ( V ) flee from idolatry .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	10	15	I speak as to ( W ) wise men ; judge for yourselves what I say .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	10	16	( X ) The cup of blessing which we bless , is it not the [ e ] communion of the blood of Christ ? ( Y ) The bread which we break , is it not the communion of the body of Christ ?
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	10	17	For ( Z ) we , though many , are one bread and one body ; for we all partake of that one bread .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	10	18	Observe ( AA ) Israel ( AB ) after the flesh : ( AC ) Are not those who eat of the sacrifices [ f ] partakers of the altar ?
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	10	19	What am I saying then ? ( AD ) That an idol is anything , or what is offered to idols is anything ?
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	10	20	Rather , that the things which the Gentiles ( AE ) sacrifice ( AF ) they sacrifice to demons and not to God , and I do not want you to have fellowship with demons .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	10	21	( AG ) You can not drink the cup of the Lord and ( AH ) the cup of demons ; you can not partake of the ( AI ) Lord ’ s table and of the table of demons .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	10	22	Or do we ( AJ ) provoke the Lord to jealousy ? ( AK ) Are we stronger than He ? All to the Glory of God ( AL )
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	10	23	All things are lawful [ g ] for me , but not all things are ( AM ) helpful ; all things are lawful for me , but not all things [ h ] edify .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	10	24	Let no one seek his own , but each one ( AN ) the other ’ s well-being .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	10	25	( AO ) Eat whatever is sold in the meat market , asking no questions for conscience ’ sake ;
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	10	26	for ( AP ) “ the earth is the Lord ’ s , and all its fullness. ”
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	10	27	If any of those who do not believe invites you to dinner , and you desire to go , ( AQ ) eat whatever is set before you , asking no question for conscience ’ sake .

NKJV	1%20Corinthians	10	29	“ Conscience , ” I say , not your own , but that of the other . For ( AT ) why is my liberty judged by another man ’ s conscience ?
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	10	30	But if I partake with thanks , why am I evil spoken of for the food ( AU ) over which I give thanks ?
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	10	31	( AV ) Therefore , whether you eat or drink , or whatever you do , do all to the glory of God .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	10	32	( AW ) Give no offense , either to the Jews or to the Greeks or to the church of God ,
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	10	33	just ( AX ) as I also please all men in all things , not seeking my own profit , but the profit of many , that they may be saved . Footnotes -

NKJV	1%20Corinthians	11	11	Nevertheless , ( K ) neither is man independent of woman , nor woman independent of man , in the Lord .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	11	2	Now I praise you , brethren , that you remember me in all things and keep the traditions just as I delivered them to you .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	11	3	But I want you to know that ( B ) the head of every man is Christ , ( C ) the head of woman is man , and ( D ) the head of Christ is God .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	11	4	Every man praying or ( E ) prophesying , having his head covered , dishonors his head .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	11	5	But every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head , for that is one and the same as if her head were ( F ) shaved .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	11	6	For if a woman is not covered , let her also be shorn . But if it is ( G ) shameful for a woman to be shorn or shaved , let her be covered .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	11	7	For a man indeed ought not to cover his head , since ( H ) he is the image and glory of God ; but woman is the glory of man .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	11	8	For man is not from woman , but woman ( I ) from man .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	11	9	Nor was man created for the woman , but woman ( J ) for the man .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	11	10	For this reason the woman ought to have a symbol of authority on her head , because of the angels .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	11	12	For as woman came from man , even so man also comes through woman ; but all things are from God .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	11	13	Judge among yourselves . Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered ?
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	11	14	Does not even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair , it is a dishonor to him ?
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	11	15	But if a woman has long hair , it is a glory to her ; for her hair is given [ a ] to her for a covering .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	11	16	But ( L ) if anyone seems to be contentious , we have no such custom , ( M ) nor do the churches of God . Conduct at the Lord ’ s Supper
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	11	17	Now in giving these instructions I do not praise you , since you come together not for the better but for the worse .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	11	18	For first of all , when you come together as a church , ( N ) I hear that there are divisions among you , and in part I believe it .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	11	19	For ( O ) there must also be factions among you , ( P ) that those who are approved may be [ b ] recognized among you .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	11	20	Therefore when you come together in one place , it is not to eat the Lord ’ s Supper .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	11	21	For in eating , each one takes his own supper ahead of others ; and one is hungry and ( Q ) another is drunk .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	11	22	What ! Do you not have houses to eat and drink in ? Or do you despise ( R ) the church of God and ( S ) shame [ c ] those who have nothing ? What shall I say to you ? Shall I praise you in this ? I do not praise you . Institution of the Lord ’ s Supper ( T )
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	11	23	For ( U ) I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you : ( V ) that the Lord Jesus on the same night in which He was betrayed took bread ;
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	11	24	and when He had given thanks , He broke it and said , [ d ] “ Take , eat ; this is My body which is [ e ] broken for you ; do this in remembrance of Me. ”
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	11	25	In the same manner He also took the cup after supper , saying , “ This cup is the new covenant in My blood . This do , as often as you drink it , in remembrance of Me. ”
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	11	26	For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup , you proclaim the Lord ’ s death ( W ) till He comes . Examine Yourself
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	11	27	Therefore whoever eats ( X ) this bread or drinks this cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of the body and [ f ] blood of the Lord .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	11	28	But ( Y ) let a man examine himself , and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	11	29	For he who eats and drinks [ g ] in an unworthy manner eats and drinks judgment to himself , not discerning the [ h ] Lord ’ s body .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	11	30	For this reason many are weak and sick among you , and many [ i ] sleep .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	11	31	For ( Z ) if we would judge ourselves , we would not be judged .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	11	32	But when we are judged , ( AA ) we are chastened by the Lord , that we may not be condemned with the world .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	11	33	Therefore , my brethren , when you ( AB ) come together to eat , wait for one another .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	11	34	But if anyone is hungry , let him eat at home , lest you come together for judgment . And the rest I will set in order when I come . Footnotes -

NKJV	1%20Corinthians	12	12	For ( T ) as the body is one and has many members , but all the members of that one body , being many , are one body , ( U ) so also is Christ .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	12	2	You know ( B ) that [ a ] you were Gentiles , carried away to these ( C ) dumb [ b ] idols , however you were led .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	12	3	Therefore I make known to you that no one speaking by the Spirit of God calls Jesus [ c ] accursed , and ( D ) no one can say that Jesus is Lord except by the Holy Spirit .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	12	4	( E ) There are [ d ] diversities of gifts , but ( F ) the same Spirit .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	12	5	( G ) There are differences of ministries , but the same Lord .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	12	6	And there are diversities of activities , but it is the same God ( H ) who works [ e ] all in all .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	12	7	But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to each one for the profit of all :
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	12	8	for to one is given ( I ) the word of wisdom through the Spirit , to another ( J ) the word of knowledge through the same Spirit ,
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	12	9	( K ) to another faith by the same Spirit , to another ( L ) gifts of healings by [ f ] the same Spirit ,
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	12	10	( M ) to another the working of miracles , to another ( N ) prophecy , to another ( O ) discerning of spirits , to another ( P ) different kinds of tongues , to another the interpretation of tongues .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	12	11	But one and the same Spirit works all these things , ( Q ) distributing to each one individually ( R ) as He wills . Unity and Diversity in One Body ( S )
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	12	13	For ( V ) by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body— ( W ) whether Jews or Greeks , whether slaves or free—and ( X ) have all been made to drink [ g ] into one Spirit .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	12	14	For in fact the body is not one member but many .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	12	15	If the foot should say , “ Because I am not a hand , I am not of the body , ” is it therefore not of the body ?
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	12	16	And if the ear should say , “ Because I am not an eye , I am not of the body , ” is it therefore not of the body ?
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	12	17	If the whole body were an eye , where would be the hearing ? If the whole were hearing , where would be the smelling ?
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	12	18	But now ( Y ) God has set the members , each one of them , in the body ( Z ) just as He pleased .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	12	19	And if they were all one member , where would the body be ?
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	12	20	But now indeed there are many members , yet one body .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	12	21	And the eye can not say to the hand , “ I have no need of you ” ; nor again the head to the feet , “ I have no need of you. ”
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	12	22	No , much rather , those members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	12	23	And those members of the body which we think to be less honorable , on these we bestow greater honor ; and our unpresentable parts have greater modesty ,
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	12	24	but our presentable parts have no need . But God composed the body , having given greater honor to that part which lacks it ,
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	12	25	that there should be no [ h ] schism in the body , but that the members should have the same care for one another .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	12	26	And if one member suffers , all the members suffer with it ; or if one member is honored , all the members rejoice with it .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	12	27	Now ( AA ) you are the body of Christ , and ( AB ) members individually .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	12	28	And ( AC ) God has appointed these in the church : first ( AD ) apostles , second ( AE ) prophets , third teachers , after that ( AF ) miracles , then ( AG ) gifts of healings , ( AH ) helps , ( AI ) administrations , varieties of tongues .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	12	29	Are all apostles ? Are all prophets ? Are all teachers ? Are all workers of miracles ?
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	12	30	Do all have gifts of healings ? Do all speak with tongues ? Do all interpret ?
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	12	31	But ( AJ ) earnestly desire the [ i ] best gifts . And yet I show you a more excellent way . Footnotes -

NKJV	1%20Corinthians	13	13	And now abide faith , hope , love , these three ; but the greatest of these is love . Footnotes -
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	13	2	And though I have the gift of ( A ) prophecy , and understand all mysteries and all knowledge , and though I have all faith , ( B ) so that I could remove mountains , but have not love , I am nothing .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	13	3	And ( C ) though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor , and though I give my body [ a ] to be burned , but have not love , it profits me nothing .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	13	4	( D ) Love suffers long and is ( E ) kind ; love ( F ) does not envy ; love does not parade itself , is not [ b ] puffed up ;
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	13	5	does not behave rudely , ( G ) does not seek its own , is not provoked , [ c ] thinks no evil ;
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	13	6	( H ) does not rejoice in iniquity , but ( I ) rejoices in the truth ;
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	13	7	( J ) bears all things , believes all things , hopes all things , endures all things .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	13	8	Love never fails . But whether there are prophecies , they will fail ; whether there are tongues , they will cease ; whether there is knowledge , it will vanish away .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	13	9	( K ) For we know in part and we prophesy in part .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	13	10	But when that which is [ d ] perfect has come , then that which is in part will be done away .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	13	11	When I was a child , I spoke as a child , I understood as a child , I thought as a child ; but when I became a man , I put away childish things .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	13	12	For ( L ) now we see in a mirror , dimly , but then ( M ) face to face . Now I know in part , but then I shall know just as I also am known .

NKJV	1%20Corinthians	14	14	For if I pray in a tongue , my spirit prays , but my understanding is unfruitful .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	14	2	For he who ( C ) speaks in a tongue does not speak to men but to God , for no one understands him ; however , in the spirit he speaks mysteries .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	14	3	But he who prophesies speaks ( D ) edification and ( E ) exhortation and comfort to men .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	14	4	He who speaks in a tongue edifies himself , but he who prophesies edifies the church .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	14	5	I wish you all spoke with tongues , but even more that you prophesied ; [ a ] for he who prophesies is greater than he who speaks with tongues , unless indeed he interprets , that the church may receive edification . Tongues Must Be Interpreted
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	14	6	But now , brethren , if I come to you speaking with tongues , what shall I profit you unless I speak to you either by ( F ) revelation , by knowledge , by prophesying , or by teaching ?
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	14	7	Even things without life , whether flute or harp , when they make a sound , unless they make a distinction in the sounds , how will it be known what is piped or played ?
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	14	8	For if the trumpet makes an uncertain sound , who will prepare for battle ?
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	14	9	So likewise you , unless you utter by the tongue words easy to understand , how will it be known what is spoken ? For you will be speaking into the air .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	14	10	There are , it may be , so many kinds of languages in the world , and none of them is without [ b ] significance .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	14	11	Therefore , if I do not know the meaning of the language , I shall be a [ c ] foreigner to him who speaks , and he who speaks will be a foreigner to me .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	14	12	Even so you , since you are [ d ] zealous for spiritual gifts , let it be for the [ e ] edification of the church that you seek to excel .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	14	13	Therefore let him who speaks in a tongue pray that he may ( G ) interpret .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	14	15	What is the conclusion then ? I will pray with the spirit , and I will also pray with the understanding . ( H ) I will sing with the spirit , and I will also sing ( I ) with the understanding .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	14	16	Otherwise , if you bless with the spirit , how will he who occupies the place of the uninformed say “ Amen ” ( J ) at your giving of thanks , since he does not understand what you say ?
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	14	17	For you indeed give thanks well , but the other is not edified .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	14	18	I thank my God I speak with tongues more than you all ;
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	14	19	yet in the church I would rather speak five words with my understanding , that I may teach others also , than ten thousand words in a tongue . Tongues a Sign to Unbelievers
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	14	20	Brethren , ( K ) do not be children in understanding ; however , in malice ( L ) be babes , but in understanding be mature .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	14	21	( M ) In the law it is written : ( N ) “ With men of other tongues and other lips I will speak to this people ; And yet , for all that , they will not hear Me , ” says the Lord .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	14	22	Therefore tongues are for a ( O ) sign , not to those who believe but to unbelievers ; but prophesying is not for unbelievers but for those who believe .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	14	23	Therefore if the whole church comes together in one place , and all speak with tongues , and there come in those who are uninformed or unbelievers , ( P ) will they not say that you are [ f ] out of your mind ?
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	14	24	But if all prophesy , and an unbeliever or an uninformed person comes in , he is convinced by all , he is convicted by all .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	14	25	[ g ] And thus the secrets of his heart are revealed ; and so , falling down on his face , he will worship God and report ( Q ) that God is truly among you . Order in Church Meetings
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	14	26	How is it then , brethren ? Whenever you come together , each of you has a psalm , ( R ) has a teaching , has a tongue , has a revelation , has an interpretation . ( S ) Let all things be done for [ h ] edification .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	14	27	If anyone speaks in a tongue , let there be two or at the most three , each in turn , and let one interpret .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	14	28	But if there is no interpreter , let him keep silent in church , and let him speak to himself and to God .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	14	29	Let two or three prophets speak , and ( T ) let the others judge .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	14	30	But if anything is revealed to another who sits by , ( U ) let the first keep silent .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	14	31	For you can all prophesy one by one , that all may learn and all may be encouraged .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	14	32	And ( V ) the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	14	33	For God is not the author of [ i ] confusion but of peace , ( W ) as in all the churches of the saints .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	14	34	( X ) Let [ j ] your women keep silent in the churches , for they are not permitted to speak ; but they are to be submissive , as the ( Y ) law also says .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	14	35	And if they want to learn something , let them ask their own husbands at home ; for it is shameful for women to speak in church .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	14	36	Or did the word of God come originally from you ? Or was it you only that it reached ?
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	14	37	( Z ) If anyone thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual , let him acknowledge that the things which I write to you are the commandments of the Lord .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	14	38	But [ k ] if anyone is ignorant , let him be ignorant .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	14	39	Therefore , brethren , ( AA ) desire earnestly to prophesy , and do not forbid to speak with tongues .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	14	40	( AB ) Let all things be done decently and in order . Footnotes -

NKJV	1%20Corinthians	15	1	Corinthians 15:55 NU O Death , where is your victory ? O Death , where is your sting ? Scripture taken from the New King James Version® . Copyright ©
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	15	15	Yes , and we are found false witnesses of God , because ( T ) we have testified of God that He raised up Christ , whom He did not raise up—if in fact the dead do not rise .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	15	2	( D ) by which also you are saved , if you hold fast that word which I preached to you—unless ( E ) you believed in vain .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	15	3	For ( F ) I delivered to you first of all that ( G ) which I also received : that Christ died for our sins ( H ) according to the Scriptures ,
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	15	4	and that He was buried , and that He rose again the third day ( I ) according to the Scriptures ,
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	15	5	( J ) and that He was seen by [ a ] Cephas , then ( K ) by the twelve .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	15	6	After that He was seen by over five hundred brethren at once , of whom the greater part remain to the present , but some have [ b ] fallen asleep .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	15	7	After that He was seen by James , then ( L ) by all the apostles .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	15	8	( M ) Then last of all He was seen by me also , as by one born out of due time .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	15	9	For I am ( N ) the least of the apostles , who am not worthy to be called an apostle , because ( O ) I persecuted the church of God .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	15	10	But ( P ) by the grace of God I am what I am , and His grace toward me was not in vain ; but I labored more abundantly than they all , ( Q ) yet not I , but the grace of God which was with me .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	15	11	Therefore , whether it was I or they , so we preach and so you believed . The Risen Christ , Our Hope ( R )
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	15	12	Now if Christ is preached that He has been raised from the dead , how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead ?
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	15	13	But if there is no resurrection of the dead , ( S ) then Christ is not risen .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	15	14	And if Christ is not risen , then our preaching is empty and your faith is also empty .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	15	16	For if the dead do not rise , then Christ is not risen .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	15	17	And if Christ is not risen , your faith is futile ; ( U ) you are still in your sins !
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	15	18	Then also those who have [ c ] fallen ( V ) asleep in Christ have perished .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	15	19	( W ) If in this life only we have hope in Christ , we are of all men the most pitiable . The Last Enemy Destroyed
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	15	20	But now ( X ) Christ is risen from the dead , and has become ( Y ) the firstfruits of those who have [ d ] fallen asleep .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	15	21	For ( Z ) since by man came death , ( AA ) by Man also came the resurrection of the dead .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	15	22	For as in Adam all die , even so in Christ all shall ( AB ) be made alive .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	15	23	But ( AC ) each one in his own order : Christ the firstfruits , afterward those who are Christ ’ s at His coming .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	15	24	Then comes the end , when He delivers ( AD ) the kingdom to God the Father , when He puts an end to all rule and all authority and power .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	15	25	For He must reign ( AE ) till He has put all enemies under His feet .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	15	26	( AF ) The last enemy that will be destroyed is death .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	15	27	For ( AG ) “ He has put all things under His feet. ” But when He says “ all things are put under Him , ” it is evident that He who put all things under Him is excepted .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	15	28	( AH ) Now when all things are made subject to Him , then ( AI ) the Son Himself will also be subject to Him who put all things under Him , that God may be all in all . Effects of Denying the Resurrection
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	15	29	Otherwise , what will they do who are baptized for the dead , if the dead do not rise at all ? Why then are they baptized for the dead ?
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	15	30	And ( AJ ) why do we stand in [ e ] jeopardy every hour ?
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	15	31	I affirm , by ( AK ) the boasting in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord , ( AL ) I die daily .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	15	32	If , in the manner of men , ( AM ) I have fought with beasts at Ephesus , what advantage is it to me ? If the dead do not rise , ( AN ) “ Let us eat and drink , for tomorrow we die ! ”
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	15	33	Do not be deceived : ( AO ) “ Evil company corrupts good habits. ”
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	15	34	( AP ) Awake to righteousness , and do not sin ; ( AQ ) for some do not have the knowledge of God . ( AR ) I speak this to your shame . A Glorious Body
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	15	35	But someone will say , ( AS ) “ How are the dead raised up ? And with what body do they come ? ”
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	15	36	Foolish one , ( AT ) what you sow is not made alive unless it dies .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	15	37	And what you sow , you do not sow that body that shall be , but mere grain—perhaps wheat or some other grain .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	15	38	But God gives it a body as He pleases , and to each seed its own body .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	15	39	All flesh is not the same flesh , but there is one kind [ f ] of flesh of men , another flesh of animals , another of fish , and another of birds .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	15	40	There are also [ g ] celestial bodies and [ h ] terrestrial bodies ; but the glory of the celestial is one , and the glory of the terrestrial is another .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	15	41	There is one glory of the sun , another glory of the moon , and another glory of the stars ; for one star differs from another star in glory .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	15	42	( AU ) So also is the resurrection of the dead . The body is sown in corruption , it is raised in incorruption .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	15	43	( AV ) It is sown in dishonor , it is raised in glory . It is sown in weakness , it is raised in power .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	15	44	It is sown a natural body , it is raised a spiritual body . There is a natural body , and there is a spiritual body .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	15	45	And so it is written , ( AW ) “ The first man Adam became a living being. ” ( AX ) The last Adam became ( AY ) a life-giving spirit .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	15	46	However , the spiritual is not first , but the natural , and afterward the spiritual .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	15	47	( AZ ) The first man was of the earth , ( BA ) made [ i ] of dust ; the second Man is [ j ] the Lord ( BB ) from heaven .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	15	48	As was the [ k ] man of dust , so also are those who are made of dust ; ( BC ) and as is the heavenly Man , so also are those who are heavenly .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	15	49	And ( BD ) as we have borne the image of the man of dust , ( BE ) we [ l ] shall also bear the image of the heavenly Man . Our Final Victory
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	15	50	Now this I say , brethren , that ( BF ) flesh and blood can not inherit the kingdom of God ; nor does corruption inherit incorruption .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	15	51	Behold , I tell you a [ m ] mystery : ( BG ) We shall not all sleep , ( BH ) but we shall all be changed—
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	15	52	in a moment , in the twinkling of an eye , at the last trumpet . ( BI ) For the trumpet will sound , and the dead will be raised incorruptible , and we shall be changed .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	15	53	For this corruptible must put on incorruption , and ( BJ ) this mortal must put on immortality .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	15	54	So when this corruptible has put on incorruption , and this mortal has put on immortality , then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written : ( BK ) “ Death is swallowed up in victory. ”
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	15	56	The sting of death is sin , and ( BM ) the strength of sin is the law .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	15	57	( BN ) But thanks be to God , who gives us ( BO ) the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ .
NKJV	1%20Corinthians	15	58	( BP ) Therefore , my beloved brethren , be steadfast , immovable , always abounding in the work of the Lord , knowing ( BQ ) that your labor is not in vain in the Lord . Footnotes -

NKJV	2%20Corinthians	1	1	Paul , ( A ) an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God , and ( B ) Timothy our brother , To the church of God which is at Corinth , ( C ) with all the saints who are in all Achaia :
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	1	3	( E ) Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of mercies and God of all comfort ,
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	1	4	who ( F ) comforts us in all our tribulation , that we may be able to comfort those who are in any [ a ] trouble , with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	1	5	For as ( G ) the sufferings of Christ abound in us , so our [ b ] consolation also abounds through Christ .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	1	6	Now if we are afflicted , ( H ) it is for your consolation and salvation , which is effective for enduring the same sufferings which we also suffer . Or if we are comforted , it is for your consolation and salvation .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	1	7	And our hope for you is steadfast , because we know that ( I ) as you are partakers of the sufferings , so also you will partake of the consolation . Delivered from Suffering
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	1	8	For we do not want you to be ignorant , brethren , of ( J ) our [ c ] trouble which came to us in Asia : that we were burdened beyond measure , above strength , so that we despaired even of life .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	1	9	Yes , we had the sentence of death in ourselves , that we should ( K ) not trust in ourselves but in God who raises the dead ,
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	1	10	( L ) who delivered us from so great a death , and [ d ] does deliver us ; in whom we trust that He will still deliver us ,
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	1	11	you also ( M ) helping together in prayer for us , that thanks may be given by many persons on [ e ] our behalf ( N ) for the gift granted to us through many . Paul ’ s Sincerity
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	1	12	For our boasting is this : the testimony of our conscience that we conducted ourselves in the world in [ f ] simplicity and ( O ) godly sincerity , ( P ) not with fleshly wisdom but by the grace of God , and more abundantly toward you .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	1	13	For we are not writing any other things to you than what you read or understand . Now I trust you will understand , even to the end
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	1	14	( as also you have understood us in part ) , ( Q ) that we are your boast as ( R ) you also are ours , in the day of the Lord Jesus . Sparing the Church
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	1	15	And in this confidence ( S ) I intended to come to you before , that you might have ( T ) a second benefit—
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	1	16	to pass by way of you to Macedonia , ( U ) to come again from Macedonia to you , and be helped by you on my way to Judea .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	1	17	Therefore , when I was planning this , did I do it lightly ? Or the things I plan , do I plan ( V ) according to the flesh , that with me there should be Yes , Yes , and No , No ?
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	1	18	But as God is ( W ) faithful , our [ g ] word to you was not Yes and No .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	1	19	For ( X ) the Son of God , Jesus Christ , who was preached among you by us—by me , ( Y ) Silvanus , and ( Z ) Timothy—was not Yes and No , ( AA ) but in Him was Yes .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	1	20	( AB ) For all the promises of God in Him are Yes , and in Him Amen , to the glory of God through us .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	1	21	Now He who establishes us with you in Christ and ( AC ) has anointed us is God ,
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	1	22	who ( AD ) also has sealed us and ( AE ) given us the Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	1	23	Moreover ( AF ) I call God as witness against my soul , ( AG ) that to spare you I came no more to Corinth .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	1	24	Not ( AH ) that we [ h ] have dominion over your faith , but are fellow workers for your joy ; for ( AI ) by faith you stand . Footnotes -

NKJV	2%20Corinthians	2	3	And I wrote this very thing to you , lest , when I came , ( C ) I should have sorrow over those from whom I ought to have joy , ( D ) having confidence in you all that my joy is the joy of you all .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	2	4	For out of much [ a ] affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you , with many tears , ( E ) not that you should be grieved , but that you might know the love which I have so abundantly for you .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	2	5	But ( F ) if anyone has caused grief , he has not ( G ) grieved me , but all of you to some extent—not to be too severe .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	2	6	This punishment which was inflicted ( H ) by the majority is sufficient for such a man ,
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	2	7	( I ) so that , on the contrary , you ought rather to forgive and comfort him , lest perhaps such a one be swallowed up with too much sorrow .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	2	8	Therefore I urge you to reaffirm your love to him .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	2	9	For to this end I also wrote , that I might put you to the test , whether you are ( J ) obedient in all things .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	2	10	Now whom you forgive anything , I also forgive . For [ b ] if indeed I have forgiven anything , I have forgiven that one for your sakes in the presence of Christ ,
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	2	11	lest Satan should take advantage of us ; for we are not ignorant of his devices . Triumph in Christ
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	2	12	Furthermore , ( K ) when I came to Troas to preach Christ ’ s gospel , and ( L ) a [ c ] door was opened to me by the Lord ,
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	2	13	( M ) I had no rest in my spirit , because I did not find Titus my brother ; but taking my leave of them , I departed for Macedonia .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	2	14	Now thanks be to God who always leads us in triumph in Christ , and through us [ d ] diffuses the fragrance of His knowledge in every place .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	2	15	For we are to God the fragrance of Christ ( N ) among those who are being saved and ( O ) among those who are perishing .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	2	16	( P ) To the one we are the aroma of death leading to death , and to the other the aroma of life leading to life . And ( Q ) who is sufficient for these things ?
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	2	17	For we are not , as [ e ] so many , ( R ) peddling [ f ] the word of God ; but as ( S ) of sincerity , but as from God , we speak in the sight of God in Christ . Footnotes -

NKJV	2%20Corinthians	3	3	clearly you are an epistle of Christ , ( E ) ministered by us , written not with ink but by the Spirit of the living God , not ( F ) on tablets of stone but ( G ) on tablets of flesh , that is , of the heart . The Spirit , Not the Letter
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	3	4	And we have such trust through Christ toward God .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	3	5	( H ) Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think of anything as being from ourselves , but ( I ) our sufficiency is from God ,
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	3	6	who also made us sufficient as ( J ) ministers of ( K ) the new covenant , not ( L ) of the letter but of the [ a ] Spirit ; for ( M ) the letter kills , ( N ) but the Spirit gives life . Glory of the New Covenant
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	3	7	But if ( O ) the ministry of death , ( P ) written and engraved on stones , was glorious , ( Q ) so that the children of Israel could not look steadily at the face of Moses because of the glory of his countenance , which glory was passing away ,
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	3	8	how will ( R ) the ministry of the Spirit not be more glorious ?
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	3	9	For if the ministry of condemnation had glory , the ministry ( S ) of righteousness exceeds much more in glory .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	3	10	For even what was made glorious had no glory in this respect , because of the glory that excels .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	3	11	For if what is passing away was glorious , what remains is much more glorious .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	3	12	Therefore , since we have such hope , ( T ) we use great boldness of speech—
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	3	13	unlike Moses , ( U ) who put a veil over his face so that the children of Israel could not look steadily at ( V ) the end of what was passing away .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	3	14	But ( W ) their minds were blinded . For until this day the same veil remains unlifted in the reading of the Old Testament , because the veil is taken away in Christ .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	3	15	But even to this day , when Moses is read , a veil lies on their heart .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	3	16	Nevertheless ( X ) when one turns to the Lord , ( Y ) the veil is taken away .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	3	17	Now ( Z ) the Lord is the Spirit ; and where the Spirit of the Lord is , there is ( AA ) liberty .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	3	18	But we all , with unveiled face , beholding ( AB ) as in a mirror ( AC ) the glory of the Lord , ( AD ) are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory , just as [ b ] by the Spirit of the Lord . Footnotes -

NKJV	2%20Corinthians	4	3	But even if our gospel is veiled , ( D ) it is veiled to those who are perishing ,
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	4	5	( I ) For we do not preach ourselves , but Christ Jesus the Lord , and ( J ) ourselves your bondservants for Jesus ’ sake .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	4	6	For it is the God ( K ) who commanded light to shine out of darkness , who has ( L ) shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ . Cast Down but Unconquered
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	4	7	But we have this treasure in earthen vessels , ( M ) that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	4	8	We are ( N ) hard-pressed on every side , yet not crushed ; we are perplexed , but not in despair ;
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	4	9	persecuted , but not ( O ) forsaken ; ( P ) struck down , but not destroyed—
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	4	10	( Q ) always carrying about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus , ( R ) that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	4	11	For we who live ( S ) are always delivered to death for Jesus ’ sake , that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	4	12	So then death is working in us , but life in you .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	4	13	And since we have ( T ) the same spirit of faith , according to what is written , ( U ) “ I believed and therefore I spoke , ” we also believe and therefore speak ,
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	4	14	knowing that ( V ) He who raised up the Lord Jesus will also raise us up with Jesus , and will present us with you .

NKJV	2%20Corinthians	5	5	Now He who has prepared us for this very thing is God , who also ( F ) has given us the Spirit as [ c ] a guarantee .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	5	3	if indeed , ( D ) having been clothed , we shall not be found naked .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	5	4	For we who are in this tent groan , being burdened , not because we want to be unclothed , ( E ) but further clothed , that mortality may be swallowed up by life .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	5	6	So we are always confident , knowing that while we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	5	7	For ( G ) we walk by faith , not by sight .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	5	8	We are confident , yes , ( H ) well pleased rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the Lord . The Judgment Seat of Christ
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	5	9	Therefore we make it our aim , whether present or absent , to be well pleasing to Him .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	5	10	( I ) For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ , ( J ) that each one may receive the things done in the body , according to what he has done , whether good or bad .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	5	11	Knowing , therefore , ( K ) the terror of the Lord , we persuade men ; but we are well known to God , and I also trust are well known in your consciences . Be Reconciled to God
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	5	12	For ( L ) we do not commend ourselves again to you , but give you opportunity ( M ) to boast on our behalf , that you may have an answer for those who boast in appearance and not in heart .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	5	13	For ( N ) if we are beside ourselves , it is for God ; or if we are of sound mind , it is for you .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	5	14	For the love of Christ compels us , because we judge thus : that ( O ) if One died for all , then all died ;
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	5	15	and He died for all , ( P ) that those who live should live no longer for themselves , but for Him who died for them and rose again .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	5	16	( Q ) Therefore , from now on , we regard no one according to the flesh . Even though we have known Christ according to the flesh , ( R ) yet now we know Him thus no longer .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	5	17	Therefore , if anyone ( S ) is in Christ , he is ( T ) a new creation ; ( U ) old things have passed away ; behold , all things have become ( V ) new .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	5	18	Now all things are of God , ( W ) who has reconciled us to Himself through Jesus Christ , and has given us the ministry of reconciliation ,
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	5	19	that is , that ( X ) God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself , not [ d ] imputing their trespasses to them , and has committed to us the word of reconciliation .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	5	20	Now then , we are ( Y ) ambassadors for Christ , as though God were pleading through us : we implore you on Christ ’ s behalf , be reconciled to God .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	5	21	For ( Z ) He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us , that we might become ( AA ) the righteousness of God in Him . Footnotes -

NKJV	2%20Corinthians	7	7	and not only by his coming , but also by the [ a ] consolation with which he was comforted in you , when he told us of your earnest desire , your mourning , your zeal for me , so that I rejoiced even more .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	7	3	I do not say this to condemn ; for ( C ) I have said before that you are in our hearts , to die together and to live together .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	7	4	( D ) Great is my boldness of speech toward you , ( E ) great is my boasting on your behalf . ( F ) I am filled with comfort . I am exceedingly joyful in all our tribulation .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	7	5	For indeed , ( G ) when we came to Macedonia , our bodies had no rest , but ( H ) we were troubled on every side . ( I ) Outside were conflicts , inside were fears .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	7	6	Nevertheless ( J ) God , who comforts the downcast , comforted us by ( K ) the coming of Titus ,
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	7	8	For even if I made you ( L ) sorry with my letter , I do not regret it ; ( M ) though I did regret it . For I perceive that the same epistle made you sorry , though only for a while .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	7	9	Now I rejoice , not that you were made sorry , but that your sorrow led to repentance . For you were made sorry in a godly manner , that you might suffer loss from us in nothing .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	7	10	For ( N ) godly sorrow produces repentance leading to salvation , not to be regretted ; ( O ) but the sorrow of the world produces death .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	7	11	For observe this very thing , that you sorrowed in a godly manner : What diligence it produced in you , what ( P ) clearing of yourselves , what indignation , what fear , what vehement desire , what zeal , what vindication ! In all things you proved yourselves to be ( Q ) clear in this matter .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	7	12	Therefore , although I wrote to you , I did not do it for the sake of him who had done the wrong , nor for the sake of him who suffered wrong , ( R ) but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear to you . The Joy of Titus
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	7	13	Therefore we have been comforted in your comfort . And we rejoiced exceedingly more for the joy of Titus , because his spirit ( S ) has been refreshed by you all .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	7	14	For if in anything I have boasted to him about you , I am not ashamed . But as we spoke all things to you in truth , even so our boasting to Titus was found true .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	7	15	And his affections are greater for you as he remembers ( T ) the obedience of you all , how with fear and trembling you received him .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	7	16	Therefore I rejoice that ( U ) I have confidence in you in everything . Footnotes -

NKJV	2%20Corinthians	8	8	( H ) I speak not by commandment , but I am testing the sincerity of your love by the diligence of others .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	8	3	For I bear witness that according to their ability , yes , and beyond their ability , they were freely willing ,
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	8	4	imploring us with much urgency [ a ] that we would receive the gift and ( B ) the fellowship of the ministering to the saints .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	8	5	And not only as we had hoped , but they first ( C ) gave themselves to the Lord , and then to us by the ( D ) will of God .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	8	6	So ( E ) we urged Titus , that as he had begun , so he would also complete this grace in you as well .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	8	7	But as ( F ) you abound in everything—in faith , in speech , in knowledge , in all diligence , and in your love for us—see ( G ) that you abound in this grace also . Christ Our Pattern
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	8	9	For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ , ( I ) that though He was rich , yet for your sakes He became poor , that you through His poverty might become ( J ) rich .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	8	10	And in this ( K ) I give advice : ( L ) It is to your advantage not only to be doing what you began and ( M ) were desiring to do a year ago ;
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	8	11	but now you also must complete the doing of it ; that as there was a readiness to desire it , so there also may be a completion out of what you have .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	8	12	For ( N ) if there is first a willing mind , it is accepted according to what one has , and not according to what he does not have .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	8	13	For I do not mean that others should be eased and you burdened ;
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	8	14	but by an equality , that now at this time your abundance may supply their lack , that their abundance also may supply your lack—that there may be equality .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	8	15	As it is written , ( O ) “ He who gathered much had nothing left over , and he who gathered little had no lack. ” Collection for the Judean Saints
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	8	16	But thanks be to God who [ b ] puts the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	8	17	For he not only accepted the exhortation , but being more diligent , he went to you of his own accord .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	8	18	And we have sent with him ( P ) the brother whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches ,
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	8	19	and not only that , but who was also ( Q ) chosen by the churches to travel with us with this gift , which is administered by us ( R ) to the glory of the Lord Himself and to show your ready mind ,
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	8	20	avoiding this : that anyone should blame us in this lavish gift which is administered by us—
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	8	21	( S ) providing honorable things , not only in the sight of the Lord , but also in the sight of men .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	8	22	And we have sent with them our brother whom we have often proved diligent in many things , but now much more diligent , because of the great confidence which we have in you .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	8	23	If anyone inquires about ( T ) Titus , he is my partner and fellow worker concerning you . Or if our brethren are inquired about , they are ( U ) messengers [ c ] of the churches , the glory of Christ .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	8	24	Therefore show to them , [ d ] and before the churches , the proof of your love and of our ( V ) boasting on your behalf . Footnotes -

NKJV	2%20Corinthians	9	9	As it is written : ( H ) “ He has dispersed abroad , He has given to the poor ; His righteousness endures forever. ”
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	9	3	( C ) Yet I have sent the brethren , lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this respect , that , as I said , you may be ready ;
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	9	4	lest if some Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared , we ( not to mention you ! ) should be ashamed of this [ a ] confident boasting .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	9	5	Therefore I thought it necessary to [ b ] exhort the brethren to go to you ahead of time , and prepare your generous gift beforehand , which you had previously promised , that it may be ready as a matter of generosity and not as a [ c ] grudging obligation . The Cheerful Giver
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	9	6	( D ) But this I say : He who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly , and he who sows [ d ] bountifully will also reap [ e ] bountifully .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	9	7	So let each one give as he purposes in his heart , ( E ) not grudgingly or of [ f ] necessity ; for ( F ) God loves a cheerful giver .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	9	8	( G ) And God is able to make all grace abound toward you , that you , always having all sufficiency in all things , may have an abundance for every good work .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	9	10	Now [ g ] may He who ( I ) supplies seed to the sower , and bread for food , [ h ] supply and multiply the seed you have sown and increase the fruits of your ( J ) righteousness ,
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	9	11	while you are enriched in everything for all liberality , ( K ) which causes thanksgiving through us to God .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	9	12	For the administration of this service not only ( L ) supplies the needs of the saints , but also is abounding through many thanksgivings to God ,
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	9	13	while , through the proof of this ministry , they ( M ) glorify God for the obedience of your confession to the gospel of Christ , and for your liberal ( N ) sharing with them and all men ,
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	9	14	and by their prayer for you , who long for you because of the exceeding ( O ) grace of God in you .

NKJV	2%20Corinthians	10	3	For though we walk in the flesh , we do not war according to the flesh .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	10	4	( D ) For the weapons ( E ) of our warfare are not [ a ] carnal but ( F ) mighty in God ( G ) for pulling down strongholds ,
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	10	5	( H ) casting down arguments and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God , bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ ,
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	10	6	( I ) and being ready to punish all disobedience when ( J ) your obedience is fulfilled . Reality of Paul ’ s Authority
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	10	7	( K ) Do you look at things according to the outward appearance ? ( L ) If anyone is convinced in himself that he is Christ ’ s , let him again consider this in himself , that just as he is Christ ’ s , even [ b ] so ( M ) we are Christ ’ s .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	10	8	For even if I should boast somewhat more ( N ) about our authority , which the Lord gave [ c ] us for [ d ] edification and not for your destruction , ( O ) I shall not be ashamed—
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	10	9	lest I seem to terrify you by letters .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	10	11	Let such a person consider this , that what we are in word by letters when we are absent , such we will also be in deed when we are present . Limits of Paul ’ s Authority
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	10	12	( R ) For we dare not class ourselves or compare ourselves with those who commend themselves . But they , measuring themselves by themselves , and comparing themselves among themselves , are not wise .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	10	13	( S ) We , however , will not boast beyond measure , but within the limits of the sphere which God appointed us—a sphere which especially includes you .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	10	14	For we are not overextending ourselves ( as though our authority did not extend to you ) , ( T ) for it was to you that we came with the gospel of Christ ;
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	10	15	not boasting of things beyond measure , that is , ( U ) in other men ’ s labors , but having hope , that as your faith is increased , we shall be greatly enlarged by you in our sphere ,

NKJV	2%20Corinthians	10	17	But ( V ) “ he who glories , let him glory in the Lord. ”

NKJV	2%20Corinthians	11	11	Why ? ( R ) Because I do not love you ? God knows !
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	11	3	But I fear , lest somehow , as ( F ) the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness , so your minds ( G ) may be corrupted from the [ a ] simplicity that is in Christ .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	11	4	For if he who comes preaches another Jesus whom we have not preached , or if you receive a different spirit which you have not received , or a ( H ) different gospel which you have not accepted—you may well put up with it ! Paul and False Apostles
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	11	5	For I consider that ( I ) I am not at all inferior to the most eminent apostles .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	11	6	Even though ( J ) I am untrained in speech , yet I am not ( K ) in knowledge . But ( L ) we have [ b ] been thoroughly manifested among you in all things .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	11	7	Did I commit sin in [ c ] humbling myself that you might be exalted , because I preached the gospel of God to you ( M ) free of charge ?
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	11	8	I robbed other churches , taking wages from them to minister to you .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	11	9	And when I was present with you , and in need , ( N ) I was a burden to no one , for what I lacked ( O ) the brethren who came from Macedonia supplied . And in everything I kept myself from being burdensome to you , and so I will keep myself .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	11	10	( P ) As the truth of Christ is in me , ( Q ) no one shall stop me from this boasting in the regions of Achaia .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	11	12	But what I do , I will also continue to do , ( S ) that I may cut off the opportunity from those who desire an opportunity to be regarded just as we are in the things of which they boast .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	11	13	For such ( T ) are false apostles , ( U ) deceitful workers , transforming themselves into apostles of Christ .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	11	14	And no wonder ! For Satan himself transforms himself into ( V ) an angel of light .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	11	15	Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also transform themselves into ministers of righteousness , ( W ) whose end will be according to their works . Reluctant Boasting
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	11	16	I say again , let no one think me a fool . If otherwise , at least receive me as a fool , that I also may boast a little .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	11	17	What I speak , ( X ) I speak not according to the Lord , but as it were , foolishly , in this confidence of boasting .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	11	18	Seeing that many boast according to the flesh , I also will boast .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	11	19	For you put up with fools gladly , ( Y ) since you yourselves are wise !
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	11	20	For you put up with it ( Z ) if one brings you into bondage , if one devours you , if one takes from you , if one exalts himself , if one strikes you on the face .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	11	21	To our shame ( AA ) I say that we were too weak for that ! But ( AB ) in whatever anyone is bold—I speak foolishly—I am bold also . Suffering for Christ
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	11	22	Are they ( AC ) Hebrews ? So am I . Are they Israelites ? So am I . Are they the seed of Abraham ? So am I .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	11	23	Are they ministers of Christ ? —I speak as a fool—I am more : ( AD ) in labors more abundant , ( AE ) in stripes above measure , in prisons more frequently , ( AF ) in deaths often .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	11	24	From the Jews five times I received ( AG ) forty ( AH ) stripes minus one .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	11	25	Three times I was ( AI ) beaten with rods ; ( AJ ) once I was stoned ; three times I ( AK ) was shipwrecked ; a night and a day I have been in the deep ;
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	11	26	in journeys often , in perils of waters , in perils of robbers , ( AL ) in perils of my own countrymen , ( AM ) in perils of the Gentiles , in perils in the city , in perils in the wilderness , in perils in the sea , in perils among false brethren ;
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	11	27	in weariness and toil , ( AN ) in sleeplessness often , ( AO ) in hunger and thirst , in ( AP ) fastings often , in cold and nakedness—
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	11	28	besides the other things , what comes upon me daily : ( AQ ) my deep concern for all the churches .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	11	29	( AR ) Who is weak , and I am not weak ? Who is made to stumble , and I do not burn with indignation ?

NKJV	2%20Corinthians	12	12	( Q ) Truly the signs of an apostle were accomplished among you with all perseverance , in signs and ( R ) wonders and mighty ( S ) deeds .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	12	3	And I know such a man—whether in the body or out of the body I do not know , God knows—
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	12	4	how he was caught up into ( E ) Paradise and heard inexpressible words , which it is not lawful for a man to utter .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	12	5	Of such a one I will boast ; yet of myself I will not ( F ) boast , except in my infirmities .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	12	6	For though I might desire to boast , I will not be a fool ; for I will speak the truth . But I refrain , lest anyone should think of me above what he sees me to be or hears from me . The Thorn in the Flesh
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	12	7	And lest I should be exalted above measure by the abundance of the revelations , a ( G ) thorn in the flesh was given to me , ( H ) a messenger of Satan to [ b ] buffet me , lest I be exalted above measure .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	12	8	( I ) Concerning this thing I pleaded with the Lord three times that it might depart from me .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	12	9	And He said to me , “ My grace is sufficient for you , for My strength is made perfect in weakness. ” Therefore most gladly ( J ) I will rather boast in my infirmities , ( K ) that the power of Christ may rest upon me .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	12	10	Therefore ( L ) I take pleasure in infirmities , in reproaches , in needs , in persecutions , in distresses , for Christ ’ s sake . ( M ) For when I am weak , then I am strong . Signs of an Apostle
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	12	11	I have become ( N ) a fool [ c ] in boasting ; you have compelled me . For I ought to have been commended by you ; for ( O ) in nothing was I behind the most eminent apostles , though ( P ) I am nothing .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	12	13	For what is it in which you were inferior to other churches , except that I myself was not burdensome to you ? Forgive me this wrong ! Love for the Church
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	12	14	( T ) Now for the third time I am ready to come to you . And I will not be burdensome to you ; for ( U ) I do not seek yours , but you . ( V ) For the children ought not to lay up for the parents , but the parents for the children .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	12	15	And I will very gladly spend and be spent ( W ) for your souls ; though ( X ) the more abundantly I love you , the less I am loved .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	12	16	But be that as it may , ( Y ) I did not burden you . Nevertheless , being crafty , I caught you by cunning !
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	12	17	Did I take advantage of you by any of those whom I sent to you ?
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	12	18	I urged Titus , and sent our ( Z ) brother with him . Did Titus take advantage of you ? Did we not walk in the same spirit ? Did we not walk in the same steps ?
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	12	19	( AA ) Again , [ d ] do you think that we excuse ourselves to you ? ( AB ) We speak before God in Christ . ( AC ) But we do all things , beloved , for your edification .
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	12	20	For I fear lest , when I come , I shall not find you such as I wish , and that ( AD ) I shall be found by you such as you do not wish ; lest there be contentions , jealousies , outbursts of wrath , selfish ambitions , backbitings , whisperings , conceits , tumults ;
NKJV	2%20Corinthians	12	21	lest , when I come again , my God ( AE ) will humble me among you , and I shall mourn for many ( AF ) who have sinned before and have not repented of the uncleanness , ( AG ) fornication , and lewdness which they have practiced . Footnotes -

NKJV	Galatians	1	6	I marvel that you are turning away so soon ( E ) from Him who called you in the grace of Christ , to a different gospel ,
NKJV	Galatians	1	7	( F ) which is not another ; but there are some ( G ) who trouble you and want to ( H ) pervert [ a ] the gospel of Christ .

NKJV	Galatians	1	11	( O ) But I make known to you , brethren , that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man .
NKJV	Galatians	1	12	For ( P ) I neither received it from man , nor was I taught it , but it came ( Q ) through the revelation of Jesus Christ .
NKJV	Galatians	1	13	For you have heard of my former conduct in Judaism , how ( R ) I persecuted the church of God beyond measure and ( S ) tried to destroy it .
NKJV	Galatians	1	14	And I advanced in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries in my own nation , ( T ) being more exceedingly zealous ( U ) for the traditions of my fathers .

NKJV	Galatians	1	16	( W ) to reveal His Son in me , that ( X ) I might preach Him among the Gentiles , I did not immediately confer with ( Y ) flesh and blood ,

NKJV	Galatians	2	2	And I went up [ a ] by revelation , and communicated to them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles , but ( C ) privately to those who were of reputation , lest by any means ( D ) I might run , or had run , in vain .
NKJV	Galatians	2	3	Yet not even Titus who was with me , being a Greek , was compelled to be circumcised .
NKJV	Galatians	2	4	And this occurred because of ( E ) false brethren secretly brought in ( who came in by stealth to spy out our ( F ) liberty which we have in Christ Jesus , ( G ) that they might bring us into bondage ) ,
NKJV	Galatians	2	5	to whom we did not yield submission even for an hour , that ( H ) the truth of the gospel might continue with you .
NKJV	Galatians	2	6	But from those ( I ) who seemed to be something—whatever they were , it makes no difference to me ; ( J ) God [ b ] shows personal favoritism to no man—for those who seemed to be something ( K ) added nothing to me .
NKJV	Galatians	2	7	But on the contrary , ( L ) when they saw that the gospel for the uncircumcised ( M ) had been committed to me , as the gospel for the circumcised was to Peter
NKJV	Galatians	2	8	( for He who worked effectively in Peter for the apostleship to the ( N ) circumcised ( O ) also ( P ) worked effectively in me toward the Gentiles ) ,
NKJV	Galatians	2	9	and when James , [ c ] Cephas , and John , who seemed to be ( Q ) pillars , perceived ( R ) the grace that had been given to me , they gave me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship , ( S ) that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised .
NKJV	Galatians	2	10	They desired only that we should remember the poor , ( T ) the very thing which I also was eager to do . No Return to the Law
NKJV	Galatians	2	11	( U ) Now when [ d ] Peter had come to Antioch , I [ e ] withstood him to his face , because he was to be blamed ;
NKJV	Galatians	2	12	for before certain men came from James , ( V ) he would eat with the Gentiles ; but when they came , he withdrew and separated himself , fearing [ f ] those who were of the circumcision .
NKJV	Galatians	2	13	And the rest of the Jews also played the hypocrite with him , so that even Barnabas was carried away with their hypocrisy .
NKJV	Galatians	2	14	But when I saw that they were not straightforward about ( W ) the truth of the gospel , I said to Peter ( X ) before them all , ( Y ) “ If you , being a Jew , live in the manner of Gentiles and not as the Jews , [ g ] why do you compel Gentiles to live as [ h ] Jews ?
NKJV	Galatians	2	15	( Z ) We who are Jews by nature , and not ( AA ) sinners of the Gentiles ,
NKJV	Galatians	2	16	( AB ) knowing that a man is not [ i ] justified by the works of the law but ( AC ) by faith in Jesus Christ , even we have believed in Christ Jesus , that we might be justified by faith in Christ and not ( AD ) by the works of the law ; for by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified .
NKJV	Galatians	2	17	“ But if , while we seek to be justified by Christ , we ourselves also are found ( AE ) sinners , is Christ therefore a minister of sin ? Certainly not !
NKJV	Galatians	2	18	For if I build again those things which I destroyed , I make myself a transgressor .
NKJV	Galatians	2	19	For I ( AF ) through the law ( AG ) died to the law that I might ( AH ) live to God .
NKJV	Galatians	2	20	I have been ( AI ) crucified with Christ ; it is no longer I who live , but Christ lives in me ; and the life which I now live in the flesh ( AJ ) I live by faith in the Son of God , ( AK ) who loved me and gave Himself for me .
NKJV	Galatians	2	21	I do not set aside the grace of God ; for ( AL ) if righteousness comes through the law , then Christ died [ j ] in vain. ” Footnotes - Galatians 2:2 because of - Galatians 2:6 Lit . does not receive the face of a man - Galatians 2:9 Peter - Galatians 2:11 NU Cephas - Galatians 2:11 opposed - Galatians 2:12 Jewish Christians - Galatians 2:14 NU how can you - Galatians 2:14 Some interpreters stop the quotation here . - Galatians 2:16 declared righteous - Galatians 2:21 for nothing Scripture taken from the New King James Version® .

NKJV	Galatians	3	3	Are you so foolish ? ( C ) Having begun in the Spirit , are you now being made perfect by ( D ) the flesh ?
NKJV	Galatians	3	2	This only I want to learn from you : Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law , ( B ) or by the hearing of faith ?
NKJV	Galatians	3	4	( E ) Have you suffered so [ c ] many things in vain—if indeed it was in vain ?
NKJV	Galatians	3	5	Therefore He who supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles among you , does He do it by the works of the law , or by the hearing of faith ? —
NKJV	Galatians	3	6	just as Abraham ( F ) “ believed God , and it was accounted to him for righteousness. ”
NKJV	Galatians	3	7	Therefore know that only ( G ) those who are of faith are sons of Abraham .
NKJV	Galatians	3	8	And ( H ) the Scripture , foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith , preached the gospel to Abraham beforehand , saying , ( I ) “ In you all the nations shall be blessed. ”
NKJV	Galatians	3	9	So then those who are of faith are blessed with believing Abraham . The Law Brings a Curse
NKJV	Galatians	3	10	For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse ; for it is written , ( J ) “ Cursed is everyone who does not continue in all things which are written in the book of the law , to do them. ”
NKJV	Galatians	3	11	But that no one is [ d ] justified by the law in the sight of God is evident , for ( K ) “ the just shall live by faith. ”
NKJV	Galatians	3	12	Yet ( L ) the law is not of faith , but ( M ) “ the man who does them shall live by them. ”
NKJV	Galatians	3	13	( N ) Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law , having become a curse for us ( for it is written , ( O ) “ Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree ” ) ,
NKJV	Galatians	3	14	( P ) that the blessing of Abraham might come upon the ( Q ) Gentiles in Christ Jesus , that we might receive ( R ) the promise of the Spirit through faith . The Changeless Promise ( S )
NKJV	Galatians	3	15	Brethren , I speak in the manner of men : ( T ) Though it is only a man ’ s covenant , yet if it is confirmed , no one annuls or adds to it .
NKJV	Galatians	3	16	Now to Abraham and his Seed were the promises made . He does not say , “ And to seeds , ” as of many , but as of ( U ) one , ( V ) “ And to your Seed , ” who is ( W ) Christ .
NKJV	Galatians	3	17	And this I say , that the law , ( X ) which was four hundred and thirty years later , can not annul the covenant that was confirmed before by God [ e ] in Christ , ( Y ) that it should make the promise of no effect .
NKJV	Galatians	3	18	For if ( Z ) the inheritance is of the law , ( AA ) it is no longer of promise ; but God gave it to Abraham by promise . Purpose of the Law
NKJV	Galatians	3	19	What purpose then does the law serve ? ( AB ) It was added because of transgressions , till the ( AC ) Seed should come to whom the promise was made ; and it was ( AD ) appointed through angels by the hand ( AE ) of a mediator .
NKJV	Galatians	3	20	Now a mediator does not mediate for one only , ( AF ) but God is one .
NKJV	Galatians	3	21	Is the law then against the promises of God ? Certainly not ! For if there had been a law given which could have given life , truly righteousness would have been by the law .
NKJV	Galatians	3	22	But the Scripture has confined ( AG ) all under sin , ( AH ) that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe .
NKJV	Galatians	3	23	But before faith came , we were kept under guard by the law , [ f ] kept for the faith which would afterward be revealed .
NKJV	Galatians	3	24	Therefore ( AI ) the law was our [ g ] tutor to bring us to Christ , ( AJ ) that we might be justified by faith .
NKJV	Galatians	3	25	But after faith has come , we are no longer under a tutor . Sons and Heirs
NKJV	Galatians	3	26	For you ( AK ) are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus .
NKJV	Galatians	3	27	For ( AL ) as many of you as were baptized into Christ ( AM ) have put on Christ .
NKJV	Galatians	3	28	( AN ) There is neither Jew nor Greek , ( AO ) there is neither slave nor free , there is neither male nor female ; for you are all ( AP ) one in Christ Jesus .
NKJV	Galatians	3	29	And ( AQ ) if you are Christ ’ s , then you are Abraham ’ s ( AR ) seed , and ( AS ) heirs according to the promise .

NKJV	Galatians	4	4	But ( B ) when the fullness of the time had come , God sent forth His Son , ( C ) born [ a ] ( D ) of a woman , ( E ) born under the law ,
NKJV	Galatians	4	2	but is under guardians and stewards until the time appointed by the father .
NKJV	Galatians	4	3	Even so we , when we were children , ( A ) were in bondage under the elements of the world .
NKJV	Galatians	4	5	( F ) to redeem those who were under the law , ( G ) that we might receive the adoption as sons .
NKJV	Galatians	4	6	And because you are sons , God has sent forth ( H ) the Spirit of His Son into your hearts , crying out , [ b ] “ Abba , Father ! ”
NKJV	Galatians	4	7	Therefore you are no longer a slave but a son , ( I ) and if a son , then an heir [ c ] of God [ d ] through Christ . Fears for the Church
NKJV	Galatians	4	8	But then , indeed , ( J ) when you did not know God , ( K ) you served those which by nature are not gods .
NKJV	Galatians	4	9	But now ( L ) after you have known God , or rather are known by God , ( M ) how is it that you turn again to ( N ) the weak and beggarly elements , to which you desire again to be in bondage ?
NKJV	Galatians	4	10	( O ) You observe days and months and seasons and years .
NKJV	Galatians	4	11	I am afraid for you , ( P ) lest I have labored for you in vain .
NKJV	Galatians	4	12	Brethren , I urge you to become like me , for I became like you . ( Q ) You have not injured me at all .
NKJV	Galatians	4	13	You know that ( R ) because of physical infirmity I preached the gospel to you at the first .
NKJV	Galatians	4	14	And my trial which was in my flesh you did not despise or reject , but you received me ( S ) as an [ e ] angel of God , ( T ) even as Christ Jesus .
NKJV	Galatians	4	15	[ f ] What then was the blessing you enjoyed ? For I bear you witness that , if possible , you would have plucked out your own eyes and given them to me .
NKJV	Galatians	4	16	Have I therefore become your enemy because I tell you the truth ?
NKJV	Galatians	4	17	They ( U ) zealously court you , but for no good ; yes , they want to exclude you , that you may be zealous for them .
NKJV	Galatians	4	18	But it is good to be zealous in a good thing always , and not only when I am present with you .
NKJV	Galatians	4	19	( V ) My little children , for whom I labor in birth again until Christ is formed in you ,
NKJV	Galatians	4	20	I would like to be present with you now and to change my tone ; for I have doubts about you . Two Covenants ( W )
NKJV	Galatians	4	21	Tell me , you who desire to be under the law , do you not hear the law ?
NKJV	Galatians	4	22	For it is written that Abraham had two sons : ( X ) the one by a bondwoman , ( Y ) the other by a freewoman .
NKJV	Galatians	4	23	But he who was of the bondwoman ( Z ) was born according to the flesh , ( AA ) and he of the freewoman through promise ,
NKJV	Galatians	4	24	which things are symbolic . For these are [ g ] the two covenants : the one from Mount ( AB ) Sinai which gives birth to bondage , which is Hagar—
NKJV	Galatians	4	25	for this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia , and corresponds to Jerusalem which now is , and is in bondage with her children—
NKJV	Galatians	4	26	but the ( AC ) Jerusalem above is free , which is the mother of us all .
NKJV	Galatians	4	27	For it is written : ( AD ) “ Rejoice , O barren , You who do not bear ! Break forth and shout , You who are not in labor ! For the desolate has many more children Than she who has a husband. ”
NKJV	Galatians	4	28	Now ( AE ) we , brethren , as Isaac was , are ( AF ) children of promise .
NKJV	Galatians	4	29	But , as ( AG ) he who was born according to the flesh then persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit , ( AH ) even so it is now .
NKJV	Galatians	4	30	Nevertheless what does ( AI ) the Scripture say ? ( AJ ) “ Cast out the bondwoman and her son , for ( AK ) the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman. ”
NKJV	Galatians	4	31	So then , brethren , we are not children of the bondwoman but of the free .

NKJV	Galatians	5	5	For we through the Spirit eagerly ( G ) wait for the hope of righteousness by faith .
NKJV	Galatians	5	2	Indeed I , Paul , say to you that ( C ) if you become circumcised , Christ will profit you nothing .
NKJV	Galatians	5	3	And I testify again to every man who becomes circumcised ( D ) that he is [ b ] a debtor to keep the whole law .
NKJV	Galatians	5	4	( E ) You have become estranged from Christ , you who attempt to be justified by law ; ( F ) you have fallen from grace .
NKJV	Galatians	5	6	For ( H ) in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision avails anything , but ( I ) faith working through love . Love Fulfills the Law
NKJV	Galatians	5	7	You ( J ) ran well . Who hindered you from obeying the truth ?
NKJV	Galatians	5	8	This persuasion does not come from Him who calls you .
NKJV	Galatians	5	9	( K ) A little leaven leavens the whole lump .
NKJV	Galatians	5	10	I have confidence in you , in the Lord , that you will have no other mind ; but he who troubles you shall bear his judgment , whoever he is .
NKJV	Galatians	5	11	And I , brethren , if I still preach circumcision , ( L ) why do I still suffer persecution ? Then ( M ) the offense of the cross has ceased .
NKJV	Galatians	5	12	( N ) I could wish that those ( O ) who trouble you would even [ c ] cut themselves off !
NKJV	Galatians	5	13	For you , brethren , have been called to liberty ; only ( P ) do not use liberty as an ( Q ) opportunity for the flesh , but ( R ) through love serve one another .
NKJV	Galatians	5	14	For ( S ) all the law is fulfilled in one word , even in this : ( T ) “ You shall love your neighbor as yourself. ”
NKJV	Galatians	5	15	But if you bite and devour one another , beware lest you be consumed by one another ! Walking in the Spirit
NKJV	Galatians	5	16	I say then : ( U ) Walk in the Spirit , and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh .
NKJV	Galatians	5	17	For ( V ) the flesh lusts against the Spirit , and the Spirit against the flesh ; and these are contrary to one another , ( W ) so that you do not do the things that you wish .
NKJV	Galatians	5	18	But ( X ) if you are led by the Spirit , you are not under the law .
NKJV	Galatians	5	19	Now ( Y ) the works of the flesh are evident , which are : [ d ] adultery , [ e ] fornication , uncleanness , lewdness ,
NKJV	Galatians	5	20	idolatry , sorcery , hatred , contentions , jealousies , outbursts of wrath , selfish ambitions , dissensions , heresies ,
NKJV	Galatians	5	21	envy , [ f ] murders , drunkenness , revelries , and the like ; of which I tell you beforehand , just as I also told you in time past , that ( Z ) those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God .
NKJV	Galatians	5	22	But ( AA ) the fruit of the Spirit is ( AB ) love , joy , peace , longsuffering , kindness , ( AC ) goodness , ( AD ) faithfulness ,
NKJV	Galatians	5	23	[ g ] gentleness , self-control . ( AE ) Against such there is no law .
NKJV	Galatians	5	24	And those who are Christ ’ s ( AF ) have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires .
NKJV	Galatians	5	25	( AG ) If we live in the Spirit , let us also walk in the Spirit .
NKJV	Galatians	5	26	( AH ) Let us not become conceited , provoking one another , envying one another .

NKJV	Galatians	6	6	( I ) Let him who is taught the word share in all good things with him who teaches .

NKJV	Galatians	6	3	For ( D ) if anyone thinks himself to be something , when ( E ) he is nothing , he deceives himself .
NKJV	Galatians	6	4	But ( F ) let each one examine his own work , and then he will have rejoicing in himself alone , and ( G ) not in another .
NKJV	Galatians	6	5	For ( H ) each one shall bear his own load . Be Generous and Do Good
NKJV	Galatians	6	7	Do not be deceived , God is not mocked ; for ( J ) whatever a man sows , that he will also reap .
NKJV	Galatians	6	8	For he who sows to his flesh will of the flesh reap corruption , but he who sows to the Spirit will of the Spirit reap ( K ) everlasting life .
NKJV	Galatians	6	9	And ( L ) let us not grow weary while doing good , for in due season we shall reap ( M ) if we do not lose heart .
NKJV	Galatians	6	10	( N ) Therefore , as we have opportunity , ( O ) let us do good to all , ( P ) especially to those who are of the household of faith . Glory Only in the Cross
NKJV	Galatians	6	11	See with what large letters I have written to you with my own hand !
NKJV	Galatians	6	12	As many as desire to make a good showing in the flesh , these would compel you to be circumcised , ( Q ) only that they may not suffer persecution for the cross of Christ .
NKJV	Galatians	6	13	For not even those who are circumcised keep the law , but they desire to have you circumcised that they may boast in your flesh .
NKJV	Galatians	6	14	But God forbid that I should boast except in the ( R ) cross of our Lord Jesus Christ , by [ b ] whom the world has been crucified to me , and ( S ) I to the world .
NKJV	Galatians	6	15	For ( T ) in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision avails anything , but a new creation . Blessing and a Plea
NKJV	Galatians	6	16	And as many as walk according to this rule , peace and mercy be upon them , and upon the Israel of God .
NKJV	Galatians	6	17	From now on let no one trouble me , for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus .

NKJV	Ephesians	1	1	Paul , an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God , To the saints who are in Ephesus , and faithful in Christ Jesus :
NKJV	Ephesians	1	2	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ . Redemption in Christ
NKJV	Ephesians	1	3	( A ) Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ ,
NKJV	Ephesians	1	4	just as ( B ) He chose us in Him ( C ) before the foundation of the world , that we should ( D ) be holy and without blame before Him in love ,

NKJV	Ephesians	1	7	( J ) In Him we have redemption through His blood , the forgiveness of sins , according to ( K ) the riches of His grace
NKJV	Ephesians	1	8	which He made to abound toward us in all wisdom and [ b ] prudence ,

NKJV	Ephesians	1	13	In Him you also trusted , after you heard ( U ) the word of truth , the gospel of your salvation ; in whom also , having believed , ( V ) you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise ,

NKJV	Ephesians	2	4	But God , ( I ) who is rich in mercy , because of His ( J ) great love with which He loved us ,
NKJV	Ephesians	2	5	( K ) even when we were dead in trespasses , ( L ) made us alive together with Christ ( by grace you have been saved ) ,

NKJV	Ephesians	2	7	that in the ages to come He might show the exceeding riches of His grace in ( N ) His kindness toward us in Christ Jesus .

NKJV	Ephesians	2	9	not of ( R ) works , lest anyone should ( S ) boast .
NKJV	Ephesians	2	10	For we are ( T ) His workmanship , created in Christ Jesus for good works , which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them . Brought Near by His Blood
NKJV	Ephesians	2	11	Therefore remember that you , once Gentiles in the flesh—who are called Uncircumcision by what is called ( U ) the Circumcision made in the flesh by hands—
NKJV	Ephesians	2	12	that at that time you were without Christ , being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of promise , having no hope and without God in the world .
NKJV	Ephesians	2	13	But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ . Christ Our Peace
NKJV	Ephesians	2	14	For He Himself is our peace , who has made both one , and has broken down the middle wall of separation ,
NKJV	Ephesians	2	15	having abolished in His flesh the enmity , that is , the law of commandments contained in ordinances , so as to create in Himself one ( V ) new man from the two , thus making peace ,
NKJV	Ephesians	2	16	and that He might ( W ) reconcile them both to God in one body through the cross , thereby ( X ) putting to death the enmity .
NKJV	Ephesians	2	17	And He came and preached peace to you who were afar off and to those who were near .

NKJV	Ephesians	3	8	To me , ( H ) who am less than the least of all the saints , this grace was given , that I should preach among the Gentiles ( I ) the unsearchable riches of Christ ,
NKJV	Ephesians	3	9	and to make all see what is the [ b ] fellowship of the mystery , which from the beginning of the ages has been hidden in God who ( J ) created all things [ c ] through Jesus Christ ;
NKJV	Ephesians	3	10	( K ) to the intent that now ( L ) the [ d ] manifold wisdom of God might be made known by the church ( M ) to the [ e ] principalities and powers in the heavenly places ,
NKJV	Ephesians	3	11	( N ) according to the eternal purpose which He accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord ,
NKJV	Ephesians	3	12	in whom we have boldness and access ( O ) with confidence through faith in Him .
NKJV	Ephesians	3	13	( P ) Therefore I ask that you do not lose heart at my tribulations for you , ( Q ) which is your glory . Appreciation of the Mystery

NKJV	Ephesians	3	15	from whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named ,
NKJV	Ephesians	3	16	that He would grant you , ( S ) according to the riches of His glory , ( T ) to be strengthened with might through His Spirit in ( U ) the inner man ,

NKJV	Ephesians	4	4	( C ) There is one body and one Spirit , just as you were called in one hope of your calling ;
NKJV	Ephesians	4	2	with all lowliness and gentleness , with longsuffering , bearing with one another in love ,
NKJV	Ephesians	4	3	endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit ( B ) in the bond of peace .
NKJV	Ephesians	4	5	( D ) one Lord , ( E ) one faith , ( F ) one baptism ;
NKJV	Ephesians	4	6	( G ) one God and Father of all , who is above all , and ( H ) through all , and in [ c ] you all . Spiritual Gifts
NKJV	Ephesians	4	7	But ( I ) to each one of us grace was given according to the measure of Christ ’ s gift .
NKJV	Ephesians	4	8	Therefore He says : ( J ) “ When He ascended on high , He led captivity captive , And gave gifts to men. ”
NKJV	Ephesians	4	9	( K ) ( Now this , “ He ascended ” —what does it mean but that He also [ d ] first descended into the lower parts of the earth ?
NKJV	Ephesians	4	10	He who descended is also the One ( L ) who ascended far above all the heavens , ( M ) that He might fill all things . )
NKJV	Ephesians	4	11	And He Himself gave some to be apostles , some prophets , some evangelists , and some pastors and teachers ,
NKJV	Ephesians	4	12	for the equipping of the saints for the work of ministry , ( N ) for the [ e ] edifying of ( O ) the body of Christ ,
NKJV	Ephesians	4	13	till we all come to the unity of the faith ( P ) and of the knowledge of the Son of God , to ( Q ) a perfect man , to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ ;
NKJV	Ephesians	4	14	that we should no longer be ( R ) children , tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine , by the trickery of men , in the cunning craftiness of ( S ) deceitful plotting ,
NKJV	Ephesians	4	15	but , speaking the truth in love , may grow up in all things into Him who is the ( T ) head—Christ—
NKJV	Ephesians	4	16	( U ) from whom the whole body , joined and knit together by what every joint supplies , according to the effective working by which every part does its share , causes growth of the body for the edifying of itself in love . The New Man
NKJV	Ephesians	4	17	This I say , therefore , and testify in the Lord , that you should ( V ) no longer walk as [ f ] the rest of the Gentiles walk , in the futility of their mind ,
NKJV	Ephesians	4	18	having their understanding darkened , being alienated from the life of God , because of the ignorance that is in them , because of the ( W ) blindness of their heart ;
NKJV	Ephesians	4	19	( X ) who , being past feeling , ( Y ) have given themselves over to lewdness , to work all uncleanness with greediness .
NKJV	Ephesians	4	20	But you have not so learned Christ ,
NKJV	Ephesians	4	21	if indeed you have heard Him and have been taught by Him , as the truth is in Jesus :
NKJV	Ephesians	4	22	that you ( Z ) put off , concerning your former conduct , the old man which grows corrupt according to the deceitful lusts ,
NKJV	Ephesians	4	23	and ( AA ) be renewed in the spirit of your mind ,
NKJV	Ephesians	4	24	and that you ( AB ) put on the new man which was created according to God , in true righteousness and holiness . Do Not Grieve the Spirit
NKJV	Ephesians	4	25	Therefore , putting away lying , ( AC ) “ Let each one of you speak truth with his neighbor , ” for ( AD ) we are members of one another .
NKJV	Ephesians	4	26	( AE ) “ Be angry , and do not sin ” : do not let the sun go down on your wrath ,
NKJV	Ephesians	4	27	( AF ) nor give [ g ] place to the devil .
NKJV	Ephesians	4	28	Let him who stole steal no longer , but rather ( AG ) let him labor , working with his hands what is good , that he may have something ( AH ) to give him who has need .
NKJV	Ephesians	4	29	( AI ) Let no corrupt word proceed out of your mouth , but ( AJ ) what is good for necessary [ h ] edification , ( AK ) that it may impart grace to the hearers .
NKJV	Ephesians	4	30	And ( AL ) do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God , by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption .
NKJV	Ephesians	4	31	( AM ) Let all bitterness , wrath , anger , [ i ] clamor , and ( AN ) evil speaking be put away from you , ( AO ) with all malice .

NKJV	Ephesians	5	5	For [ a ] this you know , that no fornicator , unclean person , nor covetous man , who is an idolater , has any ( L ) inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God .
NKJV	Ephesians	5	2	And ( C ) walk in love , ( D ) as Christ also has loved us and given Himself for us , an offering and a sacrifice to God ( E ) for a sweet-smelling aroma .
NKJV	Ephesians	5	3	But fornication and all ( F ) uncleanness or ( G ) covetousness , let it not even be named among you , as is fitting for saints ;
NKJV	Ephesians	5	4	( H ) neither filthiness , nor ( I ) foolish talking , nor coarse jesting , ( J ) which are not fitting , but rather ( K ) giving of thanks .
NKJV	Ephesians	5	6	Let no one deceive you with empty words , for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience .
NKJV	Ephesians	5	7	Therefore do not be ( M ) partakers with them . Walk in Light
NKJV	Ephesians	5	8	For you were once darkness , but now you are ( N ) light in the Lord . Walk as children of light
NKJV	Ephesians	5	9	( for ( O ) the fruit of the [ b ] Spirit is in all goodness , righteousness , and truth ) ,
NKJV	Ephesians	5	10	( P ) finding out what is acceptable to the Lord .
NKJV	Ephesians	5	11	And have ( Q ) no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness , but rather [ c ] expose them .
NKJV	Ephesians	5	12	( R ) For it is shameful even to speak of those things which are done by them in secret .
NKJV	Ephesians	5	13	But ( S ) all things that are [ d ] exposed are made manifest by the light , for whatever makes manifest is light .
NKJV	Ephesians	5	14	Therefore He says : ( T ) “ Awake , you who sleep , Arise from the dead , And Christ will give you light. ” Walk in Wisdom
NKJV	Ephesians	5	15	( U ) See then that you walk [ e ] circumspectly , not as fools but as wise ,
NKJV	Ephesians	5	16	( V ) redeeming the time , ( W ) because the days are evil .
NKJV	Ephesians	5	17	( X ) Therefore do not be unwise , but ( Y ) understand ( Z ) what the will of the Lord is .
NKJV	Ephesians	5	18	And ( AA ) do not be drunk with wine , in which is dissipation ; but be filled with the Spirit ,
NKJV	Ephesians	5	19	speaking to one another ( AB ) in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs , singing and making ( AC ) melody in your heart to the Lord ,
NKJV	Ephesians	5	20	( AD ) giving thanks always for all things to God the Father ( AE ) in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
NKJV	Ephesians	5	21	( AF ) submitting to one another in the fear of [ f ] God . Marriage—Christ and the Church ( AG )
NKJV	Ephesians	5	22	Wives , ( AH ) submit to your own husbands , as to the Lord .
NKJV	Ephesians	5	23	For ( AI ) the husband is head of the wife , as also ( AJ ) Christ is head of the church ; and He is the Savior of the body .
NKJV	Ephesians	5	24	Therefore , just as the church is subject to Christ , so let the wives be to their own husbands ( AK ) in everything .
NKJV	Ephesians	5	25	( AL ) Husbands , love your wives , just as Christ also loved the church and ( AM ) gave Himself for her ,
NKJV	Ephesians	5	26	that He might [ g ] sanctify and cleanse her ( AN ) with the washing of water ( AO ) by the word ,
NKJV	Ephesians	5	27	( AP ) that He might present her to Himself a glorious church , ( AQ ) not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing , but that she should be holy and without blemish .
NKJV	Ephesians	5	28	So husbands ought to love their own wives as their own bodies ; he who loves his wife loves himself .
NKJV	Ephesians	5	29	For no one ever hated his own flesh , but nourishes and cherishes it , just as the Lord does the church .

NKJV	Ephesians	6	11	( M ) Put on the whole armor of God , that you may be able to stand against the [ b ] wiles of the devil .

NKJV	Philippians	1	1	Paul and Timothy , bondservants of Jesus Christ , To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi , with the [ a ] bishops and ( A ) deacons :
NKJV	Philippians	1	2	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ . Thankfulness and Prayer
NKJV	Philippians	1	3	( B ) I thank my God upon every remembrance of you ,
NKJV	Philippians	1	4	always in ( C ) every prayer of mine making request for you all with joy ,
NKJV	Philippians	1	5	( D ) for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now ,
NKJV	Philippians	1	6	being confident of this very thing , that He who has begun ( E ) a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ ;
NKJV	Philippians	1	7	just as it is right for me to think this of you all , because I have you in my heart , inasmuch as both in my chains and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel , you all are partakers with me of grace .
NKJV	Philippians	1	8	For God is my witness , how greatly I long for you all with the affection of Jesus Christ .
NKJV	Philippians	1	9	And this I pray , that your love may abound still more and more in knowledge and all discernment ,
NKJV	Philippians	1	10	that you may approve the things that are excellent , that you may be sincere and without offense till the day of Christ ,
NKJV	Philippians	1	11	being filled with the fruits of righteousness ( F ) which are by Jesus Christ , ( G ) to the glory and praise of God . Christ Is Preached
NKJV	Philippians	1	12	But I want you to know , brethren , that the things which happened to me have actually turned out for the furtherance of the gospel ,
NKJV	Philippians	1	13	so that it has become evident ( H ) to the whole [ b ] palace guard , and to all the rest , that my chains are in Christ ;
NKJV	Philippians	1	14	and most of the brethren in the Lord , having become confident by my chains , are much more bold to speak the word without fear .
NKJV	Philippians	1	15	Some indeed preach Christ even from envy and strife , and some also from goodwill :

NKJV	Philippians	1	18	What then ? Only that in every way , whether in pretense or in truth , Christ is preached ; and in this I rejoice , yes , and will rejoice . To Live Is Christ
NKJV	Philippians	1	19	For I know that ( I ) this will turn out for my deliverance through your prayer and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ ,
NKJV	Philippians	1	20	according to my earnest expectation and hope that in nothing I shall be ashamed , but ( J ) with all boldness , as always , so now also Christ will be magnified in my body , whether by life ( K ) or by death .
NKJV	Philippians	1	21	For to me , to live is Christ , and to die is gain .
NKJV	Philippians	1	22	But if I live on in the flesh , this will mean fruit from my labor ; yet what I shall choose I [ d ] can not tell .
NKJV	Philippians	1	23	[ e ] For I am hard-pressed between the two , having a ( L ) desire to depart and be with Christ , which is ( M ) far better .
NKJV	Philippians	1	24	Nevertheless to remain in the flesh is more needful for you .
NKJV	Philippians	1	25	And being confident of this , I know that I shall remain and continue with you all for your progress and joy of faith ,
NKJV	Philippians	1	26	that ( N ) your rejoicing for me may be more abundant in Jesus Christ by my coming to you again . Striving and Suffering for Christ
NKJV	Philippians	1	27	Only ( O ) let your conduct be worthy of the gospel of Christ , so that whether I come and see you or am absent , I may hear of your affairs , that you stand fast in one spirit , ( P ) with one mind ( Q ) striving together for the faith of the gospel ,
NKJV	Philippians	1	28	and not in any way terrified by your adversaries , which is to them a proof of perdition , but [ f ] to you of salvation , and that from God .
NKJV	Philippians	1	29	For to you ( R ) it has been granted on behalf of Christ , ( S ) not only to believe in Him , but also to ( T ) suffer for His sake ,

NKJV	Philippians	2	3	( E ) Let nothing be done through selfish ambition or conceit , but ( F ) in lowliness of mind let each esteem others better than himself .
NKJV	Philippians	2	4	( G ) Let each of you look out not only for his own interests , but also for the interests of ( H ) others . The Humbled and Exalted Christ
NKJV	Philippians	2	5	( I ) Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus ,
NKJV	Philippians	2	6	who , ( J ) being in the form of God , did not consider it [ b ] robbery to be equal with God ,
NKJV	Philippians	2	7	( K ) but [ c ] made Himself of no reputation , taking the form ( L ) of a bondservant , and ( M ) coming in the likeness of men .
NKJV	Philippians	2	8	And being found in appearance as a man , He humbled Himself and ( N ) became ( O ) obedient to the point of death , even the death of the cross .
NKJV	Philippians	2	9	( P ) Therefore God also ( Q ) has highly exalted Him and ( R ) given Him the name which is above every name ,
NKJV	Philippians	2	10	( S ) that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow , of those in heaven , and of those on earth , and of those under the earth ,
NKJV	Philippians	2	11	and ( T ) that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord , to the glory of God the Father . Light Bearers
NKJV	Philippians	2	12	Therefore , my beloved , ( U ) as you have always obeyed , not as in my presence only , but now much more in my absence , ( V ) work out your own salvation with ( W ) fear and trembling ;
NKJV	Philippians	2	13	for ( X ) it is God who works in you both to will and to do ( Y ) for His good pleasure .
NKJV	Philippians	2	14	Do all things ( Z ) without [ d ] complaining and ( AA ) disputing , [ e ]
NKJV	Philippians	2	15	that you may become blameless and [ f ] harmless , children of God without fault in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation , among whom you shine as ( AB ) lights in the world ,
NKJV	Philippians	2	16	holding fast the word of life , so that ( AC ) I may rejoice in the day of Christ that ( AD ) I have not run in vain or labored in ( AE ) vain .
NKJV	Philippians	2	17	Yes , and if ( AF ) I am being poured out as a drink offering on the sacrifice ( AG ) and service of your faith , ( AH ) I am glad and rejoice with you all .
NKJV	Philippians	2	18	For the same reason you also be glad and rejoice with me . Timothy Commended
NKJV	Philippians	2	19	But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send ( AI ) Timothy to you shortly , that I also may be encouraged when I know your [ g ] state .
NKJV	Philippians	2	20	For I have no one ( AJ ) like-minded , who will sincerely care for your state .
NKJV	Philippians	2	21	For all seek their own , not the things which are of Christ Jesus .
NKJV	Philippians	2	22	But you know his proven character , ( AK ) that as a son with his father he served with me in the gospel .
NKJV	Philippians	2	23	Therefore I hope to send him at once , as soon as I see how it goes with me .
NKJV	Philippians	2	24	But I trust in the Lord that I myself shall also come shortly . Epaphroditus Praised
NKJV	Philippians	2	25	Yet I considered it necessary to send to you ( AL ) Epaphroditus , my brother , fellow worker , and ( AM ) fellow soldier , ( AN ) but your messenger and ( AO ) the one who ministered to my need ;
NKJV	Philippians	2	26	( AP ) since he was longing for you all , and was distressed because you had heard that he was sick .
NKJV	Philippians	2	27	For indeed he was sick almost unto death ; but God had mercy on him , and not only on him but on me also , lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow .
NKJV	Philippians	2	28	Therefore I sent him the more eagerly , that when you see him again you may rejoice , and I may be less sorrowful .
NKJV	Philippians	2	29	Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness , and hold such men in esteem ;
NKJV	Philippians	2	30	because for the work of Christ he came close to death , [ h ] not regarding his life , ( AQ ) to supply what was lacking in your service toward me .

NKJV	Philippians	3	9	and be found in Him , not having ( O ) my own righteousness , which is from the law , but ( P ) that which is through faith in Christ , the righteousness which is from God by faith ;

NKJV	Philippians	4	3	[ a ] And I urge you also , true companion , help these women who ( E ) labored with me in the gospel , with Clement also , and the rest of my fellow workers , whose names are in ( F ) the Book of Life .
NKJV	Philippians	4	5	Let your [ b ] gentleness be known to all men . ( H ) The Lord is at hand .
NKJV	Philippians	4	6	( I ) Be anxious for nothing , but in everything by prayer and supplication , with ( J ) thanksgiving , let your requests be made known to God ;
NKJV	Philippians	4	7	and ( K ) the peace of God , which surpasses all understanding , will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus . Meditate on These Things
NKJV	Philippians	4	8	Finally , brethren , whatever things are ( L ) true , whatever things are ( M ) noble , whatever things are ( N ) just , ( O ) whatever things are pure , whatever things are ( P ) lovely , whatever things are of good report , if there is any virtue and if there is anything praiseworthy—meditate on these things .
NKJV	Philippians	4	9	The things which you learned and received and heard and saw in me , these do , and ( Q ) the God of peace will be with you . Philippian Generosity
NKJV	Philippians	4	10	But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at last ( R ) your [ c ] care for me has flourished again ; though you surely did care , but you lacked opportunity .
NKJV	Philippians	4	11	Not that I speak in regard to need , for I have learned in whatever state I am , ( S ) to be content :
NKJV	Philippians	4	12	( T ) I know how to [ d ] be abased , and I know how to [ e ] abound . Everywhere and in all things I have learned both to be full and to be hungry , both to abound and to suffer need .
NKJV	Philippians	4	13	I can do all things ( U ) through [ f ] Christ who strengthens me .
NKJV	Philippians	4	14	Nevertheless you have done well that ( V ) you shared in my distress .
NKJV	Philippians	4	15	Now you Philippians know also that in the beginning of the gospel , when I departed from Macedonia , ( W ) no church shared with me concerning giving and receiving but you only .
NKJV	Philippians	4	16	For even in Thessalonica you sent aid once and again for my necessities .
NKJV	Philippians	4	17	Not that I seek the gift , but I seek ( X ) the fruit that abounds to your account .
NKJV	Philippians	4	18	Indeed I [ g ] have all and abound . I am full , having received from ( Y ) Epaphroditus the things sent from you , ( Z ) a sweet-smelling aroma , ( AA ) an acceptable sacrifice , well pleasing to God .
NKJV	Philippians	4	19	And my God ( AB ) shall supply all your need according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus .
NKJV	Philippians	4	20	( AC ) Now to our God and Father be glory forever and ever . Amen . Greeting and Blessing
NKJV	Philippians	4	21	Greet every saint in Christ Jesus . The brethren ( AD ) who are with me greet you .

NKJV	Colossians	1	1	Paul , ( A ) an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God , and Timothy our brother ,
NKJV	Colossians	1	2	To the saints ( B ) and faithful brethren in Christ who are in Colosse : ( C ) Grace to you and peace from God our Father [ a ] and the Lord Jesus Christ . Their Faith in Christ
NKJV	Colossians	1	3	( D ) We give thanks to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , praying always for you ,
NKJV	Colossians	1	4	( E ) since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of ( F ) your love for all the saints ;
NKJV	Colossians	1	5	because of the hope ( G ) which is laid up for you in heaven , of which you heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel ,
NKJV	Colossians	1	6	which has come to you , ( H ) as it has also in all the world , and ( I ) is bringing forth [ b ] fruit , as it is also among you since the day you heard and knew ( J ) the grace of God in truth ;
NKJV	Colossians	1	7	as you also learned from ( K ) Epaphras , our dear fellow servant , who is ( L ) a faithful minister of Christ on your behalf ,
NKJV	Colossians	1	8	who also declared to us your ( M ) love in the Spirit . Preeminence of Christ
NKJV	Colossians	1	9	( N ) For this reason we also , since the day we heard it , do not cease to pray for you , and to ask ( O ) that you may be filled with ( P ) the knowledge of His will ( Q ) in all wisdom and spiritual understanding ;
NKJV	Colossians	1	10	( R ) that you may walk worthy of the Lord , ( S ) fully pleasing Him , ( T ) being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the ( U ) knowledge of God ;
NKJV	Colossians	1	11	( V ) strengthened with all might , according to His glorious power , ( W ) for all patience and longsuffering ( X ) with joy ;
NKJV	Colossians	1	12	( Y ) giving thanks to the Father who has qualified us to be partakers of ( Z ) the inheritance of the saints in the light .
NKJV	Colossians	1	13	He has delivered us from ( AA ) the power of darkness ( AB ) and [ c ] conveyed us into the kingdom of the Son of His love ,
NKJV	Colossians	1	14	( AC ) in whom we have redemption [ d ] through His blood , the forgiveness of sins .
NKJV	Colossians	1	15	He is ( AD ) the image of the invisible God , ( AE ) the firstborn over all creation .
NKJV	Colossians	1	16	For ( AF ) by Him all things were created that are in heaven and that are on earth , visible and invisible , whether thrones or ( AG ) dominions or [ e ] principalities or [ f ] powers . All things were created ( AH ) through Him and for Him .
NKJV	Colossians	1	17	( AI ) And He is before all things , and in Him ( AJ ) all things consist .
NKJV	Colossians	1	18	And ( AK ) He is the head of the body , the church , who is the beginning , ( AL ) the firstborn from the dead , that in all things He may have the preeminence . Reconciled in Christ
NKJV	Colossians	1	19	For it pleased the Father that ( AM ) in Him all the fullness should dwell ,
NKJV	Colossians	1	20	and ( AN ) by Him to reconcile ( AO ) all things to Himself , by Him , whether things on earth or things in heaven , ( AP ) having made peace through the blood of His cross .
NKJV	Colossians	1	21	And you , ( AQ ) who once were alienated and enemies in your mind ( AR ) by wicked works , yet now He has ( AS ) reconciled
NKJV	Colossians	1	22	( AT ) in the body of His flesh through death , ( AU ) to present you holy , and blameless , and above reproach in His sight—
NKJV	Colossians	1	23	if indeed you continue ( AV ) in the faith , grounded and steadfast , and are ( AW ) not moved away from the hope of the gospel which you heard , ( AX ) which was preached to every creature under heaven , ( AY ) of which I , Paul , became a minister . Sacrificial Service for Christ
NKJV	Colossians	1	24	( AZ ) I now rejoice in my sufferings ( BA ) for you , and fill up in my flesh ( BB ) what is lacking in the afflictions of Christ , for ( BC ) the sake of His body , which is the church ,
NKJV	Colossians	1	25	of which I became a minister according to ( BD ) the [ g ] stewardship from God which was given to me for you , to fulfill the word of God ,
NKJV	Colossians	1	26	( BE ) the [ h ] mystery which has been hidden from ages and from generations , ( BF ) but now has been revealed to His saints .
NKJV	Colossians	1	27	( BG ) To them God willed to make known what are ( BH ) the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles : [ i ] which is ( BI ) Christ in you , ( BJ ) the hope of glory .
NKJV	Colossians	1	28	Him we preach , ( BK ) warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom , ( BL ) that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus .
NKJV	Colossians	1	29	To this end I also labor , striving according to His working which works in me ( BM ) mightily .

NKJV	Colossians	2	2	that their hearts may be encouraged , being knit together in love , and attaining to all riches of the full assurance of understanding , to the knowledge of the mystery of God , [ b ] both of the Father and of Christ ,
NKJV	Colossians	2	3	( B ) in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge .
NKJV	Colossians	2	4	Now this I say ( C ) lest anyone should deceive you with persuasive words .
NKJV	Colossians	2	5	For ( D ) though I am absent in the flesh , yet I am with you in spirit , rejoicing [ c ] to see ( E ) your good order and the ( F ) steadfastness of your faith in Christ .
NKJV	Colossians	2	6	( G ) As you therefore have received Christ Jesus the Lord , so walk in Him ,
NKJV	Colossians	2	7	( H ) rooted and built up in Him and established in the faith , as you have been taught , abounding [ d ] in it with thanksgiving .
NKJV	Colossians	2	8	Beware lest anyone [ e ] cheat you through philosophy and empty deceit , according to ( I ) the tradition of men , according to the ( J ) basic principles of the world , and not according to Christ .
NKJV	Colossians	2	9	For ( K ) in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead [ f ] bodily ;
NKJV	Colossians	2	10	and you are complete in Him , who is the ( L ) head of all [ g ] principality and power . Not Legalism but Christ
NKJV	Colossians	2	11	In Him you were also ( M ) circumcised with the circumcision made without hands , by ( N ) putting off the body [ h ] of the sins of the flesh , by the circumcision of Christ ,
NKJV	Colossians	2	12	( O ) buried with Him in baptism , in which you also were raised with Him through ( P ) faith in the working of God , ( Q ) who raised Him from the dead .
NKJV	Colossians	2	13	And you , being dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh , He has made alive together with Him , having forgiven you all trespasses ,
NKJV	Colossians	2	14	( R ) having wiped out the [ i ] handwriting of requirements that was against us , which was contrary to us . And He has taken it out of the way , having nailed it to the cross .
NKJV	Colossians	2	15	( S ) Having disarmed ( T ) principalities and powers , He made a public spectacle of them , triumphing over them in it .
NKJV	Colossians	2	16	So let no one ( U ) judge you in food or in drink , or regarding a [ j ] festival or a new moon or sabbaths ,
NKJV	Colossians	2	17	( V ) which are a shadow of things to come , but the [ k ] substance is of Christ .
NKJV	Colossians	2	18	Let no one cheat you of your reward , taking delight in false humility and worship of angels , intruding into those things which he has [ l ] not seen , vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind ,
NKJV	Colossians	2	19	and not holding fast to ( W ) the Head , from whom all the body , nourished and knit together by joints and ligaments , ( X ) grows with the increase that is from God .
NKJV	Colossians	2	20	[ m ] Therefore , if you ( Y ) died with Christ from the basic principles of the world , ( Z ) why , as though living in the world , do you subject yourselves to regulations—
NKJV	Colossians	2	21	( AA ) “ Do not touch , do not taste , do not handle , ”
NKJV	Colossians	2	22	which all concern things which perish with the using— ( AB ) according to the commandments and doctrines of men ?

NKJV	Colossians	3	3	( D ) For you died , ( E ) and your life is hidden with Christ in God .
NKJV	Colossians	3	2	Set your mind on things above , not on things on the ( C ) earth .
NKJV	Colossians	3	4	( F ) When Christ who is ( G ) our life appears , then you also will appear with Him in ( H ) glory .
NKJV	Colossians	3	5	( I ) Therefore put to death ( J ) your members which are on the earth : ( K ) fornication , uncleanness , passion , evil desire , and covetousness , ( L ) which is idolatry .
NKJV	Colossians	3	6	( M ) Because of these things the wrath of God is coming upon ( N ) the sons of disobedience ,
NKJV	Colossians	3	7	( O ) in which you yourselves once walked when you lived in them .
NKJV	Colossians	3	8	( P ) But now you yourselves are to put off all these : anger , wrath , malice , blasphemy , filthy language out of your mouth .
NKJV	Colossians	3	9	Do not lie to one another , since you have put off the old man with his deeds ,
NKJV	Colossians	3	10	and have put on the new man who ( Q ) is renewed in knowledge ( R ) according to the image of Him who ( S ) created him ,
NKJV	Colossians	3	11	where there is neither ( T ) Greek nor Jew , circumcised nor uncircumcised , barbarian , Scythian , slave nor free , ( U ) but Christ is all and in all . Character of the New Man
NKJV	Colossians	3	12	Therefore , ( V ) as the elect of God , holy and beloved , ( W ) put on tender mercies , kindness , humility , meekness , longsuffering ;
NKJV	Colossians	3	13	( X ) bearing with one another , and forgiving one another , if anyone has a complaint against another ; even as Christ forgave you , so you also must do .
NKJV	Colossians	3	14	( Y ) But above all these things ( Z ) put on love , which is the ( AA ) bond of perfection .
NKJV	Colossians	3	15	And let ( AB ) the peace of God rule in your hearts , ( AC ) to which also you were called ( AD ) in one body ; and ( AE ) be thankful .
NKJV	Colossians	3	16	Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom , teaching and admonishing one another ( AF ) in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs , singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord .
NKJV	Colossians	3	17	And ( AG ) whatever you do in word or deed , do all in the name of the Lord Jesus , giving thanks to God the Father through Him . The Christian Home ( AH )
NKJV	Colossians	3	18	( AI ) Wives , submit to your own husbands , ( AJ ) as is fitting in the Lord .
NKJV	Colossians	3	19	( AK ) Husbands , love your wives and do not be ( AL ) bitter toward them .
NKJV	Colossians	3	20	( AM ) Children , obey your parents ( AN ) in all things , for this is well pleasing to the Lord .
NKJV	Colossians	3	21	( AO ) Fathers , do not provoke your children , lest they become discouraged .
NKJV	Colossians	3	22	( AP ) Bondservants , obey in all things your masters according to the flesh , not with eyeservice , as men-pleasers , but in sincerity of heart , fearing God .
NKJV	Colossians	3	23	( AQ ) And whatever you do , do it heartily , as to the Lord and not to men ,
NKJV	Colossians	3	24	( AR ) knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance ; ( AS ) for [ a ] you serve the Lord Christ .

NKJV	Colossians	4	4	that I may make it manifest , as I ought to speak .
NKJV	Colossians	4	2	( B ) Continue earnestly in prayer , being vigilant in it ( C ) with thanksgiving ;
NKJV	Colossians	4	3	( D ) meanwhile praying also for us , that God would ( E ) open to us a door for the word , to speak ( F ) the [ a ] mystery of Christ , ( G ) for which I am also in chains ,
NKJV	Colossians	4	5	( H ) Walk in ( I ) wisdom toward those who are outside , ( J ) redeeming the time .
NKJV	Colossians	4	6	Let your speech always be ( K ) with grace , ( L ) seasoned with salt , ( M ) that you may know how you ought to answer each one . Final Greetings ( N )
NKJV	Colossians	4	7	( O ) Tychicus , a beloved brother , faithful minister , and fellow servant in the Lord , will tell you all the news about me .
NKJV	Colossians	4	8	( P ) I am sending him to you for this very purpose , that [ b ] he may know your circumstances and comfort your hearts ,
NKJV	Colossians	4	9	with ( Q ) Onesimus , a faithful and beloved brother , who is one of you . They will make known to you all things which are happening here .
NKJV	Colossians	4	10	( R ) Aristarchus my fellow prisoner greets you , with ( S ) Mark the cousin of Barnabas ( about whom you received instructions : if he comes to you , welcome him ) ,
NKJV	Colossians	4	11	and Jesus who is called Justus . These are my only fellow workers for the kingdom of God who are of the circumcision ; they have proved to be a comfort to me .
NKJV	Colossians	4	12	( T ) Epaphras , who is one of you , a bondservant of Christ , greets you , always ( U ) laboring fervently for you in prayers , that you may stand ( V ) perfect and [ c ] complete in all the will of God .
NKJV	Colossians	4	13	For I bear him witness that he has a great [ d ] zeal for you , and those who are in Laodicea , and those in Hierapolis .
NKJV	Colossians	4	14	( W ) Luke the beloved physician and ( X ) Demas greet you .
NKJV	Colossians	4	15	Greet the brethren who are in Laodicea , and [ e ] Nymphas and ( Y ) the church that is in [ f ] his house . Closing Exhortations and Blessing
NKJV	Colossians	4	16	Now when ( Z ) this epistle is read among you , see that it is read also in the church of the Laodiceans , and that you likewise read the epistle from Laodicea .
NKJV	Colossians	4	17	And say to ( AA ) Archippus , “ Take heed to ( AB ) the ministry which you have received in the Lord , that you may fulfill it. ”

NKJV	1%20Thessalonians	1	3	remembering without ceasing ( D ) your work of faith , ( E ) labor of love , and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ in the sight of our God and Father ,
NKJV	1%20Thessalonians	1	4	knowing , beloved brethren , ( F ) your election by God .
NKJV	1%20Thessalonians	1	5	For ( G ) our gospel did not come to you in word only , but also in power , ( H ) and in the Holy Spirit ( I ) and in much assurance , as you know what kind of men we were among you for your sake .
NKJV	1%20Thessalonians	1	6	And ( J ) you became followers of us and of the Lord , having received the word in much affliction , ( K ) with joy of the Holy Spirit ,
NKJV	1%20Thessalonians	1	7	so that you became examples to all in Macedonia and Achaia who believe .
NKJV	1%20Thessalonians	1	8	For from you the word of the Lord ( L ) has sounded forth , not only in Macedonia and Achaia , but also ( M ) in every place . Your faith toward God has gone out , so that we do not need to say anything .
NKJV	1%20Thessalonians	1	9	For they themselves declare concerning us ( N ) what manner of entry we had to you , ( O ) and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God ,

NKJV	1%20Thessalonians	2	2	But [ a ] even after we had suffered before and were spitefully treated at ( B ) Philippi , as you know , we were ( C ) bold in our God to speak to you the gospel of God in much conflict .
NKJV	1%20Thessalonians	2	3	( D ) For our exhortation did not come from error or uncleanness , nor was it in deceit .
NKJV	1%20Thessalonians	2	4	But as ( E ) we have been approved by God ( F ) to be entrusted with the gospel , even so we speak , ( G ) not as pleasing men , but God ( H ) who tests our hearts .
NKJV	1%20Thessalonians	2	5	For ( I ) neither at any time did we use flattering words , as you know , nor a [ b ] cloak for covetousness— ( J ) God is witness .
NKJV	1%20Thessalonians	2	6	( K ) Nor did we seek glory from men , either from you or from others , when ( L ) we might have ( M ) made demands ( N ) as apostles of Christ .
NKJV	1%20Thessalonians	2	7	But ( O ) we were gentle among you , just as a nursing mother cherishes her own children .
NKJV	1%20Thessalonians	2	8	So , affectionately longing for you , we were well pleased ( P ) to impart to you not only the gospel of God , but also ( Q ) our own lives , because you had become dear to us .
NKJV	1%20Thessalonians	2	9	For you remember , brethren , our ( R ) labor and toil ; for laboring night and day , ( S ) that we might not be a burden to any of you , we preached to you the gospel of God .
NKJV	1%20Thessalonians	2	10	( T ) You are witnesses , and God also , ( U ) how devoutly and justly and blamelessly we behaved ourselves among you who believe ;
NKJV	1%20Thessalonians	2	11	as you know how we exhorted , and comforted , and [ c ] charged every one of you , as a father does his own children ,
NKJV	1%20Thessalonians	2	12	( V ) that you would walk worthy of God ( W ) who calls you into His own kingdom and glory . Their Conversion
NKJV	1%20Thessalonians	2	13	For this reason we also thank God ( X ) without ceasing , because when you ( Y ) received the word of God which you heard from us , you welcomed it ( Z ) not as the word of men , but as it is in truth , the word of God , which also effectively ( AA ) works in you who believe .
NKJV	1%20Thessalonians	2	14	For you , brethren , became imitators ( AB ) of the churches of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus . For ( AC ) you also suffered the same things from your own countrymen , just as they did from the Judeans ,
NKJV	1%20Thessalonians	2	15	( AD ) who killed both the Lord Jesus and ( AE ) their own prophets , and have persecuted us ; and they do not please God ( AF ) and are [ d ] contrary to all men ,
NKJV	1%20Thessalonians	2	16	( AG ) forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they may be saved , so as always ( AH ) to fill up the measure of their sins ; ( AI ) but wrath has come upon them to the uttermost . Longing to See Them
NKJV	1%20Thessalonians	2	17	But we , brethren , having been taken away from you for a short time ( AJ ) in presence , not in heart , endeavored more eagerly to see your face with great desire .
NKJV	1%20Thessalonians	2	18	Therefore we wanted to come to you—even I , Paul , time and again—but ( AK ) Satan hindered us .
NKJV	1%20Thessalonians	2	19	For ( AL ) what is our hope , or joy , or ( AM ) crown of rejoicing ? Is it not even you in the ( AN ) presence of our Lord Jesus Christ ( AO ) at His coming ?

NKJV	1%20Thessalonians	3	2	and sent ( A ) Timothy , our brother and minister of God , and our fellow laborer in the gospel of Christ , to establish you and encourage you concerning your faith ,
NKJV	1%20Thessalonians	3	4	( D ) For , in fact , we told you before when we were with you that we would suffer tribulation , just as it happened , and you know .
NKJV	1%20Thessalonians	3	5	For this reason , when I could no longer endure it , I sent to know your faith , ( E ) lest by some means the tempter had tempted you , and ( F ) our labor might be in vain . Encouraged by Timothy
NKJV	1%20Thessalonians	3	6	( G ) But now that Timothy has come to us from you , and brought us good news of your faith and love , and that you always have good remembrance of us , greatly desiring to see us , ( H ) as we also to see you—

NKJV	1%20Thessalonians	4	8	( L ) Therefore he who rejects this does not reject man , but God , ( M ) who [ a ] has also given us His Holy Spirit . A Brotherly and Orderly Life
NKJV	1%20Thessalonians	4	9	But concerning brotherly love you have no need that I should write to you , for ( N ) you yourselves are taught by God ( O ) to love one another ;
NKJV	1%20Thessalonians	4	10	and indeed you do so toward all the brethren who are in all Macedonia . But we urge you , brethren , ( P ) that you increase more and more ;
NKJV	1%20Thessalonians	4	11	that you also aspire to lead a quiet life , ( Q ) to mind your own business , and ( R ) to work with your own hands , as we commanded you ,
NKJV	1%20Thessalonians	4	12	( S ) that you may walk properly toward those who are outside , and that you may lack nothing . The Comfort of Christ ’ s Coming
NKJV	1%20Thessalonians	4	13	But I do not want you to be ignorant , brethren , concerning those who have fallen [ b ] asleep , lest you sorrow ( T ) as others ( U ) who have no hope .
NKJV	1%20Thessalonians	4	14	For ( V ) if we believe that Jesus died and rose again , even so God will bring with Him ( W ) those who [ c ] sleep in Jesus .
NKJV	1%20Thessalonians	4	15	For this we say to you ( X ) by the word of the Lord , that ( Y ) we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord will by no means precede those who are [ d ] asleep .
NKJV	1%20Thessalonians	4	16	For ( Z ) the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout , with the voice of an archangel , and with ( AA ) the trumpet of God . ( AB ) And the dead in Christ will rise first .
NKJV	1%20Thessalonians	4	17	( AC ) Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them ( AD ) in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air . And thus ( AE ) we shall always be with the Lord .
NKJV	1%20Thessalonians	4	18	( AF ) Therefore comfort one another with these words . Footnotes -

NKJV	1%20Thessalonians	5	2	For you yourselves know perfectly that ( B ) the day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night .
NKJV	1%20Thessalonians	5	3	For when they say , “ Peace and safety ! ” then ( C ) sudden destruction comes upon them , ( D ) as labor pains upon a pregnant woman . And they shall not escape .

NKJV	1%20Thessalonians	5	6	( G ) Therefore let us not sleep , as others do , but ( H ) let us watch and be [ a ] sober .
NKJV	1%20Thessalonians	5	7	For ( I ) those who sleep , sleep at night , and those who get drunk ( J ) are drunk at night .

NKJV	2%20Thessalonians	1	3	We are bound to thank God always for you , brethren , as it is fitting , because your faith grows exceedingly , and the love of every one of you all abounds toward each other ,

NKJV	2%20Thessalonians	1	5	which is ( E ) manifest [ b ] evidence of the righteous judgment of God , that you may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God , ( F ) for which you also suffer ;
NKJV	2%20Thessalonians	1	6	( G ) since it is a righteous thing with God to repay with [ c ] tribulation those who trouble you ,
NKJV	2%20Thessalonians	1	7	and to give you who are troubled ( H ) rest with us when ( I ) the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with His mighty angels ,
NKJV	2%20Thessalonians	1	8	in flaming fire taking vengeance on those who do not know God , and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ .

NKJV	2%20Thessalonians	2	4	who opposes and ( G ) exalts himself ( H ) above all that is called God or that is worshiped , so that he sits [ c ] as God in the temple of God , showing himself that he is God .
NKJV	2%20Thessalonians	2	5	Do you not remember that when I was still with you I told you these things ?
NKJV	2%20Thessalonians	2	6	And now you know what is restraining , that he may be revealed in his own time .
NKJV	2%20Thessalonians	2	7	For ( I ) the [ d ] mystery of lawlessness is already at work ; only [ e ] He who now restrains will do so until He is taken out of the way .
NKJV	2%20Thessalonians	2	8	And then the lawless one will be revealed , ( J ) whom the Lord will consume ( K ) with the breath of His mouth and destroy ( L ) with the brightness of His coming .

NKJV	2%20Thessalonians	2	12	that they all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but ( S ) had pleasure in unrighteousness . Stand Fast

NKJV	2%20Thessalonians	3	7	For you yourselves know how you ought to follow us , for we were not disorderly among you ;
NKJV	2%20Thessalonians	3	8	nor did we eat anyone ’ s bread [ b ] free of charge , but worked with ( K ) labor and toil night and day , that we might not be a burden to any of you ,
NKJV	2%20Thessalonians	3	9	not because we do not have ( L ) authority , but to make ourselves an example of how you should follow us .
NKJV	2%20Thessalonians	3	10	For even when we were with you , we commanded you this : If anyone will not work , neither shall he eat .
NKJV	2%20Thessalonians	3	11	For we hear that there are some who walk among you in a disorderly manner , not working at all , but are ( M ) busybodies .
NKJV	2%20Thessalonians	3	12	Now those who are such we command and [ c ] exhort through our Lord Jesus Christ ( N ) that they work in quietness and eat their own bread .

NKJV	1%20Timothy	1	2	To Timothy , a ( A ) true son in the faith : ( B ) Grace , mercy , and peace from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord . No Other Doctrine
NKJV	1%20Timothy	1	3	As I urged you ( C ) when I went into Macedonia—remain in Ephesus that you may [ a ] charge some ( D ) that they teach no other doctrine ,
NKJV	1%20Timothy	1	4	( E ) nor give heed to fables and endless genealogies , which cause disputes rather than godly edification which is in faith .
NKJV	1%20Timothy	1	5	Now ( F ) the purpose of the commandment is love ( G ) from a pure heart , from a good conscience , and from [ b ] sincere faith ,
NKJV	1%20Timothy	1	6	from which some , having strayed , have turned aside to ( H ) idle talk ,
NKJV	1%20Timothy	1	7	desiring to be teachers of the law , understanding neither what they say nor the things which they affirm .
NKJV	1%20Timothy	1	8	But we know that the law is ( I ) good if one uses it lawfully ,
NKJV	1%20Timothy	1	9	knowing this : that the law is not made for a righteous person , but for the lawless and insubordinate , for the ungodly and for sinners , for the unholy and profane , for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers , for manslayers ,
NKJV	1%20Timothy	1	10	for fornicators , for sodomites , for kidnappers , for liars , for perjurers , and if there is any other thing that is [ c ] contrary to sound doctrine ,
NKJV	1%20Timothy	1	11	according to the glorious gospel of the ( J ) blessed God which was ( K ) committed to my trust . Glory to God for His Grace ( L )
NKJV	1%20Timothy	1	12	And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord who has ( M ) enabled me , ( N ) because He counted me faithful , ( O ) putting me into the ministry ,
NKJV	1%20Timothy	1	13	although ( P ) I was formerly a blasphemer , a persecutor , and an [ d ] insolent man ; but I obtained mercy because ( Q ) I did it ignorantly in unbelief .
NKJV	1%20Timothy	1	14	( R ) And the grace of our Lord was exceedingly abundant , ( S ) with faith and love which are in Christ Jesus .
NKJV	1%20Timothy	1	15	( T ) This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptance , that ( U ) Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners , of whom I am chief .
NKJV	1%20Timothy	1	16	However , for this reason I obtained mercy , that in me first Jesus Christ might show all longsuffering , as a pattern to those who are going to believe on Him for everlasting life .
NKJV	1%20Timothy	1	17	Now to ( V ) the King eternal , ( W ) immortal , ( X ) invisible , to [ e ] God ( Y ) who alone is wise , ( Z ) be honor and glory forever and ever . Amen . Fight the Good Fight
NKJV	1%20Timothy	1	18	This [ f ] charge I commit to you , son Timothy , according to the prophecies previously made concerning you , that by them you may wage the good warfare ,

NKJV	1%20Timothy	2	4	( E ) who desires all men to be saved ( F ) and to come to the knowledge of the truth .
NKJV	1%20Timothy	2	5	( G ) For there is one God and ( H ) one Mediator between God and men , the Man Christ Jesus ,

NKJV	1%20Timothy	2	7	( J ) for which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle—I am speaking the truth [ d ] in Christ and not lying— ( K ) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth . Men and Women in the Church
NKJV	1%20Timothy	2	8	I desire therefore that the men pray ( L ) everywhere , ( M ) lifting up holy hands , without wrath and doubting ;
NKJV	1%20Timothy	2	9	in like manner also , that the ( N ) women adorn themselves in modest apparel , with propriety and [ e ] moderation , not with braided hair or gold or pearls or costly clothing ,

NKJV	1%20Timothy	2	12	And ( P ) I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man , but to be in silence .
NKJV	1%20Timothy	2	13	For Adam was formed first , then Eve .
NKJV	1%20Timothy	2	14	And Adam was not deceived , but the woman being deceived , fell into transgression .

NKJV	1%20Timothy	4	5	for it is [ b ] sanctified by the word of God and prayer . A Good Servant of Jesus Christ
NKJV	1%20Timothy	4	6	If you instruct the brethren in these things , you will be a good minister of Jesus Christ , ( D ) nourished in the words of faith and of the good doctrine which you have carefully followed .
NKJV	1%20Timothy	4	7	But ( E ) reject profane and old wives ’ fables , and ( F ) exercise yourself toward godliness .
NKJV	1%20Timothy	4	8	For ( G ) bodily exercise profits a little , but godliness is profitable for all things , ( H ) having promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come .
NKJV	1%20Timothy	4	9	This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptance .

NKJV	1%20Timothy	5	3	Honor widows who are really widows .
NKJV	1%20Timothy	5	4	But if any widow has children or grandchildren , let them first learn to show piety at home and ( A ) to repay their parents ; for this is [ a ] good and acceptable before God .
NKJV	1%20Timothy	5	6	But she who lives in [ b ] pleasure is dead while she lives .
NKJV	1%20Timothy	5	7	And these things command , that they may be blameless .
NKJV	1%20Timothy	5	8	But if anyone does not provide for his own , ( C ) and especially for those of his household , ( D ) he has denied the faith ( E ) and is worse than an unbeliever .
NKJV	1%20Timothy	5	9	Do not let a widow under sixty years old be taken into the number , and not unless she has been the wife of one man ,
NKJV	1%20Timothy	5	10	well reported for good works : if she has brought up children , if she has lodged strangers , if she has washed the saints ’ feet , if she has relieved the afflicted , if she has diligently followed every good work .
NKJV	1%20Timothy	5	11	But [ c ] refuse the younger widows ; for when they have begun to grow wanton against Christ , they desire to marry ,
NKJV	1%20Timothy	5	12	having condemnation because they have cast off their first [ d ] faith .
NKJV	1%20Timothy	5	13	And besides they learn to be idle , wandering about from house to house , and not only idle but also gossips and busybodies , saying things which they ought not .
NKJV	1%20Timothy	5	14	Therefore I desire that the younger widows marry , bear children , manage the house , give no opportunity to the adversary to speak reproachfully .
NKJV	1%20Timothy	5	15	For some have already turned aside after Satan .

NKJV	1%20Timothy	5	19	Do not receive an accusation against an elder except ( H ) from two or three witnesses .
NKJV	1%20Timothy	5	20	Those who are sinning rebuke in the presence of all , that the rest also may fear .
NKJV	1%20Timothy	5	21	I charge you before God and the Lord Jesus Christ and the [ g ] elect angels that you observe these things without ( I ) prejudice , doing nothing with partiality .

NKJV	1%20Timothy	5	24	Some men ’ s sins are ( K ) clearly evident , preceding them to judgment , but those of some men follow later .

NKJV	1%20Timothy	6	8	And having food and clothing , with these we shall be ( G ) content .
NKJV	1%20Timothy	6	9	But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation and a snare , and into many foolish and harmful lusts which drown men in destruction and perdition .
NKJV	1%20Timothy	6	10	For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil , for which some have strayed from the faith in their greediness , and pierced themselves through with many sorrows . The Good Confession
NKJV	1%20Timothy	6	11	But you , O man of God , flee these things and pursue righteousness , godliness , faith , love , patience , gentleness .

NKJV	1%20Timothy	6	13	I urge you in the sight of God who gives life to all things , and before Christ Jesus ( H ) who witnessed the good confession before Pontius Pilate ,
NKJV	1%20Timothy	6	14	that you keep this commandment without spot , blameless until our Lord Jesus Christ ’ s appearing ,

NKJV	2%20Timothy	1	1	Paul , an apostle of [ a ] Jesus Christ by the will of God , according to the ( A ) promise of life which is in Christ Jesus ,
NKJV	2%20Timothy	1	3	I thank God , whom I serve with a pure conscience , as my ( C ) forefathers did , as without ceasing I remember you in my prayers night and day ,
NKJV	2%20Timothy	1	4	greatly desiring to see you , being mindful of your tears , that I may be filled with joy ,
NKJV	2%20Timothy	1	5	when I call to remembrance ( D ) the [ b ] genuine faith that is in you , which dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and ( E ) your mother Eunice , and I am persuaded is in you also .
NKJV	2%20Timothy	1	6	Therefore I remind you ( F ) to stir up the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands .
NKJV	2%20Timothy	1	7	For ( G ) God has not given us a spirit of fear , ( H ) but of power and of love and of a sound mind . Not Ashamed of the Gospel
NKJV	2%20Timothy	1	8	( I ) Therefore do not be ashamed of ( J ) the testimony of our Lord , nor of me ( K ) His prisoner , but share with me in the sufferings for the gospel according to the power of God ,
NKJV	2%20Timothy	1	9	who has saved us and called us with a holy calling , ( L ) not according to our works , but ( M ) according to His own purpose and grace which was given to us in Christ Jesus ( N ) before time began ,
NKJV	2%20Timothy	1	10	but ( O ) has now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ , who has abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel ,
NKJV	2%20Timothy	1	11	( P ) to which I was appointed a preacher , an apostle , and a teacher [ c ] of the Gentiles .
NKJV	2%20Timothy	1	12	For this reason I also suffer these things ; nevertheless I am not ashamed , ( Q ) for I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that He is able to keep what I have committed to Him until that Day . Be Loyal to the Faith
NKJV	2%20Timothy	1	13	( R ) Hold fast ( S ) the pattern of ( T ) sound words which you have heard from me , in faith and love which are in Christ Jesus .
NKJV	2%20Timothy	1	14	That good thing which was committed to you , keep by the Holy Spirit who dwells in us .
NKJV	2%20Timothy	1	15	This you know , that all those in Asia have turned away from me , among whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes .
NKJV	2%20Timothy	1	16	The Lord grant mercy to the ( U ) household of Onesiphorus , for he often refreshed me , and was not ashamed of my chain ;
NKJV	2%20Timothy	1	17	but when he arrived in Rome , he sought me out very zealously and found me .
NKJV	2%20Timothy	1	18	The Lord ( V ) grant to him that he may find mercy from the Lord ( W ) in that Day—and you know very well how many ways he ( X ) ministered [ d ] to me at Ephesus . Footnotes -

NKJV	2%20Timothy	2	3	You therefore must ( C ) endure [ a ] hardship ( D ) as a good soldier of Jesus Christ .
NKJV	2%20Timothy	2	4	( E ) No one engaged in warfare entangles himself with the affairs of this life , that he may please him who enlisted him as a soldier .
NKJV	2%20Timothy	2	5	And also ( F ) if anyone competes in athletics , he is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules .
NKJV	2%20Timothy	2	6	The hardworking farmer must be first to partake of the crops .
NKJV	2%20Timothy	2	7	Consider what I say , and [ b ] may the Lord ( G ) give you understanding in all things .
NKJV	2%20Timothy	2	8	Remember that Jesus Christ , ( H ) of the seed of David , ( I ) was raised from the dead ( J ) according to my gospel ,
NKJV	2%20Timothy	2	9	( K ) for which I suffer trouble as an evildoer , ( L ) even to the point of chains ; ( M ) but the word of God is not chained .
NKJV	2%20Timothy	2	10	Therefore ( N ) I endure all things for the sake of the [ c ] elect , ( O ) that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory .
NKJV	2%20Timothy	2	11	This is a faithful saying : For ( P ) if we died with Him , We shall also live with Him .
NKJV	2%20Timothy	2	12	( Q ) If we endure , We shall also reign with Him . ( R ) If we deny Him , He also will deny us .
NKJV	2%20Timothy	2	13	If we are faithless , He remains faithful ; He ( S ) can not deny Himself . Approved and Disapproved Workers
NKJV	2%20Timothy	2	14	Remind them of these things , ( T ) charging them before the Lord not to [ d ] strive about words to no profit , to the ruin of the hearers .

NKJV	2%20Timothy	2	16	But shun profane and [ e ] idle babblings , for they will [ f ] increase to more ungodliness .
NKJV	2%20Timothy	2	17	And their message will spread like cancer . ( V ) Hymenaeus and Philetus are of this sort ,
NKJV	2%20Timothy	2	18	who have strayed concerning the truth , ( W ) saying that the resurrection is already past ; and they overthrow the faith of some .
NKJV	2%20Timothy	2	19	Nevertheless ( X ) the solid foundation of God stands , having this seal : “ The Lord ( Y ) knows those who are His , ” and , “ Let everyone who names the name of [ g ] Christ depart from iniquity. ”
NKJV	2%20Timothy	2	20	But in a great house there are not only ( Z ) vessels of gold and silver , but also of wood and clay , some for honor and some for dishonor .
NKJV	2%20Timothy	2	21	Therefore if anyone cleanses himself from the latter , he will be a vessel for honor , [ h ] sanctified and useful for the Master , ( AA ) prepared for every good work .
NKJV	2%20Timothy	2	22	( AB ) Flee also youthful lusts ; but pursue righteousness , faith , love , peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart .
NKJV	2%20Timothy	2	23	But avoid foolish and ignorant disputes , knowing that they generate strife .

NKJV	2%20Timothy	2	25	( AF ) in humility correcting those who are in opposition , ( AG ) if God perhaps will grant them repentance , ( AH ) so that they may know the truth ,

NKJV	2%20Timothy	3	6	For ( F ) of this sort are those who creep into households and make captives of gullible women loaded down with sins , led away by various lusts ,
NKJV	2%20Timothy	3	7	always learning and never able ( G ) to come to the knowledge of the truth .
NKJV	2%20Timothy	3	8	( H ) Now as Jannes and Jambres resisted Moses , so do these also resist the truth : ( I ) men of corrupt minds , ( J ) disapproved concerning the faith ;

NKJV	2%20Timothy	3	12	Yes , and ( Q ) all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution .
NKJV	2%20Timothy	3	13	( R ) But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse , deceiving and being deceived .

NKJV	2%20Timothy	3	15	and that from childhood you have known ( T ) the Holy Scriptures , which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus .

NKJV	2%20Timothy	4	4	and they will turn their ears away from the truth , and ( I ) be turned aside to fables .
NKJV	2%20Timothy	4	3	( F ) For the time will come when they will not endure ( G ) sound doctrine , ( H ) but according to their own desires , because they have itching ears , they will heap up for themselves teachers ;
NKJV	2%20Timothy	4	5	But you be watchful in all things , ( J ) endure afflictions , do the work of ( K ) an evangelist , fulfill your ministry . Paul ’ s Valedictory

NKJV	2%20Timothy	4	9	Be diligent to come to me quickly ;

NKJV	2%20Timothy	4	11	Only Luke is with me . Get ( T ) Mark and bring him with you , for he is useful to me for ministry .
NKJV	2%20Timothy	4	12	And ( U ) Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus .
NKJV	2%20Timothy	4	13	Bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas when you come—and the books , especially the parchments .
NKJV	2%20Timothy	4	14	( V ) Alexander the coppersmith did me much harm . May the Lord repay him according to his works .
NKJV	2%20Timothy	4	15	You also must beware of him , for he has greatly resisted our words .

NKJV	Titus	1	6	if a man is blameless , the husband of one wife , ( F ) having faithful children not accused of [ b ] dissipation or insubordination .
NKJV	Titus	1	7	For a [ c ] bishop must be blameless , as a steward of God , not self-willed , not quick-tempered , ( G ) not given to wine , not violent , not greedy for money ,

NKJV	Titus	1	10	For there are many insubordinate , both idle ( H ) talkers and deceivers , especially those of the circumcision ,
NKJV	Titus	1	11	whose mouths must be stopped , who subvert whole households , teaching things which they ought not , ( I ) for the sake of dishonest gain .
NKJV	Titus	1	12	( J ) One of them , a prophet of their own , said , “ Cretans are always liars , evil beasts , lazy gluttons. ”
NKJV	Titus	1	13	This testimony is true . ( K ) Therefore rebuke them sharply , that they may be sound in the faith ,

NKJV	Hebrews	2	5	For He has not put ( K ) the world to come , of which we speak , in subjection to angels .

NKJV	Hebrews	2	8	( M ) You have put all things in subjection under his feet. ” For in that He put all in subjection under him , He left nothing that is not put under him . But now ( N ) we do not yet see all things put under him .
NKJV	Hebrews	2	9	But we see Jesus , ( O ) who was made [ f ] a little lower than the angels , for the suffering of death ( P ) crowned with glory and honor , that He , by the grace of God , might taste death ( Q ) for everyone . Bringing Many Sons to Glory
NKJV	Hebrews	2	10	For it was fitting for Him , ( R ) for whom are all things and by whom are all things , in bringing many sons to glory , to make the captain of their salvation ( S ) perfect through sufferings .
NKJV	Hebrews	2	11	For ( T ) both He who [ g ] sanctifies and those who are being sanctified ( U ) are all of one , for which reason ( V ) He is not ashamed to call them brethren ,
NKJV	Hebrews	2	12	saying : ( W ) “ I will declare Your name to My brethren ; In the midst of the assembly I will sing praise to You. ”
NKJV	Hebrews	2	13	And again : ( X ) “ I will put My trust in Him. ” And again : ( Y ) “ Here am I and the children whom God has given Me. ”
NKJV	Hebrews	2	14	Inasmuch then as the children have partaken of flesh and blood , He ( Z ) Himself likewise shared in the same , ( AA ) that through death He might destroy him who had the power of ( AB ) death , that is , the devil ,
NKJV	Hebrews	2	15	and release those who ( AC ) through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage .
NKJV	Hebrews	2	16	For indeed He does not [ h ] give aid to angels , but He does [ i ] give aid to the seed of Abraham .
NKJV	Hebrews	2	17	Therefore , in all things He had ( AD ) to be made like His brethren , that He might be ( AE ) a merciful and faithful High Priest in things pertaining to God , to make propitiation for the sins of the people .

NKJV	Hebrews	3	3	For this One has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses , inasmuch as ( B ) He who built the house has more honor than the house .
NKJV	Hebrews	3	2	who was faithful to Him who appointed Him , as ( A ) Moses also was faithful in all His house .
NKJV	Hebrews	3	4	For every house is built by someone , but ( C ) He who built all things is God .
NKJV	Hebrews	3	5	( D ) And Moses indeed was faithful in all His house as ( E ) a servant , ( F ) for a testimony of those things which would be spoken afterward ,
NKJV	Hebrews	3	6	but Christ as ( G ) a Son over His own house , ( H ) whose house we are ( I ) if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope [ a ] firm to the end . Be Faithful ( J )
NKJV	Hebrews	3	7	Therefore , as ( K ) the Holy Spirit says : ( L ) “ Today , if you will hear His voice ,
NKJV	Hebrews	3	8	Do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion , In the day of trial in the wilderness ,
NKJV	Hebrews	3	9	Where your fathers tested Me , tried Me , And saw My works forty years .
NKJV	Hebrews	3	10	Therefore I was angry with that generation , And said , ‘ They always go astray in their heart , And they have not known My ways. ’
NKJV	Hebrews	3	11	So I swore in My wrath , ‘ They shall not enter My rest. ’ ”
NKJV	Hebrews	3	12	Beware , brethren , lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living God ;
NKJV	Hebrews	3	13	but [ b ] exhort one another daily , while it is called “ Today , ” lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin .
NKJV	Hebrews	3	14	For we have become partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast to the end ,
NKJV	Hebrews	3	15	while it is said : ( M ) “ Today , if you will hear His voice , Do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion. ” Failure of the Wilderness Wanderers
NKJV	Hebrews	3	16	( N ) For who , having heard , rebelled ? Indeed , was it not all who came out of Egypt , led by Moses ?
NKJV	Hebrews	3	17	Now with whom was He angry forty years ? Was it not with those who sinned , ( O ) whose corpses fell in the wilderness ?
NKJV	Hebrews	3	18	And ( P ) to whom did He swear that they would not enter His rest , but to those who did not obey ?

NKJV	Hebrews	4	4	For He has spoken in a certain place of the seventh day in this way : ( C ) “ And God rested on the seventh day from all His works ” ;
NKJV	Hebrews	4	2	For indeed the gospel was preached to us as well as to them ; but the word which they heard did not profit them , [ a ] not being mixed with faith in those who heard it .
NKJV	Hebrews	4	3	For we who have believed do enter that rest , as He has said : ( B ) “ So I swore in My wrath , ‘ They shall not enter My rest , ’ ” although the works were finished from the foundation of the world .
NKJV	Hebrews	4	5	and again in this place : ( D ) “ They shall not enter My rest. ”
NKJV	Hebrews	4	6	Since therefore it remains that some must enter it , and those to whom it was first preached did not enter because of disobedience ,
NKJV	Hebrews	4	7	again He designates a certain day , saying in David , “ Today , ” after such a long time , as it has been said : ( E ) “ Today , if you will hear His voice , Do not harden your hearts. ”
NKJV	Hebrews	4	8	For if [ b ] Joshua had ( F ) given them rest , then He would not afterward have spoken of another day .
NKJV	Hebrews	4	9	There remains therefore a rest for the people of God .
NKJV	Hebrews	4	10	For he who has entered His rest has himself also ceased from his works as God did from His . The Word Discovers Our Condition
NKJV	Hebrews	4	11	( G ) Let us therefore be diligent to enter that rest , lest anyone fall according to the same example of disobedience .
NKJV	Hebrews	4	12	For the word of God is ( H ) living and powerful , and ( I ) sharper than any ( J ) two-edged sword , piercing even to the division of soul and spirit , and of joints and marrow , and is ( K ) a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart .
NKJV	Hebrews	4	13	( L ) And there is no creature hidden from His sight , but all things are ( M ) naked and open to the eyes of Him to whom we must give account . Our Compassionate High Priest
NKJV	Hebrews	4	14	Seeing then that we have a great ( N ) High Priest who has passed through the heavens , Jesus the Son of God , ( O ) let us hold fast our confession .
NKJV	Hebrews	4	15	For ( P ) we do not have a High Priest who can not sympathize with our weaknesses , but ( Q ) was in all points tempted as we are , ( R ) yet without sin .
NKJV	Hebrews	4	16	( S ) Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace , that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need .

NKJV	Hebrews	5	5	( E ) So also Christ did not glorify Himself to become High Priest , but it was He who said to Him : ( F ) “ You are My Son , Today I have begotten You. ”
NKJV	Hebrews	5	2	He can [ a ] have compassion on those who are ignorant and going astray , since he himself is also subject to ( B ) weakness .
NKJV	Hebrews	5	3	Because of this he is required as for the people , so also for ( C ) himself , to offer sacrifices for sins .
NKJV	Hebrews	5	4	And no man takes this honor to himself , but he who is called by God , just as ( D ) Aaron was . A Priest Forever
NKJV	Hebrews	5	6	As He also says in another place : ( G ) “ You are a priest forever According to the order of Melchizedek ” ;
NKJV	Hebrews	5	7	who , in the days of His flesh , when He had ( H ) offered up prayers and supplications , ( I ) with vehement cries and tears to Him ( J ) who was able to save Him from death , and was heard ( K ) because of His godly fear ,
NKJV	Hebrews	5	8	though He was a Son , yet He learned ( L ) obedience by the things which He suffered .
NKJV	Hebrews	5	9	And ( M ) having been perfected , He became the author of eternal salvation to all who obey Him ,
NKJV	Hebrews	5	10	called by God as High Priest ( N ) “ according to the order of Melchizedek , ”
NKJV	Hebrews	5	11	of whom ( O ) we have much to say , and hard to explain , since you have become ( P ) dull of hearing . Spiritual Immaturity
NKJV	Hebrews	5	12	For though by this time you ought to be teachers , you need someone to teach you again the first principles of the [ b ] oracles of God ; and you have come to need ( Q ) milk and not solid food .
NKJV	Hebrews	5	13	For everyone who partakes only of milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness , for he is ( R ) a babe .
NKJV	Hebrews	5	14	But solid food belongs to those who are [ c ] of full age , that is , those who by reason of [ d ] use have their senses exercised ( S ) to discern both good and evil .

NKJV	Hebrews	6	6	[ c ] if they fall away , to renew them again to repentance , ( I ) since they crucify again for themselves the Son of God , and put Him to an open shame .
NKJV	Hebrews	6	2	( C ) of the doctrine of baptisms , ( D ) of laying on of hands , ( E ) of resurrection of the dead , ( F ) and of eternal judgment .
NKJV	Hebrews	6	3	And this [ b ] we will do if God permits .
NKJV	Hebrews	6	4	For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened , and have tasted ( G ) the heavenly gift , and ( H ) have become partakers of the Holy Spirit ,
NKJV	Hebrews	6	5	and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come ,
NKJV	Hebrews	6	7	For the earth which drinks in the rain that often comes upon it , and bears herbs useful for those by whom it is cultivated , ( J ) receives blessing from God ;
NKJV	Hebrews	6	8	( K ) but if it bears thorns and briers , it is rejected and near to being cursed , whose end is to be burned . A Better Estimate
NKJV	Hebrews	6	9	But , beloved , we are confident of better things concerning you , yes , things that accompany salvation , though we speak in this manner .
NKJV	Hebrews	6	10	For ( L ) God is not unjust to forget ( M ) your work and [ d ] labor of love which you have shown toward His name , in that you have ( N ) ministered to the saints , and do minister .
NKJV	Hebrews	6	11	And we desire that each one of you show the same diligence ( O ) to the full assurance of hope until the end ,
NKJV	Hebrews	6	12	that you do not become [ e ] sluggish , but imitate those who through faith and patience ( P ) inherit the promises . God ’ s Infallible Purpose in Christ
NKJV	Hebrews	6	13	For when God made a promise to Abraham , because He could swear by no one greater , ( Q ) He swore by Himself ,
NKJV	Hebrews	6	14	saying , ( R ) “ Surely blessing I will bless you , and multiplying I will multiply you. ”
NKJV	Hebrews	6	15	And so , after he had patiently endured , he obtained the ( S ) promise .
NKJV	Hebrews	6	16	For men indeed swear by the greater , and ( T ) an oath for confirmation is for them an end of all dispute .
NKJV	Hebrews	6	17	Thus God , determining to show more abundantly to ( U ) the heirs of promise ( V ) the [ f ] immutability of His counsel , [ g ] confirmed it by an oath ,
NKJV	Hebrews	6	18	that by two [ h ] immutable things , in which it is impossible for God to ( W ) lie , we [ i ] might have strong consolation , who have fled for refuge to lay hold of the hope ( X ) set before us .
NKJV	Hebrews	6	19	This hope we have as an anchor of the soul , both sure and steadfast , ( Y ) and which enters the Presence behind the veil ,

NKJV	Hebrews	7	7	Now beyond all contradiction the lesser is blessed by the better .
NKJV	Hebrews	7	2	to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all , first being translated “ king of righteousness , ” and then also king of Salem , meaning “ king of peace , ”
NKJV	Hebrews	7	3	without father , without mother , without genealogy , having neither beginning of days nor end of life , but made like the Son of God , remains a priest continually .
NKJV	Hebrews	7	4	Now consider how great this man was , to whom even the patriarch Abraham gave a tenth of the [ a ] spoils .
NKJV	Hebrews	7	5	And indeed ( C ) those who are of the sons of Levi , who receive the priesthood , have a commandment to receive tithes from the people according to the law , that is , from their brethren , though they have come from the loins of Abraham ;
NKJV	Hebrews	7	6	but he whose genealogy is not derived from them received tithes from Abraham ( D ) and blessed ( E ) him who had the promises .
NKJV	Hebrews	7	8	Here mortal men receive tithes , but there he receives them , ( F ) of whom it is witnessed that he lives .
NKJV	Hebrews	7	9	Even Levi , who receives tithes , paid tithes through Abraham , so to speak ,
NKJV	Hebrews	7	10	for he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him . Need for a New Priesthood ( G )
NKJV	Hebrews	7	11	( H ) Therefore , if perfection were through the Levitical priesthood ( for under it the people received the law ) , what further need was there that another priest should rise according to the order of Melchizedek , and not be called according to the order of Aaron ?
NKJV	Hebrews	7	12	For the priesthood being changed , of necessity there is also a change of the law .
NKJV	Hebrews	7	13	For He of whom these things are spoken belongs to another tribe , from which no man has [ b ] officiated at the altar .
NKJV	Hebrews	7	14	For it is evident that ( I ) our Lord arose from ( J ) Judah , of which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning [ c ] priesthood .
NKJV	Hebrews	7	15	And it is yet far more evident if , in the likeness of Melchizedek , there arises another priest
NKJV	Hebrews	7	16	who has come , not according to the law of a fleshly commandment , but according to the power of an endless life .
NKJV	Hebrews	7	17	For [ d ] He testifies : ( K ) “ You are a priest forever According to the order of Melchizedek. ”
NKJV	Hebrews	7	18	For on the one hand there is an annulling of the former commandment because of ( L ) its weakness and unprofitableness ,
NKJV	Hebrews	7	19	for ( M ) the law made nothing [ e ] perfect ; on the other hand , there is the bringing in of ( N ) a better hope , through which ( O ) we draw near to God . Greatness of the New Priest
NKJV	Hebrews	7	20	And inasmuch as He was not made priest without an oath
NKJV	Hebrews	7	21	( for they have become priests without an oath , but He with an oath by Him who said to Him : ( P ) “ The Lord has sworn And will not relent , ‘ You are a priest [ f ] forever According to the order of Melchizedek ’ ” ) ,
NKJV	Hebrews	7	22	by so much more Jesus has become a [ g ] surety of a ( Q ) better covenant .
NKJV	Hebrews	7	23	Also there were many priests , because they were prevented by death from continuing .
NKJV	Hebrews	7	24	But He , because He continues forever , has an unchangeable priesthood .
NKJV	Hebrews	7	25	Therefore He is also ( R ) able to save [ h ] to the uttermost those who come to God through Him , since He always lives ( S ) to make intercession for them .
NKJV	Hebrews	7	26	For such a High Priest was fitting for us , ( T ) who is holy , [ i ] harmless , undefiled , separate from sinners , ( U ) and has become higher than the heavens ;
NKJV	Hebrews	7	27	who does not need daily , as those high priests , to offer up sacrifices , first for His ( V ) own sins and then for the people ’ s , for this He did once for all when He offered up Himself .
NKJV	Hebrews	7	28	For the law appoints as high priests men who have weakness , but the word of the oath , which came after the law , appoints the Son who has been perfected forever .

NKJV	Hebrews	8	8	Because finding fault with them , He says : ( M ) “ Behold , the days are coming , says the Lord , when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah—
NKJV	Hebrews	8	2	a Minister of ( B ) the [ a ] sanctuary and of ( C ) the true tabernacle which the Lord erected , and not man .
NKJV	Hebrews	8	3	For ( D ) every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices . Therefore ( E ) it is necessary that this One also have something to offer .
NKJV	Hebrews	8	4	For if He were on earth , He would not be a priest , since there are priests who offer the gifts according to the law ;
NKJV	Hebrews	8	5	who serve ( F ) the copy and ( G ) shadow of the heavenly things , as Moses was divinely instructed when he was about to make the tabernacle . For He said , ( H ) “ See that you make all things according to the pattern shown you on the mountain. ”
NKJV	Hebrews	8	6	But now ( I ) He has obtained a more excellent ministry , inasmuch as He is also Mediator of a ( J ) better covenant , which was established on better promises . A New Covenant ( K )
NKJV	Hebrews	8	7	For if that ( L ) first covenant had been faultless , then no place would have been sought for a second .
NKJV	Hebrews	8	9	not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt ; because they did not continue in My covenant , and I disregarded them , says the Lord .
NKJV	Hebrews	8	10	For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days , says the ( N ) Lord : I will put My laws in their mind and write them on their hearts ; and ( O ) I will be their God , and they shall be My people .
NKJV	Hebrews	8	11	( P ) None of them shall teach his neighbor , and none his brother , saying , ‘ Know the ( Q ) Lord , ’ for all shall know Me , from the least of them to the greatest of them .
NKJV	Hebrews	8	12	For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness , ( R ) and their sins [ b ] and their lawless deeds I will remember no more. ”

NKJV	Hebrews	9	9	It was symbolic for the present time in which both gifts and sacrifices are offered ( N ) which can not make him who performed the service perfect in regard to the conscience—
NKJV	Hebrews	9	2	For a tabernacle was prepared : the first part , in which was the lampstand , the table , and the showbread , which is called the [ a ] sanctuary ;
NKJV	Hebrews	9	3	( C ) and behind the second veil , the part of the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of All ,
NKJV	Hebrews	9	4	which had the ( D ) golden censer and ( E ) the ark of the covenant overlaid on all sides with gold , in which were ( F ) the golden pot that had the manna , ( G ) Aaron ’ s rod that budded , and ( H ) the tablets of the covenant ;
NKJV	Hebrews	9	5	and ( I ) above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat . Of these things we can not now speak in detail . Limitations of the Earthly Service
NKJV	Hebrews	9	6	Now when these things had been thus prepared , ( J ) the priests always went into the first part of the tabernacle , performing the services .
NKJV	Hebrews	9	7	But into the second part the high priest went alone ( K ) once a year , not without blood , which he offered for ( L ) himself and for the people ’ s sins committed in ignorance ;
NKJV	Hebrews	9	8	the Holy Spirit indicating this , that ( M ) the way into the Holiest of All was not yet made manifest while the first tabernacle was still standing .
NKJV	Hebrews	9	10	concerned only with ( O ) foods and drinks , ( P ) various [ b ] washings , ( Q ) and fleshly ordinances imposed until the time of reformation . The Heavenly Sanctuary
NKJV	Hebrews	9	11	But Christ came as High Priest of ( R ) the good things [ c ] to come , with the greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands , that is , not of this creation .
NKJV	Hebrews	9	12	Not ( S ) with the blood of goats and calves , but ( T ) with His own blood He entered the Most Holy Place ( U ) once for all , ( V ) having obtained eternal redemption .
NKJV	Hebrews	9	13	For if ( W ) the blood of bulls and goats and ( X ) the ashes of a heifer , sprinkling the unclean , [ d ] sanctifies for the [ e ] purifying of the flesh ,
NKJV	Hebrews	9	14	how much more shall the blood of Christ , who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without [ f ] spot to God , ( Y ) cleanse your conscience from ( Z ) dead works ( AA ) to serve the living God ?
NKJV	Hebrews	9	15	And for this reason ( AB ) He is the Mediator of the new covenant , by means of death , for the redemption of the transgressions under the first covenant , that ( AC ) those who are called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance . The Mediator ’ s Death Necessary
NKJV	Hebrews	9	16	For where there is a testament , there must also of necessity be the death of the testator .
NKJV	Hebrews	9	17	For ( AD ) a testament is in force after men are dead , since it has no power at all while the testator lives .
NKJV	Hebrews	9	18	( AE ) Therefore not even the first covenant was dedicated without blood .
NKJV	Hebrews	9	19	For when Moses had spoken every [ g ] precept to all the people according to the law , ( AF ) he took the blood of calves and goats , ( AG ) with water , scarlet wool , and hyssop , and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people ,
NKJV	Hebrews	9	20	saying , ( AH ) “ This is the ( AI ) blood of the covenant which God has commanded you. ”
NKJV	Hebrews	9	21	Then likewise ( AJ ) he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry .
NKJV	Hebrews	9	22	And according to the law almost all things are [ h ] purified with blood , and ( AK ) without shedding of blood there is no [ i ] remission . Greatness of Christ ’ s Sacrifice
NKJV	Hebrews	9	23	Therefore it was necessary that ( AL ) the copies of the things in the heavens should be [ j ] purified with these , but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these .
NKJV	Hebrews	9	24	For ( AM ) Christ has not entered the holy places made with hands , which are [ k ] copies of ( AN ) the true , but into heaven itself , now ( AO ) to appear in the presence of God for us ;
NKJV	Hebrews	9	25	not that He should offer Himself often , as ( AP ) the high priest enters the Most Holy Place every year with blood of another—
NKJV	Hebrews	9	26	He then would have had to suffer often since the foundation of the world ; but now , once at the end of the ages , He has appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself .
NKJV	Hebrews	9	27	( AQ ) And as it is appointed for men to die once , ( AR ) but after this the judgment ,
NKJV	Hebrews	9	28	so ( AS ) Christ was ( AT ) offered once to bear the sins ( AU ) of many . To those who ( AV ) eagerly wait for Him He will appear a second time , apart from sin , for salvation .

NKJV	Hebrews	10	10	( F ) By that will we have been [ c ] sanctified ( G ) through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all . Christ ’ s Death Perfects the Sanctified
NKJV	Hebrews	10	2	For then would they not have ceased to be offered ? For the worshipers , once [ a ] purified , would have had no more consciousness of sins .
NKJV	Hebrews	10	3	But in those sacrifices there is a reminder of sins every year .
NKJV	Hebrews	10	4	For ( C ) it is not possible that the blood of bulls and goats could take away sins . Christ ’ s Death Fulfills God ’ s Will ( D )
NKJV	Hebrews	10	5	Therefore , when He came into the world , He said : ( E ) “ Sacrifice and offering You did not desire , But a body You have prepared for Me .
NKJV	Hebrews	10	6	In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin You had no pleasure .
NKJV	Hebrews	10	7	Then I said , ‘ Behold , I have come— In the volume of the book it is written of Me— To do Your will , O God. ’ ”
NKJV	Hebrews	10	8	Previously saying , “ Sacrifice and offering , burnt offerings , and offerings for sin You did not desire , nor had pleasure in them ” ( which are offered according to the law ) ,
NKJV	Hebrews	10	9	then He said , “ Behold , I have come to do Your will , [ b ] O God. ” He takes away the first that He may establish the second .
NKJV	Hebrews	10	11	And every priest stands ( H ) ministering daily and offering repeatedly the same sacrifices , which can never take away sins .
NKJV	Hebrews	10	12	( I ) But this Man , after He had offered one sacrifice for sins forever , sat down ( J ) at the right hand of God ,
NKJV	Hebrews	10	13	from that time waiting ( K ) till His enemies are made His footstool .
NKJV	Hebrews	10	14	For by one offering He has perfected forever those who are being [ d ] sanctified .
NKJV	Hebrews	10	15	But the Holy Spirit also witnesses to us ; for after He had said before ,
NKJV	Hebrews	10	16	( L ) “ This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days , says the Lord : I will put My laws into their hearts , and in their minds I will write them , ”
NKJV	Hebrews	10	17	then He adds , ( M ) “ Their sins and their lawless deeds I will remember no more. ”
NKJV	Hebrews	10	18	Now where there is [ e ] remission of these , there is no longer an offering for sin . Hold Fast Your Confession
NKJV	Hebrews	10	19	Therefore , brethren , having ( N ) boldness [ f ] to enter ( O ) the Holiest by the blood of Jesus ,
NKJV	Hebrews	10	20	by a new and ( P ) living way which He consecrated for us , through the veil , that is , His flesh ,
NKJV	Hebrews	10	21	and having a High Priest over the house of God ,
NKJV	Hebrews	10	22	let us ( Q ) draw near with a true heart ( R ) in full assurance of faith , having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water .
NKJV	Hebrews	10	23	Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering , for ( S ) He who promised is faithful .
NKJV	Hebrews	10	24	And let us consider one another in order to stir up love and good works ,
NKJV	Hebrews	10	25	( T ) not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together , as is the manner of some , but exhorting one another , and ( U ) so much the more as you see ( V ) the Day approaching . The Just Live by Faith
NKJV	Hebrews	10	26	For ( W ) if we sin willfully ( X ) after we have received the knowledge of the truth , there ( Y ) no longer remains a sacrifice for sins ,
NKJV	Hebrews	10	27	but a certain fearful expectation of judgment , and ( Z ) fiery indignation which will devour the adversaries .
NKJV	Hebrews	10	28	Anyone who has rejected Moses ’ law dies without mercy on the testimony of two or three ( AA ) witnesses .
NKJV	Hebrews	10	29	( AB ) Of how much worse punishment , do you suppose , will he be thought worthy who has trampled the Son of God underfoot , ( AC ) counted the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified a common thing , ( AD ) and insulted the Spirit of grace ?
NKJV	Hebrews	10	30	For we know Him who said , ( AE ) “ Vengeance is Mine , I will repay , ” [ g ] says the Lord . And again , ( AF ) “ The Lord will judge His people. ”
NKJV	Hebrews	10	31	( AG ) It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God .
NKJV	Hebrews	10	32	But ( AH ) recall the former days in which , after you were [ h ] illuminated , you endured a great struggle with sufferings :
NKJV	Hebrews	10	33	partly while you were made ( AI ) a spectacle both by reproaches and tribulations , and partly while ( AJ ) you became companions of those who were so treated ;
NKJV	Hebrews	10	34	for you had compassion on [ i ] me ( AK ) in my chains , and ( AL ) joyfully accepted the plundering of your [ j ] goods , knowing that ( AM ) you have a better and an enduring possession for yourselves [ k ] in heaven .
NKJV	Hebrews	10	35	Therefore do not cast away your confidence , ( AN ) which has great reward .
NKJV	Hebrews	10	36	( AO ) For you have need of endurance , so that after you have done the will of God , ( AP ) you may receive the promise :
NKJV	Hebrews	10	37	“ For ( AQ ) yet a little while , And ( AR ) He [ l ] who is coming will come and will not [ m ] tarry .
NKJV	Hebrews	10	38	Now ( AS ) the [ n ] just shall live by faith ; But if anyone draws back , My soul has no pleasure in him. ”
NKJV	Hebrews	10	39	But we are not of those ( AT ) who draw back to [ o ] perdition , but of those who ( AU ) believe to the saving of the soul .

NKJV	Hebrews	11	11	By faith ( P ) Sarah herself also received strength to conceive seed , and ( Q ) she [ d ] bore a child when she was past the age , because she judged Him ( R ) faithful who had promised .
NKJV	Hebrews	11	2	For by it the elders obtained a good testimony .
NKJV	Hebrews	11	3	By faith we understand that ( B ) the [ c ] worlds were framed by the word of God , so that the things which are seen were not made of things which are visible . Faith at the Dawn of History ( C )
NKJV	Hebrews	11	4	By faith ( D ) Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain , through which he obtained witness that he was righteous , God testifying of his gifts ; and through it he being dead still ( E ) speaks .
NKJV	Hebrews	11	5	By faith Enoch was taken away so that he did not see death , ( F ) “ and was not found , because God had taken him ” ; for before he was taken he had this testimony , that he pleased God .
NKJV	Hebrews	11	6	But without faith it is impossible to please Him , for he who comes to God must believe that He is , and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him .
NKJV	Hebrews	11	7	By faith ( G ) Noah , being divinely warned of things not yet seen , moved with godly fear , ( H ) prepared an ark for the saving of his household , by which he condemned the world and became heir of ( I ) the righteousness which is according to faith . Faithful Abraham ( J )
NKJV	Hebrews	11	8	By faith ( K ) Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to the place which he would receive as an inheritance . And he went out , not knowing where he was going .
NKJV	Hebrews	11	9	By faith he dwelt in the land of promise as in a foreign country , ( L ) dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob , ( M ) the heirs with him of the same promise ;
NKJV	Hebrews	11	10	for he waited for ( N ) the city which has foundations , ( O ) whose builder and maker is God .
NKJV	Hebrews	11	12	Therefore from one man , and him as good as ( S ) dead , were born as many as the ( T ) stars of the sky in multitude—innumerable as the sand which is by the seashore . The Heavenly Hope
NKJV	Hebrews	11	13	These all died in faith , ( U ) not having received the ( V ) promises , but ( W ) having seen them afar off [ e ] were assured of them , embraced them and ( X ) confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth .
NKJV	Hebrews	11	14	For those who say such things ( Y ) declare plainly that they seek a homeland .
NKJV	Hebrews	11	15	And truly if they had called to mind ( Z ) that country from which they had come out , they would have had opportunity to return .
NKJV	Hebrews	11	16	But now they desire a better , that is , a heavenly country . Therefore God is not ashamed ( AA ) to be called their God , for He has ( AB ) prepared a city for them . The Faith of the Patriarchs ( AC )
NKJV	Hebrews	11	17	By faith Abraham , ( AD ) when he was tested , offered up Isaac , and he who had received the promises offered up his only begotten son ,
NKJV	Hebrews	11	18	[ f ] of whom it was said , ( AE ) “ In Isaac your seed shall be called , ”
NKJV	Hebrews	11	19	concluding that God ( AF ) was able to raise him up , even from the dead , from which he also received him in a figurative sense .
NKJV	Hebrews	11	20	By faith ( AG ) Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come .
NKJV	Hebrews	11	21	By faith Jacob , when he was dying , ( AH ) blessed each of the sons of Joseph , and worshiped , leaning on the top of his staff .
NKJV	Hebrews	11	22	By faith ( AI ) Joseph , when he was dying , made mention of the departure of the children of Israel , and gave instructions concerning his bones . The Faith of Moses ( AJ )
NKJV	Hebrews	11	23	By faith ( AK ) Moses , when he was born , was hidden three months by his parents , because they saw he was a beautiful child ; and they were not afraid of the king ’ s ( AL ) command .
NKJV	Hebrews	11	24	By faith ( AM ) Moses , when he became of age , refused to be called the son of Pharaoh ’ s daughter ,
NKJV	Hebrews	11	25	choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the [ g ] passing pleasures of sin ,
NKJV	Hebrews	11	26	esteeming ( AN ) the [ h ] reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures [ i ] in Egypt ; for he looked to the ( AO ) reward .
NKJV	Hebrews	11	27	By faith ( AP ) he forsook Egypt , not fearing the wrath of the king ; for he endured as seeing Him who is invisible .
NKJV	Hebrews	11	28	By faith ( AQ ) he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of blood , lest he who destroyed the firstborn should touch them .
NKJV	Hebrews	11	29	By faith ( AR ) they passed through the Red Sea as by dry land , whereas the Egyptians , attempting to do so , were drowned . By Faith They Overcame
NKJV	Hebrews	11	30	By faith ( AS ) the walls of Jericho fell down after they were encircled for seven days .
NKJV	Hebrews	11	31	By faith ( AT ) the harlot Rahab did not perish with those who [ j ] did not believe , when ( AU ) she had received the spies with peace .
NKJV	Hebrews	11	32	And what more shall I say ? For the time would fail me to tell of ( AV ) Gideon and ( AW ) Barak and ( AX ) Samson and ( AY ) Jephthah , also of ( AZ ) David and ( BA ) Samuel and the prophets :
NKJV	Hebrews	11	33	who through faith subdued kingdoms , worked righteousness , obtained promises , ( BB ) stopped the mouths of lions ,
NKJV	Hebrews	11	34	( BC ) quenched the violence of fire , escaped the edge of the sword , out of weakness were made strong , became valiant in battle , turned to flight the armies of the aliens .
NKJV	Hebrews	11	35	( BD ) Women received their dead raised to life again . Others were ( BE ) tortured , not accepting deliverance , that they might obtain a better resurrection .
NKJV	Hebrews	11	36	Still others had trial of mockings and scourgings , yes , and ( BF ) of chains and imprisonment .
NKJV	Hebrews	11	37	( BG ) They were stoned , they were sawn in two , [ k ] were tempted , were slain with the sword . ( BH ) They wandered about ( BI ) in sheepskins and goatskins , being destitute , afflicted , tormented—
NKJV	Hebrews	11	38	of whom the world was not worthy . They wandered in deserts and mountains , ( BJ ) in dens and caves of the earth .
NKJV	Hebrews	11	39	And all these , ( BK ) having obtained a good testimony through faith , did not receive the promise ,
NKJV	Hebrews	11	40	God having provided something better for us , that they should not be ( BL ) made perfect apart from us .

NKJV	Hebrews	12	12	Therefore ( T ) strengthen the hands which hang down , and the feeble knees ,
NKJV	Hebrews	12	2	looking unto Jesus , the [ a ] author and [ b ] finisher of our faith , ( D ) who for the joy that was set before Him ( E ) endured the cross , despising the shame , and ( F ) has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God . The Discipline of God ( G )
NKJV	Hebrews	12	3	( H ) For consider Him who endured such hostility from sinners against Himself , ( I ) lest you become weary and discouraged in your souls .
NKJV	Hebrews	12	4	( J ) You have not yet resisted to bloodshed , striving against sin .
NKJV	Hebrews	12	5	And you have forgotten the exhortation which speaks to you as to sons : ( K ) “ My son , do not despise the [ c ] chastening of the Lord , Nor be discouraged when you are rebuked by Him ;
NKJV	Hebrews	12	6	For ( L ) whom the Lord loves He chastens , And scourges every son whom He receives. ”
NKJV	Hebrews	12	7	( M ) If [ d ] you endure chastening , God deals with you as with sons ; for what ( N ) son is there whom a father does not chasten ?
NKJV	Hebrews	12	8	But if you are without chastening , ( O ) of which all have become partakers , then you are illegitimate and not sons .
NKJV	Hebrews	12	9	Furthermore , we have had human fathers who corrected us , and we paid them respect . Shall we not much more readily be in subjection to ( P ) the Father of spirits and live ?
NKJV	Hebrews	12	10	For they indeed for a few days chastened us as seemed best to them , but He for our profit , ( Q ) that we may be partakers of His holiness .
NKJV	Hebrews	12	11	Now no [ e ] chastening seems to be joyful for the present , but painful ; nevertheless , afterward it yields ( R ) the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it . Renew Your Spiritual Vitality ( S )
NKJV	Hebrews	12	13	and make straight paths for your feet , so that what is lame may not be dislocated , but rather be healed .
NKJV	Hebrews	12	14	( U ) Pursue peace with all people , and holiness , ( V ) without which no one will see the Lord :
NKJV	Hebrews	12	15	looking carefully lest anyone ( W ) fall short of the grace of God ; lest any ( X ) root of bitterness springing up cause trouble , and by this many become defiled ;
NKJV	Hebrews	12	16	lest there be any ( Y ) fornicator or [ f ] profane person like Esau , ( Z ) who for one morsel of food sold his birthright .
NKJV	Hebrews	12	17	For you know that afterward , when he wanted to inherit the blessing , he was ( AA ) rejected , for he found no place for repentance , though he sought it diligently with tears . The Glorious Company
NKJV	Hebrews	12	18	For you have not come [ g ] to ( AB ) the mountain that may be touched and that burned with fire , and to blackness and [ h ] darkness and tempest ,
NKJV	Hebrews	12	19	and the sound of a trumpet and the voice of words , so that those who heard it ( AC ) begged that the word should not be spoken to them anymore .

NKJV	Hebrews	12	23	to the [ j ] general assembly and church of ( AF ) the firstborn ( AG ) who are registered in heaven , to God ( AH ) the Judge of all , to the spirits of just men ( AI ) made perfect ,
NKJV	Hebrews	12	24	to Jesus ( AJ ) the Mediator of the new covenant , and to ( AK ) the blood of sprinkling that speaks better things ( AL ) than that of Abel . Hear the Heavenly Voice
NKJV	Hebrews	12	25	See that you do not refuse Him who speaks . For ( AM ) if they did not escape who refused Him who spoke on earth , much more shall we not escape if we turn away from Him who speaks from heaven ,
NKJV	Hebrews	12	26	whose voice then shook the earth ; but now He has promised , saying , ( AN ) “ Yet once more I [ k ] shake not only the earth , but also heaven. ”
NKJV	Hebrews	12	27	Now this , “ Yet once more , ” indicates the ( AO ) removal of those things that are being shaken , as of things that are made , that the things which can not be shaken may remain .
NKJV	Hebrews	12	28	Therefore , since we are receiving a kingdom which can not be shaken , let us have grace , by which we [ l ] may ( AP ) serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear .

NKJV	Hebrews	13	2	( B ) Do not forget to entertain strangers , for by so doing ( C ) some have unwittingly entertained angels .
NKJV	Hebrews	13	3	( D ) Remember the prisoners as if chained with them—those who are mistreated—since you yourselves are in the body also .
NKJV	Hebrews	13	4	( E ) Marriage is honorable among all , and the bed undefiled ; ( F ) but fornicators and adulterers God will judge .
NKJV	Hebrews	13	5	Let your conduct be without covetousness ; be content with such things as you have . For He Himself has said , ( G ) “ I will never leave you nor forsake you. ”
NKJV	Hebrews	13	6	So we may boldly say : ( H ) “ The Lord is my helper ; I will not fear . What can man do to me ? ” Concluding Religious Directions
NKJV	Hebrews	13	7	Remember those who [ a ] rule over you , who have spoken the word of God to you , whose faith follow , considering the outcome of their conduct .
NKJV	Hebrews	13	8	Jesus Christ is ( I ) the same yesterday , today , and forever .
NKJV	Hebrews	13	9	Do not be carried [ b ] about with various and strange doctrines . For it is good that the heart be established by grace , not with foods which have not profited those who have been occupied with them .
NKJV	Hebrews	13	10	We have an altar from which those who serve the tabernacle have no right to eat .
NKJV	Hebrews	13	11	For the bodies of those animals , whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin , are burned outside the camp .
NKJV	Hebrews	13	12	Therefore Jesus also , that He might [ c ] sanctify the people with His own blood , suffered outside the gate .
NKJV	Hebrews	13	14	For here we have no continuing city , but we seek the one to come .
NKJV	Hebrews	13	15	( K ) Therefore by Him let us continually offer ( L ) the sacrifice of praise to God , that is , ( M ) the fruit of our lips , [ d ] giving thanks to His name .
NKJV	Hebrews	13	16	( N ) But do not forget to do good and to share , for ( O ) with such sacrifices God is well pleased .
NKJV	Hebrews	13	17	( P ) Obey those who [ e ] rule over you , and be submissive , for ( Q ) they watch out for your souls , as those who must give account . Let them do so with joy and not with grief , for that would be unprofitable for you . Prayer Requested
NKJV	Hebrews	13	18	( R ) Pray for us ; for we are confident that we have ( S ) a good conscience , in all things desiring to live honorably .
NKJV	Hebrews	13	19	But I especially urge you to do this , that I may be restored to you the sooner . Benediction , Final Exhortation , Farewell
NKJV	Hebrews	13	20	Now may ( T ) the God of peace ( U ) who brought up our Lord Jesus from the dead , ( V ) that great Shepherd of the sheep , ( W ) through the blood of the everlasting covenant ,
NKJV	Hebrews	13	21	make you [ f ] complete in every good work to do His will , ( X ) working in [ g ] you what is well pleasing in His sight , through Jesus Christ , to whom be glory forever and ever . Amen .
NKJV	Hebrews	13	22	And I appeal to you , brethren , bear with the word of exhortation , for I have written to you in few words .
NKJV	Hebrews	13	23	Know that our brother Timothy has been set free , with whom I shall see you if he comes shortly .

NKJV	James	1	1	James , ( A ) a bondservant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ , To the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad : Greetings . Profiting from Trials
NKJV	James	1	2	My brethren , ( B ) count it all joy ( C ) when you fall into various trials ,
NKJV	James	1	3	( D ) knowing that the testing of your faith produces [ a ] patience .
NKJV	James	1	4	But let patience have its perfect work , that you may be [ b ] perfect and complete , lacking nothing .
NKJV	James	1	5	( E ) If any of you lacks wisdom , ( F ) let him ask of God , who gives to all liberally and without reproach , and ( G ) it will be given to him .
NKJV	James	1	6	( H ) But let him ask in faith , with no doubting , for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven and tossed by the wind .
NKJV	James	1	7	For let not that man suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord ;
NKJV	James	1	8	he is ( I ) a double-minded man , unstable in all his ways . The Perspective of Rich and Poor
NKJV	James	1	9	Let the lowly brother glory in his exaltation ,
NKJV	James	1	10	but the rich in his humiliation , because ( J ) as a flower of the field he will pass away .
NKJV	James	1	11	For no sooner has the sun risen with a burning heat than it withers the grass ; its flower falls , and its beautiful appearance perishes . So the rich man also will fade away in his pursuits . Loving God Under Trials
NKJV	James	1	12	( K ) Blessed is the man who endures temptation ; for when he has been approved , he will receive ( L ) the crown of life ( M ) which the Lord has promised to those who love Him .
NKJV	James	1	13	Let no one say when he is tempted , “ I am tempted by God ” ; for God can not be tempted by evil , nor does He Himself tempt anyone .
NKJV	James	1	14	But each one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own desires and enticed .
NKJV	James	1	15	Then , ( N ) when desire has conceived , it gives birth to sin ; and sin , when it is full-grown , ( O ) brings forth death .
NKJV	James	1	16	Do not be deceived , my beloved brethren .
NKJV	James	1	17	( P ) Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above , and comes down from the Father of lights , ( Q ) with whom there is no variation or shadow of turning .
NKJV	James	1	18	( R ) Of His own will He brought us forth by the ( S ) word of truth , ( T ) that we might be a kind of firstfruits of His creatures . Qualities Needed in Trials
NKJV	James	1	19	[ c ] So then , my beloved brethren , let every man be swift to hear , ( U ) slow to speak , ( V ) slow to wrath ;
NKJV	James	1	20	for the wrath of man does not produce the righteousness of God . Doers—Not Hearers Only
NKJV	James	1	21	Therefore ( W ) lay aside all filthiness and [ d ] overflow of wickedness , and receive with meekness the implanted word , ( X ) which is able to save your souls .
NKJV	James	1	22	But ( Y ) be doers of the word , and not hearers only , deceiving yourselves .
NKJV	James	1	23	For ( Z ) if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer , he is like a man observing his natural face in a mirror ;
NKJV	James	1	24	for he observes himself , goes away , and immediately forgets what kind of man he was .
NKJV	James	1	25	But ( AA ) he who looks into the perfect law of liberty and continues in it , and is not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work , ( AB ) this one will be blessed in what he does .
NKJV	James	1	26	If anyone [ e ] among you thinks he is religious , and ( AC ) does not bridle his tongue but deceives his own heart , this one ’ s religion is useless .
NKJV	James	1	27	( AD ) Pure and undefiled religion before God and the Father is this : ( AE ) to visit orphans and widows in their trouble , ( AF ) and to keep oneself unspotted from the world .

NKJV	James	2	2	For if there should come into your assembly a man with gold rings , in [ a ] fine apparel , and there should also come in a poor man in [ b ] filthy clothes ,
NKJV	James	2	3	and you [ c ] pay attention to the one wearing the fine clothes and say to him , “ You sit here in a good place , ” and say to the poor man , “ You stand there , ” or , “ Sit here at my footstool , ”
NKJV	James	2	4	have you not [ d ] shown partiality among yourselves , and become judges with evil thoughts ?
NKJV	James	2	5	Listen , my beloved brethren : ( C ) Has God not chosen the poor of this world to be ( D ) rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom ( E ) which He promised to those who love Him ?
NKJV	James	2	6	But ( F ) you have dishonored the poor man . Do not the rich oppress you ( G ) and drag you into the courts ?
NKJV	James	2	7	Do they not blaspheme that noble name by which you are ( H ) called ?
NKJV	James	2	8	If you really fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture , ( I ) “ You shall love your neighbor as yourself , ” you do well ;
NKJV	James	2	9	but if you [ e ] show partiality , you commit sin , and are convicted by the law as ( J ) transgressors .
NKJV	James	2	10	For whoever shall keep the whole law , and yet ( K ) stumble in one point , ( L ) he is guilty of all .
NKJV	James	2	11	For He who said , ( M ) “ Do not commit adultery , ” also said , ( N ) “ Do not murder. ” Now if you do not commit adultery , but you do murder , you have become a transgressor of the law .
NKJV	James	2	12	So speak and so do as those who will be judged by ( O ) the law of liberty .
NKJV	James	2	13	For ( P ) judgment is without mercy to the one who has shown ( Q ) no ( R ) mercy . ( S ) Mercy triumphs over judgment . Faith Without Works Is Dead ( T )
NKJV	James	2	14	( U ) What does it profit , my brethren , if someone says he has faith but does not have works ? Can faith save him ?
NKJV	James	2	15	( V ) If a brother or sister is naked and destitute of daily food ,
NKJV	James	2	16	and ( W ) one of you says to them , “ Depart in peace , be warmed and filled , ” but you do not give them the things which are needed for the body , what does it profit ?
NKJV	James	2	17	Thus also faith by itself , if it does not have works , is dead .
NKJV	James	2	18	But someone will say , “ You have faith , and I have works. ” ( X ) Show me your faith without [ f ] your works , ( Y ) and I will show you my faith by [ g ] my works .
NKJV	James	2	19	You believe that there is one God . You do well . Even the demons believe—and tremble !
NKJV	James	2	20	But do you want to know , O foolish man , that faith without works is [ h ] dead ?
NKJV	James	2	21	Was not Abraham our father justified by works ( Z ) when he offered Isaac his son on the altar ?
NKJV	James	2	22	Do you see ( AA ) that faith was working together with his works , and by ( AB ) works faith was made [ i ] perfect ?
NKJV	James	2	23	And the Scripture was fulfilled which says , ( AC ) “ Abraham believed God , and it was [ j ] accounted to him for righteousness. ” And he was called ( AD ) the friend of God .
NKJV	James	2	24	You see then that a man is justified by works , and not by faith only .

NKJV	James	3	3	[ b ] Indeed , ( F ) we put bits in horses ’ mouths that they may obey us , and we turn their whole body .
NKJV	James	3	2	For ( C ) we all stumble in many things . ( D ) If anyone does not stumble in word , ( E ) he is a [ a ] perfect man , able also to bridle the whole body .
NKJV	James	3	4	Look also at ships : although they are so large and are driven by fierce winds , they are turned by a very small rudder wherever the pilot desires .
NKJV	James	3	5	Even so ( G ) the tongue is a little member and ( H ) boasts great things . See how great a forest a little fire kindles !
NKJV	James	3	6	And ( I ) the tongue is a fire , a world of [ c ] iniquity . The tongue is so set among our members that it ( J ) defiles the whole body , and sets on fire the course of [ d ] nature ; and it is set on fire by [ e ] hell .
NKJV	James	3	7	For every kind of beast and bird , of reptile and creature of the sea , is tamed and has been tamed by mankind .
NKJV	James	3	8	But no man can tame the tongue . It is an unruly evil , ( K ) full of deadly poison .
NKJV	James	3	9	With it we bless our God and Father , and with it we curse men , who have been made ( L ) in the [ f ] similitude of God .
NKJV	James	3	10	Out of the same mouth proceed blessing and cursing . My brethren , these things ought not to be so .
NKJV	James	3	11	Does a spring send forth fresh water and bitter from the same opening ?
NKJV	James	3	12	Can a ( M ) fig tree , my brethren , bear olives , or a grapevine bear figs ? [ g ] Thus no spring yields both salt water and fresh . Heavenly Versus Demonic Wisdom
NKJV	James	3	13	( N ) Who is wise and understanding among you ? Let him show by good conduct that his works are done in the meekness of wisdom .
NKJV	James	3	14	But if you have ( O ) bitter envy and [ h ] self-seeking in your hearts , ( P ) do not boast and lie against the truth .
NKJV	James	3	15	( Q ) This wisdom does not descend from above , but is earthly , sensual , demonic .
NKJV	James	3	16	For ( R ) where envy and self-seeking exist , confusion and every evil thing are there .
NKJV	James	3	17	But ( S ) the wisdom that is from above is first pure , then peaceable , gentle , willing to yield , full of mercy and good fruits , ( T ) without partiality ( U ) and without hypocrisy .

NKJV	James	4	4	[ d ] Adulterers and adulteresses ! Do you not know that ( D ) friendship with the world is enmity with God ? ( E ) Whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God .
NKJV	James	4	2	You lust and do not have . You murder and covet and can not obtain . You fight and [ b ] war . [ c ] Yet you do not have because you do not ask .
NKJV	James	4	3	( B ) You ask and do not receive , ( C ) because you ask amiss , that you may spend it on your pleasures .
NKJV	James	4	5	Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain , ( F ) “ The Spirit who dwells in us yearns jealously ” ?
NKJV	James	4	6	But He gives more grace . Therefore He says : ( G ) “ God resists the proud , But gives grace to the humble. ” Humility Cures Worldliness
NKJV	James	4	7	Therefore submit to God . ( H ) Resist the devil and he will flee from you .
NKJV	James	4	8	( I ) Draw near to God and He will draw near to you . ( J ) Cleanse your hands , you sinners ; and ( K ) purify your hearts , you double-minded .
NKJV	James	4	9	( L ) Lament and mourn and weep ! Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom .
NKJV	James	4	10	( M ) Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord , and He will lift you up . Do Not Judge a Brother
NKJV	James	4	11	( N ) Do not speak evil of one another , brethren . He who speaks evil of a brother ( O ) and judges his brother , speaks evil of the law and judges the law . But if you judge the law , you are not a doer of the law but a judge .
NKJV	James	4	12	There is one [ e ] Lawgiver , ( P ) who is able to save and to destroy . ( Q ) Who [ f ] are you to judge [ g ] another ? Do Not Boast About Tomorrow
NKJV	James	4	13	Come now , you who say , “ Today or tomorrow [ h ] we will go to such and such a city , spend a year there , buy and sell , and make a profit ” ;
NKJV	James	4	14	whereas you do not know what will happen tomorrow . For what is your life ? ( R ) It is even a vapor that appears for a little time and then vanishes away .
NKJV	James	4	15	Instead you ought to say , ( S ) “ If the Lord wills , we shall live and do this or that. ”
NKJV	James	4	16	But now you boast in your arrogance . ( T ) All such boasting is evil .
NKJV	James	4	17	Therefore , ( U ) to him who knows to do good and does not do it , to him it is sin .

NKJV	James	5	5	You have lived on the earth in pleasure and [ c ] luxury ; you have [ d ] fattened your hearts [ e ] as in a day of slaughter .
NKJV	James	5	2	Your ( B ) riches [ a ] are corrupted , and ( C ) your garments are moth-eaten .
NKJV	James	5	3	Your gold and silver are corroded , and their corrosion will be a witness against you and will eat your flesh like fire . ( D ) You have heaped up treasure in the last days .
NKJV	James	5	4	Indeed ( E ) the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields , which you kept back by fraud , cry out ; and ( F ) the cries of the reapers have reached the ears of the Lord of [ b ] Sabaoth .
NKJV	James	5	6	You have condemned , you have murdered the just ; he does not resist you . Be Patient and Persevering
NKJV	James	5	7	Therefore be patient , brethren , until the coming of the Lord . See how the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth , waiting patiently for it until it receives the early and latter rain .
NKJV	James	5	8	You also be patient . Establish your hearts , for the coming of the Lord [ f ] is at hand .
NKJV	James	5	9	Do not [ g ] grumble against one another , brethren , lest you be [ h ] condemned . Behold , the Judge is standing at the door !
NKJV	James	5	10	( G ) My brethren , take the prophets , who spoke in the name of the Lord , as an example of suffering and ( H ) patience .
NKJV	James	5	11	Indeed ( I ) we count them blessed who ( J ) endure . You have heard of ( K ) the perseverance of Job and seen ( L ) the end intended by the Lord—that ( M ) the Lord is very compassionate and merciful .
NKJV	James	5	12	But above all , my brethren , ( N ) do not swear , either by heaven or by earth or with any other oath . But let your “ Yes ” be “ Yes , ” and your “ No , ” “ No , ” lest you fall into [ i ] judgment . Meeting Specific Needs ( O )
NKJV	James	5	13	Is anyone among you suffering ? Let him ( P ) pray . Is anyone cheerful ? ( Q ) Let him sing psalms .
NKJV	James	5	14	Is anyone among you sick ? Let him call for the elders of the church , and let them pray over him , ( R ) anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord .
NKJV	James	5	15	And the prayer of faith will save the sick , and the Lord will raise him up . ( S ) And if he has committed sins , he will be forgiven .
NKJV	James	5	16	[ j ] Confess your trespasses to one another , and pray for one another , that you may be healed . ( T ) The effective , [ k ] fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much .
NKJV	James	5	17	Elijah was a man ( U ) with a nature like ours , and ( V ) he prayed earnestly that it would not rain ; and it did not rain on the land for three years and six months .
NKJV	James	5	18	And he prayed ( W ) again , and the heaven gave rain , and the earth produced its fruit . Bring Back the Erring One
NKJV	James	5	19	Brethren , if anyone among you wanders from the truth , and someone ( X ) turns him back ,

NKJV	1%20Peter	1	2	( B ) elect ( C ) according to the foreknowledge of God the Father , ( D ) in sanctification of the Spirit , for ( E ) obedience and ( F ) sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ : ( G ) Grace to you and peace be multiplied . A Heavenly Inheritance
NKJV	1%20Peter	1	3	( H ) Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , who ( I ) according to His abundant mercy ( J ) has begotten us again to a living hope ( K ) through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead ,
NKJV	1%20Peter	1	4	to an inheritance [ b ] incorruptible and undefiled and that does not fade away , ( L ) reserved in heaven for you ,
NKJV	1%20Peter	1	5	( M ) who are kept by the power of God through faith for salvation ready to be revealed in the last time .
NKJV	1%20Peter	1	6	( N ) In this you greatly rejoice , though now ( O ) for a little while , if need be , ( P ) you have been [ c ] grieved by various trials ,
NKJV	1%20Peter	1	7	that ( Q ) the genuineness of your faith , being much more precious than gold that perishes , though ( R ) it is tested by fire , ( S ) may be found to praise , honor , and glory at the revelation of Jesus Christ ,
NKJV	1%20Peter	1	8	( T ) whom having not [ d ] seen you love . ( U ) Though now you do not see Him , yet believing , you rejoice with joy inexpressible and full of glory ,
NKJV	1%20Peter	1	9	receiving the end of your faith—the salvation of your souls .
NKJV	1%20Peter	1	10	Of this salvation the prophets have inquired and searched carefully , who prophesied of the grace that would come to you ,
NKJV	1%20Peter	1	11	searching what , or what manner of time , ( V ) the Spirit of Christ who was in them was indicating when He testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glories that would follow .
NKJV	1%20Peter	1	12	To them it was revealed that , not to themselves , but to [ e ] us they were ministering the things which now have been reported to you through those who have preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven—things which ( W ) angels desire to look into . Living Before God Our Father
NKJV	1%20Peter	1	13	Therefore gird up the loins of your mind , be sober , and rest your hope fully upon the grace that is to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ ;
NKJV	1%20Peter	1	14	as obedient children , not ( X ) conforming yourselves to the former lusts , as in your ignorance ;
NKJV	1%20Peter	1	15	( Y ) but as He who called you is holy , you also be holy in all your conduct ,
NKJV	1%20Peter	1	16	because it is written , ( Z ) “ Be holy , for I am holy. ”
NKJV	1%20Peter	1	17	And if you call on the Father , who ( AA ) without partiality judges according to each one ’ s work , conduct yourselves throughout the time of your [ f ] stay here in fear ;
NKJV	1%20Peter	1	18	knowing that you were not redeemed with [ g ] corruptible things , like silver or gold , from your aimless conduct received by tradition from your fathers ,
NKJV	1%20Peter	1	19	but ( AB ) with the precious blood of Christ , ( AC ) as of a lamb without blemish and without spot .
NKJV	1%20Peter	1	20	( AD ) He indeed was foreordained before the foundation of the world , but was [ h ] manifest ( AE ) in these last times for you
NKJV	1%20Peter	1	21	who through Him believe in God , ( AF ) who raised Him from the dead and ( AG ) gave Him glory , so that your faith and hope are in God . The Enduring Word
NKJV	1%20Peter	1	22	Since you ( AH ) have purified your souls in obeying the truth [ i ] through the Spirit in [ j ] sincere ( AI ) love of the brethren , love one another fervently with a pure heart ,
NKJV	1%20Peter	1	23	( AJ ) having been born again , not of [ k ] corruptible seed but [ l ] incorruptible , ( AK ) through the word of God which lives and abides [ m ] forever ,
NKJV	1%20Peter	1	24	because ( AL ) “ All flesh is as grass , And all [ n ] the glory of man as the flower of the grass . The grass withers , And its flower falls away ,

NKJV	1%20Peter	2	4	Coming to Him as to a living stone , ( F ) rejected indeed by men , but chosen by God and precious ,
NKJV	1%20Peter	2	5	you also , as living stones , are being built up a spiritual house , a holy priesthood , to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ .
NKJV	1%20Peter	2	6	Therefore it is also contained in the Scripture , ( G ) “ Behold , I lay in Zion A chief cornerstone , elect , precious , And he who believes on Him will by no means be put to shame. ”
NKJV	1%20Peter	2	7	Therefore , to you who believe , He is precious ; but to those who [ b ] are disobedient , ( H ) “ The stone which the builders rejected Has become the chief cornerstone , ”
NKJV	1%20Peter	2	8	and ( I ) “ A stone of stumbling And a rock of offense. ” ( J ) They stumble , being disobedient to the word , ( K ) to which they also were appointed .
NKJV	1%20Peter	2	9	But you are a chosen generation , a royal priesthood , a holy nation , His own special people , that you may proclaim the praises of Him who called you out of ( L ) darkness into His marvelous light ;
NKJV	1%20Peter	2	10	( M ) who once were not a people but are now the people of God , who had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy . Living Before the World
NKJV	1%20Peter	2	11	Beloved , I beg you as sojourners and pilgrims , abstain from fleshly lusts ( N ) which war against the soul ,
NKJV	1%20Peter	2	12	( O ) having your conduct honorable among the Gentiles , that when they speak against you as evildoers , ( P ) they may , by your good works which they observe , glorify God in the day of visitation . Submission to Government ( Q )
NKJV	1%20Peter	2	13	( R ) Therefore submit yourselves to every [ c ] ordinance of man for the Lord ’ s sake , whether to the king as supreme ,
NKJV	1%20Peter	2	14	or to governors , as to those who are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and for the praise of those who do good .
NKJV	1%20Peter	2	15	For this is the will of God , that by doing good you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men—
NKJV	1%20Peter	2	16	( S ) as free , yet not ( T ) using liberty as a cloak for [ d ] vice , but as bondservants of God .
NKJV	1%20Peter	2	17	Honor all people . Love the brotherhood . Fear ( U ) God . Honor the king . Submission to Masters ( V )
NKJV	1%20Peter	2	18	( W ) Servants , be submissive to your masters with all fear , not only to the good and gentle , but also to the harsh .
NKJV	1%20Peter	2	19	For this is ( X ) commendable , if because of conscience toward God one endures grief , suffering wrongfully .
NKJV	1%20Peter	2	20	For ( Y ) what credit is it if , when you are beaten for your faults , you take it patiently ? But when you do good and suffer , if you take it patiently , this is commendable before God .
NKJV	1%20Peter	2	21	For ( Z ) to this you were called , because Christ also suffered for [ e ] us , ( AA ) leaving [ f ] us an example , that you should follow His steps :
NKJV	1%20Peter	2	22	“ Who ( AB ) committed no sin , Nor was deceit found in His mouth ” ;
NKJV	1%20Peter	2	23	( AC ) who , when He was reviled , did not revile in return ; when He suffered , He did not threaten , but ( AD ) committed Himself to Him who judges righteously ;
NKJV	1%20Peter	2	24	( AE ) who Himself bore our sins in His own body on the tree , ( AF ) that we , having died to sins , might live for righteousness— ( AG ) by whose [ g ] stripes you were healed .

NKJV	1%20Peter	3	3	( E ) Do not let your adornment be merely outward—arranging the hair , wearing gold , or putting on fine apparel—
NKJV	1%20Peter	3	2	( D ) when they observe your chaste conduct accompanied by fear .
NKJV	1%20Peter	3	4	rather let it be ( F ) the hidden person of the heart , with the [ a ] incorruptible beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit , which is very precious in the sight of God .
NKJV	1%20Peter	3	5	For in this manner , in former times , the holy women who trusted in God also adorned themselves , being submissive to their own husbands ,
NKJV	1%20Peter	3	6	as Sarah obeyed Abraham , ( G ) calling him lord , whose daughters you are if you do good and are not afraid with any terror . A Word to Husbands
NKJV	1%20Peter	3	7	( H ) Husbands , likewise , dwell with them with understanding , giving honor to the wife , ( I ) as to the weaker vessel , and as being heirs together of the grace of life , ( J ) that your prayers may not be hindered . Called to Blessing
NKJV	1%20Peter	3	8	Finally , all of you be of one mind , having compassion for one another ; love as brothers , be tenderhearted , be [ b ] courteous ;
NKJV	1%20Peter	3	9	( K ) not returning evil for evil or reviling for reviling , but on the contrary ( L ) blessing , knowing that you were called to this , ( M ) that you may inherit a blessing .
NKJV	1%20Peter	3	10	For ( N ) “ He who would love life And see good days , ( O ) Let him [ c ] refrain his tongue from evil , And his lips from speaking deceit .
NKJV	1%20Peter	3	11	Let him ( P ) turn away from evil and do good ; ( Q ) Let him seek peace and pursue it .
NKJV	1%20Peter	3	12	For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous , ( R ) And His ears are open to their prayers ; But the face of the Lord is against those who do evil. ” Suffering for Right and Wrong
NKJV	1%20Peter	3	13	( S ) And who is he who will harm you if you become followers of what is good ?
NKJV	1%20Peter	3	14	( T ) But even if you should suffer for righteousness ’ sake , you are blessed . ( U ) “ And do not be afraid of their threats , nor be troubled. ”
NKJV	1%20Peter	3	15	But [ d ] sanctify [ e ] the Lord God in your hearts , and always ( V ) be ready to give a defense to everyone who asks you a reason for the ( W ) hope that is in you , with meekness and fear ;
NKJV	1%20Peter	3	16	( X ) having a good conscience , that when they defame you as evildoers , those who revile your good conduct in Christ may be ashamed .
NKJV	1%20Peter	3	17	For it is better , if it is the will of God , to suffer for doing good than for doing evil . Christ ’ s Suffering and Ours
NKJV	1%20Peter	3	18	For Christ also suffered once for sins , the just for the unjust , that He might bring [ f ] us to God , being put to death in the flesh but made alive by the Spirit ,
NKJV	1%20Peter	3	19	by whom also He went and preached to the spirits in prison ,
NKJV	1%20Peter	3	20	who formerly were disobedient , [ g ] when once the Divine longsuffering waited in the days of Noah , while the ark was being prepared , in which a few , that is , eight souls , were saved through water .
NKJV	1%20Peter	3	21	( Y ) There is also an antitype which now saves us—baptism ( Z ) ( not the removal of the filth of the flesh , ( AA ) but the answer of a good conscience toward God ) , through the resurrection of Jesus Christ ,

NKJV	1%20Peter	4	2	that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh for the lusts of men , ( A ) but for the will of God .
NKJV	1%20Peter	4	3	For we have spent enough of our past [ b ] lifetime in doing the will of the Gentiles—when we walked in lewdness , lusts , drunkenness , revelries , drinking parties , and abominable idolatries .

NKJV	2%20Peter	1	3	as His ( D ) divine power has given to us all things that pertain to life and godliness , through the knowledge of Him ( E ) who called us by glory and virtue ,
NKJV	2%20Peter	1	4	( F ) by which have been given to us exceedingly great and precious promises , that through these you may be ( G ) partakers of the divine nature , having escaped the [ c ] corruption that is in the world through lust . Fruitful Growth in the Faith
NKJV	2%20Peter	1	5	But also for this very reason , ( H ) giving all diligence , add to your faith virtue , to virtue ( I ) knowledge ,
NKJV	2%20Peter	1	6	to knowledge self-control , to self-control [ d ] perseverance , to perseverance godliness ,
NKJV	2%20Peter	1	7	to godliness brotherly kindness , and ( J ) to brotherly kindness love .
NKJV	2%20Peter	1	8	For if these things are yours and abound , you will be neither [ e ] barren ( K ) nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ .
NKJV	2%20Peter	1	9	For he who lacks these things is ( L ) shortsighted , even to blindness , and has forgotten that he was cleansed from his old sins .
NKJV	2%20Peter	1	10	Therefore , brethren , be even more diligent ( M ) to make your call and election sure , for if you do these things you will never stumble ;
NKJV	2%20Peter	1	11	for so an entrance will be supplied to you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ . Peter ’ s Approaching Death
NKJV	2%20Peter	1	12	For this reason ( N ) I will not be negligent to remind you always of these things , ( O ) though you know and are established in the present truth .
NKJV	2%20Peter	1	13	Yes , I think it is right , ( P ) as long as I am in this [ f ] tent , ( Q ) to stir you up by reminding you ,
NKJV	2%20Peter	1	14	( R ) knowing that shortly I must [ g ] put off my tent , just as ( S ) our Lord Jesus Christ showed me .
NKJV	2%20Peter	1	15	Moreover I will be careful to ensure that you always have a reminder of these things after my [ h ] decease . The Trustworthy Prophetic Word ( T )
NKJV	2%20Peter	1	16	For we did not follow ( U ) cunningly devised fables when we made known to you the ( V ) power and ( W ) coming of our Lord Jesus Christ , but were ( X ) eyewitnesses of His majesty .
NKJV	2%20Peter	1	17	For He received from God the Father honor and glory when such a voice came to Him from the Excellent Glory : ( Y ) “ This is My beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased. ”
NKJV	2%20Peter	1	18	And we heard this voice which came from heaven when we were with Him on ( Z ) the holy mountain .
NKJV	2%20Peter	1	19	[ i ] And so we have the prophetic word confirmed , which you do well to heed as a ( AA ) light that shines in a dark place , ( AB ) until ( AC ) the day dawns and the morning star rises in your ( AD ) hearts ;
NKJV	2%20Peter	1	20	knowing this first , that ( AE ) no prophecy of Scripture is of any private [ j ] interpretation ,
NKJV	2%20Peter	1	21	for ( AF ) prophecy never came by the will of man , ( AG ) but [ k ] holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Spirit . Footnotes -

NKJV	2%20Peter	2	3	By covetousness they will exploit you with deceptive words ; for a long time their judgment has not been idle , and their destruction [ a ] does not slumber . Doom of False Teachers
NKJV	2%20Peter	2	4	For if God did not spare the angels who sinned , but cast them down to [ b ] hell and delivered them into chains of darkness , to be reserved for judgment ;
NKJV	2%20Peter	2	5	and did not spare the ancient world , but saved Noah , one of eight people , a preacher of righteousness , bringing in the flood on the world of the ungodly ;
NKJV	2%20Peter	2	6	and turning the cities of ( B ) Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes , condemned them to destruction , making them an example to those who afterward would live ungodly ;
NKJV	2%20Peter	2	7	and ( C ) delivered righteous Lot , who was oppressed by the filthy conduct of the wicked
NKJV	2%20Peter	2	8	( for that righteous man , dwelling among them , ( D ) tormented his righteous soul from day to day by seeing and hearing their lawless deeds ) —
NKJV	2%20Peter	2	9	then ( E ) the Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptations and to reserve the unjust under punishment for the day of judgment ,
NKJV	2%20Peter	2	10	and especially ( F ) those who walk according to the flesh in the lust of uncleanness and despise authority . ( G ) They are presumptuous , self-willed . They are not afraid to speak evil of [ c ] dignitaries ,
NKJV	2%20Peter	2	11	whereas ( H ) angels , who are greater in power and might , do not bring a reviling accusation against them before the Lord . Depravity of False Teachers
NKJV	2%20Peter	2	12	But these , ( I ) like natural brute beasts made to be caught and destroyed , speak evil of the things they do not understand , and will utterly perish in their own corruption ,
NKJV	2%20Peter	2	13	( J ) and will receive the wages of unrighteousness , as those who count it pleasure ( K ) to [ d ] carouse in the daytime . ( L ) They are spots and blemishes , [ e ] carousing in their own deceptions while ( M ) they feast with you ,
NKJV	2%20Peter	2	14	having eyes full of [ f ] adultery and that can not cease from sin , enticing unstable souls . ( N ) They have a heart trained in covetous practices , and are accursed children .
NKJV	2%20Peter	2	15	They have forsaken the right way and gone astray , following the way of ( O ) Balaam the son of Beor , who loved the wages of unrighteousness ;
NKJV	2%20Peter	2	16	but he was rebuked for his iniquity : a dumb donkey speaking with a man ’ s voice restrained the madness of the prophet .
NKJV	2%20Peter	2	17	( P ) These are wells without water , [ g ] clouds carried by a tempest , for whom is reserved the blackness of darkness [ h ] forever . Deceptions of False Teachers
NKJV	2%20Peter	2	18	For when they speak great swelling words of emptiness , they allure through the lusts of the flesh , through lewdness , the ones who [ i ] have actually escaped from those who live in error .
NKJV	2%20Peter	2	19	While they promise them liberty , they themselves are slaves of [ j ] corruption ; ( Q ) for by whom a person is overcome , by him also he is brought into [ k ] bondage .
NKJV	2%20Peter	2	20	For if , after they ( R ) have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ , they are ( S ) again entangled in them and overcome , the latter end is worse for them than the beginning .
NKJV	2%20Peter	2	21	For ( T ) it would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness , than having known it , to turn from the holy commandment delivered to them .
NKJV	2%20Peter	2	22	But it has happened to them according to the true proverb : ( U ) “ A dog returns to his own vomit , ” and , “ a sow , having washed , to her wallowing in the mire. ” Footnotes -

NKJV	2%20Peter	3	3	knowing this first : that scoffers will come in the last days , ( E ) walking according to their own lusts ,
NKJV	2%20Peter	3	4	and saying , “ Where is the promise of His coming ? For since the fathers fell asleep , all things continue as they were from the beginning of ( F ) creation. ”
NKJV	2%20Peter	3	5	For this they willfully forget : that ( G ) by the word of God the heavens were of old , and the earth ( H ) standing out of water and in the water ,
NKJV	2%20Peter	3	6	( I ) by which the world that then existed perished , being flooded with water .
NKJV	2%20Peter	3	7	But ( J ) the heavens and the earth which are now preserved by the same word , are reserved for ( K ) fire until the day of judgment and [ b ] perdition of ungodly men .
NKJV	2%20Peter	3	8	But , beloved , do not forget this one thing , that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years , and ( L ) a thousand years as one day .
NKJV	2%20Peter	3	9	( M ) The Lord is not slack concerning His promise , as some count slackness , but ( N ) is longsuffering toward [ c ] us , ( O ) not willing that any should perish but ( P ) that all should come to repentance . The Day of the Lord
NKJV	2%20Peter	3	10	But ( Q ) the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night , in which ( R ) the heavens will pass away with a great noise , and the elements will melt with fervent heat ; both the earth and the works that are in it will be [ d ] burned up .
NKJV	2%20Peter	3	11	Therefore , since all these things will be dissolved , what manner of persons ought you to be ( S ) in holy conduct and godliness ,
NKJV	2%20Peter	3	12	( T ) looking for and hastening the coming of the day of God , because of which the heavens will ( U ) be dissolved , being on fire , and the elements will ( V ) melt with fervent heat ?
NKJV	2%20Peter	3	13	Nevertheless we , according to His promise , look for ( W ) new heavens and a ( X ) new earth in which righteousness dwells . Be Steadfast
NKJV	2%20Peter	3	14	Therefore , beloved , looking forward to these things , be diligent ( Y ) to be found by Him in peace , without spot and blameless ;
NKJV	2%20Peter	3	15	and consider that ( Z ) the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation—as also our beloved brother Paul , according to the wisdom given to him , has written to you ,
NKJV	2%20Peter	3	16	as also in all his ( AA ) epistles , speaking in them of these things , in which are some things hard to understand , which untaught and unstable people twist to their own destruction , as they do also the ( AB ) rest of the Scriptures .
NKJV	2%20Peter	3	17	You therefore , beloved , ( AC ) since you know this beforehand , ( AD ) beware lest you also fall from your own steadfastness , being led away with the error of the wicked ;
NKJV	2%20Peter	3	18	( AE ) but grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ . ( AF ) To Him be the glory both now and forever . Amen . Footnotes -

NKJV	1%20John	1	4	And these things we write to you ( L ) that [ a ] your joy may be full . Fellowship with Him and One Another
NKJV	1%20John	1	5	( M ) This is the message which we have heard from Him and declare to you , that ( N ) God is light and in Him is no darkness at all .
NKJV	1%20John	1	6	( O ) If we say that we have fellowship with Him , and walk in darkness , we lie and do not practice the truth .
NKJV	1%20John	1	7	But if we ( P ) walk in the light as He is in the light , we have fellowship with one another , and ( Q ) the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin .

NKJV	1%20John	2	2	And ( B ) He Himself is the propitiation for our sins , and not for ours only but ( C ) also for the whole world . The Test of Knowing Him
NKJV	1%20John	2	3	Now by this we know that we know Him , if we keep His commandments .
NKJV	1%20John	2	4	He who says , “ I know Him , ” and does not keep His commandments , is a ( D ) liar , and the truth is not in him .
NKJV	1%20John	2	5	But ( E ) whoever keeps His word , truly the love of God [ a ] is perfected ( F ) in him . By this we know that we are in Him .
NKJV	1%20John	2	6	( G ) He who says he abides in Him ( H ) ought himself also to walk just as He walked .
NKJV	1%20John	2	7	[ b ] Brethren , I write no new commandment to you , but an old commandment which you have had ( I ) from the beginning . The old commandment is the word which you heard [ c ] from the beginning .
NKJV	1%20John	2	8	Again , ( J ) a new commandment I write to you , which thing is true in Him and in you , ( K ) because the darkness is passing away , and ( L ) the true light is already shining .
NKJV	1%20John	2	9	( M ) He who says he is in the light , and hates his brother , is in darkness until now .
NKJV	1%20John	2	10	( N ) He who loves his brother abides in the light , and ( O ) there is no cause for stumbling in him .
NKJV	1%20John	2	11	But he who ( P ) hates his brother is in darkness and ( Q ) walks in darkness , and does not know where he is going , because the darkness has blinded his eyes . Their Spiritual State
NKJV	1%20John	2	12	I write to you , little children , Because ( R ) your sins are forgiven you for His name ’ s sake .
NKJV	1%20John	2	13	I write to you , fathers , Because you have known Him who is ( S ) from the beginning . I write to you , young men , Because you have overcome the wicked one . I write to you , little children , Because you have ( T ) known the Father .
NKJV	1%20John	2	14	I have written to you , fathers , Because you have known Him who is from the beginning . I have written to you , young men , Because ( U ) you are strong , and the word of God abides in you , And you have overcome the wicked one . Do Not Love the World
NKJV	1%20John	2	15	( V ) Do not love the world or the things in the world . ( W ) If anyone loves the world , the love of the Father is not in him .
NKJV	1%20John	2	16	For all that is in the world—the lust of the flesh , ( X ) the lust of the eyes , and the pride of life—is not of the Father but is of the world .
NKJV	1%20John	2	17	And ( Y ) the world is passing away , and the lust of it ; but he who does the will of God abides forever . Deceptions of the Last Hour
NKJV	1%20John	2	18	( Z ) Little children , ( AA ) it is the last hour ; and as you have heard that ( AB ) the [ d ] Antichrist is coming , ( AC ) even now many antichrists have come , by which we know ( AD ) that it is the last hour .
NKJV	1%20John	2	19	( AE ) They went out from us , but they were not of us ; for ( AF ) if they had been of us , they would have continued with us ; but they went out ( AG ) that they might be made manifest , that none of them were of us .
NKJV	1%20John	2	20	But ( AH ) you have an anointing ( AI ) from the Holy One , and ( AJ ) you [ e ] know all things .
NKJV	1%20John	2	21	I have not written to you because you do not know the truth , but because you know it , and that no lie is of the truth .
NKJV	1%20John	2	22	( AK ) Who is a liar but he who denies that ( AL ) Jesus is the Christ ? He is antichrist who denies the Father and the Son .
NKJV	1%20John	2	23	( AM ) Whoever denies the Son does not have the ( AN ) Father either ; ( AO ) he who acknowledges the Son has the Father also . Let Truth Abide in You
NKJV	1%20John	2	24	Therefore let that abide in you ( AP ) which you heard from the beginning . If what you heard from the beginning abides in you , ( AQ ) you also will abide in the Son and in the Father .
NKJV	1%20John	2	25	( AR ) And this is the promise that He has promised us—eternal life .
NKJV	1%20John	2	26	These things I have written to you concerning those who try to [ f ] deceive you .
NKJV	1%20John	2	27	But the ( AS ) anointing which you have received from Him abides in you , and ( AT ) you do not need that anyone teach you ; but as the same anointing ( AU ) teaches you concerning all things , and is true , and is not a lie , and just as it has taught you , you [ g ] will abide in Him .

NKJV	1%20John	3	2	Beloved , ( D ) now we are children of God ; and ( E ) it has not yet been revealed what we shall be , but we know that when He is revealed , ( F ) we shall be like Him , for ( G ) we shall see Him as He is .
NKJV	1%20John	3	4	Whoever commits sin also commits lawlessness , and ( I ) sin is lawlessness .
NKJV	1%20John	3	5	And you know ( J ) that He was manifested ( K ) to take away our sins , and ( L ) in Him there is no sin .
NKJV	1%20John	3	6	Whoever abides in Him does not sin . Whoever sins has neither seen Him nor known Him .
NKJV	1%20John	3	7	Little children , let no one deceive you . He who practices righteousness is righteous , just as He is righteous .
NKJV	1%20John	3	8	( M ) He who sins is of the devil , for the devil has sinned from the beginning . For this purpose the Son of God was manifested , ( N ) that He might destroy the works of the devil .
NKJV	1%20John	3	9	Whoever has been ( O ) born of God does not sin , for ( P ) His seed remains in him ; and he can not sin , because he has been born of God . The Imperative of Love ( Q )
NKJV	1%20John	3	10	In this the children of God and the children of the devil are manifest : Whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God , nor is he who does not love his brother .
NKJV	1%20John	3	11	For this is the message that you heard from the beginning , ( R ) that we should love one another ,
NKJV	1%20John	3	12	not as ( S ) Cain who was of the wicked one and murdered his brother . And why did he murder him ? Because his works were evil and his brother ’ s righteous .
NKJV	1%20John	3	13	Do not marvel , my brethren , if ( T ) the world hates you .
NKJV	1%20John	3	14	We know that we have passed from death to life , because we love the brethren . He who does not love [ c ] his brother abides in death .
NKJV	1%20John	3	15	( U ) Whoever hates his brother is a murderer , and you know that ( V ) no murderer has eternal life abiding in him . The Outworking of Love
NKJV	1%20John	3	16	( W ) By this we know love , ( X ) because He laid down His life for us . And we also ought to lay down our lives for the brethren .
NKJV	1%20John	3	17	But ( Y ) whoever has this world ’ s goods , and sees his brother in need , and shuts up his heart from him , how does the love of God abide in him ?
NKJV	1%20John	3	18	My little children , ( Z ) let us not love in word or in tongue , but in deed and in truth .
NKJV	1%20John	3	19	And by this we [ d ] know ( AA ) that we are of the truth , and shall [ e ] assure our hearts before Him .
NKJV	1%20John	3	20	( AB ) For if our heart condemns us , God is greater than our heart , and knows all things .
NKJV	1%20John	3	21	Beloved , if our heart does not condemn us , ( AC ) we have confidence toward God .
NKJV	1%20John	3	22	And ( AD ) whatever we ask we receive from Him , because we keep His commandments ( AE ) and do those things that are pleasing in His sight .
NKJV	1%20John	3	23	And this is His commandment : that we should believe on the name of His Son Jesus Christ ( AF ) and love one another , as He gave [ f ] us commandment . The Spirit of Truth and the Spirit of Error
NKJV	1%20John	3	24	Now ( AG ) he who keeps His commandments ( AH ) abides in Him , and He in him . And ( AI ) by this we know that He abides in us , by the Spirit whom He has given us . Footnotes -

NKJV	1%20John	4	8	He who does not love does not know God , for God is love .
NKJV	1%20John	4	9	( K ) In this the love of God was manifested toward us , that God has sent His only begotten ( L ) Son into the world , that we might live through Him .
NKJV	1%20John	4	10	In this is love , ( M ) not that we loved God , but that He loved us and sent His Son ( N ) to be the propitiation for our sins .
NKJV	1%20John	4	11	Beloved , ( O ) if God so loved us , we also ought to love one another . Seeing God Through Love
NKJV	1%20John	4	12	( P ) No one has seen God at any time . If we love one another , God abides in us , and His love has been perfected in us .
NKJV	1%20John	4	13	( Q ) By this we know that we abide in Him , and He in us , because He has given us of His Spirit .

NKJV	1%20John	4	16	And we have known and believed the love that God has for us . God is love , and ( U ) he who abides in love abides in God , and God ( V ) in him . The Consummation of Love
NKJV	1%20John	4	17	Love has been perfected among us in this : that ( W ) we may have boldness in the day of judgment ; because as He is , so are we in this world .
NKJV	1%20John	4	18	There is no fear in love ; but perfect love casts out fear , because fear involves torment . But he who fears has not been made perfect in love .
NKJV	1%20John	4	19	( X ) We love [ c ] Him because He first loved us . Obedience by Faith
NKJV	1%20John	4	20	( Y ) If someone says , “ I love God , ” and hates his brother , he is a liar ; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen , [ d ] how can he love God ( Z ) whom he has not seen ?

NKJV	2%20John	1	3	( B ) Grace , mercy , and peace will be with [ b ] you from God the Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ , the Son of the Father , in truth and love . Walk in Christ ’ s Commandments
NKJV	2%20John	1	4	I ( C ) rejoiced greatly that I have found some of your children walking in truth , as we received commandment from the Father .
NKJV	2%20John	1	5	And now I plead with you , lady , not as though I wrote a new commandment to you , but that which we have had from the beginning : ( D ) that we love one another .
NKJV	2%20John	1	6	( E ) This is love , that we walk according to His commandments . This is the commandment , that ( F ) as you have heard from the beginning , you should walk in it . Beware of Antichrist Deceivers
NKJV	2%20John	1	7	For ( G ) many deceivers have gone out into the world ( H ) who do not confess Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh . ( I ) This is a deceiver and an antichrist .
NKJV	2%20John	1	8	( J ) Look to yourselves , ( K ) that [ c ] we do not lose those things we worked for , but that we may receive a full reward .
NKJV	2%20John	1	9	( L ) Whoever [ d ] transgresses and does not abide in the doctrine of Christ does not have God . He who abides in the doctrine of Christ has both the Father and the Son .
NKJV	2%20John	1	10	If anyone comes to you and ( M ) does not bring this doctrine , do not receive him into your house nor greet him ;
NKJV	2%20John	1	11	for he who greets him shares in his evil deeds . John ’ s Farewell Greeting

NKJV	3%20John	1	1	The Elder , To the beloved Gaius , ( A ) whom I love in truth :
NKJV	3%20John	1	2	Beloved , I pray that you may prosper in all things and be in health , just as your soul prospers .
NKJV	3%20John	1	4	I have no greater ( C ) joy than to hear that ( D ) my children walk in [ a ] truth . Gaius Commended for Generosity
NKJV	3%20John	1	5	Beloved , you do faithfully whatever you do for the brethren [ b ] and for strangers ,
NKJV	3%20John	1	6	who have borne witness of your love before the church . If you send them forward on their journey in a manner worthy of God , you will do well ,
NKJV	3%20John	1	7	because they went forth for His name ’ s sake , ( E ) taking nothing from the Gentiles .
NKJV	3%20John	1	8	We therefore ought to ( F ) receive [ c ] such , that we may become fellow workers for the truth . Diotrephes and Demetrius
NKJV	3%20John	1	9	I wrote to the church , but Diotrephes , who loves to have the preeminence among them , does not receive us .
NKJV	3%20John	1	10	Therefore , if I come , I will call to mind his deeds which he does , ( G ) prating [ d ] against us with malicious words . And not content with that , he himself does not receive the brethren , and forbids those who wish to , putting them out of the church .
NKJV	3%20John	1	11	Beloved , ( H ) do not imitate what is evil , but what is good . ( I ) He who does good is of God , [ e ] but he who does evil has not seen ( J ) God .
NKJV	3%20John	1	12	Demetrius ( K ) has a good testimony from all , and from the truth itself . And we also [ f ] bear witness , ( L ) and you know that our testimony is true . Farewell Greeting
NKJV	3%20John	1	13	( M ) I had many things to write , but I do not wish to write to you with pen and ink ;
NKJV	3%20John	1	14	but I hope to see you shortly , and we shall speak face to face . Peace to you . Our friends greet you . Greet the friends by name . Footnotes -

NKJV	Jude	1	1	Jude , a bondservant of Jesus Christ , and ( A ) brother of James , To those who are ( B ) called , [ a ] sanctified by God the Father , and ( C ) preserved in Jesus Christ :
NKJV	Jude	1	2	Mercy , ( D ) peace , and love be multiplied to you . Contend for the Faith
NKJV	Jude	1	3	Beloved , while I was very diligent to write to you ( E ) concerning our common salvation , I found it necessary to write to you exhorting ( F ) you to contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints .
NKJV	Jude	1	4	For certain men have crept in unnoticed , who long ago were marked out for this condemnation , ungodly men , who turn the grace of our God into lewdness and deny the only Lord [ b ] God and our Lord Jesus Christ . Old and New Apostates
NKJV	Jude	1	5	But I want to remind you , though you once knew this , that ( G ) the Lord , having saved the people out of the land of Egypt , afterward destroyed those who did not believe .
NKJV	Jude	1	6	And the angels who did not keep their [ c ] proper domain , but left their own abode , He has reserved in everlasting chains under darkness for the judgment of the great day ;
NKJV	Jude	1	7	as ( H ) Sodom and Gomorrah , and the cities around them in a similar manner to these , having given themselves over to sexual immorality and gone after strange flesh , are set forth as an example , suffering the [ d ] vengeance of eternal fire .
NKJV	Jude	1	8	( I ) Likewise also these dreamers defile the flesh , reject authority , and ( J ) speak evil of [ e ] dignitaries .
NKJV	Jude	1	9	Yet Michael the archangel , in [ f ] contending with the devil , when he disputed about the body of Moses , dared not bring against him a reviling accusation , but said , ( K ) “ The Lord rebuke you ! ”
NKJV	Jude	1	10	( L ) But these speak evil of whatever they do not know ; and whatever they know naturally , like brute beasts , in these things they corrupt themselves .
NKJV	Jude	1	11	Woe to them ! For they have gone in the way ( M ) of Cain , ( N ) have run greedily in the error of Balaam for profit , and perished ( O ) in the rebellion of Korah . Apostates Depraved and Doomed
NKJV	Jude	1	12	These are [ g ] spots in your love feasts , while they feast with you without fear , serving only themselves . They are clouds without water , carried [ h ] about by the winds ; late autumn trees without fruit , twice dead , pulled up by the roots ;
NKJV	Jude	1	13	( P ) raging waves of the sea , ( Q ) foaming up their own shame ; wandering stars ( R ) for whom is reserved the blackness of darkness forever .
NKJV	Jude	1	14	Now Enoch , the seventh from Adam , prophesied about these men also , saying , “ Behold , the Lord comes with ten thousands of His saints ,
NKJV	Jude	1	15	to execute judgment on all , to convict all who are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have committed in an ungodly way , and of all the ( S ) harsh things which ungodly sinners have spoken against Him. ” Apostates Predicted
NKJV	Jude	1	16	These are grumblers , complainers , walking according to their own lusts ; and they ( T ) mouth great swelling words , ( U ) flattering people to gain advantage .
NKJV	Jude	1	17	( V ) But you , beloved , remember the words which were spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ :
NKJV	Jude	1	18	how they told you that ( W ) there would be mockers in the last time who would walk according to their own ungodly lusts .
NKJV	Jude	1	19	These are [ i ] sensual persons , who cause divisions , not having the Spirit . Maintain Your Life with God
NKJV	Jude	1	20	But you , beloved , ( X ) building yourselves up on your most holy faith , ( Y ) praying in the Holy Spirit ,
NKJV	Jude	1	21	keep yourselves in the love of God , ( Z ) looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life .
NKJV	Jude	1	22	And on some have compassion , [ j ] making a distinction ;
NKJV	Jude	1	23	but ( AA ) others save [ k ] with fear , ( AB ) pulling them out of the [ l ] fire , hating even ( AC ) the garment defiled by the flesh . Glory to God
NKJV	Jude	1	24	( AD ) Now to Him who is able to keep [ m ] you from stumbling , And ( AE ) to present you faultless Before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy ,
NKJV	Jude	1	25	To [ n ] God our Savior , [ o ] Who alone is wise , Be glory and majesty , Dominion and [ p ] power , Both now and forever . Amen .

NKJV	Revelation	1	9	I , John , [ f ] both your brother and ( W ) companion in the tribulation and ( X ) kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ , was on the island that is called Patmos for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ .
NKJV	Revelation	1	10	( Y ) I was in the Spirit on ( Z ) the Lord ’ s Day , and I heard behind me ( AA ) a loud voice , as of a trumpet ,
NKJV	Revelation	1	11	saying , [ g ] “ I am the Alpha and the Omega , the First and the Last , ” and , “ What you see , write in a book and send it to the seven churches [ h ] which are in Asia : to Ephesus , to Smyrna , to Pergamos , to Thyatira , to Sardis , to Philadelphia , and to Laodicea. ”
NKJV	Revelation	1	12	Then I turned to see the voice that spoke with me . And having turned ( AB ) I saw seven golden lampstands ,
NKJV	Revelation	1	13	( AC ) and in the midst of the seven lampstands ( AD ) One like the Son of Man , ( AE ) clothed with a garment down to the feet and ( AF ) girded about the chest with a golden band .
NKJV	Revelation	1	14	His head and ( AG ) hair were white like wool , as white as snow , and ( AH ) His eyes like a flame of fire ;
NKJV	Revelation	1	15	( AI ) His feet were like fine brass , as if refined in a furnace , and ( AJ ) His voice as the sound of many waters ;
NKJV	Revelation	1	16	( AK ) He had in His right hand seven stars , ( AL ) out of His mouth went a sharp two-edged sword , ( AM ) and His countenance was like the sun shining in its strength .
NKJV	Revelation	1	17	And ( AN ) when I saw Him , I fell at His feet as dead . But ( AO ) He laid His right hand on me , saying [ i ] to me , “ Do not be afraid ; ( AP ) I am the First and the Last .

NKJV	Revelation	2	14	But I have a few things against you , because you have there those who hold the doctrine of ( U ) Balaam , who taught Balak to put a stumbling block before the children of Israel , ( V ) to eat things sacrificed to idols , ( W ) and to commit sexual immorality .
NKJV	Revelation	2	15	Thus you also have those who hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans , [ g ] which thing I hate .

NKJV	Revelation	2	21	And I gave her time ( AE ) to [ n ] repent of her sexual immorality , and she did not repent .

NKJV	Revelation	5	10	And have made [ d ] us ( S ) kings [ e ] and ( T ) priests to our God ; And [ f ] we shall reign on the earth. ”
NKJV	Revelation	5	11	Then I looked , and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne , the living creatures , and the elders ; and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand , and thousands of thousands ,
NKJV	Revelation	5	12	saying with a loud voice : “ Worthy is the Lamb who was slain To receive power and riches and wisdom , And strength and honor and glory and blessing ! ”
NKJV	Revelation	5	13	And ( U ) every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and such as are in the sea , and all that are in them , I heard saying : ( V ) “ Blessing and honor and glory and power Be to Him ( W ) who sits on the throne , And to the Lamb , forever and [ g ] ever ! ”

NKJV	Revelation	6	10	And they cried with a loud voice , saying , ( V ) “ How long , O Lord , ( W ) holy and true , ( X ) until You judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth ? ”

NKJV	Revelation	7	2	Then I saw another angel ascending from the east , having the seal of the living God . And he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was granted to harm the earth and the sea ,
NKJV	Revelation	7	3	saying , ( C ) “ Do not harm the earth , the sea , or the trees till we have sealed the servants of our God ( D ) on their foreheads. ”

NKJV	Revelation	7	10	and crying out with a loud voice , saying , ( K ) “ Salvation belongs to our God ( L ) who sits on the throne , and to the Lamb ! ”

NKJV	Revelation	8	2	( B ) And I saw the seven angels who stand before God , ( C ) and to them were given seven trumpets .
NKJV	Revelation	8	3	Then another angel , having a golden censer , came and stood at the altar . He was given much incense , that he should offer it with ( D ) the prayers of all the saints upon ( E ) the golden altar which was before the throne .
NKJV	Revelation	8	4	And ( F ) the smoke of the incense , with the prayers of the saints , ascended before God from the angel ’ s hand .

NKJV	Revelation	8	6	So the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound . First Trumpet : Vegetation Struck

NKJV	Revelation	9	9	And they had breastplates like breastplates of iron , and the sound of their wings was ( N ) like the sound of chariots with many horses running into battle .
NKJV	Revelation	9	2	And he opened the bottomless pit , and smoke arose out of the pit like the smoke of a great furnace . So the ( C ) sun and the air were darkened because of the smoke of the pit .
NKJV	Revelation	9	3	Then out of the smoke locusts came upon the earth . And to them was given power , ( D ) as the scorpions of the earth have power .
NKJV	Revelation	9	4	They were commanded ( E ) not to harm ( F ) the grass of the earth , or any green thing , or any tree , but only those men who do not have ( G ) the seal of God on their foreheads .
NKJV	Revelation	9	5	And [ b ] they were not given authority to kill them , ( H ) but to torment them for five months . Their torment was like the torment of a scorpion when it strikes a man .
NKJV	Revelation	9	6	In those days ( I ) men will seek death and will not find it ; they will desire to die , and death will flee from them .
NKJV	Revelation	9	7	( J ) The shape of the locusts was like horses prepared for battle . ( K ) On their heads were crowns of something like gold , ( L ) and their faces were like the faces of men .
NKJV	Revelation	9	8	They had hair like women ’ s hair , and ( M ) their teeth were like lions ’ teeth .
NKJV	Revelation	9	10	They had tails like scorpions , and there were stings in their tails . Their power was to hurt men five months .
NKJV	Revelation	9	11	And they had as king over them ( O ) the angel of the bottomless pit , whose name in Hebrew is [ c ] Abaddon , but in Greek he has the name [ d ] Apollyon .
NKJV	Revelation	9	12	( P ) One woe is past . Behold , still two more woes are coming after these things . Sixth Trumpet : The Angels from the Euphrates
NKJV	Revelation	9	13	Then the sixth angel sounded : And I heard a voice from the four horns of the ( Q ) golden altar which is before God ,
NKJV	Revelation	9	14	saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet , “ Release the four angels who are bound ( R ) at the great river Euphrates. ”
NKJV	Revelation	9	15	So the four angels , who had been prepared for the hour and day and month and year , were released to kill a ( S ) third of mankind .
NKJV	Revelation	9	16	Now ( T ) the number of the army ( U ) of the horsemen was two hundred million ; ( V ) I heard the number of them .
NKJV	Revelation	9	17	And thus I saw the horses in the vision : those who sat on them had breastplates of fiery red , hyacinth blue , and sulfur yellow ; ( W ) and the heads of the horses were like the heads of lions ; and out of their mouths came fire , smoke , and brimstone .
NKJV	Revelation	9	18	By these three plagues a third of mankind was killed—by the fire and the smoke and the brimstone which came out of their mouths .
NKJV	Revelation	9	19	For [ e ] their power is in their mouth and in their tails ; ( X ) for their tails are like serpents , having heads ; and with them they do harm .
NKJV	Revelation	9	20	But the rest of mankind , who were not killed by these plagues , ( Y ) did not repent of the works of their hands , that they should not worship ( Z ) demons , ( AA ) and idols of gold , silver , brass , stone , and wood , which can neither see nor hear nor walk .
NKJV	Revelation	9	21	And they did not repent of their murders ( AB ) or their [ f ] sorceries or their sexual immorality or their thefts .

NKJV	Revelation	10	10	Then I took the little book out of the angel ’ s hand and ate it , ( L ) and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth . But when I had eaten it , ( M ) my stomach became bitter .
NKJV	Revelation	10	2	He had a little book open in his hand . ( D ) And he set his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land ,
NKJV	Revelation	10	3	and cried with a loud voice , as when a lion roars . When he cried out , ( E ) seven thunders uttered their voices .
NKJV	Revelation	10	4	Now when the seven thunders [ a ] uttered their voices , I was about to write ; but I heard a voice from heaven saying [ b ] to me , ( F ) “ Seal up the things which the seven thunders uttered , and do not write them. ”
NKJV	Revelation	10	5	The angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land ( G ) raised up his [ c ] hand to heaven
NKJV	Revelation	10	6	and swore by Him who lives forever and ever , ( H ) who created heaven and the things that are in it , the earth and the things that are in it , and the sea and the things that are in it , ( I ) that there should be delay no longer ,
NKJV	Revelation	10	7	but ( J ) in the days of the sounding of the seventh angel , when he is about to sound , the mystery of God would be finished , as He declared to His servants the prophets . John Eats the Little Book
NKJV	Revelation	10	8	Then the voice which I heard from heaven spoke to me again and said , “ Go , take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel who stands on the sea and on the earth. ”
NKJV	Revelation	10	9	So I went to the angel and said to him , “ Give me the little book. ” And he said to me , ( K ) “ Take and eat it ; and it will make your stomach bitter , but it will be as sweet as honey in your mouth. ”

NKJV	Revelation	11	2	But leave out ( C ) the court which is outside the temple , and do not measure it , ( D ) for it has been given to the Gentiles . And they will ( E ) tread the holy city underfoot for ( F ) forty-two months .
NKJV	Revelation	11	3	And I will give power to my two ( G ) witnesses , ( H ) and they will prophesy ( I ) one thousand two hundred and sixty days , clothed in sackcloth. ”
NKJV	Revelation	11	4	These are the ( J ) two olive trees and the two lampstands standing before the [ b ] God of the earth .
NKJV	Revelation	11	5	And if anyone wants to harm them , ( K ) fire proceeds from their mouth and devours their enemies . ( L ) And if anyone wants to harm them , he must be killed in this manner .
NKJV	Revelation	11	6	These ( M ) have power to shut heaven , so that no rain falls in the days of their prophecy ; and they have power over waters to turn them to blood , and to strike the earth with all plagues , as often as they desire . The Witnesses Killed
NKJV	Revelation	11	7	When they ( N ) finish their testimony , ( O ) the beast that ascends ( P ) out of the bottomless pit ( Q ) will make war against them , overcome them , and kill them .
NKJV	Revelation	11	8	And their dead bodies will lie in the street of ( R ) the great city which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt , ( S ) where also [ c ] our Lord was crucified .
NKJV	Revelation	11	9	( T ) Then those from the peoples , tribes , tongues , and nations [ d ] will see their dead bodies three-and-a-half days , ( U ) and not allow their dead bodies to be put into graves .
NKJV	Revelation	11	10	( V ) And those who dwell on the earth will rejoice over them , make merry , ( W ) and send gifts to one another , ( X ) because these two prophets tormented those who dwell on the earth . The Witnesses Resurrected
NKJV	Revelation	11	12	And [ e ] they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them , “ Come up here. ” ( AA ) And they ascended to heaven ( AB ) in a cloud , ( AC ) and their enemies saw them .
NKJV	Revelation	11	13	In the same hour ( AD ) there was a great earthquake , ( AE ) and a tenth of the city fell . In the earthquake seven thousand people were killed , and the rest were afraid ( AF ) and gave glory to the God of heaven .
NKJV	Revelation	11	14	( AG ) The second woe is past . Behold , the third woe is coming quickly . Seventh Trumpet : The Kingdom Proclaimed
NKJV	Revelation	11	15	Then ( AH ) the seventh angel sounded : ( AI ) And there were loud voices in heaven , saying , ( AJ ) “ The [ f ] kingdoms of this world have become the kingdoms of our Lord and of His Christ , ( AK ) and He shall reign forever and ever ! ”
NKJV	Revelation	11	16	And ( AL ) the twenty-four elders who sat before God on their thrones fell on their faces and ( AM ) worshiped God ,
NKJV	Revelation	11	17	saying : “ We give You thanks , O Lord God Almighty , The One ( AN ) who is and who was [ g ] and who is to come , Because You have taken Your great power ( AO ) and reigned .

NKJV	Revelation	11	19	Then ( AR ) the temple of God was opened in heaven , and the ark of [ i ] His covenant was seen in His temple .

NKJV	Revelation	12	2	Then being with child , she cried out ( A ) in labor and in pain to give birth .
NKJV	Revelation	12	3	And another sign appeared in heaven : behold , ( B ) a great , fiery red dragon having seven heads and ten horns , and seven diadems on his heads .
NKJV	Revelation	12	4	( C ) His tail drew a third ( D ) of the stars of heaven ( E ) and threw them to the earth . And the dragon stood ( F ) before the woman who was ready to give birth , ( G ) to devour her Child as soon as it was born .
NKJV	Revelation	12	5	She bore a male Child ( H ) who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron . And her Child was ( I ) caught up to God and His throne .
NKJV	Revelation	12	6	Then ( J ) the woman fled into the wilderness , where she has a place prepared by God , that they should feed her there ( K ) one thousand two hundred and sixty days . Satan Thrown Out of Heaven
NKJV	Revelation	12	7	And war broke out in heaven : ( L ) Michael and his angels fought ( M ) with the dragon ; and the dragon and his angels fought ,
NKJV	Revelation	12	8	but they [ a ] did not prevail , nor was a place found for [ b ] them in heaven any longer .
NKJV	Revelation	12	9	So ( N ) the great dragon was cast out , ( O ) that serpent of old , called the Devil and Satan , ( P ) who deceives the whole world ; ( Q ) he was cast to the earth , and his angels were cast out with him .
NKJV	Revelation	12	10	Then I heard a loud voice saying in heaven , ( R ) “ Now salvation , and strength , and the kingdom of our God , and the power of His Christ have come , for the accuser of our brethren , ( S ) who accused them before our God day and night , has been cast down .
NKJV	Revelation	12	11	And ( T ) they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony , ( U ) and they did not love their lives to the death .
NKJV	Revelation	12	13	Now when the dragon saw that he had been cast to the earth , he persecuted ( Y ) the woman who gave birth to the male Child .
NKJV	Revelation	12	14	( Z ) But the woman was given two wings of a great eagle , ( AA ) that she might fly ( AB ) into the wilderness to her place , where she is nourished ( AC ) for a time and times and half a time , from the presence of the serpent .
NKJV	Revelation	12	15	So the serpent ( AD ) spewed water out of his mouth like a flood after the woman , that he might cause her to be carried away by the flood .
NKJV	Revelation	12	16	But the earth helped the woman , and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed up the flood which the dragon had spewed out of his mouth .
NKJV	Revelation	12	17	And the dragon was enraged with the woman , and he went to make war with the rest of her offspring , who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus [ c ] Christ .

NKJV	Revelation	13	13	( U ) He performs great signs , ( V ) so that he even makes fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men .
NKJV	Revelation	13	2	Now the beast which I saw was like a leopard , his feet were like the feet of a bear , and his mouth like the mouth of a lion . The ( D ) dragon gave him his power , his throne , and great authority .
NKJV	Revelation	13	3	And I saw one of his heads ( E ) as if it had been mortally wounded , and his deadly wound was healed . And ( F ) all the world marveled and followed the beast .
NKJV	Revelation	13	4	So they worshiped the dragon who gave authority to the beast ; and they worshiped the beast , saying , ( G ) “ Who is like the beast ? Who is able to make war with him ? ”
NKJV	Revelation	13	5	And he was given ( H ) a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies , and he was given authority to [ c ] continue for ( I ) forty-two months .
NKJV	Revelation	13	6	Then he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God , to blaspheme His name , ( J ) His tabernacle , and those who dwell in heaven .
NKJV	Revelation	13	7	It was granted to him ( K ) to make war with the saints and to overcome them . And ( L ) authority was given him over every [ d ] tribe , tongue , and nation .
NKJV	Revelation	13	8	All who dwell on the earth will worship him , ( M ) whose names have not been written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slain ( N ) from the foundation of the world .

NKJV	Revelation	13	10	( P ) He who leads into captivity shall go into captivity ; ( Q ) he who kills with the sword must be killed with the sword . ( R ) Here is the [ e ] patience and the faith of the saints . The Beast from the Earth
NKJV	Revelation	13	11	Then I saw another beast ( S ) coming up out of the earth , and he had two horns like a lamb and spoke like a dragon .
NKJV	Revelation	13	12	And he exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence , and causes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast , ( T ) whose deadly wound was healed .
NKJV	Revelation	13	14	( W ) And he deceives [ f ] those who dwell on the earth ( X ) by those signs which he was granted to do in the sight of the beast , telling those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the beast who was wounded by the sword ( Y ) and lived .
NKJV	Revelation	13	15	He was granted power to give breath to the image of the beast , that the image of the beast should both speak ( Z ) and cause as many as would not worship the image of the beast to be killed .
NKJV	Revelation	13	16	He causes all , both small and great , rich and poor , free and slave , ( AA ) to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads ,
NKJV	Revelation	13	17	and that no one may buy or sell except one who has [ g ] the mark or ( AB ) the name of the beast , ( AC ) or the number of his name .

NKJV	Revelation	17	3	So he carried me away in the Spirit ( G ) into the wilderness . And I saw a woman sitting ( H ) on a scarlet beast which was full of ( I ) names of blasphemy , having seven heads and ten horns .

NKJV	Revelation	17	8	The beast that you saw was , and is not , and ( R ) will ascend out of the bottomless pit and ( S ) go to [ d ] perdition . And those who ( T ) dwell on the earth ( U ) will marvel , ( V ) whose names are not written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world , when they see the beast that was , and is not , and [ e ] yet is .
NKJV	Revelation	17	9	( W ) “ Here is the mind which has wisdom : ( X ) The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sits .
NKJV	Revelation	17	10	There are also seven kings . Five have fallen , one is , and the other has not yet come . And when he comes , he must ( Y ) continue a short time .

NKJV	Revelation	18	7	( N ) In the measure that she glorified herself and lived [ e ] luxuriously , in the same measure give her torment and sorrow ; for she says in her heart , ‘ I sit as ( O ) queen , and am no widow , and will not see sorrow. ’
NKJV	Revelation	18	8	Therefore her plagues will come ( P ) in one day—death and mourning and famine . And ( Q ) she will be utterly burned with fire , ( R ) for strong is the Lord God who [ f ] judges her . The World Mourns Babylon ’ s Fall
NKJV	Revelation	18	9	( S ) “ The kings of the earth who committed fornication and lived luxuriously with her ( T ) will weep and lament for her , ( U ) when they see the smoke of her burning ,

NKJV	Revelation	18	13	and cinnamon and incense , fragrant oil and frankincense , wine and oil , fine flour and wheat , cattle and sheep , horses and chariots , and bodies and ( Z ) souls of men .
NKJV	Revelation	18	14	The fruit that your soul longed for has gone from you , and all the things which are rich and splendid have [ g ] gone from you , and you shall find them no more at all .
NKJV	Revelation	18	15	The merchants of these things , who became rich by her , will stand at a distance for fear of her torment , weeping and wailing ,

NKJV	Revelation	18	21	Then a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea , saying , ( AK ) “ Thus with violence the great city Babylon shall be thrown down , and ( AL ) shall not be found anymore .
NKJV	Revelation	18	22	( AM ) The sound of harpists , musicians , flutists , and trumpeters shall not be heard in you anymore . No craftsman of any craft shall be found in you anymore , and the sound of a millstone shall not be heard in you anymore .
