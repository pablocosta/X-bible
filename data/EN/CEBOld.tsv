CEB	Genesis	1	1	When God began to create [ a ] the heavens and the earth—
CEB	Genesis	1	2	the earth was without shape or form , it was dark over the deep sea , and God ’ s wind swept over the waters—
CEB	Genesis	1	3	God said , “ Let there be light. ” And so light appeared .
CEB	Genesis	1	4	God saw how good the light was . God separated the light from the darkness .
CEB	Genesis	1	5	God named the light Day and the darkness Night . There was evening and there was morning : the first day .
CEB	Genesis	1	6	God said , “ Let there be a dome in the middle of the waters to separate the waters from each other. ”
CEB	Genesis	1	7	God made the dome and separated the waters under the dome from the waters above the dome . And it happened in that way .
CEB	Genesis	1	8	God named the dome Sky . There was evening and there was morning : the second day .
CEB	Genesis	1	9	God said , “ Let the waters under the sky come together into one place so that the dry land can appear. ” And that ’ s what happened .
CEB	Genesis	1	10	God named the dry land Earth , and he named the gathered waters Seas . God saw how good it was .
CEB	Genesis	1	11	God said , “ Let the earth grow plant life : plants yielding seeds and fruit trees bearing fruit with seeds inside it , each according to its kind throughout the earth. ” And that ’ s what happened .
CEB	Genesis	1	12	The earth produced plant life : plants yielding seeds , each according to its kind , and trees bearing fruit with seeds inside it , each according to its kind . God saw how good it was .
CEB	Genesis	1	13	There was evening and there was morning : the third day .
CEB	Genesis	1	14	God said , “ Let there be lights in the dome of the sky to separate the day from the night . They will mark events , sacred seasons , days , and years .
CEB	Genesis	1	15	They will be lights in the dome of the sky to shine on the earth. ” And that ’ s what happened .
CEB	Genesis	1	16	God made the stars and two great lights : the larger light to rule over the day and the smaller light to rule over the night .
CEB	Genesis	1	17	God put them in the dome of the sky to shine on the earth ,
CEB	Genesis	1	18	to rule over the day and over the night , and to separate the light from the darkness . God saw how good it was .
CEB	Genesis	1	19	There was evening and there was morning : the fourth day .
CEB	Genesis	1	20	God said , “ Let the waters swarm with living things , and let birds fly above the earth up in the dome of the sky. ”
CEB	Genesis	1	21	God created the great sea animals and all the tiny living things that swarm in the waters , each according to its kind , and all the winged birds , each according to its kind . God saw how good it was .
CEB	Genesis	1	22	Then God blessed them : “ Be fertile and multiply and fill the waters in the seas , and let the birds multiply on the earth. ”
CEB	Genesis	1	23	There was evening and there was morning : the fifth day .
CEB	Genesis	1	24	God said , “ Let the earth produce every kind of living thing : livestock , crawling things , and wildlife. ” And that ’ s what happened .
CEB	Genesis	1	25	God made every kind of wildlife , every kind of livestock , and every kind of creature that crawls on the ground . God saw how good it was .
CEB	Genesis	1	26	Then God said , “ Let us make humanity in our image to resemble us so that they may take charge of the fish of the sea , the birds in the sky , the livestock , all the earth , and all the crawling things on earth. ”
CEB	Genesis	1	27	God created humanity in God ’ s own image , in the divine image God created them , [ b ] male and female God created them .
CEB	Genesis	1	28	God blessed them and said to them , “ Be fertile and multiply ; fill the earth and master it . Take charge of the fish of the sea , the birds in the sky , and everything crawling on the ground. ”
CEB	Genesis	1	29	Then God said , “ I now give to you all the plants on the earth that yield seeds and all the trees whose fruit produces its seeds within it . These will be your food .
CEB	Genesis	1	30	To all wildlife , to all the birds in the sky , and to everything crawling on the ground—to everything that breathes—I give all the green grasses for food. ” And that ’ s what happened .
CEB	Genesis	1	31	God saw everything he had made : it was supremely good . There was evening and there was morning : the sixth day . Footnotes - Genesis 1:1 Or In the beginning , God created - Genesis 1:27 Heb has singular him , referring to humanity .
CEB	Genesis	2	2	On the sixth [ a ] day God completed all the work that he had done , and on the seventh day God rested from all the work that he had done .
CEB	Genesis	2	3	God blessed the seventh day and made it holy , because on it God rested from all the work of creation . [ b ]
CEB	Genesis	2	4	This is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created . World ’ s creation in the garden On the day the Lord God made earth and sky—
CEB	Genesis	2	5	before any wild plants appeared on the earth , and before any field crops grew , because the Lord God hadn ’ t yet sent rain on the earth and there was still no human being [ c ] to farm the fertile land ,
CEB	Genesis	2	6	though a stream rose from the earth and watered all of the fertile land—
CEB	Genesis	2	7	the Lord God formed the human [ d ] from the topsoil of the fertile land [ e ] and blew life ’ s breath into his nostrils . The human came to life .
CEB	Genesis	2	8	The Lord God planted a garden in Eden in the east and put there the human he had formed .
CEB	Genesis	2	9	In the fertile land , the Lord God grew every beautiful tree with edible fruit , and also he grew the tree of life in the middle of the garden and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil .
CEB	Genesis	2	10	A river flows from Eden to water the garden , and from there it divides into four headwaters .
CEB	Genesis	2	11	The name of the first river is the Pishon . It flows around the entire land of Havilah , where there is gold .
CEB	Genesis	2	12	That land ’ s gold is pure , and the land also has sweet-smelling resins and gemstones . [ f ]
CEB	Genesis	2	13	The name of the second river is the Gihon . It flows around the entire land of Cush .
CEB	Genesis	2	14	The name of the third river is the Tigris , flowing east of Assyria ; and the name of the fourth river is the Euphrates .
CEB	Genesis	2	15	The Lord God took the human and settled him in the garden of Eden to farm it and to take care of it .
CEB	Genesis	2	16	The Lord God commanded the human , “ Eat your fill from all of the garden ’ s trees ;
CEB	Genesis	2	17	but don ’ t eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil , because on the day you eat from it , you will die ! ”
CEB	Genesis	2	18	Then the Lord God said , “ It ’ s not good that the human is alone . I will make him a helper that is perfect for him. ”
CEB	Genesis	2	19	So the Lord God formed from the fertile land all the wild animals and all the birds in the sky and brought them to the human to see what he would name them . The human gave each living being its name .
CEB	Genesis	2	20	The human named all the livestock , all the birds in the sky , and all the wild animals . But a helper perfect for him was nowhere to be found .
CEB	Genesis	2	21	So the Lord God put the human into a deep and heavy sleep , and took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh over it .
CEB	Genesis	2	22	With the rib taken from the human , the Lord God fashioned a woman and brought her to the human being .
CEB	Genesis	2	23	The human [ g ] said , “ This one finally is bone from my bones and flesh from my flesh . She will be called a woman [ h ] because from a man [ i ] she was taken. ”
CEB	Genesis	2	24	This is the reason that a man leaves his father and mother and embraces his wife , and they become one flesh .
CEB	Genesis	2	25	The two of them were naked , the man and his wife , but they weren ’ t embarrassed .

CEB	Genesis	3	3	but not the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden . God said , ‘ Don ’ t eat from it , and don ’ t touch it , or you will die. ’ ”
CEB	Genesis	3	2	The woman said to the snake , “ We may eat the fruit of the garden ’ s trees
CEB	Genesis	3	4	The snake said to the woman , “ You won ’ t die !
CEB	Genesis	3	5	God knows that on the day you eat from it , you will see clearly and you will be like God , knowing good and evil. ”
CEB	Genesis	3	6	The woman saw that the tree was beautiful with delicious food and that the tree would provide wisdom , so she took some of its fruit and ate it , and also gave some to her husband , who was with her , and he ate it .
CEB	Genesis	3	7	Then they both saw clearly and knew that they were naked . So they sewed fig leaves together and made garments for themselves .
CEB	Genesis	3	8	During that day ’ s cool evening breeze , they heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden ; and the man and his wife hid themselves from the Lord God in the middle of the garden ’ s trees .
CEB	Genesis	3	9	The Lord God called to the man and said to him , “ Where are you ? ”
CEB	Genesis	3	10	The man [ b ] replied , “ I heard your sound in the garden ; I was afraid because I was naked , and I hid myself. ”
CEB	Genesis	3	11	He said , “ Who told you that you were naked ? Did you eat from the tree , which I commanded you not to eat ? ”
CEB	Genesis	3	12	The man said , “ The woman you gave me , she gave me some fruit [ c ] from the tree , and I ate. ”
CEB	Genesis	3	13	The Lord God said to the woman , “ What have you done ? ! ” And the woman said , “ The snake tricked me , and I ate. ”
CEB	Genesis	3	14	The Lord God said to the snake , “ Because you did this , you are the one cursed out of all the farm animals , out of all the wild animals . On your belly you will crawl , and dust you will eat every day of your life .
CEB	Genesis	3	15	I will put contempt between you and the woman , between your offspring and hers . They will strike your head , but you will strike at their heels. ”
CEB	Genesis	3	16	To the woman he said , “ I will make your pregnancy very painful ; in pain you will bear children . You will desire your husband , but he will rule over you. ”
CEB	Genesis	3	17	To the man he said , “ Because you listened to your wife ’ s voice and you ate from the tree that I commanded , ‘ Don ’ t eat from it , ’ cursed is the fertile land because of you ; in pain you will eat from it every day of your life .
CEB	Genesis	3	18	Weeds and thistles will grow for you , even as you eat the field ’ s plants ;
CEB	Genesis	3	19	by the sweat of your face you will eat bread— until you return to the fertile land , since from it you were taken ; you are soil , to the soil you will return. ”
CEB	Genesis	3	20	The man named his wife Eve [ d ] because she is the mother of everyone who lives .
CEB	Genesis	3	21	The Lord God made the man and his wife leather clothes and dressed them .
CEB	Genesis	3	22	The Lord God said , “ The human being [ e ] has now become like one of us , knowing good and evil. ” Now , so he doesn ’ t stretch out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat and live forever ,
CEB	Genesis	3	23	the Lord God sent him out of the garden of Eden to farm the fertile land from which he was taken .
CEB	Genesis	3	24	He drove out the human . To the east of the garden of Eden , he stationed winged creatures wielding flaming swords to guard the way to the tree of life .

CEB	Genesis	4	3	Some time later , Cain presented an offering to the Lord from the land ’ s crops
CEB	Genesis	4	5	but didn ’ t look favorably on Cain and his sacrifice . Cain became very angry and looked resentful .
CEB	Genesis	4	6	The Lord said to Cain , “ Why are you angry , and why do you look so resentful ?

CEB	Genesis	4	10	The Lord said , “ What did you do ? The voice of your brother ’ s blood is crying to me from the ground .
CEB	Genesis	4	11	You are now cursed from the ground that opened its mouth to take your brother ’ s blood from your hand .
CEB	Genesis	4	12	When you farm the fertile land , it will no longer grow anything for you , and you will become a roving nomad on the earth. ”
CEB	Genesis	4	13	Cain said to the Lord , “ My punishment is more than I can bear .
CEB	Genesis	4	14	Now that you ’ ve driven me away from the fertile land and I am hidden from your presence , I ’ m about to become a roving nomad on the earth , and anyone who finds me will kill me. ”

CEB	Genesis	8	8	Then he sent out a dove to see if the waters on all of the fertile land had subsided ,
CEB	Genesis	8	2	The springs of the deep sea and the skies [ a ] closed up . The skies held back the rain .
CEB	Genesis	8	3	The waters receded gradually from the earth . After one hundred fifty days , the waters decreased ;
CEB	Genesis	8	4	and in the seventh month , on the seventeenth day , the ark came to rest on the Ararat mountains .
CEB	Genesis	8	5	The waters decreased gradually until the tenth month , and on the first day of the tenth month the mountain peaks appeared .
CEB	Genesis	8	6	After forty days , Noah opened the window of the ark that he had made .
CEB	Genesis	8	7	He sent out a raven , and it flew back and forth until the waters over the entire earth had dried up .
CEB	Genesis	8	9	but the dove found no place to set its foot . It returned to him in the ark since waters still covered the entire earth . Noah stretched out his hand , took it , and brought it back into the ark .
CEB	Genesis	8	10	He waited seven more days and sent the dove out from the ark again .
CEB	Genesis	8	11	The dove came back to him in the evening , grasping a torn olive leaf in its beak . Then Noah knew that the waters were subsiding from the earth .
CEB	Genesis	8	12	He waited seven more days and sent out the dove , but it didn ’ t come back to him again .
CEB	Genesis	8	13	In Noah ’ s six hundred first year , on the first day of the first month , the waters dried up from the earth . Noah removed the ark ’ s hatch and saw that the surface of the fertile land had dried up .
CEB	Genesis	8	14	In the second month , on the twenty-seventh day , the earth was dry .
CEB	Genesis	8	15	God spoke to Noah ,
CEB	Genesis	8	16	“ Go out of the ark , you and your wife , your sons , and your sons ’ wives with you .
CEB	Genesis	8	17	Bring out with you all the animals of every kind—birds , livestock , everything crawling on the ground—so that they may populate the earth , be fertile , and multiply on the earth. ”
CEB	Genesis	8	18	So Noah went out of the ark with his sons , his wife , and his sons ’ wives .
CEB	Genesis	8	19	All the animals , all the livestock , [ b ] all the birds , and everything crawling on the ground , came out of the ark by their families . God ’ s promise for the earth

CEB	Genesis	14	17	After Abram returned from his attack on Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him , the king of Sodom came out to the Shaveh Valley ( that is , the King ’ s Valley ) to meet him .
CEB	Genesis	14	18	Now Melchizedek the king of Salem and the priest of El Elyon [ b ] had brought bread and wine ,
CEB	Genesis	14	19	and he blessed him , “ Bless Abram by El Elyon , creator of heaven and earth ;
CEB	Genesis	14	20	bless El Elyon , who gave you the victory over your enemies. ” Abram gave Melchizedek one-tenth of everything .
CEB	Genesis	14	21	Then the king of Sodom said to Abram , “ Give me the people and take the property for yourself. ”
CEB	Genesis	14	22	But Abram said to the king of Sodom , “ I promised the Lord , El Elyon , creator of heaven and earth ,
CEB	Genesis	14	23	that I wouldn ’ t take even a thread or a sandal strap from anything that was yours so that you couldn ’ t say , ‘ I ’ m the one who made Abram rich. ’

CEB	Genesis	15	3	He continued , “ Since you haven ’ t given me any children , the head of my household will be my heir. ”
CEB	Genesis	15	4	The Lord ’ s word came immediately to him , “ This man will not be your heir . Your heir will definitely be your very own biological child. ”
CEB	Genesis	15	5	Then he brought Abram outside and said , “ Look up at the sky and count the stars if you think you can count them. ” He continued , “ This is how many children you will have. ”
CEB	Genesis	15	6	Abram trusted the Lord , and the Lord recognized Abram ’ s high moral character .
CEB	Genesis	15	7	He said to Abram , “ I am the Lord , who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land as your possession. ”
CEB	Genesis	15	8	But Abram said , “ Lord God , how do I know that I will actually possess it ? ”
CEB	Genesis	15	9	He said , “ Bring me a three-year-old female calf , a three-year-old female goat , a three-year-old ram , a dove , and a young pigeon. ”
CEB	Genesis	15	10	He took all of these animals , split them in half , and laid the halves facing each other , but he didn ’ t split the birds .
CEB	Genesis	15	11	When vultures swooped down on the carcasses , Abram waved them off .
CEB	Genesis	15	12	After the sun set , Abram slept deeply . A terrifying and deep darkness settled over him .
CEB	Genesis	15	13	Then the Lord said to Abram , “ Have no doubt that your descendants will live as immigrants in a land that isn ’ t their own , where they will be oppressed slaves for four hundred years .
CEB	Genesis	15	14	But after I punish the nation they serve , they will leave it with great wealth .

CEB	Genesis	17	12	On the eighth day after birth , every male in every generation must be circumcised , including those who are not your own children : those born in your household and those purchased with silver from foreigners .
CEB	Genesis	17	13	years old when the flesh of his foreskin was circumcised .
CEB	Genesis	17	14	Any uncircumcised male whose flesh of his foreskin remains uncircumcised will be cut off from his people . He has broken my covenant. ”
CEB	Genesis	17	15	God said to Abraham , “ As for your wife Sarai , you will no longer call her Sarai . Her name will now be Sarah .
CEB	Genesis	17	16	I will bless her and even give you a son from her . I will bless her so that she will become nations , and kings of peoples will come from her. ”
CEB	Genesis	17	18	To God Abraham said , “ If only you would accept Ishmael ! ”
CEB	Genesis	17	19	But God said , “ No , your wife Sarah will give birth to a son for you , and you will name him Isaac . [ d ] I will set up my covenant with him and with his descendants after him as an enduring covenant .
CEB	Genesis	17	20	As for Ishmael , I ’ ve heard your request . I will bless him and make him fertile and give him many , many descendants . He will be the ancestor of twelve tribal leaders , and I will make a great nation of him .
CEB	Genesis	17	21	But I will set up my covenant with Isaac , who will be born to Sarah at this time next year. ”
CEB	Genesis	17	22	When God finished speaking to him , God ascended , leaving Abraham alone .
CEB	Genesis	17	23	Abraham took his son Ishmael , all those born in his household , and all those purchased with his silver—that is , every male in Abraham ’ s household—and he circumcised the flesh of their foreskins that same day , just as God had told him to do .
CEB	Genesis	17	24	Abraham was
CEB	Genesis	17	25	and his son Ishmael was
CEB	Genesis	17	26	That same day Abraham and his son Ishmael were circumcised .
CEB	Genesis	17	27	All the men of his household , those born in his household and those purchased with silver from foreigners , were circumcised with him .

CEB	Genesis	18	18	Abraham will certainly become a great populous nation , and all the earth ’ s nations will be blessed because of him .
CEB	Genesis	18	2	He looked up and suddenly saw three men standing near him . As soon as he saw them , he ran from his tent entrance to greet them and bowed deeply .
CEB	Genesis	18	3	He said , “ Sirs , if you would be so kind , don ’ t just pass by your servant .
CEB	Genesis	18	4	Let a little water be brought so you may wash your feet and refresh yourselves under the tree .
CEB	Genesis	18	5	Let me offer you a little bread so you will feel stronger , and after that you may leave your servant and go on your way—since you have visited your servant. ” They responded , “ Fine . Do just as you have said. ”
CEB	Genesis	18	6	So Abraham hurried to Sarah at his tent and said , “ Hurry ! Knead three seahs [ a ] of the finest flour and make some baked goods ! ”
CEB	Genesis	18	7	Abraham ran to the cattle , took a healthy young calf , and gave it to a young servant , who prepared it quickly .
CEB	Genesis	18	8	Then Abraham took butter , milk , and the calf that had been prepared , put the food in front of them , and stood under the tree near them as they ate .
CEB	Genesis	18	9	They said to him , “ Where ’ s your wife Sarah ? ” And he said , “ Right here in the tent. ”
CEB	Genesis	18	10	Then one of the men said , “ I will definitely return to you about this time next year . Then your wife Sarah will have a son ! ” Sarah was listening at the tent door behind him .
CEB	Genesis	18	11	Now Abraham and Sarah were both very old . Sarah was no longer menstruating .
CEB	Genesis	18	12	So Sarah laughed to herself , thinking , I ’ m no longer able to have children and my husband ’ s old .
CEB	Genesis	18	13	The Lord said to Abraham , “ Why did Sarah laugh and say , ‘ Me give birth ? At my age ? ’
CEB	Genesis	18	14	Is anything too difficult for the Lord ? When I return to you about this time next year , Sarah will have a son. ”
CEB	Genesis	18	15	Sarah lied and said , “ I didn ’ t laugh , ” because she was frightened . But he said , “ No , you laughed. ” Abraham pleads for Sodom
CEB	Genesis	18	16	The men got up from there and went over to look down on Sodom . Abraham was walking along with them to send them off
CEB	Genesis	18	17	when the Lord said , “ Will I keep from Abraham what I ’ m about to do ?
CEB	Genesis	18	19	I have formed a relationship with him so that he will instruct his children and his household after him . And they will keep to the Lord ’ s path , being moral and just so that the Lord can do for Abraham everything he said he would. ”
CEB	Genesis	18	20	Then the Lord said , “ The cries of injustice from Sodom and Gomorrah are countless , and their sin is very serious !
CEB	Genesis	18	21	I will go down now to examine the cries of injustice that have reached me . Have they really done all this ? If not , I want to know. ”
CEB	Genesis	18	22	The men turned away and walked toward Sodom , but Abraham remained standing in front of the Lord . [ b ]
CEB	Genesis	18	23	Abraham approached and said , “ Will you really sweep away the innocent [ c ] with the guilty ? [ d ]
CEB	Genesis	18	24	What if there are fifty innocent people in the city ? Will you really sweep it away and not save the place for the sake of the fifty innocent people in it ?
CEB	Genesis	18	25	It ’ s not like you to do this , killing the innocent with the guilty as if there were no difference . It ’ s not like you ! Will the judge of all the earth not act justly ? ”
CEB	Genesis	18	26	The Lord said , “ If I find fifty innocent people in the city of Sodom , I will save it because of them. ”
CEB	Genesis	18	27	Abraham responded , “ Since I ’ ve already decided to speak with my Lord , even though I ’ m just soil and ash ,
CEB	Genesis	18	28	what if there are five fewer innocent people than fifty ? Will you destroy the whole city over just five ? ” The Lord said , “ If I find forty-five there , I won ’ t destroy it. ”
CEB	Genesis	18	29	Once again Abraham spoke , “ What if forty are there ? ” The Lord said , “ For the sake of forty , I will do nothing. ”
CEB	Genesis	18	30	He said , “ Don ’ t be angry with me , my Lord , but let me speak . What if thirty are there ? ” The Lord said , “ I won ’ t do it if I find thirty there. ”
CEB	Genesis	18	31	Abraham said , “ Since I ’ ve already decided to speak with my Lord , what if twenty are there ? ” The Lord said , “ I won ’ t do it , for the sake of twenty. ”
CEB	Genesis	18	32	Abraham said , “ Don ’ t be angry with me , my Lord , but let me speak just once more . What if there are ten ? ” And the Lord said , “ I will not destroy it because of those ten. ”
CEB	Genesis	18	33	When the Lord finished speaking with Abraham , he left ; but Abraham stayed there in that place .

CEB	Genesis	19	19	You ’ ve done me a favor and have been so kind to save my life . But I can ’ t escape to the mountains since the catastrophe might overtake me there and I ’ d die .
CEB	Genesis	19	2	He said , “ Come to your servant ’ s house , spend the night , and wash your feet . Then you can get up early and go on your way. ” But they said , “ No , we will spend the night in the town square. ”
CEB	Genesis	19	3	He pleaded earnestly with them , so they went with him and entered his house . He made a big meal for them , even baking unleavened bread , and they ate .
CEB	Genesis	19	4	Before they went to bed , the men of the city of Sodom—everyone from the youngest to the oldest—surrounded the house
CEB	Genesis	19	5	and called to Lot , “ Where are the men who arrived tonight ? Bring them out to us so that we may have sex with them. ”
CEB	Genesis	19	6	Lot went out toward the entrance , closed the door behind him ,
CEB	Genesis	19	7	and said , “ My brothers , don ’ t do such an evil thing .
CEB	Genesis	19	8	I ’ ve got two daughters who are virgins . Let me bring them out to you , and you may do to them whatever you wish . But don ’ t do anything to these men because they are now under the protection of my roof. ”
CEB	Genesis	19	9	They said , “ Get out of the way ! ” And they continued , “ Does this immigrant want to judge us ? Now we will hurt you more than we will hurt them. ” They pushed Lot back and came close to breaking down the door .
CEB	Genesis	19	10	The men inside reached out and pulled Lot back into the house with them and slammed the door .
CEB	Genesis	19	11	Then the messengers blinded the men near the entrance of the house , from the youngest to the oldest , so that they groped around trying to find the entrance .
CEB	Genesis	19	12	The men said to Lot , “ Who ’ s still with you here ? Take away from this place your sons-in-law , your sons , your daughters , and everyone else you have in the city
CEB	Genesis	19	13	because we are about to destroy this place . The Lord has found the cries of injustice so serious that the Lord sent us to destroy it. ”
CEB	Genesis	19	14	Lot went to speak to his sons-in-law , married to his daughters , and said , “ Get up and get out of this place because the Lord is about to destroy the city. ” But his sons-in-law thought he was joking .
CEB	Genesis	19	15	When dawn broke , the messengers urged Lot , “ Get up and take your wife and your two daughters who are here so that you are not swept away because of the evil in this city. ”
CEB	Genesis	19	16	He hesitated , but because the Lord intended to save him , the men grabbed him , his wife , and two daughters by the hand , took him out , and left him outside the city .
CEB	Genesis	19	17	After getting them out , the men said , “ Save your lives ! Don ’ t look back ! And don ’ t stay in the valley . Escape to the mountains so that you are not swept away. ”
CEB	Genesis	19	18	But Lot said to them , “ No , my lords , please .
CEB	Genesis	19	20	This city here is close enough to flee to , and it ’ s small . It ’ s small , right ? Let me escape there , and my life will be saved. ”
CEB	Genesis	19	21	He said to Lot , “ I ’ ll do this for you as well ; I won ’ t overthrow the city that you have described .
CEB	Genesis	19	22	Hurry ! Escape to it ! I can ’ t do anything until you get there. ” That is why the name of the city is Zoar . [ a ] Sodom and Gomorrah destroyed
CEB	Genesis	19	23	As the sun rose over the earth , Lot arrived in Zoar ;
CEB	Genesis	19	24	and the Lord rained down burning asphalt from the skies onto Sodom and Gomorrah .
CEB	Genesis	19	25	The Lord destroyed these cities , the entire valley , everyone who lived in the cities , and all of the fertile land ’ s vegetation .
CEB	Genesis	19	26	When Lot ’ s wife looked back , she turned into a pillar of salt .
CEB	Genesis	19	27	Abraham set out early for the place where he had stood with the Lord ,
CEB	Genesis	19	28	and looked out over Sodom and Gomorrah and over all the land of the valley . He saw the smoke from the land rise like the smoke from a kiln . Origin of Moab and Ammon
CEB	Genesis	19	29	When God destroyed the cities in the valley , God remembered Abraham and sent Lot away from the disaster that overtook the cities in which Lot had lived .
CEB	Genesis	19	30	Since Lot had become fearful of living in Zoar , he and his two daughters headed up from Zoar and settled in the mountains where he and his two daughters lived in a cave .
CEB	Genesis	19	31	The older daughter said to the younger , “ Our father is old , and there are no men in the land to sleep with us as is the custom everywhere .
CEB	Genesis	19	32	Come on , let ’ s give our father wine to drink , lie down with him , and we ’ ll have children from our father. ”
CEB	Genesis	19	33	That night they served their father wine , and the older daughter went in and lay down with her father , without him noticing when she lay down or got up .
CEB	Genesis	19	34	The next day the older daughter said to the younger , “ Since I lay down with our father last night , let ’ s serve him wine tonight too , and you go in and lie down with him so that we will both have children from our father. ”
CEB	Genesis	19	35	They served their father wine that night also , and the younger daughter lay down with him , without him knowing when she lay down or got up .
CEB	Genesis	19	36	Both of Lot ’ s daughters became pregnant by their father .
CEB	Genesis	19	37	The older daughter gave birth to a son and named him Moab . He is the ancestor of today ’ s Moabites .
CEB	Genesis	19	38	The younger daughter also gave birth to a son and named him Ben-ammi . [ b ] He is the ancestor of today ’ s Ammonites . Footnotes - Genesis 19:22 Or small - Genesis 19:38 Or son of my people
CEB	Genesis	20	20	Abraham traveled from there toward the land of the arid southern plain , and he settled as an immigrant in Gerar , between Kadesh and Shur .
CEB	Genesis	20	2	Abraham said of his wife Sarah , “ She ’ s my sister. ” So King Abimelech of Gerar took her into his household .
CEB	Genesis	20	3	But God appeared to Abimelech that night in a dream and said to him , “ You are as good as dead because of this woman you have taken . She is a married woman. ”
CEB	Genesis	20	4	Now Abimelech hadn ’ t gone near her , and he said , “ Lord , will you really put an innocent nation to death ?
CEB	Genesis	20	5	Didn ’ t he say to me , ‘ She ’ s my sister , ’ and didn ’ t she—even she—say , ‘ He ’ s my brother ’ ? My intentions were pure , and I acted innocently when I did this. ”
CEB	Genesis	20	6	God said to him in the dream , “ I know that your intentions were pure when you did this . In fact , I kept you from sinning against me . That ’ s why I didn ’ t allow you to touch her .
CEB	Genesis	20	7	Now return the man ’ s wife . He ’ s a prophet ; he will pray for you so you may live . But if you don ’ t return her , know that you and everyone with you will die ! ”
CEB	Genesis	20	8	Abimelech got up early in the morning and summoned all of his servants . When he told them everything that had happened , the men were terrified .
CEB	Genesis	20	9	Then Abimelech summoned Abraham and said to him , “ What have you done to us ? What sin did I commit against you that you have brought this terrible sin to me and my kingdom , by doing to me something that simply isn ’ t done ? ”
CEB	Genesis	20	10	Abimelech said to Abraham , “ What were you thinking when you did this thing ? ”
CEB	Genesis	20	11	Abraham said , “ I thought to myself , No one reveres God here and they will kill me to get my wife .
CEB	Genesis	20	12	She is , truthfully , my sister—my father ’ s daughter but not my mother ’ s daughter—and she ’ s now my wife .
CEB	Genesis	20	13	When God led me away from my father ’ s household , I said to her , ‘ This is the loyalty I expect from you : in each place we visit , tell them , “ He is my brother. ” ’ ”
CEB	Genesis	20	14	Abimelech took flocks , cattle , male servants , and female servants , and gave them to Abraham ; and Abimelech returned his wife Sarah .
CEB	Genesis	20	15	Abimelech said , “ My land is here available to you . Live wherever you wish. ”
CEB	Genesis	20	16	To Sarah , he said , “ I ’ ve given your brother one thousand pieces of silver . It means that neither you nor anyone with you has done anything wrong . Everything has been set right. ”
CEB	Genesis	20	17	Abraham prayed to God ; and God restored Abimelech , his wife , and his women servants to health , and they were able to have children .
CEB	Genesis	20	18	Because of the incident with Abraham ’ s wife Sarah , the Lord had kept all of the women in Abimelech ’ s household from having children .
CEB	Genesis	21	21	He lived in the Paran desert , and his mother found him an Egyptian wife . Abraham ’ s treaty with the Philistines
CEB	Genesis	21	2	She became pregnant and gave birth to a son for Abraham when he was old , at the very time God had told him .
CEB	Genesis	21	3	Abraham named his son—the one Sarah bore him—Isaac . [ a ]
CEB	Genesis	21	4	Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old just as God had commanded him .
CEB	Genesis	21	5	Abraham was
CEB	Genesis	21	100	years old when his son Isaac was born .
CEB	Genesis	21	6	Sarah said , “ God has given me laughter . Everyone who hears about it will laugh with me. ” [ b ]
CEB	Genesis	21	7	She said , “ Who could have told Abraham that Sarah would nurse sons ? But now I ’ ve given birth to a son when he was old ! ” Hagar and Ishmael evicted
CEB	Genesis	21	8	The boy grew and stopped nursing . On the day he stopped nursing , Abraham prepared a huge banquet .
CEB	Genesis	21	9	Sarah saw Hagar ’ s son laughing , the one Hagar the Egyptian had borne to Abraham .
CEB	Genesis	21	10	So she said to Abraham , “ Send this servant away with her son ! This servant ’ s son won ’ t share the inheritance with my son Isaac. ”
CEB	Genesis	21	11	This upset Abraham terribly because the boy was his son .
CEB	Genesis	21	12	God said to Abraham , “ Don ’ t be upset about the boy and your servant . Do everything Sarah tells you to do because your descendants will be traced through Isaac .
CEB	Genesis	21	13	But I will make of your servant ’ s son a great nation too , because he is also your descendant. ”
CEB	Genesis	21	14	Abraham got up early in the morning , took some bread and a flask of water , and gave it to Hagar . He put the boy in her shoulder sling and sent her away . She left and wandered through the desert near Beer-sheba .
CEB	Genesis	21	15	Finally the water in the flask ran out , and she put the boy down under one of the desert shrubs .
CEB	Genesis	21	16	She walked away from him about as far as a bow shot and sat down , telling herself , I can ’ t bear to see the boy die . She sat at a distance , cried out in grief , and wept .
CEB	Genesis	21	17	God heard the boy ’ s cries , and God ’ s messenger called to Hagar from heaven and said to her , “ Hagar ! What ’ s wrong ? Don ’ t be afraid . God has heard the boy ’ s cries over there .
CEB	Genesis	21	18	Get up , pick up the boy , and take him by the hand because I will make of him a great nation. ”
CEB	Genesis	21	19	Then God opened her eyes , and she saw a well . She went over , filled the water flask , and gave the boy a drink .
CEB	Genesis	21	20	God remained with the boy ; he grew up , lived in the desert , and became an expert archer .
CEB	Genesis	21	22	At that time Abimelech , and Phicol commander of his forces , said to Abraham , “ God is with you in everything that you do .
CEB	Genesis	21	23	So give me your word under God that you won ’ t cheat me , my children , or my descendants . Just as I have treated you fairly , so you must treat me and the land in which you are an immigrant. ”
CEB	Genesis	21	24	Abraham said , “ I give you my word. ”
CEB	Genesis	21	25	Then Abraham complained to Abimelech about a well that Abimelech ’ s servants had seized .
CEB	Genesis	21	26	Abimelech said , “ I don ’ t know who has done this , and you didn ’ t tell me . I didn ’ t even hear about it until today. ”
CEB	Genesis	21	27	Abraham took flocks and cattle , gave them to Abimelech , and the two of them drew up a treaty . [ c ]
CEB	Genesis	21	28	Abraham set aside , by themselves , seven female lambs from the flock .
CEB	Genesis	21	29	So Abimelech said to Abraham , “ What are these seven lambs you ’ ve set apart ? ”
CEB	Genesis	21	30	Abraham said , “ These seven lambs that you take from me will attest that I dug this well. ”
CEB	Genesis	21	31	Therefore , the name of that place is Beer-sheba [ d ] because there they gave each other their word .
CEB	Genesis	21	32	After they drew up a treaty [ e ] at Beer-sheba , Abimelech , and Phicol commander of his forces , returned to the land of the Philistines .
CEB	Genesis	21	33	Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beer-sheba , and he worshipped there in the name of the Lord , El Olam . [ f ]

CEB	Genesis	22	2	God said , “ Take your son , your only son whom you love , Isaac , and go to the land of Moriah . Offer him up as an entirely burned offering there on one of the mountains that I will show you. ”
CEB	Genesis	22	3	Abraham got up early in the morning , harnessed his donkey , and took two of his young men with him , together with his son Isaac . He split the wood for the entirely burned offering , set out , and went to the place God had described to him .
CEB	Genesis	22	4	On the third day , Abraham looked up and saw the place at a distance .
CEB	Genesis	22	5	Abraham said to his servants , “ Stay here with the donkey . The boy and I will walk up there , worship , and then come back to you. ”
CEB	Genesis	22	6	Abraham took the wood for the entirely burned offering and laid it on his son Isaac . He took the fire and the knife in his hand , and the two of them walked on together .
CEB	Genesis	22	7	Isaac said to his father Abraham , “ My father ? ” Abraham said , “ I ’ m here , my son. ” Isaac said , “ Here is the fire and the wood , but where is the lamb for the entirely burned offering ? ”
CEB	Genesis	22	8	Abraham said , “ The lamb for the entirely burned offering ? God will see to it , [ a ] my son. ” The two of them walked on together .
CEB	Genesis	22	9	They arrived at the place God had described to him . Abraham built an altar there and arranged the wood on it . He tied up his son Isaac and laid him on the altar on top of the wood .
CEB	Genesis	22	10	Then Abraham stretched out his hand and took the knife to kill his son as a sacrifice .
CEB	Genesis	22	11	But the Lord ’ s messenger called out to Abraham from heaven , “ Abraham ? Abraham ? ” Abraham said , “ I ’ m here. ”
CEB	Genesis	22	12	The messenger said , “ Don ’ t stretch out your hand against the young man , and don ’ t do anything to him . I now know that you revere God and didn ’ t hold back your son , your only son , from me. ”
CEB	Genesis	22	13	Abraham looked up and saw a single ram [ b ] caught by its horns in the dense underbrush . Abraham went over , took the ram , and offered it as an entirely burned offering instead of his son .
CEB	Genesis	22	14	Abraham named that place “ the Lord sees. ” [ c ] That is the reason people today say , “ On this mountain the Lord is seen. ” [ d ]
CEB	Genesis	22	15	The Lord ’ s messenger called out to Abraham from heaven a second time
CEB	Genesis	22	16	and said , “ I give my word as the Lord that because you did this and didn ’ t hold back your son , your only son ,
CEB	Genesis	22	17	I will bless you richly and I will give you countless descendants , as many as the stars in the sky and as the grains of sand on the seashore . They will conquer their enemies ’ cities .
CEB	Genesis	22	18	All the nations of the earth will be blessed because of your descendants , because you obeyed me. ”
CEB	Genesis	22	19	After Abraham returned to the young men , they got up and went to Beer-sheba where Abraham lived . Abraham ’ s nephews in Syria
CEB	Genesis	22	20	After these events , Abraham was told : “ Milcah has now also given birth to sons for your brother Nahor .
CEB	Genesis	22	21	They are Uz his oldest son , Buz his brother , Kemuel the father of Aram ,
CEB	Genesis	22	23	Bethuel became the father of Rebekah . These are the eight Milcah bore for Nahor , Abraham ’ s brother .
CEB	Genesis	22	24	His secondary wife ’ s name was Reumah , and she gave birth to Tebah , Gaham , Tahash , and Maacah .

CEB	Genesis	23	23	Sarah lived to be
CEB	Genesis	23	127	years old ; this was how long she lived .
CEB	Genesis	23	2	She died in Kiriath-arba , that is , in Hebron , in the land of Canaan ; and Abraham cried out in grief and wept for Sarah .
CEB	Genesis	23	3	After he got up from embracing his deceased wife , he spoke with the Hittites :
CEB	Genesis	23	4	“ I am an immigrant and a temporary resident with you . Give me some property for a burial plot among you so that I can bury my deceased wife near me. ”
CEB	Genesis	23	5	The Hittites responded to Abraham ,
CEB	Genesis	23	6	“ Listen to us , sir . You are an eminent man of God among us . Bury your dead in one of our own select burial sites . None of us will keep our own burial plots from you to bury your dead. ”
CEB	Genesis	23	7	Abraham rose , bowed to the local citizens the Hittites ,
CEB	Genesis	23	8	and spoke with them : “ If you yourselves allow me to bury my dead near me , listen to me and ask Ephron , Zohar ’ s son ,
CEB	Genesis	23	9	to give me his own cave in Machpelah at the edge of his field . Let him give it to me for the full price , to be witnessed by you , as my own burial property. ”
CEB	Genesis	23	10	Now Ephron was a native Hittite . So Ephron the Hittite responded to Abraham publicly in order that the Hittites and everyone at his city ’ s gate could hear :
CEB	Genesis	23	11	“ No , sir . Listen , I will give you the field , and I will give you the cave in it . In front of my people ’ s witnesses , I will give it to you . Bury your dead ! ”
CEB	Genesis	23	12	Abraham bowed before the local citizens
CEB	Genesis	23	13	and spoke to Ephron publicly in the presence of the local citizens : “ If only you would accept my offer . I will give you the price of the field . Take it from me so that I can bury my dead there. ”
CEB	Genesis	23	14	Ephron responded to Abraham ,
CEB	Genesis	23	15	“ Sir , what is four hundred shekels of silver between me and you for the land so that you can bury your dead ? ”
CEB	Genesis	23	16	Abraham accepted Ephron ’ s offer and weighed out for Ephron the silver he requested publicly before the Hittites : four hundred shekels of silver at the current rate of exchange .
CEB	Genesis	23	17	So the field of Ephron in Machpelah near Mamre—the field and the cave in it , and all the trees within the field ’ s boundaries—was officially transferred
CEB	Genesis	23	18	to Abraham as his property in the presence of the Hittites and of everyone at his city ’ s gate .
CEB	Genesis	23	19	After this , Abraham buried his wife Sarah in the cave in the field of Machpelah near Mamre , that is , Hebron , in the land of Canaan .
CEB	Genesis	23	20	The field and the cave in it were officially transferred from the Hittites to Abraham as his burial property .
CEB	Genesis	24	24	She responded , “ I ’ m the daughter of Bethuel , who is the son of Milcah and Nahor. ”
CEB	Genesis	24	2	Abraham said to the oldest servant of his household , who was in charge of everything he owned , “ Put your hand under my thigh .
CEB	Genesis	24	3	By the Lord , God of heaven and earth , give me your word that you won ’ t choose a wife for my son from the Canaanite women among whom I live .
CEB	Genesis	24	4	Go to my land and my family and find a wife for my son Isaac there. ”
CEB	Genesis	24	5	The servant said to him , “ What if the woman doesn ’ t agree to come back with me to this land ? Shouldn ’ t I take your son back to the land you left ? ”
CEB	Genesis	24	6	Abraham said to him , “ Be sure you don ’ t take my son back there .
CEB	Genesis	24	7	The Lord , God of heaven—who took me from my father ’ s household and from my family ’ s land , who spoke with me and who gave me his word , saying , ‘ I will give this land to your descendants ’ —he will send his messenger in front of you , and you will find a wife for my son there .
CEB	Genesis	24	8	If the woman won ’ t agree to come back with you , you will be free from this obligation to me . Only don ’ t take my son back there. ”
CEB	Genesis	24	9	So the servant put his hand under his master Abraham ’ s thigh and gave him his word about this mission .
CEB	Genesis	24	10	The servant took ten of his master ’ s camels and all of his master ’ s best provisions , set out , and traveled to Nahor ’ s city in Aram-naharaim .
CEB	Genesis	24	11	He had the camels kneel down outside the city at the well in the evening , when women come out to draw water .
CEB	Genesis	24	12	He said , “ Lord , God of my master Abraham , make something good happen for me today and be loyal to my master Abraham .
CEB	Genesis	24	13	I will stand here by the spring while the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water .
CEB	Genesis	24	14	When I say to a young woman , ‘ Hand me your water jar so I can drink , ’ and she says to me , ‘ Drink , and I will give your camels water too , ’ may she be the one you ’ ve selected for your servant Isaac . In this way I will know that you ’ ve been loyal to my master. ”
CEB	Genesis	24	15	Even before he finished speaking , Rebekah—daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah wife of Nahor , Abraham ’ s brother—was coming out with a water jar on her shoulder .
CEB	Genesis	24	16	The young woman was very beautiful , old enough to be married , and hadn ’ t known a man intimately . She went down to the spring , filled her water jar , and came back up .
CEB	Genesis	24	17	The servant ran to meet her and said , “ Give me a little sip of water from your jar. ”
CEB	Genesis	24	18	She said , “ Drink , sir. ” Then she quickly lowered the water jar with her hands and gave him some water to drink .
CEB	Genesis	24	19	When she finished giving him a drink , she said , “ I ’ ll draw some water for your camels too , till they ’ ve had enough to drink. ”
CEB	Genesis	24	20	She emptied her water jar quickly into the watering trough , ran to the well again to draw water , and drew water for all of the camels .
CEB	Genesis	24	21	The man stood gazing at her , wondering silently if the Lord had made his trip successful or not .
CEB	Genesis	24	22	As soon as the camels had finished drinking , the man took out a gold ring , weighing a half shekel , [ a ] and two gold bracelets for her arms , weighing ten shekels .
CEB	Genesis	24	23	He said , “ Please tell me whose daughter you are . Is there room in your father ’ s house for us to spend the night ? ”
CEB	Genesis	24	25	She continued , “ We have plenty of straw and feed for the camels , and a place to spend the night. ”
CEB	Genesis	24	26	The man bowed down and praised the Lord :
CEB	Genesis	24	27	“ Bless the Lord , God of my master Abraham , who hasn ’ t given up his loyalty and his faithfulness to my master . The Lord has shown me the way to the household of my master ’ s brother. ”
CEB	Genesis	24	28	The young woman ran and told her mother ’ s household everything that had happened .
CEB	Genesis	24	29	Rebekah had a brother named Laban , and Laban ran to the man outside by the spring .
CEB	Genesis	24	30	When he had seen the ring and the bracelets on his sister ’ s arms , and when he had heard his sister Rebekah say , “ This is what the man said to me , ” he went to the man , who was still standing by the spring with his camels .
CEB	Genesis	24	31	Laban said , “ Come in , favored one of the Lord ! Why are you standing outside ? I ’ ve prepared the house and a place for the camels. ”
CEB	Genesis	24	32	So the man entered the house . Then Laban unbridled the camels , provided straw and feed for them and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men with him ,
CEB	Genesis	24	33	and set out a meal for him . But the man said , “ I won ’ t eat until I ’ ve said something. ” Laban replied , “ Say it. ”
CEB	Genesis	24	34	The man said , “ I am Abraham ’ s servant .
CEB	Genesis	24	35	The Lord has richly blessed my master , has made him a great man , and has given him flocks , cattle , silver , gold , men servants , women servants , camels , and donkeys .
CEB	Genesis	24	36	My master ’ s wife Sarah gave birth to a son for my master in her old age , and he ’ s given him everything he owns .
CEB	Genesis	24	37	My master made me give him my word : ‘ Don ’ t choose a wife for my son from the Canaanite women , in whose land I ’ m living .
CEB	Genesis	24	38	No , instead , go to my father ’ s household and to my relatives and choose a wife for my son. ’
CEB	Genesis	24	39	I said to my master , ‘ What if the woman won ’ t come back with me ? ’
CEB	Genesis	24	40	He said to me , ‘ The Lord , whom I ’ ve traveled with everywhere , will send his messenger with you and make your trip successful ; and you will choose a wife for my son from my relatives and from my father ’ s household .
CEB	Genesis	24	41	If you go to my relatives , you will be free from your obligation to me . Even if they provide no one for you , you will be free from your obligation to me. ’
CEB	Genesis	24	42	“ Today I arrived at the spring , and I said , ‘ Lord , God of my master Abraham , if you wish to make the trip I ’ m taking successful ,
CEB	Genesis	24	43	when I ’ m standing by the spring and the young woman who comes out to draw water and to whom I say , “ Please give me a little drink of water from your jar , ”
CEB	Genesis	24	44	and she responds to me , “ Drink , and I will draw water for your camels too , ” may she be the woman the Lord has selected for my master ’ s son. ’
CEB	Genesis	24	45	Before I finished saying this to myself , Rebekah came out with her water jar on her shoulder and went down to the spring to draw water . And I said to her , ‘ Please give me something to drink. ’
CEB	Genesis	24	46	She immediately lowered her water jar and said , ‘ Drink , and I will give your camels something to drink too. ’ So I drank and she also gave water to the camels .
CEB	Genesis	24	47	Then I asked her , ‘ Whose daughter are you ? ’ And she said , ‘ The daughter of Bethuel , Nahor ’ s son whom Milcah bore him. ’ I put a ring in her nose and bracelets on her arms .
CEB	Genesis	24	48	I bowed and worshipped the Lord and blessed the Lord , the God of my master Abraham , who led me in the right direction to choose the granddaughter of my master ’ s brother for his son .
CEB	Genesis	24	49	Now if you ’ re loyal and faithful to my master , tell me . If not , tell me so I will know where I stand either way. ”
CEB	Genesis	24	50	Laban and Bethuel both responded , “ This is all the Lord ’ s doing . We have nothing to say about it .
CEB	Genesis	24	51	Here is Rebekah , right in front of you . Take her and go . She will be the wife of your master ’ s son , just as the Lord said. ”
CEB	Genesis	24	52	When Abraham ’ s servant heard what they said , he bowed low before the Lord .
CEB	Genesis	24	53	The servant brought out gold and silver jewelry and clothing and gave them to Rebekah . To her brother and to her mother he gave the finest gifts .
CEB	Genesis	24	54	He and the men with him ate and drank and spent the night . When they got up in the morning , the servant said , “ See me off to my master. ”
CEB	Genesis	24	55	Her brother and mother said , “ Let the young woman stay with us not more than ten days , and after that she may go. ”
CEB	Genesis	24	56	But he said to them , “ Don ’ t delay me . The Lord has made my trip successful . See me off so that I can go to my master. ”
CEB	Genesis	24	57	They said , “ Summon the young woman , and let ’ s ask her opinion. ”
CEB	Genesis	24	58	They called Rebekah and said to her , “ Will you go with this man ? ” She said , “ I will go. ”
CEB	Genesis	24	59	So they sent off their sister Rebekah , her nurse , Abraham ’ s servant , and his men .
CEB	Genesis	24	60	And they blessed Rebekah , saying to her , “ May you , our sister , become thousands of ten thousand ; may your children possess their enemies ’ cities. ”
CEB	Genesis	24	61	Rebekah and her young women got up , mounted the camels , and followed the man . So the servant took Rebekah and left .
CEB	Genesis	24	62	Now Isaac had come from the region of [ b ] Beer-lahai-roi and had settled in the arid southern plain .
CEB	Genesis	24	63	One evening , Isaac went out to inspect the pasture , [ c ] and while staring he saw camels approaching .
CEB	Genesis	24	64	Rebekah stared at Isaac . She got down from the camel
CEB	Genesis	24	65	and said to the servant , “ Who is this man walking through the pasture to meet us ? ” The servant said , “ He ’ s my master. ” So she took her headscarf and covered herself .
CEB	Genesis	24	66	The servant told Isaac everything that had happened .
CEB	Genesis	24	67	Isaac brought Rebekah into his mother Sarah ’ s tent . He received Rebekah as his wife and loved her . So Isaac found comfort after his mother ’ s death .

CEB	Genesis	25	25	The first came out red all over , clothed with hair , and she named him Esau .
CEB	Genesis	25	2	The children she bore him were Zimran , Jokshan , Medan , Midian , Ishbak , and Shuah .
CEB	Genesis	25	3	Jokshan became the father of Sheba and Dedan . Dedan ’ s sons were Asshurim , Letushim , and Leummim .
CEB	Genesis	25	4	Midian ’ s sons were Ephah , Epher , Enoch , Abida , and Eldaah . All of these were Keturah ’ s sons .
CEB	Genesis	25	5	Abraham gave everything he owned to Isaac .
CEB	Genesis	25	6	To the sons of Abraham ’ s secondary wives , Abraham gave gifts and , while he was still living , sent them away from his son Isaac to land in the east . Abraham ’ s death
CEB	Genesis	25	7	Abraham lived to the age of
CEB	Genesis	25	175	.
CEB	Genesis	25	8	Abraham took his last breath and died after a good long life , a content old man , and he was placed with his ancestors .
CEB	Genesis	25	9	His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave in Machpelah , which is in the field of Zohar ’ s son Ephron the Hittite , near Mamre .
CEB	Genesis	25	10	Thus Abraham and his wife Sarah were both buried in the field Abraham had purchased from the Hittites .
CEB	Genesis	25	11	After Abraham ’ s death , God blessed his son Isaac , and Isaac lived in Beer-lahai-roi . Ishmael ’ s descendants
CEB	Genesis	25	12	These are the descendants of Ishmael , Abraham ’ s son , whom Hagar the Egyptian , Sarah ’ s servant , bore for Abraham .
CEB	Genesis	25	13	These are the names of Ishmael ’ s sons , by their names and according to their birth order : Nebaioth , Ishmael ’ s oldest son ; Kedar ; Adbeel ; Mibsam ;
CEB	Genesis	25	14	Mishma ; Dumah ; Massa ;
CEB	Genesis	25	15	Hadad ; Tema ; Jetur ; Naphish ; and Kedemah .
CEB	Genesis	25	16	These are Ishmael ’ s sons . These are their names by their villages and their settlements : twelve tribal leaders according to their tribes .
CEB	Genesis	25	17	Ishmael lived to the age of
CEB	Genesis	25	137	. He took his last breath and died , and was placed with his ancestors .
CEB	Genesis	25	18	He established camps [ a ] from Havilah to Shur , which is near Egypt on the road to Assyria . He died [ b ] among all of his brothers . Jacob and Esau are born
CEB	Genesis	25	19	These are the descendants of Isaac , Abraham ’ s son . Abraham became the father of Isaac .
CEB	Genesis	25	20	Isaac was
CEB	Genesis	25	40	years old when he married Rebekah the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean and the sister of Laban the Aramean , from Paddan-aram .
CEB	Genesis	25	21	Isaac prayed to the Lord for his wife , since she was unable to have children . The Lord was moved by his prayer , and his wife Rebekah became pregnant .
CEB	Genesis	25	22	But the boys pushed against each other inside of her , and she said , “ If this is what it ’ s like , why did it happen to me ? ” [ c ] So she went to ask the Lord .
CEB	Genesis	25	23	And the Lord said to her , “ Two nations are in your womb ; two different peoples will emerge from your body . One people will be stronger than the other ; the older will serve the younger. ”
CEB	Genesis	25	24	When she reached the end of her pregnancy , she discovered that she had twins .
CEB	Genesis	25	26	Immediately afterward , his brother came out gripping Esau ’ s heel , and she named him Jacob . Isaac was
CEB	Genesis	25	60	years old when they were born . Jacob acquires the oldest son ’ s rights
CEB	Genesis	25	27	When the young men grew up , Esau became an outdoorsman who knew how to hunt , and Jacob became a quiet man who stayed at home .
CEB	Genesis	25	28	Isaac loved Esau because he enjoyed eating game , but Rebekah loved Jacob .
CEB	Genesis	25	29	Once when Jacob was boiling stew , Esau came in from the field hungry
CEB	Genesis	25	30	and said to Jacob , “ I ’ m starving ! Let me devour some of this red stuff. ” That ’ s why his name is Edom . [ d ]
CEB	Genesis	25	31	Jacob said , “ Sell me your birthright [ e ] today. ”
CEB	Genesis	25	32	Esau said , “ Since I ’ m going to die anyway , what good is my birthright to me ? ”
CEB	Genesis	25	33	Jacob said , “ Give me your word today. ” And he did . He sold his birthright to Jacob .
CEB	Genesis	25	34	So Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew . He ate , drank , got up , and left , showing just how little he thought of his birthright .

CEB	Genesis	26	26	But Abimelech set out toward him from Gerar , with Ahuzzath his ally and Phicol the commander of his forces .
CEB	Genesis	26	2	The Lord appeared to him and said , “ Don ’ t go down to Egypt but settle temporarily in the land that I will show you .
CEB	Genesis	26	3	Stay in this land as an immigrant , and I will be with you and bless you because I will give all of these lands to you and your descendants . I will keep my word , which I gave to your father Abraham .
CEB	Genesis	26	4	I will give you as many descendants as the stars in the sky , and I will give your descendants all of these lands . All of the nations of the earth will be blessed because of your descendants .
CEB	Genesis	26	5	I will do this because Abraham obeyed me and kept my orders , my commandments , my statutes , and my instructions. ”
CEB	Genesis	26	6	So Isaac lived in Gerar .
CEB	Genesis	26	7	When the men who lived there asked about his wife , he said , “ She ’ s my sister , ” because he was afraid to say , “ my wife , ” thinking , The men who live there will kill me for Rebekah because she ’ s very beautiful .
CEB	Genesis	26	8	After Isaac had lived there for some time , the Philistines ’ King Abimelech looked out his window and saw Isaac laughing together with his wife Rebekah .
CEB	Genesis	26	9	So Abimelech summoned Isaac and said , “ She ’ s your wife , isn ’ t she ? How could you say , ‘ She ’ s my sister ’ ? ” Isaac responded , “ Because I thought that I might be killed because of her. ”
CEB	Genesis	26	10	Abimelech said , “ What are you trying to do to us ? Before long , one of the people would have slept with your wife ; and you would have made us guilty. ”
CEB	Genesis	26	11	Abimelech gave orders to all of the people , “ Anyone who touches this man or his wife will be put to death ! ” Isaac ’ s treaty with the Philistines
CEB	Genesis	26	12	Isaac planted grain in that land and reaped one hundred shearim [ a ] that year because the Lord had blessed him .
CEB	Genesis	26	13	Isaac grew richer and richer until he was extremely wealthy .
CEB	Genesis	26	14	He had livestock , both flocks and cattle , and many servants . As a result , the Philistines envied him .
CEB	Genesis	26	15	The Philistines closed up and filled with dirt all of the wells that his father ’ s servants had dug during his father Abraham ’ s lifetime .
CEB	Genesis	26	16	Abimelech said to Isaac , “ Move away from us because you have become too powerful among us. ”
CEB	Genesis	26	17	So Isaac moved away from there , camped in the valley of Gerar , and lived there .
CEB	Genesis	26	18	Isaac dug out again the wells that were dug during the lifetime of his father Abraham . The Philistines had closed them up after Abraham ’ s death . Isaac gave them the same names his father had given them .
CEB	Genesis	26	19	Isaac ’ s servants dug wells in the valley and found a well there with fresh water .
CEB	Genesis	26	20	Isaac ’ s shepherds argued with Gerar ’ s shepherds , each claiming , “ This is our water. ” So Isaac named the well Esek [ b ] because they quarreled with him .
CEB	Genesis	26	21	They dug another well and argued about it too , so he named it Sitnah . [ c ]
CEB	Genesis	26	22	He left there and dug another well , but they didn ’ t argue about it , so he named it Rehoboth [ d ] and said , “ Now the Lord has made an open space for us and has made us fertile in the land. ”
CEB	Genesis	26	23	Then he went up from Gerar to Beer-sheba .
CEB	Genesis	26	24	The Lord appeared to him that night and said , “ I am the God of your father Abraham . Don ’ t be afraid because I am with you . I will bless you , and I will give you many children for my servant Abraham ’ s sake. ”
CEB	Genesis	26	25	So Isaac built an altar there and worshipped in the Lord ’ s name . Isaac pitched his tent there , and his servants dug a well .
CEB	Genesis	26	27	Isaac said to him , “ Why have you come after me ? You resented me and sent me away from you. ”
CEB	Genesis	26	28	They said , “ We now see that the Lord was with you . We propose that there be a formal agreement between us and that we draw up a treaty [ e ] with you :
CEB	Genesis	26	29	you must not treat us badly since we haven ’ t harmed you and since we have treated you well at all times . Then we will send you away peacefully , for you are now blessed by the Lord. ”
CEB	Genesis	26	30	Isaac prepared a banquet for them , and they ate and drank .
CEB	Genesis	26	31	They got up early in the morning , and they gave each other their word . Isaac sent them off , and they left peacefully .
CEB	Genesis	26	32	That day Isaac ’ s servants informed him about the well that they had been digging and said to him , “ We found water. ”
CEB	Genesis	26	33	He called it Shibah ; [ f ] therefore , the city ’ s name has been Beer-sheba [ g ] until today . Esau ’ s wives
CEB	Genesis	26	34	When Esau was
CEB	Genesis	26	40	years old , he married Judith daughter of Beeri the Hittite , and Basemath daughter of Elon the Hittite .
CEB	Genesis	26	35	They made life very difficult for Isaac and Rebekah .

CEB	Genesis	27	27	So he came close and kissed him . When Isaac smelled the scent of his clothes , he blessed him , “ See , the scent of my son is like the scent of the field that the Lord has blessed .
CEB	Genesis	27	2	He said , “ I ’ m old and don ’ t know when I will die .
CEB	Genesis	27	3	So now , take your hunting gear , your bow and quiver of arrows , go out to the field , and hunt game for me .
CEB	Genesis	27	4	Make me the delicious food that I love and bring it to me so I can eat . Then I can bless you before I die. ”
CEB	Genesis	27	5	Rebekah was listening when Isaac spoke to his son Esau . When Esau went out to the field to hunt game to bring back ,
CEB	Genesis	27	6	Rebekah said to her son Jacob , “ I just heard your father saying to your brother Esau ,
CEB	Genesis	27	7	‘ Bring me some game and make me some delicious food so I can eat , and I will bless you in the Lord ’ s presence before I die. ’
CEB	Genesis	27	8	Now , my son , listen to me , to what I ’ m telling you to do .
CEB	Genesis	27	9	Go to the flock and get me two healthy young goats so I can prepare them as the delicious food your father loves .
CEB	Genesis	27	10	You can bring it to your father , he will eat , and then he will bless you before he dies. ”
CEB	Genesis	27	11	Jacob said to his mother Rebekah , “ My brother Esau is a hairy man , but I have smooth skin .
CEB	Genesis	27	12	What if my father touches me and thinks I ’ m making fun of him ? I will be cursed instead of blessed. ”
CEB	Genesis	27	13	His mother said to him , “ Your curse will be on me , my son . Just listen to me : go and get them for me. ”
CEB	Genesis	27	14	So he went and got them and brought them to his mother , and his mother made the delicious food that his father loved .
CEB	Genesis	27	15	Rebekah took her older son Esau ’ s favorite clothes that were in the house with her , and she put them on her younger son Jacob .
CEB	Genesis	27	16	On his arms and smooth neck she put the hide of young goats ,
CEB	Genesis	27	17	and the delicious food and the bread she had made she put into her son ’ s hands .
CEB	Genesis	27	18	Jacob went to his father and said , “ My father. ” And he said , “ I ’ m here . Who are you , my son ? ”
CEB	Genesis	27	19	Jacob said to his father , “ I ’ m Esau your oldest son . I ’ ve made what you asked me to . Sit up and eat some of the game so you can bless me. ”
CEB	Genesis	27	20	Isaac said to his son , “ How could you find this so quickly , my son ? ” He said , “ The Lord your God led me right to it. ” [ a ]
CEB	Genesis	27	21	Isaac said to Jacob , “ Come here and let me touch you , my son . Are you my son Esau or not ? ”
CEB	Genesis	27	22	So Jacob approached his father Isaac , and Isaac touched him and said , “ The voice is Jacob ’ s voice , but the arms are Esau ’ s arms. ”
CEB	Genesis	27	23	Isaac didn ’ t recognize him because his arms were hairy like Esau ’ s arms , so he blessed him .
CEB	Genesis	27	24	Isaac said , “ Are you really my son Esau ? ” And he said , “ I am. ”
CEB	Genesis	27	25	Isaac said , “ Bring some food here and let me eat some of my son ’ s game so I can bless you. ” Jacob put it before him and he ate , and he brought him wine and he drank .
CEB	Genesis	27	26	His father Isaac said to him , “ Come here and kiss me , my son. ”
CEB	Genesis	27	28	May God give you showers from the sky , olive oil from the earth , plenty of grain and new wine .
CEB	Genesis	27	29	May the nations serve you , may peoples bow down to you . Be the most powerful man among your brothers , and may your mother ’ s sons bow down to you . Those who curse you will be cursed , and those who bless you will be blessed. ” Esau receives a secondary blessing
CEB	Genesis	27	30	After Isaac had finished blessing Jacob , and just as Jacob left his father Isaac , his brother Esau came back from his hunt .
CEB	Genesis	27	31	He too made some delicious food , brought it to his father , and said , “ Let my father sit up and eat from his son ’ s game so that you may bless me. ”
CEB	Genesis	27	32	His father Isaac said to him , “ Who are you ? ” And he said , “ I ’ m your son , your oldest son , Esau. ”
CEB	Genesis	27	33	Isaac was so shocked that he trembled violently . He said , “ Who was the hunter just here with game ? He brought me food , and I ate all of it before you came . I blessed him , and he will stay blessed ! ”
CEB	Genesis	27	34	When Esau heard what his father said , he let out a loud agonizing cry and wept bitterly . He said to his father , “ Bless me ! Me too , my father ! ”
CEB	Genesis	27	35	Isaac said , “ Your brother has already come deceitfully and has taken your blessing. ”
CEB	Genesis	27	36	Esau said , “ Isn ’ t this why he ’ s called Jacob ? He ’ s taken me [ b ] twice now : he took my birthright , and now he ’ s taken my blessing. ” He continued , “ Haven ’ t you saved a blessing for me ? ”
CEB	Genesis	27	37	Isaac replied to Esau , “ I ’ ve already made him more powerful than you , and I ’ ve made all of his brothers his servants . I ’ ve made him strong with grain and wine . What can I do for you , my son ? ”
CEB	Genesis	27	38	Esau said to his father , “ Do you really have only one blessing , Father ? Bless me too , my father ! ” And Esau wept loudly .
CEB	Genesis	27	39	His father Isaac responded and said to him , “ Now , you will make a home far away from the olive groves of the earth , far away from the showers of the sky above .
CEB	Genesis	27	40	You will live by your sword ; you will serve your brother . But when you grow restless , [ c ] you will tear away his harness from your neck. ” Jacob sent away for protection
CEB	Genesis	27	41	Esau was furious at Jacob because his father had blessed him , and Esau said to himself , When the period of mourning for the death of my father is over , I will kill my brother .
CEB	Genesis	27	42	Rebekah was told what her older son Esau was planning , so she summoned her younger son Jacob and said to him , “ Esau your brother is planning revenge . He plans to kill you .
CEB	Genesis	27	43	So now , my son , listen to me : Get up and escape to my brother Laban in Haran .
CEB	Genesis	27	44	Live with him for a short while until your brother ’ s rage subsides ,
CEB	Genesis	27	45	until your brother ’ s anger at you goes away and he forgets what you did to him . Then I will send for you and bring you back from there . Why should I suffer the loss of both of you on one day ? ”
CEB	Genesis	27	46	Rebekah then said to Isaac , “ I really loathe these Hittite women . If Jacob marries one of the Hittite women , like the women of this land , why should I go on living ? ” Footnotes - Genesis 27:20 Or made something good happen for me - Genesis 27:36 Heb ya ’ acob , a wordplay on Jacob - Genesis 27:40 Heb uncertain
CEB	Genesis	28	28	So Isaac summoned Jacob , blessed him , and gave him these orders : “ Don ’ t marry a Canaanite woman .
CEB	Genesis	28	2	Get up and go to Paddan-aram , to the household of Bethuel , your mother ’ s father , and once there , marry one of the daughters of Laban , your mother ’ s brother .
CEB	Genesis	28	3	God Almighty [ a ] will bless you , make you fertile , and give you many descendants so that you will become a large group of peoples .
CEB	Genesis	28	4	He will give you and your descendants Abraham ’ s blessing so that you will own the land in which you are now immigrants , the land God gave to Abraham. ”
CEB	Genesis	28	5	So Isaac sent Jacob off , and he traveled to Paddan-aram , to Laban son of Bethuel the Aramean and brother of Rebekah , Jacob and Esau ’ s mother .
CEB	Genesis	28	6	Esau understood that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him to Paddan-aram to marry a woman from there . He recognized that , when Isaac blessed Jacob , he had ordered him , “ Don ’ t marry a Canaanite woman , ”
CEB	Genesis	28	7	and that Jacob had listened to his father and mother and gone to Paddan-aram .

CEB	Genesis	28	10	Jacob left Beer-sheba and set out for Haran .
CEB	Genesis	28	11	He reached a certain place and spent the night there . When the sun had set , he took one of the stones at that place and put it near his head . Then he lay down there .
CEB	Genesis	28	12	He dreamed and saw a raised staircase , its foundation on earth and its top touching the sky , and God ’ s messengers were ascending and descending on it .
CEB	Genesis	28	13	Suddenly the Lord was standing on it [ b ] and saying , “ I am the Lord , the God of your father Abraham and the God of Isaac . I will give you and your descendants the land on which you are lying .
CEB	Genesis	28	14	Your descendants will become like the dust of the earth ; you will spread out to the west , east , north , and south . Every family of earth will be blessed because of you and your descendants .
CEB	Genesis	28	15	I am with you now , I will protect you everywhere you go , and I will bring you back to this land . I will not leave you until I have done everything that I have promised you. ”
CEB	Genesis	28	16	When Jacob woke from his sleep , he thought to himself , The Lord is definitely in this place , but I didn ’ t know it .
CEB	Genesis	28	17	He was terrified and thought , This sacred place is awesome . It ’ s none other than God ’ s house and the entrance to heaven .
CEB	Genesis	28	18	After Jacob got up early in the morning , he took the stone that he had put near his head , set it up as a sacred pillar , and poured oil on the top of it .
CEB	Genesis	28	19	He named that sacred place Bethel , [ c ] though Luz was the city ’ s original name .
CEB	Genesis	28	20	Jacob made a solemn promise : “ If God is with me and protects me on this trip I ’ m taking , and gives me bread to eat and clothes to wear ,
CEB	Genesis	28	21	and I return safely to my father ’ s household , then the Lord will be my God .
CEB	Genesis	28	22	This stone that I ’ ve set up as a sacred pillar will be God ’ s house , and of everything you give me I will give a tenth back to you. ” Footnotes - Genesis 28:3 Heb El Shaddai or God of the Mountain - Genesis 28:13 Or beside it or beside him - Genesis 28:19 Or God ’ s house
CEB	Genesis	29	29	Laban had given his servant Bilhah to his daughter Rachel as her servant .
CEB	Genesis	29	2	He saw a well in the field in front of him , near which three flocks of sheep were lying down . That well was their source for water because the flocks drank from that well . A huge stone covered the well ’ s opening .
CEB	Genesis	29	3	When all of the flocks were gathered there , the shepherds would roll the stone from the well ’ s opening , water the sheep , and return the stone to its place at the well ’ s opening .
CEB	Genesis	29	4	Jacob said to them , “ Where are you from , my brothers ? ” They said , “ We ’ re from Haran. ”
CEB	Genesis	29	5	Then he said to them , “ Do you know Laban , Nahor ’ s grandson ? ” They said , “ We know him. ”
CEB	Genesis	29	6	He said to them , “ Is he well ? ” They said , “ He ’ s fine . In fact , this is his daughter Rachel now , coming with the flock. ”
CEB	Genesis	29	7	He said to them , “ It ’ s now only the middle of the day . It ’ s not time yet to gather the animals . Water the flock , and then go , put them out to pasture. ”
CEB	Genesis	29	8	They said to him , “ We can ’ t until all the herds are gathered , and then we [ a ] roll the stone away from the well ’ s opening and water the flock. ”
CEB	Genesis	29	9	While he was still talking to them , Rachel came with her father ’ s flock since she was its shepherd .
CEB	Genesis	29	10	When Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his uncle , and the flock of Laban , Jacob came up , rolled the stone from the well ’ s opening , and watered the flock of his uncle Laban .
CEB	Genesis	29	11	Jacob kissed Rachel and wept aloud .
CEB	Genesis	29	12	Jacob told Rachel that he was related to her father and that he was Rebekah ’ s son . She then ran to tell her father .
CEB	Genesis	29	13	When Laban heard about Jacob his sister ’ s son , he ran to meet him . Laban embraced him , kissed him , and invited him into his house , where Jacob recounted to Laban everything that had happened .
CEB	Genesis	29	14	Laban said to him , “ Yes , you are my flesh and blood. ” Jacob marries Leah and Rachel After Jacob had stayed with Laban for a month ,
CEB	Genesis	29	15	Laban said to Jacob , “ You shouldn ’ t have to work for free just because you are my relative . Tell me what you would like to be paid. ”
CEB	Genesis	29	16	Now Laban had two daughters : the older was named Leah and the younger Rachel .
CEB	Genesis	29	17	Leah had delicate eyes , [ b ] but Rachel had a beautiful figure and was good-looking .
CEB	Genesis	29	18	Jacob loved Rachel and said , “ I will work for you for seven years for Rachel , your younger daughter. ”
CEB	Genesis	29	19	Laban said , “ I ’ d rather give her to you than to another man . Stay with me. ”
CEB	Genesis	29	20	Jacob worked for Rachel for seven years , but it seemed like a few days because he loved her .
CEB	Genesis	29	21	Jacob said to Laban , “ The time has come . Give me my wife so that I may sleep with her. ”
CEB	Genesis	29	22	So Laban invited all the people of that place and prepared a banquet .
CEB	Genesis	29	23	However , in the evening , he took his daughter Leah and brought her to Jacob , and he slept with her .
CEB	Genesis	29	24	Laban had given his servant Zilpah to his daughter Leah as her servant .
CEB	Genesis	29	25	In the morning , there she was—Leah ! Jacob said to Laban , “ What have you done to me ? Didn ’ t I work for you to have Rachel ? Why did you betray me ? ”
CEB	Genesis	29	26	Laban said , “ Where we live , we don ’ t give the younger woman before the oldest .
CEB	Genesis	29	27	Complete the celebratory week with this woman . Then I will give [ c ] you this other woman too for your work , if you work for me seven more years. ”
CEB	Genesis	29	28	So that is what Jacob did . He completed the celebratory week with this woman , and then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel as his wife .
CEB	Genesis	29	30	Jacob slept with Rachel , and he loved Rachel more than Leah . He worked for Laban seven more years . Jacob ’ s sons are born
CEB	Genesis	29	31	When the Lord saw that Leah was unloved , he opened her womb ; but Rachel was unable to have children .
CEB	Genesis	29	32	Leah became pregnant and gave birth to a son . She named him Reuben [ d ] because she said , “ The Lord saw my harsh treatment , and now my husband will love me. ”
CEB	Genesis	29	33	She became pregnant again and gave birth to a son . She said , “ The Lord heard that I was unloved , so he gave me this son too , ” and she named him Simeon . [ e ]
CEB	Genesis	29	34	She became pregnant again and gave birth to a son . She said , “ Now , this time my husband will embrace me , [ f ] since I have given birth to three sons for him. ” So she named him Levi . [ g ]
CEB	Genesis	29	35	She became pregnant again and gave birth to a son . She said , “ This time I will praise the Lord. ” So she named him Judah . [ h ] Then she stopped bearing children .

CEB	Genesis	30	30	While in my care , what little you had has multiplied a great deal . The Lord blessed you wherever I took your livestock . [ j ] Now , when will I be able to work for my own household too ? ”
CEB	Genesis	30	2	Jacob was angry at Rachel and said , “ Do you think I ’ m God ? God alone has kept you from giving birth ! ”
CEB	Genesis	30	3	She said , “ Here ’ s my servant Bilhah . Sleep with her , and she will give birth for me . Because of her , I will also have children. ”
CEB	Genesis	30	4	So Rachel gave her servant Bilhah to Jacob as his wife , and he slept with her .
CEB	Genesis	30	5	Bilhah became pregnant and gave birth to a son for Jacob .
CEB	Genesis	30	6	Rachel said , “ God has judged in my favor , heard my voice , and given me a son. ” So she named him Dan . [ a ]
CEB	Genesis	30	7	Rachel ’ s servant Bilhah became pregnant again and gave birth to a second son for Jacob .
CEB	Genesis	30	8	Rachel said , “ I ’ ve competed fiercely with my sister , and now I ’ ve won. ” So she named him Naphtali . [ b ]
CEB	Genesis	30	9	When Leah realized that she had stopped bearing children , she took her servant Zilpah and gave her to Jacob as his wife .
CEB	Genesis	30	10	Leah ’ s servant Zilpah gave birth to a son for Jacob ,
CEB	Genesis	30	11	and Leah said , “ What good luck ! ” So she named him Gad . [ c ]
CEB	Genesis	30	12	Leah ’ s servant Zilpah gave birth to a second son for Jacob ,
CEB	Genesis	30	13	and Leah said , “ I ’ m happy now because women call me happy. ” So she named him Asher . [ d ]
CEB	Genesis	30	14	During the wheat harvest , Reuben found some erotic herbs [ e ] in the field and brought them to his mother Leah . Rachel said to Leah , “ Give me your son ’ s erotic herbs. ”
CEB	Genesis	30	15	Leah replied , “ Isn ’ t it enough that you ’ ve taken my husband ? Now you want to take my son ’ s erotic herbs too ? ” Rachel said , “ For your son ’ s erotic herbs , Jacob [ f ] may sleep with you tonight. ”
CEB	Genesis	30	16	When Jacob came back from the field in the evening , Leah went out to meet him and said , “ You must sleep with me because I ’ ve paid for you with my son ’ s erotic herbs. ” So he slept with her that night .
CEB	Genesis	30	17	God responded to Leah . She became pregnant and gave birth to a fifth son for Jacob .
CEB	Genesis	30	18	Leah said , “ God gave me what I paid for , what I deserved for giving my servant to my husband. ” So she named him Issachar . [ g ]
CEB	Genesis	30	19	Leah became pregnant again and gave birth to a sixth son for Jacob ,
CEB	Genesis	30	20	and she said , “ God has given me a wonderful gift . Now my husband will honor me since I ’ ve borne him six sons. ” So she named him Zebulun . [ h ]
CEB	Genesis	30	21	After this , she gave birth to a daughter and named her Dinah .
CEB	Genesis	30	22	Then God remembered Rachel , responded to her , and let her conceive .
CEB	Genesis	30	23	She became pregnant and gave birth to a son and said , “ God has taken away my shame. ”
CEB	Genesis	30	24	She named him Joseph , [ i ] saying to herself , May the Lord give me another son . God blesses Jacob and Laban
CEB	Genesis	30	25	After Rachel gave birth to Joseph , Jacob said to Laban , “ Send me off so that I can go to my own place and my own country .
CEB	Genesis	30	26	Give me my wives and children whom I ’ ve worked for , and I will go . You know the work I ’ ve done for you. ”
CEB	Genesis	30	27	Laban said to him , “ Do me this favor . I ’ ve discovered by a divine sign that the Lord has blessed me because of you ,
CEB	Genesis	30	28	so name your price and I will pay it. ”
CEB	Genesis	30	29	Jacob said to him , “ You know how I ’ ve worked for you , and how well your livestock have done with me .
CEB	Genesis	30	31	Laban said , “ What will I pay you ? ” Jacob said , “ Don ’ t pay me anything . If you will do this for me , I will take care of your flock again , and keep a portion . [ k ]
CEB	Genesis	30	32	I will go through the entire flock today , taking out all of the speckled and spotted sheep , all of the black male lambs , and all of the spotted and speckled female goats . That will be my price .
CEB	Genesis	30	33	I will be completely honest with you : when you come to check on our agreement , every female goat with me that isn ’ t speckled or spotted and every male lamb with me that isn ’ t black will be considered stolen. ”
CEB	Genesis	30	34	Laban said , “ All right ; let ’ s do it. ”
CEB	Genesis	30	35	However , on that very day Laban took out the striped and spotted male goats and all of the speckled and spotted female goats—any with some white in it—and all of the black male lambs , and gave them to his sons .
CEB	Genesis	30	36	He put a three-day trip between himself and Jacob , while Jacob was watching the rest of Laban ’ s flock .
CEB	Genesis	30	37	Then Jacob took new branches from poplar , almond , and plane trees ; and he peeled white stripes on them , exposing the branches ’ white color .
CEB	Genesis	30	38	He set the branches that he had peeled near the watering troughs so that they were in front of the flock when they drank , because they often mated when they came to drink .
CEB	Genesis	30	39	When the flock mated in front of the branches , they gave birth to striped , speckled , and spotted young .
CEB	Genesis	30	40	Jacob sorted out the lambs , turning the flock to face the striped and black ones in Laban ’ s flock but keeping his flock separate , setting them apart from Laban ’ s flock .
CEB	Genesis	30	41	Whenever the strongest of the flock mated , Jacob put the branches in front of them near the watering troughs so that they mated near the branches .
CEB	Genesis	30	42	But he didn ’ t put branches up for the weakest of the flock . So the weakest became Laban ’ s and the strongest Jacob ’ s .
CEB	Genesis	30	43	The man Jacob became very , very rich : he owned large flocks , female and male servants , camels , and donkeys .

CEB	Genesis	31	31	Jacob responded to Laban , “ I was afraid and convinced myself that you would take your daughters away from me .
CEB	Genesis	31	2	And Jacob saw that Laban no longer liked him as much as he used to .
CEB	Genesis	31	3	Then the Lord said to Jacob , “ Go back to the land of your ancestors and to your relatives , and I will be with you. ”
CEB	Genesis	31	4	So Jacob sent for Rachel and Leah and summoned them into the field where his flock was .
CEB	Genesis	31	5	He said to them , “ I am aware that your father no longer likes me as much as he used to . But my father ’ s God has been with me .
CEB	Genesis	31	6	You know that I ’ ve worked for your father as hard as I could .
CEB	Genesis	31	7	But your father cheated me and changed my payment ten times . Yet God didn ’ t let him harm me .
CEB	Genesis	31	8	If he said , ‘ The speckled ones will be your payment , ’ the whole flock gave birth to speckled young . And if he said , ‘ The striped ones will be your payment , ’ the whole flock gave birth to striped young .
CEB	Genesis	31	9	God took away your father ’ s livestock and gave them to me .
CEB	Genesis	31	10	When the flocks were mating , I looked up and saw in a dream that the male goats that mounted the flock were striped , speckled , and spotted .
CEB	Genesis	31	11	In the dream , God ’ s messenger said to me , ‘ Jacob ! ’ and I said , ‘ I ’ m here. ’
CEB	Genesis	31	12	He said , ‘ Look up and watch all the striped , speckled , and spotted male goats mounting the flock . I ’ ve seen everything that Laban is doing to you .
CEB	Genesis	31	13	I am the God of Bethel , where you anointed a sacred pillar and where you made a solemn promise to me . Now , get up and leave this country and go back to the land of your relatives. ’ ”
CEB	Genesis	31	14	Rachel and Leah answered him , “ Is there any share or inheritance left for us in our father ’ s household ?
CEB	Genesis	31	15	Doesn ’ t he think of us as foreigners since he sold us and has even used up the payment he received for us ?
CEB	Genesis	31	16	All of the wealth God took from our father belongs to us and our children . Now , do everything God told you to do. ”
CEB	Genesis	31	17	So Jacob got up , put his sons and wives on the camels ,
CEB	Genesis	31	18	and set out with all of his livestock and all of his possessions that he had acquired [ a ] in Paddan-aram in order to return to his father Isaac in the land of Canaan .
CEB	Genesis	31	19	Now , while Laban was out shearing his sheep , Rachel stole the household ’ s divine images that belonged to her father .
CEB	Genesis	31	20	Moreover , Jacob deceived Laban the Aramean by not sending word to him that he was leaving .
CEB	Genesis	31	21	So Jacob and his entire household left . He got up , crossed the river , and set out directly for the mountains of Gilead .
CEB	Genesis	31	22	Three days later , Laban found out that Jacob had gone ,
CEB	Genesis	31	23	so Laban took his brothers with him , chased Jacob for seven days , and caught up with him in the mountains of Gilead .
CEB	Genesis	31	24	That night , God appeared to Laban the Aramean in a dream and said , “ Be careful and don ’ t say anything hastily to Jacob one way or the other. ”
CEB	Genesis	31	25	Laban reached Jacob after Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountains . So Laban and his brothers also pitched theirs in the mountains of Gilead .
CEB	Genesis	31	26	Laban said to Jacob , “ What have you done ? You have deceived me and taken off with my daughters as if they were prisoners of war .
CEB	Genesis	31	27	Why did you leave secretly , deceiving me , and not letting me know ? I would ’ ve sent you off with a celebration , with songs and tambourines and harps .
CEB	Genesis	31	28	You didn ’ t even let me kiss my sons and my daughters good-bye . Now you ’ ve acted like a fool ,
CEB	Genesis	31	29	and I have the power to punish you . However , your father ’ s God told me yesterday , ‘ Be careful and don ’ t say anything hastily to Jacob one way or the other. ’
CEB	Genesis	31	30	You ’ ve rushed off now because you missed your father ’ s household so much , but why did you steal my gods ? ”
CEB	Genesis	31	32	Whomever you find with your divine images won ’ t live . Identify whatever I have that is yours , in front of your brothers , and take it. ” Jacob didn ’ t know that Rachel had stolen them .
CEB	Genesis	31	33	Laban went into Jacob ’ s tent , Leah ’ s tent , and her two servants ’ tent and didn ’ t find them . So he left Leah ’ s tent and went into Rachel ’ s .
CEB	Genesis	31	34	Now Rachel had taken the divine images and put them into the camel ’ s saddlebag and sat on them . Laban felt around in the whole tent but couldn ’ t find them .
CEB	Genesis	31	35	Rachel said to her father , “ Sir , don ’ t be angry with me because I can ’ t get up for you ; I ’ m having my period. ” He searched but couldn ’ t find the divine images .
CEB	Genesis	31	36	Jacob was angry and complained to Laban , “ What have I done wrong and what ’ s my crime that you ’ ve tracked me down like this ?
CEB	Genesis	31	37	You ’ ve now felt through all of my baggage , and what have you found from your household ’ s belongings ? Put it in front of our relatives , and let them decide between us .
CEB	Genesis	31	38	For these twenty years I ’ ve been with you , your female sheep and goats haven ’ t miscarried , and I haven ’ t eaten your flock ’ s rams .
CEB	Genesis	31	39	When animals were killed , I didn ’ t bring them to you but took the loss myself . You demanded compensation from me for any animals poached during the day or night .
CEB	Genesis	31	40	The dry heat consumed me during the day , and the frost at night ; I couldn ’ t sleep .
CEB	Genesis	31	41	I ’ ve now spent twenty years in your household . I worked for fourteen years for your two daughters and for six years for your flock , and you changed my pay ten times .
CEB	Genesis	31	42	If the God of my father—the God of Abraham and the awesome one of Isaac—hadn ’ t been with me , you ’ d have no doubt sent me away without anything . God saw my harsh treatment and my hard work and reprimanded you yesterday. ” Jacob and Laban ’ s treaty
CEB	Genesis	31	43	Laban responded and told Jacob , “ The daughters are my daughters , the children are my children , and the flocks are my flocks . Everything you see is mine . But what can I do now about my daughters and about their sons ?
CEB	Genesis	31	44	Come , let ’ s make a treaty , you and me , and let something be our witness. ” [ b ]
CEB	Genesis	31	45	So Jacob took a stone , set it up as a sacred pillar ,
CEB	Genesis	31	46	and said to his relatives , “ Gather stones. ” So they took stones , made a mound , and ate there near the mound .
CEB	Genesis	31	47	Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha , [ c ] but Jacob called it Galeed . [ d ]
CEB	Genesis	31	48	Laban said , “ This mound is our witness today , ” and , therefore , he too named it Galeed .
CEB	Genesis	31	49	He also named it Mizpah , [ e ] because he said , “ The Lord will observe both of us when we are separated from each other .
CEB	Genesis	31	50	If you treat my daughters badly and if you marry other women , though we aren ’ t there , know that God observed our witness. ”
CEB	Genesis	31	51	Laban said to Jacob , “ Here is this mound and here is the sacred pillar that I ’ ve set up for us .
CEB	Genesis	31	52	This mound and the sacred pillar are witnesses that I won ’ t travel beyond this mound and that you won ’ t travel beyond this mound and this pillar to do harm .
CEB	Genesis	31	53	The God of Abraham and the God of Nahor [ f ] will keep order between us. ” So Jacob gave his word in the name of the awesome one of his father Isaac .
CEB	Genesis	31	54	Jacob offered a sacrifice on the mountain , and invited his relatives to a meal . They ate together and spent the night on the mountain .
CEB	Genesis	31	55	[ g ] Laban got up early in the morning , kissed his sons and daughters , blessed them , and left to go back to his own place .

CEB	Genesis	32	2	When Jacob saw them , he said , “ This is God ’ s camp , ” and he named that sacred place Mahanaim . [ a ]
CEB	Genesis	32	3	Jacob sent messengers ahead of him to his brother Esau , toward the land of Seir , the open country of Edom .
CEB	Genesis	32	4	He gave them these orders : “ Say this to my master Esau . This is the message of your servant Jacob : ‘ I ’ ve lived as an immigrant with Laban , where I ’ ve stayed till now .
CEB	Genesis	32	5	I own cattle , donkeys , flocks , men servants , and women servants . I ’ m sending this message to my master now to ask that he [ b ] be kind. ’ ”
CEB	Genesis	32	6	The messengers returned to Jacob and said , “ We went out to your brother Esau , and he ’ s coming to meet you with four hundred men. ”
CEB	Genesis	32	7	Jacob was terrified and felt trapped , so he divided the people with him , and the flocks , cattle , and camels , into two camps .
CEB	Genesis	32	8	He thought , If Esau meets the first camp and attacks it , at least one camp will be left to escape .
CEB	Genesis	32	9	Jacob said , “ Lord , God of my father Abraham , God of my father Isaac , who said to me , ‘ Go back to your country and your relatives , and I ’ ll make sure things go well for you , ’
CEB	Genesis	32	10	I don ’ t deserve how loyal and truthful you ’ ve been to your servant . I went away across the Jordan with just my staff , but now I ’ ve become two camps .
CEB	Genesis	32	11	Save me from my brother Esau ! I ’ m afraid he will come and kill me , the mothers , and their children .
CEB	Genesis	32	12	You were the one who told me , ‘ I will make sure things go well for you , and I will make your descendants like the sand of the sea , so many you won ’ t be able to count them. ’ ”
CEB	Genesis	32	13	Jacob spent that night there . From what he had acquired , he set aside a gift for his brother Esau :
CEB	Genesis	32	14	two hundred female goats and twenty male goats , two hundred ewes and twenty rams ,
CEB	Genesis	32	15	thirty nursing camels with their young , forty cows and ten bulls , and twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys .
CEB	Genesis	32	16	He separated these herds and gave them to his servants . He said to them , “ Go ahead of me and put some distance between each of the herds. ”
CEB	Genesis	32	17	He ordered the first group , “ When my brother Esau meets you and asks you , ‘ Who are you with ? Where are you going ? And whose herds are these in front of you ? ’
CEB	Genesis	32	18	say , ‘ They are your servant Jacob ’ s , a gift sent to my master Esau . And Jacob is actually right behind us. ’ ”
CEB	Genesis	32	19	He also ordered the second group , the third group , and everybody following the herds , “ Say exactly the same thing to Esau when you find him .
CEB	Genesis	32	20	Say also , ‘ Your servant Jacob is right behind us. ’ ” Jacob thought , I may be able to pacify Esau with the gift I ’ m sending ahead . When I meet him , perhaps he will be kind to me .
CEB	Genesis	32	21	So Jacob sent the gift ahead of him , but he spent that night in the camp . Jacob wrestles with God
CEB	Genesis	32	22	Jacob got up during the night , took his two wives , his two women servants , and his eleven sons , and crossed the Jabbok River ’ s shallow water .
CEB	Genesis	32	23	He took them and everything that belonged to him , and he helped them cross the river .
CEB	Genesis	32	24	But Jacob stayed apart by himself , and a man wrestled with him until dawn broke .
CEB	Genesis	32	25	When the man saw that he couldn ’ t defeat Jacob , he grabbed Jacob ’ s thigh and tore a muscle in Jacob ’ s thigh as he wrestled with him .
CEB	Genesis	32	26	The man said , “ Let me go because the dawn is breaking. ” But Jacob said , “ I won ’ t let you go until you bless me. ”
CEB	Genesis	32	27	He said to Jacob , “ What ’ s your name ? ” and he said , “ Jacob. ”
CEB	Genesis	32	28	Then he said , “ Your name won ’ t be Jacob any longer , but Israel , [ c ] because you struggled with God and with men and won. ”
CEB	Genesis	32	29	Jacob also asked and said , “ Tell me your name. ” But he said , “ Why do you ask for my name ? ” and he blessed Jacob there .
CEB	Genesis	32	30	Jacob named the place Peniel , [ d ] “ because I ’ ve seen God face-to-face , and my life has been saved. ”
CEB	Genesis	32	31	The sun rose as Jacob passed Penuel , limping because of his thigh .
CEB	Genesis	33	33	Jacob looked up and saw Esau approaching with four hundred men . Jacob divided the children among Leah , Rachel , and the two women servants .
CEB	Genesis	33	2	He put the servants and their children first , Leah and her children after them , and Rachel and Joseph last .
CEB	Genesis	33	3	He himself went in front of them and bowed to the ground seven times as he was approaching his brother .
CEB	Genesis	33	4	But Esau ran to meet him , threw his arms around his neck , kissed him , and they wept .
CEB	Genesis	33	5	Esau looked up and saw the women and children and said , “ Who are these with you ? ” Jacob said , “ The children that God generously gave your servant. ”
CEB	Genesis	33	6	The women servants and their children came forward and bowed down .
CEB	Genesis	33	7	Then Leah and her servants also came forward and bowed , and afterward Joseph and Rachel came forward and bowed .
CEB	Genesis	33	8	Esau said , “ What ’ s the meaning of this entire group of animals that I met ? ” Jacob said , “ To ask for my master ’ s kindness. ”
CEB	Genesis	33	9	Esau said , “ I already have plenty , my brother . Keep what ’ s yours. ”
CEB	Genesis	33	10	Jacob said , “ No , please , do me the kindness of accepting my gift . Seeing your face is like seeing God ’ s face , since you ’ ve accepted me so warmly .
CEB	Genesis	33	11	Take this present that I ’ ve brought because God has been generous to me , and I have everything I need. ” So Jacob persuaded him , and he took it .
CEB	Genesis	33	12	Esau said , “ Let ’ s break camp and set out , and I ’ ll go with you. ”
CEB	Genesis	33	13	But Jacob said to him , “ My master knows that the children aren ’ t strong and that I am responsible for the nursing flocks and cattle . If I push them hard for even one day , all of the flocks will die .
CEB	Genesis	33	14	My master , go on ahead of your servant , but I ’ ve got to take it easy , going only as fast as the animals in front of me and the children are able to go , until I meet you in Seir. ”
CEB	Genesis	33	15	Esau said , “ Let me leave some of my people with you. ” But Jacob said , “ Why should you do this since my master has already been so kind to me ? ”
CEB	Genesis	33	16	That day Esau returned on the road to Seir ,
CEB	Genesis	33	17	but Jacob traveled to Succoth . He built a house for himself but made temporary shelters for his animals ; therefore , he named the place Succoth . [ a ] Dinah and the conflict at Shechem
CEB	Genesis	33	18	Jacob arrived safely at the city of Shechem in the land of Canaan on his trip from Paddan-aram , and he camped in front of the city .
CEB	Genesis	33	19	He bought the section of the field where he pitched his tent from the sons of Hamor , Shechem ’ s father , for one hundred qesitahs . [ b ]
CEB	Genesis	33	20	Then he set up an altar there and named it El Elohe Israel . [ c ] Footnotes - Genesis 33:17 Or temporary shelters - Genesis 33:19 A monetary weight - Genesis 33:20 Or El , God of Israel
CEB	Genesis	34	34	Dinah , the daughter whom Leah had borne to Jacob , went out to meet the women of that country .
CEB	Genesis	34	2	When Shechem the son of the Hivite Hamor and the country ’ s prince saw her , he took her , slept with her , and humiliated her .
CEB	Genesis	34	3	He was drawn to Dinah , Jacob ’ s daughter . He loved the young woman and tried to win her heart .
CEB	Genesis	34	4	Shechem said to his father Hamor , “ Get this girl for me as my wife. ”
CEB	Genesis	34	5	Now Jacob heard that Shechem defiled his daughter Dinah ; but his sons were with the animals in the countryside , so he decided to keep quiet until they got back .
CEB	Genesis	34	6	Meanwhile , Hamor , Shechem ’ s father , went out to Jacob to speak with him .
CEB	Genesis	34	7	Just then , Jacob ’ s sons got back from the countryside . When they heard what had happened , they were deeply offended and very angry , because Shechem had disgraced Israel by sleeping with Jacob ’ s daughter . Such things are simply not done .
CEB	Genesis	34	8	Hamor said to them , “ My son Shechem ’ s heart is set on your daughter . Please let him marry her .
CEB	Genesis	34	9	Arrange marriages with us : give us your daughters and take our daughters for yourselves .
CEB	Genesis	34	10	Live with us . The land is available to you : settle down , travel through it , and buy property in it. ”
CEB	Genesis	34	11	Shechem said to Dinah ’ s father and brothers , “ If you approve of me , tell me what you want , and I will give it to you .
CEB	Genesis	34	12	Make the bride price and marriage gifts as large as you like , and I will pay whatever you tell me . Then let me marry the young woman. ”
CEB	Genesis	34	13	Jacob ’ s sons responded deviously to Shechem and his father Hamor because Shechem defiled their sister Dinah .
CEB	Genesis	34	14	They said to them , “ We can ’ t do this , allowing our sisters to marry uncircumcised men , because it ’ s disgraceful to us .
CEB	Genesis	34	15	We can only agree to do this if you circumcise every male as we do .
CEB	Genesis	34	16	Then we will give our daughters to you , and we will take your daughters for ourselves . We will live with you and be one people .
CEB	Genesis	34	17	But if you don ’ t listen to us and become circumcised , we will take our daughter and leave. ”
CEB	Genesis	34	18	Their idea seemed like a good one to Hamor and Hamor ’ s son Shechem .
CEB	Genesis	34	19	The young man didn ’ t waste any time doing this because he liked Jacob ’ s daughter so much . He was more respected than anyone else in his father ’ s household .
CEB	Genesis	34	20	Hamor and his son Shechem went to their city ’ s gate and spoke to the men of their city :
CEB	Genesis	34	21	“ These men want peace with us . Let them live in the land and travel through it ; there ’ s plenty of land for them . We will marry their daughters and give them our daughters .
CEB	Genesis	34	22	But the men will agree to live with us and become one people only if we circumcise every male just as they do .
CEB	Genesis	34	23	Their livestock , their property , and all of their animals—won ’ t they be ours ? Let ’ s agree with them and let them live with us. ”
CEB	Genesis	34	24	Everyone at the city gate agreed with Hamor and his son Shechem , so every able-bodied male in the city was circumcised .
CEB	Genesis	34	25	On the third day , when they were still in pain , two of Jacob ’ s sons and Dinah ’ s brothers Simeon and Levi took their swords , came into the city , which suspected nothing , and killed every male .
CEB	Genesis	34	26	They killed Hamor and his son Shechem with their swords , took Dinah from Shechem ’ s household , and left .
CEB	Genesis	34	27	When Jacob ’ s other sons discovered the dead , they looted the city that had defiled their sister .
CEB	Genesis	34	28	They took their flocks , their cattle , and their donkeys , whether in the city or in the fields nearby .
CEB	Genesis	34	29	They carried off their property , their children , and their wives . They looted the entire place .
CEB	Genesis	34	30	Jacob said to Simeon and Levi , “ You ’ ve put me in danger by making me offensive to those who live here in the land , to the Canaanites and the Perizzites . I have only a few men . They may join forces , attack me , and destroy me , me and my household. ”
CEB	Genesis	34	31	They said , “ But didn ’ t he treat our sister like a prostitute ? ”
CEB	Genesis	35	35	God said to Jacob , “ Get up , go to Bethel , and live there . Build an altar there to the God who appeared to you when you ran away from your brother Esau. ”
CEB	Genesis	35	2	Jacob said to his household and to everyone who was with him , “ Get rid of the foreign gods you have with you . Clean yourselves and change your clothes .
CEB	Genesis	35	3	Then let ’ s rise and go up to Bethel so that I can build an altar there to the God who answered me when I was in trouble and who has been with me wherever I ’ ve gone. ”
CEB	Genesis	35	4	So they gave Jacob all of the foreign gods they had , as well as the rings in their ears , and Jacob buried them under the terebinth at Shechem .
CEB	Genesis	35	5	When they set out , God made all of the surrounding cities fearful so that they didn ’ t pursue Jacob ’ s sons .
CEB	Genesis	35	6	Jacob and all of the people with him arrived in Luz , otherwise known as Bethel , in the land of Canaan .
CEB	Genesis	35	7	He built an altar there and named the place El-bethel , [ a ] because God had revealed himself to him there when he ran away from his brother .
CEB	Genesis	35	8	Rebekah ’ s nurse Deborah died and was buried at Bethel under the oak , and Jacob named it Allon-bacuth . [ b ]
CEB	Genesis	35	9	God appeared to Jacob again , while he was on his way back from Paddan-aram , and blessed him .
CEB	Genesis	35	10	God said to him , “ Your name is Jacob , but your name will be Jacob no longer . No , your name will be Israel. ” And he named him Israel .
CEB	Genesis	35	11	God said to him , “ I am El Shaddai . [ c ] Be fertile and multiply . A nation , even a large group of nations , will come from you ; kings will descend from your own children .
CEB	Genesis	35	12	The land I gave to Abraham and to Isaac , I give to you ; and I will give the land to your descendants after you. ”
CEB	Genesis	35	13	Then God ascended , leaving him alone in the place where he spoke to him .
CEB	Genesis	35	14	So Jacob set up a sacred pillar , a stone pillar , at the place God spoke to him . He poured an offering of wine on it and then poured oil over it .
CEB	Genesis	35	15	Jacob named the place Bethel where God spoke to him . Benjamin ’ s birth and Rachel ’ s death
CEB	Genesis	35	16	They left Bethel , and when they were still some distance from Ephrath , Rachel went into hard labor .
CEB	Genesis	35	17	During her difficult labor , the midwife said to her , “ Don ’ t be afraid . You have another son. ”
CEB	Genesis	35	18	As her life faded away , just before she died , she named him Ben-oni , [ d ] but his father named him Benjamin . [ e ]
CEB	Genesis	35	19	Rachel died and was buried near the road to Ephrath , that is , Bethlehem .
CEB	Genesis	35	20	Jacob set up a pillar on her grave . It ’ s the pillar on Rachel ’ s tomb that ’ s still there today .
CEB	Genesis	35	21	Israel continued his trip and pitched his tent farther on near the tower of Eder . Jacob ’ s family
CEB	Genesis	35	22	While Israel stayed in that place , Reuben went and slept with Bilhah his father ’ s secondary wife , and Israel heard about it . Jacob had twelve sons .
CEB	Genesis	35	23	The sons of Leah were Reuben , Jacob ’ s oldest son , and Simeon , Levi , Judah , Issachar , and Zebulun .
CEB	Genesis	35	24	The sons of Rachel were Joseph and Benjamin .
CEB	Genesis	35	25	The sons of Bilhah , Rachel ’ s servant , were Dan and Naphtali .
CEB	Genesis	35	26	The sons of Zilpah , Leah ’ s servant , were Gad and Asher . These were Jacob ’ s sons born to him in Paddan-aram . Isaac ’ s death
CEB	Genesis	35	27	Jacob came to his father Isaac at Mamre , that is , Kiriath-arba . This is Hebron , where Abraham and Isaac lived as immigrants .
CEB	Genesis	35	28	At the age of
CEB	Genesis	35	180	years ,
CEB	Genesis	35	29	Isaac took his last breath and died . He was buried with his ancestors after a long , satisfying life . His sons Esau and Jacob buried him .

CEB	Genesis	37	37	Jacob lived in the land of Canaan where his father was an immigrant .
CEB	Genesis	37	2	This is the account of Jacob ’ s descendants . Joseph was
CEB	Genesis	37	17	The man said , “ They left here . I heard them saying , ‘ Let ’ s go to Dothan. ’ ” So Joseph went after his brothers and found them in Dothan .
CEB	Genesis	37	3	Now Israel loved Joseph more than any of his other sons because he was born when Jacob was old . Jacob had made for him a long [ a ] robe .
CEB	Genesis	37	4	When his brothers saw that their father loved him more than any of his brothers , they hated him and couldn ’ t even talk nicely to him .
CEB	Genesis	37	5	Joseph had a dream and told it to his brothers , which made them hate him even more .
CEB	Genesis	37	6	He said to them , “ Listen to this dream I had .
CEB	Genesis	37	7	When we were binding stalks of grain in the field , my stalk got up and stood upright , while your stalks gathered around it and bowed down to my stalk. ”
CEB	Genesis	37	8	His brothers said to him , “ Will you really be our king and rule over us ? ” So they hated him even more because of the dreams he told them .
CEB	Genesis	37	9	Then Joseph had another dream and described it to his brothers : “ I ’ ve just dreamed again , and this time the sun and the moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me. ”
CEB	Genesis	37	10	When he described it to his father and brothers , his father scolded him and said to him , “ What kind of dreams have you dreamed ? Am I and your mother and your brothers supposed to come and bow down to the ground in front of you ? ”
CEB	Genesis	37	11	His brothers were jealous of him , but his father took careful note of the matter . Joseph ’ s brothers take revenge
CEB	Genesis	37	12	Joseph ’ s brothers went to tend their father ’ s flocks near Shechem .
CEB	Genesis	37	13	Israel said to Joseph , “ Aren ’ t your brothers tending the sheep near Shechem ? Come , I ’ ll send you to them. ” And he said , “ I ’ m ready. ”
CEB	Genesis	37	14	Jacob said to him , “ Go ! Find out how your brothers are and how the flock is , and report back to me. ” So Jacob sent him from the Hebron Valley . When he approached Shechem ,
CEB	Genesis	37	15	a man found him wandering in the field and asked him , “ What are you looking for ? ”
CEB	Genesis	37	16	Joseph said , “ I ’ m looking for my brothers . Tell me , where are they tending the sheep ? ”
CEB	Genesis	37	18	They saw Joseph in the distance before he got close to them , and they plotted to kill him .
CEB	Genesis	37	19	The brothers said to each other , “ Here comes the big dreamer .
CEB	Genesis	37	20	Come on now , let ’ s kill him and throw him into one of the cisterns , and we ’ ll say a wild animal devoured him . Then we will see what becomes of his dreams ! ”
CEB	Genesis	37	21	When Reuben heard what they said , he saved him from them , telling them , “ Let ’ s not take his life. ”
CEB	Genesis	37	22	Reuben said to them , “ Don ’ t spill his blood ! Throw him into this desert cistern , but don ’ t lay a hand on him. ” He intended to save Joseph from them and take him back to his father .
CEB	Genesis	37	23	When Joseph reached his brothers , they stripped off Joseph ’ s long robe ,
CEB	Genesis	37	24	took him , and threw him into the cistern , an empty cistern with no water in it .
CEB	Genesis	37	25	When they sat down to eat , they looked up and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead , with camels carrying sweet resin , medicinal resin , and fragrant resin on their way down to Egypt .
CEB	Genesis	37	26	Judah said to his brothers , “ What do we gain if we kill our brother and hide his blood ?
CEB	Genesis	37	27	Come on , let ’ s sell him to the Ishmaelites . Let ’ s not harm him because he ’ s our brother ; he ’ s family. ” His brothers agreed .
CEB	Genesis	37	28	When some Midianite traders passed by , they pulled Joseph up out of the cistern . They sold him to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver , and they brought Joseph to Egypt .
CEB	Genesis	37	29	When Reuben returned to the cistern and found that Joseph wasn ’ t in it , he tore his clothes .
CEB	Genesis	37	30	Then he returned to his brothers and said , “ The boy ’ s gone ! And I—where can I go now ? ”
CEB	Genesis	37	31	His brothers took Joseph ’ s robe , slaughtered a male goat , and dipped the robe in the blood .
CEB	Genesis	37	32	They took the long robe , brought it to their father , and said , “ We found this . See if it ’ s your son ’ s robe or not. ”
CEB	Genesis	37	33	He recognized it and said , “ It ’ s my son ’ s robe ! A wild animal has devoured him . Joseph must have been torn to pieces ! ”
CEB	Genesis	37	34	Then Jacob tore his clothes , put a simple mourning cloth around his waist , and mourned for his son for many days .
CEB	Genesis	37	35	All of his sons and daughters got up to comfort him , but he refused to be comforted , telling them , “ I ’ ll go to my grave mourning for my son. ” And Joseph ’ s father wept for him .
CEB	Genesis	37	36	Meanwhile the Midianites had sold Joseph to the Egyptians , to Potiphar , Pharaoh ’ s chief officer , commander of the royal guard . Footnotes - Genesis 37:3 LXX many-colored
CEB	Genesis	38	38	At that time , Judah moved away from his brothers and settled near an Adullamite named Hirah .
CEB	Genesis	38	2	There Judah saw the daughter of a Canaanite whose name was Shua , and he married her . After he slept with her ,
CEB	Genesis	38	3	she became pregnant and gave birth to a son , whom she [ a ] named Er .
CEB	Genesis	38	4	She became pregnant again , gave birth to a son , and named him Onan .
CEB	Genesis	38	5	Then she gave birth to one more son and named him Shelah . She was in Chezib when she gave birth to him .
CEB	Genesis	38	6	Judah married his oldest son Er to a woman named Tamar .
CEB	Genesis	38	7	But the Lord considered Judah ’ s oldest son Er immoral , and the Lord put him to death .
CEB	Genesis	38	8	Judah said to Onan , “ Go to your brother ’ s wife , do your duty as her brother-in-law , and provide children for your brother. ”
CEB	Genesis	38	9	Onan knew the children wouldn ’ t be his so when he slept with his brother ’ s wife , he wasted his semen on the ground , so he wouldn ’ t give his brother children .
CEB	Genesis	38	10	The Lord considered what he did as wrong and put him to death too .
CEB	Genesis	38	11	Judah said to Tamar his daughter-in-law , “ Stay as a widow in your father ’ s household until my son Shelah grows up. ” He thought Shelah would die like his brothers had . So Tamar went and lived in her father ’ s household .
CEB	Genesis	38	12	After a long time , Judah ’ s wife the daughter of Shua died . Then , after a period of mourning , he and his neighbor Hirah the Adullamite went up to Timnah , to those who were shearing his sheep .
CEB	Genesis	38	13	Tamar was told , “ Your father-in-law is now on his way up to Timnah to shear his sheep. ”
CEB	Genesis	38	14	So Tamar took off the clothing she wore as a widow , covered herself with a veil , put on makeup , [ b ] and sat down at the entrance to Enaim on the road to Timnah , since she realized that although Shelah had already grown up , she hadn ’ t been given to him as a wife .
CEB	Genesis	38	15	Judah saw her and thought she was a prostitute because she had covered her face .
CEB	Genesis	38	16	He turned to her beside the road and said , “ Let me sleep with you , ” because he didn ’ t know she was his daughter-in-law . She said , “ What will you give me for sleeping with you ? ”
CEB	Genesis	38	17	He said , “ I will give you a kid goat from my flock. ” She said , “ Only if you give me some deposit , as security to guarantee that you will send it. ”
CEB	Genesis	38	18	He said , “ What kind of deposit should I give you ? ” And she said , “ Your seal , its cord , and the staff in your hand. ” He gave these to her , slept with her , and she became pregnant by him .
CEB	Genesis	38	19	Then she got up , left , and took off her veil , dressing once again in the clothing she wore as a widow .
CEB	Genesis	38	20	Judah sent the kid goat with his neighbor Hirah the Adullamite so he could take back the deposits from the woman , but he couldn ’ t find her .
CEB	Genesis	38	21	He asked the locals of that place , “ Where ’ s the consecrated worker [ c ] who was at Enaim on the road ? ” But they said , “ There ’ s no consecrated worker here. ”
CEB	Genesis	38	22	So he went back to Judah and said , “ I couldn ’ t find her . The locals even said , ‘ There ’ s no holy woman here. ’ ”
CEB	Genesis	38	23	Judah said , “ Let her keep everything so we aren ’ t laughed at . I did send this kid goat , but you couldn ’ t find her. ”
CEB	Genesis	38	24	About three months later , Judah was told , “ Your daughter-in-law Tamar has become a prostitute and is now pregnant because of it. ” And Judah said , “ Bring her out so that she may be burned. ”
CEB	Genesis	38	25	When she was brought out , she sent this message to her father-in-law , “ I ’ m pregnant by the man who owns these things . See if you recognize whose seal , cord , and staff these are. ”
CEB	Genesis	38	26	Judah recognized them and said , “ She ’ s more righteous than I am , because I didn ’ t allow her to marry my son Shelah. ” Judah never knew her intimately again .
CEB	Genesis	38	27	When she gave birth , she discovered she had twins in her womb .
CEB	Genesis	38	28	At birth , one boy put out his hand , and the midwife took it and tied a red thread on his hand , saying , “ This one came out first. ”
CEB	Genesis	38	29	As soon as he pulled his hand back , his brother came out , and she said , “ You ’ ve burst out on your own. ” So he was named Perez . [ d ]
CEB	Genesis	38	30	Afterward , his brother with the red thread on his hand came out , and he was named Zerah .

CEB	Genesis	39	39	When Joseph had been taken down to Egypt , Potiphar , Pharaoh ’ s chief officer , the commander of the royal guard and an Egyptian , purchased him from the Ishmaelites who had brought him down there .
CEB	Genesis	39	2	The Lord was with Joseph , and he became a successful man and served in his Egyptian master ’ s household .
CEB	Genesis	39	3	His master saw that the Lord was with him and that the Lord made everything he did successful .
CEB	Genesis	39	4	Potiphar thought highly of Joseph , and Joseph became his assistant ; he appointed Joseph head of his household and put everything he had under Joseph ’ s supervision .
CEB	Genesis	39	5	From the time he appointed Joseph head of his household and of everything he had , the Lord blessed the Egyptian ’ s household because of Joseph . The Lord blessed everything he had , both in the household and in the field .
CEB	Genesis	39	6	So he handed over everything he had to Joseph and didn ’ t pay attention to anything except the food he ate . Now Joseph was well-built and handsome .
CEB	Genesis	39	7	Some time later , his master ’ s wife became attracted to Joseph and said , “ Sleep with me. ”
CEB	Genesis	39	8	He refused and said to his master ’ s wife , “ With me here , my master doesn ’ t pay attention to anything in his household ; he ’ s put everything he has under my supervision .
CEB	Genesis	39	9	No one is greater than I am in this household , and he hasn ’ t denied me anything except you , since you are his wife . How could I do this terrible thing and sin against God ? ”
CEB	Genesis	39	10	Every single day she tried to convince him , but he wouldn ’ t agree to sleep with her or even to be with her .
CEB	Genesis	39	11	One day when Joseph arrived at the house to do his work , none of the household ’ s men were there .
CEB	Genesis	39	12	She grabbed his garment , saying , “ Lie down with me. ” But he left his garment in her hands and ran outside .
CEB	Genesis	39	13	When she realized that he had left his garment in her hands and run outside ,
CEB	Genesis	39	14	she summoned the men of her house and said to them , “ Look , my husband brought us a Hebrew to ridicule us . He came to me to lie down with me , but I screamed .
CEB	Genesis	39	15	When he heard me raise my voice and scream , he left his garment with me and ran outside. ”
CEB	Genesis	39	16	She kept his garment with her until Joseph ’ s master came home ,
CEB	Genesis	39	17	and she told him the same thing : “ The Hebrew slave whom you brought to us , to ridicule me , came to me ;
CEB	Genesis	39	18	but when I raised my voice and screamed , he left his garment with me and ran outside. ”
CEB	Genesis	39	19	When Joseph ’ s master heard the thing that his wife told him , “ This is what your servant did to me , ” he was incensed .
CEB	Genesis	39	20	Joseph ’ s master took him and threw him in jail , the place where the king ’ s prisoners were held . While he was in jail ,
CEB	Genesis	39	21	the Lord was with Joseph and remained loyal to him . He caused the jail ’ s commander to think highly of Joseph .
CEB	Genesis	39	22	The jail ’ s commander put all of the prisoners in the jail under Joseph ’ s supervision , and he was the one who determined everything that happened there .
CEB	Genesis	39	23	The jail ’ s commander paid no attention to anything under Joseph ’ s supervision , because the Lord was with him and made everything he did successful .
CEB	Genesis	40	40	Some time later , both the wine steward and the baker for Egypt ’ s king offended their master , the king of Egypt .
CEB	Genesis	40	2	Pharaoh was angry with his two officers , the chief wine steward and the chief baker ,
CEB	Genesis	40	3	and he put them under arrest with the commander of the royal guard in the same jail where Joseph was imprisoned .
CEB	Genesis	40	4	The commander of the royal guard assigned Joseph to assist them . After they had been under arrest for some time ,
CEB	Genesis	40	5	both of them—the wine steward and the baker for Egypt ’ s king who were imprisoned in the jail—had dreams one night , and each man ’ s dream had its own meaning .
CEB	Genesis	40	6	When Joseph met them in the morning , he saw that they were upset .
CEB	Genesis	40	7	He asked the officers of Pharaoh who were under arrest with him in his master ’ s house , “ Why do you look so distressed today ? ”
CEB	Genesis	40	8	They answered , “ We ’ ve both had dreams , but there ’ s no one to interpret them. ” Joseph said to them , “ Don ’ t interpretations belong to God ? Describe your dreams to me. ”
CEB	Genesis	40	9	The chief wine steward described his dream to Joseph : “ In my dream there was a vine right in front of me ,
CEB	Genesis	40	10	and on the vine were three branches . When it budded , its blossoms appeared , and its clusters ripened into grapes .
CEB	Genesis	40	11	Pharaoh ’ s cup was in my hand , so I took the grapes , crushed them into Pharaoh ’ s cup , and put the cup in Pharaoh ’ s hand. ”
CEB	Genesis	40	12	Joseph said to him , “ This is the dream ’ s interpretation : The three branches are three days .
CEB	Genesis	40	13	After three days , Pharaoh will give you an audience and return you to your position . You will put Pharaoh ’ s cup in his hand , just the way things were before when you were his wine steward .
CEB	Genesis	40	14	But please , remember me when you are doing well and be loyal to me . Put in a good word for me to Pharaoh , so he sets me free from this prison .
CEB	Genesis	40	15	I was stolen from the land of the Hebrews , and here too I ’ ve done nothing to be thrown into this dungeon. ”
CEB	Genesis	40	16	When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was favorable , he said to Joseph , “ It was the same for me . In my dream , there were three baskets of white bread [ a ] on my head .
CEB	Genesis	40	17	In the basket on top there were baked goods for Pharaoh ’ s food , but birds were eating them out of the basket on my head. ”
CEB	Genesis	40	18	Joseph responded , “ This is the dream ’ s interpretation : The three baskets are three days .
CEB	Genesis	40	19	After three days , Pharaoh will give you an audience and will hang you from a tree where birds will peck your flesh from you. ”
CEB	Genesis	40	20	The third day was Pharaoh ’ s birthday , and he gave a party for all of his servants . Before all of his servants , he gave an audience to the chief wine steward and the chief baker .
CEB	Genesis	40	21	He returned the chief wine steward to his position , and he placed the cup in Pharaoh ’ s hand .
CEB	Genesis	40	22	But the chief baker he hanged , just as Joseph had said would happen when he interpreted their dreams for them .
CEB	Genesis	40	23	But the chief wine steward didn ’ t remember Joseph ; he forgot all about him . Footnotes - Genesis 40:16 Heb uncertain
CEB	Genesis	41	41	Pharaoh said to Joseph , “ Know this : I ’ ve given you authority over the entire land of Egypt. ”
CEB	Genesis	41	2	In front of him , seven healthy-looking , fattened cows climbed up out of the Nile and grazed on the reeds .
CEB	Genesis	41	3	Just then , seven other cows , terrible-looking and scrawny , climbed up out of the Nile after them and stood beside them on the bank of the Nile .
CEB	Genesis	41	4	The terrible-looking , scrawny cows devoured the seven healthy-looking , fattened cows . Then Pharaoh woke up .
CEB	Genesis	41	5	He went back to sleep and had a second dream , in which seven ears of grain , full and healthy , grew on a single stalk .
CEB	Genesis	41	6	Just then , seven ears of grain , scrawny and scorched by the east wind , sprouted after them ,
CEB	Genesis	41	7	and the scrawny ears swallowed up the full and well-formed ears . Then Pharaoh woke up and realized it was a dream .
CEB	Genesis	41	8	In the morning , he was disturbed and summoned all of Egypt ’ s religious experts [ a ] and all of its advisors . Pharaoh described his dreams [ b ] to them , but they couldn ’ t interpret them for Pharaoh .
CEB	Genesis	41	9	Then the chief wine steward spoke to Pharaoh : “ Today I ’ ve just remembered my mistake .
CEB	Genesis	41	10	Pharaoh was angry with his servants and put me and the chief baker under arrest with the commander of the royal guard .
CEB	Genesis	41	11	We both dreamed one night , he and I , and each of our dreams had its own interpretation .
CEB	Genesis	41	12	A young Hebrew man , a servant of the commander of the royal guard , was with us . We described our dreams to him , and he interpreted our dreams for us , giving us an interpretation for each dream .
CEB	Genesis	41	13	His interpretations came true exactly : Pharaoh restored me to my position but hanged him. ”
CEB	Genesis	41	14	So Pharaoh summoned Joseph , and they quickly brought him from the dungeon . He shaved , changed clothes , and appeared before Pharaoh .
CEB	Genesis	41	15	Pharaoh said to Joseph , “ I had a dream , but no one could interpret it . Then I heard that when you hear a dream , you can interpret it. ”
CEB	Genesis	41	16	Joseph answered Pharaoh , “ It ’ s not me . God will give Pharaoh a favorable response. ”
CEB	Genesis	41	17	So Pharaoh said to Joseph , “ In my dream I was standing on the bank of the Nile .
CEB	Genesis	41	18	In front of me , seven fattened , stout cows climbed up out of the Nile and grazed on the reeds .
CEB	Genesis	41	19	Just then , seven other cows , weak and frail and thin , climbed up after them . I ’ ve never seen such awful cows in all the land of Egypt .
CEB	Genesis	41	20	Then the thin , frail cows devoured the first seven , fattened cows .
CEB	Genesis	41	21	But after they swallowed them whole , no one would have known it . They looked just as bad as they had before . Then I woke up .
CEB	Genesis	41	22	I went to sleep again [ c ] and saw in my dream seven full and healthy ears of grain growing on one stalk .
CEB	Genesis	41	23	Just then , seven hard and thin ears of grain , scorched by the east wind , sprouted after them ,
CEB	Genesis	41	24	and the thin ears swallowed up the healthy ears . I told the religious experts , [ d ] but they couldn ’ t explain it to me. ”
CEB	Genesis	41	25	Joseph said to Pharaoh , “ Pharaoh has actually had one dream . God has announced to Pharaoh what he is about to do .
CEB	Genesis	41	26	The seven healthy cows are seven years , and the seven healthy ears of grain are seven years . It ’ s actually one dream .
CEB	Genesis	41	27	The seven thin and frail cows , climbing up after them , are seven years . The seven thin ears of grain , scorched by the east wind , are seven years of famine .
CEB	Genesis	41	28	It ’ s just as I told Pharaoh : God has shown Pharaoh what he is about to do .
CEB	Genesis	41	29	Seven years of great abundance are now coming throughout the entire land of Egypt .
CEB	Genesis	41	30	years old when he began to serve Pharaoh , Egypt ’ s king , when he left Pharaoh ’ s court and traveled through the entire land of Egypt .
CEB	Genesis	41	31	No one will remember the abundance in the land because the famine that follows will be so very severe .
CEB	Genesis	41	32	The dream occurred to Pharaoh twice because God has determined to do it , and God will make it happen soon . Joseph ’ s rise to power
CEB	Genesis	41	33	“ Now Pharaoh should find an intelligent , wise man and give him authority over the land of Egypt .
CEB	Genesis	41	34	Then Pharaoh should appoint administrators over the land and take one-fifth of all the produce of the land of Egypt during the seven years of abundance .
CEB	Genesis	41	35	During the good years that are coming , they should collect all such food and store the grain under Pharaoh ’ s control , protecting the food in the cities .
CEB	Genesis	41	36	This food will be reserved for the seven years of famine to follow in the land of Egypt so that the land won ’ t be ravaged by the famine. ”
CEB	Genesis	41	37	This advice seemed wise to Pharaoh and all his servants ,
CEB	Genesis	41	38	and Pharaoh said to his servants , “ Can we find a man with more God-given gifts [ e ] than this one ? ”
CEB	Genesis	41	39	Then Pharaoh said to Joseph , “ Since God has made all this known to you , no one is as intelligent and wise as you are .
CEB	Genesis	41	40	You will be in charge of my kingdom , [ f ] and all my people will obey [ g ] your command . Only as the enthroned king will I be greater than you. ”
CEB	Genesis	41	42	Pharaoh took his signet ring from his hand and put it on Joseph ’ s hand , he dressed him in linen clothes , and he put a gold necklace around his neck .
CEB	Genesis	41	43	He put Joseph on the chariot of his second-in-command , and everyone in front of him cried out , “ Attention ! ” [ h ] So Pharaoh installed him over the entire land of Egypt .
CEB	Genesis	41	44	Pharaoh said to Joseph , “ I am Pharaoh ; no one will do anything or go anywhere in all the land of Egypt without your permission. ”
CEB	Genesis	41	45	Pharaoh renamed Joseph , Zaphenath-paneah , and married him to Asenath , the daughter of Potiphera the priest of Heliopolis . [ i ] Then Joseph assumed control of the land of Egypt .
CEB	Genesis	41	46	Joseph was
CEB	Genesis	41	47	During the seven years of abundance , the land produced plentifully .
CEB	Genesis	41	48	He collected all of the food during the seven years of abundance [ j ] in the land of Egypt , and stored the food in cities . In each city , he stored the food from the fields surrounding it .
CEB	Genesis	41	49	Joseph amassed grain like the sand of the sea . There was so much that he stopped trying to measure it because it was beyond measuring .
CEB	Genesis	41	50	Before the years of famine arrived , Asenath the daughter of Potiphera , priest of Heliopolis , [ k ] gave birth to two sons for Joseph .
CEB	Genesis	41	51	Joseph named the oldest son Manasseh , [ l ] “ because , ” he said , “ God has helped me forget all of my troubles and everyone in my father ’ s household. ”
CEB	Genesis	41	52	He named the second Ephraim , [ m ] “ because , ” he said , “ God has given me children in the land where I ’ ve been treated harshly. ”
CEB	Genesis	41	53	The seven years of abundance in the land of Egypt came to an end ,
CEB	Genesis	41	54	and the seven years of famine began , just as Joseph had said . The famine struck every country , but the entire land of Egypt had bread .
CEB	Genesis	41	55	When the famine ravaged the entire land of Egypt and the people pleaded to Pharaoh for bread , Pharaoh said to all of the Egyptians , “ Go to Joseph . Do whatever he tells you. ”
CEB	Genesis	41	56	The famine covered every part of the land , and Joseph opened all of the granaries [ n ] and sold grain to the Egyptians . In the land of Egypt , the famine became more and more severe .
CEB	Genesis	41	57	Every country came to Egypt to buy grain from Joseph , because in every country the famine had also become more severe .

CEB	Genesis	42	42	When Jacob learned that there was grain in Egypt , he said to his sons , “ Why are you staring blankly at each other ?
CEB	Genesis	42	2	I ’ ve just heard that there ’ s grain in Egypt . Go down there and buy some for us so that we can survive and not starve to death. ”
CEB	Genesis	42	3	So Joseph ’ s ten brothers went down to buy grain in Egypt .
CEB	Genesis	42	4	However , Jacob didn ’ t send Joseph ’ s brother Benjamin along with his brothers because he thought something bad might happen to him .
CEB	Genesis	42	5	Israel ’ s sons came to buy grain with others who also came since the famine had spread to the land of Canaan .
CEB	Genesis	42	6	As for Joseph , he was the land ’ s governor , and he was the one selling grain to all the land ’ s people . When Joseph ’ s brothers arrived , they bowed down to him , their faces to the ground .
CEB	Genesis	42	7	When Joseph saw his brothers , he recognized them , but he acted like he didn ’ t know them . He spoke to them with a harsh tone and said , “ Where have you come from ? ” And they said , “ From the land of Canaan to buy food. ”
CEB	Genesis	42	8	Joseph recognized his brothers , but they didn ’ t recognize him .
CEB	Genesis	42	9	Joseph remembered the dreams he had dreamed about them , and said to them , “ You are spies . You ’ ve come to look for the country ’ s weaknesses. ”
CEB	Genesis	42	10	They said to him , “ No , Master . Your servants have just come to buy food .
CEB	Genesis	42	11	We are all sons of one man . We are honest men . Your servants aren ’ t spies. ”
CEB	Genesis	42	12	He said to them , “ No . You ’ ve come to look for the country ’ s weaknesses. ”
CEB	Genesis	42	13	They said , “ We , your servants , are twelve brothers , sons of one man in the land of Canaan . The youngest is now with our father , but one is gone. ”
CEB	Genesis	42	14	Joseph said to them , “ It ’ s just as I ’ ve said to you . You are spies !
CEB	Genesis	42	15	But here is how to prove yourselves : As Pharaoh lives , you won ’ t leave here until your youngest brother arrives .
CEB	Genesis	42	16	Send one of you to get your brother , but the rest of you will stay in prison . We will find out if your words are true . If not , as Pharaoh lives , you are certainly spies. ” Joseph ’ s brothers return to Canaan
CEB	Genesis	42	17	He put them all in prison for three days .
CEB	Genesis	42	18	On the third day , Joseph said to them , “ Do this and you will live , for I ’ m a God-fearing man .
CEB	Genesis	42	19	If you are honest men , let one of your brothers stay in prison , and the rest of you , go , take grain back to those in your households who are hungry .
CEB	Genesis	42	20	But bring your youngest brother back to me so that your words will prove true and you won ’ t die. ” So they prepared to do this .
CEB	Genesis	42	21	The brothers said to each other , “ We are clearly guilty for what we did to our brother when we saw his life in danger and when he begged us for mercy , but we didn ’ t listen . That ’ s why we ’ re in this danger now. ”
CEB	Genesis	42	22	Reuben responded to them , “ Didn ’ t I tell you , ‘ Don ’ t do anything wrong to the boy ’ ? But you wouldn ’ t listen . So now this is payback for his death. ”
CEB	Genesis	42	23	They didn ’ t know that Joseph was listening to them because they were using an interpreter .
CEB	Genesis	42	24	He stepped away from them and wept . When he returned , he spoke with them again . Then he took Simeon from them and tied him up in front of them .
CEB	Genesis	42	25	Then Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain , to put back each man ’ s silver into his own sack , and to give them provisions for their trip , and it was done .
CEB	Genesis	42	26	They loaded their grain onto their donkeys , and they set out .
CEB	Genesis	42	27	When they stopped to spend the night , one of them opened his sack to feed his donkey , and he saw his silver at the top of his sack .
CEB	Genesis	42	28	He said to his brothers , “ My silver ’ s been returned . It ’ s right here in my sack. ” Their hearts stopped . Terrified , they said to each other , “ What has God done to us ? ”
CEB	Genesis	42	29	When they got back to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan , they described to him everything that had happened to them :
CEB	Genesis	42	30	“ The man , the country ’ s governor , spoke to us with a harsh tone and accused us of being spies in the country .
CEB	Genesis	42	31	We told him , ‘ We ’ re honest men , not spies .
CEB	Genesis	42	32	We are twelve brothers , all our father ’ s sons . One of us is gone , but the youngest is right now with our father in the land of Canaan. ’
CEB	Genesis	42	33	The man , the country ’ s governor , told us , ‘ This is how I will know you are honest men : Leave one of your brothers with me , take grain for those in your households who are hungry , and go .
CEB	Genesis	42	34	But bring back your youngest brother to me . Then I will know that you are not spies but honest men . I will give your brother back to you , and you may travel throughout the country. ’ ”
CEB	Genesis	42	35	When they opened their sacks , each man found a pouch of his silver in his sack . When they and their father saw their pouches of silver , they were afraid .
CEB	Genesis	42	36	Their father Jacob said to them , “ You ’ ve taken my children from me . Joseph ’ s gone . Simeon ’ s gone . And you are taking Benjamin . All this can ’ t really be happening to me ! ”
CEB	Genesis	42	37	Reuben said to his father , “ You may put both of my sons to death if I don ’ t bring him back to you . Make him my responsibility , and I will make sure he returns to you. ”
CEB	Genesis	42	38	But Jacob said to him , “ My son won ’ t go down with you because his brother ’ s dead and he ’ s been left all alone . If anything were to happen to him on the trip you are taking , you would send me—old as I am—to my grave in grief . ”
CEB	Genesis	43	43	The famine was severe in the land ,
CEB	Genesis	43	2	and when they had eaten all the grain that they brought from Egypt , their father said to them , “ Go back and buy us a little food. ”
CEB	Genesis	43	3	Judah said to him , “ The man was absolutely serious when he said , ‘ You may not see me again without your brother with you. ’
CEB	Genesis	43	4	If you agree to send our brother with us , then we will go down and buy you food .
CEB	Genesis	43	5	But if you don ’ t agree to send him , then we can ’ t go down because the man said to us , ‘ You may not see me again without your brother with you. ’ ”
CEB	Genesis	43	6	Israel said , “ Why have you caused me such pain by telling the man you had another brother ? ”
CEB	Genesis	43	7	They said , “ The man asked us pointedly about our family : ‘ Is your father still alive ? Do you have a brother ? ’ So we told him just what we ’ ve said . How were we to know he ’ d say , ‘ Bring your brother down here ’ ? ”
CEB	Genesis	43	8	Judah said to his father Israel , “ Send the young man with me . Let ’ s get ready to leave so that we can stay alive and not die—we , you , and our children .
CEB	Genesis	43	9	I will guarantee his safety ; you can hold me responsible . If I don ’ t bring him back to you and place him here in front of you , it will be my fault forever .
CEB	Genesis	43	10	If we hadn ’ t waited so long , we would ’ ve returned twice by now. ”
CEB	Genesis	43	11	Their father Israel said to them , “ If it has to be , then do this . Take in your bags some of the land ’ s choice produce , and bring it down to the man as a gift : a little medicinal resin , a little honey , gum , resin , pistachios , and almonds .
CEB	Genesis	43	12	Take twice as much silver with you , and take back the silver returned in the top of your sacks . It might have been a mistake .
CEB	Genesis	43	13	And take your brother , get ready , and go back to the man .
CEB	Genesis	43	14	May God Almighty [ a ] make the man compassionate toward you so that he may send back your other brother and Benjamin with you . But me , if I ’ m left childless , then I ’ m left childless. ”
CEB	Genesis	43	15	So the men took this gift . They took twice as much silver with them , together with Benjamin . They left , traveled down to Egypt , and received an audience with Joseph .
CEB	Genesis	43	16	When Joseph saw Benjamin with them , he said to the manager of his household , “ Bring the men to the house and slaughter an animal and prepare it because the men will have dinner with me at noon. ”
CEB	Genesis	43	17	The man did as Joseph told him and brought the men to Joseph ’ s house .
CEB	Genesis	43	18	When they were brought to Joseph ’ s house , the men were frightened and said , “ We ’ ve been brought here because of the silver put back in our sacks on our first trip so he can overpower us , capture us , make slaves of us , and take our donkeys. ”
CEB	Genesis	43	19	They approached the man who was Joseph ’ s household manager and spoke to him at the house ’ s entrance :
CEB	Genesis	43	20	“ Please , Master , we came down the first time just to buy food ,
CEB	Genesis	43	21	but when we stopped to spend the night and opened our sacks , there was the exact amount of each man ’ s silver at the top of his sack . We ’ ve brought it back with us ,
CEB	Genesis	43	22	and we ’ ve brought down with us additional silver to buy food . We don ’ t know who put our silver in our sacks. ”
CEB	Genesis	43	23	He said , “ You are fine . Don ’ t be afraid . Your God and your father ’ s God must have hidden a treasure in your sacks . I received your money. ” Then he brought Simeon out to them .
CEB	Genesis	43	24	The manager brought the men into Joseph ’ s house and gave them water to wash their feet and feed for their donkeys .
CEB	Genesis	43	25	They prepared the gift , anticipating Joseph ’ s arrival at noon , since they had heard that they would have a meal there .
CEB	Genesis	43	26	When Joseph came into the house , they presented him the gift they had brought with them into the house , and they bowed low in front of him .
CEB	Genesis	43	27	He asked them how they were and said , “ How is your elderly father , about whom you spoke ? Is he still alive ? ”
CEB	Genesis	43	28	They said , “ Your servant our father is fine . He ’ s still alive. ” And they bowed down again with deep respect .
CEB	Genesis	43	29	Joseph looked up and saw his brother Benjamin , his own mother ’ s son , and he said , “ Is this your youngest brother whom you told me about ? God be gracious to you , my son. ”
CEB	Genesis	43	30	Joseph ’ s feelings for his brother were so strong he was about to weep , so he rushed to another room and wept there .
CEB	Genesis	43	31	He washed his face , came back , pulled himself together , and said , “ Set out the dinner. ”
CEB	Genesis	43	32	So they set out his food by himself , their food by themselves , and the Egyptians ’ who ate with him by themselves because Egyptians don ’ t allow themselves to eat with Hebrews ; the Egyptians think it beneath their dignity .
CEB	Genesis	43	33	They were seated in front of him from the oldest to the youngest in their exact birth order , and the men looked at each other with amazement .
CEB	Genesis	43	34	Portions of food from Joseph ’ s table were brought to them , but Benjamin ’ s portion was five times as large as theirs . So they drank together and were at ease . Footnotes - Genesis 43:14 Heb El Shaddai or God of the Mountain
CEB	Genesis	44	44	Joseph gave commands to his household manager : “ Fill the men ’ s sacks with as much food as they ’ ll hold , and put each man ’ s silver at the top of his sack .
CEB	Genesis	44	2	Put my cup , the silver cup , on top of the youngest brother ’ s sack , together with the silver for his grain. ” So he did just as Joseph told him to do .
CEB	Genesis	44	3	At dawn , the men and their donkeys were sent off .
CEB	Genesis	44	4	They had left the city but hadn ’ t gone far when Joseph said to his household manager , “ Get ready , go after the men and catch up with them ! Ask them , ‘ Why have you repaid hospitality with ingratitude ? [ a ]
CEB	Genesis	44	5	Isn ’ t this the cup [ b ] my master drinks from and uses to discover God ’ s plans ? [ c ] What you ’ ve done is despicable. ’ ”
CEB	Genesis	44	6	When he caught up to them , he repeated these words .
CEB	Genesis	44	7	They replied , “ Why does my master talk to us like this ? Your servants would never do such a thing .
CEB	Genesis	44	8	The silver that we found at the top of our sacks , we ’ ve just brought back to you from the land of Canaan . We didn ’ t steal silver or gold from your master ’ s house .
CEB	Genesis	44	9	Whoever of your servants is found with it will be put to death , and we ’ ll be my master ’ s slaves. ”
CEB	Genesis	44	10	He said , “ Fine . We ’ ll do just as you ’ ve said . Whoever is found with it will be my slave , and the rest of you will go free. ”
CEB	Genesis	44	11	Everyone quickly lowered their sacks down to the ground and each opened his sack .
CEB	Genesis	44	12	He searched the oldest first and the youngest last , and the cup was found in Benjamin ’ s sack .
CEB	Genesis	44	13	At this , they tore their clothing . Then everyone loaded their donkeys , and they returned to the city .
CEB	Genesis	44	14	When Judah and his brothers arrived at Joseph ’ s house , he was still there , and they fell to the ground in front of him .
CEB	Genesis	44	15	Joseph said to them , “ What ’ s this you ’ ve done ? Didn ’ t you know someone like me can discover God ’ s plans ? ” [ d ]
CEB	Genesis	44	16	Judah replied , “ What can we say to my master ? What words can we use ? How can we prove we are innocent ? God has found your servants guilty . We are now your slaves , all of us , including the one found with the cup. ”
CEB	Genesis	44	17	Joseph said , “ I ’ d never do such a thing . Only the man found with the cup will be my slave . As for the rest of you , you are free to go back to your father. ” Judah appeals for Benjamin
CEB	Genesis	44	18	Judah approached him and said , “ Please , my master , allow your servant to say something to my master without getting angry with your servant since you are like Pharaoh himself .
CEB	Genesis	44	19	My master asked his servants , ‘ Do you have a father or brother ? ’
CEB	Genesis	44	20	And we said to my master , ‘ Yes , we have an elderly father and a young brother , born when he was old . His brother is dead and he ’ s his mother ’ s only child . But his father loves him. ’
CEB	Genesis	44	21	You told your servants , ‘ Bring him down to me so I can see him. ’
CEB	Genesis	44	22	And we said to my master , ‘ The young man can ’ t leave his father . If he leaves , his father will die. ’
CEB	Genesis	44	23	You said to your servants , ‘ If your youngest brother doesn ’ t come down with you , you ’ ll never see my face again. ’
CEB	Genesis	44	24	“ When we went back to my father your servant , we told him what you said .
CEB	Genesis	44	25	Our father told us , ‘ Go back and buy for us a little food. ’
CEB	Genesis	44	26	But we said , ‘ We can ’ t go down . We will go down only if our youngest brother is with us . We won ’ t be able to gain an audience with the man without our youngest brother with us. ’
CEB	Genesis	44	27	Your servant my father said to us , ‘ You know that my wife gave birth to two sons for me .
CEB	Genesis	44	28	One disappeared and I said , “ He must have been torn up by a wild animal , ” and I haven ’ t seen him since .
CEB	Genesis	44	29	And if you take this one from me too , something terrible will happen to him , and you will send me—old as I am—to my grave in despair. ’
CEB	Genesis	44	30	When I now go back to your servant my father without the young man—whose life is so bound up with his—
CEB	Genesis	44	31	and when he sees that the young man isn ’ t with us , [ e ] he will die , and your servants will have sent our father your servant—old as he is—to his grave in grief .
CEB	Genesis	44	32	I , your servant , guaranteed the young man ’ s safety to my father , telling him , ‘ If I don ’ t bring him back to you , it will be my fault forever. ’
CEB	Genesis	44	33	Now , please let your servant stay as your slave instead of the young man so that he can go back with his brothers .
CEB	Genesis	44	34	How can I go back to my father without the young man ? I couldn ’ t bear to see how badly my father would be hurt. ” Footnotes - Genesis 44:4 LXX adds Why have you stolen my silver cup ? - Genesis 44:5 Syr ; MT lacks cup . - Genesis 44:5 Or uses for divination - Genesis 44:15 Or can practice divination - Genesis 44:31 Sam , LXX ; MT lacks with us .
CEB	Genesis	45	45	Joseph could no longer control himself in front of all his attendants , so he declared , “ Everyone , leave now ! ” So no one stayed with him when he revealed his identity to his brothers .
CEB	Genesis	45	2	He wept so loudly that the Egyptians and Pharaoh ’ s household heard him .
CEB	Genesis	45	3	Joseph said to his brothers , “ I ’ m Joseph ! Is my father really still alive ? ” His brothers couldn ’ t respond because they were terrified before him .
CEB	Genesis	45	4	Joseph said to his brothers , “ Come closer to me , ” and they moved closer . He said , “ I ’ m your brother Joseph ! The one you sold to Egypt .
CEB	Genesis	45	5	Now , don ’ t be upset and don ’ t be angry with yourselves that you sold me here . Actually , God sent me before you to save lives .
CEB	Genesis	45	6	We ’ ve already had two years of famine in the land , and there are five years left without planting or harvesting .
CEB	Genesis	45	7	God sent me before you to make sure you ’ d survive [ a ] and to rescue your lives in this amazing way .
CEB	Genesis	45	8	You didn ’ t send me here ; it was God who made me a father to Pharaoh , master of his entire household , and ruler of the whole land of Egypt .
CEB	Genesis	45	9	“ Hurry ! Go back to your father . Tell him this is what your son Joseph says : ‘ God has made me master of all of Egypt . Come down to me . Don ’ t delay .
CEB	Genesis	45	10	You may live in the land of Goshen , so you will be near me , your children , your grandchildren , your flocks , your herds , and everyone with you .
CEB	Genesis	45	11	I will support you there , so you , your household , and everyone with you won ’ t starve , since the famine will still last five years. ’
CEB	Genesis	45	12	You and my brother Benjamin have seen with your own eyes that I ’ m speaking to you .
CEB	Genesis	45	13	Tell my father about my power in Egypt and about everything you ’ ve seen . Hurry and bring my father down here. ”
CEB	Genesis	45	14	He threw his arms around his brother Benjamin ’ s neck and wept , and Benjamin wept on his shoulder .
CEB	Genesis	45	15	He kissed all of his brothers and wept , embracing them . After that , his brothers were finally able to talk to him . Joseph ’ s brothers return for Jacob
CEB	Genesis	45	16	When Pharaoh ’ s household heard the message “ Joseph ’ s brothers have arrived , ” both Pharaoh and his servants were pleased .
CEB	Genesis	45	17	Pharaoh said to Joseph , “ Give your brothers these instructions : Load your pack animals and go back to the land of Canaan .
CEB	Genesis	45	18	Get your father and your households and come back to me . Let me provide you with good things from the land of Egypt so that you may eat the land ’ s best food .
CEB	Genesis	45	19	Give them these instructions too : Take wagons from the land of Egypt for your children and wives , and pick up your father and come back .
CEB	Genesis	45	20	Don ’ t worry about your possessions because you will have good things from the entire land of Egypt. ”
CEB	Genesis	45	21	So Israel ’ s sons did that . Joseph gave them wagons as Pharaoh instructed , and he gave them provisions for the road .
CEB	Genesis	45	22	To all of them he gave a change of clothing , but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of clothing .
CEB	Genesis	45	23	To his father he sent ten male donkeys carrying goods from Egypt , ten female donkeys carrying grain and bread , and rations for his father for the road .
CEB	Genesis	45	24	He sent his brothers off ; and as they were leaving , he told them , “ Don ’ t be worried about the trip. ” [ b ]
CEB	Genesis	45	25	So they left Egypt and returned to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan .
CEB	Genesis	45	26	They announced to him , “ Joseph ’ s still alive ! He ’ s actually ruler of all the land of Egypt ! ” Jacob ’ s heart nearly failed , and he didn ’ t believe them .
CEB	Genesis	45	27	When they told him everything Joseph had said to them , and when he saw the wagons Joseph had sent to carry him , Jacob recovered .
CEB	Genesis	45	28	Then Israel said , “ This is too much ! My son Joseph is still alive ! Let me go and see him before I die. ” Footnotes - Genesis 45:7 Or survive on earth - Genesis 45:24 Or Don ’ t quarrel during the trip .
CEB	Genesis	46	46	Israel packed up everything he owned and traveled to Beer-sheba . There he offered sacrifices to his father Isaac ’ s God .
CEB	Genesis	46	2	persons . Thus , all of the persons in Jacob ’ s household going to Egypt totaled
CEB	Genesis	46	3	He said , “ I am El , [ a ] your father ’ s God . Don ’ t be afraid to go down to Egypt because I will make a great nation of you there .
CEB	Genesis	46	4	I will go down to Egypt with you , and I promise to bring you out again . Joseph will close your eyes when you die. ”
CEB	Genesis	46	5	Then Jacob left Beer-sheba . Israel ’ s sons put their father Jacob , their children , and their wives on the wagons Pharaoh had sent to carry him .
CEB	Genesis	46	6	They took their livestock and their possessions that they had acquired in the land of Canaan , and arrived in Egypt , Jacob and all of his children with him .
CEB	Genesis	46	7	persons .
CEB	Genesis	46	8	These are the names of the Israelites who went to Egypt , including Jacob and his sons . Jacob ’ s oldest son was Reuben .

CEB	Genesis	46	66	persons .
CEB	Genesis	46	27	Joseph ’ s sons born to him in Egypt were
CEB	Genesis	46	70	.
CEB	Genesis	46	28	Israel had sent Judah ahead to Joseph so that Joseph could explain the way to Goshen . Then they arrived in the land of Goshen .
CEB	Genesis	46	29	Joseph hitched up his chariot and went to meet his father Israel in Goshen . When he arrived , he threw his arms around his neck and wept , embracing him for a long time .
CEB	Genesis	46	30	Israel said to Joseph , “ I can die now after seeing your face . You are really still alive ! ” Jacob ’ s household settles in Egypt
CEB	Genesis	46	31	Joseph said to his brothers and to his father ’ s household , “ Let me go up and inform Pharaoh and tell him , ‘ My brothers and my father ’ s household who were in the land of Canaan have arrived .
CEB	Genesis	46	32	The men are shepherds , because they own livestock . They ’ ve brought with them their flocks and herds and everything they own. ’
CEB	Genesis	46	34	say , ‘ Your servants have owned livestock since we were young , both we and our ancestors , ’ so that you will be able to settle in the land of Goshen , since Egyptians think all shepherds are beneath their dignity. ” Footnotes - Genesis 46:3 Or God - Genesis 46:20 Heb On - Genesis 46:23 Or sons
CEB	Genesis	47	47	Joseph went to inform Pharaoh and said , “ My father and brothers with their flocks , herds , and everything they own have come from the land of Canaan and are now in the land of Goshen. ”
CEB	Genesis	47	2	From all of his brothers , he selected five men and presented them before Pharaoh .
CEB	Genesis	47	3	Pharaoh said to Joseph ’ s brothers , “ What do you do ? ” They said to Pharaoh , “ Your servants are shepherds , both we and our ancestors. ”
CEB	Genesis	47	4	They continued , “ We ’ ve come to the land as immigrants because the famine is so severe in the land of Canaan that there are no more pastures for your servants ’ flocks . Please allow your servants to settle in the land of Goshen. ”
CEB	Genesis	47	5	Pharaoh said to Joseph , “ Since your father and brothers have arrived ,
CEB	Genesis	47	6	the land of Egypt is available to you . Settle your father and brothers in the land ’ s best location . Let them live in the land of Goshen . And if you know capable men among them , put them in charge of my own livestock. ”
CEB	Genesis	47	7	Joseph brought his father Jacob and gave him an audience with Pharaoh . Jacob blessed Pharaoh ,
CEB	Genesis	47	8	and Pharaoh said to Jacob , “ How old are you ? ”
CEB	Genesis	47	9	Jacob said to Pharaoh , “ I ’ ve been a traveler for
CEB	Genesis	47	130	years . My years have been few and difficult . They don ’ t come close to the years my ancestors lived during their travels. ”
CEB	Genesis	47	10	Jacob blessed Pharaoh and left Pharaoh ’ s presence .
CEB	Genesis	47	11	Joseph settled his father and brothers and gave them property in the land of Egypt , in the best location in the land of Rameses , just as Pharaoh had ordered .
CEB	Genesis	47	12	Joseph provided food for his father , his brothers , and his father ’ s entire household , in proportion to the number of children . Joseph centralizes power in Egypt
CEB	Genesis	47	13	There was no food in the land because the famine was so severe . The land of Egypt and the land of Canaan dried up from the famine .
CEB	Genesis	47	14	Joseph collected all of the silver to be found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan for the grain , which people came to buy , and he deposited it in Pharaoh ’ s treasury .
CEB	Genesis	47	15	The silver from the land of Egypt and from the land of Canaan had been spent , and all of the Egyptians came to Joseph and said , “ Give us food . Why should we die before your eyes , just because the silver is gone ? ”
CEB	Genesis	47	16	Joseph said , “ Give me your livestock , and I will give you food for your livestock if the silver is gone. ”
CEB	Genesis	47	17	So they brought their livestock to Joseph , and Joseph gave them food for the horses , flocks , cattle , and donkeys . He got them through that year with food in exchange for all of their livestock .
CEB	Genesis	47	18	When that year was over , they came to him the next year and said to him , “ We can ’ t hide from my master that the silver is spent and that we ’ ve given the livestock to my master . All that ’ s left for my master is our corpses and our farmland .
CEB	Genesis	47	19	Why should we die before your eyes , we and our farmland too ? Buy us and our farms for food , and we and our farms will be under Pharaoh ’ s control . Give us seed so that we can stay alive and not die , and so that our farmland won ’ t become unproductive. ”
CEB	Genesis	47	20	So Joseph bought all of Egypt ’ s farmland for Pharaoh because every Egyptian sold his field when the famine worsened . So the land became Pharaoh ’ s .
CEB	Genesis	47	21	He moved the people to the cities [ a ] from one end of Egypt to the other .
CEB	Genesis	47	22	However , he didn ’ t buy the farmland of the priests because Pharaoh allowed the priests a subsidy , and they were able to eat from the subsidy Pharaoh gave them . Therefore , they didn ’ t have to sell their farmland .
CEB	Genesis	47	23	Joseph said to the people , “ Since I ’ ve now purchased you and your farmland for Pharaoh , here ’ s seed for you . Plant the seed on the land .
CEB	Genesis	47	24	When the crop comes in , you must give one-fifth to Pharaoh . You may keep four-fifths for yourselves , for planting fields , and for feeding yourselves , those in your households , and your children. ”
CEB	Genesis	47	25	The people said , “ You ’ ve saved our lives . If you wish , we will be Pharaoh ’ s slaves. ”
CEB	Genesis	47	26	So Joseph made a law that still exists today : Pharaoh receives one-fifth from Egypt ’ s farmland . Only the priests ’ farmland didn ’ t become Pharaoh ’ s . Jacob blesses Ephraim and Manasseh
CEB	Genesis	47	27	Israel lived in the land of Egypt , in the land of Goshen . They settled in it , had many children , and became numerous .
CEB	Genesis	47	28	After Jacob had lived in the land of Egypt for seventeen years , and after he had lived a total of
CEB	Genesis	47	147	years ,
CEB	Genesis	47	29	Israel ’ s death approached . He summoned his son Joseph and said to him , “ If you would be so kind , lay your hand under my thigh , and be loyal and true to me . Don ’ t bury me in Egypt .
CEB	Genesis	47	30	When I lie down with my fathers , carry me from Egypt and bury me in their grave. ” Joseph said , “ I will do just as you say. ”
CEB	Genesis	47	31	Israel said , “ Give me your word ! ” and Joseph gave his word . Then Israel slumped down at the head of the bed . Footnotes - Genesis 47:21 Sam , LXX he made the people slaves
CEB	Genesis	48	48	After this happened , Joseph was told , [ a ] “ Your father is getting weaker , ” so he took his two sons Manasseh and Ephraim with him .
CEB	Genesis	48	2	When Jacob was informed , [ b ] “ Your son Joseph is here now , ” he [ c ] pulled himself together and sat up in bed .
CEB	Genesis	48	3	Jacob said to Joseph , “ God Almighty [ d ] appeared to me in Luz in the land of Canaan . He blessed me
CEB	Genesis	48	4	and said to me , ‘ I am about to give you many children , to increase your numbers , and to make you a large group of peoples . I will give this land to your descendants following you as an enduring possession. ’
CEB	Genesis	48	5	Now , your two sons born to you in the land of Egypt before I arrived in Egypt are my own . Ephraim and Manasseh are just like Reuben and Simeon to me .
CEB	Genesis	48	6	Your family who is born to you after them are yours , but their inheritance will be determined under their brothers ’ names .
CEB	Genesis	48	7	When I came back from Paddan-aram , [ e ] Rachel died , to my sorrow , on the road in the land of Canaan , with some distance yet to go to Ephrathah , so I buried her there near the road to Ephrathah , [ f ] which is Bethlehem. ”
CEB	Genesis	48	8	When Israel saw Joseph ’ s sons , he said , “ Who are these ? ”
CEB	Genesis	48	9	Joseph told his father , “ They ’ re my sons , whom God gave me here. ” Israel said , “ Bring them to me and I will bless them. ”
CEB	Genesis	48	10	Because Israel ’ s eyesight had failed from old age and he wasn ’ t able to see , Joseph brought them close to him , and he kissed and embraced them .
CEB	Genesis	48	11	Israel said to Joseph , “ I didn ’ t expect I ’ d see your face , but now God has shown me your children too. ”
CEB	Genesis	48	12	Then Joseph took them from Israel ’ s knees , and he bowed low with his face to the ground .
CEB	Genesis	48	13	Joseph took both of them , Ephraim in his right hand at Israel ’ s left hand , and Manasseh in his left hand at Israel ’ s right hand , and brought them close to him .
CEB	Genesis	48	14	But Israel put out his right hand and placed it on the head of Ephraim , the younger one , and his left hand on Manasseh ’ s head , crossing his hands because Manasseh was the oldest son .
CEB	Genesis	48	15	He blessed them [ g ] and said , “ May the God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked , may the God who was my shepherd from the beginning until this day ,
CEB	Genesis	48	16	may the divine messenger who protected me from all harm , bless the young men . Through them may my name be kept alive and the names of my fathers Abraham and Isaac . May they grow into a great multitude throughout the land. ”
CEB	Genesis	48	17	When Joseph saw that his father had placed his right hand on Ephraim ’ s head , he was upset and grasped his father ’ s hand to move it from Ephraim ’ s head to Manasseh ’ s head .
CEB	Genesis	48	18	Joseph said to his father , “ No , my father ! This is the oldest son . Put your right hand on his head. ”
CEB	Genesis	48	19	But his father refused and said , “ I know , my son , I know . He ’ ll become a people too , and he ’ ll also be great . But his younger brother will be greater than he will , and his descendants will become many nations. ”
CEB	Genesis	48	20	Israel blessed them that day , saying , “ Through you , Israel will pronounce blessings , saying , ‘ May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh. ’ ” So Israel put Ephraim before Manasseh .
CEB	Genesis	48	21	Then Israel said to Joseph , “ I ’ m about to die . God will be with you and return you to the land of your fathers .
CEB	Genesis	48	22	I ’ m giving you one portion more than to your brothers , [ h ] a portion that I took from the Amorites with my sword and my bow. ” Footnotes - Genesis 48:1 LXX , Syr , Tg , Vulg ; MT he told - Genesis 48:2 LXX ; MT he informed - Genesis 48:2 Heb Israel - Genesis 48:3 Heb El Shaddai or God of the Mountain - Genesis 48:7 Sam , LXX , Syr ; MT lacks aram . - Genesis 48:7 Sam ; MT Ephrath - Genesis 48:15 LXX ; MT Joseph - Genesis 48:22 Heb uncertain
CEB	Genesis	49	49	Jacob summoned his sons and said , “ Gather around so that I can tell you what will happen to you in the coming days .
CEB	Genesis	49	2	Assemble yourselves and listen , sons of Jacob ; listen to Israel your father .
CEB	Genesis	49	3	Reuben , you are my oldest son , my strength and my first contender , [ a ] superior in status and superior in might .

CEB	Genesis	49	8	Judah , you are the one your brothers will honor ; your hand will be on the neck of your enemies ; your father ’ s sons will bow down to you .

CEB	Genesis	50	50	Joseph fell across his father ’ s body , wept over him , and kissed him .
CEB	Genesis	50	2	Joseph then ordered the physicians in his service to embalm his father , and the physicians embalmed Israel .
CEB	Genesis	50	3	They mourned for him forty days because that is the period required for embalming . Then the Egyptians mourned him for seventy days .
CEB	Genesis	50	4	After the period of mourning had passed , Joseph spoke to Pharaoh ’ s household : “ If you approve my request , give Pharaoh this message :
CEB	Genesis	50	5	My father made me promise , telling me , ‘ I ’ m about to die . You must bury me in the tomb I dug for myself in the land of Canaan. ’ Now , let me leave and let me bury my father , and then I will return. ”
CEB	Genesis	50	6	Pharaoh replied , “ Go , bury your father as you promised. ”

CEB	Genesis	50	8	Joseph ’ s entire household , his brothers , and his father ’ s household . Only the children , flocks , and cattle remained in the land of Goshen .

CEB	Genesis	50	11	When the Canaanites who lived in the land saw the observance of grief on Atad ’ s threshing floor , they said , “ This is a solemn observance of grief by the Egyptians. ” Therefore , its name is Abel-mizraim . [ a ] It is on the other side of the Jordan River .
CEB	Genesis	50	12	Israel ’ s sons did for him just as he had ordered .
CEB	Genesis	50	13	His sons carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave in the field of Machpelah near Mamre , which Abraham had purchased as burial property from Ephron the Hittite .
CEB	Genesis	50	14	Then [ b ] Joseph returned to Egypt , he , his brothers , and everyone who left with him to bury his father . Joseph and his brothers in Egypt
CEB	Genesis	50	15	When Joseph ’ s brothers realized that their father was now dead , they said , “ What if Joseph bears a grudge against us , and wants to pay us back seriously for all of the terrible things we did to him ? ”
CEB	Genesis	50	16	So they approached [ c ] Joseph and said , “ Your father gave orders before he died , telling us ,
CEB	Genesis	50	17	‘ This is what you should say to Joseph . “ Please , forgive your brothers ’ sins and misdeeds , for they did terrible things to you . Now , please forgive the sins of the servants of your father ’ s God. ” ’ ” Joseph wept when they spoke to him .
CEB	Genesis	50	18	His brothers wept [ d ] too , fell down in front of him , and said , “ We ’ re here as your slaves. ”
CEB	Genesis	50	19	But Joseph said to them , “ Don ’ t be afraid . Am I God ?
CEB	Genesis	50	20	You planned something bad for me , but God produced something good from it , in order to save the lives of many people , just as he ’ s doing today .
CEB	Genesis	50	21	Now , don ’ t be afraid . I will take care of you and your children. ” So he put them at ease and spoke reassuringly to them .
CEB	Genesis	50	22	Thus Joseph lived in Egypt , he and his father ’ s household . Joseph lived
CEB	Genesis	50	110	years old . They embalmed him and placed him in a coffin in Egypt . Footnotes - Genesis 50:11 Or the Egyptians ’ observance of grief - Genesis 50:14 LXX ; MT includes after he buried his father . - Genesis 50:16 LXX , Syr ; MT they commanded - Genesis 50:18 Or came
CEB	Genesis	50	23	and saw Ephraim ’ s grandchildren . The children of Machir , Manasseh ’ s son , were also born on Joseph ’ s knees .
CEB	Genesis	50	24	Joseph said to his brothers , “ I ’ m about to die . God will certainly take care of you and bring you out of this land to the land he promised to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob. ”
CEB	Genesis	50	25	Joseph made Israel ’ s sons promise , “ When God takes care of you , you must bring up my bones out of here. ”
CEB	Genesis	50	26	Joseph died when he was
CEB	Exodus	1	1	These are the names of the Israelites who came to Egypt with Jacob along with their households :
CEB	Exodus	1	2	Reuben , Simeon , Levi , and Judah ,
CEB	Exodus	1	3	Issachar , Zebulun , and Benjamin ,
CEB	Exodus	1	4	Dan and Naphtali , Gad and Asher .
CEB	Exodus	1	5	The total number in Jacob ’ s family was seventy . Joseph was already in Egypt .
CEB	Exodus	1	6	Eventually , Joseph , his brothers , and everyone in his generation died .
CEB	Exodus	1	7	But the Israelites were fertile and became populous . They multiplied and grew dramatically , filling the whole land . Israel is oppressed
CEB	Exodus	1	8	Now a new king came to power in Egypt who didn ’ t know Joseph .
CEB	Exodus	1	9	He said to his people , “ The Israelite people are now larger in number and stronger than we are .
CEB	Exodus	1	10	Come on , let ’ s be smart and deal with them . Otherwise , they will only grow in number . And if war breaks out , they will join our enemies , fight against us , and then escape from the land. ”
CEB	Exodus	1	11	As a result , the Egyptians put foremen of forced work gangs over the Israelites to harass them with hard work . They had to build storage cities named Pithom and Rameses for Pharaoh .
CEB	Exodus	1	12	But the more they were oppressed , the more they grew and spread , so much so that the Egyptians started to look at the Israelites with disgust and dread .
CEB	Exodus	1	13	So the Egyptians enslaved the Israelites .
CEB	Exodus	1	14	They made their lives miserable with hard labor , making mortar and bricks , doing field work , and by forcing them to do all kinds of other cruel work .
CEB	Exodus	1	15	The king of Egypt spoke to two Hebrew midwives named Shiphrah and Puah :
CEB	Exodus	1	16	“ When you are helping the Hebrew women give birth and you see the baby being born , if it ’ s a boy , kill him . But if it ’ s a girl , you can let her live. ”
CEB	Exodus	1	17	Now the two midwives respected God so they didn ’ t obey the Egyptian king ’ s order . Instead , they let the baby boys live .
CEB	Exodus	1	18	So the king of Egypt called the two midwives and said to them , “ Why are you doing this ? Why are you letting the baby boys live ? ”
CEB	Exodus	1	19	The two midwives said to Pharaoh , “ Because Hebrew women aren ’ t like Egyptian women . They ’ re much stronger and give birth before any midwives can get to them. ”
CEB	Exodus	1	20	So God treated the midwives well , and the people kept on multiplying and became very strong .
CEB	Exodus	1	21	And because the midwives respected God , God gave them households of their own .
CEB	Exodus	1	22	Then Pharaoh gave an order to all his people : “ Throw every baby boy born to the Hebrews into the Nile River , but you can let all the girls live . ”
CEB	Exodus	2	2	The woman became pregnant and gave birth to a son . She saw that the baby was healthy and beautiful , so she hid him for three months .
CEB	Exodus	2	3	When she couldn ’ t hide him any longer , she took a reed basket and sealed it up with black tar . She put the child in the basket and set the basket among the reeds at the riverbank .
CEB	Exodus	2	4	The baby ’ s older sister stood watch nearby to see what would happen to him .
CEB	Exodus	2	5	Pharaoh ’ s daughter came down to bathe in the river , while her women servants walked along beside the river . She saw the basket among the reeds , and she sent one of her servants to bring it to her .
CEB	Exodus	2	6	When she opened it , she saw the child . The boy was crying , and she felt sorry for him . She said , “ This must be one of the Hebrews ’ children. ”
CEB	Exodus	2	7	Then the baby ’ s sister said to Pharaoh ’ s daughter , “ Would you like me to go and find one of the Hebrew women to nurse the child for you ? ”
CEB	Exodus	2	8	Pharaoh ’ s daughter agreed , “ Yes , do that. ” So the girl went and called the child ’ s mother .
CEB	Exodus	2	9	Pharaoh ’ s daughter said to her , “ Take this child and nurse it for me , and I ’ ll pay you for your work. ” So the woman took the child and nursed it .
CEB	Exodus	2	10	After the child had grown up , she brought him back to Pharaoh ’ s daughter , who adopted him as her son . She named him Moses , “ because , ” she said , “ I pulled him out [ a ] of the water. ” Moses runs away to Midian
CEB	Exodus	2	11	One day after Moses had become an adult , he went out among his people and he saw their forced labor . He saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew , one of his own people .
CEB	Exodus	2	12	He looked around to make sure no one else was there . Then he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand .
CEB	Exodus	2	13	When Moses went out the next day , he saw two Hebrew men fighting with each other . Moses said to the one who had started the fight , “ Why are you abusing your fellow Hebrew ? ”
CEB	Exodus	2	14	He replied , “ Who made you a boss or judge over us ? Are you planning to kill me like you killed the Egyptian ? ” Then Moses was afraid when he realized : They obviously know what I did .
CEB	Exodus	2	15	When Pharaoh heard about it , he tried to kill Moses . But Moses ran away from Pharaoh and settled down in the land of Midian . One day Moses was sitting by a well .
CEB	Exodus	2	16	Now there was a Midianite priest who had seven daughters . The daughters came to draw water and fill the troughs so that their father ’ s flock could drink .
CEB	Exodus	2	17	But some shepherds came along and rudely chased them away . Moses got up , rescued the women , and gave their flock water to drink .
CEB	Exodus	2	18	When they went back home to their father Reuel , [ b ] he asked , “ How were you able to come back home so soon today ? ”
CEB	Exodus	2	19	They replied , “ An Egyptian man rescued us from a bunch of shepherds . Afterward , he even helped us draw water to let the flock drink. ”
CEB	Exodus	2	20	Reuel said to his daughters , “ So where is he ? Why did you leave this man ? Invite him to eat a meal with us. ”
CEB	Exodus	2	21	Moses agreed to come and live with the man , who gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses as his wife .
CEB	Exodus	2	22	She gave birth to a son , and Moses named him Gershom , “ because , ” he said , “ I ’ ve been an immigrant [ c ] living in a foreign land. ”
CEB	Exodus	2	23	A long time passed , and the Egyptian king died . The Israelites were still groaning because of their hard work . They cried out , and their cry to be rescued from the hard work rose up to God .
CEB	Exodus	2	24	God heard their cry of grief , and God remembered his covenant with Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob .
CEB	Exodus	2	25	God looked at the Israelites , and God understood . Footnotes - Exodus 2:10 Heb mashah sounds like Moses ( moshe ) . - Exodus 2:18 Also called Jethro - Exodus 2:22 Heb ger sounds like Gershom .
CEB	Exodus	3	3	Then Moses said to himself , Let me check out this amazing sight and find out why the bush isn ’ t burning up .
CEB	Exodus	3	2	The Lord ’ s messenger appeared to him in a flame of fire in the middle of a bush . Moses saw that the bush was in flames , but it didn ’ t burn up .
CEB	Exodus	3	4	When the Lord saw that he was coming to look , God called to him out of the bush , “ Moses , Moses ! ” Moses said , “ I ’ m here. ”
CEB	Exodus	3	5	Then the Lord said , “ Don ’ t come any closer ! Take off your sandals , because you are standing on holy ground. ”
CEB	Exodus	3	6	He continued , “ I am the God of your father , Abraham ’ s God , Isaac ’ s God , and Jacob ’ s God. ” Moses hid his face because he was afraid to look at God .
CEB	Exodus	3	7	Then the Lord said , “ I ’ ve clearly seen my people oppressed in Egypt . I ’ ve heard their cry of injustice because of their slave masters . I know about their pain .
CEB	Exodus	3	8	I ’ ve come down to rescue them from the Egyptians in order to take them out of that land and bring them to a good and broad land , a land that ’ s full of milk and honey , a place where the Canaanites , the Hittites , the Amorites , the Perizzites , the Hivites , and the Jebusites all live .
CEB	Exodus	3	9	Now the Israelites ’ cries of injustice have reached me . I ’ ve seen just how much the Egyptians have oppressed them .
CEB	Exodus	3	10	So get going . I ’ m sending you to Pharaoh to bring my people , the Israelites , out of Egypt. ”
CEB	Exodus	3	11	But Moses said to God , “ Who am I to go to Pharaoh and to bring the Israelites out of Egypt ? ”
CEB	Exodus	3	12	God said , “ I ’ ll be with you . And this will show you that I ’ m the one who sent you . After you bring the people out of Egypt , you will come back here and worship God on this mountain. ” God ’ s special name
CEB	Exodus	3	13	But Moses said to God , “ If I now come to the Israelites and say to them , ‘ The God of your ancestors has sent me to you , ’ they are going to ask me , ‘ What ’ s this God ’ s name ? ’ What am I supposed to say to them ? ”
CEB	Exodus	3	14	God said to Moses , “ I Am Who I Am . [ b ] So say to the Israelites , ‘ I Am has sent me to you. ’ ”
CEB	Exodus	3	15	God continued , “ Say to the Israelites , ‘ The Lord , the God of your ancestors , Abraham ’ s God , Isaac ’ s God , and Jacob ’ s God , has sent me to you. ’ This is my name forever ; this is how all generations will remember me .
CEB	Exodus	3	16	“ Go and get Israel ’ s elders together and say to them , ‘ The Lord , the God of your ancestors , the God of Abraham , of Isaac , and of Jacob , has appeared to me . The Lord said , “ I ’ ve been paying close attention to you and to what has been done to you in Egypt .
CEB	Exodus	3	17	I ’ ve decided to take you away from the harassment in Egypt to the land of the Canaanites , the Hittites , the Amorites , the Perizzites , the Hivites , and the Jebusites , a land full of milk and honey. ” ’
CEB	Exodus	3	18	They will accept what you say to them . Then you and Israel ’ s elders will go to Egypt ’ s king and say to him , ‘ The Lord , the Hebrews ’ God , has met with us . So now let us go on a three-day journey into the desert so that we can offer sacrifices to the Lord our God. ’
CEB	Exodus	3	19	However , I know that Egypt ’ s king won ’ t let you go unless he ’ s forced to do it .
CEB	Exodus	3	20	So I ’ ll use my strength and hit Egypt with dramatic displays of my power . After that , he ’ ll let you go .
CEB	Exodus	3	21	“ I ’ ll make it so that when you leave Egypt , the Egyptians will be kind to you and you won ’ t go away empty-handed .
CEB	Exodus	3	22	Every woman will ask her neighbor along with the immigrant in her household for their silver and their gold jewelry as well as their clothing . Then you will put it on your sons and daughters , and you will rob the Egyptians. ” Footnotes - Exodus 3:1 Also called Reuel - Exodus 3:14 Or I Will Be Who I Will Be .
CEB	Exodus	4	4	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Reach out and grab the snake by the tail. ” So Moses reached out and grabbed it , and it turned back into a rod in his hand .
CEB	Exodus	4	2	The Lord said to him , “ What ’ s that in your hand ? ” Moses replied , “ A shepherd ’ s rod. ”
CEB	Exodus	4	3	The Lord said , “ Throw it down on the ground. ” So Moses threw it on the ground , and it turned into a snake . Moses jumped back from it .
CEB	Exodus	4	5	“ Do this so that they will believe that the Lord , the God of their ancestors , Abraham ’ s God , Isaac ’ s God , and Jacob ’ s God has in fact appeared to you. ”
CEB	Exodus	4	6	Again , the Lord said to Moses , “ Put your hand inside your coat. ” So Moses put his hand inside his coat . When he took his hand out , his hand had a skin disease flaky like snow .
CEB	Exodus	4	7	Then God said , “ Put your hand back inside your coat. ” So Moses put his hand back inside his coat . When he took it back out again , the skin of his hand had returned to normal .
CEB	Exodus	4	8	“ If they won ’ t believe you or pay attention to the first sign , they may believe the second sign .
CEB	Exodus	4	9	If they won ’ t believe even these two signs or pay attention to you , then take some water from the Nile River and pour it out on dry ground . The water that you take from the Nile will turn into blood on the dry ground. ”
CEB	Exodus	4	10	But Moses said to the Lord , “ My Lord , I ’ ve never been able to speak well , not yesterday , not the day before , and certainly not now since you ’ ve been talking to your servant . I have a slow mouth and a thick tongue. ”
CEB	Exodus	4	11	Then the Lord said to him , “ Who gives people the ability to speak ? Who ’ s responsible for making them unable to speak or hard of hearing , sighted or blind ? Isn ’ t it I , the Lord ?
CEB	Exodus	4	12	Now go ! I ’ ll help you speak , and I ’ ll teach you what you should say. ”
CEB	Exodus	4	13	But Moses said , “ Please , my Lord , just send someone else. ”
CEB	Exodus	4	14	Then the Lord got angry at Moses and said , “ What about your brother Aaron the Levite ? I know he can speak very well . He ’ s on his way out to meet you now , and he ’ s looking forward to seeing you .
CEB	Exodus	4	15	Speak to him and tell him what he ’ s supposed to say . I ’ ll help both of you speak , and I ’ ll teach both of you what to do .
CEB	Exodus	4	16	Aaron will speak for you to the people . He ’ ll be a spokesperson for you , and you will be like God for him .
CEB	Exodus	4	17	Take this shepherd ’ s rod with you too so that you can do the signs. ” Moses goes back to Egypt
CEB	Exodus	4	18	Moses went back to his father-in-law Jethro and said to him , “ Please let me go back to my family in Egypt and see whether or not they are still living. ” Jethro said to Moses , “ Go in peace. ”
CEB	Exodus	4	19	The Lord said to Moses in Midian , “ Go back to Egypt because everyone there who wanted to kill you has died. ”
CEB	Exodus	4	20	So Moses took his wife and his children , put them on a donkey , and went back to the land of Egypt . Moses also carried the shepherd ’ s rod from God in his hand .
CEB	Exodus	4	21	The Lord said to Moses , “ When you go back to Egypt , make sure that you appear before Pharaoh and do all the amazing acts that I ’ ve given you the power to do . But I ’ ll make him stubborn so that he won ’ t let the people go .
CEB	Exodus	4	22	Then say to Pharaoh , ‘ This is what the Lord says : Israel is my oldest son .
CEB	Exodus	4	23	I said to you , “ Let my son go so he could worship me. ” But you refused to let him go . As a result , now I ’ m going to kill your oldest son. ’ ”
CEB	Exodus	4	24	During their journey , as they camped overnight , the Lord met Moses [ a ] and tried to kill him .
CEB	Exodus	4	25	But Zipporah took a sharp-edged flint stone and cut off her son ’ s foreskin . Then she touched Moses ’ genitals [ b ] with it , and she said , “ You are my bridegroom because of bloodshed. ”
CEB	Exodus	4	26	So the Lord let him alone . At that time , she announced , “ A bridegroom because of bloodshed by circumcision. ”
CEB	Exodus	4	27	The Lord said to Aaron , “ Go into the desert to meet Moses. ” So he went , and Aaron met him at God ’ s mountain and greeted him with a kiss .
CEB	Exodus	4	28	Moses told Aaron what the Lord had said about his mission and all the signs that the Lord had told him to do .
CEB	Exodus	4	29	Then Moses and Aaron called together all the Israelite elders .
CEB	Exodus	4	30	Aaron told them everything that the Lord had told to Moses , and he performed the signs in front of the people .
CEB	Exodus	4	31	The people believed . When they heard that the Lord had paid attention to the Israelites and had seen their oppression , they bowed down and worshipped . Footnotes - Exodus 4:24 Or him - Exodus 4:25 Or his feet
CEB	Exodus	5	5	Pharaoh continued , “ The land ’ s people are now numerous . Yet you want them to stop their hard work ? ”
CEB	Exodus	5	2	But Pharaoh said , “ Who is this Lord whom I ’ m supposed to obey by letting Israel go ? I don ’ t know this Lord , and I certainly won ’ t let Israel go. ”
CEB	Exodus	5	3	Then they said , “ The Hebrews ’ God has appeared to us . Let us go on a three-day journey into the desert so we can offer sacrifices to the Lord our God . Otherwise , the Lord will give us a deadly disease or violence. ”
CEB	Exodus	5	4	The king of Egypt said to them , “ Moses and Aaron , why are you making the people slack off from their work ? Do the hard work yourselves ! ”
CEB	Exodus	5	6	On the very same day Pharaoh commanded the people ’ s slave masters and supervisors ,
CEB	Exodus	5	7	“ Don ’ t supply the people with the straw they need to make bricks like you did before . Let them go out and gather the straw for themselves .
CEB	Exodus	5	8	But still make sure that they produce the same number of bricks as they made before . Don ’ t reduce the number ! They are weak and lazy , and that ’ s why they cry , ‘ Let ’ s go and offer sacrifices to our God. ’
CEB	Exodus	5	9	Make the men ’ s work so hard that it ’ s all they can do , and they can ’ t focus on these empty lies. ”
CEB	Exodus	5	10	So the people ’ s slave masters and supervisors came out and spoke to the people , “ This is what Pharaoh says , ‘ I ’ m not giving you straw anymore .
CEB	Exodus	5	11	Go and get the straw on your own , wherever you can find it . But your work won ’ t be reduced at all. ’ ”
CEB	Exodus	5	12	So the people spread out all through the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw .
CEB	Exodus	5	13	The slave masters drove them hard and said , “ Make sure you make the same daily quota as when you had the straw. ”
CEB	Exodus	5	14	The Israelite supervisors , whom Pharaoh ’ s slave masters had set over them , were also beaten and asked , “ Why didn ’ t you produce the same number of bricks yesterday and today as you did before ? ”
CEB	Exodus	5	15	Then the Israelite supervisors came and pleaded to Pharaoh , “ Why do you treat your servants like this ?
CEB	Exodus	5	16	No straw is supplied to your servants , yet they say to us , ‘ Make bricks ! ’ Look at how your servants are being beaten ! Your own people are to blame ! ”
CEB	Exodus	5	17	Pharaoh replied , “ You are lazy bums , nothing but lazy bums . That ’ s why you say , ‘ Let us go and offer sacrifices to the Lord. ’
CEB	Exodus	5	18	Go and get back to work ! No straw will be given to you , but you still need to make the same number of bricks. ”
CEB	Exodus	5	19	The Israelite supervisors saw how impossible their situation was when they were commanded , “ Don ’ t reduce your daily quota of bricks. ”
CEB	Exodus	5	20	When they left Pharaoh , they met Moses and Aaron , who were waiting for them .
CEB	Exodus	5	21	The supervisors said to them , “ Let the Lord see and judge what you ’ ve done ! You ’ ve made us stink in the opinion of Pharaoh and his servants . You ’ ve given them a reason to kill us. ”
CEB	Exodus	5	22	Then Moses turned to the Lord and said , “ My Lord , why have you abused this people ? Why did you send me for this ?
CEB	Exodus	5	23	Ever since I first came to Pharaoh to speak in your name , he has abused this people . And you ’ ve done absolutely nothing to rescue your people . ”
CEB	Exodus	6	6	Therefore , say to the Israelites , ‘ I am the Lord . I ’ ll bring you out from Egyptian forced labor . I ’ ll rescue you from your slavery to them . I ’ ll set you free with great power and with momentous events of justice .
CEB	Exodus	6	2	God also said to Moses : “ I am the Lord .
CEB	Exodus	6	3	I appeared to Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob as God Almighty , [ a ] but I didn ’ t reveal myself to them by my name ‘ The Lord. ’
CEB	Exodus	6	4	I also set up my covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan where they lived as immigrants .
CEB	Exodus	6	5	I ’ ve also heard the cry of grief of the Israelites , whom the Egyptians have turned into slaves , and I ’ ve remembered my covenant .
CEB	Exodus	6	7	I ’ ll take you as my people , and I ’ ll be your God . You will know that I , the Lord , am your God , who has freed you from Egyptian forced labor .
CEB	Exodus	6	8	I ’ ll bring you into the land that I promised to give to Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob . I ’ ll give it to you as your possession . I am the Lord. ’ ”
CEB	Exodus	6	9	Moses told this to the Israelites . But they didn ’ t listen to Moses , because of their complete exhaustion and their hard labor .
CEB	Exodus	6	10	Then the Lord said to Moses ,
CEB	Exodus	6	11	“ Go and tell Pharaoh , Egypt ’ s king , to let the Israelites out of his land. ”
CEB	Exodus	6	12	But Moses said to the Lord , “ The Israelites haven ’ t even listened to me . How can I expect Pharaoh to listen to me , especially since I ’ m not a very good speaker ? ”
CEB	Exodus	6	13	Nevertheless , the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron about the Israelites and Pharaoh , Egypt ’ s king , giving them orders to let the Israelites go from the land of Egypt . Family line of Moses and Aaron

CEB	Exodus	6	26	It was this same Aaron and Moses whom the Lord commanded , “ Bring the Israelites out of the land of Egypt in military formation. ”
CEB	Exodus	6	27	It was also this same Moses and Aaron who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt to bring the Israelites out of Egypt .
CEB	Exodus	6	28	At the time the Lord spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt ,
CEB	Exodus	6	29	the Lord said to him , “ I am the Lord . Tell Pharaoh , Egypt ’ s king , everything that I ’ ve said to you. ”
CEB	Exodus	6	30	But Moses replied to the Lord , “ Look , I ’ m not a very good speaker . How is Pharaoh ever going to listen to me ? ” Footnotes - Exodus 6:3 Heb El Shaddai or God of the Mountain
CEB	Exodus	7	7	Moses was
CEB	Exodus	7	2	You will say everything that I command you , and your brother Aaron will tell Pharaoh to let the Israelites out of his land .
CEB	Exodus	7	3	But I ’ ll make Pharaoh stubborn , and I ’ ll perform many of my signs and amazing acts in the land of Egypt .
CEB	Exodus	7	4	When Pharaoh refuses to listen to you , then I ’ ll act against Egypt and I ’ ll bring my people the Israelites out of the land of Egypt in military formation by momentous events of justice .
CEB	Exodus	7	5	The Egyptians will come to know that I am the Lord , when I act against Egypt and bring the Israelites out from among them. ”
CEB	Exodus	7	6	Moses and Aaron did just as the Lord commanded them .
CEB	Exodus	7	80	years old and Aaron was
CEB	Exodus	7	83	when they spoke to Pharaoh . Turning rods into snakes
CEB	Exodus	7	8	The Lord said to Moses and Aaron ,
CEB	Exodus	7	9	“ When Pharaoh says to you , ‘ Do one of your amazing acts , ’ then say to Aaron , ‘ Take your shepherd ’ s rod and throw it down in front of Pharaoh , and it will turn into a cobra. ’ ” [ a ]
CEB	Exodus	7	10	So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and did just as the Lord commanded . Aaron threw down his shepherd ’ s rod in front of Pharaoh and his officials , and it turned into a cobra .
CEB	Exodus	7	11	Then Pharaoh called together his wise men and wizards , and Egypt ’ s religious experts [ b ] did the same thing by using their secret knowledge .
CEB	Exodus	7	12	Each one threw down his rod , and they turned into cobras . But then Aaron ’ s rod swallowed up each of their rods .
CEB	Exodus	7	13	However , Pharaoh remained stubborn . He wouldn ’ t listen to them , just as the Lord had said . Water into blood
CEB	Exodus	7	14	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Pharaoh is stubborn . He still refuses to let the people go .
CEB	Exodus	7	15	Go to Pharaoh in the morning . As he is going out to the water , make sure you stand at the bank of the Nile River so you will run into him . Bring along the shepherd ’ s rod that turned into a snake .
CEB	Exodus	7	16	Say to him , The Lord , the Hebrews ’ God , has sent me to you with this message : Let my people go so that they can worship me in the desert . Up to now you still haven ’ t listened .
CEB	Exodus	7	17	This is what the Lord says : By this you will know that I am the Lord . I ’ m now going to hit the water of the Nile River with this rod in my hand , and it will turn into blood .
CEB	Exodus	7	18	The fish in the Nile are going to die , the Nile will stink , and the Egyptians won ’ t be able to drink water from the Nile. ”
CEB	Exodus	7	19	The Lord said to Moses , “ Say to Aaron , ‘ Take your shepherd ’ s rod and stretch out your hand over Egypt ’ s waters—over their rivers , their canals , their marshes , and all their bodies of water—so that they turn into blood . There will be blood all over the land of Egypt , even in wooden and stone containers. ’ ”
CEB	Exodus	7	20	Moses and Aaron did just as the Lord commanded . He raised the shepherd ’ s rod and hit the water in the Nile in front of Pharaoh and his officials , and all the water in the Nile turned into blood .
CEB	Exodus	7	21	The fish in the Nile died , and the Nile began to stink so that the Egyptians couldn ’ t drink water from the Nile . There was blood all over the land of Egypt .
CEB	Exodus	7	22	But the Egyptian religious experts did the same thing with their secret knowledge . As a result , Pharaoh remained stubborn , and he wouldn ’ t listen to them , just as the Lord had said .
CEB	Exodus	7	23	Pharaoh turned and went back to his palace . He wasn ’ t impressed even by this .
CEB	Exodus	7	24	Meanwhile , all the Egyptians had to dig for drinking water along the banks of the Nile River , because they couldn ’ t drink the water of the Nile itself .
CEB	Exodus	7	25	Seven days went by after the Lord had struck the Nile River . Footnotes - Exodus 7:9 Or serpent - Exodus 7:11 Or magicians
CEB	Exodus	8	8	Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron , and said , “ If you pray to the Lord to get rid of the frogs from me and my people , then I ’ ll let the people go so that they can offer sacrifices to the Lord. ”
CEB	Exodus	8	2	If you refuse to let them go , then I ’ ll send a plague of frogs over your whole country .
CEB	Exodus	8	3	The Nile will overflow with frogs . They ’ ll get into your palace , into your bedroom and onto your bed , into your officials ’ houses , and among all your people , and even into your ovens and bread pans .
CEB	Exodus	8	4	The frogs will crawl up on you , your people , and all your officials. ”
CEB	Exodus	8	5	And [ b ] the Lord said to Moses , “ Tell Aaron , ‘ Stretch out your hand with your shepherd ’ s rod over the rivers , the canals , and the marshes , and make the frogs crawl up all over the land of Egypt. ’ ”
CEB	Exodus	8	6	So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt . The frogs crawled up and covered the land of Egypt .
CEB	Exodus	8	7	However , the Egyptian religious experts were able to do the same thing by their secret knowledge . They too made frogs crawl up onto the land of Egypt .
CEB	Exodus	8	9	Moses said to Pharaoh , “ Have it your way . When should I pray for you and your officials and your people to remove the frogs from your houses , courtyards , and fields ? They ’ ll stay only in the Nile. ”
CEB	Exodus	8	10	Pharaoh said , “ Tomorrow ! ” Moses said , “ Just as you say ! That way you will know that there is no one like the Lord our God .
CEB	Exodus	8	11	The frogs will leave you , your houses , your officials , and your people . They ’ ll stay only in the Nile. ”
CEB	Exodus	8	12	After Moses and Aaron had left Pharaoh , Moses cried out to the Lord about the frogs that the Lord had brought on Pharaoh .
CEB	Exodus	8	13	The Lord did as Moses asked . The frogs died inside the houses , out in the yards , and in the fields .
CEB	Exodus	8	14	They gathered them together in big piles , and the land began to stink .
CEB	Exodus	8	15	But when Pharaoh saw that the disaster was over , he became stubborn again and wouldn ’ t listen to them , just as the Lord had said . Swarming lice
CEB	Exodus	8	16	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Tell Aaron , ‘ Stretch out your shepherd ’ s rod and hit the land ’ s dirt so that lice [ c ] appear in the whole land of Egypt. ’ ”
CEB	Exodus	8	17	They did this . Aaron stretched out his hand with his shepherd ’ s rod , hit the land ’ s dirt , and lice appeared on both people and animals . All the land ’ s dirt turned into lice throughout the whole land of Egypt .
CEB	Exodus	8	18	The religious experts [ d ] tried to produce lice by their secret knowledge , but they weren ’ t able to do it . There were lice on people and animals .
CEB	Exodus	8	19	The religious experts said to Pharaoh , “ This is something only God could do ! ” But Pharaoh was stubborn , and he wouldn ’ t listen to them , just as the Lord had said . Insects fill Egypt
CEB	Exodus	8	20	The Lord said to Moses , “ Get up early in the morning and confront Pharaoh as he goes out to the water . Say to him , This is what the Lord says : Let my people go so that they can worship me .
CEB	Exodus	8	21	If you refuse to let my people go , I ’ ll send swarms of insects [ e ] on you , your officials , your people , and your houses . All Egyptian houses will be filled with swarms of insects and also the ground that they cover .
CEB	Exodus	8	22	But on that day I ’ ll set apart the land of Goshen , where my people live . No swarms of insects will come there so you will know that I , the Lord , am in this land .
CEB	Exodus	8	23	I ’ ll put a barrier between my people and your people . This sign will happen tomorrow. ”
CEB	Exodus	8	24	The Lord did this . Great swarms of insects came into the houses of Pharaoh and his officials and into the whole land of Egypt . The land was ruined by the insects .
CEB	Exodus	8	25	Then Pharaoh called in Moses and Aaron and said , “ Go , offer sacrifices to your God within the land. ”
CEB	Exodus	8	26	Moses replied , “ It wouldn ’ t be right to do that , because the sacrifices that we offer to the Lord our God will offend Egyptians . If we openly offer sacrifices that offend Egyptians , won ’ t they stone us to death ?
CEB	Exodus	8	27	We need to go for a three-day journey into the desert to offer sacrifices to the Lord our God as he has ordered us. ”
CEB	Exodus	8	28	So Pharaoh said , “ I ’ ll let you go to offer sacrifices to the Lord your God in the desert , provided you don ’ t go too far away and you pray for me. ”
CEB	Exodus	8	29	Moses said , “ I ’ ll leave you now , and I ’ ll pray to the Lord . Tomorrow the swarms of insects will leave Pharaoh , his officials , and his people . Just don ’ t let Pharaoh lie to us again and not let the people go to offer sacrifices to the Lord. ”
CEB	Exodus	8	30	So Moses left Pharaoh and prayed to the Lord .
CEB	Exodus	8	31	The Lord did as Moses asked and removed the swarms of insects from Pharaoh , from his officials , and from his people . Not one insect remained .
CEB	Exodus	8	32	But Pharaoh was stubborn once again , and he wouldn ’ t let the people go . Footnotes - Exodus 8:1 7:26 in Heb - Exodus 8:5 8:1 in Heb - Exodus 8:16 Heb uncertain - Exodus 8:18 Or magicians - Exodus 8:21 Heb uncertain
CEB	Exodus	9	9	The ashes will turn to soot over the whole land of Egypt . It will cause skin sores that will break out in blisters on people and animals in the whole land of Egypt. ”
CEB	Exodus	9	2	If you refuse to let them go and you continue to hold them back ,
CEB	Exodus	9	3	the Lord will send a very deadly disease on your livestock in the field : on horses , donkeys , camels , cattle , and flocks .
CEB	Exodus	9	4	But the Lord will distinguish Israel ’ s livestock from Egypt ’ s livestock so that not one that belongs to the Israelites will die. ”
CEB	Exodus	9	5	The Lord set a time and said , “ Tomorrow the Lord will do this in the land. ”
CEB	Exodus	9	6	And the next day the Lord did it . All of the Egyptian livestock died , but not one animal that belonged to the Israelites died .
CEB	Exodus	9	7	Pharaoh asked around and found out that not one of Israel ’ s livestock had died . But Pharaoh was stubborn , and he wouldn ’ t let the people go . Skin sores and blisters
CEB	Exodus	9	8	Then the Lord said to Moses and Aaron , “ Take handfuls of ashes from a furnace and have Moses throw it up in the air in front of Pharaoh .
CEB	Exodus	9	10	So they took ashes from the furnace , and they stood in front of Pharaoh . Moses threw the ash up in the air , and it caused skin sores and blisters to break out on people and animals .
CEB	Exodus	9	11	The religious experts [ a ] couldn ’ t stand up to Moses because of the skin sores , because there were skin sores on the religious experts as well as on all the Egyptians .
CEB	Exodus	9	12	But the Lord made Pharaoh stubborn , and Pharaoh wouldn ’ t listen to them , just as the Lord had said to Moses . Hail and thunder
CEB	Exodus	9	13	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Get up early in the morning and confront Pharaoh . Say to him , This is what the Lord , the God of the Hebrews , says : Let my people go so that they can worship me .
CEB	Exodus	9	14	This time I ’ m going to send all my plagues on you , your officials , and your people so that you will know that there is no one like me in the whole world .
CEB	Exodus	9	15	By now I could have used my power to strike you and your people with a deadly disease so that you would have disappeared from the earth .
CEB	Exodus	9	16	But I ’ ve left you standing for this reason : in order to show you my power and in order to make my name known in the whole world .
CEB	Exodus	9	17	You are still abusing your power against my people , and you refuse to let them go .
CEB	Exodus	9	18	Tomorrow at this time I ’ ll cause the heaviest hail to fall on Egypt that has ever fallen from the day Egypt was founded until now .
CEB	Exodus	9	19	So bring under shelter your livestock and all that belongs to you that is out in the open . Every person or animal that is out in the open field and isn ’ t brought inside will die when the hail rains down on them. ”
CEB	Exodus	9	20	Some of Pharaoh ’ s officials who took the Lord ’ s word seriously rushed to bring their servants and livestock inside for shelter .
CEB	Exodus	9	21	Others who didn ’ t take the Lord ’ s word to heart left their servants and livestock out in the open field .
CEB	Exodus	9	22	The Lord said to Moses , “ Raise your hand toward the sky so that hail will fall on the whole land of Egypt , on people and animals and all the grain in the fields in the land of Egypt. ”
CEB	Exodus	9	23	Then Moses raised his shepherd ’ s rod toward the sky , and the Lord sent thunder and hail , and lightning struck the earth . The Lord rained hail on the land of Egypt .
CEB	Exodus	9	24	The hail and the lightning flashing in the middle of the hail were so severe that there had been nothing like it in the entire land of Egypt since it first became a nation .
CEB	Exodus	9	25	The hail beat down everything that was in the open field throughout the entire land of Egypt , both people and animals . The hail also beat down all the grain in the fields , and it shattered every tree out in the field .
CEB	Exodus	9	26	The only place where hail didn ’ t fall was in the land of Goshen where the Israelites lived .
CEB	Exodus	9	27	Then Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron and said to them , “ This time I ’ ve sinned . The Lord is right , and I and my people are wrong .
CEB	Exodus	9	28	Pray to the Lord ! Enough of God ’ s thunder and hail ! I ’ m going to let you go . You don ’ t need to stay here any longer. ”
CEB	Exodus	9	29	Moses said to him , “ As soon as I ’ ve left the city , I ’ ll spread out my hands to the Lord . Then the thunder and the hail will stop and won ’ t return so that you will know that the earth belongs to the Lord .
CEB	Exodus	9	30	But I know that you and your officials still don ’ t take the Lord God seriously. ” (
CEB	Exodus	9	31	Now the flax and the barley were destroyed , because the barley had ears of grain and the flax had buds .
CEB	Exodus	9	32	But both durum and spelt wheat weren ’ t ruined , because they hadn ’ t come up . )
CEB	Exodus	9	33	Moses left Pharaoh and the city , and spread out his hands to the Lord . Then the thunder and the hail stopped , and the rain stopped pouring down on the earth .
CEB	Exodus	9	34	But when Pharaoh saw that the rain , hail , and thunder had stopped , he sinned again . Pharaoh and his officials became stubborn .
CEB	Exodus	9	35	Because of his stubbornness , Pharaoh refused to let the Israelites go , just as the Lord had told Moses . Footnotes - Exodus 9:11 Or magicians
CEB	Exodus	10	10	Pharaoh said to them , “ Yes , the Lord will be with you , all right , especially if I let your children go with you ! Obviously , you are plotting some evil scheme .
CEB	Exodus	10	2	and so that you can tell your children and grandchildren how I overpowered the Egyptians with the signs I did among them . You will know that I am the Lord. ”
CEB	Exodus	10	3	So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said to him , “ This is what the Lord , the Hebrews ’ God , says : How long will you refuse to respect me ? Let my people go so that they can worship me .
CEB	Exodus	10	4	Otherwise , if you refuse to let my people go , I ’ m going to bring locusts into your country tomorrow .
CEB	Exodus	10	5	They will cover the landscape so that you won ’ t be able to see the ground . They will eat the last bit of vegetation that was left after the hail . They will eat all your trees growing in the fields .
CEB	Exodus	10	6	The locusts will fill your houses and all your officials ’ houses and all the Egyptians ’ houses . Your parents and even your grandparents have never seen anything like it during their entire lifetimes in this fertile land. ” Then Moses turned and left Pharaoh .
CEB	Exodus	10	7	Pharaoh ’ s officials said to him , “ How long will this man trap us in a corner like this ? Let the people go so that they can worship the Lord their God . Don ’ t you get it ? Egypt is being destroyed ! ”
CEB	Exodus	10	8	So Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh , and he said to them , “ Go ! Worship the Lord your God ! But who exactly is going with you ? ”
CEB	Exodus	10	9	Moses said , “ We ’ ll go with our young and old , with our sons and daughters , and with our flocks and herds , because we all must observe the Lord ’ s festival. ”
CEB	Exodus	10	11	No way ! Only your men can go and worship the Lord , because that ’ s what you asked for. ” Then Pharaoh had them chased out of his presence .
CEB	Exodus	10	12	Then the Lord said to Moses : “ Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt so that the locusts will swarm over the land of Egypt and eat all of the land ’ s grain and everything that the hail left. ”
CEB	Exodus	10	13	So Moses stretched out his shepherd ’ s rod over the land of Egypt , and the Lord made an east wind blow over the land all that day and all that night . When morning came , the east wind had carried in the locusts .
CEB	Exodus	10	14	The locusts swarmed over the whole land of Egypt and settled on the whole country . Such a huge swarming of locusts had never happened before and would never happen ever again .
CEB	Exodus	10	15	They covered the whole landscape so that the land turned black with them . They ate all of the land ’ s grain and all of the orchards ’ fruit that the hail had left . Nothing green was left in any orchard or in any grain field in the whole land of Egypt .
CEB	Exodus	10	16	Pharaoh called urgently for Moses and Aaron and said , “ I ’ ve sinned against the Lord your God and against you .
CEB	Exodus	10	17	Please forgive my sin this time . Pray to the Lord your God just to take this deathly disaster away from me. ”
CEB	Exodus	10	18	So Moses left Pharaoh and prayed to the Lord .
CEB	Exodus	10	19	The Lord turned the wind into a very strong west wind that lifted the locusts and drove them into the Reed Sea . [ a ] Not a single locust was left in the whole country of Egypt .
CEB	Exodus	10	20	But the Lord made Pharaoh stubborn so that he wouldn ’ t let the Israelites go . Darkness covers Egypt
CEB	Exodus	10	21	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Raise your hand toward the sky so that darkness spreads over the land of Egypt , a darkness that you can feel. ”
CEB	Exodus	10	22	So Moses raised his hand toward the sky , and an intense darkness fell on the whole land of Egypt for three days .
CEB	Exodus	10	23	People couldn ’ t see each other , and they couldn ’ t go anywhere for three days . But the Israelites all had light where they lived .
CEB	Exodus	10	24	Then Pharaoh called Moses and said , “ Go ! Worship the Lord ! Only your flocks and herds need to stay behind . Even your children can go with you. ”
CEB	Exodus	10	25	But Moses said , “ You need to let us have sacrifices and entirely burned offerings to present to the Lord our God .
CEB	Exodus	10	26	So our livestock must go with us . Not one animal can be left behind . We ’ ll need some of them for worshipping the Lord our God . We won ’ t know which to use to worship the Lord until we get there. ”
CEB	Exodus	10	27	But the Lord made Pharaoh stubborn so that he wasn ’ t willing to let them go .
CEB	Exodus	10	28	Pharaoh said to him , “ Get out of here ! Make sure you never see my face again , because the next time you see my face you will die. ”
CEB	Exodus	10	29	Moses said , “ You ’ ve said it ! I ’ ll never see your face again ! ” Footnotes - Exodus 10:19 Or Red Sea
CEB	Exodus	11	11	The Lord said to Moses , “ I ’ ll bring one more disaster on Pharaoh and on Egypt . After that , he ’ ll let you go from here . In fact , when he lets you go , he ’ ll eagerly chase you out of here .
CEB	Exodus	11	2	Tell every man to ask his neighbor and every woman to ask her neighbor for all their silver and gold jewelry. ”
CEB	Exodus	11	3	The Lord made sure that the Egyptians were kind to the Hebrew people . In addition , Pharaoh ’ s officials and the Egyptian people even came to honor Moses as a great and important man in the land .
CEB	Exodus	11	4	Moses said , “ This is what the Lord says : At midnight I ’ ll go throughout Egypt .
CEB	Exodus	11	5	Every oldest child in the land of Egypt will die , from the oldest child of Pharaoh who sits on his throne to the oldest child of the servant woman by the millstones , and all the first offspring of the animals .
CEB	Exodus	11	6	Then a terrible cry of agony will echo through the whole land of Egypt unlike any heard before or that ever will be again .
CEB	Exodus	11	7	But as for the Israelites , not even a dog will growl at them , at the people , or at their animals . By this , you will know that the Lord makes a distinction between Egypt and Israel .
CEB	Exodus	11	8	Then all your officials will come down to me , bow to me , and say , ‘ Get out , you and all your followers ! ’ After that I ’ ll leave. ” Then Moses , furious , left Pharaoh .
CEB	Exodus	11	9	The Lord said to Moses , “ Pharaoh won ’ t listen to you so that I can perform even more amazing acts in the land of Egypt. ”
CEB	Exodus	11	10	Now Moses and Aaron did all these amazing acts in front of Pharaoh , but the Lord made Pharaoh stubborn so that he didn ’ t let the Israelites go from his land .
CEB	Exodus	12	12	I ’ ll pass through the land of Egypt that night , and I ’ ll strike down every oldest child in the land of Egypt , both humans and animals . I ’ ll impose judgments on all the gods of Egypt . I am the Lord .
CEB	Exodus	12	2	“ This month will be the first month ; it will be the first month of the year for you . [ a ]
CEB	Exodus	12	3	Tell the whole Israelite community : On the tenth day of this month they must take a lamb for each household , a lamb per house .
CEB	Exodus	12	4	If a household is too small for a lamb , it should share one with a neighbor nearby . You should divide the lamb in proportion to the number of people who will be eating it .
CEB	Exodus	12	5	Your lamb should be a flawless year-old male . You may take it from the sheep or from the goats .
CEB	Exodus	12	6	You should keep close watch over it until the fourteenth day of this month . At twilight on that day , the whole assembled Israelite community should slaughter their lambs .
CEB	Exodus	12	7	They should take some of the blood and smear it on the two doorposts and on the beam over the door of the houses in which they are eating .
CEB	Exodus	12	8	That same night they should eat the meat roasted over the fire . They should eat it along with unleavened bread and bitter herbs .
CEB	Exodus	12	9	Don ’ t eat any of it raw or boiled in water , but roasted over fire with its head , legs , and internal organs .
CEB	Exodus	12	10	Don ’ t let any of it remain until morning , and burn any of it left over in the morning .
CEB	Exodus	12	11	This is how you should eat it . You should be dressed , with your sandals on your feet and your walking stick in your hand . You should eat the meal in a hurry . It is the Passover of the Lord .
CEB	Exodus	12	13	The blood will be your sign on the houses where you live . Whenever I see the blood , I ’ ll pass over [ b ] you . No plague will destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt .
CEB	Exodus	12	14	“ This day will be a day of remembering for you . You will observe it as a festival to the Lord . You will observe it in every generation as a regulation for all time .
CEB	Exodus	12	15	You will eat unleavened bread for seven days . On the first day you must remove yeast from your houses because anyone who eats leavened bread anytime during those seven days will be cut off from Israel .
CEB	Exodus	12	16	The first day and the seventh day will be a holy occasion for you . No work at all should be done on those days , except for preparing the food that everyone is going to eat . That is the only work you may do .
CEB	Exodus	12	17	You should observe the Festival of Unleavened Bread , because on this precise day I brought you out of the land of Egypt in military formation . You should observe this day in every generation as a regulation for all time .
CEB	Exodus	12	18	In the first month , from the evening of the fourteenth day until the evening of the twenty-first day , you should eat unleavened bread .
CEB	Exodus	12	19	For seven days no yeast should be found in your houses because whoever eats leavened bread will be cut off from the Israelite community , whether the person is an immigrant or a native of the land .
CEB	Exodus	12	20	You should not eat anything made with yeast in all your settlements . You should eat only unleavened bread. ”
CEB	Exodus	12	21	Then Moses called together all of Israel ’ s elders and said to them , “ Go pick out one of the flock for your families , and slaughter the Passover lamb .
CEB	Exodus	12	22	Take a bunch of hyssop , dip it into the blood that is in the bowl , and touch the beam above the door and the two doorposts with the blood in the bowl . None of you should go out the door of your house until morning .
CEB	Exodus	12	23	When the Lord comes by to strike down the Egyptians and sees the blood on the beam above the door and on the two doorposts , the Lord will pass over that door . He won ’ t let the destroyer enter your houses to strike you down .
CEB	Exodus	12	24	You should observe this ritual as a regulation for all time for you and your children .
CEB	Exodus	12	25	When you enter the land that the Lord has promised to give you , be sure that you observe this ritual .
CEB	Exodus	12	26	And when your children ask you , ‘ What does this ritual mean to you ? ’
CEB	Exodus	12	27	you will say , ‘ It is the Passover sacrifice to the Lord , for the Lord passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt . When he struck down the Egyptians , he spared our houses. ’ ” The people then bowed down and worshipped .
CEB	Exodus	12	28	The Israelites went and did exactly what the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron to do . Death of Egypt ’ s oldest children
CEB	Exodus	12	29	At midnight the Lord struck down all the first offspring in the land of Egypt , from the oldest child of Pharaoh sitting on his throne to the oldest child of the prisoner in jail , and all the first offspring of the animals .
CEB	Exodus	12	30	When Pharaoh , all his officials , and all the Egyptians got up that night , a terrible cry of agony rang out across Egypt because every house had someone in it who had died .
CEB	Exodus	12	31	Then Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron that night and said , “ Get up ! Get away from my people , both you and the Israelites ! Go ! Worship the Lord , as you said !
CEB	Exodus	12	32	You can even take your flocks and herds , as you asked . Just go ! And bring a blessing on me as well ! ” Israel set free
CEB	Exodus	12	33	The Egyptians urged the people to hurry and leave the land because they thought , We ’ ll all be dead .
CEB	Exodus	12	34	So the people picked up their bread dough before the yeast made it rise , with their bread pans wrapped in their robes on their shoulders .
CEB	Exodus	12	35	The Israelites did as Moses had told them and asked the Egyptians for their silver and gold jewelry as well as their clothing .
CEB	Exodus	12	36	The Lord made sure that the Egyptians were kind to the people so that they let them have whatever they asked for . And so they robbed the Egyptians .
CEB	Exodus	12	37	The Israelites traveled from Rameses to Succoth . They numbered about six hundred thousand men on foot , besides children .
CEB	Exodus	12	38	A diverse crowd also went up with them along with a huge number of livestock , both flocks and herds .
CEB	Exodus	12	39	They baked unleavened cakes from the dough they had brought out of Egypt . The dough didn ’ t rise because they were driven out of Egypt and they couldn ’ t wait . In fact , they didn ’ t have time to prepare any food for themselves .
CEB	Exodus	12	40	The length of time that the Israelites had lived in Egypt was four hundred thirty years .
CEB	Exodus	12	41	At the end of four hundred thirty years , on that precise day , all the Lord ’ s people in military formation left the land of Egypt .
CEB	Exodus	12	42	For the Lord , that was a night of intent watching , to bring them out of the land of Egypt . For all Israelites in every generation , this same night is a time of intent watching to honor the Lord . Instructions for observing Passover
CEB	Exodus	12	43	The Lord said to Moses and Aaron : This is the regulation for the Passover . No foreigner may eat it .
CEB	Exodus	12	44	However , any slave who has been bought may eat it after he ’ s been circumcised .
CEB	Exodus	12	45	No temporary foreign resident or day laborer may eat it .
CEB	Exodus	12	46	It should be eaten in one house . You shouldn ’ t take any of the meat outside the house , and you shouldn ’ t break the bones .
CEB	Exodus	12	47	The whole Israelite community should observe it .
CEB	Exodus	12	48	If an immigrant who lives with you wants to observe the Passover to the Lord , then he and all his males should be circumcised . Then he may join in observing it . He should be regarded as a native of the land . But no uncircumcised person may eat it .
CEB	Exodus	12	49	There will be one Instruction for the native and for the immigrant who lives with you .
CEB	Exodus	12	50	All the Israelites did just as the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron .
CEB	Exodus	12	51	On that precise day , the Lord brought the Israelites out of the land of Egypt in military formation . Footnotes - Exodus 12:2 March–April ; cf Exod 13:4 - Exodus 12:13 Heb verb of the noun Passover
CEB	Exodus	13	13	But every first male donkey you should ransom with a sheep . If you don ’ t ransom it , you must break its neck . You should ransom every oldest male among your children .
CEB	Exodus	13	2	Dedicate to me all your oldest children . Each first offspring from any Israelite womb belongs to me , whether human or animal . Unleavened bread
CEB	Exodus	13	3	Moses said to the people , “ Remember this day which is the day that you came out of Egypt , out of the place you were slaves , because the Lord acted with power to bring you out of there . No leavened bread may be eaten .
CEB	Exodus	13	4	Today , in the month of Abib , [ a ] you are going to leave .
CEB	Exodus	13	5	The Lord will bring you to the land of the Canaanites , the Hittites , the Amorites , the Hivites , and the Jebusites . It is the land that the Lord promised your ancestors to give to you , a land full of milk and honey . You should perform this ritual in this month .
CEB	Exodus	13	6	You must eat unleavened bread for seven days . The seventh day is a festival to the Lord .
CEB	Exodus	13	7	Only unleavened bread should be eaten for seven days . No leavened bread and no yeast should be seen among you in your whole country .
CEB	Exodus	13	8	You should explain to your child on that day , ‘ It ’ s because of what the Lord did for me when I came out of Egypt. ’
CEB	Exodus	13	9	“ It will be a sign on your hand and a reminder on your forehead so that you will often discuss the Lord ’ s Instruction , for the Lord brought you out of Egypt with great power .
CEB	Exodus	13	10	So you should follow this regulation at its appointed time every year . Dedication of Israel ’ s oldest offspring
CEB	Exodus	13	11	“ When the Lord brings you into the land of the Canaanites and gives it to you as promised to you and your ancestors ,
CEB	Exodus	13	12	you should set aside for the Lord whatever comes out of the womb first . All of the first males born to your animal belong to the Lord .
CEB	Exodus	13	14	When in the future your child asks you , ‘ What does this mean ? ’ you should answer , ‘ The Lord brought us with great power out of Egypt , out of the place we were slaves .
CEB	Exodus	13	15	When Pharaoh refused to let us go , the Lord killed all the oldest offspring in the land of Egypt , from the oldest sons to the oldest male animals . That is why I offer to the Lord as a sacrifice every male that first comes out of the womb . But I ransom my oldest sons. ’
CEB	Exodus	13	16	It will be a sign on your hand and a symbol on your forehead that the Lord brought us out of Egypt with great power. ” God leads the way
CEB	Exodus	13	17	When Pharaoh let the people go , God didn ’ t lead them by way of the land of the Philistines , even though that was the shorter route . God thought , If the people have to fight and face war , they will run back to Egypt .
CEB	Exodus	13	18	So God led the people by the roundabout way of the Reed Sea [ b ] desert . The Israelites went up out of the land of Egypt ready for battle .
CEB	Exodus	13	19	Moses took with him Joseph ’ s bones just as Joseph had made Israel ’ s sons promise when he said to them , “ When God takes care of you , you must carry my bones out of here with you. ”
CEB	Exodus	13	20	They set out from Succoth and camped at Etham on the edge of the desert .
CEB	Exodus	13	21	The Lord went in front of them during the day in a column of cloud to guide them and at night in a column of lightning to give them light . This way they could travel during the day and at night .
CEB	Exodus	13	22	The column of cloud during the day and the column of lightning at night never left its place in front of the people . Footnotes - Exodus 13:4 March–April , named Nisan after the exile - Exodus 13:18 Or Red Sea
CEB	Exodus	14	14	The Lord will fight for you . You just keep still. ”
CEB	Exodus	14	2	Tell the Israelites to turn back and set up camp in front of Pi-hahiroth , between Migdol and the sea in front of Baal-zephon . You should set up camp in front of it by the sea .
CEB	Exodus	14	3	Pharaoh will think to himself , The Israelites are lost and confused in the land . The desert has trapped them .
CEB	Exodus	14	4	I ’ ll make Pharaoh stubborn , and he ’ ll chase them . I ’ ll gain honor at the expense of Pharaoh and all his army , and the Egyptians will know that I am the Lord . And they did exactly that .
CEB	Exodus	14	5	When Egypt ’ s king was told that the people had run away , Pharaoh and his officials changed their minds about the people . They said , “ What have we done , letting Israel go free from their slavery to us ? ”
CEB	Exodus	14	6	So he sent for his chariot and took his army with him .
CEB	Exodus	14	7	He took six hundred elite chariots and all of Egypt ’ s other chariots with captains on all of them .
CEB	Exodus	14	8	The Lord made Pharaoh , Egypt ’ s king , stubborn , and he chased the Israelites , who were leaving confidently .
CEB	Exodus	14	9	The Egyptians , including all of Pharaoh ’ s horse-drawn chariots , his cavalry , and his army , chased them and caught up with them as they were camped by the sea , by Pi-hahiroth in front of Baal-zephon .
CEB	Exodus	14	10	As Pharaoh drew closer , the Israelites looked back and saw the Egyptians marching toward them . The Israelites were terrified and cried out to the Lord .
CEB	Exodus	14	11	They said to Moses , “ Weren ’ t there enough graves in Egypt that you took us away to die in the desert ? What have you done to us by bringing us out of Egypt like this ?
CEB	Exodus	14	12	Didn ’ t we tell you the same thing in Egypt ? ‘ Leave us alone ! Let us work for the Egyptians ! ’ It would have been better for us to work for the Egyptians than to die in the desert. ”
CEB	Exodus	14	13	But Moses said to the people , “ Don ’ t be afraid . Stand your ground , and watch the Lord rescue you today . The Egyptians you see today you will never ever see again .
CEB	Exodus	14	15	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Why do you cry out to me ? Tell the Israelites to get moving .
CEB	Exodus	14	16	As for you , lift your shepherd ’ s rod , stretch out your hand over the sea , and split it in two so that the Israelites can go into the sea on dry ground .
CEB	Exodus	14	17	But me , I ’ ll make the Egyptians stubborn so that they will go in after them , and I ’ ll gain honor at the expense of Pharaoh , all his army , his chariots , and his cavalry .
CEB	Exodus	14	18	The Egyptians will know that I am the Lord , when I gain honor at the expense of Pharaoh , his chariots , and his cavalry. ”
CEB	Exodus	14	19	God ’ s messenger , who had been in front of Israel ’ s camp , moved and went behind them . The column of cloud moved from the front and took its place behind them .
CEB	Exodus	14	20	It stood between Egypt ’ s camp and Israel ’ s camp . The cloud remained there , and when darkness fell it lit up the night . They didn ’ t come near each other all night .
CEB	Exodus	14	21	Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea . The Lord pushed the sea back by a strong east wind all night , turning the sea into dry land . The waters were split into two .
CEB	Exodus	14	22	The Israelites walked into the sea on dry ground . The waters formed a wall for them on their right hand and on their left .
CEB	Exodus	14	23	The Egyptians chased them and went into the sea after them , all of Pharaoh ’ s horses , chariots , and cavalry .
CEB	Exodus	14	24	As morning approached , the Lord looked down on the Egyptian camp from the column of lightning and cloud and threw the Egyptian camp into a panic .
CEB	Exodus	14	25	The Lord jammed their chariot wheels so that they wouldn ’ t turn easily . The Egyptians said , “ Let ’ s get away from the Israelites , because the Lord is fighting for them against Egypt ! ”
CEB	Exodus	14	26	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Stretch out your hand over the sea so that the water comes back and covers the Egyptians , their chariots , and their cavalry. ”
CEB	Exodus	14	27	So Moses stretched out his hand over the sea . At daybreak , the sea returned to its normal depth . The Egyptians were driving toward it , and the Lord tossed the Egyptians into the sea .
CEB	Exodus	14	28	The waters returned and covered the chariots and the cavalry , Pharaoh ’ s entire army that had followed them into the sea . Not one of them remained .
CEB	Exodus	14	29	The Israelites , however , walked on dry ground through the sea . The waters formed a wall for them on their right hand and on their left .
CEB	Exodus	14	30	The Lord rescued Israel from the Egyptians that day . Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore .
CEB	Exodus	14	31	Israel saw the amazing power of the Lord against the Egyptians . The people were in awe of the Lord , and they believed in the Lord and in his servant Moses .
CEB	Exodus	15	15	Then Edom ’ s tribal chiefs were terrified ; panic grabbed hold of Moab ’ s rulers ; all of Canaan ’ s inhabitants melted in fear .
CEB	Exodus	15	2	The Lord is my strength and my power ; [ a ] he has become my salvation . This is my God , whom I will praise , the God of my ancestors , whom I will acclaim .
CEB	Exodus	15	3	The Lord is a warrior ; the Lord is his name .
CEB	Exodus	15	4	Pharaoh ’ s chariots and his army he hurled into the sea ; his elite captains were sunk in the Reed Sea . [ b ]
CEB	Exodus	15	5	The deep sea covered them ; they sank into the deep waters like a stone .
CEB	Exodus	15	6	Your strong hand , Lord , is dominant in power ; your strong hand , Lord , shatters the enemy !
CEB	Exodus	15	7	With your great surge you overthrow your opponents ; you send out your hot anger ; it burns them up like straw .
CEB	Exodus	15	8	With the breath of your nostrils the waters swelled up , the floods surged up in a great wave ; the deep waters foamed in the depths of the sea .
CEB	Exodus	15	9	The enemy said , “ I ’ ll pursue , I ’ ll overtake , I ’ ll divide the spoils of war . I ’ ll be overfilled with them . I ’ ll draw my sword ; my hand will destroy them. ”
CEB	Exodus	15	10	You blew with your wind ; the sea covered over them . They sank like lead in the towering waters .
CEB	Exodus	15	11	Who is like you among the gods , Lord ? Who is like you , foremost in holiness , worthy of highest praise , doing awesome deeds ?
CEB	Exodus	15	12	You raised your strong hand ; earth swallowed them up .
CEB	Exodus	15	13	With your great loyalty you led the people you rescued ; with your power you guided them to your sanctuary .
CEB	Exodus	15	14	The peoples heard , they shook in terror ; horror grabbed hold of Philistia ’ s inhabitants .
CEB	Exodus	15	16	Terror and fear came over them ; because of your great power , they were as still as a stone until your people , Lord , passed by , until the people you made your own passed by .
CEB	Exodus	15	17	You brought them in and planted them on your own mountain , the place , Lord , that you made your home , the sanctuary , Lord , that your hand created .
CEB	Exodus	15	18	The Lord will rule forever and always .
CEB	Exodus	15	19	When Pharaoh ’ s horses , chariots , and cavalry went into the sea , the Lord brought back the waters of the sea over them . But the Israelites walked through the sea on dry ground . Miriam ’ s victory song
CEB	Exodus	15	20	Then the prophet Miriam , Aaron ’ s sister , took a tambourine in her hand . All the women followed her playing tambourines and dancing .
CEB	Exodus	15	21	Miriam sang the refrain back to them : Sing to the Lord , for an overflowing victory ! Horse and rider he threw into the sea ! Turning bitter water sweet
CEB	Exodus	15	22	Then Moses had Israel leave the Reed Sea [ c ] and go out into the Shur desert . They traveled for three days in the desert and found no water .
CEB	Exodus	15	23	When they came to Marah , they couldn ’ t drink Marah ’ s water because it was bitter . That ’ s why it was called Marah . [ d ]
CEB	Exodus	15	24	The people complained against Moses , “ What will we drink ? ”
CEB	Exodus	15	25	Moses cried out to the Lord , and the Lord pointed out a tree to him . He threw it into the water , and the water became sweet . The Lord made a regulation and a ruling there , and there he tested them .
CEB	Exodus	15	26	The Lord said , “ If you are careful to obey the Lord your God , do what God thinks is right , pay attention to his commandments , and keep all of his regulations , then I won ’ t bring on you any of the diseases that I brought on the Egyptians . I am the Lord who heals you. ”
CEB	Exodus	15	27	Then they came to Elim , where there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees . They camped there by the water . Footnotes - Exodus 15:2 Or song - Exodus 15:4 Or Red Sea - Exodus 15:22 Or Red Sea - Exodus 15:23 Or bitter
CEB	Exodus	16	16	This is what the Lord has commanded : ‘ Collect as much of it as each of you can eat , one omer [ c ] per person . You may collect for the number of people in your household. ’ ”
CEB	Exodus	16	2	The whole Israelite community complained against Moses and Aaron in the desert .
CEB	Exodus	16	3	The Israelites said to them , “ Oh , how we wish that the Lord had just put us to death while we were still in the land of Egypt . There we could sit by the pots cooking meat and eat our fill of bread . Instead , you ’ ve brought us out into this desert to starve this whole assembly to death. ”
CEB	Exodus	16	4	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ I ’ m going to make bread rain down from the sky for you . The people will go out each day and gather just enough for that day . In this way , I ’ ll test them to see whether or not they follow my Instruction .
CEB	Exodus	16	5	On the sixth day , when they measure out what they have collected , it will be twice as much as they collected on other days. ”
CEB	Exodus	16	6	So Moses and Aaron said to all the Israelites , “ This evening you will know that it was the Lord who brought you out of the land of Egypt .
CEB	Exodus	16	7	And in the morning you will see the Lord ’ s glorious presence , because your complaints against the Lord have been heard . Who are we ? Why blame us ? ”
CEB	Exodus	16	8	Moses continued , “ The Lord will give you meat to eat in the evening and your fill of bread in the morning because the Lord heard the complaints you made against him . Who are we ? Your complaints aren ’ t against us but against the Lord. ”
CEB	Exodus	16	9	Then Moses said to Aaron , “ Say to the whole Israelite community , ‘ Come near to the Lord , because he ’ s heard your complaints. ’ ”
CEB	Exodus	16	10	As Aaron spoke to the whole Israelite community , they turned to look toward the desert , and just then the glorious presence of the Lord appeared in the cloud .
CEB	Exodus	16	11	The Lord spoke to Moses ,
CEB	Exodus	16	12	“ I ’ ve heard the complaints of the Israelites . Tell them , ‘ At twilight you will eat meat . And in the morning you will have your fill of bread . Then you will know that I am the Lord your God. ’ ”
CEB	Exodus	16	13	In the evening a flock of quail flew down and covered the camp . And in the morning there was a layer of dew all around the camp .
CEB	Exodus	16	14	When the layer of dew lifted , there on the desert surface were thin flakes , as thin as frost on the ground .
CEB	Exodus	16	15	When the Israelites saw it , they said to each other , “ What [ b ] is it ? ” They didn ’ t know what it was . Moses said to them , “ This is the bread that the Lord has given you to eat .
CEB	Exodus	16	17	The Israelites did as Moses said , some collecting more , some less .
CEB	Exodus	16	18	But when they measured it out by the omer , the ones who had collected more had nothing left over , and the ones who had collected less had no shortage . Everyone collected just as much as they could eat .
CEB	Exodus	16	19	Moses said to them , “ Don ’ t keep any of it until morning. ”
CEB	Exodus	16	20	But they didn ’ t listen to Moses . Some kept part of it until morning , but it became infested with worms and stank . Moses got angry with them .
CEB	Exodus	16	21	Every morning they gathered it , as much as each person could eat . But when the sun grew hot , it melted away .
CEB	Exodus	16	22	On the sixth day the people collected twice as much food as usual , two omers per person . All the chiefs of the community came and told Moses .
CEB	Exodus	16	23	He said to them , “ This is what the Lord has said , ‘ Tomorrow is a day of rest , a holy Sabbath to the Lord . Bake what you want to bake and boil what you want to boil . But you can set aside and keep all the leftovers until the next morning. ’ ”
CEB	Exodus	16	24	So they set the leftovers aside until morning , as Moses had commanded . They didn ’ t stink or become infested with worms .
CEB	Exodus	16	25	The next day Moses said , “ Eat it today , because today is a Sabbath to the Lord . Today you won ’ t find it out in the field .
CEB	Exodus	16	26	Six days you will gather it . But on the seventh day , the Sabbath , there will be nothing to gather. ”
CEB	Exodus	16	27	On the seventh day some of the people went out to gather bread , but they found nothing .
CEB	Exodus	16	28	The Lord said to Moses , “ How long will you refuse to obey my commandments and instructions ?
CEB	Exodus	16	29	Look ! The Lord has given you the Sabbath . Therefore , on the sixth day he gives you enough food for two days . Each of you should stay where you are and not leave your place on the seventh day. ”
CEB	Exodus	16	30	So the people rested on the seventh day .
CEB	Exodus	16	31	The Israelite people called it manna . It was like coriander seed , white , and tasted like honey wafers .
CEB	Exodus	16	32	Moses said , “ This is what the Lord has commanded : ‘ Let an omer of it be kept safe for future generations so that they can see the food that I used to feed you in the desert when I brought you out of the land of Egypt. ’ ”
CEB	Exodus	16	33	Moses said to Aaron , “ Take a jar , and put one full omer of manna in it . Then set it in the Lord ’ s presence , where it should be kept safe for future generations. ”
CEB	Exodus	16	34	Aaron did as the Lord commanded Moses , and he put it in front of the covenant document for safekeeping .
CEB	Exodus	16	35	The Israelites ate manna for forty years , until they came to a livable land . They ate manna until they came to the border of the land of Canaan . (

CEB	Exodus	17	17	The whole Israelite community broke camp and set out from the Sin desert to continue their journey , as the Lord commanded . They set up their camp at Rephidim , but there was no water for the people to drink .
CEB	Exodus	17	2	The people argued with Moses and said , “ Give us water to drink. ” Moses said to them , “ Why are you arguing with me ? Why are you testing the Lord ? ”
CEB	Exodus	17	3	But the people were very thirsty for water there , and they complained to Moses , “ Why did you bring us out of Egypt to kill us , our children , and our livestock with thirst ? ”
CEB	Exodus	17	4	So Moses cried out to the Lord , “ What should I do with this people ? They are getting ready to stone me. ”
CEB	Exodus	17	5	The Lord said to Moses , “ Go on ahead of the people , and take some of Israel ’ s elders with you . Take in your hand the shepherd ’ s rod that you used to strike the Nile River , and go .
CEB	Exodus	17	6	I ’ ll be standing there in front of you on the rock at Horeb . Hit the rock . Water will come out of it , and the people will be able to drink. ” Moses did so while Israel ’ s elders watched .
CEB	Exodus	17	7	He called the place Massah [ a ] and Meribah , [ b ] because the Israelites argued with and tested the Lord , asking , “ Is the Lord really with us or not ? ” Israel defeats Amalek
CEB	Exodus	17	8	Amalek came and fought with Israel at Rephidim .
CEB	Exodus	17	9	Moses said to Joshua , “ Choose some men for us and go fight with Amalek . Tomorrow I ’ ll stand on top of the hill with the shepherd ’ s rod of God in my hand. ”
CEB	Exodus	17	10	So Joshua did as Moses told him . He fought with Amalek while Moses , Aaron , and Hur went up to the top of the hill .
CEB	Exodus	17	11	Whenever Moses held up his hand , Israel would start winning the battle . Whenever Moses lowered his hand , Amalek would start winning .
CEB	Exodus	17	12	But Moses ’ hands grew tired . So they took a stone and put it under Moses so he could sit down on it . Aaron and Hur held up his hands , one on each side of him so that his hands remained steady until sunset .
CEB	Exodus	17	13	So Joshua defeated Amalek and his army with the sword .
CEB	Exodus	17	14	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Write this as a reminder on a scroll and read it to Joshua : I will completely wipe out the memory of Amalek under the sky. ”
CEB	Exodus	17	15	Moses built an altar there and called it , “ The Lord is my banner. ”
CEB	Exodus	17	16	He said , “ The power of the Lord ’ s banner ! [ c ] The Lord is at war with Amalek in every generation. ” Footnotes - Exodus 17:7 Or test - Exodus 17:7 Or argument - Exodus 17:16 Heb uncertain
CEB	Exodus	18	18	You will end up totally wearing yourself out , both you and these people who are with you . The work is too difficult for you . You can ’ t do it alone .
CEB	Exodus	18	2	Moses ’ father-in-law Jethro took with him Zipporah , Moses ’ wife whom he had sent away ,
CEB	Exodus	18	3	along with her two sons . One was named Gershom because he said , “ I have been an immigrant [ a ] living in a foreign land. ”
CEB	Exodus	18	4	The other was named Eliezer [ b ] because he said , “ The God of my ancestors was my helper who rescued me from Pharaoh ’ s sword. ”
CEB	Exodus	18	5	Jethro , Moses ’ father-in-law , brought Moses ’ sons and wife back to him in the desert where he had set up camp at God ’ s mountain .
CEB	Exodus	18	6	He sent word to Moses : “ I , your father-in-law Jethro , am coming to you along with your wife and her two sons. ”
CEB	Exodus	18	7	Moses went out to meet his father-in-law , and he bowed down and kissed him . They asked each other how they were doing , and then they went into the tent .
CEB	Exodus	18	8	Moses then told his father-in-law everything that the Lord had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians on Israel ’ s behalf , all the difficulty they had on their journey , and how the Lord had rescued them .
CEB	Exodus	18	9	Jethro was glad about all the good things that the Lord had done for Israel in saving them from the Egyptians ’ power .
CEB	Exodus	18	10	Jethro said , “ Bless the Lord who rescued you from the Egyptians ’ power and from Pharaoh ’ s power , who rescued the people from Egypt ’ s oppressive power .
CEB	Exodus	18	11	Now I know that the Lord is greater than all the gods , because of what happened when the Egyptians plotted against them. ”
CEB	Exodus	18	12	Then Jethro , Moses ’ father-in-law , brought an entirely burned offering and sacrifices to God . Aaron came with all of Israel ’ s elders to eat a meal with Moses ’ father-in-law in God ’ s presence .
CEB	Exodus	18	13	The next day Moses sat as a judge for the people , while the people stood around Moses from morning until evening .
CEB	Exodus	18	14	When Moses ’ father-in-law saw all that he was doing for the people , he said , “ What ’ s this that you are doing for the people ? Why do you sit alone , while all the people are standing around you from morning until evening ? ”
CEB	Exodus	18	15	Moses said to his father-in-law , “ Because the people come to me to inquire of God .
CEB	Exodus	18	16	When a conflict arises between them , they come to me and I judge between the two of them . I also teach them God ’ s regulations and instructions. ”
CEB	Exodus	18	17	Moses ’ father-in-law said to him , “ What you are doing isn ’ t good .
CEB	Exodus	18	19	Now listen to me and let me give you some advice . And may God be with you ! Your role should be to represent the people before God . You should bring their disputes before God yourself .
CEB	Exodus	18	20	Explain the regulations and instructions to them . Let them know the way they are supposed to go and the things they are supposed to do .
CEB	Exodus	18	21	But you should also look among all the people for capable persons who respect God . They should be trustworthy and not corrupt . Set these persons over the people as officers of groups of thousands , hundreds , fifties , and tens .
CEB	Exodus	18	22	Let them sit as judges for the people at all times . They should bring every major dispute to you , but they should decide all of the minor cases themselves . This will be much easier for you , and they will share your load .
CEB	Exodus	18	23	If you do this and God directs you , then you will be able to endure . And all these people will be able to go back to their homes much happier. ”
CEB	Exodus	18	24	Moses listened to his father-in-law ’ s suggestions and did everything that he had said .
CEB	Exodus	18	25	Moses chose capable persons from all Israel and set them as leaders over the people , as officers over groups of thousands , hundreds , fifties , and tens .
CEB	Exodus	18	26	They acted as judges for the people at all times . They would refer the hard cases to Moses , but all of the minor cases they decided themselves .
CEB	Exodus	18	27	Then Moses said good-bye to his father-in-law , and Jethro went back to his own country . Footnotes - Exodus 18:3 Heb ger sounds like Gershom . - Exodus 18:4 Or my God is a helper .
CEB	Exodus	19	19	The blasts of the horn grew louder and louder . Moses would speak , and God would answer him with thunder .
CEB	Exodus	19	2	They traveled from Rephidim , came into the Sinai desert , and set up camp there . Israel camped there in front of the mountain
CEB	Exodus	19	3	while Moses went up to God . The Lord called to him from the mountain , “ This is what you should say to Jacob ’ s household and declare to the Israelites :
CEB	Exodus	19	4	You saw what I did to the Egyptians , and how I lifted you up on eagles ’ wings and brought you to me .
CEB	Exodus	19	5	So now , if you faithfully obey me and stay true to my covenant , you will be my most precious possession out of all the peoples , since the whole earth belongs to me .
CEB	Exodus	19	6	You will be a kingdom of priests for me and a holy nation . These are the words you should say to the Israelites. ”
CEB	Exodus	19	7	So Moses came down , called together the people ’ s elders , and set before them all these words that the Lord had commanded him .
CEB	Exodus	19	8	The people all responded with one voice : “ Everything that the Lord has said we will do. ” Moses reported to the Lord what the people said . Preparing for a divine encounter
CEB	Exodus	19	9	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ I ’ m about to come to you in a thick cloud in order that the people will hear me talking with you so that they will always trust you. ” Moses told the Lord what the people said ,
CEB	Exodus	19	10	and the Lord said to Moses : “ Go to the people and take today and tomorrow to make them holy . Have them wash their clothes .
CEB	Exodus	19	11	Be ready for the third day , because on the third day the Lord will come down on Mount Sinai for all the people to see .
CEB	Exodus	19	12	Set up a fence for the people all around and tell them , ‘ Be careful not to go up the mountain or to touch any part of it. ’ Anyone who even touches the mountain must be put to death .
CEB	Exodus	19	13	No one should touch anyone who has touched it , or they must be either stoned to death or shot with arrows . Whether an animal or a human being , they must not be allowed to live . Only when the ram ’ s horn sounds may they go up on the mountain. ”
CEB	Exodus	19	14	So Moses went down the mountain to the people . He made sure the people were holy and that they washed their clothes .
CEB	Exodus	19	15	He told the men , “ Prepare yourselves for three days . Don ’ t go near a woman. ”
CEB	Exodus	19	16	When morning dawned on the third day , there was thunder , lightning , and a thick cloud on the mountain , and a very loud blast of a horn . All the people in the camp shook with fear .
CEB	Exodus	19	17	Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God , and they took their place at the foot of the mountain .
CEB	Exodus	19	18	Mount Sinai was all in smoke because the Lord had come down on it with lightning . The smoke went up like the smoke of a hot furnace , while the whole mountain shook violently .
CEB	Exodus	19	20	The Lord came down on Mount Sinai to the top of the mountain . The Lord called Moses to come up to the top of the mountain , and Moses went up .
CEB	Exodus	19	21	The Lord said to Moses , “ Go down and warn the people not to break through to try to see the Lord , or many of them will fall dead .
CEB	Exodus	19	22	Even the priests who come near to the Lord must keep themselves holy , or the Lord will break loose against them. ”
CEB	Exodus	19	23	Moses said to the Lord , “ The people aren ’ t allowed to come up on Mount Sinai because you warned us and said , ‘ Set up a fence around the mountain to keep it holy. ’ ”
CEB	Exodus	19	24	The Lord said to him , “ Go down , and bring Aaron back up with you . But the priests and the people must not break through and come up to the Lord . Otherwise , the Lord will break loose against them. ”
CEB	Exodus	19	25	So Moses went down to the people and told them .
CEB	Exodus	20	20	Moses said to the people , “ Don ’ t be afraid , because God has come only to test you and to make sure you are always in awe of God so that you don ’ t sin. ”

CEB	Exodus	20	5	Do not bow down to them or worship them , because I , the Lord your God , am a passionate God . I punish children for their parents ’ sins even to the third and fourth generations of those who hate me .
CEB	Exodus	20	6	But I am loyal and gracious to the thousandth generation [ b ] of those who love me and keep my commandments .
CEB	Exodus	20	7	Do not use the Lord your God ’ s name as if it were of no significance ; the Lord won ’ t forgive anyone who uses his name that way .
CEB	Exodus	20	8	Remember the Sabbath day and treat it as holy .
CEB	Exodus	20	9	Six days you may work and do all your tasks ,
CEB	Exodus	20	10	but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God . Do not do any work on it—not you , your sons or daughters , your male or female servants , your animals , or the immigrant who is living with you .
CEB	Exodus	20	11	Because the Lord made the heavens and the earth , the sea , and everything that is in them in six days , but rested on the seventh day . That is why the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy .

CEB	Exodus	32	2	Aaron said to them , “ All right , take out the gold rings from the ears of your wives , your sons , and your daughters , and bring them to me. ”
CEB	Exodus	32	3	So all the people took out the gold rings from their ears and brought them to Aaron .
CEB	Exodus	32	4	He collected them and tied them up in a cloth . [ b ] Then he made a metal image of a bull calf , and the people declared , “ These are your gods , Israel , who brought you up out of the land of Egypt ! ”
CEB	Exodus	32	5	When Aaron saw this , he built an altar in front of the calf . Then Aaron announced , “ Tomorrow will be a festival to the Lord ! ”
CEB	Exodus	32	6	They got up early the next day and offered up entirely burned offerings and brought well-being sacrifices . The people sat down to eat and drink and then got up to celebrate .
CEB	Exodus	32	7	The Lord spoke to Moses : “ Hurry up and go down ! Your people , whom you brought up out of the land of Egypt , are ruining everything !
CEB	Exodus	32	8	They ’ ve already abandoned the path that I commanded . They have made a metal bull calf for themselves . They ’ ve bowed down to it and offered sacrifices to it and declared , ‘ These are your gods , Israel , who brought you up out of the land of Egypt ! ’ ”
CEB	Exodus	32	9	The Lord said to Moses , “ I ’ ve been watching these people , and I ’ ve seen how stubborn they are .
CEB	Exodus	32	10	Now leave me alone ! Let my fury burn and devour them . Then I ’ ll make a great nation out of you. ”
CEB	Exodus	32	11	But Moses pleaded with the Lord his God , “ Lord , why does your fury burn against your own people , whom you brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and amazing force ?
CEB	Exodus	32	12	Why should the Egyptians say , ‘ He had an evil plan to take the people out and kill them in the mountains and so wipe them off the earth ’ ? Calm down your fierce anger . Change your mind about doing terrible things to your own people .
CEB	Exodus	32	13	Remember Abraham , Isaac , and Israel , your servants , whom you yourself promised , ‘ I ’ ll make your descendants as many as the stars in the sky . And I ’ ve promised to give your descendants this whole land to possess for all time. ’ ”

CEB	Exodus	32	19	When he got near the camp and saw the bull calf and the dancing , Moses was furious . He hurled the tablets down and shattered them in pieces at the foot of the mountain .
CEB	Exodus	32	20	He took the calf that they had made and burned it in a fire . Then he ground it down to crushed powder , scattered it on the water , and made the Israelites drink it .
CEB	Exodus	32	21	Moses said to Aaron , “ What did these people do to you that you led them to commit such a terrible sin ? ”
CEB	Exodus	32	22	Aaron replied , “ Don ’ t get angry with me , sir . You know yourself that these people are out of control . [ c ]
CEB	Exodus	32	23	They said to me , ‘ Make us gods who can lead us . As for this man Moses who brought us up out of the land of Egypt , we don ’ t have a clue what has happened to him. ’
CEB	Exodus	32	24	So I said to them , ‘ Whoever has gold , take it off ! ’ So they gave it to me , I threw it into the fire , and out came this bull calf ! ”
CEB	Exodus	32	25	Moses saw that the people were out of control because Aaron had let them get out of control , making them an easy target for their enemies .
CEB	Exodus	32	26	So Moses stood at the camp ’ s gate and said , “ Whoever is on the Lord ’ s side , come to me ! ” All the Levites gathered around him .
CEB	Exodus	32	27	Moses said to them , “ This is what the Lord , Israel ’ s God , says : Each of you , strap on your sword ! Go back and forth from one end of the camp to the other . Each of you , kill your brother , your friend , and your neighbor ! ”
CEB	Exodus	32	28	The Levites did as Moses commanded . About three thousand people were killed that day .
CEB	Exodus	32	29	Moses said , “ Today you ’ ve been ordained to the Lord , each one of you at the cost of a son or a brother . Today you ’ ve gained a special blessing for yourselves. ”
CEB	Exodus	32	30	The next day Moses said to the people , “ You ’ ve committed a terrible sin . So now I will go up to the Lord . Maybe I can arrange reconciliation on account of your sin. ”
CEB	Exodus	32	31	So Moses went back to the Lord and said , “ Oh , what a terrible sin these people have committed ! They made for themselves gods [ d ] of gold .
CEB	Exodus	32	33	But the Lord said to Moses , “ The ones I ’ ll wipe out of my scroll are those who sinned against me .
CEB	Exodus	32	34	Now go and lead the people to the place I described to you . My messenger here will go in front of you . When the day of reckoning comes , I ’ ll count their sin against them. ”
CEB	Exodus	32	35	Then the Lord sent a plague on the people because of what they did with the bull calf that Aaron made . Footnotes - Exodus 32:1 Or a god - Exodus 32:4 Or formed them into a mold or engraved them with a stylus - Exodus 32:22 Sam ; MT evil - Exodus 32:31 Or a god
CEB	Exodus	33	33	The Lord said to Moses , “ Go and leave this place , you and the people whom you brought up out of the land of Egypt . Go to the land I promised to Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob when I said , ‘ I ’ ll give it to your descendants. ’
CEB	Exodus	33	2	I ’ ll send a messenger before you . I ’ ll drive out the Canaanites , the Amorites , the Hittites , the Perizzites , the Hivites , and the Jebusites .
CEB	Exodus	33	3	Go to this land full of milk and honey . But I won ’ t go up with you because I would end up destroying you along the way since you are a stubborn people. ”
CEB	Exodus	33	4	When the people heard the bad news , they were sorry . No one put on any jewelry ,
CEB	Exodus	33	5	because the Lord had said to Moses , “ Tell the Israelites , ‘ You are a stubborn people . If I were to go up with you even for a single moment , I would destroy you . So now take off your jewelry , while I figure out what to do with you. ’ ”
CEB	Exodus	33	6	So after leaving Mount Horeb the Israelites rid themselves of their jewelry . Speaking with the Lord at the meeting tent
CEB	Exodus	33	7	Moses took the tent and pitched it outside the camp , far away from the camp . He called it the meeting tent . Everyone who wanted advice from the Lord would go out to the meeting tent outside the camp .
CEB	Exodus	33	8	Whenever Moses went out to the tent , all the people would rise and stand at the entrance to their tents and watch Moses until he had gone into the tent .
CEB	Exodus	33	9	When Moses entered the tent , the column of cloud would come down and stand at the tent ’ s entrance while the Lord talked with Moses .
CEB	Exodus	33	10	When all the people saw the column of cloud standing at the tent ’ s entrance , they would all rise and then bow down at the entrances to their tents .
CEB	Exodus	33	11	In this way the Lord used to speak to Moses face-to-face , like two people talking to each other . Then Moses would come back to the camp . But his young assistant Joshua , Nun ’ s son , wouldn ’ t leave the tent . Moses pleads with God
CEB	Exodus	33	12	Moses said to the Lord , “ Look , you ’ ve been telling me , ‘ Lead these people forward. ’ But you haven ’ t told me whom you will send with me . Yet you ’ ve assured me , ‘ I know you by name and think highly of you. ’
CEB	Exodus	33	13	Now if you do think highly of me , show me your ways so that I may know you and so that you may really approve of me . Remember too that this nation is your people. ”
CEB	Exodus	33	14	The Lord replied , “ I ’ ll go myself , and I ’ ll help you. ”
CEB	Exodus	33	15	Moses replied , “ If you won ’ t go yourself , don ’ t make us leave here .
CEB	Exodus	33	16	Because how will anyone know that we have your special approval , both I and your people , unless you go with us ? Only that distinguishes us , me and your people , from every other people on the earth. ”
CEB	Exodus	33	17	The Lord said to Moses , “ I ’ ll do exactly what you ’ ve asked because you have my special approval , and I know you by name. ”
CEB	Exodus	33	18	Moses said , “ Please show me your glorious presence. ”
CEB	Exodus	33	19	The Lord said , “ I ’ ll make all my goodness pass in front of you , and I ’ ll proclaim before you the name , ‘ The Lord. ’ I will be kind to whomever I wish to be kind , and I will have compassion to whomever I wish to be compassionate .
CEB	Exodus	33	20	But , ” the Lord said , “ you can ’ t see my face because no one can see me and live. ”
CEB	Exodus	33	21	The Lord said , “ Here is a place near me where you will stand beside the rock .
CEB	Exodus	33	22	As my glorious presence passes by , I ’ ll set you in a gap in the rock , and I ’ ll cover you with my hand until I ’ ve passed by .
CEB	Exodus	33	23	Then I ’ ll take away my hand , and you will see my back , but my face won ’ t be visible . ”
CEB	Exodus	34	34	Whenever Moses went into the Lord ’ s presence to speak with him , Moses would take the veil off until he came out again . When Moses came out and told the Israelites what he had been commanded ,
CEB	Exodus	34	2	Get ready in the morning and come up to Mount Sinai . Stand there on top of the mountain in front of me .
CEB	Exodus	34	3	No one else can come up with you . Don ’ t allow anyone even to be seen anywhere on the mountain . Don ’ t even let sheep and cattle graze in front of the mountain. ”
CEB	Exodus	34	4	So Moses cut two stone tablets like the first ones . He got up early in the morning and climbed up Mount Sinai , just as the Lord had commanded him . He carried the two stone tablets in his hands .
CEB	Exodus	34	5	The Lord came down in the cloud and stood there with him , and proclaimed the name , “ The Lord. ”
CEB	Exodus	34	6	The Lord passed in front of him and proclaimed : “ The Lord ! The Lord ! a God who is compassionate and merciful , very patient , full of great loyalty and faithfulness ,
CEB	Exodus	34	7	showing great loyalty to a thousand generations , forgiving every kind of sin and rebellion , yet by no means clearing the guilty , punishing for their parents ’ sins their children and their grandchildren , as well as the third and the fourth generation. ”
CEB	Exodus	34	8	At once Moses bowed to the ground and worshipped .
CEB	Exodus	34	9	He said , “ If you approve of me , my Lord , please go along with us . [ a ] Although these are stubborn people , forgive our guilt and our sin and take us as your own possession. ” Renewing the broken covenant
CEB	Exodus	34	10	The Lord said : I now make a covenant . In front of all your people , I ’ ll perform dramatic displays of power that have never been done before anywhere on earth or in any nation . All the people who are around you will see what the Lord does , because I will do an awesome thing with you .
CEB	Exodus	34	11	Be sure to obey what I command you today . I ’ m about to drive out before you the Amorites , the Canaanites , the Hittites , the Perizzites , the Hivites , and the Jebusites .
CEB	Exodus	34	12	Be careful that you don ’ t make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land to which you are going , or it will become a dangerous trap for you .
CEB	Exodus	34	13	You must tear down their altars , smash their sacred stone pillars , and cut down their sacred poles .
CEB	Exodus	34	14	You must not bow down to another god , because the Lord is passionate : the Lord ’ s name means “ a passionate God. ”
CEB	Exodus	34	15	Don ’ t make a covenant with those who live in the land . When they prostitute themselves with their gods and sacrifice to their gods , they may invite you and you may end up eating some of the sacrifice .
CEB	Exodus	34	16	Then you might go and choose their daughters as wives for your sons . And their daughters who prostitute themselves with their gods might lead your sons to prostitute themselves with their gods .
CEB	Exodus	34	17	Don ’ t make metal gods for yourself .
CEB	Exodus	34	18	Observe the Festival of Unleavened Bread . You should eat unleavened bread for seven days , as I commanded you , at the set time in the month of Abib , [ b ] because it was in the month of Abib that you came out of Egypt .
CEB	Exodus	34	19	Every first offspring is mine . That includes all your male livestock , the oldest offspring of cows and sheep .
CEB	Exodus	34	20	But a donkey ’ s oldest offspring you may ransom with a sheep . Or if you don ’ t ransom it , you must break its neck . You should ransom all of your oldest sons . No one should appear before me empty-handed .
CEB	Exodus	34	21	You should do your work for six days , but on the seventh day you should rest . Even during plowing or harvesttime you should rest .
CEB	Exodus	34	22	You should observe the Festival of Weeks , for the early produce of the wheat harvest , and the Gathering Festival at the end of the year .
CEB	Exodus	34	23	All your males should appear three times a year before the Lord God , Israel ’ s God .
CEB	Exodus	34	24	I will drive out nations before you and extend your borders . No one will desire and try to take your land if you go up and appear before the Lord your God three times a year .
CEB	Exodus	34	25	Don ’ t slaughter the blood of my sacrifice with anything leavened . The sacrifice of the Passover Festival shouldn ’ t be left over until the morning .
CEB	Exodus	34	26	Bring the best of the early produce of your farmland to the Lord your God ’ s temple . Don ’ t boil a young goat in its mother ’ s milk .
CEB	Exodus	34	27	The Lord said to Moses : “ Write down these words because by these words I hereby make a covenant with you and with Israel. ”
CEB	Exodus	34	28	Moses was there with the Lord forty days and forty nights . He didn ’ t eat any bread or drink any water . He wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant , the ten words . Moses ’ brightly shining face
CEB	Exodus	34	29	Moses came down from Mount Sinai . As he came down from the mountain with the two covenant tablets in his hand , Moses didn ’ t realize that the skin of his face shone brightly because he had been talking with God .
CEB	Exodus	34	30	When Aaron and all the Israelites saw the skin of Moses ’ face shining brightly , they were afraid to come near him .
CEB	Exodus	34	31	But Moses called them closer . So Aaron and all the leaders of the community came back to him , and Moses spoke with them .
CEB	Exodus	34	32	After that , all the Israelites came near as well , and Moses commanded them everything that the Lord had spoken with him on Mount Sinai .
CEB	Exodus	34	33	When Moses finished speaking with them , he put a veil over his face .
CEB	Exodus	34	35	the Israelites would see that the skin of Moses ’ face was shining brightly . So Moses would put the veil on his face again until the next time he went in to speak with the Lord .

CEB	Exodus	35	22	Both men and women came forward . Everyone who was eager to participate brought pins , earrings , rings , and necklaces , all sorts of gold objects . Everyone raised an uplifted offering of gold to the Lord .

CEB	Exodus	35	24	Everyone who could make a gift offering of silver or copper brought it as the Lord ’ s gift offering . Everyone who had acacia wood that could be used in any kind of building work brought it .
CEB	Exodus	35	25	All the skilled women spun cloth with their hands , and brought what they had spun in blue and purple and deep red yarns and fine linen .
CEB	Exodus	35	26	All the women who were eager to use their skill spun the goats ’ hair .

CEB	Exodus	35	28	spices and oil for light and for the anointing oil , and for the sweet-smelling incense .
CEB	Exodus	35	29	All the Israelite men and women who were eager to contribute something for the work that the Lord had commanded Moses to do brought it as a spontaneous gift to the Lord . Moses introduces Bezalel and Oholiab
CEB	Exodus	35	30	Then Moses said to the Israelites : “ Look , the Lord has chosen Bezalel , Uri ’ s son and Hur ’ s grandson from the tribe of Judah .
CEB	Exodus	35	31	The Lord has filled him with the divine spirit that will give him skill , ability , and knowledge for every kind of work .

CEB	Exodus	36	36	They made for it four acacia-wood posts covered in gold with gold hooks and cast four silver bases for them .
CEB	Exodus	36	2	Moses then called together Bezalel , Oholiab , and every skilled person whom the Lord had given skill and who was eager to come and do the work .
CEB	Exodus	36	3	Moses gave them all the gift offerings that the Israelites had contributed to the work on the sanctuary . They kept bringing him spontaneous gifts , morning after morning .
CEB	Exodus	36	4	Finally , all the skilled workers building the sanctuary left their work that they were doing one by one to come
CEB	Exodus	36	5	and say to Moses , “ The people are contributing way too much material for doing the work that the Lord has commanded us to do. ”
CEB	Exodus	36	6	So Moses issued a command that was proclaimed throughout the camp : “ Every man and woman should stop making gift offerings for the sanctuary project. ” So the people stopped bringing anything more
CEB	Exodus	36	7	because what they had already brought was more than enough to do all the work . Construction of the dwelling
CEB	Exodus	36	8	All the skilled workers made the dwelling out of ten curtains of fine twisted linen and blue , purple , and deep red yarns , with figures of winged heavenly creatures worked into their design .

CEB	Leviticus	6	4	at that point , once you have sinned and become guilty of sin , you must return the property you took by robbery or fraud , or the deposit that was left with you for safekeeping , or the lost property that you found ,
CEB	Leviticus	6	5	or whatever it was that you swore falsely about . You must make amends for the principal amount and add one-fifth to it . You must give it to the owner on the day you become guilty .
CEB	Leviticus	6	7	The priest will make reconciliation for you before the Lord , and you will be forgiven for anything you may have done that made you guilty . Priestly instructions
CEB	Leviticus	6	8	[ b ] The Lord said to Moses :
CEB	Leviticus	6	9	Command Aaron and his sons : This is the Instruction for the entirely burned offering—the entirely burned offering that must remain on the altar hearth all night until morning , while the fire is kept burning .
CEB	Leviticus	6	10	The priest will dress in his linen robe , with linen undergarments on his body . Because the fire will have devoured the entirely burned offering on the altar , he must remove the ashes and place them beside the altar .
CEB	Leviticus	6	11	The priest will then take off his clothes , dress in a different set of clothes , and take the ashes outside the camp to a clean location .
CEB	Leviticus	6	12	The altar fire must be kept burning ; it must not go out . Each morning the priest will burn wood on it , will lay out the entirely burned offering on it , and will completely burn the fat of the well-being offering on it .
CEB	Leviticus	6	13	A continuous fire must be kept burning on the altar ; it must not go out .
CEB	Leviticus	6	14	This is the Instruction for the grain offering : Aaron ’ s sons will present it before the Lord in front of the altar .
CEB	Leviticus	6	15	The priest will remove a handful of the choice flour and oil from the grain offering , and all of the frankincense that is on it , and burn this token portion completely on the altar as a soothing smell to the Lord .
CEB	Leviticus	6	16	Aaron and his sons will eat the rest of it . It must be eaten as unleavened bread in a holy place ; the priests must eat it in the meeting tent ’ s courtyard .
CEB	Leviticus	6	17	It must not be baked with leaven . I have made it the priests ’ share from my food gifts . It is most holy like the purification offering and the compensation offering .
CEB	Leviticus	6	18	Only the males from Aaron ’ s descendants can eat it as a permanent portion from the Lord ’ s food gifts throughout your future generations . Anything that touches these food gifts will become holy .
CEB	Leviticus	6	19	The Lord said to Moses ,
CEB	Leviticus	6	20	This is the offering that Aaron and his sons must present to the Lord on the day of his anointment : one-tenth of an ephah [ c ] of choice flour as a regular grain offering , half in the morning and half in the evening .
CEB	Leviticus	6	21	It must be prepared on a griddle with oil . You must bring it thoroughly mixed up and must present it as a grain offering of crumbled pieces [ d ] as a soothing smell to the Lord .
CEB	Leviticus	6	22	The priest who is anointed from among Aaron ’ s sons to succeed him will prepare the offering as a permanent portion for the Lord . It will be completely burned as a complete offering .
CEB	Leviticus	6	23	Every priestly grain offering must be a complete offering ; it must not be eaten .
CEB	Leviticus	6	24	The Lord said to Moses ,
CEB	Leviticus	6	25	Say to Aaron and his sons : This is the Instruction for the purification offering : The purification offering must be slaughtered before the Lord at the same place the entirely burned offering is slaughtered ; it is most holy .
CEB	Leviticus	6	26	The priest who offers it as a purification offering will eat it . It must be eaten in a holy place , in the meeting tent ’ s courtyard .
CEB	Leviticus	6	27	Anything that touches the purification offering ’ s flesh will become holy . If some of its blood splashes on a garment , you must wash the bloodied part in a holy place .
CEB	Leviticus	6	28	A pottery container in which the purification offering is cooked must be broken , but if it is cooked in a bronze container , that must be scrubbed and rinsed with water .
CEB	Leviticus	6	29	Any male priest can eat it ; it is most holy .
CEB	Leviticus	6	30	But no purification offering can be eaten if blood from it is brought into the meeting tent to make reconciliation in the holy place ; it must be burned with fire . Footnotes - Leviticus 6:1 5:20 in Heb - Leviticus 6:8 6:1 in Heb - Leviticus 6:20 Two quarts ; an ephah is approximately twenty quarts dry . - Leviticus 6:21 Heb uncertain
CEB	Leviticus	7	7	The compensation offering is like the purification offering—they share the same Instruction : It belongs to the priest who makes reconciliation with it .
CEB	Leviticus	7	2	The compensation offering must be slaughtered at the same place where the entirely burned offering is slaughtered , and its blood must be tossed against all sides of the altar .
CEB	Leviticus	7	3	All of its fat will be offered : the fat tail ; the fat that covers the insides ;
CEB	Leviticus	7	4	the two kidneys and the fat around them at the loins ; and the lobe on the liver , which must be removed with the kidneys .
CEB	Leviticus	7	5	The priest must burn them completely on the altar as a food gift for the Lord ; it is a compensation offering .
CEB	Leviticus	7	6	Any male priest can eat it . It must be eaten in a holy place ; it is most holy .
CEB	Leviticus	7	8	The hide of the entirely burned offering that a priest has offered belongs to the priest who offered it .
CEB	Leviticus	7	9	Any grain offering that is baked in an oven or that is prepared in a pan or on a griddle also belongs to the priest who offered it .
CEB	Leviticus	7	10	But every other grain offering , whether mixed with oil or dry , will belong to all of Aaron ’ s sons equally .
CEB	Leviticus	7	11	This is the Instruction for the communal sacrifice of well-being that someone may offer to the Lord :
CEB	Leviticus	7	12	If you are offering it for thanksgiving , you must offer the following with the communal sacrifice of thanksgiving : unleavened flatbread mixed with oil , unleavened thin loaves spread with oil , and flatbread of choice flour thoroughly mixed with oil .
CEB	Leviticus	7	13	You must present this offering , plus the leavened flatbread , with the communal thanksgiving sacrifice of well-being .
CEB	Leviticus	7	14	From this you will present one of each kind of offering as a gift to the Lord . It will belong to the priest who tosses the blood of the well-being offering .
CEB	Leviticus	7	15	The flesh of your communal thanksgiving sacrifice of well-being must be eaten on the day you offer it ; you can not save any of it until morning .
CEB	Leviticus	7	16	But if your communal sacrifice of well-being is payment for a solemn promise or if it is a spontaneous gift , it may be eaten on the day you offer it as your communal sacrifice , and whatever is left over can be eaten the next day .
CEB	Leviticus	7	17	But whatever is left over of the flesh of the communal sacrifice on the third day must be burned with fire .
CEB	Leviticus	7	18	If any of it is eaten on the third day , it will not be accepted . It will not be credited to the one who offered it . It will be considered foul , and the person who eats of it will be liable to punishment .
CEB	Leviticus	7	19	Flesh that touches any unclean thing must not be eaten ; it must be burned with fire . Any clean person may eat the flesh ,
CEB	Leviticus	7	20	but anyone who eats the flesh of a communal sacrifice of well-being that belongs to the Lord while in an unclean state will be cut off from their people .
CEB	Leviticus	7	21	Whenever anyone touches any unclean thing—whether it is human uncleanness , an unclean animal , or any unclean and disgusting creature—and then eats the flesh of a communal sacrifice of well-being that belongs to the Lord , that person will be cut off from their people .
CEB	Leviticus	7	22	The Lord said to Moses :
CEB	Leviticus	7	23	Tell the Israelites : You must not eat the fat of an ox , sheep , or goat .
CEB	Leviticus	7	24	The fat of an animal that has died naturally or the fat of an animal that was killed by another animal may be put to any use , but you must definitely not eat it .
CEB	Leviticus	7	25	If anyone eats the fat of an animal from which a food gift could be offered to the Lord , that person will be cut off from their people .
CEB	Leviticus	7	26	You must not consume any blood whatsoever—whether bird or animal blood—wherever you may live .
CEB	Leviticus	7	27	Any person who consumes any blood whatsoever will be cut off from their people .
CEB	Leviticus	7	28	The Lord said to Moses :
CEB	Leviticus	7	29	Say to the Israelites : If you wish to offer a communal sacrifice of well-being to the Lord , you are allowed to bring your offering to the Lord as your communal sacrifice of well-being . [ a ]
CEB	Leviticus	7	30	Your own hands must bring the Lord ’ s food gifts . You will bring the fat with the breast so that the breast can be lifted as an uplifted offering before the Lord .
CEB	Leviticus	7	31	The priest will completely burn the fat on the altar , but the breast will go to Aaron and his sons .
CEB	Leviticus	7	32	You will give the right thigh of your communal sacrifice of well-being to the priest as a gift .
CEB	Leviticus	7	33	The right thigh will belong to the son of Aaron who offers the blood and fat of the well-being offering .
CEB	Leviticus	7	34	I have taken the breast of the uplifted offering and the thigh that is given by the Israelites from their communal sacrifices of well-being , and have given them to Aaron the priest and to his sons as a permanent portion from the Israelites .
CEB	Leviticus	7	35	This is what Aaron and his sons are allotted from the Lord ’ s food gifts once they have been presented to serve the Lord as priests .
CEB	Leviticus	7	36	The Lord commanded that these things be given to the priests by the Israelites , following their anointment . It is their permanent portion throughout their future generations . Conclusion concerning offerings
CEB	Leviticus	7	37	This concludes the Instructions for the entirely burned offering , the grain offering , the purification offering , the compensation offering , the ordination offering , and the communal sacrifice of well-being ,
CEB	Leviticus	7	38	which the Lord commanded Moses at Mount Sinai on the day when he ordered the Israelites to present their offerings to the Lord , in the Sinai desert . Footnotes - Leviticus 7:29 Heb uncertain

CEB	Leviticus	8	14	Next Moses brought forward the bull for the purification offering . Aaron and his sons pressed their hands on its head .
CEB	Leviticus	8	15	Moses slaughtered it , then took the blood and , using his finger , put it on all of the altar ’ s horns , purifying the altar . He poured the rest of the blood out at the altar ’ s base . Then he made the altar holy so that reconciliation could be performed on it . [ b ]
CEB	Leviticus	8	16	Moses removed all the fat that was around the insides , the lobe of the liver , the two kidneys and their fat , and he completely burned it on the altar .
CEB	Leviticus	8	17	But the rest of the bull , including its hide , its flesh , and its dung , he burned with fire outside the camp just as the Lord had commanded him .
CEB	Leviticus	8	18	Then Moses presented the ram for the entirely burned offering , and Aaron and his sons pressed their hands on its head .
CEB	Leviticus	8	19	Moses slaughtered it , then tossed the blood against all sides of the altar .
CEB	Leviticus	8	20	He cut up the ram into pieces , and then completely burned the head , pieces , and fat .
CEB	Leviticus	8	21	After he washed the insides and lower legs with water , Moses completely burned the whole ram on the altar . It was an entirely burned offering for a soothing smell ; it was a food gift for the Lord , as the Lord had commanded Moses .
CEB	Leviticus	8	22	Moses then presented the second ram , the ram for ordination , and Aaron and his sons pressed their hands on its head .
CEB	Leviticus	8	23	Moses slaughtered it , then took some of its blood and put it on Aaron ’ s right earlobe , on his right thumb , and on his right big toe .

CEB	Leviticus	8	25	Then he took the fat—the fat tail , all the fat that was around the insides , the lobe of the liver , the two kidneys and their fat—as well as the right thigh .
CEB	Leviticus	8	26	From the basket of unleavened bread that was before the Lord , he took one loaf of unleavened flatbread , one loaf of flatbread made with oil , and one unleavened wafer , and he placed these on the fat pieces and on the right thigh .
CEB	Leviticus	8	27	Moses set all of this in Aaron ’ s and his sons ’ hands , then lifted them as an uplifted offering before the Lord .
CEB	Leviticus	8	28	Next Moses took this out of their hands and completely burned it on the altar , along with the entirely burned offering . This was an ordination offering for a soothing smell ; it was a food gift for the Lord .
CEB	Leviticus	8	29	Next Moses took the breast from the ram for the ordination offering and lifted it as an uplifted offering before the Lord . It belonged to Moses as his portion , just as the Lord had commanded him .
CEB	Leviticus	8	30	Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood that was on the altar and sprinkled it on Aaron and his clothes , and on his sons and their clothes as well . In this way , Moses made holy Aaron , his clothing , and Aaron ’ s sons and their clothing .

CEB	Leviticus	8	35	You must stay at the meeting tent ’ s entrance for seven days , day and night , observing the Lord ’ s requirement so you don ’ t die , because that ’ s what I was commanded. ”
CEB	Leviticus	8	36	Aaron and his sons did everything the Lord commanded through Moses . Footnotes - Leviticus 8:10 Or tabernacle - Leviticus 8:15 Or to make reconciliation for it ( i.e. , the altar ) - Leviticus 8:31 LXX , Syr , Tg ; cf 8:35 ; MT as I commanded
CEB	Leviticus	9	9	Then Aaron ’ s sons presented the blood to him , and he dipped his finger into the blood and put it on the altar ’ s horns . He poured the rest of the blood out at the altar ’ s base .
CEB	Leviticus	9	2	He said to Aaron , “ Take a young bull from the herd as a purification offering and a ram as an entirely burned offering , both flawless animals , and bring them before the Lord .
CEB	Leviticus	9	3	Then tell the Israelites , ‘ Take a male goat as a purification offering ; a young bull and a sheep—both one-year-old flawless animals—as an entirely burned offering ;
CEB	Leviticus	9	4	an ox and a ram as a well-being sacrifice before the Lord ; and a grain offering mixed with oil , because today the Lord will appear to you. ’ ”
CEB	Leviticus	9	5	They brought what Moses had commanded to the front of the meeting tent . Then the whole community came forward and stood before the Lord .
CEB	Leviticus	9	6	Moses said , “ The Lord has ordered you to do this so that the Lord ’ s glorious presence will appear to you. ”
CEB	Leviticus	9	7	Moses said to Aaron , “ Come up to the altar and perform your purification offering and your entirely burned offering , making reconciliation for yourself and the people . Then perform the people ’ s offering in order to make reconciliation for them , just as the Lord commanded. ”
CEB	Leviticus	9	8	Aaron went to the altar and slaughtered the young bull for his purification offering .
CEB	Leviticus	9	10	He completely burned on the altar the fat , kidneys , and lobe of the liver from the purification offering , just as the Lord commanded Moses .
CEB	Leviticus	9	11	But he burned the flesh and hide with fire outside the camp .
CEB	Leviticus	9	12	Then Aaron slaughtered the entirely burned offering . Aaron ’ s sons handed him the blood , and he tossed it against all sides of the altar .
CEB	Leviticus	9	13	They handed him the entirely burned offering in pieces , including the head , and he completely burned them on the altar .
CEB	Leviticus	9	14	Then he washed the insides and lower legs and completely burned them on the altar along with the rest of the entirely burned offering .
CEB	Leviticus	9	15	Next , Aaron presented the people ’ s offering . He took the male goat for the people ’ s purification offering , slaughtered it , and offered it as a purification offering like the first purification offering .
CEB	Leviticus	9	16	He presented the entirely burned offering and did with it according to the regulation .
CEB	Leviticus	9	17	Then he presented the grain offering , took a handful from it , and completely burned it on the altar , in addition to the morning ’ s entirely burned offering .
CEB	Leviticus	9	18	Aaron then slaughtered the ox and the ram—the people ’ s communal sacrifice of well-being . Aaron ’ s sons handed him the blood , which he tossed against all sides of the altar ,
CEB	Leviticus	9	19	and the fat pieces of the ox and ram—the fat tail , the covering fat , the kidneys , and the lobe of the liver .
CEB	Leviticus	9	20	They placed these fat pieces on the animals ’ breasts , and Aaron completely burned them on the altar .
CEB	Leviticus	9	21	But Aaron lifted up the breasts and the right thigh as an uplifted offering before the Lord , just as Moses had commanded .
CEB	Leviticus	9	22	Aaron then raised his hands toward the people and blessed them . After performing the purification offering , the entirely burned offering , and the well-being sacrifice , he came down .
CEB	Leviticus	9	23	Moses and Aaron then entered the meeting tent . When they came out , they blessed the people , and the Lord ’ s glorious presence appeared to all the people .
CEB	Leviticus	9	24	Fire flew out from before the Lord and devoured the entirely burned offering and the fat pieces on the altar . All the people saw it . They shouted for joy and fell facedown .
CEB	Leviticus	10	10	so that you can distinguish between the holy and the common , and between the unclean and the clean ,
CEB	Leviticus	10	2	Then fire flew out from before the Lord and devoured them , and they died before the Lord .
CEB	Leviticus	10	3	Moses said to Aaron , “ When the Lord said , ‘ I will show that I am holy among those near me , and before all the people I will manifest my glorious presence , ’ this is what he meant ! ” But Aaron was silent .
CEB	Leviticus	10	4	Then Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan the sons of Uzziel , Aaron ’ s uncle , and told them , “ Go carry your relatives out from the front of the sanctuary to a place outside the camp. ”
CEB	Leviticus	10	5	So they went forward and carried Nadab and Abihu out by their tunics to a place outside the camp , just as Moses had ordered .
CEB	Leviticus	10	6	Moses then said to Aaron and his sons , Eleazar and Ithamar , “ Don ’ t dishevel your hair and don ’ t rip your clothes into pieces , or you will die and bring anger upon the whole community . Your family—all of Israel ’ s house—will mourn the burning the Lord has done .
CEB	Leviticus	10	7	But you must not leave the meeting tent , or you will die because the Lord ’ s anointing oil is on you. ” So they did what Moses ordered . Priestly drinking and eating
CEB	Leviticus	10	8	The Lord said to Aaron :
CEB	Leviticus	10	9	Both you and your sons must not drink wine or beer when you enter the meeting tent so that you don ’ t die—this is a permanent rule throughout your future generations—
CEB	Leviticus	10	11	and so that you can teach the Israelites all the rules that the Lord spoke to them through Moses .
CEB	Leviticus	10	12	Moses then told Aaron and his remaining sons , Eleazar and Ithamar , “ Take the grain offering that is left over from the Lord ’ s food gifts and eat it unleavened next to the altar , because it is most holy .
CEB	Leviticus	10	13	You must eat it in a holy place because it is your portion and your sons ’ portion from the Lord ’ s food gifts , as I have been commanded .
CEB	Leviticus	10	14	You must eat the breast for the uplifted offering and the thigh for the gift offering in a clean place—both you and your sons and daughters . These things are designated as your portion and your children ’ s portion from the Israelites ’ communal sacrifices of well-being .
CEB	Leviticus	10	15	The Israelites must bring the thigh for the gift and the breast for the uplifted offering along with the food gifts of the fat pieces , to be lifted up as an uplifted offering before the Lord . These will belong to both you and your children as a permanent portion , just as the Lord has commanded. ”
CEB	Leviticus	10	16	Then Moses asked about the male goat for the purification offering , and discovered that it had already been burned . He was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar , Aaron ’ s remaining sons , and asked ,
CEB	Leviticus	10	17	“ Why didn ’ t you eat the purification offering in the holy area ? It ’ s most holy , and it was assigned to you for bearing the community ’ s punishment by making reconciliation for them before the Lord .
CEB	Leviticus	10	18	Since its blood wasn ’ t brought into the sanctuary ’ s interior , you were to have eaten it in the sanctuary , just as I was commanded. ” [ a ]
CEB	Leviticus	10	19	“ Look , ” Aaron said to Moses , “ today they offered their purification offerings and their entirely burned offerings before the Lord , but these things still happened to me ! Would the Lord have approved if I had eaten a purification offering today ? ”
CEB	Leviticus	10	20	When Moses heard that , he approved . [ b ] Footnotes - Leviticus 10:18 Syr , Tg , Vulg ; MT as I commanded ; cf 8:31 - Leviticus 10:20 Or he was satisfied .
CEB	Leviticus	11	11	and must remain so . You must not eat their flesh , and you must detest their dead bodies .
CEB	Leviticus	11	2	Say to the Israelites : These are the creatures that you are allowed to eat from the land animals :
CEB	Leviticus	11	3	You can eat any animal that has divided hoofs , completely split , and that rechews food .
CEB	Leviticus	11	4	But of animals that rechew food and have divided hoofs you must not eat the following : the camel—though it rechews food , it does not have divided hoofs , so it is unclean for you ;
CEB	Leviticus	11	5	the rock badger—though it rechews food , it does not have divided hoofs , so it is unclean for you ;
CEB	Leviticus	11	6	the hare—though it rechews food , it does not have divided hoofs , so it is unclean for you ;
CEB	Leviticus	11	7	the pig—though it has completely divided hoofs , it does not rechew food , so it is unclean for you .

CEB	Leviticus	11	9	You are allowed to eat the following from all water animals : You may eat anything in the water that has fins and scales , whether in sea or stream .
CEB	Leviticus	11	10	But anything in the seas or streams that does not have fins and scales—whether it be any of the swarming creatures in the water or any of the other living creatures in the water—is detestable to you
CEB	Leviticus	11	12	Anything in the water that does not have fins or scales is detestable to you .

CEB	Leviticus	11	21	but you can eat four-footed flying insects that have jointed legs above their feet with which they hop on the ground .
CEB	Leviticus	11	22	Of these you can eat the following : any kind of migrating locust , any kind of bald locust , any kind of cricket , and any kind of grasshopper .
CEB	Leviticus	11	23	But every other flying insect that has four feet is detestable to you . Unclean animals
CEB	Leviticus	11	24	You make yourself unclean by the following animals—whoever touches their dead bodies will be unclean until evening ,
CEB	Leviticus	11	25	and anyone who carries any part of their dead bodies must wash their clothes and will be unclean until evening :
CEB	Leviticus	11	26	All animals that have divided hoofs , but they are not completely split , and that do not rechew food are unclean for you—whoever touches them will be unclean .
CEB	Leviticus	11	27	Of all the animals that walk on four feet , the ones that walk on their paws are unclean for you—anyone who touches their dead bodies will be unclean until evening .
CEB	Leviticus	11	28	Anyone who carries one of their dead bodies must wash their clothes and will be unclean until evening ; these animals are unclean for you .
CEB	Leviticus	11	29	The following are unclean for you among the small creatures that move about on the ground : the rat , the mouse , any kind of large lizard ,
CEB	Leviticus	11	30	the gecko , the spotted lizard , the lizard , the skink , and the chameleon . [ b ]
CEB	Leviticus	11	31	Of all small moving creatures , these are unclean for you—anyone who touches them when they are dead will be unclean until evening .
CEB	Leviticus	11	32	Moreover , anything on which one of these creatures falls when it is dead will be unclean , whether it is wood , cloth , skin , or funeral clothing—any such item that can be used to do work . It must be put into water and will be unclean until evening . Then it will be clean again .
CEB	Leviticus	11	33	If any of these creatures fall into a pottery jar , everything inside it will be unclean ; you must smash the pot .
CEB	Leviticus	11	34	If water from such a jar gets on any edible food , it will be unclean ; any drinkable beverage in such a jar will be unclean .
CEB	Leviticus	11	35	Anything on which a part of these animals ’ dead bodies might fall will be unclean . If it is an oven or stove , it must be destroyed ; they are unclean for you and must remain that way .
CEB	Leviticus	11	36	Now , a spring or cistern that collects water is clean , but anyone who touches one of these animals ’ dead bodies in it will be unclean . [ c ]
CEB	Leviticus	11	37	If any part of these animals ’ dead bodies falls on seed that is to be planted , the seed is still clean .
CEB	Leviticus	11	38	But if water is poured on some seed and part of their dead bodies falls on it , it is unclean for you .
CEB	Leviticus	11	39	If one of the animals that you are allowed to eat dies naturally , anyone who touches its dead body will be unclean until evening .
CEB	Leviticus	11	40	Anyone who eats from the dead body must wash their clothes and will be unclean until evening . Anyone who carries such a dead body must wash their clothes and will be unclean until evening .
CEB	Leviticus	11	41	Every creature that swarms on the earth is detestable ; it must not be eaten .
CEB	Leviticus	11	42	Among all such creatures that swarm on the earth , you must not eat anything that moves on its belly or anything that walks on four or more feet because they are detestable .

CEB	Leviticus	12	12	The Lord said to Moses :
CEB	Leviticus	12	2	Say to the Israelites : If a woman conceives a child and gives birth to a son , she will be unclean for seven days—just as she is during her menstrual period .
CEB	Leviticus	12	3	On the eighth day , the flesh of the boy ’ s foreskin must be circumcised .
CEB	Leviticus	12	4	For thirty-three days the mother will be in a state of blood purification . She must not touch anything holy or enter the sacred area until her time of purification is completed .
CEB	Leviticus	12	5	But if the woman gives birth to a daughter , she will be unclean for two weeks—just as she is during her menstrual period—and will be in a state of blood purification [ a ] for sixty-six days .
CEB	Leviticus	12	6	When the time of purification is complete , whether for a son or a daughter , the mother must bring a one-year-old lamb as an entirely burned offering and a pigeon or turtledove as a purification offering to the priest at the meeting tent ’ s entrance .
CEB	Leviticus	12	7	The priest will present it before the Lord and make reconciliation for her . She will then be cleansed from her blood flow . This is the Instruction for any woman who has a child , male or female .

The priest will then make reconciliation for her , and she will be clean . Footnotes - Leviticus 12:5 Heb uncertain
CEB	Leviticus	13	13	then the priest will make an examination . If the skin disease has covered the person ’ s whole body , the priest will declare the infected person clean . The person has turned entirely white ; he is clean .
CEB	Leviticus	13	2	When a person has a swelling , a scab , or a shiny spot on their skin , and it becomes an infection of skin disease [ a ] on their skin , they will be brought to the priests , either to Aaron or one of his sons .
CEB	Leviticus	13	3	The priest will examine the infection on the skin . If hair in the infected area has turned white and the infection appears to be deeper than the skin , then it is an infection of skin disease . Once the priest sees this , he will declare the person unclean .
CEB	Leviticus	13	4	But if the shiny spot on the skin is white and does not appear to be deeper than the skin and the hair has not turned white , the priest will quarantine the infected person for seven days .
CEB	Leviticus	13	5	On the seventh day the priest will again examine the infection . If he sees that it has remained the same—the infection has not spread on the skin—the priest will quarantine the person for seven more days .
CEB	Leviticus	13	6	On the seventh day the priest will examine it again . If the infection has faded and has not spread over the skin , the priest will declare the person clean ; it is just a rash . The person must wash their clothes , then they will be clean again .
CEB	Leviticus	13	7	But if the rash continues to spread over the skin after they appeared before the priest for purification , they must again show themselves to the priest .
CEB	Leviticus	13	8	If the priest sees that the rash has spread over the skin , the priest will declare the person unclean ; it is a case of skin disease .
CEB	Leviticus	13	9	Whenever someone has an infection of skin disease , they will be brought to the priest .
CEB	Leviticus	13	10	If the priest sees that there is a white swelling on the skin , it has turned the hair white , and there is a patch of raw flesh in the swelling ,
CEB	Leviticus	13	11	then it is a case of chronic skin disease on their skin . The priest will declare the person unclean . The priest will not quarantine such persons , because they are already unclean .
CEB	Leviticus	13	12	But if the skin disease continues to break out so that the disease covers all of the infected person ’ s skin from head to toe , as far as the priest can tell—
CEB	Leviticus	13	14	But as soon as raw flesh appears in the swelling , they will be unclean .
CEB	Leviticus	13	15	When the priest sees the raw flesh , he will declare the person unclean . Raw flesh is unclean ; it is a case of skin disease .
CEB	Leviticus	13	16	But if the raw flesh turns white again , the person will go back to the priest .
CEB	Leviticus	13	17	The priest will examine it . If the infection has turned white , the priest will declare the infected person clean ; at that point , the person is clean .
CEB	Leviticus	13	18	Whenever someone has a boil on their skin , it heals ,
CEB	Leviticus	13	19	and in place of the boil there is a white swelling or reddish-white shiny spot , it must be shown to the priest .
CEB	Leviticus	13	20	If the priest sees that it appears to be lower than the skin , and its hair has turned white , the priest will declare the person unclean . It is an infection of skin disease that has broken out in the boil .
CEB	Leviticus	13	21	But if the priest examines it and there is no white hair in it , it is not lower than the skin , and it is faded , the priest will quarantine the person seven days .
CEB	Leviticus	13	22	If it continues to spread over the skin , the priest will declare the person unclean ; it is an infection .
CEB	Leviticus	13	23	But if the shiny spot remains where it was and does not spread , it is just a scar from the boil . The priest will declare the person clean .
CEB	Leviticus	13	24	Whenever there is a burn on someone ’ s skin , and the raw patch of the burn becomes a reddish-white or white shiny spot ,
CEB	Leviticus	13	25	the priest will examine it . If the hair has turned white in the shiny spot , and it appears to be deeper than the skin , it is a case of skin disease that has broken out in the burn . The priest will declare the person unclean ; it is an infection of skin disease .
CEB	Leviticus	13	26	But if the priest examines it , and there is no white hair in the shiny spot , it is not lower than the skin , and it is faded , the priest will quarantine the person seven days .
CEB	Leviticus	13	27	On the seventh day the priest will again examine it . If it has continued to spread over the skin , the priest will declare the person unclean ; it is an infection of skin disease .
CEB	Leviticus	13	28	But if the shiny spot remains where it was , has not spread over the skin , and is faded , it is just swelling from the burn . The priest will declare the person clean , because it is just the scar from the burn .
CEB	Leviticus	13	29	Whenever a man or woman has an infection , whether on the head or in the beard ,
CEB	Leviticus	13	30	the priest will examine it . If it appears to be deeper than the skin , and there is thin yellow hair in it , the priest will declare the person unclean ; it is a case of scabies—a skin disease of the head or beard .
CEB	Leviticus	13	31	When the priest examines the scabies infection , if it does not appear to be deeper than the skin , but there is no black hair in it , the priest will quarantine the person with the scabies infection for seven days .
CEB	Leviticus	13	32	On the seventh day the priest will examine the infection again . If the scabies has not spread , there is no yellow hair in it , and it does not appear to be deeper than the skin ,
CEB	Leviticus	13	33	the person must shave the area , without shaving the scabies . The priest will then quarantine that person another seven days .
CEB	Leviticus	13	34	On the seventh day the priest will again examine the scabies . If it has not spread over the skin and does not appear to be deeper than the skin , the priest will declare the person clean . They must wash their clothes ; then they will be clean again .
CEB	Leviticus	13	35	But if the scabies continues to spread over the skin after the person ’ s purification ,
CEB	Leviticus	13	36	the priest must examine it again . If the scabies has spread over the skin at all , the priest does not need to look for the yellow hair ; the person is unclean .
CEB	Leviticus	13	37	But if the priest sees that the scabies has remained the same , and black hair has grown in it , the scabies has healed . The person is clean , and the priest will declare them to be so .
CEB	Leviticus	13	38	Whenever a man or woman has many white shiny spots on their skin ,
CEB	Leviticus	13	39	if the priest sees that there are faded white shiny spots on the skin of the body , it is just a rash that has broken out on the skin ; the person is clean .
CEB	Leviticus	13	40	If someone loses their hair , they are bald , but they are clean .
CEB	Leviticus	13	41	If the hair is lost at the sides of the forehead , the person has a receding hairline , but they are clean .
CEB	Leviticus	13	42	But whenever there is a reddish-white infection in the bald spot or in the receding hairline , it is a case of skin disease breaking out there .
CEB	Leviticus	13	43	The priest must examine it . If the swelling of the infection is reddish white in the bald spot or receding hairline and resembles skin disease on the body ,
CEB	Leviticus	13	44	the person is afflicted with skin disease ; they are unclean . The priest must declare them unclean on account of the head infection .
CEB	Leviticus	13	45	Anyone with an infection of skin disease must wear torn clothes , dishevel their hair , cover their upper lip , and shout out , “ Unclean ! Unclean ! ”
CEB	Leviticus	13	46	They will be unclean as long as they are infected . They are unclean . They must live alone outside the camp . Articles with skin disease
CEB	Leviticus	13	47	Whenever there is an infection of skin disease on clothing—on wool or linen clothing ,
CEB	Leviticus	13	48	in the weaving of the linen or wool , or on a skin or skin item—
CEB	Leviticus	13	49	and the infection is greenish or reddish on the clothing , the weaving , or the skin or skin item , it is an infection of skin disease . It must be shown to the priest .
CEB	Leviticus	13	50	The priest will examine the infection and quarantine the infected item seven days .
CEB	Leviticus	13	51	On the seventh day he will examine the infection again . If the infection has spread in the clothing , the weaving , or the skin , whatever it is used for , the infection is a case of infectious skin disease ; the item is unclean .
CEB	Leviticus	13	52	The priest will burn the clothing , the weaving of the wool or linen , or whatever skin item in which the infection was found , because it is an infectious skin disease ; it must be burned with fire .
CEB	Leviticus	13	53	But if the priest sees that the infection has not spread in the clothing , the weaving , or on any skin item ,
CEB	Leviticus	13	54	the priest will order that the infected piece be washed , and he will quarantine it for another seven days .
CEB	Leviticus	13	55	After it has been washed , if the priest sees that the infection has not changed its appearance , even though the infection has not spread , it is unclean . You must burn it with fire . It is a fungus , [ b ] whether it is on the inside or outside .
CEB	Leviticus	13	56	But if , after it is washed , the priest sees that the infection has faded , he will tear the infected part out of the cloth , the weaving , or the skin .
CEB	Leviticus	13	57	If it appears again in the cloth , the weaving , or any item of skin , it is starting to break out . You must burn the infected item with fire .
CEB	Leviticus	13	58	But if the infection disappears from the cloth , the weaving , or any item of skin that you washed , it must be washed again . Then it will be clean .
CEB	Leviticus	13	59	This concludes the Instruction about the infection of skin disease in a woolen or linen cloth , weaving , or any skin item , in order to declare whether it is clean or unclean .

CEB	Leviticus	14	2	This will be the Instruction for anyone with skin disease [ a ] at the time of purification : When it has been reported to the priest ,
CEB	Leviticus	14	3	he will go outside the camp . If the priest sees that the person afflicted with skin disease has been healed of the infection ,
CEB	Leviticus	14	4	the priest will order that two birds—wild [ b ] and clean—and cedarwood , crimson yarn , and hyssop be brought for the person who needs purification .
CEB	Leviticus	14	5	The priest will order that one bird be slaughtered over fresh water in a pottery jar .
CEB	Leviticus	14	6	He will then take the other wild bird , along with the cedarwood , crimson yarn , and hyssop , and will dip all of this into the blood of the bird that was slaughtered over the fresh water .
CEB	Leviticus	14	7	He will sprinkle the person who needs purification from skin disease seven times and declare that they are clean . Then the priest will release the wild bird into the countryside .
CEB	Leviticus	14	8	The person who needs purification will then wash their clothes , shave off all of their hair , and bathe in water ; at that point , they will be clean . After that , they can return to the camp , but they must live outside their tent for seven days .
CEB	Leviticus	14	9	On the seventh day , the person must shave off all their hair again : head , beard , and eyebrows—everything . They must wash their clothes and bathe in water ; then they will be clean again .

CEB	Leviticus	14	11	The priest performing the purification will place these and the person needing purification before the Lord at the meeting tent ’ s entrance .
CEB	Leviticus	14	12	The priest will take one of the male sheep and present it as a compensation offering , along with the log of oil , and will lift them as an uplifted offering before the Lord .
CEB	Leviticus	14	13	The priest will slaughter the sheep at the same place where the purification offering and the entirely burned offering are slaughtered : in the holy area . The compensation offering , like the purification offering , belongs to the priest ; it is most holy .
CEB	Leviticus	14	15	,
CEB	Leviticus	14	16	The priest will then dip his right finger into the oil and sprinkle some of it with his finger seven times before the Lord .
CEB	Leviticus	14	17	Then the priest will put some of the oil that is left in his hand on the right earlobe , the right thumb , and the right big toe of the person needing purification—this oil will be placed on top of the blood of the compensation offering .
CEB	Leviticus	14	18	The priest will put whatever is left of the oil in his hand on the head of the person needing purification . In this way , the priest will make reconciliation for the person before the Lord .
CEB	Leviticus	14	19	The priest will then perform the purification offering and make reconciliation for the person needing purification from their uncleanness . After that , the entirely burned offering will be slaughtered .
CEB	Leviticus	14	20	The priest will offer up the entirely burned offering and the grain offering on the altar . In this way , the priest will make reconciliation for the person , and they will be clean again .
CEB	Leviticus	14	21	,
CEB	Leviticus	14	22	and two turtledoves or two pigeons , whatever they can afford—one as a purification offering and the other as an entirely burned offering .
CEB	Leviticus	14	23	On the eighth day , they must bring these items for their purification to the priest at the meeting tent ’ s entrance before the Lord .
CEB	Leviticus	14	24	- Leviticus 14:31 LXX , Syr ; MT repeats whatever they can afford at the beginning of 14:31 . - Leviticus 14:51 Or live or healthy
CEB	Leviticus	14	25	The priest will slaughter the sheep for the compensation offering and will take some of its blood and put it on the right earlobe , the right thumb , and the right big toe of the person needing purification .

CEB	Leviticus	14	29	The priest will put whatever is left of the oil in his hand on the head of the person needing purification , to make reconciliation for them before the Lord .
CEB	Leviticus	14	30	The person will then offer one of the turtledoves or pigeons , whatever they can afford—
CEB	Leviticus	14	31	one as a purification offering and the other as an entirely burned offering along with the grain offering . [ e ] In this way , the priest will make reconciliation before the Lord for the person needing purification .

CEB	Leviticus	14	33	The Lord said to Moses and Aaron :
CEB	Leviticus	14	34	When you enter the land of Canaan , which I am giving to you as a possession , and I put an infection of skin disease on a house in the land you possess ,
CEB	Leviticus	14	35	the homeowner must come and tell the priest , “ I think some sort of infection is in my house. ”
CEB	Leviticus	14	36	The priest will order that the house be emptied before he comes to examine it so that nothing else in the house will become unclean . After that , the priest will come to examine the house .
CEB	Leviticus	14	37	If he examines the infection , and the infection in the walls of the house consists of greenish or reddish depressions , which appear to be deeper than the surface of the wall ,
CEB	Leviticus	14	38	the priest will exit the house , go to the front door , and quarantine the house for seven days .
CEB	Leviticus	14	39	On the seventh day , the priest will return . If he finds that the infection has spread over the walls of the house ,
CEB	Leviticus	14	40	the priest will order the stones in which the infection is found to be pulled out and discarded outside the city in an unclean area .
CEB	Leviticus	14	41	The inside of the house will then be scraped on all sides , and the plaster that has been scraped off must be dumped outside the city in an unclean area .
CEB	Leviticus	14	42	Then different stones will be used in place of the first ones , and new coating will be used to replaster the house .
CEB	Leviticus	14	43	If the infection breaks out again in the house after the stones have been pulled out and the house scraped and replastered ,
CEB	Leviticus	14	44	the priest will return . If he finds that the infection has spread throughout the house , it is a case of infectious skin disease in the house ; the house is unclean .

CEB	Leviticus	14	49	To cleanse the house , the priest will take two birds , cedarwood , crimson yarn , and hyssop .
CEB	Leviticus	14	50	He will slaughter one bird over fresh water in a pottery jar .
CEB	Leviticus	14	51	He will then take the cedarwood , hyssop , and crimson yarn , along with the wild [ f ] bird , and will dip all of this into the fresh water and into the blood of the bird that was slaughtered . He will then sprinkle the house seven times .
CEB	Leviticus	14	52	In this way , the priest will cleanse the house with the blood of the bird , the fresh water , the wild bird , the cedarwood , the hyssop , and the crimson yarn .
CEB	Leviticus	14	53	Then he will release the wild bird outside the city into the countryside . In this way , he will make reconciliation for the house , and it will be clean . Conclusion concerning skin disease
CEB	Leviticus	14	54	This concludes the Instruction concerning every infection of skin disease : for scabies ,
CEB	Leviticus	14	55	for skin disease on clothing or in houses ,
CEB	Leviticus	14	56	and for swelling , scabs , or shiny spots ,

CEB	Leviticus	15	2	Speak to the Israelites and say to them : Whenever a man has a genital emission , that emission is unclean .

CEB	Leviticus	15	25	Whenever a woman has a bloody discharge for a long time , which is not during her menstrual period , or whenever she has a discharge beyond her menstrual period , the duration of her unclean discharge will be like the period of her menstruation ; she will be unclean .
CEB	Leviticus	15	26	Any bed she lies on during the discharge should be treated like the bed she uses during her menstruation ; and any object she sits on will be unclean , as during her menstruation .
CEB	Leviticus	15	27	Anyone who touches these things will be unclean . They must wash their clothes , bathe in water , and will be unclean until evening .

CEB	Leviticus	16	16	In this way , he will make reconciliation for the inner holy area because of the pollution of the Israelites and because of their rebellious sins , as well as for all their other sins . Aaron must do the same for the meeting tent , which is with them among their pollution .
CEB	Leviticus	16	2	Tell your brother Aaron that he can not come whenever he wants into the holy area inside the inner curtain , to the front of the cover [ a ] that is on the chest , or else he will die , because I am present [ b ] in the cloud above the cover .
CEB	Leviticus	16	3	No , but Aaron must enter the holy area as follows : with a bull from the herd as a purification offering and a ram as an entirely burned offering .
CEB	Leviticus	16	4	Aaron must dress in a holy linen tunic and wear linen undergarments on his body . He must tie a linen sash around himself and wrap a linen turban around his head . These are holy clothes—Aaron will first bathe his body in water and then put them on .

CEB	Leviticus	16	6	Aaron will offer the bull as a purification offering to make reconciliation for himself and his household .

CEB	Leviticus	16	8	Aaron will cast lots over the two goats : one lot labeled “ the Lord ’ s ” and the other lot labeled “ Azazel ’ s. ” [ c ]
CEB	Leviticus	16	9	Aaron will present the goat selected by the Lord ’ s lot and perform a purification offering with it .
CEB	Leviticus	16	10	But the goat selected by Azazel ’ s lot will be left standing alive before the Lord in order to make reconciliation upon it [ d ] by sending it away into the wilderness to Azazel .
CEB	Leviticus	16	11	Aaron will offer the bull for his purification offering to make reconciliation for himself and his household . He will slaughter the bull for his purification offering .
CEB	Leviticus	16	12	Then he will take an incense pan full of burning coals from the altar , from before the Lord , and two handfuls of finely ground perfumed incense and bring them inside the inner curtain .
CEB	Leviticus	16	13	He will put the incense on the fire before the Lord so that the cloud of incense conceals the cover that is on top of the covenant document , or else he will die .
CEB	Leviticus	16	14	He will take some of the bull ’ s blood and sprinkle it with his finger on the cover from the east side . He will then sprinkle some of the blood with his finger seven times in front of the cover .
CEB	Leviticus	16	15	Then he will slaughter the goat for the people ’ s purification offering , bring the blood inside the inner curtain , and do with it as he did with the bull ’ s blood : he will sprinkle it on the cover and in front of the cover .
CEB	Leviticus	16	17	No one can be in the meeting tent from the time Aaron enters to make reconciliation in the inner holy area until the time he comes out . He will make reconciliation for himself , for his household , and for the whole assembly of Israel .
CEB	Leviticus	16	18	Aaron will then go to the altar that is before the Lord and make reconciliation for it : He will take some of the bull ’ s blood and some of the goat ’ s blood and put it on each of the altar ’ s horns .
CEB	Leviticus	16	19	He will sprinkle some of the blood on the altar with his finger seven times . In this way , he will purify it and make it holy again from the Israelites ’ pollution .
CEB	Leviticus	16	20	When Aaron has finished reconciling the inner holy area , the rest of the meeting tent , and the altar , he will bring forward the live goat .
CEB	Leviticus	16	21	Aaron will press both his hands on its head and confess over it all the Israelites ’ offenses and all their rebellious sins , as well as all their other sins , putting all these on the goat ’ s head . Then he will send it away into the wilderness with someone designated for the job . [ e ]
CEB	Leviticus	16	22	The goat will carry on itself all their offenses to a desolate region , then the goat will be released into the wild .
CEB	Leviticus	16	23	After this , Aaron will enter the meeting tent , take off the linen clothes he was wearing when he entered the inner holy area , and will leave them there .
CEB	Leviticus	16	24	He will bathe his body in water in a holy place and dress in his priestly clothing . Then he will go out and perform the entirely burned offerings for himself and for the people . In this way , he will make reconciliation for himself and for the people .
CEB	Leviticus	16	25	He will completely burn the fat of the purification offering on the altar .
CEB	Leviticus	16	26	The one who set the goat free for Azazel must wash their clothes and bathe their body in water ; after that they can return to the camp .

CEB	Leviticus	16	28	The person who burns them must wash their clothes and bathe their body in water ; after that , they can return to the camp .
CEB	Leviticus	16	29	This will be a permanent rule for you : On the tenth day of the seventh month , [ f ] you must deny yourselves . You must not do any work—neither the citizen nor the immigrant who lives among you .

CEB	Leviticus	17	5	This will make the Israelites bring the communal sacrifices , which they are sacrificing in the countryside , to the Lord , to the priest at the meeting tent ’ s entrance , and sacrifice them as communal sacrifices of well-being to the Lord .
CEB	Leviticus	17	6	The priest will toss the blood against the Lord ’ s altar at the meeting tent ’ s entrance and burn the fat completely as a soothing smell to the Lord .

CEB	Leviticus	17	13	Anyone who hunts any animal or bird that can be eaten—whether the hunter is an Israelite or an immigrant who lives with you—must drain its blood out and cover it with dirt .

CEB	Leviticus	22	24	You must not offer to the Lord anything with bruised , crushed , torn , or cut-off testicles . You must not do that in your land .
CEB	Leviticus	22	25	You are not allowed to offer such animals as your God ’ s food even if they come from a foreigner . Because these animals have blemishes and imperfections in them , they will not be acceptable on your behalf . Additional rules for sacrifice
CEB	Leviticus	22	26	The Lord said to Moses :
CEB	Leviticus	22	27	When an ox or sheep or goat is born , it must remain with its mother for seven days . From the eighth day on it will be acceptable as an offering , a food gift for the Lord .
CEB	Leviticus	22	28	But you will not slaughter an ox or sheep and its offspring on the same day .
CEB	Leviticus	22	29	When you sacrifice a communal sacrifice of thanksgiving for the Lord , you must sacrifice it so that it will be acceptable on your behalf .
CEB	Leviticus	22	30	It must be eaten on the same day ; you must not leave any of it until morning ; I am the Lord .
CEB	Leviticus	22	31	You must keep my commands and do them ; I am the Lord .
CEB	Leviticus	22	32	You must not make my holy name impure so that I will be treated as holy by the Israelites . I am the Lord—the one who makes you holy
CEB	Leviticus	22	33	and who is bringing you out of the land of Egypt to be your God ; I am the Lord . Footnotes - Leviticus 22:4 The precise meaning is uncertain ; traditionally leprosy—a term used for several different skin diseases . - Leviticus 22:9 Vulg ; MT and die in it
CEB	Leviticus	23	23	The Lord said to Moses :
CEB	Leviticus	23	2	Speak to the Israelites and say to them : These are my appointed times , the Lord ’ s appointed times , which you will declare to be holy occasions :
CEB	Leviticus	23	3	Work can be done for six days , but the seventh day is a Sabbath of special rest , a holy occasion . You must not do any work on it ; wherever you live , it is a Sabbath to the Lord .
CEB	Leviticus	23	4	These are the Lord ’ s appointed times , holy occasions , which you will celebrate at their appointed times :
CEB	Leviticus	23	5	The Lord ’ s Passover is on the fourteenth day of the first month [ a ] at twilight .
CEB	Leviticus	23	6	The Lord ’ s Festival of Unleavened Bread is on the fifteenth day of the same month . You must eat unleavened bread for seven days .
CEB	Leviticus	23	7	On the first day you will hold a holy occasion and must not do any job-related work .
CEB	Leviticus	23	8	You will offer food gifts to the Lord for seven days . The seventh day will be a holy occasion ; you must not do any job-related work .
CEB	Leviticus	23	9	The Lord said to Moses :
CEB	Leviticus	23	10	Speak to the Israelites and say to them : When you enter the land that I am giving you and harvest its produce , you must bring the first bundle of your harvest to the priest .
CEB	Leviticus	23	11	The priest will lift up the bundle before the Lord so that it will be acceptable on your behalf . The priest will do this on the day after the Sabbath .
CEB	Leviticus	23	12	On the day the bundle is lifted up for you , you must offer a flawless one-year-old lamb as an entirely burned offering to the Lord .
CEB	Leviticus	23	13	The accompanying grain offering must be two-tenths of an ephah [ b ] of choice flour mixed with oil , as a food gift for the Lord , a soothing smell . The accompanying drink offering must be a quarter of a hin of wine .
CEB	Leviticus	23	14	You must not eat any bread , roasted grain , or fresh grain until the exact day when you bring your God ’ s offering . This is a permanent rule throughout your future generations , wherever you live .
CEB	Leviticus	23	15	You must count off seven weeks starting with the day after the Sabbath , the day you bring the bundle for the uplifted offering ; these must be complete .
CEB	Leviticus	23	16	You will count off fifty days until the day after the seventh Sabbath . Then you must present a new grain offering to the Lord .
CEB	Leviticus	23	17	From wherever you live , you will bring two loaves of bread as an uplifted offering . These must be made of two-tenths of an ephah of choice flour , baked with leaven , as early produce [ c ] to the Lord .
CEB	Leviticus	23	18	Along with the bread you must present seven flawless one-year-old lambs , one bull from the herd , and two rams . These will be an entirely burned offering to the Lord , along with their grain offerings and drink offerings , as a food gift of soothing smell to the Lord .
CEB	Leviticus	23	19	You must also offer one male goat as a purification offering and two one-year-old lambs as a communal sacrifice of well-being .
CEB	Leviticus	23	20	The priest will lift up the two sheep , along with the bread of the early produce , as an uplifted offering before the Lord . These will be holy to the Lord and will belong to the priest .
CEB	Leviticus	23	21	On that very same day you must make a proclamation ; it will be a holy occasion for you . You must not do any job-related work . This is a permanent rule wherever you live throughout your future generations .
CEB	Leviticus	23	22	When you harvest your land ’ s produce , you must not harvest all the way to the edge of your field ; and don ’ t gather every remaining bit of your harvest . Leave these items for the poor and the immigrant ; I am the Lord your God .
CEB	Leviticus	23	24	Say to the Israelites : On the first day of the seventh month , [ d ] you will have a special rest , a holy occasion marked by a trumpet signal .
CEB	Leviticus	23	25	You must not do any job-related work , and you must offer a food gift to the Lord .
CEB	Leviticus	23	26	The Lord said to Moses :
CEB	Leviticus	23	27	Note that the tenth day of this seventh month is the Day of Reconciliation . It will be a holy occasion for you . You must deny yourselves and offer a food gift to the Lord .
CEB	Leviticus	23	28	You must not do any work that day because it is a Day of Reconciliation to make reconciliation for you before the Lord your God .
CEB	Leviticus	23	29	Anyone who does not deny themselves on that day will be cut off from their people .
CEB	Leviticus	23	30	Moreover , I will destroy from their people anyone who does any work on that day .
CEB	Leviticus	23	31	You must not do any work ! This is a permanent rule throughout your future generations wherever you live .
CEB	Leviticus	23	32	This is a Sabbath of special rest for you , and you must deny yourselves . You will observe your Sabbath on the ninth day of the month from evening to the following evening .
CEB	Leviticus	23	33	,
CEB	Leviticus	23	34	Say to the Israelites : The Festival of Booths to the Lord will start on the fifteenth day of the seventh month and will last for seven days .
CEB	Leviticus	23	35	The first day is a holy occasion . You must not do any job-related work .
CEB	Leviticus	23	36	For seven days you will offer food gifts to the Lord . On the eighth day you will have a holy occasion and must offer a food gift to the Lord . It is a holiday : you must not do any job-related work .
CEB	Leviticus	23	37	These are the Lord ’ s appointed times that you will proclaim as holy occasions , offering food gifts to the Lord : entirely burned offerings , grain offerings , communal sacrifices , and drink offerings—each on its proper day .
CEB	Leviticus	23	38	This is in addition to the Lord ’ s sabbaths and in addition to your presents , all the payments for solemn promises , and all the spontaneous gifts that you give to the Lord .
CEB	Leviticus	23	39	,
CEB	Leviticus	23	40	On the first day you must take fruit from majestic trees , [ e ] palm branches , branches of leafy trees , [ f ] and willows of the streams , and rejoice before the Lord your God for seven days .
CEB	Leviticus	23	41	- Leviticus 23:40 Or hadar trees - Leviticus 23:40 Heb uncertain
CEB	Leviticus	23	42	For seven days you must live in huts . Every citizen of Israel must live in huts
CEB	Leviticus	23	43	so that your future generations will know that I made the Israelites live in huts when I brought them out of the land of Egypt ; I am the Lord your God .
CEB	Leviticus	23	44	So Moses announced the Lord ’ s appointed times to the Israelites . Footnotes - Leviticus 23:5 March–April , Nisan - Leviticus 23:13 Four quarts dry ; also in 23:17 - Leviticus 23:17 Or firstfruits ; also in 23:20 - Leviticus 23:24 September–October , Tishrei ; also in 23:27 ,
CEB	Leviticus	24	24	The Lord said to Moses :
CEB	Leviticus	24	2	Command the Israelites to bring pure , pressed olive oil to you for the lamp , to keep a light burning constantly .
CEB	Leviticus	24	3	Aaron will tend the lamp , which will be inside the meeting tent but outside the inner curtain of the covenant document , from evening until morning before the Lord . This is a permanent rule throughout your future generations .
CEB	Leviticus	24	4	Aaron must continually tend the lights on the pure lampstand [ a ] before the Lord .
CEB	Leviticus	24	5	You will take choice flour and bake twelve loaves of flatbread , two-tenths of an ephah [ b ] for each loaf .
CEB	Leviticus	24	6	You must place them in two stacks , six in a stack , on the pure table [ c ] before the Lord .
CEB	Leviticus	24	7	Put pure frankincense on each stack , as a token portion for the bread ; it is a food gift for the Lord .
CEB	Leviticus	24	8	Aaron will always set it out before the Lord , Sabbath after Sabbath , on behalf of [ d ] the Israelites , as a permanent covenant .
CEB	Leviticus	24	9	It will belong to Aaron and his sons . They must eat it in a holy place because it is the most holy part of their share of the Lord ’ s food gifts , a permanent portion . Assault and blasphemy
CEB	Leviticus	24	10	The son of an Israelite mother and an Egyptian father came out among the Israelites . A fight broke out between this half-Israelite [ e ] and another Israelite man in the camp ,
CEB	Leviticus	24	11	during which the half-Israelite blasphemed the Lord ’ s name and cursed . So he was brought to Moses . ( His mother ’ s name was Shelomith , Dibri ’ s daughter from the tribe of Dan . )
CEB	Leviticus	24	12	He was put under guard until they could determine the Lord ’ s verdict .
CEB	Leviticus	24	13	Then the Lord said to Moses :
CEB	Leviticus	24	14	Take the one who cursed outside the camp . All who heard him will press their hands on his head . Then the whole community will stone him .
CEB	Leviticus	24	15	Tell the Israelites : Anyone who curses God will be liable to punishment .
CEB	Leviticus	24	16	And anyone who blasphemes the Lord ’ s name must be executed . The whole community will stone that person . Immigrant and citizen alike : whenever someone blasphemes the Lord ’ s name , that person will be executed .
CEB	Leviticus	24	17	If anyone kills another person , they must be executed .
CEB	Leviticus	24	18	Someone who kills an animal may make amends for it : a life for a life .
CEB	Leviticus	24	19	If someone injures a fellow citizen , they will suffer the same injury they inflicted :
CEB	Leviticus	24	20	broken bone for broken bone , an eye for an eye , a tooth for a tooth . The same injury the person inflicted on the other will be inflicted on them .
CEB	Leviticus	24	21	Someone who kills an animal must make amends for it , but whoever kills a human being must be executed .
CEB	Leviticus	24	22	There is but one law on this matter for you , immigrant or citizen alike , because I am the Lord your God .
CEB	Leviticus	24	23	Moses told this to the Israelites . So they took the one who had cursed outside the camp and stoned him . The Israelites did just as the Lord commanded Moses .

CEB	Leviticus	25	25	When one of your fellow Israelites faces financial difficulty and must sell part of their family property , the closest relative [ d ] will come and buy back what their fellow Israelite has sold .
CEB	Leviticus	25	2	Speak to the Israelites and say to them : Once you enter the land that I am giving you , the land must celebrate a sabbath rest to the Lord .
CEB	Leviticus	25	3	You will plant your fields for six years , and prune your vineyards and gather their crops for six years .
CEB	Leviticus	25	4	But in the seventh year the land will have a special sabbath rest , a Sabbath to the Lord : You must not plant your fields or prune your vineyards .
CEB	Leviticus	25	5	You must not harvest the secondary growth of your produce or gather the grapes of your freely growing vines . It will be a year of special rest for the land .
CEB	Leviticus	25	6	Whatever the land produces during its sabbath will be your food—for you , for your male and female servants , and for your hired laborers and foreign guests who live with you ,
CEB	Leviticus	25	7	as well as for your livestock and for the wild animals in your land . All of the land ’ s produce can be eaten . The Jubilee year
CEB	Leviticus	25	8	Count off seven weeks of years—that is , seven times seven—so that the seven weeks of years totals forty-nine years .
CEB	Leviticus	25	9	Then have the trumpet [ a ] blown on the tenth day of the seventh month . [ b ] Have the trumpet blown throughout your land on the Day of Reconciliation .
CEB	Leviticus	25	10	You will make the fiftieth year holy , proclaiming freedom throughout the land to all its inhabitants . It will be a Jubilee year [ c ] for you : each of you must return to your family property and to your extended family .
CEB	Leviticus	25	11	The fiftieth year will be a Jubilee year for you . Do not plant , do not harvest the secondary growth , and do not gather from the freely growing vines
CEB	Leviticus	25	12	because it is a Jubilee : it will be holy to you . You can eat only the produce directly out of the field .
CEB	Leviticus	25	13	Each of you must return to your family property in this year of Jubilee .
CEB	Leviticus	25	14	When you sell something to or buy something from your fellow citizen , you must not cheat each other .
CEB	Leviticus	25	15	You will buy from your fellow citizen according to the number of years since the Jubilee ; he will sell to you according to the number of years left for harvests .
CEB	Leviticus	25	16	You will raise the price if there are more years , or lower the price if there are less years because it is the number of harvests that are being sold to you .
CEB	Leviticus	25	17	You must not cheat each other but fear your God because I am the Lord your God .
CEB	Leviticus	25	18	You will observe my rules , and you will keep my regulations and do them so that you can live securely on the land . Food during fallow years
CEB	Leviticus	25	19	The land will give its fruit so that you can eat your fill and live securely on it .
CEB	Leviticus	25	20	Suppose you ask , “ What will we eat in the seventh year if we don ’ t plant or gather our crops then ? ”
CEB	Leviticus	25	21	I will send my blessing on you in the sixth year so that it will make enough produce for three years .
CEB	Leviticus	25	22	You can plant again in the eighth year and eat food from the previous year ’ s produce until the ninth year . Until its produce comes , you will eat the food from the previous year . Buying back family property
CEB	Leviticus	25	23	The land must not be permanently sold because the land is mine . You are just immigrants and foreign guests of mine .
CEB	Leviticus	25	24	Throughout the whole land that you possess , you must allow for the land to be bought back .
CEB	Leviticus	25	26	If the person doesn ’ t have someone to buy it back , but then manages to afford buying it back ,
CEB	Leviticus	25	27	they must calculate the years since its sale and refund the balance to the person to whom they sold it . Then it will go back to the family property . [ e ]
CEB	Leviticus	25	28	If they can not afford to make a refund to the buyer , whatever was sold will remain in the possession of the buyer until the Jubilee year . It will be released in the Jubilee year , at which point it will return to the family property .
CEB	Leviticus	25	29	When a person sells a home in a walled city , it may be bought back until a year after its sale . The period for buying it back will be one year .
CEB	Leviticus	25	30	If it is not bought back before a full year has passed , the house in the walled city will belong to the buyer permanently and their descendants forever . It will not be released at the Jubilee .
CEB	Leviticus	25	31	But houses in settlements that are unwalled will be considered as if they were country fields . They can be bought back , and they must be released at the Jubilee .
CEB	Leviticus	25	32	Levites will always have the right to buy back homes in the levitical cities that are part of their family property .
CEB	Leviticus	25	33	Levite property that can be bought back—houses sold in a city that is their family property—must be released at the Jubilee , because homes in levitical cities are the Levites ’ family property among the Israelites .
CEB	Leviticus	25	34	But the pastureland around their cities can not be sold , because that is their permanent family property . Poor Israelites and slavery
CEB	Leviticus	25	35	If one of your fellow Israelites faces financial difficulty and is in a shaky situation with you , [ f ] you must assist them as you would an immigrant or foreign guest so that they can survive among you .
CEB	Leviticus	25	36	Do not take interest from them , or any kind of profit from interest , but fear your God so that your fellow Israelite can survive among you .
CEB	Leviticus	25	37	Do not lend a poor Israelite money with interest or lend food at a profit .
CEB	Leviticus	25	38	I am the Lord your God , who brought you out from the land of Egypt to give you Canaan ’ s land and to be your God .
CEB	Leviticus	25	39	If one of your fellow Israelites faces financial difficulty with you and sells themselves to you , you must not make him work as a slave .
CEB	Leviticus	25	40	Instead , they will be like a hired laborer or foreign guest to you . They will work for you until the Jubilee year ,
CEB	Leviticus	25	41	at which point the poor Israelite along with their children will be released from you . They can return to their extended family and to their family property .
CEB	Leviticus	25	42	You must do this because these people are my servants—I brought them out of Egypt ’ s land . They must not be sold as slaves .
CEB	Leviticus	25	43	You will not harshly rule over them but must fear your God .
CEB	Leviticus	25	44	Regarding male or female slaves that you are allowed to have : You can buy a male or a female slave from the nations that are around you .
CEB	Leviticus	25	45	You can also buy them from the foreign guests who live with you and from their extended families that are with you , who were born in your land . These can belong to you as property .
CEB	Leviticus	25	46	You can pass them on to your children as inheritance that they can own as permanent property . You can make these people work as slaves , but you must not rule harshly over your own people , the Israelites .
CEB	Leviticus	25	47	If an immigrant or foreign guest prospers financially among you , but your fellow Israelite faces financial difficulty and so sells themselves to the immigrant or foreign guest , or to a descendant of a foreigner ,
CEB	Leviticus	25	48	the Israelite will have the right to be bought back after they sold themselves . One of their relatives can buy them back :
CEB	Leviticus	25	49	their uncle or cousin can buy them back ; one of their blood relatives from their family can buy them back ; or they may be able to afford their own purchase .
CEB	Leviticus	25	50	The Israelite will calculate with their owner the time from the year they were sold until the Jubilee year . The price of their release will be based on the number of years they were with the owner , as in the case of a hired laborer .
CEB	Leviticus	25	51	If there are many years left before the Jubilee , the Israelite will pay for their purchase in proportion to their purchase price .
CEB	Leviticus	25	52	If only a few years are left , they will calculate that and pay for their purchase according to the years of service .
CEB	Leviticus	25	53	Regardless , the Israelite will be to the buyer like a yearly laborer ; the buyer must not harshly rule over them in your sight .
CEB	Leviticus	25	54	If the Israelite is not bought back in one of these ways , they and their children must be released in the Jubilee year
CEB	Leviticus	25	55	because the Israelites belong to me as servants . They are my servants—I brought them out of Egypt ’ s land ; I am the Lord your God .

CEB	Leviticus	26	26	When I destroy your food supply , ten women will bake bread in a single oven , and they will ration out bread by weight . You will eat but will never get full .
CEB	Leviticus	26	2	You must keep my sabbaths and respect my sanctuary ; I am the Lord .
CEB	Leviticus	26	3	If you live according to my rules , keep my commands , and do them ,
CEB	Leviticus	26	4	I will give you rain at the proper time , the land will produce its yield , and the trees of the field will produce their fruit .
CEB	Leviticus	26	5	Your threshing season will last until the grape harvest , and the grape harvest will last until planting time . You will eat your fill of food and live securely in your land .
CEB	Leviticus	26	6	I will grant peace in the land so that you can lie down without anyone frightening you . I will remove dangerous animals from the land , and no sword will pass through it .
CEB	Leviticus	26	7	You will chase your enemies , and they will fall before you in battle .
CEB	Leviticus	26	8	Five of you will chase away a hundred , and a hundred of you will chase away ten thousand , and your enemies will fall before you in battle .
CEB	Leviticus	26	9	I will turn my face to you , will make you fruitful and numerous , and will keep my covenant with you .
CEB	Leviticus	26	10	You will still be eating the previous year ’ s harvest when the time will come to clear it out to make room for the new !
CEB	Leviticus	26	11	I will place my dwelling [ b ] among you , and I will not despise you .
CEB	Leviticus	26	12	I will walk around among you ; I will be your God , and you will be my people .
CEB	Leviticus	26	13	I am the Lord your God , who brought you out of Egypt ’ s land—who brought you out from being Egypt ’ s slaves . I broke your bonds and made you stand up straight . Covenant curses
CEB	Leviticus	26	14	But if you do not obey me and do not carry out all these commands—
CEB	Leviticus	26	15	if you reject my rules and despise my regulations , not doing all my commands and breaking my covenant—
CEB	Leviticus	26	16	then I will do the following to you : I will bring horrific things : [ c ] wasting diseases and fevers that make the eyes fail and drain life away . You will plant seed for no reason because your enemies will eat the food .
CEB	Leviticus	26	17	I will turn my face against you : you will be defeated by your enemies ; those who hate you will rule over you ; and you will run away even when no one is chasing you .
CEB	Leviticus	26	18	If , despite all that , you still do not obey me , I will punish you for your sins seven more times :
CEB	Leviticus	26	19	I will destroy your prideful power . I will turn your sky to iron and your land to bronze
CEB	Leviticus	26	20	so that your strength will be spent for no reason : your land will not produce its yield , and the trees of the land won ’ t produce their fruit .
CEB	Leviticus	26	21	If you continue to oppose me and are unwilling to obey me , I will strike you for your sins seven more times :
CEB	Leviticus	26	22	I will send wild animals against you , and they will kill your children and destroy your livestock . They will make you so few in number that your roads will seem deserted .
CEB	Leviticus	26	23	If , despite these things , you still do not accept my discipline and continue to oppose me ,
CEB	Leviticus	26	24	then I will continue to oppose you . I will strike you for your sins seven more times :
CEB	Leviticus	26	25	I will bring the sword against you , avenging the breaking of the covenant . [ d ] If you retreat into your cities , I will send a plague on you , and you will be handed over to the enemy .
CEB	Leviticus	26	27	If , despite all this , you still do not obey me and continue to oppose me ,
CEB	Leviticus	26	28	then I will continue to oppose you—with anger ! I will punish you for your sins seven more times :
CEB	Leviticus	26	29	You will eat the flesh of your own sons and daughters .
CEB	Leviticus	26	30	I will eliminate your shrines , chop down your incense altars , and pile your dead bodies on the dead bodies of your idols . I will despise you .
CEB	Leviticus	26	31	I will turn your cities into ruins , I will devastate your sanctuaries , and I will not smell the soothing smells of your offerings .
CEB	Leviticus	26	32	I will personally devastate the land so much that your enemies who resettle it will be astonished by it .
CEB	Leviticus	26	33	I will scatter you among the nations . I will unsheathe my sword against you . Your land will be devastated and your cities will be ruins .
CEB	Leviticus	26	34	At that time , while it is devastated and you are in enemy territory , the land will enjoy its sabbaths . At that time , the land will rest and enjoy its sabbaths .
CEB	Leviticus	26	35	During the whole time it is devastated , it will have the rest it didn ’ t have during the sabbaths you lived in it .
CEB	Leviticus	26	36	I will bring despair into the hearts of those of you who survive in enemy territory . Just the sound of a windblown leaf will put them to running , and they will run scared as if running from a sword ! They will fall even when no one is chasing them !
CEB	Leviticus	26	37	They will stumble over each other as they would before a sword , even though no one is chasing them ! You will have no power to stand before your enemies .
CEB	Leviticus	26	38	You will disappear among the nations—the land of your enemies will devour you .
CEB	Leviticus	26	39	Any of you who do survive will rot in enemy territory on account of their guilty deeds . And they will rot too on account of their ancestors ’ guilty deeds . Covenant and restoration
CEB	Leviticus	26	40	But if they confess their and their ancestors ’ guilt for the wrongdoing they did to me , and for their continued opposition to me—
CEB	Leviticus	26	41	which made me oppose them , so I took them into enemy territory—or if their uncircumcised hearts are humbled and they make up for their guilt ,
CEB	Leviticus	26	42	then I will remember my covenant with Jacob . I will also remember my covenant with Isaac . And my covenant with Abraham . And I will remember the land .
CEB	Leviticus	26	43	The land will be absent of them and will be enjoying its sabbaths while it lies devastated , free of them . They will be making up for their guilty deeds for no other reason than the fact that they rejected my regulations and despised my rules .
CEB	Leviticus	26	44	But despite all that , when they are in enemy territory , I will not reject them or despise them to the point of totally destroying them , breaking my covenant with them by doing so , because I am the Lord their God .
CEB	Leviticus	26	45	But for their sake I will remember the covenant with the first generation , the ones I brought out of Egypt ’ s land in the sight of all the nations , in order to be their God ; I am the Lord .
CEB	Leviticus	26	46	These are the rules , regulations , and instructions between the Lord and the Israelites that he gave through Moses on Mount Sinai .

CEB	Numbers	10	28	This was the order of departure of the Israelites with their military units when they set out . The chest leads
CEB	Numbers	10	29	Moses said to Hobab the Midianite , Reuel ’ s son and Moses ’ father-in-law , “ We ’ re marching to the place about which the Lord has said , ‘ I ’ ll give it to you. ’ Come with us and we ’ ll treat you well , for the Lord has promised to treat Israel well. ”
CEB	Numbers	10	30	Hobab said to him , “ I won ’ t go ; I ’ d rather go to my land and to my folk. ”
CEB	Numbers	10	31	Moses said , “ Please don ’ t abandon us , for you know where we can camp in the desert , and you can be our eyes .
CEB	Numbers	10	32	If you go with us , whatever good the Lord does for us , we ’ ll do for you. ”
CEB	Numbers	10	33	They marched from the Lord ’ s mountain for three days . The Lord ’ s chest containing the covenant marched ahead of them for three days to look for a resting place for them .
CEB	Numbers	10	34	Now the Lord ’ s cloud was over them by day when they marched from the camp .
CEB	Numbers	10	35	When the chest set out , Moses would say , “ Arise , Lord , let your enemies scatter , and those who hate you flee. ”
CEB	Numbers	10	36	When it rested , he would say , “ Return , Lord of the ten thousand thousands of Israel . ”
CEB	Numbers	11	11	Moses said to the Lord , “ Why have you treated your servant so badly ? And why haven ’ t I found favor in your eyes , for you have placed the burden of all these people on me ?
CEB	Numbers	11	2	When the people cried out to Moses , Moses prayed to the Lord , and the fire subsided .
CEB	Numbers	11	3	The name of that place was called Taberah , [ a ] because the Lord ’ s fire burned against them . Complaint over the lack of meat
CEB	Numbers	11	4	The riffraff among them had a strong craving . Even the Israelites cried again and said , “ Who will give us meat to eat ?
CEB	Numbers	11	5	We remember the fish we ate in Egypt for free , the cucumbers , the melons , the leeks , the onions , and the garlic .
CEB	Numbers	11	6	Now our lives are wasting away . There is nothing but manna in front of us. ”
CEB	Numbers	11	7	The manna was like coriander seed and its color was like resin .
CEB	Numbers	11	8	The people would roam around and collect it and grind it with millstones or pound it in a mortar . Then they would boil it in pots and make it into cakes . It tasted like cakes baked in olive oil .
CEB	Numbers	11	9	When the dew fell on the camp during the night , the manna would fall with it . Moses ’ complaint about leadership
CEB	Numbers	11	10	Moses heard the people crying throughout their clans , each at his tent ’ s entrance . The Lord was outraged , and Moses was upset .
CEB	Numbers	11	12	Did I conceive all these people ? Did I give birth to them , that you would say to me , ‘ Carry them at the breast , as a nurse carries an unweaned child , ’ to the fertile land that you promised their ancestors ?
CEB	Numbers	11	13	Where am I to get meat for all these people ? They are crying before me and saying , ‘ Give us meat , so we can eat. ’
CEB	Numbers	11	14	I can ’ t bear this people on my own . They ’ re too heavy for me .
CEB	Numbers	11	15	If you ’ re going to treat me like this , please kill me . If I ’ ve found favor in your eyes , then don ’ t let me endure this wretched situation. ”
CEB	Numbers	11	16	The Lord said to Moses , “ Gather before me seventy men from Israel ’ s elders , whom you know as elders and officers of the people . Take them to the meeting tent , and let them stand there with you .
CEB	Numbers	11	17	Then I ’ ll descend and speak with you there . I ’ ll take some of the spirit that is on you and place it on them . Then they will carry the burden of the people with you so that you won ’ t bear it alone .
CEB	Numbers	11	18	To the people you will say , ‘ Make yourselves holy for tomorrow ; then you will eat meat , for you ’ ve cried in the Lord ’ s hearing , “ Who will give us meat to eat ? It was better for us in Egypt. ” The Lord will give you meat , and you will eat .
CEB	Numbers	11	19	You won ’ t eat for just one day , or two days , or five days , or ten days , or twenty days ,
CEB	Numbers	11	20	but for a whole month until it comes out of your nostrils and nauseates you . You ’ ve rejected the Lord who ’ s been with you and you have cried before him , saying , “ Why did we leave Egypt ? ” ’ ”
CEB	Numbers	11	21	Moses said , “ The people I ’ m with are six hundred thousand on foot and you ’ re saying , ‘ I will give them meat , and they will eat for a month. ’
CEB	Numbers	11	22	Can flocks and herds be found and slaughtered for them ? Or can all the fish in the sea be found and caught for them ? ”
CEB	Numbers	11	23	The Lord said to Moses , “ Is the Lord ’ s power too weak ? Now you will see whether my word will come true for you or not. ”
CEB	Numbers	11	24	So Moses went out and told the people the Lord ’ s words . He assembled seventy men from the people ’ s elders and placed them around the tent .
CEB	Numbers	11	25	The Lord descended in a cloud , spoke to him , and took some of the spirit that was on him and placed it on the seventy elders . When the spirit rested on them , they prophesied , but only this once .
CEB	Numbers	11	26	Two men had remained in the camp , one named Eldad and the second named Medad , and the spirit rested on them . They were among those registered , but they hadn ’ t gone out to the tent , so they prophesied in the camp .
CEB	Numbers	11	27	A young man ran and told Moses , “ Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp. ”
CEB	Numbers	11	28	Joshua , Nun ’ s son and Moses ’ assistant since his youth , responded , “ My master Moses , stop them ! ”
CEB	Numbers	11	29	Moses said to him , “ Are you jealous for my sake ? If only all the Lord ’ s people were prophets with the Lord placing his spirit on them ! ” Quail from the sea
CEB	Numbers	11	30	Moses and Israel ’ s elders were assembled in the camp .
CEB	Numbers	11	31	A wind from the Lord blew up and brought quails from the sea . It let them fall by the camp , about a day ’ s journey all around the camp and about three feet deep on the ground .
CEB	Numbers	11	32	Then the people arose and gathered the quail all that day , all night , and all the next day . The least collected was ten homers , [ b ] and they laid them out around the camp .
CEB	Numbers	11	33	While the meat was still between their teeth and not yet consumed , the Lord ’ s anger blazed against the people . The Lord struck the people with a very great punishment .
CEB	Numbers	11	34	The name of that place was called Kibroth-hattaavah , [ c ] because there they buried the people who had the craving . Miriam and Aaron challenge Moses
CEB	Numbers	11	35	From Kibroth-hattaavah the people marched to Hazeroth . Footnotes - Numbers 11:3 Or the place of burning - Numbers 11:32 Five hundred gallons ; one homer is two hundred quarts . - Numbers 11:34 Or graves of craving
CEB	Numbers	12	12	Please don ’ t let her be like the stillborn , whose flesh is half eaten as it comes out of the mother ’ s womb. ”
CEB	Numbers	12	2	They said , “ Has the Lord spoken only through Moses ? Hasn ’ t he also spoken through us ? ” The Lord heard it .
CEB	Numbers	12	3	Now the man Moses was humble , more so than anyone on earth . The Lord defends Moses
CEB	Numbers	12	4	Immediately , the Lord said to Moses , Aaron , and Miriam , “ You three go out to the meeting tent. ” So the three of them went out .
CEB	Numbers	12	5	Then the Lord descended in a column of cloud , stood at the entrance of the tent , and called to Aaron and Miriam . The two of them came forward .
CEB	Numbers	12	6	He said , “ Listen to my words : If there is a prophet of the Lord among you , [ a ] I make myself known to him in visions . I speak to him in dreams .
CEB	Numbers	12	7	But not with my servant Moses . He has proved to be reliable with all my household .
CEB	Numbers	12	8	I speak with him face-to-face , visibly , not in riddles . He sees the Lord ’ s form . So why aren ’ t you afraid to criticize my servant Moses ? ”
CEB	Numbers	12	9	The Lord ’ s anger blazed against them , and they went back . The Lord punishes Miriam
CEB	Numbers	12	10	When the cloud went away from over the tent , Miriam suddenly developed a skin disease flaky like snow . Aaron turned toward Miriam and saw her skin disease .
CEB	Numbers	12	11	Then Aaron said to Moses , “ Oh , my master , please don ’ t punish us for the sin that we foolishly committed .
CEB	Numbers	12	13	So Moses cried to the Lord , “ God , please heal her ! ”
CEB	Numbers	12	14	The Lord said to Moses , “ If her father had spit in her face , would she not be shamed for seven days ? Let her be shut out of the camp for seven days , and afterward she will be brought back. ”
CEB	Numbers	12	15	So they shut Miriam out of the camp seven days . And the people didn ’ t march until Miriam was brought back .
CEB	Numbers	12	16	Afterward the people marched from Hazeroth , and they camped in the Paran desert . Footnotes - Numbers 12:6 Heb uncertain ; LXX If there is a prophet of you for the Lord

CEB	Numbers	13	2	Send out men to explore the land of Canaan , which I ’ m giving to the Israelites . Send one man from each ancestral tribe , each a chief among them .
CEB	Numbers	13	3	So Moses sent them out from the Paran desert according to the Lord ’ s command . All the men were leaders among the Israelites .
CEB	Numbers	13	4	These are their names : from the tribe of Reuben , Shammua , Zaccur ’ s son ;
CEB	Numbers	13	5	from the tribe of Simeon , Shaphat , Hori ’ s son ;

CEB	Numbers	13	15	from the tribe of Gad , Geuel , Machi ’ s son .
CEB	Numbers	13	16	These are the names of the men whom Moses sent out to explore the land . Moses changed the name of Hoshea , Nun ’ s son , to Joshua .
CEB	Numbers	13	17	When Moses sent them out to explore the land of Canaan , he said to them , “ Go up there into the arid southern plain and into the mountains .
CEB	Numbers	13	18	You must inspect the land . What is it like ? Are the people who live in it strong or weak , few or many ?
CEB	Numbers	13	19	Is the land in which they live good or bad ? Are the towns in which they live camps or fortresses ?
CEB	Numbers	13	20	Is the land rich or poor ? Are there trees in it or not ? Be courageous and bring back the land ’ s fruit. ” It was the season of the first ripe grapes .
CEB	Numbers	13	21	They went up and explored the land from the Zin desert to Rehob , near Lebo-hamath .
CEB	Numbers	13	22	They went up into the arid southern plain and entered Hebron , where Ahiman , Sheshai , and Talmai , the descendants of the Anakites , lived . ( Hebron was built seven years before Tanis [ a ] in Egypt . )
CEB	Numbers	13	23	Then they entered the Cluster [ b ] ravine , cut down from there a branch with one cluster of grapes , and carried it on a pole between them . They also took pomegranates and figs .
CEB	Numbers	13	24	That place was called the Cluster ravine because of the cluster of grapes that the Israelites cut down from there . Report about the land of Canaan
CEB	Numbers	13	25	They returned from exploring the land after forty days .
CEB	Numbers	13	26	They went directly to Moses , Aaron , and the entire Israelite community in the Paran desert at Kadesh . They brought back a report to them and to the entire community and showed them the land ’ s fruit .
CEB	Numbers	13	27	Then they gave their report : “ We entered the land to which you sent us . It ’ s actually full of milk and honey , and this is its fruit .
CEB	Numbers	13	28	There are , however , powerful people who live in the land . The cities have huge fortifications . And we even saw the descendants of the Anakites there .
CEB	Numbers	13	29	The Amalekites live in the land of the arid southern plain ; the Hittites , Jebusites , and Amorites live in the mountains ; and the Canaanites live by the sea and along the Jordan. ”
CEB	Numbers	13	30	Now Caleb calmed the people before Moses and said , “ We must go up and take possession of it , because we are more than able to do it. ”
CEB	Numbers	13	31	But the men who went up with him said , “ We can ’ t go up against the people because they are stronger than we. ”
CEB	Numbers	13	32	They started a rumor about the land that they had explored , telling the Israelites , “ The land that we crossed over to explore is a land that devours its residents . All the people we saw in it are huge men .
CEB	Numbers	13	33	We saw there the Nephilim ( the descendants of Anak come from the Nephilim ) . We saw ourselves as grasshoppers , and that ’ s how we appeared to them. ” Footnotes - Numbers 13:22 Heb Zoan - Numbers 13:23 Or cluster of grapes
CEB	Numbers	14	14	They ’ ll tell the inhabitants of this land . They ’ ve heard that you , Lord , are with this people . You , Lord , appear to them face-to-face . Your cloud stands over them . You go before them in a column of cloud by day and in a column of lightning by night .
CEB	Numbers	14	2	All the Israelites criticized Moses and Aaron . The entire community said to them , “ If only we had died in the land of Egypt or if only we had died in this desert !
CEB	Numbers	14	3	Why is the Lord bringing us to this land to fall by the sword ? Our wives and our children will be taken by force . Wouldn ’ t it be better for us to return to Egypt ? ”
CEB	Numbers	14	4	So they said to each other , “ Let ’ s pick a leader and let ’ s go back to Egypt. ”
CEB	Numbers	14	5	Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before the assembled Israelite community .
CEB	Numbers	14	6	But Joshua , Nun ’ s son , and Caleb , Jephunneh ’ s son , from those who had explored the land , tore their clothes
CEB	Numbers	14	7	and said to the entire Israelite community , “ The land we crossed through to explore is an exceptionally good land .
CEB	Numbers	14	8	If the Lord is pleased with us , he ’ ll bring us into this land and give it to us . It ’ s a land that ’ s full of milk and honey .
CEB	Numbers	14	9	Only don ’ t rebel against the Lord and don ’ t be afraid of the people of the land . They are our prey . [ a ] Their defense has deserted them , but the Lord is with us . So don ’ t be afraid of them. ”
CEB	Numbers	14	10	But the entire community intended to stone them . The Lord ’ s anger and Moses ’ intercession Then the Lord ’ s glory appeared in the meeting tent to all the Israelites .
CEB	Numbers	14	11	The Lord said to Moses , “ How long will these people disrespect me ? And how long will they doubt me after all the signs that I performed among them ?
CEB	Numbers	14	12	I ’ ll strike them down with a plague and disown them . Then I ’ ll make you into a great nation , stronger than they. ”
CEB	Numbers	14	13	Moses said to the Lord , “ The Egyptians will hear , for with your power you brought these people up from among them .
CEB	Numbers	14	15	If you kill these people , every last one of them , the nations who heard about you will say ,
CEB	Numbers	14	16	‘ The Lord wasn ’ t able to bring these people to the land that he solemnly promised to give them . So he slaughtered them in the desert. ’
CEB	Numbers	14	17	Now let my master ’ s power be as great as you declared when you said ,
CEB	Numbers	14	18	‘ The Lord is very patient and absolutely loyal , forgiving wrongs and disloyalty . Yet he doesn ’ t forgo all punishment , disciplining the grandchildren and great-grandchildren for their ancestors ’ wrongs. ’
CEB	Numbers	14	19	Please forgive the wrongs of these people because of your absolute loyalty , just as you ’ ve forgiven these people from their time in Egypt until now. ”
CEB	Numbers	14	20	years old and above , who complained against me ,
CEB	Numbers	14	21	But as I live and as the Lord ’ s glory fills the entire earth ,
CEB	Numbers	14	22	none of the men who saw my glory and the signs I did in Egypt and in the desert , but tested me these ten times and haven ’ t listened to my voice ,
CEB	Numbers	14	23	will see the land I promised to their ancestors . All who disrespected me won ’ t see it .
CEB	Numbers	14	24	But I ’ ll bring my servant Caleb into the land that he explored , and his descendants will possess it because he has a different spirit , and he has remained true to me .
CEB	Numbers	14	25	Since the Amalekites and the Canaanites live in the valley , tomorrow turn and march into the desert by the route of the Reed Sea. ” [ b ] The Israelites ’ punishment
CEB	Numbers	14	26	The Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron :
CEB	Numbers	14	27	How long will this wicked community complain against me ? I ’ ve heard the Israelites ’ dissent as they continue to complain against me .
CEB	Numbers	14	28	Say to them , “ As I live , ” says the Lord , “ just as I ’ ve heard you say , so I ’ ll do to you .
CEB	Numbers	14	29	Your dead bodies will fall in this desert . None of you who were enlisted and were registered from
CEB	Numbers	14	30	will enter the land in which I promised [ c ] to settle you , with the exception of Caleb , Jephunneh ’ s son , and Joshua , Nun ’ s son .
CEB	Numbers	14	31	But your children , whom you said would be taken by force , I ’ ll bring them in and they will know the land that you rejected .
CEB	Numbers	14	32	Your bodies , however , will fall in this desert ,
CEB	Numbers	14	33	and your children will be shepherds in the desert for forty years . They will suffer for your unfaithfulness , until the last of your bodies fall in the desert .
CEB	Numbers	14	34	For as many days as you explored the land , that is , forty days , just as many years you ’ ll bear your guilt , that is , forty years . This is how you will understand my frustration. ”
CEB	Numbers	14	35	I the Lord have spoken . I will do this to the entire wicked community who gathered against me . They will die in this desert . There they ’ ll meet their end .
CEB	Numbers	14	36	The men whom Moses sent out to explore the land had returned and caused the entire community to complain against him by starting a rumor about the land .
CEB	Numbers	14	37	These men died by a plague in the Lord ’ s presence on account of their false rumor .
CEB	Numbers	14	38	But Joshua , Nun ’ s son , and Caleb , Jephunneh ’ s son , survived from those men who went to explore the land .
CEB	Numbers	14	39	Moses spoke these words to all the Israelites , and the people mourned bitterly .
CEB	Numbers	14	40	They rose early in the morning and went up to the top of the mountain range , saying , “ Let ’ s go up to the place the Lord told us to , for we have sinned. ”
CEB	Numbers	14	41	But Moses said , “ Why do you disobey the Lord ’ s command ? It won ’ t succeed .
CEB	Numbers	14	42	Don ’ t go up , for the Lord isn ’ t with you . Don ’ t be struck down before your enemies .
CEB	Numbers	14	43	The Amalekites and the Canaanites will be there in front of you and you will fall by the sword because you turned away from the Lord , and the Lord is no longer with you. ”
CEB	Numbers	14	44	Yet they recklessly [ d ] ascended toward the top of the mountains , even though Moses and the Lord ’ s chest containing the covenant didn ’ t depart from the camp .
CEB	Numbers	14	45	Then the Amalekites and the Canaanites , who lived in those mountains , descended , struck them down , and beat them all the way to Hormah . Footnotes - Numbers 14:9 Or our bread - Numbers 14:25 Or Red Sea - Numbers 14:30 Or raised my hand - Numbers 14:44 Heb uncertain

CEB	Numbers	15	3	and you make a food gift [ a ] to the Lord as a soothing smell for the Lord from the herd or the flock—whether an entirely burned offering , or a sacrifice to fulfill a solemn promise , or a spontaneous gift , or at your sacred seasons—

CEB	Numbers	15	7	You will also present one-third of a hin of wine for a drink offering as a soothing smell for the Lord .
CEB	Numbers	15	8	When you offer a bull for an entirely burned offering , or a sacrifice to fulfill a solemn promise , or a well-being sacrifice to the Lord ,

CEB	Numbers	15	12	However many you offer , you will do the same for each one .
CEB	Numbers	15	13	Every citizen will perform these rituals in bringing a food gift that is a soothing smell to the Lord .

CEB	Numbers	15	26	The entire Israelite community and the immigrant residing among them will be forgiven , because all the people acted unintentionally .
CEB	Numbers	15	27	If an individual sins unintentionally , that person must present a one-year-old female goat for a purification offering .
CEB	Numbers	15	28	The priest will seek reconciliation in the Lord ’ s presence for the person who sinned unintentionally , when the sin is an accident , seeking reconciliation so that person will be forgiven .

CEB	Numbers	16	3	They assembled against Moses and Aaron and said to them , “ You ’ ve gone too far , because the entire community is holy , every last one of them , and the Lord is with them . Why then do you exalt yourselves above the Lord ’ s assembly ? ”
CEB	Numbers	16	4	When Moses heard this , he fell on his face .
CEB	Numbers	16	5	He spoke to Korah and all his community , “ In the morning the Lord will make known who is his , who is holy , and who is able to approach him . The one he chooses for himself is the one who will be able to approach him .

CEB	Numbers	16	12	Moses sent for Dathan and Abiram , Eliab ’ s sons . But they said , “ We won ’ t come up !
CEB	Numbers	16	13	Isn ’ t it enough that you ’ ve brought us up from a land full of milk and honey to kill us in the desert so that you ’ d also dominate us ?
CEB	Numbers	16	14	Moreover , you haven ’ t brought us to a land full of milk and honey , nor given us the inheritance of field and vineyard . Would you also gouge out the eyes of these men ? We won ’ t come up ! ”
CEB	Numbers	16	15	Moses became very angry and he said to the Lord , “ Pay no attention to their offering . I haven ’ t taken a single donkey from them , nor have I wronged any one of them. ”
CEB	Numbers	16	17	Every person should take his censer , place incense on it , and present it before the Lord . Each person will carry his censer , two hundred fifty censers in all , including you and Aaron. ”
CEB	Numbers	16	18	Then every person took his censer , placed fire on it , put incense on it , and stood at the entrance of the meeting tent with Moses and Aaron .
CEB	Numbers	16	19	Korah gathered the entire community with them to the entrance of the meeting tent . Then the Lord ’ s glory appeared to the entire community .
CEB	Numbers	16	20	The Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron ,
CEB	Numbers	16	21	“ Separate yourselves from this community so that I may consume them in a moment. ”
CEB	Numbers	16	22	They fell on their faces and said , “ God , the God of all living things . If one person sins , should you become angry with the entire community ? ”
CEB	Numbers	16	23	The Lord said to Moses ,
CEB	Numbers	16	24	“ Speak to the community and say , ‘ Withdraw from around the dwellings of Korah , Dathan , and Abiram. ’ ”
CEB	Numbers	16	25	Moses rose and went to Dathan and Abiram . Israel ’ s elders followed him .
CEB	Numbers	16	26	He spoke to the community : “ Move away from the tents of these wicked men and don ’ t touch anything of theirs , lest you too be wiped out for all their sins. ”
CEB	Numbers	16	27	They withdrew from around the dwellings of Korah , Dathan , and Abiram . Then Dathan and Abiram came out and stood at the entrance of their tents with their wives , children , and little ones .
CEB	Numbers	16	28	Moses said , “ By this you will know that the Lord sent me to do these deeds and that it wasn ’ t my own desire .
CEB	Numbers	16	29	If all these people die a natural death , or if their fate be that of all humans , then the Lord hasn ’ t sent me .
CEB	Numbers	16	30	But if the Lord performs an act of creation , and the ground opens its mouth and swallows them and everything that belongs to them , so that they descend alive to their graves , then you ’ ll know that these men disrespected the Lord. ” The rebels ’ punishment

CEB	Numbers	16	34	All the Israelites who were around them fled at their cry , for they said , “ The earth may swallow us. ”
CEB	Numbers	16	35	Then fire went out from the Lord and consumed the two hundred fifty men offering incense . The reminder of the censers
CEB	Numbers	16	36	[ a ] The Lord spoke to Moses :
CEB	Numbers	16	37	Tell Eleazar , Aaron the priest ’ s son , to raise the censers from the fire and scatter the ashes about , because they are holy .
CEB	Numbers	16	38	Hammer the censers of those who sinned and lost their lives into thin plates for the altar . Since they presented them in the Lord ’ s presence , they had become holy . They will be a sign for the Israelites .
CEB	Numbers	16	39	Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers presented by those who had been consumed by fire and hammered them into a covering for the altar ,
CEB	Numbers	16	40	just as the Lord instructed him through Moses . This was a reminder for the Israelites that no outsider who isn ’ t one of Aaron ’ s descendants should approach to burn incense in the Lord ’ s presence , so as not to be like Korah and his community .
CEB	Numbers	16	41	On the next day the entire Israelite community complained to Moses and Aaron , “ You killed the Lord ’ s people. ”
CEB	Numbers	16	42	When the community assembled against Moses and Aaron , they turned toward the meeting tent . At that moment the cloud covered it , and the Lord ’ s glory appeared .
CEB	Numbers	16	43	Moses and Aaron came to the front of the meeting tent ,
CEB	Numbers	16	44	and the Lord spoke to Moses :
CEB	Numbers	16	45	Get away from this community , so that I may consume them in an instant . They fell on their faces ,
CEB	Numbers	16	46	and Moses said to Aaron , “ Take the censer , put fire from the altar on it , place incense on it , go quickly to the community , and seek reconciliation for them . Indeed , the Lord ’ s anger has gone out . The plague has begun. ”
CEB	Numbers	16	47	Aaron took it as Moses said and ran into the middle of the assembly , for the plague had already begun among the people . He burned incense and sought reconciliation for the people .
CEB	Numbers	16	48	He stood between the dead and the living , and the plague stopped .
CEB	Numbers	16	49	Those who died from the plague were fourteen thousand seven hundred , in addition to those who died because of Korah .
CEB	Numbers	16	50	Aaron returned to Moses at the entrance of the meeting tent once the plague stopped . Footnotes - Numbers 16:36 17:1 in Heb

CEB	Numbers	17	5	The staff of the person I choose will sprout . Then I will rid myself of the Israelites ’ complaints that they make against you .

CEB	Numbers	17	9	Moses brought out all the staffs from the Lord ’ s presence to the Israelites . They saw what happened , and each person took back his staff .
CEB	Numbers	17	10	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Return Aaron ’ s staff in front of the chest containing the covenant to serve as a sign to the rebels so that their complaints against me end and they don ’ t die. ”
CEB	Numbers	17	11	Moses did exactly as the Lord commanded him .
CEB	Numbers	17	12	The Israelites said to Moses , “ We are perishing . We are being destroyed . All of us are being destroyed .
CEB	Numbers	17	13	Anyone who approaches the Lord ’ s dwelling will die . Are we doomed to perish ? ” Footnotes - Numbers 17:1 17:16 in Heb

CEB	Numbers	18	7	You and your sons must perform the duties of your priesthood for all the matters of the altar and the area behind the curtain . I give you your priestly service as a gift . But an outsider who approaches will die . The priests ’ compensation

CEB	Numbers	18	24	because I ’ ve given the Israelites ’ one-tenth portion , which they have raised to the Lord as a gift offering , as an inheritance to the Levites . Therefore , I ’ ve said to them , “ They won ’ t inherit land among the Israelites. ”
CEB	Numbers	18	25	The Lord spoke to Moses :
CEB	Numbers	18	26	Speak to the Levites and say to them : When you receive from the Israelites the one-tenth portion that I have given you from them as your inheritance , you also must present a gift offering to the Lord from it , a tenth from the one-tenth portion .
CEB	Numbers	18	27	It will be considered your gift offering , like the grain of the threshing floor and what fills the winepress .
CEB	Numbers	18	28	In this way you will also present a gift offering to the Lord from all the one-tenth portions that you take from the Israelites . You will provide from it a gift offering to the Lord for Aaron the priest .
CEB	Numbers	18	29	You will present each gift offering to the Lord from all your gifts , from its best portions and its holiest parts .

CEB	Numbers	18	31	You and your household may eat it anywhere , because it is payment for your service in the meeting tent .
CEB	Numbers	18	32	You will not bear guilt after you have presented the best portion . But you must not make the sacred gifts of the Israelites impure , on penalty of death .

CEB	Numbers	20	2	Now there was no water for the community , and they assembled against Moses and Aaron .
CEB	Numbers	20	3	Then the people confronted Moses and said to him , “ If only we too had died when our brothers perished in the Lord ’ s presence !
CEB	Numbers	20	4	Why have you brought the Lord ’ s assembly into this desert to kill us and our animals here ?
CEB	Numbers	20	5	Why have you led us up from Egypt to bring us to this evil place without grain , figs , vines , or pomegranates ? And there ’ s no water to drink ! ”
CEB	Numbers	20	6	Moses and Aaron went away from the assembly to the entrance of the meeting tent and they fell on their faces . Then the Lord ’ s glory appeared to them .
CEB	Numbers	20	7	The Lord spoke to Moses :
CEB	Numbers	20	8	“ You and Aaron your brother , take the staff and assemble the community . In their presence , tell the rock to provide water . You will produce water from the rock for them and allow the community and their animals to drink. ”
CEB	Numbers	20	9	Moses took the staff from the Lord ’ s presence , as the Lord had commanded him .
CEB	Numbers	20	10	Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly before the rock . He said to them , “ Listen , you rebels ! Should we produce water from the rock for you ? ”

CEB	Numbers	20	12	The Lord said to Moses and Aaron , “ Because you didn ’ t trust me to show my holiness before the Israelites , you will not bring this assembly into the land that I am giving them. ”

CEB	Numbers	20	16	and we cried out to the Lord . He heard our voice , sent a messenger , and brought us out of Egypt . Now here we are in Kadesh , a city on the edge of your border .
CEB	Numbers	20	17	Please let us cross through your land . We won ’ t pass through any field or vineyard , or drink water from any well . We will walk on the King ’ s Highway and not turn to the right or to the left until we have crossed your border. ’ ”
CEB	Numbers	20	18	Edom said to him , “ You won ’ t cross through , or I will come out against you with a sword. ”
CEB	Numbers	20	19	The Israelites said to him , “ We ’ ll go up by the road . If we drink from your water , either we or our livestock , we ’ ll pay for it . It ’ s a small matter . We would only ask to cross on foot. ”

CEB	Numbers	20	25	Take Aaron and his son Eleazar , and bring them up Mount Hor .
CEB	Numbers	20	26	Strip Aaron of his clothes and put them on Eleazar his son . Then Aaron will die there .

CEB	Numbers	21	4	They marched from Mount Hor on the Reed Sea [ b ] road around the land of Edom . The people became impatient on the road .
CEB	Numbers	21	5	The people spoke against God and Moses : “ Why did you bring us up from Egypt to kill us in the desert , where there is no food or water . And we detest this miserable bread ! ”
CEB	Numbers	21	6	So the Lord sent poisonous [ c ] snakes among the people and they bit the people . Many of the Israelites died .
CEB	Numbers	21	7	The people went to Moses and said , “ We ’ ve sinned , for we spoke against the Lord and you . Pray to the Lord so that he will send the snakes away from us. ” So Moses prayed for the people .
CEB	Numbers	21	8	The Lord said to Moses , “ Make a poisonous snake and place it on a pole . Whoever is bitten can look at it and live. ”
CEB	Numbers	21	9	Moses made a bronze snake and placed it on a pole . If a snake bit someone , that person could look at the bronze snake and live . March around Moab
CEB	Numbers	21	10	Then the Israelites marched and they camped at Oboth .
CEB	Numbers	21	11	They marched from Oboth and camped at Iye-abarim in the desert on the border of Moab toward the east .
CEB	Numbers	21	12	From there they marched and camped in the Zered ravine .
CEB	Numbers	21	13	From there they marched and camped across the Arnon in the desert that extends from the border of the Amorites , for the Arnon was the border of Moab , between Moab and the Amorites .
CEB	Numbers	21	14	For this reason the scroll of the Lord ’ s wars says : Waheb in Suphah and the ravines . The Arnon
CEB	Numbers	21	15	and the ravines that extend to the settlement of Ar and lie along the border of Moab .
CEB	Numbers	21	16	From there they marched to Beer , the well where the Lord said to Moses , “ Gather the people , and I ’ ll give them water. ”
CEB	Numbers	21	17	Then the Israelites sang this song : “ Well , flow up ! Sing about it !
CEB	Numbers	21	18	The well that the officials dug , that the officials of the people hollowed out with the ruler ’ s scepter and their staffs. ” They marched from the desert to Mattanah ;
CEB	Numbers	21	19	from Mattanah to Nahaliel ; from Nahaliel to Bamoth ;
CEB	Numbers	21	20	from Bamoth to the valley in the Moabite countryside , to the top of Pisgah overlooking Jeshimon . [ d ] Wars against Sihon and Og
CEB	Numbers	21	22	“ Let us pass through your land . We won ’ t turn aside into a field or vineyard . We won ’ t drink water from a well . We will walk on the King ’ s Highway until we cross your border. ”
CEB	Numbers	21	23	But Sihon wouldn ’ t allow the Israelites to cross his border . Sihon gathered all his people and went out to meet the Israelites in the desert . When he came to Jahaz , he attacked the Israelites .
CEB	Numbers	21	24	The Israelites struck him down with their swords and took possession of his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok , as far as the Ammonites , for the border of the Ammonites was fortified .
CEB	Numbers	21	25	The Israelites took all these cities . Then the Israelites settled in all the cities of the Amorites , in Heshbon and all its villages .
CEB	Numbers	21	26	Now Heshbon was the city of Sihon the Amorite king who had fought against the former king of Moab . He had taken all his land from him as far as the Arnon .
CEB	Numbers	21	27	Therefore , the poets say : “ Come to Heshbon , let it be built . Let the city of Sihon be established .
CEB	Numbers	21	28	Fire went out from Heshbon , flame from Sihon ’ s city . It consumed Ar of Moab and swallowed up the shrines of the Arnon .
CEB	Numbers	21	29	You are doomed , Moab ! You are destroyed , people of Chemosh ! He gave his sons as fugitives , and his daughters as captives to the Amorite king Sihon .
CEB	Numbers	21	30	Yet we have thrown them down , destroying them [ e ] from Heshbon to Dibon . We brought ruin until Nophah , which is by Medeba. ”
CEB	Numbers	21	31	Israel settled in the land of the Amorites .
CEB	Numbers	21	32	Moses sent spies to Jazer . They captured its villages and took possession of the Amorites who were there .
CEB	Numbers	21	33	Then they turned and ascended the road of Bashan . Og , Bashan ’ s king , came out at Edrei to meet them in battle , he and all his people .
CEB	Numbers	21	34	The Lord said to Moses : Don ’ t be afraid of him , for I have handed over all his people and his land . Do to him as you did to Sihon the Amorite king who ruled in Heshbon .
CEB	Numbers	21	35	They slaughtered Og , his sons , and all his people until there were no survivors . Then they took possession of his land .

CEB	Numbers	22	22	Then God became angry because he went . So while he was riding on his donkey accompanied by his two servants , the Lord ’ s messenger stood in the road as his adversary .
CEB	Numbers	22	2	Balak , Zippor ’ s son , saw everything that the Israelites did to the Amorites .
CEB	Numbers	22	3	The Moabites greatly feared the people , for they were so numerous . The Moabites were terrified of the Israelites .
CEB	Numbers	22	4	The Moabites said to the elders of Midian , “ Now this assembly will devour everything around us , as an ox eats up the grass in the field. ” Balak , Zippor ’ s son , was king of Moab at that time .
CEB	Numbers	22	5	He sent messengers to Balaam , Beor ’ s son , at Pethor , which is by the river in the land of his people , [ a ] to summon him : “ A people has come out of Egypt , and they have now covered the land . They have settled next to me .
CEB	Numbers	22	6	Now please come and curse this people for me because they are stronger than I am . Perhaps I ’ ll be able to destroy them and drive them from the land , for I know that whomever you bless is blessed and whomever you curse is cursed. ”
CEB	Numbers	22	7	So the elders of Moab and Midian went with the payment for divination in their hands . They came to Balaam and told him Balak ’ s words .
CEB	Numbers	22	8	He said to them , “ Spend the night here and I ’ ll bring back to you a word exactly as the Lord speaks to me. ” So the officials of Moab stayed with Balaam .
CEB	Numbers	22	9	God came to Balaam and said , “ Who are these men with you ? ”
CEB	Numbers	22	10	Balaam said to God , “ Moab ’ s King Balak , Zippor ’ s son , sent them to me with the message ,
CEB	Numbers	22	11	‘ A people has come out of Egypt and covered the land . Now come and curse them for me . Perhaps I ’ ll be able to fight against them and drive them out. ’ ”
CEB	Numbers	22	12	God said to Balaam , “ Don ’ t go with them . Don ’ t curse the people , because they are blessed. ”
CEB	Numbers	22	13	Then Balaam arose in the morning and said to Balak ’ s officials , “ Go to your land , for the Lord has refused to allow me to go with you. ”
CEB	Numbers	22	14	The officials of Moab arose , they went to Balak , and they said , “ Balaam refused to come with us. ”
CEB	Numbers	22	15	Balak continued to send other officials more numerous and important than these .
CEB	Numbers	22	16	They came to Balaam and said to him , “ This is what Balak , Zippor ’ s son , says : ‘ Please let nothing hold you back from coming to me ,
CEB	Numbers	22	17	for I ’ ll greatly honor you and I ’ ll do anything you ask of me . Please come and curse this people for me. ’ ”

CEB	Numbers	25	12	Therefore , say : I ’ m now giving him my covenant of well-being .

CEB	Numbers	31	26	You , Eleazar the priest , and the leaders of the community ’ s households must take an inventory of the valuable property and the captives , both human and animals ,
CEB	Numbers	31	27	and divide the valuable property between the warriors who went into battle and the entire community .
CEB	Numbers	31	28	You will offer as tribute to the Lord from each warrior who went into battle one living being in five hundred , whether human , oxen , donkeys , or flocks .
CEB	Numbers	31	29	Take it from the warriors ’ half and give it to Eleazar the priest as a gift offering to the Lord .

CEB	Numbers	31	61	.
CEB	Numbers	31	40	Humans were 16,000 , of which the Lord ’ s tribute was
CEB	Numbers	31	41	Moses gave the tribute , a gift offering for the Lord , to Eleazar the priest as the Lord had commanded Moses .
CEB	Numbers	31	42	As for the half-share of the Israelites that Moses divided from those who had gone out to battle :
CEB	Numbers	31	43	the community ’ s half-share was 337,500 sheep ,
CEB	Numbers	31	44	36,000 oxen ,
CEB	Numbers	31	45	30,500 donkeys ,
CEB	Numbers	31	46	and 16,000 humans .
CEB	Numbers	31	47	Moses took from the Israelites ’ half one out of every fifty , from humans and animals . He gave them to the Levites who carry out the duties of the Lord ’ s dwelling , just as the Lord had commanded Moses .
CEB	Numbers	31	48	The commanders over the thousands of the army , officers over thousands and officers over hundreds , approached Moses
CEB	Numbers	31	49	and said to Moses , “ Your servants have counted the warriors in our charge and not one of us is missing .
CEB	Numbers	31	50	We have brought the Lord ’ s offering that each found , gold articles—anklets , bracelets , signet rings , earrings , and necklaces—to seek reconciliation for ourselves before the Lord. ”
CEB	Numbers	31	51	Moses and Eleazar the priest took all the gold articles from them .
CEB	Numbers	31	52	All the gold for the gift offering that was presented to the Lord from the officers of thousands and the officers of hundreds was sixteen thousand seven hundred fifty shekels .
CEB	Numbers	31	53	Each of the men of battle took spoils of war for himself .
CEB	Numbers	31	54	Yet Moses and Eleazar the priest also received the gold from the officers of thousands and of hundreds , and they brought it to the meeting tent as a memorial for the Israelites before the Lord .
CEB	Numbers	32	32	We ’ ll cross into the land of Canaan before the Lord , equipped for war . But the property we inherit will be across the Jordan. ” Territory of Gad , Reuben , and half the tribe of Manasseh
CEB	Numbers	32	2	So the Gadites and the Reubenites came and said to Moses , Eleazar the priest , and the chiefs of the community :
CEB	Numbers	32	3	“ Ataroth , Dibon , Jazer , Nimrah , Heshbon , Elealeh , Sebam , Nebo , and Beon is
CEB	Numbers	32	4	the land that the Lord struck down before the Israelite community . It is a land for livestock , and your servants have livestock. ”
CEB	Numbers	32	5	They said , “ If you approve our request , give this land to your servants as property . Don ’ t make us cross the Jordan. ”
CEB	Numbers	32	6	Moses said to the Gadites and the Reubenites , “ Should your brothers go to war , while you stay here ?
CEB	Numbers	32	7	Why would you destroy the Israelites ’ resolve to cross into the land that the Lord gave them ?
CEB	Numbers	32	8	Your ancestors did this , when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to inspect the land .
CEB	Numbers	32	9	They went up to the Cluster ravine , saw the land , and destroyed the Israelites ’ resolve to enter the land that the Lord had given them .
CEB	Numbers	32	10	The Lord became angry on that day and promised ,
CEB	Numbers	32	11	‘ None of the persons that went up from Egypt , those
CEB	Numbers	32	20	Moses said to them , “ Do this and fight before the Lord in war .
CEB	Numbers	32	12	except Caleb , Jephunneh the Kenizzite ’ s son , and Joshua , Nun ’ s son , because they remained true to the Lord. ’
CEB	Numbers	32	13	The Lord became angry with the Israelites and made them wander in the desert for forty years until the entire generation had died , which had done evil in the Lord ’ s eyes .
CEB	Numbers	32	14	Now you ’ ve taken the place of your ancestors , a group of sinful men , to intensify the Lord ’ s anger against Israel .
CEB	Numbers	32	15	If you turn away from him , he will turn away again to abandon Israel in the desert . Then you will destroy this entire people. ” Conditions for possession of the land
CEB	Numbers	32	16	So they approached him and said , “ We will build walled enclosures here for our livestock and towns for our children .
CEB	Numbers	32	17	Then we will eagerly fight in front of the Israelites until we have brought them into their place . Our children will live in the fortified cities because of the land ’ s inhabitants .
CEB	Numbers	32	18	And we won ’ t return to our homes until each one of the Israelites takes possession of his property .
CEB	Numbers	32	19	We won ’ t inherit land with them there across the Jordan , because we ’ ve received our property on the east side of the Jordan. ”
CEB	Numbers	32	21	All of you who are equipped for war , cross the Jordan before the Lord until he has driven his enemies out before him
CEB	Numbers	32	22	and the land is subdued in the Lord ’ s presence . Then you may return innocently before the Lord and Israel , and this land will be your property before the Lord .
CEB	Numbers	32	23	But if you don ’ t do this , you ’ ve sinned against the Lord . Know that your sin will find you .
CEB	Numbers	32	24	So build towns for your children and walled enclosures for your flocks , but do what you have promised. ”
CEB	Numbers	32	25	The Gadites and the Reubenites said to Moses , “ Your servants will do as my master has commanded .
CEB	Numbers	32	26	Our children , wives , livestock , and all of our animals will remain in the cities of Gilead .
CEB	Numbers	32	27	But your servants , everyone equipped for war before the Lord , will go over to do battle as my master said. ”
CEB	Numbers	32	28	Moses made demands for them to Eleazar the priest , to Joshua , Nun ’ s son , and to the leaders of the households of the Israelite tribes .
CEB	Numbers	32	29	Moses said to them , “ If the Gadites and the Reubenites cross the Jordan with you , each equipped for battle before the Lord , and the land is subdued before you , then you will give them the land of Gilead as a possession .
CEB	Numbers	32	30	If , however , they don ’ t cross with you , equipped for war , they will take possession of property with you in the land of Canaan. ”
CEB	Numbers	32	31	The Gadites and the Reubenites answered , “ We ’ ll do just as the Lord has spoken to your servants .
CEB	Numbers	32	33	So Moses gave to them—to the Gadites , the Reubenites , and half the tribe of Manasseh , Joseph ’ s son—the kingdom of Sihon the king of the Amorites , and the kingdom of Og the king of Bashan , including the land , its cities , and the territory surrounding the land ’ s cities .

CEB	Numbers	33	49	They camped by the Jordan from Beth-jeshimoth to Abel-shittim in the plains of Moab . Divine instruction about the land
CEB	Numbers	33	50	The Lord spoke to Moses on the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho :
CEB	Numbers	33	51	Speak to the Israelites and say to them : When you cross the Jordan into the land of Canaan ,
CEB	Numbers	33	52	you will drive out all the inhabitants of the land before you . You will destroy all their carved figures . You will also destroy all their cast images . You will eliminate all their shrines .
CEB	Numbers	33	53	You will take possession of the land and live in it , because I ’ ve given the land to you to possess .
CEB	Numbers	33	54	You will divide up the land by lot according to your clans . To the large you will make its inheritance large , and to the small you will make its inheritance small . To whomever the lot falls , that place will be his . You will inherit land according to your ancestral tribes .
CEB	Numbers	33	55	But if you don ’ t drive out the inhabitants of the land before you , then those you allow to remain will prick your eyes and be thorns in your side . They will harass you in the land in which you are living .
CEB	Numbers	33	56	Then what I intended to do to them , I ’ ll do to you . Footnotes - Numbers 33:3 March–April , Nisan - Numbers 33:3 Or with a high hand - Numbers 33:10 Or Red Sea - Numbers 33:38 July–August , probably Av
CEB	Numbers	34	34	The Lord said to Moses :
CEB	Numbers	34	2	Command the Israelites and say to them : When you enter the land of Canaan , this is the land that will fall to you as an inheritance . The land of Canaan according to its boundaries :
CEB	Numbers	34	3	Your southern boundary extends from the Zin desert alongside Edom . Your southern border extends from the edge of the Dead Sea on the east .
CEB	Numbers	34	4	Your border will turn south of the ascent of Akrabbim and cross toward Zin . Its limit will be south of Kadesh-barnea . It will go out to Hazar-addar and cross toward Azmon .
CEB	Numbers	34	5	The border will then turn from Azmon to the Egypt ravine . Its limit will be at the Mediterranean Sea .
CEB	Numbers	34	6	Your western border will be the Mediterranean Sea . This will be your western border .
CEB	Numbers	34	7	This will be your northern border : From the Mediterranean Sea you will mark out your boundary to Mount Hor .
CEB	Numbers	34	8	From Mount Hor you will mark out your boundary to Lebo-hamath . The limit of the border will be Zedad .
CEB	Numbers	34	9	The border will go out to Ziphron . Its limit will be Hazar-enan . This will be your northern border .
CEB	Numbers	34	10	You will mark out your eastern border from Hazar-enan to Shepham .
CEB	Numbers	34	11	The border will descend from Shepham to Riblah on the east side of Ain . The border will go down and meet the eastern slope of the Galilee Sea .
CEB	Numbers	34	12	The border will descend to the Jordan . Its limit will be the Dead Sea . This will be your land with its borders all around .
CEB	Numbers	34	13	Moses commanded the Israelites : This is the land that you will inherit by lot , which the Lord has commanded to give to the nine and a half tribes ,
CEB	Numbers	34	14	because the tribe of Reuben by their households and the tribe of Gad by their households , and half the tribe of Manasseh have taken their inheritance .
CEB	Numbers	34	15	The two and a half tribes have taken their inheritance across the Jordan at Jericho toward the east . Appointment of leaders to assign the inheritance
CEB	Numbers	34	16	The Lord spoke to Moses :
CEB	Numbers	34	17	These are the names of the men who will assign the inheritance of the land : Eleazar the priest and Joshua , Nun ’ s son .
CEB	Numbers	34	18	You will also take one chief from each tribe to apportion the land .
CEB	Numbers	34	19	These are the names of the men : from the tribe of Judah , Caleb , Jephunneh ’ s son ;
CEB	Numbers	34	20	from the tribe of the Simeonites , Shemuel , Ammihud ’ s son ;
CEB	Numbers	34	21	from the tribe of Benjamin , Elidad , Chislon ’ s son ;
CEB	Numbers	34	22	from the tribe of the Danites , a chief , Bukki , Jogli ’ s son ;
CEB	Numbers	34	23	from Joseph ’ s descendants : of the tribe of the Manassites , a chief , Hanniel , Ephod ’ s son ;
CEB	Numbers	34	24	and from the tribe of the Ephraimites , a chief , Kemuel , Shiphtan ’ s son ;
CEB	Numbers	34	25	from the tribe of the Zebulunites , a chief , Elizaphan , Parnach ’ s son ;

CEB	Numbers	34	29	These are the ones whom the Lord commanded to assign the inheritance of the Israelites in the land of Canaan .
CEB	Numbers	35	35	) the close relative of the blood - Numbers 35:33 Or reconciliation
CEB	Numbers	35	2	Command the Israelites that they give cities from their inherited property to the Levites in which to live . You will also give the Levites pastures around their cities .
CEB	Numbers	35	3	The cities will be theirs in which to live . Their pastures will be for their cattle , their possessions , and all their animals .
CEB	Numbers	35	4	The pastures of the cities that you must give to the Levites will extend from the wall of the city outward for one thousand five hundred feet in all directions .
CEB	Numbers	35	5	You will measure outside the city on the east side three thousand feet , on the south side three thousand feet , on the west side three thousand feet , and on the north side three thousand feet , with the city in the middle . These will be their cities ’ pastures .
CEB	Numbers	35	6	Six of the cities that you give to the Levites will be refuge cities . You will allow the person who kills someone to flee there . In addition to these you will give them forty-two cities .
CEB	Numbers	35	7	All the cities that you give to the Levites will total forty-eight , along with their pastures .
CEB	Numbers	35	8	As for the cities that you give from the property of the Israelites , you will take more from the larger tribes and less from the smaller . Each in proportion to its inheritance will give cities to the Levites . Refuge cities
CEB	Numbers	35	9	The Lord spoke to Moses :
CEB	Numbers	35	10	Speak to the Israelites and say to them : When you cross the Jordan into the land of Canaan ,
CEB	Numbers	35	11	identify for yourselves cities to be refuge cities , where a person who kills someone by accident may flee .
CEB	Numbers	35	12	The cities will be for you a place of refuge from the close relative of the dead . The person who killed someone may not be put to death until he stands before the community for judgment .
CEB	Numbers	35	13	You will establish six refuge cities for yourselves .
CEB	Numbers	35	14	You will establish three cities across the Jordan and three cities in the land of Canaan . They will be the refuge cities .
CEB	Numbers	35	15	These six cities will be refuge for Israelites , immigrants , and temporary residents , as a place to flee for anyone who kills a person by accident .
CEB	Numbers	35	16	But if someone strikes a person with an iron object and he dies , he is a murderer . The murderer must definitely be put to death .
CEB	Numbers	35	17	If someone strikes another with a stone in hand that could cause death and he dies , he is a murderer . The murderer must definitely be put to death .
CEB	Numbers	35	18	Or if someone strikes with a wood object in hand that could cause death , he is a murderer . The murderer must definitely be put to death .
CEB	Numbers	35	19	The close relative responsible for the blood [ a ] of the dead is the one who will put the murderer to death . When he meets him , he will execute him .
CEB	Numbers	35	20	If in hatred someone hits another or throws something at him with premeditation , he will be put to death .
CEB	Numbers	35	21	Or if in hostility someone strikes another with his hand and he dies , the one who struck is a murderer and he will be put to death . The close relative will put the murderer to death when he meets him .
CEB	Numbers	35	22	But if suddenly and without hostility someone hits another or throws any object at him without premeditation ,
CEB	Numbers	35	23	or accidentally drops any stone on him that could cause death and he dies—even though they weren ’ t enemies and no evil was intended—
CEB	Numbers	35	24	then the community must come to a verdict between the killer and the close relative in accordance with these case laws .
CEB	Numbers	35	25	The community will protect the killer from the hand of the close relative and return him to the refuge city where he fled . He will live there until the death of the high priest who was anointed with holy oil .
CEB	Numbers	35	26	But if the killer ever goes outside the boundaries of the refuge city where he fled
CEB	Numbers	35	27	and the close relative finds him outside the boundary of his refuge city and kills him , he will not be responsible for his blood .
CEB	Numbers	35	28	The killer must live in his refuge city until the high priest ’ s death . After the high priest ’ s death the killer may return to the land he owns .
CEB	Numbers	35	29	These will be the regulations and case laws for all time in all your settlements .
CEB	Numbers	35	30	Anyone who kills another will be executed on the evidence of witnesses . But one witness alone can not testify against a person for a death sentence .
CEB	Numbers	35	31	You may not accept a ransom for the life of a killer , who is guilty of a capital crime , for he must definitely be put to death .
CEB	Numbers	35	32	You may not accept a ransom for someone who has fled to his refuge city so that he can return and live in the land before the priest ’ s death .
CEB	Numbers	35	33	You may not pollute the land in which you live , for the blood pollutes the land . There can be no recovery [ b ] for the land from the blood that is shed in it , except by the blood of the one who shed it .
CEB	Numbers	35	34	You will not make the land in which you live unclean , the land in the middle of which I reside , for I the Lord reside among the Israelites . Footnotes - Numbers 35:19 Or ( here and throughout Num
CEB	Numbers	36	36	The leaders of the households of the clans of Gilead , Machir ’ s son and Manasseh ’ s grandson , of Joseph ’ s clans , approached and spoke before Moses and the chiefs , who were the leaders of the Israelite households .
CEB	Numbers	36	2	They said , “ The Lord commanded my master to give the land as an inheritance by lot to the Israelites . But my master was also commanded by the Lord to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother to his daughters .
CEB	Numbers	36	3	If they are married to someone from another Israelite tribe , their inheritance will be taken away from our household and given to another tribe into which they marry . Then it will be taken away from the lot of our inheritance .
CEB	Numbers	36	4	At the Israelite Jubilee , their inheritance will be added to the inheritance of the tribe into which they married . Then their inheritance will be taken away from the inheritance of our ancestral tribe. ”
CEB	Numbers	36	5	Then Moses commanded the Israelites according to the Lord ’ s word : “ The tribe of Joseph ’ s descendants are correct in what they ’ re saying .
CEB	Numbers	36	6	This is the word that the Lord commands to Zelophehad ’ s daughters : They may marry whomever seems best to them , but they may only marry into one of the clans of their ancestral tribe ,
CEB	Numbers	36	7	so that the inheritance of the Israelites doesn ’ t transfer from one tribe to another . The Israelites will each retain the tribal inheritance of his ancestral tribe .
CEB	Numbers	36	8	Every daughter who inherits land from an Israelite tribe must marry into one of the clans of her father ’ s tribe . In this way each Israelite will own the land of his ancestors .
CEB	Numbers	36	9	An inheritance of land may not be transferred from one tribe to another , for the Israelite tribes will each retain its own inheritance. ”
CEB	Numbers	36	10	Zelophehad ’ s daughters did as the Lord commanded Moses .
CEB	Numbers	36	11	Mahlah , Tirzah , Hoglah , Milcah , and Noah , Zelophehad ’ s daughters , married their cousins .
CEB	Numbers	36	12	They married into the clan of Manasseh , Joseph ’ s son . Their inheritance remained in the tribe of their father ’ s clan . Conclusion
CEB	Numbers	36	13	These are the commandments and the case laws that the Lord commanded the Israelites through Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho .
CEB	Deuteronomy	1	1	These are the words that Moses spoke to all Israel across the Jordan River , in the desert , on the plain across from Suph , between Paran and Tophel , Laban , Hazeroth , and Di-zahab . (
CEB	Deuteronomy	1	2	It is eleven days from Horeb to Kadesh-barnea along the Mount Seir route . )
CEB	Deuteronomy	1	3	It was in the fortieth year , on the first day of the eleventh month , that Moses spoke to the Israelites precisely what the Lord had commanded him for them . (
CEB	Deuteronomy	1	4	This was after the defeat of Sihon , the Amorite king who ruled in Heshbon , and Og , Bashan ’ s king , who ruled in Ashtaroth and [ a ] Edrei . )
CEB	Deuteronomy	1	5	Beyond the Jordan , in the land of Moab , Moses began to explain this Instruction . He said the following : Leaving Mount Horeb
CEB	Deuteronomy	1	6	At Horeb , the Lord our God told us : You ’ ve been at this mountain long enough .
CEB	Deuteronomy	1	7	Get going ! Enter the hills of the Amorites and the surrounding areas in the desert , the highlands , the lowlands , the arid southern region , and the seacoast—the land of the Canaanites—and the Lebanon range , all the way to the great Euphrates River .
CEB	Deuteronomy	1	8	Look , I have laid the land before you . Go and possess the land that I [ b ] promised to give to your ancestors Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , as well as to their descendants after them .
CEB	Deuteronomy	1	9	At that same time , I told you : I can ’ t handle all of you by myself .
CEB	Deuteronomy	1	10	The Lord your God has multiplied your number—you are now as countless as the stars in the sky .
CEB	Deuteronomy	1	11	May the Lord , your ancestors ’ God , continue to multiply you—a thousand times more ! And may God bless you , just as he promised .
CEB	Deuteronomy	1	12	But how can I handle all your troubles , burdens , and disputes by myself ?
CEB	Deuteronomy	1	13	Now , for each of your tribes , choose wise , discerning , and well-regarded individuals . I will appoint them as your leaders .
CEB	Deuteronomy	1	14	You answered me : “ What you have proposed is a good idea. ”
CEB	Deuteronomy	1	15	So I took leading individuals from your tribes , people who were wise and well-regarded , and I set them up as your leaders . There were commanders over thousands , hundreds , fifties , and tens , as well as officials for each of your tribes .
CEB	Deuteronomy	1	16	At that same time , I commanded your judges : Listen to your fellow tribe members and judge fairly , whether the dispute is between one fellow tribe member or between a tribe member and an immigrant .
CEB	Deuteronomy	1	17	Don ’ t show favoritism in a decision . Hear both sides out , whether the person is important or not . Don ’ t be afraid of anyone because the ruling belongs to God . Any dispute that is too difficult for you to decide , bring to me and I will take care of it .
CEB	Deuteronomy	1	18	So at that time , I commanded you concerning everything you were to do . The spy disaster
CEB	Deuteronomy	1	19	We left Horeb and journeyed through that vast and terrifying desert you saw , on the way to the hills of the Amorites , exactly as the Lord our God commanded us . Then we arrived at Kadesh-barnea .
CEB	Deuteronomy	1	20	I said to you : You have come to the hills of the Amorites , which the Lord our God is giving to us .
CEB	Deuteronomy	1	21	Look ! The Lord your God has laid out the land before you . Go up and take it , just as the Lord , your ancestors ’ God , has promised you . Don ’ t be afraid ! Don ’ t be frightened !
CEB	Deuteronomy	1	22	Then all of you approached me , saying , “ Let ’ s send spies ahead of us—they can check out the land for us . Then they can return with word about the route we should use and bring a report about the cities that we ’ ll be entering. ”
CEB	Deuteronomy	1	23	This idea seemed good to me , so I selected twelve men , one from each tribe .
CEB	Deuteronomy	1	24	These set out and went up into the hills , going as far as the Cluster [ c ] ravine . They walked all around that area .
CEB	Deuteronomy	1	25	They took some of the land ’ s fruit and then came back down to us . They reported to us : “ The land that the Lord our God is giving to us is wonderful ! ”
CEB	Deuteronomy	1	26	But you weren ’ t willing to go up . You rejected the Lord your God ’ s instruction .
CEB	Deuteronomy	1	27	You complained in your tents , saying things like , “ The Lord hates us ! That ’ s why he brought us out of Egypt—to hand us over to the Amorites , to destroy us !
CEB	Deuteronomy	1	28	What are we doing ? Our brothers have made our hearts sick by saying , ‘ People far stronger and much taller than we live there , and the cities are huge , with walls sky-high ! Worse still , we saw the descendants of the Anakites there ! ’ ”
CEB	Deuteronomy	1	29	But I said to you : Don ’ t be terrified ! Don ’ t be afraid of them !
CEB	Deuteronomy	1	30	The Lord your God is going before you . He will fight for you just as he fought for you in Egypt while you watched ,
CEB	Deuteronomy	1	31	and as you saw him do in the desert . Throughout your entire journey , until you reached this very place , the Lord your God has carried you just as a parent carries a child .
CEB	Deuteronomy	1	32	But you had no faith in the Lord your God about this matter ,
CEB	Deuteronomy	1	33	even though he went ahead of you , scouting places where you should camp , in fire by night , so you could see the road you were taking , and in cloud during the daytime .
CEB	Deuteronomy	1	34	The Lord heard what you said . He was angry and he swore :
CEB	Deuteronomy	1	35	Not even one of these people—this wicked generation ! —will see the wonderful land that I promised to give to your ancestors .
CEB	Deuteronomy	1	36	The only exception is Caleb , Jephunneh ’ s son . He will see it . I will give the land he walked on to him and his children for this reason : he was completely devoted to the Lord . (
CEB	Deuteronomy	1	37	The Lord was even angry with me because of what you did . “ You won ’ t enter the land either , ” God said .
CEB	Deuteronomy	1	38	“ But Nun ’ s son Joshua , your assistant , will enter it . Strengthen him because he ’ s the one who will help Israel inherit the land. ” )
CEB	Deuteronomy	1	39	Now as for your toddlers , those you said would be taken in war , and your young children who don ’ t yet know right and wrong—they will enter the land . I will give it to them . They will possess it !
CEB	Deuteronomy	1	40	But you all must now turn around . Head back toward the wilderness along the route of the Reed Sea . [ d ]
CEB	Deuteronomy	1	41	You replied to me : “ We ’ ve sinned against the Lord ! We will go up ! We will fight , just as the Lord our God commanded. ” Each one of you grabbed your weapons . You thought it would be easy [ e ] to go up into the hills .
CEB	Deuteronomy	1	42	But the Lord told me : Tell them : Don ’ t go up ! Don ’ t fight because I will not be with you . You will be defeated by your enemies .
CEB	Deuteronomy	1	43	I reported this to you but you wouldn ’ t listen . You disobeyed the Lord ’ s instruction . Hotheadedly , you went up into the hills .
CEB	Deuteronomy	1	44	And the Amorites who lived in those hills came out to meet you in battle . They chased you like bees give chase ! They gave you a beating from Seir all the way to Hormah .
CEB	Deuteronomy	1	45	When you came back , you cried before the Lord , but he wouldn ’ t respond to your tears or give you a hearing .
CEB	Deuteronomy	1	46	And so you stayed in Kadesh-barnea for quite some time .

CEB	Deuteronomy	2	2	Eventually the Lord said :
CEB	Deuteronomy	2	3	You ’ ve been traveling around this mountain long enough . Head north .
CEB	Deuteronomy	2	4	Command the people as follows : You are about to enter into the territory of your relatives who live in Seir : Esau ’ s descendants . They will be afraid of you , so watch yourselves most carefully .
CEB	Deuteronomy	2	5	Don ’ t fight with them because I will not give the tiniest parcel of their land to you . I have given Mount Seir to Esau ’ s family as their property .
CEB	Deuteronomy	2	6	Of course you may buy food from them with money so you can eat , and also water with money so you can drink .
CEB	Deuteronomy	2	7	No doubt about it : the Lord your God has blessed you in all that you have done . He watched over your journey through that vast desert . Throughout these forty years the Lord your God has been with you . You haven ’ t needed a thing .
CEB	Deuteronomy	2	8	So we passed through the territory of our relatives who live in Seir , Esau ’ s descendants , leaving the desert road from Elath and from Ezion-geber . Next we turned and went along the Moab wilderness route .
CEB	Deuteronomy	2	9	The Lord said to me : Don ’ t aggravate Moab . Don ’ t fight them in battle because I won ’ t give any part of their land to you as your own . I have given Ar to Lot ’ s descendants as their property . (
CEB	Deuteronomy	2	10	Now the Emim [ b ] had lived there before . They were big and numerous and tall—just like the Anakim .
CEB	Deuteronomy	2	11	Most people thought the Emim were Rephaim , like the Anakim were . But the Moabites called them “ Emim. ”
CEB	Deuteronomy	2	12	Additionally , the Horim [ c ] had lived in Seir previously , but Esau ’ s descendants took possession of their area , eliminating them altogether and settling in their place . That is exactly what Israel did in the land it took possession of , which the Lord gave to them . )
CEB	Deuteronomy	2	13	“ So then , get going . Cross the Zered ravine. ” So we crossed the Zered ravine .
CEB	Deuteronomy	2	14	It took us a total of thirty-eight years to go from Kadesh-barnea until we crossed the Zered ravine . It was at that point that the last of the previous generation , every one of fighting age in the camp , had died , just as the Lord had sworn about them .
CEB	Deuteronomy	2	15	In fact , the Lord ’ s power was against them , to rid the camp of them , until they were all gone .
CEB	Deuteronomy	2	16	Now as soon as all those of fighting age had died ,
CEB	Deuteronomy	2	17	the Lord said to me :
CEB	Deuteronomy	2	18	Today you are crossing through the territory of Moab and Ar
CEB	Deuteronomy	2	19	and you will come close to the Ammonites . Don ’ t aggravate them . Don ’ t fight with them because I won ’ t give any part of the Ammonites ’ land to you as your own . I ’ ve given it to Lot ’ s descendants as their property .
CEB	Deuteronomy	2	20	Now people thought that land was Rephaim territory as well . The Rephaim had lived there previously . But the Ammonites called them “ Zamzummim. ” [ d ]
CEB	Deuteronomy	2	21	They were large , numerous , and tall , just like the Anakim . But the Lord completely destroyed the Zamzummim before the Ammonites , and they took possession of that area , settling in their place .
CEB	Deuteronomy	2	22	That is exactly what God did for Esau ’ s descendants , who live in Seir , when he completely destroyed the Horites in their presence , and they took possession of the Horites ’ area , settling in their place to this very day .
CEB	Deuteronomy	2	23	The Avvim , [ e ] who had lived in settlements around Gaza , were completely destroyed by the Caphtorim , who had come from Caphtor . They replaced the Avvim there . Victories in Transjordan
CEB	Deuteronomy	2	24	“ So get going . Cross the Arnon ravine . I have handed Sihon the Amorite king of Heshbon and his land over to you . It ’ s time to possess the area ! It ’ s time to fight him in battle !
CEB	Deuteronomy	2	25	Starting right now , I am making everyone everywhere afraid of you and scared of you . Once they hear news of you , they will be shaking and worrying because of you. ”
CEB	Deuteronomy	2	26	I then sent messengers from the Kedemoth desert to Sihon , Heshbon ’ s king , with words of peace :
CEB	Deuteronomy	2	27	“ Please let us [ f ] pass through your land . We promise to stay on the road . We won ’ t step off it , right or left .
CEB	Deuteronomy	2	28	Please sell us food for money so we can eat ; sell us water for money so we can drink . Let us pass through on foot—
CEB	Deuteronomy	2	29	just as Esau ’ s descendants who live in Seir and the Moabites who live in Ar did for me—until we cross the Jordan River into the land that the Lord our God is giving to us. ”
CEB	Deuteronomy	2	30	But Sihon , Heshbon ’ s king , wasn ’ t willing to let us pass through his land because the Lord your God had made his spirit hard and his heart inflexible so that God could hand him over to you , which is exactly how it happened .
CEB	Deuteronomy	2	31	The Lord said to me : Look ! Right now I ’ m laying Sihon and his land before you . It ’ s time to take possession of his land !
CEB	Deuteronomy	2	32	Sihon and all his forces came out to meet us in battle at Jahaz .
CEB	Deuteronomy	2	33	But the Lord our God gave him to us . We struck him down , along with his sons , and all his forces .
CEB	Deuteronomy	2	34	At that time , we captured all of Sihon ’ s cities , and we placed every town—men , women , and children—under the ban . [ g ] We left no survivors .
CEB	Deuteronomy	2	35	The only things we kept for ourselves were the animals and the plunder from the towns we had taken .
CEB	Deuteronomy	2	36	From Aroer , which is on the edge of the Arnon Ravine , to the town that is in the valley there , [ h ] even as far as Gilead , there wasn ’ t a city that could resist us . The Lord our God laid everything out before us .
CEB	Deuteronomy	2	37	But you didn ’ t go near the Ammonite lands or hillside cities alongside the Jabbok River , in compliance with all [ i ] that the Lord our God had commanded .

CEB	Deuteronomy	3	3	And so the Lord our God also handed Og , Bashan ’ s king , along with his forces , over to us . We struck them down until no survivor was left .
CEB	Deuteronomy	3	2	The Lord said to me : Don ’ t be afraid of him ! I have handed him , all his forces , and his land over to you . Do the same thing to him that you did to Sihon , the Amorite king who ruled in Heshbon .
CEB	Deuteronomy	3	4	We also captured all of Og ’ s towns at that time . There wasn ’ t a single city that we didn ’ t take from them—a total of sixty towns , the entire region of Argob , the whole kingdom of Og in Bashan .
CEB	Deuteronomy	3	5	Each of these towns was fortified with high walls , double gates , and crossbars . Outside the towns there were also a great number of villages . [ a ]
CEB	Deuteronomy	3	6	We placed them under the ban , just as we did with Sihon , Heshbon ’ s king . Every town—men , women , and children—was under the ban . [ b ]
CEB	Deuteronomy	3	7	The only things we kept for ourselves were the animals and the plunder from the towns .
CEB	Deuteronomy	3	8	So at that time , we took the land that had belonged to the two Amorite kings beyond the Jordan , all the way from the Arnon Ravine to Mount Hermon (
CEB	Deuteronomy	3	9	Sidonians call Hermon “ Sirion , ” but the Amorites call it “ Senir ” ) ,
CEB	Deuteronomy	3	10	including all the towns on the plateau , in the regions of Gilead and Bashan , and all the way to Salecah and Edrei—all the towns that belonged to Og ’ s kingdom in Bashan . (
CEB	Deuteronomy	3	11	By the way , Bashan ’ s King Og was the last of the Rephaim . His bed was made of iron . Isn ’ t it still in the Ammonite town of Rabbah ? By standard measurements , it was thirteen and a half feet long and six feet wide . )
CEB	Deuteronomy	3	12	So this is the land we possessed at that time . I gave some of it , from Aroer , which is beside the Arnon River , up through half of the Gilead highlands , along with its cities , to the Reubenites and the Gadites .
CEB	Deuteronomy	3	13	The rest of the Gilead region and all of Bashan , Og ’ s kingdom , I gave to half the tribe of Manasseh . ( Now the whole Argob area , including all of Bashan , was often called Rephaim Country .
CEB	Deuteronomy	3	14	Jair , from the tribe of Manasseh , took possession of the entire Argob region , as far as the border with the Geshurites and the Maacathites . He named the Bashan area after himself , Jair ’ s Settlement . That ’ s what it ’ s still called today . )
CEB	Deuteronomy	3	15	I also gave Gilead to Machir .
CEB	Deuteronomy	3	16	To the Reubenites and the Gadites , I gave land from the Gilead , as far as the Arnon River—the middle of the river being the boundary line—to the Jabbok River , which is the boundary line with the Ammonites .
CEB	Deuteronomy	3	17	Also the desert plain , with the Jordan River as the boundary , from the Galilee Sea [ c ] down to the desert sea ( the Dead Sea [ d ] ) below the slopes of Mount Pisgah on the east .
CEB	Deuteronomy	3	18	Then I commanded you : Although the Lord your God has given you this land to possess , you must now cross over before the rest of your Israelite relatives as a fighting force ready for battle !
CEB	Deuteronomy	3	19	However , your wives , children , and herds—I know you have lots of herds ! —may remain in the towns that I have given to you .
CEB	Deuteronomy	3	20	Once the Lord settles your relatives , as you have been settled , and they also possess the land that the Lord your God is giving them across the Jordan River , each of you can return to the property that I have given to you .
CEB	Deuteronomy	3	21	It was at that same time that I commanded Joshua : You saw everything that the Lord your God did to these two kings . That is exactly what the Lord will do to all the kingdoms where you ’ re going !
CEB	Deuteronomy	3	22	Don ’ t be afraid of them because the Lord your God is the one who will be fighting for you . Moses ’ prayer
CEB	Deuteronomy	3	23	It was also at that same time that I begged the Lord :
CEB	Deuteronomy	3	24	Please , Lord God ! You have only begun to show your servant your greatness and your mighty hand . What god in heaven or on earth can act as you do or can perform your deeds and powerful acts ?
CEB	Deuteronomy	3	25	Please let me cross over the Jordan River so I can see the wonderful land that lies beyond it : those beautiful highlands , even the Lebanon region .
CEB	Deuteronomy	3	26	But the Lord was angry with me because of you ! He wouldn ’ t listen to me . He said to me : That ’ s enough from you ! Don ’ t ever ask me about this again !
CEB	Deuteronomy	3	27	Go up to the top of Mount Pisgah . Look west , north , south , and east . Have a good look , but you will not cross the Jordan River .
CEB	Deuteronomy	3	28	Instead , command Joshua , strengthen him , and encourage him because he ’ s the one who will cross the river before this people . He ’ s the one who will make sure they inherit the land you will see .
CEB	Deuteronomy	3	29	After that , we stayed in the valley across from Beth-peor . Footnotes - Deuteronomy 3:5 Heb uncertain - Deuteronomy 3:6 See note at 2:34 . - Deuteronomy 3:17 Heb Chinnereth - Deuteronomy 3:17 Or the Salt Sea
CEB	Deuteronomy	4	4	but all of you who stayed true to the Lord your God are alive today .
CEB	Deuteronomy	4	2	Don ’ t add anything to the word that I am commanding you , and don ’ t take anything away from it . Instead , keep the commands of the Lord your God that I am commanding all of you .
CEB	Deuteronomy	4	3	You saw with your own eyes what the Lord did concerning the Baal of Peor . The Lord your God destroyed everyone who followed the Baal of Peor ,
CEB	Deuteronomy	4	5	So pay attention ! I am teaching all of you the regulations and the case laws exactly as the Lord my God commanded me . You must do these in the land you are entering to possess .
CEB	Deuteronomy	4	6	Keep them faithfully because that will show your wisdom and insight to the nations who will hear about all these regulations . They will say , “ Surely this great nation is a wise and insightful people ! ”
CEB	Deuteronomy	4	7	After all , is there any great nation that has gods [ a ] as close to it as the Lord our God is close to us whenever we call to him ?
CEB	Deuteronomy	4	8	Or does any great nation have regulations and case laws as righteous as all this Instruction that I am setting before you today ?
CEB	Deuteronomy	4	9	But be on guard and watch yourselves closely so that you don ’ t forget the things your eyes saw and so they never leave your mind as long as you live . Teach them to your children and your grandchildren .
CEB	Deuteronomy	4	10	Remember that [ b ] day when you stood before the Lord your God at Horeb , when the Lord said to me : “ Gather the people to me . I will declare my words to them so that they will learn to fear me every day of their lives on the fertile land , and teach their children to do the same. ”
CEB	Deuteronomy	4	11	Then you all came close and stood at the foot of the mountain . The mountain was blazing with fire up to the sky , with darkness , cloud , and thick smoke !
CEB	Deuteronomy	4	12	The Lord spoke to you out of the very fire itself . You heard the sound of words , but you didn ’ t see any form . There was only a voice .
CEB	Deuteronomy	4	13	The Lord declared his covenant to you , which he commanded you to do—the Ten Commandments [ c ] —and wrote them on two stone tablets .
CEB	Deuteronomy	4	14	At that time , the Lord commanded me to teach you all the regulations and the case laws that you must keep in the land that you are entering to possess .
CEB	Deuteronomy	4	15	So watch your conduct closely , because you didn ’ t see any form on the day the Lord spoke to you at Horeb out of the very fire itself .
CEB	Deuteronomy	4	16	Don ’ t ruin everything and make an idol for yourself : a form of any image , any likeness—male or female—
CEB	Deuteronomy	4	17	or any likeness whatsoever , whether of a land animal , a bird that flies in the sky ,
CEB	Deuteronomy	4	18	an insect that crawls on the earth , or a fish that lives in the sea .
CEB	Deuteronomy	4	19	Don ’ t look to the skies , to the sun or the moon or the stars , all the heavenly bodies , and be led astray , worshipping and serving them . The Lord your God has granted these things to all the nations who live under heaven .
CEB	Deuteronomy	4	20	But the Lord took you and brought you out of that iron furnace , out of Egypt , so that you might be his own treasured people , which is what you are right now .
CEB	Deuteronomy	4	21	The Lord was angry with me because of your deeds and swore that I couldn ’ t cross the Jordan River or enter the wonderful land that the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance .
CEB	Deuteronomy	4	22	I will die here in this land . I won ’ t cross the Jordan River . But you will , and you will take possession of that wonderful land .
CEB	Deuteronomy	4	23	So all of you , watch yourselves ! Don ’ t forget the covenant that the Lord your God made with you by making an idol or an image of any kind or anything the Lord your God forbids ,
CEB	Deuteronomy	4	24	because the Lord your God is an all-consuming fire . He is a passionate God . Warnings and teachings about future disobedience
CEB	Deuteronomy	4	25	Once you have had children and grandchildren and have grown old on the land , if you ruin things by making an idol , in any form whatsoever , and do what is evil in the eyes of the Lord your God and anger him ,
CEB	Deuteronomy	4	26	I call heaven and earth as my witnesses against you today : You will definitely disappear—and quickly—from the land that you are crossing over the Jordan River to possess . You won ’ t extend your time there but will instead be totally destroyed .
CEB	Deuteronomy	4	27	The Lord will scatter you among the nations . Only a very few of you will survive in the countries where the Lord will drag you .
CEB	Deuteronomy	4	28	There you will worship other [ d ] gods , made of wood and stone by human hands—gods that can not see , listen , eat , or smell .
CEB	Deuteronomy	4	29	You will seek the Lord your God from there , and you will find him [ e ] if you seek him with all your heart and with all your being .
CEB	Deuteronomy	4	30	In your distress , when all these things happen to you in the future , you will return to the Lord your God and you will obey his voice ,
CEB	Deuteronomy	4	31	because the Lord your God is a compassionate God . He won ’ t let you go , he won ’ t destroy you , and he won ’ t forget the covenant that he swore to your ancestors .
CEB	Deuteronomy	4	32	Now look into it : into days long past , before your time—all the way back to the day God first created human beings on earth , from one end of heaven to the other . Has anything this amazing ever happened ? Has anything like it ever been heard of before ?
CEB	Deuteronomy	4	33	Has any people ever listened to a god ’ s voice speaking out of fire , as each of you have , and survived ?
CEB	Deuteronomy	4	34	Or has any god ever tried to take one nation out of another nation using tests , miracles , wonders , war , a strong hand and outstretched arm , or awesome power like all that the Lord your God did for you in Egypt while you watched ?
CEB	Deuteronomy	4	35	You were shown these things so that you would know this : The Lord is the only God . There ’ s no other god except him .
CEB	Deuteronomy	4	36	From heaven he made you hear his voice in order to discipline you . On earth he showed you his great fire . You heard his words from that very fire .
CEB	Deuteronomy	4	37	And because he loved your ancestors and chose their descendants after them , God brought you out of Egypt with his own presence , by his own great power ,
CEB	Deuteronomy	4	38	in order to remove larger and stronger nations from before you and bring you into their land , giving it to you as an inheritance . That ’ s where things stand right now .
CEB	Deuteronomy	4	39	Know then today and keep in mind that the Lord is the only God in heaven above or on earth below . There is no other .
CEB	Deuteronomy	4	40	Keep the Lord ’ s regulations and his commandments . I ’ m commanding them to you today for your well-being and for the well-being of your children after you , so that you may extend your time on the fertile land that the Lord your God is giving you forever . Cities of refuge
CEB	Deuteronomy	4	41	Then Moses set aside three cities on the eastern side of the Jordan River
CEB	Deuteronomy	4	42	so that anyone who killed someone accidentally and without prior hatred could flee to one of these cities and be safe :
CEB	Deuteronomy	4	43	Bezer in the wilderness on the plateau for the Reubenites , Ramoth in Gilead for the Gadites , and Golan in Bashan for the Manassites . The second heading : Recounting the Horeb covenant
CEB	Deuteronomy	4	44	Now this is the Instruction that Moses set before the Israelites .
CEB	Deuteronomy	4	45	These are the laws and the regulations and the case laws that Moses spoke to the Israelites when they came out of Egypt .
CEB	Deuteronomy	4	46	This took place across the Jordan River , in the valley opposite Beth-peor , in the land of Sihon the Amorite king who ruled in Heshbon , whom Moses and the Israelites defeated when they came out of Egypt .
CEB	Deuteronomy	4	47	They took possession of his land and the land of Og , Bashan ’ s king—the two Amorite kings across the Jordan River to the east—
CEB	Deuteronomy	4	48	from Aroer , which is on the banks of the Arnon River , all the way to Mount Sion , [ f ] also known as Hermon ,
CEB	Deuteronomy	4	49	and all the desert regions across the Jordan River , on the east , down to the Dead Sea , beneath the slopes of Mount Pisgah . Footnotes - Deuteronomy 4:7 MT ; LXX , Syr , Tg a god so close - Deuteronomy 4:10 Heb lacks remember that . - Deuteronomy 4:13 Or the ten words - Deuteronomy 4:28 LXX ; MT lacks other . - Deuteronomy 4:29 Heb lacks him . - Deuteronomy 4:48 Syr Sirion ; see 3:9 .
CEB	Deuteronomy	5	5	At that time , I was standing between the Lord and you , declaring to you the Lord ’ s word , because you were terrified of the fire and didn ’ t go up on the mountain. ” The Lord said :
CEB	Deuteronomy	5	2	The Lord our God made a covenant with us at Mount Horeb .
CEB	Deuteronomy	5	3	The Lord didn ’ t make this covenant with our ancestors but with us—all of us who are here and alive right now .
CEB	Deuteronomy	5	4	The Lord spoke with you face-to-face on the mountain from the very fire itself .
CEB	Deuteronomy	5	6	I am the Lord your God , who brought you out of Egypt , out of the house of slavery .
CEB	Deuteronomy	5	7	You must have no other gods before [ a ] me .
CEB	Deuteronomy	5	8	Do not make an idol for yourself—no form whatsoever—of anything in the sky above or on the earth below or in the waters under the earth .
CEB	Deuteronomy	5	9	Do not bow down to them or worship them because I , the Lord your God , am a passionate God . I punish children for their parents ’ sins—even to the third and fourth generations of those who hate me .
CEB	Deuteronomy	5	10	But I am loyal and gracious to the thousandth generation [ b ] of those who love me and keep my commandments .
CEB	Deuteronomy	5	11	Do not use the Lord your God ’ s name as if it were of no significance ; the Lord won ’ t forgive anyone who uses his name that way .
CEB	Deuteronomy	5	12	Keep the Sabbath day and treat it as holy , exactly as the Lord your God commanded :
CEB	Deuteronomy	5	13	Six days you may work and do all your tasks ,
CEB	Deuteronomy	5	14	but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God . Don ’ t do any work on it—not you , your sons or daughters , your male or female servants , your oxen or donkeys or any of your animals , or the immigrant who is living among you—so that your male and female servants can rest just like you .
CEB	Deuteronomy	5	15	Remember that you were a slave in Egypt , but the Lord your God brought you out of there with a strong hand and an outstretched arm . That ’ s why the Lord your God commands you to keep the Sabbath day .
CEB	Deuteronomy	5	16	Honor your father and your mother , exactly as the Lord your God requires , so that your life will be long and so that things will go well for you on the fertile land that the Lord your God is giving you .
CEB	Deuteronomy	5	17	Do not kill . [ c ]
CEB	Deuteronomy	5	18	Do not commit adultery .
CEB	Deuteronomy	5	19	Do not steal .
CEB	Deuteronomy	5	20	Do not testify falsely against your neighbor .
CEB	Deuteronomy	5	21	Do not desire and try to take your neighbor ’ s wife . Do not crave your neighbor ’ s house , field , male or female servant , ox , donkey , or anything else that belongs to your neighbor .
CEB	Deuteronomy	5	22	Those are the words the Lord spoke to your entire assembly with a loud voice while on the mountain , from the midst of the fire , the cloud , and the thick smoke . He added no more . God wrote them on two stone tablets , then gave them to me . Moses ’ intercessory role
CEB	Deuteronomy	5	23	Now once you heard the voice from the darkness while the mountain was blazing with fire , you came to me—more specifically , all the chiefs of your tribes and your elders came—
CEB	Deuteronomy	5	24	and you said : “ Look here ! The Lord our God has shown us his glory and greatness . We ’ ve heard his voice come out of the very fire itself . We ’ ve seen firsthand that God can speak to a human being and they can survive !
CEB	Deuteronomy	5	25	But why should we die ? Surely this massive fire will consume us ! If we hear any more of the Lord our God ’ s voice , we will die .
CEB	Deuteronomy	5	26	Is there anyone who has heard the living God ’ s voice speaking out of the very fire itself , like we have , and survived ?
CEB	Deuteronomy	5	27	You go and listen to all that the Lord our God says . Then tell us all that the Lord our God speaks to you . We ’ ll listen and we ’ ll do it. ”
CEB	Deuteronomy	5	28	The Lord heard what you said , when you said this to me . The Lord then told me : I heard what the people said when they spoke with you . Everything they suggest is good .
CEB	Deuteronomy	5	29	If only their minds were like this : always fearing me and keeping all my commandments so that things would go well for them and their children forever !
CEB	Deuteronomy	5	30	Go and tell them : You may go back to your tents .
CEB	Deuteronomy	5	31	But you , Moses , must stay here with me . I will tell you all the commandments , [ d ] the regulations , and the case laws that you must teach the Israelites to do in the land that I am giving them to possess .
CEB	Deuteronomy	5	32	So you must carefully do exactly what the Lord your God commands you . Don ’ t deviate even a bit !
CEB	Deuteronomy	5	33	You must walk the precise path that the Lord your God indicates for you so that you will live , and so that things will go well for you , and so you will extend your time on the land that you will possess . Footnotes - Deuteronomy 5:7 Or besides - Deuteronomy 5:10 Or to thousands - Deuteronomy 5:17 Or murder - Deuteronomy 5:31 Heb is singular , commandment ( see 6:1 ) .
CEB	Deuteronomy	6	6	These words that I am commanding you today must always be on your minds .
CEB	Deuteronomy	6	2	so that you will fear the Lord your God by keeping all his regulations and his commandments that I am commanding you—both you and your sons and daughters—all the days of your life and so that you will lengthen your life .
CEB	Deuteronomy	6	3	Listen to them , Israel ! Follow them carefully so that things will go well for you and so that you will continue to multiply exactly as the Lord , your ancestors ’ God , promised you , in a land full of milk and honey .
CEB	Deuteronomy	6	4	Israel , listen ! Our God is the Lord ! Only the Lord ! [ a ]
CEB	Deuteronomy	6	5	Love the Lord your God with all your heart , all your being , and all your strength .
CEB	Deuteronomy	6	7	Recite them to your children . Talk about them when you are sitting around your house and when you are out and about , when you are lying down and when you are getting up .
CEB	Deuteronomy	6	8	Tie them on your hand as a sign . They should be on your forehead as a symbol . [ b ]
CEB	Deuteronomy	6	9	Write them on your house ’ s doorframes and on your city ’ s gates .
CEB	Deuteronomy	6	10	Now once the Lord your God has brought you into the land that he swore to your ancestors , to Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , to give to you—a land that will be full of large and wonderful towns that you didn ’ t build ,
CEB	Deuteronomy	6	11	houses stocked with all kinds of goods that you didn ’ t stock , cisterns that you didn ’ t make , vineyards and olive trees that you didn ’ t plant—and you eat and get stuffed ,
CEB	Deuteronomy	6	12	watch yourself ! Don ’ t forget the Lord , who brought you out of Egypt , out of the house of slavery .
CEB	Deuteronomy	6	13	Revere the Lord your God , serve him , and take your solemn pledges in his name !
CEB	Deuteronomy	6	14	Don ’ t follow other gods , those gods of the people around you—
CEB	Deuteronomy	6	15	because the Lord your God , who is with you and among you , is a passionate God . The Lord your God ’ s anger will burn against you , and he will wipe you off the fertile land .
CEB	Deuteronomy	6	16	Don ’ t test the Lord your God the way you frustrated him at Massah .
CEB	Deuteronomy	6	17	You must carefully follow the Lord your God ’ s commands along with the laws and regulations he has given you .
CEB	Deuteronomy	6	18	Do what is right and good in the Lord ’ s sight so that things will go well for you and so you will enter and take possession of the wonderful land that the Lord swore to your ancestors ,
CEB	Deuteronomy	6	19	and so the Lord will drive out all your enemies from before you , just as he promised . The next generation
CEB	Deuteronomy	6	20	In the future , your children will ask you , “ What is the meaning of the laws , [ c ] the regulations , and the case laws that the Lord our God commanded you ? ”
CEB	Deuteronomy	6	21	Tell them : We were Pharaoh ’ s slaves in Egypt . But the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand .
CEB	Deuteronomy	6	22	Before our own eyes , the Lord performed great and awesome deeds of power [ d ] against Egypt , Pharaoh , and his entire dynasty .
CEB	Deuteronomy	6	23	But the Lord brought us out from there so that he could bring us in , giving us the land that he swore to our ancestors .
CEB	Deuteronomy	6	24	Then the Lord commanded us to perform all these regulations , revering the Lord our God , so that things go well for us always and so we continue to live , as we ’ re doing right now .
CEB	Deuteronomy	6	25	What ’ s more , we will be considered righteous if we are careful to do all this commandment before the Lord our God , just as he commanded us .

CEB	Deuteronomy	7	7	It was not because you were greater than all other people that the Lord loved you and chose you . In fact , you were the smallest of peoples !
CEB	Deuteronomy	7	2	once the Lord your God lays them before you , you must strike them down , placing them under the ban . [ a ] Don ’ t make any covenants with them , and don ’ t be merciful to them .
CEB	Deuteronomy	7	3	Don ’ t intermarry with them . Don ’ t give your daughter to one of their sons to marry , and don ’ t take one of their daughters to marry your son ,
CEB	Deuteronomy	7	4	because they will turn your child away from following me so that they end up serving other gods . That will make the Lord ’ s anger burn against you , and he will quickly annihilate you .
CEB	Deuteronomy	7	5	Instead , this is what you must do with these nations : rip down their altars , smash their sacred stones , cut down their sacred poles , [ b ] and burn their idols
CEB	Deuteronomy	7	6	because you are a people holy to the Lord your God . The Lord your God chose you to be his own treasured people beyond all others on the fertile land .
CEB	Deuteronomy	7	8	No , it is because the Lord loved you and because he kept the solemn pledge he swore to your ancestors that the Lord brought you out with a strong hand and saved you from the house of slavery , from the power of Pharaoh , Egypt ’ s king .
CEB	Deuteronomy	7	9	Know now then that the Lord your God is the only true God ! He is the faithful God , who keeps the covenant and proves loyal to everyone who loves him and keeps his commands—even to the thousandth generation !
CEB	Deuteronomy	7	10	He is the God who personally repays anyone who hates him , ultimately destroying that kind of person . The Lord does not waste time with anyone who hates him ; he repays them personally .
CEB	Deuteronomy	7	11	So make sure you carefully keep the commandment , the regulations , and the case laws that I am commanding you right now .
CEB	Deuteronomy	7	12	If you listen to these case laws and follow them carefully , the Lord your God will keep the covenant and display the loyalty that he promised your ancestors .
CEB	Deuteronomy	7	13	He will love you , bless you , and multiply you . He will bless the fruit of your wombs and the fruit of your fertile land—all your grain , your wine , your oil , and the offspring of your cattle and flocks—upon the very fertile land that he swore to your ancestors to give to you .
CEB	Deuteronomy	7	14	You will be more blessed than any other group of people . No one will be sterile or infertile—not among you or your animals .
CEB	Deuteronomy	7	15	The Lord will remove all sickness from you . As for all those dreadful Egyptian diseases you experienced , the Lord won ’ t put them on you but will inflict them on all who hate you .
CEB	Deuteronomy	7	16	You will destroy all the peoples that the Lord your God is handing over to you . Show them no pity . And don ’ t serve their gods because that would be a trap for you . Against power and lack of trust
CEB	Deuteronomy	7	17	If you happen to think to yourself , These nations are greater than we are ; how can we possibly possess their land ?
CEB	Deuteronomy	7	18	don ’ t be afraid of them ! Remember , instead , what the Lord your God did to Pharaoh and all Egypt :
CEB	Deuteronomy	7	19	the great trials that you saw with your own eyes , the signs and wonders , and the strong hand and outstretched arm the Lord your God used to rescue you . That ’ s what the Lord your God will do to any people you fear .
CEB	Deuteronomy	7	20	The Lord your God will send terror [ c ] on them until even the survivors and those hiding from you are destroyed .
CEB	Deuteronomy	7	21	Don ’ t dread these nations because the Lord your God , the great and awesome God , is with you and among you . (
CEB	Deuteronomy	7	22	The Lord your God will drive out these nations before you bit by bit . You won ’ t be able to finish them off quickly ; otherwise , the wild animals would become too much for you to handle . )
CEB	Deuteronomy	7	23	The Lord your God will lay these nations before you , throwing them into a huge panic until they are destroyed .
CEB	Deuteronomy	7	24	He will hand their kings over to you , and you will wipe their names out from under the skies . No one will be able to stand before you ; you will crush them .
CEB	Deuteronomy	7	25	Burn the images of their gods . Don ’ t desire the silver or the gold that is on them and take it for yourself , or you will be trapped by it . That is detestable to the Lord your God .
CEB	Deuteronomy	7	26	Don ’ t bring any detestable thing into your house , or you will be placed under the ban too , just like it is ! You must utterly detest these kinds of things , despising them completely , because they are under the ban .

CEB	Deuteronomy	8	8	a land of wheat and barley , vines , fig trees , and pomegranates ; a land of olive oil and honey ;
CEB	Deuteronomy	8	2	Remember the long road on which the Lord your God led you during these forty years in the desert so he could humble you , testing you to find out what was in your heart : whether you would keep his commandments or not .
CEB	Deuteronomy	8	3	He humbled you by making you hungry and then feeding you the manna that neither you nor your ancestors had ever experienced , so he could teach you that people don ’ t live on bread alone . No , they live based on whatever the Lord says . [ a ]
CEB	Deuteronomy	8	4	During these forty years , your clothes didn ’ t wear out and your feet didn ’ t swell up .
CEB	Deuteronomy	8	5	Know then in your heart that the Lord your God has been disciplining you just as a father disciplines his children .
CEB	Deuteronomy	8	6	Keep the commandments of the Lord your God by walking in his ways and by fearing him ,
CEB	Deuteronomy	8	7	because the Lord your God is bringing you to a wonderful land , a land with streams of water , springs , and wells that gush up in the valleys and on the hills ;
CEB	Deuteronomy	8	9	a land where you will eat food without any shortage—you won ’ t lack a thing there—a land where stone is hard as iron and where you will mine copper from the hills .
CEB	Deuteronomy	8	10	You will eat , you will be satisfied , and you will bless the Lord your God in the wonderful land that he ’ s given you . Against wealth and overconfidence
CEB	Deuteronomy	8	11	But watch yourself ! Don ’ t forget the Lord your God by not keeping his commands or his case laws or his regulations that I am commanding you right now .
CEB	Deuteronomy	8	12	When you eat , get full , build nice houses , and settle down ,
CEB	Deuteronomy	8	13	and when your herds and your flocks are growing large , your silver and gold are multiplying , and everything you have is thriving ,
CEB	Deuteronomy	8	14	don ’ t become arrogant , forgetting the Lord your God : the one who rescued you from Egypt , from the house of slavery ;
CEB	Deuteronomy	8	15	the one who led you through this vast and terrifying desert of poisonous snakes and scorpions , of cracked ground with no water ; the one who made water flow for you out of a hard rock ;
CEB	Deuteronomy	8	16	the one who fed you manna in the wilderness , which your ancestors had never experienced , in order to humble and test you , but in order to do good to you in the end .
CEB	Deuteronomy	8	17	Don ’ t think to yourself , My own strength and abilities have produced all this prosperity for me .
CEB	Deuteronomy	8	18	Remember the Lord your God ! He ’ s the one who gives you the strength to be prosperous in order to establish the covenant he made with your ancestors—and that ’ s how things stand right now .
CEB	Deuteronomy	8	19	But if you do , in fact , forget the Lord your God and follow other gods , serving and bowing down to them , I swear to you right now that you will be completely destroyed .
CEB	Deuteronomy	8	20	Just like the nations that the Lord is destroying before you , that ’ s exactly how you will be destroyed—all because you didn ’ t obey the Lord your God ’ s voice . Footnotes - Deuteronomy 8:3 Or whatever comes out of the Lord ’ s mouth
CEB	Deuteronomy	9	9	When I went up on the mountain to get the stone tablets , the covenant tablets that the Lord made with you , I was up there forty days and forty nights . I ate no bread , drank no water .

CEB	Deuteronomy	9	3	Know right now that the Lord your God , who is crossing over before you , is an all-consuming fire ! He will wipe them out ! He will subdue them before you ! Then you will take possession of their land , eliminating them quickly , exactly as the Lord told you .
CEB	Deuteronomy	9	4	Once the Lord your God has driven them out before you , don ’ t think to yourself , It ’ s because I ’ m righteous that the Lord brought me in to possess this land . It is instead because of these nations ’ wickedness that the Lord is removing them before you .
CEB	Deuteronomy	9	5	You aren ’ t entering and taking possession of their land because you are righteous or because your heart is especially virtuous ; rather , it is because these nations are wicked—that ’ s why the Lord your God is removing them before you , and because he wishes to establish the promise he made to your ancestors : to Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob . Gold calf
CEB	Deuteronomy	9	6	Know then that the Lord your God isn ’ t giving you this excellent land for you to possess on account of your righteousness—because you are a stubborn people !
CEB	Deuteronomy	9	7	Remember—don ’ t ever forget ! —how you made the Lord your God furious in the wilderness . From the very first day you stepped out of Egypt until you arrived at this place , you have been rebels against the Lord .
CEB	Deuteronomy	9	8	Even at Horeb you angered the Lord ! He was so enraged by you that he threatened to wipe you out .
CEB	Deuteronomy	9	10	The Lord gave me the two stone tablets , written by God ’ s finger , and on them were all the words that the Lord had said to you on the mountain , out of the very fire itself , on the day we assembled .
CEB	Deuteronomy	9	11	At the end of those forty days and nights , the Lord gave me the two stone tablets—the covenant tablets .
CEB	Deuteronomy	9	12	Then the Lord said to me , “ Get going ! Get down from here quickly because your people , whom you brought out of Egypt , have ruined everything ! They couldn ’ t wait to turn from the path I commanded them ! They ’ ve made themselves an idol out of cast metal. ”
CEB	Deuteronomy	9	13	The Lord said more to me : “ I have seen this people . Look ! What a stubborn people they are !
CEB	Deuteronomy	9	14	Now stand back . I am going to wipe them out . I will erase their name from under heaven , then I will make a nation out of you—one stronger and larger than they were. ”
CEB	Deuteronomy	9	15	So I went down the mountain while it was blazing with fire . The two covenant tablets were in my two hands .
CEB	Deuteronomy	9	16	It was then that I saw how you sinned against the Lord your God : you made yourselves a calf , an idol made of cast metal ! You couldn ’ t wait to turn from the path the Lord commanded you !
CEB	Deuteronomy	9	17	I grabbed the two tablets and threw them down with my own hands , shattering them while you watched .
CEB	Deuteronomy	9	18	Then I fell before the Lord as I had done the previous forty days and forty nights . I ate no bread and drank no water , all because of the sin that you had committed by doing such evil in the Lord ’ s sight , infuriating him .
CEB	Deuteronomy	9	19	I was afraid of the massive anger and rage the Lord had for you—he was going to wipe you out ! However , the Lord listened to me again in that moment .
CEB	Deuteronomy	9	20	But the Lord was furious with Aaron—he was going to wipe him out ! So I also prayed hard for Aaron at that time .
CEB	Deuteronomy	9	21	And as for that sinful thing you made , that calf , I took it and I burned it with fire . Then I smashed it , grinding it thoroughly until it was as fine as dust . Then I dumped the dust into the stream that ran down the mountain .
CEB	Deuteronomy	9	22	Also at Taberah , again at Massah , and then again at Kibroth-hattaavah , you have been the kind of people who make the Lord angry .
CEB	Deuteronomy	9	23	And then , when the Lord sent you from Kadesh-barnea , telling you : “ Go up and take possession of the land that I ’ m giving you , ” you disobeyed the Lord your God ’ s command . You didn ’ t trust him . You didn ’ t obey God ’ s voice .
CEB	Deuteronomy	9	24	You ’ ve been rebellious toward the Lord from the day I [ a ] met you . Moses ’ intercessory prayer
CEB	Deuteronomy	9	25	But I fell on my knees in the Lord ’ s presence forty days and forty nights , lying flat out , because the Lord planned on wiping you out .
CEB	Deuteronomy	9	26	But I prayed to the Lord ! I said : Lord , my Lord ! Don ’ t destroy your people , your own possession , whom you saved by your own power , whom you brought out of Egypt with a strong hand !
CEB	Deuteronomy	9	27	Remember your servants : Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob ! Don ’ t focus on this people ’ s stubbornness , wickedness , and sin .
CEB	Deuteronomy	9	28	Otherwise , that land out of which you brought us will say : The Lord wasn ’ t strong enough to bring them into the land he ’ d promised them . Because he didn ’ t care for them in the least , he brought them out to die in the desert .
CEB	Deuteronomy	9	29	But these are your people ! Your own possession ! The people you brought out by your great power and by your outstretched arm ! Footnotes - Deuteronomy 9:24 LXX , Sam he ( God ) met you
CEB	Deuteronomy	10	10	Just as the first time , I remained on the mountain forty days and nights . And the Lord listened to me again in this instance . The Lord wasn ’ t willing to destroy you .
CEB	Deuteronomy	10	2	I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets—the ones you smashed—then you will place them in the chest .
CEB	Deuteronomy	10	3	So I built a chest out of acacia wood and carved two stone tablets just like the first ones . Then I hiked up the mountain holding the two tablets in my hands .
CEB	Deuteronomy	10	4	God wrote on the new tablets what had been written on the first set : the Ten Commandments that the Lord spoke to you on the mountain , from the very fire itself , on the day we assembled there . Then the Lord gave them to me .
CEB	Deuteronomy	10	5	So I came back down the mountain . I put the tablets in the chest that I ’ d made , and that ’ s where they are now , exactly as the Lord commanded me . (
CEB	Deuteronomy	10	6	Now , the Israelites had set out from Beeroth-bene-jaakan [ a ] to Moserah . It was there that Aaron died and was buried . His son Eleazar succeeded him in the priestly role .
CEB	Deuteronomy	10	7	From there the Israelites traveled to Gudgodah , then from Gudgodah to Jotbathah , which is a land with flowing streams .
CEB	Deuteronomy	10	8	At that time , the Lord selected the tribe of Levi to carry the chest containing the Lord ’ s covenant , to minister before the Lord , to serve him , and to offer blessings in his name . That ’ s the way things are right now .
CEB	Deuteronomy	10	9	That ’ s why the Levites don ’ t have a stake or inheritance with the rest of their relatives . The Lord is the Levites ’ inheritance , just as the Lord your God promised them . )
CEB	Deuteronomy	10	11	Then the Lord told me : Get going . Lead the people so they can enter and take possession of the land that I promised I ’ d give to their ancestors . What the Lord requires
CEB	Deuteronomy	10	12	Now in light of all that , Israel , what does the Lord your God ask of you ? Only this : to revere the Lord your God by walking in all his ways , by loving him , by serving the Lord your God with all your heart and being ,
CEB	Deuteronomy	10	13	and by keeping the Lord ’ s commandments and his regulations that I ’ m commanding you right now . It ’ s for your own good !
CEB	Deuteronomy	10	14	Clearly , the Lord owns the sky , the highest heavens , the earth , and everything in it .
CEB	Deuteronomy	10	15	But the Lord adored your ancestors , loving them and choosing the descendants that followed them—you ! —from all other people . That ’ s how things still stand now .
CEB	Deuteronomy	10	16	So circumcise your hearts [ b ] and stop being so stubborn ,
CEB	Deuteronomy	10	17	because the Lord your God is the God of all gods and Lord of all lords , the great , mighty , and awesome God who doesn ’ t play favorites and doesn ’ t take bribes .
CEB	Deuteronomy	10	18	He enacts justice for orphans and widows , and he loves immigrants , giving them food and clothing .
CEB	Deuteronomy	10	19	That means you must also love immigrants because you were immigrants in Egypt .
CEB	Deuteronomy	10	20	Revere the Lord your God , serve him , cling to him , swear by his name alone !
CEB	Deuteronomy	10	21	He is your praise , and he is your God—the one who performed these great and awesome acts that you witnessed with your very own eyes .
CEB	Deuteronomy	10	22	Your ancestors went down to Egypt with a total of seventy people , but now look ! The Lord your God has made you as numerous as the stars in the nighttime sky ! Footnotes - Deuteronomy 10:6 Or from the wells of the Jaakanites - Deuteronomy 10:16 Or the foreskin of your hearts ; cf 30:6
CEB	Deuteronomy	11	11	No , the land you are entering to possess is a land of hills and valleys , where your drinking water will be rain from heaven .
CEB	Deuteronomy	11	2	And know right now what your children haven ’ t known or yet witnessed : [ a ] The Lord your God ’ s discipline , his power , his mighty hand and outstretched arm ;
CEB	Deuteronomy	11	3	the signs and the acts that he performed in the heart of Egyptian territory , against Egypt ’ s King Pharaoh and all his land ;
CEB	Deuteronomy	11	4	what God did to the Egyptian army , to its horses and chariots—how he made the water of the Reed Sea [ b ] flow over their heads when they chased after you , but the Lord destroyed them , and that ’ s how things stand right now ;
CEB	Deuteronomy	11	5	what the Lord did for you in the desert , until you arrived at this place ;
CEB	Deuteronomy	11	6	and what he did to Dathan and Abiram , the descendants of Eliab the Reubenite , when the ground opened up its mouth and swallowed them , their families , their tents , and every living thing they possessed in the presence of all Israel .
CEB	Deuteronomy	11	7	Your own eyes witnessed each of these powerful acts the Lord performed .
CEB	Deuteronomy	11	8	So keep every part of the commandment that I am giving you today so that you stay strong to enter and take possession of the land that you are crossing over to possess ,
CEB	Deuteronomy	11	9	and so that you might prolong your life on the fertile land that the Lord swore to your ancestors to give to them and their descendants—a land full of milk and honey .
CEB	Deuteronomy	11	10	The land you are about to enter and possess is definitely not like the land of Egypt , where you came from , where you sowed your seed and irrigated it by hand [ c ] like a vegetable garden .
CEB	Deuteronomy	11	12	It ’ s a land that the Lord cares for : the Lord ’ s eyes are on it constantly from the first of the year until the very end of the year .
CEB	Deuteronomy	11	13	Now , if you completely obey God ’ s [ d ] commandments that I am giving you right now , by loving the Lord your God and by serving him with all your heart and all your being ,
CEB	Deuteronomy	11	14	then he [ e ] will provide rain for your land at the right time—early rain and late rain—so you can stock up your grain , wine , and oil .
CEB	Deuteronomy	11	15	He [ f ] will also make your fields lush for your livestock , and you will eat and be satisfied .
CEB	Deuteronomy	11	16	But watch yourselves ! Otherwise , your heart might be led astray so you stray away , serving other gods and worshipping them .
CEB	Deuteronomy	11	17	Then the Lord ’ s anger would burn against you . He will close the sky up tight . There won ’ t be any rain , and the ground won ’ t yield any of its crops . You will quickly disappear off the wonderful land the Lord is giving to you .
CEB	Deuteronomy	11	18	Place these words I ’ m speaking on your heart and in your very being . Tie them on your hand as a sign . They should be on your forehead as a symbol . [ g ]
CEB	Deuteronomy	11	19	Teach them to your children , by talking about them when you are sitting around your house and when you are out and about , when you are lying down and when you are getting up .
CEB	Deuteronomy	11	20	Write them on your house ’ s doorframes and on your city ’ s gates .
CEB	Deuteronomy	11	21	Do all that so your days and your children ’ s days on the fertile land the Lord swore to give to your ancestors are many—indeed , as many as the number of days that the sky ’ s been over the earth !
CEB	Deuteronomy	11	22	It ’ s true : if you carefully keep all this commandment that I ’ m giving you , by doing it , by loving the Lord your God , by walking in all his ways , and by clinging to him ,
CEB	Deuteronomy	11	23	then the Lord will clear out all these nations before you . You will inherit what belonged to nations that are larger and stronger than you are .
CEB	Deuteronomy	11	24	Every place you set foot on will be yours : your territory will run from the wilderness all the way to the Lebanon range , and from the Euphrates River all the way to the Mediterranean Sea .
CEB	Deuteronomy	11	25	No one will be able to stand up to you . Just as he promised , the Lord your God will make the entire land deathly afraid of you wherever you advance in it . Ceremony on Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal
CEB	Deuteronomy	11	26	Pay attention ! I am setting blessing and curse before you right now :
CEB	Deuteronomy	11	27	the blessing if you obey the Lord your God ’ s commandments that I am giving you right now ,
CEB	Deuteronomy	11	28	but the curse if you don ’ t obey the Lord your God ’ s commandments and stray from the path that I am giving you today by following other gods that you have not known .
CEB	Deuteronomy	11	29	Now when the Lord your God brings you into the land that you are entering to take possession of , put the blessing on Mount Gerizim and the curse on Mount Ebal . (
CEB	Deuteronomy	11	30	Aren ’ t both of these mountains across the Jordan River , down along the western road in the region of the Canaanites who live in the desert plain , across from Gilgal , next to the Moreh Oak Grove ? )
CEB	Deuteronomy	11	31	So then , once you cross the Jordan River to enter and possess the land that the Lord your God is giving you , and you take possession of it , settling down in it ,
CEB	Deuteronomy	11	32	you must carefully follow the regulations and the case laws that I am laying out before you right now .

CEB	Deuteronomy	12	12	Then you will rejoice in the Lord your God ’ s presence : each of you , your sons and daughters , your male and female servants , and the Levites who dwell in your cities because they have no designated inheritance .
CEB	Deuteronomy	12	2	You must completely destroy every place where the nations that you are displacing worshipped their gods—whether on high mountains or hills or under leafy green trees .
CEB	Deuteronomy	12	3	Rip down their altars and shatter their sacred stones . Burn their sacred poles [ a ] with fire . Hack their gods ’ idols into pieces . Wipe out their names from that place .
CEB	Deuteronomy	12	4	Don ’ t act like they did toward the Lord your God !
CEB	Deuteronomy	12	5	Instead , you must search for the location the Lord your God will select from all your tribes to put his name there , as his residence , and you must go there .
CEB	Deuteronomy	12	6	You must bring your entirely burned offerings , your sacrifices , your tenth-part gifts , your contributions , [ b ] your payments for solemn promises , your spontaneous gifts , and the oldest offspring of your herds and flocks to that place .
CEB	Deuteronomy	12	7	You will have a feast there , each of you and your families , in the Lord your God ’ s presence , and you will celebrate all you have done because the Lord your God has blessed you .
CEB	Deuteronomy	12	8	Don ’ t act like we ’ ve been acting here lately—everyone doing what seems right to them—
CEB	Deuteronomy	12	9	because up to this point you haven ’ t yet reached the place of rest or the inheritance the Lord your God is giving you .
CEB	Deuteronomy	12	10	But you are about to cross the Jordan River and will settle in the land the Lord your God is giving you as your inheritance . Then he will give you rest from all your enemies on every side so that you live safely and securely .
CEB	Deuteronomy	12	11	At that point , you must bring all that I am commanding you , your entirely burned offerings , your sacrifices , your tenth-part gifts , your contributions , and all your best payments that you solemnly promised to the Lord , to the location the Lord your God selects for his name to reside .
CEB	Deuteronomy	12	13	But watch yourself ! Make sure you don ’ t offer up your entirely burned offerings in just any place you see .
CEB	Deuteronomy	12	14	No , only at the location the Lord selects from one of your tribal areas—that ’ s where you must offer up your entirely burned offerings and that ’ s where you must perform everything I ’ m telling you .
CEB	Deuteronomy	12	15	However , whenever you wish , you may slaughter and eat meat , as the Lord your God sees fit to bless you with such in your cities . People who are polluted and people who are purified can join in the feast , as they would if they were eating gazelle or deer .
CEB	Deuteronomy	12	16	But you must not consume any of the animals ’ blood . Pour it out on the ground , just like water .
CEB	Deuteronomy	12	17	- Deuteronomy 12:32 13:1 in Heb
CEB	Deuteronomy	12	18	Only in the presence of the Lord your God , at the location the Lord your God selects , can you eat these things—that holds true for you , your son and daughter , your male and female servant , and the Levite who lives in your city . Then celebrate all you have done in the Lord your God ’ s presence .
CEB	Deuteronomy	12	19	But watch yourself : as long as you are on the land , don ’ t forget about the Levites .
CEB	Deuteronomy	12	20	Once the Lord your God has enlarged your territory , as he promised you , and you think to yourself , I ’ d like to eat some meat ( because you have the desire to do so ) , feel free to do so whenever you want .
CEB	Deuteronomy	12	21	But if the location that the Lord your God will choose to put his name is far away from where you live , then slaughter an animal from your herd or flock that the Lord has given you , just as I have commanded you , and eat it in your cities whenever you wish .
CEB	Deuteronomy	12	22	But be sure to eat it as if it were gazelle or deer . People who are polluted and people who are purified can feast on it together .
CEB	Deuteronomy	12	23	Furthermore , make sure that you don ’ t consume any of the blood , because blood is life . You must not consume the life along with the meat .
CEB	Deuteronomy	12	24	You must not consume any of it . Pour it out on the ground , just like water .
CEB	Deuteronomy	12	25	You must not consume any of it so that things go well for you and for your children later because you did what was right in the Lord ’ s eyes .
CEB	Deuteronomy	12	26	Note that you must bring your sacred offerings and your payments for solemn promises to the location the Lord selects ,
CEB	Deuteronomy	12	27	offering up your entirely burned sacrifices—both meat and blood—on the Lord your God ’ s altar . The blood from your sacrifices must be poured out on the Lord your God ’ s altar , but you are allowed to eat the meat .
CEB	Deuteronomy	12	28	Observe and obey all these words that I am commanding you so that things always go well for you and your children later because you did what was good and right in the Lord your God ’ s eyes .
CEB	Deuteronomy	12	29	Once the Lord your God has removed from before you all the nations that you are entering and taking possession of , and you have displaced them and are living in their land ,
CEB	Deuteronomy	12	30	then watch yourself ! Don ’ t be trapped by following their practices after they ’ ve been wiped out before you . Don ’ t go investigating their gods , thinking , How did these nations worship their gods ? I want to do the very same thing !
CEB	Deuteronomy	12	31	Don ’ t act like they did toward the Lord your God because they did things for their gods that are detestable to the Lord , which he hates . They even burned their own sons and daughters with fire for their gods !
CEB	Deuteronomy	12	32	[ c ] Everything I ’ m commanding you , you must do it with utmost care ! Don ’ t add anything to it or take anything away from it .

CEB	Deuteronomy	13	3	you must not listen to that prophet ’ s or dream interpreter ’ s words , because the Lord your God is testing you to see if you love the Lord your God with all your mind and all your being .
CEB	Deuteronomy	13	4	You must follow the Lord your God alone ! Revere him ! Follow his commandments ! Obey his voice ! Worship him ! Cling to him—no other !
CEB	Deuteronomy	13	5	That prophet or dream interpreter must be executed because he encouraged you to turn away from the Lord your God who brought you out of Egypt , who redeemed you from the house of slavery ; they tried to lead you away from the path the Lord your God commanded you to take . Remove [ b ] such evil from your community !
CEB	Deuteronomy	13	6	Similarly , if one of your relatives—even one of your own siblings—or your own son or daughter or your dear spouse or best friend entices you secretly , if someone like that says : “ Come on ! We should follow and worship other gods ” —ones that neither you nor your ancestors have experienced ,

CEB	Deuteronomy	13	8	don ’ t give in to them ! Don ’ t obey them ! Don ’ t have any mercy on them ! Don ’ t have compassion on them and don ’ t protect them !
CEB	Deuteronomy	13	9	Instead , you must execute them . Your own hand must be against them from the beginning of the execution ; the hand of all the people will be involved at the end .
CEB	Deuteronomy	13	10	Stone them until they are dead because they desired to lead you away from the Lord your God , the one who brought you out of Egypt , out of the house of slavery .
CEB	Deuteronomy	13	11	All Israel will hear about this and be afraid . They won ’ t do that sort of evil thing among you again .
CEB	Deuteronomy	13	12	Or if you hear about one of your towns the Lord your God is giving you to inhabit , that

CEB	Deuteronomy	13	15	you must completely strike down the inhabitants of that city with the sword . Place it and all that is in it under the ban . [ c ] Put its animals to the sword .
CEB	Deuteronomy	13	16	Gather all the plunder into the middle of the town ’ s square . Then burn the city and all of its plunder as an entirely burned offering to the Lord your God . It must remain a heap of rubble forever . It must not be rebuilt .
CEB	Deuteronomy	13	17	Don ’ t hold on to any of the banned items—this will ensure that the Lord turns from his great anger and is compassionate to you , showing you mercy and multiplying you just like he swore to your ancestors .
CEB	Deuteronomy	13	18	You must definitely obey the Lord your God ’ s voice , keeping all his commandments that I am giving you right now , by doing what is right in the Lord your God ’ s eyes !

CEB	Deuteronomy	14	4	Here ’ s a list of animals you are allowed to eat : ox , sheep , goat ,
CEB	Deuteronomy	14	5	deer , gazelle , roebuck , wild goat , ibex , antelope , and mountain sheep .
CEB	Deuteronomy	14	6	You are also allowed to eat any animal with a divided hoof—the hoof being divided into two parts—and that rechews food among the various kinds of animals .
CEB	Deuteronomy	14	7	However , here ’ s a list of animals that either rechew food or have hooves divided in two parts that you are not allowed to eat : the camel , the hare , and the rock badger—because these rechew food but don ’ t have divided hoofs , they are off-limits for you ;
CEB	Deuteronomy	14	8	and the pig—because it has a divided hoof but doesn ’ t rechew food , it ’ s off-limits for you . You may not eat these animals ’ meat , and you must not touch their carcasses .
CEB	Deuteronomy	14	9	Here ’ s a list of the water animals you are allowed to eat : you can eat anything that has fins and scales .
CEB	Deuteronomy	14	10	But you aren ’ t allowed to eat anything that lacks scales or fins . These are off-limits for you .

CEB	Deuteronomy	14	20	Any clean winged creature can be eaten , however .
CEB	Deuteronomy	14	21	You must not eat any decayed animal flesh because you are a people holy to the Lord your God . You can give decayed animal flesh to the immigrants who live in your cities , and they can eat it ; or you can sell it to foreigners . Don ’ t cook a lamb in its own mother ’ s milk . Tenth part
CEB	Deuteronomy	14	22	You must reserve a tenth part of whatever your fields produce each year .
CEB	Deuteronomy	14	23	Eat the tenth part of your grain , wine , oil , oldest offspring of your herds and flocks in the presence of the Lord your God in the location he selects for his name to reside so that you learn to fear the Lord your God at all times .
CEB	Deuteronomy	14	24	But if the trip is too long , because the location the Lord your God has selected to put his name is far away from where you live so that you can ’ t transport the tenth part—because the Lord your God will certainly bless you—
CEB	Deuteronomy	14	25	then you can convert it to money . Take the money with you and go to the location the Lord your God selects .
CEB	Deuteronomy	14	26	Then you can use the money for anything you want : cattle , sheep , wine , beer , or whatever else you might like . Then you should feast there and celebrate in the presence of the Lord your God , along with your entire household .
CEB	Deuteronomy	14	27	Only make sure not to neglect the Levites who are living in your cities because they don ’ t have a designated inheritance like you do .
CEB	Deuteronomy	14	28	Every third year you must bring the tenth part of your produce from that year and leave it at your city gates .
CEB	Deuteronomy	14	29	Then the Levites , who have no designated inheritance like you do , along with the immigrants , orphans , and widows who live in your cities , will come and feast until they are full . Do this so that the Lord your God might bless you in everything you do . Footnotes - Deuteronomy 14:18 The species of many of the birds in 14:12-18 is uncertain .

CEB	Deuteronomy	15	3	You are allowed to demand payment from foreigners , but whatever is owed you from your fellow Israelites you must forgive .
CEB	Deuteronomy	15	4	Of course there won ’ t be any poor persons among you because the Lord will bless you in the land that the Lord your God is giving you to possess as an inheritance ,
CEB	Deuteronomy	15	5	but only if you carefully obey the Lord your God ’ s voice , by carefully doing every bit of this commandment that I ’ m giving you right now .

CEB	Deuteronomy	15	7	Now if there are some poor persons among you , say one of your fellow Israelites in one of your cities in the land that the Lord your God is giving you , don ’ t be hard-hearted or tightfisted toward your poor fellow Israelites .
CEB	Deuteronomy	15	8	To the contrary ! Open your hand wide to them . You must generously lend them whatever they need .
CEB	Deuteronomy	15	9	But watch yourself ! Make sure no wicked thought crosses your mind , such as , The seventh year is coming—the year of debt cancellation—so that you resent your poor fellow Israelites and don ’ t give them anything . If you do that , they will cry out to the Lord against you , and you will be guilty of sin .
CEB	Deuteronomy	15	10	No , give generously to needy persons . Don ’ t resent giving to them because it is this very thing that will lead to the Lord your God ’ s blessing you in all you do and work at .
CEB	Deuteronomy	15	11	Poor persons will never disappear from the earth . That ’ s why I ’ m giving you this command : you must open your hand generously to your fellow Israelites , to the needy among you , and to the poor who live with you in your land .
CEB	Deuteronomy	15	12	If any of your fellow Hebrews , male or female , sell themselves into your service , they can work for you for six years , but in the seventh year you must set them free from your service .
CEB	Deuteronomy	15	13	Furthermore , when you set them free from your service , you must not let them go empty-handed .
CEB	Deuteronomy	15	14	Instead , provide for them fully from your flock , food , and wine . You must give to them from that with which the Lord your God has blessed you .
CEB	Deuteronomy	15	16	Now if your male servant says to you : “ I don ’ t want to leave your service ” because he loves you and your family and because life is good for him in your service ,
CEB	Deuteronomy	15	17	then you may take a needle and pierce his ear with it into the doorframe . From that point on , he will be your permanent servant . Do the same thing for female servants . )
CEB	Deuteronomy	15	18	Don ’ t consider it a hardship to set these servants free from your service , because they worked for you for six years—at a value double that of a paid worker . The Lord your God will bless you in everything that you do .
CEB	Deuteronomy	15	19	You must devote every oldest male animal from your herds or flocks to the Lord your God . Don ’ t plow with your oldest male ox and don ’ t shear your oldest male sheep .
CEB	Deuteronomy	15	20	Year after year , you and your family are allowed to eat these animals in the presence of the Lord your God , in the location the Lord selects .
CEB	Deuteronomy	15	21	But if there is any defect in it , lameness , blindness , any flaw whatsoever , you must not sacrifice it to the Lord your God .
CEB	Deuteronomy	15	22	You are allowed to eat those in your own cities , whether you are polluted or purified , just as you would eat gazelle or deer .
CEB	Deuteronomy	15	23	Even so , don ’ t consume any blood . Pour it out on the ground , like water .
CEB	Deuteronomy	16	16	Three times a year every male among you must appear before the presence of the Lord your God in the location he will select : at the Festival of Unleavened Bread , the Festival of Weeks , and the Festival of Booths . They must not appear before the Lord ’ s presence empty-handed .
CEB	Deuteronomy	16	2	Offer a Passover sacrifice from the flock or herd to the Lord your God at the location the Lord selects for his name to reside .
CEB	Deuteronomy	16	3	You must not eat anything containing yeast along with it . [ b ] Instead , for seven days you must eat unleavened bread , bread symbolizing misery , along with it because you fled Egypt in a great hurry . Do this so you remember the day you fled Egypt for as long as you live .
CEB	Deuteronomy	16	4	No dough with yeast should appear in any of your territory for seven days . Furthermore , none of the meat that you sacrificed on the first night should remain until morning .
CEB	Deuteronomy	16	5	You are not permitted to offer the Passover sacrifice in any of the cities that the Lord your God is giving you .
CEB	Deuteronomy	16	6	Instead , you must offer the Passover sacrifice at the location the Lord your God selects for his name to reside , at evening time , when the sun sets , which was the time you fled Egypt .
CEB	Deuteronomy	16	7	Cook it and eat it in the location that the Lord your God selects . The next morning you can return to your tents .
CEB	Deuteronomy	16	8	For six days you will eat unleavened bread . The seventh day will be a celebration for the Lord your God . Don ’ t do any work . Festival of Weeks
CEB	Deuteronomy	16	9	Count out seven weeks , starting the count from the beginning of the grain harvest .
CEB	Deuteronomy	16	10	At that point , perform the Festival of Weeks for the Lord your God . Offer a spontaneous gift in precise measure with the blessing the Lord your God gives you .
CEB	Deuteronomy	16	11	Then celebrate in the presence of the Lord your God—you , your sons , your daughters , your male and female servants , the Levites who live in your cities , the immigrants , the orphans , and the widows who are among you—in the location the Lord your God selects for his name to reside .
CEB	Deuteronomy	16	12	Remember how each of you was a slave in Egypt , so follow these regulations most carefully . Festival of Booths
CEB	Deuteronomy	16	13	Once you have collected the food and drink you need , perform the Festival of Booths for seven days .
CEB	Deuteronomy	16	14	Celebrate your festival : you , your sons , your daughters , your male and female servants , the Levites , the immigrants , the orphans , and the widows who live in your cities .
CEB	Deuteronomy	16	15	Seven days you must perform the festival for the Lord your God in the location the Lord selects because the Lord your God will bless you in all you do and in all your work . You will be overjoyed .
CEB	Deuteronomy	16	17	Each one should have his gift in hand , in precise measure with the blessing the Lord your God gives you . Judges and officials
CEB	Deuteronomy	16	18	Appoint judges and officials for each of your tribes in every city that the Lord your God gives you . They must judge the people fairly .
CEB	Deuteronomy	16	19	Don ’ t delay justice ; don ’ t show favoritism . Don ’ t take bribes because bribery blinds the vision of the wise and twists the words of the righteous .
CEB	Deuteronomy	16	20	Righteousness ! Pursue righteousness so that you live long and take possession of the land that the Lord your God is giving you . Rules for worship
CEB	Deuteronomy	16	21	Don ’ t plant any tree to serve as a sacred pole [ c ] next to the altar you make for the Lord your God .
CEB	Deuteronomy	16	22	Don ’ t set up any sacred stone either , because the Lord your God hates such things .

CEB	Deuteronomy	17	17	The king must not take numerous wives so that his heart doesn ’ t go astray . Nor can the king acquire too much silver and gold .
CEB	Deuteronomy	17	2	If someone , whether male or female , is found in your community—in one of the cities the Lord your God is giving you—who does evil in the Lord your God ’ s eyes , by breaking God ’ s covenant ,
CEB	Deuteronomy	17	3	by following and serving other gods , and by bowing down to them , to the sun or the moon or any of the heavenly bodies that I haven ’ t permitted—
CEB	Deuteronomy	17	4	and you hear news about it , then you must look into this situation very carefully . And if it ’ s definitely true that this detestable thing was done in Israel ,
CEB	Deuteronomy	17	5	then you must bring out the man or woman who has done this evil thing to the gates of the city . Stone that person until he or she is dead .
CEB	Deuteronomy	17	6	Capital punishment must be decided by two or three witnesses . No one may be executed on the basis of only one testimony .
CEB	Deuteronomy	17	7	In the execution , the hands of the witnesses must be against the guilty person from the start ; the hand of all the people will be involved at the end . Remove [ a ] such evil from your community ! Legal disputes
CEB	Deuteronomy	17	8	If some legal dispute in your cities is too difficult for you to decide—say , between different kinds of bloodshed , different kinds of legal ruling , or different kinds of injury—then take it to the location the Lord your God selects .
CEB	Deuteronomy	17	9	Go to the levitical priests and to the head judge in office at that time and look into things there . They will announce to you the correct ruling .
CEB	Deuteronomy	17	10	You must then act according to the ruling they announced to you from that location , the one the Lord selects . You must follow very carefully everything they instruct you to do .
CEB	Deuteronomy	17	11	Act precisely according to the instruction they give you and the ruling they announce to you . Don ’ t deviate even a bit from the word they announce .
CEB	Deuteronomy	17	12	And whoever acts rashly by not listening to the priest who is in office serving the Lord your God or to the head judge will die . Remove [ b ] such evil from Israel !
CEB	Deuteronomy	17	13	All the people will hear about this and be afraid . They won ’ t act arrogantly anymore . Law of the king
CEB	Deuteronomy	17	14	Once you have entered the land the Lord your God is giving you and you have taken possession of it and settled down in it , you might say : “ Let ’ s appoint a king over us , as all our neighboring nations have done. ”
CEB	Deuteronomy	17	15	You can indeed appoint over you a king that the Lord your God selects . You can appoint over you a king who is one of your fellow Israelites . You are not allowed to appoint over you a foreigner who is not one of your fellow Israelites .
CEB	Deuteronomy	17	16	That granted , the king must not acquire too many horses , and he must not return the people to Egypt in order to acquire more horses , because the Lord told you : “ You will never go back by that road again. ”
CEB	Deuteronomy	17	18	Instead , when he sits on his royal throne , he himself must write a copy of this Instruction on a scroll in the presence of the levitical priests .
CEB	Deuteronomy	17	19	That Instruction must remain with him , and he must read in it every day of his life so that he learns to revere the Lord his God by keeping all the words of this Instruction and these regulations , by doing them ,
CEB	Deuteronomy	17	20	by not being overbearing toward his fellow Israelites , and by not deviating even a bit from the commandment . If the king does all that , he will ensure lasting rule in Israel for himself and for his successors . Footnotes - Deuteronomy 17:7 Or burn - Deuteronomy 17:12 Or burn
CEB	Deuteronomy	18	18	I ’ ll raise up a prophet for them from among their fellow Israelites—one just like you . I ’ ll put my words in his mouth , and he will tell them everything I command him .
CEB	Deuteronomy	18	2	but they won ’ t share an inheritance with their fellow Israelites . The Lord alone is the Levites ’ inheritance—just as God promised them .
CEB	Deuteronomy	18	3	Now this is what the priests may keep from the people ’ s sacrifices of oxen or sheep : They must give the priest the shoulder , the jaws , and the stomach .
CEB	Deuteronomy	18	4	You must also give the priest the first portions of your grain , wine , and oil , and the first of your sheep ’ s shearing
CEB	Deuteronomy	18	5	because the Lord your God selected Levi from all of your tribes to stand and minister in the Lord ’ s name—both him and his descendants for all time .
CEB	Deuteronomy	18	6	Now if a Levite leaves one of your cities or departs from any location in Israel where he ’ s been living and , because he wants to , comes to the location the Lord selects
CEB	Deuteronomy	18	7	and ministers in the Lord his God ’ s name , just like his relatives—the other Levites serving there in the Lord ’ s presence—
CEB	Deuteronomy	18	8	he is allowed to eat equal portions , despite the finances he has from his family . [ b ] Communicating with God
CEB	Deuteronomy	18	9	Once you enter the land that the Lord your God is giving you , don ’ t try to imitate the detestable things those nations do .
CEB	Deuteronomy	18	10	There must not be anyone among you who passes his son or daughter through fire ; who practices divination , is a sign reader , fortune-teller , sorcerer ,
CEB	Deuteronomy	18	11	or spell caster ; who converses with ghosts or spirits or communicates with the dead .
CEB	Deuteronomy	18	12	All who do these things are detestable to the Lord ! It is on account of these detestable practices that the Lord your God is driving these nations [ c ] out before you .
CEB	Deuteronomy	18	13	Instead , you must be perfect before the Lord your God .
CEB	Deuteronomy	18	14	These nations you are displacing listened to sign readers and diviners , but the Lord your God doesn ’ t permit you to do the same !
CEB	Deuteronomy	18	15	The Lord your God will raise up a prophet like me from your community , from your fellow Israelites . He ’ s the one you must listen to .
CEB	Deuteronomy	18	16	That ’ s exactly what you requested from the Lord your God at Horeb , on the day of the assembly , when you said , “ I can ’ t listen to the Lord my God ’ s voice anymore or look at this great fire any longer . I don ’ t want to die ! ”
CEB	Deuteronomy	18	17	The Lord said to me : What they ’ ve said is right .
CEB	Deuteronomy	18	19	I myself will hold accountable anyone who doesn ’ t listen to my words , which that prophet will speak in my name .
CEB	Deuteronomy	18	20	However , any prophet who arrogantly speaks a word in my name that I haven ’ t commanded him to speak , or who speaks in the name of other gods—that prophet must die .
CEB	Deuteronomy	18	21	Now , you might be wondering , How will we know which word God hasn ’ t spoken ?
CEB	Deuteronomy	18	22	Here ’ s the answer : The prophet who speaks in the Lord ’ s name and the thing doesn ’ t happen or come about—that ’ s the word the Lord hasn ’ t spoken . That prophet spoke arrogantly . Don ’ t be afraid of him .

CEB	Deuteronomy	19	19	then you must do to him what he had planned to do to his fellow Israelite . Remove [ d ] such evil from your community !
CEB	Deuteronomy	19	2	you must designate three cities for your use in the land the Lord your God is giving you to possess .
CEB	Deuteronomy	19	3	Mark out the roads to them [ a ] and divide the regions of the land the Lord your God is apportioning to you into three parts . These cities are the places to which a person who has killed can escape .
CEB	Deuteronomy	19	4	Here is the rule concerning a person who killed someone and is permitted to escape to one of these cities and live : If it is someone who killed his neighbor accidentally , without having hated that person previously ;
CEB	Deuteronomy	19	5	or if someone goes into the forest with a neighbor to chop some wood , and while swinging an ax to cut down the tree , the axhead flies off its handle and hits the neighbor , who subsequently dies—these kinds of killers may escape to one of these cities and live .
CEB	Deuteronomy	19	6	Otherwise , the blood avenger will chase after the killer out of rage and—especially if the distance to one of these cities [ b ] is too far—might catch and kill him , even though a death sentence was not in order because the killer didn ’ t have prior malice toward the other .
CEB	Deuteronomy	19	7	This is why I am commanding you as follows : Designate three cities for your use .
CEB	Deuteronomy	19	8	Now if the Lord your God enlarges your territory , as he swore to your ancestors—and he will give you all the land he swore to give to them
CEB	Deuteronomy	19	9	as long as you keep all this commandment that I am giving you right now by doing it , by loving the Lord your God , and by always walking in his ways—you can add three more cities for your use along with the first three .
CEB	Deuteronomy	19	10	Innocent blood must not be spilled in the land the Lord your God is giving to you as an inheritance , or it will be bloodshed that will be required of you .
CEB	Deuteronomy	19	11	But if someone does hate a neighbor and ambushes him , rising up against him and attacking him so he dies , and then escapes to one of these cities ,
CEB	Deuteronomy	19	12	elders from the killer ’ s hometown will send word , and the killer will be sent back from there . They will then hand him over to the blood avenger , and he will be executed .
CEB	Deuteronomy	19	13	Show no mercy to such killers . Remove [ c ] innocent bloodshed from Israel so that things go well for you . Property laws
CEB	Deuteronomy	19	14	Now in the land the Lord your God is giving you , in your allotted property that you will receive there , you must not tamper with your neighbor ’ s property line , which has been previously established . Rules for testimony
CEB	Deuteronomy	19	15	A solitary witness against someone in any crime , wrongdoing , or in any sort of misdeed that might be done is not sufficient . The decision must stand by two or three witnesses .
CEB	Deuteronomy	19	16	Now if a spiteful witness comes forward against someone , so as to testify against them falsely ,
CEB	Deuteronomy	19	17	the two persons who have a legal suit must stand before the Lord , before the priests , and before the judges that are in office at that time .
CEB	Deuteronomy	19	18	The judges will look into the situation very carefully . If it turns out that the witness is a liar—that the witness has given false testimony against his fellow Israelite—
CEB	Deuteronomy	19	20	The rest of the people will hear about this and be afraid . They won ’ t do that sort of evil thing among you again .
CEB	Deuteronomy	19	21	Show no mercy on this point : life for life , eye for eye , tooth for tooth , hand for hand , foot for foot .

CEB	Deuteronomy	20	20	That said , if you know that a tree is not a food-producing tree , you are allowed to destroy it , cutting it down and using it in the siege against the city that is fighting against you until it falls . Footnotes - Deuteronomy 20:17 See note at Deut 2:34 .
CEB	Deuteronomy	20	2	As you advance toward the war , the priest will come forward and will address the troops .
CEB	Deuteronomy	20	3	He will say to them : “ Listen , Israel : Right now you are advancing to wage war against your enemies . Don ’ t be discouraged ! Don ’ t be afraid ! Don ’ t panic ! Don ’ t shake in fear on account of them ,
CEB	Deuteronomy	20	4	because the Lord your God is going with you to fight your enemies for you and to save you. ”
CEB	Deuteronomy	20	5	The officials will also say to the troops : “ Is there anyone here who has just built a new house but hasn ’ t yet dedicated it ? He can leave and go back to his house ; otherwise , he might die in the war and someone else would dedicate the house .
CEB	Deuteronomy	20	6	Or is there anyone here who has planted a vineyard but hasn ’ t yet put it to good use ? He can leave and go back to his house ; otherwise , he might die in the battle and someone else would use the vineyard .
CEB	Deuteronomy	20	7	Or is there anyone here who is engaged but not yet married ? He may leave and go back to his house ; otherwise , he might die in the battle and someone else would marry his fiancée. ”
CEB	Deuteronomy	20	8	The officials will continue to address the troops , stating : “ Is there anyone here who is afraid and discouraged ? He can leave and go back to his house ; otherwise , his comrades might lose courage just as he has. ”
CEB	Deuteronomy	20	9	Once the officials have completed their speech to the troops , the army commanders will assume leadership of the forces .
CEB	Deuteronomy	20	10	When you approach a city to fight against it , you should first extend peaceful terms to it .
CEB	Deuteronomy	20	11	If the city responds with peaceful terms and surrenders to you , then all the people in the city will serve you as forced laborers .
CEB	Deuteronomy	20	12	However , if the city does not negotiate peacefully with you but makes war against you , you may attack it .
CEB	Deuteronomy	20	13	The Lord your God will hand it over to you ; you must kill all the city ’ s males with the sword .
CEB	Deuteronomy	20	14	However , you can take for yourselves the women , the children , the animals , and all that is in the city—all its plunder . You can then enjoy your enemies ’ plunder , which the Lord your God has given you .
CEB	Deuteronomy	20	15	That ’ s what you must do to all the cities that are located far away from you—specifically , those cities that don ’ t belong to these nations here .
CEB	Deuteronomy	20	16	But in the case of any of the cities of these peoples—the ones the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance—you must not spare any living thing .
CEB	Deuteronomy	20	17	Instead , you must place these under the ban : [ a ] Hittites , Amorites , Canaanites , Perizzites , Hivites , and Jebusites—just as the Lord your God commanded you .
CEB	Deuteronomy	20	18	Then they can ’ t teach you to do all the detestable things they did for their gods , with the result that you end up sinning against the Lord your God .
CEB	Deuteronomy	20	19	Now if you have been attacking a city for some time , fighting against it and trying to conquer it , don ’ t destroy its trees by cutting them down with axes . You can eat from those trees ; don ’ t cut them down ! Do you think a tree of the field is some sort of warrior to be attacked by you in battle ?
CEB	Deuteronomy	21	21	Then all the people of that town will stone him until he dies . Remove [ b ] such evil from your community ! All Israel will hear about this and be afraid . Hanging
CEB	Deuteronomy	21	2	your elders and judges must come out and measure the distances to the cities nearest the body .
CEB	Deuteronomy	21	3	Once it is determined which city is closest to the dead body , its elders must take a young cow that hasn ’ t been used or yet pulled a plow ,
CEB	Deuteronomy	21	4	and those elders will take the cow down to a ravine with a flowing stream—one that has not been plowed or planted—and they will break the cow ’ s neck right there in the river valley .
CEB	Deuteronomy	21	5	Then the priests , the descendants of Levi , will step forward because the Lord your God selected them to minister for him and to bless in the Lord ’ s name , and because every legal dispute and case of assault is decided by them .
CEB	Deuteronomy	21	6	All the elders of the city closest to the corpse will wash their hands over the cow whose neck was broken in the river valley .
CEB	Deuteronomy	21	7	They will then solemnly state : “ Our hands did not shed this blood . Our eyes did not see it happen .
CEB	Deuteronomy	21	8	Lord , please forgive your people Israel , whom you saved . Don ’ t put the guilt of innocent bloodshed on your people Israel. ” Then the bloodguilt will be forgiven them .
CEB	Deuteronomy	21	9	But you must remove [ a ] innocent bloodshed from your community ; do only what is right in the Lord ’ s eyes . Foreign wives
CEB	Deuteronomy	21	10	When you wage war against your enemies and the Lord hands them over to you and you take prisoners ,
CEB	Deuteronomy	21	11	if you see among the captives a beautiful woman , and you fall in love with her and take her as your wife ,
CEB	Deuteronomy	21	12	bringing her into your home , she must shave her head , cut her nails ,
CEB	Deuteronomy	21	13	remove her prisoner ’ s clothing , and live in your house , mourning her father and her mother for one month . After that , you may consummate the marriage . You will be her husband , and she will be your wife .
CEB	Deuteronomy	21	14	But if you aren ’ t pleased with her , you must send her away as she wishes . You are not allowed to sell her for money or treat her as a slave because you have humiliated her . Right of the oldest son
CEB	Deuteronomy	21	15	Now suppose a man has two wives—one of them loved and the other unloved . Both wives bear children , but the oldest male is the unloved wife ’ s child .
CEB	Deuteronomy	21	16	On the day when the man decides what will go to each of his children as an inheritance , he isn ’ t allowed to treat his loved wife ’ s son as the oldest male rather than his unloved wife ’ s son , who is the real oldest male .
CEB	Deuteronomy	21	17	Instead , he must acknowledge the unloved wife ’ s son as the oldest male , giving to him two-thirds of everything that he owns , because that son is the earliest produce of his physical power . The oldest male ’ s rights belong to that son . Rebellious children
CEB	Deuteronomy	21	18	Now if someone has a consistently stubborn and rebellious child , who refuses to listen to their father and mother—even when the parents discipline him , he won ’ t listen to them—
CEB	Deuteronomy	21	19	the father and mother will take the son before the elders of that city at its gates .
CEB	Deuteronomy	21	20	Then they will inform the city ’ s elders : “ This son of ours is consistently stubborn and rebellious , refusing to listen to us . What ’ s more , he ’ s wild and a drunkard. ”
CEB	Deuteronomy	21	22	Now if someone is guilty of a capital crime , and they are executed , and you then hang them on a tree ,
CEB	Deuteronomy	21	23	you must not leave the body hanging on the tree but must bury it the same day because God ’ s curse is on those who are hanged . [ c ] Furthermore , you must not pollute the ground that the Lord your God is giving to you as an inheritance . Footnotes - Deuteronomy 21:9 Or burn - Deuteronomy 21:21 Or burn - Deuteronomy 21:23 LXX , Vulg , Tg Neofiti God ’ s curse is on those who are hanged ; Syr , Tg Onqelos those who curse God are to be hanged ; Heb uncertain
CEB	Deuteronomy	22	22	If a man is found having sex with a woman who is married to someone else , both of them must die—the man who was having sex with the woman and the woman herself . Remove such evil from Israel !
CEB	Deuteronomy	22	2	If the owner doesn ’ t live nearby , or you don ’ t know who owns the animal , then you must take care of it . It should stay with you until your fellow Israelite comes looking for it , at which point you must return it to him .
CEB	Deuteronomy	22	3	Do the same thing in the case of a donkey . Do the same thing in the case of a piece of clothing . Do the same thing in the case of anything that your fellow Israelite loses and you end up finding . You are not allowed to sit back and do nothing about it .
CEB	Deuteronomy	22	4	Don ’ t just watch your fellow Israelite ’ s donkey or ox fall down in the road and do nothing about it . You must help your fellow Israelite get the animal up again .
CEB	Deuteronomy	22	5	Women must not wear men ’ s clothes , and men must not wear women ’ s clothes . Everyone who does such things is detestable to the Lord your God .
CEB	Deuteronomy	22	6	If you come across a bird ’ s nest along your way , whether in a tree or on the ground , with baby birds or eggs , and the mother is sitting on the baby birds or eggs , do not remove the mother from her young .
CEB	Deuteronomy	22	7	You must let the mother go , though you may take the young for yourself so that things go well for you and so you can prolong your life .
CEB	Deuteronomy	22	8	Whenever you build a new house , you must build a railing for the roof so that you don ’ t end up with innocent blood on your hands because someone fell off of it .
CEB	Deuteronomy	22	9	Don ’ t plant your vineyards with two types of seed ; otherwise , the entire crop that you have planted and the produce of the vineyard will be unusable . [ a ]
CEB	Deuteronomy	22	10	Don ’ t plow with an ox and a donkey together .
CEB	Deuteronomy	22	11	Don ’ t wear clothes that mix wool and linen together .
CEB	Deuteronomy	22	12	Make tassels for the four corners of the coat you wear . Virgin bride
CEB	Deuteronomy	22	13	Suppose a man gets married and consummates the marriage but subsequently despises his wife .
CEB	Deuteronomy	22	14	He then spreads false claims about her to the point that she has a bad reputation , because he said such things as , “ I married this woman , but when I went to have sex with her , I couldn ’ t find any proof that she was a virgin. ”
CEB	Deuteronomy	22	15	At that point , the young woman ’ s father and mother will bring proof of her virginity to the city ’ s elders at the city gate .
CEB	Deuteronomy	22	16	The young woman ’ s father will say to the elders : “ I gave my daughter to this man to be his wife , but he doesn ’ t like her anymore .
CEB	Deuteronomy	22	17	That ’ s why he has spread false claims about her , saying , ‘ I couldn ’ t find any proof that your daughter was a virgin. ’ But look ! Here ’ s proof of my daughter ’ s virginity. ” At that point they will spread out the blanket in front of the city ’ s elders .
CEB	Deuteronomy	22	18	The city ’ s elders must then take that husband and punish him .
CEB	Deuteronomy	22	19	They will fine him one hundred silver shekels , giving that to the young woman ’ s father , because that husband gave one of Israel ’ s virgin daughters a bad reputation . Moreover , she must remain his wife ; he is never allowed to divorce her .
CEB	Deuteronomy	22	20	However , if the claim is true and proof of the young woman ’ s virginity can ’ t be produced ,
CEB	Deuteronomy	22	21	then the city ’ s elders will bring the young woman to the door of her father ’ s house . The citizens of that city must stone her until she dies because she acted so sinfully in Israel by having extramarital sex while still in her father ’ s house .

CEB	Deuteronomy	24	3	But this new husband also dislikes her , writes up divorce papers , hands them to her , and sends her out of his house ( or suppose the second husband dies ) .
CEB	Deuteronomy	24	4	In this case , the first husband who originally divorced this woman is not allowed to take her back and marry her again after she has been polluted in this way because the Lord detests that . Don ’ t pollute the land the Lord your God is giving to you as an inheritance .

CEB	Deuteronomy	24	14	Don ’ t take advantage of poor or needy workers , whether they are fellow Israelites or immigrants who live in your land or your cities .

CEB	Deuteronomy	25	25	Now two people have a disagreement and they enter into litigation and their case is decided , with the judges declaring one person legally right and the other legally liable .

Instead , her brother-in-law should go to her and take her as his wife . He will then consummate the marriage according to the brother-in-law ’ s duty .
CEB	Deuteronomy	25	6	The brother-in-law will name the oldest male son that she bears after his dead brother so that his brother ’ s legacy will not be forgotten in Israel .
CEB	Deuteronomy	25	7	If the brother does not want to marry his sister-in-law , she can go to the elders at the city gate , informing them : “ My brother-in-law refuses to continue his brother ’ s legacy in Israel . He ’ s not willing to perform the brother-in-law ’ s duty with me. ”
CEB	Deuteronomy	25	8	The city ’ s elders will summon him and talk to him about this . If he doesn ’ t budge , insisting , “ I don ’ t want to marry her , ”
CEB	Deuteronomy	25	9	then the sister-in-law will approach him while the elders watch . She will pull the sandal off his foot and spit in his face . Then she will exclaim : “ That ’ s what ’ s done to any man who won ’ t build up his own brother ’ s family ! ”
CEB	Deuteronomy	25	10	Subsequently , that man ’ s family will be known throughout Israel as “ the house of the removed sandal. ” Improper touching
CEB	Deuteronomy	25	11	If two men are fighting with each other—a man and his fellow Israelite—and the wife of one of them gets into the fight , trying to save her husband from his attacker and does so by reaching out and grabbing his genitals ,
CEB	Deuteronomy	25	12	you must cut off her hand . Show no mercy . Honest business practices
CEB	Deuteronomy	25	13	Don ’ t have two different types of money weights in your bag , a heavy one and a light one .
CEB	Deuteronomy	25	14	Don ’ t have two different types of ephahs in your house , a large one and a small one .
CEB	Deuteronomy	25	15	Instead , you must have only one weight , complete and correct , and only one ephah , also complete and correct , so that your life might be long in the fertile land the Lord your God is giving you .
CEB	Deuteronomy	25	16	What ’ s more , all who do such things , all who do business dishonestly , are detestable to the Lord your God .
CEB	Deuteronomy	25	17	Remember , after all , what Amalek did to you on your departure from Egypt :
CEB	Deuteronomy	25	18	how he met up with you on the way , striking from behind those who were lagging back because you were weak and tired , and because he didn ’ t fear God .
CEB	Deuteronomy	25	19	So once the Lord your God gives you relief from all the enemies that surround you in the land the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance to possess , you must wipe out Amalek ’ s memory from under the heavens . Don ’ t forget this !
CEB	Deuteronomy	26	26	Once you have entered the land the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance , and you take possession of it and are settled there ,
CEB	Deuteronomy	26	2	take some of the early produce of the fertile ground that you have harvested from the land the Lord your God is giving you , and put it in a basket . Then go to the location the Lord your God selects for his name to reside .
CEB	Deuteronomy	26	3	Go to the priest who is in office at that time and say to him : “ I am declaring right now before the Lord my [ a ] God that I have indeed arrived in the land the Lord swore to our ancestors to give us. ”
CEB	Deuteronomy	26	4	The priest will then take the basket from you and place it before the Lord your God ’ s altar .
CEB	Deuteronomy	26	5	Then you should solemnly state before the Lord your God : “ My father was a starving Aramean . He went down to Egypt , living as an immigrant there with few family members , but that is where he became a great nation , mighty and numerous .
CEB	Deuteronomy	26	6	The Egyptians treated us terribly , oppressing us and forcing hard labor on us .
CEB	Deuteronomy	26	7	So we cried out for help to the Lord , our ancestors ’ God . The Lord heard our call . God saw our misery , our trouble , and our oppression .
CEB	Deuteronomy	26	8	The Lord brought us out of Egypt with a strong hand and an outstretched arm , with awesome power , and with signs and wonders .
CEB	Deuteronomy	26	9	He brought us to this place and gave us this land—a land full of milk and honey .

CEB	Deuteronomy	26	11	Then celebrate all the good things the Lord your God has done for you and your family—each one of you along with the Levites and the immigrants who are among you .
CEB	Deuteronomy	26	12	When you have finished paying the entire tenth part of your produce on the third year—that is the year for paying the tenth-part—you will give it to the Levites , the immigrants , the orphans , and the widows so they can eat in your cities until they are full .
CEB	Deuteronomy	26	13	Then announce before the Lord your God : “ I have removed the holy portion from my [ b ] house , and I have given it to the Levites , the immigrants , the orphans , and the widows—in full compliance with your entire commandment that you commanded me . I haven ’ t broken your commandments . I haven ’ t forgotten one !
CEB	Deuteronomy	26	14	I haven ’ t eaten from the holy portion while mourning , nor did I remove it while I was polluted , nor have I dedicated any of it to the dead . I ’ ve obeyed the Lord my God ’ s voice . I ’ ve done everything just as you commanded me .
CEB	Deuteronomy	26	15	Please look down from your holy home , from heaven itself , and bless your people Israel and the fertile land that you have given us—a land full of milk and honey—just like you promised our ancestors. ” Conclusion to the regulations and case laws

CEB	Deuteronomy	27	4	Once you have crossed over the Jordan River , set up these stones that I ’ m telling you about right now on Mount Ebal . Cover them with plaster
CEB	Deuteronomy	27	5	and build an altar there for the Lord your God—an altar of stones that haven ’ t been cut with iron tools .

CEB	Deuteronomy	28	53	You will eat the offspring of your own womb—the flesh of your own sons and daughters , whom the Lord your God gave you—because of the desperate and dire circumstances that your enemy has brought on you .
CEB	Deuteronomy	28	54	Even the most gentle and refined man among you will scowl at his brother or his own dear wife , or the last of his surviving children .
CEB	Deuteronomy	28	55	He won ’ t want to give them any of his children ’ s flesh that he will be eating because he has no other food due to the desperate and dire circumstances that your enemy has brought on you in all your cities .
CEB	Deuteronomy	28	56	Even the most gentle and refined woman among you , who is so refined and gentle she wouldn ’ t stomp her foot on the ground , will scowl at her own dear husband , her son , or her daughter—
CEB	Deuteronomy	28	57	not wanting to give them any of the afterbirth she pushed out or the babies she bore , because she will be eating them secretly while starving due to the desperate and dire circumstances that your enemy will bring on you in your cities .
CEB	Deuteronomy	28	58	If you don ’ t carefully keep all the words of this Instruction that are written in this scroll , by fearing the awesome and glorious name of the Lord your God—
CEB	Deuteronomy	28	59	the Lord will overwhelm you and your descendants with severe and chronic afflictions , and with terrible and untreatable sicknesses .
CEB	Deuteronomy	28	60	He ’ ll put on you all the Egyptian diseases about which you were so afraid ; they will stick to you !
CEB	Deuteronomy	28	61	What ’ s more , the Lord will bring on you all the other diseases and plagues that aren ’ t written in this Instruction scroll until you are completely wiped out .
CEB	Deuteronomy	28	62	Once as countless as the stars in the night sky , only a few of you will be left alive—all because you didn ’ t obey the Lord your God ’ s voice .
CEB	Deuteronomy	28	63	And just as before , the Lord enjoyed doing good things for you and increasing your numbers , now the Lord will enjoy annihilating and destroying you . You will be torn off the very fertile land you are entering to possess .
CEB	Deuteronomy	28	64	The Lord will scatter you among every nation , from one end of the earth to the other . There you will serve other gods that neither you nor your ancestors have known—gods of wood and stone .
CEB	Deuteronomy	28	65	Among those nations you will have no rest and no place to call your own . [ f ] There the Lord will give you an agitated mind , failing eyes , and a depressed spirit .
CEB	Deuteronomy	28	66	Your life will seem to dangle before your very eyes . You will be afraid night and day . You won ’ t be able to count on surviving for long .
CEB	Deuteronomy	28	67	In the morning you will say : “ I wish it was nighttime , ” but at nighttime you will say , “ I wish it was morning ” —on account of your tortured mind , which will be terrified , and because of the horrible sights that your eyes will see .
CEB	Deuteronomy	28	68	Finally , the Lord will take you back to Egypt in ships , by the route I promised you would never see again . There you will try to sell yourselves as slaves—both male and female—but no one will want to buy you .

CEB	Deuteronomy	29	2	[ b ] Moses summoned all Israel , saying to them : You ’ ve seen with your own eyes everything the Lord did in Egypt , to Pharaoh , his servants , and all his land—
CEB	Deuteronomy	29	3	the great trials your eyes witnessed , those awesome signs and wonders !
CEB	Deuteronomy	29	4	But until this very moment , the Lord hasn ’ t given you insight to understand , eyes to see , or ears to hear .
CEB	Deuteronomy	29	5	I ’ ve led you in the wilderness forty years now ; neither the clothes on your back nor the sandals on your feet have worn out .
CEB	Deuteronomy	29	6	Neither have you eaten bread nor drunk wine or beer during this time—so that you would know that I am the Lord your God . [ c ]
CEB	Deuteronomy	29	7	When you arrived here , Sihon , Heshbon ’ s king , and Og , Bashan ’ s king , marched out to fight against us , but we defeated them .
CEB	Deuteronomy	29	8	We took possession of their land and gave it as an inheritance to the Reubenites , Gadites , and half of Manasseh ’ s tribe .
CEB	Deuteronomy	29	9	So then keep the words of this covenant and do them so you can succeed in all you do .
CEB	Deuteronomy	29	10	Right now , all of you are in the presence of the Lord your God—the leaders of your tribes , [ d ] your elders , and your officials , all the Israelite males ,
CEB	Deuteronomy	29	11	your children , your wives , and the immigrants who live with you in your camp , the ones who chop your wood and those who draw your water—
CEB	Deuteronomy	29	12	ready to enter into the Lord your God ’ s covenant and into the agreement that the Lord your God is making with you right now .
CEB	Deuteronomy	29	13	That means the Lord will make you his own people right now—he will be your God just as he promised you and just as he swore to our ancestors : to Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob .
CEB	Deuteronomy	29	14	But I ’ m not making this covenant and this agreement with you alone
CEB	Deuteronomy	29	15	but also with those standing here with us right now before the Lord our God , and also with those who aren ’ t here with us right now .
CEB	Deuteronomy	29	16	You know firsthand how we used to live in Egypt and how we passed right through the nations that you passed through .
CEB	Deuteronomy	29	17	You saw the horrific things , the filthy idols of wood and stone , silver and gold , that they had with them .
CEB	Deuteronomy	29	18	Make sure there isn ’ t any one among you right now—male or female , clan or tribe—whose mind is turning from being with the Lord our God in favor of going to serve these nations ’ gods . Make sure there isn ’ t any root among you that is sprouting poison and bitterness .
CEB	Deuteronomy	29	19	When that kind of person hears the words of this agreement , they congratulate themselves , thinking : I ’ ll be fine even though I insist on being stubborn . This would cause something wet to dry up and become like something parched . [ e ]
CEB	Deuteronomy	29	20	The Lord won ’ t be willing to forgive that kind of person ; instead , the Lord ’ s anger and passion will smolder against that person . Every curse written in this scroll will stretch out over them , and the Lord will wipe out their name from under the heavens .
CEB	Deuteronomy	29	21	Out of all Israel ’ s tribes , the Lord will single them out for disaster in compliance with all the covenant curses that are written in this Instruction scroll .
CEB	Deuteronomy	29	22	Future generations , your children after you , or foreigners from distant lands will say : Look [ f ] at all that land ’ s plagues and the sicknesses that the Lord laid on it !
CEB	Deuteronomy	29	23	Look at all its land burned by sulfur and salt , unsuitable for planting , unable to grow or produce any vegetation , as devastated as Sodom and Gomorrah , Admah and Zeboiim , which the Lord devastated in anger and wrath !
CEB	Deuteronomy	29	24	Indeed , all nations will ask : Why did the Lord do this to this land ? What led to this terrible display of anger ?
CEB	Deuteronomy	29	25	They will deduce : It was because those people abandoned the covenant of the Lord , their ancestors ’ God , which he made with them when he brought them out of Egypt .
CEB	Deuteronomy	29	26	They followed other gods , serving them and worshipping them—other gods that they hadn ’ t experienced before and that the Lord hadn ’ t designated for them .
CEB	Deuteronomy	29	27	Then the Lord ’ s anger burned against that land , and he brought against it every curse written in this scroll .
CEB	Deuteronomy	29	28	The Lord ripped them off their land in anger , wrath , and great fury . He threw them into other lands , and that ’ s how things still stand today .
CEB	Deuteronomy	30	30	Now , once all these things happen to you , the blessing and the curse that I ’ m setting before you , you must call them to mind as you sit among the various nations where the Lord your God has driven you ;
CEB	Deuteronomy	30	2	and you must return to the Lord your God , obeying his voice , in line with all that I ’ m commanding you right now—you and your children—with all your mind and with all your being .
CEB	Deuteronomy	30	3	Then the Lord your God will restore you as you were before and will have compassion on you , gathering you up from all the peoples where the Lord your God scattered you .
CEB	Deuteronomy	30	4	Even if he has driven you to the far end of heaven , the Lord your God will gather you up from there ; he will take you back from there .
CEB	Deuteronomy	30	5	The Lord your God will bring you home to the land that your ancestors possessed ; you will possess it again . And he will do good things for you and multiply you—making you more numerous even than your ancestors !
CEB	Deuteronomy	30	6	Then the Lord your God will circumcise your hearts and the hearts of your descendants so that you love the Lord your God with all your mind and with all your being in order that you may live .
CEB	Deuteronomy	30	7	The Lord your God will put all these curses on your enemies and on those who hate you and chase you .
CEB	Deuteronomy	30	8	But you will change and obey the Lord ’ s voice and do all his commandments that I ’ m commanding you right now .
CEB	Deuteronomy	30	9	The Lord your God will help you succeed in everything you do—in your own fertility , your livestock ’ s offspring , and your land ’ s produce—everything will be great ! Because the Lord will once again enjoy doing good things for you just as he enjoyed doing them for your ancestors ,
CEB	Deuteronomy	30	10	and because you will be obeying the Lord your God ’ s voice , keeping his commandments and his regulations that are written in this Instruction scroll , and because you will have returned to the Lord your God with all your heart and all your being .
CEB	Deuteronomy	30	11	This commandment that I ’ m giving you right now is definitely not too difficult for you . It isn ’ t unreachable .
CEB	Deuteronomy	30	12	It isn ’ t up in heaven somewhere so that you have to ask , “ Who will go up for us to heaven and get it for us that we can hear it and do it ? ”
CEB	Deuteronomy	30	13	Nor is it across the ocean somewhere so that you have to ask , “ Who will cross the ocean for us and get it for us that we can hear it and do it ? ”
CEB	Deuteronomy	30	14	Not at all ! The word is very close to you . It ’ s in your mouth and in your heart , waiting for you to do it . Life and death
CEB	Deuteronomy	30	15	Look here ! Today I ’ ve set before you life and what ’ s good versus death and what ’ s wrong .
CEB	Deuteronomy	30	16	If you obey the Lord your God ’ s commandments that [ a ] I ’ m commanding you right now by loving the Lord your God , by walking in his ways , and by keeping his commandments , his regulations , and his case laws , then you will live and thrive , and the Lord your God will bless you in the land you are entering to possess .
CEB	Deuteronomy	30	17	But if your heart turns away and you refuse to listen , and so are misled , worshipping other gods and serving them ,
CEB	Deuteronomy	30	18	I ’ m telling you right now that you will definitely die . You will not prolong your life on the fertile land that you are crossing the Jordan River to enter and possess .
CEB	Deuteronomy	30	19	I call heaven and earth as my witnesses against you right now : I have set life and death , blessing and curse before you . Now choose life—so that you and your descendants will live—
CEB	Deuteronomy	30	20	by loving the Lord your God , by obeying his voice , and by clinging to him . That ’ s how you will survive and live long on the fertile land the Lord swore to give to your ancestors : to Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob . Footnotes - Deuteronomy 30:16 LXX ; MT lacks if you obey the Lord your God ’ s commandments .
CEB	Deuteronomy	31	31	Then Moses said [ a ] these words to all Israel ,
CEB	Deuteronomy	31	2	telling them : I ’ m
CEB	Deuteronomy	31	120	years old today . I can ’ t move around well anymore . Plus , the Lord told me “ You won ’ t cross the Jordan River. ”
CEB	Deuteronomy	31	3	But the Lord your God , he ’ s the one who will cross over before you ! He ’ s the one who will destroy these nations before you so you can displace them . Joshua too will cross over before you just like the Lord indicated .
CEB	Deuteronomy	31	4	The Lord will do to these enemies the same thing he did to the Amorite kings Sihon and Og , and to their land , when he destroyed them .
CEB	Deuteronomy	31	5	The Lord will lay them out before you , and you will do to them exactly what the command I ’ ve given you dictates .
CEB	Deuteronomy	31	6	Be strong ! Be fearless ! Don ’ t be afraid and don ’ t be scared by your enemies , because the Lord your God is the one who marches with you . He won ’ t let you down , and he won ’ t abandon you .
CEB	Deuteronomy	31	7	Then Moses called Joshua and , with all Israel watching , said to him : “ Be strong and fearless because you are the one who will lead [ b ] this people to the land the Lord swore to their ancestors to give to them ; you are the one who will divide up the land for them .
CEB	Deuteronomy	31	8	But the Lord is the one who is marching before you ! He is the one who will be with you ! He won ’ t let you down . He won ’ t abandon you . So don ’ t be afraid or scared ! ” Regular reading of the Instruction
CEB	Deuteronomy	31	9	Then Moses wrote this Instruction down and gave it to the priests—the Levites who carry the chest containing the Lord ’ s covenant—and to all of the Israelite elders .
CEB	Deuteronomy	31	10	Moses then commanded them : At the end of seven years , at the appointed time in the year of debt cancellation , during the Festival of Booths ,
CEB	Deuteronomy	31	11	when all Israel comes to appear before the Lord your God at the location he selects , you must read this Instruction aloud , in the hearing of all the people .
CEB	Deuteronomy	31	12	Gather everyone—men , women , children , and the immigrants who live in your cities—in order that they hear it , learn it , and revere the Lord your God , carefully doing all the words of this Instruction ,
CEB	Deuteronomy	31	13	and so that their children , who don ’ t yet know the Instruction , may hear it and learn to revere the Lord your God for as long as you live on the ground you are crossing the Jordan River to possess . Joshua commissioned
CEB	Deuteronomy	31	14	Then the Lord said to Moses : “ It ’ s almost time for you to die . Summon Joshua . The two of you must present yourselves at the meeting tent so I can command him. ” So Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves at the meeting tent .
CEB	Deuteronomy	31	15	The Lord appeared in the tent in a pillar of cloud ; the cloud pillar stood at the tent ’ s entrance .
CEB	Deuteronomy	31	16	The Lord then said to Moses : “ Soon you will rest with your ancestors , and the people will rise up and act unfaithfully , going after strange gods of the land they are entering . They will abandon me , breaking my covenant that I made with them .
CEB	Deuteronomy	31	17	At that point my anger will burn against them , and I ’ ll be the one who abandons them ! I ’ ll hide my face from them . They will become nothing but food for their enemies , [ c ] and all sorts of bad things and misfortunes will happen to them . Then they will say : ‘ Haven ’ t these terrible things happened to us because our God is no longer with us ? ’
CEB	Deuteronomy	31	18	But I will hide my face at that time because of the many wrong things they have done , because they have turned to other gods !
CEB	Deuteronomy	31	19	So in light of all that , you must write down this poem and teach it to the Israelites . Put it in their mouths so that the poem becomes a witness for me against them .
CEB	Deuteronomy	31	20	When I bring the Israelites to the land I swore to their ancestors , which is full of milk and honey , and they eat , get full , then fat , and then turn toward other gods , serving them and disrespecting me and breaking my covenant ,
CEB	Deuteronomy	31	21	then , when all kinds of bad things and misfortunes happen to them , this poem will witness against them , giving its testimony , because it won ’ t be lost from the mouths of their descendants . Yes , I know right now what they are inclined to do , even before I ’ ve brought them into the land I swore. ”
CEB	Deuteronomy	31	22	So Moses wrote this poem down that very day , and he taught it to the Israelites .
CEB	Deuteronomy	31	23	Then the Lord commissioned Joshua , Nun ’ s son : “ Be strong and fearless because you are the one who will bring the Israelites to the land I swore to them . I myself will be with you. ” Life after Moses
CEB	Deuteronomy	31	24	Once Moses had finished writing in their entirety all the words of this Instruction scroll ,
CEB	Deuteronomy	31	25	he commanded the Levites who carry the chest containing the Lord ’ s covenant as follows :
CEB	Deuteronomy	31	26	“ Take this Instruction scroll and put it next to the chest containing the Lord your God ’ s covenant . It must remain there as a witness against you
CEB	Deuteronomy	31	27	because I know how rebellious and hardheaded you are . If you are this rebellious toward the Lord while I ’ m still alive , it ’ s bound to get worse once I ’ m dead !
CEB	Deuteronomy	31	28	Assemble all of your tribes ’ elders and your officials in front of me , so I can speak these words in their hearing , and so I can call heaven and earth as my witnesses against them ,
CEB	Deuteronomy	31	29	because I know that after I ’ m dead , you will ruin everything , departing from the path I ’ ve commanded you . Terrible things will happen to you in the future because you will do evil in the Lord ’ s eyes , aggravating him with the things your hands have made. ” The poem of Instruction
CEB	Deuteronomy	31	30	Then Moses recited in their entirety the words of this poem in the hearing of the entire assembly of Israel : Footnotes - Deuteronomy 31:1 LXX , DSS ( 1QDeutb ) When Moses had finished speaking - Deuteronomy 31:7 Sam , Vulg , Syr ; MT , Tg accompany - Deuteronomy 31:17 Heb lacks for their enemies .
CEB	Deuteronomy	32	32	Their roots run straight from Sodom— from the fields of Gomorrah ! Their grapes are pure poison ; their grape clusters , nothing but bitter ;
CEB	Deuteronomy	32	2	My teaching will fall like raindrops ; my speech will settle like dew— like gentle rains on grass , like spring showers on all that is green—
CEB	Deuteronomy	32	3	because I proclaim the Lord ’ s name : Give praise to our God !
CEB	Deuteronomy	32	4	The rock : his acts are perfection ! No doubt about it : all his ways are right ! He ’ s the faithful God , never deceiving ; altogether righteous and true is he .
CEB	Deuteronomy	32	5	But children who weren ’ t his own [ a ] sinned against him with their defects ; [ b ] they are a twisted and perverse generation .
CEB	Deuteronomy	32	6	Is this how you thank the Lord , you stupid , senseless people ? Isn ’ t he your father , your creator ? Didn ’ t he make you and establish you ?
CEB	Deuteronomy	32	7	Remember the days long past ; consider the years long gone . Ask your father , he will tell you about it ; ask your elders , they will give you the details :
CEB	Deuteronomy	32	8	When God Most High divided up the nations— when he divided up humankind— he decided the people ’ s boundaries based on the number of the gods . [ c ]
CEB	Deuteronomy	32	9	Surely the Lord ’ s property was his people ; Jacob was his part of the inheritance .
CEB	Deuteronomy	32	10	God found [ d ] Israel in a wild land— in a howling desert wasteland— he protected him , cared for him , watched over him with his very own eye .
CEB	Deuteronomy	32	11	Like an eagle protecting its nest , hovering over its young , God spread out his wings , took hold of Israel , carried him on his back .
CEB	Deuteronomy	32	12	The Lord alone led Israel ; no foreign god assisted .
CEB	Deuteronomy	32	13	God [ e ] made Israel [ f ] glide over the highlands ; he fed him [ g ] with food from the field , nursed him with honey from a boulder , with oil from a hard rock :
CEB	Deuteronomy	32	14	curds from the herd , milk from the flock , along with the best of lambs , rams from Bashan , he-goats too , along with the finest wheat— and for drink , wine from the juiciest grapes !
CEB	Deuteronomy	32	15	Jacob ate until he was stuffed ; [ h ] Jeshurun [ i ] got fat , then rebellious . [ j ] It was you who got fat , thick , stubborn ! [ k ] Jeshurun [ l ] gave up on the God who made him , thought the rock of his salvation was worthless .
CEB	Deuteronomy	32	16	They made God [ m ] jealous with strange gods , aggravated him with detestable things .
CEB	Deuteronomy	32	17	They sacrificed to demons , not to God , to deities of which they had no knowledge— new gods only recently on the scene , ones about which your ancestors had never heard . [ n ]
CEB	Deuteronomy	32	18	You deserted [ o ] the rock that sired you ; you forgot the God who gave birth to you !
CEB	Deuteronomy	32	19	The Lord saw this and rejected out of aggravation his sons and his daughters . [ p ]
CEB	Deuteronomy	32	20	He said : I will hide my face from them— I will see what becomes of them— because they are a confused generation ; they are children lacking loyalty .
CEB	Deuteronomy	32	21	They provoked me with “ no-gods , ” aggravated me with their pieces of junk . So I am going to provoke them with “ No-People , ” aggravate them with a nation of fools .
CEB	Deuteronomy	32	22	A fire burns in me— it will blaze to the depths of the grave ; [ q ] it will destroy the land and its crops ; it will blacken the base of the mountains .
CEB	Deuteronomy	32	23	I ’ ll throw [ r ] on them disaster after disaster ; I ’ ll destroy them with my arrows :
CEB	Deuteronomy	32	24	devastating hunger , consuming plague , bitter sickness . I ’ ll send animal fangs after them , venom from dust crawlers too .
CEB	Deuteronomy	32	25	Outside , in the streets , the sword will bereave ! Inside , in the safest room , there will be terror for young men and women , nursing baby and senior citizen .

CEB	Deuteronomy	32	27	but their enemies ’ rage concerned me ; their opponents might misunderstand . They might say , “ Our strong hands , not the Lord ’ s , did all this , ”
CEB	Deuteronomy	32	28	because they are not a thoughtful nation ; they lack any insight .
CEB	Deuteronomy	32	29	If they had any wisdom , they would understand this ; they would discern what will become of them .
CEB	Deuteronomy	32	30	How could one person chase off a thousand in battle ? How could two people make ten thousand flee for their lives ? Only because their rock sold them off , only because the Lord handed them over !
CEB	Deuteronomy	32	31	But , no , their rocks can ’ t compare to our rock ! Our enemies are completely stupid . [ t ]
CEB	Deuteronomy	32	33	their wine is snake poison , venom from a cruel cobra .
CEB	Deuteronomy	32	34	Don ’ t I have this stored up , sealed in my vaults ?
CEB	Deuteronomy	32	35	Revenge is my domain , so is punishment-in-kind , at the exact moment their step slips up , because the day of their destruction is just around the corner ; their final destiny is speeding on its way !
CEB	Deuteronomy	32	36	But the Lord will acquit his people , will have compassion on those who serve him , once he sees that their strength is all gone , that both prisoners and free people are wiped out . [ u ]
CEB	Deuteronomy	32	37	The Lord will ask , “ Where are their gods— the rocks they trusted in—
CEB	Deuteronomy	32	38	who ate up the fat of their sacrifices , who drank their sacred wine ? They should stand up and help you ! They should protect you now !
CEB	Deuteronomy	32	39	Now , look here : I myself , I ’ m the one ; there are no other gods with me . I ’ m the one who deals death and gives life ; I ’ m the one who wounded , but now I will heal . There ’ s no escaping my hand .
CEB	Deuteronomy	32	40	But now I ’ m lifting my hand to heaven— I swear by my own eternity :
CEB	Deuteronomy	32	41	when I sharpen my blazing sword and my hand grabs hold of justice , I ’ ll pay my enemies back ; I ’ ll punish in kind everyone who hates me .
CEB	Deuteronomy	32	42	I ’ ll make my arrows drink much blood , while my sword devours flesh , the blood of the dead and captured , flowing from the heads of enemy generals. ” [ v ]
CEB	Deuteronomy	32	43	Heavens : [ w ] Rejoice with God ! [ x ] All you gods : bow down to the Lord ! [ y ] Because he will avenge his children ’ s [ z ] blood ; he will pay back his enemies ; he will punish in kind those who hate him ; [ aa ] he will cleanse his people ’ s land . [ ab ]
CEB	Deuteronomy	32	44	So Moses came and recited all the words of this poem in everyone ’ s hearing ; Joshua , [ ac ] Nun ’ s son , joined him .
CEB	Deuteronomy	32	45	When Moses finished speaking all these words to all Israel ,
CEB	Deuteronomy	32	46	he told them : Set your mind on all these words I ’ m testifying against you right now , because you must command your children to perform carefully all the words of this Instruction .
CEB	Deuteronomy	32	47	This is no trivial matter for you—this is your very life ! It is by this means [ ad ] alone that you will prolong your life on the fertile land you are crossing the Jordan River to possess . Moses ’ death imminent
CEB	Deuteronomy	32	48	The Lord spoke to Moses that very same day :
CEB	Deuteronomy	32	49	“ Hike up the Abarim mountains , to Mount Nebo , which is in the land of Moab opposite Jericho . Take a good look at the land of Canaan , which I ’ m giving to the Israelites as their property .
CEB	Deuteronomy	32	50	You will die on the mountain you have hiked up , and you will be gathered to your people just like your brother Aaron , who died on Mount Hor and was gathered to his people ,
CEB	Deuteronomy	32	51	because the two of you were unfaithful toward me in front of the Israelites at the waters of Meribath-kadesh , in the Zin wilderness , because you didn ’ t treat me with proper respect before the Israelites .
CEB	Deuteronomy	32	52	You can look at the land from the other side of the river , [ ae ] but you won ’ t enter there. ” [ af ] Footnotes - Deuteronomy 32:5 Heb uncertain - Deuteronomy 32:5 LXX , Vulg ; Heb uncertain - Deuteronomy 32:8 DSS ( 4QDeutj ) , LXX ; MT the Israelites - Deuteronomy 32:10 Vulg , Syr , and others ; Sam , LXX , Tg Onkelos sustained him - Deuteronomy 32:13 Or he - Deuteronomy 32:13 Or him - Deuteronomy 32:13 Sam , Syr , LXX , Tg ; MT he ate - Deuteronomy 32:15 DSS ( 4QPhyln ) , Sam , LXX ; MT lacks Jacob ate until he was stuffed . - Deuteronomy 32:15 A poetic name for Israel ; see also 33:5 ,

CEB	Deuteronomy	33	3	Yes , those who love [ d ] the nations— all his holy ones—were at your command ; they followed your footsteps ; they got moving when you said so .
CEB	Deuteronomy	33	4	Moses gave the Instruction to us— it ’ s the prized possession of Jacob ’ s assembly .
CEB	Deuteronomy	33	5	A king came to rule in Jeshurun , when the people ’ s leaders gathered together , when Israel ’ s tribes were one .
CEB	Deuteronomy	33	6	“ I pray that Reuben lives , doesn ’ t die , though his numbers are so few. ”
CEB	Deuteronomy	33	7	Moses said this to Judah : “ Lord , listen to Judah ’ s voice ! Bring him back to his own people , strengthen his hands ; [ e ] be his help against every enemy. ”
CEB	Deuteronomy	33	8	Then he told Levi : “ Give your Thummim to Levi , [ f ] your Urim to your faithful one— the one you tested at Massah , the one you challenged by Meribah ’ s waters ;
CEB	Deuteronomy	33	9	the one who said of his own mother and father : ‘ I don ’ t consider them as such ’ ; of their siblings : ‘ I don ’ t recognize them ’ ; of their own children , ‘ I don ’ t know them ’ — but who obeyed your words and who guarded your covenant !
CEB	Deuteronomy	33	10	They teach your case laws to Jacob , your Instruction to Israel . They hold sweet incense to your nose ; put the entirely burned offering on your altar .
CEB	Deuteronomy	33	11	I pray that the Lord blesses Levi ’ s strength , favors his hard work , and crushes the insides of his enemies so that those who hate him can ’ t fight anymore. ”
CEB	Deuteronomy	33	12	He said to Benjamin : “ The Lord ’ s dearest one rests safely on him . The Lord always shields him ; he rests on God ’ s chest. ”
CEB	Deuteronomy	33	13	Then he told Joseph : “ I pray that his land is blessed by God : with heaven ’ s gifts from above , [ g ] with the deep waters stretching out underneath ;
CEB	Deuteronomy	33	14	with the gifts produced by the sun , with the gifts generated by the moon ; [ h ]
CEB	Deuteronomy	33	15	with the best fruit from ancient mountains , with the gifts of eternal hills ;
CEB	Deuteronomy	33	16	with the gifts of the earth and all that fills it , and the favor of the one who lives on Sinai . [ i ] I pray that all these rest on Joseph ’ s head , on the crown of that prince among brothers .
CEB	Deuteronomy	33	17	A firstborn bull [ j ] —that ’ s how majestic he is ! A wild ox ’ s horns—those are his horns ! With them he gores all peoples completely , to the far ends of the earth ! His horns [ k ] are Ephraim ’ s tens of thousands . His horns are Manasseh ’ s thousands. ”
CEB	Deuteronomy	33	18	Then he told Zebulun : “ Zebulun : celebrate when you are out and about ; Issachar : celebrate when you are at home in your tents !
CEB	Deuteronomy	33	19	They call all sorts of people to the mountain , where they offer right sacrifices . It ’ s true : They ’ re nourished on the sea ’ s abundance ; they are nourished on buried treasures in the sand. ”
CEB	Deuteronomy	33	20	Then he told Gad : “ May Gad ’ s broad lands [ l ] be blessed ! He lives like a lion : he rips an arm , even a head !
CEB	Deuteronomy	33	21	He chose the best part for himself because there , where the commander ’ s portion was , the leaders of the people gathered together . [ m ] Gad executed the Lord ’ s justice and the Lord ’ s judgments for Israel. ” [ n ]
CEB	Deuteronomy	33	22	Then he told Dan : “ Dan is a lion cub . He jumps up from Bashan. ”
CEB	Deuteronomy	33	23	Then he told Naphtali : “ Naphtali—you are full of favor , overflowing with the Lord ’ s blessing— go possess the west and the south ! ”
CEB	Deuteronomy	33	24	Finally , he told Asher : “ Asher is the most blessed of sons . I pray that he ’ s his brothers ’ favorite— one who dips his foot in fine oil .
CEB	Deuteronomy	33	25	I pray that your dead bolts are iron and copper , and that your strength lasts all your days. ” [ o ]
CEB	Deuteronomy	33	26	Jeshurun ! No one compares to God ! He rides through heaven to help you , rides majestically through the clouds .
CEB	Deuteronomy	33	27	The most ancient God is a place of safety ; [ p ] the eternal arms are a support . [ q ] He drove out the enemy before you . He commanded : “ Destroy them ! ”
CEB	Deuteronomy	33	28	So Israel now lives in safety— Jacob ’ s residence [ r ] is secure— in a land full of grain and wine , where the heavens drip dew .
CEB	Deuteronomy	33	29	Happy are you , Israel ! Who is like you ? You are a people saved by the Lord ! He ’ s the shield that helps you , your majestic sword ! Your enemies will come crawling on their knees to you , but you will stomp on their backs !

CEB	Deuteronomy	34	34	Then Moses hiked up from the Moabite plains to Mount Nebo , the peak of the Pisgah slope , which faces Jericho . The Lord showed him the whole land : the Gilead region as far as Dan ’ s territory ;
CEB	Deuteronomy	34	2	all the parts belonging to Naphtali along with the land of Ephraim and Manasseh , as well as the entirety of Judah as far as the Mediterranean Sea ;
CEB	Deuteronomy	34	3	also the arid southern plain , and the plain—including the Jericho Valley , Palm City—as far as Zoar .
CEB	Deuteronomy	34	4	Then the Lord said to Moses : “ This is the land that I swore to Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob when I promised : ‘ I will give it to your descendants. ’ I have shown it to you with your own eyes ; however , you will not cross over into it. ”
CEB	Deuteronomy	34	5	Then Moses , the Lord ’ s servant , died—right there in the land of Moab , according to the Lord ’ s command .
CEB	Deuteronomy	34	6	The Lord buried him in a valley in Moabite country across from Beth-peor . Even now , no one knows where Moses ’ grave is .
CEB	Deuteronomy	34	7	Moses was
CEB	Deuteronomy	34	120	years old when he died . His eyesight wasn ’ t impaired , and his vigor hadn ’ t diminished a bit .
CEB	Deuteronomy	34	8	Back down in the Moabite plains , the Israelites mourned Moses ’ death for thirty days . At that point , the time for weeping and for mourning Moses was over .
CEB	Deuteronomy	34	9	Joshua , Nun ’ s son , was filled with wisdom because Moses had placed his hands on him . So the Israelites listened to Joshua , and they did exactly what the Lord commanded Moses .
CEB	Deuteronomy	34	10	No prophet like Moses has yet emerged in Israel ; Moses knew the Lord face-to-face !
CEB	Deuteronomy	34	11	That ’ s not even to mention all those signs and wonders that the Lord sent Moses to do in Egypt—to Pharaoh , to all his servants , and to his entire land—
CEB	Deuteronomy	34	12	as well as all the extraordinary power that Moses displayed before Israel ’ s own eyes !
CEB	Joshua	1	1	After Moses the Lord ’ s servant died , the Lord spoke to Joshua , Nun ’ s son . He had been Moses ’ helper .
CEB	Joshua	1	2	“ My servant Moses is dead . Now get ready to cross over the Jordan with this entire people to the land that I am going to give to the Israelites .
CEB	Joshua	1	3	I am giving you every place where you set foot , exactly as I promised Moses .
CEB	Joshua	1	4	Your territory will stretch from the desert and the Lebanon as far as the great Euphrates River , including all Hittite land , up to the Mediterranean Sea on the west .
CEB	Joshua	1	5	No one will be able to stand up against you during your lifetime . I will be with you in the same way I was with Moses . I won ’ t desert you or leave you .
CEB	Joshua	1	6	Be brave and strong , because you are the one who will help this people take possession of the land , which I pledged to give to their ancestors .
CEB	Joshua	1	7	“ Be very brave and strong as you carefully obey all of the Instruction that Moses my servant commanded you . Don ’ t deviate even a bit from it , either to the right or left . Then you will have success wherever you go .
CEB	Joshua	1	8	Never stop speaking about this Instruction scroll . Recite it day and night so you can carefully obey everything written in it . Then you will accomplish your objectives and you will succeed .
CEB	Joshua	1	9	I ’ ve commanded you to be brave and strong , haven ’ t I ? Don ’ t be alarmed or terrified , because the Lord your God is with you wherever you go. ” Joshua gives orders
CEB	Joshua	1	10	Then Joshua gave orders to the people ’ s officers :
CEB	Joshua	1	11	“ Go through the camp and give orders to the people . Say , ‘ Get supplies ready for yourselves because in three days you will be crossing over the Jordan to enter the land and take it over . The Lord your God is going to give it to you as your possession. ’ ”
CEB	Joshua	1	12	Then Joshua addressed the Reubenites , the Gadites , and half the tribe of Manasseh :
CEB	Joshua	1	13	“ Remember the command that Moses the Lord ’ s servant gave you : ‘ The Lord your God will give you rest and give you this land. ’
CEB	Joshua	1	14	Your wives , children , and cattle may remain in the land that Moses has given you on the east side of the Jordan . But all you brave fighters , organized for war , must cross over in front of your fellow Israelites . You must help them
CEB	Joshua	1	15	until the Lord gives a rest like yours to your fellow Israelites and they too take possession of the land that the Lord your God is giving them . Then you may return and take over the land that belongs to you , which Moses the Lord ’ s servant has given you on the east side of the Jordan. ”
CEB	Joshua	1	16	They answered Joshua , “ We will obey everything you have commanded us and go anywhere you send us .
CEB	Joshua	1	17	We will obey you in the same way that we obeyed Moses . Just let the Lord your God be with you as he was with Moses !
CEB	Joshua	1	18	Anybody who stubbornly opposes what you declare and doesn ’ t obey any of your commands will be put to death . Be brave and strong ! ”
CEB	Joshua	2	2	Someone told the king of Jericho , “ Men from the Israelites have come here tonight to spy on the land. ”
CEB	Joshua	2	3	So the king of Jericho sent word to Rahab : “ Send out the men who came to you , the ones who came to your house , because they have come to spy on the entire land. ” Rahab takes action
CEB	Joshua	2	4	But the woman had taken the two men and hidden them . Then she said , “ Of course the men came to me . But I didn ’ t know where they were from .
CEB	Joshua	2	5	The men left when it was time to close the gate at dark , but I don ’ t know where the men went . Hurry ! Chase after them ! You might catch up with them. ”
CEB	Joshua	2	6	But she had taken them up to the roof and hidden them under the flax stalks that she had laid out on the roof .
CEB	Joshua	2	7	The men from Jericho [ a ] chased after them in the direction of the Jordan up to the fords . As soon as those chasing them went out , the gate was shut behind them . Rahab sets terms
CEB	Joshua	2	8	Before the spies bedded down , Rahab went up to them on the roof .
CEB	Joshua	2	9	She said to the men , “ I know that the Lord has given you the land . Terror over you has overwhelmed us . The entire population of the land has melted down in fear because of you .
CEB	Joshua	2	10	We have heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Reed Sea [ b ] in front of you when you left Egypt . We have also heard what you did to Sihon and Og , the two kings of the Amorites on the other side of the Jordan . You utterly wiped them out .
CEB	Joshua	2	11	We heard this and our hearts turned to water . Because of you , people can no longer work up their courage . This is because the Lord your God is God in heaven above and on earth below .
CEB	Joshua	2	12	Now , I have been loyal to you . So pledge to me by the Lord that you in turn will deal loyally with my family . Give me a sign of good faith .
CEB	Joshua	2	13	Spare the lives of my father , mother , brothers , and sisters , along with everything they own . Rescue us from death. ”
CEB	Joshua	2	14	The men said to her , “ We swear by our own lives to secure yours . If you don ’ t reveal our mission , we will deal loyally and faithfully with you when the Lord gives us the land. ” The spies escape
CEB	Joshua	2	15	So she lowered the spies on a rope through the window . Her house was on the outer side of the city wall , and she lived inside the wall .
CEB	Joshua	2	16	Then she said to them , “ Go toward the highlands so that those chasing you don ’ t run into you . Hide there for three days until those chasing you return . Then you may go on your way. ”
CEB	Joshua	2	17	The men said to her , “ We won ’ t be responsible for this pledge you made us swear
CEB	Joshua	2	18	unless , when we come into the land , you tie this red woven cord in the window through which you lowered us . Gather your father , your mother , your brothers , and your whole family into the house with you .
CEB	Joshua	2	19	Those who go outside the doors of your house into the street will have only themselves to blame for their own deaths . We won ’ t be responsible . If anyone lays a hand on those who are with you in the house , we will take the blame for their death .
CEB	Joshua	2	20	But if you reveal our mission , we won ’ t be responsible for this pledge you made us swear. ”
CEB	Joshua	2	21	She said , “ These things will happen just like you said. ” She sent them away and they went off . Then she tied the red cord in the window . Mission accomplished
CEB	Joshua	2	22	The spies went out and entered the highlands . They stayed there for three days until those chasing them came back . Those chasing them had searched all along the road but never found them .
CEB	Joshua	2	23	Then the two men came back down from the highlands . They crossed the Jordan and came to Joshua , Nun ’ s son . They told him everything that had happened to them .
CEB	Joshua	2	24	They said to Joshua , “ The Lord has definitely given the entire land into our power . In addition , all of the land ’ s population has melted down in fear because of us. ” Footnotes - Joshua 2:7 Heb lacks from Jericho . - Joshua 2:10 Or Red Sea
CEB	Joshua	3	3	They commanded the people , “ As soon as you see the Lord your God ’ s chest containing the covenant and the levitical priests carrying it , you are to march out from your places and follow it .
CEB	Joshua	3	2	At the end of three days the officers went through the middle of the camp .
CEB	Joshua	3	4	But let there be some distance between you and it , about three thousand feet . Don ’ t come near it ! You will know the way you should go , even though you ’ ve never traveled this way before. ”
CEB	Joshua	3	5	Joshua said to the people , “ Make yourselves holy ! Tomorrow the Lord will do wonderful things among you. ”
CEB	Joshua	3	6	Then Joshua said to the priests , “ Lift up the covenant chest . Go along in front of the people. ” So they lifted up the covenant chest and went in front of the people .
CEB	Joshua	3	7	The Lord said to Joshua , “ Today I will begin to make you great in the opinion of all Israel . Then they will know that I will be with you in the same way that I was with Moses .
CEB	Joshua	3	8	You are to command the priests who carry the covenant chest , ‘ As soon as you come to the bank of the Jordan , stand still in the Jordan. ’ ”
CEB	Joshua	3	9	Joshua said to the Israelites , “ Come close . Listen to the words of the Lord your God. ”
CEB	Joshua	3	10	Then Joshua said , “ This is how you will know that the living God is among you and will completely remove the Canaanites , Hittites , Hivites , Perizzites , Girgashites , Amorites , and Jebusites before you .
CEB	Joshua	3	11	Look ! The covenant chest of the ruler of the entire earth is going to cross over in front of you in the Jordan .
CEB	Joshua	3	12	Now pick twelve men from the tribes of Israel , one per tribe .
CEB	Joshua	3	13	The soles of the priests ’ feet , who are carrying the chest of the Lord , ruler of the whole earth , will come to rest in the water of the Jordan . At that moment , the water of the Jordan will be cut off . The water flowing downstream will stand still in a single heap. ” Marching across the Jordan
CEB	Joshua	3	14	The people marched out from their tents to cross over the Jordan . The priests carrying the covenant chest were in front of the people .
CEB	Joshua	3	15	When the priests who were carrying the chest came to the Jordan , their feet touched the edge of the water . The Jordan had overflowed its banks completely , the way it does during the entire harvest season .
CEB	Joshua	3	16	But at that moment the water of the Jordan coming downstream stood still . It rose up as a single heap very far off , just below Adam , which is the city next to Zarethan . The water going down to the desert sea ( that is , the Dead Sea ) was cut off completely . The people crossed opposite Jericho .
CEB	Joshua	3	17	So the priests carrying the Lord ’ s covenant chest stood firmly on dry land in the middle of the Jordan . Meanwhile , all Israel crossed over on dry land , until the entire nation finished crossing over the Jordan .
CEB	Joshua	4	4	Joshua called for the twelve men he had appointed from the Israelites , one man per tribe .
CEB	Joshua	4	2	“ Pick twelve men from the people , one man per tribe .
CEB	Joshua	4	3	Command them , ‘ Pick up twelve stones from right here in the middle of the Jordan , where the feet of the priests had been firmly planted . Bring them across with you and put them down in the camp where you are staying tonight. ’ ”
CEB	Joshua	4	5	Joshua said to them , “ Cross over into the middle of the Jordan , up to the Lord your God ’ s chest . Each of you , lift up a stone on his shoulder to match the number of the tribes of the Israelites .
CEB	Joshua	4	6	This will be a symbol among you . In the future your children may ask , ‘ What do these stones mean to you ? ’
CEB	Joshua	4	7	Then you will tell them that the water of the Jordan was cut off before the Lord ’ s covenant chest . When it crossed over the Jordan , the water of the Jordan was cut off . These stones will be an enduring memorial for the Israelites. ”
CEB	Joshua	4	8	The Israelites did exactly what Joshua ordered . They lifted twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan , matching the number of the tribes of the Israelites , exactly as the Lord had said to Joshua . They brought them over to the camp and put them down there .
CEB	Joshua	4	9	Joshua also set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan where the feet of the priests had stood while carrying the covenant chest . They are still there today . Crossing completed
CEB	Joshua	4	10	Meanwhile , the priests carrying the chest were standing in the middle of the Jordan . They stood there until every command that the Lord had ordered Joshua to tell the people had been carried out . This was exactly what Moses had commanded Joshua . The people crossed over quickly .
CEB	Joshua	4	11	As soon as all the people had finished crossing , the Lord ’ s chest crossed over . The priests then moved to the front of the people .
CEB	Joshua	4	12	The people of Reuben , the people of Gad , and half the tribe of Manasseh crossed over , organized for war ahead of the Israelites , exactly as Moses had told them .
CEB	Joshua	4	13	Approximately forty thousand armed for war crossed over in the Lord ’ s presence to the plains of Jericho , ready for battle .
CEB	Joshua	4	14	The Lord made Joshua great in the opinion of all Israel on that day . So they revered him in the same way that they had revered Moses during all of his life .
CEB	Joshua	4	15	The Lord said to Joshua ,
CEB	Joshua	4	16	“ Command the priests carrying the chest containing the testimony to come up out of the Jordan. ”
CEB	Joshua	4	17	So Joshua commanded the priests , “ Come up from the Jordan. ”
CEB	Joshua	4	18	The priests carrying the Lord ’ s covenant chest came up from the middle of the Jordan , and the soles of their feet touched dry ground . At that moment , the water of the Jordan started flowing again . It ran as before , completely over its banks .
CEB	Joshua	4	19	The people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month . [ a ] They camped at Gilgal on the east border of Jericho . Stones at Gilgal
CEB	Joshua	4	20	Joshua set up at Gilgal those twelve stones they had taken from the Jordan .
CEB	Joshua	4	21	He said to the Israelites , “ In the future your children will ask their parents , ‘ What about these stones ? ’
CEB	Joshua	4	22	Then you will let your children know : ‘ Israel crossed over the Jordan here on dry ground. ’
CEB	Joshua	4	23	This was because the Lord your God dried up the water of the Jordan before you until you crossed over . This was exactly what the Lord your God did to the Reed Sea . [ b ] He dried it up before us until we crossed over .
CEB	Joshua	4	24	This happened so that all the earth ’ s peoples might know that the Lord ’ s power is great and that you may always revere the Lord your God. ” Footnotes - Joshua 4:19 March–April , Nisan - Joshua 4:23 Or Red Sea
CEB	Joshua	5	5	All the people who went out were circumcised . But none of the people born in the desert on the way after they had left Egypt had been circumcised .
CEB	Joshua	5	2	At that time the Lord said to Joshua , “ Make yourself flint knives . Circumcise the Israelites for a second time. ”
CEB	Joshua	5	3	So Joshua made flint knives for himself . He circumcised the Israelites at Foreskins Hill .
CEB	Joshua	5	4	This is the reason Joshua did so : All the people who went out of Egypt , that is , all the men who were soldiers , had died in the desert on the way after they left Egypt .
CEB	Joshua	5	6	This was because the Israelites journeyed forty years in the desert until the whole nation died off . These were the men old enough to fight who went out from Egypt and who hadn ’ t obeyed the Lord . The Lord had pledged to them never to show them the land that the Lord had pledged to their ancestors to give us . It is a land full of milk and honey .
CEB	Joshua	5	7	Joshua circumcised their children , the ones the Lord had set in their place . They were uncircumcised because they hadn ’ t been circumcised on the way .
CEB	Joshua	5	8	After the whole nation had undergone circumcision , they remained in the camp until they got well again .
CEB	Joshua	5	9	Then the Lord said to Joshua , “ Today I have rolled away from you the disgrace of Egypt. ” So the place was called Gilgal , [ a ] as it is today . Passover
CEB	Joshua	5	10	The Israelites camped in Gilgal . They celebrated Passover on the evening of the fourteenth day of the month [ b ] on the plains of Jericho .
CEB	Joshua	5	11	On the very next day after Passover , they ate food produced in the land : unleavened bread and roasted grain .
CEB	Joshua	5	12	The manna stopped on that next day , when they ate food produced in the land . There was no longer any manna for the Israelites . So that year they ate the crops of the land of Canaan . Commander of the Lord ’ s heavenly force
CEB	Joshua	5	13	When Joshua was near Jericho , he looked up . He caught sight of a man standing in front of him with his sword drawn . Joshua went up and said to him , “ Are you on our side or that of our enemies ? ”
CEB	Joshua	5	14	He said , “ Neither ! I ’ m the commander of the Lord ’ s heavenly force . Now I have arrived ! ” Then Joshua fell flat on his face and worshipped . Joshua said to him , “ What is my master saying to his servant ? ”
CEB	Joshua	5	15	The commander of the Lord ’ s heavenly force said to Joshua , “ Take your sandals off your feet because the place where you are standing is holy. ” So Joshua did this . Footnotes - Joshua 5:9 Gilgal sounds like the Heb verb galal , “ to roll away. ” - Joshua 5:10 March–April , Nisan
CEB	Joshua	6	6	So Joshua , Nun ’ s son , called the priests . He said to them , “ Lift up the covenant chest . Let seven priests carry seven trumpets made from rams ’ horns in front of the Lord ’ s chest. ”
CEB	Joshua	6	2	The Lord said to Joshua , “ Look . I have given Jericho and its king into your power , along with its mighty warriors .
CEB	Joshua	6	3	Circle the city with all the soldiers , going around the city one time . Do this for six days .
CEB	Joshua	6	4	Have seven priests carry seven trumpets made from rams ’ horns in front of the chest . On the seventh day , circle the city seven times , with the priests blowing the trumpets .
CEB	Joshua	6	5	“ Have them blow a long blast on the ram ’ s horn . As soon as you hear that trumpet blast , have all the people shout out a loud war cry . Then the city wall will collapse , and the people will rise up , attacking straight ahead. ” Israel destroys Jericho
CEB	Joshua	6	7	He said to the people , “ Go forward . Circle the city . Let the armed soldiers go in front of the Lord ’ s chest. ”
CEB	Joshua	6	8	As soon as Joshua had spoken to the people , the seven priests carrying seven ram ’ s horn trumpets moved forward in front of the Lord . They blew the trumpets . The Lord ’ s covenant chest followed .
CEB	Joshua	6	9	The initial group of soldiers was going in front of the priests who were blowing the trumpets . The rear guard was coming behind the chest , with trumpets blowing continuously .
CEB	Joshua	6	10	Joshua ordered the people , “ Don ’ t shout . Don ’ t let your voice be heard . Don ’ t let a word come out of your mouth until the day I tell you , ‘ Shout ! ’ Then shout ! ”
CEB	Joshua	6	11	He made the Lord ’ s chest circle the city , going around one time . They went back to the camp and stayed there overnight .
CEB	Joshua	6	12	Joshua got up early in the morning . The priests lifted up the Lord ’ s chest .
CEB	Joshua	6	13	The seven priests carrying the seven trumpets made from rams ’ horns were going in front of the Lord ’ s chest , blowing trumpets continuously . The armed soldiers were going in front of them . The rear guard was coming after the Lord ’ s chest , blowing trumpets continuously .
CEB	Joshua	6	14	They circled the city one time on the second day . Then they went back to the camp . They did this for six days .
CEB	Joshua	6	15	On the seventh day , they got up at dawn . They circled the city in this way seven times . It was only on that day that they circled the city seven times .
CEB	Joshua	6	16	The seventh time , the priests blew the trumpets . Then Joshua said to the people , “ Shout , because the Lord has given you the city !
CEB	Joshua	6	17	The city and everything in it is to be utterly wiped out as something reserved for the Lord . Only Rahab the prostitute is to stay alive , along with everyone with her in her house . This is because she hid the messengers we sent .
CEB	Joshua	6	18	But you , keep away from the things set aside for God so that you don ’ t desire [ a ] and take some of the things reserved . That would turn the camp of Israel into a thing doomed to be utterly wiped out and bring calamity on it .
CEB	Joshua	6	19	All silver and gold , along with bronze and iron equipment , are holy to the Lord . They must go into the Lord ’ s treasury. ”
CEB	Joshua	6	20	Then the people shouted . They blew the trumpets . As soon as the people heard the trumpet blast , they shouted a loud war cry . Then the wall collapsed . The people went up against the city , attacking straight ahead . They captured the city .
CEB	Joshua	6	21	Without mercy , they wiped out everything in the city as something reserved for God—man and woman , young and old , cattle , sheep , and donkeys . Consequences
CEB	Joshua	6	22	Joshua spoke to the two men who had scouted out the land . “ Go to the prostitute ’ s house . Bring out the woman from there , along with everyone related to her , exactly as you pledged to her. ”
CEB	Joshua	6	23	So the young men who had been spies went and brought Rahab out , along with her father , her mother , her brothers , and everyone related to her . They brought her whole clan out and let them stay outside Israel ’ s camp .
CEB	Joshua	6	24	They burned the city and everything in it . But they put the silver and gold , along with the bronze and iron equipment , into the treasury of the Lord ’ s house .
CEB	Joshua	6	25	Joshua let Rahab the prostitute live , her family , and everyone related to her . So her family still lives among Israel today , because she hid the spies whom Joshua had sent to scout out Jericho .
CEB	Joshua	6	26	At that time Joshua made this decree : “ Anyone who starts to rebuild this city of Jericho will be cursed before the Lord . Laying its foundations will cost them their oldest child . Setting up its gates will cost them their youngest child. ”
CEB	Joshua	6	27	The Lord was with Joshua . News about him spread throughout the land . Footnotes - Joshua 6:18 LXX ; Heb wipe out as something reserved for God
CEB	Joshua	7	7	Then Joshua said , “ Oh no , Lord God ! Why did you ever bring this people across the Jordan ? Was it to hand us over to the power of the Amorites , to destroy us ? If only we had been prepared to live on the other side of the Jordan !
CEB	Joshua	7	2	Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai , which is near Beth-aven to the east of Bethel . He said to them , “ Go up . Scout out the land. ” So the men went up and scouted out Ai .
CEB	Joshua	7	3	They came back to Joshua and said to him , “ There is no need for all of the people to go up . Two or three thousand men could go up and strike Ai . Don ’ t make all of the people bother going there . There are just a few of them. ”
CEB	Joshua	7	4	So about three thousand men from the people went up in that direction . But they fled from the men of Ai .
CEB	Joshua	7	5	The men of Ai struck down approximately thirty-six of them . They chased them from outside the gate as far as Shebarim . They struck them down on the slope . Then the hearts of the people melted and turned to water . Cause of Israel ’ s defeat
CEB	Joshua	7	6	Joshua ripped open his clothes . He , along with the elders of Israel , lay flat on their faces before the Lord ’ s chest until evening . They put dust on their heads .
CEB	Joshua	7	8	Please forgive me , Lord . What can I say now that Israel has retreated before its enemies ?
CEB	Joshua	7	9	The Canaanites and the whole population of the land will hear of it . They will surround us and make our name disappear from the earth . What will you do about your great name then ? ”
CEB	Joshua	7	10	The Lord said to Joshua , “ Get up ! Why do you lie flat on your face like this ?
CEB	Joshua	7	11	Israel has sinned . They have violated my covenant , which I commanded them to keep . They have taken some of the things reserved for me and put them with their own things . They have stolen and kept it a secret .
CEB	Joshua	7	12	The Israelites can ’ t stand up to their enemies . They retreat before their enemies because they themselves have become a doomed thing reserved for me . I will no longer be with you unless you destroy the things reserved for me that are present among you .
CEB	Joshua	7	13	Go and make the people holy . Say , ‘ Get ready for tomorrow by making yourselves holy . This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says : “ Israel ! Things reserved for me are present among you . You won ’ t be able to stand up to your enemies until you remove from your presence the things reserved for me. ” ’
CEB	Joshua	7	14	In the morning , come forward tribe by tribe . Whichever tribe the Lord selects must come forward clan by clan . Whichever clan the Lord selects must come forward family by family . Whichever family the Lord selects will come forward by individual soldiers .
CEB	Joshua	7	15	The person selected , who has the things reserved for God , must be put to death by burning . Burn everything that belongs to him too . This is because he has violated the Lord ’ s covenant and has committed an outrage in Israel. ” Achan discovered and punished
CEB	Joshua	7	16	Joshua got up early in the morning . He made Israel come forward tribe by tribe . The tribe of Judah was selected .
CEB	Joshua	7	17	He made the clans of Judah come forward . He selected the clan of Zerah . He made the clan of Zerah come forward as individual soldiers . Zabdi was selected .
CEB	Joshua	7	18	He made each soldier of his family come forward . Achan was selected . He was a son of Carmi , grandson of Zabdi , great-grandson of Zerah , and of the tribe of Judah .
CEB	Joshua	7	19	Joshua said to Achan , “ My son , give glory to the Lord the God of Israel . Tell me what you have done . Don ’ t hide anything from me. ”
CEB	Joshua	7	20	Achan answered Joshua , “ It ’ s true . I ’ ve sinned against the Lord , the God of Israel . This is what I have done :
CEB	Joshua	7	21	Among the booty I saw a single beautiful robe in the Babylonian style , two hundred shekels of silver , and a single gold bar weighing fifty shekels . I desired them and took them . Now they are hidden in the ground inside my tent , with the silver on the bottom. ”
CEB	Joshua	7	22	Then Joshua sent messengers . They ran to the tent . There it was , hidden in his tent , with the silver on the bottom .
CEB	Joshua	7	23	They took the things from inside the tent . They brought them to Joshua and to all the Israelites and emptied them out before the Lord .
CEB	Joshua	7	24	Then Joshua seized Achan , Zerah ’ s son , along with the silver , the robe , the gold bar , his sons and daughters , his cattle , donkeys , flocks , tent , and everything that belonged to him . All Israel joined Joshua . They brought them up to Achor Valley .
CEB	Joshua	7	25	Joshua said , “ You have brought disaster to us ! May the Lord bring disaster to you today ! ” Then all Israel stoned him . They burned them with fire and stoned them with stones .
CEB	Joshua	7	26	They raised over him a great pile of stones that is still there today . Then the Lord turned away from his fury . So he named that place Achor Valley . [ a ] It is still called that today . Footnotes - Joshua 7:26 Or Calamity Valley
CEB	Joshua	8	8	As soon as you seize the city , set it on fire . Act according to the Lord ’ s word . Indeed , I have given you an order ! ”
CEB	Joshua	8	2	Do to Ai and its king what you did to Jericho and its king . But you may take its booty and cattle as plunder . Set your ambush behind the city. ”
CEB	Joshua	8	3	So Joshua and the whole army got ready to go up to Ai . Joshua chose thirty thousand brave soldiers . He sent them out by night .
CEB	Joshua	8	4	He commanded them , “ Look . You are to ambush the city from behind . Don ’ t move too far away from the city . Be ready , all of you .
CEB	Joshua	8	5	I will approach the city with all the people . When they come out against us the same way as before , we will flee from them .
CEB	Joshua	8	6	They will come out after us until we have drawn them away from the city . They will think , They are fleeing from us as before . So we will flee from them .
CEB	Joshua	8	7	But you will rise up from the ambush and take over the city . The Lord your God will give it into your power .
CEB	Joshua	8	9	Joshua sent them off , and they went to set the ambush . They stayed between Bethel and Ai , to the west of Ai . Joshua spent that night among the people .
CEB	Joshua	8	10	Joshua got up early in the morning and mustered the people . Then he and the elders of Israel went up in front of the people to Ai .
CEB	Joshua	8	11	The entire army that was with him went up . They moved in close , in front of the city . Then they camped north of Ai , with the valley between them and Ai .
CEB	Joshua	8	12	He took about five thousand men and positioned them as an ambush between Bethel and Ai to the west of the city .
CEB	Joshua	8	13	The people positioned the main camp on the north side of the city and its rear guard on its west side . That night , Joshua went into the middle of the valley . Israel ’ s successful strategy
CEB	Joshua	8	14	As soon as the king of Ai saw this , he and all his troops , the men of the city , hurried out early in the morning to meet Israel in battle . They moved out to the battleground on the slopes down toward the Jordan . [ a ] He didn ’ t know that there was an ambush set against him behind the city .
CEB	Joshua	8	15	Then Joshua and all Israel let themselves be beaten before them . They fled in the direction of the desert .
CEB	Joshua	8	16	Next , all the troops who were still in the city were called out to chase them . They chased after Joshua and so let themselves be drawn away from the city .
CEB	Joshua	8	17	No one who hadn ’ t gone out after Israel was left in either Ai or Bethel . They left the city wide open and chased after Israel .
CEB	Joshua	8	18	The Lord said to Joshua , “ Point the dagger in your hand toward Ai , because I will give it into your power. ” So Joshua pointed the dagger in his hand toward the city .
CEB	Joshua	8	19	The ambush quickly rose from its place . As soon as he reached out his hand , it charged . They entered the city and captured it . They set the city on fire at once .
CEB	Joshua	8	20	Then the men of Ai turned around . They caught sight of the smoke of the city rising toward the sky . They had no chance to flee one way or the other . The troops who were fleeing toward the desert turned against the pursuit .
CEB	Joshua	8	21	Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had captured the city and that the smoke of the city was rising . So they turned and struck down the men of Ai .
CEB	Joshua	8	22	When other Israelites came out of the city to confront them , the men of Ai were caught in the middle . Some Israelites were on one side of them and some on the other . The Israelites struck them down until there was no one left to escape .
CEB	Joshua	8	23	But they seized the king of Ai alive and brought him to Joshua .
CEB	Joshua	8	24	Israel finished killing the entire population of Ai that had chased them out into the open wasteland . All of them were finished off without mercy . Then all Israel went back to Ai and struck it down without mercy .
CEB	Joshua	8	25	Twelve thousand men and women died that day , all the people of Ai .
CEB	Joshua	8	26	Joshua didn ’ t pull back the hand that was stretched out holding a dagger until he had wiped out the whole population of Ai as something reserved for God .
CEB	Joshua	8	27	However , Israel did take the cattle and other booty of that city as plunder for themselves , in agreement with the command that the Lord had given Joshua .
CEB	Joshua	8	28	Then Joshua burned Ai . He made it a permanently deserted mound . That is still the case today .
CEB	Joshua	8	29	He hanged the king of Ai on a tree until evening . At sundown , Joshua gave an order , and they took his body down from the tree . They threw it down at the opening of the city gate . Then they raised over it a great pile of stones that is still there today . Joshua reads the Instruction
CEB	Joshua	8	30	Then Joshua built an altar on Mount Ebal to the Lord , the God of Israel .
CEB	Joshua	8	31	This was exactly what Moses the Lord ’ s servant had commanded the Israelites . It is what is written in the Instruction scroll from Moses : “ an altar of crude stones against which no iron tool has swung. ” [ b ] On it they offered entirely burned offerings to the Lord and sacrificed well-being offerings .
CEB	Joshua	8	32	There , in the presence of the Israelites , Joshua wrote on the stones a copy of the Instruction from Moses , which Moses had written earlier .
CEB	Joshua	8	33	All Israel—with its elders , officers , and judges—were standing on either side of the chest . They were facing the levitical priests who carry the Lord ’ s chest containing the covenant . They included both immigrants and full citizens . Half stood facing Mount Gerizim and half stood facing Mount Ebal . This was exactly what Moses the Lord ’ s servant had initially commanded for the blessing of the Israelite people .
CEB	Joshua	8	34	Afterward , Joshua read aloud all the words of the Instruction , both blessing and curse , in agreement with everything written in the Instruction scroll .
CEB	Joshua	8	35	There wasn ’ t a single word of all that Moses had commanded that Joshua failed to read aloud in the presence of the entire assembly of Israel . This assembly included the women and small children , along with the immigrants who lived among them . Footnotes - Joshua 8:14 Or the Arabah - Joshua 8:31 Deut 27:5-6
CEB	Joshua	9	9	They said to him , “ Your servants have come from a very distant country because of the reputation of the Lord your God . We have heard a report about him and everything he did in Egypt .
CEB	Joshua	9	2	They formed an alliance to fight Joshua and Israel .
CEB	Joshua	9	3	In contrast , when the population of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai ,
CEB	Joshua	9	4	they acted cleverly . They set out pretending to be messengers . [ a ] They took worn-out sacks for their donkeys and worn-out wineskins that were split and mended .
CEB	Joshua	9	5	They had worn-out , patched sandals on their feet and were wearing worn-out clothes . All the bread in their supplies was dry and crumbly .
CEB	Joshua	9	6	They went to Joshua at the camp at Gilgal . They said to him and to Israel , “ We have come from a distant country . So now , make a treaty with us. ”
CEB	Joshua	9	7	Israel said to the Hivites , “ Perhaps you live among us . How then could we make a treaty with you ? ”
CEB	Joshua	9	8	Then they said to Joshua , “ We are your servants. ” Joshua said to them , “ Who are you ? Where have you come from ? ”
CEB	Joshua	9	10	We heard about everything he did to the two kings of the Amorites on the east side of the Jordan , Heshbon ’ s King Sihon and Bashan ’ s King Og , who was in Ashtaroth .
CEB	Joshua	9	11	Our elders and all the population of our land said to us , ‘ Take along supplies for the journey . Go meet them and say to them , “ We are your servants . So now make a treaty with us. ” ’
CEB	Joshua	9	12	This is our bread . On the day we left to come to you we took it warm from our houses as supplies . But now here it is , dried up and crumbly .
CEB	Joshua	9	13	These wineskins were new when we filled them . But here they are , split open . These clothes and sandals of ours are worn out from the very long journey. ”
CEB	Joshua	9	14	The Israelites [ b ] took some of their supplies , but they didn ’ t ask for any decision from the Lord .
CEB	Joshua	9	15	Joshua made peace with them . He made a treaty with them to protect their lives . The leaders of the community made a solemn pledge to them . Israel discovers the trick
CEB	Joshua	9	16	Three days after the Israelites made a treaty with the Gibeonites , the Israelites heard that they were actually their neighbors and were living among them .
CEB	Joshua	9	17	So on the third day the Israelites marched out and came to their cities : Gibeon , Chephirah , Beeroth , and Kiriath-jearim .
CEB	Joshua	9	18	But the Israelites didn ’ t strike at them . This was because the leaders of the community had made a solemn pledge to them by the Lord , the God of Israel . The entire community grumbled against the leaders .
CEB	Joshua	9	19	Then all the leaders said to the whole community , “ We have made a solemn pledge to them by the Lord , the God of Israel . So we can ’ t touch them now .
CEB	Joshua	9	20	This is what we ’ ll do with them . We ’ ll let them live so that wrath won ’ t come down on us because of the solemn pledge that we made to them. ”
CEB	Joshua	9	21	The leaders went on to say to them , “ Let them live. ” So they became woodcutters and water haulers for the whole community , exactly as the leaders had intended for them .
CEB	Joshua	9	22	Joshua called for the Gibeonites and spoke to them : “ Why have you deceived us by saying , ‘ We live very far away from you , ’ when actually you live among us ?
CEB	Joshua	9	23	So now you are cursed . Some of you will always serve as woodcutters and water haulers for my God ’ s house. ”
CEB	Joshua	9	24	They answered Joshua , “ Your servants had been told that the Lord your God had commanded his servant Moses to give you the entire land and to wipe out all its population on your account . So we feared for our very lives because of you and did this thing .
CEB	Joshua	9	25	Now , here we are in your power . Do to us whatever seems good and proper to you. ”
CEB	Joshua	9	26	So Joshua treated them in this way . He spared them from the power of the Israelites , and they didn ’ t kill them .
CEB	Joshua	9	27	That day Joshua assigned them as woodcutters and water haulers for the community and for the Lord ’ s altar , located wherever God [ c ] would choose . That is still the case today . Footnotes - Joshua 9:4 Heb uncertain - Joshua 9:14 Or men - Joshua 9:27 Or he
CEB	Joshua	10	10	Then the Lord threw them into a panic before Israel . Joshua struck a mighty blow against them at Gibeon . He chased them on the way up to Beth-horon and struck them down as far as Azekah and Makkedah .
CEB	Joshua	10	2	Adoni-zedek and his people [ a ] were very afraid , because Gibeon was a large city , like one of the royal cities . It was larger than Ai . All its men were soldiers .
CEB	Joshua	10	3	So Jerusalem ’ s King Adoni-zedek sent word to Hebron ’ s King Hoham , Jarmuth ’ s King Piram , Lachish ’ s King Japhia , and Eglon ’ s King Debir :
CEB	Joshua	10	4	“ Come up and help me . We will strike at Gibeon , because it has made peace with Joshua and with the Israelites. ”
CEB	Joshua	10	5	Then the five kings of the Amorites gathered . These were the kings of Jerusalem , Hebron , Jarmuth , Lachish , and Eglon . They went up with all their armies , camped against Gibeon , and attacked it .
CEB	Joshua	10	6	The people of Gibeon sent word to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal : “ Don ’ t desert your servants ! Come to us quickly . Rescue us ! Help us ! All the Amorite kings from the highlands have assembled together against us. ”
CEB	Joshua	10	7	So Joshua went up from Gilgal with the entire army and all the bravest soldiers . The Lord fights for Israel
CEB	Joshua	10	8	Then the Lord said to Joshua , “ Don ’ t be afraid of them . I have given them into your power . Not a single one of them can stand up against you. ”
CEB	Joshua	10	9	Joshua quickly attacked them , having come up overnight from Gilgal .
CEB	Joshua	10	11	When they were fleeing from Israel and were on the slope of Beth-horon , the Lord threw down large stones from the sky all the way to Azekah . So they died . More died from the hailstones than the Israelites killed with the sword .
CEB	Joshua	10	12	On the day the Lord gave the Amorites into the power of Israel , Joshua spoke to the Lord in the presence of the Israelites : “ Sun , stand still at Gibeon ! and Moon , at the Aijalon Valley ! ”
CEB	Joshua	10	13	The sun stood still and the moon stood motionless until a nation took revenge on its enemies . Isn ’ t this written in the Jashar scroll ? So the sun stood motionless in the middle of the sky . For a whole day , it was in no hurry to go down .
CEB	Joshua	10	14	There hasn ’ t been a day like it before or since , when the Lord responded to a human voice . The Lord fought for Israel .
CEB	Joshua	10	15	Then Joshua along with all Israel came back to the camp at Gilgal . Israel executes five kings
CEB	Joshua	10	16	Then those five kings fled and hid in the cave at Makkedah .
CEB	Joshua	10	17	It was reported to Joshua , “ The five kings have been found , hidden in the cave at Makkedah. ”
CEB	Joshua	10	18	Joshua said , “ Roll large stones over the mouth of the cave . Station some men by it to guard them ,
CEB	Joshua	10	19	but don ’ t you stay there . Chase after your enemies and attack them from the rear . Don ’ t let them enter their cities , because the Lord your God has given them into your power. ”
CEB	Joshua	10	20	Joshua and the Israelites finished dealing them a stunning blow until they were finished off . Some survivors among them escaped into the fortified cities .
CEB	Joshua	10	21	Then the whole people came back safely to Joshua in the camp at Makkedah . Not a single person threatened the Israelites .
CEB	Joshua	10	22	Joshua said , “ Open up the mouth of the cave . Bring those five kings out of the cave to me. ”
CEB	Joshua	10	23	They did so . They brought the five kings out of the cave to him : the kings of Jerusalem , Hebron , Jarmuth , Lachish , and Eglon .
CEB	Joshua	10	24	When they brought these kings out to Joshua , Joshua called for every Israelite . He said to the military commanders who had gone out with him , “ Come forward . Put your feet on the necks of these kings. ” So they went forward and put their feet on their necks .
CEB	Joshua	10	25	Then Joshua said to them , “ Don ’ t be afraid or terrified . Be brave and strong , because this is how the Lord will deal with all the enemies you fight. ”
CEB	Joshua	10	26	Next , Joshua struck them down . He put them to death and then hanged them on five trees . They were hanging on the trees until evening .
CEB	Joshua	10	27	At sundown , Joshua gave an order , and they took them down from the trees . They threw them into the cave where they had hidden themselves , and they set large stones over the mouth of the cave . The stones are still there to this very day . Victories in the south
CEB	Joshua	10	28	On that day , Joshua captured Makkedah . With a sword , he struck it and its king without mercy . He wiped them out , treating everyone in the city as something reserved for God . He left no survivors . He did to the king of Makkedah exactly as he had done to the king of Jericho .
CEB	Joshua	10	29	Then Joshua along with all Israel moved on from Makkedah to Libnah . They attacked Libnah .
CEB	Joshua	10	30	The Lord also gave it and its king into the power of Israel . With a sword , he struck it and everyone in it without mercy . He left no survivors in it . He did to its king exactly as he had done to the king of Jericho .
CEB	Joshua	10	31	Joshua along with all Israel moved on from Libnah to Lachish . They camped near it and attacked it .
CEB	Joshua	10	32	The Lord gave Lachish into the power of Israel . Joshua captured it on the second day . With a sword , he struck it and everyone in it without mercy , just exactly as he had done to Libnah .
CEB	Joshua	10	33	Then Gezer ’ s King Horam came up to help Lachish . But Joshua struck him and his people down , until no survivors were left .
CEB	Joshua	10	34	Joshua along with all Israel moved on from Lachish to Eglon . They camped against it and attacked it .
CEB	Joshua	10	35	They captured it on the same day and struck it down without mercy . On that day , he wiped out everyone in it as something reserved for God , just exactly as he had done to Lachish .
CEB	Joshua	10	36	Joshua along with all Israel went up from Eglon to Hebron and attacked it .
CEB	Joshua	10	37	They captured it and struck it down without mercy , along with its king , all its towns , and everyone in it . He left no survivors , just exactly as he had done to Eglon . He wiped out the city and everyone in it as something reserved for God .
CEB	Joshua	10	38	Joshua along with all Israel turned back to Debir and attacked it .
CEB	Joshua	10	39	He captured it along with its king and all its cities . They struck them down without mercy and wiped out everyone in it as something reserved for God . He left no survivors . Exactly as he had done to Hebron , so he did to Debir and its king—exactly as he had done to Libnah and its king .
CEB	Joshua	10	40	So Joshua struck at the whole land : the highlands , the arid southern plains , the lowlands , the slopes , and all their kings . He left no survivors . He wiped out everything that breathed as something reserved for God , exactly as the Lord , the God of Israel , had commanded .
CEB	Joshua	10	41	Joshua struck them down from Kadesh-barnea to Gaza , and the whole land of Goshen as far as Gibeon .
CEB	Joshua	10	42	Joshua captured all these kings and their land all at the same time . This was because the Lord , the God of Israel , fought for Israel .
CEB	Joshua	10	43	Then Joshua along with all Israel came back to the camp at Gilgal . Footnotes - Joshua 10:2 Or they
CEB	Joshua	11	11	They struck down everyone there without mercy , wiping them out as something reserved for God . Nothing that breathed was left . Hazor itself he burned .
CEB	Joshua	11	2	He sent word to the kings from the north part of the highlands , in the desert plain south of Chinneroth , in the lowlands , and in Naphoth-dor on the west .
CEB	Joshua	11	3	He sent word to the Canaanites from east and west , to the Amorites , Hittites , Perizzites , and Jebusites in the highlands , and to the Hivites at the foot of Hermon in the land of Mizpah .
CEB	Joshua	11	4	They went out with all their battalions as a great army . They were as numerous as the grains of sand on the seashore . There were very many horses and chariots .
CEB	Joshua	11	5	All these kings came together . They came and camped together at the waters of Merom to fight against Israel .
CEB	Joshua	11	6	The Lord said to Joshua , “ Don ’ t be afraid of them . By this time tomorrow , I will make them all dead bodies in Israel ’ s presence . Cripple their horses ! Burn their chariots ! ”
CEB	Joshua	11	7	Then Joshua along with the entire army launched a surprise attack against them at the waters of Merom .
CEB	Joshua	11	8	The Lord gave them into Israel ’ s power . They struck them down . They chased them as far as Great Sidon and Misrephoth-maim , then to the east as far as the Mizpeh Valley . They struck them down until no survivors were left .
CEB	Joshua	11	9	Joshua dealt with them exactly as the Lord had told him . He crippled their horses and burned their chariots .
CEB	Joshua	11	10	Joshua turned back at that time . He captured Hazor and struck down its king with the sword . Hazor had been the head of all those kingdoms in the past .
CEB	Joshua	11	12	Joshua captured all these kings and their cities . He struck them down without mercy . He wiped them out as something reserved for God . This was exactly as Moses the Lord ’ s servant had commanded .
CEB	Joshua	11	13	But Israel didn ’ t burn any of the cities that still are standing on their mounds . Joshua burned only Hazor .
CEB	Joshua	11	14	The Israelites took all the valuable things from those cities and the cattle as plunder for themselves . But they struck down every person without mercy until they had wiped them out . They didn ’ t let anything that breathed survive .
CEB	Joshua	11	15	What the Lord had commanded Moses his servant , Moses had commanded Joshua , and Joshua did exactly that . He didn ’ t deviate a bit from any command that the Lord had given Moses . Summary of Israel ’ s victories
CEB	Joshua	11	16	So Joshua took this whole land : the highlands , the whole arid southern plain , the whole land of Goshen , the lowlands , the desert plain , and both the highlands and the lowlands of Israel .
CEB	Joshua	11	17	He took land stretching from Mount Halak , which goes up toward Seir , as far as Baal-gad at the foot of Mount Hermon in the Lebanon Valley . He captured all their kings . He struck them down and killed them .
CEB	Joshua	11	18	Joshua waged war against all these kings for a long time .
CEB	Joshua	11	19	There wasn ’ t one city that made peace with the Israelites , except the Hivites who lived in Gibeon . They captured every single one in battle .
CEB	Joshua	11	20	Their stubborn resistance came from the Lord and led them to wage war against Israel . Israel was then able to wipe them out as something reserved for God , without showing them any mercy . This was exactly what the Lord had commanded Moses .
CEB	Joshua	11	21	At that time , Joshua went and wiped out the Anakim from the highlands . He wiped them out from Hebron , from Debir , and from Anab , from the whole highlands of Judah , and the whole highlands of Israel . Joshua wiped them out along with their cities as something reserved for God .
CEB	Joshua	11	22	The Anakim no longer remained in the land of the Israelites . They survived only in Gaza , Gath , and Ashdod .
CEB	Joshua	11	23	So Joshua took the whole land , exactly as the Lord had promised Moses . Joshua gave it as a legacy to Israel according to their tribal shares . Then the land had a rest from war .
CEB	Joshua	12	12	The Israelites struck down these kings of the land and took over their land on the east side of the Jordan . This ran from the Arnon Valley as far as Mount Hermon and included the whole eastern part of the desert plain .
CEB	Joshua	12	2	First there was the Amorites ’ King Sihon , who lived in Heshbon . He ruled from Aroer by the rim of Arnon Valley and then from the middle of the valley as far as the Jabbok Valley , the border of the Ammonites . This was half of Gilead .
CEB	Joshua	12	3	He ruled the desert plain up to the east side of the Chinneroth Sea . This ran southward in the direction of Beth-jeshimoth at the foot of the Pisgah slopes as far as the east side of the desert plain ( that is , the Dead Sea ) and
CEB	Joshua	12	4	the territory next to it . [ a ] Then there was Bashan ’ s King Og . He was one of the last of the Rephaim . He lived in Ashtaroth and Edrei .
CEB	Joshua	12	5	He ruled over Mount Hermon , Salecah , and all of Bashan as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites , and half of Gilead down to the border of Heshbon ’ s King Sihon .
CEB	Joshua	12	6	Moses the Lord ’ s servant and the Israelites struck them down . Moses the Lord ’ s servant gave their land as property to the Reubenites , Gadites , and half the tribe of Manasseh . Kings west of the Jordan
CEB	Joshua	12	7	Joshua and the Israelites struck down these kings of the land and took over their land on the west side of the Jordan . This ran from Baal-gad in the Lebanon Valley as far as Mount Halak , which goes up toward Seir . Joshua gave it to the tribes of Israel as shares of property .

CEB	Joshua	13	7	So now divide up this land as a legacy for the nine tribes and half the tribe of Manasseh . You will give it out from the Jordan to the Mediterranean Sea in the west . The Mediterranean Sea is the border . [ a ] ” Land east of the Jordan
CEB	Joshua	13	8	As for the other half of the tribe of Manasseh , [ b ] the Reubenites and Gadites together with it had already taken their legacy that Moses had given them on the east side of the Jordan . It was exactly what Moses the Lord ’ s servant had given them .

CEB	Joshua	13	14	It was only to the tribe of Levi that he gave no legacy . Their legacy consists of the fire offerings for the Lord , the God of Israel , exactly as he had promised them . For Reuben
CEB	Joshua	13	15	Moses provided for the clans of the Reubenite tribe .
CEB	Joshua	13	16	Their territory ran from Aroer by the rim of the Arnon Valley and the city in the middle of the ravine , and the whole plateau as far as Medeba .

CEB	Joshua	13	22	In addition to those others slain , the Israelites killed the fortune-teller Balaam , Beor ’ s son , with the sword .
CEB	Joshua	13	23	The border of the people of Reuben was the Jordan and the territory next to it . This was the legacy of the people of Reuben—for their clans , their cities , and their settlements . For Gad
CEB	Joshua	13	24	Moses provided for the clans of the Gadite tribe .
CEB	Joshua	13	25	Their territory was Jazer , all the cities of Gilead , and half the land of the Ammonites as far as Aroer near Rabbah .
CEB	Joshua	13	26	It also ran from Heshbon as far as Ramath-mizpeh and Betonim , and from Mahanaim as far as the territory of Lidebir .

CEB	Joshua	13	31	Half of Gilead along with Ashtaroth and Edrei , cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan , belonged to the people of Machir son of Manasseh . It belonged to the clans for half of the people of Machir .
CEB	Joshua	13	32	Moses assigned these territories when he was in the Moab plains on the other side of the Jordan , east of Jericho .
CEB	Joshua	13	33	But Moses gave no legacy to the tribe of Levi . The Lord God of Israel is their legacy , exactly as he promised them . Footnotes - Joshua 13:7 LXX ; MT lacks You will give it out from the Jordan to the Mediterranean Sea in the west . The Mediterranean Sea is the border . - Joshua 13:8 LXX ; MT lacks As for the other half of the tribe of Manasseh .
CEB	Joshua	14	14	So Hebron still belongs to Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite as a legacy today . This was because he remained loyal to the Lord God of Israel .
CEB	Joshua	14	2	Their legacy was assigned by lot , exactly as the Lord had commanded the nine and a half tribes through Moses .
CEB	Joshua	14	3	In fact , Moses had given out the legacy of the two and a half tribes on the other side of the Jordan . But he gave no legacy among them to the Levites .
CEB	Joshua	14	4	The people of Joseph consisted of two tribes , Manasseh and Ephraim . The Levites weren ’ t given any portion of the land , except cities to live in and pastureland for their cattle and flocks .
CEB	Joshua	14	5	The Israelites divided up the land exactly as the Lord had commanded Moses . Caleb receives Hebron
CEB	Joshua	14	6	In Gilgal , the people of Judah approached Joshua . Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him , “ You know what the Lord said to Moses , man of God , about you and me when we were in Kadesh-barnea .
CEB	Joshua	14	7	I was
CEB	Joshua	14	40	years old when Moses the Lord ’ s servant sent me from Kadesh-barnea to scout out the land . I brought back a report to him of what I really thought .
CEB	Joshua	14	8	My companions who had gone up with me made the people ’ s heart melt . But I remained loyal to the Lord my God .
CEB	Joshua	14	9	So Moses pledged on that day , ‘ The land on which you have walked will forever be a legacy for you and your children . This is because you remained loyal to the Lord my God. ’
CEB	Joshua	14	10	Now look . The Lord has kept me alive , exactly as he promised . It is forty-five years since the Lord spoke about this to Moses . It was while Israel was journeying in the desert . Now look . Today I ’ m
CEB	Joshua	14	85	years old .
CEB	Joshua	14	11	I ’ m just as strong today as I was the day Moses sent me out . My strength then was as my strength is now , whether for war or for everyday activities .
CEB	Joshua	14	12	So now , give me this highland that the Lord promised me that day . True , the Anakim are there with large fortified cities , as you yourself heard that day . But if the Lord is with me , I should be able to remove them , exactly as the Lord promised. ”
CEB	Joshua	14	13	So Joshua blessed him . He gave Hebron to Caleb , Jephunneh ’ s son , as a legacy .
CEB	Joshua	14	15	( Hebron used to be called Kiriath-arba . Arba had been the greatest of the Anakim . ) Then the land rested from war .
CEB	Joshua	15	15	Then he went up from there against the population of Debir . Debir used to be called Kiriath-sepher .
CEB	Joshua	15	2	Their south border ran from the end of the Dead Sea , from the bay that faces south .

CEB	Joshua	15	8	The border went up by the valley of Ben-Hinnom to the slope of the Jebusite city , Jerusalem , on the south . The border went up to the top of the mountain that is opposite the Hinnom Valley on the west , which is at the north end of the Rephaim Valley .

CEB	Joshua	15	13	In agreement with the Lord ’ s command to him , Joshua gave a portion among the Judahites to Caleb , Jephunneh ’ s son . It was Kiriath-arba , that is , Hebron ( Arba was the father of Anak ) .
CEB	Joshua	15	14	Caleb removed the three sons of Anak from there : Sheshai , Ahiman , and Talmai . They were the offspring of Anak .
CEB	Joshua	15	16	Caleb said , “ I will give Achsah my daughter in marriage to whoever strikes Kiriath-sepher and captures it. ”
CEB	Joshua	15	17	So Othniel son of Kenaz , Caleb ’ s brother , captured it , and Caleb gave him Achsah his daughter in marriage .
CEB	Joshua	15	18	Now when she arrived , she prodded Othniel into asking for a field from her father . After she got down off her donkey , Caleb asked her , “ What do you want ? ”
CEB	Joshua	15	19	She said , “ Give me a blessing . Since the land you ’ ve given me is in the arid southern plain , you should also give me springs of water. ” So he gave her the upper springs and the lower springs . Cities of Judah
CEB	Joshua	15	20	This is the legacy for the clans of the tribe of the people of Judah .

CEB	Joshua	16	16	The land determined by lot for the people of Joseph went out from the Jordan near Jericho eastward to the waters of Jericho . It went up by the desert from Jericho to the Bethel highlands .
CEB	Joshua	16	2	It goes from Bethel to Luz and passes on to the border of the Archites at Ataroth .
CEB	Joshua	16	3	It goes down westward to the border of the Japhletites as far as the border of Lower Beth-horon and as far as Gezer . It ends at the sea .
CEB	Joshua	16	4	The people of Joseph , Manasseh and Ephraim , received their legacy .
CEB	Joshua	16	5	This was the territory for the clans of the people of Ephraim . The border of their legacy ran from Ataroth-adar on the east as far as Upper Beth-horon .
CEB	Joshua	16	6	The border goes to the sea . Michmethath is on the north . The border turns east of Taanath-shiloh and passes along beyond it east of Janoah .
CEB	Joshua	16	7	It goes down from Janoah to Ataroth and to Naarah , touches Jericho , and goes to the Jordan .
CEB	Joshua	16	8	From Tappuah the border goes westward by the Kanah Valley . It ends at the sea . This is the legacy for the clans of the Ephraimite tribe .
CEB	Joshua	16	9	It included cities set apart for the people of Ephraim within the legacy of the people of Manasseh , all the cities and their surrounding areas .
CEB	Joshua	16	10	But they didn ’ t remove the Canaanites who lived in Gezer . So today the Canaanites , who were used for forced labor , still live within Ephraim .
CEB	Joshua	17	17	Joshua then said to the house of Joseph , to Ephraim and to Manasseh , “ You are a numerous people and possess great strength . You will have more than a single lot .
CEB	Joshua	17	2	So an allotment took place for the rest of the clans of the people of Manasseh—for the people of Abiezer , Helek , Asriel , Shechem , Hepher , and Shemida . These were the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph , the male descendants by their clans .
CEB	Joshua	17	3	Zelophehad was Hepher ’ s son , Gilead ’ s grandson , Machir ’ s great-grandson and Manasseh ’ s great-great-grandson . Zelophehad had no sons , only daughters , who were named Mahlah , Noah , Hoglah , Milcah , and Tirzah .
CEB	Joshua	17	4	The daughters approached Eleazar the priest , Joshua , Nun ’ s son , and the leaders . They said , “ The Lord commanded Moses to give us a legacy along with our male relatives. ” So in agreement with the Lord ’ s command , they were given a legacy along with their uncles .
CEB	Joshua	17	5	Manasseh had ten parcels in addition to the land of Gilead and Bashan on the other side of the Jordan .
CEB	Joshua	17	6	This was because the daughters of Manasseh received a legacy along with his sons . The land of Gilead belonged to the rest of the people of Manasseh .
CEB	Joshua	17	7	The border of Manasseh ran from Asher to Michmethath , which is opposite Shechem . The border went south to the population of En-tappuah .
CEB	Joshua	17	8	The land of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh . But Tappuah itself belonged to the people of Ephraim , even though it was on the border of Manasseh .
CEB	Joshua	17	9	The border went down by the Kanah Valley . South of the ravine are those cities that belong to Ephraim , even though they are located among the cities of Manasseh . The border of Manasseh lay on the north side of the ravine and ended at the sea .
CEB	Joshua	17	10	What lay south of the border belonged to Ephraim , and what lay north of it belonged to Manasseh . The sea was its border . The territory bordered Asher on the north and Issachar on the east .
CEB	Joshua	17	11	Belonging to Manasseh in Issachar and in Asher were Beth-shean and its dependent cities , Ibleam and its dependent cities , the population of Dor and its dependent cities , the population of En-dor and its dependent cities , the population of Taanach and its dependent cities , and the population of Megiddo and its dependent cities . ( The third one is Naphath . ) [ a ]
CEB	Joshua	17	12	The people of Manasseh couldn ’ t take over these cities , and the Canaanites were determined to live in this land .
CEB	Joshua	17	13	When the Israelites grew strong , they subjected the Canaanites to hard labor but didn ’ t remove them . Future expansion for Joseph
CEB	Joshua	17	14	The tribe of Joseph spoke to Joshua : “ Why have you only given us a single lot and a solitary parcel for a legacy ? We are a numerous people whom the Lord has blessed so richly. ”
CEB	Joshua	17	15	Then Joshua said , “ Yes , you are a numerous people . So go up to the forest and clear ground for yourselves there in the land of the Perizzites and Rephaim , because the Ephraimite highland is too small for you. ”
CEB	Joshua	17	16	The people of Joseph said , “ The highland isn ’ t enough for us . But all the Canaanites who live in the valley region have iron chariots , both those in Beth-shean and its dependent cities and those in the Jezreel Valley. ”
CEB	Joshua	17	18	The highland will belong to you . Because it is a forest , you can clear it . Its farthest limits will be yours . You will definitely remove the Canaanites , even though they have iron chariots and are strong. ” Footnotes - Joshua 17:11 Heb uncertain
CEB	Joshua	18	18	It passed on to the slope of Beth-arabah [ a ] on the north and went down into the desert plain .
CEB	Joshua	18	2	Among the Israelites , seven tribes were left that had not yet received their legacy .
CEB	Joshua	18	3	Joshua said to the Israelites , “ How long will you avoid going to take over the land that the Lord , the God of your ancestors , has given you ?
CEB	Joshua	18	4	Pick out three men for each tribe . I will send them out , and they will go up and travel throughout the land . They will write a description of it as the basis for determining their legacy . Then they will come back to me .
CEB	Joshua	18	5	They will divide up the land among themselves into seven portions . Judah will stay on its territory to the south . The house of Joseph will stay on their territory to the north .
CEB	Joshua	18	6	But you will write a report in seven parts and bring the report back here to me . Then I will cast the lot for you here , before the Lord our God .
CEB	Joshua	18	7	However , there won ’ t be a portion among you for the Levites because their legacy is the priesthood of the Lord . Gad , Reuben , and half the tribe of Manasseh have already received their legacy on the east side of the Jordan . Moses the Lord ’ s servant gave it to them. ”
CEB	Joshua	18	8	When the men had prepared to go , Joshua gave orders to those going to write a description of the land . “ Go and travel around the land , write about it , and return to me . I will cast the lot for you before the Lord here in Shiloh. ”
CEB	Joshua	18	9	So the men went and passed through the land and wrote about it in a document , city by city , in seven sections . They came back to Joshua in the camp at Shiloh .
CEB	Joshua	18	10	Then Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the Lord . There Joshua divided up the shares of the land for the Israelites . Border of Benjamin
CEB	Joshua	18	11	The lot for the clans of the Benjaminite tribe appeared first . The border of their allotment went out between the people of Judah and the people of Joseph .
CEB	Joshua	18	12	Their border on the north side ran from the Jordan . The border went up to the slope of Jericho on the north . It went up westward in the highlands and ended at the wasteland of Beth-aven .
CEB	Joshua	18	13	The border passed on from there to Luz , to the slope of Luz on the south ( that is , Bethel ) . The border went down to Ataroth-adar on the mountain that is south of Lower Beth-horon .
CEB	Joshua	18	14	The border turned and came around southward on the west side , running from the mountain that is opposite Beth-horon on the south . It ended at Kiriath-baal ( that is , Kiriath-jearim ) , a city of the people of Judah . This was its west side .
CEB	Joshua	18	15	The south side ran from the limits of Kiriath-jearim . The border went out westward . It then proceeded to the waters of Nephtoah Spring .
CEB	Joshua	18	16	The border went down to the foot of the mountain that is opposite the valley of the son of Hinnom , which is in the north part of the Rephaim Valley . It went down through the Hinnom Valley to the slope of the Jebusite city on the south . It then went down to En-rogel .
CEB	Joshua	18	17	It turned northward . Then it went to En-shemesh and then to Geliloth , which is opposite the ascent of Adummim . It went down to the Stone of Bohan ( Reuben ’ s son ) .
CEB	Joshua	18	19	The border passed on to the slope of Beth-hoglah on the north . The border ended at the north bay of the Dead Sea , at the southern mouth of the Jordan . This was the southern border .
CEB	Joshua	18	20	The Jordan bordered it on the east side . This is the legacy of the Benjaminite clans according to its borders . Cities of Benjamin

CEB	Joshua	19	9	Some of the portion of the people of Judah belonged to the legacy of the people of Simeon . This was because the portion of the people of Judah was too large for them . So the people of Simeon received a legacy inside Judah ’ s legacy . Zebulun

CEB	Joshua	19	49	So when they finished assigning the borders of the land , the Israelites gave to Joshua , Nun ’ s son , a legacy among them .
CEB	Joshua	19	50	By the Lord ’ s command , they gave him the city that he asked for . This was Timnath-serah in the highlands of Ephraim . He built a city and lived in it .
CEB	Joshua	19	51	These are the legacies that Eleazar the priest , Joshua , Nun ’ s son , and the heads of the families of the Israelite tribes assigned by lot at Shiloh . They did this before the Lord at the entrance of the meeting tent and finished dividing up the land . Footnotes - Joshua 19:29 LXX ; MT Mehebel
CEB	Joshua	20	20	The Lord spoke to Joshua :
CEB	Joshua	20	2	“ Say to the Israelites , ‘ Set up refuge cities for yourselves . I spoke to you about these through Moses .
CEB	Joshua	20	3	Anyone who kills by striking down someone unintentionally or by mistake may flee there . These places will be a refuge for you from any member of the victim ’ s family seeking revenge .
CEB	Joshua	20	4	The killer will flee to one of these cities , stand at the entrance of the city gate , and explain their situation to the elders of that city . The elders are to let the killer into the city and provide a place of refuge for the killer to live with them .
CEB	Joshua	20	5	If a member of the victim ’ s family follows , seeking revenge , they won ’ t hand the killer over . This is because the killer struck down the neighbor by accident and hadn ’ t been an enemy in the past .
CEB	Joshua	20	6	The killer will live in that city until there can be a trial before the community or [ a ] until the death of the one who is high priest at that time . Then the killer may return home , back to the city from which the flight began. ’ ”
CEB	Joshua	20	7	So they set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the highlands of Naphtali , Shechem in the highlands of Ephraim , and Kiriath-arba ( that is , Hebron ) in the highlands of Judah .
CEB	Joshua	20	8	On the other side of the Jordan east of Jericho , they set up Bezer in the wasteland on the plateau from the tribe of Reuben , Ramoth in Gilead from the tribe of Gad , and Golan in Bashan from the tribe of Manasseh .
CEB	Joshua	20	9	These cities were the ones designated for all the Israelites and for immigrants residing among them . Anyone who struck down a person by mistake could flee there and escape death at the hand of some member of the victim ’ s family seeking revenge , until there could be a trial before the community .

CEB	Joshua	21	43	The Lord gave to Israel all the land he had pledged to give to their ancestors . They took it over and settled there .
CEB	Joshua	21	44	The Lord gave them rest from surrounding danger , exactly as he had pledged to their ancestors . Not one of all their enemies held out against them . The Lord gave all their enemies into their power .
CEB	Joshua	21	45	Not one of all the good things that the Lord had promised to the house of Israel failed . Every promise was fulfilled . Footnotes - Joshua 21:37 LXX and
CEB	Joshua	21	1	Chron 6:78-79 ( Heb 6:63-64 ) ; some Heb manuscripts lack 21:36-37 .
CEB	Joshua	22	22	“ The Lord is God of gods ! The Lord is God of gods ! He already knows , and now let Israel also know it ! If we acted in rebellion or in disrespect against the Lord , don ’ t spare us today .
CEB	Joshua	22	2	He said to them , “ You obeyed everything that Moses the Lord ’ s servant commanded you . You have also obeyed me in everything that I have commanded you .
CEB	Joshua	22	3	During these many years , you never once deserted your fellow Israelites . You faithfully obeyed the command of the Lord your God .
CEB	Joshua	22	4	The Lord your God has now given rest to your fellow Israelites , exactly as he promised them . So turn around and go back home . Go to the land where you hold property , which Moses the Lord ’ s servant gave you on the other side of the Jordan .
CEB	Joshua	22	5	Just be very careful to carry out the commandment and Instruction that Moses the Lord ’ s servant commanded you . Love the Lord your God . Walk in all his ways and obey his commandments . Hold on to him and serve him with all your heart and being. ”
CEB	Joshua	22	6	Then Joshua blessed them . He sent them away , and they went home .
CEB	Joshua	22	7	Moses had provided for half of the tribe of Manasseh in Bashan . But Joshua provided for the other half on the west side of the Jordan along with their fellow Israelites . When he sent them back home , Joshua also blessed them .
CEB	Joshua	22	8	He said to them , “ Return home with great wealth and many cattle , with silver , gold , bronze , and iron , and with much clothing . Divide the spoil taken from your enemies among your own people. ” Disagreement about an altar
CEB	Joshua	22	9	So the people of Reuben , the people of Gad , and half the tribe of Manasseh went back . They left the Israelites at Shiloh , which is in the land of Canaan . They went to the land of Gilead , to the land that they owned . They had settled there at the Lord ’ s command given by Moses .
CEB	Joshua	22	10	They came to the districts [ a ] of the Jordan that are in the land of Canaan . The people of Reuben , the people of Gad , and half the tribe of Manasseh built an altar there by the Jordan , an altar that appeared to be immense .
CEB	Joshua	22	11	Then the Israelites heard a report : “ Look . The people of Reuben , the people of Gad , and half the tribe of Manasseh have built an altar at the far edge of the land of Canaan . It lies in the districts of the Jordan on the Israelite side ! ”
CEB	Joshua	22	12	When the Israelites heard this , the entire Israelite community assembled at Shiloh to go up to war against them .
CEB	Joshua	22	13	Then the Israelites sent Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest to the people of Reuben , the people of Gad , and half the tribe of Manasseh in the land of Gilead .
CEB	Joshua	22	14	They sent with him ten leaders , one leader from each important family among the tribes of Israel . Each was the head of an important family among the military units of Israel .
CEB	Joshua	22	15	They came to the people of Reuben , the people of Gad , and half the tribe of Manasseh in the land of Gilead and spoke with them .
CEB	Joshua	22	16	They said , “ Here is what the Lord ’ s entire community says : ‘ What ’ s this disrespectful thing that you ’ ve done to the God of Israel ? Today you ’ ve turned away from following the Lord by building yourselves an altar as an act of rebellion against the Lord .
CEB	Joshua	22	17	Wasn ’ t the offense of Peor enough for us ? Even today we still haven ’ t cleansed ourselves from that sin , when there was a plague on the Lord ’ s community !
CEB	Joshua	22	18	Today you are turning away from following the Lord . If you rebel against the Lord today , he will be angry with the entire community of Israel tomorrow .
CEB	Joshua	22	19	If your own property is unclean land , then cross over into the land of the Lord ’ s property and settle among us . That ’ s where the dwelling of the Lord stands . But don ’ t rebel against the Lord . And don ’ t involve us in rebellion [ b ] by building an altar for yourselves other than the altar of the Lord our God .
CEB	Joshua	22	20	Didn ’ t Achan , Zerah ’ s son , do such a disrespectful thing with the items reserved for God ? Wrath came on the entire community of Israel . And he wasn ’ t the only one to die for his crime. ’ ”
CEB	Joshua	22	21	Then the people of Reuben , the people of Gad , and half the tribe of Manasseh answered the heads of the military units of Israel :
CEB	Joshua	22	23	If we ’ ve built ourselves an altar to turn away from following the Lord or to offer on it an entirely burned offering or gift offering , or to perform well-being sacrifices on it , let the Lord himself seek punishment .
CEB	Joshua	22	24	No ! The truth is we did this out of concern for what might happen . In the future your children might say to our children , ‘ What have you got to do with the Lord , the God of Israel ?
CEB	Joshua	22	25	The Lord has set the Jordan as a border between us and you people of Reuben and Gad . You have no portion in the Lord ! ’ So your children might make our children stop worshipping the Lord .
CEB	Joshua	22	26	As a result we said , ‘ Let ’ s protect ourselves by building an altar . It isn ’ t to be for an entirely burned offering or for sacrifice. ’
CEB	Joshua	22	27	But it is to be a witness between us and you and between our descendants after us . It witnesses that we too perform the service of the Lord in his presence through our entirely burned offerings , sacrifices , and well-being offerings . So in the future your children could never say to our children , ‘ You have no portion in the Lord. ’
CEB	Joshua	22	28	We thought , If in the future they ever say this to us or to our descendants , we could say , ‘ Look at this replica of the altar of the Lord that our ancestors made . It isn ’ t for entirely burned offerings or for sacrifice but to be a witness between us and you. ’
CEB	Joshua	22	29	God forbid that we should rebel against the Lord and turn away today from following the Lord by building an altar for an entirely burned offering , gift offering , or sacrifice , other than the altar of the Lord our God that stands before his dwelling ! ”
CEB	Joshua	22	30	Phinehas the priest , the leaders of the community , and the heads of the military units of Israel who were with him heard the words that the people of Reuben , Gad , and Manasseh spoke and approved them .
CEB	Joshua	22	31	So Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said to the people of Reuben , Gad , and Manasseh , “ Today we know that the Lord is among us , because you haven ’ t done a disrespectful thing against the Lord . Now you ’ ve delivered the Israelites from the power of the Lord. ”
CEB	Joshua	22	32	Then Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest and the leaders left the people of Reuben and Gad in the land of Gilead and came back to the Israelites in the land of Canaan . They brought word back to them .
CEB	Joshua	22	33	The Israelites agreed and blessed God . They no longer spoke of going to war against them to destroy the land where the people of Reuben and Gad were living .
CEB	Joshua	22	34	The people of Reuben and Gad referred to the altar in this way : “ It is a witness between us that the Lord is God. ” Footnotes - Joshua 22:10 Heb Geliloth - Joshua 22:19 Or rebel against us
CEB	Joshua	23	23	A long time passed . The Lord had given rest to Israel from all their surrounding enemies , and Joshua had grown very old .
CEB	Joshua	23	2	Joshua summoned all Israel , their elders , their heads , their judges , and their officers . He said to them , “ I ’ ve grown very old .
CEB	Joshua	23	3	You ’ ve seen all that the Lord your God has done to all these nations because of you . It is the Lord your God who fights for you .
CEB	Joshua	23	4	Look . I ’ ve allotted to you these remaining nations as a legacy for your tribes , along with all the nations I have destroyed . They stretch from the Jordan to the Mediterranean Sea .
CEB	Joshua	23	5	The Lord your God will force them out before you and remove them from you . Then you will take over their land , exactly as the Lord your God has promised you .
CEB	Joshua	23	6	Be very strong . Carefully obey everything written in the Instruction scroll from Moses . Don ’ t deviate a bit from it either to the right or to the left .
CEB	Joshua	23	7	Don ’ t have anything to do with these nations that remain with you . Don ’ t invoke the names of their gods or take oaths by them . Don ’ t serve them or worship them .
CEB	Joshua	23	8	Hold on to the Lord your God instead , exactly as you ’ ve done right up to today .
CEB	Joshua	23	9	“ The Lord has removed great and powerful nations before you . To this day , no one has stood up to you .
CEB	Joshua	23	10	A single one of you puts a thousand to flight . This is because the Lord your God fights for you , exactly as he promised you .
CEB	Joshua	23	11	For your own sake , be very careful to love the Lord your God .
CEB	Joshua	23	12	But if you should turn away and join the rest of these nations that remain with you , intermarry with them , and associate with each other ,
CEB	Joshua	23	13	then know for certain that the Lord your God won ’ t keep on removing these nations before you . Instead , they will be a snare and a trap for you . They will be a whip on your sides and thorns in your eyes , until you vanish from this fertile land that the Lord your God has given you .
CEB	Joshua	23	14	“ Look . I ’ m now walking on the road to death that all the earth must take . You know with all your heart and being that not a single one of all the good things that the Lord your God promised about you has failed . They were all fulfilled for you . Not a single one of them has failed .
CEB	Joshua	23	15	But in the same way that every good thing that the Lord your God promised about you has been fulfilled , so the Lord could bring against you every bad thing as well . He could wipe you out from this fertile land that the Lord your God has given you .
CEB	Joshua	23	16	If you violate the covenant of the Lord your God , which he commanded you to keep , and go on to serve other gods and worship them , then the Lord will be furious with you . You will quickly vanish from the fertile land that he has given you . ”
CEB	Joshua	24	24	The people said to Joshua , “ We will serve the Lord our God and will obey him. ” Joshua makes a covenant
CEB	Joshua	24	2	Then Joshua said to the entire people , “ This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says : Long ago your ancestors lived on the other side of the Euphrates . They served other gods . Among them was Terah the father of Abraham and Nahor .
CEB	Joshua	24	3	I took Abraham your ancestor from the other side of the Euphrates . I led him around through the whole land of Canaan . I added to his descendants and gave him Isaac .
CEB	Joshua	24	4	To Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau . I gave Mount Seir to Esau to take over . But Jacob and his sons went down to Egypt .
CEB	Joshua	24	5	Then I sent Moses and Aaron . I plagued Egypt with what I did to them . After that I brought you out .
CEB	Joshua	24	6	I brought your ancestors out of Egypt , and you came to the sea . The Egyptians chased your ancestors with chariots and horses to the Reed Sea . [ a ]
CEB	Joshua	24	7	Then they cried for help to the Lord . So he set darkness between you and the Egyptians . He brought the sea down on them , and it covered them . With your own eyes you saw what I did to the Egyptians . You lived in the desert for a long time .
CEB	Joshua	24	8	“ Then I brought you into the land of the Amorites who lived on the other side of the Jordan . They attacked you , but I gave them into your power , and you took over their land . I wiped them out before you .
CEB	Joshua	24	9	Then Moab ’ s King Balak , Zippor ’ s son , set out to attack Israel . He summoned Balaam , Beor ’ s son , to curse you .
CEB	Joshua	24	10	But I wasn ’ t willing to listen to Balaam , so he actually blessed you . I rescued you from his power .
CEB	Joshua	24	11	Then you crossed over the Jordan . You came to Jericho , and the citizens of Jericho attacked you . They were Amorites , Perizzites , Canaanites , Hittites , Girgashites , Hivites , and Jebusites . But I gave them into your power .
CEB	Joshua	24	12	I sent the hornet [ b ] before you . It drove them out before you and did the same to the two kings of the Amorites . It wasn ’ t your sword or bow that did this .
CEB	Joshua	24	13	I gave you land on which you hadn ’ t toiled and cities that you hadn ’ t built . You settled in them and are enjoying produce from vineyards and olive groves that you didn ’ t plant . Challenge to be faithful
CEB	Joshua	24	14	“ So now , revere the Lord . Serve him honestly and faithfully . Put aside the gods that your ancestors served beyond the Euphrates and in Egypt and serve the Lord .
CEB	Joshua	24	15	But if it seems wrong in your opinion to serve the Lord , then choose today whom you will serve . Choose the gods whom your ancestors served beyond the Euphrates or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you live . But my family and I will serve the Lord. ”
CEB	Joshua	24	16	Then the people answered , “ God forbid that we ever leave the Lord to serve other gods !
CEB	Joshua	24	17	The Lord is our God . He is the one who brought us and our ancestors up from the land of Egypt , from the house of bondage . He has done these mighty signs in our sight . He has protected us the whole way we ’ ve gone and in all the nations through which we ’ ve passed .
CEB	Joshua	24	18	The Lord has driven out all the nations before us , including the Amorites who lived in the land . We too will serve the Lord , because he is our God. ”
CEB	Joshua	24	19	Then Joshua said to the people , “ You can ’ t serve the Lord , because he is a holy God . He is a jealous God . He won ’ t forgive your rebellion and your sins .
CEB	Joshua	24	20	If you leave the Lord and serve foreign gods , then he will turn around and do you harm and finish you off , in spite of having done you good in the past. ”
CEB	Joshua	24	21	Then the people said to Joshua , “ No ! The Lord is the one we will serve. ”
CEB	Joshua	24	22	So Joshua said to the people , “ You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen to serve the Lord. ” They said , “ We are witnesses ! ”
CEB	Joshua	24	23	“ So now put aside the foreign gods that are among you . Focus your hearts on the Lord , the God of Israel. ”
CEB	Joshua	24	25	On that day Joshua made a covenant for the people and established just rule for them at Shechem .
CEB	Joshua	24	26	Joshua wrote these words in God ’ s Instruction scroll . Then he took a large stone and put it up there under the oak in the sanctuary of the Lord .
CEB	Joshua	24	27	Joshua said to all the people , “ This stone will serve here as a witness against us , because it has heard all the Lord ’ s words that he spoke to us . It will serve as a witness against you in case you aren ’ t true to your God. ”
CEB	Joshua	24	28	Then Joshua sent the people away to each one ’ s legacy . Three important graves
CEB	Joshua	24	29	After these events , Joshua , Nun ’ s son , the Lord ’ s servant , died . He was
CEB	Joshua	24	110	.
CEB	Joshua	24	30	They buried him within the border of his own legacy , in Timnath-serah in the highlands of Ephraim north of Mount Gaash .
CEB	Joshua	24	31	Israel served the Lord all the days of Joshua and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua . They had known every act the Lord had done for Israel .
CEB	Joshua	24	32	The Israelites had brought up the bones of Joseph from Egypt . They buried them at Shechem in the portion of field that Jacob had purchased for one hundred qesitahs from the descendants of Hamor the father of Shechem . They became a legacy of the descendants of Joseph .

CEB	Judges	1	2	The Lord said , “ The tribe of Judah will go up . I ’ ve handed over the land to them. ”
CEB	Judges	1	3	So the tribe of Judah said to the tribe of Simeon , their brothers , “ Come up with us into our territory , and let ’ s fight against the Canaanites . Then we ’ ll go with you into your territory too. ” So Simeon went with them .
CEB	Judges	1	4	When Judah went up , the Lord handed them the Canaanites and Perizzites . They defeated ten thousand men at Bezek .
CEB	Judges	1	5	There they found Adoni-bezek at Bezek , fought against him , and defeated the Canaanites and Perizzites .
CEB	Judges	1	6	Adoni-bezek fled , but they chased after him , captured him , and cut off his thumbs and big toes .
CEB	Judges	1	7	He said , “ Seventy kings with severed thumbs and big toes used to pick up scraps under my table , so God has paid me back exactly for what I did. ” They brought him to Jerusalem , where he died .
CEB	Judges	1	8	The people of Judah fought against Jerusalem and captured it . They killed its people with their swords and set the city on fire .
CEB	Judges	1	9	Afterward , the people of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who lived in the highlands , the southern plain , [ a ] and the western foothills . [ b ]
CEB	Judges	1	10	Judah moved against the Canaanites who lived in Hebron , known before as Kiriath-arba , and they defeated Sheshai , Ahiman , and Talmai .
CEB	Judges	1	11	From there they moved against those who lived in Debir , known before as Kiriath-sepher .
CEB	Judges	1	12	Caleb said , “ I ’ ll give my daughter Achsah as a wife to the one who defeats and captures Kiriath-sepher. ”
CEB	Judges	1	13	Othniel son of Kenaz , Caleb ’ s younger brother , captured it ; so Caleb gave him his daughter Achsah as a wife .
CEB	Judges	1	14	When she arrived , she convinced Othniel to ask her father for a certain piece of land . As she got down from her donkey , Caleb said to her , “ What do you want ? ”
CEB	Judges	1	15	Achsah said to Caleb , “ Give me a gift . Since you ’ ve given me land in the southern plain , give me springs of water. ” So Caleb gave her the upper and lower springs .
CEB	Judges	1	16	The descendants of Moses ’ father-in-law the Kenite went up with the people of Judah from Palm City into the Judean desert , which was in the southern plain near Arad . They went and lived with the Amalekites . [ c ]
CEB	Judges	1	17	Then the Judahites went with the Simeonites , their brothers , and they defeated the Canaanites who lived in Zephath , and they completely destroyed it . So the city was called Hormah . [ d ]
CEB	Judges	1	18	Judah also captured Gaza , Ashkelon , Ekron , and all their territories .
CEB	Judges	1	19	Thus the Lord was with the tribe of Judah , and they took possession of the highlands . However , they didn ’ t drive out those who lived in the plain because they had iron chariots .
CEB	Judges	1	20	They gave Hebron to Caleb , just as Moses had commanded , and they drove out from there the three sons of Anak .
CEB	Judges	1	21	But the people of Benjamin didn ’ t drive out the Jebusites who lived in Jerusalem . So the Jebusites still live with the people of Benjamin in Jerusalem today .
CEB	Judges	1	22	In the same way , Joseph ’ s household went up against Bethel , and the Lord was with them .
CEB	Judges	1	23	When they sent men to spy on Bethel , previously named Luz ,
CEB	Judges	1	24	the spies saw a man coming out of the city , and they said to him , “ Show us the way into the city , and we ’ ll be loyal to you in return. ”
CEB	Judges	1	25	So he showed them the way into the city . They killed the city ’ s people with their swords , but they let that man and all his relatives go .
CEB	Judges	1	26	The man went to the land of the Hittites and built a city . He named it Luz , which is still its name today .
CEB	Judges	1	27	The tribe of Manasseh didn ’ t drive out the people in Beth-shean , Taanach , Dor , Ibleam , Megiddo , or any of their villages . The Canaanites were determined to live in that land .
CEB	Judges	1	28	When Israel became stronger they forced the Canaanites to work for them , but they didn ’ t completely drive them out .
CEB	Judges	1	29	The tribe of Ephraim didn ’ t drive out the Canaanites living in Gezer , so the Canaanites kept on living there with them .
CEB	Judges	1	30	The tribe of Zebulun didn ’ t drive out the people living in Kitron or Nahalol . These Canaanites lived with them but were forced to work for them .
CEB	Judges	1	31	The tribe of Asher didn ’ t drive out the people living in Acco , Sidon , Ahlab , Achzib , Helbah , Aphik , or Rehob .
CEB	Judges	1	32	The people of Asher settled among the Canaanites in the land because they couldn ’ t drive them out .
CEB	Judges	1	33	The tribe of Naphtali didn ’ t drive out the people living in Beth-shemesh or Beth-anath but settled among the Canaanites in the land . The people living in Beth-shemesh and Beth-anath were forced to work for them .
CEB	Judges	1	34	The Amorites pushed the people of Dan back into the highlands because they wouldn ’ t allow them to come down to the plain .
CEB	Judges	1	35	The Amorites were determined to live in Har-heres , Aijalon , and Shaalbim , but Joseph ’ s household became strong , and the Amorites were forced to work for them .
CEB	Judges	1	36	The border of the Amorites ran from the Akrabbim pass , from Sela , and upward . Footnotes - Judges 1:9 Heb negeb - Judges 1:9 Heb shephelah - Judges 1:16 LXX ( cf
CEB	Judges	2	2	and you are not to make a covenant with those who live in this land . You should break down their altars. ’ But you didn ’ t obey me . What have you done ?
CEB	Judges	2	3	So now I tell you , I won ’ t drive them out before you , but they ’ ll be a problem [ a ] for you , and their gods will be a trap for you. ”
CEB	Judges	2	4	When the Lord ’ s messenger spoke these words to all the Israelites , they raised their voices and cried out loud .
CEB	Judges	2	5	So they named that place Bochim , [ b ] and they offered a sacrifice to the Lord there . Death of Joshua and his generation
CEB	Judges	2	6	When Joshua dismissed the people , the Israelites each went to settle on their own family property in order to take possession of the land .
CEB	Judges	2	7	The people served the Lord throughout the rest of Joshua ’ s life and throughout the next generation of elders who outlived him , those who had seen all the great things that the Lord had done for Israel .
CEB	Judges	2	8	Joshua , Nun ’ s son and the Lord ’ s servant , died when he was
CEB	Judges	2	110	years old .
CEB	Judges	2	9	They buried him within the boundaries of his family property in Timnath-heres in the highlands of Ephraim north of Mount Gaash .
CEB	Judges	2	10	When that whole generation had passed away , another generation came after them who didn ’ t know the Lord or the things that he had done for Israel . Israel ’ s pattern of sin and punishment
CEB	Judges	2	11	Then the Israelites did things that the Lord saw as evil : They served the Baals ;
CEB	Judges	2	12	and they went away from the Lord , their ancestors ’ God , who had brought them out of the land of Egypt . They went after other gods from among the surrounding peoples , they worshipped them , and they angered the Lord .
CEB	Judges	2	13	They went away from the Lord and served Baal and the Astartes .
CEB	Judges	2	14	So the Lord became angry with Israel , and he handed them over to raiders who plundered them . He let them be defeated by their enemies around them , so that they were no longer able to stand up to them .
CEB	Judges	2	15	Whenever the Israelites marched out , the Lord ’ s power worked against them , just as the Lord had warned them . And they were very distressed .
CEB	Judges	2	16	Then the Lord raised up leaders [ c ] to rescue them from the power of these raiders .
CEB	Judges	2	17	But they wouldn ’ t even obey their own leaders because they were unfaithful , following other gods and worshipping them . They quickly deviated from the way of their ancestors , who had obeyed the Lord ’ s commands , and didn ’ t follow their example .
CEB	Judges	2	18	The Lord was moved by Israel ’ s groaning under those who oppressed and crushed them . So the Lord would raise up leaders for them , and the Lord would be with the leader , and he would rescue Israel from the power of their enemies as long as that leader lived .
CEB	Judges	2	19	But then when the leader died , they would once again act in ways that weren ’ t as good as their ancestors ’ , going after other gods , to serve them and to worship them . They wouldn ’ t drop their bad practices or hardheaded ways .
CEB	Judges	2	20	So the Lord became angry with Israel and said , “ Because this nation has violated my covenant that I required of their ancestors and hasn ’ t obeyed me ,
CEB	Judges	2	21	I in turn will no longer drive out before them any of the nations that Joshua left when he died. ”
CEB	Judges	2	22	As a test for Israel , to see whether they would carefully walk in the Lord ’ s ways just as their ancestors had done ,
CEB	Judges	2	23	the Lord left these nations instead of driving them out immediately or handing them over to Joshua . Footnotes - Judges 2:3 Heb uncertain - Judges 2:5 Or weepers or weeping - Judges 2:16 Or judges
CEB	Judges	3	3	the five rulers of the Philistines , and all the Canaanites , Sidonians , and Hivites who lived in the highlands of Lebanon from Mount Baal-hermon to Lebo-hamath .
CEB	Judges	3	2	They survived only to teach war to the generations of Israelites who had no firsthand knowledge of the earlier wars :
CEB	Judges	3	4	They were to be the test for Israel , to find out whether they would obey the Lord ’ s commands , which he had made to their ancestors through Moses .
CEB	Judges	3	5	So the Israelites lived among the Canaanites , Hittites , Amorites , Perizzites , Hivites , and Jebusites .
CEB	Judges	3	6	But the Israelites intermarried with them and served their gods . Othniel , the model judge
CEB	Judges	3	7	The Israelites did things that the Lord saw as evil , and they forgot the Lord their God . They served the Baals and the Asherahs . [ a ]
CEB	Judges	3	8	The Lord became angry with Israel and gave them over to King Cushan-rishathaim of Aram-naharaim . The Israelites served Cushan-rishathaim eight years .
CEB	Judges	3	9	But then they cried out to the Lord . So the Lord raised up a deliverer for the Israelites , Othniel , Kenaz ’ s son , Caleb ’ s younger brother , who rescued them .
CEB	Judges	3	10	The Lord ’ s spirit was in Othniel , and he led Israel . When he marched out for war , the Lord handed over Aram ’ s King Cushan-rishathaim . Othniel overpowered Cushan-rishathaim ,
CEB	Judges	3	11	and the land was peaceful for forty years , until Othniel , Kenaz ’ s son , died . Ehud
CEB	Judges	3	12	The Israelites again did things that the Lord saw as evil , and the Lord put Moab ’ s King Eglon in power over them , because they did these things that the Lord saw as evil .
CEB	Judges	3	13	He convinced the Ammonites and Amalekites to join him , defeated Israel , and took possession of Palm City .
CEB	Judges	3	14	So the Israelites served Moab ’ s King Eglon eighteen years .
CEB	Judges	3	15	Then the Israelites cried out to the Lord . So the Lord raised up a deliverer for them , Ehud , Gera ’ s son , a Benjaminite , who was left-handed . The Israelites sent him to take their tribute payment to Moab ’ s King Eglon .
CEB	Judges	3	16	Now Ehud made for himself a double-edged sword that was about a foot and a half long , and he strapped it on his right thigh under his clothes .
CEB	Judges	3	17	Then he presented the tribute payment to Moab ’ s King Eglon , who was a very fat man .
CEB	Judges	3	18	When he had finished delivering the tribute payment , Ehud sent on their way the people who had carried it .
CEB	Judges	3	19	But he himself turned back at the carved stones near Gilgal , and he said , “ I have a secret message for you , King. ” So Eglon said , “ Hush ! ” and all his attendants went out of his presence .
CEB	Judges	3	20	Ehud approached him while he was sitting alone in his cool second-story room , and he said , “ I have a message from God for you. ” At that , Eglon got up from his throne .
CEB	Judges	3	21	Ehud reached with his left hand and grabbed the sword from his right thigh . He stabbed it into Eglon ’ s stomach ,
CEB	Judges	3	22	and even the handle went in after the blade . Since he did not pull the sword out of his stomach , the fat closed over the blade , and his guts spilled out . [ b ]
CEB	Judges	3	23	Ehud slipped out to the porch , and closed and locked the doors of the second-story room behind him .
CEB	Judges	3	24	After Ehud had slipped out , the king ’ s servants came and found that the room ’ s doors were locked . So they thought , He must be relieving himself in the cool chamber .
CEB	Judges	3	25	They waited so long that they were embarrassed , but he never opened the doors of the room . Then they used the key to open them , and there was their master lying dead on the ground !
CEB	Judges	3	26	Ehud had gotten away while they were waiting and had passed the carved stones and escaped to Seirah .
CEB	Judges	3	27	When he arrived , he blew the ram ’ s horn in the Ephraim highlands . So the Israelites went down from the highlands with Ehud leading them .
CEB	Judges	3	28	He told them , “ Follow me , for the Lord has handed over your enemies the Moabites. ” So they followed him , and they took control of the crossing points of the Jordan in the direction of Moab , allowing no one to cross .
CEB	Judges	3	29	This time , they defeated the Moabites , about ten thousand big and strong men , and no one escaped .
CEB	Judges	3	30	Moab was brought down by the power of Israel on that day , and there was peace in the land for eighty years . Shamgar
CEB	Judges	3	31	After Ehud , Shamgar , Anath ’ s son , struck down six hundred Philistines with an animal prod . He too rescued Israel . Footnotes - Judges 3:7 Heb asherim ; perhaps objects or a pole devoted to the goddess Asherah - Judges 3:22 Heb uncertain
CEB	Judges	4	4	Now Deborah , a prophet , the wife of Lappidoth , [ b ] was a leader of Israel at that time .
CEB	Judges	4	2	So the Lord gave them over to King Jabin of Canaan , who reigned in Hazor . The commander of his army was Sisera , and he was stationed in Harosheth-ha-goiim .
CEB	Judges	4	3	The Israelites cried out to the Lord because Sisera [ a ] had nine hundred iron chariots and had oppressed the Israelites cruelly for twenty years .
CEB	Judges	4	5	She would sit under Deborah ’ s palm tree between Ramah and Bethel in the Ephraim highlands , and the Israelites would come to her to settle disputes .
CEB	Judges	4	6	She sent word to Barak , Abinoam ’ s son , from Kedesh in Naphtali and said to him , “ Hasn ’ t the Lord , Israel ’ s God , issued you a command ? ‘ Go and assemble at Mount Tabor , taking ten thousand men from the people of Naphtali and Zebulun with you .
CEB	Judges	4	7	I ’ ll lure Sisera , the commander of Jabin ’ s army , to assemble with his chariots and troops against you at the Kishon River , and then I ’ ll help you overpower him. ’ ”
CEB	Judges	4	8	Barak replied to her , “ If you ’ ll go with me , I ’ ll go ; but if not , I won ’ t go. ”
CEB	Judges	4	9	Deborah answered , “ I ’ ll definitely go with you . However , the path you ’ re taking won ’ t bring honor to you , because the Lord will hand over Sisera to a woman. ” Then Deborah got up and went with Barak to Kedesh .
CEB	Judges	4	10	He summoned Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh , and ten thousand men marched out behind him . Deborah marched out with him too .
CEB	Judges	4	11	Now Heber the Kenite had moved away from the other Kenites , the descendants of Hobab , Moses ’ father-in-law , and had settled as far away as Elon-bezaanannim , which is near Kedesh .
CEB	Judges	4	12	When it was reported to Sisera that Barak , Abinoam ’ s son , had marched up to Mount Tabor ,
CEB	Judges	4	13	Sisera summoned all of his nine hundred iron chariots and all of the soldiers who were with him from Harosheth-ha-goiim to the Kishon River .
CEB	Judges	4	14	Then Deborah said to Barak , “ Get up ! This is the day that the Lord has handed Sisera over to you . Hasn ’ t the Lord gone out before you ? ” So Barak went down from Mount Tabor with ten thousand men behind him .
CEB	Judges	4	15	The Lord threw Sisera and all the chariots and army into a panic [ c ] before Barak ; Sisera himself got down from his chariot and fled on foot .
CEB	Judges	4	16	Barak pursued the chariots and the army all the way back to Harosheth-ha-goiim , killing Sisera ’ s entire army with the sword . No one survived .
CEB	Judges	4	17	Meanwhile , Sisera had fled on foot to the tent of Jael , the wife of Heber the Kenite , because there was peace between Hazor ’ s King Jabin and the family of Heber the Kenite .
CEB	Judges	4	18	Jael went out to meet Sisera and said to him , “ Come in , sir , come in here . Don ’ t be afraid. ” So he went with her into the tent , and she hid him under a blanket .
CEB	Judges	4	19	Sisera said to her , “ Please give me a little water to drink . I ’ m thirsty. ” So she opened a jug of milk , gave him a drink , and hid him again .
CEB	Judges	4	20	Then he said to her , “ Stand at the entrance to the tent . That way , if someone comes and asks you , ‘ Is there a man here ? ’ you can say , ‘ No. ’ ”
CEB	Judges	4	21	But Jael , Heber ’ s wife , picked up a tent stake and a hammer . While Sisera was sound asleep from exhaustion , she tiptoed to him . She drove the stake through his head and down into the ground , and he died .
CEB	Judges	4	22	Just then , Barak arrived after chasing Sisera . Jael went out to meet him and said , “ Come and I ’ ll show you the man you ’ re after. ” So he went in with her , and there was Sisera , lying dead , with the stake through his head .
CEB	Judges	4	23	So on that day God brought down Canaan ’ s King Jabin before the Israelites .
CEB	Judges	4	24	And the power of the Israelites grew greater and greater over Canaan ’ s King Jabin until they defeated him completely . Footnotes - Judges 4:3 Or he - Judges 4:4 Or a woman of torches - Judges 4:15 MT adds before the edge of the sword .
CEB	Judges	5	5	The mountains quaked before the Lord , the one from Sinai , before the Lord , the God of Israel .
CEB	Judges	5	2	When hair is long in Israel , when people willingly offer themselves—bless the Lord !
CEB	Judges	5	3	Hear , kings ! Listen , rulers ! I , to the Lord , I will sing . I will make music to the Lord , Israel ’ s God .
CEB	Judges	5	4	Lord , when you set out from Seir , when you marched out from Edom ’ s fields , the land shook , the sky poured down , the clouds poured down water .
CEB	Judges	5	6	In the days of Shamgar , Anath ’ s son , in the days of Jael , caravans ceased . Those traveling by road kept to the backroads .
CEB	Judges	5	7	Villagers disappeared ; they disappeared in Israel , until you , [ a ] Deborah , arose , until you arose as a mother in Israel .
CEB	Judges	5	8	When they chose new gods , then war came to the city gates . [ b ] Yet there wasn ’ t a shield or spear to be seen among forty thousand in Israel !
CEB	Judges	5	9	My heart is with Israel ’ s commanders , who willingly offered themselves among the people—bless the Lord !
CEB	Judges	5	10	You who ride white donkeys , who sit on saddle blankets , [ c ] who walk along the road : tell of it .
CEB	Judges	5	11	To the sound of instruments [ d ] at the watering places , there they repeat the Lord ’ s victories , his villagers ’ victories in Israel . Then the Lord ’ s people marched down to the city gates .
CEB	Judges	5	12	“ Wake up , wake up , Deborah ! Wake up , wake up , sing a song ! Arise , Barak ! Capture your prisoners , Abinoam ’ s son ! ”
CEB	Judges	5	13	Then those who remained marched down against royalty ; the Lord ’ s people marched down [ e ] against warriors .
CEB	Judges	5	14	From Ephraim they set out [ f ] into the valley , [ g ] after you , Benjamin , with your people ! From Machir commanders marched down , and from Zebulun those carrying the official ’ s staff .
CEB	Judges	5	15	The leaders of Issachar came along with Deborah ; Issachar was attached to Barak , and was sent into the valley behind him . Among the clans of Reuben there was deep soul-searching .
CEB	Judges	5	16	“ Why did you stay back among the sheep pens , listening to the music for the flocks ? ” For the clans of Reuben there was deep soul-searching .
CEB	Judges	5	17	Gilead stayed on the other side of the Jordan , and Dan , why did he remain with the ships ? Asher stayed by the seacoast , camping at his harbors .
CEB	Judges	5	18	Zebulun is a people that readily risked death ; Naphtali too in the high countryside .
CEB	Judges	5	19	Kings came and made war ; the kings of Canaan fought at Taanach by Megiddo ’ s waters , but they captured no spoils of silver .
CEB	Judges	5	20	The stars fought from the sky ; from their orbits they fought against Sisera .
CEB	Judges	5	21	The Kishon River swept them away ; the advancing river , the Kishon River . March on , my life , with might !
CEB	Judges	5	22	Then the horses ’ hooves pounded with the galloping , galloping of their stallions .
CEB	Judges	5	23	“ Curse Meroz , ” says the Lord ’ s messenger , “ curse its inhabitants bitterly , because they didn ’ t come to the Lord ’ s aid , to the Lord ’ s aid against the warriors. ”
CEB	Judges	5	24	May Jael be blessed above all women ; may the wife of Heber the Kenite be blessed above all tent-dwelling women .
CEB	Judges	5	25	He asked for water , and she provided milk ; she presented him cream in a majestic bowl .
CEB	Judges	5	26	She reached out her hand for the stake , her strong hand for the worker ’ s hammer . She struck Sisera ; she crushed his head ; she shattered and pierced his skull .
CEB	Judges	5	27	At her feet he sank , fell , and lay flat ; at her feet he sank , he fell ; where he sank , there he fell—dead .
CEB	Judges	5	28	Through the window she watched , Sisera ’ s mother looked longingly [ h ] through the lattice . “ Why is his chariot taking so long to come ? Why are the hoofbeats of his chariot horses delayed ? ”
CEB	Judges	5	29	Her wisest attendants answer ; indeed , she replies to herself :
CEB	Judges	5	30	“ Wouldn ’ t they be finding and dividing the loot ? A girl or two for each warrior ; loot of colored cloths for Sisera ; loot of colored , embroidered cloths ; two colored , embroidered cloths as loot for every neck. ”
CEB	Judges	5	31	May all your enemies perish like this , Lord ! But may your allies be like the sun , rising in its strength . And the land was peaceful for forty years . Footnotes - Judges 5:7 Or I - Judges 5:8 Heb uncertain - Judges 5:10 Heb uncertain - Judges 5:11 Heb uncertain - Judges 5:13 Heb adds for me . - Judges 5:14 Or From Ephraim their root - Judges 5:14 LXX ; MT in Amalek - Judges 5:28 LXX ; MT cried
CEB	Judges	6	6	So Israel became very weak on account of Midian , and the Israelites cried out to the Lord .
CEB	Judges	6	2	The power of the Midianites prevailed over Israel , and because of the Midianites , the Israelites used crevices and caves in the mountains as hidden strongholds .
CEB	Judges	6	3	Whenever the Israelites planted seeds , the Midianites , Amalekites , and other easterners would invade .
CEB	Judges	6	4	They would set up camp against the Israelites and destroy the land ’ s crops as far as Gaza , leaving nothing to keep Israel alive , not even sheep , oxen , or donkeys .
CEB	Judges	6	5	They would invade with their herds and tents , coming like a swarm of locusts , so that no one could count them or their camels . They came into the land to destroy it .
CEB	Judges	6	7	This time when the Israelites cried out to the Lord because of Midian ,
CEB	Judges	6	8	the Lord sent them a prophet , who said to them , “ The Lord , Israel ’ s God , proclaims : I myself brought you up from Egypt , and I led you out of the house of slavery .
CEB	Judges	6	9	I delivered you from the power of the Egyptians and from the power of all your oppressors . I drove them out before you and gave you their land .
CEB	Judges	6	10	I told you , ‘ I am the Lord your God ; you must not worship the gods of the Amorites , in whose land you are living. ’ But you have not obeyed me. ” Gideon ’ s commissioning
CEB	Judges	6	11	Then the Lord ’ s messenger came and sat under the oak at Ophrah that belonged to Joash the Abiezrite . His son Gideon was threshing wheat in a winepress to hide it from the Midianites .
CEB	Judges	6	12	The Lord ’ s messenger appeared to him and said , “ The Lord is with you , mighty warrior ! ”
CEB	Judges	6	13	But Gideon replied to him , “ With all due respect , my Lord , if the Lord is with us , why has all this happened to us ? Where are all his amazing works that our ancestors recounted to us , saying , ‘ Didn ’ t the Lord bring us up from Egypt ? ’ But now the Lord has abandoned us and allowed Midian to overpower us. ”
CEB	Judges	6	14	Then the Lord turned to him and said , “ You have strength , so go and rescue Israel from the power of Midian . Am I not personally sending you ? ”
CEB	Judges	6	15	But again Gideon said to him , “ With all due respect , my Lord , how can I rescue Israel ? My clan is the weakest in Manasseh , and I ’ m the youngest in my household. ”
CEB	Judges	6	16	The Lord replied , “ Because I ’ m with you , you ’ ll defeat the Midianites as if they were just one person. ” [ a ]
CEB	Judges	6	17	Then Gideon said to him , “ If I ’ ve gained your approval , please show me a sign that it ’ s really you speaking with me .
CEB	Judges	6	18	Don ’ t leave here until I return , bring out my offering , and set it in front of you. ” The Lord replied , “ I ’ ll stay until you return. ”
CEB	Judges	6	19	So Gideon went and prepared a young goat and used an ephah [ b ] of flour for unleavened bread . He put the meat in a basket and the broth in a pot and brought them out to him under the oak and presented them .
CEB	Judges	6	20	Then God ’ s messenger said to him , “ Take the meat and the unleavened bread and set them on this rock , then pour out the broth. ” And he did so .
CEB	Judges	6	21	The Lord ’ s messenger reached out the tip of the staff that was in his hand and touched the meat and the unleavened bread . Fire came up from the rock and devoured the meat and the unleavened bread ; and the Lord ’ s messenger vanished before his eyes .
CEB	Judges	6	22	Then Gideon realized that it had been the Lord ’ s messenger . Gideon exclaimed , “ Oh no , Lord God ! I have seen the Lord ’ s messenger face-to-face ! ”
CEB	Judges	6	23	But the Lord said to him , “ Peace ! Don ’ t be afraid ! You won ’ t die. ”
CEB	Judges	6	24	So Gideon built an altar there to the Lord and called it “ The Lord makes peace. ” It still stands today in Ophrah of the Abiezrites .
CEB	Judges	6	25	That night the Lord said to him , “ Take your father ’ s bull and a second bull seven years old . Break down your father ’ s altar to Baal and cut down the Asherah [ c ] that is beside it .
CEB	Judges	6	26	Build an altar to the Lord your God in the proper way on top of this high ground . Then take the second bull and offer it as an entirely burned offering with the wood of the Asherah that you cut down. ”
CEB	Judges	6	27	So Gideon took ten of his servants and did just as the Lord had told him . But because he was too afraid of his household and the townspeople to do it during the day , he did it at night .
CEB	Judges	6	28	When the townspeople got up early in the morning , there was the altar to Baal broken down , with the asherah image that had been beside it cut down , and the second bull offered on the newly built altar !
CEB	Judges	6	29	They asked each other , “ Who did this ? ” They searched and investigated , and finally they concluded , “ Gideon , Joash ’ s son , did this ! ”
CEB	Judges	6	30	The townspeople said to Joash , “ Bring out your son for execution because he tore down the altar to Baal and cut down the Asherah that was beside it. ”
CEB	Judges	6	31	But Joash replied to all who were lined up against him , “ Will you make Baal ’ s complaint for him ? Will you come to his rescue ? Anyone who argues for him will be killed before morning . If he is a god , let him argue for himself , because it was his altar that was torn down. ”
CEB	Judges	6	32	So on that day Gideon became known as Jerubbaal , meaning , “ Let Baal argue with him , ” because he tore down his altar . Gideon seeks a sign
CEB	Judges	6	33	Some time later , all the Midianites , Amalekites , and other easterners joined together , came over , and set up camp in the Jezreel Valley .
CEB	Judges	6	34	Then the Lord ’ s spirit came over Gideon , and he sounded the horn and summoned the Abiezrites to follow him .
CEB	Judges	6	35	He sent messengers into all of Manasseh , and they were also summoned to follow him . Then he sent messengers into Asher , Zebulun , and Naphtali too , and they marched up to meet them .
CEB	Judges	6	36	But then Gideon said to God , “ To see if you really intend to rescue Israel through me as you have declared ,
CEB	Judges	6	37	I ’ m now putting a wool fleece on the threshing floor . If there is dew only on the fleece but all the ground is dry , then I ’ ll know that you are going to rescue Israel through me , as you have declared. ”
CEB	Judges	6	38	And that is what happened . When he got up early the next morning and squeezed the fleece , he wrung out enough dew from the fleece to fill a bowl with water .
CEB	Judges	6	39	Then Gideon said to God , “ Don ’ t be angry with me , but let me speak just one more time . Please let me make just one more test with the fleece : now let only the fleece be dry and let dew be on all the ground. ”
CEB	Judges	6	40	And God did so that night . Only the fleece was dry , but there was dew on all the ground .

CEB	Judges	7	7	Then the Lord said to Gideon , “ With the three hundred men who lapped I will rescue you and hand over the Midianites to you . Let everyone else go home. ”
CEB	Judges	7	2	The Lord said to Gideon : “ You have too many people on your side . If I were to hand Midian over to them , the Israelites might claim credit for themselves rather than for me , thinking , We saved ourselves .
CEB	Judges	7	3	So now , announce in the people ’ s hearing , ‘ Anyone who is afraid or unsteady may return home from Gideon ’ s mountain. ’ ” [ a ] At this , twenty-two thousand people went home , and ten thousand were left .
CEB	Judges	7	4	The Lord said to Gideon , “ There are still too many people . Take them down to the water , and I will weed them out for you there . Whenever I tell you , ‘ This one will go with you , ’ he should go with you ; but whenever I tell you , ‘ This one won ’ t go with you , ’ he should not go. ”
CEB	Judges	7	5	So he took the people down to the water . And the Lord said to Gideon , “ Set aside those who lap the water with their tongues , as a dog laps , from those who bend down on their knees to drink. ”
CEB	Judges	7	6	The number of men who lapped was three hundred , and all the rest of the people bent down on their knees to drink water , with their hands to their mouths . [ b ]
CEB	Judges	7	8	So the people gathered their supplies and trumpets , [ c ] and Gideon sent all the Israelites home , but kept the three hundred . Now Midian ’ s camp was below Gideon in the valley .
CEB	Judges	7	9	That night the Lord said to him , “ Get up and attack the camp , because I ’ ve handed it over to you .
CEB	Judges	7	10	But if you ’ re afraid to attack , go down to the camp with your servant Purah ,
CEB	Judges	7	11	and you ’ ll hear what they are saying . May you then get the courage to attack the camp. ” So he went down with his servant Purah to the outpost of the armies that were in the camp .
CEB	Judges	7	12	The Midianites , Amalekites , and other easterners were spread across the valley like a swarm of locusts ; their camels were too many to count , like the grains of sand on the seashore .
CEB	Judges	7	13	Just when Gideon arrived , there was a man telling his friend about a dream . He said , “ Get this ! I had a dream that a loaf of barley bread was rolling into the Midianite camp . It came to a tent and hit it , and the tent collapsed . In fact , it rolled the tent over upside down , so it fell flat. ”
CEB	Judges	7	14	His friend replied , “ Can this be anything other than the sword of the Israelite Gideon , Joash ’ s son ? God has handed over Midian and its entire camp to him ! ”
CEB	Judges	7	15	When Gideon heard the telling of the dream and its meaning , he worshipped . Then he returned to the Israelite camp and said , “ Get up ! The Lord has handed over the Midianite camp to you. ”
CEB	Judges	7	16	He divided the three hundred men into three units and equipped every man with a trumpet and an empty jar , with a torch inside each jar .
CEB	Judges	7	17	“ Now watch me , ” he ordered them , “ and do what I do . When I get to the outpost of the camp , do just what I do .
CEB	Judges	7	18	When I blow the trumpet , along with all who are with me , then you blow the trumpets , all of you surrounding the whole camp . And then shout , ‘ For the Lord and for Gideon ! ’ ”
CEB	Judges	7	19	Gideon and one hundred of his men moved to the outpost of the camp at the middle watch of the night , when they had just changed the guards . Then they blew the trumpets and smashed the jars that were in their hands .
CEB	Judges	7	20	So the three units blew their trumpets and broke their jars , holding the torches with their left hands and blowing the trumpets in their right hands . And they called out , “ A sword for the Lord and for Gideon ! ”
CEB	Judges	7	21	Each man stood fast in his position around the camp , and the entire camp took off running , shouting , and fleeing .
CEB	Judges	7	22	When the three hundred trumpets sounded , the Lord turned the swords of fellow soldiers against each other throughout the whole camp . The camp fled as far as Beth-shittah toward Zererah , to the border of Abel-meholah , beside Tabbath .
CEB	Judges	7	23	The Israelites from Naphtali , Asher , and all of Manasseh were called out , and they chased after the Midianites .
CEB	Judges	7	24	Then Gideon sent messengers into all of the Ephraim highlands , saying , “ Go down to meet the Midianites and take control of the Jordan ’ s waters as far as Beth-barah. ” So all the Ephraimite men were called out , and they took control of the Jordan ’ s waters as far as Beth-barah .
CEB	Judges	7	25	They also captured two Midianite officers , Oreb and Zeeb . They killed Oreb at Oreb ’ s Rock , and killed Zeeb at Zeeb ’ s Winepress . Then they went on chasing the Midianites , and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side of the Jordan . Footnotes - Judges 7:3 Or Mount Gilead - Judges 7:6 MT places the words with their hands to their mouths after the word lapped . - Judges 7:8 Or the ones who lapped took the people ’ s supplies and trumpets for themselves .
CEB	Judges	8	8	From there he went up to Penuel and made the same request . And the people of Penuel responded in the same way the people of Succoth had .
CEB	Judges	8	2	But he said to them , “ What have I done now , compared to you ? Aren ’ t Ephraim ’ s leftovers better than Abiezer ’ s main harvest ?
CEB	Judges	8	3	God handed you the Midianite officers Oreb and Zeeb . What have I been able to do compared to you ? ” When he said this , their anger against him passed .
CEB	Judges	8	4	Then Gideon came to the Jordan . As he and the three hundred men with him crossed over , they were exhausted but still giving chase .
CEB	Judges	8	5	So he said to the people of Succoth , “ Please give some loaves of bread to those who are on foot , because they ’ re exhausted , but I ’ m chasing Zebah and Zalmunna , the kings of Midian. ”
CEB	Judges	8	6	But the officials of Succoth replied , “ Haven ’ t you already almost gotten your hands on Zebah and Zalmunna ? Why should we give food to your army now ? ”
CEB	Judges	8	7	“ Just for that , ” Gideon said , “ when the Lord has handed over Zebah and Zalmunna to me , I ’ m going to beat your skin with desert thorns and briars ! ”
CEB	Judges	8	9	So he also told the people of Penuel , “ When I return in victory , [ a ] I ’ ll break down this tower ! ”
CEB	Judges	8	10	Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor with their camp , about fifteen thousand men , all the ones who were left from the easterners ’ entire camp . One hundred twenty thousand armed men had fallen .
CEB	Judges	8	11	Gideon marched up the caravan road [ b ] east of Nobah and Jogbehah , and attacked the camp while it was off-guard .
CEB	Judges	8	12	Zebah and Zalmunna fled , and he chased after them . He captured the two Midianite kings Zebah and Zalmunna and threw the entire army into panic .
CEB	Judges	8	13	Then Gideon , Joash ’ s son , returned from the battle by the Heres Pass .
CEB	Judges	8	14	He captured a young man from the people of Succoth and interrogated him . He listed for Gideon the seventy-seven officials and elders of Succoth .
CEB	Judges	8	15	So Gideon went to the people of Succoth and said , “ Here are Zebah and Zalmunna ! You made fun of me because of them by saying , ‘ Haven ’ t you already almost gotten your hands on Zebah and Zalmunna ? Why should we give food to your exhausted men now ? ’ ”
CEB	Judges	8	16	Then he seized the city ’ s elders , and he beat [ c ] the people of Succoth with desert thorns and briars .
CEB	Judges	8	17	He also broke down Penuel ’ s tower , and killed the city ’ s people .
CEB	Judges	8	18	Then he asked Zebah and Zalmunna , “ What kind of men were those whom you killed at Tabor ? ” They replied , “ They were just like you ; each one looked like a king ’ s son. ”
CEB	Judges	8	19	“ They were my brothers , ” Gideon said , “ my own mother ’ s sons . As surely as the Lord lives , I promise that if you had let them live , I wouldn ’ t kill you ! ”
CEB	Judges	8	20	So he ordered his oldest son Jether , “ Stand up and kill them. ” But the young man didn ’ t draw his sword because he was afraid , since he was still young .
CEB	Judges	8	21	So Zebah and Zalmunna said , “ You stand up and strike us yourself , because as they say , ‘ A man is measured by his strength ! ’ ” So Gideon stood up and killed Zebah and Zalmunna , and took the crescents that were on their camels ’ necks . Gideon ’ s request
CEB	Judges	8	22	Then the Israelites said to Gideon , “ Rule over us , you and then your son and then your grandson , because you ’ ve rescued us from Midian ’ s power. ”
CEB	Judges	8	23	Gideon replied to them , “ I ’ m not the one who will rule over you , and my son won ’ t rule over you either . The Lord rules over you. ”
CEB	Judges	8	24	But Gideon said to them , “ May I make one request of you ? Everyone give me the earrings from their loot ” ; the Midianites had worn gold earrings because they were Ishmaelites .
CEB	Judges	8	25	“ We ’ ll gladly give them , ” they replied . And they spread out a piece of cloth , and everyone pitched in the earrings from their loot .
CEB	Judges	8	26	The weight of the gold earrings that he requested was one thousand seven hundred shekels of gold , not counting the crescents , the pendants , and the purple robes worn by the Midianite kings , or the collars that were on their camels ’ necks .
CEB	Judges	8	27	Gideon fashioned a priestly vest [ d ] out of it , and put it in his hometown of Ophrah . All Israel became unfaithful there because of it , and it became a trap for Gideon and his household .
CEB	Judges	8	28	So Midian was brought down before the Israelites and no longer raised its head . The land was peaceful for forty years during Gideon ’ s time . Gideon ’ s death
CEB	Judges	8	29	Jerubbaal , Joash ’ s son , went home to live with his own household .
CEB	Judges	8	30	Gideon had seventy sons of his own because he had many wives .
CEB	Judges	8	31	His secondary wife who was in Shechem also bore him a son , and he named him Abimelech .
CEB	Judges	8	32	Gideon , Joash ’ s son , died at a good old age and was buried in the tomb of his father Joash in Ophrah of the Abiezrites .
CEB	Judges	8	33	Right after Gideon died , the Israelites once again acted unfaithfully by worshipping the Baals , setting up Baal-berith as their god .
CEB	Judges	8	34	The people of Israel didn ’ t remember the Lord their God , who had delivered them from the power of all their enemies on every side .
CEB	Judges	8	35	Nor did they act loyally toward the household of Jerubbaal , that is , Gideon , in return for all the good that he had done on Israel ’ s behalf . Footnotes - Judges 8:9 Or in peace - Judges 8:11 Or the road of the tent dwellers - Judges 8:16 Cf 8:7 , cf LXX ; MT he taught a lesson to - Judges 8:27 Heb ephod
CEB	Judges	9	9	“ But the olive tree replied to them , ‘ Should I stop producing my oil , which is how gods and humans are honored , so that I can go to sway over the trees ? ’
CEB	Judges	9	2	“ Ask all the leaders of Shechem , ‘ Which do you think is better to have ruling over you : seventy men—all of Jerubbaal ’ s sons—or one man ? ’ And remember that I ’ m your flesh and blood ! ”
CEB	Judges	9	3	So his mother ’ s brothers spoke all these words on his behalf to all the leaders of Shechem . They decided to follow Abimelech because they said , “ He ’ s our relative. ”
CEB	Judges	9	4	They gave him seventy pieces of silver from the temple of Baal-berith , with which Abimelech hired worthless and reckless men , who became his posse .
CEB	Judges	9	5	He went to his household in Ophrah and killed all seventy of his brothers , Jerubbaal ’ s sons , on a single stone . Only Jotham the youngest of Jerubbaal ’ s sons survived , because he had hidden himself .
CEB	Judges	9	6	Then all the leaders of Shechem and all Beth-millo assembled and proceeded to make Abimelech king by the oak at the stone pillar [ a ] in Shechem . Jotham ’ s fable
CEB	Judges	9	7	When Jotham was told about this , he went and stood on the top of Mount Gerizim . He raised his voice and called out , “ Listen to me , you leaders of Shechem , so that God may listen to you !
CEB	Judges	9	8	“ Once the trees went out to anoint a king over themselves . So they said to the olive tree , ‘ Be our king ! ’
CEB	Judges	9	10	“ So the trees said to the fig tree , ‘ You come and be king over us ! ’
CEB	Judges	9	11	“ The fig tree replied to them , ‘ Should I stop producing my sweetness and my delicious fruit , so that I can go to sway over the trees ? ’
CEB	Judges	9	12	“ Then the trees said to the vine , ‘ You come and be king over us ! ’
CEB	Judges	9	13	“ But the vine replied to them , ‘ Should I stop providing my wine that makes gods and humans happy , so that I can go to sway over the trees ? ’
CEB	Judges	9	14	“ Finally , all the trees said to the thornbush , ‘ You come and be king over us ! ’
CEB	Judges	9	15	“ And the thornbush replied to the trees , ‘ If you ’ re acting faithfully in anointing me king over you , come and take shelter in my shade ; but if not , let fire come out of the thornbush and burn up the cedars of Lebanon. ’
CEB	Judges	9	16	“ So now , if you acted faithfully and innocently when you made Abimelech king , and if you ’ ve done right by Jerubbaal and his household , and have treated him as his actions deserve—
CEB	Judges	9	17	my father fought for you and risked his life to rescue you from Midian ’ s power ,
CEB	Judges	9	18	but today you ’ ve risen up against my father ’ s household , killed his seventy sons on a single stone , and made Abimelech , his female servant ’ s son , king over the leaders of Shechem , because he ’ s your relative—
CEB	Judges	9	19	so if you ’ ve acted faithfully and innocently toward Jerubbaal and his household today , then be happy with Abimelech and let him be happy with you .
CEB	Judges	9	20	But if not , let fire come out from Abimelech and burn up the leaders of Shechem and Beth-millo ; and let fire come out from the leaders of Shechem and Beth-millo and burn up Abimelech. ”
CEB	Judges	9	21	Then Jotham ran away . He fled to Beer and stayed there for fear of his brother Abimelech . Abimelech ’ s monarchy fails
CEB	Judges	9	22	Abimelech ruled over Israel for three years .
CEB	Judges	9	23	Then God stirred up ill will between Abimelech and the leaders of Shechem , and they acted like traitors toward Abimelech .
CEB	Judges	9	24	This occurred because of the violence done to Jerubbaal ’ s seventy sons . Their blood came back on their brother Abimelech , who killed them , and on the leaders of Shechem , who supported him when he killed his brothers .
CEB	Judges	9	25	As an act against him , the leaders of Shechem set ambushes on the hilltops that robbed everyone who passed by them on the road . This was reported to Abimelech .
CEB	Judges	9	26	Then Gaal , Ebed ’ s son , and his relatives came passing through Shechem , and the leaders of Shechem shifted their allegiance to him .
CEB	Judges	9	27	They went out into the field , cut off clusters from their vineyards , trampled them out , and had a celebration . They entered their god ’ s temple and ate , drank , and made fun of Abimelech .
CEB	Judges	9	28	Gaal , Ebed ’ s son , said , “ Who is Abimelech , and who are we of Shechem that we ought to serve him ? Didn ’ t this son of Jerubbaal and his deputy Zebul once serve the men of Hamor , Shechem ’ s father ? Why should we of all people serve him ?
CEB	Judges	9	29	If only this people were under my command ! I would push Abimelech aside ! I [ b ] would tell Abimelech , ‘ Build up your army and march out for battle. ’ ”
CEB	Judges	9	30	When Zebul the city ’ s ruler heard the words of Gaal , Ebed ’ s son , he became angry .
CEB	Judges	9	31	He sent messengers to Abimelech at Arumah [ c ] to say , “ Watch out ! Gaal , Ebed ’ s son , and his relatives have come to Shechem and are stirring up the city against you .
CEB	Judges	9	32	Now , you and the men who are with you : Get up tonight and set an ambush in the fields .
CEB	Judges	9	33	Then in the morning , at sunrise , rise early and rush on the city . Just as he and the men with him are marching out to face you , you can do to him whatever you wish. ”
CEB	Judges	9	34	So Abimelech and all the men who were with him got up that night and set an ambush around Shechem in four companies .
CEB	Judges	9	35	When Gaal , Ebed ’ s son , came out and stood in the entrance of the city ’ s gate , Abimelech and the men with him sprang up from the ambush .
CEB	Judges	9	36	Gaal saw the men and said to Zebul , “ Look ! People are coming down from the hilltops. ” Zebul replied to him , “ The shadows on the hills just look like persons to you. ”
CEB	Judges	9	37	But Gaal spoke up again , “ Look ! People are coming down from Tabbur-erez , and one company is coming from the direction of Elon-meonenim. ” [ d ]
CEB	Judges	9	38	Then Zebul replied to him , “ Where ’ s all your talk now , you who said , ‘ Who is Abimelech that we ought to serve him ? ’ Aren ’ t these the men you despised ? Now march out and fight them ! ”
CEB	Judges	9	39	So Gaal marched out at the head of the leaders of Shechem and fought with Abimelech .
CEB	Judges	9	40	Abimelech routed him , and he ran away . Many fell wounded , all the way up to the entrance of the gate .
CEB	Judges	9	41	Afterward , Abimelech stayed in Arumah , and Zebul drove away Gaal and his relatives so they couldn ’ t stay in Shechem .
CEB	Judges	9	42	The next day , the men of Shechem went out into the fields . When it was reported to Abimelech ,
CEB	Judges	9	43	he took his men , divided them into three companies , and set an ambush in the fields . As soon as he saw the men coming from the city , he sprang upon them and attacked them .
CEB	Judges	9	44	Abimelech and his company charged forward and took a position at the entrance of the city ’ s gate , while the other two companies charged at all those in the fields and attacked them .
CEB	Judges	9	45	Abimelech fought against the city that entire day . He captured the city and killed its people . Then he leveled the city and scattered salt over it .
CEB	Judges	9	46	When all the leaders in the Tower of Shechem heard about this , they entered the side rooms in the El-berith temple .
CEB	Judges	9	47	It was reported to Abimelech that all the leaders from the Tower of Shechem had gathered in one place .
CEB	Judges	9	48	So Abimelech and all the men who were with him went up on Mount Zalmon . He grabbed an ax , cut off a bundle of branches , and hoisted them onto his shoulder . Then he ordered the men who were with him , “ Hurry up and do what you ’ ve seen me do ! ”
CEB	Judges	9	49	Each one of the men cut off a bundle as well and followed Abimelech . They piled them up against the side rooms and set fire to the side rooms above them . So all the people in the Tower of Shechem died too , about one thousand men and women .
CEB	Judges	9	50	Then Abimelech moved on to Thebez , set up camp against it , and captured it .
CEB	Judges	9	51	But there was a strong tower inside the city . All the men and women and all the city ’ s leaders had fled there , shut themselves inside , and climbed to the tower ’ s roof .
CEB	Judges	9	52	Abimelech came to the tower to storm it . But when he approached the tower ’ s entrance to set it on fire ,
CEB	Judges	9	53	a woman dropped an upper millstone on Abimelech ’ s head and cracked his skull .
CEB	Judges	9	54	He quickly cried out to the servant who carried his armor , “ Draw your sword and kill me . Don ’ t let it be said of me , ‘ A woman killed him. ’ ” So his servant stabbed him , and he died .
CEB	Judges	9	55	When the Israelites saw that Abimelech was dead , they all went home .
CEB	Judges	9	56	Thus God paid back Abimelech for the evil he had done to his father by killing his seventy brothers .
CEB	Judges	9	57	God also paid back the people of Shechem for their evil . The curse of Jotham , Jerubbaal ’ s son , had come upon them . Footnotes - Judges 9:6 Heb uncertain - Judges 9:29 LXX ; MT he - Judges 9:31 Cf 9:41 ; Heb Tormah - Judges 9:37 Or the Diviners ’ Oak
CEB	Judges	10	10	Then the Israelites cried out to the Lord , “ We ’ ve sinned against you , for we went away from our God and served the Baals. ”
CEB	Judges	10	2	For twenty-three years he led Israel ; then he died and was buried in Shamir .
CEB	Judges	10	3	After Tola , Jair from Gilead arose , and he led Israel for twenty-two years .
CEB	Judges	10	4	He had thirty sons who were mounted on thirty donkeys and controlled thirty towns in the land of Gilead—these are still known as Havvoth-jair today .
CEB	Judges	10	5	When Jair died , he was buried in Kamon . Israel ’ s unfaithfulness and oppression by the Ammonites
CEB	Judges	10	6	Then the Israelites again did things that the Lord saw as evil . They served the Baals and the Astartes , as well as the gods of Aram , Sidon , Moab , the Ammonites , and the Philistines . They went away from the Lord and didn ’ t serve him .
CEB	Judges	10	7	The Lord became angry with Israel and handed them over to the Philistines and the Ammonites .
CEB	Judges	10	8	Starting that year and for the next eighteen years , they beat and bullied the Israelites , especially all the Israelites who lived on the east side of Jordan in the territory of the Ammonites in Gilead .
CEB	Judges	10	9	The Ammonites also crossed the Jordan to make raids into Judah , Benjamin , and the households of Ephraim . So Israel was greatly distressed .
CEB	Judges	10	11	The Lord replied to the Israelites , “ When the Egyptians , Amorites , Ammonites , Philistines ,
CEB	Judges	10	12	Sidonians , Amalekites , and Maonites oppressed you and you cried out to me , didn ’ t I rescue you from their power ?
CEB	Judges	10	13	But you have gone away from me and served other gods , so I won ’ t rescue you anymore !
CEB	Judges	10	14	Go cry out to the gods you ’ ve chosen . Let them rescue you in the time of your distress. ”
CEB	Judges	10	15	The Israelites responded to the Lord , “ We ’ ve sinned . Do to us whatever you see as right , but please save us this time. ”
CEB	Judges	10	16	They put away the foreign gods from among them and served the Lord . And the Lord could no longer stand to see Israel suffer .
CEB	Judges	10	17	The Ammonites called out their army and made camp in Gilead , while the Israelites gathered and set up their camp at Mizpah .
CEB	Judges	10	18	Gilead ’ s rulers said to each other , “ Whoever is willing to launch the attack against the Ammonites will become the leader over all those living in Gilead . ”
CEB	Judges	11	11	So Jephthah went with Gilead ’ s elders , and the people made him leader and commander over them . At Mizpah before the Lord , Jephthah repeated everything he had said .
CEB	Judges	11	2	Gilead ’ s wife gave birth to other sons for him , and when his wife ’ s sons grew up , they drove Jephthah away . They told him , “ You won ’ t get an inheritance in our father ’ s household because you ’ re a different woman ’ s son. ”
CEB	Judges	11	3	So Jephthah ran away from his brothers and lived in the land of Tob . Worthless men gathered around Jephthah and became his posse .
CEB	Judges	11	4	Sometime afterward , the Ammonites made war against Israel .
CEB	Judges	11	5	And when the Ammonites attacked Israel , Gilead ’ s elders went to bring Jephthah back from the land of Tob .
CEB	Judges	11	6	They said to him , “ Come be our commander so we can fight against the Ammonites. ”
CEB	Judges	11	7	But Jephthah replied to Gilead ’ s elders , “ Aren ’ t you the ones who hated me and drove me away from my father ’ s household ? Why are you coming to me now when you ’ re in trouble ? ”
CEB	Judges	11	8	Gilead ’ s elders answered Jephthah , “ That may be , but now we ’ re turning back to you , so come with us and fight the Ammonites . Then you ’ ll become the leader over us and everyone who lives in Gilead. ”
CEB	Judges	11	9	And Jephthah said to Gilead ’ s elders , “ If you bring me back to fight the Ammonites and the Lord gives them over to me , I alone will be your leader. ”
CEB	Judges	11	10	Gilead ’ s elders replied to him , “ The Lord is our witness ; we will surely do what you ’ ve said. ”
CEB	Judges	11	12	Then Jephthah sent messengers to the Ammonite king , saying , “ What is the problem between us that you ’ ve come against me to make war in my land ? ”
CEB	Judges	11	13	The Ammonite king responded to Jephthah ’ s messengers , “ When the Israelites were coming up from Egypt , they seized my land from the Arnon to the Jabbok and all the way to the Jordan . Now give it back peacefully ! ”
CEB	Judges	11	14	Then Jephthah again sent messengers to the Ammonite king
CEB	Judges	11	15	and said to him , “ Jephthah states : Israel didn ’ t seize the land of the Moabites or the land of the Ammonites .
CEB	Judges	11	16	When they were coming up from Egypt , the Israelites went through the desert to the Reed Sea [ a ] and came to Kadesh .
CEB	Judges	11	17	Then the Israelites sent messengers to the king of Edom , saying , ‘ Please allow us to pass through your land ’ ; but the Edomite king refused . They sent the same request to the king of Moab , and he was unwilling . So the Israelites stayed at Kadesh .
CEB	Judges	11	18	“ Later they journeyed into the desert but went around the lands of Edom and Moab , arriving on the east side of the land of Moab and setting up camp on the other side of the Arnon . They never entered Moabite territory , because the Arnon was the boundary of Moab .
CEB	Judges	11	19	Then the Israelites sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites and king of Heshbon and said to him , ‘ Please allow us to pass through your land to our own place. ’
CEB	Judges	11	20	Yet Sihon didn ’ t trust the Israelites to pass through his territory . He assembled his entire army , set up camp at Jahaz , and went to war with the Israelites .
CEB	Judges	11	21	The Lord , Israel ’ s God , handed over Sihon and his entire army to the Israelites , and they defeated Sihon . So the Israelites took possession of all the land of the Amorites who were living in that area .
CEB	Judges	11	22	They took possession of all the Amorite territory from the Arnon to the Jabbok and from the desert to the Jordan .
CEB	Judges	11	23	“ So now that the Lord , Israel ’ s God , has driven out the Amorites before his people Israel , will you take possession of their land ?
CEB	Judges	11	24	Shouldn ’ t you possess what Chemosh your god has given you to possess ? And shouldn ’ t we possess everything that the Lord our God has given us to possess ?
CEB	Judges	11	25	Do you now have a better case than Moab ’ s King Balak , Zippor ’ s son ? Did he make an accusation against the Israelites or go to war with them ?
CEB	Judges	11	26	Why didn ’ t you take back this territory while the Israelites lived in Heshbon and its villages , in Aroer and its villages , and in all the towns along the branches of the Arnon for three hundred years ?
CEB	Judges	11	27	I haven ’ t sinned against you , but you ’ re doing me wrong by making war against me . Let the Lord , who is the judge , decide today between the Israelites and the Ammonites ! ”
CEB	Judges	11	28	But the Ammonite king refused to listen to the message that Jephthah sent to him . Jephthah ’ s promise
CEB	Judges	11	29	Then the Lord ’ s spirit came on Jephthah . He passed through Gilead and Manasseh , then through Mizpah in Gilead , and from there he crossed over to the Ammonites .
CEB	Judges	11	30	Jephthah made a solemn promise to the Lord : “ If you will decisively hand over the Ammonites to me ,
CEB	Judges	11	31	then whatever comes out the doors of my house to meet me when I return victorious from the Ammonites will be given over to the Lord . I will sacrifice it as an entirely burned offering. ”
CEB	Judges	11	32	Jephthah crossed over to fight the Ammonites , and the Lord handed them over to him .
CEB	Judges	11	33	It was an exceptionally great defeat ; he defeated twenty towns from Aroer to the area of Minnith , and on as far as Abel-keramim . So the Ammonites were brought down before the Israelites .
CEB	Judges	11	34	But when Jephthah came to his house in Mizpah , it was his daughter who came out to meet him with tambourines and dancing ! She was an only child ; he had no other son or daughter except her .
CEB	Judges	11	35	When he saw her , he tore his clothes and said , “ Oh no ! My daughter ! You have brought me to my knees ! You are my agony ! For I opened my mouth to the Lord , and I can ’ t take it back. ”
CEB	Judges	11	36	But she replied to him , “ My father , you ’ ve opened your mouth to the Lord , so you should do to me just what you ’ ve promised . After all , the Lord has carried out just punishment for you on your enemies the Ammonites. ”
CEB	Judges	11	37	Then she said to her father , “ Let this one thing be done for me : hold off for two months and let me and my friends wander the hills in sadness , crying over the fact that I never had children. ”
CEB	Judges	11	38	“ Go , ” he responded , and he sent her away for two months . She and her friends walked on the hills and cried because she would never have children .
CEB	Judges	11	39	When two months had passed , she returned to her father , and he did to her what he had promised . She had not known a man intimately . But she gave rise to a tradition in Israel where
CEB	Judges	11	40	for four days every year Israelite daughters would go away to recount the story of the Gileadite Jephthah ’ s daughter . Footnotes - Judges 11:16 Or Red Sea
CEB	Judges	12	12	Then Elon the Zebulunite died and was buried in Aijalon in the land of Zebulun .
CEB	Judges	12	2	Jephthah replied to them , “ My people and I were in a great conflict with the Ammonites . But when I cried out to you , you didn ’ t rescue me from their power .
CEB	Judges	12	3	When I saw that you weren ’ t going to rescue me , I risked my own life and crossed over against the Ammonites , and the Lord handed them over to me . So why have you marched against me today to fight me ? ”
CEB	Judges	12	4	So Jephthah gathered all the men of Gilead and fought the Ephraimites . The Gileadites defeated the Ephraimites , because they had said , “ You are fugitives from Ephraim ! Gilead stands within Ephraim and Manasseh. ”
CEB	Judges	12	5	The Gileadites took control of the Jordan ’ s crossing points into Ephraim . Whenever one of the Ephraimite fugitives said , “ Let me cross , ” the Gileadites would ask him , “ Are you an Ephraimite ? ” If he said , “ No , ”
CEB	Judges	12	6	they would tell him , “ Then say shibboleth. ” But he would say , “ sibboleth , ” because he couldn ’ t pronounce it correctly . So they would seize him and kill him at the Jordan ’ s crossing points . Forty-two thousand of the Ephraimites fell at that time .
CEB	Judges	12	7	Jephthah led Israel for six years . Then Jephthah the Gileadite died and was buried in one of the towns in Gilead . Ibzan , Elon , and Abdon
CEB	Judges	12	8	After Jephthah , Ibzan from Bethlehem led Israel .
CEB	Judges	12	9	He had thirty sons and thirty daughters . He married his thirty daughters to those outside his clan , and brought in thirty young women from outside for his sons . He led Israel for seven years .
CEB	Judges	12	10	Then Ibzan died and was buried in Bethlehem .
CEB	Judges	12	11	After Ibzan , Elon from Zebulun led Israel ; he did so for ten years .
CEB	Judges	12	13	After Elon , Abdon , Hillel ’ s son from Pirathon , led Israel .
CEB	Judges	12	14	He had forty sons and thirty grandsons mounted on seventy donkeys . He led Israel for eight years .
CEB	Judges	12	15	Then Abdon , Hillel ’ s son from Pirathon , died and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim , in the Amalekite highlands .
CEB	Judges	13	13	The Lord ’ s messenger answered Manoah , “ The woman should be careful to do everything that I told her .
CEB	Judges	13	2	Now there was a certain man from Zorah , from the Danite clan , whose name was Manoah . His wife was unable to become pregnant and had not given birth to any children .
CEB	Judges	13	3	The Lord ’ s messenger appeared to the woman and said to her , “ Even though you ’ ve been unable to become pregnant and haven ’ t given birth , you are now pregnant and will give birth to a son !
CEB	Judges	13	4	Now be careful not to drink wine or brandy or to eat anything that is ritually unclean ,
CEB	Judges	13	5	because you are pregnant and will give birth to a son . Don ’ t allow a razor to shave his head , because the boy is going to be a nazirite for God from birth . He ’ ll be the one who begins Israel ’ s rescue from the power of the Philistines. ”
CEB	Judges	13	6	Then the woman went and told her husband , “ A man of God came to me , and he looked like God ’ s messenger—very scary ! I didn ’ t ask him where he was from , and he didn ’ t tell me his name .
CEB	Judges	13	7	He said to me , ‘ You are pregnant and will give birth to a son , so don ’ t drink wine or brandy or eat anything that is ritually unclean , because the boy is going to be a nazirite for God from birth until the day he dies. ’ ”
CEB	Judges	13	8	Manoah asked the Lord , “ Please , my Lord , ” he said , “ let the man of God whom you sent come back to us once more , so he can teach us how we should treat the boy who is to be born. ”
CEB	Judges	13	9	God listened to Manoah , and God ’ s messenger came once more to the woman . She was sitting in the field , but her husband Manoah wasn ’ t with her .
CEB	Judges	13	10	So the woman hurriedly ran and informed her husband . She said to him , “ The man who came to me the other day has just appeared to me. ”
CEB	Judges	13	11	Manoah got up and followed his wife . He came to the man and said to him , “ Are you the man who spoke to this woman ? ” “ I am , ” he replied .
CEB	Judges	13	12	Manoah said , “ Now when your words come true , what should be the rules for the boy and how he should act ? ”
CEB	Judges	13	14	She must not consume anything that comes from the grapevine , drink wine or brandy , or eat anything that is ritually unclean . She must be careful to do everything I have commanded her. ”
CEB	Judges	13	15	Manoah said to the Lord ’ s messenger , “ Please let us persuade you to stay so we can prepare a young goat for you. ”
CEB	Judges	13	16	But the Lord ’ s messenger replied to Manoah , “ If you persuaded me to stay , I wouldn ’ t eat your food . If you prepare an entirely burned offering , offer it to the Lord. ” Indeed , Manoah didn ’ t know that he was the Lord ’ s messenger .
CEB	Judges	13	17	Manoah said to the Lord ’ s messenger , “ What ’ s your name , so that we may honor you when your words come true ? ”
CEB	Judges	13	18	The Lord ’ s messenger responded to him , “ Why do you ask my name ? You couldn ’ t understand it. ”
CEB	Judges	13	19	So Manoah took a young goat and a grain offering and offered them on a rock to the Lord . While Manoah and his wife were looking , an amazing thing happened :
CEB	Judges	13	20	as the flame from the altar went up toward the sky , the Lord ’ s messenger went up in the altar ’ s flame . When Manoah and his wife saw this , they fell facedown on the ground .
CEB	Judges	13	21	The Lord ’ s messenger didn ’ t reappear to Manoah or his wife , and Manoah then realized that it had been the Lord ’ s messenger .
CEB	Judges	13	22	Manoah said to his wife , “ We are certainly going to die , because we ’ ve seen God ! ”
CEB	Judges	13	23	But his wife replied to him , “ If the Lord wanted to kill us , he wouldn ’ t have accepted the entirely burned offering and grain offering from our hands . He wouldn ’ t have shown us all these things or told us all of this now. ”
CEB	Judges	13	24	The woman gave birth to a son and named him Samson . The boy grew up , and the Lord blessed him .
CEB	Judges	13	25	The Lord ’ s spirit began to move him when he was in Mahaneh-dan , between Zorah and Eshtaol .
CEB	Judges	14	14	He said to them , “ Out of the eater there came something to eat . Out of the strong there came something sweet. ” For three days they couldn ’ t tell the answer to the riddle .
CEB	Judges	14	2	He went back home and told his father and mother , “ A Philistine woman in Timnah caught my eye ; now get her for me as a wife ! ”
CEB	Judges	14	3	But his father and mother replied to him , “ Is there no woman among your own relatives or among all our people that you have to go get a wife from the uncircumcised Philistines ? ” Yet Samson said to his father , “ Get her for me , because she ’ s the one I want ! ”
CEB	Judges	14	4	His father and mother didn ’ t know that the Lord was behind this . He was looking for an opening with the Philistines , because they were ruling over Israel at that time .
CEB	Judges	14	5	Then Samson traveled down to Timnah with his father and mother . When he came to the vineyards in Timnah , suddenly a lone young lion came roaring to meet him .
CEB	Judges	14	6	The Lord ’ s spirit rushed over him , and he tore the lion apart with his bare hands as one might tear apart a young goat . But he didn ’ t tell his father or mother what he had done .
CEB	Judges	14	7	Then he traveled down and talked with the woman ; she was the one Samson wanted .
CEB	Judges	14	8	After a while , he came back again to marry her . He turned aside to look at the lion ’ s remains , and there was a swarm of bees with honey inside the lion ’ s skeleton .
CEB	Judges	14	9	He scooped the honey into his hands , eating it as he continued along . When he got to his father and mother , he gave some to them , and they ate it too . But he didn ’ t tell them that he had scooped the honey from the lion ’ s skeleton .
CEB	Judges	14	10	His father traveled down to the woman , and Samson put on a feast there , as was the custom for young men .
CEB	Judges	14	11	When the townspeople saw him , they selected thirty companions to be with him .
CEB	Judges	14	12	Then Samson said to them , “ Let me tell you a riddle . If you can figure it out and tell me the answer within the seven days of the feast , I ’ ll give you thirty linen robes and thirty sets of clothes .
CEB	Judges	14	13	But if you can ’ t tell me the answer , then it ’ s you who have to give me thirty linen robes and thirty sets of clothes. ” So they replied to him , “ Tell your riddle ; let ’ s hear it. ”
CEB	Judges	14	15	On the fourth [ a ] day they said to Samson ’ s wife , “ Seduce your husband so he ’ ll tell us the answer to the riddle , or else we ’ ll set fire to you and your household . Were we invited here just to become poor ? ”
CEB	Judges	14	16	So Samson ’ s wife cried on his shoulder and said , “ You hate me ! You don ’ t love me ! You told a riddle to my people but didn ’ t tell me the answer. ” He replied to her , “ Look , I haven ’ t even told the answer to my father and mother . Why should I tell it to you ? ”
CEB	Judges	14	17	But she cried on his shoulder for the rest of the seven days of the feast . Finally , on the seventh day , he told her the answer , for she had nagged him . And she told her people the answer to the riddle .
CEB	Judges	14	18	So on the seventh day , before the sun set , the townspeople said to him , “ What ’ s sweeter than honey ? What ’ s stronger than a lion ? ” He replied to them , “ If you hadn ’ t plowed with my heifer , you wouldn ’ t have figured out my riddle ! ”
CEB	Judges	14	19	Then the Lord ’ s spirit rushed over him , and he went down to Ashkelon . He killed thirty of their men , stripped them of their gear , and gave the sets of clothes to the ones who had told the answer to the riddle . In anger , he went back up to his father ’ s household .
CEB	Judges	14	20	And Samson ’ s wife married one of those who had been his companions . Footnotes - Judges 14:15 LXX , Syr ; MT seventh
CEB	Judges	15	15	He found a donkey ’ s fresh jawbone , picked it up , and used it to attack one thousand men .
CEB	Judges	15	2	Her father said , “ I was so sure that you had completely rejected her that I gave her in marriage to one of your companions . Don ’ t you think her younger sister is even better ? Let her be your wife instead. ”
CEB	Judges	15	3	Samson replied , “ No one can blame me now for being ready to bring down trouble on the Philistines ! ”
CEB	Judges	15	4	Then Samson went and caught three hundred foxes . He took torches , turned the foxes tail to tail , and put a torch between each pair of tails .
CEB	Judges	15	5	He lit the torches and released the foxes into the Philistines ’ grain fields . So he burned the stacked grain , standing grain , vineyards , and olive orchards .
CEB	Judges	15	6	The Philistines inquired , “ Who did this ? ” So it was reported , “ Samson the Timnite ’ s son-in-law did it , because his father-in-law gave his wife in marriage to one of his companions. ” So the Philistines went up and burned her and her father to death .
CEB	Judges	15	7	Samson then responded to them , “ If this is how you act , then I won ’ t stop until I get revenge on you ! ”
CEB	Judges	15	8	He struck them hard , taking their legs right out from under them . [ a ] Then he traveled down and stayed in a cave in the rock at Etam .
CEB	Judges	15	9	The Philistines marched up , made camp in Judah , and released their forces on Lehi .
CEB	Judges	15	10	The people of Judah asked , “ Why have you marched up against us ? ” “ We ’ ve marched up to take Samson prisoner , ” they replied , “ and to do to him just what he did to us. ”
CEB	Judges	15	11	So three thousand people from Judah traveled down to the cave in the rock at Etam and said to Samson , “ Don ’ t you realize that the Philistines rule over us ? What have you done to us ? ” But he told them , “ I did to them just what they did to me. ”
CEB	Judges	15	12	Then the people of Judah said to him , “ We ’ ve come down to take you prisoner so we can turn you over to the Philistines. ” Samson responded to them , “ Just promise that you won ’ t attack me yourselves. ”
CEB	Judges	15	13	“ We won ’ t , ” they said to him . “ We ’ ll only take you prisoner so we can turn you over to them . We won ’ t kill you. ” Then they tied him up with two new ropes , and brought him up from the rock .
CEB	Judges	15	14	When Samson arrived at Lehi , the Philistines met him and came out shouting . The Lord ’ s spirit rushed over him , the ropes on his arms became like burned-up linen , and the ties melted right off his hands .
CEB	Judges	15	16	Samson said , “ With a donkey ’ s jawbone , stacks on stacks ! With a donkey ’ s jawbone , I ’ ve killed one thousand men. ”
CEB	Judges	15	17	When he finished speaking , he tossed away the jawbone . So that place became known as Ramath-lehi . [ b ]
CEB	Judges	15	18	Now Samson was very thirsty , so he called out to the Lord , “ You are the one who allowed this great victory to be accomplished by your servant ’ s hands . Am I now going to die of thirst and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised ? ”
CEB	Judges	15	19	So God split open the hollow rock in Lehi , and water flowed out of it . When Samson drank , his energy returned and he was recharged . Thus that place is still called by the name En-hakkore [ c ] in Lehi today .
CEB	Judges	15	20	Samson led Israel for twenty years during the time of the Philistines . Footnotes - Judges 15:8 Or struck them hip and thigh - Judges 15:17 Or Jawbone Hill - Judges 15:19 Or Caller ’ s Spring
CEB	Judges	16	16	She nagged him with her words day after day and begged him until he became worn out to the point of death .
CEB	Judges	16	2	The word spread [ a ] among the people of Gaza , “ Samson has come here ! ” So they circled around and waited in ambush for him all night at the city gate . They kept quiet all night long , thinking , We ’ ll kill him at the first light in the morning .
CEB	Judges	16	3	But Samson slept only half the night . He got up in the middle of the night , grabbed the doors of the city gate and the two gateposts , and pulled them up with the bar still across them . He put them on his shoulders and carried them up to the top of the hill that is beside Hebron . Samson and Delilah
CEB	Judges	16	4	Some time after this , in the Sorek Valley , Samson fell in love with a woman whose name was Delilah .
CEB	Judges	16	5	The rulers of the Philistines confronted her and said to her , “ Seduce him and find out what gives him such great strength and what we can do to overpower him , so that we can tie him up and make him weak . Then we ’ ll each pay you eleven hundred pieces of silver. ”
CEB	Judges	16	6	So Delilah said to Samson , “ Please tell me what gives you such great strength and how you can be tied up and made weak. ”
CEB	Judges	16	7	Samson replied to her , “ If someone ties me up with seven fresh bowstrings that aren ’ t dried out , I ’ ll become weak . I ’ ll be like any other person. ”
CEB	Judges	16	8	So the rulers of the Philistines brought her seven fresh bowstrings that weren ’ t dried out , and she tied him up with them .
CEB	Judges	16	9	While an ambush was waiting for her signal in an inner room , she called out to him , “ Samson , the Philistines are on you ! ” And he snapped the bowstrings like a thread of fiber snaps when it touches a flame . So the secret of his strength remained unknown .
CEB	Judges	16	10	Then Delilah said to Samson , “ You made a fool out of me and lied to me . Now please tell me how you can really be tied up ! ”
CEB	Judges	16	11	He replied to her , “ If someone ties me up with new ropes that haven ’ t been used for work , I ’ ll become weak . I ’ ll be like any other person. ”
CEB	Judges	16	12	So Delilah took new ropes and tied him up with them . Then she called out to him , “ Samson , the Philistines are on you ! ” Once again , an ambush was waiting in an inner room . Yet he snapped them from his arms like thread .
CEB	Judges	16	13	And Delilah said to Samson , “ Up to now , you ’ ve made a fool out of me and lied to me . Tell me how you can be tied up ! ” He responded to her , “ If you weave the seven braids of my hair into the fabric on a loom and pull it tight with a pin , then I ’ ll become weak . I ’ ll be like any other person. ” [ b ]
CEB	Judges	16	14	So she got him to fall asleep , wove the seven braids of his hair into the fabric on a loom , [ c ] and pulled it tight with a pin . Then she called out to him , “ Samson , the Philistines are on you ! ” He woke up from his sleep and pulled loose the pin , the loom , and the fabric .
CEB	Judges	16	15	Delilah said to him , “ How can you say , ‘ I love you , ’ when you won ’ t trust me ? Three times now you ’ ve made a fool out of me and not told me what gives you such great strength ! ”
CEB	Judges	16	17	So he told her his whole secret . He said to her , “ No razor has ever touched my head , because I ’ ve been a nazirite for God from the time I was born . If my head is shaved , my strength will leave me , and I ’ ll become weak . I ’ ll be like every other person. ”
CEB	Judges	16	18	When Delilah realized that he had told her his whole secret , she sent word to the rulers of the Philistines , “ Come one more time , for he has told me his whole secret. ” The rulers of the Philistines came up to her and brought the silver with them .
CEB	Judges	16	19	She got him to fall asleep with his head on her lap . Then she called a man and had him shave off the seven braids of Samson ’ s hair . He began to weaken , [ d ] and his strength left him .
CEB	Judges	16	20	She called out , “ Samson , the Philistines are on you ! ” He woke up from his sleep and thought , I ’ ll escape just like the other times and shake myself free . But he didn ’ t realize that the Lord had left him .
CEB	Judges	16	21	So the Philistines captured him , put out his eyes , and took him down to Gaza . They bound him with bronze chains , and he worked the grinding mill in the prison .
CEB	Judges	16	22	But the hair on his head began to grow again right after it had been shaved . Samson ’ s death
CEB	Judges	16	23	The rulers of the Philistines gathered together to make a great sacrifice to their god Dagon and to hold a celebration . They cheered , “ Our god has handed us Samson our enemy ! ”
CEB	Judges	16	24	When the people saw him , they praised their god , for they said , “ Our god has handed us our enemy , the very one who devastated our land and killed so many of our people. ”
CEB	Judges	16	25	At the height of the celebration , [ e ] they said , “ Call for Samson so he can perform for us ! ” So they called Samson from the prison , and he performed in front of them . Then they had him stand between the pillars .
CEB	Judges	16	26	Samson said to the young man who led him by the hand , “ Put me where I can feel the pillars that hold up the temple , so I can lean on them. ”
CEB	Judges	16	27	Now the temple was filled with men and women . All the rulers of the Philistines were there , and about three thousand more men and women were on the roof watching as Samson performed .
CEB	Judges	16	28	Then Samson called out to the Lord , “ Lord God , please remember me ! Make me strong just this once more , God , so I can have revenge on the Philistines , just one act of revenge for my two eyes. ” [ f ]
CEB	Judges	16	29	Samson grabbed the two central pillars that held up the temple . He leaned against one with his right hand and the other with his left .
CEB	Judges	16	30	And Samson said , “ Let me die with the Philistines ! ” He strained with all his might , and the temple collapsed on the rulers and all the people who were in it . So it turned out that he killed more people in his death than he did during his life .
CEB	Judges	16	31	His brothers and his father ’ s entire household traveled down , carried him back up , and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of his father Manoah . He had led Israel for twenty years .

CEB	Judges	17	17	Once there was a man named Micah who lived in the Ephraim highlands .
CEB	Judges	17	2	He said to his mother , “ The eleven hundred pieces of silver that were taken from you led you to declare a curse and even to repeat it when I could hear . I have that silver . I ’ m the one who took it , and now I ’ ll give it back to you. ” [ a ] His mother replied , “ May the Lord bless you , my son ! ”
CEB	Judges	17	3	When he gave the eleven hundred pieces of silver back to his mother , she said , “ I wholeheartedly devote this silver to the Lord , to be made into a sculpted image and a molded image for my son. ”
CEB	Judges	17	4	So he gave the silver back to his mother , and she took two hundred pieces of silver and gave them to a silversmith , who used it for a sculpted image and a molded image . And they were placed in Micah ’ s house .
CEB	Judges	17	5	This man Micah had his own sanctuary . [ b ] He made a priestly vest [ c ] and divine images [ d ] and appointed one of his sons to be his personal priest .
CEB	Judges	17	6	In those days there was no king in Israel ; each person did what they thought to be right .
CEB	Judges	17	7	Now there was a young man from Bethlehem in Judah , from the area of the Judahite clan . He was a Levite residing there as an immigrant .
CEB	Judges	17	8	The man left the town of Bethlehem in Judah to settle as an immigrant wherever he could find a place . He came to Micah ’ s house in the Ephraim highlands while he was making his way . [ e ]
CEB	Judges	17	9	“ Where are you from ? ” Micah asked him . He replied , “ I ’ m a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah , and I ’ m looking to settle as an immigrant anywhere I can find a place. ”
CEB	Judges	17	10	So Micah said to him , “ Stay with me and be a father and a priest to me , and I ’ ll give you ten pieces of silver a year , a set of clothes , and your basic needs. ” [ f ]
CEB	Judges	17	11	The Levite agreed to stay with him ; and the young man became like one of his own sons .
CEB	Judges	17	12	Micah appointed the Levite so that the young man became his personal priest and lived in Micah ’ s sanctuary .
CEB	Judges	17	13	And Micah said to himself , Now I know that the Lord will give me good things , because a Levite has become my priest . Footnotes - Judges 17:2 The words and now I ’ ll give it back to you are relocated from the end of 17:3 in Heb . - Judges 17:5 Or god ’ s house - Judges 17:5 Heb ephod - Judges 17:5 Heb terafim - Judges 17:8 Or to carry on his work - Judges 17:10 Heb adds and the Levite went .
CEB	Judges	18	18	when these five entered Micah ’ s sanctuary and took the sculpted image , the priestly vest , the divine images , and the molded image . The priest said to them , “ What are you doing ? ”
CEB	Judges	18	2	The Danites sent five men from their whole clan , strong men from Zorah and Eshtaol , to spy on the land and explore it . They told them , “ Go explore the land. ” So they went into the Ephraim highland as far as Micah ’ s house , and they spent the night there .
CEB	Judges	18	3	When they were in the area of Micah ’ s house , they recognized the accent of the young Levite . They turned in there and said to him , “ Who brought you here ? What are you doing in these parts ? What is there for you here ? ”
CEB	Judges	18	4	“ Micah has done a lot for me , ” he replied to them . “ He hired me to be his personal priest. ”
CEB	Judges	18	5	They said to him , “ Ask for an answer from God so we can know whether we ’ ll be successful on this trip we ’ ve taken. ”
CEB	Judges	18	6	The priest replied to them , “ Go in peace . The Lord is watching over you on this trip you ’ ve taken. ”
CEB	Judges	18	7	So the five men journeyed on until they reached Laish . There they saw that its people were living without worry in the same way as the Sidonians , undisturbed and secure . Nobody held back anything in the land , so no one had to hoard . [ a ] Yet they lived far away from the Sidonians and had no dealings with anyone else . [ b ]
CEB	Judges	18	8	When the men came back to their relatives at Zorah and Eshtaol , they asked them , “ What did you find ? ”
CEB	Judges	18	9	“ Come on , ” they replied , “ let ’ s march up against them ! Indeed , we ’ ve seen the land , and it ’ s very good . Right now you ’ re doing nothing ! Don ’ t hold back from going and taking possession of the land .
CEB	Judges	18	10	When you arrive , you ’ ll come upon a secure people and a wide-open land , because God has given to you a place where nothing on earth is lacking. ”
CEB	Judges	18	11	At this , six hundred men from the Danite clan at Zorah and Eshtaol set out armed for battle .
CEB	Judges	18	12	They marched up and made camp at Kiriath-jearim in Judah . This is why the place west of Kiriath-jearim is still known as Dan ’ s Camp today .
CEB	Judges	18	13	From there they crossed into the Ephraim highlands and came to Micah ’ s house . Dan acquires a levitical priest
CEB	Judges	18	14	Then the five men who had gone to spy on the land around Laish reported to their relatives , “ Did you know that there is a priestly vest , divine images , a sculpted image , and a molded image in these buildings ? Now think about what you should do ! ”
CEB	Judges	18	15	So they turned in there and went to the young Levite ’ s house in Micah ’ s compound and greeted him .
CEB	Judges	18	16	While the six hundred Danites armed for battle stood at the entrance of the gate ,
CEB	Judges	18	17	the five men who had gone to spy on the land moved up , went inside , and took the sculpted image , the priestly vest , the divine images , and the molded image . The priest was standing at the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men armed for battle
CEB	Judges	18	19	“ Shut up ! ” they said to him . “ Put your hand over your mouth ! Come with us and be a father and a priest for us . Would you rather be a priest for one man ’ s household or a priest for a tribe and a clan in Israel ? ”
CEB	Judges	18	20	The priest was convinced , so he took the priestly vest , the divine images , and the sculpted image and went along with the people .
CEB	Judges	18	21	They headed back on their way , but they put the children , the livestock , and the prized possessions in front of them .
CEB	Judges	18	22	After they had gone a good distance away from Micah ’ s house , the men who were in the houses around Micah ’ s home were summoned for battle and caught up to the Danites .
CEB	Judges	18	23	They called out to the Danites , who turned around and said to Micah , “ Why have you summoned men for battle ? ”
CEB	Judges	18	24	Micah replied , “ You ’ ve taken my gods that I made , and the priest , and have gone off ! What do I have left ? How can you ask me what is wrong ? ”
CEB	Judges	18	25	But the Danites said to him , “ Don ’ t raise your voice with us or else hotheaded men will attack you , and you and your household will lose your lives. ”
CEB	Judges	18	26	Then the Danites went on their way . When Micah realized that they were too strong for him , he turned around and went home . The Danites take possession of Laish
CEB	Judges	18	27	The Danites took along the things that Micah had made , as well as the priest who had been with him , and came to Laish , to a people who were undisturbed and secure . They killed the people and burned down the city .
CEB	Judges	18	28	No one was there to rescue them because the city was far away from Sidon and had no dealings with anyone else . [ c ] It was in the Beth-rehob Valley . They rebuilt the city and settled in it .
CEB	Judges	18	29	They renamed the city Dan , after their ancestor Dan who had been one of Israel ’ s sons ; but in fact , the original name of the city was Laish .
CEB	Judges	18	30	The Danites set up the sculpted image for themselves , and Jonathan son of Gershom and grandson of Moses , [ d ] and his sons became priests for the Danite tribe until the land went into exile .
CEB	Judges	18	31	They kept for themselves the sculpted image that Micah had made throughout the whole time that God ’ s sanctuary was in Shiloh . Footnotes - Judges 18:7 Heb uncertain - Judges 18:7 Or with Aram - Judges 18:28 Or with Aram - Judges 18:30 Or Manasseh
CEB	Judges	19	19	We ’ ve got our own straw and feed for our donkeys , plus food and wine to provide for me , the woman , and my servant with us . We don ’ t need anything. ”
CEB	Judges	19	2	In an act of unfaithfulness toward him , his secondary wife left him and went back to her father ’ s household at Bethlehem in Judah . She stayed there four full months .
CEB	Judges	19	3	Then her husband set out after her to convince her to come back . He had his servant and a couple of donkeys with him . She took him into her father ’ s house , and when the young woman ’ s father saw him , he was happy to welcome him .
CEB	Judges	19	4	Since his father-in-law , the young woman ’ s father , insisted , he stayed with him three days , eating , drinking , and spending the night there .
CEB	Judges	19	5	On the fourth day , they got up early in the morning , and he got ready to set out . But the young woman ’ s father said to his son-in-law , “ Eat a little food to give you strength , and then you can go. ”
CEB	Judges	19	6	So the two of them sat down and ate and drank together . The young woman ’ s father said to the man , “ Why not spend the night and enjoy yourself ? ”
CEB	Judges	19	7	When the man got ready to set out , his father-in-law persuaded him , and he spent the night there again .
CEB	Judges	19	8	On the fifth day , he got up early in the morning to set out , and the young woman ’ s father said , “ Have some food for strength. ” So the two of them ate , sitting around until late in the day .
CEB	Judges	19	9	When the man got ready to set out with his secondary wife and servant , his father-in-law , the young woman ’ s father , said , “ Look , the day has turned to evening , so spend the night . Seriously , the day is over . Spend the night here and enjoy yourself . Then you can get up early tomorrow for your journey , and you can head home. ”
CEB	Judges	19	10	But the man was unwilling to spend another night . He got up , set out , and went as far as the area of Jebus , that is , Jerusalem . He had a couple of saddled donkeys and his secondary wife with him .
CEB	Judges	19	11	When they were near Jebus , the day was totally gone . The servant said to his master , “ Come on , let ’ s turn into this Jebusite city and spend the night in it. ”
CEB	Judges	19	12	But his master replied to him , “ We won ’ t turn into a city of foreigners who aren ’ t Israelites . We ’ ll travel on to Gibeah .
CEB	Judges	19	13	“ Come on , ” he said to his servant , “ let ’ s reach Gibeah or Ramah and spend the night in one of those places. ”
CEB	Judges	19	14	So they traveled on , and the sun set when they were near Gibeah in Benjamin .
CEB	Judges	19	15	They turned in to enter there , so they could spend the night in Gibeah , and he went and sat down in the city square . But no one offered to take them home to spend the night . Rape and murder at Gibeah
CEB	Judges	19	16	Then in the evening , an old man was coming home from his daily work in the fields . This man was from the Ephraim highlands and was an immigrant in Gibeah , the people of that place being Benjaminites .
CEB	Judges	19	17	He looked up and saw the traveler in the city square . “ Where are you heading and where have you come from ? ” the old man asked .
CEB	Judges	19	18	“ We ’ re traveling from Bethlehem in Judah to the far corners of the Ephraim highlands , ” he replied to the old man . “ That ’ s where I ’ m from . I went to Bethlehem in Judah , and I ’ m heading to my home . [ a ] But no one has offered to take me in tonight .
CEB	Judges	19	20	The old man answered , “ You ’ re welcome to stay with me , [ b ] but let me take care of all your needs . Just don ’ t spend the night in the square. ”
CEB	Judges	19	21	And he took him into his house . He mixed feed for the donkeys , and they washed their feet , ate , and drank .
CEB	Judges	19	22	While they were relaxing , suddenly the men of the city , a perverse bunch , surrounded the house and started pounding on the door . They said to the old man , the owner of the house , “ Send out the man who came to your house , so we can have sex with him ! ”
CEB	Judges	19	23	The owner of the house went outside and said to them , “ No , my friends , please don ’ t commit such an evil act , given that this man has come to my home as a guest . Don ’ t do this disgraceful thing !
CEB	Judges	19	24	Here ’ s my daughter , the young woman , and his secondary wife . Let me send them out , and you can abuse them and do whatever you want to them . But don ’ t do such a disgraceful thing to this man ! ”
CEB	Judges	19	25	But the men refused to listen to him . So the Levite grabbed his secondary wife and sent her outside to them . They raped her and abused her all night long until morning . They finally let her go as dawn was breaking .
CEB	Judges	19	26	At daybreak , the woman came and collapsed at the door of the man ’ s house where her husband was staying , where she lay until it was daylight .
CEB	Judges	19	27	When her husband got up in the morning , he opened the doors of the house and went outside to set out on his journey . And there was his secondary wife , lying at the entrance of the house , with her hands clutching the doorframe .
CEB	Judges	19	28	“ Get up , ” he said to her , “ let ’ s go. ” But there was no response . So he laid her across a donkey , and the man set out for home .
CEB	Judges	19	29	When he got home , he picked up a knife , took his secondary wife , and chopped her , limb by limb , into twelve pieces . Then he sent them into all the areas of Israel .
CEB	Judges	19	30	Everyone who saw it said , “ Has such a thing ever happened or been seen since the time when the Israelites came up from the land of Egypt until today ? Think about it , decide what to do , and speak out ! ” Footnotes - Judges 19:18 LXX ; MT to the Lord ’ s house - Judges 19:20 Or Peace be with you
CEB	Judges	20	20	They marched out to fight against the Benjaminites , lining up in battle formation against them at Gibeah .
CEB	Judges	20	2	The commanders of the people and of all the tribes of Israel took their place in the assembly of God ’ s people , four hundred thousand foot soldiers armed with swords .
CEB	Judges	20	3	And the Benjaminites got word that the Israelites had marched up to Mizpah . The Israelites inquired , “ Tell us how this evil act happened. ”
CEB	Judges	20	4	So the Levite , the husband of the murdered woman , answered , “ My secondary wife and I came to Gibeah of Benjamin to spend the night ,
CEB	Judges	20	5	and the leading citizens of Gibeah tried to attack me . They surrounded me in the house at night and were determined to kill me . They abused my secondary wife until she died .
CEB	Judges	20	6	I took her , chopped her up , and sent her pieces into every part of Israel ’ s territory , because they had committed a disgraceful act in Israel .
CEB	Judges	20	7	All you Israelites , say what you think should be done here and now ! ”
CEB	Judges	20	8	At this , all the people stood as one to say , “ Not a single one of us is going home or returning to our house !
CEB	Judges	20	9	This is what we ’ re now going to do to Gibeah : We ’ ll march up [ a ] against it as the lot determines .
CEB	Judges	20	10	From all the tribes of Israel , we ’ ll get ten men for every hundred , one hundred for every thousand , and one thousand for every ten thousand to take supplies for the troops who are going to pay back [ b ] Gibeah of Benjamin for the disgraceful act they ’ ve done in Israel. ”
CEB	Judges	20	11	So all the Israelites joined together and were united as one against the city .
CEB	Judges	20	12	The Israelite tribes sent men throughout the whole tribe of Benjamin with this message : “ What about this evil act that happened among you ?
CEB	Judges	20	13	Now hand over those perverse men in Gibeah so that we can execute them and remove the evil from Israel. ” But the Benjaminites refused to comply with the demand of their own relatives the Israelites .
CEB	Judges	20	14	Instead , the Benjaminites from all the cities came together at Gibeah to march out for battle against the Israelites .
CEB	Judges	20	15	On that day , the Benjaminites called up from their cities twenty-six thousand men armed with swords , not counting those living in Gibeah . [ c ]
CEB	Judges	20	16	Out of this entire army , seven hundred specially chosen men were left-handed , and every one of them could sling a stone at a hair and not miss .
CEB	Judges	20	17	Not counting Benjamin , the Israelites called up four hundred thousand men armed with swords , and every one of them was a trained warrior .
CEB	Judges	20	18	Then the Israelites marched up to Bethel to ask for direction from God . They inquired , “ Who should go up first to fight against the Benjaminites for us ? ” And the Lord said , “ Let the tribe of Judah be first. ”
CEB	Judges	20	19	So the next morning , the Israelites got up and camped near Gibeah .
CEB	Judges	20	21	But the Benjaminites marched out from Gibeah and cut down twenty-two thousand Israelite men that day .
CEB	Judges	20	23	[ d ] So the Israelites went back up and wept before the Lord until evening . They asked the Lord , “ Should we move in again to fight our relatives the Benjaminites ? ” And the Lord replied , “ March out against them. ”
CEB	Judges	20	22	The Israelite troops regrouped and lined up in battle formation again in the same place they had lined up the first day .
CEB	Judges	20	24	The Israelites moved in against the Benjaminites the second day .
CEB	Judges	20	25	But the Benjaminites marched out of Gibeah to meet them on that second day and cut down another eighteen thousand Israelite men , all of whom were armed with swords .
CEB	Judges	20	26	Then all the Israelite troops went back up to Bethel and wept , just sitting there in the Lord ’ s presence . They fasted that whole day until evening . Then they offered entirely burned offerings and well-being sacrifices to the Lord .
CEB	Judges	20	27	Now in those days the chest containing God ’ s covenant was there ,
CEB	Judges	20	28	and Phinehas , Eleazar ’ s son and Aaron ’ s grandson , was in charge of ministering before it . The Israelites asked the Lord , “ Should we march out once again to fight our relatives the Benjaminites or should we give up ? ” And the Lord replied , “ March up , for I ’ ll hand them to you tomorrow. ”
CEB	Judges	20	29	So the Israelites set ambushes around Gibeah .
CEB	Judges	20	30	Three days later , the Israelites marched out against the Benjaminites . They lined up for battle against Gibeah as before .
CEB	Judges	20	31	When the Benjaminites came out to meet them , they were drawn away from the city . They began to strike down some of the troops just like the last time , about thirty Israelites along the main roads , one of which goes up to Bethel and one to Gibeah , as well as in the open fields .
CEB	Judges	20	32	The Benjaminites thought , They ’ re being wiped out before us like the first time . But the Israelites had planned , We ’ ll retreat and draw them away from the city toward the main roads .
CEB	Judges	20	33	The Israelites moved from their position and reformed their battle lines at Baal-tamar . Then the Israelites who had been set in ambush charged out from their positions west of Gibeah . [ e ]
CEB	Judges	20	34	Ten thousand specially chosen men from all the Israelites came against Gibeah . The fighting was fierce , and the Benjaminites didn ’ t realize that disaster was almost on them .
CEB	Judges	20	35	The Lord wiped out the Benjaminites before Israel . The Israelites slaughtered twenty-five thousand one hundred Benjaminite men that day , all of them armed with swords .
CEB	Judges	20	36	Then the Benjaminites saw that they had been defeated . The Israelites had given ground to the Benjaminites because they relied on the ambush that they had set around Gibeah .
CEB	Judges	20	37	Indeed , those in the ambush had dashed swiftly into Gibeah and killed all the people in the city with their swords .
CEB	Judges	20	38	The plan between the main force of the Israelites and those in the ambush was that when they sent up a big cloud of smoke from the city ,
CEB	Judges	20	39	the Israelites would turn around in battle . The Benjaminites had begun to defeat some of the Israelites and had killed about thirty men , thinking , They are definitely going to be wiped out before us , as in the first battle !
CEB	Judges	20	40	But then the column of smoke began to rise from the city . When the Benjaminites looked back , there was the entire city going up in smoke to the sky .
CEB	Judges	20	41	The main force of the Israelites turned around , and the Benjaminites lost heart , because they recognized that disaster had fallen on them .
CEB	Judges	20	42	They turned back before the Israelites in the direction of the desert , but the fighting caught up with them , and those from the towns were slaughtering them there . [ f ]
CEB	Judges	20	43	They encircled the Benjaminites , chased them from Nohah , [ g ] and trampled them to the east of Gibeah .
CEB	Judges	20	44	Eighteen thousand Benjaminites fell , all of whom were strong warriors .
CEB	Judges	20	45	When they turned back and fled toward the desert to the rock of Rimmon , the Israelites picked off another five thousand men on the main roads . And when they caught up with them at Gidom , they struck down two thousand more .
CEB	Judges	20	46	All in all , the total number of Benjaminites who fell that day was twenty-five thousand men , all of whom were armed with swords and were strong warriors .
CEB	Judges	20	47	Six hundred men turned back and fled toward the desert to the rock of Rimmon . They stayed at the rock of Rimmon for four months .
CEB	Judges	20	48	But the Israelites turned their attention to the rest of the Benjaminites and massacred them entirely—the city , the people , even the animals , and everything else they found . They also burned down every city they came across .

CEB	Judges	21	21	and watch . At the moment the women of Shiloh come out to participate in the dances , rush out from the vineyards . Each one of you , capture a wife for yourself from the women of Shiloh and go back to the land of Benjamin .
CEB	Judges	21	2	But the people came to Bethel and sat there until evening before God , raising their voices and crying bitterly .
CEB	Judges	21	3	“ Lord , God of Israel , ” they said , “ why has this happened among us that as of today one tribe will be missing from Israel ? ”
CEB	Judges	21	4	And the next day , the people got up early and built an altar there . They offered entirely burned offerings and well-being sacrifices .
CEB	Judges	21	5	Then the Israelites asked , “ Were there any out of all the tribes of Israel who didn ’ t march up to the assembly before the Lord ? ” Indeed , they had made a solemn pledge that anyone who didn ’ t march up before the Lord at Mizpah would be put to death .
CEB	Judges	21	6	The Israelites had a change of heart concerning their relatives the Benjaminites . They said , “ Today one tribe has been cut off from Israel .
CEB	Judges	21	7	What can we do to provide wives for the ones who are left , since we ourselves have made a pledge before the Lord not to allow our daughters to marry them ? ”
CEB	Judges	21	8	So they asked , “ Is there anyone from the tribes of Israel who didn ’ t march up before the Lord at Mizpah ? ” There was ! No one from Jabesh-gilead had come to the assembly at the camp .
CEB	Judges	21	9	When the people ’ s attendance was taken , not one of those who lived in Jabesh-gilead had been there .
CEB	Judges	21	10	The community dispatched twelve thousand warriors there with these orders : “ Go kill all the people in Jabesh-gilead , including women and children .
CEB	Judges	21	11	Here ’ s what you should do : Exterminate every man and every woman who has slept with a man. ”
CEB	Judges	21	12	Among the people of Jabesh-gilead , they found four hundred young women who had not known a man intimately or slept with one , and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh in the land of Canaan .
CEB	Judges	21	13	The whole community then sent word to the Benjaminites who were at the rock of Rimmon and offered them a truce . [ a ]
CEB	Judges	21	14	So the Benjaminites returned at that time , and they gave them the women from Jabesh-gilead that they had allowed to live . Even so , there weren ’ t enough for them .
CEB	Judges	21	15	Since the people had a change of heart concerning the Benjaminites because the Lord had caused a rupture in the tribes of Israel ,
CEB	Judges	21	16	the community elders said , “ What can we do to provide wives for the ones who are left , seeing that the Benjaminite women have been destroyed ?
CEB	Judges	21	17	There must be a surviving line for those who remain from Benjamin , ” they continued , “ so that a tribe won ’ t be erased from Israel .
CEB	Judges	21	18	But we can ’ t allow our daughters to marry them , for we Israelites have made this pledge : ‘ Let anyone who provides a wife for Benjamin be cursed ! ’
CEB	Judges	21	19	However , ” they said , “ the annual festival of the Lord is under way in Shiloh , which is north of Bethel , east of the main road that goes up from Bethel to Shechem , and south of Lebonah. ”
CEB	Judges	21	20	So they instructed the Benjaminites , “ Go and hide like an ambush in the vineyards
CEB	Judges	21	22	When their fathers or brothers come to us to object , we ’ ll tell them , ‘ Do us a favor for their sake . We didn ’ t capture enough women for every man during the battle , and this way you are not guilty because you didn ’ t give them anything willingly. ’ ”
CEB	Judges	21	23	And that is what the Benjaminites did . They took wives for their whole group from the dancers whom they abducted . They returned to their territory , rebuilt the cities , and lived in them .
CEB	Judges	21	24	Likewise , the Israelites set out from there at that time , heading home to their respective tribes and clans . They all left there for their own territories .
CEB	Judges	21	25	In those days there was no king in Israel ; each person did what they thought to be right . Footnotes - Judges 21:13 Or peace
CEB	Ruth	1	1	During the days when the judges ruled , there was a famine in the land . A man with his wife and two sons went from Bethlehem of Judah to dwell in the territory of Moab .
CEB	Ruth	1	2	The name of that man was Elimelech , the name of his wife was Naomi , and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion . They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem in Judah . They entered the territory of Moab and settled there .
CEB	Ruth	1	3	But Elimelech , Naomi ’ s husband , died . Then only she was left , along with her two sons .
CEB	Ruth	1	4	They took wives for themselves , Moabite women ; the name of the first was Orpah and the name of the second was Ruth . And they lived there for about ten years .
CEB	Ruth	1	5	But both of the sons , Mahlon and Chilion , also died . Only the woman was left , without her two children and without her husband .
CEB	Ruth	1	6	Then she arose along with her daughters-in-law to return from the field of Moab , because while in the territory of Moab she had heard that the Lord had paid attention to his people by providing food for them .
CEB	Ruth	1	7	She left the place where she had been , and her two daughters-in-law went with her . They went along the road to return to the land of Judah .
CEB	Ruth	1	8	Naomi said to her daughters-in-law , “ Go , turn back , each of you to the household of your mother . May the Lord deal faithfully with you , just as you have done with the dead and with me .
CEB	Ruth	1	9	May the Lord provide for you so that you may find security , each woman in the household of her husband. ” Then she kissed them , and they lifted up their voices and wept .
CEB	Ruth	1	10	But they replied to her , “ No , instead we will return with you , to your people. ”
CEB	Ruth	1	11	Naomi replied , “ Turn back , my daughters . Why would you go with me ? Will there again be sons in my womb , that they would be husbands for you ?
CEB	Ruth	1	12	Turn back , my daughters . Go . I am too old for a husband . If I were to say that I have hope , even if I had a husband tonight , and even more , if I were to bear sons—
CEB	Ruth	1	13	would you wait until they grew up ? Would you refrain from having a husband ? No , my daughters . This is more bitter for me than for you , since the Lord ’ s will has come out against me. ”
CEB	Ruth	1	14	Then they lifted up their voices and wept again . Orpah kissed her mother-in-law , but Ruth stayed with her .
CEB	Ruth	1	15	Naomi said , “ Look , your sister-in-law is returning to her people and to her gods . Turn back after your sister-in-law. ”
CEB	Ruth	1	16	But Ruth replied , “ Don ’ t urge me to abandon you , to turn back from following after you . Wherever you go , I will go ; and wherever you stay , I will stay . Your people will be my people , and your God will be my God .
CEB	Ruth	1	17	Wherever you die , I will die , and there I will be buried . May the Lord do this to me and more so if even death separates me from you. ”
CEB	Ruth	1	18	When Naomi saw that Ruth was determined to go with her , she stopped speaking to her about it .
CEB	Ruth	1	19	So both of them went along until they arrived at Bethlehem . When they arrived at Bethlehem , the whole town was excited on account of them , and the women of the town asked , “ Can this be Naomi ? ”
CEB	Ruth	1	20	She replied to them , “ Don ’ t call me Naomi , [ a ] but call me Mara , [ b ] for the Almighty [ c ] has made me very bitter .
CEB	Ruth	1	21	I went away full , but the Lord has returned me empty . Why would you call me Naomi , when the Lord has testified against me , and the Almighty has deemed me guilty ? ”
CEB	Ruth	1	22	Thus Naomi returned . And Ruth the Moabite , her daughter-in-law , returned with her from the territory of Moab . They arrived in Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley harvest .
CEB	Ruth	2	2	Ruth the Moabite said to Naomi , “ Let me go to the field so that I may glean among the ears of grain behind someone in whose eyes I might find favor. ” Naomi replied to her , “ Go , my daughter. ”
CEB	Ruth	2	3	So she went ; she arrived and she gleaned in the field behind the harvesters . By chance , it happened to be the portion of the field that belonged to Boaz , who was from the family of Elimelech .
CEB	Ruth	2	4	Just then Boaz arrived from Bethlehem . He said to the harvesters , “ May the Lord be with you. ” And they said to him , “ May the Lord bless you. ”
CEB	Ruth	2	5	Boaz said to his young man , the one who was overseeing the harvesters , “ To whom does this young woman belong ? ”
CEB	Ruth	2	6	The young man who was overseeing the harvesters answered , “ She ’ s a young Moabite woman , the one who returned with Naomi from the territory of Moab .
CEB	Ruth	2	7	She said , ‘ Please let me glean so that I might gather up grain from among the bundles behind the harvesters. ’ She arrived and has been on her feet from the morning until now , and has sat down for only a moment. ” [ a ]
CEB	Ruth	2	8	Boaz said to Ruth , “ Haven ’ t you understood , my daughter ? Don ’ t go glean in another field ; don ’ t go anywhere else . Instead , stay here with my young women .
CEB	Ruth	2	9	Keep your eyes on the field that they are harvesting and go along after them . I ’ ve ordered the young men not to assault you . Whenever you are thirsty , go to the jugs and drink from what the young men have filled. ”
CEB	Ruth	2	10	Then she bowed down , face to the ground , and replied to him , “ How is it that I ’ ve found favor in your eyes , that you notice me ? I ’ m an immigrant. ”
CEB	Ruth	2	11	Boaz responded to her , “ Everything that you did for your mother-in-law after your husband ’ s death has been reported fully to me : how you left behind your father , your mother , and the land of your birth , and came to a people you hadn ’ t known beforehand .
CEB	Ruth	2	12	May the Lord reward you [ b ] for your deed . May you receive a rich reward from the Lord , the God of Israel , under whose wings you ’ ve come to seek refuge. ”
CEB	Ruth	2	13	She said , “ May I continue to find favor in your eyes , sir , because you ’ ve comforted me and because you ’ ve spoken kindly to your female servant—even though I ’ m not one of your female servants. ”
CEB	Ruth	2	14	At mealtime Boaz said to her , “ Come over here , eat some of the bread , and dip your piece in the vinegar. ” She sat alongside the harvesters , and he served roasted grain to her . She ate , was satisfied , and had leftovers .
CEB	Ruth	2	15	Then she got up to glean . Boaz ordered his young men , “ Let her glean between the bundles , and don ’ t humiliate her .
CEB	Ruth	2	16	Also , pull out some from the bales for her and leave them behind for her to glean . And don ’ t scold her. ”
CEB	Ruth	2	17	So she gleaned in the field until evening . Then she threshed what she had gleaned ; it was about an ephah [ c ] of barley .
CEB	Ruth	2	18	She picked it up and went into town . Her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned . She brought out what she had left over after eating her fill and gave it to her .
CEB	Ruth	2	19	Her mother-in-law said to her , “ Where did you glean today ? Where did you work ? May the one who noticed you be blessed. ” She told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked and said , “ The name of the man with whom I worked today is Boaz. ”
CEB	Ruth	2	20	Naomi replied to her daughter-in-law , “ May he be blessed by the Lord , who hasn ’ t abandoned his faithfulness with the living or with the dead. ” Naomi said to her , “ The man is one of our close relatives ; he ’ s one of our redeemers. ”
CEB	Ruth	2	21	Ruth the Moabite replied , “ Furthermore , he said to me , ‘ Stay with my workers until they ’ ve finished all of my harvest. ’ ”
CEB	Ruth	2	22	Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law , “ It ’ s good , my daughter , that you go out with his young women , so that men don ’ t assault you in another field. ”
CEB	Ruth	2	23	Thus she stayed with Boaz ’ s young women , gleaning until the completion of the barley and wheat harvests . And she lived with her mother-in-law .
CEB	Ruth	3	3	You should bathe , put on some perfume , wear nice clothes , and then go down to the threshing floor . Don ’ t make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking .
CEB	Ruth	3	2	Now isn ’ t Boaz , whose young women you were with , our relative ? Tonight he will be winnowing barley at the threshing floor .
CEB	Ruth	3	4	When he lies down , notice the place where he is lying . Then go , uncover his feet , and lie down . And he will tell you what to do. ”
CEB	Ruth	3	5	Ruth replied to her , “ I ’ ll do everything you are telling me. ”
CEB	Ruth	3	6	So she went down to the threshing floor , and she did everything just as her mother-in-law had ordered .
CEB	Ruth	3	7	Boaz ate and drank , and he was in a good mood . He went over to lie down by the edge of the grain pile . Then she quietly approached , uncovered his legs , and lay down .
CEB	Ruth	3	8	During the middle of the night , the man shuddered and turned over—and there was a woman lying at his feet .
CEB	Ruth	3	9	“ Who are you ? ” he asked . She replied , “ I ’ m Ruth your servant . Spread out your robe [ a ] over your servant , because you are a redeemer. ”
CEB	Ruth	3	10	He said , “ May you be blessed by the Lord , my daughter ! You have acted even more faithfully than you did at first . You haven ’ t gone after rich or poor young men .
CEB	Ruth	3	11	And now , my daughter , don ’ t be afraid . I ’ ll do for you everything you are asking . Indeed , my people—all who are at the gate—know that you are a woman of worth .
CEB	Ruth	3	12	Now , although it ’ s certainly true that I ’ m a redeemer , there ’ s a redeemer who is a closer relative than I am .
CEB	Ruth	3	13	Stay the night . And in the morning , if he ’ ll redeem you—good , let him redeem . But if he doesn ’ t want to redeem you , then—as the Lord lives—I myself will redeem you . Lie down until the morning. ”
CEB	Ruth	3	14	So she lay at his feet until morning . Then she got up before one person could recognize another , for he had said , “ No one should know that the woman came to the threshing floor. ”
CEB	Ruth	3	15	He said , “ Bring the cloak that you have on and hold it out. ” She held it out , and he measured out six measures of barley and placed it upon her . Then she [ b ] went into town .
CEB	Ruth	3	16	She came to her mother-in-law , who said , “ How are you , my daughter ? ” So Ruth told her everything the man had done for her .
CEB	Ruth	3	17	She said , “ He gave me these six measures of barley , for he said to me , ‘ Don ’ t go away empty-handed to your mother-in-law. ’ ”
CEB	Ruth	3	18	“ Sit tight , my daughter , ” Naomi replied , “ until you know how it turns out . The man won ’ t rest until he resolves the matter today . ”
CEB	Ruth	4	4	I thought that I should let you know and say , ‘ Buy it , in the presence of those sitting here and in the presence of the elders of my people. ’ If you will redeem it , redeem it ; but if you [ a ] won ’ t redeem it , tell me so that I may know . There isn ’ t anyone to redeem it except you , and I ’ m next in line after you. ” He replied , “ I will redeem it. ”
CEB	Ruth	4	2	Then he took ten men from the town ’ s elders and said , “ Sit down here. ” And they sat down .
CEB	Ruth	4	3	Boaz said to the redeemer , “ Naomi , who has returned from the field of Moab , is selling the portion of the field that belonged to our brother Elimelech .
CEB	Ruth	4	5	Then Boaz said , “ On the day when you buy the field from Naomi , you also buy [ b ] Ruth the Moabite , the wife of the dead man , in order to preserve the dead man ’ s name for his inheritance. ”
CEB	Ruth	4	6	But the redeemer replied , “ Then I can ’ t redeem it for myself , without risking damage to my own inheritance . Redeem it for yourself . You can have my right of redemption , because I ’ m unable to act as redeemer. ”
CEB	Ruth	4	7	In Israel , in former times , this was the practice regarding redemption and exchange to confirm any such matter : a man would take off his sandal and give it to the other person . This was the process of making a transaction binding in Israel .
CEB	Ruth	4	8	Then the redeemer said to Boaz , “ Buy it for yourself , ” and he took off his sandal .
CEB	Ruth	4	9	Boaz announced to the elders and all the people , “ Today you are witnesses that I ’ ve bought from the hand of Naomi all that belonged to Elimelech and all that belonged to Chilion and Mahlon .
CEB	Ruth	4	10	And also Ruth the Moabite , the wife of Mahlon , I ’ ve bought to be my wife , to preserve the dead man ’ s name for his inheritance so that the name of the dead man might not be cut off from his brothers or from the gate of his hometown—today you are witnesses. ”
CEB	Ruth	4	11	Then all the people who were at the gate and the elders said , “ We are witnesses . May the Lord grant that the woman who is coming into your household be like Rachel and like Leah , both of whom built up the house of Israel . May you be fertile in Ephrathah and may you preserve a name in Bethlehem .
CEB	Ruth	4	12	And may your household be like the household of Perez , whom Tamar bore to Judah—through the children that the Lord will give you from this young woman. ”
CEB	Ruth	4	13	So Boaz took Ruth , and she became his wife . He was intimate with her , the Lord let her become pregnant , and she gave birth to a son .
CEB	Ruth	4	14	The women said to Naomi , “ May the Lord be blessed , who today hasn ’ t left you without a redeemer . May his name be proclaimed in Israel .
CEB	Ruth	4	15	He will restore your life and sustain you in your old age . Your daughter-in-law who loves you has given birth to him . She ’ s better for you than seven sons. ”
CEB	Ruth	4	16	Naomi took the child and held him to her breast , and she became his guardian .
CEB	Ruth	4	17	The neighborhood women gave him a name , saying , “ A son has been born to Naomi. ” They called his name Obed . [ c ] He became Jesse ’ s father and David ’ s grandfather .
CEB	Ruth	4	18	These are the generations of Perez : Perez became the father of Hezron ,
CEB	Ruth	4	19	Hezron the father of Ram , Ram the father of Amminadab ,
CEB	Ruth	4	20	Amminadab the father of Nahshon , Nahshon the father of Salmon ,
CEB	Ruth	4	21	Salmon the father of Boaz , Boaz the father of Obed ,
CEB	Ruth	4	22	Obed the father of Jesse , and Jesse the father of David .
CEB	1%20Samuel	1	1	Samuel 1:28 Some Heb manuscripts , Syr , Vulg ; MT he ( Eli ? ) worshipped ; DSS ( 4QSama ) and she ( Hannah ) left him there and worshipped the Lord .
CEB	1%20Samuel	1	2	Elkanah had two wives , one named Hannah and the other named Peninnah . Peninnah had children , but Hannah didn ’ t .
CEB	1%20Samuel	1	3	Every year this man would leave his town to worship and sacrifice to the Lord of heavenly forces in Shiloh , where Eli ’ s two sons Hophni and Phinehas were the Lord ’ s priests .
CEB	1%20Samuel	1	4	Whenever he sacrificed , Elkanah would give parts of the sacrifice to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters .
CEB	1%20Samuel	1	5	But he would give only one part of it to Hannah , though he loved her , because the Lord had kept her from conceiving . [ b ]
CEB	1%20Samuel	1	6	And because the Lord had kept Hannah from conceiving , her rival would make fun of her mercilessly , just to bother her .
CEB	1%20Samuel	1	7	So that is what took place year after year . Whenever Hannah went to the Lord ’ s house , Peninnah would make fun of her . Then she would cry and wouldn ’ t eat anything .
CEB	1%20Samuel	1	8	“ Hannah , why are you crying ? ” her husband Elkanah would say to her . “ Why won ’ t you eat ? Why are you [ c ] so sad ? Aren ’ t I worth more to you than ten sons ? ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	1	9	One time , after eating and drinking in Shiloh , Hannah got up and presented herself before the Lord . [ d ] ( Now Eli the priest was sitting in the chair by the doorpost of the Lord ’ s temple . )
CEB	1%20Samuel	1	10	Hannah was very upset and couldn ’ t stop crying as she prayed to the Lord .
CEB	1%20Samuel	1	11	Then she made this promise : “ Lord of heavenly forces , just look at your servant ’ s pain and remember me ! Don ’ t forget your servant ! Give her a boy ! Then I ’ ll give him to the Lord for his entire life . No razor will ever touch his head. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	1	12	As she kept praying before the Lord , Eli watched her mouth .
CEB	1%20Samuel	1	13	Now Hannah was praying in her heart ; her lips were moving , but her voice was silent , so Eli thought she was drunk .
CEB	1%20Samuel	1	14	“ How long will you act like a drunk ? Sober up ! ” Eli told her .
CEB	1%20Samuel	1	15	“ No sir ! ” Hannah replied . “ I ’ m just a very sad woman . I haven ’ t had any wine or beer but have been pouring out my heart to the Lord .
CEB	1%20Samuel	1	16	Don ’ t think your servant is some good-for-nothing woman . This whole time I ’ ve been praying out of my great worry and trouble ! ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	1	17	Eli responded , “ Then go in peace . And may the God of Israel give you what you ’ ve asked from him. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	1	18	“ Please think well of me , your servant , ” Hannah said . Then the woman went on her way , ate some food , and wasn ’ t sad any longer . [ e ]
CEB	1%20Samuel	1	19	They got up early the next morning and worshipped the Lord . Then they went back home to Ramah . Elkanah had sex with his wife Hannah , and the Lord remembered her .
CEB	1%20Samuel	1	20	So in the course of time , Hannah conceived and gave birth to a son . She named him Samuel , which means “ I asked the Lord for him. ” [ f ] Samuel ’ s dedication
CEB	1%20Samuel	1	21	When Elkanah and all his household went up to make the annual sacrifice and keep his solemn promise ,
CEB	1%20Samuel	1	22	Hannah didn ’ t go . “ I ’ ll bring the boy when he is weaned , ” she told her husband , “ so he can be presented to the Lord and stay there permanently . I will offer him as a nazirite forever. ” [ g ]
CEB	1%20Samuel	1	23	“ Do what seems best to you , ” said her husband Elkanah . “ Stay here until you ’ ve weaned him . But may the Lord bring to pass what you ’ ve [ h ] promised. ” So the woman stayed home and nursed her son until she had weaned him .
CEB	1%20Samuel	1	24	When he had been weaned and was still very young , [ i ] Hannah took him , along with a three-year-old bull , [ j ] an ephah [ k ] of flour , and a jar of wine , and brought him to the Lord ’ s house at Shiloh .
CEB	1%20Samuel	1	25	They slaughtered the bull , then brought the boy to Eli .
CEB	1%20Samuel	1	26	“ Excuse me , sir ! ” Hannah said . “ As surely as you live , sir , I am the woman who stood here next to you , praying to the Lord .
CEB	1%20Samuel	1	27	I prayed for this boy , and the Lord gave me what I asked from him .
CEB	1%20Samuel	1	28	So now I give this boy back to the Lord . As long as he lives , he is given to the Lord. ” Then they worshipped there before the Lord . [ l ] Footnotes -

CEB	1%20Samuel	2	3	Don ’ t go on and on , talking so proudly , spouting arrogance from your mouth , because the Lord is the God who knows , and he weighs every act .

CEB	1%20Samuel	2	11	Then Elkanah went home to Ramah , but the boy served the Lord under Eli the priest . Corruption of Eli ’ s sons
CEB	1%20Samuel	2	12	Now Eli ’ s sons were despicable men who didn ’ t know the Lord .
CEB	1%20Samuel	2	13	This was how the priest was supposed to act with the people : Whenever anyone made a sacrifice , while the meat was boiling , the priest ’ s assistant would come with a three-pronged fork in hand .
CEB	1%20Samuel	2	14	He would thrust it into the cauldron or the pot . [ c ] Whatever the fork brought up , the priest would take for himself . This is how it was done for all the Israelites who came to Shiloh .
CEB	1%20Samuel	2	15	But with Eli ’ s sons , [ d ] even before the fat was burned , the priest ’ s assistant would come and say to the person offering the sacrifice , “ Give the priest some meat to roast . He won ’ t accept boiled meat from you. ” [ e ]
CEB	1%20Samuel	2	16	If anyone said , “ Let the fat be burned off first , as usual , then take whatever you like for yourself , ” the assistant would reply , “ No , hand it over now . If not , I ’ ll take it by force. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	2	17	The sin of these priestly assistants was very serious in the Lord ’ s sight because they were disrespecting the Lord ’ s own offering .
CEB	1%20Samuel	2	18	Now Samuel was serving the Lord . He was a young boy , clothed in a linen priestly vest . [ f ]
CEB	1%20Samuel	2	19	His mother would make a small robe for him and take it to him every year when she went up with her husband to offer the annual sacrifice .
CEB	1%20Samuel	2	20	Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife : “ May the Lord replace [ g ] the child of this woman that you gave back to the Lord. ” Then they would return home .
CEB	1%20Samuel	2	21	The Lord paid attention to Hannah , and she conceived and gave birth to three sons and two daughters . Meanwhile , the boy Samuel grew up in the Lord ’ s service .
CEB	1%20Samuel	2	22	Eli was very old , but he heard everything his sons were doing to the Israelites , and how they had sex with the women who served at the meeting tent ’ s entrance .
CEB	1%20Samuel	2	23	Eli said to his sons , “ Why are you doing these terrible things that I ’ m hearing about from everybody ?
CEB	1%20Samuel	2	24	No , my sons . Don ’ t do this . [ h ] The report I hear spreading among God ’ s people isn ’ t good .
CEB	1%20Samuel	2	25	If someone sins against someone else , God can intercede ; but if someone sins against the Lord , who will intercede then ? ” But they wouldn ’ t obey their father because the Lord wanted to kill them .
CEB	1%20Samuel	2	26	Meanwhile , the boy Samuel kept growing up and was more and more liked by both the Lord and the people .
CEB	1%20Samuel	2	27	Now a man of God came to Eli and said , “ This is what the Lord says : I revealed myself very clearly to your father ’ s household when they were slaves [ i ] in Egypt to the house of Pharaoh .
CEB	1%20Samuel	2	28	I chose your father from all of Israel ’ s tribes to be my priest , to go up onto my altar , to burn incense , and to wear the priestly vest [ j ] in my presence . I also gave all of the Israelites ’ food offerings to your father ’ s household .
CEB	1%20Samuel	2	29	Why then do you kick my sacrifices and my offerings—the very ones I commanded for my dwelling place ? Why do you respect your sons more than me , getting fat off the best parts of every offering from my people Israel ?
CEB	1%20Samuel	2	30	Because of all that , this is what the Lord , the God of Israel , declares : I had promised that your household and your father ’ s household would serve me forever . But now—this is what the Lord declares : I ’ ll do no such thing ! No . I honor those who honor me , and whoever despises me will be cursed .
CEB	1%20Samuel	2	31	The days are coming soon when I will eliminate both your children [ k ] and the children of your father ’ s household . There won ’ t be an old person left in your family tree .
CEB	1%20Samuel	2	32	You ’ ll see trouble in my dwelling place , though all will go well for Israel . [ l ] But there will never be an old person in your family tree .
CEB	1%20Samuel	2	33	One of your descendants whom I don ’ t eliminate from serving at my altar will cry his [ m ] eyes out and be full of grief . Any descendants in your household will die by the sword . [ n ]
CEB	1%20Samuel	2	34	And what happens to your two sons Hophni and Phinehas will be a sign for you : they will both die on the same day .
CEB	1%20Samuel	2	35	Then I will establish for myself a trustworthy priest who will act in accordance with my thoughts and desires . I will build a trustworthy household for him , and he will serve before my anointed one forever .

CEB	1%20Samuel	3	4	The Lord called to Samuel . “ I ’ m here , ” he said .
CEB	1%20Samuel	3	5	Samuel hurried to Eli and said , “ I ’ m here . You called me ? ” “ I didn ’ t call you , ” Eli replied . “ Go lie down. ” So he did .
CEB	1%20Samuel	3	6	Again the Lord called Samuel , so Samuel got up , went to Eli , and said , “ I ’ m here . You called me ? ” “ I didn ’ t call , my son , ” Eli replied . “ Go and lie down. ” (
CEB	1%20Samuel	3	7	Now Samuel didn ’ t yet know the Lord , and the Lord ’ s word hadn ’ t yet been revealed to him . )
CEB	1%20Samuel	3	8	A third time the Lord called Samuel . He got up , went to Eli , and said , “ I ’ m here . You called me ? ” Then Eli realized that it was the Lord who was calling the boy .
CEB	1%20Samuel	3	9	So Eli said to Samuel , “ Go and lie down . If he calls you , say , ‘ Speak , Lord . Your servant is listening. ’ ” So Samuel went and lay down where he ’ d been .
CEB	1%20Samuel	3	10	Then the Lord came and stood there , calling just as before , “ Samuel , Samuel ! ” Samuel said , “ Speak . Your servant is listening. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	3	11	The Lord said to Samuel , “ I am about to do something in Israel that will make the ears of all who hear it tingle !
CEB	1%20Samuel	3	12	On that day , I will bring to pass against Eli everything I said about his household—every last bit of it ! [ b ]
CEB	1%20Samuel	3	13	I told him that I would punish his family forever because of the wrongdoing he knew about—how his sons were cursing God , [ c ] but he wouldn ’ t stop them .
CEB	1%20Samuel	3	14	Because of that I swore about Eli ’ s household that his family ’ s wrongdoing will never be reconciled by sacrifice or by offering. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	3	15	Samuel lay there until morning , then opened the doors of the Lord ’ s house . Samuel was afraid to tell the vision to Eli .
CEB	1%20Samuel	3	16	But Eli called Samuel , saying : “ Samuel , my son ! ” “ I ’ m here , ” Samuel said .
CEB	1%20Samuel	3	17	“ What did he say to you ? ” Eli asked . “ Don ’ t hide anything from me . May God deal harshly with you and worse still if you hide from me a single word from everything he said to you. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	3	18	So Samuel told him everything and hid nothing from him . “ He is the Lord , ” Eli said . “ He will do as he pleases. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	3	19	So Samuel grew up , and the Lord was with him , not allowing any of his words to fail .
CEB	1%20Samuel	3	20	All Israel from Dan to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was trustworthy as the Lord ’ s prophet .

CEB	1%20Samuel	4	4	So the people sent to Shiloh and brought from there the chest containing the covenant of the Lord of heavenly forces , who sits enthroned on the winged heavenly creatures . [ b ] Eli ’ s two sons Hophni and Phinehas were there with the chest containing God ’ s covenant .
CEB	1%20Samuel	4	2	The Philistines readied themselves to fight Israel . When the battle was joined , Israel was defeated by the Philistines , who killed about four thousand men on the battlefield .
CEB	1%20Samuel	4	3	When the troops returned to the camp , Israel ’ s elders said , “ Why did the Lord defeat us today before the Philistines ? Let ’ s bring the chest containing the Lord ’ s covenant from Shiloh so it can go with us and save us from our enemies ’ power. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	4	5	When the chest containing the Lord ’ s covenant entered the camp , all Israel let out such a loud shout that the ground shook .
CEB	1%20Samuel	4	6	When the Philistines heard the sound of that shout , they asked , “ What is that loud shouting in the Hebrew camp about ? ” When they learned that the Lord ’ s chest had come into the camp ,
CEB	1%20Samuel	4	7	the Philistines were afraid and said , “ A god has come into that camp ! We ’ re doomed , ” they said , “ because nothing like this has ever happened before .
CEB	1%20Samuel	4	8	We ’ re doomed ! Who will deliver us from the grip of these powerful deities ? They are the same gods who struck the Egyptians in the desert with every kind of wound .

CEB	1%20Samuel	4	13	When he got there , Eli was sitting in a chair beside the road , waiting because he was nervous about God ’ s chest . The man arrived and gave the news to the city , and the whole city cried out .
CEB	1%20Samuel	4	14	Eli heard the sound of the cry and said , “ What ’ s all this noise about ? ” The man hurriedly went and told Eli the news . (

CEB	1%20Samuel	4	16	The man told Eli , “ I ’ m the one who just came from the battle . I fled from the battle today. ” “ What ’ s the report , my son ? ” Eli asked .
CEB	1%20Samuel	4	17	The messenger answered , “ Israel has fled from the Philistines . The army has suffered a massive defeat . Also , your own two sons Hophni and Phinehas have died , and God ’ s chest has been taken ! ”

CEB	1%20Samuel	5	9	But once they moved it , the Lord ’ s hand came against the city , causing a huge panic . God struck the city ’ s inhabitants , both young and old , and tumors broke out on them .

CEB	1%20Samuel	5	11	So they summoned all the Philistine rulers to a meeting and said , “ Send the chest of Israel ’ s God away !

CEB	1%20Samuel	6	3	They replied , “ If you are returning the chest of Israel ’ s God , don ’ t send it back empty , but be sure to return a guilt offering to him . [ a ] Then you will be healed , and it will become clear to you why God ’ s hand hasn ’ t left you alone. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	6	4	“ What compensation offering should we return to him ? ” they asked . The priests and diviners replied : “ Five gold tumors [ b ] and five gold mice , [ c ] matching the number of the Philistine rulers , because the same plague came on all of you and your rulers .
CEB	1%20Samuel	6	5	You must make images of your tumors and the mice that have devastated the land . Honor Israel ’ s God . Perhaps he will lighten the weight of his hand on you , your gods , and your land .
CEB	1%20Samuel	6	7	So get a new cart ready along with two nursing cows that have never been yoked before . Harness the cows to the cart , but take any of their calves that are following back home .
CEB	1%20Samuel	6	8	Next , take the Lord ’ s chest and put it in the cart . Set the gold items that you are giving God as a compensation offering in a box next to the chest . Then send it on its way .
CEB	1%20Samuel	6	9	Then watch what happens : If the cart goes up the road to its own territory toward Beth-shemesh , then Israel ’ s God has brought this great disaster on us . If the cart goes another way , then we ’ ll know that it wasn ’ t God ’ s hand that struck us . It happened to us randomly. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	6	10	The rulers [ d ] did just that . They took two nursing cows and harnessed them to the cart , penning their calves up at home .
CEB	1%20Samuel	6	11	They put the Lord ’ s chest on the cart along with the box containing the gold mice and the images of their tumors . [ e ]
CEB	1%20Samuel	6	12	The cows went straight ahead , following the road to Beth-shemesh . They kept to one route , mooing as they went , without turning right or left . The Philistine rulers followed them as far as the territory of Beth-shemesh .
CEB	1%20Samuel	6	13	Now the people of Beth-shemesh were harvesting wheat in the valley . When they looked up and saw the chest , they were overjoyed at the sight .
CEB	1%20Samuel	6	14	The cart entered the field belonging to Joshua of Beth-shemesh and stopped right by a large stone . They chopped up the wood of the cart and offered the cows as an entirely burned offering to the Lord .
CEB	1%20Samuel	6	15	The Levites unloaded the Lord ’ s chest and the box that was with it that contained all the gold items , and they set them on the large stone . That very day the people of Beth-shemesh offered entirely burned offerings and made sacrifices to the Lord .
CEB	1%20Samuel	6	16	When the five Philistine rulers witnessed this , they went straight back to Ekron .
CEB	1%20Samuel	6	17	These are the gold tumors that the Philistines returned as a compensation offering to the Lord : one for Ashdod , one for Gaza , one for Ashkelon , one for Gath , and one for Ekron .
CEB	1%20Samuel	6	18	The gold mice matched the number of Philistine cities belonging to the five rulers , from fortified cities to country villages . And the large stone [ f ] they set the Lord ’ s chest on is a witness even now in the field that belongs to Joshua of Beth-shemesh .
CEB	1%20Samuel	6	19	But God struck down some of the people from Beth-shemesh because they looked into the Lord ’ s chest . God struck seventy people , [ g ] and the community grieved because the Lord had struck them so severely .
CEB	1%20Samuel	6	20	The people of Beth-shemesh said , “ Who can stand before the Lord , this holy God ? Where can he go that is away from us here ? ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	6	21	They sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath-jearim . “ The Philistines returned the Lord ’ s chest ! ” they said . “ Come down and take it back with you. ” Footnotes -
CEB	1%20Samuel	7	1	Samuel 7:12 Meaning stone of help
CEB	1%20Samuel	7	7	When the Philistines heard that the Israelites had assembled at Mizpah , the Philistine rulers went up to attack Israel . When the Israelites learned of this , they were afraid of the Philistines .
CEB	1%20Samuel	7	2	Now a long time passed—a total of twenty years—after the chest came to stay in Kiriath-jearim , and the whole house of Israel yearned for [ a ] the Lord .
CEB	1%20Samuel	7	3	Then Samuel said to the whole house of Israel , “ If you are turning to the Lord with all your heart , then get rid of all the foreign gods and the Astartes you have . Set your heart on the Lord ! Worship him only ! Then he will deliver you from the Philistines ’ power. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	7	4	So the Israelites got rid of the Baals and the Astartes and worshipped the Lord only .
CEB	1%20Samuel	7	5	Next Samuel said , “ Assemble all Israel at Mizpah . I will pray to the Lord for you. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	7	6	So they assembled at Mizpah , and they drew water and poured it out in the Lord ’ s presence . They fasted that same day and confessed , “ We have sinned against the Lord. ” Samuel served as judge of the Israelites at Mizpah .
CEB	1%20Samuel	7	8	The Israelites said to Samuel , “ Please don ’ t stop praying to the Lord our God for us , so God will save us from the Philistines ’ power ! ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	7	9	So Samuel took a suckling lamb and offered it as an entirely burned offering to the Lord . Samuel cried out in prayer to the Lord for Israel , and the Lord answered him .
CEB	1%20Samuel	7	10	While Samuel was offering the entirely burned offering , the Philistines advanced to attack Israel . But the Lord thundered against the Philistines with a great blast on that very day , throwing the Philistines into such a panic that they were defeated by Israel .
CEB	1%20Samuel	7	11	The Israelite soldiers came out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistines . They struck them down until they reached a place just below Beth-car .
CEB	1%20Samuel	7	12	Then Samuel took a stone and set it up between Mizpah and Jeshanah . [ b ] He named it Ebenezer , [ c ] explaining , “ The Lord helped us to this very point. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	7	13	So the Philistines were defeated , and they stopped coming into Israelite territory . The Lord ’ s hand was against the Philistines throughout Samuel ’ s life .
CEB	1%20Samuel	7	14	The towns the Philistines had captured from Israel , from Ekron to Gath , were returned to Israel . Israel also recovered the territory around those two cities from the Philistines . And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites .
CEB	1%20Samuel	7	15	Samuel served as Israel ’ s judge his whole life .
CEB	1%20Samuel	7	16	Each year he traveled between Bethel , Gilgal , and Mizpah , serving as Israel ’ s judge in each of those locations .
CEB	1%20Samuel	7	17	Then he would return to Ramah because that ’ s where his home was . In Ramah too he served as Israel ’ s judge , and that is also where he built an altar to the Lord . Footnotes -
CEB	1%20Samuel	8	1	Samuel 8:16 LXX ; MT young men
CEB	1%20Samuel	8	8	They are doing to you only what they ’ ve been doing to me [ a ] from the day I brought them out of Egypt to this very minute , abandoning me and worshipping other gods .
CEB	1%20Samuel	8	2	The name of his oldest son was Joel ; the name of the second was Abijah . They served as judges in Beer-sheba .
CEB	1%20Samuel	8	3	But Samuel ’ s sons didn ’ t follow in his footsteps . They tried to turn a profit , they accepted bribes , and they perverted justice .
CEB	1%20Samuel	8	4	So all the Israelite elders got together and went to Samuel at Ramah .
CEB	1%20Samuel	8	5	They said to him , “ Listen . You are old now , and your sons don ’ t follow in your footsteps . So appoint us a king to judge us like all the other nations have. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	8	6	It seemed very bad to Samuel when they said , “ Give us a king to judge us , ” so he prayed to the Lord .
CEB	1%20Samuel	8	7	The Lord answered Samuel , “ Comply with the people ’ s request—everything they ask of you—because they haven ’ t rejected you . No , they ’ ve rejected me as king over them .
CEB	1%20Samuel	8	9	So comply with their request , but give them a clear warning , telling them how the king will rule over them. ” [ b ]
CEB	1%20Samuel	8	10	Then Samuel explained everything the Lord had said to the people who were asking for a king .
CEB	1%20Samuel	8	11	“ This is how the king will rule over you , ” Samuel said : “ He will take your sons , and will use them for his chariots and his cavalry and as runners for his chariot .
CEB	1%20Samuel	8	12	He will use them as his commanders of troops of one thousand and troops of fifty , or to do his plowing and his harvesting , or to make his weapons or parts for his chariots .
CEB	1%20Samuel	8	13	He will take your daughters to be perfumers , cooks , or bakers .
CEB	1%20Samuel	8	14	He will take your best fields , vineyards , and olive groves and give them to his servants .
CEB	1%20Samuel	8	15	He will give one-tenth of your grain and your vineyards to his officials and servants .
CEB	1%20Samuel	8	16	He will take your male and female servants , along with the best of your cattle [ c ] and donkeys , and make them do his work .
CEB	1%20Samuel	8	17	He will take one-tenth of your flocks , and then you yourselves will become his slaves !
CEB	1%20Samuel	8	18	When that day comes , you will cry out because of the king you chose for yourselves , but on that day the Lord won ’ t answer you. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	8	19	But the people refused to listen to Samuel and said , “ No ! There must be a king over us
CEB	1%20Samuel	8	20	so we can be like all the other nations . Our king will judge us and lead us and fight our battles. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	8	21	Samuel listened to everything the people said and repeated it directly to the Lord .
CEB	1%20Samuel	8	22	Then the Lord said to Samuel , “ Comply with their request . Give them a king. ” Samuel then told the Israelite people , “ Go back , each of you , to your own hometown. ” Footnotes -
CEB	1%20Samuel	9	1	Samuel 9:25 LXX ; MT He ( Samuel ? ) talked with Saul on the roof . Then they got up early .
CEB	1%20Samuel	9	9	Earlier in Israel , someone going to consult with God would say , “ Let ’ s go to the seer , ” because the people who are called prophets today were previously called seers . )
CEB	1%20Samuel	9	2	He had a son named Saul , who was a handsome young man . No one in Israel was more handsome than Saul , and he stood head and shoulders above everyone else .
CEB	1%20Samuel	9	3	When the donkeys belonging to Saul ’ s father Kish were lost , Kish said to his son Saul , “ Take one of the servant boys with you and go look for the donkeys. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	9	4	So he traveled through the highlands of Ephraim and the land of Shalishah , but they didn ’ t find anything . They traveled through the land of Shaalim , but still found nothing , so they crossed back into the land of Benjamin , but they still couldn ’ t find the donkeys .
CEB	1%20Samuel	9	5	When they came to the territory of Zuph , Saul said to the boy who was with him , “ Let ’ s go back before my father stops worrying about the donkeys and starts worrying about us. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	9	6	But the boy said to him , “ Listen , there ’ s a man of God in this town . He ’ s famous—everything he says actually happens ! So let ’ s go there . Maybe he ’ ll be able to tell us which way we should go. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	9	7	Saul said to his young boy , “ But if we go , what should we bring to the man ? The food in our bags is all gone . We don ’ t have any gift to offer the man of God . Do we have anything ? ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	9	8	“ Here , ” the boy answered Saul , “ I ’ ve got a quarter-shekel of silver . I ’ ll give that to the man of God so he tells us which way to go. ” (
CEB	1%20Samuel	9	10	Saul said to the boy , “ Great idea ! Let ’ s go. ” So they went into the town where the man of God lived .
CEB	1%20Samuel	9	11	They were going up the hill to the town when they met some young women coming out to draw water . “ Is the seer here ? ” they asked them .
CEB	1%20Samuel	9	12	“ He ’ s just ahead of you , ” they answered . “ Hurry up ! He has just come to town because there is a sacrifice today for the people at the shrine .
CEB	1%20Samuel	9	13	You ’ ll find him as soon as you enter the town , before he goes up to the shrine to eat . The people won ’ t eat until he gets there , because he must bless the sacrifice . Only after that can the invited guests eat . Now get going because you ’ ll find him momentarily. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	9	14	So Saul and the boy went up to the town , and as they entered it , suddenly Samuel came toward them on his way up to the shrine .
CEB	1%20Samuel	9	15	Now the day before Saul came , the Lord had revealed the following to Samuel :
CEB	1%20Samuel	9	16	“ About this time tomorrow I will send you a man from the Benjaminite territory . You will anoint him as leader of my people Israel . He will save my people from the Philistines ’ power because I have seen the suffering of [ a ] my people , and their cry for help has reached me. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	9	17	When Samuel saw Saul , the Lord told him , “ That ’ s the man I told you about . That ’ s the one who will rule [ b ] my people. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	9	18	Saul approached Samuel in the city gate and said , “ Please tell me where the seer ’ s house is. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	9	19	“ I ’ m the seer , ” Samuel told Saul . “ Go on ahead of me to the shrine . You can eat with me today . In the morning I ’ ll send you on your way , and I will tell you everything you want to know .
CEB	1%20Samuel	9	20	As for the donkeys you lost three days ago , don ’ t be worried about them because they ’ ve been found . Who owns all of Israel ’ s treasures , anyway ? Isn ’ t it you and your whole family ? ” [ c ]
CEB	1%20Samuel	9	21	“ I ’ m a Benjaminite , ” Saul responded , “ from the smallest Israelite tribe , and my family is the littlest of the families in the tribe of Benjamin . Why would you say something like that to me ? ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	9	22	Then Samuel took Saul and his young servant and brought them to the banquet room . He gave them an honored place among the invited guests . There were about thirty total .
CEB	1%20Samuel	9	23	Samuel said to the cook , “ Serve the portion I gave you—the one I told you to set aside. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	9	24	So the cook took the thigh and what was on it , [ d ] and put it in front of Saul . Samuel said , “ Look , what had been reserved is now in front of you . Eat up , because it was set apart for you for this specific occasion , ever since I invited the guests. ” [ e ] So Saul ate with Samuel that day .
CEB	1%20Samuel	9	25	When they came back from the shrine to the town , a bed was made for Saul on the roof , and he slept . [ f ]
CEB	1%20Samuel	9	26	Near dawn , Samuel called to Saul on the roof , “ Wake up ! I will send you on your way. ” So Saul got up , and the two of them , he and Samuel , went outside .
CEB	1%20Samuel	9	27	As they were nearing the edge of town Samuel said , “ Tell the boy to go on ahead of us ” ( the servant did so ) “ but you stop for a bit so I can tell you God ’ s word. ” Footnotes -
CEB	1%20Samuel	10	1	Samuel 10:27 This paragraph is found in DSS ( 4QSama ) and is also attested in Josephus ( Ant . 6.5.1 [ 68-71 ] ) , but is missing in MT .
CEB	1%20Samuel	10	10	When Saul and the boy got to Gibeah , there was a group of prophets coming to meet him . God ’ s spirit came over Saul , and he was caught up in a prophetic frenzy right along with them .
CEB	1%20Samuel	10	2	When you leave me today , you will meet two men near Rachel ’ s tomb at Zelzah on the border of Benjamin . They will tell you , ‘ The donkeys you went looking for have been found . Now your father has stopped thinking about the donkeys and is worried about you . He ’ s asking : What should I do about my son ? ’
CEB	1%20Samuel	10	3	Then , when you ’ ve gone on a bit farther , you will come to the oak at Tabor . Three men who are going to consult God at Bethel will meet up with you there , one carrying three young goats , one carrying three loaves of bread , and one carrying a jar of wine .
CEB	1%20Samuel	10	4	They will ask how you ’ re doing and will offer you sacrificial bread , [ b ] which you should accept .
CEB	1%20Samuel	10	5	After that , you will come to Gibeath-elohim , which is a Philistine fort . When you enter the town , you will encounter a group of prophets coming down from the shrine preceded by harps , tambourines , flutes , and lyres . They will be caught up in a prophetic frenzy .
CEB	1%20Samuel	10	6	Then the Lord ’ s spirit will come over you , and you will be caught up in a prophetic frenzy right along with them ; it will be like you ’ ve become a completely different person .
CEB	1%20Samuel	10	7	Once these signs have happened to you , do whatever you would like to do , because God is with you .
CEB	1%20Samuel	10	8	Then go down to Gilgal ahead of me . I ’ ll come down to meet you to offer entirely burned offerings and to make well-being sacrifices . Wait seven days until I get to you , then I ’ ll tell you what you should do next. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	10	9	And just as Saul turned to leave Samuel ’ s side , God gave him a different heart , and all these signs happened that very same day .
CEB	1%20Samuel	10	11	When all the people who had known Saul saw him prophesying with the prophets , they said to each other , “ What ’ s happened to Kish ’ s son ? Is Saul also one of the prophets ? ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	10	12	One of the locals then asked , “ And who is their leader ? ” [ c ] So it became a proverb : “ Is Saul also one of the prophets ? ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	10	13	When the prophetic frenzy was over , Saul went home . [ d ]
CEB	1%20Samuel	10	14	Saul ’ s uncle said to him and to his young servant , “ Where did you go ? ” “ To look for the donkeys , ” Saul replied , “ but when we couldn ’ t find anything , we went to Samuel. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	10	15	“ Please tell me what Samuel told you , ” Saul ’ s uncle said .
CEB	1%20Samuel	10	16	“ He reassured us that the donkeys had been found , ” Saul answered . But Saul didn ’ t tell his uncle what Samuel had said about the kingship . Saul selected as king
CEB	1%20Samuel	10	17	Samuel summoned the people to the Lord at Mizpah .
CEB	1%20Samuel	10	18	Then he told the Israelites : “ This is what the Lord God of Israel says : I brought Israel up out of Egypt , and I delivered you from the Egyptians ’ power and from the power of all the kingdoms that oppressed you .
CEB	1%20Samuel	10	19	But today you ’ ve rejected your God who saved you from all your troubles and difficulties by saying , ‘ No ! Appoint a king over us ! ’ So now assemble yourselves before the Lord by your tribes and clans. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	10	20	Then Samuel brought all the Israelite tribes forward , and the tribe of Benjamin was selected .
CEB	1%20Samuel	10	21	Next Samuel brought the tribe of Benjamin forward by its families , and the family of Matri was selected . Samuel then brought the family of Matri forward , person by person , [ e ] and Saul , Kish ’ s son , was selected . But when they looked for him , he wasn ’ t to be found .
CEB	1%20Samuel	10	22	So they asked another question of the Lord : “ Has the man come here yet ? ” The Lord said , “ Yes , he ’ s hiding among the supplies. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	10	23	They ran and retrieved Saul from there , and when he stood up in the middle of the people , he was head and shoulders taller than anyone else .
CEB	1%20Samuel	10	24	“ Can you see the one the Lord has chosen ? ” Samuel asked all the people . “ He has no equal among the people. ” Then the people shouted , “ Long live the king ! ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	10	25	Samuel then explained to the people how the monarchy should operate [ f ] and wrote it in a scroll and placed it in the Lord ’ s presence . Then Samuel sent every person back to their homes .
CEB	1%20Samuel	10	26	Saul also went back to his home in Gibeah . Along with him went courageous men whose hearts God had touched .
CEB	1%20Samuel	10	27	But some despicable people said , “ How can this man save us ? ” They despised Saul and didn ’ t bring him gifts , but Saul didn ’ t say anything . Saul delivers Jabesh-gilead [ g ] Nahash the Ammonite king had been severely oppressing the Gadites and the Reubenites . He gouged out everyone ’ s right eye , thereby not allowing Israel to have a deliverer . There wasn ’ t a single Israelite left across the Jordan River who hadn ’ t had their right eye gouged out by the Ammonite king Nahash . But seven thousand people had escaped from the Ammonites ’ power and fled to Jabesh-gilead . Footnotes -
CEB	1%20Samuel	11	1	Samuel 11:7 MT lacks to Saul .
CEB	1%20Samuel	11	11	The next day Saul organized his troops into three formations . They attacked the Ammonite camp during the morning watch and slaughtered them until the heat of the day . The survivors were so scattered that not even two of them could be found together .
CEB	1%20Samuel	11	2	“ I will make a treaty with you on one condition : that everyone ’ s right eye be gouged out ! ” Nahash the Ammonite said to them . “ That ’ s how I bring humiliation on all Israel. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	11	3	The elders of Jabesh replied to him , “ Leave us alone for seven days so we can send messengers thoughout Israel ’ s territory . If there ’ s no one to save us , then we ’ ll surrender to you. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	11	4	When the messengers reached Gibeah where Saul lived , they reported the news directly to the people there . Then they all wept aloud .
CEB	1%20Samuel	11	5	At just that moment , Saul was coming back from keeping the cattle in the fields . “ What ’ s wrong with everybody ? ” he asked . “ Why are they crying ? ” Saul was then told what the men from Jabesh had said .
CEB	1%20Samuel	11	6	God ’ s spirit came over Saul when he heard those words , and he burned with anger .
CEB	1%20Samuel	11	7	He took two oxen , cut them into pieces , and sent them by messengers throughout Israel ’ s territory . “ This is exactly what will be done to the oxen of anyone who doesn ’ t come to the aid of Saul and Samuel , ” he said . Great fear of the Lord came over the people , and they came to Saul completely unified . [ b ]
CEB	1%20Samuel	11	8	When Saul counted them at Bezek , the soldiers from Israel totaled three hundred thousand and those from Judah thirty thousand .
CEB	1%20Samuel	11	9	The messengers who had come were then told , “ Say this to the people of Jabesh-gilead : Tomorrow by the time the sun is hot , you will be saved. ” When the messengers returned and reported this to the people of Jabesh , they were overjoyed .
CEB	1%20Samuel	11	10	Then the people of Jabesh told the Ammonites , “ We will surrender to you tomorrow . Then you can do whatever you want to us. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	11	12	Then people asked Samuel , “ Who was it who said , ‘ Will Saul rule over us ? ’ Give us those people ; we ’ ll kill them ! ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	11	13	But Saul said , “ No one will be executed because today the Lord has saved Israel. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	11	14	“ Let ’ s go to Gilgal , ” Samuel told the people , “ and renew the monarchy there. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	11	15	So everyone went to Gilgal , and there at Gilgal they made Saul king in the Lord ’ s presence . They offered well-being sacrifices in the Lord ’ s presence , and Saul and all the Israelites held a great celebration there . Footnotes -
CEB	1%20Samuel	12	1	Samuel 12:15 LXXL ; MT against you and against your ancestors
CEB	1%20Samuel	12	12	But when you saw that Nahash the Ammonite king was coming against you , you said to me , ‘ No ! There must be a king to rule over us. ’ But the Lord your God was already your king !
CEB	1%20Samuel	12	2	The king will lead you now . I am old and gray , though my sons are still with you , and I ’ ve been your leader since I was young until now .
CEB	1%20Samuel	12	3	So I ’ m here : Tell the truth about me in the presence of the Lord and his anointed . Have I ever stolen someone ’ s ox ? Have I ever taken someone ’ s donkey ? Have I ever oppressed or mistreated anyone ? Have I ever taken bribes from someone and looked the other way about something ? Tell me the truth . [ a ] I will make it right. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	12	4	“ You haven ’ t oppressed or mistreated us , and you ’ ve never taken anything from anyone , ” the people answered .
CEB	1%20Samuel	12	5	Samuel replied , “ The Lord and his anointed one are witnesses against you today that you haven ’ t found anything in my possession. ” “ Agreed , ” they said .
CEB	1%20Samuel	12	6	Then Samuel told the people : “ The witness [ b ] is indeed the Lord , who appointed Moses and Aaron and brought your ancestors up from the land of Egypt .
CEB	1%20Samuel	12	7	So now stand here , and I will judge you in the Lord ’ s presence because of all the Lord ’ s righteous acts that he has done for you and your ancestors :
CEB	1%20Samuel	12	8	“ When Jacob entered Egypt , the Egyptians oppressed them . [ c ] So your ancestors cried out to the Lord . The Lord then sent Moses and Aaron , who brought your ancestors out of Egypt and settled them here .
CEB	1%20Samuel	12	9	But your ancestors forgot the Lord their God , so he handed them over to Sisera the commander of Hazor ’ s army , and to the Philistines , and to the Moabite king , all of whom fought against them .
CEB	1%20Samuel	12	10	Then your ancestors cried out to the Lord and said : ‘ We have sinned because we have abandoned the Lord and have worshipped the Baals and the Astartes . But now deliver us from the power of our enemies , and we will worship you. ’
CEB	1%20Samuel	12	11	So the Lord sent Jerubbaal , Barak , [ d ] Jephthah , and Samson , [ e ] and he delivered you from the power of your enemies on every side . And you lived safe and secure .
CEB	1%20Samuel	12	13	“ So now , here is the king you chose , the one you asked for . Yes , the Lord has put a king over you !
CEB	1%20Samuel	12	14	If you will fear the Lord , worship him , obey him , and not rebel against the Lord ’ s command , and if both you and the king who rules over you follow the Lord your God—all will be well .
CEB	1%20Samuel	12	15	But if you don ’ t obey the Lord and rebel against the Lord ’ s command , then the Lord ’ s power will go against you and your king to destroy you . [ f ]
CEB	1%20Samuel	12	16	“ So now take a stand ! Look at this awesome thing the Lord is doing .
CEB	1%20Samuel	12	17	Isn ’ t the wheat harvest today ? I will call upon the Lord to send thunder and rain . Then you will know and will see for yourselves what great evil you ’ ve done in the Lord ’ s eyes by asking for a king. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	12	18	Samuel called upon the Lord , and God sent thunder and rain on that very day . Then all the people were in awe of the Lord and Samuel .
CEB	1%20Samuel	12	19	All of them said to Samuel , “ Please pray for us , your servants , to the Lord your God so we don ’ t die because we have added to our many sins the evil of asking for a king. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	12	20	But Samuel answered the people , “ Don ’ t be afraid . Yes , you ’ ve done all this evil ; just don ’ t turn back from following the Lord . Serve the Lord with all your heart .
CEB	1%20Samuel	12	21	Don ’ t turn aside to follow useless idols that can ’ t help you or save you . They ’ re absolutely useless !
CEB	1%20Samuel	12	22	For the sake of his reputation , the Lord won ’ t abandon his people , because the Lord has decided to make you his very own people .

CEB	1%20Samuel	13	2	Saul selected three thousand men from Israel . Two thousand of those were with Saul at Michmash in the hills near Bethel , and one thousand were with Jonathan at Gibeah in Benjamin . He sent the remaining men home .
CEB	1%20Samuel	13	3	Jonathan attacked the Philistine fort at Geba , and the Philistines heard about it . So Saul sounded the alarm [ c ] throughout the land and said , “ Hebrews ! Listen up ! ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	13	4	When all Israel heard that Saul had attacked the Philistine fort and that Israel was hated by the Philistines , the troops were called to Saul ’ s side at Gilgal .
CEB	1%20Samuel	13	5	The Philistines also were gathered to fight against Israel . They brought thirty thousand chariots with them , six thousand cavalry , and as many soldiers as there is sand on the seashore to fight Israel . [ d ] They marched up and camped at Michmash , east of Beth-aven .
CEB	1%20Samuel	13	6	When the Israelites saw that they were in trouble and that their troops were threatened , they hid in caves , in thickets , among rocks , in tunnels , and in cisterns .
CEB	1%20Samuel	13	7	Some Hebrews even crossed the Jordan River , going into the land of Gad and Gilead . Saul stayed at Gilgal , and the troops followed him anxiously .
CEB	1%20Samuel	13	8	He waited seven days , the time appointed by Samuel , but Samuel didn ’ t come to Gilgal , and his troops began to desert .
CEB	1%20Samuel	13	9	So Saul ordered , “ Bring me the entirely burned offering and the well-being sacrifices. ” Then he offered the entirely burned offering .
CEB	1%20Samuel	13	10	The very moment Saul finished offering up the entirely burned offering , Samuel arrived . Saul went out to meet him and welcome him .
CEB	1%20Samuel	13	11	But Samuel said , “ What have you done ? ” “ I saw that my troops were deserting , ” Saul replied . “ You hadn ’ t arrived by the appointed time , and the Philistines were gathering at Michmash .
CEB	1%20Samuel	13	12	I thought , The Philistines are about to march against me at Gilgal and I haven ’ t yet sought the Lord ’ s favor . So I took control of myself [ e ] and offered the entirely burned offering. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	13	14	but now your rule won ’ t last . The Lord will search for a man following the Lord ’ s own heart , [ f ] and the Lord will commission him as leader over God ’ s people , because you didn ’ t keep the Lord ’ s command. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	13	15	Samuel got up and went on his way from Gilgal , but the rest of the people followed Saul to join the army , and they went from Gilgal [ g ] to Gibeah in Benjamin . Saul counted about six hundred men still with him .
CEB	1%20Samuel	13	16	Saul , his son Jonathan , and the people who were with him were staying at Geba in Benjamin , while the Philistines camped at Michmash .
CEB	1%20Samuel	13	17	Three raiding parties left the Philistine camp . One took the road to Ophrah toward the territory of Shual .
CEB	1%20Samuel	13	18	Another took the road to Beth-horon , and the last took the border road that overlooks the Zeboim Valley toward the desert . Philistine ironworking
CEB	1%20Samuel	13	19	No metalworker was to be found anywhere in Israelite territory because the Philistines had said , “ The Hebrews must not make swords and spears. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	13	20	So every Israelite had to go down to the Philistines to sharpen their plowshares , mattocks , axes , and sickles .
CEB	1%20Samuel	13	21	The cost was two-thirds of a shekel [ h ] for plowshares and mattocks , but one-third of a shekel for sharpening axes and for setting goads .
CEB	1%20Samuel	13	22	So on the day of the battle , no swords or spears were to be found in the possession of any of the troops with Saul and Jonathan , but Saul and his son Jonathan had them . Jonathan leads Israel to victory

CEB	1%20Samuel	14	1	Samuel 14:47 LXX
CEB	1%20Samuel	14	14	In the first attack , Jonathan and his armor-bearer killed about twenty men in an area of about half an acre . [ c ]
CEB	1%20Samuel	14	2	Saul was sitting on the outskirts of Gibeah under the pomegranate tree at Migron . He had about six hundred men with him ,
CEB	1%20Samuel	14	3	including Ahijah , the son of Ahitub , who was Ichabod ’ s brother and the son of Phinehas the son of Eli , who was the Lord ’ s priest at Shiloh . He was wearing a priestly vest . [ a ] None of the troops knew that Jonathan had gone .
CEB	1%20Samuel	14	4	There were two stone outcroppings in the pass where Jonathan planned on crossing over to the Philistine fort—one on each side . One of these was named Bozez ; the other was named Seneh .
CEB	1%20Samuel	14	5	One outcropping was on the north side , in front of Michmash , and the other was on the south side , in front of Geba .
CEB	1%20Samuel	14	6	Jonathan said to his young armor-bearer , “ Come on , let ’ s go over to the fort of these uncircumcised men . Maybe the Lord will act on our behalf . After all , nothing can stop the Lord from saving , whether there are many soldiers [ b ] or few. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	14	7	“ Go ahead with whatever you ’ re planning , ” his armor-bearer replied . “ I ’ m with you , whatever you decide. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	14	8	“ All right then , ” Jonathan said . “ We ’ ll go over to the men and show ourselves .
CEB	1%20Samuel	14	9	If they say to us , ‘ Stay there until we get to you , ’ then we ’ ll stay where we are and won ’ t go up to them .
CEB	1%20Samuel	14	10	But if they say , ‘ Come on up , ’ then we ’ ll go up because that will be the sign that the Lord has handed them over to us. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	14	11	So they showed themselves to the Philistine fort , and the Philistines said , “ Look , the Hebrews are coming out of the holes they ’ ve been hiding in ! ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	14	12	Then the troops in the fort yelled to Jonathan and his armor-bearer , “ Come on up ! We ’ ll teach you a lesson ! ” So Jonathan said to his armor-bearer , “ Follow me , because the Lord has handed them over to Israel ! ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	14	13	So Jonathan scrambled up on his hands and feet with his armor-bearer right behind him . The Philistines fell before Jonathan . His armor-bearer , coming behind him , would then finish them off .
CEB	1%20Samuel	14	15	Panic broke out in the camp , in the field , and among all the troops . Even those in the fort and the raiders shook with fear . The very ground shook ! It was a terror from God .
CEB	1%20Samuel	14	16	Now Saul ’ s lookouts at Gibeah in Benjamin saw the Philistine camp running all over the place . [ d ]
CEB	1%20Samuel	14	17	Saul said to the troops with him , “ Take a count and see who is missing. ” So they counted , and Jonathan and his armor-bearer were gone .
CEB	1%20Samuel	14	18	Saul said to Ahijah , “ Bring the priestly vest ! ” [ e ] because at that time , Ahijah wore the priestly vest in Israel ’ s presence . [ f ]
CEB	1%20Samuel	14	19	As Saul was talking to the priest , the confusion in the Philistine camp continued to grow . Saul said to the priest , “ Withdraw your hand. ” [ g ]
CEB	1%20Samuel	14	20	Then Saul called all his troops together , and they went into battle . The Philistines were completely confused ; every soldier ’ s sword was turned against his fellow soldier .
CEB	1%20Samuel	14	21	Even those Hebrews who had earlier joined up with the Philistines and moved into their camp changed sides to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan .
CEB	1%20Samuel	14	22	Similarly , when all the Israelites who had been hiding in the highlands of Ephraim heard that the Philistines were on the run , they also joined the battle in hot pursuit of the Philistines .
CEB	1%20Samuel	14	23	The Lord saved Israel that day , and the fighting carried on beyond Beth-aven .
CEB	1%20Samuel	14	24	Now the Israelite soldiers were in a difficult situation that day because Saul had bound the troops by a solemn pledge : “ Anyone who eats anything before evening when I have taken revenge on my enemies is doomed. ” So none of the army ate anything .
CEB	1%20Samuel	14	25	The troops [ h ] came across a honeycomb with honey on the ground .
CEB	1%20Samuel	14	26	But even when they came across the honeycomb with the honey still flowing , no one ate any of it because the troops were afraid of the solemn pledge .
CEB	1%20Samuel	14	27	But Jonathan hadn ’ t heard his father make the people swear the pledge , so he dipped the end of the staff he was carrying into the honeycomb . When he ate some his eyes lit up .
CEB	1%20Samuel	14	28	Then one of the soldiers spoke up : “ Your father bound the troops by a solemn pledge : ‘ Anyone who eats food today is doomed. ’ That ’ s why the troops are exhausted. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	14	29	Jonathan said , “ My father has brought trouble to the land . Look how my eyes lit up when I tasted just a bit of that honey !
CEB	1%20Samuel	14	30	It would have been even better if the troops had eaten some of their enemies ’ plunder today when they found it ! But now the Philistine defeat isn ’ t as thorough as it might have been. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	14	31	That day , after they had fought the Philistines from Michmash to Aijalon , the troops were completely exhausted .
CEB	1%20Samuel	14	32	So the troops tore into the plunder , taking sheep , cattle , and calves . They slaughtered them right on the ground and devoured them with the blood still in them .
CEB	1%20Samuel	14	33	When it was reported to Saul , “ The troops are sinning against the Lord by eating meat with blood in it , ” Saul said , “ All of you are traitors ! Roll a large stone over here right now .
CEB	1%20Samuel	14	34	Go among the troops and say to them , ‘ Everyone must bring their ox or sheep , and slaughter them here with me . Don ’ t sin against the Lord by eating meat with blood still in it. ’ ” So everyone brought whatever they had and slaughtered it there . [ i ]
CEB	1%20Samuel	14	35	And Saul built an altar to the Lord . It was the first altar he had built to the Lord .
CEB	1%20Samuel	14	36	“ Let ’ s go after the Philistines tonight and plunder them until morning , ” Saul said . “ We won ’ t leave them a single survivor ! ” “ Do whatever you think is best , ” the troops replied . But the priest said , “ Let ’ s ask God first. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	14	37	So Saul questioned God : “ Should I go after the Philistines ? Will you hand them over to Israel ? ” But God did not answer him that day .
CEB	1%20Samuel	14	38	Then Saul said , “ All you officers in the army , come forward ! Let ’ s find out what sin was committed today .
CEB	1%20Samuel	14	39	As surely as the Lord lives—the one who has saved Israel—even if it ’ s my own son Jonathan , that person will be executed. ” Not one of the soldiers answered him .
CEB	1%20Samuel	14	40	So Saul said to all Israel , “ You be on one side , and my son Jonathan and I will be on the other. ” “ Do whatever you think is best , ” the troops said .
CEB	1%20Samuel	14	41	Then Saul asked the Lord God of Israel , “ Why haven ’ t you answered your servant today ? If the wrongdoing is mine or my son Jonathan ’ s , respond with Urim , but if the wrongdoing belongs to your people Israel , respond with Thummim. ” [ j ] Jonathan and Saul were taken by lot , and the troops were cleared .
CEB	1%20Samuel	14	42	Then Saul said , “ Decide between me and my son Jonathan. ” [ k ] And Jonathan was selected .
CEB	1%20Samuel	14	43	“ Tell me what you ’ ve done , ” Saul said to Jonathan . So Jonathan told him . “ I only took a very small taste of honey on the end of my staff , ” he said . “ And now I ’ m supposed to die ? ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	14	44	“ May God deal harshly with me and worse still if you don ’ t die today ! ” [ l ] Saul swore .
CEB	1%20Samuel	14	45	But the troops said to Saul , “ Why should Jonathan die when he has won this great victory for Israel ? No way ! As surely as the Lord lives , not one hair off his head will fall to the ground , because he did this today with God ’ s help. ” So the troops rescued Jonathan , and he wasn ’ t executed .
CEB	1%20Samuel	14	46	Then Saul stopped chasing the Philistines , and the Philistines went back to their own country . Saul ’ s wars
CEB	1%20Samuel	14	47	Saul secured his kingship over Israel . He fought against his enemies on every side : against Moab , the Ammonites , Edom , the king of Zobah , [ m ] and the Philistines . Wherever he turned , he was victorious . [ n ]
CEB	1%20Samuel	14	48	He acted heroically , defeating the Amalekites and rescuing Israel from the power of any who had plundered them .
CEB	1%20Samuel	14	49	Saul ’ s sons were Jonathan , Ishvi , and Malchishua . The names of his two daughters were Merab , the oldest , and Michal , the younger daughter .
CEB	1%20Samuel	14	50	The name of Saul ’ s wife was Ahinoam , Ahimaaz ’ s daughter . The name of his general was Abner , Ner ’ s son , Saul ’ s uncle .
CEB	1%20Samuel	14	51	Kish , Saul ’ s father , and Ner , Abner ’ s father , were Abiel ’ s sons .
CEB	1%20Samuel	14	52	There was fierce warfare against the Philistines throughout Saul ’ s lifetime . So whenever Saul saw any strong or heroic man , he would add him to his troops . Footnotes -

CEB	1%20Samuel	15	15	,
CEB	1%20Samuel	15	2	This is what the Lord of heavenly forces says : I am going to punish the Amalekites for what they did to Israel : how they attacked the Israelites as they came up from Egypt .
CEB	1%20Samuel	15	3	So go ! Attack the Amalekites ; put everything that belongs to them under the ban . [ a ] Spare no one . Kill men and women , children and infants , oxen and sheep , camels and donkeys. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	15	4	Saul called out the troops and counted them at Telaim : two hundred thousand foot soldiers and ten thousand more troops from Judah .
CEB	1%20Samuel	15	5	Then Saul advanced on the Amalekite city and laid an ambush in the valley .
CEB	1%20Samuel	15	6	Saul told the Kenites , “ Get going ! Leave the Amalekites immediately because you showed kindness to the Israelites when they came out of Egypt . Otherwise , I ’ ll destroy you right along with them. ” So the Kenites left the Amalekites .
CEB	1%20Samuel	15	7	Then Saul attacked the Amalekites from Havilah all the way to Shur , which is near Egypt .
CEB	1%20Samuel	15	8	He captured Agag the Amalekite king alive , but Saul placed all the people under the ban , killing them with the sword .
CEB	1%20Samuel	15	9	Saul and the troops spared Agag along with the best sheep , cattle , fattened calves , [ b ] lambs , and everything of value . They weren ’ t willing to put them under the ban ; but anything that was despised or of no value [ c ] they placed under the ban .
CEB	1%20Samuel	15	10	Then the Lord ’ s word came to Samuel :
CEB	1%20Samuel	15	11	“ I regret making Saul king because he has turned away from following me and hasn ’ t done what I said. ” Samuel was upset at this , and he prayed to the Lord all night long .
CEB	1%20Samuel	15	12	Samuel got up early in the morning to meet Saul , and was told , “ Saul went to Carmel , where he is setting up a monument for himself . Then he left and went down to Gilgal. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	15	13	When Samuel reached Saul , [ d ] Saul greeted him , “ The Lord bless you ! I have done what the Lord said. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	15	14	“ Then what , ” Samuel asked , “ is this bleating of sheep in my ears and mooing of cattle I hear ? ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	15	16	Samuel then said to Saul , “ Enough ! Let me tell you what the Lord said to me last night. ” “ Tell me , ” Saul replied .
CEB	1%20Samuel	15	17	Samuel said , “ Even if you think you are insignificant , aren ’ t you the leader of Israel ’ s tribes ? The Lord anointed you king over Israel .

CEB	1%20Samuel	15	19	Why didn ’ t you obey the Lord ? You did evil in the Lord ’ s eyes when you tore into the plunder ! ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	15	20	“ But I did obey the Lord ! ” Saul protested to Samuel . “ I went on the mission the Lord sent me on . I captured Agag the Amalekite king , and I put the Amalekites under the ban .
CEB	1%20Samuel	15	21	Yes , the troops took sheep and cattle from the plunder—the very best items placed under the ban—but in order to sacrifice them to the Lord your God at Gilgal. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	15	22	Then Samuel replied , “ Does the Lord want entirely burned offerings and sacrifices as much as obedience to the Lord ? Listen to this : obeying is better than sacrificing , paying attention is better than fat from rams ,
CEB	1%20Samuel	15	23	because rebellion is as bad as the sin of divination ; arrogance is like the evil of idolatry . [ e ] Because you have rejected what the Lord said , he has rejected you as king. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	15	24	Saul said to Samuel , “ I have sinned because I disobeyed the Lord ’ s command and your instructions . I was afraid of the troops and obeyed them .
CEB	1%20Samuel	15	25	But now please forgive my sin ! Come back with me , so I can worship the Lord. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	15	26	But Samuel said to Saul , “ I can ’ t [ f ] return with you because you have rejected what the Lord said , and the Lord has rejected you from being king over Israel. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	15	27	Samuel turned to leave , but Saul grabbed at the edge of his robe , and it ripped .
CEB	1%20Samuel	15	28	Then Samuel told him , “ The Lord has ripped the kingdom of Israel from you today . He will give it to a friend of yours , someone who is more worthy than you .
CEB	1%20Samuel	15	29	What ’ s more , the enduring one of Israel doesn ’ t take back what he says and doesn ’ t change his mind . He is not a human being who would change his mind. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	15	30	“ I have sinned , ” Saul said , “ but please honor me in front of my people ’ s elders and before Israel , and come back with me so I can worship the Lord your God. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	15	31	So Samuel went back with Saul , and Saul worshipped the Lord .
CEB	1%20Samuel	15	32	“ Bring me Agag the Amalekite king , ” Samuel said . Agag came to him in chains , asking , “ Would death have been as bitter as this is ? ” [ g ]
CEB	1%20Samuel	15	33	Samuel said , “ Just as your sword left women without their children , now your mother will be childless among women. ” Then Samuel cut Agag to pieces in the Lord ’ s presence at Gilgal .
CEB	1%20Samuel	15	34	Then Samuel went to Ramah , but Saul went up to his home in Gibeah .

CEB	1%20Samuel	16	3	Invite Jesse to the sacrifice , and I will make clear to you what you should do . You will anoint for me the person I point out to you. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	16	4	Samuel did what the Lord instructed . When he came to Bethlehem , the city elders came to meet him . They were shaking with fear . “ Do you come in peace ? ” they asked .
CEB	1%20Samuel	16	5	“ Yes , ” Samuel answered . “ I ’ ve come to make a sacrifice to the Lord . Now make yourselves holy , then come with me to the sacrifice. ” Samuel made Jesse and his sons holy and invited them to the sacrifice as well .
CEB	1%20Samuel	16	6	When they arrived , Samuel looked at Eliab and thought , That must be the Lord ’ s anointed right in front .
CEB	1%20Samuel	16	7	But the Lord said to Samuel , “ Have no regard for his appearance or stature , because I haven ’ t selected him . God [ b ] doesn ’ t look at things like humans do . Humans see only what is visible to the eyes , but the Lord sees into the heart. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	16	8	Next Jesse called for Abinadab , who presented himself to Samuel , but he said , “ The Lord hasn ’ t chosen this one either. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	16	9	So Jesse presented Shammah , but Samuel said , “ No , the Lord hasn ’ t chosen this one. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	16	10	Jesse presented seven of his sons to Samuel , but Samuel said to Jesse , “ The Lord hasn ’ t picked any of these. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	16	11	Then Samuel asked Jesse , “ Is that all of your boys ? ” “ There is still the youngest one , ” Jesse answered , “ but he ’ s out keeping the sheep. ” “ Send for him , ” Samuel told Jesse , “ because we can ’ t proceed until he gets here. ” [ c ]
CEB	1%20Samuel	16	12	So Jesse sent and brought him in . He was reddish brown , had beautiful eyes , and was good-looking . The Lord said , “ That ’ s the one . Go anoint him. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	16	13	So Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him right there in front of his brothers . The Lord ’ s spirit came over David from that point forward . Then Samuel left and went to Ramah . David is introduced to Saul
CEB	1%20Samuel	16	14	Now the Lord ’ s spirit had departed from Saul , and an evil spirit from the Lord tormented him .
CEB	1%20Samuel	16	15	Saul ’ s servants said to him , “ Look , an evil spirit from God is tormenting you .
CEB	1%20Samuel	16	17	Saul said to his servants , “ Find me a good musician and bring him to me. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	16	18	One of the servants responded , “ I know that one of Jesse ’ s sons from Bethlehem is a good musician . He ’ s a strong man and heroic , a warrior who speaks well and is good-looking too . The Lord is with him. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	16	19	So Saul sent messengers to Jesse to say , “ Send me your son David , the one who keeps the sheep. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	16	20	Jesse then took a donkey and loaded it with a homer of bread , [ d ] a jar of wine , and a young goat , and he sent it along with his son David to Saul .
CEB	1%20Samuel	16	21	That is how David came to Saul and entered his service . Saul liked David very much , [ e ] and David became his armor-bearer .
CEB	1%20Samuel	16	22	Saul sent a message to Jesse : “ Please allow David to remain in my service because I am pleased with him. ”

CEB	1%20Samuel	17	8	He stopped and shouted to the Israelite troops , “ Why have you come and taken up battle formations ? I am the Philistine champion , [ e ] and you are Saul ’ s servants . Isn ’ t that right ? Select one of your men , and let him come down against me .
CEB	1%20Samuel	17	9	If he is able to fight me and kill me , then we will become your slaves , but if I overcome him and kill him , then you will become our slaves and you will serve us .
CEB	1%20Samuel	17	10	I insult Israel ’ s troops today ! ” The Philistine continued , “ Give me an opponent , and we ’ ll fight ! ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	17	11	When Saul and all Israel heard what the Philistine said , they were distressed and terrified . [ f ]
CEB	1%20Samuel	17	12	Now David was Jesse ’ s son , an Ephraimite from Bethlehem in Judah who had eight sons . By Saul ’ s time , Jesse was already quite old and far along in age . [ g ]
CEB	1%20Samuel	17	13	Jesse ’ s three oldest sons had gone with Saul to war . Their names were Eliab the oldest , Abinadab the second oldest , and Shammah the third oldest .

CEB	1%20Samuel	17	20	So David got up early in the morning , left someone in charge of the flock , and loaded up and left , just as his father Jesse had instructed him . He reached the camp right when the army was taking up their battle formations and shouting the war cry .
CEB	1%20Samuel	17	21	Israel and the Philistines took up their battle formations opposite each other .

The king will reward with great riches whoever kills that man . The king will give his own daughter to him and make his household exempt from taxes [ i ] in Israel. ” )
CEB	1%20Samuel	17	26	David asked the soldiers standing by him , “ What will be done for the person who kills that Philistine over there and removes this insult from Israel ? Who is that uncircumcised Philistine , anyway , that he can get away with insulting the army of the living God ? ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	17	27	Then the troops repeated to him what they had been saying . “ So that ’ s what will be done for the man who kills him , ” they said .
CEB	1%20Samuel	17	28	When David ’ s oldest brother Eliab heard him talking to the soldiers , he got very mad at David . “ Why did you come down here ? ” he said . “ Who is watching those few sheep for you in the wilderness ? I know how arrogant you are and your devious plan : you came down just to see the battle ! ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	17	29	“ What did I do wrong this time ? ” David replied . “ It was just a question ! ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	17	30	So David turned to someone else and asked the same thing , and the people said the same thing in reply .
CEB	1%20Samuel	17	31	The things David had said were overheard and reported to Saul , who sent for him .
CEB	1%20Samuel	17	32	“ Don ’ t let anyone [ j ] lose courage because of this Philistine ! ” David told Saul . “ I , your servant , will go out and fight him ! ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	17	33	“ You can ’ t go out and fight this Philistine , ” Saul answered David . “ You are still a boy . But he ’ s been a warrior since he was a boy ! ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	17	34	“ Your servant has kept his father ’ s sheep , ” David replied to Saul , “ and if ever a lion or a bear came and carried off one of the flock ,
CEB	1%20Samuel	17	35	I would go after it , strike it , and rescue the animal from its mouth . If it turned on me , I would grab it at its jaw , strike it , and kill it .
CEB	1%20Samuel	17	36	Your servant has fought both lions and bears . This uncircumcised Philistine will be just like one of them because he has insulted the army of the living God .
CEB	1%20Samuel	17	37	“ The Lord , ” David added , “ who rescued me from the power of both lions and bears , will rescue me from the power of this Philistine. ” “ Go ! ” Saul replied to David . “ And may the Lord be with you ! ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	17	38	Then Saul dressed David in his own gear , putting a coat of armor on him and a bronze helmet on his head .
CEB	1%20Samuel	17	39	David strapped his sword on over the armor , but he couldn ’ t walk around well because he ’ d never tried it before . “ I can ’ t walk in this , ” David told Saul , “ because I ’ ve never tried it before. ” So he took them off .
CEB	1%20Samuel	17	40	He then grabbed his staff and chose five smooth stones from the streambed . He put them in the pocket of his shepherd ’ s bag and with sling in hand went out to the Philistine .
CEB	1%20Samuel	17	41	, 48b ,
CEB	1%20Samuel	17	42	When the Philistine looked David over , he sneered at David because he was just a boy ; reddish brown and good-looking .
CEB	1%20Samuel	17	43	The Philistine asked David , “ Am I some sort of dog that you come at me with sticks ? ” And he cursed David by his gods .
CEB	1%20Samuel	17	44	“ Come here , ” he said to David , “ and I ’ ll feed your flesh to the wild birds and the wild animals ! ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	17	45	But David told the Philistine , “ You are coming against me with sword , spear , and scimitar , but I come against you in the name of the Lord of heavenly forces , the God of Israel ’ s army , the one you ’ ve insulted .
CEB	1%20Samuel	17	46	Today the Lord will hand you over to me . I will strike you down and cut off your head ! Today I will feed your dead body and the dead bodies of the entire Philistine camp [ k ] to the wild birds and the wild animals . Then the whole world will know that there is a God on Israel ’ s side .
CEB	1%20Samuel	17	47	And all those gathered here will know that the Lord doesn ’ t save by means of sword and spear . The Lord owns this war , and he will hand all of you over to us. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	17	48	The Philistine got up and moved closer to attack David , and David ran quickly to the front line to face him .
CEB	1%20Samuel	17	49	David put his hand in his bag and took out a stone . He slung it , and it hit the Philistine on his forehead . The stone penetrated his forehead , and he fell facedown on the ground .
CEB	1%20Samuel	17	50	, 55-58 . -
CEB	1%20Samuel	17	51	Then David ran and stood over the Philistine . He grabbed the Philistine ’ s sword , drew it from its sheath , and finished him off . Then David cut off the Philistine ’ s head with the sword . When the Philistines saw that their hero was dead , they fled .
CEB	1%20Samuel	17	52	The soldiers from Israel and Judah jumped up with a shout and chased the Philistines all the way to Gath [ l ] and the gates of Ekron . The dead Philistines were littered along the Shaarim road all the way to Gath and Ekron .
CEB	1%20Samuel	17	53	When the Israelites came back from chasing the Philistines , they plundered their camp .
CEB	1%20Samuel	17	54	David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem , but he put the Philistine ’ s weapons in his own tent .
CEB	1%20Samuel	17	55	Now when Saul saw David go out to meet the Philistine , he asked Abner the army general , “ Abner , whose son is that boy ? ” “ As surely as you live , Your Majesty , I don ’ t know , ” Abner answered .
CEB	1%20Samuel	17	56	“ Then find out whose son that young man is , ” the king replied .
CEB	1%20Samuel	17	57	So when David came back from killing the Philistine , Abner sent for him and presented him to Saul . The Philistine ’ s head was still in David ’ s hand .
CEB	1%20Samuel	17	58	Saul said to him , “ Whose son are you , my boy ? ” “ I ’ m the son of your servant Jesse from Bethlehem , ” David answered . Footnotes -
CEB	1%20Samuel	18	1	Samuel 18:29 Or Saul became David ’ s constant enemy .
CEB	1%20Samuel	18	18	“ I ’ m not worthy , ” David replied to Saul , “ and neither is my family or my father ’ s clan in Israel , to become the king ’ s son-in-law. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	18	2	Sam 3:14 ; MT two hundred -
CEB	1%20Samuel	18	3	And Jonathan and David made a covenant together because Jonathan loved David as much as himself .
CEB	1%20Samuel	18	4	Jonathan took off the robe he was wearing and gave it to David , along with his armor , as well as his sword , his bow , and his belt .
CEB	1%20Samuel	18	5	David went out and was successful in every mission Saul sent him to do . So Saul placed him in charge of the soldiers , and this pleased all the troops as well as Saul ’ s servants . Saul jealous of David
CEB	1%20Samuel	18	6	After David came back from killing the Philistine , and as the troops returned home , women from all of Israel ’ s towns came out to meet King Saul [ d ] with singing and dancing , with tambourines , rejoicing , and musical instruments .
CEB	1%20Samuel	18	7	The women sang in celebration : “ Saul has killed his thousands , but David has killed his tens of thousands ! ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	18	8	Saul burned with anger . This song annoyed him . “ They ’ ve credited David with tens of thousands , ” he said , “ but only credit me with thousands . What ’ s next for him—the kingdom itself ? ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	18	9	So Saul kept a close eye on David from that point on .
CEB	1%20Samuel	18	10	The next day an evil spirit from God came over Saul , [ e ] and he acted like he was in a prophetic frenzy in his house . So David played the lyre as he usually did . Saul had a spear in his hand ,
CEB	1%20Samuel	18	11	and he threw it , thinking , I ’ ll pin David to the wall . But David escaped from him two different times .
CEB	1%20Samuel	18	12	Saul was afraid of David because the Lord was with David but no longer with Saul .
CEB	1%20Samuel	18	13	So Saul removed David from his service , placing him in command of a unit of one thousand men . David led the men out to war and back .
CEB	1%20Samuel	18	14	David was successful in everything he did because the Lord was with him .
CEB	1%20Samuel	18	15	Saul saw that he was very successful , and he was afraid of him .
CEB	1%20Samuel	18	16	Everyone in Israel and Judah loved David because he led them out in war and back again .
CEB	1%20Samuel	18	17	Saul said to David , “ Look , here is my oldest daughter Merab . I will give her to you in marriage on this condition : you must be my warrior and fight the Lord ’ s battles. ” I won ’ t raise my hand against him , Saul thought ; let the Philistines do that !
CEB	1%20Samuel	18	19	And so when the time came for Saul ’ s daughter Merab to be married to David , she was given to Adriel from Meholah instead .
CEB	1%20Samuel	18	20	Now Saul ’ s younger daughter Michal loved David . When this was reported to Saul , he was happy about it .
CEB	1%20Samuel	18	21	I ’ ll give her to him , Saul thought ; she ’ ll cause him problems , and the Philistines will be against him . So Saul said to David a second time , “ Become my son-in-law now. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	18	22	Saul instructed his servants , “ Tell David in private : ‘ Look , the king likes you , and all his servants love you . You should become the king ’ s son-in-law. ’ ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	18	23	Saul ’ s servants whispered these things in David ’ s ear . But David said , “ Do you think it ’ s a simple matter to become the king ’ s son-in-law ? I don ’ t ! I ’ m poor and insignificant. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	18	24	Saul ’ s servants reported what David said ,
CEB	1%20Samuel	18	25	and Saul replied , “ Tell David this : ‘ The king doesn ’ t want any bridal gift , just a hundred Philistine foreskins as vengeance on the king ’ s enemies. ’ ” ( Saul was hoping that David would die at the hands of the Philistines . )
CEB	1%20Samuel	18	26	When the servants reported this to David , he was happy to become the king ’ s son-in-law . Even before the allotted time had expired , [ f ]
CEB	1%20Samuel	18	27	David got up and went with his soldiers and killed one hundred Philistines . [ g ] David brought their foreskins and counted them out for the king so he could become the king ’ s son-in-law . Then Saul gave his daughter Michal to him in marriage .
CEB	1%20Samuel	18	28	When Saul knew for certain that the Lord was with David and that his daughter Michal loved him ,
CEB	1%20Samuel	18	29	then Saul was even more afraid of David . Saul was David ’ s enemy for the rest of his life . [ h ]
CEB	1%20Samuel	18	30	And whenever the Philistine commanders came out for battle , David would have more success than the rest of Saul ’ s officers , so his fame spread widely . Footnotes -
CEB	1%20Samuel	19	1	Samuel 19:22 LXX ; MT the large well at Secu
CEB	1%20Samuel	19	19	When Saul was told that David was in the camps at Ramah ,
CEB	1%20Samuel	19	2	So Jonathan warned David , “ My father Saul is trying to kill you . Be on guard tomorrow morning . Stay somewhere safe and hide .
CEB	1%20Samuel	19	3	I ’ ll go out and stand by my father in the field where you ’ ll be . I ’ ll talk to my father about you , and I ’ ll tell you whatever I find out. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	19	4	So Jonathan spoke highly about David to his father Saul , telling him , “ The king shouldn ’ t do anything wrong to his servant David , because he hasn ’ t wronged you . In fact , his actions have helped you greatly .
CEB	1%20Samuel	19	5	He risked his own life when he killed that Philistine , and the Lord won a great victory for all Israel . You saw it and were happy about it . Why then would you do something wrong to an innocent person by killing David for no reason ? ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	19	6	Saul listened to Jonathan and then swore , “ As surely as the Lord lives , David won ’ t be executed. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	19	7	So Jonathan summoned David and told him everything they had talked about . Then Jonathan brought David back to Saul , and David served Saul as he had previously .
CEB	1%20Samuel	19	8	War broke out again . When David went out to fight the Philistines , he struck them with such force that they ran from him .
CEB	1%20Samuel	19	9	Then an evil spirit from the Lord came over Saul . [ a ] He was sitting in his house with his spear in hand while David was playing music .
CEB	1%20Samuel	19	10	Saul tried to pin David to the wall with his spear , but David escaped Saul . Saul drove the spear into the wall , but David fled and got away safely . That night
CEB	1%20Samuel	19	11	Saul sent messengers to David ’ s house to keep watch on it and kill him in the morning . David ’ s wife Michal warned him , “ If you don ’ t escape with your life tonight , you are a dead man tomorrow. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	19	12	So Michal lowered David through a window . He took off and ran , and he got away .
CEB	1%20Samuel	19	13	Then Michal took the household ’ s divine image and laid it in the bed , putting some goat ’ s hair on its head and covering it with clothes .
CEB	1%20Samuel	19	14	Saul sent messengers to arrest David , but she said , “ He ’ s sick. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	19	15	Saul sent the messengers back to check on David for themselves . “ Bring him to me on his bed , ” he ordered , “ so he can be executed. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	19	16	When the messengers arrived , they found the idol in the bed with the goat ’ s hair on its head .
CEB	1%20Samuel	19	17	Saul said to Michal , “ Why could you betray me like this , letting my enemy go so that now he has escaped ? ” Michal said to Saul , “ David told me , ‘ Help me get away or I ’ ll kill you ! ’ ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	19	18	So David fled and escaped . When he reached Samuel at Ramah , he reported to him everything Saul had done to him . Then he and Samuel went to stay in the camps . [ b ]
CEB	1%20Samuel	19	20	he sent messengers to arrest David . They saw a group of prophets in a prophetic frenzy , with Samuel standing there as their leader . God ’ s spirit came over Saul ’ s messengers , and they also fell into a prophetic frenzy .
CEB	1%20Samuel	19	21	This was reported to Saul , and he sent different messengers , but they also fell into a prophetic frenzy . So Saul sent a third group of messengers , and they did the very same thing .
CEB	1%20Samuel	19	22	At that point , Saul went to Ramah himself . He came to the well at the threshing floor that was on the bare hill there [ c ] and asked , “ Where are Samuel and David ? ” “ In the camps at Ramah , ” he was told .
CEB	1%20Samuel	19	23	So Saul went to the camps at Ramah , and God ’ s spirit came over him too . So as he traveled , he was in a prophetic frenzy until he reached the camps at Ramah .
CEB	1%20Samuel	19	24	He even took off all his clothes and fell into a prophetic frenzy in front of Samuel . He lay naked that whole day and night . That ’ s why people say , “ Is Saul also one of the prophets ? ” Footnotes -

CEB	1%20Samuel	20	20	On the third day I will shoot an arrow to the side of the mound as if aiming at a target . [ h ]
CEB	1%20Samuel	20	2	Jonathan said to him , “ No ! You are not going to die ! Listen : My father doesn ’ t do anything big or small without telling me first . Why would my father hide this from me ? It isn ’ t true ! ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	20	3	But David solemnly promised in response , “ Your father knows full well that you like me . He probably said , ‘ Jonathan must not learn about this or he ’ ll be upset. ’ [ a ] But I promise you—on the Lord ’ s life and yours ! —that I am this close to death ! ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	20	4	“ What do you want me to do ? ” Jonathan said to David . “ I ’ ll do it. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	20	5	“ Okay , listen , ” David answered Jonathan . “ Tomorrow is the new moon , and I ’ m supposed to sit with the king at the feast . Instead , let me go and I ’ ll hide in the field until nighttime . [ b ]
CEB	1%20Samuel	20	6	If your father takes note of my absence , tell him , ‘ David begged my permission to run down to his hometown Bethlehem , because there is an annual sacrifice there for his whole family. ’
CEB	1%20Samuel	20	7	If Saul says ‘ Fine , ’ then I , your servant , am safe . But if he loses his temper , then you ’ ll know for certain that he intends to harm me .
CEB	1%20Samuel	20	8	So be loyal to your servant , because you ’ ve brought your servant into a sacred covenant [ c ] with you . If I ’ m guilty , then kill me yourself ; just don ’ t take me back to your father. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	20	9	“ Enough ! ” Jonathan replied . “ If I can determine for certain that my father intends to harm you , of course I ’ ll tell you ! ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	20	10	“ Who will tell me if your father responds harshly ? ” David asked Jonathan .
CEB	1%20Samuel	20	11	“ Come on , ” Jonathan said to David . “ Let ’ s go into the field. ” So both of them went out into the field .
CEB	1%20Samuel	20	12	Then Jonathan told David , “ I pledge by the Lord God of Israel that I will question my father by this time tomorrow or on the third day . If he seems favorable toward David , I will definitely send word and make sure you know .
CEB	1%20Samuel	20	13	But if my father intends to harm you , then may the Lord deal harshly with me , Jonathan , and worse still if I don ’ t tell you right away so that you can escape safely . May the Lord be with you as he once was with my father .
CEB	1%20Samuel	20	14	If I remain alive , be loyal to me . [ d ] But if I die ,
CEB	1%20Samuel	20	15	don ’ t ever stop being loyal to my household . Once the Lord has eliminated all of David ’ s enemies from the earth ,
CEB	1%20Samuel	20	16	if Jonathan ’ s name is also eliminated , then the Lord will seek retribution from David ! ” [ e ]
CEB	1%20Samuel	20	17	So Jonathan again made a pledge to David [ f ] because he loved David as much as himself .
CEB	1%20Samuel	20	18	“ Tomorrow is the festival of the new moon , ” Jonathan told David . “ You will be missed because your seat will be empty .
CEB	1%20Samuel	20	19	The day after tomorrow , go all the way to the spot where you hid on the day of the incident , and stay close to that mound . [ g ]
CEB	1%20Samuel	20	21	Then I ’ ll send the servant boy , saying , ‘ Go retrieve the arrow. ’ If I yell to the boy , ‘ Hey ! The arrow is on this side of you . Get it ! ’ then you can come out because it will be safe for you . There won ’ t be any trouble—I make a pledge on the Lord ’ s life .
CEB	1%20Samuel	20	22	But if I yell to the young man , ‘ Hey ! The arrow is past you , ’ then run for it , because the Lord has sent you away .
CEB	1%20Samuel	20	23	Either way , the Lord is witness [ i ] between us forever regarding the promise we made to each other. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	20	24	So David hid himself in the field . When the new moon came , the king sat at the feast to eat .
CEB	1%20Samuel	20	25	He took his customary seat by the wall . Jonathan sat opposite him [ j ] while Abner sat beside Saul . David ’ s seat was empty .
CEB	1%20Samuel	20	26	Saul didn ’ t say anything that day because he thought , Perhaps David became unclean somehow . That must be it .
CEB	1%20Samuel	20	27	But on the next day , the second of the new moon , David ’ s seat was still empty . Saul said to his son Jonathan , “ Why hasn ’ t Jesse ’ s son come to the table , [ k ] either yesterday or today ? ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	20	28	Jonathan answered Saul , “ David begged my permission to go to Bethlehem .
CEB	1%20Samuel	20	29	He said , ‘ Please let me go because we have a family sacrifice there in town , and my brother has ordered me to be present . Please do me a favor and let me slip away so I can see my family. ’ That ’ s why David hasn ’ t been at the king ’ s table. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	20	30	At that , Saul got angry at Jonathan . “ You son of a stubborn , rebellious woman ! ” he said . “ Do you think I don ’ t know how you ’ ve allied yourself with Jesse ’ s son ? Shame on you and on the mother who birthed you ! [ l ]
CEB	1%20Samuel	20	31	As long as Jesse ’ s son lives on this earth , neither you nor your dynasty will be secure . Now have him brought to me because he ’ s a dead man ! ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	20	32	But Jonathan answered his father Saul , “ Why should David be executed ? What has he done ? ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	20	33	At that , Saul threw [ m ] his spear at Jonathan to strike him , and Jonathan realized that his father intended to kill David .
CEB	1%20Samuel	20	34	Jonathan got up from the table in a rage . He didn ’ t eat anything on the second day of the new moon because he was worried about David and because his father had humiliated him .
CEB	1%20Samuel	20	35	In the morning , Jonathan went out to the field for the meeting with David , and a young servant boy went with him .
CEB	1%20Samuel	20	36	,
CEB	1%20Samuel	20	37	When the boy got to the spot where Jonathan shot the arrow , Jonathan yelled to him , “ Isn ’ t the arrow past you ? ”

CEB	1%20Samuel	20	39	The boy had no idea what had happened ; only Jonathan and David knew .
CEB	1%20Samuel	20	40	Jonathan handed his weapons to the boy and told him , “ Get going . Take these back to town. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	20	41	As soon as the boy was gone , David came out from behind the mound [ n ] and fell down , face on the ground , bowing low three times . The friends kissed each other , and cried with each other , but David cried hardest .
CEB	1%20Samuel	20	42	[ o ] Then Jonathan said to David , “ Go in peace because the two of us made a solemn pledge in the Lord ’ s name when we said , ‘ The Lord is witness between us and between our descendants forever. ’ ” Then David got up and left , but Jonathan went back to town . Footnotes -

CEB	1%20Samuel	21	21	[ a ] David came to Nob where Ahimelech was priest . Ahimelech was shaking in fear when he met David . “ Why are you alone ? Why is no one with you ? ” he asked .
CEB	1%20Samuel	21	2	David answered Ahimelech the priest , “ The king has given me orders , but he instructed me , ‘ Don ’ t let anyone know anything about the mission I ’ m sending you on or about your orders. ’ As for my troops , I told them to meet me at an undisclosed location .
CEB	1%20Samuel	21	3	Now what do you have here with you ? Give me five loaves of bread or whatever you can find. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	21	4	“ I don ’ t have any regular bread on hand , ” the priest answered David , “ just holy bread—but only if your troops have abstained from sexual activity. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	21	5	“ Definitely , ” David answered the priest . “ Whenever I go out to war , women are off-limits ; that ’ s our standard operating procedure . Even on regular missions , the men ’ s gear is [ b ] kept holy . That ’ s even more true today , with the mission holy along with the gear. ” [ c ]
CEB	1%20Samuel	21	6	So the priest gave David holy bread , because there was no other bread except the bread of the presence , which is removed from the Lord ’ s presence and replaced by warm bread as soon as it is taken away .
CEB	1%20Samuel	21	7	Now one of Saul ’ s servants was there that day , detained in the Lord ’ s presence . His name was Doeg . He was an Edomite and Saul ’ s head shepherd .
CEB	1%20Samuel	21	8	David asked Ahimelech , “ Do you have a spear or sword on hand ? I didn ’ t bring my sword or gear with me because the king ’ s mission was urgent. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	21	9	The priest said , “ The sword of Goliath , the Philistine you killed in the Elah Valley , is here wrapped in a cloth behind a priestly vest . [ d ] If you want it , take it , because there are no other swords here. ” David said , “ No sword is as good as that one ! Give it to me ! ” David pretends to be crazy
CEB	1%20Samuel	21	10	So David got up and continued running from Saul . He went to Achish , Gath ’ s king .
CEB	1%20Samuel	21	11	Achish ’ s servants said to him , “ Isn ’ t that David , king of the land ? He ’ s the one people sing about in their dances , ‘ Saul has killed his thousands , but David has killed his tens of thousands ! ’ ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	21	12	David took these words very seriously and became very frightened of Achish , Gath ’ s king .
CEB	1%20Samuel	21	13	So he changed the way he acted with them , pretending to be insane while he was with them . [ e ] He scratched marks on the doors of the city gates [ f ] and let spit run down his chin .
CEB	1%20Samuel	21	14	“ Can ’ t you see he ’ s crazy ? ” Achish asked his servants . “ Why bring him to me ?

CEB	1%20Samuel	22	3	From there David went to Mizpeh in Moab . He said to the Moabite king , “ Please let my father and mother stay with you until I know what God will do to me. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	22	4	So David left his parents with the Moabite king , and they stayed with him the whole time David was in the fortress .
CEB	1%20Samuel	22	5	Then the prophet Gad told David , “ Don ’ t stay in the fortress any longer . Leave now and go to the land of Judah. ” So David left and went to Hereth forest . Saul kills the priests of Nob

CEB	1%20Samuel	22	8	Is that why all of you have conspired against me ? No one informed me when my son made a covenant with Jesse ’ s son ! Not one of you is concerned about me or informs me when my own son sets my servant against me in an ambush—but that ’ s what has happened today ! ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	22	9	Doeg the Edomite , who was standing with Saul ’ s servants , responded , “ I saw Jesse ’ s son go to Ahimelech , Ahitub ’ s son , at Nob .

CEB	1%20Samuel	22	11	The king then sent for the priest Ahimelech , Ahitub ’ s son , and all his extended family , who were the priests at Nob . All of them came to the king .
CEB	1%20Samuel	22	12	“ Listen here , son of Ahitub , ” Saul said . “ Yes sir , ” he replied .
CEB	1%20Samuel	22	13	Saul said to him , “ Why have you conspired against me—you with Jesse ’ s son—giving him food and a sword and questioning God for him so that he is now against me , waiting in ambush , which is what has happened today ? ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	22	14	Ahimelech answered the king , “ Out of all your servants , who is as trustworthy as David ? He is the king ’ s son-in-law , does whatever you ask , and is well respected in your house .
CEB	1%20Samuel	22	15	Was that the first time I questioned God for him ? Of course not ! But please , the king shouldn ’ t accuse me , his servant , or anyone in my father ’ s household of any wrongdoing , because your servant knew nothing whatsoever about this matter. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	22	16	But the king said , “ You will be executed , Ahimelech—you and all of your father ’ s household ! ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	22	17	The king ordered the guards waiting on him : “ Go ahead and kill the Lord ’ s priests because they ’ ve joined up with David too . They knew he was on the run but didn ’ t inform me. ” But the king ’ s servants were unwilling to lift a hand to attack the Lord ’ s priests .
CEB	1%20Samuel	22	18	The king then ordered Doeg , “ Doeg ! You go attack the priests. ” So Doeg the Edomite went and attacked the priests , killing eighty-five men who wore the linen priestly vest [ b ] that day .
CEB	1%20Samuel	22	19	He put the whole priestly city of Nob to the sword : men and women , children and infants , even oxen , donkeys , and sheep .
CEB	1%20Samuel	22	20	But one of the sons of Ahimelech , Ahitub ’ s son , escaped . His name was Abiathar , and he fled to David .
CEB	1%20Samuel	22	21	Abiathar reported to David that Saul had slaughtered the Lord ’ s priests .
CEB	1%20Samuel	22	23	Stay with me , and don ’ t be afraid . The one who seeks my life now seeks yours too . But you ’ ll be safe with me. ” Footnotes -

CEB	1%20Samuel	23	23	Find out every hiding place he uses there and come back to me when you know for certain . I will then go with you . If David is in the area , I will hunt him down among any of Judah ’ s clans ! ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	23	2	David asked the Lord , “ Should I go and fight these Philistines ? ” “ Go ! ” the Lord answered . “ Fight the Philistines and save Keilah ! ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	23	3	But David ’ s men said to him , “ Look how frightened we are here in Judah . It ’ ll be worse if we go to Keilah against Philistine forces ! ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	23	4	So David asked the Lord again , and the Lord reaffirmed , “ Yes , go down to Keilah , because I will hand the Philistines over to you. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	23	5	Then David and his soldiers went to Keilah and fought the Philistines , driving off their cattle and defeating them decisively . And that ’ s how David saved the residents of Keilah .
CEB	1%20Samuel	23	6	Now after Abiathar , Ahimelech ’ s son , fled to David , he had accompanied David to Keilah , [ a ] bringing a priestly vest [ b ] with him .
CEB	1%20Samuel	23	7	When Saul was told that David had gone to Keilah , he said , “ God has handed him over [ c ] to me now because he has trapped himself by entering a town with gates and bars ! ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	23	8	So Saul called up all his troops for war , to go down to Keilah and attack David and his soldiers .
CEB	1%20Samuel	23	9	When David learned that Saul was planning to harm him , he told the priest Abiathar , “ Bring the priestly vest now. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	23	10	Then David said , “ Lord God of Israel , I , your servant , have heard that Saul plans on coming to Keilah and will destroy the town because of me .
CEB	1%20Samuel	23	11	Lord God of Israel , will Saul come down as your servant has heard ? [ d ] Please tell your servant. ” “ Yes , he will come down , ” the Lord answered .
CEB	1%20Samuel	23	12	Next David asked , “ Will the citizens of Keilah hand me and my soldiers over to Saul ? ” “ Yes , they will hand you over , ” the Lord replied .
CEB	1%20Samuel	23	13	So David and his troops—approximately six hundred men—got up and left Keilah . They kept moving , going from one place to the next . When Saul was told that David had escaped from Keilah , he didn ’ t go there .
CEB	1%20Samuel	23	14	David lived in the fortresses in the wilderness and in the hills of the Ziph wilderness . Saul searched for him constantly , but God did not hand David over to Saul .
CEB	1%20Samuel	23	15	While David was at Horesh in the Ziph wilderness he learned that Saul was looking to kill him .
CEB	1%20Samuel	23	16	Saul ’ s son Jonathan came to David at Horesh and encouraged him with God .
CEB	1%20Samuel	23	17	Jonathan said to him , “ Don ’ t be afraid ! My father Saul ’ s hand won ’ t touch you . You will be king over Israel , and I will be your second in command . Even my father Saul knows this. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	23	18	Then the two of them made a covenant before the Lord . David stayed at Horesh , but Jonathan went back home .
CEB	1%20Samuel	23	19	Some Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah . “ David is hiding among us in the fortresses at Horesh on the hill of Hachilah , south of Jeshimon , ” they said .
CEB	1%20Samuel	23	20	“ So whenever you want to come down , Your Majesty , do it ! Leave it to us to hand him over to the king. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	23	21	“ The Lord bless you because you have shown this kindness to me ! ” Saul said .
CEB	1%20Samuel	23	22	“ Go now and get everything ready . Find out everything you can : where he stays , where he goes , who has seen him . I am told he is very shrewd .
CEB	1%20Samuel	23	24	So they got up and left for Ziph ahead of Saul . Meanwhile , David and his soldiers were in the Maon wilderness in the desert plain south of Jeshimon .
CEB	1%20Samuel	23	25	When Saul and his troops went looking for him , David was told about it , so he went down to a certain rock there and stayed in the Maon wilderness . When Saul heard that , he went into the Maon wilderness after David .
CEB	1%20Samuel	23	26	Saul was going around one side of a hill there while David and his soldiers were going around the other . David was hurrying to get away from Saul while Saul and his troops were trying to surround David and his soldiers in order to capture them .
CEB	1%20Samuel	23	27	But a messenger suddenly came to Saul . “ Come quick ! ” he said . “ The Philistines have invaded the land ! ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	23	28	So Saul broke off his pursuit of David and went to fight the Philistines . That ’ s why that place is called Escape Rock .
CEB	1%20Samuel	23	29	[ e ] Then David went from there and lived at the En-gedi fortresses . Footnotes -
CEB	1%20Samuel	24	1	Samuel 24:10 LXX ; MT Some said
CEB	1%20Samuel	24	24	[ a ] Even as Saul returned from pursuing the Philistines , he was informed that David was in the En-gedi wilderness .
CEB	1%20Samuel	24	2	So Saul took three thousand men selected from all Israel and went to look for David and his soldiers near the rocks of the wild goats .
CEB	1%20Samuel	24	3	He came to the sheep pens beside the road where there was a cave . Saul went into the cave to use the restroom . [ b ] Meanwhile , David and his soldiers were sitting in the very back of the cave .
CEB	1%20Samuel	24	4	David ’ s soldiers said to him , “ This is the day the Lord spoke of when he promised you , ‘ I will hand your enemy over to you , and you can do to him whatever you think best. ’ ” So David snuck up and cut off a corner of Saul ’ s robe .
CEB	1%20Samuel	24	5	But immediately David felt horrible that he had cut off a corner of Saul ’ s robe . [ c ]
CEB	1%20Samuel	24	6	“ The Lord forbid , ” he told his men , “ that I should do something like that to my master , the Lord ’ s anointed , or lift my hand against him , because he ’ s the Lord ’ s anointed ! ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	24	7	So David held his soldiers in check by what he said , [ d ] and he wouldn ’ t allow them to attack Saul . Saul then left the cave and went on his way .
CEB	1%20Samuel	24	8	Then David also went out of the cave and yelled after Saul , “ My master the king ! ” Saul looked back , and David bowed low out of respect , nose to the ground .
CEB	1%20Samuel	24	9	David said to Saul , “ Why do you listen when people say , ‘ David wants to ruin you ’ ?
CEB	1%20Samuel	24	10	Look ! Today your own eyes have seen that the Lord handed you over to me in the cave . But I refused [ e ] to kill you . I spared you , saying , ‘ I won ’ t lift a hand against my master because he is the Lord ’ s anointed. ’
CEB	1%20Samuel	24	11	Look here , my protector ! See the corner of your robe in my hand ? I cut off the corner of your robe but didn ’ t kill you . So know now that I am not guilty of wrongdoing or rebellion . I haven ’ t wronged you , but you are hunting me down , trying to kill me .
CEB	1%20Samuel	24	12	May the Lord judge between me and you ! May the Lord take vengeance on you for me , but I won ’ t lift a hand against you .
CEB	1%20Samuel	24	13	As the old proverb goes , ‘ Evil deeds come from evildoers ! ’ but I won ’ t lift a hand against you .
CEB	1%20Samuel	24	14	So who is Israel ’ s king coming after ? Who are you chasing ? A dead dog ? A single flea ?
CEB	1%20Samuel	24	15	May the Lord be the judge and decide between you and me . May he see what has happened , argue my case , and vindicate me against you ! ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	24	16	As soon as David finished saying all this to Saul , Saul said , “ David , my son , is that your voice ? ” Then he broke down in tears ,
CEB	1%20Samuel	24	17	telling David , “ You are more righteous than I am because you have treated me generously , but I have treated you terribly .
CEB	1%20Samuel	24	18	Today you ’ ve told me the good you have done for me—how the Lord handed me over to you , but how you didn ’ t kill me .
CEB	1%20Samuel	24	19	When someone finds an enemy , do they send the enemy away in peace ? May the Lord repay you with good for what you have done for me today .
CEB	1%20Samuel	24	20	Now even I know that you will definitely become king , and Israel ’ s kingdom will flourish in your hands .
CEB	1%20Samuel	24	21	Because of that , make a solemn pledge to me by the Lord that you won ’ t kill off my descendants after I ’ m gone and that you won ’ t destroy my name from my family lineage. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	24	22	David made a solemn pledge to Saul . Then Saul went back home , but David and his soldiers went up to the fortress . Footnotes -
CEB	1%20Samuel	25	1	Samuel 25:29 Or bundle of the living ; Heb uncertain ; perhaps a tied-up scroll ( cf Exod 32:32-33 ; Ps 69:28 ; Isa 8:16 )
CEB	1%20Samuel	25	25	Please , my master , pay no attention to this despicable man Nabal . He ’ s exactly what his name says he is ! His name means fool , [ g ] and he is foolish ! [ h ] But I myself , your servant , didn ’ t see the young men that you , my master , sent .
CEB	1%20Samuel	25	2	There was a man in Maon who did business in Carmel . He was a very important man and owned three thousand sheep and one thousand goats . At that time , he was shearing his sheep in Carmel .
CEB	1%20Samuel	25	3	The man ’ s name was Nabal , and his wife ’ s name was Abigail . She was an intelligent and attractive woman , but her husband was a hard man who did evil things . He was a Calebite .
CEB	1%20Samuel	25	4	While in the wilderness , David heard that Nabal was shearing his sheep .
CEB	1%20Samuel	25	5	So David sent ten servants , telling them , “ Go up to Carmel . When you get to Nabal , greet him for me .
CEB	1%20Samuel	25	6	Say this to him : ‘ Peace to you , [ b ] your household , and all that is yours !
CEB	1%20Samuel	25	7	I ’ ve heard that you are now shearing sheep . As you know , your shepherds were with us in the wilderness . [ c ] We didn ’ t mistreat them . Moreover , the whole time they were at Carmel , nothing of theirs went missing .
CEB	1%20Samuel	25	8	Ask your servants ; they will tell you the same . So please receive these young men favorably , because we ’ ve come on a special day . Please give whatever you have on hand to your servants and to your son David. ’ ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	25	9	When David ’ s young men arrived , they said all this to Nabal on David ’ s behalf . Then they waited .
CEB	1%20Samuel	25	10	But Nabal answered David ’ s servants , “ Who is David ? Who is Jesse ’ s son ? There are all sorts of slaves running away from their masters these days .
CEB	1%20Samuel	25	11	Why should I take my bread , my water , and the meat I ’ ve butchered for my shearers and give it to people who came here from who knows where ? ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	25	12	So David ’ s young servants turned around and went back the way they came . When they arrived , they reported every word of this to David .
CEB	1%20Samuel	25	13	Then David said to his soldiers , “ All of you , strap on your swords ! ” So each of them strapped on their swords , and David did the same . Nearly four hundred men went up with David . Two hundred men remained back with the supplies .
CEB	1%20Samuel	25	14	One of Nabal ’ s servants told his wife Abigail , “ David sent messengers from the wilderness to greet our master , but he just yelled at them .
CEB	1%20Samuel	25	15	But the men were very good to us and didn ’ t mistreat us . Nothing of ours went missing the whole time we were out with them in the fields .
CEB	1%20Samuel	25	16	In fact , the whole time we were with them , watching our sheep , they were a protective wall around us both night and day .
CEB	1%20Samuel	25	17	Think about that and see what you can do , because trouble is coming for our master and his whole household . But he ’ s such a despicable person no one can speak to him. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	25	18	Abigail quickly took two hundred loaves of bread , two skins of wine , five sheep ready for cooking , five seahs [ d ] of roasted grain , one hundred raisin cakes , and two hundred fig cakes . She loaded all this on donkeys
CEB	1%20Samuel	25	19	and told her servants , “ Go on ahead of me . I ’ ll be right behind you. ” But she didn ’ t tell her husband Nabal .
CEB	1%20Samuel	25	20	As she was riding her donkey , going down a trail on the hillside , David and his soldiers appeared , descending toward her , and she met up with them .
CEB	1%20Samuel	25	21	David had just been saying , “ What a waste of time—guarding all this man ’ s stuff in the wilderness so that nothing of his went missing ! He has repaid me evil instead of good !
CEB	1%20Samuel	25	22	May God deal harshly with me , David , [ e ] and worse still if I leave alive even one single one who urinates on a wall [ f ] belonging to him come morning ! ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	25	23	When Abigail saw David , she quickly got off her donkey and fell facedown before him , bowing low to the ground .
CEB	1%20Samuel	25	24	She fell at his feet and said , “ Put the blame on me , my master ! But please let me , your servant , speak to you directly . Please listen to what your servant has to say .
CEB	1%20Samuel	25	26	I pledge , my master , as surely as the Lord lives and as you live , that the Lord has held you back from bloodshed and taking vengeance into your own hands ! But now let your enemies and those who seek to harm my master be exactly like Nabal !
CEB	1%20Samuel	25	27	Here is a gift , which your servant has brought to my master . Please let it be given to the young men who follow you , my master .
CEB	1%20Samuel	25	28	Please forgive any offense by your servant . The Lord will definitely make an enduring dynasty for my master because my master fights the Lord ’ s battles , and nothing evil will be found in you throughout your lifetime .
CEB	1%20Samuel	25	29	If someone chases after you and tries to kill you , my master , then your life will be bound up securely in the bundle of life [ i ] by the Lord your God , but he will fling away your enemies ’ lives as from the pouch of a sling .
CEB	1%20Samuel	25	30	When the Lord has done for my master all the good things he has promised you , and has installed you as Israel ’ s leader ,
CEB	1%20Samuel	25	31	don ’ t let this be a blot or burden on my master ’ s conscience , that you shed blood needlessly or that my master took vengeance into his own hands . When the Lord has done good things for my master , please remember your servant. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	25	32	David said to Abigail , “ Bless the Lord God of Israel , who sent you to meet me today !
CEB	1%20Samuel	25	33	And bless you and your good judgment for preventing me from shedding blood and taking vengeance into my own hands today !
CEB	1%20Samuel	25	34	Otherwise , as surely as the Lord God of Israel lives—the one who kept me from hurting you—if you hadn ’ t come quickly and met up with me , there wouldn ’ t be one single one who urinates on a wall left come morning. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	25	35	Then David accepted everything she had brought for him . “ Return home in peace , ” he told her . “ Be assured that I ’ ve heard your request and have agreed to it. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	25	36	When Abigail got back home to Nabal , he was throwing a party fit for a king in his house . Nabal was in a great mood and very drunk , so Abigail didn ’ t tell him anything until daybreak .
CEB	1%20Samuel	25	37	In the morning , when Nabal was sober , his wife told him everything . Nabal ’ s heart failed inside him , and he became like a stone .
CEB	1%20Samuel	25	38	About ten days later , the Lord struck Nabal , and he died .
CEB	1%20Samuel	25	39	When David heard that Nabal was dead , he said , “ Bless the Lord , who has rendered a verdict regarding Nabal ’ s insult to me and who kept me , his servant , from doing something evil ! The Lord has brought Nabal ’ s evil down on his own head. ” Then David sent word to Abigail , saying that he would take her as his wife .
CEB	1%20Samuel	25	40	When David ’ s servants reached Abigail at Carmel , they said to her , “ David has sent us to you so you can become his wife. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	25	41	She bowed low to the ground and said , “ I am your servant , ready to serve and wash the feet of my master ’ s helpers. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	25	42	Then Abigail got up quickly and rode on her donkey , with five of her young women going with her . She followed David ’ s messengers and became his wife .
CEB	1%20Samuel	25	43	David also married Ahinoam from Jezreel , so both of them were his wives .
CEB	1%20Samuel	25	44	But Saul had given his daughter Michal , David ’ s wife , to Palti , Laish ’ s son , from Gallim . Footnotes -

CEB	1%20Samuel	26	26	The Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah . “ David is hiding on Hachilah ’ s hill , which faces Jeshimon , ” they said .
CEB	1%20Samuel	26	2	So Saul got up and went down to the Ziph wilderness to look for David there . He had three thousand handpicked soldiers from Israel with him .
CEB	1%20Samuel	26	3	Saul camped on Hachilah ’ s hill opposite Jeshimon beside the road , but David stayed in the wilderness . When David learned that Saul had come after him into the wilderness ,
CEB	1%20Samuel	26	4	he sent spies and discovered that Saul had definitely arrived .
CEB	1%20Samuel	26	5	So David got up and went to the place where Saul camped , and saw the place where Saul and Abner , Ner ’ s son and Saul ’ s general , were sleeping . Saul was sleeping inside the camp with the troops camped all around him .
CEB	1%20Samuel	26	6	David asked Ahimelech the Hittite and Joab ’ s brother Abishai , Zeruiah ’ s son , “ Who will go down into the camp with me to Saul ? ” “ I ’ ll go down with you , ” Abishai answered .
CEB	1%20Samuel	26	7	So David and Abishai approached the troops at night and found Saul lying there , asleep in the camp , with his spear stuck in the ground by his head . Abner and the army were sleeping all around him .
CEB	1%20Samuel	26	8	Abishai said to David , “ God has handed your enemy over to you today ! Let me pin him to the ground with my spear . One stroke is all I need ! I won ’ t need a second. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	26	9	But David said to Abishai , “ Don ’ t kill him ! No one can lift a hand against the Lord ’ s anointed and go unpunished .
CEB	1%20Samuel	26	10	As surely as the Lord lives , ” David continued , “ it will be the Lord who will strike him down , or his day will come and he will die , or he ’ ll fall in battle and be destroyed .
CEB	1%20Samuel	26	11	The Lord forbid that I lift my hand against the Lord ’ s anointed ! But go ahead and take the spear by Saul ’ s head and the water jug and let ’ s go ! ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	26	12	So David took the spear and the water jug that were by Saul ’ s head , and he and Abishai left . No one saw them , no one knew they were there , and no one woke up . All of them remained asleep because a deep sleep from the Lord had come over them .
CEB	1%20Samuel	26	13	David crossed over to the other side and stood on top of a hill with considerable distance between them .
CEB	1%20Samuel	26	14	Then David shouted to the army and to Abner , Ner ’ s son , “ Abner ! Aren ’ t you going to answer me ? ” “ Who are you to shout to the king ? ” Abner asked .
CEB	1%20Samuel	26	15	David answered Abner , “ You are a man , aren ’ t you ? And you have no equal in Israel , right ? Then why haven ’ t you kept watch over your master the king ? One of the soldiers came to kill your master the king .
CEB	1%20Samuel	26	16	What you ’ ve done is terrible ! As surely as the Lord lives , all of you are dead men because you didn ’ t keep close watch over your master , the Lord ’ s anointed . Have a look around ! Where are the king ’ s spear and the water jug that were by his head ? ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	26	17	Saul recognized David ’ s voice and said , “ David , my son , is that your voice ? ” David said , “ Yes it is , my master the king .
CEB	1%20Samuel	26	18	Why , ” David continued , “ is my master chasing me , his servant ? What have I done and what wrong am I guilty of ?
CEB	1%20Samuel	26	19	My master the king , please listen to what your servant has to say . If it is the Lord who has incited you against me , then let him accept an offering ! But if human beings have done it , then let them be cursed before the Lord because they have now driven me off , keeping me from sharing in the Lord ’ s inheritance . ‘ Go ! ’ they tell me . ‘ Worship other gods ! ’
CEB	1%20Samuel	26	20	Don ’ t let my blood spill on the ground apart from the Lord ’ s presence , because the king of Israel has come out looking for a single flea [ a ] like someone hunting a partridge [ b ] in the mountains. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	26	21	Then Saul said , “ I have sinned ! David , my son , come back ! Because you considered my life precious today , I won ’ t harm you again . I have acted foolishly and have made a huge mistake. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	26	22	“ Here is the king ’ s spear , ” David answered . “ Allow one of your servants to come over and get it .
CEB	1%20Samuel	26	23	Remember : The Lord rewards every person for their righteousness and loyalty , and I wasn ’ t willing to lift a hand against the Lord ’ s anointed , even though the Lord handed you over to me today .
CEB	1%20Samuel	26	24	And just as I considered your life valuable today , may the Lord consider my life valuable , and may he deliver me from all trouble. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	26	25	Then Saul said to David , “ Bless you , David , my son ! You will accomplish much and will certainly succeed. ” Then David went on his way , but Saul went back home . Footnotes -

CEB	1%20Samuel	27	27	David thought , One day I will be destroyed by Saul ’ s power . The best thing for me to do is to escape to Philistine territory . Then Saul will give up looking for me in Israelite territory , and I will escape his power .
CEB	1%20Samuel	27	2	So David set out with his six hundred soldiers and went to Achish , Maoch ’ s son and Gath ’ s king .
CEB	1%20Samuel	27	3	David and his soldiers stayed there at Gath with Achish . Each man had his family with him , and David had his two wives , Ahinoam from Jezreel and Abigail , Nabal ’ s widow from Carmel .
CEB	1%20Samuel	27	4	When Saul was told that David had fled to Gath , he didn ’ t pursue him anymore .
CEB	1%20Samuel	27	5	Then David said to Achish , “ If you approve of me , please give me a place in one of the towns in the country so I can live there . Why should I , your servant , live in the capital city with you ? ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	27	6	So Achish gave the town of Ziklag to David at that time . That ’ s why Ziklag has belonged to the kings of Judah until now .
CEB	1%20Samuel	27	7	David lived in the Philistine countryside for a total of one year and four months .
CEB	1%20Samuel	27	8	David and his soldiers went out on raids against the Geshurites , the Girzites , and the Amalekites . They were the people who lived in the land from Telam [ a ] to Shur all the way to the land of Egypt .
CEB	1%20Samuel	27	9	When David attacked an area , he wouldn ’ t leave anyone alive , man or woman . He would take the sheep , the cattle , the donkeys , the camels , and the clothes and would then go back to Achish .
CEB	1%20Samuel	27	10	When Achish asked , “ Where did you raid today ? ” [ b ] David would say , “ The southern plain of Judah , ” or “ The southern plain of the Jerahmeelites , ” or “ The southern plain of the Kenites. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	27	11	David never spared a man or woman so they could be brought back alive to Gath . “ Otherwise , ” he said , “ they might talk about us , and say , ‘ David did this or that. ’ ” So this was David ’ s practice during the entire time he lived in the Philistine countryside .
CEB	1%20Samuel	27	12	Achish trusted David , thinking , David has alienated himself so badly from his own people in Israel that he ’ ll serve me forever . Footnotes -

CEB	1%20Samuel	28	2	“ Excellent , ” David answered Achish . “ Now you ’ ll see for yourself what your servant can do. ” “ Excellent , ” Achish replied . “ I will make you my permanent bodyguard. ” Saul and the woman of En-dor
CEB	1%20Samuel	28	3	Now Samuel had died , and all Israel mourned him and buried him in Ramah , his hometown . And Saul had banned all mediums and diviners from the land .

CEB	1%20Samuel	28	5	When Saul saw the Philistine army , he was so afraid that his heart beat wildly .
CEB	1%20Samuel	28	6	When Saul questioned the Lord , the Lord didn ’ t answer him—not by dreams , not by the Urim , and not by the prophets .
CEB	1%20Samuel	28	7	So Saul said to his servants , “ Find me a woman who communicates with ghosts ! I ’ ll then go to her and ask by using her techniques. ” [ a ] “ There is such a medium in En-dor , ” his servants replied .
CEB	1%20Samuel	28	8	So Saul disguised himself , dressing in different clothes . Then he and two men set out , going to the woman at nighttime . “ Please call up a ghost for me ! Bring me the one I specify , ” Saul said .
CEB	1%20Samuel	28	9	“ Listen , ” the woman said to him , “ you know what Saul has done , how he has banned all mediums and diviners from the land . What are you doing ? Trying to get me killed ? ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	28	10	But Saul promised to her by the Lord , “ As surely as the Lord lives , you won ’ t get into trouble for this. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	28	11	So the woman said , “ Who do you want me to bring up for you ? ” “ Bring up Samuel , ” he said .
CEB	1%20Samuel	28	12	When the woman saw Samuel , she screamed at Saul , “ Why have you tricked me ? You are Saul ! ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	28	13	“ Don ’ t be afraid ! ” the king said to her . “ What do you see ? ” The woman said to Saul , “ I see a god [ b ] coming up from the ground. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	28	14	“ What does he look like ? ” Saul asked her . “ An old man is coming up , ” she said . “ He ’ s wrapped in a robe. ” Then Saul knew that it was Samuel , and he bowed low out of respect , nose to the ground .
CEB	1%20Samuel	28	15	“ Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up ? ” Samuel asked Saul . “ I ’ m in deep trouble ! ” Saul replied . “ The Philistines are at war with me , and God has turned away from me and no longer answers me by prophets or by dreams . So I have called on you to tell me what I should do. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	28	16	“ Why do you ask me , ” Samuel said , “ since the Lord has turned away from you and has become your enemy ? [ c ]
CEB	1%20Samuel	28	17	The Lord has done to you [ d ] exactly what he spoke through me : The Lord has ripped the kingdom out of your hands and has given it to your friend David .
CEB	1%20Samuel	28	18	The Lord has done this very thing to you today because you didn ’ t listen to the Lord ’ s voice and didn ’ t carry out his fierce anger against the Amalekites .
CEB	1%20Samuel	28	19	The Lord will now hand over both you and Israel to the Philistines . And come tomorrow , you and your sons will be with me ! [ e ] The Lord will hand Israel ’ s army over to the Philistines. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	28	20	Saul immediately fell full length on the ground , utterly terrified at what Samuel had said . He was weak because he hadn ’ t eaten anything all day or night .
CEB	1%20Samuel	28	21	The woman approached Saul , and after seeing how scared he was , she said , “ Listen , your servant has obeyed you . I risked my life and did what you told me to do .
CEB	1%20Samuel	28	22	Now it ’ s your turn to listen to me , your servant . Let me give you a bit of food . Eat it , then you ’ ll have the strength to go on your way. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	28	23	But Saul refused . “ I can ’ t eat ! ” he said . But his servants and the woman urged him to do so , and so he did . He got up off the ground and sat on a couch .
CEB	1%20Samuel	28	24	The woman had a fattened calf in the house , and she quickly butchered it . [ f ] She took flour , kneaded it , and baked unleavened bread .
CEB	1%20Samuel	28	25	She served this to Saul and his servants , and they ate . They got up and left that very night . Footnotes -

CEB	1%20Samuel	29	29	The Philistines assembled all their forces at Aphek , and the Israelites camped by the spring in Jezreel .
CEB	1%20Samuel	29	2	As the Philistine rulers went out marching in units of hundreds and thousands , David and his soldiers were in the rear with Achish .
CEB	1%20Samuel	29	3	“ Who are these Hebrews ? ” the Philistine commanders asked . “ That ’ s David , ” Achish told them , “ the servant of Israel ’ s King Saul . He ’ s been with me a year or so now . I haven ’ t found anything wrong with him from the day he defected until now. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	29	4	But the Philistine commanders were angry with Achish . “ Send the man home ! ” they told Achish . “ He can go back to the place you gave him , but he won ’ t go with us into battle . Couldn ’ t he turn against us in the middle of the fight ? How better to please his former master than by taking the heads of our soldiers ?
CEB	1%20Samuel	29	5	After all , this is the same David people sing about in their dances , ‘ Saul has killed his thousands , but David has killed his tens of thousands ! ’ ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	29	6	So Achish summoned David and told him , “ As surely as the Lord lives , you are an upstanding individual . I would very much like you to serve with me in the army because I haven ’ t found anything wrong with you from the day you came to me until now . But the rulers don ’ t approve of you .
CEB	1%20Samuel	29	7	So go back home now , and go in peace . Don ’ t do anything to upset the Philistine rulers. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	29	8	“ But what have I done ? ” David asked Achish . “ What wrong have you found in me , your servant , from the day I came to you until now ? Why shouldn ’ t I go and fight the enemies of my master the king ? ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	29	9	“ I agree , ” Achish answered David . “ I think you ’ re as good as one of God ’ s own messengers . Despite that , the Philistine commanders have ordered , ‘ He can ’ t go into battle with us. ’
CEB	1%20Samuel	29	10	So get up early in the morning , both you and your master ’ s servants who came with you , and return to the place I gave you . Don ’ t worry about this negative report , because you ’ ve done well before me . [ a ] Now get up early in the morning and leave as soon as it is light. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	29	11	So David and his soldiers got up early in the morning to go back to Philistine territory , but the Philistines went up to Jezreel . Footnotes -

CEB	1%20Samuel	30	4	David and the troops with him broke into tears and cried until they could cry no more .
CEB	1%20Samuel	30	5	David ’ s two wives had been captured as well : Ahinoam from Jezreel and Abigail , Nabal ’ s widow from Carmel .
CEB	1%20Samuel	30	6	David was in deep trouble because the troops were talking about stoning him . Each of the soldiers was deeply distressed about their sons and daughters . But David found strength in the Lord his God .
CEB	1%20Samuel	30	7	David said to the priest Abiathar , Ahimelech ’ s son , “ Bring the priestly vest [ b ] to me. ” So Abiathar brought it to David .
CEB	1%20Samuel	30	8	Then David asked the Lord , “ Should I go after this raiding party ? Will I catch them ? ” “ Yes , go after them ! ” God answered . “ You will definitely catch them and will succeed in the rescue ! ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	30	9	So David set off with six hundred men . They came to the Besor ravine , where some stayed behind .
CEB	1%20Samuel	30	10	David and four hundred men continued the pursuit , while two hundred men stayed there , too exhausted to cross the Besor ravine .
CEB	1%20Samuel	30	11	They found an Egyptian in the countryside and brought him to David . They gave him bread , and he ate , and they gave him water to drink .
CEB	1%20Samuel	30	12	They also gave him a piece of fig cake and two raisin cakes . He ate and regained his strength because he hadn ’ t eaten any food or drunk any water for three days and nights .
CEB	1%20Samuel	30	13	Then David asked him , “ Whose slave are you ? Where do you come from ? ” “ I ’ m an Egyptian servant boy , ” he said , “ and the slave of an Amalekite . My master abandoned me when I got sick three days ago .
CEB	1%20Samuel	30	14	We had raided the arid southern plain belonging to the Cherethites , the territory belonging to Judah , and the southern plain of Caleb . We also burned Ziklag down. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	30	15	“ Can you guide me to this raiding party ? ” David asked him . “ Make a pledge to me by God that you won ’ t kill me or hand me over to my master , ” the boy said , “ and I will guide you to the raiding party. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	30	16	So the boy led David to them , and he found them scattered all over the countryside , eating , drinking , and celebrating over the large amount of plunder they had taken from Philistine and Judean territory .
CEB	1%20Samuel	30	17	David attacked them from twilight until evening of the next day . He killed them all . [ c ] No one escaped except four hundred young men who got on camels and fled .
CEB	1%20Samuel	30	18	David rescued everything that the Amalekites had taken , including his own two wives .
CEB	1%20Samuel	30	19	Nothing was missing from the plunder or anything that they had taken , neither old nor young , son nor daughter . David brought everything back .
CEB	1%20Samuel	30	20	David also captured all the sheep and cattle , which were driven in front of the other livestock . The troops said , “ This is David ’ s plunder ! ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	30	21	David reached the two hundred men who were too exhausted to follow him and had stayed behind at the Besor ravine . They came out to greet him and the troops who were with him . When David approached them , he asked how they were doing .
CEB	1%20Samuel	30	22	But then all the evil and despicable individuals who had accompanied David said , “ We won ’ t share any of the plunder we rescued with them because they didn ’ t go with us . Each of them can take his wife and children and go—but that ’ s it. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	30	23	“ Brothers ! ” David said . “ Don ’ t act that way with the things the Lord has given us . He has protected us and handed over to us the raiding party that had attacked us .
CEB	1%20Samuel	30	24	How could anyone agree with you on this plan ? The share of those who went into battle and the share of those who stayed with the supplies will be divided equally. ”
CEB	1%20Samuel	30	25	So from that day forward , David made that a regulation and a law in Israel , which remains in place even now .
CEB	1%20Samuel	30	26	When David returned to Ziklag , he sent some of the plunder to the elders of Judah and to his friends . “ Here is a gift for you from the plunder of the Lord ’ s enemies , ” he said .

CEB	1%20Samuel	31	2	The Philistines overtook Saul and his sons , and they killed his sons Jonathan , Abinadab , and Malchishua .
CEB	1%20Samuel	31	3	The battle was fierce around Saul . When the archers located him , they wounded him badly . [ a ]
CEB	1%20Samuel	31	4	Saul said to his armor-bearer , “ Draw your sword and kill me with it ! Otherwise , these uncircumcised men will come and kill me or torture me. ” But his armor-bearer refused because he was terrified . So Saul took the sword and impaled himself on it .
CEB	1%20Samuel	31	5	When the armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead , he also impaled himself on his sword and died with Saul .
CEB	1%20Samuel	31	6	So Saul , his three sons , his armor-bearer , and all his soldiers died together that day .
CEB	1%20Samuel	31	7	When the Israelites across the valley and across the Jordan learned that the Israelite army had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead , they abandoned their towns and fled . So the Philistines came and occupied the towns .

CEB	2%20Samuel	1	6	The young man who brought the news replied , “ I just happened to be on Mount Gilboa and Saul was there , leaning on his spear , with chariots and horsemen closing in on him .
CEB	2%20Samuel	1	7	He turned around and saw me , then he called to me . ‘ Yes , sir , ’ I answered .

CEB	2%20Samuel	1	11	Then David grabbed his clothes and ripped them—and all his soldiers did the same .
CEB	2%20Samuel	1	12	They mourned and cried and fasted until evening for Saul , his son Jonathan , the Lord ’ s army , and the whole house of Israel , because they had died by the sword .
CEB	2%20Samuel	1	13	“ Where are you from ? ” David asked the young man who brought him the news . “ I ’ m the son of an immigrant , ” he answered . “ An Amalekite. ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	1	14	Then David said to him , “ How is it that you weren ’ t afraid to raise your hand and destroy the Lord ’ s anointed ? ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	1	15	Then David called for one of the young servants . “ Come here ! ” he said . “ Strike him down ! ” So the servant struck the Amalekite down , and he died .

CEB	2%20Samuel	2	8	Meanwhile , Abner , Ner ’ s son , the commander of Saul ’ s army , had taken Ishbosheth , [ a ] Saul ’ s son , and brought him over to Mahanaim .
CEB	2%20Samuel	2	9	There he made him king over Gilead , the Geshurites , [ b ] Jezreel , Ephraim , and Benjamin—over all Israel .
CEB	2%20Samuel	2	10	Saul ’ s son Ishbosheth was
CEB	2%20Samuel	2	40	years old when he became king over Israel , and he ruled for two years . The house of Judah , however , followed David .

CEB	2%20Samuel	2	12	Abner , Ner ’ s son , along with the soldiers of Ishbosheth , Saul ’ s son , left Mahanaim to go to Gibeon .
CEB	2%20Samuel	2	13	Joab , Zeruiah ’ s son , and David ’ s soldiers also came out and confronted them at the pool of Gibeon . One group sat on one side of the pool ; the other sat on the opposite side of the pool .
CEB	2%20Samuel	2	14	Abner said to Joab , “ Let ’ s have the young men fight in a contest [ c ] before us. ” “ All right , ” Joab said , “ let ’ s do it. ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	2	15	So the men came forward and were counted as they passed by : twelve for Benjamin and Ishbosheth , Saul ’ s son ; and twelve of David ’ s soldiers .
CEB	2%20Samuel	2	16	Each man grabbed his opponent by the head and stuck [ d ] his sword into his opponent ’ s side so that they both fell dead together . That ’ s why that place is called The Field of Daggers , [ e ] which is located in Gibeon .
CEB	2%20Samuel	2	17	A fierce battle took place that day , and Abner and the Israelite troops were defeated by David ’ s soldiers .
CEB	2%20Samuel	2	18	Now Zeruiah ’ s three sons were present at the battle : Joab , Abishai , and Asahel . Asahel was as fast as a gazelle in an open field .
CEB	2%20Samuel	2	19	Asahel went after Abner , staying completely focused in his pursuit of Abner .
CEB	2%20Samuel	2	20	Abner looked behind him and said , “ Is that you , Asahel ? ” “ Yes , it ’ s me , ” Asahel answered .
CEB	2%20Samuel	2	21	“ Break off your pursuit ! ” Abner told him . “ Fight one of the young warriors and take his gear for yourself ! ” But Asahel wouldn ’ t stop chasing him .
CEB	2%20Samuel	2	22	So Abner repeated himself to Asahel : “ Stop chasing me . Why should I kill you ? How could I look your brother Joab in the face ? ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	2	23	But Asahel wouldn ’ t turn back , so Abner hit him in the stomach with the back end of his spear . But the spear went through Asahel ’ s back . He fell down and died right there . Everyone who came to the place where Asahel had fallen and died just stood there ,
CEB	2%20Samuel	2	24	but Joab and Abishai went after Abner . The sun was setting when they came to the hill of Ammah , which faces Giah on the road to the Gibeon wilderness .
CEB	2%20Samuel	2	25	The Benjaminites rallied behind Abner , forming a single unit . Then they took their positions on the top of a hill .
CEB	2%20Samuel	2	26	Abner yelled down to Joab , “ Must the sword keep killing forever ? Don ’ t you realize that this will end bitterly ? How long before you order the troops to stop chasing their brothers ? ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	2	27	“ As surely as God lives , ” Joab replied , “ if you hadn ’ t just said that , the soldiers would have continued after their brothers until morning. ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	2	28	Joab blew the trumpet , [ f ] and all the soldiers stopped . They didn ’ t pursue Israel anymore , nor did they continue to fight .
CEB	2%20Samuel	2	29	Abner and his men then marched all night through the wilderness , crossing the Jordan River and marching all morning [ g ] until they got to Mahanaim .

CEB	2%20Samuel	3	7	Now Saul had a secondary wife named Rizpah , Aiah ’ s daughter . Ishbosheth [ b ] said to Abner , “ Why have you had sex with my father ’ s secondary wife ? ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	3	8	Abner got very angry over what Ishbosheth had said . “ Am I some sort of dog ’ s head ? ” [ c ] Abner asked . “ I ’ ve been nothing but loyal to the house of your father Saul and to his brothers and his friends . I haven ’ t handed you over to David , but today you accuse me of doing something wrong with this woman .

CEB	2%20Samuel	3	11	Ishbosheth couldn ’ t say a single word in reply to Abner because he was afraid of him .
CEB	2%20Samuel	3	12	Abner sent messengers to represent him to David and to say , “ Who will own the land ? [ d ] Make a covenant with me , then I ’ ll help bring all Israel over to your side. ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	3	13	“ Good ! ” David replied . “ I will make a covenant with you , but on one condition : don ’ t show yourself in my presence unless you bring Saul ’ s daughter Michal when you come to see me. ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	3	14	Then David sent messengers to Saul ’ s son Ishbosheth . “ Give me my wife Michal , ” he demanded . “ I became engaged to her at the cost of one hundred Philistine foreskins. ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	3	15	Ishbosheth then sent for Michal and took her from her husband Paltiel , Laish ’ s son .
CEB	2%20Samuel	3	16	Her husband went with her all the way to Bahurim , crying as he followed her . “ Go home ! ” Abner told him . So he went home .

CEB	2%20Samuel	3	18	“ It ’ s time to act because the Lord has said about David : I will rescue my people Israel from the power of the Philistines and all their enemies through my servant David. ”

CEB	2%20Samuel	3	25	Don ’ t you know the evil ways of Abner , Ner ’ s son ? [ f ] He came to trick you , to find out where you come and go , and to learn everything you do ! ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	3	26	Joab left David and sent messengers after Abner . They brought him back from the well at Sirah , but David didn ’ t know anything of this .
CEB	2%20Samuel	3	27	When Abner returned to Hebron , Joab took him aside next to [ g ] the gate to speak with him in private . But instead Joab stabbed Abner in the stomach , and he died for shedding the blood of Asahel , Joab ’ s brother .
CEB	2%20Samuel	3	28	When David heard about this later , he said , “ I and my kingdom are forever innocent before the Lord concerning the shedding of the blood of Abner , Ner ’ s son .
CEB	2%20Samuel	3	29	May it fall upon the head of Joab and his entire family tree ! May Joab ’ s family never be without someone with a discharge or a skin disease , [ h ] someone who uses a crutch , [ i ] someone who dies by the sword , or someone who is hungry ! ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	3	30	So that is how Joab and his brother Abishai murdered Abner , because he killed their brother Asahel in the battle at Gibeon .
CEB	2%20Samuel	3	31	Then David ordered Joab and all the troops who were with him , “ Tear your clothes and put on funeral clothes ! Mourn for Abner ! ” King David himself walked behind the body .
CEB	2%20Samuel	3	32	They buried Abner in Hebron . The king wept loudly at Abner ’ s grave . All the troops cried too .
CEB	2%20Samuel	3	33	Then the king sang this funeral song [ j ] for Abner : “ Should Abner have died like a fool dies ?
CEB	2%20Samuel	3	34	Your hands weren ’ t bound , your feet weren ’ t chained , but you have fallen like someone falls before the wicked. ” Then the troops cried over Abner again .
CEB	2%20Samuel	3	35	Then all the soldiers came to urge David to eat something while it was still day , but David swore , “ May God deal harshly with me and worse still if I eat bread or anything else before the sun goes down. ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	3	36	All the troops took notice of this and were pleased by it . Indeed , everything that the king did pleased them .
CEB	2%20Samuel	3	37	So on that day all the troops and all Israel knew that it wasn ’ t the king ’ s idea to kill Abner , Ner ’ s son .
CEB	2%20Samuel	3	38	The king told his soldiers , “ Don ’ t you know that a prince and a great man in Israel has fallen today ?
CEB	2%20Samuel	3	39	And today , though I am the anointed king , I am weak . These men , Zeruiah ’ s sons , are too strong for me . [ k ] May the Lord repay the one who does evil according to the evil they did ! ” Footnotes -

CEB	2%20Samuel	4	6	They went straight into his house , as if getting wheat , [ d ] and they stabbed him in the stomach . Then Rechab and his brother Baanah escaped .
CEB	2%20Samuel	4	7	They had entered the house while Ishbosheth was lying on the bed in his bedroom . After they stabbed him and killed him , they cut off his head , took it , and traveled all night through the wilderness .
CEB	2%20Samuel	4	8	They brought Ishbosheth ’ s head to David at Hebron . “ Here is the head of Ishbosheth , ” they told the king , “ the son of Saul your enemy , who wanted you dead . Today the Lord has avenged our master [ e ] the king on Saul and his descendants. ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	4	9	David answered Rechab and his brother Baanah , the sons of Rimmon from Beeroth , “ As surely as the Lord lives , who has rescued me [ f ] from all kinds of trouble , ” he told them ,
CEB	2%20Samuel	4	10	“ when someone told me Saul was dead back in Ziklag , thinking he was bringing good news , I grabbed him and killed him . That was the reward I gave him for his news !
CEB	2%20Samuel	4	11	What do you think I ’ ll do when evil people kill a righteous person in his own house on his own bed ? Why shouldn ’ t I demand his blood from your hands and rid the earth of you both ? ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	4	12	So David gave the order to his servants , and they killed Rechab and Baanah , cutting off their hands and feet and hanging them up by the pool at Hebron . But they took Ishbosheth ’ s head and buried it in the grave of Abner at Hebron . Footnotes -

CEB	2%20Samuel	5	11	Tyre ’ s King Hiram sent messengers to David with cedar logs , bricklayers , and carpenters to build David a palace .
CEB	2%20Samuel	5	12	Then David knew that the Lord had established him as king over Israel , and that his kingship was held in great honor for the sake of his people Israel .

CEB	2%20Samuel	5	18	The Philistines arrived and spread out over the Rephaim Valley .
CEB	2%20Samuel	5	19	David asked the Lord , “ Should I attack the Philistines ? Will you hand them over to me ? ” “ Attack them , ” the Lord replied , “ because I will definitely hand the Philistines over to you. ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	5	20	So David arrived at Baal-perazim and defeated the Philistines there . He said , “ The Lord has burst out against my enemies , the way water bursts out ! ” That is why that place is called Baal-perazim . [ f ]
CEB	2%20Samuel	5	21	The Philistines left their divine images behind , and David and his men carried them off .

CEB	2%20Samuel	6	7	The Lord became angry at Uzzah , and God struck him there because of his mistake , [ f ] and he died there next to God ’ s chest .

CEB	2%20Samuel	6	11	The Lord ’ s chest stayed with Obed-edom ’ s household in Gath for three months , and the Lord blessed Obed-edom ’ s household and all that he had .

CEB	2%20Samuel	6	17	The Lord ’ s chest was brought in and put in its place inside the tent that David had pitched for it . Then David offered entirely burned offerings in the Lord ’ s presence in addition to well-being sacrifices .

CEB	2%20Samuel	12	8	I gave your master ’ s house [ c ] to you , and gave his wives into your embrace . I gave you the house [ d ] of Israel and Judah . If that was too little , I would have given even more .

CEB	2%20Samuel	16	8	The Lord has paid you back for all the blood of Saul ’ s family , in whose place you rule , and the Lord has handed the kingdom over to your son Absalom . You are in this trouble because you are a murderer ! ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	16	9	Zeruiah ’ s son Abishai said to the king , “ Why should this dead dog curse my master the king ? Let me go over and cut his head off ! ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	16	10	But the king said , “ My problems aren ’ t yours , you sons of Zeruiah . If he is cursing because the Lord told him to curse David , then who is to question , ‘ Why are you doing this ? ’ ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	16	11	Then David addressed Abishai and all his servants : “ Listen ! My own son , one of my very own children , wants me dead . This Benjaminite can only feel the same—only more ! Leave him alone . And let him curse , because the Lord told him to .
CEB	2%20Samuel	16	12	Perhaps the Lord will see my distress ; perhaps the Lord will repay me with good for this cursing today. ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	16	13	So David and his men kept walking , while Shimei went along on the hillside next to him , cursing as he went , throwing rocks and dirt at him .
CEB	2%20Samuel	16	14	The king and all the people who were with him reached the Jordan River [ b ] exhausted , and he rested there . Ahithophel ’ s advice
CEB	2%20Samuel	16	15	Now Absalom and all the Israelites entered Jerusalem , and Ahithophel was with him .
CEB	2%20Samuel	16	17	But Absalom said to Hushai , “ Is this how you show loyal love to your friend ? Why didn ’ t you go with him ? ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	16	18	“ No , ” Hushai replied to Absalom , “ I will belong to the one chosen by the Lord , by this people , and by all Israel , and I will stay with him .
CEB	2%20Samuel	16	19	What ’ s more , whom should I serve if not David ’ s son ? I served your father , and so I will serve you in the same way. ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	16	20	Then Absalom said to Ahithophel , “ Give your advice then . What should we do ? ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	16	21	“ Have sex with your father ’ s secondary wives—the ones he left to take care of the palace , ” Ahithophel told Absalom . “ Then all Israel will hear that you have alienated yourself from your father , and everyone who supports you will be encouraged. ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	16	22	So they set up a tent for Absalom on the roof , and he had sex with his father ’ s secondary wives in plain sight before all Israel . (
CEB	2%20Samuel	16	23	Now in those days , the advice Ahithophel gave was like asking for a word from God . That ’ s why Ahithophel ’ s advice was valued by both David and Absalom . ) Footnotes -
CEB	2%20Samuel	17	2	Samuel 17:25 LXXA and
CEB	2%20Samuel	17	17	Jonathan and Ahimaaz were standing by at En-rogel . A female servant would come and report to them , and they would then travel and report to King David because they couldn ’ t risk being seen entering the city .
CEB	2%20Samuel	17	3	and I will bring all the people back to you like a bride comes back to her husband . [ a ] It ’ s only one man ’ s life you are seeking ; everyone else can be at peace. ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	17	4	This plan seemed excellent to Absalom and the Israelite elders . Hushai ’ s advice
CEB	2%20Samuel	17	5	But Absalom said , “ Call Hushai from Erek . Let ’ s hear what he has to say as well. ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	17	6	When Hushai from Erek arrived , Absalom said to him , “ This is what Ahithophel has advised . Should we follow it or not ? What do you say ? ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	17	7	Hushai said to Absalom , “ This time , the advice Ahithophel has given isn ’ t right .
CEB	2%20Samuel	17	8	You know that your father and his men are warriors , ” he continued , “ and they are as desperate as a wild bear robbed of her cubs . Your father is a seasoned fighter . He won ’ t spend the night with his troops .
CEB	2%20Samuel	17	9	Even now he has probably hidden himself in one of the caves or some other place . When some of the troops [ b ] fall in the first attack , whoever hears it will say , ‘ The soldiers who follow Absalom have been defeated ! ’
CEB	2%20Samuel	17	10	Then even the bravest soldier , whose heart is like a lion ’ s , will melt in fear because all Israel knows that your father is a warrior and that those who are with him are brave .
CEB	2%20Samuel	17	11	So I would advise that all the Israelites , from Dan to Beer-sheba—a group as countless as sand on the seashore—be summoned to join you , and that you yourself go into battle .
CEB	2%20Samuel	17	12	When we attack him wherever he might be , we will fall on him like dew that falls on the ground . No one will survive—not him and not one of the soldiers who are with him !
CEB	2%20Samuel	17	13	If he retreats into a city , all Israel will bring ropes to that city , and we will drag it into a valley until not even a pebble of it will be found. ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	17	14	Then Absalom and everyone in Israel agreed , “ The advice of Hushai from Erek is better than Ahithophel ’ s advice. ” This was because the Lord had decided to counter Ahithophel ’ s good advice so that the Lord could bring disaster on Absalom . Hushai warns David
CEB	2%20Samuel	17	15	Hushai told the priests Zadok and Abiathar , “ Here is what Ahithophel advised Absalom and the Israelite elders , and here is what I advised .
CEB	2%20Samuel	17	16	Now send word immediately to David and tell him , ‘ Don ’ t spend the night in the desert plains . You must cross over immediately . Otherwise , the king and all the troops who are with him will be swallowed up whole. ’ ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	17	18	But a boy saw them and reported it to Absalom . So the two of them left immediately and came to a man ’ s house at Bahurim . He had a well in his courtyard , and they climbed down into it .
CEB	2%20Samuel	17	19	The man ’ s wife took a covering and spread it over the well ’ s opening , then scattered grain over it so no one would notice .
CEB	2%20Samuel	17	20	When Absalom ’ s servants came to the woman at the house they demanded , “ Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan ? ” The woman told them , “ They crossed over the stream. ” [ c ] They looked for them but found nothing , so they returned to Jerusalem .
CEB	2%20Samuel	17	21	After they had left , Jonathan and Ahimaaz climbed out of the well . They went and reported to King David , “ Get up ! Cross the water immediately because Ahithophel has made plans against you ! ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	17	22	So David and all the troops who were with him got up and crossed the Jordan River . By daybreak there was no one left who hadn ’ t crossed the Jordan .
CEB	2%20Samuel	17	23	Meanwhile , once Ahithophel saw that his advice hadn ’ t been followed , he saddled his donkey and went home to his own town . He gave instructions to his household , then hanged himself and died . He was buried in his father ’ s tomb .
CEB	2%20Samuel	17	24	David had reached Mahanaim by the time Absalom and all the Israelites who were with him crossed the Jordan River .
CEB	2%20Samuel	17	25	Absalom had put Amasa in charge of the army instead of Joab . Amasa was the son of a man named Ithra , an Ishmaelite [ d ] who had married Abigail , who was Nahash ’ s daughter and the sister of Zeruiah , Joab ’ s mother .
CEB	2%20Samuel	17	26	Israel and Absalom camped in the territory of Gilead .
CEB	2%20Samuel	17	27	When David arrived in Mahanaim , Nahash ’ s son Shobi , who was from Rabbah of the Ammonites ; Ammiel ’ s son Machir , who was from Lo-debar ; and Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim
CEB	2%20Samuel	17	28	brought couches , basins , and pottery , along with wheat , barley , flour , roasted grain , beans , lentils ,
CEB	2%20Samuel	17	29	honey , curds , sheep , and cheese from the herd so that David and the troops who were with him could eat . They said , “ The troops have grown hungry , tired , and thirsty in the wilderness. ” Footnotes -

CEB	2%20Samuel	18	18	When he was alive , Absalom had raised a large pillar for himself in the King ’ s Valley because he said , “ I have no son to carry on the memory of my name. ” He named the pillar after himself . It is called Absalom ’ s Monument to this day . David mourns for Absalom
CEB	2%20Samuel	18	3	But the troops replied , “ No ! You must not march out ! If we flee , they won ’ t care about us . Even if half of us die , they won ’ t care about us . But you are worth ten thousand of us . It is much better if you support us from the city. ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	18	4	The king said to them , “ I will do whatever you think is best. ” So the king stood beside the gate as all the troops marched out by hundreds and thousands .
CEB	2%20Samuel	18	5	The king gave orders to Joab , Abishai , and Ittai : “ For my sake , protect my boy Absalom. ” All the troops heard what the king ordered regarding Absalom to all the commanders .
CEB	2%20Samuel	18	6	So the troops marched into the field to meet the Israelites . The battle was fought in the Ephraim forest .
CEB	2%20Samuel	18	7	The army of Israel was defeated there by David ’ s soldiers . A great slaughter of twenty thousand men took place that day .
CEB	2%20Samuel	18	8	The battle spread out over the entire countryside , and the forest devoured more soldiers than the sword that day .
CEB	2%20Samuel	18	9	Absalom came upon some of David ’ s men . Absalom was riding on a mule , and the mule went under the tangled branches of a large oak tree . Absalom ’ s head got caught in the tree . He was left hanging in midair while the mule under him kept on going .
CEB	2%20Samuel	18	10	One of the men saw this and reported to Joab , “ I just saw Absalom hanging from an oak tree. ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	18	11	Joab said to the man who told him , “ You saw this ? Why didn ’ t you kill him on the spot ? I would have given you ten pieces of silver and a belt. ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	18	12	But the man said to Joab , “ Even if I had a thousand pieces of silver in my hand , I wouldn ’ t touch the king ’ s son ! We heard what the king commanded you , Abishai , and Ittai— ‘ For my sake , take care of my boy Absalom. ’ [ a ]
CEB	2%20Samuel	18	13	If I had taken Absalom ’ s life behind the king ’ s back then—though nothing is hidden from the king—you would have kept your distance from me. ” [ b ]
CEB	2%20Samuel	18	14	Joab said , “ I won ’ t waste time like this with you ! ” He took three sticks in his hand and drove them into Absalom ’ s chest while he was still alive in the oak .
CEB	2%20Samuel	18	15	Then ten young armor-bearers of Joab surrounded Absalom , struck him , and killed him .
CEB	2%20Samuel	18	16	Then Joab sounded the trumpet , and the troops stopped chasing the Israelites , because Joab held them back .
CEB	2%20Samuel	18	17	They took Absalom and threw him into a big pit in the forest . They piled over him a huge heap of stones . Meanwhile , all the Israelites fled to their homes .
CEB	2%20Samuel	18	19	Then Zadok ’ s son Ahimaaz said , “ Please let me run and take the news to the king that the Lord has vindicated him against his enemies ’ power. ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	18	20	Joab said to him , “ You aren ’ t the one to bring the news today . You can bring news on another day , but not today , because the king ’ s son is dead. ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	18	21	Then Joab said to a Cushite , “ Go tell the king what you have seen. ” The Cushite bowed low before Joab , then ran off .
CEB	2%20Samuel	18	22	But Zadok ’ s son Ahimaaz again said to Joab , “ I don ’ t care what happens , just let me run after the Cushite too. ” “ Why do you want to go , son ? ” Joab asked . “ You ’ ll get no reward for going. ” [ c ]
CEB	2%20Samuel	18	23	“ I don ’ t care what happens , I want to go , ” Ahimaaz said . [ d ] So Joab said to him , “ Run off then ! ” Ahimaaz ran off , going by way of the plain , and passed the Cushite .
CEB	2%20Samuel	18	24	Now David was sitting between the two gates . The watchman on duty went up on the roof of the gate by the wall . He looked out and saw a man running alone .
CEB	2%20Samuel	18	25	The watchman called out and reported this to the king . The king said , “ If he ’ s alone , it ’ s good news. ” The man got nearer and nearer ,
CEB	2%20Samuel	18	26	and the watchman saw another man running and called down to the gatekeeper , “ There ’ s another man running alone. ” The king said , “ That one must be bringing good news too. ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	18	27	The watchman said , “ I can see that the first one runs like Zadok ’ s son Ahimaaz. ” “ He ’ s a good man , ” the king said , “ and is coming with good news. ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	18	28	Ahimaaz called out to the king , “ Peace ! ” then bowed low before the king , his nose to the ground . He said , “ Bless the Lord your God , who has delivered up the men who raised their hands against my master the king. ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	18	29	The king said , “ Is my boy Absalom okay ? ” Ahimaaz said , “ I saw a large crowd right when Joab , the king ’ s servant , sent your servant off , but I don ’ t know what it was about. ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	18	30	“ Step aside and stand right here , ” the king said . So Ahimaaz stepped aside and waited .
CEB	2%20Samuel	18	31	Then the Cushite arrived and said , “ My master the king : Listen to this good news ! The Lord has vindicated you this day against the power of all who rose up against you. ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	18	32	The king said to the Cushite , “ Is my boy Absalom okay ? ” The Cushite answered , “ May the enemies of my master the king and all who rise up against you to hurt you end up like that young man. ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	18	33	[ e ] The king trembled . He went up to the room over the gate and cried . As he went , he said , “ Oh , my son Absalom ! Oh , my son ! My son Absalom ! If only I had died instead of you ! Oh , Absalom , my son ! My son ! ” Footnotes -
CEB	2%20Samuel	19	2	Samuel 19:43 19:39-43 Heb uncertain
CEB	2%20Samuel	19	19	He said to the king , “ May my master not hold me guilty or remember your servant ’ s wrongdoing that day my master the king left Jerusalem . Please forget about it , Your Majesty , [ f ]
CEB	2%20Samuel	19	3	So that day the troops crept back into the city like soldiers creep back ashamed after they ’ ve fled from battle .
CEB	2%20Samuel	19	4	The king covered his face and cried out in a loud voice , “ Oh , my son Absalom ! Oh , Absalom , my son ! My son ! ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	19	5	Joab came to the king inside and said , “ Today you have humiliated all your servants who have saved your life today , not to mention the lives of your sons , your daughters , your wives , and your secondary wives ,
CEB	2%20Samuel	19	6	by loving those who hate you and hating those who love you ! Today you have announced that the commanders and their soldiers are nothing to you , because I know that if Absalom were alive today and the rest of us dead , that would be perfectly fine with you !
CEB	2%20Samuel	19	7	Now get up ! Go out and encourage your followers ! I swear to the Lord that if you don ’ t go out there , not one man will stick with you tonight—and that will be more trouble for you than all the trouble that you ’ ve faced from your youth until now. ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	19	8	So the king went and sat down in the city gate . All the troops were told that the king was sitting in the gate , so they came before the king . David returns to Jerusalem Meanwhile , the Israelites had fled to their homes .
CEB	2%20Samuel	19	9	Everyone was arguing throughout Israel ’ s tribes , saying , “ The king delivered us from our enemies ’ power , and he rescued us from the Philistines ’ power , but now he has fled from the land and from controlling his own kingdom . [ b ]
CEB	2%20Samuel	19	10	And Absalom , the one we anointed over us , is dead in battle . So why do you say nothing about bringing the king back ? ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	19	11	When the things that all the Israelites were saying reached the king , [ c ] David sent a message to the priests Zadok and Abiathar : “ Say the following to the elders of Judah : ‘ Why should you be the last to bring the king back to his palace ? [ d ]
CEB	2%20Samuel	19	12	You are my relatives ! You are my flesh and bones ! Why should you be the last to bring the king back ? ’
CEB	2%20Samuel	19	13	And tell Amasa , ‘ Aren ’ t you my flesh and bones too ? May God deal harshly with me and worse still if you don ’ t become commander of my army from now on instead of Joab ! ’ ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	19	14	So he won over the hearts of everyone in Judah as though they were one person , and they sent word to the king : “ Come back—you and all your servants. ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	19	15	So the king came back and arrived at the Jordan River . Judah came to Gilgal to meet the king and bring him across the Jordan .
CEB	2%20Samuel	19	16	Gera ’ s son Shimei , the Benjaminite from Bahurim , hurried down with the people of Judah to meet King David .
CEB	2%20Samuel	19	17	A thousand men from Benjamin were with him . Ziba too , the servant of Saul ’ s house , along with his fifteen sons and twenty servants , rushed to the Jordan ahead of the king
CEB	2%20Samuel	19	18	to do the work of ferrying [ e ] over the king ’ s household and to do whatever pleased him . Gera ’ s son Shimei fell down before the king when he crossed the Jordan .
CEB	2%20Samuel	19	20	because your servant knows that I have sinned . But look , I am the first person from the entire family of Joseph to come down today and meet my master the king. ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	19	21	Zeruiah ’ s son Abishai responded , “ Shouldn ’ t Shimei be put to death for that—for cursing the Lord ’ s anointed ? ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	19	22	But David said , “ My problems aren ’ t yours , you sons of Zeruiah . Why are you becoming my enemy today ? Should anyone in Israel be put to death today ? Don ’ t I know that today I am again king over Israel ? ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	19	23	Then the king told Shimei , “ You will not die. ” And the king swore this to him .
CEB	2%20Samuel	19	24	Mephibosheth , Saul ’ s grandson , also came down to meet the king . He hadn ’ t taken care of his feet , trimmed his beard , or washed his clothes from the day the king left until the day he returned safely .
CEB	2%20Samuel	19	25	When he came from Jerusalem to meet the king , the king asked him , “ Mephibosheth , why didn ’ t you go with me ? ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	19	26	“ My master and king , ” Mephibosheth answered , “ my servant abandoned me ! Because your servant is lame , I asked my servant , ‘ Saddle a donkey for me [ g ] so I can ride and go to the king. ’
CEB	2%20Samuel	19	27	So Ziba has slandered your servant to my master and king , but my master and king is a messenger of God . So do whatever seems best to you .
CEB	2%20Samuel	19	28	Even though all the members of my grandfather ’ s family were nothing short of demonic [ h ] toward my master and king , you still put your servant with those who eat at your table . So what right do I have to beg for still more from the king ? ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	19	29	“ You don ’ t need to talk any more about this , ” the king said to him . “ I order you and Ziba to divide the property. ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	19	30	Mephibosheth said to the king , “ Let him take all of it , since my master and king has come home safely. ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	19	31	Now Barzillai the Gileadite had come down from Rogelim . He accompanied the king to the Jordan River to send him off there .
CEB	2%20Samuel	19	32	Barzillai was very old ,
CEB	2%20Samuel	19	80	years old . Do I know what is good or bad anymore ? Can your servant taste what I eat or drink ? Can I even hear the voices of men or women singers ? Why should your servant be a burden to my master and king ?
CEB	2%20Samuel	19	33	The king said to Barzillai , “ Come over the Jordan with me . I will provide for you at my side in Jerusalem. ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	19	34	But Barzillai said to the king , “ How many years do I have left that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem ?
CEB	2%20Samuel	19	35	I am now
CEB	2%20Samuel	19	36	Your servant will cross a short way over the Jordan with the king , but why should the king give me such a reward ?
CEB	2%20Samuel	19	37	Let your servant return so I may die in my own town near the grave of my parents . But here is your servant Chimham . Let him cross over with my master and king , and treat him as you think best. ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	19	38	The king said , “ Okay . Chimham will cross over with me , and I will treat him as I [ i ] think best . And I will do for you anything you desire from me. ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	19	39	So all the people crossed over the Jordan River , and the king stayed behind . [ j ] The king kissed Barzillai and blessed him , and then Barzillai went back to his home .
CEB	2%20Samuel	19	40	When the king crossed over to Gilgal , Chimham went with him . All the troops of Judah and half the troops of Israel escorted the king across .
CEB	2%20Samuel	19	41	Then everyone in Israel came and said to the king , “ Why did our relatives the people of Judah steal you away , and bring the king and his household across the Jordan River , along with all of his soldiers ? ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	19	42	Then all the people of Judah answered the Israelites , “ Because the king is our relative ! Why are you angry at us about this ? Have we taken any of the king ’ s food ? Has he given us any gifts ? ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	19	43	But the Israelites answered the people of Judah , “ We have ten shares in the monarchy ! What ’ s more , we are the oldest offspring , not you ! [ k ] So why have you disrespected us ? Weren ’ t we the first to talk about bringing back our king ? ” But the words of the people of Judah were even harsher than the words of the Israelites .

CEB	2%20Samuel	20	4	Then the king said to Amasa , “ Call everyone in Judah here to me three days from now . You should be here too. ”

CEB	2%20Samuel	20	8	When they got to the great stone in Gibeon , Amasa came to meet them . Joab was dressed in his soldier ’ s uniform . Over the tunic at his waist he wore a sword in its sheath . As Joab went forward it slipped out .

CEB	2%20Samuel	20	22	When the woman went to everyone with her wise counsel , they cut off the head of Sheba , Bichri ’ s son , and threw it out to Joab .

CEB	2%20Samuel	21	4	The Gibeonites said to him , “ We don ’ t want any silver or gold from Saul or his family , and it isn ’ t our right to have anyone in Israel killed. ” “ What do you want ? ” [ a ] David asked . “ I ’ ll do it for you. ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	21	5	“ Okay then , ” they said to the king . “ That man who opposed and oppressed [ b ] us , who planned to destroy us , keeping us from having a place to live anywhere in Israel—
CEB	2%20Samuel	21	6	hand over seven of his sons to us , and we will hang them before the Lord at Gibeon [ c ] on the Lord ’ s mountain. ” “ I will hand them over , ” the king said .
CEB	2%20Samuel	21	7	But the king spared Mephibosheth , Jonathan ’ s son and Saul ’ s grandson , because of the Lord ’ s solemn pledge that was between them—between David and Saul ’ s son Jonathan .
CEB	2%20Samuel	21	8	So the king took the two sons of Aiah ’ s daughter Rizpah , Armoni and Mephibosheth , whom she had birthed for Saul ; and the five sons of Saul ’ s daughter Merab , [ d ] whom she birthed for Adriel , Barzillai ’ s son , who was from Meholah ,
CEB	2%20Samuel	21	9	and he handed them over to the Gibeonites . They hanged them on the mountain before the Lord . The seven of them died at the same time . They were executed in the first days of the harvest , at the beginning of the barley harvest .
CEB	2%20Samuel	21	10	Aiah ’ s daughter Rizpah took funeral clothing and spread it out by herself on a rock . She stayed there from the beginning of the harvest until the rains poured down on the bodies from the sky , and she wouldn ’ t let any birds of prey land on the bodies during the day or let wild animals come at nighttime .
CEB	2%20Samuel	21	11	When David was told what Aiah ’ s daughter Rizpah , Saul ’ s secondary wife , had done ,
CEB	2%20Samuel	21	12	he went and retrieved the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan from the citizens of Jabesh-gilead , who had stolen the bones from the public square in Beth-shan , where the Philistines had hanged them on the day the Philistines killed Saul at Gilboa .
CEB	2%20Samuel	21	13	David brought the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan from there and collected the bones of the men who had been hanged by the Gibeonites .
CEB	2%20Samuel	21	14	The bones of Saul and his son Jonathan were then buried in Zela , in Benjaminite territory , in the tomb of Saul ’ s father Kish . Once everything the king had commanded was done , God responded to prayers for the land . War with the Philistines
CEB	2%20Samuel	21	15	Once again war broke out between the Philistines and Israel . David and the soldiers who were with him went down and fought the Philistines . When David grew tired ,
CEB	2%20Samuel	21	16	Ishbi-benob , a descendant of the Raphah , [ e ] planned on killing David . [ f ] The weight of his spear was three hundred shekels of bronze , and he was wearing new armor .
CEB	2%20Samuel	21	17	But Zeruiah ’ s son Abishai came to David ’ s aid , striking the Philistine down and killing him . Then David ’ s men swore a solemn pledge to him : “ You will never march out to battle with us again ! You must not snuff out Israel ’ s lamp ! ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	21	18	Some time later , another battle with the Philistines took place at Gob . Then Sibbecai from Hushah killed Saph , a descendant of the Raphah .
CEB	2%20Samuel	21	19	There was yet another battle with the Philistines at Gob ; and Elhanan , Jair ’ s son [ g ] from Bethlehem , killed Goliath from Gath , whose spear shaft was as strong as the bar on a weaver ’ s loom .

CEB	2%20Samuel	22	21	The Lord rewarded me for my righteousness ; he restored me because my hands are clean ,

CEB	2%20Samuel	23	23	He was famous among the Thirty , but he didn ’ t become one of the Three . David placed him in command of his own bodyguard .
CEB	2%20Samuel	23	3	Israel ’ s God has spoken , Israel ’ s rock said to me : “ Whoever rules rightly over people , whoever rules in the fear of God ,
CEB	2%20Samuel	23	4	is like the light of sunrise on a morning with no clouds , like the bright gleam after the rain that brings grass from the ground. ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	23	5	Yes , my house is this way with God ! [ b ] He has made an eternal covenant with me , laid out and secure in every detail . Yes , he provides every one of my victories and brings my every desire to pass .
CEB	2%20Samuel	23	6	But despicable people are like thorns , all of them good for nothing , because they can ’ t be carried by hand .
CEB	2%20Samuel	23	7	No one can touch them , except with iron bar or the shaft of a spear . They must be burned up with fire right on the spot ! David ’ s warriors
CEB	2%20Samuel	23	8	These are the names of David ’ s warriors : Jeshbaal [ c ] from Hachmon [ d ] was chief of the Three . [ e ] He raised his spear [ f ] against eight hundred , killing them on a single occasion .
CEB	2%20Samuel	23	9	Next in command was Eleazar , Dodo ’ s son and Ahohi ’ s grandson . He was among the three warriors with David when they insulted the Philistines who had gathered there for battle . The Israelites retreated ,
CEB	2%20Samuel	23	10	but he stood his ground and fought the Philistines until his hand was weary and stuck to the sword . But the Lord accomplished a great victory that day . The troops then returned to Eleazar , but only to plunder the dead .
CEB	2%20Samuel	23	11	Next in command was Agee ’ s son Shammah , who was from Harar . The Philistines had gathered at Lehi , where there was a plot of land full of lentils . The troops fled from the Philistines ,
CEB	2%20Samuel	23	12	but Shammah took a position in the middle of the plot , defended it , and struck down the Philistines . The Lord accomplished a great victory .
CEB	2%20Samuel	23	13	At harvesttime , three of the thirty chiefs went down and joined David at the fortress [ g ] of Adullam , while a force of Philistines were camped in the Rephaim Valley .
CEB	2%20Samuel	23	14	At that time , David was in the fortress , and a Philistine fort was in Bethlehem .
CEB	2%20Samuel	23	15	David had a craving and said , “ If only someone could give me a drink of water from the well by the gate in Bethlehem. ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	23	16	So the three warriors broke through the Philistine camp and drew water from the well by the gate in Bethlehem and brought it back to David . But he refused to drink it and poured it out to the Lord .
CEB	2%20Samuel	23	17	“ The Lord forbid that I should do that , ” he said . “ Isn ’ t this the blood of men who risked their lives ? ” So he refused to drink it . These were the kinds of things the three warriors did .
CEB	2%20Samuel	23	18	Now Zeruiah ’ s son Abishai , the brother of Joab , was chief of the Thirty . [ h ] He raised his spear against three hundred men , killed them , and made a name for himself along with the Three .
CEB	2%20Samuel	23	19	He was the most famous of the Thirty . [ i ] He became their commander , but he wasn ’ t among the Three .
CEB	2%20Samuel	23	20	Jehoiada ’ s son Benaiah was a hero from Kabzeel who performed great deeds . He killed the two sons [ j ] of Ariel from Moab . He once went down into a pit and killed a lion on a snowy day .
CEB	2%20Samuel	23	21	He also killed a giant [ k ] Egyptian who had a spear in his hand . Benaiah went against him armed with a staff . He grabbed the spear out of the Egyptian ’ s hand and killed him with his own spear .
CEB	2%20Samuel	23	22	These were the kinds of things Jehoiada ’ s son Benaiah did . He made a name for himself along with the three warriors .

CEB	2%20Samuel	24	2	Samuel 24:13 LXX ,
CEB	2%20Samuel	24	24	“ No , ” the king said to Araunah . “ I will buy them from you at a fair price . I won ’ t offer up to the Lord my God entirely burned offerings that cost me nothing. ” So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver .
CEB	2%20Samuel	24	3	Joab said to the king , “ May the Lord your God increase the number of people a hundred times while the eyes of my master the king can still see it ! But why does my master the king want to do this ? ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	24	4	But the king ’ s word overruled Joab and the military commanders . So Joab and the commanders left the king ’ s presence to take a census of the Israelites .
CEB	2%20Samuel	24	5	They crossed the Jordan River and began from Aroer and from [ b ] the town that is in the middle of the valley of Gad , then on to Jazer .
CEB	2%20Samuel	24	6	They continued to Gilead and on to Kadesh in Hittite territory . [ c ] They came to Dan [ d ] and went around to Sidon .
CEB	2%20Samuel	24	7	They went to the fortress of Tyre and to all the towns of the Hivites and the Canaanites . They went out to Beer-sheba in the arid southern plain of Judah .
CEB	2%20Samuel	24	8	At the end of nine months and twenty days , after going through the entire country , they came back to Jerusalem .
CEB	2%20Samuel	24	9	Joab reported to the king the number of the people who had been counted : in Israel there were eight hundred thousand strong men who could handle a sword ; in Judah the total was five hundred thousand men .
CEB	2%20Samuel	24	10	But after this David felt terrible that he had counted the people . David said to the Lord , “ I have sinned greatly in what I have done . Now , Lord , please take away the guilt of your servant because I have done something very foolish. ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	24	11	When David got up the next morning , the Lord ’ s word came to the prophet Gad , David ’ s seer :
CEB	2%20Samuel	24	12	Go and tell David , This is what the Lord says : I ’ m offering you three punishments . Choose one of them , and that is what I will do to you .
CEB	2%20Samuel	24	13	So Gad went to David and said to him , “ Will three [ e ] years of famine come on your land ? Or will you run from your enemies for three months while they chase you ? Or will there be three days of plague in your land ? Decide now what answer I should take back to the one who sent me. ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	24	14	“ I ’ m in deep trouble , ” David said to Gad . “ Let ’ s fall into the Lord ’ s hands because his mercy is great , but don ’ t let me fall into human hands. ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	24	15	So the Lord sent a plague on Israel from that very morning until the allotted time . Seventy thousand people died , from Dan to Beer-sheba .
CEB	2%20Samuel	24	16	But when the divine messenger stretched out his hand to destroy Jerusalem , the Lord regretted doing this disaster and said to the messenger who was destroying the people , “ That ’ s enough ! Withdraw your hand. ” At that time the Lord ’ s messenger was by the threshing floor of Araunah from Jebus .
CEB	2%20Samuel	24	17	When David saw the messenger who was striking down the people , he said , “ I ’ m the one who sinned ! I ’ m the one who has done wrong . But these sheep—what have they done wrong ? Turn your hand against me and my household. ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	24	18	That same day Gad came to David and told him , “ Go up and build an altar to the Lord on the threshing floor of Araunah from Jebus. ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	24	19	So David went up , following Gad ’ s instructions , just as the Lord had commanded .
CEB	2%20Samuel	24	20	Araunah looked up and saw the king and his servants approaching him . Araunah rushed out and bowed low before the king , his nose to the ground .
CEB	2%20Samuel	24	21	Araunah said , “ Why has my master and king come to his servant ? ” David said , “ To buy this threshing floor from you to build an altar to the Lord , so the plague among the people may come to an end. ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	24	22	Then Araunah said to David , “ Take it for yourself , and may my master the king do what he thinks is best . Here are oxen for the entirely burned offering , and here are threshing boards and oxen yokes for wood .
CEB	2%20Samuel	24	23	All this , Your Majesty , Araunah gives to the king. ” Then he added , “ May the Lord your God respond favorably to you ! ”
CEB	2%20Samuel	24	25	David built an altar there for the Lord and offered entirely burned offerings and well-being sacrifices . The Lord responded to the prayers for the land , and the plague against Israel came to an end . Footnotes -

CEB	1%20Kings	1	2	They said to him , “ Allow us to find a young woman for our master the king . She will serve the king and take care of him by lying beside our master the king and keeping him warm. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	1	3	So they looked in every corner of Israel until they found Abishag from Shunem . They brought her to the king .
CEB	1%20Kings	1	4	She was very beautiful . She cared for the king and served him , but the king didn ’ t have sex with her . Adonijah ’ s rebellion
CEB	1%20Kings	1	5	Adonijah , Haggith ’ s son , bragged about himself and said , “ I ’ ll rule as king myself. ” He got his own chariot and horses with fifty runners to go in front .
CEB	1%20Kings	1	6	Now Adonijah ’ s father had never given him direction ; he never questioned why Adonijah did what he did . He was very handsome and was born after Absalom .
CEB	1%20Kings	1	7	He took advice from Joab , Zeruiah ’ s son , and from the priest Abiathar . They assisted Adonijah .
CEB	1%20Kings	1	8	But Zadok the priest , Jehoiada ’ s son Benaiah , the prophet Nathan , Shimei and his friends , and David ’ s veterans didn ’ t join Adonijah .
CEB	1%20Kings	1	9	So Adonijah prepared lamb , oxen , and fattened cattle at the Stone of Zoheleth , next to En-rogel . He invited his brothers ( the royal princes ) and all the citizens of Judah who were the royal servants to come .
CEB	1%20Kings	1	10	But he didn ’ t invite the prophet Nathan , Benaiah , David ’ s veterans , or his brother Solomon .
CEB	1%20Kings	1	11	Nathan said to Bathsheba , Solomon ’ s mother , “ Did you hear that Adonijah , Haggith ’ s son , has become king , but our master David doesn ’ t know about it ?
CEB	1%20Kings	1	12	Let me give you some advice on how you and your son Solomon can survive this .
CEB	1%20Kings	1	13	Go to King David and say , ‘ Didn ’ t my master the king swear to your servant , “ Your son Solomon will certainly rule after me . He will sit on my throne ” ? Why then has Adonijah become king ? ’
CEB	1%20Kings	1	14	While you are speaking there with the king , I ’ ll come along and support your words. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	1	15	So Bathsheba went to the king in his bedroom . The king was very old , and Abishag from Shunem was serving the king .
CEB	1%20Kings	1	16	Bathsheba bowed down on her face before the king . The king asked , “ What do you want ? ”
CEB	1%20Kings	1	17	She said to him , “ Your Majesty , you swore by the Lord your God to your servant , ‘ Your son Solomon will certainly rule after me . He will sit on my throne. ’
CEB	1%20Kings	1	18	But now , look , Adonijah has become king , and my master the king doesn ’ t know about it .
CEB	1%20Kings	1	19	He has prepared large quantities of oxen , fattened cattle , and lamb . He has invited all the royal princes as well as Abiathar the priest and Joab the general . However , he didn ’ t invite your servant Solomon .
CEB	1%20Kings	1	20	As for you , my master the king , the eyes of all Israel are upon you to tell them who will follow you on the throne of my master the king .
CEB	1%20Kings	1	21	When my master the king lies down with his ancestors , then I and my son Solomon will become outlaws. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	1	22	While she was still speaking with the king , the prophet Nathan arrived .
CEB	1%20Kings	1	23	The king was informed , “ The prophet Nathan is here. ” Then Nathan came in before the king and bowed his face to the ground .
CEB	1%20Kings	1	24	He said , “ My master the king , you must have said , ‘ Adonijah will become king after me and will sit on my throne. ’
CEB	1%20Kings	1	25	Indeed , today he went down and prepared oxen , fattened cattle , and lamb in large numbers . He invited all the royal princes , the generals , and Abiathar the priest . They are eating and drinking with him , and they said , ‘ Long live King Adonijah ! ’
CEB	1%20Kings	1	26	Adonijah didn ’ t invite me , your servant , Zadok the priest , Jehoiada ’ s son Benaiah , or your servant Solomon .
CEB	1%20Kings	1	27	If this message was from my master the king , you didn ’ t make it known to your servant . Who should follow you on the throne of my master the king ? ”
CEB	1%20Kings	1	28	King David answered , “ Bring me Bathsheba. ” She came and stood before the king .
CEB	1%20Kings	1	29	The king made a solemn pledge and said , “ As surely as the Lord lives , who rescued me from every trouble ,
CEB	1%20Kings	1	30	regarding what I swore to you by the Lord , Israel ’ s God , ‘ Your son Solomon will certainly succeed me ; he will sit on the throne after me ’ —I ’ ll see that it happens today. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	1	31	Bathsheba bowed down with her face to the ground . She honored the king and said , “ May my master King David live forever ! ”
CEB	1%20Kings	1	32	King David said , “ Bring me Zadok the priest , the prophet Nathan , and Benaiah , Jehoiada ’ s son. ” They came to the king ,
CEB	1%20Kings	1	33	who said to them , “ Take with you the servants of your masters . Put my son Solomon on my mule and bring him down to Gihon .
CEB	1%20Kings	1	34	There Zadok the priest and the prophet Nathan will anoint him king over Israel . Blow the ram ’ s horn and say , ‘ Long live King Solomon ! ’
CEB	1%20Kings	1	35	You will follow him . He will enter and sit on my throne , and so he will succeed me as king . I have appointed him to become ruler over Israel and Judah. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	1	36	Benaiah , Jehoiada ’ s son , responded to the king , “ Yes , may it happen as the Lord , the God of my king , says .
CEB	1%20Kings	1	37	Just as the Lord was with my master the king , so may he be with Solomon . May his throne be even greater than the throne of my master King David. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	1	38	Zadok the priest , the prophet Nathan , Jehoiada ’ s son Benaiah , and the Cherethites and the Pelethites went down and put Solomon on King David ’ s mule . They led him to Gihon .
CEB	1%20Kings	1	39	Zadok the priest took the horn of oil from the tent and anointed Solomon . They blew the ram ’ s horn , and all the people said , “ Long live King Solomon ! ”
CEB	1%20Kings	1	40	All the people followed him playing flutes and celebrating . The ground shook at their noise .
CEB	1%20Kings	1	41	Adonijah and all his invited guests heard this when they had finished eating . When Joab heard the sound of the ram ’ s horn , he said , “ What ’ s that noise coming from the city ? ”
CEB	1%20Kings	1	42	While he was still speaking , Jonathan , Abiathar the priest ’ s son , arrived . Adonijah said , “ Come on in ! You are an honest man and will bring a good report. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	1	43	Jonathan replied to Adonijah , “ No ! Our master King David has made Solomon king !
CEB	1%20Kings	1	44	To support him , the king sent along Zadok the priest ; the prophet Nathan ; Benaiah , Jehoiada ’ s son ; and the Cherethites and the Pelethites . They ’ ve put Solomon on the royal mule .
CEB	1%20Kings	1	45	Zadok the priest and the prophet Nathan have anointed him king at Gihon . They went up from there celebrating so that the city was thrown into a commotion . That is the sound you heard .
CEB	1%20Kings	1	46	There ’ s more : Solomon has taken over the throne of the kingdom .
CEB	1%20Kings	1	47	The royal attendants blessed our master King David : ‘ May your God make Solomon ’ s name better than your name . May God elevate his throne above your throne. ’ ” The king then worshipped on his bed
CEB	1%20Kings	1	48	and said , “ Bless Israel ’ s God , the Lord , who today has set my son [ a ] on my throne , and has allowed my eyes to see it. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	1	49	Trembling with fear , all of Adonijah ’ s guests got up and fled , each going a different way .
CEB	1%20Kings	1	50	Adonijah was afraid of Solomon , so he got up and went to grab hold of the horns of the altar .
CEB	1%20Kings	1	51	Solomon was told , “ Look ! Adonijah is afraid of King Solomon and has grabbed the horns of the altar . He ’ s saying , ‘ King Solomon must swear to me first that he won ’ t execute his servant with the sword. ’ ”
CEB	1%20Kings	1	52	Solomon said , “ If he shows himself to be an honorable person , then not a hair of his head will be harmed . But if any evil is found in him , he will die. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	1	53	King Solomon sent word and had him brought down from the altar . He came and bowed down to King Solomon . Solomon said to him , “ Go home ! ” Footnotes -

CEB	1%20Kings	2	2	“ I ’ m following the path that the whole earth takes . Be strong and be a man .
CEB	1%20Kings	2	3	Guard what is owed to the Lord your God , walking in his ways and observing his laws , his commands , his judgments , and his testimonies , just as it is written in the Instruction from Moses . In this way you will succeed in whatever you do and wherever you go .
CEB	1%20Kings	2	4	So also the Lord will confirm the word he spoke to me : ‘ If your children will take care to walk before me faithfully , with all their heart and all their being , then one of your own children will never fail to be on the throne of Israel. ’
CEB	1%20Kings	2	5	You should know what Joab , Zeruiah ’ s son , has done to me and what he did to the two generals of Israel , Abner , Ner ’ s son , and Amasa , Jether ’ s son . He murdered them , spilling blood at peacetime and putting the blood of war on the belt around his waist and on the sandals on his feet .
CEB	1%20Kings	2	6	So act wisely : Don ’ t allow him to die a peaceful death .
CEB	1%20Kings	2	7	As for Barzillai ’ s sons from Gilead , show them kindness . Let them eat with you . When I was running away from your brother Absalom , they came to me .
CEB	1%20Kings	2	8	Now as for this Shimei , Gera ’ s son—a Benjaminite from Bahurim—who is with you , he cursed me viciously when I went to Mahanaim . When he came down to meet me at the Jordan , I swore to him by the Lord , ‘ Surely I won ’ t execute you with the sword. ’
CEB	1%20Kings	2	9	But you don ’ t need to excuse him . You are wise and know what to do to him . Give him a violent death. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	2	10	Then David lay down with his ancestors and was buried in David ’ s City .
CEB	1%20Kings	2	11	He ruled over Israel forty years—seven years in Hebron and thirty-three years in Jerusalem . Solomon secures his throne
CEB	1%20Kings	2	12	Solomon sat on the throne of his father David , and his royal power was well established .
CEB	1%20Kings	2	13	Adonijah , Haggith ’ s son , went to Bathsheba , Solomon ’ s mother . She said , “ Are you coming in peace ? ” He said , “ Yes .
CEB	1%20Kings	2	14	I have something to say to you. ” She said , “ Say it. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	2	15	He said , “ You know how the kingdom was mine . All Israel had appointed me as their king . Then suddenly the kingdom went to my brother as the Lord willed .
CEB	1%20Kings	2	16	Now I have just one request of you . Don ’ t refuse me ! ” She said to him , “ Go on. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	2	17	Adonijah continued , “ Ask King Solomon to let me marry Abishag from Shunem—he won ’ t refuse you. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	2	18	Bathsheba said , “ Okay ; I ’ ll speak to the king for you. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	2	19	So Bathsheba went to King Solomon to talk with him about Adonijah . The king stood up to meet her and bowed low to her . Then he returned to his throne and had a throne set up for the queen mother . She sat to his right .
CEB	1%20Kings	2	20	She said , “ I have just one small request for you . Don ’ t refuse me. ” The king said to her , “ Mother , ask me . I won ’ t refuse you. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	2	21	“ Let Abishag from Shunem be married to your brother Adonijah , ” she said .
CEB	1%20Kings	2	22	King Solomon replied to his mother , “ Why ask only for Abishag from Shunem for Adonijah ? Why not ask for the entire kingdom for him ? After all , he is my older brother and has the support of Abiathar the priest and Joab , Zeruiah ’ s son. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	2	23	King Solomon swore by the Lord , “ May God do to me as he sees fit ! Adonijah has made this request at the cost of his life !
CEB	1%20Kings	2	24	Now , as surely as the Lord lives—the one who supported me , put me on the throne of my father David , and provided a royal house for me exactly as he promised—Adonijah will be executed today. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	2	25	So King Solomon sent Benaiah , Jehoiada ’ s son . He attacked Adonijah , and Adonijah died .
CEB	1%20Kings	2	26	The king said to the priest Abiathar , “ Go to your fields at Anathoth , because you are a condemned man . However , I won ’ t kill you today because you carried the Lord ’ s chest in front of my father David and because you shared in all my father ’ s sufferings. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	2	27	So Solomon expelled Abiathar from the Lord ’ s priesthood in order to fulfill the Lord ’ s word that was spoken against Eli ’ s family at Shiloh .
CEB	1%20Kings	2	28	Now the news reached Joab because he had supported Adonijah , though he hadn ’ t supported Absalom . Joab ran to the Lord ’ s tent and grabbed the horns of the altar .
CEB	1%20Kings	2	29	King Solomon was told that Joab had fled to the Lord ’ s tent and was now beside the altar . So Solomon sent Benaiah , Jehoiada ’ s son , instructing him , “ Go . Attack Joab ! ”
CEB	1%20Kings	2	30	Benaiah came to the Lord ’ s tent and said to Joab , “ The king says , ‘ Come out ! ’ ” Joab said , “ No ! I ’ d rather die here. ” Benaiah sent a report back to the king : “ This is what Joab said and how he answered me. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	2	31	The king said to him , “ Do as he said . Attack him and then bury him . In doing this , you will remove from me and from my father ’ s royal house the guilt over the innocent blood that Joab shed .
CEB	1%20Kings	2	32	May the Lord return that bloodguilt back on his own head for attacking the two men who were better and more righteous than he was . He murdered those two with the sword : Abner , Ner ’ s son and Israel ’ s general , and Amasa , Jether ’ s son and Judah ’ s general . But my father David didn ’ t know about it .
CEB	1%20Kings	2	33	May the bloodguilt for their deaths return on Joab ’ s head and on the head of his family line forever . But may the Lord ’ s peace be on David , his family , and his royal house forever. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	2	34	So Benaiah , Jehoiada ’ s son , went and attacked Joab and killed him . Joab was buried at his home in the wilderness .
CEB	1%20Kings	2	35	In his place , the king gave leadership of the army to Benaiah , Jehoiada ’ s son . The king put the priest Zadok in Abiathar ’ s position .
CEB	1%20Kings	2	36	Then he sent for Shimei and said , “ Build a house for yourself in Jerusalem and stay in the city . Don ’ t leave to go anywhere else .
CEB	1%20Kings	2	37	If you try to leave , be advised that on the day you cross the Kidron Valley you will most certainly die . Your bloodguilt will be on your own head. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	2	38	Shimei said to the king , “ This is a good idea . Your servant will do just what my master the king said. ” So Shimei stayed in Jerusalem for a long time .
CEB	1%20Kings	2	39	After three years , two of Shimei ’ s servants fled to the king of Gath , Achish , Maacah ’ s son . Shimei was informed , “ Your servants are now in Gath. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	2	40	Shimei saddled his donkey and went to Achish in Gath to look for his servants . Shimei then brought his servants back from Gath .
CEB	1%20Kings	2	41	Solomon was told that Shimei had left Jerusalem for Gath and then returned .
CEB	1%20Kings	2	42	The king sent for Shimei and asked him , “ Didn ’ t I make you swear a solemn pledge by the Lord ? And didn ’ t I swear to you , ‘ If you try to leave and go anywhere , be advised that on that very day you will most certainly die ’ ? You said to me , ‘ This is a good idea . I agree to it. ’
CEB	1%20Kings	2	43	Why didn ’ t you keep your solemn promise to the Lord and the command that I gave you ? ”
CEB	1%20Kings	2	44	The king said further , “ You know quite well all the evil that you did to my father David . May the Lord return your evil on your own head .
CEB	1%20Kings	2	45	However , may King Solomon be blessed and David ’ s throne be secure before the Lord forever. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	2	46	Then the king commanded Benaiah , Jehoiada ’ s son , who went and attacked Shimei , and he died . In these ways royal power was handed over to Solomon .
CEB	1%20Kings	3	1	Kings
CEB	1%20Kings	3	3	Now Solomon loved the Lord by walking in the laws of his father David , with the exception that he also sacrificed and burned incense at the shrines .
CEB	1%20Kings	3	2	Unfortunately , the people were sacrificing at the shrines because a temple hadn ’ t yet been built for the Lord ’ s name in those days .
CEB	1%20Kings	3	4	The king went to the great shrine at Gibeon in order to sacrifice there . He used to offer a thousand entirely burned offerings on that altar .
CEB	1%20Kings	3	5	The Lord appeared to Solomon at Gibeon in a dream at night . God said , “ Ask whatever you wish , and I ’ ll give it to you. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	3	6	Solomon responded , “ You showed so much kindness to your servant my father David when he walked before you in truth , righteousness , and with a heart true to you . You ’ ve kept this great loyalty and kindness for him and have now given him a son to sit on his throne .
CEB	1%20Kings	3	7	And now , Lord my God , you have made me , your servant , king in my father David ’ s place . But I ’ m young and inexperienced . I know next to nothing .
CEB	1%20Kings	3	8	But I ’ m here , your servant , in the middle of the people you have chosen , a large population that can ’ t be numbered or counted due to its vast size .
CEB	1%20Kings	3	9	Please give your servant a discerning mind in order to govern your people and to distinguish good from evil , because no one is able to govern this important people of yours without your help. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	3	10	It pleased the Lord that Solomon had made this request .
CEB	1%20Kings	3	11	God said to him , “ Because you have asked for this instead of requesting long life , wealth , or victory over your enemies—asking for discernment so as to acquire good judgment—
CEB	1%20Kings	3	12	I will now do just what you said . Look , I hereby give you a wise and understanding mind . There has been no one like you before now , nor will there be anyone like you afterward .
CEB	1%20Kings	3	13	I now also give you what you didn ’ t ask for : wealth and fame . There won ’ t be a king like you as long as you live .
CEB	1%20Kings	3	14	And if you walk in my ways and obey my laws and commands , just as your father David did , then I will give you a very long life. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	3	15	Solomon awoke and realized it was a dream . He went to Jerusalem and stood before the chest containing the Lord ’ s covenant . Then he offered entirely burned offerings and well-being sacrifices , and held a celebration for all his servants . Solomon and the prostitutes
CEB	1%20Kings	3	16	Sometime later , two prostitutes came and stood before the king .
CEB	1%20Kings	3	17	One of them said , “ Please , Your Majesty , listen : This woman and I have been living in the same house . I gave birth while she was there .
CEB	1%20Kings	3	18	This woman gave birth three days after I did . We stayed together . Apart from the two of us , there was no one else in the house .
CEB	1%20Kings	3	19	This woman ’ s son died one night when she rolled over him .
CEB	1%20Kings	3	20	She got up in the middle of the night and took my son from my side while I was asleep . She laid him on her chest and laid her dead son on mine .
CEB	1%20Kings	3	21	When I got up in the morning to nurse my son , he was dead ! But when I looked more closely in the daylight , it turned out that it wasn ’ t my son—not the baby I had birthed. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	3	22	The other woman said , “ No ! My son is alive ! Your son is the dead one. ” But the first woman objected , “ No ! Your son is dead ! My son is alive ! ” In this way they argued back and forth in front of the king .
CEB	1%20Kings	3	23	The king said , “ This one says , ‘ My son is alive and your son is dead. ’ The other one says , ‘ No ! Your son is dead and my son is alive. ’
CEB	1%20Kings	3	24	Get me a sword ! ” They brought a sword to the king .
CEB	1%20Kings	3	25	Then the king said , “ Cut the living child in two ! Give half to one woman and half to the other woman. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	3	26	Then the woman whose son was still alive said to the king , “ Please , Your Majesty , give her the living child ; please don ’ t kill him , ” for she had great love for her son . But the other woman said , “ If I can ’ t have him , neither will you . Cut the child in half. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	3	27	Then the king answered , “ Give the first woman the living newborn . Don ’ t kill him . She is his mother. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	3	28	All Israel heard about the judgment that the king made . Their respect for the king grew because they saw that God ’ s wisdom was in him so he could execute justice .
CEB	1%20Kings	4	1	Kings 4:22 One kor is possibly equal to fifty gallons .
CEB	1%20Kings	4	4	the general Benaiah , Jehoiada ’ s son ; the priests Zadok and Abiathar ;

CEB	1%20Kings	4	7	Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel . They supplied the king and his palace with food . Each would provide the supplies for one month per year .
CEB	1%20Kings	4	8	Here are their names : Ben-hur in the highlands of Ephraim ;
CEB	1%20Kings	4	9	Ben-deker in Makaz , Shaalbim , Beth-shemesh , and Elon-bethhanan ;

CEB	1%20Kings	4	13	Ben-geber in Ramoth-gilead , who controlled the villages of Jair , Manasseh ’ s son , which were in Gilead , and who had the Argob region that was in Bashan—sixty large walled cities with bronze bars ;
CEB	1%20Kings	4	14	Ahinadab , Iddo ’ s son , in Mahanaim ;
CEB	1%20Kings	4	15	Ahimaaz in Naphtali , who also took Solomon ’ s daughter Basemath as his wife ;

CEB	1%20Kings	4	19	Geber , Uri ’ s son , in the land of Gilead , the land of the Amorite king Sihon and of King Og of Bashan ; and there was a single officer who was in the land of Judah . [ a ]
CEB	1%20Kings	4	20	Judah and Israel grew numerous like the sand alongside the sea . They ate , drank , and celebrated .
CEB	1%20Kings	4	21	[ b ] Solomon ruled over all the states from the Euphrates River through the Philistines ’ land and as far as the border of Egypt . These areas brought tribute to Solomon and served him all the days of his life .
CEB	1%20Kings	4	22	Solomon ’ s food requirements for a single day included thirty kors [ c ] of refined flour ; sixty kors of flour ;
CEB	1%20Kings	4	23	ten head of grain-fattened cattle ; twenty head of pastured cattle ; one hundred sheep ; as well as deer , gazelles , roebucks , and the best of fowl .
CEB	1%20Kings	4	24	He ruled over all the lands west of the Euphrates River , from Tiphsah to Gaza , and over all the kings west of the Euphrates . He had peace on all sides .
CEB	1%20Kings	4	25	The people of Judah and Israel from Dan all the way to Beer-sheba lived securely under their vines and fig trees throughout the days of Solomon .
CEB	1%20Kings	4	26	Solomon had forty thousand horse stalls for his chariots and twelve thousand additional horses .
CEB	1%20Kings	4	27	The officials provided King Solomon and all who joined him at the royal table with monthly food rations . They left out nothing .
CEB	1%20Kings	4	28	Each brought their share of barley and straw for the horses and for the chariot horses , bringing it to its proper place .
CEB	1%20Kings	4	29	And God gave Solomon wisdom and very great understanding—insight as long as the seashore itself .
CEB	1%20Kings	4	30	Solomon ’ s wisdom was greater than all the famous Easterners , greater even than all the wisdom of Egypt .
CEB	1%20Kings	4	31	He was wiser than anyone , more wise than Ethan the Ezrahite or Mahol ’ s sons : Heman , Calcol , and Darda . His reputation was known throughout the region .
CEB	1%20Kings	4	32	Solomon spoke three thousand proverbs and one thousand five songs .
CEB	1%20Kings	4	33	He described the botany of trees , whether the cedar in Lebanon or the hyssop that grows out of the wall . He also described cattle , birds , anything that crawls on the ground , and fish .
CEB	1%20Kings	4	34	People came from everywhere to listen to Solomon ’ s wisdom ; even the earth ’ s kings who had heard about his wisdom came ! Footnotes -
CEB	1%20Kings	5	1	Kings 5:11 One kor is possibly equal to fifty gallons .
CEB	1%20Kings	5	5	So I ’ m planning to build a temple for the name of the Lord my God , just as the Lord indicated to my father David , ‘ I will give you a son to follow you on your throne . He will build the temple for my name. ’
CEB	1%20Kings	5	2	Chron 2:3 , 11-12 ; but cf
CEB	1%20Kings	5	3	“ You know that my father David wasn ’ t able to build a temple for the name of the Lord my God . This was because of the enemies that fought him on all sides until the Lord put them under the soles of his feet .
CEB	1%20Kings	5	4	Now the Lord my God has given me peace on every side , without enemies or misfortune .
CEB	1%20Kings	5	6	Now give the order and have the cedars of Lebanon cut down for me . My servants will work with your servants . I ’ ll pay your servants whatever price you set , because you know we have no one here who is skilled in cutting wood like the Sidonians. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	5	7	Hiram was thrilled when he heard Solomon ’ s message . He said , “ Today the Lord is blessed because he has given David a wise son who is in charge of this great people. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	5	8	Hiram sent word back to Solomon : “ I have heard your message to me . I will do as you wish with the cedar and pinewood .
CEB	1%20Kings	5	9	My servants will bring the wood down the Lebanon Mountains to the sea . I ’ ll make rafts out of them and float them on the sea to the place you specify . There I ’ ll dismantle them , and you can carry them away . Now , as for what you must do for me in return , I ask you to provide for my royal house. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	5	10	So Hiram gave Solomon all the cedar and pinewood that he wanted .
CEB	1%20Kings	5	11	In return , Solomon gave an annual gift to Hiram of twenty thousand kors [ c ] of wheat to eat , and twenty thousand kors of pure oil for his palace use .
CEB	1%20Kings	5	12	Now the Lord made Solomon wise , just as he had promised . Solomon and Hiram made a covenant and had peace .
CEB	1%20Kings	5	13	King Solomon called up a work gang of thirty thousand workers from all over Israel .
CEB	1%20Kings	5	14	He sent ten thousand to work in Lebanon each month . Then they would spend two months at home . Adoniram was in charge of the work gang .
CEB	1%20Kings	5	15	Solomon had 70,000 laborers and 80,000 stonecutters in the highlands .
CEB	1%20Kings	5	16	This doesn ’ t include Solomon ’ s 3,300 supervisors in charge of the work , who had oversight over the laborers .
CEB	1%20Kings	5	17	At the king ’ s command , they quarried huge stones of the finest quality in order to lay the temple ’ s foundation with carefully cut stone .
CEB	1%20Kings	5	18	The craftsmen of Solomon and Hiram , along with those of Byblos , prepared the timber and the stones for the construction of the temple . Footnotes -
CEB	1%20Kings	6	1	Kings 6:38 October–November , Heshvan ; Bul is a month in the Canaanite calendar .
CEB	1%20Kings	6	6	The lower walls were seven and a half feet wide . At the second floor the walls were nine feet wide , and at the third floor they were ten and a half feet wide . He made niches around the outside of the temple so the beams wouldn ’ t be inserted into the temple walls . [ c ]
CEB	1%20Kings	6	2	The temple that King Solomon built for the Lord was ninety feet long , thirty feet wide , and forty-five feet high .
CEB	1%20Kings	6	3	The porch in front of the temple ’ s main hall was thirty feet long . It ran across the whole width of the temple and extended fifteen feet in front of the temple .
CEB	1%20Kings	6	4	He made recessed and latticed windows [ b ] for the temple
CEB	1%20Kings	6	5	and built side rooms against the temple walls around both the main hall and the most holy place .
CEB	1%20Kings	6	7	When the temple was built , they did all the stonecutting at the quarry . No hammers , axes , or any iron tools were heard in the temple during its construction .
CEB	1%20Kings	6	8	The door to the stairs was at the south side of the temple . Winding stairs went up to the second floor and from there to the third floor .
CEB	1%20Kings	6	9	He completed the temple with a roof of cedar beams and cross-planks . [ d ]
CEB	1%20Kings	6	10	Then he built the side rooms all around the temple . They were seven and a half feet high . He attached them to the temple with cedarwood .
CEB	1%20Kings	6	11	The Lord ’ s word came to Solomon ,
CEB	1%20Kings	6	12	Regarding this temple that you are building : If you follow my laws , enact my regulations , and keep all my commands faithfully , then I will fulfill for you my promise that I made to your father David .
CEB	1%20Kings	6	13	I will live among the Israelites . I won ’ t abandon my people Israel .
CEB	1%20Kings	6	14	So Solomon constructed the temple and completed it .
CEB	1%20Kings	6	15	He built the walls within the temple with cedar planks , paneled from the floor to the ceiling . He overlaid the floor of the temple with pine planks .
CEB	1%20Kings	6	16	At the back of the temple he built thirty feet of cedar panels from the floor to the ceiling . Solomon built the inner sanctuary , the most holy place .
CEB	1%20Kings	6	17	In front of this , the main hall was sixty feet .
CEB	1%20Kings	6	18	The cedar inside the temple was carved with gourds and blossoming flowers . The whole thing was cedar . No stone was seen .
CEB	1%20Kings	6	19	He set up the inner sanctuary inside the temple so that he could put the chest containing the Lord ’ s covenant there .
CEB	1%20Kings	6	20	The inner sanctuary was thirty feet in length , width , and height . Solomon overlaid it with pure gold and covered the altar with cedar . [ e ]
CEB	1%20Kings	6	21	Solomon covered the temple ’ s interior with pure gold . He placed gold chains in front of the inner sanctuary and covered it with gold .
CEB	1%20Kings	6	22	He overlaid the whole temple inside with gold until the temple was completely covered . He covered the whole altar that was in the inner sanctuary with gold .
CEB	1%20Kings	6	23	He made two winged creatures of olive wood for the inner sanctuary , each fifteen feet high .
CEB	1%20Kings	6	24	The wings of the first winged creature were each seven and a half feet long . It was fifteen feet from the end of one wing to the end of the other .
CEB	1%20Kings	6	25	The second winged creature also measured fifteen feet . Both winged creatures had identical measurements and form .
CEB	1%20Kings	6	26	The height of both winged creatures was fifteen feet .
CEB	1%20Kings	6	27	Solomon placed the winged creatures inside the temple . Their wings spread out so that the wing of the one touched one wall and the wing of the other touched the other wall . In the middle of the temple , the wings of the two winged creatures touched each other .
CEB	1%20Kings	6	28	He covered the winged creatures with gold .
CEB	1%20Kings	6	29	Solomon carved all the walls of the temple—inner and outer rooms—with engravings of winged creatures , palm trees , and blossoming flowers .
CEB	1%20Kings	6	30	He also covered the floor of the temple with gold , in both the inner and the outer rooms .

CEB	1%20Kings	7	11	Above them were high-quality stones cut to measure , as well as cedar .
CEB	1%20Kings	7	12	The surrounding great courtyard had three rows of cut stones and a row of trimmed cedar just like the inner courtyard of the Lord ’ s temple and its porch . Solomon ’ s temple equipment

CEB	1%20Kings	7	14	Hiram ’ s mother was a widow from the tribe of Naphtali . His father was a Tyrian skilled in bronze work . He was amazingly skillful in the techniques and knowledge for doing all kinds of work in bronze . He came to King Solomon and did all his work .
CEB	1%20Kings	7	15	He [ b ] cast two bronze pillars . Each one was twenty-seven feet high and required a cord of eighteen feet to reach around it . [ c ]
CEB	1%20Kings	7	16	He made two capitals of cast bronze for the tops of the columns . They were each seven and a half feet high .
CEB	1%20Kings	7	17	He made an intricate network of chains for the capitals on top of the columns , seven for each capital .
CEB	1%20Kings	7	18	He made the pillars and two rows of pomegranates for each network to adorn each of the capitals .
CEB	1%20Kings	7	19	The capitals on top of the columns in the porch were made like lilies , each six feet high .
CEB	1%20Kings	7	20	Above the round-shaped part and next to the network were two hundred pomegranates . These were placed in rows around both of the capitals on top of the columns .
CEB	1%20Kings	7	21	He set up the columns at the temple ’ s porch . He named the south column Jachin . The north column he named Boaz .
CEB	1%20Kings	7	22	After putting the lily shapes on top of the columns , he was finished with the columns .
CEB	1%20Kings	7	23	He also made a tank of cast metal called the Sea . It was circular in shape , fifteen feet from rim to rim , seven and a half feet high , forty-five feet in circumference .
CEB	1%20Kings	7	24	Under the rim were two rows of gourds completely encircling it , ten every eighteen inches , each cast in its mold .
CEB	1%20Kings	7	25	The Sea rested on twelve oxen with their backs toward the center , three facing north , three facing west , three facing south , and three facing east .
CEB	1%20Kings	7	26	The Sea was as thick as the width of a hand . Its rim was shaped like a cup or an open lily blossom . It could hold two thousand baths . [ d ]
CEB	1%20Kings	7	27	He also made ten bronze stands . Each was six feet long , six feet wide , and four and a half feet high .
CEB	1%20Kings	7	28	This is how each stand was made : There were panels connected between the legs .
CEB	1%20Kings	7	29	Lions , bulls , and winged otherworldly creatures appeared on the panels between the legs . On the legs above and below the lions and bulls were wreaths on panels hanging off the stands .
CEB	1%20Kings	7	30	There were four bronze wheels with bronze axles for each stand . There were four feet and supports cast for each basin with wreaths on their sides . [ e ]
CEB	1%20Kings	7	31	Inside the bowl was an opening eighteen inches deep . The opening was round , measuring twenty-seven inches , with engravings . The panels of the stands were square rather than round .
CEB	1%20Kings	7	32	There were four wheels beneath the panels . The axles of the wheels were attached to the stand . Each wheel was twenty-seven inches in height .
CEB	1%20Kings	7	33	The construction of the wheels resembled chariot wheels . The axles , rims , spokes , and hubs were all made of cast metal .
CEB	1%20Kings	7	34	There was a handle on each of the four corners of every stand , projecting from the side of the stand .
CEB	1%20Kings	7	35	The top of the stand had a band running around the perimeter that was nine inches deep . The stand had its own supports and panels .
CEB	1%20Kings	7	36	On the surfaces of the supports and panels he carved winged otherworldly creatures , lions , and palm trees with wreaths everywhere . [ f ]
CEB	1%20Kings	7	37	In this manner he made ten stands , each one cast in a single mold of the same size and shape .
CEB	1%20Kings	7	38	He made ten bronze washbasins , each able to hold forty baths . [ g ] Every washbasin was six feet across , and there was one for each of the ten stands .
CEB	1%20Kings	7	39	He placed five stands on the south of the temple and five on the north of the temple . He placed the Sea at the southeast corner of the temple .
CEB	1%20Kings	7	40	Hiram made the basins , shovels , and bowls . And so Hiram finished his work on the Lord ’ s temple for King Solomon :
CEB	1%20Kings	7	41	two columns ; two circular capitals on top of the columns ; two networks , adorning the two circular capitals on top of the columns ;
CEB	1%20Kings	7	42	four hundred pomegranates for the two networks , with two rows of pomegranates for each network that adorned the two circular capitals on top of the columns ;
CEB	1%20Kings	7	43	ten stands with ten basins on them ;
CEB	1%20Kings	7	44	one Sea ; twelve oxen beneath the Sea ;
CEB	1%20Kings	7	45	and the pots , shovels , and bowls . All the equipment that Hiram made for King Solomon for the Lord ’ s temple was made from polished bronze .
CEB	1%20Kings	7	46	The king cast it in clay molds in the Jordan Valley between Succoth and Zarethan .
CEB	1%20Kings	7	47	Due to the very large number of objects , Solomon didn ’ t even try to weigh the bronze .
CEB	1%20Kings	7	48	Solomon also made all the equipment for the Lord ’ s temple : the gold altar ; the gold table for the bread of the presence ;
CEB	1%20Kings	7	49	the lampstands of pure gold , five on the right and five on the left in front of the inner sanctuary ; the flowers , the lamps , and the tongs of gold ;
CEB	1%20Kings	7	50	the cups , wick trimmers , bowls , ladles , and censers of pure gold ; and the gold sockets for the doors to the most holy place and for the doors to the main hall .
CEB	1%20Kings	7	51	When all King Solomon ’ s work on the Lord ’ s temple was finished , he brought the silver , gold , and all the objects his father David had dedicated and put them in the treasuries of the Lord ’ s temple . Footnotes -

CEB	1%20Kings	8	3	When all of Israel ’ s elders had arrived , the priests picked up the chest .
CEB	1%20Kings	8	4	They brought the Lord ’ s chest , the meeting tent , and all the holy equipment that was in the tent . The priests and the Levites brought them up ,
CEB	1%20Kings	8	5	while King Solomon and the entire Israelite assembly that had joined him before the chest sacrificed countless sheep and oxen .
CEB	1%20Kings	8	6	The priests brought the chest containing the Lord ’ s covenant to its designated spot beneath the wings of the winged creatures in the inner sanctuary of the temple , the most holy place .
CEB	1%20Kings	8	7	The winged creatures spread their wings over the place where the chest rested , covering the chest and its carrying poles .
CEB	1%20Kings	8	9	Nothing was in the chest except the two stone tablets Moses had placed there while at Horeb , where the Lord made a covenant with the Israelites after they left Egypt .
CEB	1%20Kings	8	10	When the priests left the holy place , the cloud filled the Lord ’ s temple ,
CEB	1%20Kings	8	11	and the priests were unable to carry out their duties due to the cloud because the Lord ’ s glory filled the Lord ’ s temple .
CEB	1%20Kings	8	12	Then Solomon said , “ The Lord said that he would live in a dark cloud ,
CEB	1%20Kings	8	13	but I have indeed built you a lofty temple as a place where you can live forever. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	8	14	The king turned around , and while the entire assembly of Israel was standing there , he blessed them ,
CEB	1%20Kings	8	15	saying , “ Bless Israel ’ s God , the Lord , who spoke directly to my father David and now has kept his promise :
CEB	1%20Kings	8	16	‘ From the day I brought my people Israel out of Egypt I haven ’ t selected a city from any Israelite tribe as a site for the building of a temple for my name . But now I have chosen David to be over my people Israel. ’
CEB	1%20Kings	8	17	My father David wanted to build a temple for the name of the Lord , Israel ’ s God .
CEB	1%20Kings	8	18	“ But the Lord said to my father David , ‘ It is very good that you thought to build a temple for my name .
CEB	1%20Kings	8	19	Nevertheless , you yourself won ’ t build that temple . Instead , your very own son will build the temple for my name. ’
CEB	1%20Kings	8	20	The Lord has kept his promise—I have succeeded my father David on Israel ’ s throne just as the Lord said , and I have built the temple for the name of the Lord , Israel ’ s God .
CEB	1%20Kings	8	21	There I ’ ve placed the chest that contains the covenant that the Lord made with our ancestors when he brought them out of Egypt. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	8	22	Solomon stood before the Lord ’ s altar in front of the entire Israelite assembly and , spreading out his hands toward the sky ,
CEB	1%20Kings	8	23	he said : Lord God of Israel , there ’ s no god like you in heaven above or on earth below . You keep the covenant and show loyalty to your servants who walk before you with all their heart .
CEB	1%20Kings	8	24	This is the covenant you kept with your servant David , my father , which you promised him . Today , you have fulfilled what you promised .
CEB	1%20Kings	8	25	So now , Lord , Israel ’ s God , keep what you promised my father David , your servant , when you said to him , “ You will never fail to have a successor sitting on Israel ’ s throne as long as your descendants carefully walk before me just as you walked before me. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	8	26	So now , God of Israel , may your promise to your servant David , my father , come true .
CEB	1%20Kings	8	27	But how could God possibly live on earth ? If heaven , even the highest heaven , can ’ t contain you , how can this temple that I ’ ve built contain you ?
CEB	1%20Kings	8	28	Lord my God , listen to your servant ’ s prayer and request , and hear the cry and prayer that your servant prays to you today .
CEB	1%20Kings	8	29	Constantly watch over this temple , the place about which you said , “ My name will be there , ” and listen to the prayer that your servant is praying toward [ b ] this place .
CEB	1%20Kings	8	30	Listen to the request of your servant and your people Israel when they pray toward this place . Listen from your heavenly dwelling place , and when you hear , forgive !
CEB	1%20Kings	8	31	If someone wrongs another and must make a solemn pledge asserting innocence before your altar in this temple , [ c ]
CEB	1%20Kings	8	32	then listen from heaven , act , and decide which of your servants is right . Condemn the guilty party , repaying them for their conduct , but justify the innocent person , repaying them for their righteousness .
CEB	1%20Kings	8	33	If your people Israel are defeated by an enemy because they have sinned against you , but then they change their hearts and lives , give thanks to your name , and ask for mercy before you at this temple ,
CEB	1%20Kings	8	34	then listen from heaven and forgive the sin of your people Israel . Return them to the land you gave their ancestors .
CEB	1%20Kings	8	35	When the sky holds back its rain because Israel has sinned against you , but they then pray toward this place , give thanks to your name , and turn away from their sin because you have punished them for it , [ d ]
CEB	1%20Kings	8	36	then listen from heaven and forgive the sin of your servants , your people Israel . Teach them the best way for them to follow , and send rain on your land that you gave to your people as an inheritance .
CEB	1%20Kings	8	37	Whenever there is a famine or plague in the land ; or whenever there is blight , mildew , locust , or grasshopper ; or whenever someone ’ s enemy attacks them in their cities ; [ e ] or any plague or illness comes ;
CEB	1%20Kings	8	38	whatever prayer or petition is made by any individual or by all of your people Israel—because people will recognize their own pain and spread out their hands toward this temple—
CEB	1%20Kings	8	39	then listen from heaven where you live . Forgive , act , and repay each person according to all their conduct , because you know their hearts . You alone know the human heart .
CEB	1%20Kings	8	40	Do this so that they may revere you all the days they live on the land that you gave to our ancestors .
CEB	1%20Kings	8	41	Listen also to the immigrant who isn ’ t from your people Israel but who comes from a distant country because of your reputation—
CEB	1%20Kings	8	42	because they will hear of your great reputation , your great power , and your outstretched arm . When the immigrant comes and prays toward this temple ,
CEB	1%20Kings	8	43	then listen from heaven , where you live , and do everything the immigrant asks . Do this so that all the people of the earth may know your reputation and revere you , as your people Israel do , and recognize that this temple I have built bears your name .
CEB	1%20Kings	8	44	When your people go to war against their enemies , wherever you may send them , and they pray to the Lord toward the city you have chosen and toward this temple that I have built for your name ,
CEB	1%20Kings	8	45	then listen from heaven to their prayer and request and do what is right for them .
CEB	1%20Kings	8	46	When they sin against you ( for there is no one who doesn ’ t sin ) and you become angry with them and hand them over to an enemy who takes them away as prisoners to enemy territory , whether distant or nearby ,
CEB	1%20Kings	8	47	if they change their heart in whatever land they are held captive , changing their lives and begging for your mercy , [ f ] saying , “ We have sinned , we have done wrong , we have acted wickedly ! ”
CEB	1%20Kings	8	48	and if they return to you with all their heart and all their being in the enemy territory where they ’ ve been taken captive , and pray to you , toward their land , which you gave their ancestors , toward the city you have chosen , and toward the temple I have built for your name ,
CEB	1%20Kings	8	49	then listen to their prayer and request from your heavenly dwelling place . Do what is right for them ,
CEB	1%20Kings	8	50	and forgive your people who have sinned against you . Forgive all their wrong that they have done against you . See to it that those who captured them show them mercy .
CEB	1%20Kings	8	51	These are your people and your inheritance . You brought them out of Egypt , from the iron furnace .
CEB	1%20Kings	8	52	Open your eyes to your servant ’ s request and to the request of your people Israel . Hear them whenever they cry out to you .
CEB	1%20Kings	8	53	You set them apart from all the earth ’ s peoples as your own inheritance , Lord , just as you promised through your servant Moses when you brought our ancestors out of Egypt .
CEB	1%20Kings	8	54	As soon as Solomon finished praying and making these requests to the Lord , he got up from before the Lord ’ s altar , where he had been kneeling with his hands spread out to heaven .
CEB	1%20Kings	8	55	He stood up and blessed the whole Israelite assembly in a loud voice :
CEB	1%20Kings	8	56	“ May the Lord be blessed ! He has given rest to his people Israel just as he promised . He hasn ’ t neglected any part of the good promise he made through his servant Moses .
CEB	1%20Kings	8	57	May the Lord our God be with us , just as he was with our ancestors . May he never leave us or abandon us .
CEB	1%20Kings	8	58	May he draw our hearts to him to walk in all his ways and observe his commands , his laws , and his judgments that he gave our ancestors .
CEB	1%20Kings	8	59	And may these words of mine that I have cried out before the Lord remain near to the Lord our God day and night so that he may do right by his servant and his people Israel for each day ’ s need ,
CEB	1%20Kings	8	60	and so that all the earth ’ s peoples may know that the Lord is God . There is no other God !
CEB	1%20Kings	8	61	Now may you be committed to the Lord our God with all your heart by following his laws and observing his commands , just as you are doing right now. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	8	62	Then the king and all Israel with him sacrificed to the Lord .
CEB	1%20Kings	8	63	Solomon offered well-being sacrifices to the Lord : twenty-two thousand oxen and one hundred twenty thousand sheep when the king and all Israel dedicated the Lord ’ s temple .
CEB	1%20Kings	8	64	On that day the king made holy the middle of the courtyard in front of the Lord ’ s temple . He had to offer the entirely burned offerings , grain offerings , and the fat of well-being sacrifices there , because the bronze altar that was in the Lord ’ s presence was too small to contain the entirely burned offerings , the grain offerings , and the fat of the well-being sacrifices .
CEB	1%20Kings	8	65	At that time Solomon , together with all Israel , held a celebration . It was a large assembly from Lebo-hamath to the border of Egypt . They celebrated for seven days and then for another seven days in the presence of the Lord our God : fourteen days in all .
CEB	1%20Kings	8	66	On the eighth day , [ g ] Solomon dismissed the people . They blessed the king and went back to their tents happy and pleased about all the good that the Lord had done for his servant David and for his people Israel . Footnotes -

CEB	1%20Kings	9	2	the Lord appeared to him a second time in the same way he had appeared to him at Gibeon .
CEB	1%20Kings	9	3	The Lord said to him , “ I have heard your prayer and your cry to me . I have set apart this temple that you built , to put my name there forever . My eyes and my heart will always be there .
CEB	1%20Kings	9	4	As for you , if you walk before me just as your father David did , with complete dedication and honesty , and if you do all that I have commanded , and keep my regulations and case laws ,
CEB	1%20Kings	9	5	then I will establish your royal throne over Israel forever , just as I promised your father David , ‘ You will never fail to have a successor on the throne of Israel. ’
CEB	1%20Kings	9	6	However , if you or your sons turn away from following me and don ’ t observe the commands and regulations that I gave you , and go to serve other gods , and worship them ,
CEB	1%20Kings	9	7	then I will remove Israel from the land I gave them and I will reject the temple that I dedicated for my name . Israel will become a joke , insulted by everyone .
CEB	1%20Kings	9	8	Everyone who passes by this temple , so lofty now , [ a ] will be shocked and will whistle , wondering , Why has the Lord done such a thing to this land and this temple ?
CEB	1%20Kings	9	10	It took twenty years for Solomon to build the two structures , the Lord ’ s temple and the royal palace .
CEB	1%20Kings	9	11	King Hiram of Tyre gave Solomon all the cedar , pinewood , and gold that he wanted . Then King Solomon gave Hiram twenty towns in the region of Galilee .
CEB	1%20Kings	9	12	Hiram went from Tyre to inspect the towns Solomon had given him . They didn ’ t seem adequate in his view .
CEB	1%20Kings	9	13	So Hiram remarked , “ My brother , are these towns you ’ ve given me good for anything ? ” The cities are thus called the land of Cabul to this very day .
CEB	1%20Kings	9	14	But Hiram sent the king one hundred twenty gold kikkars , nevertheless .
CEB	1%20Kings	9	15	This is the story of the labor gang that King Solomon put together to build the Lord ’ s temple and his own palace , as well as the stepped structure , the wall of Jerusalem , Hazor , Megiddo , and Gezer : (
CEB	1%20Kings	9	16	Pharaoh , Egypt ’ s king , had attacked and captured Gezer , setting it on fire . He killed the Canaanites who lived in the city and gave it as a dowry to his daughter , Solomon ’ s wife . )
CEB	1%20Kings	9	17	Solomon built Gezer , Lower Beth-horon ,
CEB	1%20Kings	9	18	Baalath , and Tamar in the wilderness ( within the land ) ,
CEB	1%20Kings	9	19	along with all the storage cities that belonged to Solomon , as well as the cities used for storing chariots and cavalry and whatever he wanted to build in Jerusalem , Lebanon , and throughout his kingdom .
CEB	1%20Kings	9	20	Any non-Israelite people who remained of the Amorites , Hittites , Perizzites , Hivites , and Jebusites—
CEB	1%20Kings	9	21	that is , the descendants of such people who were still in the land because the Israelites weren ’ t able to wipe them out—Solomon forced into the labor gangs that are still in existence today .
CEB	1%20Kings	9	22	However , Solomon didn ’ t force the Israelites to work as slaves ; instead , they became warriors , his servants , his leaders , his officers , and those in charge of his chariots and cavalry .
CEB	1%20Kings	9	23	These were the chief officers over Solomon ’ s work : five hundred fifty had charge of the people who did the work .
CEB	1%20Kings	9	24	When Pharaoh ’ s daughter went up from David ’ s City to the palace he had built for her , Solomon built the stepped structure .
CEB	1%20Kings	9	25	Three times a year Solomon would offer entirely burned offerings and well-being sacrifices on the altar that he had built for the Lord . Along with this he would burn incense to the Lord . In this way , he completed the temple . [ b ]

CEB	1%20Kings	10	2	Accompanying her to Jerusalem was a huge entourage with camels carrying spices , a large amount of gold , and precious stones . After she arrived , she told Solomon everything that was on her mind .
CEB	1%20Kings	10	3	Solomon answered all her questions ; nothing was too difficult for him to answer .
CEB	1%20Kings	10	4	When the queen of Sheba saw how wise Solomon was , the palace he had built ,
CEB	1%20Kings	10	5	the food on his table , the servants ’ quarters , the function and dress of his attendants , his cupbearers , and the entirely burned offerings that he offered at the Lord ’ s temple , it took her breath away .
CEB	1%20Kings	10	6	“ The report I heard about your deeds and wisdom when I was still at home is true , ” she said to the king .
CEB	1%20Kings	10	7	“ I didn ’ t believe it until I came and saw it with my own eyes . In fact , the half of it wasn ’ t even told to me ! You have far more wisdom and wealth than I was told .

CEB	1%20Kings	10	11	Hiram ’ s fleet went to Ophir and brought back gold , much almug wood , and precious stones .
CEB	1%20Kings	10	12	The king used the almug wood to make parapets for the Lord ’ s temple and for the royal palace as well as lyres and harps for the musicians . To this day , that much almug wood hasn ’ t come into or been seen in Israel .

CEB	1%20Kings	10	21	All of King Solomon ’ s drinking cups were made of gold , and all the items in the Forest of Lebanon Palace were made of pure gold , not silver , since even silver wasn ’ t considered good enough in Solomon ’ s time !
CEB	1%20Kings	10	22	The royal fleet of Tarshish-style ships was at sea with Hiram ’ s fleet , returning once every three years with gold , silver , ivory , monkeys , and peacocks . [ d ]
CEB	1%20Kings	10	23	King Solomon far exceeded all the earth ’ s kings in wealth and wisdom ,
CEB	1%20Kings	10	24	and so the whole earth wanted an audience with Solomon in order to hear his God-given wisdom .
CEB	1%20Kings	10	25	Year after year they came with tribute : objects of silver and gold , clothing , weapons , spices , horses , and mules .

CEB	1%20Kings	10	27	In Jerusalem , the king made silver as common as stones and cedar as plentiful as sycamore trees that grow in the foothills .
CEB	1%20Kings	10	28	Solomon ’ s horses were imported from Egypt and Kue , purchased from Kue by the king ’ s agents at the going price .
CEB	1%20Kings	10	29	They would import a chariot from Egypt for six hundred pieces of silver and a horse for one hundred fifty , and then export them to all the Hittite and Aramean kings . Footnotes -
CEB	1%20Kings	11	1	Kings 11:33 LXX , Syr , Vulg he has abandoned me
CEB	1%20Kings	11	11	The Lord said to Solomon , “ Because you have done all this instead of keeping my covenant and my laws that I commanded you , I will most certainly tear the kingdom from you and give it to your servant .
CEB	1%20Kings	11	2	These came from the nations that the Lord had commanded the Israelites about : “ Don ’ t intermarry with them . They will definitely turn your heart toward their gods. ” Solomon clung to these women in love .
CEB	1%20Kings	11	3	He had seven hundred royal wives and three hundred secondary wives . They turned his heart .
CEB	1%20Kings	11	4	As Solomon grew old , his wives turned his heart after other gods . He wasn ’ t committed to the Lord his God with all his heart as was his father David .
CEB	1%20Kings	11	5	Solomon followed Astarte the goddess of the Sidonians , and Milcom the detestable god of the Ammonites .
CEB	1%20Kings	11	6	Solomon did what was evil in the Lord ’ s eyes and wasn ’ t completely devoted to the Lord like his father David .
CEB	1%20Kings	11	7	On the hill east of Jerusalem , Solomon built a shrine to Chemosh the detestable god of Moab , and to Molech the detestable god of the Ammonites .
CEB	1%20Kings	11	8	He did the same for all his foreign wives , who burned incense and sacrificed to their gods .
CEB	1%20Kings	11	9	The Lord grew angry with Solomon , because his heart had turned away from being with the Lord , the God of Israel , who had appeared to him twice .
CEB	1%20Kings	11	10	The Lord had commanded Solomon about this very thing , that he shouldn ’ t follow other gods . But Solomon didn ’ t do what the Lord commanded .
CEB	1%20Kings	11	12	Even so , on account of your father David , I won ’ t do it during your lifetime . I will tear the kingdom out of your son ’ s hands .
CEB	1%20Kings	11	13	Moreover , I won ’ t tear away the entire kingdom . I will give one tribe to your son on account of my servant David and on account of Jerusalem , which I have chosen. ” Solomon and Hadad
CEB	1%20Kings	11	14	So the Lord raised up an opponent for Solomon : Hadad the Edomite from the royal line of Edom .
CEB	1%20Kings	11	15	When David was fighting against Edom , Joab the general had gone up to bury the Israelite dead , and he had killed every male in Edom .
CEB	1%20Kings	11	16	Joab and all the Israelites stayed there six months , until he had finished off every male in Edom .
CEB	1%20Kings	11	17	While still a youth , Hadad escaped to Egypt along with his father ’ s Edomite officials .
CEB	1%20Kings	11	18	They set out from Midian and went to Paran . They took men with them from Paran and came to Egypt and to Pharaoh its king . Pharaoh assigned him a home , food , and land .
CEB	1%20Kings	11	19	Pharaoh was so delighted with Hadad that he gave him one of his wife ’ s sisters for marriage , a sister of Queen Tahpenes .
CEB	1%20Kings	11	20	This sister of Tahpenes bore Hadad a son , Genubath . Tahpenes weaned him in Pharaoh ’ s house . So it was that Genubath was raised in Pharaoh ’ s house , among Pharaoh ’ s children .
CEB	1%20Kings	11	21	While in Egypt , Hadad heard that David had lain down with his ancestors and that Joab the general was also dead . Hadad said to Pharaoh , “ Let me go to my homeland. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	11	22	Pharaoh said to him , “ What do you lack here with me that would make you want to go back to your homeland ? ” Hadad said , “ Nothing , but please let me go ! ” Solomon and Rezon
CEB	1%20Kings	11	23	God raised up another opponent for Solomon : Rezon , Eliada ’ s son , who had escaped from Zobah ’ s King Hadadezer .
CEB	1%20Kings	11	24	Rezon recruited men and became leader of a band when David was killing them . They went to Damascus , stayed there , and ruled it .
CEB	1%20Kings	11	25	Throughout Solomon ’ s lifetime , Rezon was Israel ’ s opponent and added to the problems caused by Hadad . Rezon hated Israel while he ruled as king of Aram . Solomon and Jeroboam
CEB	1%20Kings	11	26	Now Nebat ’ s son Jeroboam was an Ephraimite from Zeredah . His mother ’ s name was Zeruah ; she was a widow . Although he was one of Solomon ’ s own officials , Jeroboam fought against the king .
CEB	1%20Kings	11	27	This is the story of why Jeroboam fought against the king : Solomon had built the stepped structure and repaired the broken wall in his father David ’ s City .
CEB	1%20Kings	11	28	Now Jeroboam was a strong and honorable man . Solomon saw how well this youth did his work . So he appointed him over all the work gang of Joseph ’ s house .
CEB	1%20Kings	11	29	At that time , when Jeroboam left Jerusalem , Ahijah the prophet of Shiloh met him along the way . Ahijah was wearing a new garment . The two of them were alone in the country .
CEB	1%20Kings	11	30	Ahijah tore his new garment into twelve pieces .
CEB	1%20Kings	11	31	He said to Jeroboam , “ Take ten pieces , because Israel ’ s God , the Lord , has said , ‘ Look , I am about to tear the kingdom from Solomon ’ s hand . I will give you ten tribes .
CEB	1%20Kings	11	32	But I will leave him one tribe on account of my servant David and on account of Jerusalem , the city I have chosen from all the tribes of Israel .
CEB	1%20Kings	11	33	I am doing this because they have abandoned me [ a ] and worshipped the Sidonian goddess Astarte , the Moabite god Chemosh , and the Ammonite god Milcom . They haven ’ t walked in my ways by doing what is right in my eyes—keeping my laws and judgments—as Solomon ’ s father David did .
CEB	1%20Kings	11	34	But I won ’ t take the whole kingdom from his hand . I will keep him as ruler throughout his lifetime on account of my servant David , who did keep my commands and my laws .
CEB	1%20Kings	11	35	I will take the kingdom from the hand of Solomon ’ s son , and I will give you ten tribes .
CEB	1%20Kings	11	36	I will give his son a single tribe so that my servant David will always have a lamp before me in Jerusalem , the city that I chose for myself to place my name .
CEB	1%20Kings	11	37	But I will accept you , and you will rule over all that you could desire . You will be king of Israel .
CEB	1%20Kings	11	38	If you listen to all that I command and walk in my ways , if you do what is right in my eyes , keeping my laws and my commands just as my servant David did , then I will be with you and I will build you a lasting dynasty just as I did for David . I will give you Israel .
CEB	1%20Kings	11	39	I will humble David ’ s descendants by means of all this , though not forever. ’ ”
CEB	1%20Kings	11	40	Then Solomon tried to kill Jeroboam . But Jeroboam fled to Egypt and its king Shishak . Jeroboam remained in Egypt until Solomon died . Solomon ’ s remaining days
CEB	1%20Kings	11	41	The rest of Solomon ’ s deeds , including all that he did and all his wisdom , aren ’ t they written in the official records of Solomon ?
CEB	1%20Kings	11	42	The amount of time Solomon ruled over all Israel in Jerusalem was forty years .
CEB	1%20Kings	11	43	Then Solomon lay down with his ancestors . He was buried in his father David ’ s City , and Rehoboam his son succeeded him as king . Footnotes -
CEB	1%20Kings	12	1	Kings 12:33 Or went up on the altar to burn incense
CEB	1%20Kings	12	12	Jeroboam and all the people returned to Rehoboam on the third day , just as the king had specified when he said , “ Come back to me in three days. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	12	2	When Jeroboam , Nebat ’ s son , heard the news , he returned from Egypt where he had fled from King Solomon .
CEB	1%20Kings	12	3	The people sent and called for Jeroboam , who along with the entire Israelite assembly went and said to Rehoboam ,
CEB	1%20Kings	12	4	“ Your father made our workload [ a ] very hard for us . If you will lessen the demands your father made of us and lighten the heavy workload he demanded from us , then we will serve you. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	12	5	He answered them , “ Come back in three days. ” So the people left .
CEB	1%20Kings	12	6	King Rehoboam consulted the elders who had served his father Solomon when he was alive . “ What do you advise ? ” Rehoboam asked . “ How should I respond to these people ? ”
CEB	1%20Kings	12	7	“ If you will be a servant to this people by answering them and speaking good words today , ” they replied , “ then they will be your servants forever. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	12	8	But Rehoboam ignored the advice the elders gave him and instead sought the counsel of the young advisors who had grown up with him and now served him .
CEB	1%20Kings	12	9	“ What do you advise ? ” he asked them . “ How should we respond to these people who have said to me , ‘ Lighten the workload your father demanded of us ’ ? ”
CEB	1%20Kings	12	10	The young people who had grown up with him said to him , “ This people said to you , ‘ Your father made our workload heavy ; lighten it for us ! ’ Now this is what you should say to them : ‘ My baby finger [ b ] is thicker than my father ’ s entire waist !
CEB	1%20Kings	12	11	So if my father made your workload heavy , I ’ ll make it even heavier ! If my father disciplined you with whips , I ’ ll do it with scorpions ! ’ ”
CEB	1%20Kings	12	13	The king then answered the people harshly . He ignored the elders ’ advice
CEB	1%20Kings	12	14	and instead followed the young people ’ s advice . He said , “ My father made your workload heavy , but I ’ ll make it even heavier ! My father disciplined you with whips , but I ’ ll do it with scorpions ! ”
CEB	1%20Kings	12	15	The king didn ’ t listen to the people because this turn of events came from the Lord so that he might keep the promise he delivered through Ahijah from Shiloh concerning Jeroboam , Nebat ’ s son .
CEB	1%20Kings	12	16	When all Israel saw that the king wouldn ’ t listen to them , the people answered the king : “ Why should we care about David ? We have no stake in Jesse ’ s son ! Go back to your homes , Israel ! You better look after your own house now , David ! ” Then the Israelites went back to their homes ,
CEB	1%20Kings	12	17	and Rehoboam ruled over only the Israelites who lived in the cities of Judah .
CEB	1%20Kings	12	18	When King Rehoboam sent Adoram to them ( he was the leader of the work gang ) , all Israel stoned him to death . King Rehoboam quickly got into his chariot and fled to Jerusalem .
CEB	1%20Kings	12	19	Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day .
CEB	1%20Kings	12	20	When all Israel heard that Jeroboam had returned , they sent for him . They called him to the assembly and crowned him king of all Israel . Nothing was left to the house of David except the tribe of Judah .
CEB	1%20Kings	12	21	When Rehoboam arrived at Jerusalem , he assembled the whole house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin—one hundred eighty thousand select warriors—to fight against the house of Israel and restore the kingdom for Rehoboam , Solomon ’ s son .
CEB	1%20Kings	12	22	But God ’ s word came to Shemaiah the man of God ,
CEB	1%20Kings	12	23	“ Tell Judah ’ s King Rehoboam , Solomon ’ s son , and all the house of Judah and Benjamin , and the rest of the people ,
CEB	1%20Kings	12	24	‘ This is what the Lord says : Don ’ t make war against your relatives the Israelites . Go home , every one of you , because this is my plan. ’ ” When they heard the Lord ’ s words , they went back home , just as the Lord had said . Jeroboam I and the shrines
CEB	1%20Kings	12	25	Jeroboam fortified Shechem at Mount Ephraim and lived there . From there he also fortified Penuel .
CEB	1%20Kings	12	26	Jeroboam thought to himself , The kingdom is in danger of reverting to the house of David .
CEB	1%20Kings	12	27	If these people continue to sacrifice at the Lord ’ s temple in Jerusalem , they will again become loyal to their master Rehoboam , Judah ’ s king , and they will kill me so they can return to Judah ’ s King Rehoboam .
CEB	1%20Kings	12	28	So the king asked for advice and then made two gold calves . He said to the people , “ It ’ s too far for you to go all the way up to Jerusalem . Look , Israel ! Here are your gods who brought you out from the land of Egypt. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	12	29	He put one calf in Bethel , and the other he placed in Dan .
CEB	1%20Kings	12	30	This act was sinful . The people went to worship before the one calf at Bethel and before the other one as far as Dan . [ c ]
CEB	1%20Kings	12	31	Jeroboam made shrines on the high places and appointed priests from all sorts of people , but none were Levites .
CEB	1%20Kings	12	32	Jeroboam set a date for a celebration on the fifteenth day of the eighth month . [ d ] It was just like the celebration in Judah . He sacrificed on the altar . At Bethel he sacrificed to the calves he had made . There also he installed the priests for the shrines he had made .
CEB	1%20Kings	12	33	On the fifteenth day of the eighth month—the time he alone had decided—Jeroboam went up [ e ] to the altar he had built in Bethel . He made a celebration for the Israelites and offered sacrifices on the altar by burning them up . [ f ] Footnotes -
CEB	1%20Kings	13	1	Kings
CEB	1%20Kings	13	13	The old prophet said to his sons , “ Saddle my donkey. ” So they saddled his donkey , and he got on it .
CEB	1%20Kings	13	2	By the Lord ’ s word , the man of God cried out to the altar : “ Altar ! Altar ! The Lord says this : Look ! A son will be born to the house of David . His name will be Josiah . He will sacrifice on you , Altar , the very priests of the shrines who offer incense on you . They will burn human bones on you. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	13	3	At that time the man of God gave a sign : “ This is the sign that the Lord mentioned : ‘ Look ! The altar will be broken apart , and its ashes will spill out. ’ ”
CEB	1%20Kings	13	4	When the king heard the word of the man of God and how he cried out to the altar at Bethel , Jeroboam stretched his hand from the altar and said , “ Seize him ! ” But the hand that Jeroboam stretched out against the man of God grew stiff . Jeroboam wasn ’ t able to bend it back to himself .
CEB	1%20Kings	13	5	The altar broke apart , and the ashes spilled out from the altar , just like the sign that the man of God gave by the Lord ’ s word .
CEB	1%20Kings	13	6	The king said to the man of God , “ Plead before the Lord your God and pray for me so that I can bend my hand back again. ” So the man of God pleaded before the Lord , and the king ’ s hand returned to normal and was like it used to be .
CEB	1%20Kings	13	7	The king spoke to the man of God : “ Come with me to the palace and refresh yourself . Let me give you a gift. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	13	8	The man of God said to the king , “ Even if you gave me half your palace , I wouldn ’ t go with you , nor would I eat food or drink water in this place .
CEB	1%20Kings	13	9	This is what God commanded me by the Lord ’ s word : Don ’ t eat food ! Don ’ t drink water ! Don ’ t return by the way you came ! ”
CEB	1%20Kings	13	10	So the man of God went by a different way . He didn ’ t return by the way he came to Bethel .
CEB	1%20Kings	13	11	Now there was an old prophet living in Bethel . His sons came and told him everything that the man of God had done that day at Bethel . They also told their father the words that he spoke to the king .
CEB	1%20Kings	13	12	“ Which way did he go ? ” their father asked them . His sons had seen the way the man of God went when he came from Judah .
CEB	1%20Kings	13	14	He went after the man of God and found him sitting underneath a terebinth tree . He said to him , “ Are you the man of God who came from Judah ? ” “ I am , ” he replied .
CEB	1%20Kings	13	15	The old prophet then said to him , “ Come home with me and eat some food. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	13	16	But the man of God answered , “ I can ’ t return or go with you , and I can ’ t eat food or drink water with you in this place
CEB	1%20Kings	13	17	because of the message that came to me from the Lord ’ s word : Don ’ t eat food ! Don ’ t drink water ! Don ’ t return by the way you came ! ”
CEB	1%20Kings	13	18	The old prophet said to the man of God , “ I ’ m also a prophet like you . A messenger spoke to me with the Lord ’ s word , ‘ Bring him back with you to your house so that he may eat food and drink water. ’ ” But the old prophet was lying to him .
CEB	1%20Kings	13	19	So the man of God went back with the old prophet . He ate food in his home and drank water .
CEB	1%20Kings	13	20	Then as they were sitting at the table , the Lord ’ s word came to the prophet who had brought him back .
CEB	1%20Kings	13	21	He cried out to the man of God who had come from Judah : “ The Lord says this : You rebelled against the Lord ’ s word ! You didn ’ t keep the command that the Lord your God gave you !
CEB	1%20Kings	13	22	You came back and ate food and drank water in this place . “ But he had commanded you : ‘ Don ’ t eat food ! Don ’ t drink water ! ’ Now your body won ’ t go to the grave of your ancestors. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	13	23	After he ate food and drank , the old prophet saddled the donkey for the prophet he had brought back .
CEB	1%20Kings	13	24	The man of God departed , and a lion found him on the road and killed him . His body was thrown down on the road . The donkey stood beside it , and the lion also stood beside the body .
CEB	1%20Kings	13	25	Some people were traveling nearby , and they discovered the body thrown down on the road and the lion standing beside it . They entered the town where the old prophet lived and were talking about it .
CEB	1%20Kings	13	26	The prophet who brought the man of God back from the road overheard . He thought : That ’ s the man of God who rebelled against the Lord ’ s command . The Lord has given him to that lion that tore him apart , killing him in agreement with the Lord ’ s word that was spoken to him .
CEB	1%20Kings	13	27	The old prophet told his sons , “ Saddle the donkey. ” They did so ,
CEB	1%20Kings	13	28	and he went and found the body thrown down on the road . The donkey and the lion were still standing beside the body . The lion hadn ’ t eaten the body , nor had it torn the donkey apart .
CEB	1%20Kings	13	29	The prophet lifted the body of the man of God and put it on the donkey . He brought it back , arriving in the old prophet ’ s town to mourn and bury the man of God .
CEB	1%20Kings	13	30	He placed the body in his own grave , and they mourned over him , “ Oh , my brother ! ”
CEB	1%20Kings	13	31	After the old prophet buried him , he said to his sons , “ When I die , bury me in the grave where the man of God is . Put my bones beside his bones .
CEB	1%20Kings	13	32	The message he gave by the Lord ’ s word concerning the altar of Bethel and all the shrines in the towns of Samaria will most certainly come true. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	13	33	Even after this happened , Jeroboam didn ’ t change his evil ways . Instead , he continued to appoint all sorts of people as priests of the shrines . Anyone who wanted to be a priest Jeroboam made a priest for the shrines .
CEB	1%20Kings	13	34	In this way the house of Jeroboam acted sinfully , leading to its downfall and elimination from the earth .
CEB	1%20Kings	14	1	Kgs
CEB	1%20Kings	14	14	For this reason the Lord will raise up a king over Israel who will eliminate the house of Jeroboam . This begins today . What ’ s that ? Even now ! [ a ]

CEB	1%20Kings	14	4	Jeroboam ’ s wife did precisely this . She left and went to Shiloh and came to Ahijah ’ s house . Now Ahijah had become blind in his old age .
CEB	1%20Kings	14	5	The Lord said to Ahijah , “ Look ! Jeroboam ’ s wife has come seeking a word from you about her son . He is sick . Say this and that to her . When she comes , she will be disguised. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	14	6	When Ahijah heard the sound of her feet coming through the doorway , he said , “ Come in , Jeroboam ’ s wife ! Why have you disguised yourself ? I have hard news for you .
CEB	1%20Kings	14	7	Tell Jeroboam : This is what the Lord , Israel ’ s God , says : When I lifted you up from among the people , I appointed you as a leader over my people Israel .
CEB	1%20Kings	14	8	I tore the kingdom from David ’ s house and gave it to you . But you haven ’ t been like my servant David , who kept my commands and followed me with all his heart by doing only what is right in my eyes .
CEB	1%20Kings	14	9	Instead , you have done more evil than any who were before you . You have made other gods and metal images to anger me . You have turned your back on me .
CEB	1%20Kings	14	10	Therefore , I ’ m going to bring disaster on Jeroboam ’ s house ! Because of Jeroboam , I will eliminate everyone who urinates on a wall , whether slave or free . Then I will set fire to the house of Jeroboam , as one burns dung until it is gone .
CEB	1%20Kings	14	11	Dogs will eat any of Jeroboam ’ s family who die in town . Birds will eat those who die in the field . The Lord has spoken !
CEB	1%20Kings	14	12	“ As for you , get up and go back home . When your feet enter the town , the boy will die .
CEB	1%20Kings	14	13	All Israel will mourn for him and will bury him . Out of the whole line of Jeroboam , he alone will have a tomb , because only in him did Israel ’ s God , the Lord , find something good .
CEB	1%20Kings	14	15	The Lord will strike Israel so that it shakes like a reed in water . He will uproot Israel from this fertile land that he gave to their ancestors and their offspring , and he will scatter them across the Euphrates River , because they made the Lord angry by making their sacred poles . [ b ]
CEB	1%20Kings	14	16	Because of the sins Jeroboam committed , and because he made Israel sin too , God will give Israel up. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	14	17	Then Jeroboam ’ s wife left and went to Tirzah . When she stepped across the threshold of the house , the boy died .
CEB	1%20Kings	14	18	All Israel buried him and mourned him in agreement with the Lord ’ s word spoken through his servant the prophet Ahijah .

CEB	1%20Kings	14	22	Judah did evil in the Lord ’ s eyes . The sins they committed made the Lord angrier than anything their ancestors had done .
CEB	1%20Kings	14	23	They also built shrines , standing stones , and sacred poles [ c ] on top of every high hill and under every green tree .
CEB	1%20Kings	14	24	Moreover , the consecrated workers [ d ] in the land did detestable things , just like those nations that the Lord had removed among the Israelites .

CEB	1%20Kings	14	26	He seized the treasures of the Lord ’ s temple and the royal palace . He took everything , even all the gold shields that Solomon had made .
CEB	1%20Kings	14	27	King Rehoboam replaced them with bronze shields and assigned them to the officers of the guard who protected the entrance to the royal palace .
CEB	1%20Kings	14	28	Whenever the king entered the Lord ’ s temple , the guards would carry the shields and then return them to the guardroom .

CEB	1%20Kings	15	17	Israel ’ s King Baasha attacked Judah and fortified Ramah to prevent Judah ’ s King Asa from moving into that area .
CEB	1%20Kings	15	18	Asa took all the silver and gold that remained in the treasuries of the Lord ’ s temple and the royal palace , and he gave them to his officials . Then King Asa sent them with the following message to Aram ’ s King Ben-hadad , Tabrimmon ’ s son and Hezion ’ s grandson , who ruled from Damascus :
CEB	1%20Kings	15	19	“ Let ’ s make a covenant similar to the one between our fathers . Since I have already sent you a gift of silver and gold , break your covenant with Israel ’ s King Baasha so that he will leave me alone. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	15	20	Ben-hadad agreed with King Asa and sent his army commanders against the cities of Israel , attacking Ijon , Dan , Abel-beth-maacah , and all Chinneroth , along with all the land of Naphtali .
CEB	1%20Kings	15	21	As soon as Baasha learned this , he stopped building Ramah and stayed in Tirzah .
CEB	1%20Kings	15	22	King Asa issued an order to every Judean without exception : all the people carried away the stone and timber that Baasha was using to build Ramah , and King Asa used it to build Geba of Benjamin and Mizpah .
CEB	1%20Kings	15	23	The rest of Asa ’ s deeds , his strength , and all that he did , as well as the towns that he built , aren ’ t they written in the official records of Judah ’ s kings ? When he was old , Asa developed a severe foot disease .
CEB	1%20Kings	15	24	He died and was buried with his ancestors in David ’ s City . [ d ] His son Jehoshaphat succeeded him as king . Nadab rules Israel
CEB	1%20Kings	15	25	Jeroboam ’ s son Nadab became king of Israel in the second year of Judah ’ s King Asa . He ruled over Israel for two years .
CEB	1%20Kings	15	26	He did evil in the Lord ’ s eyes by walking in the way of his father Jeroboam and the sin Jeroboam had caused Israel to commit .
CEB	1%20Kings	15	27	Baasha , Ahijah ’ s son from the house of Issachar , plotted against him and attacked him at Gibbethon , which belonged to the Philistines . Nadab and all Israel were laying siege against Gibbethon .
CEB	1%20Kings	15	28	Baasha killed Nadab in the third year of Judah ’ s King Asa and ruled in Nadab ’ s place .
CEB	1%20Kings	15	29	When he became king , Baasha attacked the entire house of Jeroboam . He didn ’ t allow any living person to survive in Jeroboam ’ s family ; he wiped them out according to the Lord ’ s word spoken by the Lord ’ s servant Ahijah of Shiloh .
CEB	1%20Kings	15	30	This happened because of Jeroboam ’ s sins that he committed and that he caused Israel to commit , and because he angered the Lord , Israel ’ s God .
CEB	1%20Kings	15	31	The rest of Nadab ’ s deeds and all that he did , aren ’ t they written in the official records of Israel ’ s kings ?
CEB	1%20Kings	15	32	There was war between Asa and Israel ’ s King Baasha throughout their lifetimes . Baasha rules Israel
CEB	1%20Kings	15	33	In the third year of Judah ’ s King Asa , Baasha , Ahijah ’ s son , became king over all Israel . He ruled in Tirzah for twenty-four years .
CEB	1%20Kings	15	34	He did evil in the Lord ’ s eyes by walking in Jeroboam ’ s ways and the sin he had caused Israel to commit . Footnotes -
CEB	1%20Kings	16	1	Kings 16:33 Heb asherah , perhaps an object devoted to the goddess Asherah
CEB	1%20Kings	16	16	They heard the news : “ Zimri has plotted against the king and killed him. ” Right then , in the camp , the whole Israelite army made their general Omri king of Israel .
CEB	1%20Kings	16	2	I raised you up from the dust and made you a leader over my people Israel , but you walked in Jeroboam ’ s ways , making my people Israel sin , making me angry with their sins .
CEB	1%20Kings	16	3	So look , I am about to set fire to Baasha and his household , and I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam , Nebat ’ s son .
CEB	1%20Kings	16	4	Dogs will eat any of Baasha ’ s family who die in town . Birds will eat any who die in the country .
CEB	1%20Kings	16	5	Now the rest of Baasha ’ s deeds , what he did , and his powerful acts , aren ’ t they written in the official records of Israel ’ s kings ?
CEB	1%20Kings	16	6	Baasha lay down with his ancestors and was buried in Tirzah . His son Elah succeeded him as king .
CEB	1%20Kings	16	7	But the Lord ’ s word came through the prophet Jehu , Hanani ’ s son , concerning Baasha and his house . It concerned everything evil in the Lord ’ s eyes that Baasha had done , angering the Lord by his actions so that he would end up just like the house of Jeroboam . The message was also about how the Lord attacked Baasha . [ a ] Elah rules Israel
CEB	1%20Kings	16	8	In the twenty-sixth year of Judah ’ s King Asa , Elah , Baasha ’ s son , became king over Israel . He ruled in Tirzah for two years .
CEB	1%20Kings	16	9	Zimri , his officer who led half the chariots , plotted against him . Elah was at Tirzah , getting drunk at the house of Arza , who had charge over the palace at Tirzah .
CEB	1%20Kings	16	10	Zimri came , attacked , and killed Elah in the twenty-seventh year of Judah ’ s King Asa . Zimri succeeded him as king .
CEB	1%20Kings	16	11	Once Zimri became king and sat on the throne , he attacked all of Baasha ’ s house . He didn ’ t spare anyone who urinates on a wall , whether relative or friend .
CEB	1%20Kings	16	12	Zimri destroyed the entire house of Baasha in agreement with the Lord ’ s word that had been spoken by the prophet Jehu to Baasha .
CEB	1%20Kings	16	13	This happened because of all Baasha ’ s sins , as well as the sins of his son Elah and because they caused Israel to sin . They angered Israel ’ s God , the Lord , with their insignificant idols .
CEB	1%20Kings	16	14	The rest of Elah ’ s deeds and all that he did , aren ’ t they written in the official records of Israel ’ s kings ? Zimri rules Israel
CEB	1%20Kings	16	15	In the twenty-seventh year of Judah ’ s King Asa , Zimri became king . He ruled in Tirzah for seven days . The army was camped at Gibbethon in Philistia .
CEB	1%20Kings	16	17	Omri and the entire army then went up from Gibbethon and laid siege to Tirzah .
CEB	1%20Kings	16	18	When Zimri saw that the city was captured , he went into the fort of the royal palace and burned it down on top of himself . So he died .
CEB	1%20Kings	16	19	This happened because of the sins Zimri had committed by doing evil in the Lord ’ s eyes and by walking in Jeroboam ’ s ways and the sin he had done by causing Israel to sin .
CEB	1%20Kings	16	20	The rest of Zimri ’ s deeds and the plot he carried out , aren ’ t they written in the official records of Israel ’ s kings ? Omri rules Israel
CEB	1%20Kings	16	21	At this time the people of Israel were split in two . One half of the people followed Tibni , Ginath ’ s son , making him king ; the other half followed Omri .
CEB	1%20Kings	16	22	Omri ’ s side was stronger than those who followed Tibni , Ginath ’ s son . So Tibni died and Omri became king .
CEB	1%20Kings	16	23	In the thirty-first year of Judah ’ s King Asa , Omri became king of Israel . He ruled for twelve years , six of which were in Tirzah .
CEB	1%20Kings	16	24	He bought the hill of Samaria from Shemer for two kikkars of silver . He fortified the hill and named the town that he built there after Shemer , the previous owner of the hill of Samaria .
CEB	1%20Kings	16	25	Omri did evil in the Lord ’ s eyes , more evil than anyone who preceded him .
CEB	1%20Kings	16	26	He walked in all the ways and sins of Jeroboam , Nebat ’ s son , because he caused Israel to sin . They angered Israel ’ s God , the Lord , with their worthless idols .
CEB	1%20Kings	16	27	The rest of Omri ’ s deeds and his powerful acts , aren ’ t they written in the official records of Israel ’ s kings ?
CEB	1%20Kings	16	28	Omri lay down with his ancestors and was buried in Samaria . His son Ahab succeeded him as king . Ahab rules Israel
CEB	1%20Kings	16	29	In the thirty-eighth year of Judah ’ s King Asa , Ahab , Omri ’ s son , became king of Israel . He ruled over Israel in Samaria for twenty-two years
CEB	1%20Kings	16	30	and did evil in the Lord ’ s eyes , more than anyone who preceded him .
CEB	1%20Kings	16	31	Ahab found it easy to walk in the sins of Jeroboam , Nebat ’ s son . He married Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal , who was the king of the Sidonians . He served and worshipped Baal .
CEB	1%20Kings	16	32	He made an altar for Baal in the Baal temple he had constructed in Samaria .
CEB	1%20Kings	16	33	Ahab also made a sacred pole [ b ] and did more to anger the Lord , the God of Israel , than any of Israel ’ s kings who preceded him .
CEB	1%20Kings	16	34	During Ahab ’ s time , Hiel from Bethel rebuilt Jericho . He set up its foundations at the cost of his oldest son Abiram . He hung its gates at the cost of his youngest son Segub . This fulfilled the Lord ’ s word spoken through Joshua , Nun ’ s son . Footnotes -
CEB	1%20Kings	17	1	Kings
CEB	1%20Kings	17	17	After these things , the son of the widow , who was the matriarch of the household , became ill. His sickness got steadily worse until he wasn ’ t breathing anymore .
CEB	1%20Kings	17	2	Then the Lord ’ s word came to Elijah :
CEB	1%20Kings	17	3	Go from here and turn east . Hide by the Cherith Brook that faces the Jordan River .
CEB	1%20Kings	17	4	You can drink from the brook . I have also ordered the ravens to provide for you there .
CEB	1%20Kings	17	5	Elijah went and did just what the Lord said . He stayed by the Cherith Brook that faced the Jordan River .
CEB	1%20Kings	17	6	The ravens brought bread and meat in the mornings and evenings . He drank from the Cherith Brook .
CEB	1%20Kings	17	7	After a while the brook dried up because there was no rain in the land . Elijah and the widow from Zarephath
CEB	1%20Kings	17	8	The Lord ’ s word came to Elijah :
CEB	1%20Kings	17	9	Get up and go to Zarephath near Sidon and stay there . I have ordered a widow there to take care of you .
CEB	1%20Kings	17	10	Elijah left and went to Zarephath . As he came to the town gate , he saw a widow collecting sticks . He called out to her , “ Please get a little water for me in this cup so I can drink. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	17	11	She went to get some water . He then said to her , “ Please get me a piece of bread. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	17	12	“ As surely as the Lord your God lives , ” she replied , “ I don ’ t have any food ; only a handful of flour in a jar and a bit of oil in a bottle . Look at me . I ’ m collecting two sticks so that I can make some food for myself and my son . We ’ ll eat the last of the food and then die. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	17	13	Elijah said to her , “ Don ’ t be afraid ! Go and do what you said . Only make a little loaf of bread for me first . Then bring it to me . You can make something for yourself and your son after that .
CEB	1%20Kings	17	14	This is what Israel ’ s God , the Lord , says : The jar of flour won ’ t decrease and the bottle of oil won ’ t run out until the day the Lord sends rain on the earth. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	17	15	The widow went and did what Elijah said . So the widow , Elijah , and the widow ’ s household ate for many days .
CEB	1%20Kings	17	16	The jar of flour didn ’ t decrease nor did the bottle of oil run out , just as the Lord spoke through Elijah .
CEB	1%20Kings	17	18	She said to Elijah , “ What ’ s gone wrong between us , man of God ? Have you come to me to call attention to my sin and kill my son ? ”
CEB	1%20Kings	17	19	Elijah replied , “ Give your son to me. ” He took her son from her and carried him to the upper room where he was staying . Elijah laid him on his bed .
CEB	1%20Kings	17	20	Elijah cried out to the Lord , “ Lord my God , why is it that you have brought such evil upon the widow that I am staying with by killing her son ? ”
CEB	1%20Kings	17	21	Then he stretched himself over the boy three times and cried out to the Lord , “ Lord my God , please give this boy ’ s life back to him. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	17	22	The Lord listened to Elijah ’ s voice and gave the boy his life back . And he lived .
CEB	1%20Kings	17	23	Elijah brought the boy down from the upper room of the house and gave him to his mother . Elijah said , “ Look , your son is alive ! ”
CEB	1%20Kings	17	24	“ Now I know that you really are a man of God , ” the woman said to Elijah , “ and that the Lord ’ s word is truly in your mouth . ”
CEB	1%20Kings	18	1	Kings 18:37 Heb uncertain
CEB	1%20Kings	18	18	Elijah answered , “ I haven ’ t troubled Israel ; you and your father ’ s house have ! You did as much when you deserted the Lord ’ s commands and followed the Baals .
CEB	1%20Kings	18	2	So Elijah went to appear before Ahab . Now the famine had become especially bad in Samaria .
CEB	1%20Kings	18	3	Ahab had called Obadiah , who was in charge of the palace affairs . ( Obadiah greatly feared the Lord .
CEB	1%20Kings	18	4	When Jezebel killed the Lord ’ s prophets , Obadiah took one hundred of them and hid them , fifty each in two caves . He supplied them with food and water . )
CEB	1%20Kings	18	5	Ahab said to Obadiah , “ Go throughout the land and check every spring of water and every brook . Perhaps we can find some grass to keep our horses and mules alive so we don ’ t have to kill any of them. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	18	6	To search , they divided the land between themselves . Ahab went one way by himself , while Obadiah went a different way by himself .
CEB	1%20Kings	18	7	While Obadiah was out searching , suddenly Elijah met up with him . When Obadiah saw him , he fell on his face . “ My master ! ” he said . “ Are you Elijah ? ”
CEB	1%20Kings	18	8	Elijah replied , “ I am . Go and say to your master , ‘ Elijah is here ! ’ ”
CEB	1%20Kings	18	9	Then Obadiah said , “ How have I sinned that you are handing me , your servant , over to Ahab so he can kill me ?
CEB	1%20Kings	18	10	As surely as the Lord your God lives , there ’ s no nation or kingdom where my master Ahab hasn ’ t looked for you . They would insist , ‘ He ’ s not here , ’ but Ahab would make them swear that they couldn ’ t find you .
CEB	1%20Kings	18	11	And now you are commanding me : ‘ Go and say to your master , “ Elijah is here ” ’ ?
CEB	1%20Kings	18	12	But here ’ s what will happen : As soon as I leave you , the Lord ’ s spirit will carry you off somewhere—I don ’ t know where—then I ’ ll report to Ahab , but he won ’ t be able to find you . Then he will kill me ! But your servant has feared the Lord from my youth .
CEB	1%20Kings	18	13	Wasn ’ t my master told what I did when Jezebel killed the Lord ’ s prophets ? I hid one hundred of the Lord ’ s prophets , fifty each in two caves . I also supplied them with food and water .
CEB	1%20Kings	18	14	But even after all that , you tell me , ‘ Say to your master , “ Elijah is here ” ’ ! Ahab will kill me ! ”
CEB	1%20Kings	18	15	Elijah said , “ As surely as the Lord of heavenly forces lives , the one I serve , I will appear before Ahab today. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	18	16	So Obadiah went to meet Ahab . He told him what had happened . Then Ahab went to meet Elijah .
CEB	1%20Kings	18	17	When Ahab saw Elijah , Ahab said to him , “ Is that you , the one who troubles Israel ? ”
CEB	1%20Kings	18	19	Now send a message and gather all Israel to me at Mount Carmel . Gather the four hundred fifty prophets of Baal and the four hundred prophets of Asherah who eat at Jezebel ’ s table. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	18	20	Ahab sent the message to all the Israelites . He gathered the prophets at Mount Carmel .
CEB	1%20Kings	18	21	Elijah approached all the people and said , “ How long will you hobble back and forth between two opinions ? If the Lord [ a ] is God , follow God . If Baal is God , follow Baal. ” The people gave no answer .
CEB	1%20Kings	18	22	Elijah said to the people , “ I am the last of the Lord ’ s prophets , but Baal ’ s prophets number four hundred fifty .
CEB	1%20Kings	18	23	Give us two bulls . Let Baal ’ s prophets choose one . Let them cut it apart and set it on the wood , but don ’ t add fire . I ’ ll prepare the other bull , put it on the wood , but won ’ t add fire .
CEB	1%20Kings	18	24	Then all of you will call on the name of your god , and I will call on the name of the Lord . The god who answers with fire—that ’ s the real God ! ” All the people answered , “ That ’ s an excellent idea. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	18	25	So Elijah said to the prophets of Baal , “ Choose one of these bulls . Prepare it first since there are so many of you . Call on the name of your god , but don ’ t add fire. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	18	26	So they took one of the bulls that had been brought to them . They prepared it and called on Baal ’ s name from morning to midday . They said , “ Great Baal , answer us ! ” But there was no sound or answer . They performed a hopping dance around the altar that had been set up .
CEB	1%20Kings	18	27	Around noon , Elijah started making fun of them : “ Shout louder ! Certainly he ’ s a god ! Perhaps he is lost in thought or wandering or traveling somewhere . [ b ] Or maybe he is asleep and must wake up ! ”
CEB	1%20Kings	18	28	So the prophets of Baal cried with a louder voice and cut themselves with swords and knives as was their custom . Their blood flowed all over them .
CEB	1%20Kings	18	29	As noon passed they went crazy with their ritual until it was time for the evening offering . Still there was no sound or answer , no response whatsoever .
CEB	1%20Kings	18	30	Then Elijah said to all the people , “ Come here ! ” All the people closed in , and he repaired the Lord ’ s altar that had been damaged .
CEB	1%20Kings	18	31	Elijah took twelve stones , according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob—to whom the Lord ’ s word came : “ Your name will be Israel. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	18	32	He built the stones into an altar in the Lord ’ s name , and he dug a trench around the altar big enough to hold two seahs [ c ] of dry grain .
CEB	1%20Kings	18	33	He put the wood in order , butchered the bull , and placed the bull on the wood . “ Fill four jars with water and pour it on the sacrifice and on the wood , ” he commanded .
CEB	1%20Kings	18	34	“ Do it a second time ! ” he said . So they did it a second time . “ Do it a third time ! ” And so they did it a third time .
CEB	1%20Kings	18	35	The water flowed around the altar , and even the trench filled with water .
CEB	1%20Kings	18	36	At the time of the evening offering , the prophet Elijah drew near and prayed : “ Lord , the God of Abraham , Isaac , and Israel , let it be known today that you are God in Israel and that I am your servant . I have done all these things at your instructions .
CEB	1%20Kings	18	37	Answer me , Lord ! Answer me so that this people will know that you , Lord , are the real God and that you can change their hearts. ” [ d ]
CEB	1%20Kings	18	38	Then the Lord ’ s fire fell ; it consumed the sacrifice , the wood , the stones , and the dust . It even licked up the water in the trench !
CEB	1%20Kings	18	39	All the people saw this and fell on their faces . “ The Lord is the real God ! The Lord is the real God ! ” they exclaimed .
CEB	1%20Kings	18	40	Elijah said to them , “ Seize Baal ’ s prophets ! Don ’ t let any escape ! ” The people seized the prophets , and Elijah brought them to the Kishon Brook and killed them there .
CEB	1%20Kings	18	41	Elijah then said to Ahab , “ Get up ! Celebrate with food and drink because I hear the sound of a rainstorm coming. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	18	42	So Ahab got up to celebrate with food and drink . But Elijah went up to the top of Mount Carmel . He bowed down to the ground and put his face between his knees .
CEB	1%20Kings	18	43	He said to his assistant , “ Please get up and look toward the sea. ” So the assistant did so . He said , “ I don ’ t see anything. ” Seven times Elijah said , “ Do it again. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	18	44	The seventh time the assistant said , “ I see a small cloud the size of a human hand coming up from the sea. ” Elijah said , “ Go and tell Ahab , ‘ Pull yourself together , go down the mountain , and don ’ t let the rain hold you back. ’ ”
CEB	1%20Kings	18	45	After a little while , the sky became dark with clouds , and a wind came up with a huge rainstorm . Ahab was already riding on his way to Jezreel ,
CEB	1%20Kings	18	46	but the Lord ’ s power strengthened Elijah . He gathered up his clothes and ran in front of Ahab until he came to Jezreel . Footnotes -
CEB	1%20Kings	19	1	Kings
CEB	1%20Kings	19	19	So Elijah departed from there and found Elisha , Shaphat ’ s son . He was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him . Elisha was with the twelfth yoke . Elijah met up with him and threw his coat on him .
CEB	1%20Kings	19	2	Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah with this message : “ May the gods do whatever they want to me if by this time tomorrow I haven ’ t made your life like the life of one of them. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	19	3	Elijah was terrified . He got up and ran for his life . He arrived at Beer-sheba in Judah and left his assistant there .
CEB	1%20Kings	19	4	He himself went farther on into the desert a day ’ s journey . He finally sat down under a solitary broom bush . He longed for his own death : “ It ’ s more than enough , Lord ! Take my life because I ’ m no better than my ancestors. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	19	5	He lay down and slept under the solitary broom bush . Then suddenly a messenger tapped him and said to him , “ Get up ! Eat something ! ”
CEB	1%20Kings	19	6	Elijah opened his eyes and saw flatbread baked on glowing coals and a jar of water right by his head . He ate and drank , and then went back to sleep .
CEB	1%20Kings	19	7	The Lord ’ s messenger returned a second time and tapped him . “ Get up ! ” the messenger said . “ Eat something , because you have a difficult road ahead of you. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	19	8	Elijah got up , ate and drank , and went refreshed by that food for forty days and nights until he arrived at Horeb , God ’ s mountain .
CEB	1%20Kings	19	9	There he went into a cave and spent the night . The Lord ’ s word came to him and said , “ Why are you here , Elijah ? ”
CEB	1%20Kings	19	10	Elijah replied , “ I ’ ve been very passionate for the Lord God of heavenly forces because the Israelites have abandoned your covenant . They have torn down your altars , and they have murdered your prophets with the sword . I ’ m the only one left , and now they want to take my life too ! ”
CEB	1%20Kings	19	11	The Lord said , “ Go out and stand at the mountain before the Lord . The Lord is passing by. ” A very strong wind tore through the mountains and broke apart the stones before the Lord . But the Lord wasn ’ t in the wind . After the wind , there was an earthquake . But the Lord wasn ’ t in the earthquake .
CEB	1%20Kings	19	12	After the earthquake , there was a fire . But the Lord wasn ’ t in the fire . After the fire , there was a sound . Thin . Quiet .
CEB	1%20Kings	19	13	When Elijah heard it , he wrapped his face in his coat . He went out and stood at the cave ’ s entrance . A voice came to him and said , “ Why are you here , Elijah ? ”
CEB	1%20Kings	19	14	He said , “ I ’ ve been very passionate for the Lord God of heavenly forces because the Israelites have abandoned your covenant . They have torn down your altars , and they have murdered your prophets with the sword . I ’ m the only one left , and now they want to take my life too. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	19	15	The Lord said to him , “ Go back through the desert to Damascus and anoint Hazael as king of Aram .
CEB	1%20Kings	19	16	Also anoint Jehu , Nimshi ’ s son , as king of Israel ; and anoint Elisha from Abel-meholah , Shaphat ’ s son , to succeed you as prophet .
CEB	1%20Kings	19	17	Whoever escapes from the sword of Hazael , Jehu will kill . Whoever escapes from the sword of Jehu , Elisha will kill .
CEB	1%20Kings	19	18	But I have preserved those who remain in Israel , totaling seven thousand—all those whose knees haven ’ t bowed down to Baal and whose mouths haven ’ t kissed him. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	19	20	Elisha immediately left the oxen and ran after Elijah . “ Let me kiss my father and my mother , ” Elisha said , “ then I will follow you. ” Elijah replied , “ Go ! I ’ m not holding you back ! ”
CEB	1%20Kings	19	21	Elisha turned back from following Elijah , took the pair of oxen , and slaughtered them . Then with equipment from the oxen , Elisha boiled the meat , gave it to the people , and they ate it . Then he got up , followed Elijah , and served him .
CEB	1%20Kings	20	1	Kings 20:34 Heb lacks The king replied .
CEB	1%20Kings	20	20	Each one struck down his opponent , so that the Arameans fled . Israel chased after them . Ben-hadad , Aram ’ s king , escaped with some horses and chariots .
CEB	1%20Kings	20	2	He sent messengers to Ahab , Israel ’ s king , inside Samaria .
CEB	1%20Kings	20	3	The message said , “ This is what Ben-hadad says : ‘ Your silver and your gold are mine . Your good-looking wives and children are mine. ’ ”
CEB	1%20Kings	20	4	Israel ’ s king answered , “ Whatever you say , my master , great king . I am yours and so is everything I have. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	20	5	The messengers came back again : “ This is what Ben-hadad says : ‘ I sent you the message : Give me your silver and gold , your wives and your sons .
CEB	1%20Kings	20	6	However , at this time tomorrow I will send my officers to you , and they will search your palace and the houses of your officers . Everything that you find valuable they will seize and take away. ’ ”
CEB	1%20Kings	20	7	Then Israel ’ s king called all the elders of the land and he said , “ Please know and understand the evil this man wants to do ! He demanded from me my wives and sons , and my silver and gold ; and I didn ’ t refuse him. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	20	8	All of the elders and the people said to him , “ Don ’ t obey and don ’ t give in ! ”
CEB	1%20Kings	20	9	So the king said to Ben-hadad ’ s messengers , “ Say to my master the king : ‘ Everything that you first ordered your servant , I will do . But I can ’ t comply with this new command. ’ ” The messengers took this response to Ben-hadad ,
CEB	1%20Kings	20	10	who sent back this reply : “ May the gods do whatever they want to me if there is even a handful of dust left in Samaria for the armies under me ! ”
CEB	1%20Kings	20	11	Then Israel ’ s king replied , “ The one who prepares for battle shouldn ’ t brag like one returning from battle. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	20	12	When Ben-hadad heard this message , he and the other kings were drinking in their tents . Ben-hadad said to his officers , “ Take your positions ! ” So they took up their positions against the city .
CEB	1%20Kings	20	13	Suddenly a prophet approached Israel ’ s King Ahab . He said , “ This is what the Lord says : Do you see that great army ? Today I am handing it over to you . Then you will know that I am the Lord. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	20	14	Ahab said , “ Who will do it ? ” The prophet answered , “ This is what the Lord says : The servants of the district officials will do it. ” “ Who should start the battle ? ” Ahab asked . “ You should , ” the prophet replied .
CEB	1%20Kings	20	15	So Ahab assembled the servants of the district officials . There were two hundred thirty-two of them . Next he assembled the entire Israelite army , seven thousand total .
CEB	1%20Kings	20	16	At noon they marched for battle . Meanwhile , Ben-hadad and the thirty-two kings allied with him were getting drunk in their tents .
CEB	1%20Kings	20	17	The servants of the district officials were at the head of the march . Ben-hadad sent for information and was told , “ Some men have marched out of Samaria. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	20	18	He said , “ If they have come out in peace , take them alive ; if they have come out for war , take them alive as well. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	20	19	So the servants of the district governors with the army behind them marched out from the city .
CEB	1%20Kings	20	21	Israel ’ s king went out and attacked the horses and chariots . He attacked the Arameans with a fierce assault .
CEB	1%20Kings	20	22	The prophet came to Israel ’ s king and said to him , “ Maintain your strength ! Know and understand that at the turn of the coming year , Aram ’ s king will attack you again. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	20	23	The officers of Aram ’ s king said to him , “ Israel ’ s god is a god of the mountains . That ’ s why they were stronger than us . But if we fight them on the plains , we will certainly be stronger than they are .
CEB	1%20Kings	20	24	This is what you need to do : Remove the kings from their military posts and appoint officials in their place .
CEB	1%20Kings	20	25	Then raise another army like the one that was destroyed , with horses like those horses and chariots like those chariots . Then we will fight them on the plains , and we will certainly be stronger than they are. ” The king took their advice and followed it .
CEB	1%20Kings	20	26	So in the spring of the year , Ben-hadad assembled the Arameans and marched up to Aphek to fight with Israel .
CEB	1%20Kings	20	27	Now the Israelites had already been assembled and provisioned , so they went to engage the Arameans . The Israelites camped before them like two small flocks of goats , but the Arameans filled the land .
CEB	1%20Kings	20	28	Then the man of God came forward and said to Israel ’ s king , “ This is what the Lord says : Because the Arameans said that the Lord is a god of the mountains but not a god of the valleys , I am handing this whole great army over to you . Then you will know that I am the Lord. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	20	29	The two armies camped opposite each other for seven days . On the seventh day , the battle began . The Israelites attacked and destroyed one hundred thousand Aramean foot soldiers in a single day .
CEB	1%20Kings	20	30	Those who were left fled to Aphek , into the city where a wall fell on twenty-seven thousand more of them . But Ben-hadad escaped and hid in an inner room within the city .
CEB	1%20Kings	20	31	Ben-hadad ’ s officers said to him , “ Listen , we have heard that the kings of Israel are merciful kings . Allow us to put mourning clothes on our bodies and cords around our heads . We will then go to Israel ’ s king . Perhaps he will let you live. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	20	32	So they put mourning clothes on their bodies and cords around their heads . They went to Israel ’ s king and said , “ Ben-hadad is your slave . He begs , ‘ Please let me live ! ’ ” Israel ’ s king said , “ Is he still alive ? He is my brother. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	20	33	Taking this as a good sign , Ben-hadad ’ s men quickly accepted this statement . [ a ] “ Yes , Ben-hadad is your brother ! ” they said . “ Go and get him , ” the king ordered . So Ben-hadad came to him , and the king received him into his chariot .
CEB	1%20Kings	20	34	Ben-hadad said to the king , “ I will return the towns that my father took from your father . Furthermore , you can set up markets for yourself in Damascus just as my father did in Samaria. ” The king replied , [ b ] “ On the basis of this covenant , I will let you go. ” So he made a covenant with Ben-hadad and set him free .
CEB	1%20Kings	20	35	At the Lord ’ s command a certain man who belonged to a prophetic group said to his friend : “ Please strike me. ” But his friend refused to hit him .
CEB	1%20Kings	20	36	So he said to his friend , “ Because you didn ’ t obey the Lord ’ s voice , a lion will attack you as soon as you leave me. ” And as the friend left the prophet , a lion found him and attacked him .
CEB	1%20Kings	20	37	Then the prophet found another man and said , “ Please strike me. ” He hit the prophet , and the attack left a wound .
CEB	1%20Kings	20	38	The prophet went and stood before the king by the road . He disguised himself by putting a bandage over his eyes .
CEB	1%20Kings	20	39	When the king passed by , the prophet called out to the king , “ Your servant was in the middle of the battle when someone brought a prisoner . ‘ Guard this man , ’ he said . ‘ If he escapes it will be your life for his—that , or you will owe me a kikkar of silver. ’
CEB	1%20Kings	20	40	Your servant got busy doing this and that , and the prisoner disappeared. ” Israel ’ s king replied , “ It appears you have decided your own fate. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	20	41	The prophet quickly tore the bandage from over his eyes , and Israel ’ s king recognized him as one of the prophets .
CEB	1%20Kings	20	42	Then the prophet said to the king , “ This is what the Lord says : Because you freed a man I condemned to die , it will be your life for his life , and your people for his people. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	20	43	So Israel ’ s king went to his palace at Samaria , irritated and upset . Footnotes -
CEB	1%20Kings	21	1	Kings 21:4 Heb adds from Jezreel ; also in 21:6-7 , 15-16 .
CEB	1%20Kings	21	21	So I am now bringing evil on you ! I will burn until you are consumed , and I will eliminate everyone who urinates on a wall that belongs to Ahab , whether slave or free .
CEB	1%20Kings	21	2	Ahab ordered Naboth , “ Give me your vineyard so it can become my vegetable garden , because it is right next to my palace . In exchange for it , I ’ ll give you an even better vineyard . Or if you prefer , I ’ ll pay you the price in silver. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	21	3	Naboth responded to Ahab , “ Lord forbid that I give you my family inheritance ! ”
CEB	1%20Kings	21	4	So Ahab went to his palace , irritated and upset at what Naboth [ a ] had said to him—because Naboth had said , “ I won ’ t give you my family inheritance ! ” Ahab lay down on his bed and turned his face away . He wouldn ’ t eat anything .
CEB	1%20Kings	21	5	His wife Jezebel came to him . “ Why are you upset and not eating any food ? ” she asked .
CEB	1%20Kings	21	6	He answered her , “ I was talking to Naboth . I said , ‘ Sell me your vineyard . Or if you prefer , I ’ ll give you another vineyard for it. ’ But he said , ‘ I won ’ t give you my vineyard ! ’ ”
CEB	1%20Kings	21	7	Then his wife Jezebel said to him , “ Aren ’ t you the one who rules Israel ? Get up ! Eat some food and cheer up . I ’ ll get Naboth ’ s vineyard for you myself. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	21	8	So she wrote letters in Ahab ’ s name , putting his seal on them . She sent them to the elders and officials who lived in the same town as Naboth .
CEB	1%20Kings	21	9	This is what she wrote in the letters : “ Announce a fast and place Naboth at the head of the people .
CEB	1%20Kings	21	10	Then bring in two liars in front of him and have them testify as follows : ‘ You cursed God and king ! ’ Then take Naboth outside and stone him so he dies. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	21	11	The elders and the officials who lived in Naboth ’ s town did exactly as Jezebel specified in the letters that she had sent .
CEB	1%20Kings	21	12	They announced a fast and placed Naboth at the head of the people .
CEB	1%20Kings	21	13	Then the two liars came and sat in front of him . They testified against Naboth in front of the people , “ Naboth cursed God and king ! ” So the people took Naboth outside the town and stoned him so that he died .
CEB	1%20Kings	21	14	It was then reported to Jezebel , “ Naboth was stoned . He ’ s dead. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	21	15	As soon as Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned to death , she said to Ahab , “ Get up and take ownership of the vineyard of Naboth , which he had refused to sell to you . Naboth is no longer alive ; he ’ s dead. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	21	16	When Ahab heard that Naboth had died , he got up and went down to Naboth ’ s vineyard to take ownership of it .
CEB	1%20Kings	21	17	The Lord ’ s word came to Elijah from Tishbe :
CEB	1%20Kings	21	18	Get up and go down to meet Israel ’ s King Ahab in Samaria . He is in Naboth ’ s vineyard . He has gone down to take ownership of it .
CEB	1%20Kings	21	19	Say the following to him : This is what the Lord says : So , you ’ ve murdered and are now taking ownership , are you ? Then tell him : This is what the Lord says : In the same place where the dogs licked up Naboth ’ s blood , they will lick up your own blood .
CEB	1%20Kings	21	20	Ahab said to Elijah , “ So you ’ ve found me , my old enemy ! ” “ I found you , ” Elijah said , “ because you ’ ve enslaved yourself by doing evil in the Lord ’ s eyes .
CEB	1%20Kings	21	22	I will make your household like that of Jeroboam , Nebat ’ s son , and like the household of Baasha , Ahijah ’ s son , because of the way you ’ ve angered me and because you ’ ve made Israel sin .
CEB	1%20Kings	21	23	As for Jezebel , the Lord says this : Dogs will devour Jezebel in the area of Jezreel .
CEB	1%20Kings	21	24	Dogs will eat anyone of Ahab ’ s family who dies in town , and birds will eat anyone who dies in the country. ” (
CEB	1%20Kings	21	25	Truly there has never been anyone like Ahab who sold out by doing evil in the Lord ’ s eyes—evil that his wife Jezebel led him to do .
CEB	1%20Kings	21	26	Ahab ’ s actions were deplorable . He followed after the worthless idols exactly like the Amorites had done—the very ones the Lord had removed before the Israelites . )
CEB	1%20Kings	21	27	When Ahab heard these words , he tore his clothes and put mourning clothes on his body . He fasted , even slept in mourning clothes , and walked around depressed .
CEB	1%20Kings	21	28	The Lord ’ s word then came to Elijah from Tishbe :
CEB	1%20Kings	21	29	Have you seen how Ahab has humbled himself before me ? Because he has done so , I won ’ t bring the evil during his lifetime . Instead , I will bring the evil on his household in the days of his son . Footnotes -
CEB	1%20Kings	22	1	Kings 22:46 Traditionally cultic prostitutes
CEB	1%20Kings	22	22	‘ I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets , ’ he said . The Lord agreed , ‘ You will succeed in persuading him ! Go ahead ! ’
CEB	1%20Kings	22	2	In the third year , Judah ’ s King Jehoshaphat visited Israel ’ s king .
CEB	1%20Kings	22	3	Israel ’ s king said to his servants , “ You know , don ’ t you , that Ramoth-gilead is ours ? But we aren ’ t doing anything to take it back from the king of Aram. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	22	4	He said to Jehoshaphat , “ Will you go with me into battle at Ramoth-gilead ? ” Jehoshaphat said to Israel ’ s king , “ I am with you , and my troops and my horses are united with yours .
CEB	1%20Kings	22	5	But , ” Jehoshaphat said to Israel ’ s king , “ first let ’ s see what the Lord has to say. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	22	6	So Israel ’ s king gathered about four hundred prophets , and he asked them , “ Should I go to war with Ramoth-gilead or not ? ” “ Attack ! ” the prophets answered . “ The Lord will hand it over to the king. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	22	7	But Jehoshaphat said , “ Isn ’ t there any other prophet of the Lord whom we could ask ? ”
CEB	1%20Kings	22	8	“ There is one other man who could ask the Lord for us , ” Israel ’ s king told Jehoshaphat , “ but I hate him because he never prophesies anything good about me , only bad . His name is Micaiah , Imlah ’ s son. ” “ The king shouldn ’ t speak like that ! ” Jehoshaphat said .
CEB	1%20Kings	22	9	So Israel ’ s king called an officer and ordered , “ Bring Micaiah , Imlah ’ s son , right away. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	22	10	Now Israel ’ s king and Judah ’ s King Jehoshaphat were sitting on their thrones , dressed in their royal robes at the threshing floor beside the entrance to the gate of Samaria . All the prophets were prophesying in front of them .
CEB	1%20Kings	22	11	Zedekiah , Chenaanah ’ s son , made iron horns for himself and said , “ This is what the Lord says : With these horns you will gore the Arameans until there ’ s nothing left of them ! ”
CEB	1%20Kings	22	12	All the other prophets agreed : “ Attack Ramoth-gilead and win ! The Lord will hand it over to the king ! ”
CEB	1%20Kings	22	13	Meanwhile , the messenger who had gone to summon Micaiah said to him , “ Listen , the prophets all agree that the king will succeed . You should say the same thing they say and prophesy success. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	22	14	But Micaiah answered , “ As surely as the Lord lives , I will say only what the Lord tells me to say. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	22	15	When Micaiah arrived , the king asked him , “ Micaiah , should we go to war with Ramoth-gilead or not ? ” “ Attack and win ! ” Micaiah answered . “ The Lord will hand it over to the king ! ”
CEB	1%20Kings	22	16	But the king said , “ How many times must I demand that you tell me the truth when you speak in the name of the Lord ? ”
CEB	1%20Kings	22	17	Then Micaiah replied , “ I saw all Israel scattered on the hills like sheep without a shepherd ! And then the Lord said : They have no master . Let them return safely to their own homes. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	22	18	Then Israel ’ s king said to Jehoshaphat , “ Didn ’ t I tell you ? He never prophesies anything good about me , only bad. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	22	19	Then Micaiah said , “ Listen now to the Lord ’ s word : I saw the Lord enthroned with all the heavenly forces stationed beside him , at his right and at his left .
CEB	1%20Kings	22	20	The Lord said , ‘ Who will persuade Ahab so that he attacks Ramoth-gilead and dies there ? ’ There were many suggestions
CEB	1%20Kings	22	21	until one particular spirit approached the Lord and said , ‘ I ’ ll persuade him. ’ ‘ How ? ’ the Lord asked .
CEB	1%20Kings	22	23	So now , since the Lord has placed a lying spirit in the mouths of every one of these prophets of yours , it is the Lord who has pronounced disaster against you ! ”
CEB	1%20Kings	22	24	Zedekiah , Chenaanah ’ s son , approached Micaiah and slapped him on the cheek . “ Just how did the Lord ’ s spirit leave me to speak to you ? ” he asked .
CEB	1%20Kings	22	25	Micaiah answered , “ You will find out on the day you try to hide in an inner room. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	22	26	“ Arrest him , ” ordered Israel ’ s king , “ and turn him over to Amon the city official and to Joash the king ’ s son .
CEB	1%20Kings	22	27	Tell them , ‘ The king says : Put this man in prison and feed him minimum rations of bread and water until I return safely. ’ ”
CEB	1%20Kings	22	28	“ If you ever return safely , ” Micaiah replied , “ then the Lord wasn ’ t speaking through me. ” Then he added , “ Pay attention , every last one of you ! ”
CEB	1%20Kings	22	29	So Israel ’ s king and Judah ’ s King Jehoshaphat attacked Ramoth-gilead .
CEB	1%20Kings	22	30	Israel ’ s king said to Jehoshaphat , “ I will disguise myself when we go into battle , [ a ] but you should wear your royal attire. ” When Israel ’ s king had disguised himself , they entered the battle .
CEB	1%20Kings	22	31	Meanwhile , Aram ’ s king had commanded his thirty-two chariot officers , “ Don ’ t bother with anyone big or small . Fight only with Israel ’ s king. ”
CEB	1%20Kings	22	32	As soon as the chariot officers saw Jehoshaphat , they assumed that he must be Israel ’ s king , so they turned to attack him . But Jehoshaphat cried out for help .
CEB	1%20Kings	22	33	When the chariot officers realized that he wasn ’ t Israel ’ s king , they stopped chasing him .
CEB	1%20Kings	22	34	But someone randomly shot an arrow that struck Israel ’ s king between the joints in his armor . [ b ] “ Turn around and get me out of the battle , ” the king told his chariot driver . “ I ’ ve been hit ! ”
CEB	1%20Kings	22	35	years old when he became king , and he ruled for twenty-five years in Jerusalem . His mother ’ s name was Azubah ; she was Shilhi ’ s daughter .
CEB	1%20Kings	22	36	When the sun set , a shout spread throughout the camp : “ Retreat to your towns ! Retreat to your land ! ”
CEB	1%20Kings	22	37	Once the king had died , people came from Samaria and buried the king there .
CEB	1%20Kings	22	38	They cleaned the chariot at the pool of Samaria . The dogs licked up the king ’ s blood and the prostitutes bathed in it , just as the Lord had spoken . Ahab ’ s last days

CEB	1%20Kings	22	42	Jehoshaphat was
CEB	1%20Kings	22	43	Jehoshapat walked in all the ways of his father Asa , not deviating from it . He did the right things in the Lord ’ s eyes , with the exception that he didn ’ t remove the shrines . The people continued to sacrifice and offer incense at them .
CEB	1%20Kings	22	44	Jehoshaphat made peace with Israel ’ s king .
CEB	1%20Kings	22	45	The rest of Jehoshaphat ’ s deeds , the great acts he did , and how he fought in battle , aren ’ t they written in the official records of Judah ’ s kings ?
CEB	1%20Kings	22	46	Additionally , Jehoshaphat purged the land of the consecrated workers [ c ] who remained from the days of Asa .
CEB	1%20Kings	22	47	Now Edom had no king ; only a deputy was ruler .
CEB	1%20Kings	22	48	Jehoshaphat built Tarshish-styled ships to go to Ophir for gold . But the fleet didn ’ t go because it was wrecked at Ezion-geber .
CEB	1%20Kings	22	49	Then Ahaziah , Ahab ’ s son , said to Jehoshaphat , “ Let my sailors go with your sailors on the ships. ” But Jehoshaphat didn ’ t agree to this .
CEB	1%20Kings	22	50	Jehoshaphat died and was buried with his ancestors in his ancestor David ’ s City . His son Jehoram succeeded him as king . Ahaziah rules Israel
CEB	1%20Kings	22	51	In the seventeenth year of Judah ’ s King Jehoshaphat , Ahaziah , Ahab ’ s son , became king over Israel in Samaria . He ruled over Israel for two years .
CEB	1%20Kings	22	52	He did evil in the Lord ’ s eyes . He walked in his father ’ s ways and his mother ’ s ways—that is , in the ways of Jeroboam , Nebat ’ s son , who had caused Israel to sin .
CEB	1%20Kings	22	53	Ahaziah served Baal and worshipped him . He angered the Lord , Israel ’ s God , by doing all the same things his father had done . Footnotes -
CEB	2%20Kings	1	2	Kings 1:17 Heb Jehoram ; the king ’ s name is variously spelled in either long Jehoram or short Joram form .
CEB	2%20Kings	1	1	After Ahab died , Moab rebelled against Israel .
CEB	2%20Kings	1	3	But the Lord ’ s messenger said to Elijah from Tishbe , “ Go , intercept the messengers of Samaria ’ s king , and ask them , ‘ Is it because there ’ s no God in Israel that you are going to question Ekron ’ s god Baal-zebub ?
CEB	2%20Kings	1	4	This is what the Lord says : You will never get out of the bed you are lying in ; you will die for sure ! ’ ” So Elijah set off .
CEB	2%20Kings	1	5	The messengers returned to Ahaziah . He said to them , “ Why have you come back ? ”
CEB	2%20Kings	1	6	They said to him , “ A man met us and said , ‘ Go back to the king who sent you . Say to him , This is what the Lord says : Is it because there ’ s no God in Israel that you ’ ve come to question Ekron ’ s god Baal-zebub ? Because of this , you will never get out of the bed you are lying in ; you will die for sure ! ’ ”
CEB	2%20Kings	1	7	Ahaziah said to them , “ Describe the man who met you and said these things. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	1	8	They said to him , “ He wore clothes made of hair [ a ] with a leather belt around his waist. ” Ahaziah said , “ That was Elijah from Tishbe. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	1	9	So Ahaziah sent out a commander with fifty soldiers . The commander met up with Elijah while he was sitting on a hilltop . The commander said , “ Man of God , the king says , ‘ Come down ! ’ ”
CEB	2%20Kings	1	10	Elijah replied to the commander of the fifty soldiers , “ If I really am a man of God , may fire come down from the sky and burn up you and your fifty soldiers. ” Then fire came down from the sky and burned up the commander and his fifty soldiers .
CEB	2%20Kings	1	11	Ahaziah then sent another commander with fifty soldiers . The commander said to Elijah , “ Man of God , this is what the king says : ‘ Hurry and come down ! ’ ”
CEB	2%20Kings	1	12	Elijah said to them , “ If I really am a man of God , may fire come down from the sky and burn up you and your fifty soldiers. ” Then God ’ s fire came down from the sky and burned up the commander and his fifty soldiers .
CEB	2%20Kings	1	13	For a third time Ahaziah sent a commander with fifty soldiers . So the third commander arrived . He kneeled before Elijah and begged him , “ Man of God ! Please have some regard for my life and the lives of these fifty soldiers who are your servants .
CEB	2%20Kings	1	14	Look , fire came from the sky and burned up the two earlier commanders and their troops of fifty soldiers . Please have regard for my life. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	1	15	Then the Lord ’ s messenger said to Elijah , “ Go down with him . Don ’ t be afraid of him. ” So Elijah set out to go with him to the king .
CEB	2%20Kings	1	16	Elijah said to the king : “ This is what the Lord says : Why did you send messengers to question Ekron ’ s god Baal-zebub ? Is there no God in Israel whose word you could seek ? Because of this , you won ’ t ever get out of the bed you are lying in ; you ’ ll die for sure ! ”
CEB	2%20Kings	1	17	So Ahaziah died in agreement with the Lord ’ s word that Elijah had spoken . Because Ahaziah had no son , Joram [ b ] became king after him in the second year of Judah ’ s King Jehoram , who was Jehoshaphat ’ s son .

CEB	2%20Kings	2	2	Elijah said to Elisha , “ Stay here , because the Lord has sent me to Bethel. ” But Elisha said , “ As the Lord lives and as you live , I won ’ t leave you. ” So they went down to Bethel .
CEB	2%20Kings	2	3	The group of prophets from Bethel came out to Elisha . These prophets said to Elisha , “ Do you know that the Lord is going to take your master away from you today ? ” Elisha said , “ Yes , I know . Don ’ t talk about it ! ”
CEB	2%20Kings	2	4	Elijah said , “ Elisha , stay here , because the Lord has sent me to Jericho. ” But Elisha said , “ As the Lord lives and as you live , I won ’ t leave you. ” So they went to Jericho .
CEB	2%20Kings	2	5	The group of prophets from Jericho approached Elisha and said to him , “ Do you know that the Lord is going to take your master away from you today ? ” He said , “ Yes , I know . Don ’ t talk about it ! ”
CEB	2%20Kings	2	6	Elijah said to Elisha , “ Stay here , because the Lord has sent me to the Jordan. ” But Elisha said , “ As the Lord lives and as you live , I won ’ t leave you. ” So both of them went on together .
CEB	2%20Kings	2	7	Fifty members from the group of prophets also went along , but they stood at a distance . Both Elijah and Elisha stood beside the Jordan River .
CEB	2%20Kings	2	8	Elijah then took his coat , rolled it up , and hit the water . Then the water was divided in two ! Both of them crossed over on dry ground .
CEB	2%20Kings	2	9	When they had crossed , Elijah said to Elisha , “ What do you want me to do for you before I ’ m taken away from you ? ” Elisha said , “ Let me have twice your spirit. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	2	10	Elijah said , “ You ’ ve made a difficult request . If you can see me when I ’ m taken from you , then it will be yours . If you don ’ t see me , it won ’ t happen. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	2	11	They were walking along , talking , when suddenly a fiery chariot and fiery horses appeared and separated the two of them . Then Elijah went to heaven in a windstorm .
CEB	2%20Kings	2	12	Elisha was watching , and he cried out , “ Oh , my father , my father ! Israel ’ s chariots and its riders ! ” When he could no longer see him , Elisha took hold of his clothes and ripped them in two . Elisha succeeds Elijah
CEB	2%20Kings	2	13	Then Elisha picked up the coat that had fallen from Elijah . He went back and stood beside the banks of the Jordan River .
CEB	2%20Kings	2	14	He took the coat that had fallen from Elijah and hit the water . He said , “ Where is the Lord , Elijah ’ s God ? ” And when he hit the water , it divided in two ! Then Elisha crossed over .
CEB	2%20Kings	2	15	The group of prophets from Jericho saw him from a distance . They said , “ Elijah ’ s spirit has settled on Elisha ! ” So they came out to meet him , bowing down before him .
CEB	2%20Kings	2	16	“ Look , ” they told him , “ there are fifty strong men among us , your servants . Please let them go and search for your master . Perhaps the Lord ’ s spirit has picked him up and put him down on some mountain or in some valley. ” Elisha said , “ Don ’ t send them. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	2	17	They insisted until he became embarrassed and said , “ Okay , send them. ” So they sent fifty men who searched for three days . But they couldn ’ t find Elijah .
CEB	2%20Kings	2	18	When these men returned to Elisha , who was staying in Jericho , he said to them , “ Didn ’ t I tell you not to go ? ”
CEB	2%20Kings	2	19	The citizens said to Elisha , “ As you can see , sir , this city is in a good location , but the water is bad , and the land causes miscarriages. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	2	20	He said , “ Bring me a new bowl , and put some salt in it. ” They did so .
CEB	2%20Kings	2	21	Elisha then went out and threw salt into the spring . He said , “ This is what the Lord has said : I have purified this water . It will no longer cause death and miscarriage. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	2	22	The water has stayed pure right up to this very day , in agreement with the word that Elisha spoke . Elisha and the bears
CEB	2%20Kings	2	23	Elisha went up from there to Bethel . As he was going up the road , some young people came out of the city . They mocked him : “ Get going , Baldy ! Get going , Baldy ! ”
CEB	2%20Kings	2	24	Turning around , Elisha looked at them and cursed them in the Lord ’ s name . Then two bears came out of the woods and mangled forty-two of the youths .
CEB	2%20Kings	2	25	From there Elisha went to Mount Carmel and then back to Samaria .
CEB	2%20Kings	3	2	Kings 3:25 Heb uncertain
CEB	2%20Kings	3	3	But he nevertheless clung to the sins that Jeroboam , Nebat ’ s son , had caused Israel to commit . He didn ’ t deviate from them .
CEB	2%20Kings	3	4	Now Moab ’ s King Mesha kept sheep . He would pay Israel ’ s king one hundred thousand lambs and the wool from one hundred thousand rams .
CEB	2%20Kings	3	5	But when Ahab died , Moab ’ s king rebelled against Israel ’ s king .
CEB	2%20Kings	3	6	So King Joram set out from Samaria at once . He prepared all Israel for war .
CEB	2%20Kings	3	7	He sent word to Judah ’ s King Jehoshaphat , “ Moab ’ s king has rebelled against me . Will you go with me to fight against Moab ? ” Jehoshaphat responded , “ Yes , I ’ ll go . We ’ ll fight as one : you and I , our troops and our horses. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	3	8	“ Which road should we take ? ” Joram asked . Jehoshaphat responded , “ The road that goes through the Edomite wilderness. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	3	9	So Israel ’ s and Judah ’ s kings set out with the king of Edom . They marched around for seven days until there was no water left for the army or for the animals with them .
CEB	2%20Kings	3	10	Israel ’ s king said , “ This is terrible ! Has the Lord brought us three kings together only to hand us over to Moab ? ”
CEB	2%20Kings	3	11	Jehoshaphat said , “ Isn ’ t there any prophet of the Lord around , so we could question the Lord through him ? ” One of the servants of Israel ’ s king answered , “ Elisha , Shaphat ’ s son , is here . He used to pour water on Elijah ’ s hands. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	3	12	Jehoshaphat said , “ He has the Lord ’ s word ! ” So Israel ’ s king and Jehoshaphat and Edom ’ s king went down to see Elisha .
CEB	2%20Kings	3	13	Elisha said to Israel ’ s king , “ What do we have to do with each other ? Go to your father ’ s or mother ’ s prophets. ” Then Israel ’ s king said to him , “ Don ’ t say that , because it is the Lord who has brought us three kings together—but only to hand us over to Moab ! ”
CEB	2%20Kings	3	14	Elisha said , “ I swear by the life of the Lord of heavenly forces , the one I stand before and serve , if I didn ’ t care about Judah ’ s King Jehoshaphat , I wouldn ’ t notice you or even look at you !
CEB	2%20Kings	3	15	Now bring me a musician. ” While the musician played , the Lord ’ s power came over Elisha .
CEB	2%20Kings	3	16	He said , “ This is what the Lord says : This valley will be filled with pools . [ b ]
CEB	2%20Kings	3	17	This is what the Lord says : You won ’ t see any wind or rain , but that valley will be full of water . Then you ’ ll be able to drink—you , your cattle , and your animals .
CEB	2%20Kings	3	18	This is easy for the Lord to do . He will also hand Moab over to you .
CEB	2%20Kings	3	19	You will then attack every fort and every grand city , cutting down all the good trees , stopping up all the springs , and ruining the good fields with stones. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	3	20	The next morning , at the time to offer the grain offering , water came flowing from the direction of Edom . The land filled up with water .
CEB	2%20Kings	3	21	Now all the Moabites had heard how these kings had come to fight against them . So all who were able to fight were summoned , and they took up positions along the border .
CEB	2%20Kings	3	22	They got up early in the morning as the sun ’ s rays shone on the water . The Moabites saw the water from a distance . It looked as red as blood .
CEB	2%20Kings	3	23	They said , “ It ’ s blood ! The kings must have fought each other and killed themselves ! Now get the plunder , Moab ! ”
CEB	2%20Kings	3	24	But when they entered Israel ’ s camp , the Israelites rose up and attacked the Moabites . The Moabites fled from them . Israel moved forward , striking the Moabites down as they went . [ c ]
CEB	2%20Kings	3	25	Then the Israelites destroyed the Moabite cities . Each Israelite threw a stone on every piece of good land until it was covered . They stopped up every spring and cut down every good tree . Only Kir-hareseth remained with its stone wall intact , [ d ] but then stone throwers [ e ] surrounded it and attacked it .
CEB	2%20Kings	3	26	Moab ’ s king saw that he was losing the battle . So he took seven hundred soldiers with him , each with sword in hand , to break through to Edom ’ s king . But they failed .
CEB	2%20Kings	3	27	Then he took his oldest son , who was to succeed him as king , and he offered him on the wall as an entirely burned offering . As a result , outrage was expressed by Israel . So they pulled back from Moab ’ s king and returned to their own country . Footnotes -

CEB	2%20Kings	4	4	Then go in and close the door behind you and your sons . Pour oil into all those containers . Set each one aside when it ’ s full. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	4	3	He said , “ Go out and borrow containers from all your neighbors . Get as many empty containers as possible .
CEB	2%20Kings	4	5	She left Elisha and closed the door behind her and her sons . They brought her containers as she kept on pouring .
CEB	2%20Kings	4	6	When she had filled the containers , she said to her son , “ Bring me another container. ” He said to her , “ There aren ’ t any more. ” Then the oil stopped flowing ,
CEB	2%20Kings	4	7	and she reported this to the man of God . He said , “ Go ! Sell the oil and pay your debts . You and your sons can live on what remains. ” A rich woman
CEB	2%20Kings	4	8	One day Elisha went to Shunem . A rich woman lived there . She urged him to eat something , so whenever he passed by , he would stop in to eat some food .
CEB	2%20Kings	4	9	She said to her husband , “ Look , I know that he is a holy man of God and he passes by regularly .
CEB	2%20Kings	4	10	Let ’ s make a small room on the roof . We ’ ll set up a bed , a table , a chair , and a lamp for him there . Then when he comes to us , he can stay there. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	4	11	So one day Elisha came there , headed to the room on the roof , and lay down .
CEB	2%20Kings	4	12	He said to his servant Gehazi , “ Call this Shunammite woman. ” Gehazi called her , and she stood before him .
CEB	2%20Kings	4	13	Elisha then said to Gehazi , “ Say to her , ‘ Look , you ’ ve gone to all this trouble for us . What can I do for you ? Is there anything I can say on your behalf to the king or to the commander of the army ? ’ ” She said , “ I ’ m content to live at home with my own people. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	4	14	Elisha asked , “ So what can be done for her ? ” Gehazi said , “ Well , she doesn ’ t have a son , and her husband is old. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	4	15	Elisha said , “ Call her. ” So Gehazi called her , and she stood at the door .
CEB	2%20Kings	4	16	Elisha said , “ About this time next year , you will be holding a son in your arms. ” But she said , “ No , man of God , sir ; don ’ t lie to your servant. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	4	17	But the woman conceived and gave birth to a son at about the same time the next year . This was what Elisha had promised her .
CEB	2%20Kings	4	18	The child grew up . One day he ran to his father , who was with the harvest workers .
CEB	2%20Kings	4	19	He said to his father , “ Oh , my head ! My head ! ” The father said to a young man , “ Carry him to his mother. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	4	20	So he picked up the boy and brought him to his mother . The boy sat on her lap until noon . Then he died .
CEB	2%20Kings	4	21	She went up and laid him down on the bed for the man of God . Then she went out and closed the door .
CEB	2%20Kings	4	22	She called her husband and said , “ Send me one of the young men and one of the donkeys so that I can hurry to the man of God and come back. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	4	23	Her husband said , “ Why are you going to him today ? It ’ s not a new moon or sabbath. ” She said , “ Don ’ t worry about it. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	4	24	She saddled the donkey , then said to her young servant , “ Drive the donkey hard . Don ’ t let me slow down unless I tell you. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	4	25	So she went off and came to the man of God at Mount Carmel . As soon as the man of God saw her from a distance , he said to Gehazi his servant , “ Look , it ’ s the Shunammite woman !
CEB	2%20Kings	4	26	Run out to meet her and ask her , ‘ Are things okay with you , your husband , and your child ? ’ ” She said , “ Things are okay. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	4	27	When she got to the man of God at the mountain , she grabbed his feet . Gehazi came up to push her away , but the man of God said , “ Leave her alone ! She is distraught , but the Lord has hidden the reason from me and hasn ’ t told me why. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	4	28	She said , “ Did I ask you for a son , sir ? Didn ’ t I say , ‘ Don ’ t raise my hopes ’ ? ”
CEB	2%20Kings	4	29	Elisha said to Gehazi , “ Get ready , take my staff , and go ! If you encounter anyone , don ’ t stop to greet them . If anyone greets you , don ’ t reply . Put my staff on the boy ’ s face. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	4	30	But the boy ’ s mother said , “ I swear by your life and by the Lord ’ s life , I won ’ t leave you ! ” So Elisha got up and followed her .
CEB	2%20Kings	4	31	Gehazi went on ahead of them . He set the staff on the young boy ’ s face , but there was no sound or response . So he went back to meet Elisha and told him , “ The boy didn ’ t wake up. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	4	32	Elisha came into the house and saw the boy lying dead on his bed .
CEB	2%20Kings	4	33	He went in and closed the door behind the two of them . Then he prayed to the Lord .
CEB	2%20Kings	4	34	He got up on the bed and lay down on top of the child , putting his mouth on the boy ’ s mouth , his eyes on the boy ’ s eyes , his hands on the boy ’ s hands . And as he bent over him , the child ’ s skin grew warm .
CEB	2%20Kings	4	35	Then Elisha got down and paced back and forth in the house . Once again he got up on the bed and bent over the boy , at which point the boy sneezed [ a ] seven times and opened his eyes .
CEB	2%20Kings	4	36	Elisha called for Gehazi and said , “ Call the Shunammite woman. ” Gehazi called her , and she came to Elisha . He told her , “ Pick up your son. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	4	37	She came and fell at his feet , facedown on the ground . Then she picked up her son and left . Miracles with food
CEB	2%20Kings	4	38	When Elisha returned to Gilgal , there was a famine in the land . A group of prophets was sitting before him . He said to his servant , “ Put on the big pot and cook some stew for the prophets. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	4	39	So one of them went out to the field to gather plants ; he found a wild vine and gathered wild gourds from it , filling his garment . He came and cut them up into the pot of stew , but no one knew what they were .
CEB	2%20Kings	4	40	The stew was served to the men , but as they started to eat it , they cried out and said , “ There is death in that pot , man of God ! ” They couldn ’ t eat it .
CEB	2%20Kings	4	41	Elisha said , “ Get some flour. ” He threw it into the pot and said , “ Serve the people so they can eat. ” At that point , there was nothing bad left in the pot .
CEB	2%20Kings	4	42	A man came from Baal-shalishah , bringing the man of God some bread from the early produce—twenty loaves of barley bread and fresh grain from his bag . [ b ] Elisha said , “ Give it to the people so they can eat. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	4	43	His servant said , “ How can I feed one hundred men with this ? ” Elisha said , “ Give it to the people so they can eat ! This is what the Lord says : ‘ Eat and there will be leftovers. ’ ”
CEB	2%20Kings	4	44	So the servant gave the food to them . They ate and had leftovers , in agreement with the Lord ’ s word . Footnotes -
CEB	2%20Kings	5	2	Kings 5:26 LXX ; MT lacks along with you .
CEB	2%20Kings	5	5	Then Aram ’ s king said , “ Go ahead . I will send a letter to Israel ’ s king. ” So Naaman left . He took along ten kikkars of silver , six thousand shekels of gold , and ten changes of clothing .
CEB	2%20Kings	5	3	She said to her mistress , “ I wish that my master could come before the prophet who lives in Samaria . He would cure him of his skin disease. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	5	4	So Naaman went and told his master what the young girl from the land of Israel had said .
CEB	2%20Kings	5	6	He brought the letter to Israel ’ s king . It read , “ Along with this letter I ’ m sending you my servant Naaman so you can cure him of his skin disease. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	5	7	When the king of Israel read the letter , he ripped his clothes . He said , “ What ? Am I God to hand out death and life ? But this king writes me , asking me to cure someone of his skin disease ! You must realize that he wants to start a fight with me. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	5	8	When Elisha the man of God heard that Israel ’ s king had ripped his clothes , he sent word to the king : “ Why did you rip your clothes ? Let the man come to me . Then he ’ ll know that there ’ s a prophet in Israel. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	5	9	Naaman arrived with his horses and chariots . He stopped at the door of Elisha ’ s house .
CEB	2%20Kings	5	10	Elisha sent out a messenger who said , “ Go and wash seven times in the Jordan River . Then your skin will be restored and become clean. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	5	11	But Naaman went away in anger . He said , “ I thought for sure that he ’ d come out , stand and call on the name of the Lord his God , wave his hand over the bad spot , and cure the skin disease .
CEB	2%20Kings	5	12	Aren ’ t the rivers in Damascus , the Abana [ b ] and the Pharpar , better than all Israel ’ s waters ? Couldn ’ t I wash in them and get clean ? ” So he turned away and proceeded to leave in anger .
CEB	2%20Kings	5	13	Naaman ’ s servants came up to him and spoke to him : “ Our father , if the prophet had told you to do something difficult , wouldn ’ t you have done it ? All he said to you was , ‘ Wash and become clean. ’ ”
CEB	2%20Kings	5	14	So Naaman went down and bathed in the Jordan seven times , just as the man of God had said . His skin was restored like that of a young boy , and he became clean .
CEB	2%20Kings	5	15	He returned to the man of God with all his attendants . He came and stood before Elisha , saying , “ Now I know for certain that there ’ s no God anywhere on earth except in Israel . Please accept a gift from your servant. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	5	16	But Elisha said , “ I swear by the life of the Lord I serve that I won ’ t accept anything. ” Naaman urged Elisha to accept something , but he still refused .
CEB	2%20Kings	5	17	Then Naaman said , “ If not , then let me , your servant , have two mule loads of earth . Your servant will never again offer entirely burned offerings or sacrifices to any other gods except the Lord .
CEB	2%20Kings	5	18	But may the Lord forgive your servant for this one thing : When my master comes into Rimmon ’ s temple to bow down there and is leaning on my arm , I must also bow down in Rimmon ’ s temple . When I bow down in Rimmon ’ s temple , may the Lord forgive your servant for doing that. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	5	19	Elisha said to him , “ Go in peace. ” But when Naaman had gone some distance from Elisha ,
CEB	2%20Kings	5	20	Gehazi ( who was the servant of Elisha the man of God ) thought , My master let this Aramean Naaman off the hook by not accepting the gift he brought ! As surely as the Lord lives , I ’ ll go after him and accept something from him .
CEB	2%20Kings	5	21	So Gehazi pursued Naaman . Naaman saw him running after him , so he got down off his chariot to meet him . He said , “ Is everything okay ? ”
CEB	2%20Kings	5	22	Gehazi answered , “ Yes , but my master sent me to say , ‘ Two young men who are members of a group of prophets have just now come to me from the hills of Ephraim . Give them a kikkar of silver and two changes of clothing. ’ ”
CEB	2%20Kings	5	23	Naaman said , “ By all means , take two kikkars ! ” He encouraged Gehazi to accept them . He tied two kikkars of silver up in two bags , along with two changes of clothes . Naaman gave them to two of his servants , and they carried them in front of Gehazi .
CEB	2%20Kings	5	24	When Gehazi arrived at the elevated fortress , [ c ] he took the items from them and stored them in his house . Then he sent the servants away , and they left .
CEB	2%20Kings	5	25	Gehazi then went and stood before his master . Elisha said to Gehazi , “ Where did you come from , Gehazi ? ” “ Your servant didn ’ t go anywhere , ” Gehazi replied .
CEB	2%20Kings	5	26	Elisha said to him , “ Wasn ’ t my heart going along with you [ d ] when the man got off his chariot to meet you ? Is this the time to accept silver , clothes , olive trees , vineyards , sheep , cattle , or male and female servants ?
CEB	2%20Kings	5	27	Naaman ’ s skin disease will now cling to you and to your descendants forever ! ” And Gehazi left Elisha ’ s presence , flaky like snow with skin disease . Footnotes -
CEB	2%20Kings	6	2	Kings 6:33 Or perhaps the king ; cf 7:2
CEB	2%20Kings	6	6	The man of God said , “ Where did it fall ? ” He showed Elisha the place . Elisha then cut a piece of wood , threw it into the river there , and the ax head floated up .
CEB	2%20Kings	6	3	One of them said , “ Please come with us , your servants. ” Elisha said , “ Okay , I ’ ll go. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	6	4	So he went with them . They came to the Jordan River and began cutting down trees .
CEB	2%20Kings	6	5	One of them was cutting down a tree when his ax head fell into the water . He cried out , “ Oh , no ! Master , it was a borrowed ax ! ”
CEB	2%20Kings	6	7	“ Lift it out , ” Elisha said . So the man then reached out and grabbed it . Aramean attacks are stopped
CEB	2%20Kings	6	8	Aram ’ s king was fighting against Israel . He took counsel with his officers , saying , “ I ’ ll camp at such-and-such a place. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	6	9	The man of God sent word to Israel ’ s king : “ Beware of passing by this place because the Arameans are going down there. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	6	10	Then Israel ’ s king sent word to the place the man of God had mentioned to him . Time after time , Elisha warned the king , and the king stayed on the alert .
CEB	2%20Kings	6	11	Aram ’ s king was extremely upset about this . He called his officers and said to them , “ Tell me ! Who among us is siding with Israel ’ s king ? ”
CEB	2%20Kings	6	12	One of his officers said , “ No one , Your Majesty ! It ’ s Elisha the Israelite prophet who tells Israel ’ s king the words that you speak in the privacy of your bedroom. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	6	13	He said , “ Go and find out where he is . Then I will send men to capture him. ” They told him , “ He is in Dothan. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	6	14	So the king sent horses and chariots there with a strong army . They came at night and surrounded the city .
CEB	2%20Kings	6	15	Elisha ’ s servant got up early and went out . He saw an army with horses and chariots surrounding the city . His servant said to Elisha , “ Oh , no ! Master , what will we do ? ”
CEB	2%20Kings	6	16	“ Don ’ t be afraid , ” Elisha said , “ because there are more of us than there are of them. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	6	17	Then Elisha prayed , “ Lord , please open his eyes that he may see. ” Then the Lord opened the servant ’ s eyes , and he saw that the mountain was full of horses and fiery chariots surrounding Elisha .
CEB	2%20Kings	6	18	The Arameans came toward him , so Elisha prayed to the Lord , “ Strike this nation with blindness. ” And the Lord struck them blind , just as Elisha asked .
CEB	2%20Kings	6	19	Elisha said to them , “ This isn ’ t the right road or the right city . Follow me , and I ’ ll lead you to the man you are looking for. ” But he took them to Samaria !
CEB	2%20Kings	6	20	When they arrived in Samaria , Elisha said , “ Lord , open the eyes of these men so they can see. ” The Lord opened their eyes , and they saw that they were right in the middle of Samaria !
CEB	2%20Kings	6	21	When he saw them , Israel ’ s king said to Elisha , “ Should I kill them , my father ? Should I ? ”
CEB	2%20Kings	6	22	He said , “ No , don ’ t kill them . Did you capture them with your own sword or bow ? Do you have the right to kill them ? [ a ] Put food and water in front of them so they can eat and drink and return to their master. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	6	23	So the king gave them a great feast , and they ate and drank . Then the king let them go , and they returned to their master . After that , Aramean raiding parties didn ’ t come into Israel anymore . Ben-hadad attacks Samaria
CEB	2%20Kings	6	24	Now it happened later that Aram ’ s King Ben-hadad gathered all his forces and went up to attack Samaria .
CEB	2%20Kings	6	25	The siege lasted so long that there was a great famine in Samaria . A donkey ’ s head sold for eighty shekels of silver and a quarter kab of doves ’ dung [ b ] for five shekels .
CEB	2%20Kings	6	26	Israel ’ s king was passing by on the city wall when a woman appealed to him , “ Help me , Your Majesty ! ”
CEB	2%20Kings	6	27	The king said , “ No ! May the Lord help you ! Where can I find help for you ? From the threshing floor or the winepress ? ”
CEB	2%20Kings	6	28	But then the king asked her , “ What ’ s troubling you ? ” She answered , “ A woman said to me , ‘ Give up your son so we can eat him today ; we ’ ll eat my son tomorrow. ’
CEB	2%20Kings	6	29	So we cooked and ate my son . The next day I said to her , ‘ Hand over your son so we can eat him. ’ But she had hidden her son. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	6	30	When the king heard the woman ’ s story , he ripped his clothes . And as he passed by along the wall , the people could see that he was wearing mourning clothes underneath .
CEB	2%20Kings	6	31	He said , “ So may God do to me , and more , if the head of Elisha , Shaphat ’ s son , remains on his shoulders today ! ”
CEB	2%20Kings	6	32	Elisha was sitting in his house , and the elders were sitting with him . The king sent a messenger on ahead , but before the man arrived , Elisha said to the elders , “ Do you see that this murderer has sent someone to cut off my head ? Watch for when the messenger comes , then close the door and hold it shut against him . The sound of his master ’ s feet is right behind him , isn ’ t it ? ”
CEB	2%20Kings	6	33	While Elisha was still speaking with them , the messenger [ c ] arrived and said , “ Look , this disaster is the Lord ’ s doing . Why should I trust the Lord any longer ? ” Footnotes -
CEB	2%20Kings	7	2	Kings 7:13 Heb uncertain
CEB	2%20Kings	7	7	So they had got up and fled in the evening , leaving their tents , horses , and donkeys . They left the camp exactly as it was and ran for their lives .
CEB	2%20Kings	7	3	Now there were four men with skin disease [ b ] at the entrance to the city . They said to each other , “ What are we doing sitting here until we die ?
CEB	2%20Kings	7	4	If we decide , ‘ Let ’ s go into the city , ’ the famine is there , and we ’ ll die in the city . But if we stay here , we ’ ll die just the same . So let ’ s go and surrender to the Aramean camp . If they let us live , we ’ ll live . If they kill us , we ’ ll die. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	7	5	So they set out in the evening to the Aramean camp , and they came to the edge of the camp . But there was no one there because
CEB	2%20Kings	7	6	the Lord had made the Aramean camp hear the sound of chariots , horses , and a strong army . They had said to each other , “ Listen ! Israel ’ s king has hired the Hittite and Egyptian kings to come against us ! ”
CEB	2%20Kings	7	8	So these men with skin disease came to the edge of the camp . They entered a tent where they ate and drank . They carried off some silver , gold , and garments , and they hid them . Then they returned and went into another tent . They took more things from there , went away , and hid them .
CEB	2%20Kings	7	9	But then they said to each other , “ What we ’ re doing isn ’ t right . Today is a day of good news , but we ’ re keeping quiet about it . If we wait until dawn , something bad will happen to us . Come on ! Let ’ s go and tell the palace. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	7	10	So they went and called out to the gatekeepers , telling them , “ We went to the Aramean camp , and listen to this : No one was there , not even the sound of anyone ! The only things there were tied-up horses and donkeys , and the tents left just as they were. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	7	11	The gatekeepers shouted out the news , and it was reported within the palace .
CEB	2%20Kings	7	12	The king got up in the night . He said to his servants , “ Let me tell you what the Arameans are doing to us . They know we are starving , so they ’ ve left the camp to hide in the fields . They are thinking , The Israelites will come out from the city , and then we ’ ll capture them alive and invade the city. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	7	13	But one of his servants answered , “ Please let some men take five of the horses that are left , and let ’ s send them out to see what happens . They are in the same situation as the large number of Israelites who are left here ; they are no better off than the large number of Israelites who ’ ve already perished. ” [ c ]
CEB	2%20Kings	7	14	So they chose two chariots with their horses . The king sent them after the Aramean army , saying , “ Go and see ! ”
CEB	2%20Kings	7	15	So they went after the Arameans as far as the Jordan River . The road was filled the whole way with garments and equipment that the Arameans had thrown away in their rush . The messengers returned and reported this to the king .
CEB	2%20Kings	7	16	Then the people went out and looted the Aramean camp . And so it happened that a seah of wheat flour did sell for a shekel , and two seahs of barley sold for a shekel , in agreement with the Lord ’ s word .
CEB	2%20Kings	7	17	But the king had put the officer whom he leaned on for support in charge of the city gate . The people trampled the officer at the gate , and he died . This was just what the man of God said when the king had come down to him .
CEB	2%20Kings	7	18	Because when the man of God said to the king , “ At this time tomorrow two seahs of barley will sell for a shekel at Samaria ’ s gate , and one seah of wheat flour will sell for a shekel , ”
CEB	2%20Kings	7	19	the officer had answered the man of God , “ Come on ! Even if the Lord should make windows in the sky , how could that happen ? ” Then Elisha had said , “ You will see it with your own eyes , but you won ’ t eat from it. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	7	20	That ’ s exactly what happened to him . The people trampled him at the city gate , and he died . Footnotes -

CEB	2%20Kings	8	8	So the king said to Hazael , “ Take a gift with you and go to meet the man of God . Question the Lord through him : ‘ Will I recover from this sickness ? ’ ”
CEB	2%20Kings	8	3	When seven years had passed , the woman returned from Philistia . She went to appeal to the king for her house and her farmland .
CEB	2%20Kings	8	4	The king was speaking to Gehazi , the man of God ’ s servant , asking him , “ Tell me about all the great things Elisha has done. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	8	5	So Gehazi was telling the king how Elisha had brought the dead to life . At that very moment , the woman whose son he had brought back to life began to appeal to the king for her house and her farmland . Gehazi said , “ Your Majesty , this is the woman herself ! And this is her son , the one Elisha brought to life ! ”
CEB	2%20Kings	8	6	The king questioned the woman , and she told him her story . Then the king appointed an official to help her , saying , “ Return everything that belongs to her , as well as everything that the farmland has produced , starting from the day she left the country until right now. ” Hazael becomes king
CEB	2%20Kings	8	7	Now Elisha had gone to Damascus when Aram ’ s King Ben-hadad became sick . The king was told , “ The man of God has come all this way. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	8	9	So Hazael went out to meet Elisha . He took along forty camel-loads of Damascus ’ finest goods as a gift . He came and stood before Elisha and said , “ Your son Ben-hadad , the king of Aram , sent me to you to ask , ‘ Will I recover from this sickness ? ’ ”
CEB	2%20Kings	8	10	Elisha said to him , “ Go and tell him , ‘ You will definitely recover , ’ but actually the Lord has shown me that he will die. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	8	11	Elisha stared straight at Hazael until he felt uneasy . [ a ] Then the man of God began to cry .
CEB	2%20Kings	8	12	Hazael said , “ Master , why are you crying ? ” “ Because I know what violence you will do to the Israelites , ” Elisha said . “ You will drive them from their forts with fire . You will kill their young men with the sword . You will smash their children and rip open their pregnant women. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	8	13	Hazael replied , “ How could your servant , who is nothing but a dog , do such mighty things ? ” Elisha said , “ The Lord has shown me that you will be king over Aram. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	8	14	Then Hazael left Elisha and returned to his master . “ What did Elisha say to you ? ” Ben-hadad asked . “ He told me that you will certainly live , ” Hazael replied .
CEB	2%20Kings	8	15	But the next day he took a blanket , soaked it in water , and put it over Ben-hadad ’ s face until he died . Hazael succeeded him as king . Jehoram rules Judah
CEB	2%20Kings	8	16	In the fifth year of Israel ’ s King Joram , Ahab ’ s son , Jehoram , the son of Judah ’ s King Jehoshaphat , became king . [ b ]
CEB	2%20Kings	8	17	He was
CEB	2%20Kings	8	32	years old when he became king , and he ruled for eight years in Jerusalem .
CEB	2%20Kings	8	18	He walked in the ways of Israel ’ s kings , just as Ahab ’ s dynasty had done , because he married Ahab ’ s daughter . He did what was evil in the Lord ’ s eyes .
CEB	2%20Kings	8	19	Nevertheless , because of his servant David , the Lord wasn ’ t willing to destroy Judah . The Lord had promised to preserve a lamp for David and his sons forever .
CEB	2%20Kings	8	20	During Jehoram ’ s rule Edom rebelled against Judah ’ s power and appointed their own king .
CEB	2%20Kings	8	21	Jehoram [ c ] along with all his chariots crossed over to Zair . He got up at night to attack the Edomites who had surrounded him and his chariot commanders , [ d ] but his army fled back home .
CEB	2%20Kings	8	22	years old when he became king , and he ruled for one year in Jerusalem . His mother ’ s name was Athaliah ; she was the granddaughter of Israel ’ s King Omri .
CEB	2%20Kings	8	23	The rest of Jehoram ’ s deeds and all that he accomplished , aren ’ t they written in the official records of Judah ’ s kings ?
CEB	2%20Kings	8	24	Jehoram died and was buried with his ancestors in David ’ s City . His son Ahaziah succeeded him as king . Ahaziah rules Judah
CEB	2%20Kings	8	25	Ahaziah , the son of Judah ’ s king Jehoram , became king in the twelfth year of Israel ’ s King Joram , [ e ] Ahab ’ s son .
CEB	2%20Kings	8	26	Ahaziah was
CEB	2%20Kings	8	27	He walked in the ways of Ahab ’ s dynasty , doing what was evil in the Lord ’ s eyes , just as Ahab ’ s dynasty had done , because he had married into Ahab ’ s family .
CEB	2%20Kings	8	28	Ahaziah went with Joram , Ahab ’ s son , to fight against Aram ’ s King Hazael at Ramoth-gilead , where the Arameans wounded Joram .
CEB	2%20Kings	8	29	King Joram returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds the Arameans had given him at Ramah in his battle with Aram ’ s King Hazael . Then Judah ’ s King Ahaziah , the son of Jehoram , went down to visit Joram , Ahab ’ s son , at Jezreel because he had been wounded . Footnotes -

CEB	2%20Kings	9	3	Take the jug of oil and pour it on his head . Then say , ‘ This is what the Lord has said : I anoint you king of Israel. ’ Then open the door , and run out of there without stopping. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	9	4	So the young prophet went to Ramoth-gilead .
CEB	2%20Kings	9	5	He came in , and the military commanders were sitting right there . He said , “ Commander , I have a word for you. ” “ For which one of us ? ” Jehu asked . The young prophet said , “ For you , Commander. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	9	6	So Jehu got up and went inside . The prophet then poured oil on his head and said to him , “ This is what the Lord , Israel ’ s God , says : I anoint you king over the Lord ’ s people , over Israel .
CEB	2%20Kings	9	7	You will strike down your master Ahab ’ s family . In this way I will take revenge for the violence done by Jezebel to my servants the prophets and to all the Lord ’ s servants .
CEB	2%20Kings	9	8	Ahab ’ s whole family will die . I will eliminate from Ahab everyone who urinates on a wall , whether slave or free , in Israel .
CEB	2%20Kings	9	10	And as for Jezebel : The dogs will devour her in the area of Jezreel . No one will bury her. ” Then the young prophet opened the door and ran .
CEB	2%20Kings	9	11	Jehu went out to his master ’ s officers . They said to him , “ Is everything okay ? Why did this fanatic come to you ? ” Jehu said to them , “ You know the man and the nonsense he talks. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	9	12	“ That ’ s a lie ! ” they said . “ Come on , tell us ! ” Jehu replied , “ This is what he said to me : ‘ This is what the Lord says : I anoint you king of Israel. ’ ”
CEB	2%20Kings	9	13	Then each man quickly took his cloak and put it beneath Jehu on the paved steps . [ a ] They blew a trumpet and said , “ Jehu has become king ! ” Jehu kills his enemies
CEB	2%20Kings	9	14	Then Jehu , Jehoshaphat ’ s son and Nimshi ’ s grandson , plotted against Joram . Now Joram along with all of Israel had been guarding Ramoth-gilead against Aram ’ s King Hazael ,
CEB	2%20Kings	9	15	but King Joram [ b ] had gone back to Jezreel to recover from wounds that the Arameans had given him when he fought Hazael . So Jehu said , “ If this is the way you feel , then don ’ t let anyone escape from the city to talk about it in Jezreel. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	9	16	Then Jehu got on a chariot and drove to Jezreel because Joram was resting there . Judah ’ s King Ahaziah had also come to visit Joram .
CEB	2%20Kings	9	17	The guard standing on the tower at Jezreel saw a crowd of people coming with Jehu . He said , “ I see a crowd of people. ” Joram said , “ Take a chariot driver . Send him out to meet them to ask , ‘ Do you come in peace ? ’ ”
CEB	2%20Kings	9	18	So the driver went to meet him and said , “ The king asks , ‘ Do you come in peace ? ’ ” Jehu replied , “ What do you care about peace ? Come around and follow me. ” Meanwhile , the tower guard reported , “ The messenger met them , but he isn ’ t returning. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	9	19	The king sent a second driver . He came to them and said , “ The king asks , ‘ Do you come in peace ? ’ ” Jehu said , “ What do you care about peace ? Come around and follow me. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	9	20	The tower guard reported , “ The messenger met them , but he isn ’ t returning . And the style of chariot driving is like Jehu , Nimshi ’ s son . Jehu drives like a madman. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	9	21	Joram said , “ Hitch up the chariot ! ” So they hitched up his chariot . Then Israel ’ s King Joram and Judah ’ s King Ahaziah—each in his own chariot—went out to meet Jehu . They happened to meet him at the plot of ground that belonged to Naboth the Jezreelite .
CEB	2%20Kings	9	22	When Joram saw Jehu , he said , “ Do you come in peace , Jehu ? ” He said , “ How can there be peace as long as the immoralities of your mother Jezebel and her many acts of sorcery continue ? ”
CEB	2%20Kings	9	23	Then Joram turned his chariot around and fled . He shouted to Ahaziah , “ It ’ s a trap , Ahaziah ! ”
CEB	2%20Kings	9	24	Jehu took his bow and shot Joram in the back . The arrow went through his heart , and he fell down in his chariot .
CEB	2%20Kings	9	25	Jehu said to Bidkar his chariot officer , “ Pick him up , and throw him on the plot of ground belonging to Naboth the Jezreelite . Remember how you and I were driving chariot teams behind his father Ahab when the Lord spoke this prophecy about him :
CEB	2%20Kings	9	26	Yesterday I saw Naboth ’ s blood and his sons ’ blood , declares the Lord . I swear that I will pay you back on this very plot of ground , declares the Lord . Now pick him up , and throw him on that plot of ground , in agreement with the Lord ’ s word. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	9	27	Judah ’ s King Ahaziah saw this and fled on the road to Beth-haggan . Jehu chased after him . “ Do the same to him ! ” he commanded . They shot him [ c ] in his chariot on the way up to Gur , near Ibleam . Ahaziah fled to Megiddo and died there .
CEB	2%20Kings	9	28	His servants carried him back in a chariot to Jerusalem . He was buried in his tomb with his ancestors in David ’ s City .
CEB	2%20Kings	9	29	Ahaziah had become Judah ’ s king in the eleventh year of Ahab ’ s son Joram .
CEB	2%20Kings	9	30	Jehu then went to Jezreel . When Jezebel heard of it , she put on her eye shadow and arranged her hair . She looked down out of the window .
CEB	2%20Kings	9	31	When Jehu came through the gate , she said , “ Do you come in peace , Zimri , you master murderer ? ”
CEB	2%20Kings	9	32	Jehu looked up to the window and said , “ Who ’ s on my side ? Anyone ? ” Two or three high officials looked down at him .
CEB	2%20Kings	9	33	Then he said , “ Throw her out ! ” So they threw her out of the window . Some of her blood splattered against the wall and on the horses , and they trampled her .
CEB	2%20Kings	9	34	Jehu then went in to eat and drink . He said , “ Deal with this cursed woman and bury her . She was , after all , a king ’ s daughter. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	9	35	They went to bury her , but they couldn ’ t find her body . Only her skull was left , along with her hands and feet .
CEB	2%20Kings	9	36	They went back and reported this to Jehu . He said , “ This is the Lord ’ s word spoken through his servant Elijah from Tishbe : Dogs will devour Jezebel ’ s flesh in the area of Jezreel .
CEB	2%20Kings	9	37	Jezebel ’ s corpse will be like dung spread out in a field in that plot of land in Jezreel , so no one will be able to say , This was Jezebel. ” Footnotes -

CEB	2%20Kings	10	3	look for the best and most capable of your master ’ s sons . Place him on his father ’ s throne . Then fight for your master ’ s family. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	10	4	But they were frozen with fear . They said , “ Not even two kings could resist him ! How can we ? ”
CEB	2%20Kings	10	5	So the palace administrator , the mayor , the elders , and the guardians sent a letter back to Jehu that read , “ We are your servants . We will do whatever you tell us . We won ’ t make anyone king . Do whatever seems right to you. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	10	6	Jehu wrote them a second letter : “ If you are loyal to me and ready to obey me , take the heads of your master ’ s sons and bring them to me at Jezreel at this time tomorrow. ” Now the king ’ s seventy sons were with the city leaders who were raising them .
CEB	2%20Kings	10	7	So when the letter came to them , they took the king ’ s sons and slaughtered all seventy of them . They placed their heads in baskets and sent them to Jehu at Jezreel .
CEB	2%20Kings	10	8	A messenger came and told Jehu , “ They have brought the heads of the king ’ s sons. ” He responded , “ Pile them in two stacks at the entrance of the gate where they will stay until morning. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	10	9	In the morning he went out and stood there to address all the people . “ You are innocent . I ’ m the one who plotted against my master and killed him , but who killed all these people ?
CEB	2%20Kings	10	11	Then Jehu struck down all those belonging to Ahab ’ s family who were left in Jezreel , so that not one of his leaders , close acquaintances , or priests remained .
CEB	2%20Kings	10	12	Next Jehu set out for Samaria . Beth-eked of the Shepherds was on his way .
CEB	2%20Kings	10	13	There Jehu met up with the brothers of Judah ’ s King Ahaziah . “ Who are you ? ” he asked . “ We ’ re Ahaziah ’ s relatives , ” they replied . “ We ’ ve come down for a visit with the king ’ s sons and the queen mother ’ s sons. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	10	14	Jehu then commanded , “ Take them alive ! ” His soldiers took them alive , then slaughtered them at the well of Beth-eked . There were forty-two of them , but not one was left . Jehu kills Baal worshippers
CEB	2%20Kings	10	15	Jehu departed from there and encountered Rechab ’ s son Jehonadab . Jehu greeted him , and asked , “ Are you as committed to me as I am to you ? ” Jehonadab responded , “ Yes , I am. ” “ If so , ” said Jehu , “ then give me your hand. ” So Jehonadab put out his hand , and Jehu pulled him up into the chariot .
CEB	2%20Kings	10	16	Jehu said , “ Come with me and see my zeal for the Lord. ” So Jehu had Jehonadab ride with him in his chariot .
CEB	2%20Kings	10	17	When Jehu arrived in Samaria , he killed all those belonging to Ahab who were left in Samaria until they were completely wiped out , in agreement with the Lord ’ s word that was spoken to Elijah .
CEB	2%20Kings	10	18	Then Jehu gathered all the people , saying to them , “ Ahab served Baal a little . Jehu will serve him a great deal !
CEB	2%20Kings	10	19	So invite all of Baal ’ s prophets , all his worshippers , and all his priests to come to me . Don ’ t leave anyone out , because I have a great sacrifice planned for Baal . Anyone who doesn ’ t show up won ’ t survive. ” But Jehu was lying so that he could wipe out Baal ’ s worshippers .
CEB	2%20Kings	10	20	Jehu called for a holy assembly for Baal , and it was done .
CEB	2%20Kings	10	21	Jehu then sent word throughout Israel . All Baal ’ s worshippers came . No one stayed away . They entered Baal ’ s temple until it was packed from one end to the other .
CEB	2%20Kings	10	22	Then Jehu said to the person in charge of the vestments , “ Bring out the special clothes for all Baal ’ s worshippers. ” So he brought out robes for them .
CEB	2%20Kings	10	23	Then Jehu and Jehonadab , Rechab ’ s son , entered Baal ’ s temple . They said to Baal ’ s worshippers , “ Make sure there are no worshippers of the Lord here with you . There should be only Baal worshippers. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	10	24	Then they went in to offer sacrifices and entirely burned offerings . But Jehu had stationed eighty soldiers outside and told them , “ I ’ m handing these people over to you . Whoever lets even one of them escape will pay for it with his life. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	10	25	So when Jehu finished offering the entirely burned offering , he said to the guards and the officers , “ Go in and kill everyone ! Don ’ t let anyone escape ! ” They killed the Baal worshippers without mercy . The guards and the officers then disposed of the bodies and entered the inner part of Baal ’ s temple .
CEB	2%20Kings	10	26	They brought the sacred pillar [ c ] out of Baal ’ s temple and burned it .
CEB	2%20Kings	10	27	They tore down Baal ’ s sacred pillar and destroyed Baal ’ s temple , turning it into a public restroom , which is what it still is today .
CEB	2%20Kings	10	28	This is how Jehu eliminated Baal from Israel .
CEB	2%20Kings	10	29	However , Jehu didn ’ t deviate from the sins that Jeroboam , Nebat ’ s son , had caused Israel to commit—specifically , the gold calves that were in Bethel and Dan . Jehu rules Israel
CEB	2%20Kings	10	30	The Lord said to Jehu : Because you ’ ve done well by doing what is right in my eyes , treating Ahab ’ s family as I wished , your descendants will sit on Israel ’ s throne for four generations .
CEB	2%20Kings	10	31	But Jehu wasn ’ t careful to keep the Lord God of Israel ’ s Instruction with all his heart . He didn ’ t deviate from the sins that Jeroboam had caused Israel to commit .
CEB	2%20Kings	10	32	In those days the Lord began to reduce Israel ’ s size . Hazael struck them down in every region of Israel :

CEB	2%20Kings	11	5	He commanded them , “ This is what you must do : A third of you coming on sabbath duty will guard the palace ,

CEB	2%20Kings	11	12	Jehoiada then brought out the king ’ s son , crowned him , gave him the royal law , [ e ] and made him king and anointed him , as everyone applauded and cried out , “ Long live the king ! ”
CEB	2%20Kings	11	13	When Athaliah heard the noise made by the guard and the people , she went to the people at the Lord ’ s temple
CEB	2%20Kings	11	14	and saw the king standing by the royal pillar , as was the custom , with the commanders and trumpeters beside the king . All the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets . Athaliah ripped her clothes and screamed , “ Treason ! Treason ! ”
CEB	2%20Kings	11	15	Then the priest Jehoiada ordered the unit commanders who were in charge of the army : “ Take her out under guard , ” [ f ] he told them , “ and kill anyone who follows her. ” This was because the priest had said , “ She must not be executed in the Lord ’ s temple. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	11	16	They arrested her when she reached the entrance of the Horse Gate at the royal palace . She was executed there .
CEB	2%20Kings	11	17	Jehoiada then made a covenant between the Lord , the king , and the people , that the people would belong to the Lord . The king and the people also made a covenant .
CEB	2%20Kings	11	18	Then all the people of the land went to Baal ’ s temple and tore it down , smashing its altars and images into pieces . They executed Mattan , Baal ’ s priest , in front of the altars . The priest Jehoiada posted guards at the Lord ’ s temple .
CEB	2%20Kings	11	19	Then he took the unit commanders , the Carites , the guards , and all the people of the land , and they led the king down from the Lord ’ s temple , processing through the Guards ’ Gate to the palace , where the king sat upon the royal throne .

CEB	2%20Kings	12	3	However , the shrines were not removed . People kept sacrificing and burning incense at them .
CEB	2%20Kings	12	4	Jehoash said to the priests , “ Collect all the currently available money relating to holy things that is brought to the temple—some is money people pay to redeem persons according to their assessed value . Collect all the money brought to the Lord ’ s temple that people offer voluntarily . [ b ]
CEB	2%20Kings	12	5	The priests should take the money from their donors and use it to repair the temple wherever such a need for repair is discovered. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	12	6	But by the twenty-third year of King Jehoash , the priests still hadn ’ t repaired the temple .
CEB	2%20Kings	12	7	So King Jehoash summoned Jehoiada the priest and the other priests together . “ Why haven ’ t you repaired the temple ? ” he asked them . “ Stop taking money from your donors ; instead , give it directly for temple repairs. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	12	8	The priests agreed that they wouldn ’ t take any more money from the people nor be responsible for temple repairs .
CEB	2%20Kings	12	9	Then the priest Jehoiada took a box , made a hole in its lid , and placed it beside the altar , to the right as one enters the Lord ’ s temple . The priests who stood watch at the door put all the money brought to the Lord ’ s temple in the box .
CEB	2%20Kings	12	10	As soon as they saw that a large amount of money was in the box , the royal scribe and the high priest would come , count the money that was in the temple , and put it in a bag .
CEB	2%20Kings	12	11	They would then hand over the money that had been counted [ c ] to those who supervised the work on the temple . These supervisors then paid money to those who worked on the Lord ’ s temple : carpenters , builders ,
CEB	2%20Kings	12	13	But the money that was brought to the Lord ’ s temple was not used to make silver basins , wick trimmers , sprinkling bowls , trumpets , or any gold or silver object for the Lord ’ s temple .
CEB	2%20Kings	12	14	Instead , it was given directly to those who did the repair work ; they used it to repair the Lord ’ s temple .
CEB	2%20Kings	12	15	There was no need to check on those who received the money and paid the workers , because they acted honestly .
CEB	2%20Kings	12	16	Now as for the money for compensation and purification offerings , it wasn ’ t brought to the Lord ’ s temple . It belonged to the priests .
CEB	2%20Kings	12	17	About this same time , Aram ’ s King Hazael came up , attacked Gath , and captured it . Next Hazael decided to march against Jerusalem .

CEB	2%20Kings	13	3	So the Lord was angry at Israel . Time after time God handed them over to Aram ’ s king Hazael , and to Hazael ’ s son Ben-hadad .
CEB	2%20Kings	13	4	But Jehoahaz sought the Lord ’ s presence , and the Lord listened to him because he saw how badly Aram ’ s king was oppressing Israel .
CEB	2%20Kings	13	5	The Lord sent Israel a savior , and they escaped from Aram ’ s power . Then the Israelites lived peacefully at home , just as they had in the past .
CEB	2%20Kings	13	6	But they didn ’ t deviate from the sins that Jeroboam ’ s dynasty had caused Israel to commit ; they walked in them ! Moreover , a sacred pole [ b ] stood in Samaria .
CEB	2%20Kings	13	7	No , nothing was left of Jehoahaz ’ s army except fifty chariot riders , ten chariots , and ten thousand foot soldiers , because Aram ’ s king had decimated them , trampling them as if they were dirt .
CEB	2%20Kings	13	8	The rest of Jehoahaz ’ s deeds , all that he accomplished , and all his powerful acts , aren ’ t they written in the official records of Israel ’ s kings ?

CEB	2%20Kings	13	14	Now Elisha became sick with the illness that would kill him . So Israel ’ s King Joash went down to see him . Joash cried over Elisha , saying , “ Oh , my father , my father ! Israel ’ s chariots and its riders ! ”
CEB	2%20Kings	13	15	Elisha told Joash , “ Get a bow and some arrows. ” So he brought Elisha a bow and some arrows .
CEB	2%20Kings	13	16	Elisha then said to Israel ’ s king , “ Put your hand on the bow. ” So Joash put his hand on the bow . Elisha then put his hands over the king ’ s hands
CEB	2%20Kings	13	17	and said , “ Open the window to the east. ” The king did so . “ Now shoot ! ” Elisha told him . Joash shot , then Elisha announced , “ That ’ s the Lord ’ s rescue arrow ! The rescue arrow against the Arameans ! You will finish the Arameans off at Aphek. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	13	18	Then Elisha said , “ Take the arrows ! ” so Joash took them . Elisha then said to Israel ’ s king , “ Hit the ground with them ! ” Joash hit the ground three times and stopped .
CEB	2%20Kings	13	19	The man of God became angry with him . He said , “ If only you had struck five or six times , you would have finished the Arameans off . As it is , you will defeat them only three times. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	13	20	So Elisha died , and he was buried . Sometimes Moabite raiding parties used to come into the land each spring .
CEB	2%20Kings	13	21	Now it happened once that while a man was being buried , the people at the funeral suddenly saw a raiding party . They threw the body into Elisha ’ s tomb and ran off . When the body touched Elisha ’ s bones , the man came to life and stood up on his feet !
CEB	2%20Kings	13	22	Aram ’ s King Hazael had oppressed Israel throughout Jehoahaz ’ s rule .
CEB	2%20Kings	13	23	But the Lord was gracious to Israel and had compassion on them , turning back to them because of his covenant with Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob ; he didn ’ t want to destroy them or throw them out of his presence until now .
CEB	2%20Kings	13	24	Aram ’ s King Hazael died . His son Ben-hadad succeeded him as king .
CEB	2%20Kings	13	25	Then Jehoahaz ’ s son Joash recaptured from Hazael ’ s son Ben-hadad those cities that Hazael had won in battle from Joash ’ s father Jehoahaz . Joash attacked Ben-hadad three times and took back these Israelite cities . Footnotes -

CEB	2%20Kings	14	5	Once he had secured control over his kingdom , he executed the officials who had assassinated his father the king .
CEB	2%20Kings	14	6	However , he didn ’ t kill the children of the murderers , because of what is written in the Instruction scroll from Moses , where the Lord commanded , Parents shouldn ’ t be executed because of what their children have done ; neither should children be executed because of what their parents have done . Each person should be executed for their own guilty acts . [ b ]
CEB	2%20Kings	14	7	Next Amaziah struck down ten thousand Edomites in the Salt Valley and captured Sela in battle . He renamed it Jokthe-el , which is what it is still called today .
CEB	2%20Kings	14	8	Then Amaziah sent messengers to Israel ’ s King Joash [ c ] son of Jehoahaz son of Israel ’ s King Jehu , saying , “ Come on ! Let ’ s go head-to-head. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	14	9	But Israel ’ s King Joash responded to Judah ’ s King Amaziah , “ Once upon a time , a thistle in Lebanon sent a message to a cedar , ‘ Give your daughter to my son as a wife. ’ But then a wild beast in Lebanon came along and trampled the thistle .
CEB	2%20Kings	14	10	You have definitely defeated Edom and have now become conceited . Enjoy the honor , but stay home . Why invite disaster when both you and Judah will fall ? ”

CEB	2%20Kings	16	4	He also sacrificed and burned incense at the shrines on every hill and beneath every shady tree .
CEB	2%20Kings	16	5	Then Aram ’ s King Rezin and Israel ’ s King Pekah , Remaliah ’ s son , came up to Jerusalem to fight . They surrounded Ahaz , but they weren ’ t able to defeat him .
CEB	2%20Kings	16	6	At that time Aram ’ s King Rezin recovered Elath for the Arameans , driving the Judeans out of Elath . The Edomites [ a ] came to Elath and settled there , and that ’ s still the case now .
CEB	2%20Kings	16	7	Ahaz sent messengers to Assyria ’ s King Tiglath-pileser , saying , “ I ’ m your servant and your son . Come up and save me from the power of the kings of Aram and Israel . Both of them are attacking me ! ”

CEB	2%20Kings	16	9	The Assyrian king heard the request and marched against Damascus . He captured it and sent its citizens into exile to Kir . He also killed Rezin .
CEB	2%20Kings	16	10	Then King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet up with Assyria ’ s King Tiglath-pileser . King Ahaz noticed the altar that was in Damascus , and he sent the altar ’ s plan and details for its construction to the priest Uriah .

I will use the bronze altar for seeking guidance. ” [ b ]
CEB	2%20Kings	16	17	King Ahaz cut off the side panels from the stands and removed the basins from them . He took the Sea down from the bronze bulls that were under it and put it on a stone pavement .
CEB	2%20Kings	16	18	He also took away the sabbath canopy that had been built in the temple . He removed the royal entrance outside the Lord ’ s temple . This was done because of the Assyrian king .
CEB	2%20Kings	16	19	The rest of Ahaz ’ s deeds , aren ’ t they written in the official records of Judah ’ s kings ?
CEB	2%20Kings	17	2	Kings 17:27 LXX , Vulg , Syr ; MT They
CEB	2%20Kings	17	17	They burned their sons and daughters alive . They practiced divination and sought omens . They gave themselves over to doing what was evil in the Lord ’ s eyes and made him angry .
CEB	2%20Kings	17	3	Assyria ’ s King Shalmaneser marched against Hoshea , and Hoshea became Shalmaneser ’ s servant , paying him tribute .
CEB	2%20Kings	17	4	But the Assyrian king discovered that Hoshea was a traitor , because Hoshea sent messengers to Egypt ’ s King So . Hoshea stopped paying tribute to the Assyrian king as he had in previous years , so the Assyrian king arrested him and put him in prison .
CEB	2%20Kings	17	5	Then the Assyrian king invaded the whole country . He marched against Samaria and attacked it for three years .
CEB	2%20Kings	17	6	In Hoshea ’ s ninth year , the Assyrian king captured Samaria . He sent Israel into exile to Assyria , resettling them in Halah , in Gozan on the Habor River , and in the cities of the Medes . The northern kingdom falls
CEB	2%20Kings	17	7	All this happened because the Israelites sinned against the Lord their God , who brought them up from the land of Egypt , out from under the power of Pharaoh , Egypt ’ s king . They worshipped other gods .
CEB	2%20Kings	17	8	They followed the practices of the nations that the Lord had removed before the Israelites , as well as the practices that the Israelite kings had done . [ a ]
CEB	2%20Kings	17	9	The Israelites secretly did things against the Lord their God that weren ’ t right . They built shrines in all their towns , from watchtowers to fortified cities .
CEB	2%20Kings	17	10	They set up sacred pillars and sacred poles [ b ] on every high hill and beneath every green tree .
CEB	2%20Kings	17	11	At every shrine they burned incense , just as the nations did that the Lord sent into exile before them . They did evil things that made the Lord angry .
CEB	2%20Kings	17	12	They worshipped images about which the Lord had said , Don ’ t do such things !
CEB	2%20Kings	17	13	The Lord warned Israel and Judah through all the prophets and seers , telling them , Turn from your evil ways . Keep my commandments and my regulations in agreement with the entire Instruction that I commanded your ancestors and sent through my servants the prophets .
CEB	2%20Kings	17	14	But they wouldn ’ t listen . They were stubborn like their ancestors who didn ’ t trust the Lord their God .
CEB	2%20Kings	17	15	They rejected his regulations and the covenant he had made with their ancestors , along with the warnings he had given them . They followed worthless images so that they too became worthless . And they imitated the neighboring nations that the Lord had forbidden them to imitate .
CEB	2%20Kings	17	16	They deserted all the commandments of the Lord their God . They made themselves two metal idols cast in the shape of calves and made a sacred pole . [ c ] They bowed down to all the heavenly bodies . They served Baal .
CEB	2%20Kings	17	18	So the Lord was very angry at Israel . He removed them from his presence . Only the tribe of Judah was spared .
CEB	2%20Kings	17	19	But Judah didn ’ t keep the commands of the Lord their God either . They followed the practices of Israel .
CEB	2%20Kings	17	20	So the Lord rejected all of Israel ’ s descendants . He punished them , and he handed them over to enemies who plundered them until he finally threw them out of his sight .
CEB	2%20Kings	17	21	When Israel broke away [ d ] from David ’ s dynasty , they made Nebat ’ s son Jeroboam the king . Jeroboam drove Israel away from the Lord . He caused them to commit great sin .
CEB	2%20Kings	17	22	And the Israelites continued walking in all the sins that Jeroboam did . They didn ’ t deviate from them ,
CEB	2%20Kings	17	23	and the Lord finally removed Israel from his presence . That was exactly what he had warned through all his servants the prophets . So Israel was exiled from its land to Assyria . And that ’ s still how it is today . New settlers in Samaria
CEB	2%20Kings	17	24	The Assyrian king brought people from Babylon , Cuth , Avva , Hamath , and Sepharvaim , resettling them in the cities of Samaria in place of the Israelites . These people took control of Samaria and settled in its cities .
CEB	2%20Kings	17	25	But when they began to live there , they didn ’ t worship the Lord , so the Lord sent lions against them , and the lions began to kill them .
CEB	2%20Kings	17	26	Assyria ’ s king was told about this : “ The nations you sent into exile and resettled in the cities of Samaria don ’ t know the religious practices of the local god . He ’ s sent lions against them , and the lions are killing them because none of them know the religious practices of the local god. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	17	27	So Assyria ’ s king commanded , “ Return one of the priests that you exiled from there . He [ e ] should go back and live there . He should teach them the religious practices of the local god. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	17	28	So one of the priests who had been exiled from Samaria went back . He lived in Bethel and taught the people how to worship the Lord .
CEB	2%20Kings	17	29	But each nationality still made its own gods . They set them up in the houses that the people of Samaria had made at the shrines . Each nationality did this in whichever cities they lived .
CEB	2%20Kings	17	30	The Babylonian people made the god Succoth-benoth , the Cuthean people made Nergal , and the people from Hamath made Ashima .
CEB	2%20Kings	17	31	The Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak . The Sepharvites burned their children alive as a sacrifice to Adrammelech and Anammelech , the Sepharvite gods .
CEB	2%20Kings	17	32	They also worshipped the Lord , but they appointed priests for the shrines from their whole population . These priests worked in the houses at the shrines .
CEB	2%20Kings	17	33	So they worshipped the Lord , but they also served their own gods according to the religious practices of the nations from which they had been exiled .
CEB	2%20Kings	17	34	They are still following their former religious practices to this very day . They don ’ t really worship the Lord . Nor do they follow the regulations , the case laws , the Instruction , or the commandment that the Lord commanded the children of Jacob , whom he renamed Israel .
CEB	2%20Kings	17	35	The Lord had made a covenant with them , commanding them , Don ’ t worship other gods . Don ’ t bow down to them or serve them . Don ’ t sacrifice to them .
CEB	2%20Kings	17	36	Instead , worship only the Lord . He ’ s the one who brought you up from the land of Egypt with great strength and an outstretched arm . Bow down to him ! Sacrifice to him !
CEB	2%20Kings	17	37	You must carefully keep the regulations and case laws , the Instruction , and the commandment that he wrote for you . Don ’ t worship other gods .
CEB	2%20Kings	17	38	Don ’ t forget the covenant that I made with you . Don ’ t worship other gods .
CEB	2%20Kings	17	39	Instead , worship only the Lord your God . He will rescue you from your enemies ’ power .
CEB	2%20Kings	17	40	But they wouldn ’ t listen . Instead , they continued doing their former religious practices .
CEB	2%20Kings	17	41	So these nations worship the Lord , but they also serve their idols . The children and the grandchildren are doing the very same thing their parents did . And that ’ s how things still are today . Footnotes -
CEB	2%20Kings	18	2	Kings 18:4 Heb asherah , perhaps an object devoted to the goddess Asherah
CEB	2%20Kings	18	18	Then they called for the king . Hilkiah ’ s son Eliakim , who was the palace administrator , Shebna the secretary , and Asaph ’ s son Joah the recorder went out to them .
CEB	2%20Kings	18	25	What ’ s more , do you think I ’ ve marched against this place to destroy it without the Lord ’ s support ? It was the Lord who told me , March against this land and destroy it ! ”
CEB	2%20Kings	18	3	Hezekiah did what was right in the Lord ’ s eyes , just as his ancestor David had done .
CEB	2%20Kings	18	4	He removed the shrines . He smashed the sacred pillars and cut down the sacred pole . [ b ] He crushed the bronze snake that Moses made , because up to that point the Israelites had been burning incense to it . ( The snake was named Nehushtan . )
CEB	2%20Kings	18	5	Hezekiah trusted in the Lord , Israel ’ s God . There was no one like him among all of Judah ’ s kings—not before him and not after him .
CEB	2%20Kings	18	6	He clung to the Lord and never deviated from him . He kept the commandments that the Lord had commanded Moses .
CEB	2%20Kings	18	7	The Lord was with Hezekiah ; he succeeded at everything he tried . He rebelled against Assyria ’ s king and wouldn ’ t serve him .
CEB	2%20Kings	18	8	He struck down the Philistines as far as Gaza and its territories , from watchtower to fortified city .
CEB	2%20Kings	18	9	Assyria ’ s King Shalmaneser marched against Samaria and attacked it in the fourth year of King Hezekiah , which was the seventh year of Israel ’ s King Hoshea , Elah ’ s son .
CEB	2%20Kings	18	10	After three years the Assyrians captured the city . Samaria was captured in Hezekiah ’ s sixth year , which was Hoshea ’ s ninth year .
CEB	2%20Kings	18	11	Assyria ’ s king sent Israel into exile to Assyria . He settled them in Halah , in Gozan on the Habor River , and in the cities of the Medes .
CEB	2%20Kings	18	12	All this happened because they wouldn ’ t listen to the Lord their God . They broke his covenant—all that the Lord ’ s servant Moses had commanded them . They didn ’ t listen , and they didn ’ t do it .
CEB	2%20Kings	18	13	Assyria ’ s King Sennacherib marched against all of Judah ’ s fortified cities and captured them in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah .
CEB	2%20Kings	18	14	Judah ’ s King Hezekiah sent a message to the Assyrian king at Lachish , saying , “ I admit wrongdoing . Please withdraw from me , and I ’ ll agree to whatever you demand from me. ” Assyria ’ s king required Judah ’ s King Hezekiah to pay him three hundred kikkars of silver and thirty kikkars of gold .
CEB	2%20Kings	18	15	So Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was in the Lord ’ s temple and in the palace treasuries .
CEB	2%20Kings	18	16	At that time King Hezekiah had to strip down the doors and doorposts of the Lord ’ s temple , which he had covered with gold . He gave all of it to the Assyrian king .
CEB	2%20Kings	18	17	Assryia ’ s king sent his general , his chief officer , and his field commander from Lachish , together with a large army , to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem . They went up and arrived at Jerusalem . They stood at the water channel of the Upper Pool , which is on the road to the field where clothes are washed .
CEB	2%20Kings	18	19	Then the field commander said to them , “ Say to Hezekiah : This is what Assyria ’ s Great King says : Why do you feel so confident ?
CEB	2%20Kings	18	20	Do you think that empty words are the same as good strategy and the strength to fight ? Who are you trusting in that you now rebel against me ?
CEB	2%20Kings	18	21	It appears that you are trusting in a staff—Egypt—that ’ s nothing but a broken reed ! It will stab the hand of anyone who leans on it ! That ’ s all that Pharaoh , Egypt ’ s king , is to anyone who trusts in him .
CEB	2%20Kings	18	22	Now suppose you say to me , ‘ We trust in the Lord our God. ’ Isn ’ t he the one whose shrines and altars Hezekiah removed , telling Judah and Jerusalem , ‘ You must worship before this altar in Jerusalem ’ ?
CEB	2%20Kings	18	23	“ So now make a wager with my master , Assyria ’ s king . I ’ ll give you two thousand horses if you can supply the riders !
CEB	2%20Kings	18	24	How will you drive back even the least important official among my master ’ s servants when you are relying on Egypt for chariots and riders ?
CEB	2%20Kings	18	26	Hilkiah ’ s son Eliakim , Shebna , and Joah said to the field commander , “ Please speak to your servants in Aramaic because we understand it . Don ’ t speak with us in Hebrew , because the people on the wall will hear it. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	18	27	The field commander said to them , “ Did my master send me to speak these words just to you and your master and not also to the men on the wall ? They are the ones who will have to eat their dung and drink their urine along with you. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	18	28	Then the field commander stood up and shouted in Hebrew at the top of his voice , saying , “ Listen to the message of the great king , Assyria ’ s king .
CEB	2%20Kings	18	29	This is what the king says : Don ’ t let Hezekiah lie to you . He won ’ t be able to rescue you from the power of Assyria ’ s king .
CEB	2%20Kings	18	30	Don ’ t let Hezekiah persuade you to trust the Lord by saying , ‘ The Lord will certainly rescue us . This city won ’ t be handed over to Assyria ’ s king. ’
CEB	2%20Kings	18	31	“ Don ’ t listen to Hezekiah , because this is what Assyria ’ s king says : Surrender to me and come out . Then each of you will eat from your own vine and fig tree , and drink water from your own well
CEB	2%20Kings	18	32	until I come to take you to a land just like your land . It will be a land of grain and new wine , a land of bread and vineyards , a land of olive oil and honey . Then you will live and not die ! Don ’ t listen to Hezekiah , because he will mislead you by saying , ‘ The Lord will rescue us. ’
CEB	2%20Kings	18	33	Were any of the gods of the other nations able to rescue their lands from the power of Assyria ’ s king ?
CEB	2%20Kings	18	34	Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad ? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim , Hena , and Ivvah ? Have they rescued Samaria from my power ?
CEB	2%20Kings	18	35	Which one of any of the gods of those lands has rescued their country from my power ? Why should the Lord rescue Jerusalem from my power ? ”
CEB	2%20Kings	18	36	But the people kept quiet and didn ’ t answer him with a single word , because King Hezekiah ’ s command was , “ Don ’ t answer him ! ”
CEB	2%20Kings	18	37	Hilkiah ’ s son Eliakim , who was the palace administrator , Shebna the secretary , and Asaph ’ s son Joah the recorder , came to Hezekiah with ripped clothes . They told him what the field commander had said . Footnotes -

CEB	2%20Kings	19	19	So now , Lord our God , please save us from Sennacherib ’ s power ! Then all the earth ’ s kingdoms will know that you , Lord , are the only true God. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	19	3	They said to him , “ This is what Hezekiah says : Today is a day of distress , punishment , and humiliation . It ’ s as if children are ready to be born , but there ’ s no strength to see it through .
CEB	2%20Kings	19	4	Perhaps the Lord your God has heard all the words of the field commander who was sent by his master , Assyria ’ s king—how he insulted the living God—perhaps God will punish him for the words the Lord your God heard . Send up a prayer for those few people who still survive. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	19	5	When King Hezekiah ’ s servants got to Isaiah ,
CEB	2%20Kings	19	6	Isaiah said to them , “ Say this to your master : ‘ This is what the Lord says : Don ’ t be afraid at the words you heard , which the officers of Assyria ’ s king have used to insult me .
CEB	2%20Kings	19	7	I ’ m about to put a spirit in him , so when he hears a rumor , he ’ ll go back to his own country . Then I ’ ll have him cut down by the sword in his own land. ’ ”
CEB	2%20Kings	19	8	The field commander heard that the Assyrian king had left Lachish . So he went back to the king and found him attacking Libnah .
CEB	2%20Kings	19	9	Then the Assyrian king learned that Cush ’ s King Tirhakah was on his way to fight against him . So he sent messengers to Hezekiah again , saying ,
CEB	2%20Kings	19	10	“ Say this to Judah ’ s King Hezekiah : Don ’ t let the God you trust in persuade you by saying , ‘ Jerusalem won ’ t be handed over to the Assyrian king. ’
CEB	2%20Kings	19	11	You yourself have heard what Assyrian kings do to other countries , wiping them out . Is it likely that you will be saved ?
CEB	2%20Kings	19	12	Did the gods of the nations destroyed by my fathers—Gozan , Haran , Rezeph , or the people of Eden in Telassar—save them ?
CEB	2%20Kings	19	13	Where now is Hamath ’ s king , Arpad ’ s king , or the kings of Lair , Sepharvaim , Hena , or Ivvah ? ” [ a ] Hezekiah ’ s prayer
CEB	2%20Kings	19	14	Hezekiah took the letters from the messengers and read them . Then he went to the temple and spread them out before the Lord .
CEB	2%20Kings	19	15	Hezekiah prayed to the Lord , saying , “ Lord God of Israel , you sit enthroned on the winged creatures . You alone are God over all the earth ’ s kingdoms . You made both heaven and earth .
CEB	2%20Kings	19	16	Lord , turn your ear this way and hear ! Lord , open your eyes and see ! Listen to Sennacherib ’ s words . He sent them to insult the living God !
CEB	2%20Kings	19	17	It ’ s true , Lord , that the Assyrian kings have destroyed many nations and their lands .
CEB	2%20Kings	19	18	The Assyrians burned the gods of those nations with fire because they aren ’ t real gods . They are only man-made creations of wood and stone . That ’ s how the Assyrians could destroy them .
CEB	2%20Kings	19	20	Then Isaiah , Amoz ’ s son , sent a message to Hezekiah : “ This is what the Lord , Israel ’ s God , says : I have heard your prayer about Assyria ’ s King Sennacherib .
CEB	2%20Kings	19	21	This is the message that the Lord has spoken against him : The young woman , Daughter Zion , despises you and mocks you ; Daughter Jerusalem shakes her head behind your back .
CEB	2%20Kings	19	22	Whom did you insult and ridicule ? Against whom did you raise your voice and pridefully lift your eyes ? It was against the holy one of Israel !
CEB	2%20Kings	19	23	You ’ ve insulted the Lord with your messengers ; you said , ‘ I , with my many chariots , have gone up to the highest mountains , to the farthest reaches of Lebanon . I have cut down its tallest cedars , the best of its pine trees . I have reached its most remote lodging place , its best forest .
CEB	2%20Kings	19	24	I have dug wells , have drunk waters in foreign lands . [ b ] With my own feet , I dried up all of Egypt ’ s streams. ’
CEB	2%20Kings	19	25	Haven ’ t you heard ? I set this up long ago ; I planned it in the distant past ! Now I have made it happen , making fortified cities collapse into piles of rubble .
CEB	2%20Kings	19	26	Their citizens have lost their power . They are frightened and ashamed . They ’ ve become like plants in a field , tender green shoots , the grass on rooftops , burned up before it matures .
CEB	2%20Kings	19	27	I know where you live , how you go out and come in , and how you rage against me .
CEB	2%20Kings	19	28	And because you rage against me and because your pride has reached my ears , I will put my hook in your nose , and my bit in your mouth . I will make you go back the same way you came .
CEB	2%20Kings	19	29	“ Now this will be the sign for you , Hezekiah : This year you will eat what grows by itself . Next year you will eat what grows from that . But in the third year , sow seed and harvest it ; plant vineyards and eat their fruit .
CEB	2%20Kings	19	30	The survivors of the house of Judah who have escaped will take root below and bear fruit above .
CEB	2%20Kings	19	31	Those who remain will go out from Jerusalem , and those who survive will go out from Mount Zion . The zeal of the Lord of heavenly forces [ c ] will do this .
CEB	2%20Kings	19	32	; Kethib lacks of heavenly forces .
CEB	2%20Kings	19	33	He will go back by the same way he came . He won ’ t enter this city , declares the Lord .
CEB	2%20Kings	19	34	I will defend this city and save it for my sake and for the sake of my servant David. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	19	35	That night the Lord ’ s messenger went out and struck down one hundred eighty-five thousand soldiers in the Assyrian camp . When people got up the next morning , there were dead bodies everywhere .
CEB	2%20Kings	19	36	So Assyria ’ s King Sennacherib departed , returning to Nineveh , where he stayed .
CEB	2%20Kings	19	37	Later , while he was worshipping in the temple of his god Nisroch , his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer killed him with a sword . They then escaped to the land of Ararat . His son Esarhaddon succeeded him as king . Footnotes -

CEB	2%20Kings	20	3	“ Please , Lord , remember how I have walked before you in truth and sincerity . I have done what is right in your eyes. ” Then Hezekiah cried and cried .
CEB	2%20Kings	20	4	Isaiah hadn ’ t even left the middle courtyard of the palace when the Lord ’ s word came to him :
CEB	2%20Kings	20	5	Turn around . Say to Hezekiah , my people ’ s leader : This is what the Lord , the God of your ancestor David , says : I have heard your prayer and have seen your tears . So now I ’ m going to heal you . Three days from now you will be able to go up to the Lord ’ s temple .
CEB	2%20Kings	20	6	I will add fifteen years to your life . I will rescue you and this city from the power of the Assyian king . I will defend this city for my sake and for the sake of my servant David .
CEB	2%20Kings	20	7	Then Isaiah said , “ Prepare a bandage made of figs. ” They did so and put it on the swelling , at which point Hezekiah started getting better .
CEB	2%20Kings	20	8	Hezekiah said to Isaiah , “ What is the sign that the Lord will heal me and that I ’ ll be able to go up to the Lord ’ s temple in three days ? ”
CEB	2%20Kings	20	9	Isaiah said , “ This will be your sign from the Lord that he will make his promise come true : Should the shadow go forward ten steps or back ten steps ? ”
CEB	2%20Kings	20	10	“ It ’ s easy for the shadow to go forward ten steps , ” Hezekiah said , “ but not for the shadow to go back ten steps. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	20	11	So the prophet Isaiah called on the Lord , who made the shadow go back ten steps , down the flight of stairs built by Ahaz . [ a ]
CEB	2%20Kings	20	12	At that time Merodach-baladan , son of Babylon ’ s King Baladan , sent messengers to Hezekiah with letters and a gift . This was because he had heard that Hezekiah was sick .
CEB	2%20Kings	20	13	Hezekiah granted them an audience and showed them everything in his treasury—the silver , the gold , the spices , and the fine oil . He also showed them his stock of weaponry and everything in his storehouses . There wasn ’ t a single thing in his palace or his whole kingdom that Hezekiah didn ’ t show them .
CEB	2%20Kings	20	14	Then the prophet Isaiah came to King Hezekiah and said to him , “ What did these men say ? Where have they come from ? ” Hezekiah said , “ They came from a distant country : Babylon. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	20	15	“ What have they seen in your palace ? ” Isaiah asked . “ They have seen everything in my palace , ” Hezekiah answered . “ There ’ s not a single thing in my storehouses that I haven ’ t shown them. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	20	16	Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah , “ Listen to the Lord ’ s word :
CEB	2%20Kings	20	17	The days are nearly here when everything in your palace and all that your ancestors collected up to now will be carried off to Babylon . Not a single thing will be left , says the Lord .
CEB	2%20Kings	20	18	Some of your children , your very own offspring , will be taken away . They will become eunuchs in the palace of Babylon ’ s king. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	20	19	Hezekiah said to Isaiah , “ The Lord ’ s word that you ’ ve spoken is good , ” because he thought : There will be peace and security in my lifetime .
CEB	2%20Kings	20	21	Hezekiah lay down with his ancestors . His son Manasseh succeeded him as king . Footnotes -

CEB	2%20Kings	21	12	Because of this , the Lord , Israel ’ s God , has said : I ’ m about to bring on Jerusalem and Judah such a great disaster that the ears of anyone who hears about it will ring .
CEB	2%20Kings	21	3	He rebuilt the shrines that his father Hezekiah had destroyed , set up altars for Baal , and made a sacred pole , [ a ] just as Israel ’ s King Ahab had done . He bowed down to all the stars in the sky and worshipped them .
CEB	2%20Kings	21	4	He even built altars in the two courtyards of the Lord ’ s temple—the very place the Lord was speaking of when he said : “ I will put my name in Jerusalem. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	21	5	Manasseh built altars for all the stars in the sky in both courtyards of the Lord ’ s temple .
CEB	2%20Kings	21	6	He burned his own son alive , consulted sign readers and fortune-tellers , and used mediums and diviners . He did much evil in the Lord ’ s eyes and made him angry .
CEB	2%20Kings	21	7	Manasseh set up the carved Asherah image he had made in the temple—the very temple the Lord had spoken about to David and his son Solomon , saying , In this temple and in Jerusalem , which I have chosen out of all Israel ’ s tribes , I will put my name forever .
CEB	2%20Kings	21	8	I will never again remove Israel from the land I gave to their ancestors , provided they carefully do everything I have commanded them—keeping all the Instruction my servant Moses commanded them .
CEB	2%20Kings	21	9	But they wouldn ’ t listen . Manasseh led them into doing even more evil than the nations the Lord had wiped out before the Israelites .
CEB	2%20Kings	21	10	The Lord spoke through his servants the prophets :
CEB	2%20Kings	21	11	Judah ’ s King Manasseh has done detestable things , things more evil than the Amorites had done before his time . He has caused Judah to sin with his images .
CEB	2%20Kings	21	13	I will stretch out over Jerusalem the same line that I used to measure Samaria and the same mason ’ s level that I used on Ahab ’ s family . I will wipe Jerusalem clean the same way someone wipes a plate clean , wiping it clean then turning it facedown .
CEB	2%20Kings	21	14	Whatever survives of my inheritance , I ’ ll leave behind , handing them over to their enemies . They will be nothing but plunder and loot for every one of their enemies .
CEB	2%20Kings	21	15	This will happen because they have done what is evil in my eyes , making me angry from the day their ancestors left Egypt until this very moment .
CEB	2%20Kings	21	16	Manasseh spilled so much innocent blood that he filled up every corner of Jerusalem with it . And this doesn ’ t include the sins he caused Judah to commit so that they did what was evil in the Lord ’ s eyes .
CEB	2%20Kings	21	17	The rest of Manasseh ’ s deeds , all that he accomplished , and the sin he committed , aren ’ t they written in the official records of Judah ’ s kings ?

CEB	2%20Kings	22	3	In the eighteenth year of King Josiah ’ s rule , he sent the secretary Shaphan , Azaliah ’ s son and Meshullam ’ s grandson , to the Lord ’ s temple with the following orders :
CEB	2%20Kings	22	4	“ Go to the high priest Hilkiah . Have him carefully count [ a ] the money that has been brought to the Lord ’ s temple and that has been collected from the people by the doorkeepers .
CEB	2%20Kings	22	5	It should be given to the supervisors in charge of the Lord ’ s temple , who in turn should pay it to those who are in the Lord ’ s temple , repairing the temple—
CEB	2%20Kings	22	6	the carpenters , the builders , and the masons . It should be used to pay for lumber and quarried stone to repair the temple .
CEB	2%20Kings	22	7	But there ’ s no need to check on them regarding the money they receive , because they are honest workers. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	22	9	Shaphan the secretary then went to the king and reported this to him : “ Your officials have released the money that was found in the temple and have handed it over to those who supervise the work in the Lord ’ s temple. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	22	10	Then Shaphan the secretary told the king , “ Hilkiah the priest has given me a scroll , ” and he read it out loud before the king .
CEB	2%20Kings	22	11	As soon as the king heard what the Instruction scroll said , he ripped his clothes .
CEB	2%20Kings	22	12	The king ordered the priest Hilkiah , Shaphan ’ s son Ahikam , Micaiah ’ s son Achbor , Shaphan the secretary , and Asaiah the royal officer as follows :
CEB	2%20Kings	22	13	“ Go and ask the Lord on my behalf , and on behalf of the people , and on behalf of all Judah concerning the contents of this scroll that has been found . The Lord must be furious with us because our ancestors failed to obey the words of this scroll and do everything written in it about us. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	22	14	So Hilkiah the priest , Ahikam , Achbor , Shaphan , and Asaiah went to the prophetess Huldah . She was married to Shallum , Tikvah ’ s son and Harhas ’ grandson , who was in charge of the wardrobe . She lived in Jerusalem in the second district . When they spoke to her ,
CEB	2%20Kings	22	15	she replied , “ This is what the Lord , Israel ’ s God , says : Tell this to the man who sent you to me :

CEB	2%20Kings	22	19	Because your heart was broken and you submitted before the Lord when you heard what I said about this place and its citizens—that they will become a horror and a curse—and because you ripped your clothes and cried before me , I have listened to you , declares the Lord .

CEB	2%20Kings	23	23	years old when he became king , and he ruled for three months in Jerusalem . His mother ’ s name was Hamutal ; she was Jeremiah ’ s daughter and was from Libnah .
CEB	2%20Kings	23	1	the king sent a message , and all of Judah ’ s and Jerusalem ’ s elders gathered before him .
CEB	2%20Kings	23	3	The king stood beside the pillar and made a covenant with the Lord that he would follow the Lord by keeping his commandments , his laws , and his regulations with all his heart and all his being in order to fulfill the words of this covenant that were written in this scroll . All of the people accepted the covenant .
CEB	2%20Kings	23	4	The king then commanded the high priest Hilkiah , the second-order priests , and the doorkeepers to remove from the Lord ’ s temple all the religious objects made for Baal , Asherah , and all the heavenly bodies . The king burned them outside Jerusalem in the Kidron fields and took the ashes to Bethel .
CEB	2%20Kings	23	5	He got rid of the pagan priests that the Judean kings had appointed to burn incense at the shrines in Judah ’ s cities and the areas around Jerusalem . He did the same to those who burned incense to Baal , to the sun , to the moon , to the constellations , and to all the heavenly bodies .
CEB	2%20Kings	23	6	He removed the Asherah image [ a ] from the Lord ’ s temple , taking it to the Kidron Valley outside Jerusalem . There he burned it , ground it to dust , and threw the dust on the public graveyard .
CEB	2%20Kings	23	7	The king tore down the shrines for the consecrated workers [ b ] that were in the Lord ’ s temple , where women made woven coverings [ c ] for Asherah .
CEB	2%20Kings	23	8	Then Josiah brought all the priests out of Judah ’ s cities . From Geba to Beer-sheba , he defiled the shrines where the priests had been burning incense . He also tore down the shrines at the gates at the entrance to the gate of Joshua the city ’ s governor , which were on the left as one entered the city gate .
CEB	2%20Kings	23	9	Although the priests of these shrines didn ’ t go up on the Lord ’ s altar in Jerusalem , they did eat unleavened bread with their fellow priests .

CEB	2%20Kings	23	11	He did away with the horses that Judah ’ s kings had dedicated to the sun . They were kept at the entrance to the Lord ’ s temple near a room in the annex [ d ] that belonged to an official named Nathan-melech . Josiah set fire to the chariots that were dedicated to the sun .
CEB	2%20Kings	23	12	The king also tore down the altars that were on the roof of Ahaz ’ s upper story , which had been made by the Judean kings , and he did the same with the altars that Manasseh had built in the two courtyards of the Lord ’ s temple . He broke them up there [ e ] and threw their dust into the Kidron Valley .
CEB	2%20Kings	23	13	The king then defiled the shrines facing Jerusalem , south of the Mountain of Destruction . Solomon the king of Israel had built these for Ashtoreth , the monstrous Sidonian god , for Chemosh , the monstrous Moabite god , and for Milcom , the detestable Ammonite god .
CEB	2%20Kings	23	14	He smashed the sacred pillars and cut down the sacred poles , [ f ] filling the places where they had been with human bones .
CEB	2%20Kings	23	15	Josiah also tore down the altar that was in Bethel . That was the shrine made by Jeroboam , Nebat ’ s son , who caused Israel to sin . Josiah tore down that altar and its shrine . He burned the shrine , grinding it into dust . Then he burned its sacred pole . [ g ]
CEB	2%20Kings	23	16	When Josiah turned around , he noticed tombs up on the hillside . So he ordered the bones to be taken out of the tombs . He then burned them on the altar , desecrating it . ( This was in agreement with the word that the Lord announced by the man of God when Jeroboam stood by the altar at the festival . ) Josiah then turned and saw the tomb of the man of God [ h ] who had predicted these things .
CEB	2%20Kings	23	17	“ What ’ s this gravestone I see ? ” Josiah asked . The people of the city replied , “ That tomb belongs to the man of God who came from Judah and announced what you would do to the altar of Bethel. ”
CEB	2%20Kings	23	18	“ Let it be , ” Josiah said . “ No one should disturb his bones. ” So they left his bones untouched , along with the bones of the prophet who came from Samaria .

CEB	1%20Chronicles	21	4	But the king overruled Joab , who left and traveled throughout all Israel . When he returned to Jerusalem ,

CEB	1%20Chronicles	21	10	Go and tell David , This is what the Lord says : I ’ m offering you three punishments . Choose one of them , and that is what I will do to you .

CEB	1%20Chronicles	21	17	and David said to God , “ Wasn ’ t it I who ordered the numbering of the people ? I ’ m the sinner , the one responsible for this evil . But these sheep—what have they done ? Lord , my God , turn your hand against me and my household , but spare your people from the plague. ”
CEB	1%20Chronicles	21	18	The Lord ’ s messenger ordered Gad to tell David that he should go up to the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite in order to set up an altar for the Lord .

CEB	1%20Chronicles	21	23	Ornan replied to David , “ Take it for yourself , and may my master the king do what he thinks is best . I ’ ll even provide the oxen for the entirely burned offerings , the threshing boards for wood , and the wheat for the grain offering—I ’ ll provide everything ! ”
CEB	1%20Chronicles	21	24	But King David said to Ornan , “ No , I will buy them from you at a fair price . I won ’ t offer to the Lord what belongs to you nor offer an entirely burned offering that costs me nothing. ”

CEB	1%20Chronicles	21	26	David built an altar there for the Lord and offered entirely burned offerings and well-being sacrifices . He called on the Lord , who answered him with fire from heaven on the altar of the entirely burned offering , consuming the entirely burned offering . [ d ]

CEB	1%20Chronicles	22	8	But the Lord told me : You ’ ve shed much blood and waged great wars . You won ’ t build a temple for my name because you ’ ve spilled so much blood on the ground before me .
CEB	1%20Chronicles	22	9	A son has just been born to you . He ’ ll be a man of peace , and I ’ ll give him peace with all his surrounding enemies . In fact , his name will be Solomon , [ b ] and I ’ ll give Israel peace and quiet during his reign .

CEB	1%20Chronicles	22	12	May the Lord be sure to give you insight and understanding so that when he appoints you over Israel , you will observe the Instruction from the Lord your God . [ c ]
CEB	1%20Chronicles	22	13	Then , if you carefully follow the regulations and case laws that the Lord commanded Moses concerning Israel , you ’ ll prosper . Be strong and brave . Don ’ t be afraid or lose heart !
CEB	1%20Chronicles	22	14	With great effort I ’ ve now provided for the Lord ’ s temple one hundred thousand kikkars of gold , one million kikkars of silver , and so much bronze and iron that it can ’ t be weighed , as well as wood and stone , though you may add to these .
CEB	1%20Chronicles	22	15	You also have innumerable people to do the work : stonecutters , masons , and carpenters with every skill required for any task ,

CEB	1%20Chronicles	22	17	Then David ordered all of Israel ’ s leaders to help his son Solomon :

CEB	2%20Chronicles	6	3	The king turned around , and while the entire assembly of Israel was standing there , he blessed them ,
CEB	2%20Chronicles	6	4	saying : Bless the Lord , the God of Israel , who spoke directly to my father David and now has kept his promise :
CEB	2%20Chronicles	6	5	“ From the day I brought my people out of the land of Egypt , I haven ’ t selected a city from any Israelite tribe as a site for the building of a temple for my name . Neither have I chosen anyone as prince over my people Israel .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	6	7	My father David wanted to build a temple for the name of the Lord , Israel ’ s God .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	6	8	But the Lord said to my father David : “ It is very good that you thought to build a temple for my name . Nevertheless ,
CEB	2%20Chronicles	6	9	you yourself won ’ t build that temple . Instead , your very own son will build the temple for my name. ”
CEB	2%20Chronicles	6	10	The Lord has kept his promise—I have succeeded my father David on Israel ’ s throne , just as the Lord said , and I have built the temple for the name of the Lord , Israel ’ s God .

CEB	2%20Chronicles	6	13	Now Solomon had made a bronze platform seven and a half feet long , seven and a half feet wide , and four and a half feet high , and he set it in the middle of the enclosure . He stood on it . Then , kneeling before the whole assembly of Israel and spreading his hands toward the sky ,
CEB	2%20Chronicles	6	14	he said : Lord God of Israel , there is no god like you in heaven or on the earth . You keep the covenant and show loyalty to your servants who walk before you with all their heart .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	6	15	This is the covenant you kept with your servant David my father , which you promised him . Today you have fulfilled what you promised .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	6	16	So now , Lord God of Israel , keep what you promised my father David your servant when you said to him , “ You will never fail to have a successor sitting on Israel ’ s throne as long as your descendants carefully walk according to my Instruction , just as you have walked before me. ”
CEB	2%20Chronicles	6	17	So now , Lord God of Israel , may your promise to your servant David come true .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	6	18	But how could God possibly live on earth with people ? If heaven , even the highest heaven , can ’ t contain you , how can this temple that I have built contain you ?

CEB	2%20Chronicles	6	20	Constantly watch over this temple , the place where you promised to put your name , and listen to the prayer your servant is praying concerning this place .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	6	21	Listen to the request of your servant and your people Israel when they pray concerning this place . Listen from your heavenly dwelling place , and when you hear , forgive !
CEB	2%20Chronicles	6	22	If someone wrongs another and must take a solemn pledge asserting his innocence before your altar in this temple ,
CEB	2%20Chronicles	6	23	then listen from heaven , act , and decide which of your servants is right . Condemn the guilty party , repaying them for their conduct , but justify the innocent person , repaying them for their righteousness .

CEB	2%20Chronicles	6	28	Whenever there is a famine or plague in the land , or whenever there is blight , mildew , locusts , or grasshoppers , or whenever someone ’ s enemies attack them in their cities , or any plague or illness comes ,

CEB	2%20Chronicles	7	7	Solomon also dedicated the middle of the courtyard in front of the Lord ’ s temple . He had to offer the entirely burned offerings and the fat of the well-being sacrifices there because the bronze altar Solomon had made was too small to contain the entirely burned offerings , the grain offerings , and the pieces of fat .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	7	3	All the Israelites were watching when the fire fell . As the Lord ’ s glory filled the temple , they knelt down on the pavement with their faces to the ground , worshipping and giving thanks to the Lord , saying , “ Yes , God is good ! Yes , God ’ s faithful love lasts forever ! ”
CEB	2%20Chronicles	7	4	Then the king and all the people sacrificed to the Lord .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	7	5	King Solomon sacrificed twenty-two thousand oxen and one hundred twenty thousand sheep when the king and all the people dedicated God ’ s temple .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	7	6	The priests stood at their posts , as did the Levites with the Lord ’ s musical instruments , which King David had made for giving thanks to the Lord , saying , “ Yes , God ’ s faithful love lasts forever ! ” and which David had used when he gave praise . Across from them , the priests were blowing trumpets while all Israel was standing .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	7	8	At that time Solomon , together with all Israel , celebrated the festival for seven days . It was a very large assembly that came from Lebo-hamath to the border [ a ] of Egypt .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	7	9	On the eighth day there was a gathering . They had dedicated the altar for seven days and celebrated the festival for another seven days .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	7	10	On the twenty-third day of the seventh month , [ b ] Solomon dismissed the people to their tents , happy and content because of the goodness the Lord had shown to David , to Solomon , and to his people Israel .

CEB	2%20Chronicles	7	12	Then the Lord appeared to Solomon at night and said to him : I have heard your prayer and have chosen this place as my house of sacrifice .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	7	13	When I close the sky so that there is no rain or I order the locusts to consume the land or I send a plague against my people ,
CEB	2%20Chronicles	7	14	if my people who belong to me will humbly pray , seek my face , and turn from their wicked ways , then I will hear from heaven , forgive their sin , and heal their land .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	7	15	From now on my eyes will be open and my ears will pay attention to the prayers offered in this place ,
CEB	2%20Chronicles	7	16	because I have chosen this temple and declared it holy so that my name may be there forever . My eyes and my heart will always be there .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	7	17	As for you , if you will walk before me just as your father David did , doing all that I have commanded you and keeping my regulations and case laws ,
CEB	2%20Chronicles	7	18	then I will establish your royal throne , just as I promised your father David : You will never fail to have a successor ruling in Israel .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	7	19	But if any of you ever turn away from and abandon the regulations and commands that I have given you , and go to serve other gods and worship them ,
CEB	2%20Chronicles	7	20	then I will uproot you [ c ] from my land that I gave you , and I will reject this temple that I made holy for my name . I will make it a joke , insulted by everyone .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	7	21	Everyone who passes by this temple—so lofty now—will be shocked and will wonder , Why has the Lord done such a thing to this land and temple ?
CEB	2%20Chronicles	7	22	The answer will come , Because they abandoned the Lord , the God of their ancestors , who brought them out of Egypt . They embraced other gods , worshipping and serving them . This is why God brought all this disaster on them . Footnotes -

CEB	2%20Chronicles	8	4	He fortified Tadmor in the wilderness , along with all the storage cities he had built in Hamath .

CEB	2%20Chronicles	8	13	as each day required , according to the commandment of Moses for sabbaths , new moon festivals , and the three annual festivals—Unleavened Bread , Weeks , and Booths .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	8	14	Just as his father David had ordered , Solomon set up the divisions of the priests for their services and the Levites to their posts for offering praise and ministering in front of the priests , doing what needed to be done each day ; as well as the gatekeepers in their divisions at each gate , because this was what David the man of God had commanded .

CEB	2%20Chronicles	9	20	All King Solomon ’ s drinking cups were made of gold , and all the items in the Forest of Lebanon Palace were made of pure gold , not silver , since even silver wasn ’ t considered good enough in Solomon ’ s time !

CEB	2%20Chronicles	10	3	The people sent and called for Jeroboam , who along with all Israel came and said to Rehoboam ,
CEB	2%20Chronicles	10	4	“ Your father made our workload [ a ] very heavy ; if you will lessen the demands your father made of us and lighten the heavy workload he demanded from us , then we will serve you. ”
CEB	2%20Chronicles	10	5	He answered them , “ Come back in three days. ” So the people left .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	10	6	King Rehoboam consulted the elders who had served his father Solomon when he was alive . “ What do you advise ? ” Rehoboam asked . “ How should I respond to these people ? ”

CEB	2%20Chronicles	10	8	But Rehoboam ignored the advice the elders gave him and instead sought the counsel of the young advisors who had grown up with him and now served him .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	10	9	“ What do you advise ? ” he asked them . “ How should we respond to these people who said to me , ‘ Lighten the workload your father demanded from us ’ ? ”
CEB	2%20Chronicles	10	11	So if my father made your workload heavy , I ’ ll make it even heavier ! If my father disciplined you with whips , I ’ ll do it with scorpions ! ’ ”
CEB	2%20Chronicles	10	12	Jeroboam and all the people returned to Rehoboam on the third day , just as the king had specified when he said , “ Come back in three days. ”
CEB	2%20Chronicles	10	13	The king then answered the people harshly . He ignored the elders ’ advice ,
CEB	2%20Chronicles	10	14	and instead followed the young people ’ s advice . He said , “ My father made your workload heavy , but I ’ ll make it even heavier ; my father disciplined you with whips , but I ’ ll do it with scorpions ! ”
CEB	2%20Chronicles	10	15	The king didn ’ t listen to the people because this turn of events came from God so that the Lord might keep his promise concerning Jeroboam , Nebat ’ s son , which God delivered through Ahijah from Shiloh .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	10	16	When all Israel saw [ c ] that the king wouldn ’ t listen to them , the people answered the king , “ Why should we care about David ? We have no stake in Jesse ’ s son ! Go back to your homes , Israel ! You better look after your own house now , David ! ” Then all Israel went back to their homes ,
CEB	2%20Chronicles	10	17	and Rehoboam ruled over only the Israelites who lived in the cities of Judah .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	10	18	When King Rehoboam sent Hadoram to them ( he was the leader of the work gang ) , the Israelites stoned him to death . King Rehoboam quickly got into his chariot and fled to Jerusalem .

CEB	2%20Chronicles	11	12	He also stored shields and spears in each of the cities , making them very strong . This is how Judah and Benjamin remained under his control .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	11	13	The priests and the Levites from every region throughout all Israel sided with Rehoboam .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	11	14	The Levites left their pastures and property to come to Judah and Jerusalem because Jeroboam and his sons had refused to let them serve as the Lord ’ s priests ,
CEB	2%20Chronicles	11	15	having appointed his own priests for the shrines and the goat and calf idols he had made .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	11	16	People from every tribe of Israel who had made up their minds to seek the Lord , Israel ’ s God , came to Jerusalem to sacrifice to the Lord , the God of their ancestors .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	11	17	They strengthened the kingdom of Judah and supported Rehoboam , Solomon ’ s son , for three years by following the way of David and Solomon those three years .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	11	18	Rehoboam married Mahalath daughter of Jerimoth , David ’ s son , and Abihail daughter of Eliab , Jesse ’ s son .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	11	19	The sons she bore him were Jeush , Shemariah , and Zaham .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	11	20	Later he married Maacah , Absalom ’ s daughter , who bore him Abijah , Attai , Ziza , and Shelomith .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	11	21	Rehoboam loved Absalom ’ s daughter Maacah more than all his wives and secondary wives . In all , he had eighteen wives and sixty secondary wives , twenty-eight sons , and sixty daughters .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	11	22	Rehoboam named Abijah , Maacah ’ s son , as his successor in order to make him king .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	11	23	He wisely placed some of his sons in every region of Judah and Benjamin , in every fortified city , and gave them plenty of food and sought many wives for them .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	12	2	Chronicles 12:16 Spelled Abijam in
CEB	2%20Chronicles	12	12	When Rehoboam submitted , the Lord was no longer angry with him , and total destruction was avoided . There were , after all , some good things still in Judah .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	12	3	Accompanying Shishak from Egypt were twelve hundred chariots , sixty thousand horses , and countless Libyan , Sukkite , and Cushite warriors .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	12	4	He captured the fortified cities of Judah and came toward Jerusalem .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	12	5	Then the prophet Shemaiah went to Rehoboam and the leaders of Judah who had gathered at Jerusalem because of Shishak , and told them , This is what the Lord says : Since you have abandoned me , now I am abandoning you to Shishak ’ s power .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	12	6	Then the leaders of Israel and the king submitted . “ The Lord is right , ” they said .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	12	7	When the Lord saw that they had submitted , the Lord ’ s word came to Shemaiah : Since they have submitted , I won ’ t destroy them . I will deliver them in a little while , and I won ’ t use Shishak to pour out my anger against Jerusalem .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	12	8	Nevertheless , they will be subject to him so that they learn the difference between serving me and serving other nations .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	12	9	Egypt ’ s King Shishak attacked Jerusalem and seized the treasures of the Lord ’ s temple and the royal palace . He took everything , even the gold shields Solomon had made .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	12	10	King Rehoboam replaced them with bronze shields and assigned them to the officers of the guard who protected the entrance to the royal palace . (
CEB	2%20Chronicles	12	11	Whenever the king entered the Lord ’ s temple , the guards would carry the shields and then return them to the guardroom . )
CEB	2%20Chronicles	12	13	So King Rehoboam was securely established in Jerusalem . Rehoboam was
CEB	2%20Chronicles	12	41	years old when he became king , and he ruled seventeen years in Jerusalem , the city the Lord had chosen from all the tribes of Israel to put his name . His mother ’ s name was Naamah from Ammon .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	12	14	But Rehoboam did what was evil because he didn ’ t set his heart on seeking the Lord .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	12	15	The deeds of Rehoboam , from beginning to end , aren ’ t they written in the records of the prophet Shemaiah and the seer Iddo , including the genealogical records ? There was continual warfare between Rehoboam and Jeroboam .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	12	16	Rehoboam lay down with his ancestors and was buried in David ’ s City . His son Abijah [ a ] succeeded him as king . Footnotes -

CEB	2%20Chronicles	13	13	Meanwhile , Jeroboam had sent troops around behind them for an ambush so that the main force was in front of Judah while the ambush was behind .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	13	3	Abijah went to fight with an army of four hundred thousand select troops against Jeroboam ’ s select forces numbering eight hundred thousand , who were arrayed in battle formation .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	13	4	Abijah stood on the heights of Mount Zemaraim in Ephraim ’ s highlands and said : “ Listen to me , Jeroboam and all Israel !
CEB	2%20Chronicles	13	5	Surely you know that the Lord , Israel ’ s God , made an unbreakable covenant [ b ] with David and his descendants that they would rule Israel forever .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	13	6	It was Jeroboam , Nebat ’ s son , the servant of Solomon , David ’ s son , who rebelled against his master .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	13	7	When some useless , worthless people joined his cause , they overpowered Rehoboam , Solomon ’ s son , who was too young and timid to resist them .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	13	8	And now do you intend to challenge the Lord ’ s royal rule , entrusted to David ’ s descendants ? You may have a numerical advantage , as well as the gold calves Jeroboam made for you as gods .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	13	9	But you ’ ve banished the Lord ’ s priests , Aaron ’ s sons , along with the Levites , so that you could appoint your own priests as other countries do . Now anyone who shows up with a young bull and seven rams can become a priest of these phony gods !
CEB	2%20Chronicles	13	10	“ But us ? The Lord is our God , and we haven ’ t abandoned him . Aaron ’ s descendants serve as the Lord ’ s priests , assisted in the work by the Levites .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	13	11	Every morning and every evening they offer entirely burned offerings and fragrant incense to the Lord , and set out bread in stacks upon a clean table . At night they light the lamps on the gold lampstand . Yes , while you are abandoning the Lord our God , we are doing what he requires .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	13	12	Listen ! God is on our side , at our head , along with his priests , who are ready to sound the battle trumpets against you . So , Israelites , don ’ t fight against the Lord , the God of your ancestors , for you won ’ t succeed ! ”
CEB	2%20Chronicles	13	14	When Judah looked around and suddenly realized that they were surrounded , they cried out to the Lord while the priests sounded the trumpets
CEB	2%20Chronicles	13	15	and raised the battle cry . When they raised the battle cry , God defeated Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	13	16	So the Israelites fled before Judah , and God gave Judah the victory .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	13	17	Abijah and his people struck them severely : five hundred thousand select warriors were killed .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	13	18	Israel was subdued on that occasion , and Judah succeeded because they relied on the Lord , the God of their ancestors .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	13	19	Abijah pursued Jeroboam and took these cities away from him : Bethel , Jeshanah , and Ephron , [ c ] along with their villages .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	13	20	Jeroboam failed to regain power during the time of Abijah . The Lord finally struck him down , and he died .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	13	21	Abijah , however , grew strong . He married fourteen wives ; he had twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	13	22	The rest of Abijah ’ s deeds , what he did and what he said , are written in the account of the prophet Iddo . Footnotes -

CEB	2%20Chronicles	14	14	and attacked all the cities surrounding Gerar who were terrified of the Lord . They plundered all these cities as well because there was a great amount of loot in them .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	14	3	He removed the foreign altars and shrines , smashed the sacred pillars , cut down the sacred poles , [ c ]
CEB	2%20Chronicles	14	4	and urged Judah to seek the Lord , the God of their ancestors , by doing what the Instruction and the commandments required .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	14	5	He also removed the shrines and incense altars from all the cities of Judah so that the kingdom was at peace under him .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	14	6	When the land was at peace , he built fortified cities in Judah ; there was no war in those years because the Lord had given him rest .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	14	7	“ Let ’ s build up these cities , ” Asa told Judah . “ We ’ ll surround them with walls , towers , gates , and crossbars while the land is still ours , because we sought the Lord our God and he sought us [ d ] and surrounded us with rest. ” As a result , the people successfully completed their building projects . Judah defeats Cush
CEB	2%20Chronicles	14	8	Asa had an army of three hundred thousand Judeans armed with body-sized shields and spears and another two hundred eighty thousand from Benjamin armed with small shields and bows . All were brave warriors .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	14	9	Zerah the Cushite marched against him with an army of one million men and three hundred chariots . When he got as far as Mareshah ,
CEB	2%20Chronicles	14	10	Asa marched against him , setting up for battle in a valley north [ e ] of Mareshah .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	14	11	Then Asa cried out to the Lord his God , “ Lord , only you can help the weak against the powerful . [ f ] Help us , Lord our God , because we rely on you and we have marched against this multitude in your name . You are the Lord our God . Don ’ t let a mere human stand against you ! ”
CEB	2%20Chronicles	14	12	So the Lord struck the Cushites before Asa and Judah , and the Cushites fled .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	14	13	Asa and his troops chased them as far as Gerar . The Cushites fell until there were no survivors . They were completely crushed by the Lord and his army , who carried off a huge amount of loot ,
CEB	2%20Chronicles	14	15	They also attacked the herdsmen ’ s camps , taking many sheep and camels before returning to Jerusalem . Footnotes -

CEB	2%20Chronicles	15	2	Chronicles 15:8 Cf Syr , Vulg ; MT and the prophecy of the prophet Oded
CEB	2%20Chronicles	15	15	All Judah was delighted with the solemn pledge because they had sworn it with all their hearts . When they enthusiastically sought God , he was found by them , and the Lord gave them peace on every side .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	15	3	For a long time Israel was without the true God , without a priest to teach them , and without the Instruction .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	15	4	But in their time of trouble they turned to the Lord , Israel ’ s God . They sought him and found him !
CEB	2%20Chronicles	15	5	At that time , it wasn ’ t safe to travel because great turmoil affected all the inhabitants of the area .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	15	6	Nation was crushed by nation and city by city , as God troubled them with every kind of problem .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	15	7	But as for you , be brave and don ’ t lose heart , because your work will be rewarded ! ” Asa ’ s reforms
CEB	2%20Chronicles	15	8	As soon as Asa heard these words and the prophecy of Azariah , Oded ’ s son , [ a ] he felt brave and removed the detestable idols from all of Judah and Benjamin , as well as from the cities he had captured in Ephraim ’ s highlands , and he repaired the Lord ’ s altar that stood before the Lord ’ s entrance hall .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	15	9	Then Asa gathered all Judah and Benjamin , along with those who were living among them as immigrants from Ephraim , Manasseh , and Simeon , because many people from Israel had joined up with him when they saw that the Lord his God was with him .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	15	10	They gathered in Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of Asa ’ s rule .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	15	11	On that day they sacrificed to the Lord part of the loot they had taken : seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	15	12	They made a covenant to seek the Lord , the God of their ancestors , with all their heart and all their being .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	15	13	They agreed that anyone who refused to seek the Lord , Israel ’ s God , would be put to death , whether young or old , male or female .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	15	14	They swore this to the Lord with a loud voice , shouts of joy , and blasts from trumpets and horns .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	15	16	Asa the king even removed his grandmother Maacah from the position of queen mother because she had made an image of Asherah . Asa cut down her image , pulverized it , and burned it in the Kidron Valley .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	15	17	Although the shrines weren ’ t removed from Israel , Asa nevertheless remained committed with all his heart throughout his life .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	15	18	He brought into God ’ s temple the various silver and gold objects that he and his father had dedicated .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	15	19	There was no war until the thirty-fifth year of Asa ’ s rule . Footnotes -
CEB	2%20Chronicles	16	2	Asa took silver and gold from the treasuries of the Lord ’ s temple and the royal palace and sent them to Aram ’ s King Ben-hadad , who ruled in Damascus , with the following message :
CEB	2%20Chronicles	16	16	In the thirty-sixth year of Asa ’ s rule , Israel ’ s King Baasha attacked Judah and fortified Ramah to prevent Judah ’ s King Asa from moving into that area .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	16	3	“ Let ’ s make a covenant similar to the one between our fathers . Since I have already sent you silver and gold , break your covenant with Israel ’ s King Baasha so that he will leave me alone. ”
CEB	2%20Chronicles	16	4	Ben-hadad agreed with King Asa and sent his army commanders against the cities of Israel , attacking Ijon , Dan , Abel-maim , and all the store-cities of Naphtali .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	16	5	As soon as Baasha learned of this , he stopped building Ramah and abandoned his work .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	16	6	Then King Asa had all Judah carry away the stone and timber that Baasha was using to build Ramah , and King Asa used it to build Geba and Mizpah .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	16	7	At that time Hanani the seer came to Judah ’ s King Asa and said to him , “ Because you relied on Aram ’ s king and not on the Lord your God , the army of Aram ’ s king has slipped out of your grasp .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	16	8	Weren ’ t the Cushites and the Libyans a vast army with chariots and horsemen to spare ? Still , when you relied on the Lord , he delivered them into your power ,
CEB	2%20Chronicles	16	9	because the Lord ’ s eyes scan the whole world to strengthen those who are committed to him with all their hearts . Your foolishness means that you will have war on your hands from now on. ”
CEB	2%20Chronicles	16	10	Asa was angry with the seer . Asa was so mad he threw Hanani in jail and took his anger out on some of the people . Asa ’ s disease and death
CEB	2%20Chronicles	16	11	The rest of Asa ’ s deeds , from beginning to end , are written in the official records of Israel ’ s and Judah ’ s kings .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	16	12	In the thirty-ninth year of his rule , Asa developed a severe foot disease . But even in his illness he refused to seek the Lord and consulted doctors instead .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	16	13	In the forty-first year of his rule , Asa lay down with his ancestors .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	16	14	He was buried in the tomb he had prepared for himself in David ’ s City , and was laid on a bed filled with sweet spices and various kinds of perfume , with a huge fire made in his honor .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	17	2	Chronicles 17:6 Heb asherim , perhaps objects devoted to the goddess Asherah
CEB	2%20Chronicles	17	17	From Benjamin came a valiant warrior : Eliada , together with two hundred thousand armed with bow and shield ;
CEB	2%20Chronicles	17	3	The Lord was with Jehoshaphat because he followed the earlier ways of his father [ a ] by not seeking Baal .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	17	4	Instead , he sought the God of his father , and unlike Israel , he followed God ’ s commandments .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	17	5	The Lord gave him firm control over the kingdom , and all Judah brought Jehoshaphat tribute , so that he had abundant riches and honor .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	17	6	Jehoshaphat took pride in the Lord ’ s ways and again removed the shrines and the sacred poles [ b ] from Judah .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	17	7	In the third year of his rule , Jehoshaphat sent his officials Ben-hail , Obadiah , Zechariah , Nethanel , and Micaiah to teach in the cities of Judah .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	17	8	They were accompanied by the Levites Shemaiah , Nethaniah , Zebadiah , Asahel , Shemiramoth , Jehonathan , Adonijah , Tobijah , and Tob-adonijah , and by the priests Elishama and Jehoram .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	17	9	They taught throughout Judah . They brought with them the Lord ’ s Instruction scroll as they made their rounds to all the cities of Judah , teaching the people .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	17	10	All the kingdoms surrounding Judah were afraid of the Lord and didn ’ t wage war against Jehoshaphat .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	17	11	Some of the Philistines brought a load of silver as tribute to Jehoshaphat . The Arabians also brought flocks to Jehoshaphat : seventy-seven hundred rams and seventy-seven hundred goats .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	17	12	As Jehoshaphat grew increasingly powerful , he built fortresses and storage cities in Judah
CEB	2%20Chronicles	17	13	and had many supplies in the cities of Judah . He also had an army of mighty warriors in Jerusalem ,
CEB	2%20Chronicles	17	14	registered by their clans as follows : Judah ’ s officers over units of a thousand included Commander Adnah with three hundred thousand soldiers ;
CEB	2%20Chronicles	17	15	next to him was Commander Jehohanan with two hundred eighty thousand soldiers ;
CEB	2%20Chronicles	17	16	at his side was Amasiah , Zichri ’ s son , who volunteered for the Lord with two hundred thousand soldiers .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	17	18	next to him was Jehozabad , together with one hundred eighty thousand soldiers .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	17	19	These were the individuals who served the king in addition to those the king placed in the fortified cities throughout Judah . Footnotes -
CEB	2%20Chronicles	18	2	Chronicles 18:13 LXX ,
CEB	2%20Chronicles	18	18	Then Micaiah said , “ Listen now to the Lord ’ s word : I saw the Lord enthroned with all the heavenly forces stationed at his right and at his left .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	18	3	“ Will you go with me to Ramoth-gilead ? ” Israel ’ s King Ahab asked Judah ’ s King Jehoshaphat . Jehoshaphat replied , “ I and my people will be united with you and your people in battle .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	18	4	But , ” Jehoshaphat said to Israel ’ s king , “ first , let ’ s see what the Lord has to say. ”
CEB	2%20Chronicles	18	5	So Israel ’ s king gathered four hundred prophets and asked them , “ Should we go to war with Ramoth-gilead or not ? ” “ Attack ! ” the prophets answered . “ God will hand it over to the king. ”
CEB	2%20Chronicles	18	6	But Jehoshaphat said , “ Isn ’ t there any other prophet of the Lord around whom we could ask ? ”
CEB	2%20Chronicles	18	7	“ There ’ s one other man who could ask the Lord for us , ” Israel ’ s king told Jehoshaphat , “ but I hate him because he never prophesies anything good about me , only bad . His name is Micaiah , Imlah ’ s son. ” “ The king shouldn ’ t speak like that ! ” Jehoshaphat said .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	18	8	So Israel ’ s king called an officer and ordered , “ Bring Micaiah , Imlah ’ s son , right away. ”
CEB	2%20Chronicles	18	9	Now Israel ’ s king and Judah ’ s King Jehoshaphat were sitting on their thrones dressed in their royal robes at the threshing floor beside the entrance to the gate of Samaria . All the prophets were prophesying in front of them .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	18	10	Zedekiah , Chenaanah ’ s son , made iron horns for himself and said , “ This is what the Lord says : With these horns you will gore the Arameans until there ’ s nothing left of them ! ”
CEB	2%20Chronicles	18	11	The other prophets agreed : “ Attack Ramoth-gilead and win ! The Lord will hand it over to the king ! ”
CEB	2%20Chronicles	18	12	Meanwhile , the messenger who had gone to summon Micaiah said to him , “ Listen , the prophets all agree that the king will succeed . You should say the same thing they say and prophesy success. ”
CEB	2%20Chronicles	18	13	But Micaiah answered , “ As surely as the Lord lives , I will say only what God tells me to say. ” [ a ]
CEB	2%20Chronicles	18	14	When Micaiah arrived , the king asked him , “ Micaiah , should we go to war with Ramoth-gilead or not ? ” “ Attack and win ! ” Micaiah answered . “ The Lord will hand it over to the king. ”
CEB	2%20Chronicles	18	15	But the king said , “ How many times must I demand that you tell me the truth when you speak in the Lord ’ s name ? ”
CEB	2%20Chronicles	18	16	Then Micaiah replied , “ I saw all Israel scattered on the hills like sheep without a shepherd ! And then the Lord said : ‘ They have no master . Let them return safely to their own homes. ’ ”
CEB	2%20Chronicles	18	17	Then Israel ’ s king said to Jehoshaphat , “ Didn ’ t I tell you ? He never prophesies anything good about me , only bad. ”
CEB	2%20Chronicles	18	19	The Lord said , ‘ Who will persuade Israel ’ s King Ahab so that he attacks Ramoth-gilead and dies there ? ’ There were several suggestions ,
CEB	2%20Chronicles	18	20	until one particular spirit approached the Lord and said , ‘ I will persuade him. ’ ‘ How ? ’ the Lord asked .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	18	21	‘ I will be a lying spirit in the mouths of all his prophets , ’ he said . The Lord agreed : ‘ You will succeed in persuading him ! Go ahead ! ’
CEB	2%20Chronicles	18	22	So now , since the Lord placed a lying spirit in the mouths of these prophets of yours , it is the Lord who has pronounced disaster against you ! ”
CEB	2%20Chronicles	18	23	Zedekiah , Chenaanah ’ s son , approached Micaiah and slapped him on the cheek . “ Just how did the Lord ’ s spirit leave me to speak to you ? ” he asked .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	18	24	Micaiah answered , “ You will find out on the day you try to hide in an inner room. ”
CEB	2%20Chronicles	18	25	“ Arrest him , ” ordered Israel ’ s king , “ and turn him over to Amon the city governor and to Joash the king ’ s son .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	18	26	Tell them , ‘ The king says : Put this man in prison and feed him minimum rations of bread and water until I return safely. ’ ”
CEB	2%20Chronicles	18	27	“ If you ever return safely , ” Micaiah replied , “ then the Lord wasn ’ t speaking through me. ” Then he added , “ Mark my words , every last one of you ! ”
CEB	2%20Chronicles	18	28	So Israel ’ s king and Judah ’ s King Jehoshaphat attacked Ramoth-gilead .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	18	29	Israel ’ s king said to Jehoshaphat , “ I will disguise myself when we go into battle , but you should wear your royal attire. ” When the king of Israel had disguised himself , they entered the battle .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	18	30	Meanwhile , Aram ’ s king had commanded his chariot officers , “ Don ’ t bother with anyone big or small . Fight only with Israel ’ s king. ”
CEB	2%20Chronicles	18	31	When the chariot officers saw Jehoshaphat , they assumed that he must be Israel ’ s king , so they turned to attack him . But when Jehoshaphat cried out , the Lord helped him , and God lured them away from him .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	18	32	When the chariot officers realized that he wasn ’ t Israel ’ s king , they stopped chasing him .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	18	33	Someone , however , randomly shot an arrow that struck Israel ’ s king between the joints in his armor . “ Turn around and get me out of the battle , ” the king told his chariot driver . “ I ’ ve been hit ! ”
CEB	2%20Chronicles	18	34	While the battle raged all that day , Israel ’ s king stood propped up in his chariot facing the Arameans . But that evening he died , just as the sun was going down . Footnotes -

CEB	2%20Chronicles	19	4	Though Jehoshaphat lived in Jerusalem , he regularly went out among the people between Beer-sheba and Ephraim ’ s highlands , and encouraged them to return to the Lord , the God of their ancestors .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	19	5	He appointed judges throughout the land in each of the fortified cities of Judah ,

CEB	2%20Chronicles	19	8	Jehoshaphat also appointed judges in Jerusalem from among the Levites , the priests , and the family heads of Israel to administer the Lord ’ s Instruction and to settle disputes among those living [ b ] in Jerusalem .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	19	9	He instructed them , “ You must respect the Lord at all times , in truth , and with complete integrity .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	19	10	In any case that comes before you from a fellow citizen in an outlying town , whether it involves bloodshed or is an issue of instruction , commandment , regulations , or case laws , you must warn them not to sin against the Lord , consequently making him angry with both you and your fellow citizen . Do this , and you won ’ t sin .

CEB	2%20Chronicles	20	3	Frightened , Jehoshaphat decided to seek the Lord ’ s help and proclaimed a fast for all Judah .

CEB	2%20Chronicles	20	5	Then Jehoshaphat stood up in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem in the Lord ’ s temple in front of the new courtyard .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	20	6	“ Lord , the God of our ancestors , you alone are God in heaven . You rule all the kingdoms of the nations . You are so powerful that no one can oppose you .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	20	7	You , our God , drove out the inhabitants of this land before your people Israel and gave this land to the descendants of your friend Abraham forever .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	20	8	They have lived in it and have built a sanctuary in honor of your name in it , saying ,
CEB	2%20Chronicles	20	9	‘ If calamity , sword , flood , [ c ] plague , or famine comes upon us , we will stand before this temple , before you , because your name is in this temple . We will cry out to you in our distress , and you will hear us and save us. ’
CEB	2%20Chronicles	20	10	So look here ! The Ammonites , the Moabites , and those from Mount Seir—the people you wouldn ’ t let Israel invade when they came out of Egypt ’ s land , so Israel avoided them and didn ’ t destroy them—
CEB	2%20Chronicles	20	11	here they are , returning the favor by coming to drive us out of your possession that you gave to us !
CEB	2%20Chronicles	20	12	Our God , won ’ t you punish them ? We are powerless against this mighty army that is about to attack us . We don ’ t know what to do , and so we are looking to you for help. ”
CEB	2%20Chronicles	20	13	All Judah was standing before the Lord , even their little ones , wives , and children .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	20	14	Then the Lord ’ s spirit came upon Jahaziel son of Zechariah son of Benaiah son of Jeiel son of Mattaniah , a Levite of the line of Asaph , as he stood in the middle of the assembly .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	20	15	“ Pay attention , all of Judah , every inhabitant of Jerusalem , and King Jehoshaphat , ” Jahaziel said . “ This is what the Lord says to you : Don ’ t be afraid or discouraged by this great army because the battle isn ’ t yours . It belongs to God !
CEB	2%20Chronicles	20	16	March out against them tomorrow . Since they will be coming through the Ziz pass , meet them at the end of the valley that opens into the Jeruel wilderness .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	20	17	You don ’ t need to fight this battle . Just take your places , stand ready , and watch how the Lord , who is with you , will deliver you , Judah and Jerusalem . Don ’ t be afraid or discouraged ! Go out tomorrow and face them . The Lord will be with you. ”
CEB	2%20Chronicles	20	18	Then Jehoshaphat bowed down with his face to the ground , and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the Lord in worship .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	20	19	Levites from the lines of Kohath and Korah stood up to loudly praise the Lord , the God of Israel .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	20	21	After consulting with the people , Jehoshaphat appointed musicians to play for the Lord , praising his majestic holiness . They were to march out before the warriors , saying , “ Give thanks to the Lord because his faithful love lasts forever ! ”
CEB	2%20Chronicles	20	22	As they broke into joyful song and praise , the Lord launched a surprise attack against the Ammonites , the Moabites , and those from Mount Seir who were invading Judah , so that they were defeated .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	20	23	The Ammonites and the Moabites turned on those from Mount Seir , completely destroying them . Once they had finished off the inhabitants of Seir , they helped to destroy each other !
CEB	2%20Chronicles	20	24	When Judah arrived at the point overlooking the wilderness , all they could see were corpses lying all over the ground . There were no survivors .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	20	25	When Jehoshaphat and his army came to take the loot , they found a great amount of cattle , [ d ] goods , clothing , [ e ] and other valuables—much more than they could carry . In fact , there was so much it took three days to haul it away .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	20	26	On the fourth day they assembled in Blessing Valley , where they blessed the Lord . That ’ s why it is called Blessing Valley to this day .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	20	27	Then everyone from Judah and Jerusalem , with Jehoshaphat at their head , joyfully returned home to Jerusalem because the Lord had given them reason to rejoice over their enemies .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	20	28	They entered Jerusalem accompanied by harps , lutes , and trumpets , and they went to the Lord ’ s temple .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	20	29	The fear of God came on all the surrounding kingdoms when they heard how the Lord had fought against Israel ’ s enemies .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	20	30	As a result , Jehoshaphat ’ s rule was peaceful because his God gave him rest on all sides . Jehoshaphat ’ s last days

CEB	2%20Chronicles	20	33	with the exception that he didn ’ t remove the shrines . The people were still not committed with all their hearts to the God of their ancestors .

CEB	2%20Chronicles	20	36	They agreed to build a fleet of Tarshish-styled ships , and they built them in Ezion-geber .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	20	37	Eliezer , Dodavahu ’ s son from Mareshah , prophesied against Jehoshaphat : “ Because you have formed an alliance with Ahaziah , the Lord will destroy what you have made. ” The ships were wrecked and couldn ’ t sail to Tarshish . Footnotes -

CEB	2%20Chronicles	21	9	Jehoram , along with all his chariots , crossed over to Zair . [ a ] The Edomites , who had surrounded him , attacked at night , defeating him [ b ] and his chariot officers .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	21	10	So Edom has been independent of Judah to this day . Libnah rebelled against Jehoram ’ s rule at the same time because he had abandoned the Lord , the God of his ancestors .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	21	11	As if that wasn ’ t enough , Jehoram constructed shrines throughout Judah ’ s highlands , encouraged Jerusalem ’ s citizens to be unfaithful , and led Judah astray .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	21	12	A letter from the prophet Elijah came to Jehoram that read , “ This is what the Lord , the God of your ancestor David , says : Because you haven ’ t walked in the ways of your father Jehoshaphat or the ways of Judah ’ s King Asa ,
CEB	2%20Chronicles	21	13	but have walked in the ways of Israel ’ s kings and have encouraged Judah and Jerusalem ’ s citizens to be unfaithful , just as the house of Ahab did , and because you have even murdered your own brothers , your father ’ s family , who were better than you ,
CEB	2%20Chronicles	21	14	the Lord will now strike your family , your children , your wives , and all your possessions with a heavy blow .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	21	15	You yourself will become deathly ill with a chronic disease that will cause your intestines to fall out. ”
CEB	2%20Chronicles	21	16	Then the Lord made the Philistines and the Arabs , who lived near the Cushites , angry with Jehoram .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	21	17	They attacked Judah , broke down its defenses , and hauled off all the goods that were found in the royal palace , along with the king ’ s children and wives . Only Jehoahaz , Jehoram ’ s youngest son , was spared .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	21	18	After all this , the Lord struck Jehoram with an incurable intestinal disease .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	21	19	For almost two years he grew steadily worse , until two days before his death , when his intestines fell out , causing him to die in horrible pain . His people didn ’ t make a fire in his honor as they had done for his ancestors .

CEB	2%20Chronicles	22	4	He did what was evil in the Lord ’ s eyes , just as Ahab ’ s dynasty had done , because after his father ’ s death they gave him advice that led to his downfall .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	22	5	Ahaziah was following their advice when he went with Israel ’ s King Joram , [ b ] Ahab ’ s son , to fight against Aram ’ s King Hazael at Ramoth-gilead , where the Arameans wounded Joram .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	22	6	Joram returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds he suffered at Ramah in his battle with Aram ’ s King Hazael . Then Judah ’ s King Ahaziah , [ c ] Jehoram ’ s son , went down to visit Joram , Ahab ’ s son , at Jezreel because he had been wounded .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	22	7	But God used this visit to Joram to bring about Ahaziah ’ s downfall . After his arrival , Ahaziah went with Joram to meet Jehu , Nimshi ’ s son , whom the Lord had anointed to destroy Ahab ’ s dynasty .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	22	8	While Jehu was executing judgment on Ahab ’ s dynasty , he discovered the princes of Judah , Ahaziah ’ s nephews , serving Ahaziah , and Jehu killed them .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	22	9	Jehu went looking for Ahaziah , who was captured while hiding in Samaria . He was then brought to Jehu and executed . He was given a decent burial , however , because people said , “ He was the grandson of Jehoshaphat , who sought the Lord with all his heart. ” There were now no members of Ahaziah ’ s dynasty strong enough to rule the kingdom . Queen Athaliah rules Judah

CEB	2%20Chronicles	23	3	The entire assembly made a covenant with the king in God ’ s temple . Jehoiada said , “ Look ! Here is the king ’ s son . He must be king , just as the Lord promised about David ’ s descendants .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	23	4	This is what you must do : A third of you priests and Levites coming on sabbath duty will guard the gates ,

CEB	2%20Chronicles	23	8	The Levites and all Judah did everything that the priest Jehoiada ordered . They each took charge of those men reporting for duty on the Sabbath , as well as those going off duty , since Jehoiada hadn ’ t released any divisions from duty .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	23	9	Then the priest Jehoiada gave the unit commanders King David ’ s spears and large and small shields that were kept in God ’ s temple .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	23	10	He positioned all the people , each with their weapons drawn , near the altar and the temple , stretching from the south side of the temple to the north side , so as to protect the king .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	23	11	Then they brought out the king ’ s son , crowned him , gave him the royal law , [ a ] and made him king . Jehoiada and his sons anointed him as everyone cried out , “ Long live the king ! ”

CEB	2%20Chronicles	23	13	and saw the king standing by the royal pillar at the entrance , with the commanders and trumpeters beside the king . All the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets , and singers accompanied by musical instruments were leading the praise . Athaliah ripped her clothes and screamed , “ Treason ! Treason ! ”
CEB	2%20Chronicles	23	14	Then the priest Jehoiada brought out the unit commanders who were in charge of the army . “ Take her out under guard , ” [ b ] he told them , “ and kill anyone who follows her. ” This was because the priest had said , “ She must not be executed in the Lord ’ s temple. ”
CEB	2%20Chronicles	23	15	They arrested her when she reached the entrance of the Horse Gate at the royal palace . She was executed there .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	23	16	Jehoiada then made a covenant between himself , all the people , and the king , that they would be the Lord ’ s people .

CEB	2%20Chronicles	23	19	He posted guards at the gates of the Lord ’ s temple so that no one who was unclean in any way could enter .

CEB	2%20Chronicles	24	6	So the king summoned the chief priest Jehoiada and asked him , “ Why haven ’ t you required the Levites to bring in from Judah and Jerusalem the tax imposed by the Lord ’ s servant Moses and the Israelite assembly for the covenant tent ? ” (
CEB	2%20Chronicles	24	8	So at the king ’ s command a box was made and placed outside the gate of the Lord ’ s temple .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	24	9	Then a proclamation was issued throughout Judah and Jerusalem requiring the people to bring to the Lord the tax that God ’ s servant Moses had imposed on Israel in the wilderness .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	24	10	This so pleased all the leaders and all the people that they gladly dropped their money in the box until it was full .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	24	11	Whenever the box was brought by the Levites to the royal accountants , as soon as they saw that a large amount of money was in the box , the royal scribe and the representative of the high priest would come , empty the box , and return it to its place . This took place day after day , and a large amount of money was collected .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	24	12	The king and Jehoiada would give it to those in charge of the work on the Lord ’ s temple who in turn hired masons and carpenters to renovate the Lord ’ s temple , as well as metalworkers for the iron and bronze to repair the Lord ’ s temple .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	24	13	The workers labored hard , and the restoration progressed smoothly under their control until they had brought God ’ s temple back to its original state and reinforced it .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	24	14	As soon as they finished , they brought the remaining money to the king and Jehoiada . They used it to make equipment for the Lord ’ s temple , including what was used for the service and the entirely burned offerings , pans , and other objects made of gold and silver .

CEB	2%20Chronicles	24	17	After Jehoiada ’ s death , however , the leaders of Judah came and bowed before the king , and the king listened to them .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	24	18	They abandoned the temple of the Lord , their ancestors ’ God , and worshipped sacred poles [ b ] and idols . Anger came upon Judah and Jerusalem as a consequence of their sin ,
CEB	2%20Chronicles	24	19	and though God sent prophets to them to bring them back to the Lord and to warn them , they refused to listen .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	24	20	Then the spirit of God enwrapped Zechariah the son of the priest Jehoiada . Standing before the people , he told them , “ This is what God says : Why do you defy the Lord ’ s commands and keep yourselves from prospering ? Because you have abandoned the Lord , he has abandoned you ! ”

CEB	2%20Chronicles	25	4	However , he didn ’ t kill their children because of what is written in the Instruction scroll from Moses , where the Lord commanded , Parents shouldn ’ t be executed because of what their children have done ; neither should children be executed because of what their parents have done .

CEB	2%20Chronicles	25	6	He also hired one hundred thousand warriors from Israel for one hundred kikkars of silver .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	25	7	But a man of God confronted him . “ King , ” he said , “ the troops from Israel must not go with you , because the Lord isn ’ t on the side of Israel or any Ephraimite .

CEB	2%20Chronicles	25	9	Amaziah asked the man of God , “ What about the hundred kikkars I paid for the Israelite troops ? ” “ God can give you much more than that , ” the man of God replied .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	25	10	Amaziah released the Ephraimite troops who had joined him so they could go home , but this only infuriated them against Judah , and they left in a rage .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	25	11	Amaziah courageously led his people to the Salt Valley , where they killed ten thousand people from Seir .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	25	12	The Judean forces captured another ten thousand alive , brought them to the top of a cliff , and threw them off so that all were dashed to pieces .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	25	13	Meanwhile , the troops Amaziah had released from fighting alongside him raided cities in Judah from Samaria to Beth-horon , killing three thousand people and carrying off a large amount of loot .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	25	14	When Amaziah returned after defeating the Edomites , he brought the gods of the people of Seir . He set them up as his own gods , bowed down before them , and burned incense to them .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	25	15	As a result , the Lord was angry with Amaziah and sent a prophet to him . “ Why do you seek the gods of this people ? ” the prophet asked . “ They couldn ’ t even deliver their own people from you ! ”
CEB	2%20Chronicles	25	16	“ Since when do you give me advice ? ” Amaziah interrupted . “ You better quit before you end up dead ! ” So the prophet stopped , but not until he said , “ I know God plans to destroy you because you ’ ve done this and because you ’ ve refused to listen to my advice. ”
CEB	2%20Chronicles	25	17	After Judah ’ s King Amaziah consulted with his advisors , he sent a challenge to Israel ’ s King Joash , Jehoahaz ’ s son and Jehu ’ s grandson . “ Come on , ” he said , “ let ’ s go head-to-head ! ”
CEB	2%20Chronicles	25	18	Israel ’ s King Joash sent the following reply to Judah ’ s King Amaziah : “ Once upon a time , a thistle in Lebanon sent a message to a cedar : ‘ Give your daughter to my son as a wife. ’ But then a wild beast in Lebanon came along and trampled the thistle .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	25	19	Do you think that because you ’ ve defeated Edom , you can arrogantly seek even more ? Stay home ! Why invite disaster when both you and Judah will fall ? ”

CEB	2%20Chronicles	26	7	God helped him against the Philistines , the Arabs who inhabited Gur , [ c ] and the Meunites .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	26	8	The Meunites [ d ] paid taxes to Uzziah , whose fame spread even to Egypt because he had grown so powerful .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	26	9	He built towers in Jerusalem , at the Corner Gate , the Valley Gate , and at the Angle , and reinforced them .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	26	10	He also built towers in the wilderness and dug many wells for his large herds in the lowlands and the plain . He had many workers who tended his farms and vineyards , because he loved the soil .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	26	11	Uzziah had a standing army equipped for combat whose units went to war according to the number determined by the scribe Jeiel and Maaseiah , an officer under the authority of Hananiah , one of the king ’ s officials .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	26	12	The grand total of family heads in charge of these courageous warriors was twenty-six hundred .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	26	13	They commanded an army of three hundred seven thousand five hundred . They formed a powerful force that could support the king against the enemy .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	26	14	Uzziah supplied the entire force with shields , spears , helmets , armor , bows , and sling stones .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	26	15	He set up clever devices in Jerusalem on the towers and corners of the wall designed to shoot arrows and large stones . And so Uzziah ’ s fame spread far and wide , because he had received wonderful help until he became powerful .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	26	17	The priest Azariah , accompanied by eighty other of the Lord ’ s courageous priests , went in after him
CEB	2%20Chronicles	26	18	and confronted King Uzziah . “ You have no right , Uzziah , ” he said , “ to burn incense to the Lord ! That privilege belongs to the priests , Aaron ’ s descendants , who have been ordained to burn incense . Get out of this holy place because you have been unfaithful ! The Lord God won ’ t honor you for this. ”
CEB	2%20Chronicles	26	19	Then Uzziah , who already had a censer in his hand ready to burn the incense , became angry . While he was fuming at the priests , skin disease [ e ] erupted on his forehead in the presence of the priests before the incense altar in the Lord ’ s temple .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	26	20	When Azariah the chief priest and all the other priests turned and saw the skin disease on his forehead , they rushed him out of there . Uzziah also was anxious to leave because the Lord had afflicted him .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	26	21	King Uzziah had skin disease until the day he died . He lived in a separate house , [ f ] diseased in his skin , because he was barred from the Lord ’ s temple . His son Jotham supervised the palace administration and governed the people of the land .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	26	22	The rest of Uzziah ’ s deeds , from beginning to end , were written down by the prophet Isaiah , Amoz ’ s son .

CEB	2%20Chronicles	28	3	and burning incense in the Ben-hinnom Valley . He even burned his own sons alive , imitating the detestable practices of the nations the Lord had driven out before the Israelites .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	28	4	He also sacrificed and burned incense at the shrines on every hill and beneath every shady tree .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	28	5	So the Lord his God handed him over to Aram ’ s king , who defeated him and carried off many prisoners , bringing them to Damascus . Ahaz was also handed over to Israel ’ s king , who defeated him with a severe beating .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	28	6	In Judah , Pekah , Remaliah ’ s son , killed one hundred twenty thousand warriors in the course of a single day because they had abandoned the Lord , God of their ancestors .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	28	7	An Ephraimite warrior named Zichri killed the king ’ s son Maaseiah , the palace administrator Azrikam , and Elkanah , the king ’ s second in command .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	28	8	The Israelites took captive two hundred thousand women , boys , and girls from their Judean relatives and seized enormous amounts of plunder , which they took back to Samaria .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	28	9	One of the Lord ’ s prophets named Oded lived in Samaria . When the army arrived there , he went to meet them and said , “ Don ’ t you see that the Lord God of your ancestors was angry with Judah and let you defeat them ? But look what you ’ ve done ! Your merciless slaughter of them stinks to high heaven !
CEB	2%20Chronicles	28	10	And now you think you can enslave the men and women of Judah and Jerusalem ? What about your own guilt before the Lord your God ?
CEB	2%20Chronicles	28	11	Listen to me ! Send back the captives you took from your relatives , because the Lord is furious with you. ”
CEB	2%20Chronicles	28	12	At this , some of the Ephraimite leaders—Johanan ’ s son Azariah , Meshillemoth ’ s son Berechiah , Shallum ’ s son Jehizkiah , and Hadlai ’ s son Amasa—confronted those returning from battle .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	28	13	“ Don ’ t bring the captives here , ” they told them . “ Your plan will only add to our sin and guilt before the Lord . We ’ re already guilty enough , and great anger is already directed at Israel. ”
CEB	2%20Chronicles	28	14	So the warriors released the captives and brought the loot before the officers and the whole assembly .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	28	15	Then people named for this task took charge of the captives and dressed everyone who was naked with items taken from the loot . They gave them clothing , sandals , food and drink , and bandaged their wounds . Everyone who couldn ’ t walk they placed on donkeys , and they brought them to Jericho , Palm City , near their Judean relatives . Then they returned to Samaria .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	28	16	At that time King Ahaz sent for help from the king [ a ] of Assyria .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	28	17	Once again , the Edomites had invaded Judah , defeating Judah and carrying off captives .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	28	18	The Philistines had raided the towns in the lowlands and the arid southern plain of Judah , capturing Beth-shemesh , Aijalon , and Gederoth , along with Soco and its surrounding villages , Timnah and its surrounding villages , and Gimzo and its surrounding villages , and occupying all of these cities .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	28	19	The Lord was humiliating Judah on account of Israel ’ s King Ahaz , because he had exercised no restraint in Judah and had been utterly unfaithful to the Lord .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	28	21	Even though Ahaz took items from the Lord ’ s temple , the royal palace , and the officials to buy off the king of Assyria , it was of no help .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	28	22	It was during this troubled time that King Ahaz became even more unfaithful to the Lord
CEB	2%20Chronicles	28	23	by sacrificing to the gods of Damascus , who had defeated him . “ Since the gods of Aram ’ s kings are helping them , ” he said , “ I ’ ll sacrifice to them too , so that they will help me. ” But they became the ruin of both him and all Israel .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	28	24	Ahaz gathered the objects from God ’ s temple , cut them up , shut the doors of the Lord ’ s temple , and made himself altars on every corner in Jerusalem .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	28	25	He made shrines in all the towns of Judah for burning incense to other gods . This made the Lord , the God of his ancestors , very angry .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	28	26	The rest of Ahaz ’ s deeds , from beginning to end , are written in the official records of Israel ’ s and Judah ’ s kings .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	28	27	Ahaz lay down with his ancestors and was buried in the city , in Jerusalem , but not in the royal cemetery of Israel ’ s kings . His son Hezekiah succeeded him as king . Footnotes -
CEB	2%20Chronicles	29	2	Chronicles 29:17 March–April , Nisan
CEB	2%20Chronicles	29	29	After the entirely burned offering was complete , the king and all who were with him bowed down in worship .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	29	25	Hezekiah had the Levites stand in the Lord ’ s temple with cymbals , harps , and zithers , just as the Lord had ordered through David , the king ’ s seer Gad , and the prophet Nathan .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	29	3	In the very first year of his rule , during the first month , Hezekiah reopened the doors of the Lord ’ s temple , having repaired them .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	29	4	Then he brought in the priests and Levites and assembled them in the eastern square .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	29	5	“ Listen to me , you Levites ! ” he said . “ Make yourselves holy so you can make holy the temple of the Lord God of your ancestors by removing from the sanctuary any impure thing .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	29	6	Our ancestors were unfaithful and did what was evil in the Lord our God ’ s eyes . They abandoned him , they ignored the Lord ’ s dwelling , and they defied him .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	29	7	They even closed the doors of the entrance hall , snuffed out the lamps , and stopped burning incense and offering entirely burned offerings in the sanctuary of the God of Israel .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	29	8	This angered the Lord so much that he made Judah and Jerusalem an object of terror and horror , something people hiss at , as you can see with your own eyes .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	29	9	That ’ s why our ancestors died violent deaths , while our sons , daughters , and wives were taken captive .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	29	10	But now I intend to make a covenant with the Lord , Israel ’ s God , so God will no longer be angry with us .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	29	11	Don ’ t be careless , my sons ! The Lord has chosen you to stand in his presence to serve him , so that you can be his servants and burn incense to him. ”
CEB	2%20Chronicles	29	12	Then the following Levites got up : from the descendants of the Kohathites : Mahath , Amasai ’ s son , and Joel , Azariah ’ s son ; from the descendants of Merari : Kish , Abdi ’ s son , and Azariah , Jehallelel ’ s son ; from the Gershonites : Joah , Zimmah ’ s son , and Eden , Joah ’ s son ;
CEB	2%20Chronicles	29	13	from the descendants of Elizaphan : Shimri and Jeuel ; from the descendants of Asaph : Zechariah and Mattaniah ;
CEB	2%20Chronicles	29	14	from the descendants of Heman : Jehuel and Shimei ; and from the descendants of Jeduthun : Shemaiah and Uzziel .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	29	15	These men gathered their relatives , made themselves holy , and went in to purify the Lord ’ s temple by obeying the king ’ s command as the Lord had told him .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	29	16	The priests went in to purify the inner portion of the Lord ’ s temple . They brought out to the courtyard of the Lord ’ s temple all the impurities they discovered inside . Then the Levites took them out to the Kidron Valley .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	29	17	They began to make things holy on the first day of the first month . [ a ] On the eighth day of the month they reached the Lord ’ s entrance hall . They made holy the Lord ’ s temple for eight days , finishing on the sixteenth day of the first month .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	29	18	Then they went before King Hezekiah . “ We have purified the Lord ’ s entire temple , ” they said , “ and the altar for the entirely burned offering together with all its equipment , and the table for the stacks of bread together with all its equipment .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	29	19	We have also restored and made holy all the items King Ahaz threw out during his rule in his unfaithfulness . They are now before the Lord ’ s altar. ” Hezekiah rededicates the temple
CEB	2%20Chronicles	29	20	Early the next morning Hezekiah gathered the city leaders and went to the Lord ’ s temple .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	29	21	They brought seven bulls , seven rams , and seven lambs , along with seven male goats , for a purification offering on behalf of the kingdom , the sanctuary , and Judah . Hezekiah ordered the priests , Aaron ’ s sons , to offer them up on the Lord ’ s altar .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	29	22	When they slaughtered the bulls , the priests took the blood and splashed it against the altar . Next they slaughtered the rams and splashed their blood against the altar , and also slaughtered the lambs , splashing their blood against the altar as well .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	29	23	Finally , they brought the goats for the purification offering before the king and the assembly . After laying their hands on them ,
CEB	2%20Chronicles	29	24	the priests slaughtered them and smeared the blood on the altar as a purification offering to take away the sin of all Israel , because the king had specifically ordered that the entirely burned sacrifice and the purification offering should be on behalf of all Israel .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	29	26	While the Levites took their places holding David ’ s instruments , and the priests their trumpets ,
CEB	2%20Chronicles	29	27	Hezekiah ordered the entirely burned offering to be offered up on the altar . As they began to offer the entirely burned offering , the Lord ’ s song also began , accompanied by the trumpets and the other instruments of Israel ’ s King David .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	29	28	The whole congregation worshipped with singing choirs and blaring trumpets until the end of the entirely burned offering .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	29	30	Then King Hezekiah and the leaders ordered the Levites to praise the Lord by using the words of David and the seer Asaph . They did so joyously ; then they bowed down in worship too .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	29	31	“ Now that you have dedicated yourselves to the Lord , ” King Hezekiah told them , “ bring sacrificial thank offerings to the Lord ’ s temple. ” So the assembly brought sacrificial thank offerings , with some people volunteering to provide entirely burned offerings .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	29	32	All in all , the congregation brought seventy bulls , a hundred rams , and two hundred lambs as entirely burned offerings for the Lord ,
CEB	2%20Chronicles	29	33	as well as six hundred bulls and three thousand sheep as holy offerings .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	29	34	Unfortunately , there weren ’ t enough priests to skin all these entirely burned offerings . So their relatives the Levites ( who had been more conscientious about preparing themselves than the priests ) stepped in and helped them until the work was done or additional priests had made themselves holy .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	29	35	In addition to the wealth of entirely burned offerings , there was the fat of the well-being sacrifices and drink offerings accompanying the entirely burned offerings . In this way , the service of the Lord ’ s temple was restored ,
CEB	2%20Chronicles	29	36	and Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced at what God had done for them , since it had happened so quickly . Footnotes -
CEB	2%20Chronicles	30	2	Chronicles 30:2 April–May , Iyar
CEB	2%20Chronicles	30	30	Then Hezekiah sent word to all Israel and Judah , and wrote letters to Ephraim and Manasseh as well , inviting them to the Lord ’ s temple in Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover of the Lord God of Israel .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	30	3	They had been unable to celebrate it at the usual time because the priests had failed to make themselves holy in sufficient numbers , and the people hadn ’ t gathered at Jerusalem .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	30	4	Since the plan seemed good to the king and the entire congregation ,
CEB	2%20Chronicles	30	5	they made arrangements to circulate an announcement throughout all Israel , from Beer-sheba to Dan , to come to Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover of the Lord God of Israel , because they hadn ’ t often kept it as written .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	30	6	Under the authority of the king , runners took letters from the king and his officials throughout all Israel and Judah , which read : People of Israel ! Return to the Lord , the God of Abraham , Isaac , and Israel , so that he may return to those of you who remain , who have escaped capture by the Assyrian kings .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	30	7	Don ’ t be like your ancestors and relatives , who were unfaithful to the Lord , the God of their ancestors , so that he made them an object of horror as you can see for yourselves .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	30	8	So don ’ t be stubborn like your ancestors . Surrender to the Lord ! Come to God ’ s sanctuary , which he has made holy forever , and serve the Lord your God so that he won ’ t be angry with you any longer .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	30	9	When you return to the Lord , your relatives and your children will receive mercy from their captors and be allowed to return to this land . The Lord your God is merciful and compassionate . He won ’ t withdraw his presence from you if you return to him .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	30	10	So the runners went from town to town in Ephraim and Manasseh , all the way to Zebulun . But they were laughed at and made fun of .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	30	11	Even so , some people from Asher , Manasseh , and Zebulun were submissive and came to Jerusalem .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	30	12	Moreover , God ’ s power was at work in Judah , unifying them to do what the king and his officials had ordered by the Lord ’ s command .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	30	13	A huge crowd gathered in Jerusalem to celebrate the Festival of Unleavened Bread in the second month . A very large congregation gathered .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	30	14	First , they removed the altars in Jerusalem , and hauled off the incense altars and dumped them in the Kidron Valley .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	30	15	They slaughtered the Passover lambs on the fourteenth day of the second month . Ashamed of themselves , the priests and the Levites made themselves holy and brought entirely burned offerings to the Lord ’ s temple .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	30	16	They now took their places as laid out in the Instruction from Moses the man of God , and the priests splashed the blood they received from the Levites against the altar .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	30	17	Since many in the congregation hadn ’ t made themselves holy , the Levites slaughtered the Passover lambs , making them holy to the Lord for all who weren ’ t ceremonially clean .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	30	18	This included most of those who had come from Ephraim , Manasseh , Issachar , and Zebulun—people who hadn ’ t purified themselves and so hadn ’ t eaten the Passover meal in the prescribed way . But Hezekiah prayed for them : “ May the good Lord forgive
CEB	2%20Chronicles	30	19	everyone who has decided to seek the true God , the Lord , the God of their ancestors , even though they aren ’ t ceremonially clean by sanctuary standards. ”
CEB	2%20Chronicles	30	20	The Lord heard Hezekiah and healed the people .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	30	21	So the Israelites in Jerusalem joyfully celebrated the Festival of Unleavened Bread for seven days , with the Levites and the priests praising the Lord every day , accompanied by the Lord ’ s mighty instruments .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	30	22	Hezekiah congratulated all the Levites who had performed so skillfully for the Lord . They feasted throughout the seven days of the festival , sacrificing well-being offerings and praising the Lord , the God of their ancestors .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	30	23	Then the whole congregation agreed to celebrate another seven days , which they joyfully did .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	30	24	Judah ’ s King Hezekiah contributed one thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep for the congregation , while the officials provided another thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep , and great numbers of priests made themselves holy .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	30	25	Then the whole congregation of Judah rejoiced , as did the priests and the Levites , the whole congregation from Israel , the immigrants who had come from the land of Israel , and those who lived in Judah .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	30	26	There was great joy in Jerusalem . Nothing like this had taken place in Jerusalem since the days of Israel ’ s King Solomon , David ’ s son .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	30	27	Then the levitical priests blessed the people , and their voice was heard when their prayer reached God ’ s holy dwelling in heaven . Footnotes -

Then all the Israelites returned to their individual homes in their own cities . Hezekiah ’ s reform
CEB	2%20Chronicles	31	3	As his portion , the king personally contributed the entirely burned offerings for the morning and evening sacrifices , as well as the entirely burned offerings for the Sabbaths , new moons , and festivals , as written in the Lord ’ s Instruction .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	31	4	He ordered the people living in Jerusalem to provide the required portion for the priests and the Levites so they could devote themselves to the Lord ’ s Instruction .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	31	5	As soon as the order was issued , the Israelites generously gave the best of their grain , new wine , oil , honey , and all their crops—a tenth of everything , a huge amount .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	31	6	The people of Israel and Judah , living in the cities of Judah , also brought in a tenth of their herds and flocks and a tenth of the items that had been dedicated to the Lord their God , stacking it up in piles .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	31	7	They began stacking up the piles in the third month [ b ] and finished them in the seventh . [ c ]
CEB	2%20Chronicles	31	8	When Hezekiah and the officials saw the piles , they blessed the Lord and his people Israel .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	31	9	When Hezekiah asked the priests and Levites about the piles ,
CEB	2%20Chronicles	31	10	the chief priest Azariah , who was from Zadok ’ s family , answered , “ Ever since the people started bringing contributions to the Lord ’ s temple we ’ ve had enough to eat with plenty to spare . The Lord has definitely blessed his people ! There ’ s a lot left over. ”
CEB	2%20Chronicles	31	11	So Hezekiah ordered them to prepare storerooms in the Lord ’ s temple . When they finished preparing them ,
CEB	2%20Chronicles	31	12	the priests conscientiously brought in the contributions , the tenth-part gifts , and the dedicated things . Conaniah , a Levite , was put in charge , assisted by his brother Shimei ,
CEB	2%20Chronicles	31	13	while Jehiel , Azaziah , Nahath , Asahel , Jerimoth , Jozabad , Eliel , Ismachiah , Mahath , and Benaiah served as supervisors under them , as appointed by King Hezekiah and Azariah the official in charge of God ’ s temple .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	31	14	The Levite Kore , Imnah ’ s son , who was keeper of the east gate , was in charge of the spontaneous gifts to God . He was responsible for distributing the contribution reserved for the Lord and the dedicated gifts .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	31	15	Eden , Miniamin , Jeshua , Shemaiah , Amariah , and Shecaniah faithfully assisted him regarding [ d ] the priests by distributing the portions to their relatives , old and young alike , by divisions .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	31	16	Additionally , they also distributed daily rations to those males , registered by genealogy , three years old and older , all who entered the Lord ’ s temple to carry out their daily duties as their divisions required .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	31	17	They also distributed to those priests registered by their families , and to Levites
CEB	2%20Chronicles	31	20	This is what Hezekiah did throughout all Judah , doing what the Lord his God considered good , right , and true .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	31	18	The official genealogy included all their small children , their wives , their sons , and their daughters—the entire congregation—for they had faithfully made themselves holy .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	31	19	As for Aaron ’ s descendants , the priests who lived in the outskirts of the cities , men were assigned to distribute portions to every male among the priests and to every Levite listed in the genealogical records .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	31	21	Everything that Hezekiah began to do for the service of God ’ s temple , whether by the Instruction or the commands , in order to seek his God , he did successfully and with all his heart . Footnotes -

CEB	2%20Chronicles	32	3	he consulted with his officials and soldiers about stopping up the springs outside the city , and they supported him .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	32	4	A large force gathered to stop up all the springs and the streams that flowed through the land . “ Why should the kings of Assyria come and find plenty of water ? ” they asked .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	32	5	Hezekiah vigorously rebuilt all the broken sections of the wall , erected towers , constructed another wall outside the first , reinforced the terrace of David ’ s City , and made a large supply of weapons and shields .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	32	6	He appointed military officers over the troops , assembled them in the square of the city gate , and spoke these words of encouragement :

CEB	2%20Chronicles	32	8	All he has is human strength , but we have the Lord our God , who will help us fight our battles ! ” The troops trusted Judah ’ s King Hezekiah .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	32	9	After this Assyria ’ s King Sennacherib , who was attacking Lachish with all his forces , sent his servants to Jerusalem with the following message for Judah ’ s King Hezekiah and all the people of Judah who were in Jerusalem :
CEB	2%20Chronicles	32	10	This is what Assyria ’ s King Sennacherib says : What makes you so confident that you stay put in Jerusalem while it is being attacked ?
CEB	2%20Chronicles	32	11	Obviously , Hezekiah has fooled you into surrendering yourselves to death by hunger and thirst when he says , “ The Lord our God will rescue us from Assyria ’ s king. ”
CEB	2%20Chronicles	32	12	Isn ’ t this the same Hezekiah who got rid of his shrines and altars , and then demanded of Judah and Jerusalem , “ You must worship and burn incense before only one altar ” ?
CEB	2%20Chronicles	32	13	Don ’ t you know what I and my predecessors have done to the people of other nations ? Were any of the gods of these other nations able to rescue their lands from my power ?
CEB	2%20Chronicles	32	14	Which one of any of the gods of these nations that my predecessors destroyed was able to rescue them from my power ? So why should your god be able to rescue you from my power ?
CEB	2%20Chronicles	32	15	Don ’ t let Hezekiah seduce you like fools . Don ’ t believe him ! No god of any other nation or kingdom has been able to rescue their people from me or from my predecessors . No , your gods won ’ t rescue you from my power .

CEB	2%20Chronicles	33	5	Manasseh built altars for all the stars in the sky in both courtyards of the Lord ’ s temple .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	33	6	He burned his own sons alive in the Ben-hinnom Valley , consulted sign readers , fortune-tellers , and sorcerers , and used mediums and diviners . He did much evil in the Lord ’ s eyes and made him angry .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	33	7	Manasseh set up the carved image he had made in God ’ s temple , the very temple God had spoken about to David and his son Solomon , saying : In this temple and in Jerusalem , which I have selected out of all Israel ’ s tribes , I will put my name forever .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	33	8	I will never again remove Israel from the fertile land I gave to your ancestors , provided they carefully do everything I have commanded them—keeping all the Instruction , the regulations , and the case laws given through Moses .

CEB	2%20Chronicles	33	10	The Lord spoke to Manasseh and his people , but they wouldn ’ t listen .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	33	11	So the Lord brought the army commanders of Assyria ’ s king against them . They captured Manasseh with hooks , bound him with bronze chains , and carried him off to Babylon .

CEB	2%20Chronicles	34	3	In the eighth year of his rule , while he was just a boy , he began to seek the God of his ancestor David , and in the twelfth year he began purifying Judah and Jerusalem of the shrines , the sacred poles , [ a ] idols , and images .

CEB	2%20Chronicles	34	17	They have released the money that was found in the Lord ’ s temple and have handed it over to the supervisors and the workers. ”

CEB	2%20Chronicles	34	19	As soon as the king heard what the Instruction scroll said , he ripped his clothes .

CEB	2%20Chronicles	34	21	“ Go and ask the Lord on my behalf , and on behalf of those who still remain in Israel and Judah , concerning the contents of this scroll that has been found . The Lord must be furious with us because our ancestors failed to obey the Lord ’ s word and do everything written in this scroll. ”

CEB	2%20Chronicles	34	23	she replied , “ This is what the Lord , Israel ’ s God , says : Tell this to the man who sent you to me :

CEB	2%20Chronicles	34	25	My anger burns against this place , never to be quenched , because they ’ ve deserted me and have burned incense to other gods , angering me by everything they have done . [ d ]
CEB	2%20Chronicles	34	26	But also say this to the king of Judah , who sent you to question the Lord : This is what the Lord , Israel ’ s God , says about the message you ’ ve just heard :
CEB	2%20Chronicles	34	27	Because your heart was broken and you submitted before the Lord when you heard what he said against this place and its citizens , [ e ] and because you ripped your clothes and cried before me , I have listened to you , declares the Lord .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	34	28	I will gather you to your ancestors , and you will go to your grave in peace . You won ’ t experience the disaster I am about to bring on this place and its citizens. ” When they reported Huldah ’ s words to the king ,
CEB	2%20Chronicles	34	29	the king sent a message and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	34	30	Then the king went up to the Lord ’ s temple , together with all the people of Judah and all the citizens of Jerusalem , the priests and the Levites , and all the people , young and old alike . There the king read out loud all the words of the covenant scroll that had been found in the Lord ’ s temple .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	34	31	The king stood in his place and made a covenant with the Lord that he would follow the Lord by keeping his commandments , his instructions , and his regulations with all his heart and all his being , in order to fulfill the words of the covenant that were written in this scroll .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	34	32	Then he made everyone found in Jerusalem and Benjamin join in a similar promise . The citizens of Jerusalem lived according to the covenant made with God , the God of their ancestors .

I ’ m after the dynasty that wars with me . God told me to hurry , and he is on my side . Get out of God ’ s way , or he will destroy you. ”
CEB	2%20Chronicles	35	22	But Josiah wouldn ’ t turn back . Instead , he camouflaged himself in preparation for battle , refusing to listen to Neco ’ s words from God ’ s own mouth , and went to fight Neco on the plain of Megiddo .
CEB	2%20Chronicles	35	23	When archers shot King Josiah , he said to his servants , “ Take me away ; I ’ m badly wounded ! ”

CEB	Ezra	2	68	When they arrived at the Lord ’ s house in Jerusalem , some of the heads of the families brought spontaneous gifts for the rebuilding of God ’ s house on its site .
CEB	Ezra	2	69	According to their means , they gave to the building fund 61,000 drachmen of gold , 5,000 manehs of silver , and
CEB	Ezra	2	100	priestly robes .
CEB	Ezra	2	70	The priests , the Levites , some of the people , the singers , the gatekeepers , and the temple servants settled in their own towns , and all Israel in their towns .
CEB	Ezra	3	3	They set up the altar on its foundations , [ b ] because they were afraid of the neighboring peoples , [ c ] and they offered entirely burned offerings upon it to the Lord , both the morning and the evening offerings .
CEB	Ezra	3	2	Then Jeshua , Jozadak ’ s son along with his fellow priests , and Zerubbabel , Shealtiel ’ s son along with his kin , started to rebuild the altar of Israel ’ s God so that they might offer entirely burned offerings upon it as prescribed in the Instruction from Moses the man of God .
CEB	Ezra	3	4	They celebrated the Festival of Booths , as prescribed . Every day they presented the number of entirely burned offerings required by ordinance for that day .
CEB	Ezra	3	5	After this , they presented the continual burned offerings , the offerings at the new moons , and at all the sacred feasts of the Lord , and the offerings of everyone who brought a spontaneous gift to the Lord .
CEB	Ezra	3	6	From the first day of the seventh month , they began to present entirely burned offerings to the Lord . However , the foundation of the Lord ’ s temple had not yet been laid .
CEB	Ezra	3	7	So they gave money to the masons and carpenters ; and food , drink , and oil to the Sidonians and the Tyrians to bring cedarwood by sea from Lebanon to Joppa , according to the authorization given them by Persia ’ s King Cyrus . Laying the foundations of God ’ s house
CEB	Ezra	3	8	In the second month of the second year after their arrival at God ’ s house in Jerusalem , Zerubbabel , Shealtiel ’ s son , and Jeshua , Jozadak ’ s son , and the rest of their kin—the priests and the Levites and all who had come from the captivity to Jerusalem—made a beginning . They appointed Levites
CEB	Ezra	3	20	years old and above to oversee the work on the Lord ’ s house .
CEB	Ezra	3	9	Then Jeshua with his sons and his kin , Kadmiel and his sons , Binnui and his sons , the sons of Judah , along with the sons of Henadad , the Levites , and their sons and kin , collaborated to supervise the workers in God ’ s house .
CEB	Ezra	3	10	When the builders laid the foundation of the Lord ’ s temple , the priests clothed in their vests and carrying their trumpets , and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals , arose to praise the Lord according to the directions of Israel ’ s King David .
CEB	Ezra	3	11	They praised and gave thanks to the Lord , singing responsively , “ He is good , his graciousness for Israel lasts forever. ” All of the people shouted with praise to the Lord because the foundation of the Lord ’ s house had been laid .
CEB	Ezra	3	12	But many of the older priests and Levites and heads of families , who had seen the first house , wept aloud when they saw the foundation of this house , although many others shouted loudly with joy .
CEB	Ezra	3	13	No one could distinguish the sound of the joyful shout from the sound of the people ’ s weeping , because the people rejoiced very loudly . The sound was heard at a great distance .
CEB	Ezra	4	4	The neighboring peoples [ a ] discouraged the people of Judah , made them afraid to build ,
CEB	Ezra	4	2	they came to Zerubbabel and the heads of the families and said to them , “ Let ’ s build with you , for we worship your God as you do , and we ’ ve been sacrificing to him ever since the days of Assyria ’ s King Esarhaddon , who brought us here. ”
CEB	Ezra	4	3	But Zerubbabel , Jeshua , and the rest of the heads of the families in Israel replied , “ You ’ ll have no part with us in building a house for our God . We alone will build because the Lord , the God of Israel , and Persia ’ s King Cyrus commanded us. ”
CEB	Ezra	4	5	and bribed officials to frustrate their plan . They did this throughout the rule of Persia ’ s King Cyrus until the rule of Persia ’ s King Darius . Writing to King Artaxerxes
CEB	Ezra	4	6	In the rule of Ahasuerus , at the beginning of his rule , they composed an indictment against those who lived in Judah and Jerusalem .
CEB	Ezra	4	7	In the days of Artaxerxes , Bishlam , Mithredath , Tabeel , and the rest of their associates wrote to Persia ’ s King Artaxerxes . The letter was written in Aramaic and translated . [ b ]
CEB	Ezra	4	8	Rehum the royal deputy and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter concerning Jerusalem to King Artaxerxes as follows :
CEB	Ezra	4	9	From Rehum the royal deputy and Shimshai the scribe and the rest of their colleagues , the judges , the administrators , the officials , the Persians , the people of Erech , the Babylonians , the people of Susa ( that is , the Elamites ) ,
CEB	Ezra	4	10	and the rest of the nations whom the great and famous Osnappar deported and settled in the cities of Samaria and in the rest of the province Beyond the River . (
CEB	Ezra	4	11	This is a copy of the letter they sent to him . ) To King Artaxerxes from your servants , the people of the province Beyond the River .
CEB	Ezra	4	12	May it be known to the king that the Jews who left you and came to us have arrived in Jerusalem . They are rebuilding the rebellious and wicked city ; they are completing the walls and repairing the foundations .
CEB	Ezra	4	13	May it be known to the king that if this city is rebuilt and the walls completed , they will not pay tribute or tax or dues , and the royal revenue will be reduced .
CEB	Ezra	4	14	Since we receive our salary from the palace , [ c ] and since it is not fitting for us to witness the king ’ s dishonor , we now send this letter [ d ] and inform the king
CEB	Ezra	4	15	so that you may search the records of your ancestors . You will discover in the records that this is a rebellious city , harmful to kings and provinces , and that it has been in revolt over a long period of time . As a result , this city was laid waste .
CEB	Ezra	4	16	We tell the king that if this city is rebuilt and its walls completed , you will then have no possession in the province Beyond the River . Artaxerxes responds
CEB	Ezra	4	17	The king sent this answer : Greetings to Rehum the royal deputy and Shimshai the scribe and the rest of their colleagues who live in Samaria and elsewhere in the province Beyond the River .
CEB	Ezra	4	18	The entire letter that you sent to us has been read in translation for me .
CEB	Ezra	4	19	I issued an order ; they searched and discovered that this city has revolted against kings over a long period of time . There has been much rebellion and revolt there .
CEB	Ezra	4	20	However , there have been mighty kings over Jerusalem who also ruled over the whole province Beyond the River . Tribute and taxes and dues were paid to them .
CEB	Ezra	4	21	Therefore , issue an order to stop these people : this city is not to be rebuilt until I make a decree .
CEB	Ezra	4	22	Be sure to carry out this order ! Why should danger grow and threaten the king ?
CEB	Ezra	4	23	When the copy of King Artaxerxes ’ letter was read before Rehum and Shimshai the scribe and their colleagues , they hurried to Jerusalem to oppose the Jews and made them stop by force of arms . [ e ]
CEB	Ezra	4	24	At that time the work on God ’ s house in Jerusalem stopped and was suspended until the second year of the rule of Persia ’ s King Darius .
CEB	Ezra	5	5	But their God looked after the elders of the Jews , and they didn ’ t stop them until a report reached Darius and a letter with his response had arrived . Writing to King Darius
CEB	Ezra	5	2	Subsequently , Zerubbabel , Shealtiel ’ s son , and Jeshua , Jozadak ’ s son , began to rebuild God ’ s house in Jerusalem . God ’ s prophets were with them , helping them .
CEB	Ezra	5	3	At the same time , Tattenai , the governor of the province Beyond the River , and Shethar-bozenai and their colleagues came to them and spoke to them , asking , “ Who authorized you to build this house and finish preparing [ a ] this building material ? ” [ b ]
CEB	Ezra	5	4	They [ c ] also asked them , “ What are the names of the people who are building this building ? ”
CEB	Ezra	5	6	This is a copy of the letter that Tattenai , the governor of the province Beyond the River , and Shethar-bozenai and his colleagues the officials who were in the province Beyond the River sent to King Darius .
CEB	Ezra	5	7	In the message they sent him , the following was written : To King Darius , all peace !
CEB	Ezra	5	8	Let the king know that we went to the province of Judah , to the house of the great God . It is being built with dressed stone and with timber set into the walls . This work makes good progress and prospers in their hands .
CEB	Ezra	5	9	We asked those elders , “ Who authorized you to build this house and to complete the preparation of this material ? ”
CEB	Ezra	5	10	We also asked them their names so that we could write down the names of the leaders for your information .
CEB	Ezra	5	11	This was their reply to us : “ We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth . We are rebuilding the house that was built many years ago , which a great king of Israel built and completed .
CEB	Ezra	5	12	But because our ancestors angered the God of heaven , he gave them over into the power of Babylon ’ s King Nebuchadnezzar , the Chaldean , who destroyed this house and deported the people to Babylonia .
CEB	Ezra	5	13	However , in the first year of his rule , Babylon ’ s King Cyrus issued a decree to rebuild this house of God .
CEB	Ezra	5	14	King Cyrus also took the gold and silver equipment from God ’ s house out of the temple in Babylon ( the ones that Nebuchadnezzar took from the temple in Jerusalem and placed in the temple in Babylon ) and gave them to a man named Sheshbazzar , whom he had appointed governor .
CEB	Ezra	5	15	Cyrus said to him , ‘ Take this equipment and go and put it in Jerusalem ’ s temple , and let God ’ s house be rebuilt on its original site. ’
CEB	Ezra	5	16	Then Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundations of God ’ s house in Jerusalem . From then until now the rebuilding work has continued but is not yet complete. ”
CEB	Ezra	5	17	And now , if it seems good to the king , may a search be made in the royal archives in Babylon to see if King Cyrus had issued a decree to rebuild this house of God in Jerusalem . Then may the king be pleased to send us his decision about this matter .
CEB	Ezra	6	6	Now you , Tattenai , governor of the province Beyond the River , Shethar-bozenai , and you , their colleagues , the officials in the province Beyond the River , keep away !
CEB	Ezra	6	2	But a scroll was found in Ecbatana , the capital of the province of Media , on which was written the following : A memorandum—
CEB	Ezra	6	3	In the first year of his rule , King Cyrus made a decree : Concerning God ’ s house in Jerusalem : Let the house at the place where they offered sacrifices be rebuilt and let its foundations be retained . Its height will be ninety feet and its width ninety feet ,
CEB	Ezra	6	4	with three layers of dressed stones and one [ a ] layer of timber . The cost will be paid from the royal treasury .
CEB	Ezra	6	5	In addition , the gold and silver equipment from God ’ s house , which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple in Jerusalem and brought to Babylon , is to be restored , that is , brought back to Jerusalem and put in their proper place in God ’ s house .
CEB	Ezra	6	7	Leave the work on this house of God alone . Let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews rebuild this house of God on its original site .
CEB	Ezra	6	8	I also issue a decree about what you should do to help these elders of the Jews as they rebuild this house of God : The total cost is to be paid to these people , and without delay , from the royal revenue that is made up of the tribute of the province Beyond the River .
CEB	Ezra	6	9	And whatever is needed—young bulls , rams , or sheep for entirely burned offerings to the God of heaven , wheat , salt , wine , or oil , as requested by the priests in Jerusalem—let that be given to them day by day without fail
CEB	Ezra	6	10	so that they may offer pleasing sacrifices to the God of heaven and pray for the lives of the king and his sons .
CEB	Ezra	6	11	I also decree that if anyone disobeys this edict , a beam is to be pulled out of the house of the guilty party , and the guilty party will then be impaled upon it . The house will be turned into a trash heap .
CEB	Ezra	6	12	May the God who has established his name there overthrow any king or people who try to change this order or to destroy God ’ s house in Jerusalem . I , Darius , have decreed it ; let it be done with all diligence . God ’ s house is completed and dedicated
CEB	Ezra	6	13	Then Tattenai , the governor of the province Beyond the River , Shethar-bozenai , and their colleagues carried out the order of King Darius with all diligence .
CEB	Ezra	6	14	So the elders of the Jews built and prospered because of the prophesying of the prophet Haggai and Zechariah , Iddo ’ s son . They finished building by the command of Israel ’ s God and of Cyrus , Darius , and King Artaxerxes of Persia .
CEB	Ezra	6	15	This house was completed on the third day of the month of Adar , [ b ] in the sixth year of the rule of King Darius .
CEB	Ezra	6	16	Then the Israelites , the priests and the Levites , and the rest of the returned exiles joyfully celebrated the dedication of this house of God .
CEB	Ezra	6	17	At the dedication of this house of God , they offered one hundred bulls , two hundred rams , four hundred lambs , and as a purification offering for all Israel , twelve male goats , according to the number of the tribes of Israel .
CEB	Ezra	6	18	They set the priests in their divisions and the Levites in their sections for the service of God in Jerusalem , as it is written in the scroll from Moses .
CEB	Ezra	6	19	[ c ] On the fourteenth day of the first month , [ d ] the returned exiles celebrated the Passover .
CEB	Ezra	6	20	All of the priests and the Levites had purified themselves ; all of them were clean . They slaughtered the Passover animals for all the returned exiles , their fellow priests , and themselves .
CEB	Ezra	6	21	The Israelites who had returned from exile , together with all those who had joined them by separating themselves from the pollutions of the nations of the land to worship the Lord , the God of Israel , ate the Passover meal . [ e ]
CEB	Ezra	6	22	They also joyfully celebrated the Festival of Unleavened Bread for seven days , because the Lord had made them joyful by changing the attitude of the king of Assyria toward them so that he assisted them in the work on the house of God , the God of Israel .
CEB	Ezra	7	7	Some of the Israelites and some of the priests and the Levites , the singers and gatekeepers and the temple servants also came up to Jerusalem in the seventh year of King Artaxerxes .
CEB	Ezra	7	2	son of Shallum son of Zadok son of Ahitub
CEB	Ezra	7	3	son of Amariah son of Azariah son of Meraioth
CEB	Ezra	7	4	son of Zerahiah son of Uzzi son of Bukki
CEB	Ezra	7	5	son of Abishua son of Phinehas son of Eleazar son of Aaron the chief priest—
CEB	Ezra	7	6	this Ezra came up from Babylon . He was a scribe skilled in the Instruction from Moses , which the Lord , the God of Israel , had given . Moreover , the king gave him everything he requested because the Lord his God ’ s power was with him .
CEB	Ezra	7	8	They reached Jerusalem in the fifth month , in the seventh year of the king .
CEB	Ezra	7	9	The journey from Babylon began on the first day of the first month , and they came to Jerusalem on the first day of the fifth month , for the gracious hand of his God was upon him .
CEB	Ezra	7	10	Ezra had determined to study and perform the Lord ’ s Instruction , and to teach law and justice in Israel . Letter from Artaxerxes
CEB	Ezra	7	11	This is a copy of the letter that Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the priest and scribe , a scholar of the text of the Lord ’ s commandments and his requirements for Israel :
CEB	Ezra	7	12	[ a ] Artaxerxes , king of kings , to Ezra the priest , the scribe of the Instruction from the God of heaven . Peace ! [ b ] And now
CEB	Ezra	7	13	I decree that any of the people of Israel or their priests or Levites in my kingdom who volunteer to go to Jerusalem with you may go .
CEB	Ezra	7	14	You are sent by the king and his seven counselors to investigate Judah and Jerusalem according to the Instruction from your God , which is in your hand .
CEB	Ezra	7	15	You should bring the silver and gold that the king and his counselors have freely offered to the God of Israel , whose dwelling is in Jerusalem ,
CEB	Ezra	7	16	together with any of the silver and gold that you find in the entire province of Babylonia . You should also bring the spontaneous gifts of the people and the priests , given freely for God ’ s house in Jerusalem .
CEB	Ezra	7	17	With this money you will be careful to buy bulls , rams , and lambs , as well as their grain offerings and their drink offerings . And you will offer them on the altar of God ’ s house in Jerusalem .
CEB	Ezra	7	18	As long as it is God ’ s will , you and your colleagues may do what you think best with the rest of the silver and gold .
CEB	Ezra	7	19	You will deliver the equipment that has been given to you for the service of God ’ s house to the God of Jerusalem .
CEB	Ezra	7	20	If anything else is required for God ’ s house that you are responsible to provide , you may provide it from the royal treasury .
CEB	Ezra	7	21	I , King Artaxerxes , decree to all of the treasurers in the province Beyond the River : Whatever Ezra the priest and scribe of the Instruction from the God of heaven requires of you , it must be provided precisely ,
CEB	Ezra	7	22	even up to one hundred kikkars of silver , one hundred kors of wheat , one hundred baths [ c ] of wine , one hundred baths of oil , and unlimited salt .
CEB	Ezra	7	23	Whatever the God of heaven commands will be done carefully for the house of the God of heaven , or wrath will come upon the realm of the king and his heirs .
CEB	Ezra	7	24	You must also know that it is illegal for you to charge tribute , custom , or dues on any of the priests and Levites , the singers , the doorkeepers , the temple servants , or other servants of this house of God .
CEB	Ezra	7	25	And you , Ezra , based on the divine wisdom that you have , appoint supervisors and judges to adjudicate among all the people in the province Beyond the River who know the laws of your God . You will also teach those who do not know them .
CEB	Ezra	7	26	Let judgment be strictly carried out upon anyone who does not obey the Instruction from your God and the law of your king , including death , banishment , confiscation of property , or imprisonment . Ezra prepares to leave
CEB	Ezra	7	27	Bless the Lord , the God of our ancestors , who has moved the king to glorify the Lord ’ s house in Jerusalem ,
CEB	Ezra	7	28	and who has demonstrated his graciousness for me before the king and his counselors and all the king ’ s mighty officers . I took courage because the Lord my God ’ s power was with me . I gathered leaders from Israel to go up with me . Footnotes - Ezra 7:12 7:12-26 is written in Aramaic . - Ezra 7:12 Syr , Vulg

CEB	Ezra	8	14	of Bigvai , Uthai and Zaccur and with them were
CEB	Ezra	8	15	I gathered them by the river that runs to Ahava , and there we camped for three days . As I reviewed the people and the priests , I found no Levites there .
CEB	Ezra	8	16	So I called for Eliezer , Ariel , Shemaiah , Elnathan , Jarib , Elnathan , Nathan , Zechariah , and Meshullam , all leaders , together with Joiarib and Elnathan , who were wise .
CEB	Ezra	8	17	I sent them [ d ] to Iddo , the leader at the place named Casiphia , telling them what to say to Iddo and his colleagues the temple servants at Casiphia , namely , to send us ministers for God ’ s house .
CEB	Ezra	8	18	Because we were favored by God , they brought us Sherebiah , a skillful man of the family of Mahli , Levi ’ s son and Israel ’ s grandson , together with his sons and relatives so that there were eighteen in total .
CEB	Ezra	8	19	They also brought us Hashabiah and with him Jeshaiah of the family of Merari , together with his relatives and their sons so that there were twenty in total .
CEB	Ezra	8	20	In addition , there were two hundred twenty temple servants whom David and the princes had appointed to serve the Levites . These were all recorded by name .
CEB	Ezra	8	21	Then I called for a fast there at the Ahava River so that we might submit before our God and ask of him a safe journey for ourselves , our children , and all our possessions .
CEB	Ezra	8	22	I had been ashamed to ask the king for a group of soldiers and cavalry to help us in facing enemies on the way , because we had told the king , “ The power of God favors all who seek him , but his fierce wrath is against all who abandon him. ”
CEB	Ezra	8	23	So we fasted and prayed to our God for this , and he responded to us .
CEB	Ezra	8	24	Then I selected twelve of the leading priests , Sherebiah and Hashabiah and ten of their relatives with them .
CEB	Ezra	8	25	I weighed out to them the silver and the gold and the equipment , the offering for the house of our God that the king , his counselors , his officials , and all Israel present there had offered .
CEB	Ezra	8	26	I weighed out into their keeping six hundred fifty kikkars of silver , one hundred silver containers weighing a certain number of kikkars , one hundred kikkars of gold ,
CEB	Ezra	8	27	twenty gold bowls worth one thousand darics , and two containers of highly polished copper , which were as precious as gold .
CEB	Ezra	8	29	Guard them carefully until you weigh them out in Jerusalem before the officials of the priests , the Levites , and the heads of the families of Israel , within the rooms of the Lord ’ s house. ”
CEB	Ezra	8	30	So the priests and the Levites received the silver and the gold and the utensils as they were weighed out , in order to bring them to Jerusalem , to our God ’ s house .
CEB	Ezra	8	31	Then we left the Ahava River on the twelfth day of the first month [ e ] to go to Jerusalem . The power of our God was with us ; he saved us from the power of the enemy and ambushes along the way . Finishing the journey
CEB	Ezra	8	32	After arriving in Jerusalem , we rested there three days .
CEB	Ezra	8	33	On the fourth day , the silver and the gold and the equipment were weighed out in our God ’ s house into the care of the priest named Meremoth , Uriah ’ s son , together with Eleazar , Phinehas ’ son ; and the Levites , Jozabad , Jeshua ’ s son , and Noadiah , Binnui ’ s son .
CEB	Ezra	8	34	Everything was counted and weighed , and the total weight was recorded .
CEB	Ezra	8	35	At that time , those who had come from the captivity , the returned exiles , offered as entirely burned offerings to the God of Israel twelve bulls for all Israel , ninety-six rams , seventy-seven lambs , and twelve male goats as a purification offering . All this was an entirely burned offering to the Lord .
CEB	Ezra	8	36	They also delivered the king ’ s orders to the royal chief administrators and governors of the province Beyond the River , who supported the people and God ’ s house . Footnotes - Ezra 8:3 LXX and

CEB	Ezra	9	9	Even though we are slaves , our God hasn ’ t abandoned us in our slavery . Instead , he ’ s shown us his graciousness before Persia ’ s kings by reviving us to set up our God ’ s house , to repair its ruins , and to give us a wall in Judea and Jerusalem .
CEB	Ezra	9	2	They ’ ve taken some of their daughters as wives for themselves and their sons , and the holy descendants have become mixed with the neighboring peoples . [ a ] Moreover , the officials and leaders have led the way in this unfaithfulness. ”
CEB	Ezra	9	3	When I heard this , I tore my clothes and cloak , pulled out hair from my head and beard , and sat down in shock .
CEB	Ezra	9	4	Then all those who trembled at the words of the God of Israel gathered around me on account of the transgression of the returned exiles while I remained sitting in shock until the evening sacrifice . Ezra prays
CEB	Ezra	9	5	At the time of the evening sacrifice , I ended my penitential acts . While still wearing [ b ] my torn clothes and cloak , I fell upon my knees , spread out my hands to the Lord my God ,
CEB	Ezra	9	6	and said , “ My God , I ’ m too ashamed to lift up my face to you . Our iniquities have risen higher than our heads , and our guilt has grown to the heavens .
CEB	Ezra	9	7	“ From the days of our ancestors to this day , we ’ ve been deep in guilt . On account of our iniquities we , our kings , and our priests have been handed over to the kings of the lands , to the sword , to captivity , to plundering , and to utter shame , as is now the case .
CEB	Ezra	9	8	“ But now , for a brief while the Lord our God has shown favor in leaving us survivors and in giving us a stake in his holy place . Our God cheered us [ c ] and revived us for a little while in our slavery .
CEB	Ezra	9	10	“ And now , our God , what will we say after this ? We have abandoned your commandments ,
CEB	Ezra	9	11	which you commanded through your servants the prophets , saying : ‘ The land which you are about to enter to possess is a land polluted by the impurity of the neighboring peoples . [ d ] Their detestable practices have filled it with uncleanness from end to end .
CEB	Ezra	9	12	So now , do not give your daughters to their sons in marriage , do not take their sons for your daughters to marry , and never seek their peace or prosperity . This is so you may be strong , and eat the good of the land , and leave it for an inheritance to your children forever. ’
CEB	Ezra	9	13	“ After all that has happened to us because of our evil deeds and our great guilt—although you , our God , have punished us less than our iniquities deserve and have allowed us to survive as we do—
CEB	Ezra	9	14	will we once again break your commandments and intermarry with the peoples who practice these detestable things ? Would you not be so angry with us that you leave us without remnant or survivor ?
CEB	Ezra	9	15	Lord , God of Israel , you are righteous , for we have survived and a few remain until now . Here we are before you in our guilt , though no one can face you because of this guilt. ” [ e ]
CEB	Ezra	10	10	Then Ezra the priest stood up and said to them , “ You have been unfaithful by marrying foreign women and adding to Israel ’ s guilt .
CEB	Ezra	10	2	Then Shecaniah , Jehiel ’ s son , from the family of Elam , spoke up and said to Ezra , “ We ’ ve been unfaithful to our God by marrying foreign women from the neighboring peoples . [ a ] But even now , there is hope for Israel in spite of this .
CEB	Ezra	10	3	Let ’ s now make a covenant with our God to send away all these wives and their children , according to the advice of my master and of those who tremble at the commandment of our God . Let it be done according to the Instruction .
CEB	Ezra	10	4	Get up , for it is your duty to deal with this matter ; we will support you . Be strong and act. ”
CEB	Ezra	10	5	So Ezra got up and made the leading priests , the Levites , and all Israel take a solemn pledge that they would do as had been said . So they took a solemn pledge . The assembly decides
CEB	Ezra	10	6	Then Ezra got up from the area in front of God ’ s house and went to the room of Jehohanan , Eliashib ’ s son , where he spent [ b ] the night . He didn ’ t eat food or drink water , for he was mourning because of the unfaithfulness of the exiles .
CEB	Ezra	10	7	An order was then circulated throughout Judah and Jerusalem that all the returned exiles should gather in Jerusalem .
CEB	Ezra	10	8	All those who failed to appear within three days , as mandated by the officials and elders , would have all their property taken away . They would be separated from the congregation of the exiles .
CEB	Ezra	10	9	So within three days , all the people of Judah and Benjamin gathered in Jerusalem . It was the twentieth day of the ninth month . [ c ] All of the people sat in the area in front of God ’ s house , trembling because of this order and because of the heavy rain .
CEB	Ezra	10	11	But now , make a confession to the Lord God of your ancestors and do his will . Separate yourselves from the neighboring peoples [ d ] and from the foreign wives. ”
CEB	Ezra	10	12	The whole assembly shouted in reply , “ Yes . We must do as you have said .
CEB	Ezra	10	13	But there are many people , and it ’ s the rainy season ; we can ’ t continue to stand outside . Nor can this task be completed in a day or two because many of us have sinned in this matter .
CEB	Ezra	10	14	Let our leaders represent the entire assembly . Let all in our towns who have taken foreign wives come at appointed times , along with the elders and judges of every town , until God ’ s great anger at us on account of this matter be averted. ”
CEB	Ezra	10	15	Only Jonathan , Asahel ’ s son , and Jahzeiah , Tikvah ’ s son , opposed this ; Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levites supported them . Resolving the issue
CEB	Ezra	10	16	Then the returned exiles did so . Ezra the priest chose [ e ] certain men , heads of families , each representing their family houses . Each of them was designated by name . On the first day of the tenth month [ f ] they sat down to examine the matter .
CEB	Ezra	10	17	By the first day of the first month , [ g ] they had come to the end of all the men who had married foreign women .

CEB	Nehemiah	1	1	These are the words of Nehemiah , Hacaliah ’ s son . In the month of Kislev , [ a ] in the twentieth year , [ b ] while I was in the fortress city of Susa ,
CEB	Nehemiah	1	2	Hanani , one of my brothers , came with some other men from Judah . I asked them about the Jews who had escaped and survived the captivity , and about Jerusalem .
CEB	Nehemiah	1	3	They told me , “ Those in the province who survived the captivity are in great trouble and shame ! The wall around Jerusalem is broken down , and its gates have been destroyed by fire ! ” Confession
CEB	Nehemiah	1	4	When I heard this news , I sat down and wept . I mourned for days , fasting and praying before the God of heaven .
CEB	Nehemiah	1	5	I said : “ Lord God of heaven , great and awesome God , you are the one who keeps covenant and is truly faithful to those who love you and keep your commandments .
CEB	Nehemiah	1	6	Let your ear be attentive and your eyes open to hear the prayer of your servant , which I now pray before you night and day for your servants , the people of Israel . “ I confess the sins of the people of Israel , which we have committed against you . Both I and my family have sinned .
CEB	Nehemiah	1	7	We have wronged you greatly . We haven ’ t kept the commandments , the statutes , and the ordinances that you commanded your servant Moses .
CEB	Nehemiah	1	8	“ Remember the word that you gave to your servant Moses when you said , ‘ If you are unfaithful , I will scatter you among the peoples .
CEB	Nehemiah	1	9	But if you return to me and keep my commandments by really doing them , then , even though your outcasts live [ c ] under distant skies , I will gather them from there and bring them to the place that I have chosen as a dwelling for my name. ’
CEB	Nehemiah	1	10	They are your servants and your people . They are the ones whom you have redeemed by your great power and your strong hand .
CEB	Nehemiah	1	11	“ Lord , let your ear be attentive to the prayer of your servant and to the prayer of your servants who delight in honoring your name . Please give success to your servant today and grant him favor in the presence of this man ! ” Cupbearer ’ s plea At that time , I was a cupbearer to the king .

CEB	Nehemiah	2	2	the king asked me , “ Why do you seem sad ? Since you aren ’ t sick , you must have a broken heart ! ” I was very afraid
CEB	Nehemiah	2	1	In the month of Nisan , [ a ] in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes , the king was about to be served wine . I took the wine and gave it to the king . Since I had never seemed sad in his presence ,
CEB	Nehemiah	2	3	and replied , “ May the king live forever ! Why shouldn ’ t I seem sad when the city , the place of my family ’ s graves , is in ruins and its gates destroyed by fire ? ”
CEB	Nehemiah	2	4	The king asked , “ What is it that you need ? ” I prayed to the God of heaven
CEB	Nehemiah	2	5	and replied , “ If it pleases the king , and if your servant has found favor with you , please send me to Judah , to the city of my family ’ s graves so that I may rebuild it. ”
CEB	Nehemiah	2	6	With the queen sitting beside him , the king asked me , “ How long will you be away and when will you return ? ” So it pleased the king to send me , and I told him how long I would be gone .
CEB	Nehemiah	2	7	I also said to him , “ If it pleases the king , may letters be given me addressed to the governors of the province Beyond the River to allow me to travel to Judah .
CEB	Nehemiah	2	8	May the king also issue a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king ’ s forest , directing him to supply me with timber for the beams of the temple fortress gates , for the city wall , and for the house in which I will live. ” The king gave me what I asked , for the gracious power of my God was with me . Inspecting Jerusalem
CEB	Nehemiah	2	9	So I went to the governors of the province [ b ] Beyond the River and gave them the king ’ s letters . The king had sent officers of the army and cavalry with me .
CEB	Nehemiah	2	10	When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard this , they were very angry that someone had come to seek the welfare of the people of Israel .
CEB	Nehemiah	2	11	When I reached Jerusalem and had been there for three days ,
CEB	Nehemiah	2	12	I set out at night , taking only a few people with me . I didn ’ t tell anyone what my God was prompting me to do for Jerusalem , and the only animal I took was the one I rode .
CEB	Nehemiah	2	13	I went out by night through the Valley Gate past the Dragon ’ s Spring to the Dung Gate so that I could inspect the walls of Jerusalem that had been broken down , as well as its gates , which had been destroyed by fire .
CEB	Nehemiah	2	14	Then I went on to the Spring Gate and to the King ’ s Pool . Since there was no room for the animal on which I was riding to pass ,
CEB	Nehemiah	2	15	I went up by way of the valley by night and inspected the wall . Then I turned back and returned by entering through the Valley Gate . Let ’ s rebuild
CEB	Nehemiah	2	16	The officials didn ’ t know where I had gone or what I was doing . I hadn ’ t yet told the Jews , the priests , the officials , the officers , or the rest who were to do the work .
CEB	Nehemiah	2	17	So I said to them , “ You see the trouble that we ’ re in : Jerusalem is in ruins , and its gates are destroyed by fire ! Come , let ’ s rebuild the wall of Jerusalem so that we won ’ t continue to be in disgrace. ”
CEB	Nehemiah	2	18	I told them that my God had taken care of me , and also told them what the king had said to me . “ Let ’ s start rebuilding ! ” they said , and they eagerly began the work . [ c ]
CEB	Nehemiah	2	19	But when Sanballat the Horonite , Tobiah the Ammonite official , and Geshem the Arab heard about it , they mocked and made fun of us . “ What are you doing ? ” they asked . “ Are you rebelling against the king ? ”
CEB	Nehemiah	2	20	“ The God of heaven will give us success ! ” I replied . “ As God ’ s servants , we will start building . But you will have no share , right , or claim in Jerusalem. ” Footnotes - Nehemiah 2:1 March–April - Nehemiah 2:9 Heb lacks of the province . - Nehemiah 2:18 Or they strengthened their hands for the good .

CEB	Nehemiah	4	4	Listen , God ; we are despised ! Turn their insults to us [ b ] back on their heads and make them like plunder in a captive land .
CEB	Nehemiah	4	2	saying in the presence of his associates and the army of Samaria : “ What are those feeble Jews doing ? Will they restore things themselves ? Will they offer sacrifices ? Will they finish it in a day ? Will they revive the stones from the piles of rubble , even though they are burned ? ”
CEB	Nehemiah	4	3	Tobiah the Ammonite , who was beside him , added : “ If even a fox climbs on whatever they build , their wall of stones will crumble. ”
CEB	Nehemiah	4	5	Don ’ t forgive their iniquity or blot out their sins from your sight . They have thrown insults at the builders !
CEB	Nehemiah	4	6	We continued to build the wall . All of it was joined together , and it reached half of its intended height because the people were eager to work .
CEB	Nehemiah	4	7	[ c ] But when Sanballat , Tobiah , the Arabs , the Ammonites , and the people of Ashdod heard that the work on the walls was progressing and the gaps were being closed , they were very angry .
CEB	Nehemiah	4	8	They plotted together to come and fight against Jerusalem and to create a disturbance in it .
CEB	Nehemiah	4	9	So we prayed to our God and set a guard as protection against them day and night .
CEB	Nehemiah	4	10	But in Judah it was said , “ The carrier ’ s strength is failing , for there is too much rubble . We are unable to rebuild the wall ! ”
CEB	Nehemiah	4	11	Meanwhile , our enemies were saying : “ Before they know or see anything , we can be in their midst and start to kill them . We ’ ll stop the work ! ”
CEB	Nehemiah	4	12	Now the Jews who were living near them came and said to us again and again , [ d ] “ You must return to us ! ” [ e ] Armed guards protect the builders
CEB	Nehemiah	4	13	So I took up a position in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall in an open area . [ f ] Then I stationed the people by families , and they had their swords , spears , and bows .
CEB	Nehemiah	4	14	After reviewing this , I stood up and said to the officials , the officers , and the rest of the people , “ Don ’ t be afraid of them ! Remember that the Lord is great and awesome ! Fight for your families , your sons , your daughters , your wives , and your houses ! ”
CEB	Nehemiah	4	15	Then our enemies heard that we had found out and that God had spoiled their plans . So we all returned to doing our own work on the wall .
CEB	Nehemiah	4	16	But from that day on , only half of my workers continued in the construction , while the other half held the spears , shields , bows , and body armor . Meanwhile , the leaders positioned themselves [ g ] behind the whole house of Judah ,
CEB	Nehemiah	4	17	who were building the wall . The carriers did their work with a load in one hand and a weapon in the other .
CEB	Nehemiah	4	18	The builders built with swords fastened in their belts , and the trumpeter stayed by my side .
CEB	Nehemiah	4	19	Then I said to the officials , the officers , and the rest of the people , “ The work is very spread out , and we are far apart from each other along the wall .
CEB	Nehemiah	4	20	When you hear the trumpet sound , come and gather where we are . Our God will fight for us ! ”
CEB	Nehemiah	4	21	So we continued the work , with half of them holding spears from dawn until dusk .
CEB	Nehemiah	4	22	I also said to the people at that time , “ Let every man and his servant spend the night in Jerusalem so that we can guard during the night and work during the day. ”
CEB	Nehemiah	4	23	Neither I nor my relatives , nor my servants , nor my bodyguards took off our clothes , even when they sent for water .

CEB	Nehemiah	5	5	“ We are of the same flesh and blood as our kin , and our children are the same as theirs . Yet we are just about to force our sons and daughters into slavery , and some of our daughters are already slaves ! There is nothing we can do since our fields and vineyards now belong to others. ”
CEB	Nehemiah	5	2	Some said , “ With our sons and daughters we are many , and we all need grain to eat and stay alive. ”
CEB	Nehemiah	5	3	Others said , “ We have to mortgage our fields , our vineyards , and our houses in order to get grain during the famine. ”
CEB	Nehemiah	5	4	Still others said , “ We have had to borrow money against our fields and vineyards in order to pay the king ’ s tax. ”
CEB	Nehemiah	5	6	I was very angry when I heard their protest and these complaints .
CEB	Nehemiah	5	7	After thinking it over , I brought charges against the officials and the officers . I told them , “ You are all taking interest from your own people ! ” I also called for a large assembly in order to deal with them .
CEB	Nehemiah	5	8	“ To the best of our ability , ” I said to them , “ we have bought back our Jewish kin who had been sold to other nations . But now you are selling your own kin , who must then be bought back by us ! ” At this they were silent , unable to offer a response .
CEB	Nehemiah	5	9	So I continued , “ What you are doing isn ’ t good ! Why don ’ t you walk in the fear of our God ? This will prevent the taunts of the nations that are our enemies !
CEB	Nehemiah	5	10	I myself , along with my family and my servants , am lending them money and grain . But let ’ s stop charging this interest !
CEB	Nehemiah	5	11	Give it back to them , right now . Return their fields , their vineyards , their olive orchards , and their houses . And give back the interest on money , grain , wine , and oil that you are charging them. ”
CEB	Nehemiah	5	12	They replied , “ We ’ ll return everything , and we won ’ t charge anything else . [ a ] We ’ ll do what you ’ ve asked. ” So I called the priests and made them swear to do what they had promised .
CEB	Nehemiah	5	13	I also shook out the fold of my robe , saying , “ So may God shake out everyone from their house and property if they don ’ t keep this promise . So may they be shaken out and emptied ! ” The whole assembly said , “ Amen , ” and praised the Lord . And the people did as they had promised . Generous Governor Nehemiah
CEB	Nehemiah	5	14	In addition , from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah ( that is , from the twentieth to the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes for a total of twelve years ) , neither I nor my family ate from the governor ’ s food allowance .
CEB	Nehemiah	5	15	The earlier governors who had come before me laid heavy burdens on the people . They took food and wine from them as well as [ b ] forty shekels of silver . Even their servants oppressed the people . But because I was God-fearing , I didn ’ t behave in this way .
CEB	Nehemiah	5	16	Instead , I devoted myself to the work on this wall . We acquired no land , and all my servants were gathered there for the work .
CEB	Nehemiah	5	17	One hundred fifty Jews and officials , along with those who came to us from the surrounding nations , gathered around my table .
CEB	Nehemiah	5	18	One ox , six choice sheep , and birds were prepared each day . Every ten days there was a large amount of wine . Yet even with this I didn ’ t ask for the governor ’ s food allowance because of the heavy burden the people had to carry .
CEB	Nehemiah	5	19	Remember in my favor , my God , all that I ’ ve done for this people ! Footnotes - Nehemiah 5:12 Heb lacks everything…anything else . - Nehemiah 5:15 Heb uncertain
CEB	Nehemiah	6	6	It stated : It is reported among the nations and confirmed by Geshem [ b ] that you and the Jews intend to rebel . This is why you are rebuilding the wall . According to these reports , you intend to become their king .
CEB	Nehemiah	6	2	Sanballat and Geshem sent me this message : “ Come , let ’ s meet together in one of the villages [ a ] in the plain of Ono. ” But they wanted to harm me ,
CEB	Nehemiah	6	3	so I sent messengers to tell them , “ I ’ m doing important work , so I can ’ t come down . Why should the work stop while I leave it to come down to you ? ”
CEB	Nehemiah	6	4	They sent me a message like this four times , and every time I gave them a similar reply .
CEB	Nehemiah	6	5	But the fifth time , Sanballat sent his servant to me in the same way , except that now he carried an open letter .
CEB	Nehemiah	6	7	You have also appointed prophets to make this announcement about you in Jerusalem : There is a king in Judah ! Now , the king will hear of these reports , so come ; let ’ s talk together .
CEB	Nehemiah	6	8	So I sent him this reply : “ Nothing that you say has happened . You are simply inventing this. ”
CEB	Nehemiah	6	9	All of them were trying to make us afraid , saying , “ They will be discouraged , and the work won ’ t get finished. ” But now , God , strengthen me !
CEB	Nehemiah	6	10	Later I went to see Shemaiah , Delaiah ’ s son and Mehetabel ’ s grandson , who was confined to his house , and he said : “ Let ’ s meet together in God ’ s house , inside the temple itself . Let ’ s shut the doors of the temple , for they are coming to kill you ; they are coming to kill you tonight ! ”
CEB	Nehemiah	6	11	But I replied , “ Should someone like me run away ? Who like me would go into the temple to save his life ? I won ’ t go in ! ”
CEB	Nehemiah	6	12	Then I realized that God hadn ’ t sent him at all but that he spoke this prophecy against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him .
CEB	Nehemiah	6	13	He was hired to frighten me and to make me sin by acting in this way . Then they could give me a bad name and discredit me .

CEB	Nehemiah	9	6	You alone are the Lord . You alone made heaven , even the heaven of heavens , with all their forces . You made the earth and all that is on it , and the seas and all that is in them . You preserve them all , and the heavenly forces worship you .
CEB	Nehemiah	9	7	Lord God , you are the one who chose Abram . You brought him out of Ur of the Chaldeans and gave him the name Abraham .
CEB	Nehemiah	9	8	You found him to be faithful before you , and you made a covenant with him . You promised to give to his descendants the land of the Canaanites , the Hittites , the Amorites , the Perizzites , the Jebusites , and the Girgashites . And you have kept your promise because you are righteous .
CEB	Nehemiah	9	10	You performed signs and wonders against Pharaoh , all his servants , and the people of his land . You knew that they had acted arrogantly against our ancestors . You made a name for yourself , a name that is famous even today .
CEB	Nehemiah	9	11	You divided the sea before them so that they went through it on dry land . But you cast their pursuers into the depths , as a stone into the mighty waters .
CEB	Nehemiah	9	12	With a pillar of cloud you led them by day and with a column of lightning by night ; they lit the way in which the people should go .
CEB	Nehemiah	9	13	You came down upon Mount Sinai and spoke with them from heaven . You gave them proper judgments and true Instruction , good statutes and commandments .
CEB	Nehemiah	9	14	You made known to them your holy Sabbath , and gave them commandments , statutes , and Instruction through your servant Moses .
CEB	Nehemiah	9	15	When they were hungry , you gave them bread from heaven ; when they were thirsty , you brought water out of the rock for them . You told them to go in to possess the land that you had sworn to give them .
CEB	Nehemiah	9	16	But our ancestors acted arrogantly . They were stubborn and wouldn ’ t obey your commandments .
CEB	Nehemiah	9	17	They refused to obey , and didn ’ t remember the wonders that you accomplished in their midst . They acted arrogantly and decided to return to their slavery in Egypt . But you are a God ready to forgive , merciful and compassionate , very patient , and truly faithful . You didn ’ t forsake them .
CEB	Nehemiah	9	18	Even when they had cast an image of a calf for themselves , saying , “ This is your God who brought you up out of Egypt , ” and holding you in great contempt ,
CEB	Nehemiah	9	19	you , in your great mercy , didn ’ t abandon them in the wilderness . The column of cloud continued to guide them on their journey during the day , and the column of lightning lit their path during the night .
CEB	Nehemiah	9	20	You gave your good spirit to teach them . You didn ’ t withhold your manna from them , and you gave them water for their thirst .
CEB	Nehemiah	9	21	You kept them alive for forty years— they lacked nothing in the wilderness ! Their clothes didn ’ t wear out , and their feet didn ’ t swell .
CEB	Nehemiah	9	22	You gave them kingdoms and peoples , and assigned to them every side . [ d ] They took possession of the land of King Sihon of Heshbon and the land of King Og of Bashan .
CEB	Nehemiah	9	23	You multiplied their descendants as the stars of heaven . You brought them into the land that you had told their ancestors to enter and possess .
CEB	Nehemiah	9	24	So the descendants went in and possessed the land . Before them , you subdued the Canaanites who inhabited the land . You also handed over to them their kings and the neighboring peoples , to do with as they wished .
CEB	Nehemiah	9	25	They captured fortified cities and productive land , and took possession of houses filled with all kinds of good things , excavated cisterns , vineyards , olive orchards , and a great many fruit trees . They ate until they were satisfied and grew fat , and delighted themselves in your great goodness .
CEB	Nehemiah	9	26	But they were disobedient , rebelled against you , and turned their back on your Instruction . They killed your prophets who had warned them so that they might return to you . They held you in great contempt .
CEB	Nehemiah	9	27	Therefore , you handed them over to the power of their enemies who made them suffer . But when they cried out to you in their suffering , you heard them from heaven . Because you are merciful , you gave them saviors who saved them from the power of their enemies .
CEB	Nehemiah	9	28	But after they had rest from this , they again started doing evil against you . So you gave them over to the power of their enemies who ruled over them . Yet when they turned and cried to you , you heard from heaven and rescued them many times because of your great mercy .
CEB	Nehemiah	9	29	You also warned them to return to your Instruction , but they acted arrogantly and didn ’ t obey your commands . They sinned against your judgments , even though life comes by keeping them . [ e ] They turned a stubborn shoulder , became headstrong , and wouldn ’ t obey .
CEB	Nehemiah	9	30	You were patient with them for many years and warned them by your spirit through the prophets . But they wouldn ’ t listen , so you handed them over to the neighboring peoples .
CEB	Nehemiah	9	31	In your great mercy , however , you didn ’ t make an end of them . Neither did you forsake them , because you are a merciful and compassionate God .
CEB	Nehemiah	9	32	Now , our God , great and mighty and awesome God , you are the one who faithfully keeps the covenant . Don ’ t treat lightly all of the hardship that has come upon us , upon our kings , our officials , our priests , our prophets , our ancestors , and all your people , from the time of the kings of Assyria until today .
CEB	Nehemiah	9	33	You have been just in all that has happened to us ; you have acted faithfully , and we have done wrong .
CEB	Nehemiah	9	34	Our kings , our officials , our priests , and our ancestors haven ’ t kept your Instruction . They haven ’ t heeded your commandments and the warnings that you gave them .
CEB	Nehemiah	9	35	Even in their own kingdom , surrounded by the great goodness that you gave to them , even in the wide and rich land that you gave them , they didn ’ t serve you or turn from their wicked works .
CEB	Nehemiah	9	36	So now today we are slaves , slaves in the land that you gave to our ancestors to enjoy its fruit and its good gifts .
CEB	Nehemiah	9	37	Its produce profits the kings whom you have placed over us because of our sins . They have power over our bodies and do as they please with our livestock . We are in great distress . Commitment to follow the Instruction

CEB	Nehemiah	12	27	When it was time for the dedication of Jerusalem ’ s wall , they sought out the Levites in all the places where they lived in order to bring them to Jerusalem to celebrate the dedication with joy , with thanks and singing , and with cymbals , harps , and lyres .
CEB	Nehemiah	12	28	The singers also gathered together both from the region around Jerusalem and from the villages of the Netophathites ,
CEB	Nehemiah	12	29	also from Beth-hagilgal and from the region of Geba and Azmaveth , because the singers had built themselves villages around Jerusalem .
CEB	Nehemiah	12	30	After the priests and the Levites purified themselves , they purified the people , the gates , and the wall .
CEB	Nehemiah	12	31	Then I [ d ] brought the leaders of Judah up onto the wall and organized two large groups to give thanks . The first group went in procession on the wall toward the right , in the direction of the Dung Gate .
CEB	Nehemiah	12	32	Following them went Hoshaiah and half the officials of Judah ,
CEB	Nehemiah	12	33	along with Azariah , Ezra , Meshullam ,
CEB	Nehemiah	12	34	Judah , Benjamin , Shemaiah , and Jeremiah .

CEB	Nehemiah	12	37	When they reached the Fountain Gate they went straight up by the stairs of David ’ s City , on the ascent to the wall , past the house of David to the Water Gate on the east .
CEB	Nehemiah	12	38	The second group went in procession to the left . [ f ] I followed them with half of the people along the wall past the Tower of the Ovens to the Broad Wall ,
CEB	Nehemiah	12	39	past the Gate of Ephraim and over the Mishneh Gate , [ g ] the Fish Gate , the Tower of Hananel , and the Tower of the Hundred as far as the Sheep Gate . They came to a stop at the Gate of the Guard . In God ’ s house
CEB	Nehemiah	12	40	Then both groups of those who gave thanks stood in God ’ s house . I was there too along with the half of the officials who were with me .
CEB	Nehemiah	12	41	Also there were the priests Eliakim , Maaseiah , Miniamin , Micaiah , Elioenai , Zechariah , and Hananiah with trumpets .
CEB	Nehemiah	12	42	Also there were Maaseiah , Shemaiah , Eleazar , Uzzi , Jehohanan , Malchijah , Elam , and Ezer . The singers sang with Jezrahiah as their leader .
CEB	Nehemiah	12	43	They offered great sacrifices on that day and rejoiced , for God had made them rejoice with great joy . The women and children also rejoiced , and the sound of the joy in Jerusalem could be heard from far away .
CEB	Nehemiah	12	44	On that day , people were appointed over the rooms for the things to be stored , the contributions , the early produce , and the tenth-part gifts . They were to gather into them the portions required by the Instruction for the priests and for the Levites from the fields belonging to the towns , for the people of Judah were delighted with the ministry of the priests and the Levites .
CEB	Nehemiah	12	45	They performed the service of their God and the service of purification , as did the singers and the gatekeepers , according to the command of David and his son Solomon .
CEB	Nehemiah	12	46	Long ago , in the days of David and Asaph , there was a leader of the singers , and there were songs of praise and thanks to God .
CEB	Nehemiah	12	47	In the days of Zerubbabel and of Nehemiah all Israel gave the daily portions for the singers and the gatekeepers . They also set aside the portion for the Levites , and the Levites set aside the portion for the Aaronites .

CEB	Nehemiah	13	13	I appointed the priest Shelemiah , the scribe Zadok , and Pedaiah of the Levites to be in charge over the storehouses . I also appointed Hanan , Zaccur ’ s son and Mattaniah ’ s grandson , as their assistant . These men were considered trustworthy , and their task was to hand out shares to their colleagues .
CEB	Nehemiah	13	2	This is because they hadn ’ t met the Israelites with food and water but instead hired Balaam against them to curse them . Yet our God turned the curse into a blessing .
CEB	Nehemiah	13	3	When the people heard this law , they separated out from Israel all those of mixed descent .
CEB	Nehemiah	13	4	Now before this , however , Eliashib the priest , who was appointed to be in charge of the storerooms of our God ’ s house and who was related to Tobiah ,
CEB	Nehemiah	13	5	prepared a large room for Tobiah to use . This was the room where they had previously kept the grain offering , the incense , and the equipment , together with the tenth-part gifts of grain , wine , and oil . These items were for the Levites , singers , and gatekeepers as well as the portions for the priests .
CEB	Nehemiah	13	6	I wasn ’ t in Jerusalem while this was happening because I had gone to Babylon ’ s King Artaxerxes in the thirty-second year of the king . After some time , I asked the king ’ s permission
CEB	Nehemiah	13	7	and returned to Jerusalem . That was when I saw the wrong that Eliashib had done on behalf of Tobiah by preparing him a room in the courtyards of God ’ s house .
CEB	Nehemiah	13	8	I was very angry and threw all of Tobiah ’ s household furniture out of the room .
CEB	Nehemiah	13	9	Then I gave orders that the rooms be purified , and I put back the temple equipment , along with the grain offering and the incense .
CEB	Nehemiah	13	10	I also found out that the Levites hadn ’ t been given their portions , so they and the singers who did the work had gone back to their fields .
CEB	Nehemiah	13	11	So I scolded the officials , asking , “ Why is God ’ s house being neglected ? ” I gathered them together and set them in their stations .
CEB	Nehemiah	13	12	Then all Judah brought the tenth-part gifts of the grain , wine , and oil into the storehouses .
CEB	Nehemiah	13	14	Remember me , my God , concerning this . Don ’ t erase my good deeds that I have done for my God ’ s house and for its services . Keeping the Sabbath
CEB	Nehemiah	13	15	In those days I saw people in Judah using the winepresses on the Sabbath . They were also collecting piles of grain and loading them on donkeys , as well as wine , grapes , figs , and every kind of load , and then bringing them to Jerusalem on the Sabbath . I warned them at that time against selling food .
CEB	Nehemiah	13	16	In addition , people from Tyre who lived in the city were bringing in fish and all kinds of merchandise and selling them to the people of Judah on the Sabbath . This happened in Jerusalem itself !
CEB	Nehemiah	13	17	So I scolded the officials of Judah : “ What is this evil thing that you are doing ? ” I asked . “ You are making the Sabbath impure !
CEB	Nehemiah	13	18	This is just what your ancestors did , and God brought all this evil upon us and upon this city . And now you are bringing more wrath upon Israel by making the Sabbath impure ! ”
CEB	Nehemiah	13	19	So when it began to grow dark at the gates of Jerusalem before the Sabbath , I gave orders that the doors should be shut . I also ordered that they shouldn ’ t be reopened until after the Sabbath . To make sure that no load would come into the city [ a ] on the Sabbath , I stationed some of my own men at the gates .
CEB	Nehemiah	13	20	Once or twice the traders and sellers of all kinds of merchandise spent the night outside Jerusalem .
CEB	Nehemiah	13	21	But I warned them : “ Why are you spending the night by the wall ? If you do that again , I will lay hands on you ! ” At that point , they stopped coming on the Sabbath .
CEB	Nehemiah	13	22	I also commanded the Levites to purify themselves and to come and guard the gates in order to keep the Sabbath day holy . Remember this also in my favor , my God , and spare me according to the greatness of your mercy . Marrying foreign women
CEB	Nehemiah	13	23	Also in those days I saw Jews who had married women of Ashdod , Ammon , and Moab .
CEB	Nehemiah	13	24	Half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod or the language of various peoples ; they couldn ’ t speak the language of Judah .
CEB	Nehemiah	13	25	So I scolded them and cursed them , and beat some of them , and pulled out their hair . I also made them swear a solemn pledge in the name of God , saying , “ You won ’ t give your daughters to their sons in marriage , or take their daughters in marriage for your sons or yourselves .
CEB	Nehemiah	13	26	Didn ’ t Israel ’ s King Solomon sin on account of such women ? Among the many nations there was no king like him . He was well loved by his God , and God made him king over all Israel . Yet foreign wives led even him into sin !
CEB	Nehemiah	13	27	Should we then listen to you and do all this great evil , acting unfaithfully toward our God by marrying foreign women ? ”
CEB	Nehemiah	13	28	Now one of the sons of Joiada son of the high priest Eliashib was a son-in-law of Sanballat the Horonite . So I chased him away from me .
CEB	Nehemiah	13	29	Remember them , my God , because they have defiled the priesthood and the covenant of the priests and the Levites !
CEB	Nehemiah	13	30	So I purified them of everything foreign and established the services of the priests and Levites with specific duties for each person .
CEB	Nehemiah	13	31	I also provided for the wood offering at appointed times as well as for the early produce . Remember me , my God , for good . Footnotes - Nehemiah 13:19 Heb lacks the city .
CEB	Esther	1	1	This is what happened back when Ahasuerus lived , the very Ahasuerus who ruled from India to Cush—one hundred twenty-seven provinces in all .
CEB	Esther	1	2	At that time , Ahasuerus ruled the kingdom from his royal throne in the fortified part of Susa .
CEB	Esther	1	3	In the third year of his rule he hosted a feast for all his officials and courtiers . The leaders of Persia and Media attended , along with his provincial officials and officers .
CEB	Esther	1	4	He showed off the awesome riches of his kingdom and beautiful treasures as mirrors of how very great he was . The event lasted a long time—six whole months , to be exact !
CEB	Esther	1	5	After that the king held a seven-day feast for everyone in the fortified part of Susa . Whether they were important people in the town or not , they all met in the walled garden of the royal palace .
CEB	Esther	1	6	White linen curtains and purple hangings were held up by shining white and red-purple ropes tied to silver rings and marble posts . Gold and silver couches sat on a mosaic floor made of gleaming purple crystal , marble , and mother-of-pearl .
CEB	Esther	1	7	They served the drinks in cups made of gold , and each cup was different . The king made sure there was plenty of royal wine .
CEB	Esther	1	8	The rule about the drinks was “ No limits ! ” The king had ordered everyone serving wine in the palace to offer as much as each guest wanted .
CEB	Esther	1	9	At the same time , Queen Vashti held a feast for women in King Ahasuerus ’ palace .
CEB	Esther	1	10	On the seventh day , when wine had put the king in high spirits , he gave an order to Mehuman , Biztha , Harbona , Bigtha , Abagtha , Zethar , and Carcas , the seven eunuchs who served King Ahasuerus personally .
CEB	Esther	1	11	They were to bring Queen Vashti before him wearing the royal crown . She was gorgeous , and he wanted to show off her beauty both to the general public and to his important guests .
CEB	Esther	1	12	But Queen Vashti refused to come as the king had ordered through the eunuchs . The king was furious , his anger boiling inside .
CEB	Esther	1	13	Now , when a need arose , the king would often talk with certain very smart people about the best way to handle it . They were people who knew both the kingdom ’ s written laws and what judges had decided about cases in the past .
CEB	Esther	1	14	The ones he talked with most often were Carshena , Shethar , Admatha , Tarshish , Meres , Marsena , and Memucan . They were seven very important people in Persia and Media who , as the kingdom ’ s highest leaders , were in the king ’ s inner circle . So the king said to them ,
CEB	Esther	1	15	“ According to the law , what should I do with Queen Vashti since she didn ’ t do what King Ahasuerus ordered her through the eunuchs ? ”
CEB	Esther	1	16	Then Memucan spoke up in front of the king and the officials . “ Queen Vashti , ” he said , “ has done something wrong not just to the king himself . She has also done wrong to all the officials and the peoples in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus .
CEB	Esther	1	17	This is the reason : News of what the queen did will reach all women , making them look down on their husbands . They will say , ‘ King Ahasuerus ordered servants to bring Queen Vashti before him , but she refused to come. ’
CEB	Esther	1	18	This very day , the important women of Persia and Media who hear about the queen will tell the royal officials the same thing . There will be no end of put-downs and arguments .
CEB	Esther	1	19	Now , if the king wishes , let him send out a royal order and have it written into the laws of Persia and Media , laws no one can ever change . It should say that Vashti will never again come before King Ahasuerus . It should also say that the king will give her royal place to someone better than she .
CEB	Esther	1	20	When the order becomes public through the whole empire , vast as it is , all women will treat their husbands properly . The rule should touch everyone , whether from an important family or not. ”
CEB	Esther	1	21	The king liked the plan , as did the other men , and he did just what Memucan said .
CEB	Esther	1	22	He sent written orders to all the king ’ s provinces . Each province received it written in its own alphabet and each people received it in its own language . It said that each husband should rule over his own house .
CEB	Esther	2	2	So his young male servants said , “ Let the king have a search made for beautiful young women who haven ’ t yet married .
CEB	Esther	2	3	And let the king choose certain people in all the royal provinces to lead the search . Have them bring all the beautiful young women together to the fortified part of Susa , to the women ’ s house , to the care of Hegai the king ’ s eunuch in charge of the women so that he might provide beauty treatments for them .
CEB	Esther	2	4	Let the young woman who pleases you the most take Vashti ’ s place as queen. ” The king liked the plan and implemented it .
CEB	Esther	2	5	Now there was a Jew in the fortified part of Susa whose name was Mordecai , Jair ’ s son . He came from the family line of Shimei and Kish ; he was a Benjaminite . (
CEB	Esther	2	6	Benjaminites had been taken into exile away from Jerusalem along with the group , which included Judah ’ s King Jeconiah , whom Babylon ’ s King Nebuchadnezzar exiled to Babylon . )
CEB	Esther	2	7	Mordecai had been a father to Hadassah ( that is , Esther ) , though she was really his cousin , because she had neither father nor mother . The girl had a beautiful figure and was lovely to look at . When her parents died , Mordecai had taken her to be his daughter .
CEB	Esther	2	8	When the king ’ s order and his new law became public , many young women were gathered into the fortified part of Susa under the care of Hegai . Esther was also taken to the palace to the care of Hegai , the one in charge of the women .
CEB	Esther	2	9	The young woman pleased him and won his kindness . He quickly began her beauty treatments and gave her carefully chosen foods . He also gave her seven servants selected from among the palace servants and moved her and her servants into the nicest rooms in the women ’ s house . (
CEB	Esther	2	10	Esther hadn ’ t told anyone her race and family background because Mordecai had ordered her not to . )
CEB	Esther	2	11	Each day found Mordecai pacing back and forth along the wall in front of the women ’ s house to learn how Esther was doing and what they were doing with her .
CEB	Esther	2	12	According to the rules for women , the moment for each young woman to go to King Ahasuerus came at the end of twelve months . ( She had six months of treatment with pleasant-smelling creams and six months with fragrant oils and other treatments for women . )
CEB	Esther	2	13	So this is how the young woman would go to the king : They gave her anything that she asked to take with her from the women ’ s house to the palace .
CEB	Esther	2	14	In the evening she would go in , and the next morning she would return to the second women ’ s house under the care of Shaashgaz . He was the king ’ s eunuch in charge of the secondary wives . She would never go to the king again unless he was so pleased that he called for her by name .
CEB	Esther	2	15	Soon the moment came for Esther daughter of Mordecai ’ s uncle Abihail , whom Mordecai had taken as his own daughter , to go to the king . But she asked for nothing except what Hegai the king ’ s eunuch in charge of the women told her . ( Esther kept winning the favor of everyone who saw her . )
CEB	Esther	2	16	Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus , to his own palace , in the tenth month ( that is , the month of Tevet ) [ a ] in the seventh year of his rule .
CEB	Esther	2	17	The king loved Esther more than all the other women ; she had won his love and his favor more than all the others . He placed the royal crown on her head and made her ruler in place of Vashti .
CEB	Esther	2	18	The king held a magnificent , lavish feast , “ the feast of Esther , ” for all his officials and courtiers . He declared a public holiday [ b ] for the provinces and gave out gifts with royal generosity .
CEB	Esther	2	19	When they gathered the young women to the second women ’ s house , [ c ] Mordecai was working for the king at the King ’ s Gate .
CEB	Esther	2	20	Esther still wasn ’ t telling anyone her family background and race , just as Mordecai had ordered her . She continued to do what Mordecai said , just as she did when she was in his care . Mordecai saves the king
CEB	Esther	2	21	At that time , as Mordecai continued to work at the King ’ s Gate , two royal eunuchs , Bigthan and Teresh , became angry with King Ahasuerus . They were among the guards protecting the doorway to the king , but they secretly planned to kill him .
CEB	Esther	2	22	When Mordecai got wind of it , he reported it to Queen Esther . She spoke to the king about it , saying the information came from Mordecai .
CEB	Esther	2	23	The matter was investigated and found to be true , so the two men were impaled on pointed poles . [ d ] A report about the event was written in the royal record with the king present . Footnotes - Esther 2:16 December–January - Esther 2:18 Or remission of taxes - Esther 2:19 Or to the women ’ s house a second time - Esther 2:23 Or hanged the two men on gallows
CEB	Esther	3	3	So the royal workers at the King ’ s Gate said to Mordecai , “ Why don ’ t you obey the king ’ s order ? ”
CEB	Esther	3	2	All the royal workers at the King ’ s Gate would kneel and bow facedown to Haman because the king had so ordered . But Mordecai didn ’ t kneel or bow down .
CEB	Esther	3	4	Day after day they questioned him , but he paid no attention to them . So they let Haman know about it just to see whether or not Mordecai ’ s words would hold true . [ b ] ( He had told them that he was a Jew . )
CEB	Esther	3	5	When Haman himself saw that Mordecai didn ’ t kneel or bow down to him , he became very angry .
CEB	Esther	3	6	But he decided not to kill only Mordecai , for people had told him Mordecai ’ s race . Instead , he planned to wipe out all the Jews , Mordecai ’ s people , throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus .
CEB	Esther	3	7	In the first month ( that is , the month of Nisan ) [ c ] in the twelfth year of the rule of King Ahasuerus , servants threw pur , namely , dice , in front of Haman to find the best day for his plan . They tried every day and every month , and the dice chose the thirteenth [ d ] day of the twelfth month ( that is , the month of Adar ) .
CEB	Esther	3	8	Then Haman said to King Ahasuerus , “ A certain group of people exist in pockets among the other peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom . Their laws are different from those of everyone else , and they refuse to obey the king ’ s laws . There ’ s no good reason for the king to put up with them any longer .
CEB	Esther	3	9	If the king wishes , let a written order be sent out to destroy them , and I will hand over ten thousand kikkars of silver [ e ] to those in charge of the king ’ s business . The silver can go into the king ’ s treasuries. ”
CEB	Esther	3	10	The king removed his royal ring from his finger and handed it to Haman , Hammedatha the Agagite ’ s son , enemy of the Jews .
CEB	Esther	3	11	The king said to Haman , “ Both the money and the people are under your power . Do as you like with them. ”
CEB	Esther	3	12	So in the first month , on the thirteenth day , royal scribes were summoned to write down everything that Haman ordered . The orders were for the king ’ s rulers and the governors in charge of each province , as well as for the officials of each people . They wrote in the alphabet of each province and in the language of each people . They wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed the order with the king ’ s royal ring .
CEB	Esther	3	13	Fast runners were to take the order to all the provinces of the king . The order commanded people to wipe out , kill , and destroy all the Jews , both young and old , even women and little children . This was to happen on a single day—the thirteenth day of the twelfth month ( that is , the month of Adar ) . [ f ] They were also to seize their property .
CEB	Esther	3	14	A copy of the order was to become law in each province and to be posted in public for all peoples to read . The people were to be ready for this day to do as the order commanded .
CEB	Esther	3	15	Driven by the king ’ s order , the runners left Susa just as the law became public in the fortified part of Susa . While the king and Haman sat down to have a drink , the city of Susa was in total shock .

CEB	Esther	4	4	When Esther ’ s female servants and eunuchs came and told her about Mordecai , the queen ’ s whole body showed how upset she was . She sent everyday clothes for Mordecai to wear instead of mourning clothes , but he rejected them .
CEB	Esther	4	2	He went only as far as the King ’ s Gate because it was against the law for anyone to pass through it wearing mourning clothes .
CEB	Esther	4	3	At the same time , in every province and place where the king ’ s order and his new law arrived , a very great sadness came over the Jews . They gave up eating and spent whole days weeping and crying out loudly in pain . Many Jews lay on the ground in mourning clothes and ashes .
CEB	Esther	4	5	Esther then sent for Hathach , one of the royal eunuchs whose job it was to wait on her . She ordered him to go to Mordecai and find out what was going on and why he was acting this way .
CEB	Esther	4	6	Hathach went out to Mordecai , to the city square in front of the King ’ s Gate .
CEB	Esther	4	7	Mordecai told him everything that had happened to him . He spelled out the exact amount of silver that Haman promised to pay into the royal treasury . It was in exchange for the destruction of the Jews .
CEB	Esther	4	8	He also gave Hathach a copy of the law made public in Susa concerning the Jews ’ destruction so that Hathach could show it to Esther and report it to her . Through him Mordecai ordered her to go to the king to seek his kindness and his help for her people .
CEB	Esther	4	9	Hathach came back and told Esther what Mordecai had said .
CEB	Esther	4	10	In reply Esther ordered Hathach to tell Mordecai :
CEB	Esther	4	11	“ All the king ’ s officials and the people in his provinces know that there ’ s a single law in a case like this . Any man or woman who comes to the king in the inner courtyard without being called is to be put to death . Only the person to whom the king holds out the gold scepter may live . In my case , I haven ’ t been called to come to the king for the past thirty days. ”
CEB	Esther	4	12	When they told Mordecai Esther ’ s words ,
CEB	Esther	4	13	he had them respond to Esther : “ Don ’ t think for one minute that , unlike all the other Jews , you ’ ll come out of this alive simply because you are in the palace .
CEB	Esther	4	14	In fact , if you don ’ t speak up at this very important time , relief and rescue will appear for the Jews from another place , but you and your family will die . But who knows ? Maybe it was for a moment like this that you came to be part of the royal family. ”
CEB	Esther	4	15	Esther sent back this word to Mordecai :
CEB	Esther	4	16	“ Go , gather all the Jews who are in Susa and tell them to give up eating to help me be brave . They aren ’ t to eat or drink anything for three whole days , and I myself will do the same , along with my female servants . Then , even though it ’ s against the law , I will go to the king ; and if I am to die , then die I will. ”
CEB	Esther	4	17	So Mordecai left where he was and did exactly what Esther had ordered him .
CEB	Esther	5	5	“ Hurry , get Haman , ” the king ordered , “ so we can do what Esther says. ” So the king and Haman came to the feast that Esther had prepared .
CEB	Esther	5	2	When the king noticed Queen Esther standing in the entry court , he was pleased . The king held out to Esther the gold scepter in his hand , and she came forward and touched the scepter ’ s tip .
CEB	Esther	5	3	Then the king said to her , “ What is it , Queen Esther ? What do you want ? I ’ ll give you anything—even half the kingdom. ”
CEB	Esther	5	4	Esther answered , “ If the king wishes , please come today with Haman for the feast that I have prepared for him. ”
CEB	Esther	5	6	As they sipped wine , the king asked , “ Now what is it you wish ? I ’ ll give it to you . What do you want ? I ’ ll do anything—even give you half the kingdom. ”
CEB	Esther	5	7	Esther answered , “ This is my wish and this is what I want :
CEB	Esther	5	8	If I please the king , and if the king wishes to grant my wish and my desire , I ’ d like the king and Haman to come to another feast that I will prepare for them . Tomorrow I will answer the king ’ s questions. ” Haman boasts , complains , and acts
CEB	Esther	5	9	That day Haman left Esther ’ s place happy , his spirits high , but then he saw Mordecai in the King ’ s Gate . Mordecai neither stood up nor seemed the least bit nervous around him , so Haman suddenly felt great rage toward Mordecai .
CEB	Esther	5	10	But Haman held himself back and went on home . He sent word that his friends and his wife Zeresh should join him there .
CEB	Esther	5	11	Haman boasted to them about his great wealth and his many sons . He told all about how the king had honored him by promoting him over the officials and high royal workers .
CEB	Esther	5	12	“ Best of all , ” Haman said , “ Queen Esther has invited no one else but me to join the king for food and drinks that she has prepared . In fact , I ’ ve been called to join the king at her place tomorrow !
CEB	Esther	5	13	But all this loses its meaning every time I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the King ’ s Gate. ”
CEB	Esther	5	14	So his wife Zeresh and all his friends told him : “ Have people prepare a pointed pole seventy-five feet high . In the morning , tell the king to have Mordecai impaled on it . Then you can go with the king to the feast in a happy mood. ” Haman liked the idea and had the pole prepared .
CEB	Esther	6	6	When Haman entered , the king asked him , “ What should be done for the man whom the king really wants to honor ? ” Haman thought to himself , Whom would the king really want to honor more than me ?
CEB	Esther	6	2	They came to the report about Mordecai informing on Bigthan and Teresh . ( They were the two royal eunuchs among the guards protecting the king ’ s doorway , who secretly planned to kill King Ahasuerus . )
CEB	Esther	6	3	“ What was done to honor and reward Mordecai for this ? ” the king asked . His young male servants replied , “ Nothing was done for him , sir. ”
CEB	Esther	6	4	“ Who is that out in the courtyard ? ” the king asked . ( Haman had just entered the outer courtyard of the palace . He had come to tell the king to impale Mordecai on the pole that he had set up for him . )
CEB	Esther	6	5	The king ’ s servants answered , “ That ’ s Haman standing out in the courtyard , sir. ” So the king said , “ Have him come in. ”
CEB	Esther	6	7	So Haman said to the king , “ Here ’ s what should be done for the man the king really wants to honor .
CEB	Esther	6	8	Have servants bring out a royal robe that the king himself has worn and a horse on which the king himself has ridden . It should have a royal crest on its head .
CEB	Esther	6	9	Then hand over the robe and the horse to another man , one of the king ’ s officials . Have him personally robe [ a ] the man whom the king really wants to honor and lead him on the horse through the city square . As he goes , have him shout , ‘ This is what the king does for the man he really wants to honor ! ’ ”
CEB	Esther	6	10	Then the king said to Haman , “ Hurry , take the robe and the horse just as you ’ ve said and do exactly that for Mordecai the Jew , who works at the King ’ s Gate . Don ’ t leave out a single thing you ’ ve said ! ”
CEB	Esther	6	11	So Haman took the robe and the horse and put the robe on Mordecai . He led him on horseback through the city square , shouting as he went , “ This is what the king does for the man he really wants to honor ! ”
CEB	Esther	6	12	Afterward , Mordecai returned to the King ’ s Gate , while Haman hurried home feeling great shame , his head covered .
CEB	Esther	6	13	Haman told his wife Zeresh and all his friends everything that had happened to him . Both his friends [ b ] and his wife said to him , “ You ’ ve already begun to lose out to Mordecai . If he is of Jewish birth , you ’ ll not be able to win against him . You are surely going to lose out to him. ” Haman ’ s demise
CEB	Esther	6	14	They were still discussing this with him when several royal eunuchs arrived . They quickly hurried Haman off to the feast that Esther had prepared . Footnotes - Esther 6:9 LXX sing robe and lead , cf Heb plural verbs - Esther 6:13 LXX ; Heb wise ones
CEB	Esther	7	7	Furious , the king got up and left the banquet for the palace garden . But Haman stood up to beg Queen Esther for his life . He saw clearly that the king ’ s mood meant a bad end for him .
CEB	Esther	7	2	the king said to her , “ This is the second day we ’ ve met for wine . What is your wish , Queen Esther ? I ’ ll give it to you . And what do you want ? I ’ ll do anything—even give you half the kingdom. ”
CEB	Esther	7	3	Queen Esther answered , “ If I please the king , and if the king wishes , give me my life—that ’ s my wish—and the lives of my people too . That ’ s my desire .
CEB	Esther	7	4	We have been sold—I and my people—to be wiped out , killed , and destroyed . If we simply had been sold as male and female slaves , I would have said nothing . But no enemy can compensate the king for this kind of damage. ”
CEB	Esther	7	5	King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther , “ Who is this person , and where is he ? Who would dare do such a thing ? ”
CEB	Esther	7	6	Esther replied , “ A man who hates , an enemy—this wicked Haman ! ” Haman was overcome with terror in the presence of the king and queen .
CEB	Esther	7	8	The king returned from the palace garden to the banquet room just as Haman was kneeling on the couch where Esther was reclining . “ Will you even molest the queen while I am in the house ? ” the king said . The words had barely left the king ’ s mouth before covering Haman ’ s face with dread . [ a ]
CEB	Esther	7	9	Harbona , one of the eunuchs serving the king , said , “ Sir , look ! There ’ s the stake that Haman made for Mordecai , the man who spoke up and did something good for the king . It ’ s standing at Haman ’ s house—seventy-five feet high. ” “ Impale him on it ! ” the king ordered .
CEB	Esther	7	10	So they impaled Haman on the very pole that he had set up for Mordecai , and the king ’ s anger went away . Footnotes - Esther 7:8 Or the face of Haman was covered .
CEB	Esther	8	8	So you yourselves write to the Jews whatever you like in the name of the king and seal the letters with the king ’ s royal ring . Anything written in the name of the king and sealed with the king ’ s royal ring can ’ t be called back. ”
CEB	Esther	8	2	The king took off his royal ring , the one he had removed from Haman , and gave it to Mordecai . Esther put Mordecai in charge of what Haman had owned .
CEB	Esther	8	3	Esther again spoke before the king . She bowed at his feet , wept , and begged him to treat her kindly . She wanted him to overturn the evil plot of Haman the Agagite—his secret plan directed against the Jews .
CEB	Esther	8	4	The king held out the gold scepter to Esther , and she got up and stood before him .
CEB	Esther	8	5	She said , “ If the king wishes , and if I please him—that is , if the idea seems right to the king , and if he still sees me as a good person—then have people write something to call back the order—the order that put into effect the plan of Haman , Hammedatha the Agagite ’ s son , that he wrote to destroy the Jews in all the royal provinces .
CEB	Esther	8	6	How can I bear to watch the terrible evil about to sweep over my people ? And how can I bear to watch others destroy my own family ? ” Mordecai writes a new law
CEB	Esther	8	7	King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew , “ Look , I ’ ve given Esther everything Haman owned . And Haman himself my servants have impaled on the pole because he planned to attack the Jews .
CEB	Esther	8	9	So that was when the royal scribes were summoned—on the twenty-third day of the third month ( that is , the month of Sivan ) . [ a ] They wrote exactly what Mordecai ordered to the Jews , rulers , governors , and officials of the provinces from India to Cush—one hundred twenty-seven in all . They wrote in the alphabet of each province and in the language of each people .
CEB	Esther	8	10	They wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed the order with the king ’ s royal ring . He sent letters with riders mounted on royal horses bred from mares known to run fast . [ b ]
CEB	Esther	8	11	The order allowed Jews in each town to join together and defend their lives . The Jews were free to wipe out , kill , and destroy every army of any people and province that attacked them , along with their women and children . They could also take and keep anything their attackers owned .
CEB	Esther	8	12	The one day in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus on which they could do so was the thirteenth day of the twelfth month ( that is , the month of Adar ) .
CEB	Esther	8	13	A copy of the writing was to become law in each province and be on public display for all its peoples to read . The Jews were to be ready on this day to get back at their enemies .
CEB	Esther	8	14	The riders mounted on royal horses left Susa , spurred on by the king ’ s order , and the law also became public in the fortified part of Susa .
CEB	Esther	8	15	Mordecai went out from the king ’ s presence in a blue and white royal robe wearing a large gold crown and a white and red-purple coat . The city of Susa greeted him with shouts of joy .
CEB	Esther	8	16	For the Jews it was a day of light , happiness , joy , and honor .
CEB	Esther	8	17	In every province and in every town—wherever the king ’ s order and his law arrived—for the Jews it was a day of happiness and joy . For them it meant feasts and a holiday . Many people in the land became Jews themselves , out of fear of the Jews . Footnotes - Esther 8:9 May–June - Esther 8:10 Heb uncertain
CEB	Esther	9	9	Parmashta , Arisai , Aridai , and Vaizatha .
CEB	Esther	9	2	The Jews joined together in their towns in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus to defend themselves against those who tried to harm them . No one was able to stand in their way because everyone was afraid of the Jews .
CEB	Esther	9	3	All the leaders of the provinces , rulers , governors , and those in charge of the king ’ s business helped the Jews because they were afraid of Mordecai .
CEB	Esther	9	4	Because Mordecai was very important in the palace , news about him was sweeping through the provinces . Indeed , Mordecai was becoming more and more important every day .
CEB	Esther	9	5	The Jews put down all their enemies with sword blows , killing , and destruction . They did whatever they wanted with those who hated them .
CEB	Esther	9	6	In the fortified part of Susa , the Jews killed five hundred people .
CEB	Esther	9	7	They also killed Parshandatha , Dalphon , Aspatha ,
CEB	Esther	9	8	Poratha , Adalia , Aridatha ,
CEB	Esther	9	10	These were the ten sons of Haman , Hammedatha ’ s son , the enemy of the Jews . But the Jews didn ’ t lay a hand on anything their enemies owned .
CEB	Esther	9	11	That same day , a report concerning the number killed in the fortified part of Susa reached the king .
CEB	Esther	9	12	So the king said to Queen Esther in the fortified part of Susa , “ The Jews have killed five hundred people as well as the ten sons of Haman . What have they done in the rest of the royal provinces ? What do you wish now ? I ’ ll give it to you . What is your desire ? I ’ ll do it this time too. ”
CEB	Esther	9	13	Esther answered , “ If the king wishes , let the Jews who are in Susa also have tomorrow to do what the law allows for today . And let them also impale the ten sons of Haman on pointed poles. ”
CEB	Esther	9	14	The king ordered that this be done , and the law became public in Susa . They impaled the ten sons of Haman just as she said .
CEB	Esther	9	15	The Jews in Susa joined together again , this time on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar . In Susa , they killed three hundred people , but they didn ’ t lay a hand on anything the people owned .
CEB	Esther	9	16	The Jews out in the royal provinces also joined together to defend their lives . They put to rest the troubles with their enemies and killed those who hated them . The total was seventy-five thousand dead , but the Jews didn ’ t lay a hand on anything their enemies owned .
CEB	Esther	9	17	They acted on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar . Then on the fourteenth day they rested , making it a day of feasts and rejoicing . (
CEB	Esther	9	18	The Jews in Susa joined together for self-defense on the thirteenth and fourteenth days of the month . But they rested on the fifteenth day of the month and made it a day of feasts and joyous events . )
CEB	Esther	9	19	That is why Jews who live in villages make the fourteenth day of the month of Adar a day of rejoicing and feasts , a holiday . It is a day on which they send gifts of food to each other . The new holiday of Purim
CEB	Esther	9	20	Mordecai wrote these things down and sent letters to all the Jews in all the provinces , both near and far , of King Ahasuerus .
CEB	Esther	9	21	He made it a rule that Jews keep the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month of Adar as special days each and every year .
CEB	Esther	9	22	They are the days on which the Jews finally put to rest the troubles with their enemies . The month is the one when everything turned around for them from sadness to joy , and from sad , loud crying to a holiday . They are to make them days of feasts and joyous events , days to send food gifts to each other and money gifts to the poor .
CEB	Esther	9	23	The Jews agreed to continue what they had already begun to do—just what Mordecai had written to them .
CEB	Esther	9	24	Indeed , Haman , Hammedatha the Agagite ’ s son , the enemy of all the Jews , had planned to destroy the Jews . He had servants throw pur ( that is , the dice ) to find the best month and day to trouble greatly and destroy them .
CEB	Esther	9	25	But when Esther came before the king , his written order said : The wicked plan that Haman made against the Jews should turn back on him instead . So they impaled him and his sons on pointed poles .
CEB	Esther	9	26	That is why people call these days Purim , by using the ancient word pur . It all fit with what this letter said , with what they saw happen , and with what they themselves went through .
CEB	Esther	9	27	The Jews agreed that they , their children , grandchildren , and great-grandchildren , as well as all non-Jews who become Jews , should always keep these two days . They agreed to follow the written rules—and at the proper time too—every year .
CEB	Esther	9	28	So forever every family , province , and town remembers to keep these days . These days of Purim won ’ t die out among the Jews . They will remember to keep them forever .
CEB	Esther	9	29	Queen Esther daughter of Abihail , along with Mordecai the Jew , wrote with her full royal power to show that this second letter about Purim was correct . [ b ]
CEB	Esther	9	30	Letters conveying good wishes and words of friendship were sent to all the Jews throughout the one hundred twenty-seven provinces in the kingdom of Ahasuerus .
CEB	Esther	9	31	Their aim was to make sure that the Jews kept these days of Purim at the proper time , following the rule that Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had made . The rule fit well with what they themselves had agreed to do forever and with other things they did—like fasting and lamenting .
CEB	Esther	9	32	Esther ’ s order made these features of Purim part of the law , so it was written down . Footnotes - Esther 9:1 February–March - Esther 9:29 Or wrote a second time to show that this letter
CEB	Esther	10	10	King Ahasuerus taxed the entire kingdom , including the islands of the Mediterranean .
CEB	Esther	10	2	Now some may want to know about all the king ’ s mighty , great deeds . They may also want a full report about how important Mordecai became after the king honored him . Are they not written in the official records of the kings of Media and Persia ?
CEB	Esther	10	3	Certainly , Mordecai the Jew was second only to King Ahasuerus in importance . The Jews also admired him greatly , and his many brothers and sisters were proud of him . He always wanted to do good things for his Jewish people and to speak up for all his family whenever they needed help .

CEB	Job	1	1	A man in the land of Uz was named Job . That man was honest , a person of absolute integrity ; he feared God and avoided evil .
CEB	Job	1	2	He had seven sons and three daughters ,
CEB	Job	1	3	and owned seven thousand sheep , three thousand camels , five hundred pairs of oxen , five hundred female donkeys , and a vast number of servants , so that he was greater than all the people of the east .
CEB	Job	1	4	Each of his sons hosted a feast in his own house on his birthday . They invited their three sisters to eat and drink with them .
CEB	Job	1	5	When the days of the feast had been completed , Job would send word [ a ] and purify his children . [ b ] Getting up early in the morning , he prepared entirely burned offerings for each one of them , for Job thought , Perhaps my children have sinned and then cursed [ c ] God in their hearts . Job did this regularly . Job ’ s motives questioned
CEB	Job	1	6	One day the divine beings [ d ] came to present themselves before the Lord , and the Adversary [ e ] also came among them .
CEB	Job	1	7	The Lord said to the Adversary , “ Where did you come from ? ” The Adversary answered the Lord , “ From wandering throughout the earth. ”
CEB	Job	1	8	The Lord said to the Adversary , “ Have you thought about my servant Job ; surely there is no one like him on earth , a man who is honest , who is of absolute integrity , who reveres God and avoids evil ? ”
CEB	Job	1	9	The Adversary answered the Lord , “ Does Job revere God for nothing ?
CEB	Job	1	10	Haven ’ t you fenced him in—his house and all he has—and blessed the work of his hands so that his possessions extend throughout the earth ?
CEB	Job	1	11	But stretch out your hand and strike all he has . He will certainly curse you to your face. ”
CEB	Job	1	12	The Lord said to the Adversary , “ Look , all he has is within your power ; only don ’ t stretch out your hand against him. ” So the Adversary left the Lord ’ s presence . Job passes the test
CEB	Job	1	13	One day Job ’ s sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother ’ s house .
CEB	Job	1	14	A messenger came to Job and said : “ The oxen were plowing , and the donkeys were grazing nearby
CEB	Job	1	15	when the Sabeans took them and killed the young men with swords . I alone escaped to tell you. ”
CEB	Job	1	16	While this messenger was speaking , another arrived and said : “ A raging fire fell from the sky and burned up the sheep and devoured the young men . I alone escaped to tell you. ”
CEB	Job	1	17	While this messenger was speaking , another arrived and said : “ Chaldeans set up three companies , raided the camels and took them , killing the young men with swords . I alone escaped to tell you. ”
CEB	Job	1	18	While this messenger was speaking , another arrived and said : “ Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother ’ s house ,
CEB	Job	1	19	when a strong wind came from the desert and struck the four corners of the house . It fell upon the young people , and they died . I alone escaped to tell you. ”
CEB	Job	1	20	Job arose , tore his clothes , shaved his head , fell to the ground , and worshipped .
CEB	Job	1	21	He said : “ Naked I came from my mother ’ s womb ; naked I will return there . The Lord has given ; the Lord has taken ; bless the Lord ’ s name. ”
CEB	Job	1	22	In all this , Job didn ’ t sin or blame God .
CEB	Job	2	2	The Lord said to the Adversary , “ Where have you come from ? ” The Adversary answered the Lord , “ From wandering throughout the earth. ”
CEB	Job	2	3	The Lord said to the Adversary , “ Have you thought about my servant Job , for there is no one like him on earth , a man who is honest , who is of absolute integrity , who reveres God and avoids evil ? He still holds on to his integrity , even though you incited me to ruin him for no reason. ”
CEB	Job	2	4	The Adversary responded to the Lord , “ Skin for skin—people will give up everything they have in exchange for their lives .
CEB	Job	2	5	But stretch out your hand and strike his bones and flesh . Then he will definitely curse [ a ] you to your face. ”
CEB	Job	2	6	The Lord answered the Adversary , “ There he is—within your power ; only preserve his life. ” The test intensifies
CEB	Job	2	7	The Adversary departed from the Lord ’ s presence and struck Job with severe sores from the sole of his foot to the top of his head .
CEB	Job	2	8	Job took a piece of broken pottery to scratch himself and sat down on a mound of ashes .
CEB	Job	2	9	Job ’ s wife said to him , “ Are you still clinging to your integrity ? Curse [ b ] God , and die. ”
CEB	Job	2	10	Job said to her , “ You ’ re talking like a foolish woman . Will we receive good from God but not also receive bad ? ” In all this , Job didn ’ t sin with his lips . Job ’ s three friends come to comfort him
CEB	Job	2	11	When Job ’ s three friends heard about all this disaster that had happened to him , they came , each one from his home—Eliphaz from Teman , Bildad from Shuah , and Zophar from Naamah . They agreed to come so they could console and comfort him .
CEB	Job	2	12	When they looked up from a distance and didn ’ t recognize him , they wept loudly . Each one tore his garment and scattered dust above his head toward the sky .
CEB	Job	2	13	They sat with Job on the ground seven days and seven nights , not speaking a word to him , for they saw that he was in excruciating pain .
CEB	Job	3	3	Perish the day I was born , the night someone said , “ A boy has been conceived. ”
CEB	Job	3	2	Job said :
CEB	Job	3	4	That day—let it be darkness ; may God above ignore it , and light not shine on it .
CEB	Job	3	5	May deepest darkness claim it and a cloud linger over it ; may all that darkens the day terrify it .
CEB	Job	3	6	May gloom seize that night ; may it not be counted in the days of a year ; may it not appear in the months .
CEB	Job	3	7	May that night be childless ; may no happy singing come in it .
CEB	Job	3	8	May those who curse the day curse it , those with enough skill to awaken Leviathan .
CEB	Job	3	9	May its evening stars stay dark ; may it wait in vain for light ; may it not see dawn ’ s gleam ,
CEB	Job	3	10	because it didn ’ t close the doors of my mother ’ s womb , [ a ] didn ’ t hide trouble from my eyes . Job laments his misfortune
CEB	Job	3	11	Why didn ’ t I die at birth , come forth from the womb and die ?
CEB	Job	3	12	Why did knees receive me and breasts let me nurse ?
CEB	Job	3	13	For now I would be lying down quietly ; I ’ d sleep ; rest would be mine
CEB	Job	3	14	with kings and earth ’ s advisors , who rebuild ruins for themselves ,
CEB	Job	3	15	or with princes who have gold , who fill their houses with silver .
CEB	Job	3	16	Or why wasn ’ t I like a buried miscarried infant , like babies who never see light ?
CEB	Job	3	17	There the wicked rage no more ; there the weak rest .
CEB	Job	3	18	Prisoners are entirely at ease ; they don ’ t hear a boss ’ s voice .
CEB	Job	3	19	Both small and great are there ; a servant is free from his masters .
CEB	Job	3	20	Why is light given to the hard worker , life to those bitter of soul ,
CEB	Job	3	21	those waiting in vain for death , who search for it more than for treasure ,
CEB	Job	3	22	who rejoice excitedly , who are thrilled when they find a grave ?
CEB	Job	3	23	Why is light given [ b ] to the person whose way is hidden , whom God has fenced in ?
CEB	Job	3	24	My groans become my bread ; my roars pour out like water .
CEB	Job	3	25	Because I was afraid of something awful , and it arrived ; what I dreaded came to me .
CEB	Job	3	26	I had no ease , quiet , or rest , and trembling came .
CEB	Job	4	4	Your words have raised up the falling ; you ’ ve steadied failing knees .
CEB	Job	4	2	If one tries to answer you , will you be annoyed ? But who can hold words back ?
CEB	Job	4	3	Look , you ’ ve instructed many and given strength to drooping hands .
CEB	Job	4	5	But now it comes to you , and you are dismayed ; it has struck you , and you are frightened .
CEB	Job	4	6	Isn ’ t your religion the source of [ a ] your confidence ; the integrity of your conduct , the source of your hope ? Sinners don ’ t live long
CEB	Job	4	7	Think ! What innocent person has ever perished ? When have those who do the right thing been destroyed ?
CEB	Job	4	8	As I ’ ve observed , those who plow sin and sow trouble will harvest it .
CEB	Job	4	9	When God breathes deeply , they perish ; by a breath of his nostril they are annihilated .
CEB	Job	4	10	The roar of a lion and snarl of the king of beasts— yet the teeth of lions are shattered ;
CEB	Job	4	11	the lion perishes without prey , and its cubs are scattered . A frightening dream
CEB	Job	4	12	But a word sneaked up on me ; my ears caught a hint of it .
CEB	Job	4	13	In profound thoughts , visions of night , when deep sleep falls on people ,
CEB	Job	4	14	fear and dread struck me ; all of my bones shook .
CEB	Job	4	15	A breeze swept by my face ; the hair of my skin bristled .
CEB	Job	4	16	It stopped . I didn ’ t recognize its visible form , although a figure was in front of my eyes . Silence ! Then I heard a voice :
CEB	Job	4	17	“ Can a human be more righteous than God , a person purer than their maker ? ” Its interpretation
CEB	Job	4	18	If he doesn ’ t trust his servants and levels a charge against his messengers ,
CEB	Job	4	19	how much less those who dwell in houses of clay , whose foundations are in dust , and who are crushed like a moth ?
CEB	Job	4	20	They are smashed between morning and evening ; they perish forever without anyone knowing .
CEB	Job	4	21	Isn ’ t their tent cord pulled up ? They die without wisdom . [ b ]
CEB	Job	5	5	The hungry devour [ b ] their crops ; it ’ s taken even from the thorns , [ c ] and the thirsty pant after their yield .
CEB	Job	5	2	Surely anger can kill the foolish ; fury can kill the simple .
CEB	Job	5	3	I ’ ve seen the foolish take root and promptly curse their house .
CEB	Job	5	4	Their children are far [ a ] from safety , crushed in the gate without a deliverer .
CEB	Job	5	6	Surely trouble doesn ’ t come from dust , nor does distress sprout from the ground .
CEB	Job	5	7	Surely humans are born to distress , just as sparks rise up . The answer is God
CEB	Job	5	8	But I would seek God , put my case to God ,
CEB	Job	5	9	who does great things beyond comprehension , wonderful things without number ;
CEB	Job	5	10	who provides rain over the earth ’ s surface , sends water to the open country ,
CEB	Job	5	11	exalts the lowly , raises mourners to victory ;
CEB	Job	5	12	who frustrates the schemes of the clever so that their hands achieve no success ,
CEB	Job	5	13	trapping the wise in their cleverness so that the plans of the devious don ’ t succeed .
CEB	Job	5	14	They encounter darkness during the day , and at noon they fumble about as at night .
CEB	Job	5	15	Yet he rescues the orphan [ d ] from the sword of their mouth , the needy from the grip of the strong ;
CEB	Job	5	16	so the poor have hope and violence shuts its mouth . Divine favor
CEB	Job	5	17	Look , happy is the person whom God corrects ; so don ’ t reject the Almighty ’ s instruction .
CEB	Job	5	18	He injures , but he binds up ; he strikes , but his hands heal .
CEB	Job	5	19	From six adversities he will deliver you ; from seven harm won ’ t touch you .
CEB	Job	5	20	In famine he will ransom you from death ; in war , from the power of the sword .
CEB	Job	5	21	You will be hidden from the tongue ’ s sting , and you won ’ t fear destruction when it comes .
CEB	Job	5	22	You will laugh at destruction and hunger ; you won ’ t be afraid of wild beasts ;
CEB	Job	5	23	for you will make an agreement with the stones of the field ; and the beasts of the field will be at peace with you .
CEB	Job	5	24	You will know that your tent is secure . You will examine your home and miss nothing .
CEB	Job	5	25	You will know that you ’ ll have many children . Your offspring will be like the grass of the earth .
CEB	Job	5	26	You will come to your grave in old age as bundles of grain stacked up at harvesttime .
CEB	Job	5	27	Look , we ’ ve searched this out , and so it is ; listen and find out for yourself .
CEB	Job	6	6	Is tasteless food eaten without salt , or does egg white [ b ] have taste ?
CEB	Job	6	2	Oh , that my grief were actually weighed , all of it were lifted up in scales ;
CEB	Job	6	3	for now it ’ s heavier than the sands of the sea ; therefore , my words are rash . [ a ]
CEB	Job	6	4	The Almighty ’ s arrows are in me ; my spirit drinks their poison , and God ’ s terrors are arrayed against me .
CEB	Job	6	5	Does a donkey bray over grass or an ox bellow over its fodder ?
CEB	Job	6	7	I refuse to touch them ; they resemble food for the sick . He wishes to die
CEB	Job	6	8	Oh , that what I ’ ve requested would come and God grant my hope ;
CEB	Job	6	9	that God be willing to crush me , release his hand and cut me off .
CEB	Job	6	10	I ’ d still take comfort , relieved [ c ] even though in persistent pain ; for I ’ ve not denied the words of the holy one .
CEB	Job	6	11	What is my strength , that I should hope ; my end , that my life should drag on ?
CEB	Job	6	12	Is my strength that of rocks , my flesh bronze ?
CEB	Job	6	13	I don ’ t have a helper for myself ; success has been taken from me . He accuses his friends
CEB	Job	6	14	Are friends loyal to the one who despairs , [ d ] or do they stop fearing the Almighty ?
CEB	Job	6	15	My companions are treacherous like a stream in the desert , like channels that overrun their streambeds ,
CEB	Job	6	16	like those darkened by thawing ice , in which snow is obscured
CEB	Job	6	17	but that stop flowing in dry times and vanish from their channels in heat .
CEB	Job	6	18	Caravans turn aside from their paths ; they go up into untamed areas and perish .
CEB	Job	6	19	Caravans from Tema look ; merchants from Sheba hope for it .
CEB	Job	6	20	They are ashamed that they trusted ; they arrive and are dismayed .
CEB	Job	6	21	That ’ s what you are like ; [ e ] you see something awful and are afraid . He appeals to his friends
CEB	Job	6	22	Have I said , “ Give me something ? Offer a bribe from your wealth for me ?
CEB	Job	6	23	Rescue me from the hand of my enemy ? Ransom me from the grip of the ruthless ? ”
CEB	Job	6	24	Instruct me and I ’ ll be quiet ; inform me how I ’ ve erred .
CEB	Job	6	25	How painful are truthful words , but what do your condemnations accomplish ?
CEB	Job	6	26	Do you intend to correct my words , to treat the words of a hopeless man as wind ?
CEB	Job	6	27	Would you even gamble over an orphan , barter away your friend ?
CEB	Job	6	28	Now look at me— would I lie to your face ?
CEB	Job	6	29	Turn ! Don ’ t be faithless . Turn now ! I am righteous .
CEB	Job	6	30	Is there wrong on my tongue , or can my mouth not recognize disaster ?
CEB	Job	7	7	Remember that my life is wind ; my eyes won ’ t see pleasure again .
CEB	Job	7	2	Like a slave we pant for a shadow , await our task like a hired worker .
CEB	Job	7	3	So I have inherited months of emptiness ; nights of toil have been measured out for me .
CEB	Job	7	4	If I lie down and think—When will I get up ? — night drags on , [ a ] and restless thoughts fill me until dawn .
CEB	Job	7	5	My flesh is covered with worms and crusted earth ; my skin hardens and oozes .
CEB	Job	7	6	My days are swifter than a weaver ’ s shuttle ; they reach their end without hope . [ b ]
CEB	Job	7	8	""
CEB	Job	7	9	A cloud breaks apart and moves on— like the one who descends to the grave [ c ] and won ’ t rise ,
CEB	Job	7	10	won ’ t return home again , won ’ t be recognized in town anymore . Job wants to be left alone
CEB	Job	7	11	But I won ’ t keep quiet ; I will speak in the adversity of my spirit , groan in the bitterness of my life .
CEB	Job	7	12	Am I Sea [ d ] or the Sea Monster [ e ] that you place me under guard ?
CEB	Job	7	13	If I say , “ My couch will comfort me , ” my bed will diminish my murmuring .
CEB	Job	7	14	You scare me with dreams , frighten me with visions .
CEB	Job	7	15	I would choose strangling and death instead of my bones .
CEB	Job	7	16	I reject life ; [ f ] I don ’ t want to live long ; leave me alone , for my days are empty . A parody of Psalm
CEB	Job	7	17	What are human beings , that you exalt them , that you take note of them ,
CEB	Job	7	18	visit them each morning , test them every moment ?
CEB	Job	7	19	Why not look away from me ; let me alone until I swallow my spit ?
CEB	Job	7	20	If I sinned , what did I do to you , guardian of people ? Why have you made me your target so that I ’ m a burden to myself ?
CEB	Job	7	21	Why not forgive my sin , overlook my iniquity ? Then I would lie down in the dust ; you would search hard for me , and I would not exist .
CEB	Job	8	8	Ask a previous generation and verify the findings of your ancestors ,
CEB	Job	8	2	How long will you mouth such things such that your utterances become a strong wind ?
CEB	Job	8	3	Does God pervert justice , or does the Almighty distort what is right ?
CEB	Job	8	4	If your children sinned against him , then he delivered them into the power of their rebellion .
CEB	Job	8	5	If you will search eagerly for God , plead with the Almighty .
CEB	Job	8	6	If you are pure and do the right thing , then surely he will become active on your behalf and reward your innocent dwelling .
CEB	Job	8	7	Although your former state was ordinary , your future will be extraordinary . Tradition
CEB	Job	8	9	for we are only recently here and don ’ t know because our days on earth are a shadow .
CEB	Job	8	10	Won ’ t they instruct you and tell you ; will words not [ a ] proceed from their hearts ? Examples from nature
CEB	Job	8	11	Does papyrus grow apart from a marsh ? Does a reed flourish without water ?
CEB	Job	8	12	While still tender , uncut , it will wither before every other grass .
CEB	Job	8	13	So are the paths of all who forget God . Hope perishes for the godless ,
CEB	Job	8	14	whose confidence is a fragile thing , [ b ] their trust , a spider ’ s web .
CEB	Job	8	15	He leans on its web , and it doesn ’ t stand ; grasps it , and it can ’ t remain in place .
CEB	Job	8	16	It ’ s like a well-watered plant in the sun ; its runners spread over its gardens .
CEB	Job	8	17	Its roots are entwined over a pile of rocks , for it sees a home among stones .
CEB	Job	8	18	If it ’ s uprooted from its place , it lies , saying , “ I can ’ t see you. ”
CEB	Job	8	19	Surely its way is a joy , for from the dust other plants [ c ] sprout . God ’ s faithfulness
CEB	Job	8	20	Surely God won ’ t reject integrity , won ’ t strengthen the hand of the wicked .
CEB	Job	8	21	He will still fill your mouth with joy , your lips with a victorious shout .
CEB	Job	8	22	Those who hate you will be clothed with shame , and the tent of the wicked will vanish .
CEB	Job	9	9	made the Bear and Orion , Pleiades and the southern constellations ;
CEB	Job	9	2	I know for certain that this is so ; and how can anyone be innocent before God ?
CEB	Job	9	3	If one wants to contend with him , he won ’ t answer one in a thousand .
CEB	Job	9	4	He is wise [ a ] and powerful ; who can resist him and prosper ?
CEB	Job	9	5	Who removes mountains , and they are unaware ; who overthrows them in anger ?
CEB	Job	9	6	Who shakes the earth from its place , and its pillars shudder ?
CEB	Job	9	7	Who commands the sun , and it does not rise , even seals up the stars ;
CEB	Job	9	8	stretched out the heavens alone and trod on the waves of the Sea ; [ b ]
CEB	Job	9	10	does great and unsearchable things , wonders beyond number ? A mismatch
CEB	Job	9	11	If God goes by me , I can ’ t see him ; he glides past , and I can ’ t perceive him .
CEB	Job	9	12	If he seizes , who can bring back ? Who can say to him , “ What are you doing ? ”
CEB	Job	9	13	God won ’ t retract his anger ; the helpers of Rahab bow beneath him .
CEB	Job	9	14	Yet I myself will answer him ; I ’ ll choose my words in a contest [ c ] with him .
CEB	Job	9	15	Even if I ’ m innocent , I can ’ t answer ; I must plead for justice .
CEB	Job	9	16	If I were to call and he answered me , I couldn ’ t believe that he heard my voice .
CEB	Job	9	17	Who bruises me with a tempest and multiplies my wounds for no reason ?
CEB	Job	9	18	He doesn ’ t let me catch my breath , for he fills me with bitterness .
CEB	Job	9	19	If the issue is strength—behold power ! If justice—who calls God to meet me ? There is no justice
CEB	Job	9	20	If I ’ m innocent , my mouth condemns me ; I have integrity ; but God declares me perverse .
CEB	Job	9	21	I ’ m blameless , yet don ’ t know myself ; I reject my life .
CEB	Job	9	22	It ’ s all the same ; therefore , I say God destroys the blameless and the sinners .
CEB	Job	9	23	If calamity suddenly kills , he mocks at the slaying [ d ] of innocents .
CEB	Job	9	24	The earth is handed over to the wicked ; he covers the faces of its judges . If not God , then who does ? Job wants an arbitrator
CEB	Job	9	25	My days are swifter than a runner ; they flee and don ’ t experience good .
CEB	Job	9	26	They sweep by like ships made of reeds , as an eagle swoops on prey .
CEB	Job	9	27	If I say , “ I ’ ll forget my lament , put on a different face so I can smile , ”
CEB	Job	9	28	I ’ m still afraid of all my suffering ; I know that you won ’ t declare me innocent .
CEB	Job	9	29	I myself am thought guilty ; why have I tried so hard in vain ?
CEB	Job	9	30	If I wash myself with snow , purify my hands with soap ,
CEB	Job	9	31	then you ’ ll hurl me into a slimy pit so that my clothes detest me .
CEB	Job	9	32	God is not a man like me—someone I could answer— so that we could come together in court .
CEB	Job	9	33	Oh , that [ e ] there were a mediator between us ; he would lay his hand on both of us ,
CEB	Job	9	34	remove his rod from me , so his fury wouldn ’ t frighten me .
CEB	Job	9	35	Then I would speak—unafraid— for I ’ m not that way .
CEB	Job	10	10	Didn ’ t you pour me out like milk , curdle me like cheese ?
CEB	Job	10	2	I will say to God , Don ’ t declare me guilty ; tell me what you are accusing me of doing .
CEB	Job	10	3	Does it seem good to you that you oppress me , that you reject the work of your hands and cause the purpose of sinners to shine ?
CEB	Job	10	4	Do you have physical eyes ; do you see like a human ?
CEB	Job	10	5	Are your days like those of a human , your years like years of a human ,
CEB	Job	10	6	that you search for my wrongdoing and seek my sin ?
CEB	Job	10	7	You know that I ’ m not guilty , yet no one delivers me from your power . Creator
CEB	Job	10	8	Your hands fashioned and made me ; yet you want to destroy me utterly .
CEB	Job	10	9	Remember that you made me from [ a ] clay , and you will return me to dust .
CEB	Job	10	11	You clothed me with skin and flesh , wove me from bones and sinews .
CEB	Job	10	12	Life and kindness you gave me , and you oversaw and preserved my breath . No hiding place
CEB	Job	10	13	These things you hid in your heart ; I know this is the case with you .
CEB	Job	10	14	If I sin and you observe me , you won ’ t consider me innocent of wrongdoing .
CEB	Job	10	15	If I were guilty , doom to me ; I ’ m innocent , but can ’ t lift my head , full of shame and facing my misery .
CEB	Job	10	16	I could boast like a lion , and you would hunt me ; you would do awesome things to me again .
CEB	Job	10	17	You continue to send your witnesses against me and increase your anger toward me , a swift army against me . [ b ] Death wish
CEB	Job	10	18	Why did you let me emerge from the womb ? I wish I had died without any eye seeing me .
CEB	Job	10	19	Then I would be just as if I hadn ’ t existed , taken from the belly to the grave .
CEB	Job	10	20	Aren ’ t my few days coming to an end ? Look away from me so I can brighten up a little
CEB	Job	10	21	before I go and don ’ t return to a land of deepest darkness ,
CEB	Job	10	22	a land whose light is like gloom , utter darkness and confusion , such that light shines like gloom .
CEB	Job	11	11	He knows worthless people , sees sin , and certainly [ c ] takes note .
CEB	Job	11	2	Should all these words go unanswered or a wordy man be justified ?
CEB	Job	11	3	Will your idle talk silence everyone ; will you mock and not be put to shame ?
CEB	Job	11	4	You ’ ve said , “ My teaching is pure , and I ’ m clean in God ’ s [ a ] eyes. ” Divine secrecy
CEB	Job	11	5	But oh , that God would speak , open his lips against you
CEB	Job	11	6	and tell you secrets of wisdom ; for sound insight has two sides . Know that God lets some of your sin be forgotten .
CEB	Job	11	7	Can you find the secret of God or find the extent of the Almighty ?
CEB	Job	11	8	They are higher than the heavens—what can you do ? Deeper than the underworld [ b ] —what can you know ?
CEB	Job	11	9	Its measurement is longer than the earth and broader than the sea .
CEB	Job	11	10	If God passes by , imprisons someone , and calls a trial , who can stop him ?
CEB	Job	11	12	A stupid person becomes intelligent when a wild ass of a person is born tame . [ d ] Abiding hope
CEB	Job	11	13	If you make your mind resolute and spread your palms to him ,
CEB	Job	11	14	if you throw out the sin in your hands and don ’ t let injustice dwell in your tents ,
CEB	Job	11	15	then you will lift up your face without blemish ; you will be secure and not fear .
CEB	Job	11	16	You will forget trouble ; you will remember it as water that flows past .
CEB	Job	11	17	A life span will rise brighter than noon ; darkness will be like morning .
CEB	Job	11	18	You will be secure , for there is hope ; you will look around and rest safely .
CEB	Job	11	19	You will lie down without anyone to scare you ; many will beg for your favor .
CEB	Job	11	20	The eyes of the wicked will grow faint ; flight has vanished from them ; their hope is a dying gasp .
CEB	Job	12	12	“ In old age is wisdom ; understanding in a long life. ” God ’ s majesty
CEB	Job	12	2	Surely you are the people , and wisdom will die with you .
CEB	Job	12	3	I am also intelligent ; I ’ m not inferior to you . Who isn ’ t like these people ? [ a ]
CEB	Job	12	4	I ’ m a joke to friends who called to God and he answered ; the innocent and blameless one is a joke ,
CEB	Job	12	5	a torch [ b ] of contempt to one who is idle , a fixed point for slipping feet . Proverbial wisdom
CEB	Job	12	6	Raiders ’ tents are prosperous and God ’ s provokers secure , who carry God in their hands . [ c ]
CEB	Job	12	7	But ask Behemoth , and he will teach you , the birds in the sky , and they will tell you ;
CEB	Job	12	8	or talk to earth , and it will teach you ; the fish of the sea will recount it for you .
CEB	Job	12	9	Among all these , who hasn ’ t known that the Lord ’ s hand did this ?
CEB	Job	12	10	In whose grasp is the life of every thing , the breath of every person ?
CEB	Job	12	11	Doesn ’ t the ear test words and the palate taste food ?
CEB	Job	12	13	With him are wisdom and power ; counsel and understanding are his .
CEB	Job	12	14	If he tears down , it can ’ t be rebuilt ; if he ties a person up , he can ’ t be set free .
CEB	Job	12	15	If he restricts water , they have drought ; if he lets it loose , it overturns the land .
CEB	Job	12	16	With him are might and success ; the deceiver and the deceived are his .
CEB	Job	12	17	He leads advisors away barefoot ; makes madmen of judges ;
CEB	Job	12	18	unties the belt of kings , binds a garment around their loins ;
CEB	Job	12	19	leads priests away barefoot ; overthrows the well-established ;
CEB	Job	12	20	silences the talk of trusted people ; takes away elders ’ discernment ;
CEB	Job	12	21	pours contempt on royalty ; loosens the belt of the strong ;
CEB	Job	12	22	discloses deep secrets of darkness , makes utter darkness enter the light ;
CEB	Job	12	23	makes nations prominent and destroys them , expands nations and leads them astray ;
CEB	Job	12	24	takes away the power to think from earth ’ s leaders , making them wander in untraveled wastelands .
CEB	Job	12	25	They feel their way in the dark without light ; he makes them stumble like drunks .
CEB	Job	13	13	Be quiet and I will speak , come what may .
CEB	Job	13	2	Just as you know , I also know ; I ’ m not inferior to you .
CEB	Job	13	3	But I want to speak to the Almighty ; I would gladly present my case to God . Friends attacked
CEB	Job	13	4	You , however , are plasterers of lies ; ineffective healers , all of you .
CEB	Job	13	5	Would that you were completely quiet ; that would be your wisdom .
CEB	Job	13	6	Hear my teaching and pay attention to the arguments of my lips .
CEB	Job	13	7	Will you speak injustice for God , speak deceit on his behalf ?
CEB	Job	13	8	Will you be partial or contend for God ?
CEB	Job	13	9	Will it go well when he searches you , or can you fool him as you fool people ?
CEB	Job	13	10	He will certainly correct you if you ’ ve been secretly partial .
CEB	Job	13	11	Wouldn ’ t his majesty scare you and dread of him fall on you ?
CEB	Job	13	12	Your old sayings are proverbs made of ashes , your sayings defenses made of clay . Job will speak out
CEB	Job	13	14	For what reason will I take my flesh in my teeth , put my life in jeopardy ?
CEB	Job	13	15	He will slay me ; I ’ m without hope ; [ a ] I will surely prove my way to his face .
CEB	Job	13	16	Also this will be my vindication , that a godless person won ’ t come before him .
CEB	Job	13	17	Listen closely to my words so that my remarks will be in your ears . Against God
CEB	Job	13	18	Look , I have laid out my case ; I know that I ’ m innocent .
CEB	Job	13	19	Who would dare contend with me , for then I would be quiet and die .
CEB	Job	13	20	Only don ’ t do two things to me , then I won ’ t hide from your face .
CEB	Job	13	21	Remove your hand far from me and don ’ t terrify me with your anger .
CEB	Job	13	22	Then call and I ’ ll answer , or I ’ ll speak and you can reply .
CEB	Job	13	23	How many are my offenses and sins ? Inform me about my rebellions and sins .
CEB	Job	13	24	Why hide your face from me and consider me your enemy ?
CEB	Job	13	25	Will you cause a wind-tossed leaf to tremble , or will you pursue dry straw ?
CEB	Job	13	26	You even write bitter things about me , make me inherit my youthful indiscretions .
CEB	Job	13	27	You tie up my feet and restrict all actions ; you stamp marks on the bottom of my feet . Human destiny
CEB	Job	13	28	Surely a person wastes away like refuse , like clothing that a moth eats . Footnotes - Job 13:15 Or Though he slay me , yet I will trust him .
CEB	Job	14	14	If people die , will they live again ? All the days of my service I would wait until my restoration took place .
CEB	Job	14	2	Like a flower , we [ b ] bloom , then wither , flee like a shadow , and don ’ t last . (
CEB	Job	14	3	Yes , you open your eyes on this one ; you bring me into trial against you . )
CEB	Job	14	4	Who can make pure from impure ? Nobody .
CEB	Job	14	5	If our days are fixed , the number of our months with you , you set a statute and we can ’ t exceed it .
CEB	Job	14	6	Look away from us that we may rest , until we are satisfied like a worker at day ’ s end . Trees versus humans
CEB	Job	14	7	Indeed there is hope for a tree . If it ’ s cut down and still sprouting and its shoots don ’ t fail ,
CEB	Job	14	8	if its roots age in the ground and its stump dies in the dust ,
CEB	Job	14	9	at the scent of water , it will bud and produce sprouts like a plant .
CEB	Job	14	10	But a human dies and lies there ; a person expires , and where is he ?
CEB	Job	14	11	Water vanishes from the sea ; a river dries up completely .
CEB	Job	14	12	But a human lies down and doesn ’ t rise until the heavens cease ; they don ’ t get up and awaken from sleep . Momentary hope
CEB	Job	14	13	I wish you would hide me in the underworld , [ c ] conceal me until your anger passes , set a time for me , and remember me .
CEB	Job	14	15	You would call , and I would answer you ; you would long for your handiwork .
CEB	Job	14	16	Though you now number my steps , you would not keep a record of my sin .
CEB	Job	14	17	My rebellion is sealed in a bag ; you would cover my sin . God crushes hope
CEB	Job	14	18	But an eroding mountain breaks up , and rock is displaced .
CEB	Job	14	19	Water wears away boulders ; floods carry away soil ; you destroy a people ’ s hope .
CEB	Job	14	20	You overpower them relentlessly , and they die ; you change their appearance and send them away .
CEB	Job	14	21	Their children achieve honor , and they don ’ t know it ; their children become insignificant , and they don ’ t see it .
CEB	Job	14	22	They only feel the pain of their body , and they mourn for themselves .
CEB	Job	15	15	If he doesn ’ t trust his holy ones and the heavens aren ’ t pure in his eyes ,
CEB	Job	15	2	Will the wise respond with windy knowledge and fill their belly with the east wind ?
CEB	Job	15	3	Will they argue with a word that has no benefit and with unprofitable words ?
CEB	Job	15	4	You are truly making religion ineffective and restraining meditation before God .
CEB	Job	15	5	Your mouth multiplies your sins a thousand times ; you opt for a clever tongue .
CEB	Job	15	6	Your mouth condemns you , not I ; your lips argue against you .
CEB	Job	15	7	Were you born the first Adam , brought forth before the hills ?
CEB	Job	15	8	Did you listen in God ’ s council ; is wisdom limited to you ?
CEB	Job	15	9	What do you know that we don ’ t know ; what do you understand that isn ’ t among us ?
CEB	Job	15	10	Both the graybeard and the aged are with us ; those much older than your father .
CEB	Job	15	11	Are God ’ s comforts not enough for you , a word spoken gently with you ?
CEB	Job	15	12	Why has your mind seized you , why have your eyes flashed ,
CEB	Job	15	13	so that you return your breath to God and utter such words from your mouth ?
CEB	Job	15	14	What are humans that they might be pure , and those born of woman that they might be innocent ?
CEB	Job	15	16	how much less those who are abominable and corrupt , for they drink sin like water . The wicked ’ s downfall
CEB	Job	15	17	Listen to me ; I will argue with you ; what I ’ ve seen , I will declare to you ;
CEB	Job	15	18	what the wise have told and have not concealed from their family ,
CEB	Job	15	19	to whom alone the earth was given and no stranger passed in their midst .
CEB	Job	15	20	All the days of the wicked are painful ; the number of years reserved for the hateful ;
CEB	Job	15	21	a sound of terror pierces [ a ] their ears ; when safe , raiders overtake them .
CEB	Job	15	22	They can ’ t count on turning away from darkness ; they are destined for a sword .
CEB	Job	15	23	They wander about for bread . “ Where is it ? ” They know that their day of darkness is fixed .
CEB	Job	15	24	Adversity and stress scare them , master them like a king ready to strike ;
CEB	Job	15	25	for they raise a fist against God and try to overpower the Almighty .
CEB	Job	15	26	They run toward him aggressively , with a massive and strong shield .
CEB	Job	15	27	They cover their face with grease and make their loins gross .
CEB	Job	15	28	They lived in ruined cities , unoccupied houses that turn to rubble .
CEB	Job	15	29	They won ’ t get rich ; their wealth won ’ t last ; their property won ’ t extend over the earth .
CEB	Job	15	30	They can ’ t turn away from darkness ; a flame will dry out their shoots , and they will be taken away by the wind from his mouth .
CEB	Job	15	31	They shouldn ’ t trust in what has no worth , for their reward will be worthless .
CEB	Job	15	32	Before their branch is formed , before it is green ,
CEB	Job	15	33	like the vine , they will drop early grapes and cast off their blossoms like the olive .
CEB	Job	15	34	The ruthless gang is barren , and fire consumes the tents of bribers .
CEB	Job	15	35	They conceive toil and give birth to sorrow ; their belly establishes deceit . Footnotes - Job 15:21 Heb lacks pierces .
CEB	Job	16	16	My face is red from crying , and dark gloom hangs on my eyelids .
CEB	Job	16	2	I ’ ve heard many things like these . All of you are sorry comforters .
CEB	Job	16	3	Will windy talk ever cease ; what bothers you that you must argue ?
CEB	Job	16	4	In your situation I could speak like you ; I could put words together to oppose you , shake my head over you .
CEB	Job	16	5	I could heap up words , strengthen you with my speech ; my trembling lips would be held in check .
CEB	Job	16	6	If I speak , my pain is not eased ; if I hold back , what have I lost ? The innocent are God ’ s targets
CEB	Job	16	7	Now God has surely worn me out . You have destroyed my entire group ,
CEB	Job	16	8	seized me , which became grounds for an accusation . [ a ] My leanness rises to bear witness against me .
CEB	Job	16	9	His anger tears me and afflicts me ; he slashes at me with his teeth . My enemy pierces me with his eyes .
CEB	Job	16	10	They open their mouths at me and strike my cheek in a taunt ; they gang up on me .
CEB	Job	16	11	God delivers me to a criminal and forces me into the hands of the wicked .
CEB	Job	16	12	I was at rest , but he shattered me , seized me by the back of my neck , dashed me into pieces ; he raised me up for his target .
CEB	Job	16	13	His archers surround me ; he cuts my kidneys open without pity and doesn ’ t care , pours my gall on the ground ,
CEB	Job	16	14	bursts me open over and over , runs against me like a strong man .
CEB	Job	16	15	I ’ ve sewed rough cloth over my skin and buried my dignity in the dust .
CEB	Job	16	17	But there is no violence in my hands , and my prayer is pure . Lingering hope
CEB	Job	16	18	Earth , don ’ t cover my blood ; let my outcry never cease .
CEB	Job	16	19	Surely now my witness stands in heaven ; my advocate is on high ;
CEB	Job	16	20	my go-between , my friend . [ b ] While my eyes drip tears to God ,
CEB	Job	16	21	let him plead with God for a human being , like a person pleads for a friend .
CEB	Job	16	22	A number of years will surely pass , and then I ’ ll walk a path that I won ’ t return .
CEB	Job	17	17	My spirit is broken , my days extinguished , the grave , [ a ] mine .
CEB	Job	17	2	Surely mockers are with me , and my eye looks on their rebellion .
CEB	Job	17	3	Take my guarantee . Who else is willing to make an agreement ?
CEB	Job	17	4	You ’ ve closed their mind to insight ; therefore , you won ’ t be exalted .
CEB	Job	17	5	He denounces his friends for gain , and his children ’ s eyes fail .
CEB	Job	17	6	He makes me a popular proverb ; I ’ m like spit in people ’ s faces .
CEB	Job	17	7	My eye is weak from grief ; my limbs like a shadow—all of them .
CEB	Job	17	8	Those who do the right thing are amazed at this ; the guiltless become troubled about the godless .
CEB	Job	17	9	The innocent clings to his way ; the one whose hands are clean grows stronger .
CEB	Job	17	10	But you can bring all of them again , and I won ’ t find a wise one among you .
CEB	Job	17	11	My days have passed ; my goals are destroyed , my heart ’ s desires .
CEB	Job	17	12	They turn night into day ; light is near because of the darkness .
CEB	Job	17	13	If I hope for the underworld [ b ] as my dwelling , lay out my bed in darkness ,
CEB	Job	17	14	I ’ ve called corruption “ my father , ” the worm , “ my mother and sister. ”
CEB	Job	17	15	Where then is my hope ? My hope—who can see it ?
CEB	Job	17	16	Will they go down with me to the underworld ; [ c ] will we descend together to the dust ?
CEB	Job	18	18	They are thrust from light into darkness , banished from the world .
CEB	Job	18	2	How long ? Would you all stop talking . Try to understand and then we can speak .
CEB	Job	18	3	Why are we considered beasts , ignorant in your sight ?
CEB	Job	18	4	To you who tear yourself in rage— will earth be forsaken for your sake , a rock be dislodged from its place ? Evil people ’ s fate
CEB	Job	18	5	To be sure , the light of the wicked goes out ; the blaze of their fire doesn ’ t shine .
CEB	Job	18	6	The light in their tent becomes dark , and their lamp above doesn ’ t shine .
CEB	Job	18	7	Their strong strides slow down ; their plans trip themselves .
CEB	Job	18	8	They are caught by their feet in a net ; they walk on mesh .
CEB	Job	18	9	A trap grabs them by the heel ; a snare tightens on them .
CEB	Job	18	10	A rope is hidden on the ground for them ; a trap for them along the path .
CEB	Job	18	11	Terrors round about scare them ; they follow their steps .
CEB	Job	18	12	Their offspring hunger ; calamity is ready for their spouses .
CEB	Job	18	13	It eats some of their skin . Death ’ s firstborn consumes their limbs .
CEB	Job	18	14	They are snatched from the safety of their tent ; it parades them before the king of terrors .
CEB	Job	18	15	Nothing they own remains in their tent ; sulfur is scattered over their home .
CEB	Job	18	16	Their roots dry out below ; their branches wither above .
CEB	Job	18	17	The memory of them will perish from the earth ; they will achieve no recognition abroad .
CEB	Job	18	19	They have no offspring or descendants among their people , no survivor in their dwelling place .
CEB	Job	18	20	Their successors are appalled at what happens to them ; their predecessors pull their hair .
CEB	Job	18	21	These are surely the dwelling places of the evil ; this is the place of the one who doesn ’ t know God .
CEB	Job	19	19	All my closest friends despise me ; the ones I have loved turn against me . Misery
CEB	Job	19	2	How long will you harass me and crush me with words ?
CEB	Job	19	3	These ten times you ’ ve humiliated me ; shamelessly you insult me .
CEB	Job	19	4	Have I really gone astray ? If so , my error remains hidden inside me .
CEB	Job	19	5	If you look down on me and use my disgrace to criticize me ,
CEB	Job	19	6	know then that God has wronged me and enclosed his net over me . God ’ s treatment of Job
CEB	Job	19	7	If I cry “ Violence ! ” I ’ m not answered ; I shout—but there is no justice .
CEB	Job	19	8	He walled up my path so I can ’ t pass and put darkness on my trail ,
CEB	Job	19	9	stripped my honor from me , removed the crown from my head ,
CEB	Job	19	10	tore me down completely so that I ’ ll die , and uprooted my hope like a tree .
CEB	Job	19	11	His anger burns against me ; he considers me his enemy .
CEB	Job	19	12	His troops come as one and construct their siege ramp [ a ] against me ; they camp around my tent . Social ostracism
CEB	Job	19	13	He has distanced my family from me ; my acquaintances are also alienated from me .
CEB	Job	19	14	My visitors have ceased ; those who know me have forgotten me .
CEB	Job	19	15	My guests and female servants think me a stranger ; I ’ m a foreigner in their sight .
CEB	Job	19	16	I call my servant , and he doesn ’ t answer ; I myself must beg him .
CEB	Job	19	17	My breath stinks to my wife ; I am odious to my children .
CEB	Job	19	18	Even the young despise me ; I get up , and they rail against me .
CEB	Job	19	20	My bones cling to my skin and flesh ; I have escaped by the skin of my teeth .
CEB	Job	19	21	Pity me . Pity me . You ’ re my friends . God ’ s hand has truly struck me .
CEB	Job	19	22	Why do you pursue me like God does , always hungry for my flesh ? Brief hope
CEB	Job	19	23	Oh , that my words were written down , inscribed on a scroll
CEB	Job	19	24	with an iron instrument and lead , forever engraved on stone .
CEB	Job	19	25	But I know that my redeemer [ b ] is alive and afterward he ’ ll rise upon the dust .
CEB	Job	19	26	After my skin has been torn apart this way— then from my flesh [ c ] I ’ ll see God ,
CEB	Job	19	27	whom I ’ ll see myself— my eyes see , [ d ] and not a stranger ’ s . I am utterly dejected . Warning
CEB	Job	19	28	You say , “ How will we pursue him so that the root of the matter can be found in him ? ” [ e ]
CEB	Job	19	29	You ought to fear the sword yourselves , for wrath brings punishment by the sword . You should know that there is judgment .
CEB	Job	20	20	didn ’ t know contentment in their belly ; couldn ’ t escape with their treasure .
CEB	Job	20	2	Therefore , my troubled thoughts make me turn back— because of my inner turmoil .
CEB	Job	20	3	I hear teaching that insults me , but I am forced to answer based on my own understanding . [ a ]
CEB	Job	20	4	Do you know this from long ago— from when humans were placed on earth—
CEB	Job	20	5	that the rejoicing of the wicked is short , the joy of the godless , brief ?
CEB	Job	20	6	Though their height reaches heaven and their heads touch the clouds ,
CEB	Job	20	7	they will perish forever like their dung ; those who saw them will say , “ Where are they ? ”
CEB	Job	20	8	They will disappear like a dream , and none will find them , carried away like a nighttime vision .
CEB	Job	20	9	The eye that saw them will do so no more ; they won ’ t be seen again at home .
CEB	Job	20	10	Their children will repay the poor ; their hands will give back their wealth .
CEB	Job	20	11	Vigor filled their bones and now sleeps with them in the dust .
CEB	Job	20	12	Though wickedness is sweet in their mouths , they hide it under their tongues ;
CEB	Job	20	13	they like it , won ’ t let it go ; they hold it in their cheeks .
CEB	Job	20	14	Food turns their stomachs , becoming a cobra ’ s poison inside .
CEB	Job	20	15	They swallow wealth and vomit it ; God dislodges it from their belly .
CEB	Job	20	16	They suck cobra ’ s poison ; a viper ’ s tongue kills them .
CEB	Job	20	17	They won ’ t experience streams , rivers of honey , and brooks of cream .
CEB	Job	20	18	They won ’ t receive the reward for their labor ; they won ’ t enjoy the wealth from their business .
CEB	Job	20	19	They crushed and abandoned the poor ; stole a house they didn ’ t build ;
CEB	Job	20	21	Nothing remained of their food , so their riches will not endure .
CEB	Job	20	22	Even in their plenty , they are hard-pressed ; all sorts of trouble come on them .
CEB	Job	20	23	Let God [ b ] fill their belly , unleash his burning anger on them , rain punishing blows on them .
CEB	Job	20	24	If they flee an iron weapon , a bronze bow pierces them .
CEB	Job	20	25	They pull it out , but it sticks out from their backs ; its shaft in their liver brings terror .
CEB	Job	20	26	Complete darkness waits for their treasured possessions ; fire that no one stoked consumes them ; what ’ s left in their tent is ruined .
CEB	Job	20	27	Heaven exposes their guilt ; earth opposes them .
CEB	Job	20	28	Their household wealth will be carried off by rushing streams on the day of his anger .
CEB	Job	20	29	This is a wicked person ’ s lot from God , their heritage decreed by God .
CEB	Job	21	21	What do they care about their household after they die , when their numbered days are cut off ? A common fate
CEB	Job	21	2	Listen carefully to my remarks and let that comfort you .
CEB	Job	21	3	Bear with me so I can speak , I myself ; and after my reply you can mock .
CEB	Job	21	4	Are my complaints against another human ; why is my patience short ?
CEB	Job	21	5	Turn to me and be appalled ; lay your hand over your mouth .
CEB	Job	21	6	If I recall it , I ’ m scared ; shaking seizes my body . The success of the wicked
CEB	Job	21	7	Why do the wicked live , grow old , and even become strong ?
CEB	Job	21	8	Their children are always with them , their offspring in their sight ,
CEB	Job	21	9	their houses safe from dread , God ’ s punishing stick not upon them .
CEB	Job	21	10	Their bull always breeds successfully ; their cows give birth and never miscarry .
CEB	Job	21	11	They send forth their little ones like sheep ; their infants bounce around .
CEB	Job	21	12	They raise drum and lyre , rejoice at the sound of a flute .
CEB	Job	21	13	They spend their days contentedly , go down to the grave [ a ] peacefully .
CEB	Job	21	14	They say to God , “ Turn away from us ; we take no pleasure in knowing your ways ;
CEB	Job	21	15	who is the Almighty [ b ] that we should serve him , and what can we gain if we meet him ? ”
CEB	Job	21	16	Look , isn ’ t their well-being the work of their own hands ? A sinner ’ s logic is beyond me . Desired vindication
CEB	Job	21	17	How often does the lamp of the wicked flicker or disaster come upon them , with its fury inflicting pain on them ?
CEB	Job	21	18	Let them be like straw in the wind , like dry grass stolen by a storm .
CEB	Job	21	19	God stores up his punishment for his children . Let him destroy them so they know .
CEB	Job	21	20	Let their own eyes witness their doom . Let them drink from the Almighty ’ s wrath .
CEB	Job	21	22	Will they instruct God— he who judges the most powerful ?
CEB	Job	21	23	Someone dies in wonderful health , completely comfortable and well ,
CEB	Job	21	24	their buckets full of milk , their bones marrow-filled and sound .
CEB	Job	21	25	Another dies in bitter spirit , never having tasted the good things .
CEB	Job	21	26	They lie together in the dust and worms cover them . Further disagreement
CEB	Job	21	27	Look , I know your thoughts ; your plans harm me .
CEB	Job	21	28	You say , “ Where is the official ’ s house ? Where is the tent , the dwelling of the wicked ? ”
CEB	Job	21	29	Haven ’ t you asked travelers or paid attention to their reports ?
CEB	Job	21	30	On the day of disaster the wicked are spared ; on the day of fury they are rescued .
CEB	Job	21	31	Who can criticize their behavior to their faces ; they act , and who can avenge them ?
CEB	Job	21	32	They are carried to their graves ; someone keeps guard over their tombs .
CEB	Job	21	33	The soil near the desert streambed is sweet to them ; everyone marches after them— those before them , beyond counting .
CEB	Job	21	34	How empty is your comfort to me ; only deceit remains in your responses .
CEB	Job	22	22	Receive instruction from his mouth ; put his words in your mind .
CEB	Job	22	2	Can a human being be useful to God ? Can an intelligent person bring profit ?
CEB	Job	22	3	Does the Almighty delight in your innocence ? Does he gain when you perfect your ways ?
CEB	Job	22	4	Does he rebuke you for your piety , bring you in for judgment ?
CEB	Job	22	5	Isn ’ t your wickedness massive , your iniquity endless ?
CEB	Job	22	6	You have taken payments from your family for no reason ; stripped the naked , leaving no clothes ;
CEB	Job	22	7	denied water to the thirsty , withheld bread from the starving . (
CEB	Job	22	8	The powerful own land ; the favored live in it . )
CEB	Job	22	9	You have sent widows away empty ; crushed orphans ’ resources .
CEB	Job	22	10	For this reason , snares surround you ; sudden dread brings panic to you
CEB	Job	22	11	or a darkness that you can ’ t see ; rushing water will cover you . God ’ s activity
CEB	Job	22	12	Isn ’ t God in the heights of heaven ; see how high the topmost stars are ?
CEB	Job	22	13	You say : “ What does God know ? Can he judge through thick clouds ?
CEB	Job	22	14	Clouds conceal him so he can ’ t see while he walks on heaven ’ s rim. ”
CEB	Job	22	15	Will you keep the ancient way traveled by sinful persons ,
CEB	Job	22	16	who were snatched prematurely when a river flooded their foundations ,
CEB	Job	22	17	who say to God , “ Turn away from us ; what can the Almighty do to us ? ”
CEB	Job	22	18	Yet he filled their houses with good things ; a sinner ’ s logic is beyond me .
CEB	Job	22	19	The righteous see and rejoice ; the innocent mock them :
CEB	Job	22	20	our enemies are certainly cut off ; fire will devour what ’ s left of them . Turn to God
CEB	Job	22	21	Get along well with God and be at peace ; from this something good will come to you .
CEB	Job	22	23	If you return to the Almighty , [ a ] you will be restored ; if you keep wrongdoing out of your tent .
CEB	Job	22	24	Lay your prized possession in the dust , your gold from Ophir on a rock in a desert streambed .
CEB	Job	22	25	The Almighty will be your prized possession , silver piled up for you .
CEB	Job	22	26	Then you will take pleasure in the Almighty ; lift up your face to God .
CEB	Job	22	27	You will pray to him , and he will hear you ; you will fulfill your solemn promises .
CEB	Job	22	28	If you decree something , it will stand ; light will shine on your ways .
CEB	Job	22	29	When they ’ re humbled , you will say : “ Cheer up ; God will rescue the lowly .
CEB	Job	22	30	He will deliver the guilty ; they will be saved by your pure hands . ”
CEB	Job	23	23	Job answered :
CEB	Job	23	2	Today my complaint is again bitter ; [ a ] my strength is weighed down because of my groaning .
CEB	Job	23	3	Oh , that I could know how to find him— come to his dwelling place ;
CEB	Job	23	4	I would lay out my case before him , fill my mouth with arguments ,
CEB	Job	23	5	know the words with which he would answer , understand what he would say to me .
CEB	Job	23	6	Would he contend with me through brute force ? No , he would surely listen to me .
CEB	Job	23	7	There those who do the right thing can argue with him ; I could escape from my judge forever . God ’ s hiddenness
CEB	Job	23	8	Look , I go east ; he ’ s not there , west , and don ’ t discover him ;
CEB	Job	23	9	north in his activity , and I don ’ t grasp him ; he turns south , and I don ’ t see .
CEB	Job	23	10	Surely he knows my way ; when he tests me , I will emerge as gold .
CEB	Job	23	11	My feet have stayed right in his tracks . I have kept his way and not left it ,
CEB	Job	23	12	kept the commandments from his lips and not departed , valued the words from his mouth more than my food . Dread
CEB	Job	23	13	He is of one mind ; who can reverse it ? What he desires , he does .
CEB	Job	23	14	He carries out what is decreed for me and can do many similar things with me .
CEB	Job	23	15	Therefore , I am scared by his presence ; I think and become afraid of him .
CEB	Job	23	16	God has weakened my mind ; the Almighty has frightened me .
CEB	Job	23	17	Still I ’ m not annihilated by darkness ; he has hidden deep darkness from me . Footnotes - Job 23:2 Vulg , Syr , Tg ; MT my complaint is rebellious .
CEB	Job	24	24	They are exalted for a short time , but no longer . They are humbled then gathered in like everyone else ; cut off like heads of grain .
CEB	Job	24	2	People move boundary stones , herd flocks they ’ ve stolen ,
CEB	Job	24	3	drive off an orphan ’ s donkey , take a widow ’ s ox as collateral ,
CEB	Job	24	4	thrust the poor out of the way , make the land ’ s needy hide together .
CEB	Job	24	5	They are like the wild donkeys in the desert ; they go forth at dawn searching for prey ; the wasteland is food for their young .
CEB	Job	24	6	They gather their food in the field , glean in unproductive vineyards ,
CEB	Job	24	7	spend the night naked , unclothed , in the cold without a cover ,
CEB	Job	24	8	wet from mountain rains , with no refuge , huddled against a rock .
CEB	Job	24	9	The orphan is stolen from the breast ; the infant [ b ] of the poor is taken as collateral .
CEB	Job	24	10	The poor go around naked , without clothes , carry bundles of grain while hungry ,
CEB	Job	24	11	crush olives between millstones , [ c ] tread winepresses , but remain thirsty .
CEB	Job	24	12	From the city , the dying cry out ; the throat of the mortally wounded screams , but God assigns no blame . Sinners ’ conduct
CEB	Job	24	13	They rebel against light , don ’ t acknowledge its direction , don ’ t dwell in its paths .
CEB	Job	24	14	The murderer rises at twilight , kills the poor and needy ; at night , they are like a thief .
CEB	Job	24	15	The adulterer ’ s eye watches for twilight , thinking , No eye can see me , and puts a mask over his face .
CEB	Job	24	16	In the dark they break into houses ; they shut themselves in by day ; they don ’ t know the light .
CEB	Job	24	17	Deep darkness is morning to them because they recognize the horror of darkness .
CEB	Job	24	18	They are scum on the water ’ s surface ; their portion of the land is cursed ; no one walks down a path in the vineyards .
CEB	Job	24	19	Drought and heat steal melted snow , just as the underworld [ d ] steals sinners .
CEB	Job	24	20	The womb forgets them ; the worm consumes them ; they aren ’ t remembered , and so wickedness is shattered like a tree .
CEB	Job	24	21	They prey on the barren , the childless , do nothing good for the widow .
CEB	Job	24	22	They drag away the strong by force ; they may get up but without guarantee of survival .
CEB	Job	24	23	They make themselves secure ; they are at ease . His [ e ] eyes are on their ways .
CEB	Job	24	25	If this isn ’ t so , who can prove me a liar and make my words disappear ?
CEB	Job	25	25	Bildad from Shuah replied :
CEB	Job	25	2	Supreme power and awe belong to God ; he establishes peace on his heights .
CEB	Job	25	3	Can his troops be counted ? On whom does his light not rise ?
CEB	Job	25	4	How can a person be innocent before God ; one born of a woman be pure ?
CEB	Job	25	5	If even the moon is not bright and the stars not pure in his eyes ,
CEB	Job	25	6	how much less a human , a worm , a person ’ s child , a grub .

CEB	Job	26	26	Then Job said :
CEB	Job	26	2	How well you have helped the weak , saved those with frail arms ,
CEB	Job	26	3	advised one lacking wisdom , informed many with insight !
CEB	Job	26	4	With whom have you spoken ; [ a ] whose breath was expelled from you ? Truth about God
CEB	Job	26	5	The dead writhe , the inhabitants beneath the waters as well .
CEB	Job	26	6	The grave [ b ] is naked before God ; the underworld [ c ] lacks covering .
CEB	Job	26	7	He stretched the North [ d ] over chaos , hung earth over nothing ;
CEB	Job	26	8	wrapped up water in his clouds , yet they didn ’ t burst out below ;
CEB	Job	26	9	hid the face of the full moon , [ e ] spreading his cloud over it ;
CEB	Job	26	10	traced a circle on the water ’ s surface , at the limit of light and darkness .
CEB	Job	26	11	Heaven ’ s pillars shook , terrified by his blast .
CEB	Job	26	12	By his power he stilled the Sea ; split Rahab with his cleverness .
CEB	Job	26	13	Due to his wind , heaven became clear ; his hand split the fleeing serpent .
CEB	Job	26	14	Look , these are only the outer fringe of his ways ; we hear only a whispered word about him . Who can understand his thunderous power ?
CEB	Job	27	27	Then Job took up his topic again :
CEB	Job	27	2	As God lives , who rejected my legal claim , the Almighty , who made me bitter ,
CEB	Job	27	3	as long as breath is in me and God ’ s breath is in my nostrils—
CEB	Job	27	4	my lips will utter no wickedness ; my tongue will mumble no deceit .
CEB	Job	27	5	I will not agree that you are right . Until my dying day , I won ’ t give up my integrity .
CEB	Job	27	6	I will insist on my innocence , never surrendering it ; my conscience will never blame me for what I have done . [ a ] Job curses his enemies
CEB	Job	27	7	Let my enemy be like the wicked , my opposition like the vicious .
CEB	Job	27	8	For what hope has the godless when God cuts them off , when he takes them away .
CEB	Job	27	9	Will God hear their cries when distress comes to them ;
CEB	Job	27	10	will they delight in the Almighty , call God at any time ? Job ’ s view of his enemies ’ fate
CEB	Job	27	11	I will teach you God ’ s power , not hide what pertains to the Almighty .
CEB	Job	27	12	Look , those of you who recognize this— why then this empty talk ?
CEB	Job	27	13	This is the wicked ’ s portion with God , the inheritance that the ruthless receive from the Almighty .
CEB	Job	27	14	If their children increase , they belong to the sword ; their offspring won ’ t have enough bread .
CEB	Job	27	15	Their survivors will be buried with the dead ; their widows won ’ t weep .
CEB	Job	27	16	If they store up silver like dust , amass clothing like clay ,
CEB	Job	27	17	they may amass , but the righteous will wear it ; the innocent will divide the silver .
CEB	Job	27	18	They built their houses like nests , like a hut made by a watchman .
CEB	Job	27	19	They lie down rich , but no longer ; open their eyes , but it ’ s missing .
CEB	Job	27	20	Terrors overtake them like waters ; a tempest snatches them by night ;
CEB	Job	27	21	an east wind lifts them , and they are gone , removes them from their places ,
CEB	Job	27	22	throws itself on them without mercy ; they flee desperately from its force .
CEB	Job	27	23	It claps its hands over them , hisses at them from their place . Footnotes - Job 27:6 Or for my days
CEB	Job	28	28	and said to humankind : “ Look , the fear of the Lord is wisdom ; turning from evil is understanding . ”
CEB	Job	28	2	Iron is taken from the earth ; rock is smelted into copper .
CEB	Job	28	3	Humans [ a ] put an end to darkness , dig for ore to the farthest depths , into stone in utter darkness ,
CEB	Job	28	4	open a shaft away from any inhabitant , places forgotten by those on foot , apart from any human they hang and sway .
CEB	Job	28	5	Earth—from it comes food— is turned over below ground as by fire . [ b ]
CEB	Job	28	6	Its rocks are the source for lapis lazuli ; there is gold dust in it .
CEB	Job	28	7	A path— no bird of prey knows it ; a hawk ’ s eye hasn ’ t seen it ;
CEB	Job	28	8	proud beasts haven ’ t trodden on it ; a lion hasn ’ t crossed over it .
CEB	Job	28	9	Humans thrust their hands into flint , pull up mountains from their roots ,
CEB	Job	28	10	cut channels into rocks ; their eyes see everything precious .
CEB	Job	28	11	They dam up the sources of rivers ; hidden things come to light . Wisdom ’ s value
CEB	Job	28	12	But wisdom , where can it be found ; where is the place of understanding ?
CEB	Job	28	13	Humankind doesn ’ t know its value ; it isn ’ t found in the land of the living .
CEB	Job	28	14	The Deep [ c ] says , “ It ’ s not with me ” ; the Sea [ d ] says , “ Not alongside me ! ”
CEB	Job	28	15	It can ’ t be bought with gold ; its price can ’ t be measured in silver ,
CEB	Job	28	16	can ’ t be weighed against gold from Ophir , with precious onyx or lapis lazuli .
CEB	Job	28	17	Neither gold nor glass can compare with it ; she can ’ t be acquired with gold jewelry .
CEB	Job	28	18	Coral and jasper shouldn ’ t be mentioned ; the price of wisdom is more than rubies .
CEB	Job	28	19	Cushite topaz won ’ t compare with her ; she can ’ t be set alongside pure gold .
CEB	Job	28	20	But wisdom , where does she come from ? Where is the place of understanding ?
CEB	Job	28	21	She ’ s hidden from the eyes of all the living , concealed from birds of the sky .
CEB	Job	28	22	Destruction [ e ] and Death have said , “ We ’ ve heard a report of her. ”
CEB	Job	28	23	God understands her way ; he knows her place ;
CEB	Job	28	24	for he looks to the ends of the earth and surveys everything beneath the heavens .
CEB	Job	28	25	In order to weigh the wind , to prepare a measure for waters ,
CEB	Job	28	26	when he made a decree for the rain , a path for thunderbolts ,
CEB	Job	28	27	then he observed it , spoke of it , established it , searched it out ,
CEB	Job	29	29	Job took up his subject again :
CEB	Job	29	2	Oh , that life was like it used to be , like days when God watched over me ;
CEB	Job	29	3	when his lamp shone on my head , I walked by his light in the dark ;
CEB	Job	29	4	when I was in my prime ; when God ’ s counsel was in my tent ;
CEB	Job	29	5	when the Almighty was with me , my children around me ;
CEB	Job	29	6	when my steps were washed with cream and a rock poured out pools of oil for me . Previous honor
CEB	Job	29	7	When I went out to the city gate , took my seat in the square ,
CEB	Job	29	8	the young saw me and drew back ; the old rose and stood ;
CEB	Job	29	9	princes restrained speech , put their hand on their mouth ;
CEB	Job	29	10	the voices of officials were hushed , their tongue stuck to their palate . Job ’ s implementation of justice
CEB	Job	29	11	Indeed , the ear that heard blessed me ; the eye that looked commended me ,
CEB	Job	29	12	because I rescued the weak who cried out , the orphans who lacked help .
CEB	Job	29	13	The blessing of the perishing reached me ; I made the widow ’ s heart sing ;
CEB	Job	29	14	I put on justice , and it clothed me , righteousness as my coat and turban ;
CEB	Job	29	15	I was eyes to the blind , feet to the lame .
CEB	Job	29	16	I was a father to the needy ; the case I didn ’ t know , I examined .
CEB	Job	29	17	I shattered the fangs of the wicked , rescued prey from their teeth . Job ’ s expected blessing
CEB	Job	29	18	I thought , I ’ ll die in my nest , multiply days like sand , [ a ]
CEB	Job	29	19	my roots opening to water , dew lingering on my branches ,
CEB	Job	29	20	my honor newly with me , my bow ever successful in my hand . Previous honor
CEB	Job	29	21	People listened to me and waited , were silent for my advice .
CEB	Job	29	22	After my speech , they didn ’ t respond . My words fell gently on them ;
CEB	Job	29	23	they waited for me as for rain , opened their mouth as for spring rain .
CEB	Job	29	24	I smiled [ b ] on them ; they couldn ’ t believe it . They never showed me disfavor .
CEB	Job	29	25	I decided their path , sat as chief . I lived like a king with his troops , like one who comforts mourners .
CEB	Job	30	30	My skin is charred ; my bones are scorched by the heat .
CEB	Job	30	2	Their strength , what ’ s it to me , their energy having perished ?
CEB	Job	30	3	Stiff from want and hunger , those who gnaw dry ground , yesterday ’ s desolate waste ,
CEB	Job	30	4	who pluck off the leaves on a bush , the root of the broom— a shrub is their food .
CEB	Job	30	5	People banish them from society , shout at them as if to a thief ;
CEB	Job	30	6	so they live in scary ravines , holes in the ground and rocks .
CEB	Job	30	7	Among shrubs , they make sounds like donkeys ; they are huddled together under a bush ,
CEB	Job	30	8	children of fools and the nameless , whipped out of the land . Specific mocking behavior
CEB	Job	30	9	And now I ’ m their song ; I ’ m their cliché !
CEB	Job	30	10	They detest me , keep their distance , don ’ t withhold spit from my face .
CEB	Job	30	11	Because he loosened my bowstring and afflicted me , they throw off restraint in my presence .
CEB	Job	30	12	On the right , upstarts [ a ] rise and target my feet , build their siege ramps against me ,
CEB	Job	30	13	destroy my road , profit from my fall , with no help .
CEB	Job	30	14	They advance as if through a destroyed wall ; [ b ] they roll along beneath the ruin .
CEB	Job	30	15	Terrors crash upon me ; they sweep away my honor like wind ; my safety disappears like a cloud . Accusation against God
CEB	Job	30	16	Now my life is poured out on me ; days of misery have seized me .
CEB	Job	30	17	At night he bores my bones ; my gnawing pain won ’ t rest .
CEB	Job	30	18	With great force he grasps [ c ] my clothing ; [ d ] it binds me like the neck of my shirt .
CEB	Job	30	19	He hurls me into mud ; I ’ m a cliché , like dust and ashes .
CEB	Job	30	20	I cry to you , and you don ’ t answer ; I stand up , but you just look at me .
CEB	Job	30	21	You are cruel to me , attack me with the strength of your hand .
CEB	Job	30	22	You lift me to the wind and make me ride ; you melt me in its roar .
CEB	Job	30	23	I know you will return me to death , the house appointed for all the living . Job ’ s agony
CEB	Job	30	24	Surely he won ’ t strike someone in ruins if in distress he cries out to him ,
CEB	Job	30	25	if I didn ’ t weep for those who have a difficult day or my soul grieve for the needy ;
CEB	Job	30	26	for I awaited good , but evil came ; I expected light , but gloom arrived .
CEB	Job	30	27	My insides , churning , are never quiet ; days of affliction confront me .
CEB	Job	30	28	I walk in the dark , lacking sunshine ; I rise in the assembly and cry out .
CEB	Job	30	29	I have become a brother to jackals , a companion to young ostriches .
CEB	Job	30	31	My lyre is for mourning , my flute , a weeping sound .
CEB	Job	31	31	Surely those in my tent never said : “ Who has been filled by Job ’ s food ? ”
CEB	Job	31	2	What is God ’ s portion for me [ a ] from above , the Almighty ’ s inheritance from on high ?
CEB	Job	31	3	Isn ’ t it disaster for the wicked , destruction for workers of iniquity ?
CEB	Job	31	4	Doesn ’ t he see my ways , count all my steps ? Deceit
CEB	Job	31	5	If I have walked with frauds or my feet have hurried to deceit ,
CEB	Job	31	6	let him weigh me on accurate scales ; let God know my integrity .
CEB	Job	31	7	If my step has turned from the way , if my heart has followed my eyes or a blemish has clung to my hands ,
CEB	Job	31	8	then let me sow and another reap ; let my offspring be uprooted . Adultery
CEB	Job	31	9	If my heart has been drawn to a woman and I have lurked at my neighbor ’ s door ,
CEB	Job	31	10	then may my wife grind for another and others kneel over her ;
CEB	Job	31	11	for that ’ s a crime ; it ’ s a punishable offense ;
CEB	Job	31	12	indeed , it ’ s a fire that consumes to the underworld , [ b ] uprooting all my harvest . Slaves
CEB	Job	31	13	If I ’ ve rejected the just cause of my male or female servant when they contended with me ,
CEB	Job	31	14	what could I do when God rises ; when he requires an account , what could I answer ?
CEB	Job	31	15	Didn ’ t the one who made me in the belly make them ; didn ’ t the same one fashion us in the womb ? The defenseless
CEB	Job	31	16	If I have denied what the poor wanted , made a widow ’ s eyes tired ,
CEB	Job	31	17	eaten my morsel alone , and not shared any with an orphan (
CEB	Job	31	18	for from my youth I raised the orphan as a father , and from my mother ’ s womb I led the widow ) ; [ c ]
CEB	Job	31	19	if I ever saw someone dying without clothes , the needy naked ;
CEB	Job	31	20	if they haven ’ t blessed me fervently , [ d ] or if they weren ’ t warmed by the wool from my sheep ;
CEB	Job	31	21	if I have lifted my hand against the orphans , when I saw that I had help in the city gate—
CEB	Job	31	22	may my arm fall from my shoulder , my forearm be broken at the elbow—
CEB	Job	31	23	for God ’ s calamity is terror to me ; I couldn ’ t endure his splendor . False worship
CEB	Job	31	24	If I ’ ve made gold my trust , said to fine gold : “ My security ! ”
CEB	Job	31	25	if I ’ ve rejoiced because my wealth was great , when my hand found plenty ;
CEB	Job	31	26	if I ’ ve looked at the sun when it shone , the moon , splendid as it moved ;
CEB	Job	31	27	and my mind has been secretly enticed , and threw a kiss with my hand ,
CEB	Job	31	28	that also is a punishable offense , because I would then be disloyal to God above . Others ' misfortune
CEB	Job	31	29	If I have rejoiced over my foes ’ ruin or was excited when evil found them ,
CEB	Job	31	30	I didn ’ t let my mouth sin by asking for their life with a curse .
CEB	Job	31	32	A stranger didn ’ t spend the night in the street ; I opened my doors to the road . Concealing sin
CEB	Job	31	33	If I have hidden my transgressions like Adam , [ e ] concealing my offenses inside me
CEB	Job	31	34	because I feared the large crowd ; the clan ’ s contempt frightened me ; I was quiet and didn ’ t venture outside . Sealing the solemn pledge
CEB	Job	31	35	Oh , that I had someone to hear me ! Here ’ s my signature ; [ f ] let the Almighty respond , and let my accuser write an indictment .
CEB	Job	31	36	Surely I would bear it on my shoulder , tie it around me like a wreath .
CEB	Job	31	37	I would give him an account of my steps , approach him like a prince . Abuse of the land
CEB	Job	31	38	If my land has cried out against me , its rows wept together ;
CEB	Job	31	39	if I have eaten its yield without payment and caused its owners grief ,
CEB	Job	31	40	may briars grow instead of wheat , poisonous weeds instead of barley . Job ’ s words are complete .
CEB	Job	32	32	These three men stopped answering Job because he thought he was righteous . [ a ]
CEB	Job	32	2	Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite from the clan of Ram was angry , angry with Job because he considered himself more righteous than God .
CEB	Job	32	3	He was also angry with his three friends because they hadn ’ t found an answer but nevertheless thought Job wicked .
CEB	Job	32	4	Elihu had waited while Job spoke , for they were older than he .
CEB	Job	32	5	When Elihu saw that there had been no response in the speeches of the three men , he became very angry . Elihu ’ s justification for speaking
CEB	Job	32	6	Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite said : I ’ m young and you ’ re old , so I held back , afraid to express my opinion to you .
CEB	Job	32	7	I thought , Let days speak ; let multiple years make wisdom known .
CEB	Job	32	8	But the spirit in a person , the Almighty ’ s breath , gives understanding .
CEB	Job	32	9	The advanced in days aren ’ t wise ; the old don ’ t understand what ’ s right .
CEB	Job	32	10	Therefore , I say : “ Listen to me ; I ’ ll state my view , even I. ”
CEB	Job	32	11	Look , I waited while you spoke , listened while you reasoned , while you searched for words .
CEB	Job	32	12	I was attentive to you , but you offered no rebuke to Job , no answer from you for his words .
CEB	Job	32	13	Be careful you don ’ t say , “ We ’ ve found wisdom ; God , not a person , will defeat him. ”
CEB	Job	32	14	Now Job [ b ] hasn ’ t addressed me , and I won ’ t quote you to him .
CEB	Job	32	15	They are troubled , no longer answer ; words now escape them .
CEB	Job	32	16	I waited , but they didn ’ t speak , for they stood but answered no more .
CEB	Job	32	17	I will answer . Indeed , I will state [ c ] my piece ; I too will declare my view ,
CEB	Job	32	18	for I ’ m full of words . The spirit in my belly compels me .
CEB	Job	32	19	Look , my belly is like unopened wine ; like new wineskins it will burst .
CEB	Job	32	20	I will speak and get relief ; I will open my lips and respond .
CEB	Job	32	21	I won ’ t be partial to anyone , won ’ t flatter a person ;
CEB	Job	32	22	for I don ’ t know flattery ; otherwise my maker would quickly whisk me away .
CEB	Job	33	33	If not , you must hear me ; be quiet , and I will teach you wisdom .
CEB	Job	33	2	Notice that I am opening my mouth ; my tongue is speaking in my mouth . [ a ]
CEB	Job	33	3	My words come from a virtuous heart ; my lips speak knowledge clearly .
CEB	Job	33	4	God ’ s spirit made me ; the Almighty ’ s breath enlivens me .
CEB	Job	33	5	If you are able , answer me ; lay out your case [ b ] before me and take a stand .
CEB	Job	33	6	Notice that I ’ m just like you to God ; I also was pinched from clay .
CEB	Job	33	7	Surely fear of me shouldn ’ t scare you ; my pressure on you shouldn ’ t be heavy . The argument
CEB	Job	33	8	You certainly said in my hearing ; I heard the sound of your words :
CEB	Job	33	9	“ I ’ m pure , without sin ; I ’ m innocent , without offense .
CEB	Job	33	10	Notice that he invents arguments against me ; he considers me his enemy ,
CEB	Job	33	11	ties up my feet , watches all my paths. ”
CEB	Job	33	12	Now you ’ re wrong about this ; I ’ ll answer you , for God is greater than anybody .
CEB	Job	33	13	Why do you contend with him , saying that he doesn ’ t answer all your words ? [ c ]
CEB	Job	33	14	God speaks in one way , in two ways , but no one perceives it .
CEB	Job	33	15	In the dream , a vision of the night , when deep sleep falls upon humans , during their slumber on a bed ,
CEB	Job	33	16	then he opens people ’ s ears , scares them with warnings ,
CEB	Job	33	17	to turn them from a deed and to smother human pride .
CEB	Job	33	18	He keeps one from the pit , a life from perishing by the sword .
CEB	Job	33	19	Or a person may be disciplined by pain while in bed , bones ever aching
CEB	Job	33	20	until a person loathes food , an appetite rejects a delicacy ;
CEB	Job	33	21	the flesh wastes away , no longer visible ; the bones , once hidden , protrude .
CEB	Job	33	22	A life approaches the pit ; its very being draws near the death dealers .
CEB	Job	33	23	Surely there ’ s a messenger for this person , a mediator , one out of a thousand to declare one ’ s integrity to another
CEB	Job	33	24	so that God has compassion on that person and says , “ Rescue this one from going down to the pit ; I have found a ransom. ”
CEB	Job	33	25	That person ’ s flesh is renewed like a child ’ s ; they regain their youth .
CEB	Job	33	26	They pray to God , and God is pleased with them ; they behold God ’ s presence with a joyful shout . God rewards a person ’ s righteousness .
CEB	Job	33	27	They sing before people and say : “ I have sinned , perverted justice , but didn ’ t experience the consequences .
CEB	Job	33	28	He ransomed me from crossing into the pit ; my life beholds light. ”
CEB	Job	33	29	Look , God does all this , twice , three times with persons
CEB	Job	33	30	to bring them back from the pit , to shine with life ’ s light .
CEB	Job	33	31	Listen , Job ; hear me ; be quiet , and I will speak .
CEB	Job	33	32	If you have words , answer me ; speak , for I want to be innocent .
CEB	Job	34	34	Smart people say to me , the wise who hear me ,
CEB	Job	34	2	Hear my words , wise ones ; knowledgeable ones , listen to me ,
CEB	Job	34	3	for the ear tests words like the palate tastes food .
CEB	Job	34	4	Let ’ s choose for us what ’ s right ; let ’ s determine among ourselves what ’ s good ;
CEB	Job	34	5	for Job has said , “ I ’ m innocent ; God has denied my just cause ;
CEB	Job	34	6	because of my cause I ’ m thought a liar ; my wound from an arrow is incurable , even though I didn ’ t rebel. ”
CEB	Job	34	7	Who is a man like Job ? He drinks mockery like water
CEB	Job	34	8	and travels a path with wrongdoers , walking with evil persons .
CEB	Job	34	9	Indeed he said , “ No one is rewarded for delighting in God. ”
CEB	Job	34	10	Therefore , intelligent ones , hear me ; far be it from God to do evil and the Almighty to sin ,
CEB	Job	34	11	for he repays people based on what they do , paying back everyone according to their ways .
CEB	Job	34	12	Surely God doesn ’ t act wickedly ; the Almighty doesn ’ t distort justice .
CEB	Job	34	13	Who placed earth in his care , and who gave him dominion over the entire world ?
CEB	Job	34	14	If he were to decide to do it— to gather his spirit and breath back to himself—
CEB	Job	34	15	all flesh would die together , and humans would return to dust .
CEB	Job	34	16	But if you have understanding , hear this ; pay attention to the sound of my words .
CEB	Job	34	17	Will one who hates justice rule ; will you condemn the most righteous one ?
CEB	Job	34	18	Will you say to a king , “ Worthless ! ” to royalty , “ Evil ! ”
CEB	Job	34	19	Who shows no favor to princes nor regards the rich over the poor , for they are all the work of God ’ s hands ?
CEB	Job	34	20	In the middle of the night they suddenly die ; people are shaken and pass away . The mighty are removed , not by a human hand .
CEB	Job	34	21	God ’ s eyes are on human ways , and he sees all their steps .
CEB	Job	34	22	There ’ s no darkness , no deep darkness , where evildoers can hide themselves ;
CEB	Job	34	23	surely no time is set for a person to appear before God in judgment .
CEB	Job	34	24	He shatters the mighty without examining them ; makes others take their place .
CEB	Job	34	25	Thus he regards their deeds , overturns them at night , and they are crushed .
CEB	Job	34	26	He strikes them because of their wickedness at a place where people can see it .
CEB	Job	34	27	Because they turned from following him and didn ’ t value all his ways ,
CEB	Job	34	28	causing the cry of the poor to reach him , he hears the cry of the afflicted .
CEB	Job	34	29	Still , if he remains quiet , who can condemn ; if he hides his face , who can see him ?
CEB	Job	34	30	He prevents a lawless person from ruling , from capturing people .
CEB	Job	34	31	Has Job said to God , “ I have borne punishment ; I won ’ t sin again ?
CEB	Job	34	32	You teach me what I can ’ t see ; if I ’ ve sinned , I won ’ t do it again. ”
CEB	Job	34	33	Will he repay you because you reject sin , for you must choose , not I ; declare what you know .
CEB	Job	34	35	“ Job speaks without knowledge ; his words aren ’ t astute. ”
CEB	Job	34	36	I wish Job would be tested to the limit because he responds like evil people .
CEB	Job	34	37	He adds rebellion to his sin ; mocks us openly and adds to his words against God .
CEB	Job	35	35	Elihu continued :
CEB	Job	35	2	Do you think it right ? You say , “ I ’ m more just than God. ”
CEB	Job	35	3	Yet you ask , “ What does it benefit you ? What have I gained by avoiding sin ? ”
CEB	Job	35	4	I ’ ll answer you , and your friends along with you .
CEB	Job	35	5	Look at the heavens and see ; scan the clouds high over you .
CEB	Job	35	6	If you ’ ve sinned , how have you affected God ? Your offenses have multiplied ; what have you done to him ?
CEB	Job	35	7	If you are righteous , what do you give to him ? Or what does he receive from your hand ?
CEB	Job	35	8	Your evil affects others like you , and your righteousness affects fellow human beings .
CEB	Job	35	9	People cry out because of heavy oppression ; shout under the power of the mighty .
CEB	Job	35	10	But no one says , “ Where is God my maker ; who gives songs in the night ;
CEB	Job	35	11	who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth , makes us wiser than the birds in the sky ? ”
CEB	Job	35	12	Then they cry out ; but he doesn ’ t answer , because of the pride of the wicked .
CEB	Job	35	13	God certainly doesn ’ t respond to a deceitful cry ; the Almighty doesn ’ t pay attention to it .
CEB	Job	35	14	Although you say that you don ’ t see him , the case is before him ; so wait anxiously for him .
CEB	Job	35	15	Even though his anger is now held back , a person doesn ’ t know it ’ s only delayed . [ a ]
CEB	Job	35	16	So Job mouths emptiness ; he piles up ignorant words . Footnotes - Job 35:15 Heb uncertain
CEB	Job	36	36	Continuing , Elihu said ,
CEB	Job	36	2	Wait a little while so I can demonstrate for you that there is still something more to say about God .
CEB	Job	36	3	I will draw from my broad knowledge , attribute justice to my maker .
CEB	Job	36	4	My words are certainly truthful ; one with total knowledge is present with you . Divine discipline
CEB	Job	36	5	Look , God is mighty and doesn ’ t reject anyone ; he is mighty in strength and mind .
CEB	Job	36	6	He doesn ’ t let the wicked live , but grants justice to the poor .
CEB	Job	36	7	He doesn ’ t avert his eyes from the righteous ; he seats kings on thrones forever , and they are lifted up .
CEB	Job	36	8	If they are tied with ropes , caught in cords of affliction ,
CEB	Job	36	9	he informs them about their offenses and their grave sins .
CEB	Job	36	10	He opens their ears with discipline and commands them to turn from wrong .
CEB	Job	36	11	If they listen and serve , they spend their days in plenty , their years contentedly .
CEB	Job	36	12	But if they don ’ t listen , they perish by the sword , breathe their last without understanding .
CEB	Job	36	13	Those with impious hearts become furious ; they don ’ t cry out even though he binds them .
CEB	Job	36	14	They die young ; they are among the holy ones .
CEB	Job	36	15	He saves the weak in their affliction , opens their ears through oppression .
CEB	Job	36	16	Surely he draws you up from the brink of trouble to a wide place without distress ; your table is set with rich food .
CEB	Job	36	17	You are overly concerned about the case of the wicked ; justice will be upheld in it .
CEB	Job	36	18	Don ’ t let them lure you with wealth ; don ’ t let a huge bribe mislead you .
CEB	Job	36	19	Will he arrange your rescue from distress or from all your exertions of strength ?
CEB	Job	36	20	Don ’ t wish for the night when people vanish from their place .
CEB	Job	36	21	Take care ; don ’ t turn to evil because you ’ ve chosen it over affliction .
CEB	Job	36	22	Look , God is inaccessible due to his power ; who is a teacher like him ?
CEB	Job	36	23	Who has repaid him for his action , and who would ever say , “ You ’ ve done wrong ” ?
CEB	Job	36	24	Remember to praise his work that all of us have seen .
CEB	Job	36	25	Every person has seen him ; people can observe at great distance . God ’ s control of the storm
CEB	Job	36	26	Look , God is exalted and unknowable ; the number of his years is beyond counting .
CEB	Job	36	27	He draws up drops of water that distill rain from his flood ;
CEB	Job	36	28	the clouds pour moisture and drip continually on humans .
CEB	Job	36	29	Even if one perceives a spreading cloud and the thunder of his pavilion , [ a ]
CEB	Job	36	30	look how he spreads lightning across it and covers the seabed ;
CEB	Job	36	31	for by water [ b ] he judges peoples and gives food in abundance .
CEB	Job	36	32	He conceals lightning in his palms and orders it to its target .
CEB	Job	36	33	His thunder announces it ; even cattle proclaim its rising .
CEB	Job	37	37	Oh , my mind is disturbed by this and is more troubled than usual .
CEB	Job	37	2	Listen closely to the rumble of his voice , the roar issuing from his mouth .
CEB	Job	37	3	He looses it under the whole sky , his lightning on earth ’ s edges .
CEB	Job	37	4	After it , a voice roars ; he thunders with a mighty voice , and no one can stop it when his voice is heard .
CEB	Job	37	5	God roars with his wondrous voice ; he does great things we can ’ t know .
CEB	Job	37	6	He says to the snow , “ Fall to earth , ” and to the downpour of rain , “ Be a mighty shower. ”
CEB	Job	37	7	He stamps the hand of every person so all can know his work . [ a ]
CEB	Job	37	8	The wild beast enters its lair , lies down in its den .
CEB	Job	37	9	The storm comes from its chamber , the cold from the north wind .
CEB	Job	37	10	By God ’ s breath ice forms ; water ’ s expanse becomes solid .
CEB	Job	37	11	He also fills clouds with moisture ; his lightning scatters clouds .
CEB	Job	37	12	He overturns the circling clouds ; [ b ] by his guidance they do [ c ] their work , doing everything he commands over the entire earth .
CEB	Job	37	13	Whether for punishment , for his world , or for kindness , God makes it all happen .
CEB	Job	37	14	Hear this , Job ; stop and ponder God ’ s mighty deeds .
CEB	Job	37	15	Do you realize that when God commands them , his clouds produce lightning ?
CEB	Job	37	16	Do you understand the positioning of the clouds , the amazing deeds of one with perfect knowledge ,
CEB	Job	37	17	you whose clothes are hot when earth is calmed by the south wind ?
CEB	Job	37	18	Can you form the sky with him , hard like a mirror made of metal ?
CEB	Job	37	19	Tell us what we should say to him ; we can ’ t present our case due to darkness .
CEB	Job	37	20	Should someone inform him that I wish to speak , or would anyone say he wants to be devoured ? Divine splendor
CEB	Job	37	21	For now , no one can look at the sun ; it is bright in the sky ; the wind has passed and cleared away the clouds .
CEB	Job	37	22	From the north comes golden light , the awesome splendor of God .
CEB	Job	37	23	As for the Almighty , we can ’ t find him— he is powerful and just , abundantly righteous— he won ’ t respond .
CEB	Job	37	24	Therefore , people fear him ; none of the wise [ d ] can see him .
CEB	Job	38	38	so that dust becomes mud and clods of dirt adhere ? Lion and raven
CEB	Job	38	2	Who is this darkening counsel with words lacking knowledge ?
CEB	Job	38	3	Prepare yourself like a man ; I will interrogate you , and you will respond to me . The establishing of order
CEB	Job	38	4	Where were you when I laid the earth ’ s foundations ? Tell me if you know .
CEB	Job	38	5	Who set its measurements ? Surely you know . Who stretched a measuring tape on it ?
CEB	Job	38	6	On what were its footings sunk ; who laid its cornerstone ,
CEB	Job	38	7	while the morning stars sang in unison and all the divine beings shouted ?
CEB	Job	38	8	Who enclosed the Sea [ a ] behind doors when it burst forth from the womb ,
CEB	Job	38	9	when I made the clouds its garment , the dense clouds its wrap ,
CEB	Job	38	10	when I imposed [ b ] my limit for it , put on a bar and doors
CEB	Job	38	11	and said , “ You may come this far , no farther ; here your proud waves stop ” ?
CEB	Job	38	12	In your lifetime have you commanded the morning , informed the dawn of its place
CEB	Job	38	13	so it would take hold of earth by its edges and shake the wicked out of it ?
CEB	Job	38	14	Do you turn it over like clay for a seal , so it stands out like a colorful garment ?
CEB	Job	38	15	Light is withheld from the wicked , the uplifted arm broken . The vast beyond
CEB	Job	38	16	Have you gone to the sea ’ s sources , walked in the chamber of the deep ?
CEB	Job	38	17	Have death ’ s gates been revealed to you ; can you see the gates of deep darkness ?
CEB	Job	38	18	Have you surveyed earth ’ s expanses ? Tell me if you know everything about it .
CEB	Job	38	19	Where ’ s the road to the place where light dwells ; darkness , where ’ s it located ?
CEB	Job	38	20	Can you take it to its territory ; do you know the paths to its house ?
CEB	Job	38	21	You know , for you were born then ; you have lived such a long time ! [ c ]
CEB	Job	38	22	Have you gone to snow ’ s storehouses , seen the storehouses of hail
CEB	Job	38	23	that I have reserved for a time of distress , for a day of battle and war ?
CEB	Job	38	24	What is the way to the place where light is divided up ; the east wind scattered over earth ? Meteorological facts
CEB	Job	38	25	Who cut a channel for the downpours and a way for blasts of thunder
CEB	Job	38	26	to bring water to uninhabited land , a desert with no human
CEB	Job	38	27	to saturate dry wasteland and make grass sprout ?
CEB	Job	38	28	Has the rain a father who brought forth drops of dew ?
CEB	Job	38	29	From whose belly does ice come ; who gave birth to heaven ’ s frost ?
CEB	Job	38	30	Water hardens like stone ; the surface of the deep thickens .
CEB	Job	38	31	Can you bind Pleiades ’ chains or loosen the reins of Orion ?
CEB	Job	38	32	Can you guide the stars at their proper times , lead the Bear with her cubs ?
CEB	Job	38	33	Do you know heaven ’ s laws , or can you impose its rule on earth ?
CEB	Job	38	34	Can you issue an order to the clouds so their abundant waters cover you ?
CEB	Job	38	35	Can you send lightning so that it goes and then says to you , “ I ’ m here ” ?
CEB	Job	38	36	Who put wisdom in remote places , or who gave understanding to a rooster ? [ d ]
CEB	Job	38	37	Who is wise enough to count the clouds , and who can tilt heaven ’ s water containers
CEB	Job	38	39	Can you hunt prey for the lion or fill the cravings of lion cubs ?
CEB	Job	38	40	They lie in their den , lie in ambush in their lair .
CEB	Job	38	41	Who provides food for the raven when its young cry to God , move about without food ?
CEB	Job	39	39	Do you know when mountain goats give birth ; do you observe the birthing of does ?
CEB	Job	39	2	Can you count the months of pregnancy ; do you know when they give birth ?
CEB	Job	39	3	They crouch , split open for their young , send forth their offspring .
CEB	Job	39	4	Their young are healthy ; they grow up in the open country , leave and never return . Wild donkey
CEB	Job	39	5	Who freed the wild donkey , loosed the ropes of the onager
CEB	Job	39	6	to whom I gave the desert as home , his dwelling place in the salt flats ?
CEB	Job	39	7	He laughs at the clamor of the town , doesn ’ t hear the driver ’ s shout ,
CEB	Job	39	8	searches the hills for food and seeks any green sprout . Wild ox
CEB	Job	39	9	Will the wild ox agree to be your slave , or will it spend the night in your crib ?
CEB	Job	39	10	Can you bind it with a rope to a plowed row ; will it plow the valley behind you ?
CEB	Job	39	11	Will you trust it because its strength is great so that you can leave your work to it ?
CEB	Job	39	12	Can you rely on it to bring back your grain to gather into your threshing floor ? Ostrich
CEB	Job	39	13	The ostrich ’ s wings flap joyously , but her wings and plumage are like a stork .
CEB	Job	39	14	She leaves her eggs on the earth , lets them warm in the dust ,
CEB	Job	39	15	then forgets that a foot may crush them or a wild animal trample them .
CEB	Job	39	16	She treats her young harshly as if they were not hers , without worrying that her labor might be in vain ;
CEB	Job	39	17	God didn ’ t endow her with sense , didn ’ t give her some good sense .
CEB	Job	39	18	When she flaps her wings high , she laughs at horse and rider . Horse
CEB	Job	39	19	Did you give strength to the horse , clothe his neck with a mane ,
CEB	Job	39	20	cause him to leap like a locust , his majestic snorting , a fright ?
CEB	Job	39	21	He [ a ] paws in the valley , prances proudly , charges at battle weapons ,
CEB	Job	39	22	laughs at fear , unafraid . He doesn ’ t turn away from the sword ;
CEB	Job	39	23	a quiver of arrows flies by him , flashing spear and dagger .
CEB	Job	39	24	Excitedly , trembling , he swallows the ground ; can ’ t stand still at a trumpet ’ s blast .
CEB	Job	39	25	At a trumpet ’ s sound , he says , “ Aha ! ” smells the battle from afar , hears [ b ] officers ’ shouting and the battle cry . Hawk and eagle
CEB	Job	39	26	Is it due to your understanding that the hawk flies , spreading its wings to the south ?
CEB	Job	39	27	Or at your command does the eagle soar , the vulture build a nest on high ?
CEB	Job	39	28	They dwell on an outcropping of rock , their fortress on rock ’ s edge .
CEB	Job	39	29	From there they search for food ; their eyes notice it from afar ,
CEB	Job	39	30	and their young lap up blood ; where carcasses lie , there they are .
CEB	Job	40	40	The Lord continued to respond to Job :
CEB	Job	40	2	Will the one who disputes with the Almighty correct him ? God ’ s instructor must answer him .
CEB	Job	40	3	Job responded to the Lord :
CEB	Job	40	4	Look , I ’ m of little worth . What can I answer you ? I ’ ll put my hand over my mouth .
CEB	Job	40	5	I have spoken once , I won ’ t answer ; twice , I won ’ t do it again . A challenge from the Lord
CEB	Job	40	6	The Lord answered Job from the whirlwind :
CEB	Job	40	7	Prepare yourself like a man ; I will interrogate you , and you will respond to me .
CEB	Job	40	8	Would you question my justice , deem me guilty so you can be innocent ?
CEB	Job	40	9	Or do you have an arm like God ; can you thunder with a voice like him ?
CEB	Job	40	10	Adorn yourself with splendor and majesty ; clothe yourself with honor and esteem .
CEB	Job	40	11	Unleash your raging anger ; look on all the proud and humble them .
CEB	Job	40	12	Look on all the proud and debase them ; trample the wicked in their place .
CEB	Job	40	13	Hide them together in the dust ; bind their faces in a hidden place .
CEB	Job	40	14	Then I , even I , will praise you , for your strong hand has delivered you . Behemoth
CEB	Job	40	15	Look at Behemoth , whom I made along with you ; he eats grass like cattle .
CEB	Job	40	16	Look , his strength is in his thighs , his power in stomach muscles .
CEB	Job	40	17	He stiffens his tail like a cedar ; the tendons in his thighs are tightly woven .
CEB	Job	40	18	His bones are like bronze tubes , his limbs like iron bars .
CEB	Job	40	19	He is the first of God ’ s acts ; only his maker can come near him with a sword .
CEB	Job	40	20	Indeed , the hills bring him tribute , places where all the wild animals play .
CEB	Job	40	21	He lies under the lotuses , under the cover of reed and marsh .
CEB	Job	40	22	The lotuses screen him with shade ; poplars of the stream surround him .
CEB	Job	40	23	If the river surges , he doesn ’ t hurry ; he is confident even though the Jordan gushes into his mouth .
CEB	Job	40	24	Can he be seized by his eyes ? Can anyone pierce his nose by hooks ?
CEB	Job	41	41	[ a ] Can you draw out Leviathan with a hook , restrain his tongue with a rope ?
CEB	Job	41	2	Can you put a cord through his nose , pierce his jaw with a barb ?
CEB	Job	41	3	Will he beg you at length or speak gentle words to you ?
CEB	Job	41	4	Will he make a pact with you so that you will take him as a permanent slave ?
CEB	Job	41	5	Can you play with him like a bird , put a leash on him for your girls ?
CEB	Job	41	6	Will merchants sell him ; will they divide him among traders ?
CEB	Job	41	7	Can you fill his hide with darts , his head with a fishing spear ?
CEB	Job	41	8	Should you lay your hand on him , you would never remember the battle .
CEB	Job	41	9	Such hopes [ b ] would be delusional ; surely the sight of him makes one stumble .
CEB	Job	41	10	Nobody is fierce enough to rouse him ; who then can stand before me ?
CEB	Job	41	11	Who opposes me that I must repay ? Everything under heaven is mine .
CEB	Job	41	12	I ’ m not awed by his limbs , his strength , and impressive form .
CEB	Job	41	13	Who can remove his outer garment ; who can come with a bridle for him ?
CEB	Job	41	14	Who can open the doors of his mouth , surrounded by frightening teeth ?
CEB	Job	41	15	His matching scales are his pride , closely locked and sealed .
CEB	Job	41	16	One touches another ; even air can ’ t come between them .
CEB	Job	41	17	Each clings to its pair ; joined , they can ’ t be separated .
CEB	Job	41	18	His sneezes emit flashes of light ; his eyes are like dawn ’ s rays .
CEB	Job	41	19	Shafts of fire shoot from his mouth ; like fiery sparks they fly out .
CEB	Job	41	20	Smoke pours from his nostrils like a boiling pot over reeds .
CEB	Job	41	21	His breath lights coals ; a flame shoots from his mouth .
CEB	Job	41	22	Power resides in his neck ; violence dances before him .
CEB	Job	41	23	The folds of his flesh stick together ; on him they are tough and unyielding .
CEB	Job	41	24	His heart is solid like a rock , hard like a lower millstone .
CEB	Job	41	25	The divine beings dread his rising ; they withdraw before his thrashing .
CEB	Job	41	26	The sword that touches him won ’ t prevail ; neither will the dart , spear , nor javelin .
CEB	Job	41	27	He treats iron as straw , bronze as rotten wood .
CEB	Job	41	28	Arrows can ’ t make him flee ; slingstones he turns to straw .
CEB	Job	41	29	He treats a club like straw ; he laughs at the lance ’ s rattle .
CEB	Job	41	30	His abdomen is like jagged pottery shards ; its sharp edges leave a trail in the mud .
CEB	Job	41	31	He causes the depths to churn like a boiling pot , stirs up the sea like a pot of scented oils ,
CEB	Job	41	32	leaves a bright wake behind him ; the frothy deep seems white-haired .
CEB	Job	41	33	None on earth can compare to him ; he is made to be without fear .
CEB	Job	41	34	He looks on all the proud ; he is king over all proud beasts .
CEB	Job	42	42	Job answered the Lord :
CEB	Job	42	2	I know you can do anything ; no plan of yours can be opposed successfully .
CEB	Job	42	3	You said , [ a ] “ Who is this darkening counsel without knowledge ? ” I have indeed spoken about things I didn ’ t understand , wonders beyond my comprehension .
CEB	Job	42	4	You said , [ b ] “ Listen and I will speak ; I will question you and you will inform me. ”
CEB	Job	42	5	My ears had heard about you , but now my eyes have seen you .
CEB	Job	42	6	Therefore , I relent [ c ] and find comfort on dust and ashes . Epilogue
CEB	Job	42	7	After the Lord had spoken these words to Job , he said to Eliphaz from Teman , “ I ’ m angry at you and your two friends because you haven ’ t spoken about me correctly as did my servant Job .
CEB	Job	42	8	So now , take seven bulls and seven rams , go to my servant Job , and prepare an entirely burned offering for yourselves . Job my servant will pray for you , and I will act favorably by not making fools of you because you didn ’ t speak correctly , as did my servant Job. ”
CEB	Job	42	9	Eliphaz from Teman , Bildad from Shuah , and Zophar from Naamah did what the Lord told them ; and the Lord acted favorably toward Job .
CEB	Job	42	10	Then the Lord changed Job ’ s fortune when he prayed for his friends , and the Lord doubled all Job ’ s earlier possessions .
CEB	Job	42	11	All his brothers , sisters , and acquaintances came to him and ate food with him in his house . They comforted and consoled him concerning all the disaster the Lord had brought on him , and each one gave him a qesitah [ d ] and a gold ring .
CEB	Job	42	12	Then the Lord blessed Job ’ s latter days more than his former ones . He had fourteen thousand sheep , six thousand camels , one thousand yoke of oxen , and one thousand female donkeys .
CEB	Job	42	13	He also had seven sons and three daughters .
CEB	Job	42	14	He named one Jemimah , [ e ] a second Keziah , [ f ] and the third Keren-happuch . [ g ]
CEB	Job	42	15	No women in all the land were as beautiful as Job ’ s daughters ; and their father gave an inheritance to them along with their brothers .
CEB	Job	42	16	After this , Job lived
CEB	Job	42	140	years and saw four generations of his children .
CEB	Job	42	17	Then Job died , old and satisfied .
CEB	Psalms	1	1	The truly happy person doesn ’ t follow wicked advice , doesn ’ t stand on the road of sinners , and doesn ’ t sit with the disrespectful .
CEB	Psalms	1	2	Instead of doing those things , these persons love the Lord ’ s Instruction , and they recite God ’ s Instruction day and night !
CEB	Psalms	1	3	They are like a tree replanted by streams of water , which bears fruit at just the right time and whose leaves don ’ t fade . Whatever they do succeeds .
CEB	Psalms	1	4	That ’ s not true for the wicked ! They are like dust that the wind blows away .
CEB	Psalms	1	5	And that ’ s why the wicked will have no standing in the court of justice— neither will sinners in the assembly of the righteous .
CEB	Psalms	1	6	The Lord is intimately acquainted with the way of the righteous , but the way of the wicked is destroyed .
CEB	Psalms	2	2	The earth ’ s rulers take their stand ; the leaders scheme together against the Lord and against his anointed one .
CEB	Psalms	2	3	“ Come ! ” they say . “ We will tear off their ropes and throw off their chains ! ”
CEB	Psalms	2	4	The one who rules in heaven laughs ; my Lord makes fun of them .
CEB	Psalms	2	5	But then God speaks to them angrily ; then he terrifies them with his fury :
CEB	Psalms	2	6	“ I hereby appoint my king on Zion , my holy mountain ! ”
CEB	Psalms	2	7	I will announce the Lord ’ s decision : He said to me , “ You are my son , today I have become your father .
CEB	Psalms	2	8	Just ask me , and I will make the nations your possession ; the far corners of the earth will be your property .
CEB	Psalms	2	9	You will smash them with an iron rod ; you will shatter them like a pottery jar. ”
CEB	Psalms	2	10	So kings , wise up ! Be warned , you rulers of the earth !
CEB	Psalms	2	11	Serve the Lord reverently— trembling ,
CEB	Psalms	2	12	kiss his feet [ a ] or else he will become angry , and your way will be destroyed because his anger ignites in an instant . But all who take refuge in the Lord are truly happy !

CEB	Psalms	77	17	The clouds poured water , the skies cracked thunder ; your arrows were flying all around !
CEB	Psalms	77	18	The crash of your thunder was in the swirling storm ; lightning lit up the whole world ; the earth shook and quaked .
CEB	Psalms	77	19	Your way went straight through the sea ; your pathways went right through the mighty waters . But your footprints left no trace !
CEB	Psalms	77	20	You led your people like sheep under the care of Moses and Aaron . Footnotes - Psalm 77:2 Or soul - Psalm 77:6 LXX ; MT I remember my song in the night .
CEB	Psalms	78	78	Listen , my people , to my teaching ; tilt your ears toward the words of my mouth .
CEB	Psalms	78	2	I will open my mouth with a proverb . I ’ ll declare riddles from days long gone—
CEB	Psalms	78	3	ones that we ’ ve heard and learned about , ones that our ancestors told us .
CEB	Psalms	78	4	We won ’ t hide them from their descendants ; we ’ ll tell the next generation all about the praise due the Lord and his strength— the wondrous works God has done .
CEB	Psalms	78	5	He established a law for Jacob and set up Instruction for Israel , ordering our ancestors to teach them to their children .
CEB	Psalms	78	6	This is so that the next generation and children not yet born will know these things , and so they can rise up and tell their children
CEB	Psalms	78	7	to put their hope in God— never forgetting God ’ s deeds , but keeping God ’ s commandments—
CEB	Psalms	78	8	and so that they won ’ t become like their ancestors : a rebellious , stubborn generation , a generation whose heart wasn ’ t set firm and whose spirit wasn ’ t faithful to God .
CEB	Psalms	78	9	The children of Ephraim , armed with bows , retreated on the day of battle .
CEB	Psalms	78	10	They didn ’ t keep God ’ s covenant ; they refused to walk in his Instruction .
CEB	Psalms	78	11	They forgot God ’ s deeds as well as the wondrous works he showed them .
CEB	Psalms	78	12	But God performed wonders in their ancestors ’ presence— in the land of Egypt , in the field of Zoan .
CEB	Psalms	78	13	God split the sea and led them through , making the waters stand up like a wall .
CEB	Psalms	78	14	God led them with the cloud by day ; by the lightning all through the night .
CEB	Psalms	78	15	God split rocks open in the wilderness , gave them plenty to drink— as if from the deep itself !
CEB	Psalms	78	16	God made streams flow from the rock , made water run like rivers .
CEB	Psalms	78	17	But they continued to sin against God , rebelling against the Most High in the desert .
CEB	Psalms	78	18	They tested God in their hearts , demanded food for their stomachs .
CEB	Psalms	78	19	They spoke against God ! “ Can God set a dinner table in the wilderness ? ” they asked .
CEB	Psalms	78	20	“ True , God struck the rock and water gushed and streams flowed , but can he give bread too ? Can he provide meat for his people ? ”
CEB	Psalms	78	21	When the Lord heard this , he became furious . A fire was ignited against Jacob ; wrath also burned against Israel
CEB	Psalms	78	22	because they had no faith in God , because they didn ’ t trust his saving power .
CEB	Psalms	78	23	God gave orders to the skies above , opened heaven ’ s doors ,
CEB	Psalms	78	24	and rained manna on them so they could eat . He gave them the very grain of heaven !
CEB	Psalms	78	25	Each person ate the bread of the powerful ones ; [ b ] God sent provisions to satisfy them .
CEB	Psalms	78	26	God set the east wind moving across the skies and drove the south wind by his strength .
CEB	Psalms	78	27	He rained meat on them as if it were dust in the air ; he rained as many birds as the sand on the seashore !
CEB	Psalms	78	28	God brought the birds down in the center of their camp , all around their dwellings .
CEB	Psalms	78	29	So they ate and were completely satisfied ; God gave them exactly what they had craved .
CEB	Psalms	78	30	But they didn ’ t stop craving— even with the food still in their mouths !
CEB	Psalms	78	31	So God ’ s anger came up against them : he killed the most hearty of them ; he cut down Israel ’ s youth in their prime .
CEB	Psalms	78	32	But in spite of all that , they kept sinning and had no faith in God ’ s wondrous works .
CEB	Psalms	78	33	So God brought their days to an end , like a puff of air , and their years in total ruin .
CEB	Psalms	78	34	But whenever God killed them , they went after him ! They would turn and earnestly search for God .
CEB	Psalms	78	35	They would remember that God was their rock , that the Most High was their redeemer .
CEB	Psalms	78	36	But they were just flattering him with lip service . They were lying to him with their tongues .
CEB	Psalms	78	37	Their hearts weren ’ t firmly set on him ; they weren ’ t faithful to his covenant .
CEB	Psalms	78	38	But God , being compassionate , kept forgiving their sins , kept avoiding destruction ; he took back his anger so many times , wouldn ’ t stir up all his wrath !
CEB	Psalms	78	39	God kept remembering that they were just flesh , just breath that passes and doesn ’ t come back .
CEB	Psalms	78	40	How often they rebelled against God in the wilderness and distressed him in the desert !

CEB	Psalms	78	44	God turned their rivers into blood ; they couldn ’ t drink from their own streams .
CEB	Psalms	78	45	God sent swarms against them to eat them up , frogs to destroy them .

CEB	Psalms	78	48	God delivered their cattle over to disease , [ c ] their herds to plagues .
CEB	Psalms	78	49	God unleashed his burning anger against them— fury , indignation , distress , a troop of evil messengers .
CEB	Psalms	78	50	God blazed a path for his wrath . He didn ’ t save them from death , but delivered their lives over to disease .
CEB	Psalms	78	51	God struck down all of Egypt ’ s oldest males ; in Ham ’ s tents , he struck their pride and joy .
CEB	Psalms	78	52	God led his own people out like sheep , guiding them like a flock in the wilderness .
CEB	Psalms	78	53	God led them in safety—they were not afraid ! But the sea engulfed their enemies !
CEB	Psalms	78	54	God brought them to his holy territory , to the mountain that his own strong hand had acquired .
CEB	Psalms	78	55	God drove out the nations before them and apportioned property for them ; he settled Israel ’ s tribes in their tents .
CEB	Psalms	78	56	But they tested and defied the Most High God ; they didn ’ t pay attention to his warnings .
CEB	Psalms	78	57	They turned away , became faithless just like their ancestors ; they twisted away like a defective bow .
CEB	Psalms	78	58	They angered God with their many shrines ; they angered him with their idols .
CEB	Psalms	78	59	God heard and became enraged ; he rejected Israel utterly .
CEB	Psalms	78	60	God abandoned the sanctuary at Shiloh , the tent where he had lived with humans .
CEB	Psalms	78	61	God let his power be held captive , let his glory go to the enemy ’ s hand .
CEB	Psalms	78	62	God delivered his people up to the sword ; he was enraged at his own possession .
CEB	Psalms	78	63	Fire devoured his young men , and his young women had no wedding songs .
CEB	Psalms	78	64	God ’ s priests were killed by the sword , and his widows couldn ’ t even cry .
CEB	Psalms	78	65	But then my Lord woke up— as if he ’ d been sleeping ! Like a warrior shaking off wine ,
CEB	Psalms	78	66	God beat back his foes ; he made them an everlasting disgrace .
CEB	Psalms	78	67	God rejected the tent of Joseph and didn ’ t choose the tribe of Ephraim .
CEB	Psalms	78	68	Instead , he chose the tribe of Judah , the mountain of Zion , which he loves .
CEB	Psalms	78	69	God built his sanctuary like the highest heaven and like the earth , which he established forever .
CEB	Psalms	78	70	And God chose David , his servant , taking him from the sheepfolds .
CEB	Psalms	78	71	God brought him from shepherding nursing ewes to shepherd his people Jacob , to shepherd his inheritance , Israel .

CEB	Psalms	106	6	We have sinned—right along with our ancestors . We ’ ve done what is wrong . We ’ ve acted wickedly .
CEB	Psalms	106	7	Our ancestors in Egypt didn ’ t understand your wondrous works . They didn ’ t remember how much faithful love you have . So they rebelled by the sea—at the Reed Sea . [ a ]
CEB	Psalms	106	8	But God saved them for the sake of his good name , to make known his mighty power .
CEB	Psalms	106	9	God scolded the Reed Sea , and it dried right up ; he led them through the deeps like they were a dry desert .
CEB	Psalms	106	10	God saved them from hostile powers ; he redeemed them from the power of the enemy .
CEB	Psalms	106	11	But the waters covered over their foes— not one of them survived !
CEB	Psalms	106	12	So our ancestors trusted God ’ s words ; they sang God ’ s praise .
CEB	Psalms	106	13	But how quickly they forgot what he had done ! They wouldn ’ t wait for his advice .
CEB	Psalms	106	14	They were overcome with craving in the desert ; they tested God in the wastelands .
CEB	Psalms	106	15	God gave them what they asked for ; he sent food [ b ] to satisfy their appetites .
CEB	Psalms	106	16	But then they were jealous of Moses in the camp , jealous too of Aaron , the Lord ’ s holy one .
CEB	Psalms	106	17	So the earth opened up , swallowing Dathan , and covering over Abiram ’ s crowd .
CEB	Psalms	106	18	Fire blazed throughout that whole group ; flames burned up the wicked .
CEB	Psalms	106	19	They made a calf at Horeb , bowing down to a metal idol .
CEB	Psalms	106	20	They traded their glorious God [ c ] for an image of a bull that eats grass .
CEB	Psalms	106	21	They forgot the God who saved them— the one who had done great things in Egypt ,
CEB	Psalms	106	22	- Psalm 106:15 LXX - Psalm 106:20 Or their Glory
CEB	Psalms	106	23	So God determined that he would destroy them— except for the fact that Moses , his chosen one , stood in the way , right in front of him , and turned God ’ s destructive anger away .
CEB	Psalms	106	24	But then they rejected the land that was so desirable . They didn ’ t trust God ’ s promise .
CEB	Psalms	106	25	They muttered in their tents and wouldn ’ t listen to the Lord ’ s voice .
CEB	Psalms	106	26	So God raised his hand against them , making them fall in the desert ,
CEB	Psalms	106	27	scattering their offspring among the nations , casting them across many lands .
CEB	Psalms	106	28	They joined themselves to Baal-peor and ate sacrifices offered to the dead .
CEB	Psalms	106	29	They made God angry by what they did , so a plague broke out against them .
CEB	Psalms	106	30	Then Phinehas stood up and prayed , and the plague was contained .
CEB	Psalms	106	31	That ’ s why Phinehas is considered righteous , generation after generation , forever .
CEB	Psalms	106	32	But they angered God at Meribah ’ s waters , and things went badly for Moses because of them ,
CEB	Psalms	106	33	because they made him bitter so that he spoke rashly with his lips .
CEB	Psalms	106	34	They didn ’ t destroy the nations as the Lord had ordered them to do .
CEB	Psalms	106	35	Instead , they got mixed up with the nations , learning what they did
CEB	Psalms	106	36	and serving those false gods , which became a trap for them .
CEB	Psalms	106	37	They sacrificed their own sons and daughters to demons !
CEB	Psalms	106	38	They shed innocent blood , the blood of their own sons and daughters— the ones they sacrificed to Canaan ’ s false gods— so the land was defiled by the bloodshed .
CEB	Psalms	106	39	They made themselves unclean by what they did ; they prostituted themselves by their actions .
CEB	Psalms	106	40	So the Lord ’ s anger burned against his people ; he despised his own possession .
CEB	Psalms	106	41	God handed them over to the nations ; people who hated them ruled over them .
CEB	Psalms	106	42	Their enemies oppressed them , and they were humbled under their power .
CEB	Psalms	106	43	God delivered them numerous times , but they were determined to rebel , and so they were brought down by their own sin .
CEB	Psalms	106	44	But God saw their distress when he heard their loud cries .
CEB	Psalms	106	45	God remembered his covenant for their sake , and because of how much faithful love he has , God changed his mind .
CEB	Psalms	106	46	God allowed them to receive compassion from all their captors .

CEB	Psalms	107	6	So they cried out to the Lord in their distress , and God delivered them from their desperate circumstances .
CEB	Psalms	107	7	God led them straight to human habitation .
CEB	Psalms	107	8	Let them thank the Lord for his faithful love and his wondrous works for all people ,
CEB	Psalms	107	9	because God satisfied the one who was parched with thirst , and he filled up the hungry with good things !
CEB	Psalms	107	10	Some of the redeemed had been sitting in darkness and deep gloom ; they were prisoners suffering in chains
CEB	Psalms	107	11	because they had disobeyed God ’ s instructions and rejected the Most High ’ s plans .
CEB	Psalms	107	12	So God humbled them with hard work . They stumbled , and there was no one to help them .

CEB	Psalms	107	18	They had absolutely no appetite for food ; they had arrived at death ’ s gates .

CEB	Psalms	107	24	They saw what the Lord had made ; they saw his wondrous works in the depths of the sea .
CEB	Psalms	107	25	God spoke and stirred up a storm that brought the waves up high .
CEB	Psalms	107	26	The waves went as high as the sky ; they crashed down to the depths . The sailors ’ courage melted at this terrible situation .
CEB	Psalms	107	27	They staggered and stumbled around like they were drunk . None of their skill was of any help .
CEB	Psalms	107	28	So they cried out to the Lord in their distress , and God brought them out safe from their desperate circumstances .
CEB	Psalms	107	29	God quieted the storm to a whisper ; the sea ’ s waves were hushed .
CEB	Psalms	107	30	So they rejoiced because the waves had calmed down ; then God led them to the harbor they were hoping for .
CEB	Psalms	107	31	Let them thank the Lord for his faithful love and his wondrous works for all people .
CEB	Psalms	107	32	Let them exalt God in the congregation of the people and praise God in the assembly of the elders .
CEB	Psalms	107	33	God turns rivers into desert , watery springs into thirsty ground ,
CEB	Psalms	107	34	fruitful land into unproductive dirt , when its inhabitants are wicked .
CEB	Psalms	107	35	But God can also turn the desert into watery pools , thirsty ground into watery springs ,
CEB	Psalms	107	36	where he settles the hungry . They even build a city and live there !
CEB	Psalms	107	37	They plant fields and vineyards and obtain a fruitful harvest .
CEB	Psalms	107	38	God blesses them , and they become many . God won ’ t even let their cattle diminish .
CEB	Psalms	107	39	But when they do diminish— when they ’ re brought down by oppression , trouble , and grief—
CEB	Psalms	107	40	God pours contempt on their leaders , making them wander aimlessly in the wastelands .
CEB	Psalms	107	41	But God raises the needy from their suffering ; he makes their families as numerous as sheep !

CEB	Ecclesiastes	1	1	The words of the Teacher of the Assembly , [ a ] David ’ s son , king in Jerusalem :
CEB	Ecclesiastes	1	2	Perfectly pointless , [ b ] says the Teacher , perfectly pointless . Everything is pointless . Some things are inevitable
CEB	Ecclesiastes	1	3	What do people gain from all the hard work that they work so hard at under the sun ?
CEB	Ecclesiastes	1	4	A generation goes , and a generation comes , but the earth remains as it always has .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	1	5	The sun rises , the sun sets ; it returns panting to the place where it dawns .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	1	6	The wind blows to the south , goes around to the north ; around and around blows the wind ; the wind returns to its rounds again .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	1	7	All streams flow to the sea , but the sea is never full ; to the place where the rivers flow , there they continue to flow .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	1	8	All words [ c ] are tiring ; no one is able to speak . The eye isn ’ t satisfied with seeing , neither is the ear filled up by hearing .

CEB	Ecclesiastes	1	12	; 7:27 ; 12:8 ,
CEB	Ecclesiastes	1	13	I applied my mind to investigate and to explore by wisdom all that happens under heaven . It ’ s an unhappy obsession that God has given to human beings .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	1	14	When I observed all that happens under the sun , I realized that everything is pointless , a chasing after wind .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	1	15	What ’ s crooked can ’ t be straightened ; what isn ’ t there can ’ t be counted .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	1	16	I said to myself , Look here , I have grown much wiser than any who ruled over Jerusalem before me . My mind has absorbed great wisdom and knowledge .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	1	17	But when I set my mind to understand wisdom , and also to understand madness and folly , I realized that this too was just wind chasing .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	1	18	Remember : In much wisdom is much aggravation ; the more knowledge , the more pain . Footnotes - Ecclesiastes 1:1 Or Gatherer or Convener or Assembler ( Heb Qoheleth ) ; see also 1:2 ,
CEB	Ecclesiastes	2	2	Merriment , I thought , is madness ; pleasure , of no use at all .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	2	3	I tried cheering myself with wine and by embracing folly—with wisdom still guiding me—until I might see what is really worth doing in the few days that human beings have under heaven .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	2	4	I took on great projects : I built houses for myself , planted vineyards for myself .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	2	5	I made gardens and parks for myself , planting every kind of fruit tree in them .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	2	6	I made reservoirs for myself to water my lush groves .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	2	7	I acquired male servants and female servants ; I even had slaves born in my house . I also had great herds of cattle and sheep , more than any who preceded me in Jerusalem .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	2	8	I amassed silver and gold for myself , the treasures of kings and provinces . I acquired male and female singers for myself , along with every human luxury , treasure chests galore ! [ c ]
CEB	Ecclesiastes	2	9	So I became far greater than all who preceded me in Jerusalem . Moreover , my wisdom stood by me .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	2	10	I refrained from nothing that my eyes desired . I refused my heart no pleasure . Indeed , my heart found pleasure from the results of my hard work ; that was the reward from all my hard work .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	2	11	But when I surveyed all that my hands had done , and what I had worked so hard to achieve , I realized that it was pointless—a chasing after wind . Nothing is to be gained under the sun .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	2	12	My reflections then turned to wisdom , madness , and folly . What can the king ’ s heir do but what has already been done ?
CEB	Ecclesiastes	2	13	I saw that wisdom is more beneficial than folly , as light is more beneficial than darkness .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	2	14	The wise have eyes in their head , but fools walk around in darkness . But I also realized that the same fate happens to both of them .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	2	15	So I thought to myself , What happens to the fool will also happen to me . So why have I been so very wise ? I said to myself , This too is pointless .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	2	16	There is no eternal memory of the wise any more than the foolish , [ d ] because everyone is forgotten before long . How can the wise die just like the fool ?
CEB	Ecclesiastes	2	17	So I hated life , because the things that happen under the sun were troublesome to me . Definitely , everything is pointless—just wind chasing .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	2	18	I hated the things I worked so hard for here under the sun , because I will have to leave them to someone who comes after me .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	2	19	And who knows whether that one will be wise or foolish ? Either way , that person will have control over the results of all my hard work and wisdom here under the sun . That too is pointless .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	2	20	I then gave myself up to despair , as I thought about all my laborious hard work under the sun ,
CEB	Ecclesiastes	2	21	because sometimes those who have worked hard with wisdom , knowledge , and skill must leave the results of their hard work as a possession to those who haven ’ t worked hard for it . This too is pointless—it ’ s a terrible wrong .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	2	22	I mean , What do people get for all their hard work and struggles under the sun ?
CEB	Ecclesiastes	2	23	All their days are pain , and their work is aggravation ; even at night , their hearts don ’ t find rest . This too is pointless .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	2	24	There ’ s nothing better for human beings than to eat , drink , and experience pleasure in their hard work . I also saw that this is from God ’ s hand—
CEB	Ecclesiastes	2	25	Who can eat and find enjoyment otherwise ? —
CEB	Ecclesiastes	2	26	because God gives wisdom , knowledge , and joy to those who please God . But to those who are offensive , [ e ] God gives the task of hoarding and accumulating , but only so as to give it all to those who do please God . This too is pointless and a chasing after wind .

CEB	Ecclesiastes	3	9	What do workers gain from all their hard work ?
CEB	Ecclesiastes	3	10	I have observed the task that God has given human beings .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	3	11	God has made everything fitting in its time , but has also placed eternity in their hearts , without enabling them to discover what God has done from beginning to end .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	3	12	I know that there ’ s nothing better for them but to enjoy themselves and do what ’ s good while they live .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	3	13	Moreover , this is the gift of God : that all people should eat , drink , and enjoy the results of their hard work .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	3	14	I know that whatever God does will last forever ; it ’ s impossible to add to it or take away from it . God has done this so that people are reverent before him . [ a ]
CEB	Ecclesiastes	3	15	Whatever happens has already happened , and whatever will happen has already happened before . And God looks after what is driven away . [ b ] Enjoy what you do now
CEB	Ecclesiastes	3	16	I saw something else under the sun : in the place of justice , there was wickedness ; and in the place of what was right , there was wickedness again !
CEB	Ecclesiastes	3	17	I thought to myself , God will judge both righteous and wicked people , because there ’ s a time for every matter and every deed .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	3	18	I also thought , Where human beings are concerned , God tests them to show them that they are but animals
CEB	Ecclesiastes	3	19	because human beings and animals share the same fate . One dies just like the other—both have the same life-breath . Humans are no better off than animals because everything is pointless .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	3	20	All go to the same place : all are from the dust ; all return to the dust .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	3	21	Who knows if a human being ’ s life-breath rises upward while an animal ’ s life-breath descends into the earth ?
CEB	Ecclesiastes	3	22	So I perceived that there was nothing better for human beings but to enjoy what they do because that ’ s what they ’ re allotted in life . Who , really , is able to see what will happen in the future ? Footnotes - Ecclesiastes 3:14 Or to inspire awe before the divine - Ecclesiastes 3:15 Or God seeks out what is pursued , or God seeks what has gone by , or God seeks the pursued ; Heb uncertain
CEB	Ecclesiastes	4	4	I also observed that people work hard and become good at what they do only out of mutual envy . This too is pointless , just wind chasing .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	4	2	So I declare that the dead , who have already died , are more fortunate than the living , who are still alive .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	4	3	But happier than both are those who have never existed , who haven ’ t witnessed the terrible things that happen under the sun . Envy and loneliness
CEB	Ecclesiastes	4	5	Fools fold their hands and eat their own flesh .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	4	6	But better is resting with one handful than working hard for two fistfuls and chasing after wind .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	4	7	Next , I saw under the sun something else that was pointless :
CEB	Ecclesiastes	4	8	There are people who are utterly alone , with no companions , not even a child or a sibling . Yet they work hard without end , never satisfied with their wealth . So for whom am I working so hard and depriving myself of enjoyment ? This too is pointless and a terrible obsession .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	4	9	Two are better than one because they have a good return for their hard work .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	4	10	If either should fall , one can pick up the other . But how miserable are those who fall and don ’ t have a companion to help them up !
CEB	Ecclesiastes	4	11	Also , if two lie down together , they can stay warm . But how can anyone stay warm alone ?
CEB	Ecclesiastes	4	12	Also , one can be overpowered , but two together can put up resistance . A three-ply cord doesn ’ t easily snap .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	4	13	A poor but wise youth is better than an old and foolish king , who no longer listens to advice .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	4	14	He emerged from prison to become king , even though during his rule a poor child [ a ] is born .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	4	15	I saw all who live and walk under the sun following the next youth who would rise to take his place .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	4	16	There was no counting the number of people he ruled , but those who came later aren ’ t happy with him . This too is pointless and a chasing after wind . Footnotes - Ecclesiastes 4:14 Possibly the youth of 4:13 ; or He emerged from prison to become king , even though he was born poor in the kingdom .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	5	5	Better not to make a promise than to make a promise without fulfilling it .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	5	2	Don ’ t [ b ] be quick with your mouth or say anything hastily before God , because God is in heaven , but you are on earth . Therefore , let your words be few .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	5	3	Remember : Dreams come with many cares , and the voice of fools with many words .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	5	4	When you make a promise to God , fulfill it without delay because God has no pleasure in fools . Fulfill what you promise .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	5	6	Don ’ t let your mouth make a sinner of you , and don ’ t say to the messenger : “ It was a mistake ! ” Otherwise , God may become angry at such talk and destroy what you have accomplished .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	5	7	Remember : When dreams multiply , so do pointless thoughts and excessive speech . Therefore , fear God . Hoarding wealth
CEB	Ecclesiastes	5	8	If you witness the poor being oppressed or the violation of what is just and right in some territory , don ’ t be surprised because a high official watches over another , and yet others stand over them .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	5	9	But the land ’ s yield should be for everyone if the field is cultivated . [ c ]
CEB	Ecclesiastes	5	10	The money lover isn ’ t satisfied with money ; neither is the lover of wealth satisfied with income . This too is pointless .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	5	11	When good things flow , so do those who consume them . But what do owners benefit from such goods , except to feast their eyes on them ?
CEB	Ecclesiastes	5	12	Sweet is the worker ’ s sleep , whether there ’ s a lot or little to eat ; but the excess of the wealthy won ’ t let them sleep .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	5	13	I have seen a sickening tragedy under the sun : people hoard their wealth to their own detriment .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	5	14	Then that wealth is lost in a bad business venture so that when they have children , they are left with nothing .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	5	15	Just as they came from their mother ’ s womb naked , naked they ’ ll return , ending up just like they started . All their hard work produces nothing—nothing they can take with them .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	5	16	This too is a sickening tragedy : they must pass on just as they arrived . What then do they gain from working so hard for wind ?
CEB	Ecclesiastes	5	17	What ’ s more , they constantly eat in darkness , with much aggravation , grief , and anger .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	5	18	This is the one good thing I ’ ve seen : it ’ s appropriate for people to eat , drink , and find enjoyment in all their hard work under the sun during the brief lifetime that God gives them because that ’ s their lot in life .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	5	19	Also , whenever God gives people wealth and riches and enables them to enjoy it , to accept their place in the world [ d ] and to find pleasure in their hard work—all this is God ’ s gift .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	5	20	Indeed , people shouldn ’ t brood too much over the days of their lives because God gives an answer in their hearts ’ joy .

CEB	Ecclesiastes	6	6	who live a thousand years twice over but don ’ t enjoy life ’ s good things . Isn ’ t everyone heading to the same destination ?
CEB	Ecclesiastes	6	2	God may give some people plenty of wealth , riches , and glory so that they lack nothing they desire . But God doesn ’ t enable them to enjoy it ; instead , a stranger enjoys it . This is pointless and a sickening tragedy .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	6	3	Some people may have one hundred children and live a long life . But no matter how long they live , if they aren ’ t content with life ’ s good things , I say that even a stillborn child with no grave is better off than they are . [ a ]
CEB	Ecclesiastes	6	4	Because that child arrives pointlessly , then passes away in darkness . Darkness covers its name .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	6	5	It hasn ’ t seen the sun or experienced anything . But it has more peace than those
CEB	Ecclesiastes	6	7	All the hard work of humans is for the mouth , but the appetite is never full .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	6	8	What advantage do the wise have over the foolish ? Or what do the poor gain by knowing how to conduct themselves before the living ?
CEB	Ecclesiastes	6	9	It ’ s better to enjoy what ’ s at hand than to have an insatiable appetite . This too is pointless , just wind chasing .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	6	10	Whatever happens has already been designated , and human beings are fully known . They can ’ t contend with the one who is stronger than they are .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	6	11	Because the more words increase , the more everything is pointless . What do people gain by it ?
CEB	Ecclesiastes	6	12	Because who knows what ’ s good for human beings during life , during their brief pointless life , which will pass away like a shadow ? Who can say what the future holds for people under the sun ? Footnotes - Ecclesiastes 6:3 Correction ; Heb puts the lack of burial site with those who do not enjoy life 's good things .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	7	7	Oppression turns the wise into fools ; a bribe corrupts the heart .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	7	2	It is better to go to a house in mourning than to a house party , because that is everyone ’ s destiny ; and the living should take it to heart .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	7	3	Aggravation is better than merriment because a sad face may lead to a glad heart .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	7	4	The wise heart is in the house that mourns , but the foolish heart is in the house that rejoices .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	7	5	It is better to obey the reprimand of the wise than to listen to the song of fools ,
CEB	Ecclesiastes	7	6	because the fool ’ s merriment is like nettles crackling under a kettle . That too is pointless .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	7	8	The end of something is better than its beginning . Patience is better than arrogance .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	7	9	Don ’ t be too quick to get angry because anger lives in the fool ’ s heart .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	7	10	Don ’ t ask , “ How is it that the former days were better than these ? ” because it isn ’ t wise to ask this .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	7	11	Wisdom is as good as [ a ] an inheritance— an advantage for those who see the sun .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	7	12	Wisdom ’ s protection is like the protection of money ; the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom preserves the lives of its possessors . Good times and bad
CEB	Ecclesiastes	7	13	Consider God ’ s work ! Who can straighten what God has made crooked ?
CEB	Ecclesiastes	7	14	When times are good , enjoy the good ; when times are bad , consider : God has made the former as well as the latter so that people can ’ t discover anything that will come to be after them .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	7	15	I have seen everything in my pointless lifetime : the righteous person may die in spite of their righteousness ; then again , the wicked may live long in spite of their wickedness .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	7	16	Don ’ t be too righteous or too wise , or you may be dumbfounded . [ b ]
CEB	Ecclesiastes	7	17	Don ’ t be too wicked and don ’ t be a fool , or you may die before your time .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	7	18	It ’ s good that you take hold of one of these without letting go of the other because the one who fears God will go forth with both .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	7	19	Wisdom makes a wise person stronger than ten rulers who are in a city .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	7	20	Remember : there ’ s no one on earth so righteous as to do good only and never make a mistake . [ c ]
CEB	Ecclesiastes	7	21	Don ’ t worry about all the things people say , so you don ’ t hear your servant cursing you .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	7	22	After all , you know that you ’ ve often cursed others yourself ! Life is complicated
CEB	Ecclesiastes	7	23	I tested all of this by wisdom . I thought , I will be wise , but it eluded me .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	7	24	All that happens is elusive and utterly unfathomable . Who can grasp it ?
CEB	Ecclesiastes	7	25	I turned my mind to know , to investigate , and to seek wisdom , along with an account of things , to know that wickedness is foolishness and folly is madness .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	7	26	I found one woman more bitter than death : she who is a trap , her heart a snare , her hands shackles . Anyone who pleases God escapes her , but a sinner is trapped by her .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	7	27	See , this is what I found , says the Teacher , examining one matter after another to account for things .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	7	28	But there ’ s something that I constantly searched for but couldn ’ t find : I found one man among a thousand , but I couldn ’ t find a woman among any of these . [ d ]
CEB	Ecclesiastes	7	29	See , this alone I found : God made human beings straightforward , but they search for many complications . Footnotes - Ecclesiastes 7:11 Or Wisdom is good with - Ecclesiastes 7:16 Or destroyed - Ecclesiastes 7:20 Or and never sin - Ecclesiastes 7:28 Heb uncertain
CEB	Ecclesiastes	8	8	No one has control over the life-breath , [ b ] to retain it , and there ’ s no control over the day of death . There ’ s no release from war , and wickedness won ’ t deliver those who practice it .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	8	2	Keep [ a ] the king ’ s command as you would keep a solemn pledge .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	8	3	Don ’ t be dismayed ; leave his presence . Don ’ t linger in a harmful situation because he can do whatever he wants !
CEB	Ecclesiastes	8	4	Because the king ’ s word has authority , no one can say to him , “ What are you doing ? ”
CEB	Ecclesiastes	8	5	Whoever keeps a command will meet no harm , and the wise heart knows the right time and the right way
CEB	Ecclesiastes	8	6	because there ’ s a right time and right way for every matter . But human misfortunes are overwhelming
CEB	Ecclesiastes	8	7	because no one knows what will happen , and no one can say when something might happen .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	8	9	I observed all of this as I paid attention to all that happens under the sun . Sometimes people exercise power over each other to their detriment .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	8	10	Then I saw the wicked brought to their graves , with people processing from a holy place , [ c ] while those who had lived honestly were neglected in the city . This too is pointless .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	8	11	The condemnation for wicked acts isn ’ t carried out quickly ; that ’ s why people dare to do evil .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	8	12	Wrongdoers may commit a hundred crimes but still live long lives . But I also know that it will go well for those who fear God , for those who are reverent before God .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	8	13	But it will not go well for the wicked ; they won ’ t live long at all because they aren ’ t reverent before God .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	8	14	Here ’ s another thing that happens on earth that is pointless : the righteous get what the wicked deserve , and the wicked get what the righteous deserve . I say that this too is pointless . Enjoy life
CEB	Ecclesiastes	8	15	So I commend enjoyment because there ’ s nothing better for people to do under the sun but to eat , drink , and be glad . This is what will accompany them in their hard work , during the lifetime that God gives under the sun .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	8	16	Then I set my mind to know wisdom and to observe the business that happens on earth , even going without sleep day and night
CEB	Ecclesiastes	8	17	I observed all the work of God—that no one can grasp what happens under the sun . Those who strive to know can ’ t grasp it . Even the wise who are set on knowing are unable to grasp it . Footnotes - Ecclesiastes 8:2 Correction ; Heb I ( say ? ) keep - Ecclesiastes 8:8 Or wind - Ecclesiastes 8:10 Or temple
CEB	Ecclesiastes	9	9	Enjoy life with your dearly loved spouse all the days of your pointless life that God [ b ] gives you under the sun—all the days of your pointless life ! [ c ] —because that ’ s your part to play [ d ] in this life and in your hard work under the sun .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	9	2	Everything is the same for everyone . The same fate awaits the righteous and the wicked , the good and the bad , [ a ] the pure and the impure , those who sacrifice and those who don ’ t sacrifice . The good person is like the wrongdoer ; the same holds for those who make solemn pledges and those who are afraid to swear .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	9	3	This is the sad thing about all that happens under the sun : the same fate awaits everyone . Moreover , the human heart is full of evil ; people ’ s minds are full of madness while they are alive , and afterward they die .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	9	4	Whoever is among the living can be certain about this . A living dog is definitely better off than a dead lion ,
CEB	Ecclesiastes	9	5	because the living know that they will die . But the dead know nothing at all . There is no more reward for them ; even the memory of them is lost .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	9	6	Their love and their hate , as well as their zeal , are already long gone . They will never again have a stake in all that happens under the sun .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	9	7	Go , eat your food joyfully and drink your wine happily because God has already accepted what you do .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	9	8	Let your garments always be white ; don ’ t run short of oil for your head .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	9	10	Whatever you are capable of doing , do with all your might because there ’ s no work , thought , knowledge , or wisdom in the grave , [ e ] which is where you are headed . Listen to common wisdom , not fools
CEB	Ecclesiastes	9	11	I also observed under the sun that the race doesn ’ t always go to the swift , nor the battle to the mighty , nor food to the wise , nor wealth to the intelligent , nor favor to the knowledgeable , because accidents can happen to anyone .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	9	12	People most definitely don ’ t know when their time will come . Like fish tragically caught in a net or like birds trapped in a snare , so are human beings caught in a time of tragedy that suddenly falls to them .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	9	13	I also observed the following example of wisdom under the sun—it impressed me greatly :
CEB	Ecclesiastes	9	14	There was a small town with only a few residents . A mighty king came against it , surrounded it , and waged a terrible war against it .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	9	15	Now there lived in that town a poor but wise man who saved everyone by his wisdom . But no one remembered that poor man .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	9	16	So I thought , Wisdom is better than might , but the wisdom of commoners is despised and their words aren ’ t heeded .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	9	17	The calm words of the wise are better heeded than the racket caused by a ruler among fools .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	9	18	Wisdom is better than weapons of war , but one incompetent person destroys much good .

CEB	Ecclesiastes	10	10	If an ax is dull and one doesn ’ t sharpen it first , then one must exert more force . It ’ s profitable to be skillful and wise .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	10	2	The mind of the wise tends toward the right , but the mind of the fool toward the left .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	10	3	Fools lack all sense even when they walk down the street ; they show everyone that they are fools .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	10	4	If a ruler ’ s temper rises against you , don ’ t leave your post , because calmness alleviates great offenses .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	10	5	There ’ s an evil that I have seen under the sun : the kind of mistake that comes from people in power .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	10	6	Fools are appointed to high posts , while the rich sit in lowly positions .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	10	7	I have seen slaves on horseback , while princes walk on foot like slaves .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	10	8	Whoever digs a pit may fall into it , and whoever breaks through a wall may be bitten by a snake .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	10	9	Whoever quarries stones may be injured by them ; whoever splits logs may be endangered by them .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	10	11	If a snake bites before it ’ s charmed , then there ’ s no profit for the snake charmer .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	10	12	Words from a wise person ’ s mouth are beneficial , but fools are devoured by their own lips .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	10	13	Fools start out talking foolishness and end up speaking awful nonsense .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	10	14	Fools talk too much ! No one knows what will happen ; no one can say what will happen in the future .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	10	15	The hard work of fools tires them out because they don ’ t even know the way to town !
CEB	Ecclesiastes	10	16	Too bad for you , land , whose king is a boy and whose princes feast in the morning .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	10	17	Happy is the land whose king is dignified and whose princes feast at the right time for energy , not for drunkenness .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	10	18	Through laziness , the roof sags ; through idle hands , the house leaks .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	10	19	Feasts are made for laughter , wine cheers the living , and money answers everything . [ a ]
CEB	Ecclesiastes	10	20	Don ’ t curse a king even in private ; don ’ t curse the rich in your bedroom , because a bird could carry your voice ; some winged creature could report what you said ! Footnotes - Ecclesiastes 10:19 Or money is everyone 's answer .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	11	11	Send your bread out on the water because , in the course of time , you may find it again .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	11	2	Give a portion to seven people , even to eight : you don ’ t know what disaster may come upon the land .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	11	3	If clouds fill up , they will empty out rain on the earth . If a tree falls , whether to the south or to the north , wherever it falls , there it will lie .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	11	4	Those who watch the wind blow will never sow , and those who observe the clouds will never reap .
CEB	Ecclesiastes	11	5	Just as you don ’ t understand what the life-breath does in the fetus [ a ] inside a pregnant woman ’ s womb , so you can ’ t understand the work of God , who makes everything happen .

CEB	Ecclesiastes	11	8	Even those who live many years should take pleasure in them all . But they should be mindful that there will also be many dark days . Everything that happens is pointless .

CEB	Isaiah	3	17	the Lord will shave the heads of Zion ’ s daughters , and will expose their scalps .
CEB	Isaiah	3	18	On that day , the Lord will remove : the splendid ankle chains ; headbands and moon-shaped pendants ;

CEB	Isaiah	5	5	Now let me tell you what I ’ m doing to my vineyard . I ’ m removing its hedge , so it will be destroyed . I ’ m breaking down its walls , so it will be trampled .

CEB	Isaiah	5	10	Ten acres of vineyard will produce just one bath , [ b ] and a homer of seed will produce only an ephah .
CEB	Isaiah	5	11	Doom to those who wake up early in the morning to run after beer , to those who stay up late , lit up by wine .
CEB	Isaiah	5	12	They party with lyre and harp , tambourine , flute , and wine ; but they ignore the Lord ’ s work ; they can ’ t see what God is doing .
CEB	Isaiah	5	13	Therefore , my people go into exile since they didn ’ t understand— their officials are dying of hunger ; so many of them are dried up with thirst .
CEB	Isaiah	5	14	Therefore , the grave [ c ] opens wide its jaws , opens its mouth beyond all bounds , and the splendid multitudes will go down , with all their uproar and cheering .
CEB	Isaiah	5	15	Humanity will be humiliated ; each person laid low , the eyes of the exalted laid low .
CEB	Isaiah	5	16	But the Lord of heavenly forces will be exalted in justice , and the holy God will show himself holy in righteousness .
CEB	Isaiah	5	17	Lambs will graze as if in their pasture ; young goats [ d ] will feed among the ruins of the rich . [ e ]

CEB	Isaiah	5	23	who spare the guilty for bribes , and rob the innocent of their rights .
CEB	Isaiah	5	24	Therefore , as a tongue of fire devours stubble , and as hay shrivels in a flame , so their roots will rot , and their blossoms turn to dust , for they have rejected the teaching of the Lord of heavenly forces , and have despised the word of Israel ’ s holy one . God ’ s powerful hand
CEB	Isaiah	5	25	This is why the Lord ’ s anger burned against the people : he extended his hand to strike them , the mountains trembled , and their corpses lay in the middle of the streets like dung . Even then God ’ s anger didn ’ t turn away ; God ’ s hand was still extended .
CEB	Isaiah	5	26	God will raise a signal to a nation from far away and whistle to them from the end of the earth— now look—hurrying , swiftly they come !
CEB	Isaiah	5	27	Not one is tired ; not one stumbles ; they don ’ t rest or sleep ; no belt is loose ; no sandal broken ;
CEB	Isaiah	5	28	their arrows are sharp ; all their bows drawn ; their horses ’ hooves are like flint ; their wheels like the whirlwind .
CEB	Isaiah	5	29	Their roaring is like the lion ; they roar like young lions ; they growl , seize their prey , and carry it off , with no one to rescue .
CEB	Isaiah	5	30	On that day , they will roar over it like the roaring of the sea . And if one looks toward the land , there ’ s darkness . Tyre and the Nile will be darkened by the clouds .

CEB	Isaiah	6	6	Then one of the winged creatures flew to me , holding a glowing coal that he had taken from the altar with tongs .
CEB	Isaiah	6	2	Winged creatures were stationed around him . Each had six wings : with two they veiled their faces , with two their feet , and with two they flew about .
CEB	Isaiah	6	3	They shouted to each other , saying : “ Holy , holy , holy is the Lord of heavenly forces ! All the earth is filled with God ’ s glory ! ”
CEB	Isaiah	6	4	The doorframe shook at the sound of their shouting , and the house was filled with smoke .
CEB	Isaiah	6	5	I said , “ Mourn for me ; I ’ m ruined ! I ’ m a man with unclean lips , and I live among a people with unclean lips . Yet I ’ ve seen the king , the Lord of heavenly forces ! ”
CEB	Isaiah	6	7	He touched my mouth and said , “ See , this has touched your lips . Your guilt has departed , and your sin is removed. ”
CEB	Isaiah	6	8	Then I heard the Lord ’ s voice saying , “ Whom should I send , and who will go for us ? ” I said , “ I ’ m here ; send me. ”
CEB	Isaiah	6	9	God said , “ Go and say to this people : Listen intently , but don ’ t understand ; look carefully , but don ’ t comprehend .
CEB	Isaiah	6	10	Make the minds of this people dull . Make their ears deaf and their eyes blind , so they can ’ t see with their eyes or hear with their ears , or understand with their minds , and turn , and be healed. ”
CEB	Isaiah	6	11	I said , “ How long , Lord ? ” And God said , “ Until cities lie ruined with no one living in them , until there are houses without people and the land is left devastated. ”
CEB	Isaiah	6	12	The Lord will send the people far away , and the land will be completely abandoned .
CEB	Isaiah	6	13	Even if one-tenth remain there , they will be burned again , like a terebinth or an oak , which when it is cut down leaves a stump . Its stump is a holy seed .
CEB	Isaiah	7	7	But the Lord God says : It won ’ t happen ; it won ’ t take place .
CEB	Isaiah	7	2	When the house of David was told that Aram had become allies with Ephraim , their hearts and the hearts of their people shook as the trees of a forest shake when there is a wind .
CEB	Isaiah	7	3	But the Lord said to Isaiah , “ Go out to meet Ahaz , you and your son Shear-jashub , [ a ] at the end of the channel of the Upper Pool , by the road to the field where laundry is washed ,
CEB	Isaiah	7	4	and say to him , ‘ Be careful and stay calm . Don ’ t fear , and don ’ t lose heart over these two pieces of smoking torches , over the burning anger of Rezin , Aram , and Remaliah ’ s son .
CEB	Isaiah	7	5	Aram has planned evil against you with Ephraim and Remaliah ’ s son , saying ,
CEB	Isaiah	7	6	“ Let ’ s march up against Judah , tear it apart , capture it for ourselves , and install Tabeel ’ s son as its king. ”
CEB	Isaiah	7	8	The chief of Aram is Damascus ; the chief of Damascus is Rezin ( in sixty-five more years Ephraim will be shattered as a nation ) ;
CEB	Isaiah	7	9	the chief of Ephraim is Samaria ; and the chief of Samaria is the son of Remaliah . If you don ’ t believe this , you can ’ t be trusted. ’ ” The sign of Immanuel
CEB	Isaiah	7	10	Again the Lord spoke to Ahaz :
CEB	Isaiah	7	11	“ Ask a sign from the Lord your God . Make it as deep as the grave [ b ] or as high as heaven. ”
CEB	Isaiah	7	12	But Ahaz said , “ I won ’ t ask ; I won ’ t test the Lord. ”
CEB	Isaiah	7	13	Then Isaiah said , “ Listen , house of David ! Isn ’ t it enough for you to be tiresome for people that you are also tiresome before my God ?
CEB	Isaiah	7	14	Therefore , the Lord will give you a sign . The young woman is pregnant and is about to give birth to a son , and she will name him Immanuel . [ c ]
CEB	Isaiah	7	15	He will eat butter and honey , and learn to reject evil and choose good .
CEB	Isaiah	7	16	Before the boy learns to reject evil and choose good , the land of the two kings you dread will be abandoned .
CEB	Isaiah	7	17	The Lord will bring upon you , upon your people , and upon your families days unlike any that have come since the day Ephraim broke away from Judah—the king of Assyria. ” The devastated land
CEB	Isaiah	7	18	On that day , the Lord will whistle for the flies from the remotest streams of Egypt and for the bees that are in the land of Assyria .
CEB	Isaiah	7	19	They will come and settle in the steep ravines , in the cracks of the cliffs , in all the thornbushes , and in all the watering holes .
CEB	Isaiah	7	20	On that day , the Lord will shave with a razor hired from beyond the Euphrates—with the king of Assyria—the head and the pubic hair , and will cut off the beard as well .
CEB	Isaiah	7	21	On that day , one will raise a young cow and two sheep
CEB	Isaiah	7	22	and will eat butter because of the abundance of milk , for all who remain in the land will eat butter and honey .
CEB	Isaiah	7	23	On that day , there will be thorns and thistles in every place where a thousand vines worth a thousand silver shekels once grew .
CEB	Isaiah	7	24	Only those with bows and arrows will go there , because the entire land will become thorns and thistles .
CEB	Isaiah	7	25	As for the hills that were once farmed with hoes , you won ’ t go there for fear of the thorns and thistles . They will become places where cattle are turned loose and sheep wander .

CEB	Isaiah	8	8	and sweep into Judah , flooding , overflowing , and reaching up to the neck . But God is with us ; [ d ] the span of his wings will cover the width of the land .
CEB	Isaiah	8	2	Summon trusted people , Uriah the priest and Zechariah , Jeberechiah ’ s son , to witness it. ”
CEB	Isaiah	8	3	I then had sex with the prophetess , and she became pregnant and gave birth to a son . Then the Lord said to me , “ Name him Maher-shalal-hash-baz .
CEB	Isaiah	8	4	Before the boy knows how to say ‘ my father ’ and ‘ my mother , ’ the wealth of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria will be carried away before the king of Assyria. ”
CEB	Isaiah	8	5	The Lord spoke again to me :
CEB	Isaiah	8	6	Since this people has rejected the waters of Shiloah that flow gently , and instead rejoices over [ c ] Rezin and Remaliah ’ s son—
CEB	Isaiah	8	7	therefore , look , the Lord is raising up against them the powerful floodwaters of the Euphrates , the king of Assyria and all his glory . It will rise up over all its channels , overflowing all its banks ,
CEB	Isaiah	8	9	Unite [ e ] yourselves , peoples , and be shattered ! Listen , all distant places of the earth ! Prepare to be shattered ! Prepare to be shattered !
CEB	Isaiah	8	10	Create a plan , but be frustrated ! Speak a word , but it won ’ t stand , for God is with us . [ f ]
CEB	Isaiah	8	11	The Lord spoke to me , taking hold of me and warning me not to walk in the way of this people :
CEB	Isaiah	8	12	Don ’ t call conspiracy all that this people calls conspiracy . Don ’ t fear what they fear , and don ’ t be terrified .
CEB	Isaiah	8	13	It is the Lord of heavenly forces whom you should hold sacred , whom you should fear , and whom you should hold in awe .
CEB	Isaiah	8	14	God will become a sanctuary— but he will be a stone to trip over and a rock to stumble on for the two houses of Israel ; a trap and a snare for those living in Jerusalem .
CEB	Isaiah	8	15	Many of them will stumble and fall , and be broken , snared , and captured .
CEB	Isaiah	8	16	Bind up the testimony ; seal up the teaching among my disciples .
CEB	Isaiah	8	17	I will wait for the Lord , who has hidden his face from the house of Jacob , and I will hope in God .
CEB	Isaiah	8	18	Look ! I and the children the Lord gave me are signs and wonders in Israel from the Lord of heavenly forces , who lives on Mount Zion .
CEB	Isaiah	8	19	If they say to you : “ Consult the ghosts and the spirits that chirp and mutter . ( Shouldn ’ t a people consult its gods ? ) Consult the dead on behalf of the living
CEB	Isaiah	8	20	for instruction and for testimony ” —they will surely say such things , but they will never see the dawn . [ g ]
CEB	Isaiah	8	21	They will pass through the land , [ h ] dejected and hungry , and when they are hungry , they will be enraged and will curse their king and God . They will turn toward heaven
CEB	Isaiah	8	22	and look to the earth , but they will see only distress and darkness , random movement , and the anguish and doom of banishment .

CEB	Isaiah	9	9	the people all knew it— Ephraim and the one who rules in Samaria . But with a proud and arrogant heart they said ,
CEB	Isaiah	9	2	[ c ] The people walking in darkness have seen a great light . On those living in a pitch-dark land , light has dawned .
CEB	Isaiah	9	3	You have made the nation great ; you have increased its joy . They rejoiced before you as with joy at the harvest , as those who divide plunder rejoice .
CEB	Isaiah	9	4	As on the day of Midian , you ’ ve shattered the yoke that burdened them , the staff on their shoulders , and the rod of their oppressor .
CEB	Isaiah	9	5	Because every boot of the thundering warriors , and every garment rolled in blood will be burned , fuel for the fire .
CEB	Isaiah	9	6	A child is born to us , a son is given to us , and authority will be on his shoulders . He will be named Wonderful Counselor , Mighty God , Eternal Father , Prince of Peace .
CEB	Isaiah	9	7	There will be vast authority and endless peace for David ’ s throne and for his kingdom , establishing and sustaining it with justice and righteousness now and forever . The zeal of the Lord of heavenly forces will do this . God ’ s hand still stretched out
CEB	Isaiah	9	8	The Lord sent a word against Jacob ; it fell upon Israel ;
CEB	Isaiah	9	10	“ Bricks have fallen , but let ’ s rebuild with stones . Sycamores were cut down , but let ’ s replace them with cedars. ”
CEB	Isaiah	9	11	So the Lord raised up their foes against them , [ d ] and stirred up their enemies—
CEB	Isaiah	9	12	Aram from the east and the Philistines from the west— and they devoured Israel with an open mouth . Even then God ’ s anger didn ’ t turn away ; God ’ s hand was still extended .
CEB	Isaiah	9	13	But the people didn ’ t turn to the one who struck them . They didn ’ t seek the Lord of heavenly forces .
CEB	Isaiah	9	14	So the Lord cut off head and tail , palm branch and reed from Israel in one day .
CEB	Isaiah	9	15	( Elders and celebrities are the head ; prophets who teach lies are the tail . )
CEB	Isaiah	9	16	But this people ’ s leaders were misleading , and those being led were confused .
CEB	Isaiah	9	17	So the Lord showed their youth no pity , and showed their orphans and widows no mercy ; for everyone was godless and evil ; every mouth spoke nonsense . Even then God ’ s anger didn ’ t turn away ; God ’ s hand was still extended .
CEB	Isaiah	9	18	Wickedness burned like fire , devouring thorn and thistle . It kindled the thickets of the forest ; they swirled in rising smoke .
CEB	Isaiah	9	19	The land was scorched by the rage of the Lord of heavenly forces ; the people were like fuel for the fire . Not one person pitied another :
CEB	Isaiah	9	20	they consumed on the right , but remained hungry ; devoured on the left , and weren ’ t satisfied . They devoured the flesh of their own children . [ e ]
CEB	Isaiah	9	21	Manasseh devoured Ephraim and Ephraim Manasseh ; together they turned against Judah . Even then God ’ s anger didn ’ t turn away ; God ’ s hand was still extended .

CEB	Isaiah	10	10	Just as I took control of idolatrous kingdoms with more images than Jerusalem and Samaria ,
CEB	Isaiah	10	2	to deprive the needy of their rights and to rob the poor among my people of justice ; to make widows their loot ; to steal from orphans !
CEB	Isaiah	10	3	What will you do on the day of punishment when disaster comes from far away ? To whom will you flee for help ; where will you stash your wealth ?
CEB	Isaiah	10	4	How will you avoid crouching among the prisoners and falling among the slain ? Even so , God ’ s anger hasn ’ t turned away ; God ’ s hand is still extended . Assyria as God ’ s punishing weapon
CEB	Isaiah	10	5	Doom to Assyria , rod of my anger , in whose hand is the staff of my fury !
CEB	Isaiah	10	6	Against a godless nation I send him ; against an infuriating people I direct him to seize spoil , to steal plunder , and to trample them like mud in the streets .
CEB	Isaiah	10	7	But he has other plans ; he schemes in secret ; destruction is on his mind , extermination of nation after nation .
CEB	Isaiah	10	8	He says : Aren ’ t my commanders all kings ?
CEB	Isaiah	10	9	Isn ’ t Calno like Carchemish ? Isn ’ t Hamath like Arpad ? Isn ’ t Samaria like Damascus ?
CEB	Isaiah	10	11	just as I did to Samaria and her false gods , won ’ t I also do this to Jerusalem and her idols ?
CEB	Isaiah	10	12	But when the Lord has finished all this work on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem , he will punish [ a ] the Assyrian king ’ s arrogant actions and the boasting of his haughty eyes .
CEB	Isaiah	10	13	He said , “ By my own strength I have achieved it , and by my wisdom , since I ’ m so clever . I disregarded national boundaries ; I raided their treasures ; I knocked down their rulers like a bull .
CEB	Isaiah	10	14	My hand found the wealth of the peoples as if it were in a nest . Just as one gathers abandoned eggs , I have gathered the entire earth ; no creature fluttered a wing or opened a mouth to chirp. ”
CEB	Isaiah	10	15	Will the ax glorify itself over the one who chops with it ? Or will the saw magnify itself over its user ? As if a rod could wave the one who lifts it ! As if a staff could lift up the one not made of wood !
CEB	Isaiah	10	16	Therefore , the Lord God of heavenly forces will make the well-fed people waste away ; and among his officials , a blaze will burn like scorching fire .
CEB	Isaiah	10	17	The light of Israel will become a fire , its holy one a flame , which will burn and devour its thorns and thistles in a single day .
CEB	Isaiah	10	18	Its abundant forest and farmland will be finished completely , [ b ] as when a sick person wastes away ;
CEB	Isaiah	10	19	its forest ’ s remaining trees will be no more than a child can count . A few will return
CEB	Isaiah	10	20	On that day , what ’ s left of Israel and the survivors of the house of Jacob will no longer depend on the one who beat them . Instead , they will faithfully depend on the Lord , the holy one of Israel .
CEB	Isaiah	10	21	A few will return , what ’ s left of Jacob , to the mighty God .
CEB	Isaiah	10	22	Although your people , Israel , were like the sand of the sea , only a few survivors will return . The end is announced , overflowing with justice .
CEB	Isaiah	10	23	Yes , destruction has been announced ; the Lord God of heavenly forces will carry it out against the entire land .
CEB	Isaiah	10	24	Therefore , the Lord God of heavenly forces says : My people who live in Zion , don ’ t fear Assyria , which strikes you with the rod and raises its staff against you as Egypt did .
CEB	Isaiah	10	25	In a very short time my fury will end , and my anger at the world will be finished . [ c ]
CEB	Isaiah	10	26	Therefore , the Lord of heavenly forces will crack a whip against Assyria , as when he struck Midian at the rock of Oreb . He will raise a rod over the sea , as he did in Egypt .
CEB	Isaiah	10	27	On that day , God will remove the burden from your shoulder and destroy the yoke on your neck . [ d ] The exalted laid low He has gone up from Samaria ,
CEB	Isaiah	10	28	come against Aiath , passed to Migron . At Michmash he stored his equipment .
CEB	Isaiah	10	29	They crossed at the pass : “ We ’ ll camp at Geba ! ” Ramah trembles ; Gibeah of Saul has fled .
CEB	Isaiah	10	30	Cry aloud , Daughter Gallim ! Listen , Laishah ! Answer her , Anathoth !
CEB	Isaiah	10	31	Madmenah has flown . Gebim ’ s inhabitants sought refuge .
CEB	Isaiah	10	32	This very day he will stand at Nob and shake his fist [ e ] at Daughter Zion ’ s mountain , the hill of Jerusalem !
CEB	Isaiah	10	33	Look ! The Lord God of heavenly forces is chopping off the branches with terrible power . The loftiest ones are about to be cut down and the exalted laid low .

CEB	Isaiah	11	2	The Lord ’ s spirit will rest upon him , a spirit of wisdom and understanding , a spirit of planning and strength , a spirit of knowledge and fear of the Lord .
CEB	Isaiah	11	3	He will delight in fearing the Lord . He won ’ t judge by appearances , nor decide by hearsay .
CEB	Isaiah	11	4	He will judge the needy with righteousness , and decide with equity for those who suffer in the land . He will strike the violent [ b ] with the rod of his mouth ; by the breath of his lips he will kill the wicked .
CEB	Isaiah	11	5	Righteousness will be the belt around his hips , and faithfulness the belt around his waist .
CEB	Isaiah	11	6	The wolf will live with the lamb , and the leopard will lie down with the young goat ; the calf and the young lion will feed [ c ] together , and a little child will lead them .
CEB	Isaiah	11	7	The cow and the bear will graze . Their young will lie down together , and a lion will eat straw like an ox .
CEB	Isaiah	11	8	A nursing child will play over the snake ’ s hole ; toddlers will reach right over the serpent ’ s den .
CEB	Isaiah	11	9	They won ’ t harm or destroy anywhere on my holy mountain . The earth will surely be filled with the knowledge of the Lord , just as the water covers the sea . A signal to the peoples
CEB	Isaiah	11	10	On that day , the root of Jesse will stand as a signal to the peoples . The nations will seek him out , and his dwelling will be glorious .
CEB	Isaiah	11	12	God will raise a signal for the nations and gather the outcast men of Israel . God will collect the dispersed women of Judah from the four corners of the earth .
CEB	Isaiah	11	13	Ephraim ’ s jealousy will cease , and Judah ’ s harassment will be eliminated . Ephraim won ’ t be jealous of Judah , and Judah won ’ t harass Ephraim .
CEB	Isaiah	11	14	But they will swoop down on the slopes of Philistia to the west ; together they will plunder the people to the east . Edom and Moab will be under their power , and the Ammonites will be their subjects .
CEB	Isaiah	11	15	The Lord will split the tongue of the Egyptian sea . God will wave a hand over the Euphrates with a powerful [ e ] wind and break it into seven streams so that it can be crossed in sandals .

CEB	Isaiah	13	14	They will be like hunted gazelles , like sheep without a shepherd ; all will turn to their own people and flee to their own lands .

CEB	Isaiah	14	16	Those who see you will stare at you ; they will examine you closely : “ Is this the man who rattled the earth , who shook kingdoms ,

CEB	Isaiah	23	13	Look at the land of the Chaldeans , the people who are no more . Assyria destined it for wild animals : they raised up their siege towers , stripped its palaces , and made it a ruin .

CEB	Isaiah	27	9	By this Jacob ’ s guilt is reconciled , and this was how his sins were finally removed : he made all the altar stones like shattered chalk , sacred poles [ e ] and incense altars that couldn ’ t stand .
CEB	Isaiah	27	10	The fortified city lies alone , a hut forsaken , abandoned like the desert . Calves graze there ; they lie down there and feed on its boughs .
CEB	Isaiah	27	11	When its branches are dry , they are broken . Women come and set fire to it . These people have no understanding ; therefore , their maker won ’ t have compassion ; the one who formed them won ’ t be gracious .
CEB	Isaiah	27	12	On that day , the Lord will beat grain from the channel of the Euphrates up to the Valley of Egypt . You will be collected , Israelites , one by one .
CEB	Isaiah	27	13	On that day , a great trumpet will be played . Those who were lost in the land of Assyria and those who were scattered in the land of Egypt will come . They will bow to the Lord at his holy mountain in Jerusalem .

CEB	Isaiah	28	28	Bread grain is crushed , but the thresher [ m ] doesn ’ t thresh it forever . He drives the cart wheel over it ; he spreads it out but doesn ’ t crush it .
CEB	Isaiah	28	2	Look ! The Lord has someone who is powerful and strong ; like a hailstorm , a disastrous tempest , like a downpour of mighty , overflowing waters , he can level them to the ground with his hand .
CEB	Isaiah	28	3	The majestic garland of Ephraim ’ s drunks will be trampled underfoot .
CEB	Isaiah	28	4	The withered flower , which is a thing of beauty [ b ] as it sits on the head of those bloated with fat , [ c ] will be like an early fig before the summer harvest : whoever sees it swallows it as soon as it is in hand .
CEB	Isaiah	28	5	On that day , the Lord of heavenly forces will be a splendid garland and a beautiful wreath for the people who survive ,
CEB	Isaiah	28	6	and a spirit of justice for the one who sits in judgment , and a strength for those who repel the assault at the gate .
CEB	Isaiah	28	7	These also stagger from wine and stumble from beer : priest and prophet stagger from beer ; they are confused by wine ; they stray on account of beer ; they err when receiving visions ; they stumble when making judgments .
CEB	Isaiah	28	8	All the tables are covered with vomit ; filth overruns the place .
CEB	Isaiah	28	9	To whom will God teach knowledge ? To whom will he explain the message ? To those just weaned from milk ? To those who have hardly outgrown the breast ?
CEB	Isaiah	28	10	It is “ tsav letsav , tsav letsav ; qav leqav , qav leqav , ” [ d ] a little of this , a little of that .
CEB	Isaiah	28	11	With derisive speech and a foreign tongue , he will speak to this people .
CEB	Isaiah	28	12	He has said to them , “ This is the place of rest ; give rest to the weary ; this is the place of repose ” ; but they refused to listen .
CEB	Isaiah	28	13	So the Lord ’ s word will be for them : “ tsav letsav , tsav letsav ; qav leqav , qav leqav , ” a little of this , a little of that . So that they will go and stagger backward , they will be broken , snared , and captured . The covenant with death overturned
CEB	Isaiah	28	14	Therefore , hear the Lord ’ s word , you scoffers who rule this people in Jerusalem .
CEB	Isaiah	28	15	You said , “ We ’ ve cut a deal with death ; [ e ] with the underworld [ f ] we made a pact . When the overflowing flood passes through , it won ’ t reach us ; for we have made lies our hiding place , and in falsehood we take shelter. ”
CEB	Isaiah	28	16	Therefore , the Lord God says : Look ! I ’ m laying in Zion a stone , a tested stone , a valuable cornerstone , a sure foundation : the one who trusts won ’ t tremble .
CEB	Isaiah	28	17	I will make justice the measuring line and righteousness the plumb line . But hail will sweep away the hiding place of lies , and water will overflow the shelter .
CEB	Isaiah	28	18	Your deal with death [ g ] will be dissolved , and your pact with the grave [ h ] won ’ t stand . The rushing flood : when it passes through , you will be annihilated by it .
CEB	Isaiah	28	19	Every time it passes through it will take you , for morning by morning it will pass , by day and by night . It will be nothing but terror to understand the message .
CEB	Isaiah	28	20	The bed is too short to stretch out , and the shroud is too narrow to cover oneself .
CEB	Isaiah	28	21	Just as on Mount Perazim , the Lord will rise up ; as in the Gibeon Valley he will rage to do his deed—strange is his deed ! — And to work his work—foreign is his work !
CEB	Isaiah	28	22	So now stop your scoffing , or your chains will be tightened , because destruction has been ordered—I have heard it ! — by the Lord God of heavenly forces against the whole land . Plowing and threshing
CEB	Isaiah	28	23	Listen and hear my voice ; pay attention and hear my word :
CEB	Isaiah	28	24	Does the plowman plow without stopping for planting , opening and harrowing their ground ?
CEB	Isaiah	28	25	When he has smoothed its surface , doesn ’ t he scatter fennel , [ i ] and sow cumin , and plant wheat and barley in their places , and spelt as a border ?
CEB	Isaiah	28	26	They are properly ordered ; their God directs them . [ j ]
CEB	Isaiah	28	27	Fennel [ k ] isn ’ t threshed with a threshing sledge , nor is a cart wheel rolled over cumin , but fennel [ l ] is beaten with a staff , and cumin with a rod .
CEB	Isaiah	28	29	This also comes from the Lord of heavenly forces , who gives wondrous counsel and increases wisdom .

CEB	Isaiah	29	29	Oh , Ariel , Ariel , town where David encamped ! Year by year , let the festivals come around—
CEB	Isaiah	29	2	but I will oppress Ariel . There will be mourning and lamentation ; she will be like an Ariel to me .
CEB	Isaiah	29	3	I will surround you like a wall , and I will lay a siege against you with assault towers , and I will raise up siegeworks against you .
CEB	Isaiah	29	4	You will be brought down ; from the ground you will speak ; from low in the dust your speech will come . Your voice will be like a ghost ’ s from the earth ; from the dust your words will whisper .
CEB	Isaiah	29	5	But your many enemies will be like fine dust , the terrible horde like passing chaff . Suddenly , in an instant ,
CEB	Isaiah	29	6	the Lord of heavenly forces will come to you with thunder , earthquake , and a mighty voice , with whirlwind , tempest , and flames of devouring fire .
CEB	Isaiah	29	7	The horde of nations fighting against Ariel , and all who make war on her and her fortress and besiege her , will be like a dream , a vision of the night .
CEB	Isaiah	29	8	It will be like when a hungry person dreams of eating but wakes up and the mouth is empty . Or when a thirsty person dreams of drinking but wakes up and has a dry throat . So will it be for all the horde of nations who fight against Mount Zion .
CEB	Isaiah	29	9	Be shocked and stunned ; blind yourselves ; be blind ! Be drunk , but not on wine ; stagger , but not on account of beer !
CEB	Isaiah	29	10	The Lord has poured on you a spirit of deep sleep , and has shut your eyes , you prophets , and covered your heads , you seers .
CEB	Isaiah	29	11	This entire vision has become for you like the words of a sealed scroll . When they give it to one who can read , saying , “ Read this , ” that one will say , “ I can ’ t , because it ’ s sealed. ”
CEB	Isaiah	29	12	And when the scroll is given to one who can ’ t read , saying , “ Read this , ” that one will say , “ I can ’ t read. ” The wisdom of their wise
CEB	Isaiah	29	13	The Lord says : Since these people turn toward me with their mouths , and honor me with lip service while their heart is distant from me , and their fear of me is just a human command that has been memorized ,
CEB	Isaiah	29	14	I will go on doing amazing things to these people , shocking and startling things . The wisdom of their wise will perish , and the discernment of their discerning will be hidden .
CEB	Isaiah	29	15	Doom to those who hide their plan deep , away from the Lord , whose deeds are in the dark , who say , “ Who sees us ? Who knows us ? ”
CEB	Isaiah	29	16	You have everything backward ! Should the potter be thought of as clay ? Should what is made say of its maker , “ He didn ’ t make me ” ? Should what is shaped say of the one who shaped it , “ He doesn ’ t understand ” ?
CEB	Isaiah	29	17	In just a little while won ’ t Lebanon become farmland once again , and the farmland be considered a forest ?
CEB	Isaiah	29	18	On that day : The deaf will hear the words of a scroll and , freed from dimness and darkness , the eyes of the blind will see .
CEB	Isaiah	29	19	The poor will again find joy in the Lord , and the neediest of people will rejoice in the holy one of Israel .
CEB	Isaiah	29	20	The tyrant will be no more , the mocker will perish , and all who plot evil will be eliminated :
CEB	Isaiah	29	21	all who incriminate others wrongly , who entrap the judge in the gate , and pointlessly postpone justice for the innocent .
CEB	Isaiah	29	22	Therefore , proclaims the Lord , the God of [ a ] the house of Jacob , who redeemed Abraham : Jacob won ’ t be ashamed now , and his face won ’ t grow pale now .
CEB	Isaiah	29	23	When he sees his children among them , the work of my hands , proclaiming my name holy , they will make holy the holy one of Jacob , and stand in awe of Israel ’ s God .
CEB	Isaiah	29	24	Those who wander in spirit will have understanding , and those who grumble will gain insight . Footnotes - Isaiah 29:22 Or to
CEB	Isaiah	30	30	The Lord will unleash his majestic voice and display his crushing arm in furious anger , with a flame of consuming fire , in stormy rain and hail .
CEB	Isaiah	30	2	setting out to go down to Egypt without consulting me , taking refuge in Pharaoh ’ s refuge and hiding in Egypt ’ s shadow .
CEB	Isaiah	30	3	Pharaoh ’ s refuge will become your shame , hiding in Egypt ’ s shadow your disgrace .
CEB	Isaiah	30	4	Though their officials are in Zoan , and their messengers reach Hanes ,
CEB	Isaiah	30	5	all will become shamed because of a people who can ’ t assist them . They are no help ; they are no profit ; rather , shame and disgrace .
CEB	Isaiah	30	6	An oracle about the beasts in the arid southern plain . Through a land of distress and danger , lioness and roaring [ b ] lion , viper and flying serpent , they will carry their wealth on donkeys ’ shoulders and their treasures on camels ’ humps to a people who won ’ t profit ,
CEB	Isaiah	30	7	for Egypt ’ s help is utterly worthless . Therefore , I call her Rahab Who Sits Still . [ c ]
CEB	Isaiah	30	8	Now go , write it before them on a tablet , inscribe it on a scroll , so in the future it will endure as a witness .
CEB	Isaiah	30	9	These are rebellious people , lying children , children unwilling to hear the Lord ’ s teaching ,
CEB	Isaiah	30	10	who say to the seers , “ Don ’ t foresee , ” and to the visionaries , “ Don ’ t report truthful visions ; tell us flattering things ; envision deceptions ;
CEB	Isaiah	30	11	get out of the way ; step off the path ; let ’ s have no more ‘ holy one of Israel. ’ ”
CEB	Isaiah	30	12	Therefore , the holy one of Israel says : Because you reject this word and trust in oppression and cunning and rely on them ,
CEB	Isaiah	30	13	your sin will be like a crack in a high wall ; it bulges , about to fall : suddenly , in an instant , it breaks !
CEB	Isaiah	30	14	Its breaking is like the breaking of a storage jar that is totally shattered . No piece from among its fragments will be large enough to take fire from a hearth , or to dip water from a cistern .
CEB	Isaiah	30	15	Therefore , the Lord God , the holy one of Israel , says : In return and rest you will be saved ; quietness and trust will be your strength— but you refused .
CEB	Isaiah	30	16	You said , “ No ! We ’ ll flee on horses ” — therefore , you will indeed flee— “ and we ’ ll ride off ; on swift steeds we will ride ” — therefore , your pursuers will be swift .
CEB	Isaiah	30	17	One thousand will flee at the threat of one , and at the threat of five you will flee , until you are left like a flagstaff on a mountaintop , like a flag on a hill .
CEB	Isaiah	30	18	Nonetheless , the Lord is waiting to be merciful to you , and will rise up to show you compassion . The Lord is a God of justice ; happy are all who wait for him . This is the way
CEB	Isaiah	30	19	People in Zion , who live in Jerusalem , you will weep no longer . God will certainly be merciful to you . Hearing the sound of your outcry , God will answer you .
CEB	Isaiah	30	20	Though the Lord gives you the bread of distress and the water of oppression , your teacher will no longer hide , but you will see your teacher .
CEB	Isaiah	30	21	If you stray to the right or the left , you will hear a word that comes from behind you : “ This is the way ; walk in it. ”
CEB	Isaiah	30	22	You will defile your silver-plated idols and your gold-covered priestly vest , [ d ] and you will scatter them like menstrual rags . “ Get out , ” you will say to them .
CEB	Isaiah	30	23	God will provide rain for the seed you sow in the ground , and the food the ground produces will be rich and abundant . On that day , your cattle will graze in large pastures .
CEB	Isaiah	30	24	The oxen and donkeys that are working the ground will eat tasty feed spread for them with shovel and fork .
CEB	Isaiah	30	25	On every lofty mountain , and on every high hill , streams will run with water on the day of the great massacre , when the towers fall .
CEB	Isaiah	30	26	The light of the moon will be like the light of the sun , and the light of the sun will be seven times brighter—like the light of seven days—on the day that the Lord bandages the people ’ s brokenness and heals the wounds inflicted by his blows . Assyria punished
CEB	Isaiah	30	27	Look there ! The Lord is coming from far away ; his anger blazing , his smoke-cloud thick . His lips are full of fury ; his tongue is like a devouring fire .
CEB	Isaiah	30	28	His breath is like a raging river that reaches up to the neck , to shake the nations with a sieve of destruction , and to put a misleading rein on the people ’ s jaws .
CEB	Isaiah	30	29	There will be singing for you as on the night that people celebrate a festival . The heart will be joyful as it is when one goes with a flute to the Lord ’ s mountain , to the rock of Israel .
CEB	Isaiah	30	31	The Lord ’ s voice will terrify Assyria ; with a rod he will smite it .
CEB	Isaiah	30	32	And every crack that is made in the foundation wall , which the Lord will bring down upon him , will be accompanied by timbrels and lyres . The Lord will raise his arm and fight against Assyria in battle .
CEB	Isaiah	30	33	His place for burning [ e ] was arranged long ago ; it is indeed made ready for a king . God has made its wood pile wide and deep , fire and wood in abundance . The breath of the Lord , like a stream of brimstone , ignites it .

CEB	Isaiah	31	31	Doom to those going down to Egypt for help ! They rely on horses , trust in chariots because they are many , and on riders because they are very strong . But they don ’ t look to the holy one of Israel ; they don ’ t seek the Lord .
CEB	Isaiah	31	2	But God also knows how to bring disaster ; he has not taken back his words . God will rise up against the house of evildoers and against the help of those who do wrong .
CEB	Isaiah	31	3	Egypt is human and not divine ; their horses are flesh and not spirit . The Lord will extend his hand ; the helper will stumble , those helped will fall , and they will all die together .
CEB	Isaiah	31	4	The Lord has said to me : When the lion growls , the young lion , over its prey , though a band of shepherds is summoned against it , isn ’ t scared off by their noise or frightened by their roar . So the Lord of heavenly forces will go down to fight on Mount Zion and on her hill .
CEB	Isaiah	31	5	Like birds flying aloft , so the Lord of heavenly forces will shield Jerusalem : shielding and saving , sparing and rescuing .
CEB	Isaiah	31	6	People of Israel , return to the one whom you have deeply betrayed !
CEB	Isaiah	31	7	On that day , you will each reject the idols of silver and the idols of gold , which you have sinfully made for yourselves .
CEB	Isaiah	31	8	Assyria will fall , but not by a human sword— a sword not made by humans will devour them . They will flee before the sword ; their young men will become forced laborers .
CEB	Isaiah	31	9	In horror they will flee from their stronghold ; their officers will be terrified at the signal , says the Lord , whose fire is in Zion and whose oven is in Jerusalem .
CEB	Isaiah	32	32	See here : A king rules to promote righteousness ; rulers govern to promote justice ,
CEB	Isaiah	32	2	each like a shelter from the wind and a refuge from a storm , like streams of water in a wasteland , like the shade of a massive cliff in a worn-out land .
CEB	Isaiah	32	3	Then the eyes of those who can see will no longer be blind , the ears of those who can hear will listen ,
CEB	Isaiah	32	4	the minds of the rash will know and comprehend , and the tongues of those who stammer will speak fluently and plainly .
CEB	Isaiah	32	5	Then a fool will no longer be called honorable , nor a villain considered respectable .
CEB	Isaiah	32	6	Fools speak folly ; their minds devise wickedness , acting irreverently , speaking falsely of the Lord , leaving the hungry empty , and depriving the thirsty of drink .
CEB	Isaiah	32	7	As for the villain , his villainies are evil . He plans schemes to destroy the poor with lying words , even when the needy speak justly .
CEB	Isaiah	32	8	But an honorable person plans honorable things and stands up for what is honorable . Warnings to the carefree
CEB	Isaiah	32	9	Women of leisure , stand up ! Hear my voice ! Carefree daughters , listen to my word !
CEB	Isaiah	32	10	In a little over a year , the carefree will shudder , because the grape harvest will fail ; the vintage won ’ t arrive .
CEB	Isaiah	32	11	Tremble , all of you who are at ease ; shudder , all of you who are secure ! Strip yourselves , bare your skin , and tie mourning clothes around your waist ,
CEB	Isaiah	32	12	beating your breasts for the pleasant fields , for the fruitful vine ,
CEB	Isaiah	32	13	for my people ’ s soil growing barbs and thorns , for all the joyous houses in the jubilant town .
CEB	Isaiah	32	14	The palace will be deserted , the crowded city abandoned . Stronghold and watchtower will become empty fields forever , suited for the pleasure of wild donkeys , and a pasture for flocks—
CEB	Isaiah	32	15	until a spirit from on high is poured out on us , and the desert turns into farmland , and the farmland is considered a forest .
CEB	Isaiah	32	16	Then justice will reside in wild lands , and righteousness will abide in farmlands .
CEB	Isaiah	32	17	The fruit of righteousness will be peace , and the outcome of righteousness , calm and security forever .
CEB	Isaiah	32	18	Then my people will live in a peaceful dwelling , in secure homes , in carefree resting places .
CEB	Isaiah	32	19	Even if the forest falls [ a ] and the humbled city is laid low ,
CEB	Isaiah	32	20	those who sow beside any stream will be happy , sending out ox and donkey to graze . Footnotes - Isaiah 32:19 Or it will hail when the forest falls

CEB	Isaiah	33	2	Lord , show us favor ; we hope in you . Be our strength every morning , our salvation in times of distress .
CEB	Isaiah	33	3	At the noise , peoples fled ; on account of your roar , nations scattered .
CEB	Isaiah	33	4	They gathered spoil like insects ; they rushed upon it like a swarm of locusts . [ a ]
CEB	Isaiah	33	5	The Lord is exalted ; he lives on high , filling Zion with justice and righteousness .
CEB	Isaiah	33	6	He will provide security during a lifetime : [ b ] a source of salvation , wisdom , and knowledge— fear of the Lord will be Zion ’ s treasure . [ c ]
CEB	Isaiah	33	7	But then those in Ariel [ d ] cried out in the streets ; messengers of peace wept bitterly .
CEB	Isaiah	33	8	The highways were deserted ; travelers left the road . The covenant was broken ; solemn pledges [ e ] were rejected ; no one cared for humanity .
CEB	Isaiah	33	9	The land mourned ; it wasted away ; Lebanon was ashamed ; it withered . Sharon became like the desert , and Bashan and Carmel were dropping their leaves .
CEB	Isaiah	33	10	Now I will arise , says the Lord . Now I will exalt myself ; now I will stand tall .
CEB	Isaiah	33	11	You conceive straw , give birth to stubble ; your breath is a fire that devours you .
CEB	Isaiah	33	12	Peoples will be burned to lime , thorns cut up and set ablaze .
CEB	Isaiah	33	13	You who are far away , hear what I have done ; and you who are near , know my strength !
CEB	Isaiah	33	14	Sinners became terrified in Zion ; trembling seized the godless : “ Who among us can live with the devouring fire ? Who among us can live with the everlasting blaze ? ”
CEB	Isaiah	33	15	The one who walks righteously and speaks truthfully , who rejects profit from extortion , who waves away a bribe instead of grabbing it , who won ’ t listen to bloody plots , and who won ’ t contemplate doing something evil .
CEB	Isaiah	33	16	He will live on the heights ; fortresses in the cliffs will be his refuge . His food will be provided , his water guaranteed .
CEB	Isaiah	33	17	When you gaze upon a king in his glamour and look at the surrounding land ,
CEB	Isaiah	33	18	in dismay you will think : Where is the one who counts ? Where is the one who weighs ? Where is the one who counts towers ?
CEB	Isaiah	33	19	You will no longer see the defiant people , the people of speech too obscure to understand , who stammer in an incomprehensible language .
CEB	Isaiah	33	20	Gaze upon Zion , our festival town . Your eyes will see Jerusalem , a carefree dwelling , a tent that is not packed up , whose stakes are never pulled up , whose ropes won ’ t snap .
CEB	Isaiah	33	21	The Lord ’ s majesty will be there for us : as a place of rivers , broad streams where no boat will go , no majestic ship will cross .
CEB	Isaiah	33	22	The Lord is our judge ; the Lord is our leader ; the Lord is our king— he will deliver us .
CEB	Isaiah	33	23	Your ropes are loosened ; they can ’ t hold the mast firmly ; they can ’ t spread the sail . Then abundant spoil will be divided ; even the lame will seize spoil .
CEB	Isaiah	33	24	And no inhabitant will say , “ I ’ m sick. ” The people living there will be forgiven their sin .

CEB	Isaiah	34	12	No Kingdom There , they will call it , and all its princes will disappear .

CEB	Isaiah	36	6	It appears that you are trusting in a staff—Egypt—that ’ s nothing but a broken reed ! It will stab the hand of anyone who leans on it ! That ’ s all that Pharaoh , Egypt ’ s king , is to anyone who trusts in him .
CEB	Isaiah	36	7	Now suppose you say to me , ‘ We trust in the Lord our God. ’ Isn ’ t he the one whose shrines and altars Hezekiah removed , telling Judah and Jerusalem , ‘ You must worship only at this altar ’ ?
CEB	Isaiah	36	8	“ So now , make a wager with my master , Assyria ’ s king . I ’ ll give you two thousand horses if you can supply the riders !
CEB	Isaiah	36	9	How will you drive back even the least important official among my master ’ s servants when you are relying on Egypt for chariots and riders ?
CEB	Isaiah	36	10	What ’ s more , do you think I ’ ve marched against this place to destroy it without the Lord ’ s support ? It was the Lord who told me , ‘ March against this land and destroy it ! ’ ”
CEB	Isaiah	36	11	Eliakim , Shebna , and Joah said to the field commander , “ Please speak to your servants in Aramaic , because we understand it . Don ’ t speak with us in Hebrew , [ a ] because the people on the wall will hear it. ”
CEB	Isaiah	36	12	The field commander said to them , “ Did my master send me to speak these words just to you and your master and not also to the men on the wall ? They are the ones who will have to eat their dung and drink their urine along with you. ”
CEB	Isaiah	36	13	Then the field commander stood up and shouted in Hebrew at the top of his voice : “ Listen to the message of the great king , Assyria ’ s king .
CEB	Isaiah	36	14	The king says this : Don ’ t let Hezekiah lie to you . He won ’ t be able to rescue you .
CEB	Isaiah	36	15	Don ’ t let Hezekiah persuade you to trust the Lord by saying , ‘ The Lord will certainly rescue us . This city won ’ t be handed over to Assyria ’ s king. ’
CEB	Isaiah	36	16	“ Don ’ t listen to Hezekiah , because this is what Assyria ’ s king says : Surrender to me and come out . Then each of you will eat from your own vine and fig tree and drink water from your own well
CEB	Isaiah	36	17	until I come to take you to a land just like your land . It will be a land of grain and new wine , a land of bread and vineyards .
CEB	Isaiah	36	18	Don ’ t let Hezekiah fool you by saying , ‘ The Lord will rescue us. ’ Did any of the other gods of the nations save their lands from the power of Assyria ’ s king ?
CEB	Isaiah	36	19	Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad ? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim ? Did they rescue Samaria from my power ?
CEB	Isaiah	36	20	Which one of the gods from those countries has rescued their land from my power ? Will the Lord save Jerusalem from my power ? ”
CEB	Isaiah	36	21	But they kept quiet and didn ’ t answer him with a single word , because King Hezekiah ’ s command was , “ Don ’ t answer him ! ”
CEB	Isaiah	36	22	Hilkiah ’ s son Eliakim , who was the palace administrator , Shebna the secretary , and Asaph ’ s son Joah the recorder came to Hezekiah with ripped clothes . They told him what the field commander had said . Footnotes - Isaiah 36:11 MT Judean , so also 36:13
CEB	Isaiah	37	37	So Assyria ’ s King Sennacherib left and went back to Nineveh , where he stayed .
CEB	Isaiah	37	2	He sent Eliakim the palace administrator , Shebna the secretary , and the senior priests to the prophet Isaiah , Amoz ’ s son . They were all wearing mourning clothes .
CEB	Isaiah	37	3	They said to him , “ Hezekiah says this : Today is a day of distress , punishment , and humiliation . It ’ s as if children are ready to be born , but there ’ s no strength to see it through .
CEB	Isaiah	37	4	Perhaps the Lord your God heard all the words of the field commander who was sent by his master , Assyria ’ s king . He insulted the living God ! Perhaps he will punish him for the words that the Lord your God has heard . Offer up a prayer for those few people who still survive. ”
CEB	Isaiah	37	5	When King Hezekiah ’ s servants got to Isaiah ,
CEB	Isaiah	37	6	Isaiah said to them , “ Say this to your master : The Lord says this : Don ’ t be afraid at the words you heard , which the officers of Assyria ’ s king have used to insult me .
CEB	Isaiah	37	7	I ’ m about to mislead him , so when he hears a rumor , he ’ ll go back to his own country . Then I ’ ll have him cut down by the sword in his own land. ”
CEB	Isaiah	37	8	The field commander heard that the Assyrian king had left Lachish . So he went back to the king and found him attacking Libnah .
CEB	Isaiah	37	9	Then the Assyrian king learned that Cush ’ s King Tirhakah was on his way to fight against him . So he sent messengers to Hezekiah again :
CEB	Isaiah	37	10	“ Say this to Judah ’ s King Hezekiah : Don ’ t let the God you trust deceive you by saying , ‘ Jerusalem won ’ t fall to the Assyrian king. ’
CEB	Isaiah	37	11	You yourself have heard what Assyrian kings do to other countries , wiping them out . Is it likely that you will be saved ?
CEB	Isaiah	37	12	Did the gods of the nations that my ancestors destroyed save them , the gods of Gozan , Haran , Rezeph , or the people of Eden in Telassar ?
CEB	Isaiah	37	13	Where now is Hamath ’ s king , Arpad ’ s king , or the kings of Lair , Sepharvaim , Hena , or Ivvah ? ” [ a ] Hezekiah prays
CEB	Isaiah	37	14	Hezekiah took the letters from the messengers and read them . Then he went to the temple and spread them out before the Lord .
CEB	Isaiah	37	15	Hezekiah prayed to the Lord :
CEB	Isaiah	37	16	“ Lord of heavenly forces , God of Israel : you sit enthroned on the winged creatures . You alone are God over all the earth ’ s kingdoms . You made both heaven and earth .
CEB	Isaiah	37	17	Lord , turn your ear this way and hear ! Lord , open your eyes and see ! Listen to Sennacherib ’ s words . He sent them to insult the living God !
CEB	Isaiah	37	18	It ’ s true , Lord , that the Assyrian kings have destroyed all the nations and their lands .
CEB	Isaiah	37	19	The Assyrians burned the gods of those nations with fire because they aren ’ t real gods . They are only man-made creations of wood and stone . That ’ s how the Assyrians could destroy them .
CEB	Isaiah	37	20	So now , Lord our God , please save us from Sennacherib ’ s power ! Then all the earth ’ s kingdoms will know that you alone are Lord. ”
CEB	Isaiah	37	21	Then Isaiah , Amoz ’ s son , sent a message to Hezekiah : The Lord God of Israel says this : Since you prayed to me about Assyria ’ s King Sennacherib ,
CEB	Isaiah	37	22	this is the message that the Lord has spoken against him : The young woman , Daughter Zion , despises you and mocks you ; Daughter Jerusalem shakes her head behind your back .
CEB	Isaiah	37	23	Whom did you insult and ridicule ? Against whom did you raise your voice and look on with disdain ? It was against the holy one of Israel !
CEB	Isaiah	37	24	With your servants , you ’ ve insulted the Lord ; you said , “ I , with my many chariots , have gone up to the highest mountains , to the farthest reaches of Lebanon . I have cut down its tallest cedars , the best of its pine trees . I have reached its most remote lodging place , its best forest .
CEB	Isaiah	37	25	I have dug wells , have drunk water in foreign lands . [ b ] With my own feet , I dried up all of Egypt ’ s streams. ”
CEB	Isaiah	37	26	Haven ’ t you heard ? I set this up long ago ; I planned it in the distant past ! Now I have made it happen , making fortified cities collapse into piles of rubble .
CEB	Isaiah	37	27	Their citizens have lost their power ; they are frightened and dismayed . They ’ ve become like plants in a field , tender green shoots , the grass on rooftops , blasted by the east wind .
CEB	Isaiah	37	28	I know where you are , how you go out and come in , and how you rage against me .
CEB	Isaiah	37	29	Because you rage against me and because your pride has reached my ears , I will put my hook in your nose and my bit in your mouth . I will make you go back the same way you came .
CEB	Isaiah	37	30	Now this will be the sign for you , Hezekiah : This year you will eat what grows by itself . Next year you will eat what grows from that . But in the third year , plant seed and harvest it ; plant vineyards and eat their fruit .
CEB	Isaiah	37	31	The survivors of Judah ’ s family who have escaped will put down roots and bear fruit above .
CEB	Isaiah	37	32	Those who remain will go out from Jerusalem , and those who survive will go out from Mount Zion . The zeal of the Lord of heavenly forces will do this .
CEB	Isaiah	37	33	Therefore , the Lord says this about Assyria ’ s king : He won ’ t enter this city . He won ’ t shoot a single arrow here . He won ’ t come near the city with a shield . He won ’ t build a ramp to besiege it .
CEB	Isaiah	37	34	He ’ ll go back by the same way he came . He won ’ t enter this city , declares the Lord .
CEB	Isaiah	37	35	I will defend this city and save it for my sake and for the sake of my servant David .
CEB	Isaiah	37	36	The Lord ’ s messenger went out and struck down one hundred eighty-five thousand soldiers in the Assyrian camp . When people got up the next morning , there were dead bodies everywhere .
CEB	Isaiah	37	38	Later , while he was worshipping in the temple of his god Nisroch , his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer killed him with a sword . Then they escaped to the land of Ararat . His son Esarhaddon ruled after him .

CEB	Isaiah	38	38	At about that time Hezekiah became deathly sick . The prophet Isaiah , Amoz ’ s son , came to him and said : “ The Lord God says this : Put your affairs in order because you are about to die . You won ’ t survive this. ”
CEB	Isaiah	38	2	Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the Lord :
CEB	Isaiah	38	3	“ Please , Lord , remember how I ’ ve walked before you in truth and sincerity . I ’ ve done what you consider to be good. ” Then Hezekiah cried and cried .
CEB	Isaiah	38	4	Then the Lord ’ s word came to Isaiah :
CEB	Isaiah	38	5	“ Go and say to Hezekiah : The Lord , the God of your ancestor David , says this : I have heard your prayer and have seen your tears . I will add fifteen years to your life .
CEB	Isaiah	38	6	I will rescue you and this city from the power of the Assyrian king . I will defend this city .
CEB	Isaiah	38	7	This will be your sign from the Lord that he will do what he promised :
CEB	Isaiah	38	8	once the shadow cast by the sun descends on the steps of Ahaz , I will make it back up ten steps. ” And the sun went back ten of the steps that it had already descended .
CEB	Isaiah	38	9	A composition by Judah ’ s King Hezekiah when he was sick and then recovered from his sickness :
CEB	Isaiah	38	10	I thought , I must depart in the prime of my life ; I have been relegated to the gates of the underworld [ a ] for the rest of my life .
CEB	Isaiah	38	11	I thought , I won ’ t see the Lord . The Lord is in the land of the living . I won ’ t look upon humans again or be with the inhabitants of the world .
CEB	Isaiah	38	12	My lifetime is plucked up and taken from me like a shepherd ’ s tent . My life is shriveled like woven cloth ; God cuts me off from the loom . Between daybreak and nightfall you carry out your verdict against me .
CEB	Isaiah	38	13	I cried out [ b ] until morning : “ Like a lion God crushes all my bones . Between daybreak and nightfall you carry out your verdict against me .
CEB	Isaiah	38	14	Like a swallow [ c ] I chirp ; I moan like a dove . My eyes have grown weary looking to heaven . Lord , I ’ m overwhelmed ; support me ! ”
CEB	Isaiah	38	15	What can I say ? God has spoken to me ; he himself has acted . I will wander [ d ] my whole life with a bitter spirit .
CEB	Isaiah	38	16	The Lord Most High is the one who gives life to every heart , who gives life to the spirit ! [ e ]
CEB	Isaiah	38	17	Look , he indeed exchanged my bitterness for wholeness . [ f ] You yourself have spared [ g ] my whole being from the pit of destruction , because you have cast all my sins behind your back .
CEB	Isaiah	38	18	The underworld [ h ] can ’ t thank you , nor can death [ i ] praise you ; those who go down to the pit can ’ t hope for your faithfulness .
CEB	Isaiah	38	19	The living , the living can thank you , as I do today . Parents will tell children about your faithfulness .
CEB	Isaiah	38	20	The Lord has truly saved me , and we will make music [ j ] at the Lord ’ s house all the days of our lives .
CEB	Isaiah	38	21	Then Isaiah said , “ Prepare a salve made from figs , put it on the swelling , and he ’ ll get better. ”
CEB	Isaiah	38	22	Hezekiah said to Isaiah , “ What ’ s the sign that I ’ ll be able to go up to the Lord ’ s temple ? ” Footnotes - Isaiah 38:10 Heb Sheol - Isaiah 38:13 Or I lay down - Isaiah 38:14 Heb uncertain - Isaiah 38:15 Heb uncertain - Isaiah 38:16 Heb uncertain - Isaiah 38:17 Heb uncertain - Isaiah 38:17 Cf LXX , Vulg ; MT loved - Isaiah 38:18 Heb Sheol - Isaiah 38:18 Heb Maveth - Isaiah 38:20 Or my stringed instruments
CEB	Isaiah	39	39	At that time , Babylon ’ s King Merodach-baladan , Baladan ’ s son , sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah , for he heard that he had been ill and had recovered .
CEB	Isaiah	39	2	Hezekiah was pleased , and he showed them his treasury—the silver and the gold , the spices and fine oil—and everything in his armory , all that was found in his storerooms . There wasn ’ t a thing in his house or in all his realm that Hezekiah didn ’ t show them .
CEB	Isaiah	39	3	Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah and said to him , “ What did these men say ? Where did they come from ? ” Hezekiah replied , “ They came to me from a distant land , from Babylon. ”
CEB	Isaiah	39	4	So Isaiah said , “ What did they see in your house ? ” Hezekiah said , “ They saw everything in my house . There was nothing in my storerooms that I didn ’ t show them. ”
CEB	Isaiah	39	5	Isaiah said to Hezekiah , “ Hear the word of the Lord of heavenly forces :
CEB	Isaiah	39	6	Days are coming when all that is in your house , which your ancestors have stored up until this day , will be carried to Babylon . Nothing will be left , says the Lord .
CEB	Isaiah	39	7	Some of your sons , your own descendants whom you fathered , will be taken to become eunuchs in the king of Babylon ’ s palace. ”
CEB	Isaiah	39	8	Hezekiah said to Isaiah , “ The Lord ’ s word that you delivered is good , ” since he thought , That means there will be peace and security in my lifetime .
CEB	Isaiah	40	40	Comfort , comfort my people ! says your God .
CEB	Isaiah	40	2	Speak compassionately to Jerusalem , and proclaim to her that her compulsory service has ended , that her penalty has been paid , that she has received from the Lord ’ s hand double for all her sins !
CEB	Isaiah	40	3	A voice is crying out : “ Clear the Lord ’ s way in the desert ! Make a level highway in the wilderness for our God !
CEB	Isaiah	40	4	Every valley will be raised up , and every mountain and hill will be flattened . Uneven ground will become level , and rough terrain a valley plain .
CEB	Isaiah	40	5	The Lord ’ s glory will appear , and all humanity will see it together ; the Lord ’ s mouth has commanded it. ”
CEB	Isaiah	40	6	A voice was saying : “ Call out ! ” And another [ a ] said , “ What should I call out ? ” All flesh is grass ; all its loyalty is like the flowers of the field .
CEB	Isaiah	40	7	The grass dries up and the flower withers when the Lord ’ s breath blows on it . Surely the people are grass .
CEB	Isaiah	40	8	The grass dries up ; the flower withers , but our God ’ s word will exist forever .
CEB	Isaiah	40	9	Go up on a high mountain , messenger Zion ! Raise your voice and shout , messenger Jerusalem ! Raise it ; don ’ t be afraid ; say to the cities of Judah , “ Here is your God ! ”
CEB	Isaiah	40	10	Here is the Lord God , coming with strength , with a triumphant arm , bringing his reward with him and his payment before him .
CEB	Isaiah	40	11	Like a shepherd , God will tend the flock ; he will gather lambs in his arms and lift them onto his lap . He will gently guide the nursing ewes . The incomparable God
CEB	Isaiah	40	12	Who has measured the waters in the palm of a hand or gauged the heavens with a ruler or scooped the earth ’ s dust up in a measuring cup or weighed the mountains on a scale and the hills in a balance ?
CEB	Isaiah	40	13	Who directed the Lord ’ s spirit and acted as God ’ s advisor ?
CEB	Isaiah	40	14	Whom did he consult for enlightenment ? Who taught him the path of justice and knowledge and explained to him the way of understanding ?
CEB	Isaiah	40	15	Look , the nations are like a drop in a bucket , and valued as dust on a scale . Look , God weighs the islands like fine dust .
CEB	Isaiah	40	16	Lebanon doesn ’ t have enough fuel ; its animals aren ’ t enough for an entirely burned offering .
CEB	Isaiah	40	17	All the nations are like nothing before God . They are viewed as less than nothing and emptiness .
CEB	Isaiah	40	18	So to whom will you equate God ; to what likeness will you compare him ?
CEB	Isaiah	40	19	An idol ? A craftsman pours it , a metalworker covers it with gold , and fashions silver chains .
CEB	Isaiah	40	20	The one who sets up an image chooses wood that won ’ t rot [ b ] and then seeks a skilled artisan to set up an idol that won ’ t move .
CEB	Isaiah	40	21	Don ’ t you know ? Haven ’ t you heard ? Wasn ’ t it announced to you from the beginning ? Haven ’ t you understood since the earth was founded ?
CEB	Isaiah	40	22	God inhabits the earth ’ s horizon— its inhabitants are like locusts— stretches out the skies like a curtain and spreads it out like a tent for dwelling .
CEB	Isaiah	40	23	God makes dignitaries useless and the earth ’ s judges into nothing .
CEB	Isaiah	40	24	Scarcely are they planted , scarcely sown , scarcely is their shoot rooted in the earth when God breathes on them , and they dry up ; the windstorm carries them off like straw .
CEB	Isaiah	40	25	So to whom will you compare me , and who is my equal ? says the holy one . Power for the weary
CEB	Isaiah	40	26	Look up at the sky and consider : Who created these ? The one who brings out their attendants one by one , summoning each of them by name . Because of God ’ s great strength and mighty power , not one is missing .
CEB	Isaiah	40	27	Why do you say , Jacob , and declare , Israel , “ My way is hidden from the Lord , my God ignores my predicament ” ?
CEB	Isaiah	40	28	Don ’ t you know ? Haven ’ t you heard ? The Lord is the everlasting God , the creator of the ends of the earth . He doesn ’ t grow tired or weary . His understanding is beyond human reach ,
CEB	Isaiah	40	29	giving power to the tired and reviving the exhausted .
CEB	Isaiah	40	30	Youths will become tired and weary , young men will certainly stumble ;
CEB	Isaiah	40	31	but those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength ; they will fly up on wings like eagles ; they will run and not be tired ; they will walk and not be weary . Footnotes - Isaiah 40:6 MT ; DSS ( 1QIsaa ) , LXX I - Isaiah 40:20 Heb uncertain
CEB	Isaiah	41	41	Be quiet before me , coastlands . Let the nations renew their strength . Let them approach and speak . Let ’ s draw near for a judgment .
CEB	Isaiah	41	2	Who has awakened one from the east and has authority to summon him to serve— giving him nations , conquering kings , making them like dust with his sword , like scattered straw with his bow ?
CEB	Isaiah	41	3	He pursues them and passes untouched , needing no path for his feet .
CEB	Isaiah	41	4	Who has acted and who has done this , calling upon generation after generation since the beginning ? I , the Lord , was first , and I will be the last !
CEB	Isaiah	41	5	The coastlands see and fear ; the ends of the earth tremble ; they draw near and arrive .
CEB	Isaiah	41	6	Each helps the other , each saying to the other , “ Take courage ! ”
CEB	Isaiah	41	7	The craftsman encourages the metalworker ; the one who smoothes with the hammer encourages the one who strikes the anvil , saying of the welding , “ That ’ s good , ” and strengthening it with nails so it won ’ t move . Israel as God ’ s servant
CEB	Isaiah	41	8	But you , Israel my servant , Jacob , whom I have chosen , offspring of Abraham , whom I love ,
CEB	Isaiah	41	9	you whom I took from the ends of the earth and called from its farthest corners , saying to you , “ You are my servant ; I chose you and didn ’ t reject you ” :
CEB	Isaiah	41	10	Don ’ t fear , because I am with you ; don ’ t be afraid , for I am your God . I will strengthen you , I will surely help you ; I will hold you with my righteous strong hand .
CEB	Isaiah	41	11	All who rage against you will be shamed and disgraced . Those who contend with you will be as nothing and will perish .
CEB	Isaiah	41	12	You will look for your opponents , and won ’ t find them . Those who fight you will be of no account and will die .
CEB	Isaiah	41	13	I am the Lord your God , who grasps your strong hand , who says to you , Don ’ t fear ; I will help you .
CEB	Isaiah	41	14	Don ’ t fear , worm of Jacob , people of Israel ! I will help you , says the Lord . The holy one of Israel is your redeemer .
CEB	Isaiah	41	15	Look , I ’ ve made you into a new threshing tool with sharp teeth . You will thresh mountains and pulverize them ; you will reduce hills to straw .
CEB	Isaiah	41	16	When you winnow them , the wind will carry them off ; the tempest will scatter them . You will rejoice in the Lord and take pride in the holy one of Israel .
CEB	Isaiah	41	17	The poor and the needy seek water , and there is none ; their tongues are parched with thirst . I , the Lord , will respond to them ; I , the God of Israel , won ’ t abandon them .
CEB	Isaiah	41	18	I will open streams on treeless hilltops and springs in valleys . I will make the desert into ponds and dry land into cascades of water .
CEB	Isaiah	41	19	I will plant in the desert cedar , acacia , myrtle , and olive trees ; I will put in the wilderness cypress , elm , and pine as well ,
CEB	Isaiah	41	20	so that they will see and know and observe and comprehend that the Lord ’ s hand has done this , and the holy one of Israel has created it . Other gods challenged
CEB	Isaiah	41	21	Present your case , says the Lord . Bring forward your evidence , says Jacob ’ s king .
CEB	Isaiah	41	22	Let the idols [ a ] approach and tell us what will happen . The prior things—what are they ? Announce them , and we ’ ll think about them and know their significance . Or proclaim to us what is to come !
CEB	Isaiah	41	23	Report things that will happen in the future , then we ’ ll know that you are gods . Do good ! Or do bad ! Then we will all be afraid and fearful .
CEB	Isaiah	41	24	Look ! You are nobody , and your deeds are nothing . Whoever chooses you is disgusting .
CEB	Isaiah	41	25	I woke up one from the north and he came ; from the east , one who calls my name . He tramples governors like mud , as a potter treads clay .
CEB	Isaiah	41	26	Who announced this from the start so that we would know ; from an earlier time so we would say , “ That ’ s right ” ? Truly , no one announced it , no one proclaimed it , and no one heard your words .
CEB	Isaiah	41	27	I first said it to Zion , “ Look , here they are ” ; to Jerusalem I now send a herald .
CEB	Isaiah	41	28	But I look , and there ’ s no one among them , no counselor ; and when I ask , no one can answer .
CEB	Isaiah	41	29	Look , all of them are frauds ; their deeds amount to nothing ; their images are a total delusion . Footnotes - Isaiah 41:22 Or them
CEB	Isaiah	42	42	But here is my servant , the one I uphold ; my chosen , who brings me delight . I ’ ve put my spirit upon him ; he will bring justice to the nations .
CEB	Isaiah	42	2	He won ’ t cry out or shout aloud or make his voice heard in public .
CEB	Isaiah	42	3	He won ’ t break a bruised reed ; he won ’ t extinguish a faint wick , but he will surely bring justice .
CEB	Isaiah	42	4	He won ’ t be extinguished or broken until he has established justice in the land . The coastlands await his teaching .
CEB	Isaiah	42	5	God the Lord says— the one who created the heavens , the one who stretched them out , the one who spread out the earth and its offspring , the one who gave breath to its people and life to those who walk on it—
CEB	Isaiah	42	6	I , the Lord , have called you for a good reason . I will grasp your hand and guard you , and give you as a covenant to the people , as a light to the nations ,
CEB	Isaiah	42	7	to open blind eyes , to lead the prisoners from prison , and those who sit in darkness from the dungeon .
CEB	Isaiah	42	8	I am the Lord ; that is my name ; I don ’ t hand out my glory to others or my praise to idols .
CEB	Isaiah	42	9	The things announced in the past—look—they ’ ve already happened , but I ’ m declaring new things . Before they even appear , I tell you about them . Warrior and mother
CEB	Isaiah	42	10	Sing to the Lord a new song ! Sing his praise from the ends of the earth ! You who sail the sea and all that fills it , the coastlands and their residents .
CEB	Isaiah	42	11	Let the desert and its towns shout aloud , the villages that Kedar inhabits . Let the cliff dwellers sing ; from the top of the mountains let them shout .
CEB	Isaiah	42	12	Let them give the Lord glory and declare God ’ s praise in the coastlands .
CEB	Isaiah	42	13	The Lord will go out like a soldier ; like a warrior God will stir up rage . God will shout , will roar ; over enemies he will prevail .
CEB	Isaiah	42	14	I ’ ve kept still for a very long time . I ’ ve been silent and restrained myself . Like a woman in labor I will moan ; I will pant , I will gasp .
CEB	Isaiah	42	15	I will wither mountains and valleys , and I will dry up all their vegetation . I will turn rivers into deserts , [ a ] and I will dry up pools .
CEB	Isaiah	42	16	I will make the blind walk a road they don ’ t know , and I will guide them in paths they don ’ t know . But I will make darkness before them into light and rough places into level ground . These things I will do ; I won ’ t abandon them . Blindness and deafness
CEB	Isaiah	42	17	Turned backward , utterly shamed are those who trust in idols , who say to a cast image , “ You are our god ! ”
CEB	Isaiah	42	18	Hear , deaf ones , and blind ones , look and see !
CEB	Isaiah	42	19	Who is blind if not my servant and deaf like my messenger whom I send ? Who is blind like the restored one , [ b ] blind like the servant of the Lord ?
CEB	Isaiah	42	20	You have seen many things , but don ’ t keep watch . With ears open , you don ’ t hear . [ c ]
CEB	Isaiah	42	21	The Lord desired for the sake of his righteousness to expand and glorify the Instruction .
CEB	Isaiah	42	22	But this is a people plundered and looted , everyone trapped in holes and hidden in dungeons . They have become plunder with no one to rescue , loot with no one to say , “ Give it back. ”
CEB	Isaiah	42	23	Which of you will listen to this , will pay attention and respond from now on ?
CEB	Isaiah	42	24	Who gave Jacob to the looter , and Israel to the plunderers ? Wasn ’ t it the Lord , the one we sinned against ? They were not willing to walk in God ’ s ways , and wouldn ’ t listen to his teaching .
CEB	Isaiah	42	25	So God poured out on Jacob the heat of his anger and the fury of battle . It scorched him , and he didn ’ t know it ; it burned him , but he didn ’ t give it much thought .

CEB	Isaiah	43	2	When you pass through the waters , I will be with you ; when through the rivers , they won ’ t sweep over you . When you walk through the fire , you won ’ t be scorched and flame won ’ t burn you .
CEB	Isaiah	43	3	I am the Lord your God , the holy one of Israel , your savior . I have given Egypt as your ransom , Cush and Seba in your place .
CEB	Isaiah	43	4	Because you are precious in my eyes , you are honored , and I love you . I give people in your place , and nations in exchange for your life .
CEB	Isaiah	43	5	Don ’ t fear , I am with you . From the east I ’ ll bring your children ; from the west I ’ ll gather you .
CEB	Isaiah	43	6	I ’ ll say to the north , “ Give them back ! ” and to the south , “ Don ’ t detain them. ” Bring my sons from far away , and my daughters from the end of the earth ,
CEB	Isaiah	43	7	everyone who is called by my name and whom I created for my glory , whom I have formed and made .
CEB	Isaiah	43	8	Bring out the blind people who have eyes , the deaf ones who have ears .
CEB	Isaiah	43	9	All the nations are gathered together ; the peoples are assembled . Which of them announced this ? Who predicted to us the past events ? Let them bring their witnesses as a defense ; let them hear and say , “ It ’ s true ! ”
CEB	Isaiah	43	10	You are my witnesses , says the Lord , my servant , whom I chose , so that you would know and believe me and understand that I am the one . Before me no god was formed ; after me there has been no other .
CEB	Isaiah	43	11	I , I am the Lord , and there is no savior besides me .
CEB	Isaiah	43	12	I announced , I saved , I proclaimed , not some stranger among you . You are my witnesses , says the Lord , and I am God .
CEB	Isaiah	43	13	From the dawn of time , I am the one . No one can escape my power . I act , and who can undo it ? Don ’ t remember
CEB	Isaiah	43	14	The Lord your redeemer , the holy one of Israel , says , For your sake , I have sent an army [ a ] to Babylon , and brought down all the bars , turning the Chaldeans ’ singing into a lament . [ b ]
CEB	Isaiah	43	15	I am the Lord , your holy one , Israel ’ s creator , your king !
CEB	Isaiah	43	16	The Lord says—who makes a way in the sea and a path in the mighty waters ,
CEB	Isaiah	43	17	who brings out chariot and horse , army and battalion ; they will lie down together and will not rise ; they will be extinguished , extinguished like a wick .
CEB	Isaiah	43	18	Don ’ t remember the prior things ; don ’ t ponder ancient history .
CEB	Isaiah	43	19	Look ! I ’ m doing a new thing ; now it sprouts up ; don ’ t you recognize it ? I ’ m making a way in the desert , paths [ c ] in the wilderness .
CEB	Isaiah	43	20	The beasts of the field , the jackals and ostriches , will honor me , because I have put water in the desert and streams in the wilderness to give water to my people , my chosen ones ,
CEB	Isaiah	43	21	this people whom I formed for myself , who will recount my praise .
CEB	Isaiah	43	22	But you didn ’ t call out to me , Jacob ; you were tired of me , Israel .
CEB	Isaiah	43	23	You didn ’ t bring me lambs for your entirely burned offering ; you didn ’ t honor me with your sacrifices . I didn ’ t make you worship with offerings ; I didn ’ t weary you with frankincense .
CEB	Isaiah	43	24	You didn ’ t buy spices for me with your money , or satisfy me with the fat of your sacrifices . Instead , you have burdened me with your sins and wearied me with your evil actions .
CEB	Isaiah	43	25	I , I am the one who wipes out your rebellious behavior for my sake . I won ’ t remember your sin .
CEB	Isaiah	43	26	Summon me , and let ’ s go to trial together ; you tell your story so that you may be vindicated !
CEB	Isaiah	43	27	Your first ancestor sinned , and your officials rebelled against me .
CEB	Isaiah	43	28	So I made the holy officials impure , handed over Jacob to destruction and Israel to abuse . Footnotes - Isaiah 43:14 Heb lacks an army . - Isaiah 43:14 Heb uncertain - Isaiah 43:19 DSS ( 1QIsaa ) ; MT streams
CEB	Isaiah	44	44	But now hear this , Jacob my servant , and Israel , whom I have chosen .
CEB	Isaiah	44	2	The Lord your maker , who formed you in the womb and will help you , says : Don ’ t fear , my servant Jacob , Jeshurun , whom I have chosen .
CEB	Isaiah	44	3	I will pour out water upon thirsty ground and streams upon dry land . I will pour out my spirit upon your descendants and my blessing upon your offspring .
CEB	Isaiah	44	4	They will spring up from among the reeds like willows by flowing streams .
CEB	Isaiah	44	5	This one will say , “ I am the Lord ’ s , ” and that one will be named after Jacob . Another will write on his hand , “ The Lord ’ s ” and will take the name Israel .
CEB	Isaiah	44	6	The Lord , Israel ’ s king and redeemer , the Lord of heavenly forces , says : I am the first , and I am the last , and besides me there are no gods .
CEB	Isaiah	44	7	Who is like me ? Let them speak up , explain it , and lay it out for me . Who announced long ago what is to be ? [ a ] Let them tell us [ b ] what is to come .
CEB	Isaiah	44	8	Don ’ t tremble ; have no fear ! Didn ’ t I proclaim it ? Didn ’ t I inform you long ago ? You are my witnesses ! Is there a God besides me ? There is no other rock ; I know of none . Idol-makers mocked
CEB	Isaiah	44	9	Idol-makers are all as nothing ; their playthings do no good . Their promoters neither see nor know anything , so they ought to be ashamed .
CEB	Isaiah	44	10	Who would form a god or cast an idol that does no good ?
CEB	Isaiah	44	11	All its worshippers will be ashamed , and its artisans , who are only human . They will all gather and stand , tremble and be ashamed together .
CEB	Isaiah	44	12	A blacksmith with his tools works it over coals , and shapes it with hammers , and works it with his strong arm . He even becomes hungry and weak . If he didn ’ t drink water , he ’ d pass out .
CEB	Isaiah	44	13	A carpenter stretches out a string , marks it out with a stylus , fashions it with carving tools , and marks it with a compass . He makes it into a human form , like a splendid human , to live in a temple .
CEB	Isaiah	44	14	He cuts down cedars for himself , or chooses a cypress [ c ] or oak , selecting from all the trees of the forest . He plants a pine , [ d ] and the rain makes it grow .
CEB	Isaiah	44	15	It becomes suitable to burn for humans , so he takes some of the wood and warms himself . He kindles fire and bakes bread . He fashions a god and worships it ; he makes an idol and bows down to it .
CEB	Isaiah	44	16	Half of it he burns in the fire ; on that half he roasts and eats meat , and he is satisfied . He warms himself and says , “ Ah , I ’ m warm , watching the fire ! ”
CEB	Isaiah	44	17	And the rest of it he makes into a god , into his idol , and he bows down , worships , and prays to it , saying , “ Save me , for you are my god ! ”
CEB	Isaiah	44	18	They don ’ t know or comprehend , for their eyes can ’ t see and their minds can ’ t comprehend .
CEB	Isaiah	44	19	He doesn ’ t think , and has no knowledge or understanding to think : Half of it I burned in the fire , and I baked bread on its coals , and roasted meat and ate . Should I make the rest into something detestable ? Should I bow down to a block of wood ?
CEB	Isaiah	44	20	He ’ s feeding on ashes ; his deluded mind has led him astray . He can ’ t save himself and say , “ Isn ’ t this thing in my hand a lie ? ” Promises to Jacob and Jerusalem
CEB	Isaiah	44	21	Remember these things , Jacob ; Israel , for you are my servant . I formed you ; you are my servant ! I won ’ t forget you , Israel .
CEB	Isaiah	44	22	I swept away your rebellions like a cloud , and your sins like fog . Return to me , because I have redeemed you .
CEB	Isaiah	44	23	Sing , heavens , for the Lord has acted ; shout , depths of the earth ! Burst out with a ringing cry , you mountains , forest , and every tree in it . The Lord has redeemed Jacob , and will glorify himself through Israel .
CEB	Isaiah	44	24	The Lord your redeemer who formed you in the womb says : I am the Lord , the maker of all , who alone stretched out the heavens , who spread out the earth by myself ,
CEB	Isaiah	44	25	who frustrates the omens of diviners and makes a mockery of magicians , who turns back the wise and turns their knowledge into folly .
CEB	Isaiah	44	26	But who confirms the word of my [ e ] servant , and fulfills the predictions of my messengers ; who says about Jerusalem , “ It will be resettled ” ; and who says about the cities of Judah , “ They will be rebuilt , and I will restore their ruins ” ;
CEB	Isaiah	44	27	who says to the ocean depths , “ Dry up ; I will dry your streams ” ;

CEB	Isaiah	45	45	The Lord says to his anointed , to Cyrus , whom I have grasped by the strong hand , to conquer nations before him , disarming kings , and opening doors before him , so no gates will be shut :
CEB	Isaiah	45	2	I myself will go before you , and I will level mountains . I will shatter bronze doors ; I will cut through iron bars .
CEB	Isaiah	45	3	I will give you hidden treasures of secret riches , so you will know that I am the Lord , the God of Israel , who calls you by name .
CEB	Isaiah	45	4	For the sake of my servant Jacob and Israel my chosen , I called you by name . I gave you an honored title , though you didn ’ t know me .
CEB	Isaiah	45	5	I am the Lord , and there is no other ; besides me there is no God . I strengthen you— though you don ’ t know me—
CEB	Isaiah	45	6	so all will know , from the rising of the sun to its setting , that there is nothing apart from me . I am the Lord ; there ’ s no other .
CEB	Isaiah	45	7	I form light and create darkness , make prosperity and create doom ; I am the Lord , who does all these things .
CEB	Isaiah	45	8	Pour down , you heavens above , and let the clouds flow with righteousness . Let the earth open for salvation to bear fruit ; let righteousness sprout as well . I , the Lord , have created these things . Potter and clay
CEB	Isaiah	45	9	Doom to the one who argues with the potter , [ a ] as if he were just another clay pot ! Does the clay say to the potter , “ What are you making ? ” or “ Your work has no handles ” ?
CEB	Isaiah	45	10	Doom to one who says to a father , “ What have you fathered ? ” and to a woman , “ With what are you in labor ? ”
CEB	Isaiah	45	11	The Lord , the holy one of Israel and its maker , [ b ] says : Are you questioning me [ c ] about my own children ? Are you telling me what to do with the work of my hands ?
CEB	Isaiah	45	12	I myself made the earth , and created humans upon it . My own hands stretched out the heavens . I commanded all their forces .
CEB	Isaiah	45	13	I have a right to awaken Cyrus ; I will smooth all his paths . He will build my city and set my exiles free , not for a price and not for a bribe , says the Lord of heavenly forces .
CEB	Isaiah	45	14	The Lord says : Egypt will grow weary , Cush will be sold , [ d ] and the tall Sabeans will cross over to you . They will be yours , and after you they will go . In chains they will come ; to you they will bow down . They will plead with you : “ Truly God is with you ; there ’ s no other , no other God. ”
CEB	Isaiah	45	15	Surely you are a god who hides himself , Israel ’ s God and savior . Idols contrasted with God
CEB	Isaiah	45	16	They will all be shamed and disgraced ; the makers of idols will end up disgraced together .
CEB	Isaiah	45	17	Israel has been saved by the Lord of everlasting salvation . You won ’ t be shamed , and you won ’ t be disgraced forever and always .
CEB	Isaiah	45	18	For this is what the Lord said , who created the heavens , who is God , who formed the earth and made it , who established it , who didn ’ t create it a wasteland but formed it as a habitation : I , the Lord , and none other !
CEB	Isaiah	45	19	I didn ’ t speak in secret or in some land of darkness ; I didn ’ t say to the offspring of Jacob , “ Seek me in chaos. ” I am the Lord , the one who speaks truth , who announces what is correct .
CEB	Isaiah	45	20	Gather and come , draw near together , fugitives of the nations ! Those who carry their wooden idols don ’ t know ; those who pray to a god who won ’ t save .
CEB	Isaiah	45	21	Announce ! Approach ! Confer together ! Who proclaimed this from the beginning , announced it from long ago ? Wasn ’ t it I , the Lord ? There ’ s no other God except me , a righteous God and a savior ; there ’ s none besides me !
CEB	Isaiah	45	22	Turn to me and be saved , all you ends of the earth , for I am God , and there ’ s no other .
CEB	Isaiah	45	23	I have sworn a solemn pledge ; a word has left my mouth ; it is reliable and won ’ t fail . Surely every knee will bow and every tongue will confess ;

CEB	Isaiah	46	46	Bel crouches down ; Nebo cowers . Their idols sit on animals , on beasts . The objects you once carried about are now borne as burdens by the weary animals .
CEB	Isaiah	46	2	They crouch down and cower together . They aren ’ t able to rescue the burden , but they themselves go into captivity .
CEB	Isaiah	46	3	Listen to me , house of Jacob , all that remains from the house of Israel who have been borne by me since pregnancy , whom I carried from the womb
CEB	Isaiah	46	4	until you grow old . I am the one , and until you turn gray I will support you . I have done it , and I will continue to bear it ; I will support and I will rescue .
CEB	Isaiah	46	5	To whom will you liken me and count me equal and compare me so that we are alike ?
CEB	Isaiah	46	6	Those who pour out gold from a bag and weigh silver with a balance hire a metalworker ; then he makes a god . They bow down ; they worship ;
CEB	Isaiah	46	7	they carry the idol [ a ] on their shoulders and support it ; they set it down , and it stands still , unable to move from its place . If one cries out to it , it doesn ’ t answer . It can ’ t save people from their distress . Remember past events
CEB	Isaiah	46	8	Remember this and take courage ; take it to heart , you rebels .
CEB	Isaiah	46	9	Remember the prior things—from long ago ; I am God , and there ’ s no other . I am God ! There ’ s none like me ,
CEB	Isaiah	46	10	who tells the end at the beginning , from ancient times things not yet done , saying , “ My plan will stand ; all that I decide I will do , ”
CEB	Isaiah	46	11	I call a bird of prey from the east , a man from a distant land for my plan . As surely as I have spoken , I ’ ll make it happen ; I have planned , and yes , I ’ ll do it .
CEB	Isaiah	46	12	Listen to me , you bullheaded people who are far from victory :

CEB	Isaiah	47	4	Our redeemer has spoken ; the Lord of heavenly forces is his name , the holy one of Israel .
CEB	Isaiah	47	5	Sit silent and go into darkness , Daughter Chaldea , because they will no longer call you Queen of Kingdoms .
CEB	Isaiah	47	6	I was enraged with my people ; I made my inheritance impure and put them under your power . You took no pity on them . You made your yoke heavy even on the elderly .
CEB	Isaiah	47	7	You said , “ I ’ m forever ; I ’ m the eternal mistress. ” You didn ’ t stop and think ; you didn ’ t consider the outcome .
CEB	Isaiah	47	8	So listen to this , luxuriant one who sits secure , who says in her heart , I ’ m utterly unique ; I ’ ll never sit as a widow ; I ’ ll never know childlessness :
CEB	Isaiah	47	9	Both of these will happen to you at once , on a single day : childlessness and widowhood will envelop you in full measure , despite your many sorceries , despite your very powerful spells .
CEB	Isaiah	47	10	You felt secure in your evil ; you said , “ No one sees me. ” Your wisdom and knowledge spun you around . You thought to yourself , I and no one else .
CEB	Isaiah	47	11	Now evil will come against you , something you won ’ t anticipate . A curse will fall upon you , something you won ’ t be able to dispel . Destruction will come upon you suddenly , something you won ’ t foresee .
CEB	Isaiah	47	12	Continue with your enchantments , and with your many spells , which you have practiced since childhood . Maybe you will be able to succeed . Maybe you will inspire terror .
CEB	Isaiah	47	13	You are weary from all your consultations ; let the astrologers stand up and save you , those who gaze at the stars , and predict what will happen to you at each new moon .
CEB	Isaiah	47	14	They are just like stubble ; the fire burns them . They won ’ t save themselves from the powerful flames . This is no warming ember or fire to sit beside .

CEB	Isaiah	48	2	They are known as residents of the holy city , those who depend upon the God of Israel— the Lord of heavenly forces is his name .
CEB	Isaiah	48	3	Past things I announced long ago ; from my mouth I proclaimed them . I acted suddenly , and they came about .
CEB	Isaiah	48	4	Because I know that you are stubborn , your neck is made of iron , and your forehead is bronze .
CEB	Isaiah	48	5	I informed you long ago ; before they came about I proclaimed them to you so you wouldn ’ t say , “ My idol did them ; my wood statue and metal god commanded them. ”
CEB	Isaiah	48	6	You ’ ve heard and seen all this— won ’ t you admit it ? From now on I ’ ll tell you new things , guarded secrets that you don ’ t know .
CEB	Isaiah	48	7	They are created now , not long ago ; before today you hadn ’ t heard of them , so you won ’ t say , “ I already knew them. ”
CEB	Isaiah	48	8	You haven ’ t heard , nor have you known ; as in ages past your ears are closed , because I knew what a traitor you were ; you were known as a rebel from birth .

CEB	Isaiah	48	10	See , I have refined you , but not like silver ; I have tested you [ b ] in the furnace of misery .
CEB	Isaiah	48	11	For the sake of my reputation , for my own sake , I will act , for why will my name be made impure ? I won ’ t give my glory to another .
CEB	Isaiah	48	12	Listen to me , Jacob ; Israel , whom I called : I am the one ; I am the first and I am the last .

CEB	Isaiah	48	17	The Lord your redeemer , the holy one of Israel , proclaims : I am the Lord your God who teaches you for your own good , who leads you in the way you should go .
CEB	Isaiah	48	18	If you would pay attention to my commands , your well-being would be like a river , and your righteousness like the waves of the sea .
CEB	Isaiah	48	19	Your offspring would be like the sand , and your descendants like its grains . Their name would never be eliminated , never wiped out from before me .

CEB	Isaiah	49	3	saying to me , “ You are my servant , Israel , in whom I show my glory. ”
CEB	Isaiah	49	4	But I said , “ I have wearied myself in vain . I have used up my strength for nothing. ” Nevertheless , the Lord will grant me justice ; my reward is with my God .

CEB	Isaiah	49	6	He said : It is not enough , since you are my servant , to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to bring back the survivors of Israel . Hence , I will also appoint you as light to the nations so that my salvation may reach to the end of the earth .

CEB	Isaiah	51	13	You forgot the Lord your maker , the one who stretched out the heavens and founded the earth . You were continually afraid , all day long , on account of the oppressor ’ s wrath— a fear by which they intend to destroy you . Where now is the oppressor ’ s wrath ?

CEB	Isaiah	52	6	Therefore , my people will know my name on that day ; I ’ m the one who promises it ; I ’ m here . Your God rules
CEB	Isaiah	52	7	How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of a messenger who proclaims peace , who brings good news , who proclaims salvation , who says to Zion , “ Your God rules ! ”

CEB	Isaiah	52	12	You won ’ t go out in a rush , nor will you run away , because the one going before you is the Lord ; your rear guard is the God of Israel . Suffering servant
CEB	Isaiah	52	13	Look , my servant will succeed . He will be exalted and lifted very high .
CEB	Isaiah	52	14	Just as many were appalled by you , he too appeared disfigured , inhuman , his appearance unlike that of mortals .

CEB	Isaiah	53	3	He was despised and avoided by others ; a man who suffered , who knew sickness well . Like someone from whom people hid their faces , he was despised , and we didn ’ t think about him .
CEB	Isaiah	53	4	It was certainly our sickness that he carried , and our sufferings that he bore , but we thought him afflicted , struck down by God and tormented .
CEB	Isaiah	53	5	He was pierced because of our rebellions and crushed because of our crimes . He bore the punishment that made us whole ; by his wounds we are healed .
CEB	Isaiah	53	6	Like sheep we had all wandered away , each going its own way , but the Lord let fall on him all our crimes .

CEB	Isaiah	53	10	But the Lord wanted to crush him and to make him suffer . If his life is offered [ d ] as restitution , he will see his offspring ; he will enjoy long life . The Lord ’ s plans will come to fruition through him .
CEB	Isaiah	53	11	After his deep anguish he will see light , [ e ] and he will be satisfied . Through his knowledge , the righteous one , my servant , will make many righteous , and will bear their guilt .
CEB	Isaiah	53	12	Therefore , I will give him a share with the great , and he will divide the spoil with the strong , in return for exposing his life to death and being numbered with rebels , though he carried the sin of many and pleaded on behalf of those who rebelled .

CEB	Isaiah	54	16	Look , I myself created the metalworker who blows the fire of coal and who produces a tool for his work . And I myself created the looter to destroy .
CEB	Isaiah	54	17	No weapon fashioned against you will succeed , and you may condemn every tongue that disputes with you . This is the heritage of the Lord ’ s servants , whose righteousness comes from me , says the Lord . Footnotes - Isaiah 54:9 Or for the waters
CEB	Isaiah	55	55	All of you who are thirsty , come to the water ! Whoever has no money , come , buy food and eat ! Without money , at no cost , buy wine and milk !

CEB	Isaiah	55	6	Seek the Lord when he can still be found ; call him while he is yet near .
CEB	Isaiah	55	7	Let the wicked abandon their ways and the sinful their schemes . Let them return to the Lord so that he may have mercy on them , to our God , because he is generous with forgiveness .
CEB	Isaiah	55	8	My plans aren ’ t your plans , nor are your ways my ways , says the Lord .
CEB	Isaiah	55	9	Just as the heavens are higher than the earth , so are my ways higher than your ways , and my plans than your plans .
CEB	Isaiah	55	10	Just as the rain and the snow come down from the sky and don ’ t return there without watering the earth , making it conceive and yield plants and providing seed to the sower and food to the eater ,
CEB	Isaiah	55	11	so is my word that comes from my mouth ; it does not return to me empty . Instead , it does what I want , and accomplishes what I intend .

CEB	Isaiah	57	3	Come here , you children of sorcery , offspring of adultery and prostitution !
CEB	Isaiah	57	4	Whom are you mocking ? Against whom do you open your mouth wide and stick out your tongue ? Aren ’ t you children of rebellion , offspring of lies ,
CEB	Isaiah	57	5	who console yourselves with idols under every green tree , who slaughter children in the valleys , under the rocky cliffs ?
CEB	Isaiah	57	6	You belong with the smooth talkers [ a ] in the valley ; they , they are your lot . For them you poured out a drink offering , and presented a grain offering . Should I condone these things ?
CEB	Isaiah	57	7	On a very high mountain you made your bed . You went up there to offer a sacrifice .
CEB	Isaiah	57	8	Behind the door and the doorpost you placed your symbols . You abandoned me and lay down , making room in your bed and making deals for yourself with them . [ b ] You loved their bed ; you saw their nakedness .

CEB	Isaiah	58	3	“ Why do we fast and you don ’ t see ; why afflict ourselves and you don ’ t notice ? ” Yet on your fast day you do whatever you want , and oppress all your workers .
CEB	Isaiah	58	4	You quarrel and brawl , and then you fast ; you hit each other violently with your fists . You shouldn ’ t fast as you are doing today if you want to make your voice heard on high .
CEB	Isaiah	58	5	Is this the kind of fast I choose , a day of self-affliction , of bending one ’ s head like a reed and of lying down in mourning clothing and ashes ? Is this what you call a fast , a day acceptable to the Lord ?
CEB	Isaiah	58	6	Isn ’ t this the fast I choose : releasing wicked restraints , untying the ropes of a yoke , setting free the mistreated , and breaking every yoke ?
CEB	Isaiah	58	7	Isn ’ t it sharing your bread with the hungry and bringing the homeless poor into your house , covering the naked when you see them , and not hiding from your own family ?

CEB	Isaiah	58	9	Then you will call , and the Lord will answer ; you will cry for help , and God will say , “ I ’ m here. ” If you remove the yoke from among you , the finger-pointing , the wicked speech ;
CEB	Isaiah	58	10	if you open your heart to the hungry , and provide abundantly for those who are afflicted , your light will shine in the darkness , and your gloom will be like the noon .
CEB	Isaiah	58	11	The Lord will guide you continually and provide for you , even in parched places . He will rescue your bones . You will be like a watered garden , like a spring of water that won ’ t run dry .

CEB	Isaiah	58	13	If you stop trampling the Sabbath , stop doing whatever you want on my holy day , and consider the Sabbath a delight , sacred to the Lord , honored , and honor it instead of doing things your way , seeking what you want and doing business as usual ,
CEB	Isaiah	58	14	then you will take delight in the Lord . I will let you ride on the heights of the earth ; I will sustain you with the heritage of your ancestor Jacob . The mouth of the Lord has spoken .
CEB	Isaiah	59	59	Look ! The Lord does not lack the power to save , nor are his ears too dull to hear ,
CEB	Isaiah	59	2	but your misdeeds have separated you from your God . Your sins have hidden his face from you so that you aren ’ t heard .
CEB	Isaiah	59	3	Your hands are stained with blood , and your fingers with guilt . Your lips speak lies ; your tongues mutter malice .
CEB	Isaiah	59	4	No one sues honestly ; no one pleads truthfully . By trusting in emptiness and speaking deceit , they conceive harm and give birth to malice .
CEB	Isaiah	59	5	They hatch adders ’ eggs , and weave spiderwebs . Whoever eats their eggs will die . Moreover , the crushed egg hatches a viper .
CEB	Isaiah	59	6	Their webs can ’ t serve as clothing ; they can ’ t cover themselves with their deeds . Their deeds are deeds of malice , and the work of violence is in their hands .
CEB	Isaiah	59	7	Their feet run to evil ; they rush to shed innocent blood . Their thoughts are thoughts of malice ; desolation and destruction litter their highways .
CEB	Isaiah	59	8	They don ’ t know the way of peace ; there ’ s no justice in their paths . They make their roads crooked ; no one who walks in them knows peace . Injustice obscures vision
CEB	Isaiah	59	9	Because of all this , justice is far from us , and righteousness beyond our reach . We expect light , and there is darkness ; we await a gleam of light , but walk about in gloom .
CEB	Isaiah	59	10	We grope along the wall like the blind ; like those without eyes we grope . We stumble at noonday as if it were twilight , and among the strong as if we were dying .
CEB	Isaiah	59	11	All of us growl like bears , and like doves we moan . We expect justice , but there is none ; we await salvation , but it is far from us .
CEB	Isaiah	59	12	Our rebellions are numerous in your presence ; our sins testify against us . Our rebellions are with us ; we ’ re aware of our guilt :
CEB	Isaiah	59	13	defying and denying the Lord , turning away from our God , planning oppression and revolt , muttering lying words conceived in our minds .
CEB	Isaiah	59	14	Justice is pushed aside ; righteousness stands far off , because truth has stumbled in the public square , and honesty can ’ t enter .
CEB	Isaiah	59	15	Truth is missing ; anyone turning from evil is plundered . God will intervene The Lord looked and was upset at the absence of justice .
CEB	Isaiah	59	16	Seeing that there was no one , and astonished that no one would intervene , God ’ s arm brought victory , upheld by righteousness ,
CEB	Isaiah	59	17	putting on righteousness as armor and a helmet of salvation on his head , putting on garments of vengeance , and wrapping himself in a cloak of zeal .
CEB	Isaiah	59	18	God will repay according to their actions : wrath to his foes , retribution to enemies , retribution to the coastlands ,
CEB	Isaiah	59	19	so those in the west will fear the Lord ’ s name , and those in the east will fear God ’ s glory . It will come like a rushing river that the Lord ’ s wind drives on .
CEB	Isaiah	59	20	A redeemer will come to Zion and to those in Jacob who stop rebelling , says the Lord .
CEB	Isaiah	59	21	As for me , this is my covenant with them , says the Lord .

CEB	Isaiah	60	17	Instead of bronze I will bring gold ; instead of iron I will bring silver ; instead of wood , bronze ; and instead of stones , iron . I will make peace your governor and righteousness your taskmaster .
CEB	Isaiah	60	18	Violence will no longer resound throughout your land , nor devastation or destruction within your borders . You will call your walls Salvation , and your gates Praise .
CEB	Isaiah	60	19	The sun will no longer be your light by day , nor will the moon shine for illumination by night . [ a ] The Lord will be your everlasting light ; your God will be your glory .

CEB	Isaiah	63	63	Who is this coming from Edom , from Bozrah in bright red garments , this splendidly dressed one , striding [ a ] with great power ? It is I , proclaiming righteousness , powerful to save !
CEB	Isaiah	63	2	Why is your clothing red , and your garments like those of one who stomps on grapes ?
CEB	Isaiah	63	3	I have pressed out in the vat by myself—from the peoples , no one was with me . I stomped on them in my anger , trampled them in my wrath . Their blood splashed on my garments , and stained all my clothing ,

CEB	Isaiah	63	9	During all their distress , God also was distressed , so a messenger who served him saved them . In love and mercy God redeemed them , lifting and carrying them throughout earlier times .
CEB	Isaiah	63	10	But they rebelled , and made God ’ s holy spirit terribly sad , so that he turned into their enemy— he fought against them !
CEB	Isaiah	63	11	Then they remembered earlier times , when he rescued his people . [ b ] Where was the one who drew them up from the sea , the shepherd [ c ] of the flock ? Where was the one who put within them his holy spirit ;
CEB	Isaiah	63	12	the one who guided Moses ’ strong hand with his glorious arm ; who split the water for them to create an enduring reputation for himself ,

CEB	Isaiah	64	3	When you accomplished wonders beyond all our expectations ; when you came down , mountains quaked before you .
CEB	Isaiah	64	4	From ancient times , no one has heard , no ear has perceived , no eye has seen any god but you who acts on behalf of those who wait for him ! [ c ]
CEB	Isaiah	64	5	You look after those who gladly do right ; they will praise you for your ways . [ d ] But you were angry when we sinned ; you hid yourself when we did wrong . [ e ]
CEB	Isaiah	64	6	We have all become like the unclean ; all our righteous deeds are like a menstrual rag . All of us wither like a leaf ; our sins , like the wind , carry us away .
CEB	Isaiah	64	7	No one calls on your name ; no one bothers to hold on to you , for you have hidden yourself from us , and have handed us over [ f ] to our sin .
CEB	Isaiah	64	8	But now , Lord , you are our father . We are the clay , and you are our potter . All of us are the work of your hand .
CEB	Isaiah	64	9	Don ’ t rage so fiercely , Lord ; don ’ t hold our sins against us forever , but gaze now on your people , all of us :
CEB	Isaiah	64	10	Your holy cities have become a wilderness ; Zion has become a wilderness , Jerusalem a wasteland .
CEB	Isaiah	64	11	Our holy , glorious house , where our ancestors praised you , has gone up in flames ; all that we treasured has become a ruin .

CEB	Isaiah	65	65	I was ready to respond to those who didn ’ t ask . I was ready to be found by those who didn ’ t look for me . I said , “ I ’ m here ! I ’ m here ! ” to a nation that didn ’ t call on my name .
CEB	Isaiah	65	2	I extended my hands all day to a rebellious people walking in a way that isn ’ t good , following their own plans ;
CEB	Isaiah	65	3	people who provoke me to my face continually , sacrificing in gardens and burning incense on bricks ,
CEB	Isaiah	65	4	who sit in tombs and spend the night among rocks ; [ a ] who eat swine ’ s flesh with broth of unclean meat in their bowls ;
CEB	Isaiah	65	5	who say , “ Keep to yourself ! Keep away from me ! I ’ m too holy for you. ” These people ignite my anger like a fire that burns all day .
CEB	Isaiah	65	6	Look , this stands written before me . I won ’ t be silent , but I will repay ; I will repay in full measure
CEB	Isaiah	65	7	your sins and the sins of your ancestors as well , says the Lord . Since they burned incense on the mountains , and mocked me in the hills , I will count out to them full payment for their actions .
CEB	Isaiah	65	8	The Lord proclaims : As new wine is found in the grape cluster , and someone says , “ Don ’ t destroy it , for there is a blessing in it , ” so I will do for the sake of my servants and not destroy everything :
CEB	Isaiah	65	9	I will bring out offspring from Jacob , and from Judah , heirs to my mountains . My chosen ones will take possession ; my servants will dwell there .
CEB	Isaiah	65	10	Sharon will become a pasture for sheep , and the Achor Valley a resting place for cattle , for my people who seek me .
CEB	Isaiah	65	11	But you who abandon the Lord , who forget my holy mountain , who set a table for a god of good fortune , and fill cups of mixed wine for a god of fate :
CEB	Isaiah	65	12	I will offer you to the sword . You will all bow down for slaughter , because I called and you didn ’ t answer ; I spoke and you wouldn ’ t hear . You did what I considered evil , and chose what I didn ’ t want .
CEB	Isaiah	65	13	Therefore , the Lord God says : Look , my servants will eat , but you will hunger . My servants will drink , but you will thirst . My servants will rejoice , but you will be ashamed .
CEB	Isaiah	65	14	My servants will sing with contented hearts , but you will cry out from heartache ; with broken spirits you will wail .
CEB	Isaiah	65	15	You will leave your name behind for my chosen ones to curse : “ May the Lord God kill you ! May he call his servants by a different name ! ”
CEB	Isaiah	65	16	Those who pronounce a blessing in the land will do so by the God called Amen ; those who make a solemn pledge in the land will do so by the God called Amen . [ b ] Past troubles will be forgotten and hidden from my sight . New creation and new Jerusalem
CEB	Isaiah	65	17	Look ! I ’ m creating a new heaven and a new earth : past events won ’ t be remembered ; they won ’ t come to mind .
CEB	Isaiah	65	18	Be glad and rejoice forever in what I ’ m creating , because I ’ m creating Jerusalem as a joy and her people as a source of gladness .
CEB	Isaiah	65	19	I will rejoice in Jerusalem and be glad about my people . No one will ever hear the sound of weeping or crying in it again .
CEB	Isaiah	65	20	No more will babies live only a few days , or the old fail to live out their days . The one who dies at a hundred will be like a young person , and the one falling short of a hundred will seem cursed .
CEB	Isaiah	65	21	They will build houses and live in them ; they will plant vineyards and eat their fruit .
CEB	Isaiah	65	22	They won ’ t build for others to live in , nor plant for others to eat . Like the days of a tree will be the days of my people ; my chosen will make full use of their handiwork .
CEB	Isaiah	65	23	They won ’ t labor in vain , nor bear children to a world of horrors , because they will be people blessed by the Lord , they along with their descendants .
CEB	Isaiah	65	24	Before they call , I will answer ; while they are still speaking , I will hear .
CEB	Isaiah	65	25	Wolf and lamb will graze together , and the lion will eat straw like the ox , but the snake—its food will be dust . They won ’ t hurt or destroy at any place on my holy mountain , says the Lord . Footnotes - Isaiah 65:4 Or in guarded places - Isaiah 65:16 Or so be it
CEB	Isaiah	66	66	The Lord says : Heaven is my throne , and earth is my footstool . So where could you build a house for me , and where could my resting place be ?
CEB	Isaiah	66	2	My hand made all these things and brought them into being , says the Lord . But here is where I will look : to the humble and contrite in spirit , who tremble at my word .
CEB	Isaiah	66	3	The one who slaughters an ox kills a person ; the one who sacrifices a sheep breaks a dog ’ s neck ; the one who makes a grain offering offers swine ’ s blood ; the one who burns incense blesses an idol . All these have chosen their own ways , and prefer their detestable things .
CEB	Isaiah	66	4	So I too will choose to punish them , to bring horrors upon them , since I called and no one answered . I spoke and no one heard , but they did evil in my eyes . What I didn ’ t want , they chose .
CEB	Isaiah	66	5	Listen to the Lord ’ s word , you who tremble at his word : Your family members , those who hate and exclude you because of my name , have said , “ Let the Lord be glorified ; let ’ s see your joy. ” But they will be ashamed .
CEB	Isaiah	66	6	The sound of an uproar from the city ! A sound from the temple ! The sound of the Lord repaying his enemies what they have earned . Mother Zion
CEB	Isaiah	66	7	Before she was in labor , she gave birth . Before her pangs came upon her , she delivered a boy .
CEB	Isaiah	66	8	Whoever heard of such a thing ? Whoever saw such things as these ? Can a land come to birth in one day ? Can a nation be born all at once ? Yet as soon as birth pangs came , Zion bore her children .
CEB	Isaiah	66	9	Will I open the womb and not bring to birth ? says the Lord . Will I , who create life , close the womb ? says your God .
CEB	Isaiah	66	10	Celebrate with Jerusalem ; be happy with her , all you who love her ! Rejoice with her in joy , all you who mourn over her ,
CEB	Isaiah	66	11	so that you may nurse and be satisfied from her comforting breasts , that you may drink and be refreshed from her full breasts .
CEB	Isaiah	66	12	The Lord says : Look , I ’ m extending prosperity to her like a river , and the wealth of nations like an overflowing stream . You will nurse and be carried on the hip and bounced upon the knee .
CEB	Isaiah	66	13	As a mother comforts her child , so I will comfort you ; in Jerusalem you will be comforted .
CEB	Isaiah	66	14	When you see this , your heart will rejoice ; your entire being will flourish like grass . The Lord ’ s power will be known among his servants , but his fury among his enemies .
CEB	Isaiah	66	15	The Lord will come with fire , God ’ s chariots like a windstorm , to repay in hot anger , to rebuke with fiery flames .
CEB	Isaiah	66	16	With fire and with sword the Lord will judge all humanity ; many will be slain by the Lord .
CEB	Isaiah	66	17	Those who became holy and purify themselves , following their leader into the gardens , [ a ] who eat pork , detestable animals , and mice , will meet their end together , says the Lord . Worshippers gathered from the nations
CEB	Isaiah	66	18	Because of their actions and thoughts , I ’ m coming to gather all nations and cultures . They will come to see my glory .
CEB	Isaiah	66	19	I will put a sign on them , by sending out some of the survivors to the nations , to Tarshish , Libya , and Lydia , and to the archers of Cilicia and Greece—distant coastlands that haven ’ t heard of my fame or seen my glory . They will declare my glory among the nations .
CEB	Isaiah	66	20	They will bring your family members from all nations as an offering to the Lord—on horses , in chariots , in wagons , on mules , and on camels—to my holy mountain Jerusalem , says the Lord , like Israelites bringing an offering in purified containers to the Lord ’ s house .
CEB	Isaiah	66	21	I will select some of them as priests and Levites , says the Lord .
CEB	Isaiah	66	22	As the new heavens and the new earth that I ’ m making will endure before me , says the Lord , so your descendants and your name will endure .
CEB	Isaiah	66	23	From month to month and from Sabbath to Sabbath , all humanity will come to worship me , says the Lord .
CEB	Isaiah	66	24	They will go out and see the corpses of the people who rebelled against me , where their worm never dies , where their fire is never extinguished . They will be a horror to everyone . Footnotes - Isaiah 66:17 Heb uncertain

CEB	Jeremiah	1	3	and throughout the rule of Judah ’ s King Jehoiakim , Josiah ’ s son , until the fifth month of the eleventh year of King Zedekiah , Josiah ’ s son , when the people of Jerusalem were taken into exile . Call of Jeremiah
CEB	Jeremiah	1	4	The Lord ’ s word came to me :
CEB	Jeremiah	1	5	“ Before I created you in the womb I knew you ; before you were born I set you apart ; I made you a prophet to the nations. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	1	6	“ Ah , Lord God , ” I said , “ I don ’ t know how to speak because I ’ m only a child. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	1	7	The Lord responded , “ Don ’ t say , ‘ I ’ m only a child. ’ Where I send you , you must go ; what I tell you , you must say .
CEB	Jeremiah	1	8	Don ’ t be afraid of them , because I ’ m with you to rescue you , ” declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	1	9	Then the Lord stretched out his hand , touched my mouth , and said to me , “ I ’ m putting my words in your mouth .
CEB	Jeremiah	1	10	This very day I appoint you over nations and empires , to dig up and pull down , to destroy and demolish , to build and plant. ” Jeremiah ’ s mission confirmed
CEB	Jeremiah	1	11	The Lord asked me , “ What do you see , Jeremiah ? ” I said , “ A branch of an almond [ a ] tree. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	1	12	The Lord then said , “ You are right , for I ’ m watching over [ b ] my word until it is fulfilled. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	1	13	The Lord asked me again , “ What do you see ? ” I said , “ A pot boiling over from the north. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	1	14	The Lord said to me , “ Trouble will erupt from the north against the people of this land. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	1	15	I ’ m calling for all the tribes of great nations from the north , says the Lord , and they will set up their rulers by the entrances of Jerusalem , on its walls , and in every city of Judah .
CEB	Jeremiah	1	16	I will declare my judgment against them for doing evil : for abandoning me , worshipping other gods , and trusting in the works of their hands .
CEB	Jeremiah	1	17	But you must prepare for battle and be ready to utter every word I command you . Don ’ t be frightened before them , or I will frighten you before them .
CEB	Jeremiah	1	18	Today I have made you an armed city , an iron pillar , and a bronze wall against the entire land—the kings of Judah , its princes , its priests , and all its people .
CEB	Jeremiah	1	19	They will attack you , but they won ’ t defeat you , because I am with you and will rescue you , declares the Lord . Footnotes - Jeremiah 1:11 Heb shaqed - Jeremiah 1:12 Heb shoqed
CEB	Jeremiah	2	2	Go and proclaim to the people of Jerusalem , The Lord proclaims : I remember your first love , [ a ] your devotion as a young bride , how you followed me in the wilderness , in an unplanted land .
CEB	Jeremiah	2	3	Israel was devoted to the Lord , the early produce of the harvest . Whoever ate from it became guilty ; disaster overtook them , declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	2	4	Listen to the Lord ’ s word , people of Judah , all you families of the Israelite household .
CEB	Jeremiah	2	5	This is what the Lord says : What wrong did your ancestors find in me that made them wander so far ? They pursued what was worthless and became worthless .
CEB	Jeremiah	2	6	They didn ’ t ask , “ Where ’ s the Lord who brought us up from the land of Egypt , who led us through the wilderness , in a land of deserts and ravines , in a land of drought and darkness , in a land of no return , where no one survives ? ”
CEB	Jeremiah	2	7	I brought you into a land of plenty , to enjoy its gifts and goodness , but you ruined my land ; you disgraced my heritage .
CEB	Jeremiah	2	8	The priests didn ’ t ask , “ Where ’ s the Lord ? ” Those responsible for the Instruction didn ’ t know me ; the leaders rebelled against me ; the prophets spoke in the name of Baal , going after what has no value .
CEB	Jeremiah	2	9	That is why I will take you to court and charge even your descendants , declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	2	10	Look to the west as far as the shores of Cyprus and to the east as far as the land of Kedar . Ask anyone there : Has anything this odd ever taken place ?
CEB	Jeremiah	2	11	Has a nation switched gods , though they aren ’ t really gods at all ? Yet my people have exchanged their glory for what has no value .
CEB	Jeremiah	2	12	Be stunned at such a thing , you heavens ; shudder and quake , declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	2	13	My people have committed two crimes : They have forsaken me , the spring of living water . And they have dug wells , broken wells that can ’ t hold water .
CEB	Jeremiah	2	14	Is Israel a slave , a servant by birth ? If not , why then has he become prey ?
CEB	Jeremiah	2	15	Lions roar at him ; they growl . They destroy his land and make his towns desolate until nothing is left .
CEB	Jeremiah	2	16	As well , the people of Memphis and Tahpanhes lay open your scalp .
CEB	Jeremiah	2	17	Haven ’ t you brought this on yourself by abandoning the Lord your God , who has directed your paths ?
CEB	Jeremiah	2	18	So why take the path to Egypt to drink water from the Nile ? Why travel the path to Assyria to drink water from the Euphrates ?
CEB	Jeremiah	2	19	Your wrongdoing will punish you . Your acts of unfaithfulness will find you out . Don ’ t you understand how terribly bitter it is to abandon the Lord your God and not fear me ? declares the Lord of heavenly forces .
CEB	Jeremiah	2	20	Long ago I broke your yoke ; I shattered your chains . But even then you said , “ I won ’ t serve you. ” On every high hill and under every lush tree , you have acted like a prostitute .
CEB	Jeremiah	2	21	Yet it was I who planted you , a precious vine of fine quality ; how could you turn into a wild vine and become good for nothing ?
CEB	Jeremiah	2	22	Even though you scrub yourself with soap or strong powder , the stain of your sin is still before me , declares the Lord God .
CEB	Jeremiah	2	23	How can you say , “ I ’ m not dirty ; I haven ’ t gone after Baals. ” Look what you have done in the valley ; consider what you have done there . You are like a frenzied young camel , racing around ,
CEB	Jeremiah	2	24	a wild donkey in the wilderness , lustfully sniffing the wind . Who can restrain such passion ? Those who desire her need not give up ; with little effort they will find her in heat .
CEB	Jeremiah	2	25	Don ’ t run about until your feet are blistered and your throat is parched . But you say , “ What ’ s the use ? I have fallen in love with foreign gods , and I must pursue them. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	2	26	As a thief is ashamed when caught in his tracks , so the people of Israel are ashamed— their kings , officials , priests , and prophets—
CEB	Jeremiah	2	27	when they say to a piece of wood , “ You are my father , ” and to a stone , “ You gave me birth. ” They have turned their backs to me and not their faces . Yet in their time of trouble they say , “ Arise and save us ! ”
CEB	Jeremiah	2	28	Where are the gods you have made for yourselves ? Let ’ s see if they will come through for you in your time of trouble . You have as many gods , Judah , as you have towns .
CEB	Jeremiah	2	29	Why would you bring charges against me ? You have all rebelled against me , declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	2	30	I have disciplined your children in vain ; they have rejected my correction . You have devoured your prophets like a hungry lion .
CEB	Jeremiah	2	31	People of this generation , listen closely to the Lord ’ s word : Have I been a wasteland to Israel or a land of dense darkness ? Why then do my people say , “ We have wandered far away ; we ’ ll come to you no longer ” ?
CEB	Jeremiah	2	32	Does a young woman forget her jewelry or a bride her wedding dress ? Yet you have forgotten me days without end !
CEB	Jeremiah	2	33	So skilled are you at pursuing lovers [ b ] that you instruct even the most wicked . [ c ]
CEB	Jeremiah	2	34	Your garments are stained with the blood of the innocent poor , even though you didn ’ t catch them breaking and entering . Yet , despite all this , [ d ]
CEB	Jeremiah	2	35	you still insist , “ I ’ m innocent ; as a result he will turn his anger away from me. ” Because you claim not to have sinned , I will pass judgment against you .
CEB	Jeremiah	2	36	You change sides so casually ! But Egypt will shame you no less than Assyria .
CEB	Jeremiah	2	37	From there you will go out with your hands on your heads , because the Lord has rejected those you rely on ; they won ’ t help you .

CEB	Jeremiah	3	3	That ’ s why the showers have failed and the spring rains have ceased . Still you act like a brazen prostitute [ b ] who refuses to blush .
CEB	Jeremiah	3	2	Look to the well-traveled paths [ a ] and see ! Where haven ’ t you committed adultery ? On the roadsides you sit in wait for lovers , like a nomad in the wilderness . You have corrupted the land with your cheap and reckless behavior .
CEB	Jeremiah	3	4	At the same time you say to me , “ My father , my friend since youth ,
CEB	Jeremiah	3	5	will you stay angry forever ? Will you continue to be furious ? ” This is what you say while you do as much evil as you possibly can .
CEB	Jeremiah	3	6	During the rule of King Josiah , the Lord said to me : Have you noticed what unfaithful Israel has done ? She ’ s gone about looking for lovers on top of every high hill and under every lush tree .
CEB	Jeremiah	3	7	I thought that after she had done all this she would return to me , but she didn ’ t . Her disloyal sister Judah saw this .
CEB	Jeremiah	3	8	She [ c ] also saw that I sent unfaithful Israel away with divorce papers because of all her acts of unfaithfulness ; yet disloyal sister Judah was not afraid but kept on playing the prostitute .
CEB	Jeremiah	3	9	She didn ’ t think twice about corrupting the land and committing adultery with stone and tree .
CEB	Jeremiah	3	10	Yet even after all this , disloyal sister Judah didn ’ t return to me with all her heart but only insincerely , declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	3	11	Then the Lord said to me : Unfaithful Israel is less guilty [ d ] than disloyal Judah .
CEB	Jeremiah	3	12	Go proclaim these words to the north and say : Return , unfaithful Israel , declares the Lord . I won ’ t reject you , for I ’ m faithful , declares the Lord ; I won ’ t stay angry forever .
CEB	Jeremiah	3	13	Only acknowledge your wrongdoing : how you have rebelled against the Lord your God , and given yourself to strangers under every lush tree and haven ’ t obeyed me , declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	3	14	Return , rebellious children , declares the Lord , for I ’ m your husband . I ’ ll gather you— one from a city and two from a tribe— and bring you back to Zion .
CEB	Jeremiah	3	15	I will appoint shepherds with whom I ’ m pleased , and they will lead you with knowledge and understanding .
CEB	Jeremiah	3	16	And in those days , when your numbers have greatly increased in the land , declares the Lord , people will no longer talk about the Lord ’ s covenant chest ; they won ’ t recall or remember it ; they won ’ t even miss it or try to build another one .
CEB	Jeremiah	3	17	At that time , they will call Jerusalem the Lord ’ s throne , and all nations will gather there to honor the Lord ’ s name . No longer will they follow their own willful and evil hearts .
CEB	Jeremiah	3	18	In those days the people of Judah and Israel will leave the north together for the land that I gave their ancestors as an inheritance .
CEB	Jeremiah	3	19	I thought to myself , How wonderful it would be to treat you like children and give you a beautiful land , an inheritance unrivaled among the nations . And I thought , You will call me father , and you won ’ t turn away from me .
CEB	Jeremiah	3	20	But as a woman betrays her lover , so you , people of Israel , have betrayed me , declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	3	21	A voice is heard on the well-traveled paths ; [ e ] it ’ s the crying and pleading of the people of Israel , who have lost their way and forgotten the Lord their God .
CEB	Jeremiah	3	22	Return , rebellious children , and I will heal your rebellion . “ Here we are ; we come to you , for you are the Lord our God .
CEB	Jeremiah	3	23	Surely what happens on the hills [ f ] is a waste , as is the uproar on the mountains . Only in the Lord our God is the salvation of Israel .
CEB	Jeremiah	3	24	From our youth , shame [ g ] has devoured the fruit of our parents ’ labor— their flocks and herds , as well as their sons and daughters .
CEB	Jeremiah	3	25	Let ’ s lie down in our shame . Let our dishonor cover us , for we have sinned against the Lord our God , both we and our ancestors , from our youth to this very day . We have disobeyed the voice of the Lord our God. ” Footnotes - Jeremiah 3:2 Or bare heights - Jeremiah 3:3 Or You have a prostitute ’ s forehead . - Jeremiah 3:8 LXX , Syr ; MT I - Jeremiah 3:11 Or more righteous - Jeremiah 3:21 Or bare heights - Jeremiah 3:23 LXX , Syr , Vulg ; MT from the hills - Jeremiah 3:24 Or the shame
CEB	Jeremiah	4	4	Dedicate [ b ] yourselves to the Lord ; don ’ t be thick-skinned , [ c ] people of Judah and residents of Jerusalem , or else my anger will spread like a wildfire . It will burn , with no one to put it out , because of your evil deeds . Disaster approaches
CEB	Jeremiah	4	2	and if you swear by the living God in truth , justice , and righteousness , then the nations will enjoy God ’ s blessings ; [ a ] they will boast about him .
CEB	Jeremiah	4	3	This is what the Lord says to the people of Judah and to the residents of Jerusalem : Break up your hard rocky soil ; don ’ t plant among the thorns .
CEB	Jeremiah	4	5	Announce in Judah , in Jerusalem proclaim , sound the alarm throughout the land , cry out and say , “ Gather together ! Let ’ s flee to the fortified towns ! ”
CEB	Jeremiah	4	6	Set up a flag to Zion ; take cover , don ’ t just stand there ! I ’ m bringing disaster from the north , massive devastation .
CEB	Jeremiah	4	7	A lion bursts out of the thicket ; a destroyer of nations advances . He ’ s gone forth from his place to ravage your land , to wipe out your towns , until no one is left .
CEB	Jeremiah	4	8	So put on funeral clothing . Weep and wail , for the Lord ’ s fierce anger hasn ’ t turned away from us .
CEB	Jeremiah	4	9	On that day , declares the Lord , the courage of the king and his princes will fail , the priests will be stunned , and the prophets will be shocked .
CEB	Jeremiah	4	10	Then I said , “ Lord God , no ! You have utterly deceived this people and Jerusalem by promising them peace even though the sword is at their throats. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	4	11	At that time , this people and Jerusalem will be told : A blistering wind from the bare heights ; it rages in the desert toward my people , not merely to winnow or cleanse .
CEB	Jeremiah	4	12	This wind is too devastating for that . Now I , even I , will pronounce my sentence against them .
CEB	Jeremiah	4	13	Look ! He approaches like the clouds ; his chariots advance like a tempest , his horses swifter than eagles . How horrible ! We ’ re doomed !
CEB	Jeremiah	4	14	Cleanse your heart of evil , Jerusalem , that you may be saved . How long will you entertain your destructive ideas ?
CEB	Jeremiah	4	15	A voice declares from Dan ; someone proclaims disaster from the highlands of Ephraim .
CEB	Jeremiah	4	16	Warn the nations , proclaim it to Jerusalem ! Armies are approaching from a far-away country , raising their war cries against the towns of Judah .
CEB	Jeremiah	4	17	They hem her in like those guarding a field , because she has rebelled against me , declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	4	18	Your own conduct , your own deeds have done this to you . This is your payment and how bitter it is , piercing into the depths of your heart . Anguish over looming disaster
CEB	Jeremiah	4	19	Oh , my suffering , my suffering ! My pain is unbearable ; my heart is in turmoil ; it throbs nonstop . I can ’ t be silent , because I hear the blast of the trumpet and the roar of the battle cry !
CEB	Jeremiah	4	20	Disaster follows disaster ; the whole land is ruined . Suddenly , my tents are destroyed , my shelter in a moment .
CEB	Jeremiah	4	21	How long must I see the battle flags and hear the blast of the trumpet ?
CEB	Jeremiah	4	22	My people are foolish . They don ’ t even know me ! They are thoughtless children without understanding ; they are skilled at doing wrong , inept at doing right .
CEB	Jeremiah	4	23	I looked at the earth , and it was without shape or form ; at the heavens and there was no light .
CEB	Jeremiah	4	24	I looked at the mountains and they were quaking ; all the hills were rocking back and forth .
CEB	Jeremiah	4	25	I looked and there was no one left ; every bird in the sky had taken flight .
CEB	Jeremiah	4	26	I looked and the fertile land was a desert ; all its towns were in ruins before the Lord , before his fury .
CEB	Jeremiah	4	27	The Lord proclaims : The whole earth will become a desolation , but I will not destroy it completely .
CEB	Jeremiah	4	28	Therefore , the earth will grieve and the heavens grow dark because I have declared my plan and will neither change my mind nor cancel the plan .
CEB	Jeremiah	4	29	As the horsemen and archers approach , the people take flight . They hide in the bushes and escape to the cliffs . Every city is deserted ; no one remains .
CEB	Jeremiah	4	30	And you , devastated one , why dress up in scarlet , deck yourself in gold jewelry , and color your eyes with paint ? In vain you get all decked out ; your lovers have rejected you and now seek your life .
CEB	Jeremiah	4	31	I hear the cry of a woman in labor , the distress of one delivering her first child . It is the cry of Daughter Zion , gasping for breath , her arms stretched out , and moaning , “ I ’ m about to fall into the hands of murderers ! ” Footnotes - Jeremiah 4:2 Or bless themselves in him or be blessed by him or will bless themselves - Jeremiah 4:4 Or circumcise - Jeremiah 4:4 Or remove the foreskins of your hearts
CEB	Jeremiah	5	5	Let me go and speak to the powerful people , for they will surely know the Lord ’ s way and the justice of their God . But they too have broken their yoke and shattered the chains .
CEB	Jeremiah	5	2	Even when making a pledge— “ As the Lord lives ” — they swear falsely .
CEB	Jeremiah	5	3	Lord , don ’ t you look for integrity ? You have struck them down , but they didn ’ t even cringe . You have crushed them , but they have ignored your discipline . They make their faces harder than rock and refuse to return .
CEB	Jeremiah	5	4	Then I thought to myself , These are the poor who don ’ t know better ! They don ’ t understand the Lord ’ s way or the justice of their God .
CEB	Jeremiah	5	6	Therefore , a lion from the forest will attack them ; a wolf from the desert will destroy them ; a leopard prowling around their towns will tear to pieces anyone venturing out— because of their many crimes and countless acts of unfaithfulness .
CEB	Jeremiah	5	7	How can I pardon you ? Your children have forsaken me and swear by gods that are not gods . Although I could have satisfied them , they committed adultery , dashing off to the prostitution house .
CEB	Jeremiah	5	8	They are lusty stallions roving about , snorting for another ’ s wife .
CEB	Jeremiah	5	9	The Lord declares : Shouldn ’ t I confront these acts ? Shouldn ’ t I take revenge on such a nation ? Contempt for God
CEB	Jeremiah	5	10	Climb through her vineyards and ravage them , although not completely . Prune back her branches , because they aren ’ t the Lord ’ s .
CEB	Jeremiah	5	11	The people of Israel and Judah have been utterly faithless to me , declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	5	12	They have lied about the Lord and said , “ He ’ ll do nothing ! [ a ] Disaster won ’ t come upon us ; we won ’ t see war or famine. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	5	13	The prophets are so much wind ; the word isn ’ t in them . Thus and so may it be done to them .
CEB	Jeremiah	5	14	Therefore , the Lord God of heavenly forces proclaims : Because you have spoken this way , I will put my words in your mouth as a fire ; it will consume the people , who are but kindling .
CEB	Jeremiah	5	15	I am about to bring a distant nation against you , people of Israel , declares the Lord . It is an established nation , an ancient nation , a nation whose language you don ’ t know , whose speech you won ’ t understand .
CEB	Jeremiah	5	16	Its weapons are deadly ; [ b ] its warriors are many .
CEB	Jeremiah	5	17	It will devour your harvest and food ; it will devour your sons and daughters ; it will devour your flocks and herds ; it will devour your vines and fig trees ; it will shatter your fortified towns in which you trust— with the sword !
CEB	Jeremiah	5	18	Yet even in those days , declares the Lord , I won ’ t completely destroy you .
CEB	Jeremiah	5	19	And when they ask , “ Why has the Lord our God done all these things to us ? ” you must reply , “ Just as you have abandoned me and served foreign gods in your land , so you will serve strangers in a land not your own. ” Shouldn ’ t you fear me ?
CEB	Jeremiah	5	20	Declare this to the people of Jacob , announce it in Judah :
CEB	Jeremiah	5	21	Listen , you foolish and senseless people , who have eyes but don ’ t see and ears but don ’ t hear .
CEB	Jeremiah	5	22	Shouldn ’ t you fear me , declares the Lord , and tremble before me , the one who set the shoreline for the sea , an ancient boundary that it can ’ t pass ? Though its waves may rise and roar , they can ’ t pass the limits I have set .
CEB	Jeremiah	5	23	And yet the people have stubborn and rebellious hearts ; they turn and go their own way .
CEB	Jeremiah	5	24	They don ’ t say in their hearts , Let ’ s fear the Lord our God , who provides rain in autumn and spring and who assures us of a harvest in its season .
CEB	Jeremiah	5	25	Your wrongdoing has turned these blessings [ c ] away . Your sin has robbed you of good .
CEB	Jeremiah	5	26	Criminals are found among my people ; they set traps to catch people , like hunters lying in wait . [ d ]
CEB	Jeremiah	5	27	Like a cage full of birds , so their houses are full of loot . No wonder they are rich and powerful
CEB	Jeremiah	5	28	and have grown fat and sleek ! To be sure , their evil deeds exceed all limits , and yet they prosper . They are indifferent to the plight of the orphan , reluctant to defend the rights of the poor .
CEB	Jeremiah	5	29	Shouldn ’ t I punish such acts ? declares the Lord . Shouldn ’ t I repay that nation for its deeds ?
CEB	Jeremiah	5	30	An awful , a terrible thing has happened in the land :
CEB	Jeremiah	5	31	The prophets prophesy falsely , the priests rule at their sides , [ e ] and my people love it this way ! But what will you do when the end comes ?

CEB	Jeremiah	6	6	The Lord of heavenly forces proclaims : Cut down her trees , and build siege ramps against Jerusalem . This city must be held accountable , [ b ] for there ’ s nothing but oppression in her midst .
CEB	Jeremiah	6	2	You are like a lovely pasture , Daughter Zion . [ a ]
CEB	Jeremiah	6	3	Shepherds come to her with their flocks . They pitch their tents around her and graze in their place .
CEB	Jeremiah	6	4	“ Prepare for battle against her ; get ready ; let ’ s attack by noon ! Oh , no ! Daylight is fading , and the evening shadows lengthen .
CEB	Jeremiah	6	5	Get ready , let ’ s attack by night and destroy her fortresses ! ”
CEB	Jeremiah	6	7	As a well brings forth fresh water , she brings forth evil . Violence and destruction are heard within her ; injury and wounds are ever before me .
CEB	Jeremiah	6	8	Hear me out , [ c ] Jerusalem , or else I ’ ll turn away from you and reduce you to ruins , a land unfit to live in . Unresponsive people
CEB	Jeremiah	6	9	This is what the Lord of heavenly forces says : From top to bottom , let them harvest the remaining few in Israel . Pick clean every last grape on the vine !
CEB	Jeremiah	6	10	To whom can I speak and warn ? How can I get someone ’ s attention ? Their ears are shut tight , [ d ] so they won ’ t hear . They are ashamed of the Lord ’ s word and take no pleasure in it .
CEB	Jeremiah	6	11	But I ’ m filled with the Lord ’ s rage and am tired of holding it in . Pour it out on the children in the streets and on the youths gathered together ; husband with wife will be trapped , as will those old and gray .
CEB	Jeremiah	6	12	Their homes will be turned over to others , their fields and wives as well . I will stretch out my hand against the people of this land , declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	6	13	From the least to the greatest , each is eager to profit ; from prophet to priest , each trades in dishonesty .
CEB	Jeremiah	6	14	They treat the wound of my people as if it were nothing : “ All is well , all is well , ” they insist , when in fact nothing is well .
CEB	Jeremiah	6	15	They should be ashamed of their detestable practices , but they have no shame ; they don ’ t even blush ! Therefore , they will fall among the fallen and stumble when I bring disaster , declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	6	16	The Lord proclaims : Stop at the crossroads and look around ; ask for the ancient paths . Where is the good way ? Then walk in it and find a resting place for yourselves . But you [ e ] said , “ We won ’ t go ! ”
CEB	Jeremiah	6	17	Still , I have appointed watchmen to warn you . But you [ f ] said , “ We won ’ t listen ! ”
CEB	Jeremiah	6	18	Therefore , pay attention , nations ; take notice , assembly , what is ahead of them . [ g ]
CEB	Jeremiah	6	19	Pay attention , earth : I ’ m bringing disaster upon my people , the fruit of their own devices , because they have ignored my words and they have rejected my teaching .
CEB	Jeremiah	6	20	What use to me is incense from Sheba or sweet cane from a faraway land ? Your entirely burned offerings won ’ t buy your pardon ; your sacrifices won ’ t appease me .
CEB	Jeremiah	6	21	Therefore , the Lord proclaims : I ’ m putting obstacles before this people , and both parents and children will stumble over them ; neighbor and friend alike will perish . Panic-stricken Zion
CEB	Jeremiah	6	22	The Lord proclaims : An army is on the move from the northern regions ; a great nation is roused from the ends of the earth .
CEB	Jeremiah	6	23	Equipped with bow and spear , they are cruel ; they show no mercy . Their horsemen sound like the roaring sea , arrayed in battle formation against you , Daughter Zion .
CEB	Jeremiah	6	24	We have heard reports of them and are panic-stricken ; distress overwhelms us , pain like that of a woman in labor .
CEB	Jeremiah	6	25	Don ’ t go out into the field ! Don ’ t walk on the road ! The enemies ’ sword terrorizes at every turn .
CEB	Jeremiah	6	26	My people , put on funeral clothes and roll in ashes ; weep and wail as for an only child , because the destroyer will suddenly descend upon us . Prophet as tester
CEB	Jeremiah	6	27	I have made you a tester of metals , to examine my people [ h ] to know and prove their ways .
CEB	Jeremiah	6	28	They are tin [ i ] and iron ; they are headstrong and rebellious . They live to slander . They act corruptly—every last one !
CEB	Jeremiah	6	29	The bellows roar ; the lead is consumed . [ j ] Yet the refining fails ; the impurities [ k ] remain .

CEB	Jeremiah	7	2	Stand near the gate of the Lord ’ s temple and proclaim there this message : Listen to the Lord ’ s word , all you of Judah who enter these gates to worship the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	7	3	This is what the Lord of heavenly forces , the God of Israel , says : Improve your conduct and your actions , and I will dwell with you [ a ] in this place .
CEB	Jeremiah	7	4	Don ’ t trust in lies : “ This is the Lord ’ s temple ! The Lord ’ s temple ! The Lord ’ s temple ! ”
CEB	Jeremiah	7	5	No , if you truly reform your ways and your actions ; if you treat each other justly ;
CEB	Jeremiah	7	6	if you stop taking advantage of the immigrant , orphan , or widow ; if you don ’ t shed the blood of the innocent in this place , or go after other gods to your own ruin ,
CEB	Jeremiah	7	8	And yet you trust in lies that will only hurt you .
CEB	Jeremiah	7	9	Will you steal and murder , commit adultery and perjury , sacrifice to Baal and go after other gods that you don ’ t know ,
CEB	Jeremiah	7	10	and then come and stand before me in this temple that bears my name , and say , “ We are safe , ” only to keep on doing all these detestable things ?
CEB	Jeremiah	7	11	Do you regard this temple , which bears my name , as a hiding place for criminals ? I can see what ’ s going on here , declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	7	12	Just go to my sanctuary [ c ] in Shiloh , where I let my name dwell at first , and see what I did to it because of the evil of my people Israel .
CEB	Jeremiah	7	13	And now , because you have done all these things , declares the Lord , because you haven ’ t listened when I spoke to you again and again or responded when I called you ,
CEB	Jeremiah	7	14	I will do to this temple that bears my name and on which you rely , the place that I gave to you and your ancestors , just as I did to Shiloh .
CEB	Jeremiah	7	15	I will cast you out of my sight , just as I cast out the rest of your family , all the people of Ephraim .
CEB	Jeremiah	7	16	As for you , don ’ t pray for these people , don ’ t cry out or plead for them , and don ’ t intercede with me , for I won ’ t listen to you .
CEB	Jeremiah	7	17	Can ’ t you see what they are doing in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem ?
CEB	Jeremiah	7	18	The children gather wood , the fathers light the fire , and the women knead dough to make sacrificial cakes for the queen of heaven . And to offend me all the more , they pour out drink offerings to foreign gods .
CEB	Jeremiah	7	19	But am I the one they are really offending ? declares the Lord . Aren ’ t they in fact humiliating themselves ?
CEB	Jeremiah	7	20	Therefore , this is what the Lord God says : I ’ m going to pour out my fierce anger on this place , on humans and beasts , on the trees of the field and the crops of the fertile land . It will burn and not go out .
CEB	Jeremiah	7	21	This is what the Lord of heavenly forces , the God of Israel , says : Add your entirely burned offerings to your sacrifices and eat them yourselves !
CEB	Jeremiah	7	22	On the day I brought your ancestors out of the land of Egypt , I didn ’ t say a thing—I gave no instructions—about entirely burned offerings or sacrifices .
CEB	Jeremiah	7	23	Rather , this is what I required of them : Obey me so that I may become your God and you may become my people . Follow the path I mark out for you so that it may go well with you .
CEB	Jeremiah	7	24	But they didn ’ t listen or pay attention . They followed their willful and evil hearts and went backward rather than forward .
CEB	Jeremiah	7	25	From the moment your ancestors left the land of Egypt to this day , I have sent you all my servants the prophets—day after day .
CEB	Jeremiah	7	26	But they didn ’ t listen to me or pay attention ; they were stubborn and did more harm than their ancestors .
CEB	Jeremiah	7	27	When you tell them all this , they won ’ t listen to you . When you call to them , they won ’ t respond .
CEB	Jeremiah	7	28	Therefore , say to them : This nation neither obeys the Lord its God nor accepts correction ; truth has disappeared ; it has vanished from their lips .
CEB	Jeremiah	7	29	Cut off your hair and cast it away ; grieve on the well-traveled paths . The Lord has rejected you and has cast off a generation that provokes his anger .
CEB	Jeremiah	7	30	The people of Judah have done what displeases me , declares the Lord . They have corrupted the temple that bears my name by setting up their disgusting idols .
CEB	Jeremiah	7	31	They have built shrines at Topheth in the Ben-hinnom Valley to burn their sons and daughters in the fire , although I never commanded such a thing , nor did it ever cross my mind .
CEB	Jeremiah	7	32	So now the time is coming , declares the Lord , when people will no longer speak of Topheth or the Ben-hinnom Valley , but the Carnage Valley . They will bury in Topheth until no space is left .
CEB	Jeremiah	7	33	The corpses of this people will be food for birds and wild animals , with no one to drive them off .
CEB	Jeremiah	7	34	I will silence the sound of joy and delight as well as the voice of bride and bridegroom in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem , for the country will be reduced to a wasteland .

CEB	Jeremiah	8	4	Say to them , The Lord proclaims : When people fall down , don ’ t they get up ? When they turn aside , don ’ t they turn back ?
CEB	Jeremiah	8	5	Why then does this people , rebellious Jerusalem , persistently turn away from me ? They cling to deceit and refuse to return .
CEB	Jeremiah	8	6	I have listened carefully but haven ’ t heard a word of truth from them . No one regrets their wrongdoing ; no one says , “ What have I done ? ” Everyone turns to their own course , like a stallion dashing into the thick of battle .
CEB	Jeremiah	8	7	Even the stork in the sky knows the seasons , and the dove , swallow , [ a ] and crane [ b ] return in due time . But my people don ’ t know the Lord ’ s ways .
CEB	Jeremiah	8	9	The wise will be shamed and shocked when they are caught . Look , they have rejected the Lord ’ s word ; what kind of wisdom is that ?
CEB	Jeremiah	8	10	Therefore , I will give their wives to others and their fields to their captors . From the least to the greatest , all are eager to profit . From prophet to priest , all trade in falsehood .
CEB	Jeremiah	8	11	They treat the wound of my people as if it were nothing : “ All is well , all is well , ” they insist , when in fact nothing is well .
CEB	Jeremiah	8	12	They should be ashamed of their detestable practices , but they have no shame ; they don ’ t even blush ! Therefore , they will fall among the fallen and stumble when disaster arrives , declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	8	13	I will put an end to them , [ c ] declares the Lord ; there are no grapes on the vine , no figs on the tree , only withered leaves . They have squandered what I have given them ! [ d ] A lament for God ’ s people
CEB	Jeremiah	8	14	Why are we sitting here ? Come , let ’ s go to the fortified towns and meet our doom there . The Lord our God has doomed us by giving us poisoned water to drink , because we have sinned against the Lord !
CEB	Jeremiah	8	15	We longed for relief , but received none ; for a time of healing , but found only terror .
CEB	Jeremiah	8	16	The snorting of their horses can be heard as far as Dan ; the neighing of their stallions makes the whole land tremble . They come to devour the land and everything in it , towns and people alike .
CEB	Jeremiah	8	17	See , I ’ m sending serpents against you , vipers that you can ’ t charm , and they will bite you , declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	8	18	No healing , only grief ; my heart is broken . [ e ]
CEB	Jeremiah	8	19	Listen to the weeping of my people all across the land : “ Isn ’ t the Lord in Zion ? Is her king no longer there ? ” Why then did they anger me with their images , with pointless foreign gods ?
CEB	Jeremiah	8	20	“ The harvest is past , the summer has ended , yet we aren ’ t saved. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	8	21	Because my people are crushed , I am crushed ; darkness and despair overwhelm me . What to do with God ’ s people

CEB	Jeremiah	9	2	[ b ] If only I could flee for shelter in the desert , to leave my people and forget them— for they are all adulterers , a bunch of crooks .
CEB	Jeremiah	9	3	They bend their tongues like bows to spew out lies ; they are renowned in the land , but not for truth . They go from bad to worse . They don ’ t know me ! declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	9	4	Be wary of your friends ! Don ’ t trust your sibling ! [ c ] Every sibling is a cheater , and every friend traffics in slander .
CEB	Jeremiah	9	5	One cheats the other ; no one tells the truth ; they train themselves to lie ; they wear themselves out by doing wrong .
CEB	Jeremiah	9	6	You live in a world of deceit , and in their deceit they refuse to know me , [ d ] declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	9	7	Therefore , the Lord of heavenly forces proclaims : I ’ m going to refine and test them , for what else can I do with my people ?
CEB	Jeremiah	9	8	Their tongue is a lethal arrow ; their words are deceitful . They wish their neighbors well , but in their hearts plot their ruin .
CEB	Jeremiah	9	10	I will weep and wail for the mountains , and lament for the grazing lands in the wilderness . They are dried up and deserted ; no sound of the flocks is heard ; no sign of birds or animals is seen ; all have vanished .
CEB	Jeremiah	9	11	I will reduce Jerusalem to ruins , a den for wild dogs . I will make the towns of Judah a wasteland , without inhabitant .
CEB	Jeremiah	9	12	Who is wise enough to understand this ? Who has been taught by the Lord and can therefore explain it ? Why has the land been reduced to rubble and laid waste like a desert , with no one passing through ?
CEB	Jeremiah	9	13	The Lord says : It is because they have abandoned my Instruction that I gave them , and haven ’ t obeyed or followed it .
CEB	Jeremiah	9	14	Instead , they have followed their own willful hearts and have gone after the Baals , as their ancestors taught them .
CEB	Jeremiah	9	15	Therefore , this is what the Lord of heavenly forces , the God of Israel , says : I ’ m going to feed this people bitter food and give them poison to drink .
CEB	Jeremiah	9	16	I will scatter them among nations about whom neither they nor their ancestors have ever heard . I will pursue them with the sword until all are gone .
CEB	Jeremiah	9	17	The Lord of heavenly forces proclaims : Pay attention ! Summon the women who mourn , let them come ; send for those best trained , let them come .
CEB	Jeremiah	9	18	Hurry ! Let them weep for us so that our eyes fill up with tears and water streams down .
CEB	Jeremiah	9	19	The sound of sobbing is heard from Zion : “ We ’ re devastated ! We ’ re so ashamed ! We have to leave the land and abandon our homes ! ”
CEB	Jeremiah	9	20	Women , hear the Lord ’ s word . Listen closely to the word from his mouth : teach your daughters to mourn ; teach each other to grieve .
CEB	Jeremiah	9	21	Death has climbed through our windows ; it has entered our fortresses to eliminate children from the streets , the youth from the squares .
CEB	Jeremiah	9	22	Declare what the Lord says : Dead bodies will lie like dung on the fields , like bundles of grain after the harvest , with no one to pick them up .

CEB	Jeremiah	9	24	No , those who boast should boast in this : that they understand and know me . I am the Lord who acts with kindness , justice , and righteousness in the world , and I delight in these things , declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	9	25	The time is coming , declares the Lord , when I will deal with everyone who is physically circumcised :
CEB	Jeremiah	9	26	whether they are Egyptians or Judeans , Edomites or Ammonites , Moabites or the desert dwellers who cut the hair on their foreheads . All these nations are really uncircumcised ; even the people of Israel are uncircumcised in heart .

CEB	Jeremiah	10	10	But the Lord is the true God ! He ’ s the living God and the everlasting king ! When he ’ s angry , the earth quakes ; the nations can ’ t endure his rage .
CEB	Jeremiah	10	2	The Lord proclaims : Don ’ t follow the ways of the nations or be troubled by signs in the sky , even though the nations are troubled by them .
CEB	Jeremiah	10	3	The rituals of the nations are hollow : a tree from the forest is chopped down and shaped by the craftsman ’ s tools .
CEB	Jeremiah	10	4	It ’ s overlaid with silver and gold , and fastened securely with hammer and nails so it won ’ t fall over .
CEB	Jeremiah	10	5	They are no different than a scarecrow in a cucumber patch : they can ’ t speak ; they must be carried because they can ’ t walk . Don ’ t be afraid of them , because they can ’ t do harm or good .
CEB	Jeremiah	10	6	Lord , no one is like you ! You are great , and great is your mighty name .
CEB	Jeremiah	10	7	Who wouldn ’ t fear you , king of the nations ? That is your due ; among all the wise of the nations and in all their countries , there is no one like you !
CEB	Jeremiah	10	8	But they are both foolish and silly ; they offer nothing because they are mere wood .
CEB	Jeremiah	10	9	Covered with silver from Tarshish and gold from Uphaz , they are the work of a craftsman and the hands of a goldsmith . Clothed in blue and purple , all of them nothing more than the work of artisans .
CEB	Jeremiah	10	11	Tell them this : The gods who didn ’ t make the heavens and the earth will perish from the earth and from under the heavens . [ a ]
CEB	Jeremiah	10	12	But God made the earth by his might ; he shaped the world by his wisdom , crafted the skies by his knowledge .
CEB	Jeremiah	10	13	At the sound of his voice , the heavenly waters roar . He raises the clouds from the ends of the earth . He sends the lightning with the rain , the wind from his treasuries .
CEB	Jeremiah	10	14	Everyone is too foolish to understand ; every goldsmith is dishonored by his idols , for their images are shams ; they aren ’ t alive .
CEB	Jeremiah	10	15	They are a delusion , a charade ; at the appointed time they will vanish !
CEB	Jeremiah	10	16	Jacob ’ s portion is utterly different because God has formed all things , including Israel , his very own people— the Lord of heavenly forces is his name ! Get ready for exile !
CEB	Jeremiah	10	17	Pack your bags and get ready to leave , you who live under siege . [ b ]
CEB	Jeremiah	10	18	The Lord proclaims : I ’ m going to eject those who live in the land at this time ; I will badger them until they leave . [ c ]
CEB	Jeremiah	10	19	How terrible for me , due to my injury ; my wound is terrible . Yet I said to myself : This is my sickness , and I must bear it .
CEB	Jeremiah	10	20	But now my tent is destroyed ; all its ropes are cut , and my children are gone for good . There ’ s no one left to set up my tent frame and to attach the fabric .
CEB	Jeremiah	10	21	The shepherd kings have lost their senses and don ’ t seek answers from the Lord . That is why they have failed and their flock is scattered .
CEB	Jeremiah	10	22	Listen ! The sound is getting louder , a mighty uproar from the land of the north ; it will reduce the towns of Judah to ruins , a den for wild dogs .
CEB	Jeremiah	10	23	I know , Lord , that our lives are not our own , that we ’ re not able to direct our paths .
CEB	Jeremiah	10	24	So correct me , Lord , but with justice , not in your anger , or else you will reduce me to nothing .
CEB	Jeremiah	10	25	Pour out your wrath on the nations that ignore you and on the people who don ’ t call on you , since they have devoured Jacob ; they have devoured him completely and ruined his country .

CEB	Jeremiah	11	11	Therefore , the Lord proclaims : I will bring upon them a disaster from which they won ’ t be able to escape . They will cry out to me , but I won ’ t listen to them .
CEB	Jeremiah	11	2	Listen to the terms of this covenant and proclaim them to the people of Judah and the citizens of Jerusalem .
CEB	Jeremiah	11	3	Say to them : This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says : Cursed are those who don ’ t heed the terms of this covenant
CEB	Jeremiah	11	4	that I commanded your ancestors when I bought them out of the land of Egypt , that iron crucible , saying , Obey me and observe all that I instruct you . Then you will be my people and I , even I , will be your God .
CEB	Jeremiah	11	5	I will fulfill my solemn pledge that I made to your ancestors to give them a land full of milk and honey , as is the case today . And I replied , “ As you say , Lord ! ”
CEB	Jeremiah	11	6	The Lord said to me : Announce all these words in the towns of Judah and on the streets of Jerusalem : Obey the terms of this covenant and perform them .
CEB	Jeremiah	11	7	I repeatedly and tirelessly warned your ancestors when I brought them out of the land of Egypt to this very day , saying , Obey me .
CEB	Jeremiah	11	8	But they didn ’ t listen or pay attention ; they followed their own willful ambitions . So I brought upon them all the punishments I prescribed for violating this covenant—for refusing to obey .
CEB	Jeremiah	11	9	The Lord said to me : A conspiracy is taking place among the people of Judah and residents of Jerusalem .
CEB	Jeremiah	11	10	They have returned to the sins of their ancestors who refused to obey my words . They too are following other gods and serving them . The people of Israel and the people of Judah have broken my covenant that I made with their ancestors .
CEB	Jeremiah	11	12	Then the people of Judah and those living in Jerusalem will call upon the gods they worship , [ a ] but they won ’ t save them when disaster strikes .
CEB	Jeremiah	11	13	You have as many gods as you have towns , Judah , and you have as many shameful altars for worshipping Baal as you have streets in Jerusalem .
CEB	Jeremiah	11	14	As for you , don ’ t pray for these people , don ’ t cry out or plead for them , for I won ’ t listen when they cry out to me on account of their distress .
CEB	Jeremiah	11	15	What are my loved ones doing in my temple while working out their many evil schemes ? Can sacred offerings cancel your sin so that you revel in your evil deeds ? [ b ]
CEB	Jeremiah	11	16	The Lord named you , “ A blossoming olive tree , fair and fruitful ” ; but with the blast of a powerful storm he will set it ablaze , until its branches are completely consumed . [ c ]
CEB	Jeremiah	11	17	The Lord of heavenly forces who planted you has announced disaster for you , because the people of Israel and Judah have done evil and made me angry by worshipping Baal . Jeremiah ’ s lament
CEB	Jeremiah	11	18	The Lord informed me and I knew . Then he helped me see what they were up to .
CEB	Jeremiah	11	19	I was like a young lamb led to the slaughter ; I didn ’ t realize that they were planning their schemes against me : “ Let ’ s destroy the tree with its fruit ; let ’ s cut him off from the land of the living so that even any knowledge of him will be wiped out. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	11	20	Lord of heavenly forces , righteous judge , who tests the heart and mind , let me see your revenge upon them , because I have committed my case to you .
CEB	Jeremiah	11	21	This is what the Lord says concerning the men from Anathoth who seek your life and say , “ Don ’ t prophesy in the Lord ’ s name or else you will die at our hands. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	11	22	Therefore , the Lord of heavenly forces proclaims , I ’ m going to punish them . Their young men will die in war , and their sons and daughters will die by famine .
CEB	Jeremiah	11	23	No one will be left because I will bring disaster upon the men of Anathoth when their time comes . Footnotes - Jeremiah 11:12 Or to whom they burn incense - Jeremiah 11:15 Heb uncertain - Jeremiah 11:16 Vulg ; MT broken
CEB	Jeremiah	12	12	Over all the desert roads destroyers march ; for the sword of the Lord devours from one end of the land to the other ; no one is safe .
CEB	Jeremiah	12	2	You plant them , and they take root ; they flourish and bear fruit . You are always on their lips but far from their hearts .
CEB	Jeremiah	12	3	Yet you , Lord , you know me . You see me . You can tell that I love you . [ a ] So drag them away and butcher them like sheep . Prepare them for the slaughterhouse .
CEB	Jeremiah	12	4	How long will the land mourn and the grass in the fields dry up ? The animals and birds are swept away due to the evil of those in the land . The people say , “ God doesn ’ t see what we ’ re up to ! ”
CEB	Jeremiah	12	5	If you have raced with people and are worn out , how will you compete with horses ? If you fall down in an open field , [ b ] how will you survive in the forest along the Jordan ?
CEB	Jeremiah	12	6	Even your relatives , your very family , are planning to trap you . They are out to get you . So don ’ t trust them , even if they appear to be on your side . God ’ s lament over Judah ’ s destruction
CEB	Jeremiah	12	7	I have abandoned my house ; I have deserted my inheritance . I have given the one I love into the power of her enemies .
CEB	Jeremiah	12	8	My inheritance has turned against me like a lion in the forest ; she growls at me ; therefore , I have rejected her .
CEB	Jeremiah	12	9	My inheritance has become like a bird of prey , surrounded and attacked . [ c ] Go , gather all the wild animals for the feast .
CEB	Jeremiah	12	10	Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard ; they have trampled down my field ; they have reduced my treasured field to a desolate wilderness .
CEB	Jeremiah	12	11	They have devastated her ; desolate , she cries out to me in distress : “ The whole land is desolate , and no one seems to care. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	12	13	They have sown wheat and reaped weeds ; they have worn themselves out for nothing . They will be ashamed of their [ d ] harvest on account of the Lord ’ s fierce anger .
CEB	Jeremiah	12	14	The Lord proclaims : The evil nations have seized the land [ e ] that I gave my people Israel . I ’ m going to dig them up from their own lands , and I will dig up the people of Judah from among them .
CEB	Jeremiah	12	15	And after I have dug them up , I will again have compassion on them and restore their inheritance and their land .
CEB	Jeremiah	12	16	And then , if they will learn the ways of my people , to make a solemn pledge in my name , “ As the Lord lives , ” just as they once taught my people to swear to Baal , then they will be built up in the midst of my people .
CEB	Jeremiah	12	17	But if they don ’ t listen , I will dig up that nation ; yes , I will dig up and destroy , declares the Lord .

CEB	Jeremiah	13	13	Then you should say to them : The Lord proclaims : I ’ m going to fill everyone who lives in this country with wine that makes them drunk , including the kings on David ’ s throne , the priests , the prophets , and all those living in Jerusalem .
CEB	Jeremiah	13	2	So I bought a linen undergarment , as the Lord told me , and I put it on .
CEB	Jeremiah	13	3	The Lord spoke to me again :
CEB	Jeremiah	13	4	Take the undergarment that you are wearing and go at once to the Euphrates and put it under a rock .
CEB	Jeremiah	13	5	So I went and buried it at the Euphrates , [ a ] as the Lord instructed .
CEB	Jeremiah	13	6	After a long time , the Lord said to me : Return to the Euphrates and dig up the undergarment that I commanded you to bury there .
CEB	Jeremiah	13	7	So I went to the Euphrates and I dug up the linen undergarment from the place I had buried it . But it was ruined and good for nothing .
CEB	Jeremiah	13	8	Then the Lord ’ s word came to me :
CEB	Jeremiah	13	9	The Lord proclaims : In the same way I will ruin the brazen pride of Judah and Jerusalem !
CEB	Jeremiah	13	10	Instead of listening to me , this wicked people follow their own willful hearts and pursue other gods , worshipping and serving them . They will become like this linen garment—good for nothing !
CEB	Jeremiah	13	11	Just as a linen undergarment clings to the body , so I created the people of Israel and Judah to cling to me , declares the Lord , to be my people for my honor , praise , and grandeur . But they wouldn ’ t obey .
CEB	Jeremiah	13	12	So deliver this word to them : The Lord the God of Israel proclaims : Every wine jug should be filled with wine . And they will answer you , “ Don ’ t we already know that ? Obviously every wine jug should be filled with wine ! ”
CEB	Jeremiah	13	14	And I will shatter every one of them , even parents and children , declares the Lord . I won ’ t take pity ; I won ’ t have compassion ; I will show no mercy when I destroy them .
CEB	Jeremiah	13	15	Listen closely , don ’ t be arrogant , for the Lord has spoken .
CEB	Jeremiah	13	16	Honor the Lord your God , before it ’ s too late , before you stumble on the mountain paths in the evening shadows . Then you will hope for light , only to find darkness and gloom .
CEB	Jeremiah	13	17	If you are too proud to listen , I will go off alone and cry my eyes out . I will weep uncontrollably because the Lord ’ s flock will be dragged off into exile .
CEB	Jeremiah	13	18	Tell the king and the queen mother : Come down from your lofty place , because your glorious crowns will soon be removed from your heads .
CEB	Jeremiah	13	19	The towns of the arid southern plain will be surrounded ; no one will get in or out ; all Judah will be taken into exile ; everyone will be led away .
CEB	Jeremiah	13	20	Lift up your eyes and see who is approaching from the north . Where is the flock entrusted to you , your beautiful flock ?
CEB	Jeremiah	13	21	What will you say when he appoints someone as head over you : your defenders , your trusted allies ? [ b ] Won ’ t pain grip you like that of a woman in labor ?
CEB	Jeremiah	13	22	And when you ask yourself , Why have all these things happened to me ? it is because of your many sins that you have been stripped and violated .
CEB	Jeremiah	13	23	Can a Cushite change his skin or a leopard its spots ? Neither can you do good when doing evil comes so naturally .
CEB	Jeremiah	13	24	So I will scatter you [ c ] like straw that is blown away by the desert winds .
CEB	Jeremiah	13	25	This is the future that I have prepared for you , declares the Lord , because you have forgotten me and trusted in lies .
CEB	Jeremiah	13	26	I myself will pull up your skirt over your face and expose your shame .
CEB	Jeremiah	13	27	I have seen your adultery and lust , your disgusting idols and shameless prostitution on the hills and in the fields . How terrible for you , Jerusalem ! How long will you remain dirty ? Footnotes - Jeremiah 13:5 Heb Perath - Jeremiah 13:21 Heb uncertain - Jeremiah 13:24 Or them
CEB	Jeremiah	14	14	Then the Lord said to me : The prophets are telling lies in my name . I haven ’ t sent them . I haven ’ t commanded them . I haven ’ t spoken to them . They are prophesying to you false visions , worthless predictions , and deceit they have made up on their own .
CEB	Jeremiah	14	2	Judah mourns ; her gates wither away . The people fall to the ground in sorrow , as sobs of Jerusalem ascend .
CEB	Jeremiah	14	3	The rich send their servants for water , but the wells run dry . They return with empty jars , ashamed , bewildered , and in despair .
CEB	Jeremiah	14	4	Because the ground is cracked due to lack of rain , the farmers too are ashamed ; they cover their heads .
CEB	Jeremiah	14	5	Even the doe in the field abandons her newborn , for there ’ s no grass .
CEB	Jeremiah	14	6	The wild donkeys stand on the well-traveled paths , panting like thirsty dogs ; they go blind since there ’ s nothing to eat .
CEB	Jeremiah	14	7	Even though our sins testify against us , help us , Lord , for your name ’ s sake . We have turned away from you and sinned against you time and again .
CEB	Jeremiah	14	8	You are the hope of Israel , its savior in times of trouble . Why are you like a stranger in the land , like a tourist spending only the night ?
CEB	Jeremiah	14	9	Why are you like one taken by surprise , like a warrior unable to act ? Yet you are in our midst , Lord ; we are called by your name . Don ’ t give up on us .
CEB	Jeremiah	14	10	This is what the Lord proclaims about this people : Since they have loved to wander off and haven ’ t restrained themselves , I [ a ] won ’ t accept them . Now I will recall their wrongdoing and punish their sin .
CEB	Jeremiah	14	11	The Lord said to me : Don ’ t pray for the safety of these people .
CEB	Jeremiah	14	12	When they fast , I won ’ t pay attention to their pleas , and when they offer entirely burned offerings and grain offerings , I won ’ t accept them . Instead , I will devour them with war , famine , and disease .
CEB	Jeremiah	14	13	I replied , “ Lord God , the prophets are telling them : ‘ You won ’ t see war or famine , for I will give you lasting peace in this place. ’ ”
CEB	Jeremiah	14	15	Therefore , this is what the Lord proclaims concerning the prophets who are speaking in my name when I didn ’ t send them , and who are telling you that war or famine will never come to this land : Those very prophets will die in war and by famine !
CEB	Jeremiah	14	16	And the people they are prophesying to will be thrown into the streets of Jerusalem , victims of famine and war . There will be no one to bury them or their wives and children . I will pour out on them their own wickedness .
CEB	Jeremiah	14	17	So deliver this word to them : My eyes well up with tears ; I can ’ t stop weeping—day and night , because my virgin daughter , my people , has suffered a crushing blow and is mortally wounded .
CEB	Jeremiah	14	18	If I go into the fields , I see only the slain in battle . If I enter the city , I see only those suffering from famine . Even both prophet and priest wander about aimlessly in ignorance .
CEB	Jeremiah	14	19	Have you completely rejected Judah ? Do you hate Zion ? Why then have you mortally wounded us ? We look for peace , but nothing good comes of it ; for a time of healing , only to be terrorized .
CEB	Jeremiah	14	20	We acknowledge our sin , Lord , the wrongdoing of our ancestors , because we have sinned against you .
CEB	Jeremiah	14	21	For your name ’ s sake , don ’ t reject us , don ’ t scorn your glorious throne . Remember your covenant with us ; don ’ t break it .
CEB	Jeremiah	14	22	Can any of the false gods of the nations make it rain ? Can the sky by itself bring showers ? Aren ’ t you the Lord , our God ? You are our hope , since only you can do such things . Footnotes - Jeremiah 14:10 Or the Lord
CEB	Jeremiah	15	15	You understand , Lord ! Remember me and act on my behalf . Bring judgment on those who torment me . In your mercy , spare my life . [ d ] Consider how I ’ m insulted on your account .
CEB	Jeremiah	15	2	And if they say , “ Go where ? ” tell them , This is what the Lord proclaims : Those marked for death—to death , those marked for war—to war , those marked for famine—to famine , and those marked for exile—to exile .
CEB	Jeremiah	15	3	I will appoint over them four agents [ a ] of death , declares the Lord : soldiers to kill , dogs to drag off , and vultures and wild animals to devour and destroy .
CEB	Jeremiah	15	4	Because of what Judah ’ s King Manasseh , Hezekiah ’ s son , has done in Jerusalem , I will make them an object of horror to all nations on earth .
CEB	Jeremiah	15	5	Who will pity you , Jerusalem ? Who will shed tears over you ? Who will stop and ask how you ’ re doing ?
CEB	Jeremiah	15	6	You have deserted me , declares the Lord . You have turned your back on me . So I will turn my hand against you and destroy you . I ’ m tired of holding back .
CEB	Jeremiah	15	7	I will winnow them with a winnowing fork at the gates of their country . I will bereave and destroy my people because they haven ’ t changed their ways .
CEB	Jeremiah	15	8	Their widows will outnumber the sand on the shore . I will bring a destroyer in broad daylight against the mothers of young men . [ b ] Suddenly I will bring distress and terror upon them .
CEB	Jeremiah	15	9	The mother of seven will grow weak and gasp for air ; her sun will set while it is yet day ; she will be ashamed and disgraced . I will deliver the survivors to the sword , to the power of their enemies , declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	15	10	I wish I had never been born ! I have become a source of conflict and dissension in my own country . Even though I haven ’ t lent or borrowed , still everyone curses me .
CEB	Jeremiah	15	11	The Lord said : Haven ’ t I taken care of you ? Haven ’ t I helped you with your enemies in time of trouble and distress ? [ c ]
CEB	Jeremiah	15	12	Can a person shatter iron , iron from the north , or bronze ?
CEB	Jeremiah	15	13	Your wealth and belongings I will deliver as plunder , without a fee , because of all your sins throughout your territory .
CEB	Jeremiah	15	14	I will make you serve your enemies in a land you don ’ t know , for my anger blazes like a fire that won ’ t go out .
CEB	Jeremiah	15	16	When your words turned up , I feasted on them ; and they became my joy , the delight of my heart , because I belong to you , Lord God of heavenly forces .
CEB	Jeremiah	15	17	I didn ’ t join the festive occasions ; I took no delight in them . I sat alone because your hand was upon me and you had filled me with curses .
CEB	Jeremiah	15	18	Why am I always in pain ? Why is my wound incurable , so far beyond healing ? You have become for me as unreliable as a spring gone dry !
CEB	Jeremiah	15	19	Therefore , the Lord proclaims : If you return to me , I will take you back and let you stand before me . If you utter what is worthwhile , not what is worthless , you will be my spokesman . They will turn to you , not you to them !
CEB	Jeremiah	15	20	I will make you a sturdy bronze wall against these people . They will attack you , but they won ’ t triumph , because I am with you to protect and rescue you , declares the Lord .

CEB	Jeremiah	16	16	I ’ m going to send hordes of fishermen to catch them , declares the Lord . Afterward I will send a party of hunters to hunt them down on every mountain , hill , and cave .
CEB	Jeremiah	16	2	Don ’ t marry or have children in this place .
CEB	Jeremiah	16	3	This is what the Lord proclaims concerning children who are born in this place and their mothers and fathers who give birth to them in this place :
CEB	Jeremiah	16	4	They will die of horrible diseases . No one will mourn for them or bury them . They will be like refuse lying on the ground . They will die from the sword and by famine , and their corpses will be food for birds and wild animals .
CEB	Jeremiah	16	5	This is what the Lord says : Don ’ t enter a house where there is mourning ; don ’ t grieve or lament for them , for I have taken away my blessing , kindness , and mercy from this people , declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	16	6	From the least to the greatest , all will die in this land , and there will be no funerals or time of mourning . No one will gash themselves in grief or shave their heads in sorrow .
CEB	Jeremiah	16	7	No one will bring food [ a ] for the mourner as comfort for the dead . No one will offer a cup of consolation for the loss of father or mother .
CEB	Jeremiah	16	8	Don ’ t enter a house where there is feasting and sit down to eat and drink .
CEB	Jeremiah	16	9	This is what the Lord of heavenly forces , the God of Israel , proclaims : Before your very eyes and in your own lifetime , I will silence in this place the sounds of joy and gladness and the voices of the bridegroom and the bride .
CEB	Jeremiah	16	10	When you proclaim all these things to the people , and they ask you , “ Why has the Lord pronounced such massive devastation against us ? What have we done wrong ? How have we sinned against the Lord our God ? ”
CEB	Jeremiah	16	11	then you should tell them : It ’ s because your ancestors have deserted me and followed other gods , declares the Lord . They have served and worshipped them , while abandoning me and refusing to keep my Instruction .
CEB	Jeremiah	16	12	And you , you have acted worse than your ancestors , each of you following your own willful , evil hearts and paying no attention to me .
CEB	Jeremiah	16	13	So I will banish you from this land to a place that neither you nor your ancestors have known , and there you will serve other gods day and night , for I will show you no mercy .
CEB	Jeremiah	16	14	But the time is coming , declares the Lord , when no one will say , “ As the Lord lives who brought up the Israelites from the land of Egypt ” ;
CEB	Jeremiah	16	15	instead , they will say , “ As the Lord lives who brought up the Israelites from the land of the north and from all the lands where he has banished them. ” I will bring them back to the land that I gave to their ancestors .
CEB	Jeremiah	16	17	I am watching their every move ; not one is hidden from me . Nor is their sin concealed from my sight .
CEB	Jeremiah	16	18	I will initially pay them back double for their evil and sin , because they have corrupted my land with their disgusting , lifeless idols and have filled my inheritance with their detestable practices .
CEB	Jeremiah	16	19	Lord , you are my strength and my stronghold ; you are my refuge in time of trouble . The nations will flock to you from the ends of the earth , and they will say : “ Our ancestors have inherited utter lies , things that are hollow and useless. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	16	20	Can humans make their own gods ? If so , they are not gods at all !

CEB	Jeremiah	17	4	You will lose the inheritance that I gave you . I will make you slaves of your enemies in a land you don ’ t know , for my anger blazes like a fire that won ’ t go out .
CEB	Jeremiah	17	5	The Lord proclaims : Cursed are those who trust in mere humans , who depend on human strength and turn their hearts from the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	17	6	They will be like a desert shrub that doesn ’ t know when relief comes . They will live in the parched places of the wilderness , in a barren land where no one survives .
CEB	Jeremiah	17	7	Happy are those who trust in the Lord , who rely on the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	17	8	They will be like trees planted by the streams , whose roots reach down to the water . They won ’ t fear drought when it comes ; their leaves will remain green . They won ’ t be stressed in the time of drought or fail to bear fruit .
CEB	Jeremiah	17	9	The most cunning heart— it ’ s beyond help . Who can figure it out ?

CEB	Jeremiah	17	13	Lord , the hope of Israel , all who forsake you will suffer disgrace ; those who turn away from you [ c ] in the land will be written off , [ d ] for they have abandoned the Lord , the fountain of living water .
CEB	Jeremiah	17	14	Heal me , Lord , and I ’ ll be healed . Save me and I ’ ll be saved , for you are my heart ’ s desire .
CEB	Jeremiah	17	15	See how they harass me : “ Where ’ s the Lord ’ s word ? Let it come now ! ”
CEB	Jeremiah	17	16	Yet I didn ’ t urge you to bring disaster ; [ e ] I didn ’ t want the calamity to happen . You know what comes out of my mouth ; it ’ s always before you .
CEB	Jeremiah	17	18	Let my tormentors be disgraced , but not me ; let them be terrorized , but not me . Bring on them the time of disaster , as they deserve ; destroy them repeatedly .

CEB	Jeremiah	17	20	and say to them : Listen to the Lord ’ s word , you kings of Judah , all you people of Judah , and anyone living in Jerusalem who passes through these gates .
CEB	Jeremiah	17	21	The Lord says : Be on guard not to carry a load on the Sabbath day or conduct business at the gates of Jerusalem .
CEB	Jeremiah	17	22	Don ’ t carry a load from your houses or do any kind of work on the Sabbath day . Rather , keep the Sabbath day holy as I commanded your ancestors ,
CEB	Jeremiah	17	23	although they didn ’ t listen or pay attention . They were stubborn and wouldn ’ t obey or accept correction .
CEB	Jeremiah	17	24	If you are careful to obey me , declares the Lord , and don ’ t conduct business at the gates of this city on the Sabbath day , if you keep the Sabbath day holy by not working ,
CEB	Jeremiah	17	25	then through the gates of this city will come kings who occupy the throne of David and their officers , all riding on chariots and horses . They will be accompanied by the people of Judah and those living in Jerusalem . And this city will always be inhabited .
CEB	Jeremiah	17	26	Others will come from the towns of Judah and Benjamin , from all around Jerusalem , and from the western foothills , the highlands , and the arid southern plain—they will come bringing entirely burned offerings , sacrifices , grain offerings , incense , and thanksgiving offerings to the Lord ’ s temple .
CEB	Jeremiah	17	27	But if you don ’ t obey me by keeping the Sabbath day holy , if you carry your loads and conduct your business at the gates of Jerusalem as usual , then I will set fire to those gates that will completely engulf the fortresses of Jerusalem ; it will not be put out .

CEB	Jeremiah	18	18	Then they said , “ Come , let ’ s unite against Jeremiah , for the priest ’ s instruction won ’ t fail , nor will the sage ’ s counsel , nor the prophet ’ s word . Come , let ’ s silence him and pay no attention to his words. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	18	2	Go down to the potter ’ s house , and I ’ ll give you instructions about what to do there .
CEB	Jeremiah	18	3	So I went down to the potter ’ s house ; he was working on the potter ’ s wheel .
CEB	Jeremiah	18	4	But the piece he was making was flawed while still in his hands , so the potter started on another , as seemed best to him .
CEB	Jeremiah	18	5	Then the Lord ’ s word came to me :
CEB	Jeremiah	18	6	House of Israel , can ’ t I deal with you like this potter , declares the Lord ? Like clay in the potter ’ s hand , so are you in mine , house of Israel !
CEB	Jeremiah	18	7	At any time I may announce that I will dig up , pull down , and destroy a nation or kingdom ;
CEB	Jeremiah	18	8	but if that nation I warned turns from its evil , then I ’ ll relent and not carry out the harm I intended for it .
CEB	Jeremiah	18	9	At the same time , I may announce that I will build and plant a nation or kingdom ;
CEB	Jeremiah	18	10	but if that nation displeases and disobeys me , then I ’ ll relent and not carry out the good I intended for it .
CEB	Jeremiah	18	11	Now say to the people of Judah and those living in Jerusalem : This is what the Lord says : I am a potter preparing a disaster for you ; I ’ m working out a plan against you . So each one of you , turn from your evil ways ; reform your ways and your actions .
CEB	Jeremiah	18	12	But they said , “ What ’ s the use ! We will follow our own plans and act according to our own willful , evil hearts. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	18	13	Therefore , the Lord proclaims : Ask among the nations : Have you ever heard anything like this ? Virgin Israel has done the most horrible thing .
CEB	Jeremiah	18	14	Does the snow on the mountains of Lebanon ever melt entirely off their rocky cliffs ? Do the cool mountain streams ever dry up ? [ a ]
CEB	Jeremiah	18	15	Yet my people have forgotten me ; they have offered sacrifices to a lie . And so they have stumbled along the way , even along the ancient paths . They have taken side roads , not the main roads . [ b ]
CEB	Jeremiah	18	16	They have ruined their country and brought utter shame on it . All who pass by are shocked and shake their heads .
CEB	Jeremiah	18	17	Like a strong east wind , I will scatter them before their enemy . When disaster strikes them , I will show them my back , not my face .
CEB	Jeremiah	18	19	Pay attention to me , Lord ; listen to what my enemies are saying .
CEB	Jeremiah	18	20	Should evil be returned for good ? Yet they have set traps for me . Remember that I stood before you , begging you to be merciful and not to punish them .
CEB	Jeremiah	18	21	Enough ! Let their children starve ; let them die by the sword . Let their wives be barren widows ; let their men be slaughtered and their youth struck down in battle .
CEB	Jeremiah	18	22	Let screams be heard from their homes when you suddenly bring armies against them . They have dug a pit to capture me , set traps for my feet .
CEB	Jeremiah	18	23	But you , Lord , you know all their sinister plots to kill me . Don ’ t overlook their wrongdoing ; don ’ t cleanse their sin from before you . May they stumble before you ; when you become angry , do something about them . Footnotes - Jeremiah 18:14 Heb uncertain ; or be dug up - Jeremiah 18:15 Heb uncertain
CEB	Jeremiah	19	19	The Lord proclaims : Go buy a clay jar from a potter in the presence of the elders of the people and the priests .
CEB	Jeremiah	19	2	Then go out to the Ben-hinnom Valley at the entrance of the gate called Broken Pots and proclaim there the words I will tell you .
CEB	Jeremiah	19	3	Listen to the Lord ’ s word , you kings of Judah and those of you living in Jerusalem : This is what the Lord of heavenly forces , the God of Israel , says : I ’ m going to bring such disaster upon this place that it will shock all who hear of it .
CEB	Jeremiah	19	4	They have deserted me and degraded this place into a shrine for other gods , which neither they nor their ancestors nor Judah ’ s kings have ever known . And they have filled this place with the blood of the innocent .
CEB	Jeremiah	19	5	Yes , they have built shrines to Baal , to burn their sons and daughters in the fire , although I never commanded or ordered such a thing , nor did it ever cross my mind .
CEB	Jeremiah	19	6	So now the time is coming , declares the Lord , when people will no longer call this place Topheth or Ben-hinnom Valley but Carnage Valley .
CEB	Jeremiah	19	7	I will foil the plans of Judah and Jerusalem in this place and will have them fall in battle before their enemies , before those who seek their lives . I will give their corpses as food to the birds and the wild animals .
CEB	Jeremiah	19	8	I will make this city something that sounds horrible ; all who pass by it will be shocked at its pain .
CEB	Jeremiah	19	9	And when their enemies lay siege to the city , seeking their lives , they will resort in desperation to eating the flesh of their sons and daughters , and to devouring the flesh of their neighbors .
CEB	Jeremiah	19	10	Then you should shatter the clay jar in the sight of the people who are with you ,
CEB	Jeremiah	19	11	and you should say to them : This is what the Lord of heavenly forces says : Just as one smashes the potter ’ s piece beyond repair , so I will smash this people and this city . And they will bury the dead in Topheth until there ’ s no room left .
CEB	Jeremiah	19	12	That is what I will do to this place and its residents , declares the Lord : I will make this city like Topheth .
CEB	Jeremiah	19	13	The houses of Jerusalem and those of Judah ’ s kings will become as foul as Topheth—all the houses on whose roofs they made offerings to the heavenly force and poured out drink offerings to other gods .
CEB	Jeremiah	19	14	When Jeremiah returned from Topheth where the Lord had sent him to prophesy , he stood in the court of the Lord ’ s temple and said to all the people :
CEB	Jeremiah	19	15	The Lord of heavenly forces , the God of Israel , proclaims : I am about to bring upon this city and its surrounding towns every disaster that I have pronounced against them , because they have been stubborn and wouldn ’ t obey my words .
CEB	Jeremiah	20	20	When the priest Pashhur , Immer ’ s son , the officer in charge of the Lord ’ s temple , heard Jeremiah prophesying these words ,
CEB	Jeremiah	20	2	he beat the prophet and detained him in confinement at the upper Benjamin Gate in the Lord ’ s temple .
CEB	Jeremiah	20	3	The next day , when Pashhur released Jeremiah from confinement , Jeremiah said to him , “ The Lord has changed your name from Pashhur to Panic Lurks Everywhere .
CEB	Jeremiah	20	4	The Lord proclaims : I ’ m going to strike panic into your heart and into the hearts of your friends . You will watch as they fall in battle to their enemies . I will hand over all Judah to the king of Babylon , who will exile some to Babylon and slaughter others .
CEB	Jeremiah	20	5	I will hand over all the wealth of this city , all its goods and valuables , including the treasures of the kings of Judah , to their enemies , who will ransack and pillage and carry it all off to Babylon .
CEB	Jeremiah	20	6	And you , Pashhur , and all those in your household , will go into captivity . You will be deported to Babylon where you will die . There you will be buried with all your friends to whom you prophesied falsely. ” Total despair
CEB	Jeremiah	20	7	Lord , you enticed me , and I was taken in . You were too strong for me , and you prevailed . Now I ’ m laughed at all the time ; everyone mocks me .
CEB	Jeremiah	20	8	Every time I open my mouth , I cry out and say , “ Violence and destruction ! ” The Lord ’ s word has brought me nothing but insult and injury , constantly .
CEB	Jeremiah	20	9	I thought , I ’ ll forget him ; I ’ ll no longer speak in his name . But there ’ s an intense fire in my heart , trapped in my bones . I ’ m drained trying to contain it ; I ’ m unable to do it .
CEB	Jeremiah	20	10	I hear many whispering— “ Panic Lurks Everywhere ! — proclaim , yes , let ’ s proclaim it ourselves ! ” All my friends are waiting for me to stumble : “ Perhaps he can be enticed . Then we ’ ll prevail against him and get our revenge on him ! ”
CEB	Jeremiah	20	11	But the Lord is with me like a strong defender . Therefore , my oppressors will stumble and not prevail . They will be disgraced by their own failures . Their dishonor will never be forgotten .
CEB	Jeremiah	20	12	The Lord of heavenly forces tests the righteous and discerns the heart and the mind . Let me see your retribution upon them , for I have committed my case to you .
CEB	Jeremiah	20	13	Sing to the Lord , praise the Lord , for he has rescued the needy from the clutches of evildoers .
CEB	Jeremiah	20	14	Cursed be the day that I was born . May the day my mother gave birth to me not be blessed .
CEB	Jeremiah	20	15	Cursed be the one who delivered the news to my father , “ You have a son ! ” — filling him with joy .
CEB	Jeremiah	20	16	May the bearer of that news be like the cities that the Lord destroyed without mercy . May he hear screams in the morning , and the battle cries at noon ,
CEB	Jeremiah	20	17	because he didn ’ t kill me in the womb and let my mother become my grave , her womb pregnant forever .
CEB	Jeremiah	20	18	Why was I ever born when all I see is suffering and misery , and my days are filled with shame ?
CEB	Jeremiah	21	21	Jeremiah received the Lord ’ s word when King Zedekiah sent Pashhur , Malchiah ’ s son , and the priest Zephaniah , Maaseiah ’ s son , to him with an appeal :
CEB	Jeremiah	21	2	“ Speak to the Lord on our behalf because Babylon ’ s King Nebuchadnezzar [ a ] is attacking us . Perhaps the Lord will perform one of his mighty deeds and force him to withdraw from us. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	21	3	Jeremiah answered them : This is what you should tell Zedekiah :
CEB	Jeremiah	21	4	The Lord , the God of Israel , says : I ’ m going to turn your own weapons against you , yes , the weapons you are using to fight the king of Babylon and the Babylonians [ b ] who have surrounded you ! I will round them up in the center of the city .
CEB	Jeremiah	21	5	Then I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and strong arm in fierce anger and rage .
CEB	Jeremiah	21	6	I will strike down those within this city—both people and animals—and they will die of a terrible plague .
CEB	Jeremiah	21	7	Afterward , declares the Lord , I will deliver Judah ’ s King Zedekiah , his servants , and those in this city who have survived plague , war , and famine to Babylon ’ s King Nebuchadnezzar [ c ] and to their enemies who seek to do them harm . He will put them to the sword without pity , mercy , or compassion .
CEB	Jeremiah	21	8	This is what you should tell this people : The Lord says : I ’ m setting before you the way of life and the way of death .
CEB	Jeremiah	21	9	Whoever stays in the city will die by the sword , famine , and disease . But whoever leaves the city and surrenders to the Babylonians [ d ] will live ; yes , their lives will be spared .
CEB	Jeremiah	21	10	I have set my face against this city for harm and not for good , declares the Lord ; it will be delivered to the king of Babylon , who will set it on fire . Judah : Hear the Lord ’ s word
CEB	Jeremiah	21	11	House of Judah ! This is what the Lord says :
CEB	Jeremiah	21	12	House of David ! The Lord proclaims : Begin each morning by administering justice , rescue from their oppressor those who have been robbed , or else my anger will spread like a wildfire , with no one to put it out , because of your evil deeds .
CEB	Jeremiah	21	13	I am against you , you who live in the valley , [ e ] like a rock of the plain , declares the Lord , and who say , “ Who will come down to attack us ? Who will breach our fortresses ? ”
CEB	Jeremiah	21	14	I will punish you based on what you have done , declares the Lord . I will set your [ f ] forests on fire ; the flames will engulf everything around you .

CEB	Jeremiah	22	22	Your shepherds will be tossed to the wind , your lovers taken off to exile . Then you will be embarrassed and humiliated by all your wickedness .
CEB	Jeremiah	22	2	Listen to the Lord ’ s word , king of Judah , you who sit on David ’ s throne—you and your attendants , and all those who go through these gates .
CEB	Jeremiah	22	3	The Lord proclaims : Do what is just and right ; rescue the oppressed from the power of the oppressor . Don ’ t exploit or mistreat the refugee , the orphan , and the widow . Don ’ t spill the blood of the innocent in this place .
CEB	Jeremiah	22	4	If you obey this command , then through the gates of this palace will come kings who occupy the throne of David , riding on chariots and horses along with their entourage and subjects .
CEB	Jeremiah	22	5	But if you ignore these words , I swear by myself , declares the Lord , that this palace will become a ruin .
CEB	Jeremiah	22	6	The Lord proclaims concerning the palace of the king of Judah : Though you are like Gilead to me , like the summit of Lebanon , I will turn you into a desert—uninhabited cities .
CEB	Jeremiah	22	7	I will summon destroyers against you , who will use their weapons to cut down your finest cedars and hurl them into the fire .
CEB	Jeremiah	22	8	People from many nations will pass by this city and ask each other : “ Why has the Lord treated that great city like this ? ”
CEB	Jeremiah	22	9	And the answer will be , “ Because they abandoned the covenant with the Lord their God and worshipped and served other gods. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	22	10	Don ’ t weep or lament for the dead king . [ a ] Weep instead for the one who has gone away , for he will never return to see his native soil .
CEB	Jeremiah	22	11	This is what the Lord says about Shallum son of Judah ’ s King Josiah , who succeeded his father Josiah as king but who is now gone from this place : He will never return !
CEB	Jeremiah	22	12	He will die where he ’ s been exiled and never see this land again .
CEB	Jeremiah	22	13	How terrible for Jehoiakim , who builds his house with corruption and his upper chambers with injustice , working his countrymen for nothing , refusing to give them their wages .
CEB	Jeremiah	22	14	He says , “ I ’ ll build myself a grand palace , with huge upper chambers , ornate windows , cedar paneling , and rich red decor. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	22	15	Is this what makes you a king , having more cedar than anyone else ? Didn ’ t your father eat and drink and still do what was just and right ? Then it went well for him !
CEB	Jeremiah	22	16	He defended the rights of the poor and needy ; then it went well . Isn ’ t that what it means to know me ? declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	22	17	But you set your eyes and heart on nothing but unjust gain ; you spill the blood of the innocent ; you practice cruelty ; you oppress your subjects .
CEB	Jeremiah	22	18	Therefore , this is what the Lord says to Jehoiakim son of Judah ’ s King Josiah : They won ’ t grieve for him , saying , “ My brother , my sister ! ” They won ’ t grieve for him , saying , “ My master , my majesty ! ”
CEB	Jeremiah	22	19	They will give him a donkey ’ s burial , dragging him outside the gates of Jerusalem and dumping him there .
CEB	Jeremiah	22	20	Go up to Lebanon and cry out , lift up your voice in Bashan , cry out from Abarim , because all your lovers have been ravished .
CEB	Jeremiah	22	21	I spoke to you when you felt safe and secure , but you said , “ I won ’ t listen. ” You have been that way since your youth : not listening to a word I say .
CEB	Jeremiah	22	23	You who live in Lebanon , nestled in cedar , who will pity you [ b ] when you are overcome in pain , like that of childbirth ?
CEB	Jeremiah	22	24	As surely as I live , declares the Lord , even if Coniah , [ c ] King Jehoiakim ’ s son from Judah were a signet ring on my right hand , I would still remove you from there .
CEB	Jeremiah	22	25	I would hand you over to those who seek to kill you , those you dread , even Babylon ’ s King Nebuchadnezzar and his army . [ d ]
CEB	Jeremiah	22	26	I will banish you and your mother who bore you to a land far from your native soil , and there the two of you will die .
CEB	Jeremiah	22	27	You [ e ] will never return to the land you [ f ] long to go back to .
CEB	Jeremiah	22	28	Is this man Coniah merely a defiled and broken pottery jar that no one wants ? Why then have he and his children been hurled out and cast into an unfamiliar land ?
CEB	Jeremiah	22	29	Land , land , land , hear the Lord ’ s word :
CEB	Jeremiah	22	30	The Lord proclaims : Mark this man as childless ; he will not prosper during his lifetime . None of his children will sit on David ’ s throne and rule again in Judah .

CEB	Jeremiah	23	23	The Lord declares , Am I a God who is only nearby and not far off ?
CEB	Jeremiah	23	2	This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , proclaims about the shepherds who “ tend to ” my people : You are the ones who have scattered my flock and driven them away . You haven ’ t attended to their needs , so I will take revenge on you for the terrible things you have done to them , declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	23	3	I myself will gather the few remaining sheep from all the countries where I have driven them . I will bring them back to their pasture , and they will be fruitful and multiply .
CEB	Jeremiah	23	4	I will place over them shepherds who care for them . Then they will no longer be afraid or dread harm , nor will any be missing , declares the Lord . Promise of a righteous and just king
CEB	Jeremiah	23	5	The time is coming , declares the Lord , when I will raise up a righteous descendant [ a ] from David ’ s line , and he will rule as a wise king . He will do what is just and right in the land .
CEB	Jeremiah	23	6	During his lifetime , Judah will be saved and Israel will live in safety . And his name will be The Lord Is Our Righteousness . [ b ]
CEB	Jeremiah	23	7	So the time is coming , declares the Lord , when no one will say , “ As the Lord lives who brought up the Israelites from the land of Egypt. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	23	8	Instead , they will say , “ As the Lord lives who brought up the descendants of the people of Israel from the land of the north and from all the lands where he [ c ] has banished them so that they can live in their own land. ” Oracles against the prophets
CEB	Jeremiah	23	9	As for the prophets : My heart inside me is broken ; my body aches . [ d ] I stagger like a drunk who has had too much wine to drink , because of the Lord and because of God ’ s holy words .
CEB	Jeremiah	23	10	Because the country teems with adulterers , because of them , [ e ] yes , because their might isn ’ t right and their way is evil , the land dries up , and the grazing areas in the wilderness wither . [ f ]
CEB	Jeremiah	23	11	Both prophet and priest are godless ; I even find their evil in my temple , declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	23	12	Therefore , they will find themselves on slippery ground and will be thrust into darkness , where they will collapse . I will bring disaster upon them , when their time comes , declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	23	13	In the prophets of Samaria I saw something shocking : They prophesied by Baal and led astray my people Israel .
CEB	Jeremiah	23	14	In the prophets of Jerusalem I saw something horrible : They commit adultery and tell lies . They encourage evildoers so that no one turns from their wickedness . In my eyes , they are no better than Sodom ; its people are like Gomorrah .
CEB	Jeremiah	23	15	Therefore , this is what the Lord of heavenly forces proclaims concerning the prophets : I ’ m going to feed them bitter food and give them poison to drink . Wickedness has spread from the prophets of Jerusalem throughout the land .
CEB	Jeremiah	23	16	The Lord proclaims : Don ’ t listen to the prophets who are speaking to you ; they are deceiving you . Their visions come from their own hearts , not from the Lord ’ s mouth .
CEB	Jeremiah	23	17	They keep saying to those who scorn God ’ s message , “ All will go well for you , ” and to those who follow their own willful hearts , “ Nothing bad will happen to you. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	23	18	But who has stood in the Lord ’ s council to listen to God ’ s word ? Who has paid attention to his word and announced it ?
CEB	Jeremiah	23	19	Look ! The Lord ’ s angry storm breaks out ; it whirls around the heads of the wicked .
CEB	Jeremiah	23	20	The Lord ’ s fierce anger won ’ t turn back until it accomplishes all that he has planned . In the days to come , you will understand what this means .
CEB	Jeremiah	23	21	I didn ’ t send the prophets , yet they ran anyway . I didn ’ t speak to them , yet they prophesied anyway .
CEB	Jeremiah	23	22	If they had stood in my council , they would have proclaimed my words to my people ; they would have turned them from their evil ways and deeds .
CEB	Jeremiah	23	24	Can people hide themselves in secret places so I might not see them ? Don ’ t I fill heaven and earth ?
CEB	Jeremiah	23	25	I have heard the prophets prophesying lies in my name . They claim , “ I ’ ve had a dream ; I ’ ve had a dream ! ”
CEB	Jeremiah	23	26	How long will deceitful prophecies dominate the minds of the prophets ? Those prophets are treacherous .
CEB	Jeremiah	23	27	They scheme to make my people forget me by their dreams that people tell each other , just as their ancestors forgot me because of Baal .
CEB	Jeremiah	23	28	Let the prophet who has a dream declare it , but let the one who has my word proclaim it faithfully . What a difference between straw and wheat ! declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	23	29	Isn ’ t my word like fire and like a hammer that shatters rock ? declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	23	30	Therefore , I ’ m against the prophets who steal my words from each other , declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	23	31	I ’ m against the prophets who carelessly deliver oracles , [ g ] declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	23	32	I ’ m against the prophets who dream up lies and then proclaim them , declares the Lord . With their reckless lies , they lead my people astray . I didn ’ t send them ; I didn ’ t commission them . They are completely useless to these people , declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	23	33	When these people or a prophet or a priest asks you , “ What is the Lord ’ s message ? ” [ h ] say to them , “ What message ? I will cast you off , declares the Lord. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	23	34	I will punish anyone , including prophet or priest , who says , “ This is the Lord ’ s message. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	23	35	This is what you should ask each other : “ What has the Lord said ? ” “ What has the Lord declared ? ”
CEB	Jeremiah	23	36	But you are no longer to mention the Lord ’ s message , because everyone thinks they have received a message from the Lord . You destroy the very word of the living God , the Lord of heavenly forces , our God .
CEB	Jeremiah	23	37	So this is what you should say to the prophet : “ What has the Lord said to you ? ” “ What has the Lord declared ? ”
CEB	Jeremiah	23	38	But if you insist on saying , “ This is the Lord ’ s message , ” the Lord says to you : Because you have made this claim—this is the Lord ’ s message—when I told you not to proclaim the Lord ’ s message ,
CEB	Jeremiah	23	39	I will lift you up [ i ] and cast you out of my presence , together with the city that I gave to your ancestors .
CEB	Jeremiah	23	40	I will make you an object of disgrace and enduring shame that no one will ever forget .

CEB	Jeremiah	24	24	After Babylon ’ s King Nebuchadnezzar had deported Judah ’ s King Jeconiah , King Jehoiakim ’ s son , and the Judean officials , as well as the craftsmen and metalworkers from Jerusalem to Babylon , the Lord showed me two baskets of figs set in front of the Lord ’ s temple .
CEB	Jeremiah	24	2	One basket was filled with fresh and ripe figs ; the other basket was filled with rotten figs—too rotten to eat .
CEB	Jeremiah	24	3	And the Lord asked me : “ What do you see , Jeremiah ? ” I replied : “ Figs ! Some good ones and others very bad—so bad that they can ’ t be eaten. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	24	4	Then the Lord said to me :
CEB	Jeremiah	24	5	The Lord , the God of Israel , proclaims : Just as with these good figs , I will treat kindly the Judean exiles that I have sent from this place to Babylon .
CEB	Jeremiah	24	6	I regard them as good , and I will bring them back to this land . I will build them up and not pull them down ; I will plant them and not dig them up .
CEB	Jeremiah	24	7	I will give them a heart to know me , for I am the Lord . They will be my people , and I will be their God , for they will return to me with all their heart .
CEB	Jeremiah	24	8	And just like the rotten figs that are so bad that they can ’ t be eaten , the Lord says , I will do to Judah ’ s King Zedekiah and his officials , as well as the remaining few in Jerusalem and those who are living in Egypt .
CEB	Jeremiah	24	9	I will make them an object of horror and evil to all the kingdoms of the earth . Wherever I scatter them , they will be disgraced and insulted , mocked and cursed .
CEB	Jeremiah	24	10	I will send the sword , famine , and disease against them until they vanish from the fertile land that I gave to their ancestors .
CEB	Jeremiah	25	25	all the kings of Zimri , [ d ] Elam , and Media ;
CEB	Jeremiah	25	2	The prophet Jeremiah addressed all the people of Judah and all those living in Jerusalem .
CEB	Jeremiah	25	3	From the thirteenth year of Judah ’ s King Josiah , Amon ’ s son , to this very day—twenty-three years—the Lord ’ s word has come to me . I have delivered it to you repeatedly , although you wouldn ’ t listen .
CEB	Jeremiah	25	4	In fact , the Lord has tirelessly sent you all his servants , the prophets , but you wouldn ’ t listen or pay attention .
CEB	Jeremiah	25	5	They said , “ Each one of you , turn from your evil ways and deeds and live in the fertile land that the Lord gave you and your ancestors for all time .
CEB	Jeremiah	25	6	Don ’ t follow or worship other gods and don ’ t anger me by what you make with your hands . Then I won ’ t bring disaster upon you. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	25	7	But you wouldn ’ t listen to me , making me angry by what you do and bringing disaster upon yourselves , declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	25	8	Therefore , this is what the Lord of heavenly forces says : Because you haven ’ t listened to my words ,
CEB	Jeremiah	25	9	I am going to muster all the tribes of the north and my servant King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon , declares the Lord , and I will bring them against this country and its residents as well as against all the surrounding nations . I will completely destroy them and will make them an object of horror , shock , and ruins for all time .
CEB	Jeremiah	25	10	I will silence the sounds of joy and laughter and the voices of the bride and the bridegroom . Yes , I will silence the millstones and snuff out the lamplight .
CEB	Jeremiah	25	11	This whole country will be reduced to a wasteland , and these nations will serve the king of Babylon for seventy years .
CEB	Jeremiah	25	12	When the seventy years are over , I will punish the king of Babylon and his nation for their wrongdoing , declares the Lord . I will reduce the land of the Babylonians to a wasteland for all time .
CEB	Jeremiah	25	13	I will unleash upon that land everything I decreed , all that is written in this scroll , which Jeremiah prophesied against all the nations .
CEB	Jeremiah	25	14	Yes , many great nations and powerful kings will enslave them , and I will pay them back in full for what they have done and made with their hands .
CEB	Jeremiah	25	15	This is what the Lord , God of Israel , said to me : Take this seething cup of wine from my hand and make all the nations gulp it down where I ’ m sending you .
CEB	Jeremiah	25	16	They will drink and stagger about half-crazed because of the sword that I am sending against them .
CEB	Jeremiah	25	17	So I took the cup from the Lord ’ s hand , and I made all the nations drink from it where the Lord had sent me :
CEB	Jeremiah	25	18	Jerusalem and the towns of Judah , its kings and officials . This was to make them a wasteland , an object of horror , shock , and cursing , as it is today ;
CEB	Jeremiah	25	19	Pharaoh , Egypt ’ s king , his attendants and officials , and all his people ,
CEB	Jeremiah	25	20	including the foreigners [ a ] living there ; all the kings of the land of Uz ; all the kings of the land of the Philistines—Ashkelon , Gaza , Ekron , and what ’ s left of Ashdod ;
CEB	Jeremiah	25	21	Edom , Moab , and the Ammonites ;
CEB	Jeremiah	25	22	all the kings of Tyre and Sidon , and the kings of the coastlands across the sea ;
CEB	Jeremiah	25	23	Dedan , Tema , Buz , and all those who cut the hair of their foreheads ; [ b ]
CEB	Jeremiah	25	24	all the kings of Arabia and the nomadic tribes , [ c ]
CEB	Jeremiah	25	26	all the kings of the north , those nearby and those faraway , one after another , all the empires on the earth will drink from this cup . [ e ] And after them the king of Sheshach [ f ] will drink from it .
CEB	Jeremiah	25	27	Then say to them : The Lord of heavenly forces , the God of Israel , proclaims : Drink this seething cup of wine and get drunk . Vomit and collapse and don ’ t get up again because of the sword that I ’ m thrusting into you .
CEB	Jeremiah	25	28	If they refuse to take the cup in your hand and drink from it , tell them : This is what the Lord of heavenly forces says : You must drink !
CEB	Jeremiah	25	29	Look ! I ’ m bringing disaster upon the city that bears my name ; how then will you escape unpunished ? You will not ! I ’ m summoning the sword against everyone on earth , declares the Lord of heavenly forces .
CEB	Jeremiah	25	30	Now prophesy all these things and say to them : The Lord roars on high ; from his holy place he thunders . He roars fiercely against his flock , like the shouting of those who tread on grapes , against everyone on earth .
CEB	Jeremiah	25	31	The uproar is heard far and wide , because the Lord is bringing a lawsuit against the nations . He ’ s entering into judgment with all people , sentencing the guilty to death , declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	25	32	The Lord of heavenly forces proclaims : Look ! Disaster travels from nation to nation . A terrible storm comes from the far ends of the earth .
CEB	Jeremiah	25	33	At that time , those struck down by the Lord will fill the earth . And no one will mourn for them or prepare their bodies for burial . They will become like refuse lying on the ground .
CEB	Jeremiah	25	34	Wail , you shepherds , cry out . Roll in the dust , you masters of the flock ! The day of your slaughter has arrived . You will fall and shatter like a fragile vase .
CEB	Jeremiah	25	35	The shepherds have no place to hide ; the masters of the flock can ’ t escape .
CEB	Jeremiah	25	36	Hear the cry of the shepherds and the sobbing of the masters of the flock , because the Lord is ravaging their pasture .
CEB	Jeremiah	25	37	There ’ s an eerie silence in the peaceful meadows , because of the Lord ’ s fierce anger .
CEB	Jeremiah	25	38	The lion is on the prowl , and the land is reduced to nothing , because of the fierce sword , [ g ] because of his fierce anger .

CEB	Jeremiah	26	26	Early in the rule of Judah ’ s King Jehoiakim , Josiah ’ s son , this word came from the Lord :
CEB	Jeremiah	26	2	The Lord proclaims : Stand in the temple courtyard and speak to all the people of the towns of Judah who have come to the temple to worship . Tell them everything I command you ; leave nothing out .
CEB	Jeremiah	26	3	Perhaps they will listen and each will turn from their evil ways . If they do , I will relent and not carry out the harm I have in mind for them because of the wrong they have done .
CEB	Jeremiah	26	4	So tell them , The Lord proclaims : If you don ’ t listen to me or follow the Instruction I have set before you—
CEB	Jeremiah	26	5	if you don ’ t listen to the words of the prophets that I have sent to you time and again , though you haven ’ t listened ,
CEB	Jeremiah	26	6	then I will make this temple a ruin like Shiloh , and this city I will make a curse before all nations on earth .
CEB	Jeremiah	26	7	The priests , the prophets , and all the people heard Jeremiah declare these words in the Lord ’ s temple .
CEB	Jeremiah	26	8	And when Jeremiah finished saying everything the Lord told him to say , the priests and the prophets and all the people seized him and said , “ You must die !
CEB	Jeremiah	26	9	Why do you prophesy in the Lord ’ s name that ‘ this temple will become a ruin like Shiloh , and this city will be destroyed and left without inhabitant ’ ? ” Then all the people joined ranks against Jeremiah in the Lord ’ s temple .
CEB	Jeremiah	26	10	When the officials of Judah heard these things , they went up from the royal palace to the Lord ’ s temple and took their places at the entrance of the New Gate of the Lord ’ s temple .
CEB	Jeremiah	26	11	The priests and the prophets said to the officials and all the people : “ This man deserves to die for prophesying against this city as you have all heard firsthand. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	26	12	Jeremiah said to all the officials and to all the people , “ The Lord sent me to prophesy to this temple and this city everything you have heard .
CEB	Jeremiah	26	13	So now transform your ways and actions . Obey the Lord your God , and the Lord may relent and not carry out the harm that he ’ s pronounced against you .
CEB	Jeremiah	26	14	But me ? I ’ m in your hands . Do whatever you would like to me .
CEB	Jeremiah	26	15	Only know for certain that if you sentence me to death , you and the people of this city will be guilty of killing an innocent man . The Lord has in fact sent me to speak everything I have said to you. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	26	16	Then the officials and all the people said to the priests and the prophets , “ This man doesn ’ t deserve to die , for he has spoken to us in the name of the Lord our God. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	26	17	A few of the community elders got up and addressed the whole crowd :
CEB	Jeremiah	26	18	“ Micah of Moresheth , who prophesied during the rule of Judah ’ s Hezekiah , said to all the people of Judah , ‘ The Lord of heavenly forces proclaims : Zion will be plowed down like a field , Jerusalem will become piles of rubble , and the temple mount will become an overgrown mound. ’
CEB	Jeremiah	26	19	“ Did King Hezekiah or anyone else in Judah execute him ? Didn ’ t he instead fear the Lord and plead for his mercy ? Then the Lord relented of the harm that he had pronounced against them . We are about to commit a huge mistake that will cost us our lives. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	26	20	There was another man who prophesied in the Lord ’ s name : Uriah , Shemaiah ’ s son from Kiriath-jearim . He prophesied the same things that Jeremiah did about this city and against this land .
CEB	Jeremiah	26	21	When King Jehoiakim and all his warriors and officials heard his words , the king sought to kill him . Uriah heard of this and fled in fear to Egypt .
CEB	Jeremiah	26	22	But King Jehoiakim dispatched Elnathan , Achbor ’ s son , and others to Egypt .
CEB	Jeremiah	26	23	They brought Uriah back from Egypt to the king who had him killed , and his body was thrown into the common burial ground .
CEB	Jeremiah	26	24	But Ahikam , Shaphan ’ s son , protected Jeremiah and wouldn ’ t let the people execute him .
CEB	Jeremiah	27	27	Early in the rule of Judah ’ s King Zedekiah , [ a ] Josiah ’ s son , this word came to Jeremiah from the Lord :
CEB	Jeremiah	27	2	This is what the Lord said to me : Make a yoke of straps and bars and wear it on your neck .
CEB	Jeremiah	27	3	Then send word [ b ] to the kings of Edom , Moab , Ammon , Tyre , and Sidon through their representatives who have come to Jerusalem to Judah ’ s King Zedekiah .
CEB	Jeremiah	27	4	Tell them to say to their masters : The Lord of heavenly forces , the God of Israel , proclaims : Say this to your masters :
CEB	Jeremiah	27	5	By my great power and outstretched arm , I have made the earth and the people and animals that are on it . I can give it to anyone I please .
CEB	Jeremiah	27	6	Now I hand over all these countries to my servant King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon . I even give him the wild animals as subjects .
CEB	Jeremiah	27	7	All nations will serve him , his son and grandson , until the time for his land arrives ; then many nations and great kings will conquer him .
CEB	Jeremiah	27	8	As for the nation or country that won ’ t serve Babylon ’ s King Nebuchadnezzar and won ’ t put its neck under his yoke , I will punish it with sword , famine , and disease until I have destroyed it by his hand , declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	27	9	As for you , don ’ t listen to your prophets , diviners , dreamers , [ c ] mediums , or your sorcerers who say to you , “ Don ’ t serve the king of Babylon. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	27	10	They are lying to you , and their lies will lead to banishment from your land . I will drive you out , and you will perish .
CEB	Jeremiah	27	11	But any nation that puts its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serves him , I will let stay in its land to till it and live on it , declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	27	12	I delivered the same message to Judah ’ s King Zedekiah : If you want to live , put your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him and his people .
CEB	Jeremiah	27	13	Why should you and your people die by sword , famine , and disease , as the Lord pronounced against any nation that won ’ t serve the king of Babylon ?
CEB	Jeremiah	27	14	Pay no attention to the words of the prophets who encourage you not to serve the king of Babylon , for they are lying to you .
CEB	Jeremiah	27	15	I haven ’ t sent these prophets , declares the Lord ; they are prophesying falsely in my name . If you listen to them , I will drive you out , and you will perish , both you and your prophets !
CEB	Jeremiah	27	16	Then I spoke to the priests and all this people : This is what the Lord says : Don ’ t listen to the words of the prophets who are prophesying to you , “ In a short while , the temple equipment will be brought back from Babylon. ” They are prophesying a lie to you .
CEB	Jeremiah	27	17	Don ’ t listen to them ; serve the king of Babylon and live . Otherwise , this city will be reduced to ruin .
CEB	Jeremiah	27	18	If they are really prophets and have the Lord ’ s word , let them intercede with the Lord of heavenly forces not to let the equipment left in the Lord ’ s temple and in the royal palace of Judah and Jerusalem be carted off to Babylon .
CEB	Jeremiah	27	19	This is what the Lord of heavenly forces proclaims about the pillars , the Sea , the stands , and the rest of the equipment left in this city ,
CEB	Jeremiah	27	20	which Babylon ’ s King Nebuchadnezzar didn ’ t plunder when he deported Jeconiah the son of Judah ’ s King Jehoiakim from Jerusalem to Babylon , along with all the officials of Judah and Jerusalem .
CEB	Jeremiah	27	21	Yes , this is what the Lord of heavenly forces , the God of Israel , proclaims about the equipment that is left in the Lord ’ s temple and in the royal palace in Judah , and in Jerusalem :
CEB	Jeremiah	27	22	They will be carted off to Babylon where they will remain until the day I come looking for them , declares the Lord ; then I will bring them back and restore them to this place .

CEB	Jeremiah	28	28	That same year , early in the rule of Judah ’ s King Zedekiah , in the fifth month of his fourth year , the prophet Hananiah , Azzur ’ s son from Gibeon , spoke to me in the Lord ’ s temple before the priests and all the people .
CEB	Jeremiah	28	2	He said : “ The Lord of heavenly forces , the God of Israel , proclaims : I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon .
CEB	Jeremiah	28	3	In two years I will restore to this place all of the temple equipment that Babylon ’ s King Nebuchadnezzar carted off to Babylon .
CEB	Jeremiah	28	4	I will also restore to this place Judah ’ s King Jeconiah , Jehoiakim ’ s son , along with all the exiles from Judah who were deported to Babylon , for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon , declares the Lord. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	28	5	Then the prophet Jeremiah responded to Hananiah in the presence of the priests and all the people who were standing in the Lord ’ s temple .
CEB	Jeremiah	28	6	The prophet Jeremiah said : “ Indeed . May the Lord do just as you have said ! May the Lord fulfill the words that you have prophesied and bring back from Babylon the equipment of the Lord ’ s temple and all the exiles to this place .
CEB	Jeremiah	28	7	However , listen closely to what I have to say to you and all the people :
CEB	Jeremiah	28	8	The prophets who came before you and me long ago prophesied war , disaster , and disease against many lands and great kingdoms .
CEB	Jeremiah	28	9	So the prophet who prophesies peace is recognized as one who is actually sent by the Lord only when that prophet ’ s message is fulfilled. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	28	10	Then the prophet Hananiah took hold of the yoke that was on the prophet Jeremiah ’ s neck and broke it .
CEB	Jeremiah	28	11	He said before all the people , “ This is what the Lord says : Just as this yoke has been broken , I will break the yoke of Babylon ’ s King Nebuchadnezzar from the neck of all the nations within two years. ” Then the prophet Jeremiah walked away .
CEB	Jeremiah	28	12	Sometime after Hananiah had broken the yoke that was on Jeremiah ’ s neck , the Lord told him :
CEB	Jeremiah	28	13	Go , say to Hananiah , The Lord proclaims : You have broken a wooden yoke , [ a ] but I [ b ] will replace it with an iron one .
CEB	Jeremiah	28	14	The Lord of heavenly forces , the God of Israel , proclaims : I will put iron yokes on the necks of all these nations , and they will serve Babylon ’ s King Nebuchadnezzar ; even the wild animals will be subject to him !
CEB	Jeremiah	28	15	Then the prophet Jeremiah said to the prophet Hananiah : “ Listen , Hananiah ! The Lord hasn ’ t sent you . All you are doing is persuading these people to believe a lie .
CEB	Jeremiah	28	16	Therefore , the Lord proclaims : I ’ m going to send you somewhere—right off the face of the earth ! Before the year ends , you will die since you have incited rebellion against the Lord. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	28	17	The prophet Hananiah died in the seventh month [ c ] of that year . Footnotes - Jeremiah 28:13 Or yokes - Jeremiah 28:13 Heb uncertain - Jeremiah 28:17 September–October , Tishrei
CEB	Jeremiah	29	29	The priest Zephaniah read this letter to the prophet Jeremiah .
CEB	Jeremiah	29	2	The letter was sent after King Jeconiah , the queen mother , the court officials , the government leaders of Judah and Jerusalem , and the craftsmen and smiths had left Jerusalem .
CEB	Jeremiah	29	3	It was delivered to Babylon by Elasah , Shaphan ’ s son , and Gemariah , Hilkiah ’ s son—two men dispatched to Babylon ’ s King Nebuchadnezzar by King Zedekiah .
CEB	Jeremiah	29	4	The Lord of heavenly forces , the God of Israel , proclaims to all the exiles I have carried off from Jerusalem to Babylon :
CEB	Jeremiah	29	5	Build houses and settle down ; cultivate gardens and eat what they produce .
CEB	Jeremiah	29	6	Get married and have children ; then help your sons find wives and your daughters find husbands in order that they too may have children . Increase in number there so that you don ’ t dwindle away .
CEB	Jeremiah	29	7	Promote the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile . Pray to the Lord for it , because your future depends on its welfare .
CEB	Jeremiah	29	8	The Lord of heavenly forces , the God of Israel , proclaims : Don ’ t let the prophets and diviners in your midst mislead you . Don ’ t pay attention to your dreams .
CEB	Jeremiah	29	9	They are prophesying lies to you in my name . I didn ’ t send them , declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	29	10	The Lord proclaims : When Babylon ’ s seventy years are up , I will come and fulfill my gracious promise to bring you back to this place .
CEB	Jeremiah	29	11	I know the plans I have in mind for you , declares the Lord ; they are plans for peace , not disaster , to give you a future filled with hope .
CEB	Jeremiah	29	12	When you call me and come and pray to me , I will listen to you .
CEB	Jeremiah	29	13	When you search for me , yes , search for me with all your heart , you will find me .
CEB	Jeremiah	29	14	I will be present for you , declares the Lord , and I will end your captivity . I will gather you from all the nations and places where I have scattered you , and I will bring you home after your long exile , [ a ] declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	29	15	Yet you say , The Lord has raised up prophets for us in Babylon :
CEB	Jeremiah	29	16	This is what the Lord proclaims concerning the king sitting on David ’ s throne and all the people who live in this city , that is , those among you who didn ’ t go into exile :
CEB	Jeremiah	29	17	The Lord of heavenly forces proclaims : I ’ m going to send the sword , famine , and disease against them . I will make them like rotten figs that are too spoiled to eat .
CEB	Jeremiah	29	18	I will pursue them with the sword , famine , and disease ; and I will make them an object of horror to all nations on earth and an object of cursing , scorn , shock , and disgrace among all the countries where I have scattered them ,
CEB	Jeremiah	29	19	because they wouldn ’ t listen to my words , declares the Lord , which I sent them time and again through my servants the prophets . They [ b ] wouldn ’ t listen , declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	29	20	But now , all you exiles I deported from Jerusalem to Babylon , listen to the Lord ’ s word .
CEB	Jeremiah	29	21	This is what the Lord of heavenly forces , the God of Israel , proclaims concerning Ahab , Kolaiah ’ s son , and Zedekiah , Maaseiah ’ s son , who are prophesying lies to you in my name : I will hand them over to Babylon ’ s King Nebuchadnezzar , and he will slay them before your very eyes .
CEB	Jeremiah	29	22	Because of them , all the Judean exiles in Babylon will use this curse : “ The Lord make you like Zedekiah and Ahab , who were burned alive by the king of Babylon. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	29	23	They committed a horrible scandal in Israel—adultery with their neighbors ’ wives and deceit spoken in my name , with which I had nothing to do . Yet I ’ m still aware of it and am witness to it , declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	29	24	Tell Shemaiah the Nehelamite ,
CEB	Jeremiah	29	25	This is what the Lord of heavenly forces , the God of Israel , proclaims : [ c ] You sent letters on your own accord to all the people in Jerusalem , to the priest Zephaniah , Maaseiah ’ s son , and to the rest of the priests .
CEB	Jeremiah	29	26	You said to Zephaniah : [ d ] The Lord has appointed you priest in charge of the Lord ’ s temple instead of Jehoiada . You are responsible for putting every madman who prophesies into stocks and neck irons .
CEB	Jeremiah	29	27	So why haven ’ t you threatened Jeremiah of Anathoth , who pretends to be a prophet among you ?
CEB	Jeremiah	29	28	He has sent a letter telling those of us in Babylon : “ You are going to be there a long time , so build houses and settle down , plant gardens and eat what they produce. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	29	30	Then the Lord ’ s word came to Jeremiah :
CEB	Jeremiah	29	31	Send word to all the exiles : The Lord proclaims concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite : Because Shemaiah prophesied to you when I didn ’ t send him , and because he convinced you to believe a lie ,
CEB	Jeremiah	29	32	I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite and his descendants , declares the Lord . Not one member of this people will be around to see the good that I have in store for my people , declares the Lord , for he incited rebellion against me .

CEB	Jeremiah	30	30	Jeremiah received the Lord ’ s word :
CEB	Jeremiah	30	2	The Lord , the God of Israel , proclaims : Write down in a scroll all the words I have spoken to you .
CEB	Jeremiah	30	3	The time is coming , declares the Lord , when I will bring back my people Israel and Judah from captivity , [ a ] says the Lord . I will bring them home to the land that I gave to their ancestors , and they will possess it .
CEB	Jeremiah	30	4	Here are the words that the Lord spoke concerning Israel and Judah :
CEB	Jeremiah	30	5	The Lord proclaims : I [ b ] hear screams of panic and terror ; no one is safe .
CEB	Jeremiah	30	6	Ask and see : Can men bear children ? Then why do I see every man bent over in pain , [ c ] as if he ’ s in labor ? Why have all turned pale ?
CEB	Jeremiah	30	7	That day is awful , beyond words . A time of unspeakable pain for my people Jacob . But they will be delivered from it .
CEB	Jeremiah	30	8	At that time , I will break the yoke off their [ d ] necks and remove their [ e ] shackles . Foreigners will no longer enslave them , declares the Lord of heavenly forces .
CEB	Jeremiah	30	9	They will serve the Lord their God and the king whom I will raise up for them from David ’ s family .
CEB	Jeremiah	30	10	So don ’ t be afraid , my servant Jacob , declares the Lord , Don ’ t lose hope , Israel . I will deliver you from faraway places and your children from the land of their exile . My people Jacob will again be safe and sound , with no one harassing them .
CEB	Jeremiah	30	11	I am with you and will rescue you , declares the Lord . I will put an end to all the nations where I have scattered you . But I won ’ t put an end to you . I won ’ t let you remain unpunished : I will discipline you as you deserve .
CEB	Jeremiah	30	12	This is what the Lord says : Your injury is incurable ; your illness is grave .
CEB	Jeremiah	30	13	No one comes to your aid ; no one attends to your wound ; your disease is incurable .
CEB	Jeremiah	30	14	All your lovers disregard you ; they write you off as a lost cause , because I have dealt harshly with you as an enemy would , because your guilt is great and your sins are many .
CEB	Jeremiah	30	15	Why cry out for relief from your pain ? Your wound is incurable . I have done these things to you , because your guilt is great and your sins are many .
CEB	Jeremiah	30	16	Yet all who ravage you will be ravaged ; all who oppress you will go into exile . Those who rob you will be robbed , and all who plunder you will be plundered .
CEB	Jeremiah	30	17	I will restore your health , and I will heal your wounds , declares the Lord , because you were labeled an outcast , “ Zion , the lost cause. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	30	18	The Lord proclaims : I will restore Jacob ’ s tents and have pity on their birthplace . Their city will be rebuilt on its ruins and the palace in its rightful place .
CEB	Jeremiah	30	19	There will be laughter and songs of thanks . I will add to their numbers so they don ’ t dwindle away . I will honor them so they aren ’ t humiliated .
CEB	Jeremiah	30	20	Their children will thrive as they did long ago , and their community will be established before me . I will punish their oppressors .
CEB	Jeremiah	30	21	They will have their own leader ; their ruler will come from among them . I will let him approach me , and he will draw near . Who would dare approach me unless I let them come ? declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	30	22	You will be my people , and I will be your God .
CEB	Jeremiah	30	23	Look ! The Lord ’ s anger breaks out like a violent storm , a fierce wind that strikes the heads of the wicked .
CEB	Jeremiah	30	24	The Lord ’ s fierce anger won ’ t turn back until God ’ s [ f ] purposes are entirely accomplished . In the days to come , you will understand what this means .

CEB	Jeremiah	31	31	The time is coming , declares the Lord , when I will make a new covenant with the people of Israel and Judah .
CEB	Jeremiah	31	2	The Lord proclaims : The people who survived the sword found grace in the wilderness . As Israel searched for a place of rest ,
CEB	Jeremiah	31	3	the Lord appeared to them [ a ] from a distance : [ b ] I have loved you with a love that lasts forever . And so with unfailing love , I have drawn you to myself . [ c ]
CEB	Jeremiah	31	4	Again , I will build you up , and you will be rebuilt , virgin Israel . Again , you will play your tambourines and dance with joy .
CEB	Jeremiah	31	5	Again , you will plant vineyards on the hills of Samaria ; farmers will plant and then enjoy the harvests .
CEB	Jeremiah	31	6	The time will come when the watchmen shout from the highlands of Ephraim : “ Get ready ! We ’ re going up to Zion to the Lord our God ! ”
CEB	Jeremiah	31	7	The Lord proclaims : Sing joyfully for the people of Jacob ; shout for the leading nation . Raise your voices with praise and call out : “ The Lord has saved his people , [ d ] the remaining few in Israel ! ”
CEB	Jeremiah	31	8	I ’ m going to bring them back from the north ; I will gather them from the ends of the earth . Among them will be the blind and the disabled , expectant mothers and those in labor ; a great throng will return here .
CEB	Jeremiah	31	9	With tears of joy they will come ; while they pray , I will bring them back . I will lead them by quiet streams and on smooth paths so they don ’ t stumble . I will be Israel ’ s father , Ephraim will be my oldest child .
CEB	Jeremiah	31	10	Listen to the Lord ’ s word , you nations , and announce it to the distant islands : The one who scattered Israel will gather them and keep them safe , as a shepherd his flock .
CEB	Jeremiah	31	11	The Lord will rescue the people of Jacob and deliver them from the power of those stronger than they are .
CEB	Jeremiah	31	12	They will come shouting for joy on the hills of Zion , jubilant over the Lord ’ s gifts : grain , wine , oil , flocks , and herds . Their lives will be like a lush garden ; they will grieve no more .
CEB	Jeremiah	31	13	Then the young women will dance for joy ; the young and old men will join in . I will turn their mourning into laughter and their sadness into joy ; I will comfort them .
CEB	Jeremiah	31	14	I will lavish the priests with abundance and shower my people with my gifts , declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	31	15	The Lord proclaims : A voice is heard in Ramah , weeping and wailing . It ’ s Rachel crying for her children ; she refuses to be consoled , because her children are no more .
CEB	Jeremiah	31	16	The Lord proclaims : Keep your voice from crying and your eyes from weeping , because your endurance will be rewarded , declares the Lord . They will return from the land of their enemy !
CEB	Jeremiah	31	17	There ’ s hope for your future , declares the Lord . Your children will return home !
CEB	Jeremiah	31	18	I hear , yes , I hear Ephraim lamenting : “ You disciplined me , and I learned my lesson , even though I was as stubborn as a mule . Bring me back , let me return , because you are the Lord my God .
CEB	Jeremiah	31	19	After I turned away from you , I regretted it ; I realized what I had done , and I have hit myself [ e ] — I was humiliated and disgraced , and I have carried this disgrace since I was young. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	31	20	Isn ’ t Ephraim my much-loved child ? Don ’ t I utterly adore him ? Even when I scold him , I still hold him dear . I yearn for him and love him deeply , declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	31	21	Set up markers , put up signs ; think about the road you have traveled , the path you have taken . Return , virgin Israel ; return to these towns of yours .
CEB	Jeremiah	31	22	How long will you hem and haw , my rebellious daughter ? The Lord has created something new on earth : Virgin Israel will once again embrace her God ! [ f ]
CEB	Jeremiah	31	23	The Lord of heavenly forces , the God of Israel , proclaims : When I bring my people [ g ] back from captivity , they will once again utter these words in the land and towns of Judah : The Lord bless you , righteous dwelling place , holy mountain .
CEB	Jeremiah	31	24	Those who live in Judah and its towns will dwell together with farmers and shepherds .
CEB	Jeremiah	31	25	I will strengthen the weary and renew those who are weak .
CEB	Jeremiah	31	26	Then I woke up and looked around . What a pleasant sleep I had !
CEB	Jeremiah	31	27	The time is coming , declares the Lord , when I will plant seeds in Israel and Judah , and both people and animals will spring up .
CEB	Jeremiah	31	28	Just as I watched over them to dig up and pull down , to overthrow , destroy , and bring harm , so I will watch over them to build and plant , declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	31	29	In those days , people will no longer say : Sour grapes eaten by parents leave a bitter taste in the mouths of their children .
CEB	Jeremiah	31	30	Because everyone will die for their own sins : whoever eats sour grapes will have a bitter taste in their own mouths .
CEB	Jeremiah	31	32	It won ’ t be like the covenant I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt . They broke that covenant with me even though I was their husband , declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	31	33	No , this is the covenant that I will make with the people of Israel after that time , declares the Lord . I will put my Instructions within them and engrave them on their hearts . I will be their God , and they will be my people .
CEB	Jeremiah	31	34	They will no longer need to teach each other to say , “ Know the Lord ! ” because they will all know me , from the least of them to the greatest , declares the Lord ; for I will forgive their wrongdoing and never again remember their sins .
CEB	Jeremiah	31	35	The Lord proclaims : The one who established the sun to light up the day and ordered [ h ] the moon and stars to light up the night , who stirs up the sea into crashing waves , whose name is the Lord of heavenly forces :
CEB	Jeremiah	31	36	If the created order should vanish from my sight , declares the Lord , only then would Israel ’ s descendants ever stop being a nation before me .
CEB	Jeremiah	31	37	The Lord proclaims : If the heavens above could be measured and the foundation of the earth below could be fathomed , only then would I reject Israel ’ s descendants for what they have done , declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	31	38	The time is coming , declares the Lord , when the city will be rebuilt for the Lord from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate .
CEB	Jeremiah	31	39	Its boundaries will extend to the Gareb Hill and around to Goah .
CEB	Jeremiah	31	40	The entire valley defiled by corpses and ashes , and all the fields as far as the Kidron Valley and the Horse Gate on the east , all this will be set apart for the Lord . And the city will never again be dug up or overthrown .

CEB	Jeremiah	32	32	because of all the evil done by the people of Israel and Judah to make me angry—they , their kings and officials , their priests and prophets , the men of Judah , and those who live in Jerusalem .
CEB	Jeremiah	32	2	At that time , the army of the Babylonian king had surrounded Jerusalem , and the prophet Jeremiah was confined to the prison quarters in the palace of Judah ’ s king .
CEB	Jeremiah	32	3	Judah ’ s King Zedekiah had Jeremiah sent there after questioning him : “ Why do you prophesy , ‘ This is what the Lord says : I ’ m handing this city over to the king of Babylon , and he will occupy it ;
CEB	Jeremiah	32	4	and Judah ’ s King Zedekiah will be captured and handed over to the king of Babylon ; he will speak to the king of Babylon personally and see him with his very own eyes .
CEB	Jeremiah	32	5	And Zedekiah will be carried off to Babylon to live out his days until I punish him , declares the Lord . If you make war against the Babylonians , you will fail. ’ ”
CEB	Jeremiah	32	6	Jeremiah said , The Lord ’ s word came to me :
CEB	Jeremiah	32	7	Your cousin Hanamel , Shallum ’ s son , is on his way to see you ; and when he arrives , he will tell you : “ Buy my field in Anathoth , for by law you are next in line to purchase it. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	32	8	And just as the Lord had said , my cousin Hanamel showed up at the prison quarters and told me , “ Buy my field in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin , for you are next in line and have a family obligation to purchase it. ” Then I was sure this was the Lord ’ s doing .
CEB	Jeremiah	32	9	So I bought the field in Anathoth from my cousin Hanamel , and weighed out for him seventeen shekels of silver .
CEB	Jeremiah	32	10	I signed the deed , sealed it , had it witnessed , and weighed out the silver on the scales .
CEB	Jeremiah	32	11	Then I took the deed of purchase—the sealed copy , with its terms and conditions , and the unsealed copy—
CEB	Jeremiah	32	12	and gave it to Baruch , Neriah ’ s son and Mahseiah ’ s grandson , before my cousin Hanamel and the witnesses named in the deed , as well as before all the Judeans who were present in the prison quarters .
CEB	Jeremiah	32	13	I charged Baruch before all of them :
CEB	Jeremiah	32	14	“ The Lord of heavenly forces , the God of Israel , proclaims : Take these documents—this sealed deed of purchase along with the unsealed one—and put them into a clay container so they will last a long time .
CEB	Jeremiah	32	15	The Lord of heavenly forces , the God of Israel , proclaims : Houses , fields , and vineyards will again be bought in this land. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	32	16	After I had given the documents to Baruch , Neriah ’ s son , I prayed to the Lord :
CEB	Jeremiah	32	17	Lord God , you created heaven and earth by your great power and outstretched arm ; nothing is too hard for you !
CEB	Jeremiah	32	18	You act with mercy toward thousands upon thousands , but you also bring the consequences of the fathers ’ sins on their children after them . Great and mighty God , whose name is the Lord of heavenly forces ,
CEB	Jeremiah	32	19	marvelous are your purposes , and mighty are your deeds . You are aware of all the ways of humanity , and you reward us for how we live and what we do even now .
CEB	Jeremiah	32	20	You have performed signs and wonders in the land of Egypt as you do to this very day in Israel and everywhere else . That ’ s why you are so renowned .
CEB	Jeremiah	32	21	With a strong hand , an outstretched arm , and with awesome power , yes , with signs and wonders , you brought your people Israel out of the land of Egypt .
CEB	Jeremiah	32	22	You gave them this land that you promised to their ancestors , a land full of milk and honey .
CEB	Jeremiah	32	23	They entered and took possession of it , but they didn ’ t obey you or follow your Instruction . In fact , they didn ’ t do anything you commanded them . So you brought upon them this disaster .
CEB	Jeremiah	32	24	Now the siege ramps are in place to take the city . And the Babylonians are about to capture it by war , famine , and disease . What you have pronounced is now happening , as you can see .
CEB	Jeremiah	32	25	So why tell me , Lord God , Buy the field for money and make sure there are witnesses , when the city is under Babylonian control ?
CEB	Jeremiah	32	26	Then the Lord ’ s word came to Jeremiah :
CEB	Jeremiah	32	27	I am the Lord , the God of all living things ! Is anything too hard for me ?
CEB	Jeremiah	32	28	Therefore , the Lord proclaims : I ’ m handing this city over to the Babylonians and King Nebuchadnezzar , who will capture it .
CEB	Jeremiah	32	29	They will enter the city , set it on fire , and burn it down—including the houses on whose roofs offerings have been made to Baal and drink offerings to other gods , which made me especially angry .
CEB	Jeremiah	32	30	The people of Israel and Judah have done nothing but evil in my eyes since their youth ; the people of Israel and Judah have done nothing but anger me by the work of their hands , declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	32	31	This city has enraged me from the day it was built to this very day , and so it must be removed from my sight—
CEB	Jeremiah	32	33	They turned their backs to me and not their faces ; and though I taught them over and over , they wouldn ’ t accept my correction .
CEB	Jeremiah	32	34	They set up their disgusting idols in the temple that bears my name and violated it ;
CEB	Jeremiah	32	35	and they built shrines to Baal in the Ben-hinnon Valley , where they sacrifice their sons and daughters to Molech , though I never commanded them—nor did it even cross my mind—that they should do such detestable things , leading Judah to sin .
CEB	Jeremiah	32	36	You have been saying , “ This city will be handed over to the king of Babylon through sword , famine , and disease. ” But this is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says :
CEB	Jeremiah	32	37	I will gather them from all the countries where I have scattered them in my fierce anger and rage . I will bring them back to this place to live securely .
CEB	Jeremiah	32	38	They will be my people , and I will be their God .
CEB	Jeremiah	32	39	I will give them one heart and one mind so that they may worship me all the days of their lives , for their own good and for the good of their children after them .
CEB	Jeremiah	32	40	I will make an everlasting covenant with them , never to stop treating them graciously . I will put into their hearts a sense of awe for me so that they won ’ t turn away from me .
CEB	Jeremiah	32	41	I will rejoice in treating them graciously , and I will plant them in this land faithfully and with all my heart and being .
CEB	Jeremiah	32	42	The Lord proclaims : Just as I brought this great disaster on this people , so I will bring on them all the good I promised them .
CEB	Jeremiah	32	43	Fields will be bought in this land , a land you have said is bleak and uninhabited and in the possession of the Babylonians .
CEB	Jeremiah	32	44	Fields will be bought , and deeds will be signed , sealed , and witnessed in the land of Benjamin and in the outlying areas of Jerusalem , in the towns of Judah and in the highlands , in the towns of the western foothills and the arid southern plain ; for I will bring them back from their captivity , declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	33	33	While he was still confined to the prison quarters , the Lord ’ s word came to Jeremiah a second time :
CEB	Jeremiah	33	2	The Lord proclaims , the Lord who made the earth , [ a ] who formed and established it , whose name is the Lord :
CEB	Jeremiah	33	3	Call to me and I will answer and reveal to you wondrous secrets that you haven ’ t known .
CEB	Jeremiah	33	4	This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , proclaims about the houses of this city and the palaces of the kings of Judah that were torn down to defend against the siege ramps and weapons
CEB	Jeremiah	33	5	of the invading Babylonians . [ b ] They will be filled with the corpses of those slain in my fierce anger . I hid my face from the people of this city because of all their evil deeds ,
CEB	Jeremiah	33	6	but now I will heal and mend them . I will make them whole and bless them [ c ] with an abundance of peace and security .
CEB	Jeremiah	33	7	I will bring back the captives of Judah and Israel , and I will rebuild them as they were at first .
CEB	Jeremiah	33	8	I will cleanse them of all the wrongdoing they committed against me , and I will forgive them for all of their guilt and rebellion .
CEB	Jeremiah	33	9	Then this city [ d ] will bring me great joy , praise , and renown before all nations on earth , when they hear of all the good I provide for them . They will be in total awe at all the good and prosperity I provide for them .
CEB	Jeremiah	33	10	The Lord proclaims : You have said about this place , “ It is a wasteland , without humans or animals. ” Yet in the ravaged and uninhabited towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem ,
CEB	Jeremiah	33	11	the sounds of joy and laughter and the voices of the bride and the bridegroom will again be heard . So will the voices of those who say , as thank offerings are brought to the Lord ’ s temple , “ Give thanks to the Lord of heavenly forces , for the Lord is good and his kindness lasts forever. ” I will bring back the captives of this land as they were before , says the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	33	12	The Lord of heavenly forces proclaims : This wasteland , without humans or animals—and all its towns—will again become pastures for shepherds to care for their flocks .
CEB	Jeremiah	33	13	Shepherds will again count their flocks in the towns of the highlands , the western foothills and the arid southern plain , in the land of Benjamin , as well as in the outlying areas of Jerusalem and the towns of Judah , says the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	33	14	The time is coming , declares the Lord , when I will fulfill my gracious promise with the people of Israel and Judah .
CEB	Jeremiah	33	15	In those days and at that time , I will raise up a righteous branch from David ’ s line , who will do what is just and right in the land .
CEB	Jeremiah	33	16	In those days , Judah will be saved and Jerusalem will live in safety . And this is what he will be called : The Lord Is Our Righteousness .
CEB	Jeremiah	33	17	The Lord proclaims : David will always have one of his descendants sit on the throne of the house of Israel .
CEB	Jeremiah	33	18	And the levitical priests will always have someone in my presence to make entirely burned offerings and grain offerings , and to present sacrifices .
CEB	Jeremiah	33	19	Then the Lord ’ s word came to Jeremiah :
CEB	Jeremiah	33	20	This is what the Lord says : If one could break my covenant with the day and my covenant with the night so that they wouldn ’ t come at their proper time ,
CEB	Jeremiah	33	21	only then could my covenant with my servant David and my covenant with the levitical priests who minister before me be broken ; only then would David no longer have a descendant to rule on his throne .
CEB	Jeremiah	33	22	And just as the stars in the sky can ’ t be numbered and the sand on the shore can ’ t be counted , so I will increase the descendants of my servant David and the Levites who minister before me .
CEB	Jeremiah	33	23	Then the Lord ’ s word came to Jeremiah :
CEB	Jeremiah	33	24	Aren ’ t you aware of what people are saying : “ The Lord has rejected the two families that he had chosen ” ? They are insulting my people as if they no longer belong to me . [ e ]
CEB	Jeremiah	33	25	The Lord proclaims : I would no sooner break my covenant with day and night or the laws of heaven and earth
CEB	Jeremiah	33	26	than I would reject the descendants of Jacob and my servant David and his descendants as rulers for the children of Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob . I will restore the captives and have compassion on them .

CEB	Jeremiah	34	34	Jeremiah received the Lord ’ s word when Babylon ’ s King Nebuchadnezzar and his army , and all the countries and people he ruled , were attacking Jerusalem and all its towns .
CEB	Jeremiah	34	2	The Lord , the God of Israel , proclaims , Go and speak to Judah ’ s King Zedekiah and say to him : The Lord proclaims , I ’ m handing this city over to the king of Babylon , and he will burn it down .
CEB	Jeremiah	34	3	You won ’ t escape but will be captured and handed over to him . You will see the king of Babylon with your very own eyes and speak to him personally , and you will be taken to Babylon .
CEB	Jeremiah	34	4	Even so , hear the Lord ’ s word , King Zedekiah of Judah : This is what the Lord proclaims about you : You won ’ t die in battle ;
CEB	Jeremiah	34	5	you will die a peaceful death . As burial incense was burned to honor your ancestors , the kings who came before you , so it will be burned to honor you as people mourn , “ Oh , master ! ” I myself promise this , declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	34	6	The prophet Jeremiah delivered this message to Judah ’ s King Zedekiah in Jerusalem
CEB	Jeremiah	34	7	when the army of the king of Babylon was attacking Jerusalem and all the remaining Judean towns , Lachish and Azekah—the only fortified towns still standing in Judah .
CEB	Jeremiah	34	8	Jeremiah received the Lord ’ s word after King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people in Jerusalem to proclaim liberty for their slaves :
CEB	Jeremiah	34	9	everyone was to free their male and female Hebrew slaves and no longer hold a Judean brother or sister in bondage .
CEB	Jeremiah	34	10	So all the officials and people who entered into this covenant agreed to free their male and female slaves and no longer hold them in bondage ; they obeyed the king ’ s command [ a ] and let them go .
CEB	Jeremiah	34	11	But afterward they broke their promise , took back the men and women they had freed , and enslaved them again .
CEB	Jeremiah	34	12	Then the Lord ’ s word came to Jeremiah :
CEB	Jeremiah	34	13	The Lord , the God of Israel , proclaims : I made a covenant with your ancestors when I brought them out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of slavery .
CEB	Jeremiah	34	14	I said that every seventh year each of you must free any Hebrews who have been sold to you . After they have served you for six years , you must set them free . But your ancestors didn ’ t obey or pay any attention to me .
CEB	Jeremiah	34	15	Recently you turned about and did what was right in my sight ; each of you proclaimed liberty for the other and made a covenant before me in the temple that bears my name .
CEB	Jeremiah	34	16	But then you went back on your word and made my name impure ; each of you reclaimed the men and women you had set free and forced them to be your slaves again .
CEB	Jeremiah	34	17	Therefore , the Lord proclaims : Since you have defied me by not setting your fellow citizens free , I ’ m setting you free , declares the Lord , free to die by the sword , disease , and famine ! And I will make you an object of horror for all nations on earth .
CEB	Jeremiah	34	18	I will make those who disregarded my covenant , violating its terms that they agreed to in my presence , like the calf they cut in two and then walked between the halves of its carcass .
CEB	Jeremiah	34	19	The officials of Judah and Jerusalem , the eunuchs and priests , and all the people who passed through the pieces of the calf
CEB	Jeremiah	34	20	I will hand over to their enemies who seek to kill them . And their corpses will become food for birds and wild animals .
CEB	Jeremiah	34	21	I will hand over Judah ’ s King Zedekiah and his officials to their enemies who seek to kill them : namely , the army of Babylon ’ s king , which has just withdrawn from you .
CEB	Jeremiah	34	22	I ’ m about to issue orders , declares the Lord , that the army of Babylon return to this city . They will wage war against it , capture it , and burn it down along with other Judean cities . I will make Judah a wasteland , without inhabitants .

CEB	Jeremiah	35	35	Jeremiah received the Lord ’ s word during the rule of Judah ’ s King Jehoiakim , Josiah ’ s son :
CEB	Jeremiah	35	2	Go to the Rechabite family and invite them to come to one of the rooms of the Lord ’ s temple . When they arrive , offer them some wine to drink .
CEB	Jeremiah	35	3	So I took Jaazaniah , Jeremiah ’ s son and Habazziniah ’ s grandson , and his brothers and all his sons , and the whole Rechabite family .
CEB	Jeremiah	35	4	I brought them to the room in the Lord ’ s temple assigned to the sons of Hanan , Igdaliah ’ s son , the man of God . The room was next to the one used by the chief officers and right above the room of Maaseiah , Shallum ’ s son , the temple doorkeeper . [ a ]
CEB	Jeremiah	35	5	Then I set bowls full of wine before the Rechabites , along with several cups , and I said to them , “ Have some. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	35	6	But they refused : “ We don ’ t drink wine because our ancestor Jonadab , Rechab ’ s son , commanded us , ‘ You and your children are never to drink wine ;
CEB	Jeremiah	35	7	nor are you to build or own houses or plant gardens and vineyards ; rather , you are always to dwell in tents so you may live a long time in the fertile land you pass through. ’
CEB	Jeremiah	35	8	We have obeyed everything our ancestor Jonadab , Rechab ’ s son , commanded us . No one in our household , including our wives and children , has ever had wine .
CEB	Jeremiah	35	9	And we haven ’ t built houses to live in or had vineyards , fields , or crops .
CEB	Jeremiah	35	10	We have lived in tents and done everything our ancestor Jonadab commanded us .
CEB	Jeremiah	35	11	But when Babylon ’ s King Nebuchadnezzar invaded the country , we said , ‘ We better go to Jerusalem to escape the Babylonian and Aramean armies. ’ That ’ s why we ’ re here in Jerusalem. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	35	12	Then the Lord ’ s word came to Jeremiah :
CEB	Jeremiah	35	13	The Lord of heavenly forces , the God of Israel , proclaims : Go and tell the people of Judah and those who live in Jerusalem : Can ’ t you learn a lesson about what it means to obey me ? declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	35	14	Jonadab , Rechab ’ s son , commanded his descendants not to drink wine , and to this very day they have not drunk wine , obeying their ancestor ’ s instruction . But I have spoken to you again and again , and you haven ’ t listened to me .
CEB	Jeremiah	35	15	I have sent you all my servants , the prophets , time and again , saying , “ Each of you , turn from your evil ways and reform your actions ; don ’ t worship or serve other gods . Then you may live in the fertile land I gave to you and your ancestors. ” But you haven ’ t paid attention or listened to me .
CEB	Jeremiah	35	16	The descendants of Jonadab , Rechab ’ s son , have thoroughly obeyed their ancestor , but this people have not listened to me .
CEB	Jeremiah	35	17	Therefore , this is what the Lord of heavenly forces , the God of Israel , says : I ’ m going to bring upon the people of Judah and all those who live in Jerusalem the disaster I pronounced against them , because they wouldn ’ t listen to me or respond when I called .
CEB	Jeremiah	35	18	Then Jeremiah said to the Rechabite family : The Lord of heavenly forces , the God of Israel , proclaims : Because you have obeyed all Jonadab ’ s instructions and you have done everything he commanded you ,
CEB	Jeremiah	35	19	the Lord of heavenly forces , the God of Israel proclaims : Jonadab , Rechab ’ s son , will always have a descendant that stands before me . Footnotes - Jeremiah 35:4 Or keeper of the threshold
CEB	Jeremiah	36	36	In the fourth year of Judah ’ s King Jehoiakim , Josiah ’ s son , this word came to Jeremiah from the Lord :
CEB	Jeremiah	36	2	Take a scroll and write in it all the words I have spoken to you concerning Israel , Judah , and all the nations from the time of Josiah until today .
CEB	Jeremiah	36	3	Perhaps when the people of Judah hear about every disaster I intend to bring upon them , they will turn from their evil ways , and I will forgive their wrongdoing and sins .
CEB	Jeremiah	36	4	So Jeremiah sent for Baruch , Neriah ’ s son . As Jeremiah dictated all the words that the Lord had spoken to him , Baruch wrote them in the scroll .
CEB	Jeremiah	36	5	Then Jeremiah told Baruch , “ I ’ m confined here and can ’ t go to the Lord ’ s temple .
CEB	Jeremiah	36	6	So you go to the temple on the next day of fasting , and read the Lord ’ s words from the scroll that I have dictated to you . Read them so that all the people in the temple can hear them , as well as all the Judeans who have come from their towns .
CEB	Jeremiah	36	7	If they turn from their evil ways , perhaps the Lord will hear their prayers . The Lord has threatened them with fierce anger. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	36	8	Baruch , Neriah ’ s son , did everything the prophet Jeremiah instructed him : he read all the Lord ’ s words from the scroll in the temple .
CEB	Jeremiah	36	9	In the ninth month of the fifth year of Judah ’ s King Jehoiakim , Josiah ’ s son , all the people in Jerusalem and all those who had come from Judean towns observed a fast for the Lord in Jerusalem .
CEB	Jeremiah	36	10	Then Baruch read Jeremiah ’ s words from the scroll to all the people in the Lord ’ s temple ; he read them in the chamber of Gemariah , Shaphan the scribe ’ s son , in the upper courtyard near the entrance of the New Gate of the Lord ’ s temple .
CEB	Jeremiah	36	11	When Micaiah , Gemariah ’ s son and Shaphan ’ s grandson , heard all the Lord ’ s words from the scroll ,
CEB	Jeremiah	36	12	he went down to the scribes ’ chamber in the royal palace . There he found all the officials meeting together : Elishama the scribe ; Delaiah , Shemaiah ’ s son ; Elnathan , Achbor ’ s son ; Gemariah , Shaphan ’ s son ; Zedekiah , Hananiah ’ s son , and all the other officials .
CEB	Jeremiah	36	13	Micaiah told them all the words he heard Baruch read from the scroll before the people .
CEB	Jeremiah	36	14	Then all the officials sent Jehudi , Nethaniah ’ s son and Shelemiah ’ s grandson , and Cushi ’ s great-grandson , to Baruch : “ Take the scroll you read to the people and come with me. ” So Baruch , Neriah ’ s son , took the scroll and went to the officials .
CEB	Jeremiah	36	15	They said to him , “ Sit down and read it to us. ” So Baruch read it to them .
CEB	Jeremiah	36	16	When they heard all its words , they were alarmed and said to Baruch : “ We must at once report all this to the king ! ”
CEB	Jeremiah	36	17	Then they asked Baruch , “ Tell us , how did you write all these words ? Did they come from Jeremiah ? ”
CEB	Jeremiah	36	18	Baruch replied , “ He dictated all the words to me , and I wrote them with ink in the scroll. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	36	19	The officials then said to Baruch , “ You and Jeremiah had better go and hide . And don ’ t let anyone know where you are. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	36	20	After leaving the scroll in the room of Elishama the scribe , they went to the king ’ s court and told him everything .
CEB	Jeremiah	36	21	The king sent Jehudi to take the scroll , and he retrieved it from the room of Elishama the scribe . Then Jehudi read it to the king and all his royal officials who were standing next to the king .
CEB	Jeremiah	36	22	Now it was the ninth month , [ a ] and the king was staying in the winterized part of the palace with the firepot burning near him .
CEB	Jeremiah	36	23	And whenever Jehudi read three or four columns of the scroll , the king would cut them off with a scribe ’ s knife and throw them into the firepot until the whole scroll was burned up .
CEB	Jeremiah	36	24	Neither the king nor any of his attendants who heard all these words were alarmed or tore their clothes .
CEB	Jeremiah	36	25	Elnathan , Delaiah , and Gemariah begged the king not to burn the scroll , but he wouldn ’ t listen to them .
CEB	Jeremiah	36	26	The king commanded Jerahmeel , the king ’ s son , along with Seraiah , Azriel ’ s son , and Shelemiah , Abdeel ’ s son , to arrest the scribe Baruch and the prophet Jeremiah . But the Lord hid them .
CEB	Jeremiah	36	27	The Lord ’ s word came to Jeremiah after the king had burned the scroll containing the words written by Baruch at Jeremiah ’ s dictation :
CEB	Jeremiah	36	28	Get another scroll and write in it all the words that were in the first scroll that Judah ’ s King Jehoiakim burned .
CEB	Jeremiah	36	29	Then say to Judah ’ s King Jehoiakim : The Lord proclaims : You burned that scroll because it declared that the king of Babylon will come and destroy this land and eliminate every sign of life from it .
CEB	Jeremiah	36	30	Therefore , this is what the Lord proclaims about Judah ’ s King Jehoiakim : He won ’ t have any heirs to occupy the throne of David , and his dead body will be cast out and exposed to the heat of the day and the frost of the night .
CEB	Jeremiah	36	31	I will punish him and his family and his attendants for their wrongdoing . I will bring upon them , as well as the residents of Jerusalem and the people of Judah , every disaster I pronounced against them . But they wouldn ’ t listen .
CEB	Jeremiah	36	32	So Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to the scribe Baruch , Neriah ’ s son , who wrote at Jeremiah ’ s dictation all the words in the scroll burned in the fire by Judah ’ s King Jehoiakim . Many similar words were added to them . Footnotes - Jeremiah 36:22 November–December , Kislev
CEB	Jeremiah	37	37	Babylon ’ s King Nebuchadnezzar appointed Zedekiah , Josiah ’ s son , to succeed Coniah , Jehoiakim ’ s son , as king of Judah .
CEB	Jeremiah	37	2	Neither Zedekiah , his attendants , nor the people of the land listened to the Lord ’ s words spoken by the prophet Jeremiah .
CEB	Jeremiah	37	3	Nevertheless , King Zedekiah sent Jehucal , Shelemiah ’ s son , and the priest Zephaniah , Maaseiah ’ s son , to Jeremiah the prophet with this plea : “ Please pray for us to the Lord our God. ” (

CEB	Jeremiah	37	6	Then the Lord ’ s word came to Jeremiah the prophet :
CEB	Jeremiah	37	7	The Lord , the God of Israel , proclaims : Tell the king of Judah who sent his emissaries to seek advice from me : “ Pharaoh ’ s army that came to assist you is heading back to Egypt .
CEB	Jeremiah	37	8	The Babylonians will return and attack this city . They will capture it and burn it down. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	37	9	The Lord proclaims : Don ’ t let yourself be deceived into thinking that the Babylonians will withdraw for good . [ b ] They won ’ t !
CEB	Jeremiah	37	10	Even if you were to crush the entire Babylonian army that ’ s attacking you and only the wounded in their tents remained , they would rise up and burn this city down .
CEB	Jeremiah	37	11	Now when the Babylonian army had withdrawn from Jerusalem due to Pharaoh ’ s advance ,
CEB	Jeremiah	37	12	Jeremiah set out for the land of Benjamin to secure his share of the family property . [ c ]
CEB	Jeremiah	37	13	He got as far as the Benjamin Gate in Jerusalem when the guard there named Irijah , Shelemiah ’ s son and Hananiah ’ s grandson , arrested the prophet Jeremiah , saying , “ You are deserting to the Babylonians. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	37	14	“ That ’ s a lie , ” Jeremiah replied . “ I ’ m not deserting to the Babylonians. ” But Irijah wouldn ’ t listen to him . He arrested Jeremiah and brought him to the officials ,
CEB	Jeremiah	37	15	who were furious with him . They beat him and threw him into the house of the scribe Jonathan , which had been turned into a prison .
CEB	Jeremiah	37	16	So Jeremiah was put in a cistern , which was like a dungeon , where he remained a long time .
CEB	Jeremiah	37	17	Later King Zedekiah sent for him and questioned Jeremiah secretly in the palace : “ Is there a word from the Lord ? ” “ There is , ” Jeremiah replied . “ You are going to be handed over to the king of Babylon. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	37	18	Then Jeremiah asked King Zedekiah , “ What have I done wrong to you or your attendants or this people that you should throw me into prison ?
CEB	Jeremiah	37	19	Where are your prophets now who prophesied that the king of Babylon wouldn ’ t attack you and this land ?
CEB	Jeremiah	37	20	Now , my master and king , I beg you , don ’ t send me back to the house of Jonathan the scribe , or I ’ ll die there. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	37	21	So King Zedekiah gave orders that Jeremiah be held in the prison quarters and that he receive a loaf of bread daily from the street vendors [ d ] —until all the bread in the city was gone . So Jeremiah remained in the prison quarters .

CEB	Jeremiah	38	38	Shephatiah , Mattan ’ s son ; Gedaliah , Pashhur ’ s son ; Jucal , Shelemiah ’ s son ; and Pashhur , Malchiah ’ s son heard what Jeremiah had been telling the people :
CEB	Jeremiah	38	2	The Lord proclaims : Whoever stays in this city will die by the sword , famine , and disease . But whoever surrenders to the Babylonians will live ; yes , their lives will be spared .
CEB	Jeremiah	38	3	The Lord proclaims : This city will certainly be handed over to the army of Babylon ’ s king , who will capture it .
CEB	Jeremiah	38	4	Then the officials said to the king : “ This man must be put to death ! By saying such things , he is discouraging the few remaining troops left in the city , as well as all the people . This man doesn ’ t seek their welfare but their ruin ! ”
CEB	Jeremiah	38	5	“ He ’ s in your hands , ” King Zedekiah said , “ for the king can do nothing to stop you. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	38	6	So they seized Jeremiah , threw him into the cistern of the royal prince Malchiah , within the prison quarters , and lowered him down by ropes . Now there wasn ’ t any water in the cistern , only mud , and Jeremiah began to sink into the mud .
CEB	Jeremiah	38	7	Ebed-melech the Cushite , a court official in the royal palace , got word that they had thrown Jeremiah into the cistern . Since the king was sitting at the Benjamin Gate ,
CEB	Jeremiah	38	8	Ebed-melech left the palace and said to the king :
CEB	Jeremiah	38	9	“ My master the king , these men have made a terrible mistake in treating the prophet Jeremiah the way they have ; they have thrown him into the cistern where he will die of starvation , for there ’ s no bread left in the city. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	38	10	Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Cushite , “ Take thirty men from here and take Jeremiah the prophet out of the cistern before he dies. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	38	11	So Ebed-melech took the men and returned to the palace , to an underground supply room , where he found some old rags and scraps of clothing . Ebed-melech lowered them down the cistern by the ropes
CEB	Jeremiah	38	12	and called to Jeremiah , “ Put these old rags and scraps of clothing under your arms and hold on to the ropes. ” When Jeremiah did this ,
CEB	Jeremiah	38	13	they pulled him up by the ropes and got him out of the cistern . After that Jeremiah remained in the prison quarters .
CEB	Jeremiah	38	14	King Zedekiah ordered that the prophet Jeremiah be brought to him at the third entrance of the Lord ’ s temple , where the king said to Jeremiah , “ I want to ask you something , and don ’ t hide anything from me. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	38	15	Jeremiah replied , “ If I do , you ’ ll kill me ! And if I tell you what to do , you won ’ t listen to me ! ”
CEB	Jeremiah	38	16	So King Zedekiah swore to Jeremiah behind closed doors , “ As the Lord lives , who has given us this life , I won ’ t put you to death and I won ’ t hand you over to those who seek to kill you. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	38	17	So Jeremiah said to Zedekiah : “ The Lord of heavenly forces , the God of Israel , proclaims : If you surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon , you and your family will live , and this city will not be burned down .
CEB	Jeremiah	38	18	If you don ’ t surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon , the city will be handed over to the Babylonians , who will burn it down , and you won ’ t escape from them. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	38	19	King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah , “ I ’ m afraid that I will fall into the hands of the Judeans who have defected to the Babylonians , and they will torture me. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	38	20	“ That won ’ t happen , ” Jeremiah replied , “ if you obey the Lord , whose message I bring . You will survive , and all will go well for you .
CEB	Jeremiah	38	21	But if you refuse to surrender , this is what the Lord has shown me :
CEB	Jeremiah	38	22	All the women left in the palace of the king of Judah will be led out to the officers of the king of Babylon . And they will say : ‘ Your trusted friends have betrayed you ; they have deceived you ; now that your feet are stuck in the mud , they are nowhere to be found. ’
CEB	Jeremiah	38	23	“ All your wives and children will be led out to the Babylonians , and you yourself won ’ t escape from them . The king of Babylon will capture you , and this city will be burned down. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	38	24	Zedekiah said to Jeremiah , “ No one is to know about these matters or else you will die .
CEB	Jeremiah	38	25	If the officials find out that we met , and they come and say to you , ‘ Tell us what you said to the king . Don ’ t hide anything from us ; otherwise , we ’ ll kill you . So what did the king say to you ? ’
CEB	Jeremiah	38	26	you should say to them , ‘ I was begging the king not to send me back to the house of Jonathan to die there. ’ ”
CEB	Jeremiah	38	27	Then all the officials approached Jeremiah to question him . And he responded exactly as the king had instructed him . So they stopped interrogating him because the conversation between the king and Jeremiah [ a ] hadn ’ t been overheard .
CEB	Jeremiah	38	28	Jeremiah remained in the prison quarters until Jerusalem was captured . Footnotes - Jeremiah 38:27 Heb lacks between the king and Jeremiah .
CEB	Jeremiah	39	39	In the ninth year and the tenth month of Judah ’ s King Zedekiah , Babylon ’ s King Nebuchadnezzar and his entire army came against Jerusalem and surrounded it .
CEB	Jeremiah	39	2	In the eleventh year of Zedekiah , on the ninth day of the fourth month , they broke through the city walls .
CEB	Jeremiah	39	3	Then all the commanding officers of the king of Babylon—Nergal-sharezer , Samgar-nebo , [ a ] Sarsechim the chief officer , Nergal-sharezer the field commander—entered it and took their places at the middle gate with the rest of the officials of the king of Babylon .
CEB	Jeremiah	39	4	When Judah ’ s King Zedekiah and his troops saw them , they tried to escape at night through the royal gardens and the gate between the two walls , toward the desert plain .
CEB	Jeremiah	39	5	But the Babylonian [ b ] army chased them down and caught Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho . They arrested him and brought him before Babylon ’ s King Nebuchadnezzar at Riblah in the land of Hamath . There the king put him on trial .
CEB	Jeremiah	39	6	The king of Babylon slaughtered Zedekiah ’ s children at Riblah before his very own eyes , and the king of Babylon slaughtered all the officials of Judah .
CEB	Jeremiah	39	7	Then he gouged out Zedekiah ’ s eyes , bound him in chains , and dragged him off to Babylon .
CEB	Jeremiah	39	8	The Babylonians burned down the royal palace and the houses of the people , and they destroyed the Jerusalem walls .
CEB	Jeremiah	39	9	Nebuzaradan the captain of the special guard rounded up the rest of the people who were left in the city , including those who had defected to the Babylonians , and deported them to Babylon .
CEB	Jeremiah	39	10	But Nebuzaradan the captain of the special guard left some of the poorest people in the land of Judah . He gave them vineyards and fields at that time .
CEB	Jeremiah	39	11	Babylon ’ s King Nebuchadnezzar gave orders concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the special guard :
CEB	Jeremiah	39	12	“ Find Jeremiah and look after him ; don ’ t harm him but do whatever he asks from you. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	39	13	So Nebuzaradan the captain of the special guard , Nebushazban the chief officer , Nergal-sharezer the field commander , and all the commanders of the king of Babylon
CEB	Jeremiah	39	14	sent orders [ c ] to release Jeremiah from the prison quarters . They entrusted him to Gedaliah , Ahikam ’ s son and Shaphan ’ s grandson , so that Jeremiah could move about freely [ d ] among the people .
CEB	Jeremiah	39	15	The Lord ’ s word came to Jeremiah when he was still confined to the prison quarters :
CEB	Jeremiah	39	16	Go and say to Ebed-melech the Cushite that the Lord of heavenly forces , the God of Israel , proclaims : I ’ m about to fulfill my words concerning this city , for harm and not for good . You will witness it for yourself on that day .
CEB	Jeremiah	39	17	But on that day , declares the Lord : I will rescue you ; you won ’ t be handed over to those you dread .
CEB	Jeremiah	39	18	I will defend you ; you won ’ t die in battle . You will escape with your life , because you have trusted in me , declares the Lord .

CEB	Jeremiah	40	40	Jeremiah received the Lord ’ s word after Nebuzaradan the captain of the special guard had released him from Ramah . He had been bound in chains there along with all the other detainees from Jerusalem and Judah who were being sent off to Babylon .
CEB	Jeremiah	40	2	The captain of the special guard located Jeremiah and said to him , “ The Lord your God declared that a great disaster would overtake this place .
CEB	Jeremiah	40	3	Now the Lord has made it happen . He has done just as he warned because all of you have sinned against the Lord and haven ’ t obeyed him . That ’ s why this has happened to you .
CEB	Jeremiah	40	4	But I ’ m setting you free from the chains on your hands . If you would like , come with me to Babylon , and I ’ ll take care of you . If you would rather not come with me , that ’ s fine too . Now , the whole land lies before you ; go wherever you want .
CEB	Jeremiah	40	5	If you decide to remain here , [ a ] stay with Gedaliah , Ahikam ’ s son and Shaphan ’ s grandson—the Babylonian appointee in charge of the cities of Judah . Stay with him and the people he rules or go wherever you want. ” Then the captain of the special guard gave him ample provisions and let him go .
CEB	Jeremiah	40	6	Jeremiah went to Gedaliah , Ahikam ’ s son at Mizpah , and he stayed with him and the people who remained in the land . Gedaliah ’ s provisional government
CEB	Jeremiah	40	7	Some of the army officers and their troops were still hiding out in the countryside when they heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah , Ahikam ’ s son , over the region , responsible for the men , women , and children who were the poorest in the land and who hadn ’ t been deported to Babylon .
CEB	Jeremiah	40	8	So they went out to meet Gedaliah at Mizpah : Ishmael , Nethaniah ’ s son ; Johanan and Jonathan , Kareah ’ s sons ; Seraiah son of Tanhumeth ; the sons of Ephai the Netophathite ; Jezaniah son of the Maacathite ; and their troops .
CEB	Jeremiah	40	9	Gedaliah , Ahikam ’ s son and Shaphan ’ s grandson , firmly assured them all : “ Don ’ t be afraid of serving the Babylonians . Remain in the land , serve the king of Babylon , and all will go well for you .
CEB	Jeremiah	40	10	But me ? I will stay at Mizpah so I can speak on your behalf when the Babylonians arrive . But you ? Settle down in the towns you have taken ; harvest the grapes , the summer fruits and figs , and then store them in your containers. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	40	11	In the same way , all the Judeans living in Moab , Ammon , Edom , and in other countries heard that the king of Babylon had left a few people in the land and that he had put Gedaliah , Ahikam ’ s son and Shaphan ’ s grandson , in charge of them .
CEB	Jeremiah	40	12	So they left the places where they had been scattered and returned to the land , to Gedaliah at Mizpah . There they gathered large amounts of grapes and summer fruits .
CEB	Jeremiah	40	13	Johanan , Kareah ’ s son , and all the army officers in the countryside approached Gedaliah at Mizpah
CEB	Jeremiah	40	14	and said to him , “ Are you aware that King Baalis of Ammon has sent Ishmael , Nethaniah ’ s son , to kill you ? ” But Gedaliah , Ahikam ’ s son , wouldn ’ t believe them .
CEB	Jeremiah	40	15	Still Johanan , Kareah ’ s son , met with Gedaliah secretly at Mizpah and said to him , “ Let me go and kill Ishmael , Nethaniah ’ s son ; no one needs to knows about this matter . Otherwise , he ’ ll kill you , and all the Judeans who have gathered around you will be scattered , and the few who are left will perish. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	40	16	But Gedaliah son of Ahikam told Johanan , Kareah ’ s son , “ Don ’ t do such a thing , for what you are saying about Ishmael is wrong. ” Footnotes - Jeremiah 40:5 Heb uncertain
CEB	Jeremiah	41	41	In the seventh month , [ a ] Ishmael , Nethaniah ’ s son and Elishama ’ s grandson , who was from a royal family and who was one of the chief officers of the king , came with ten men to Gedaliah , Ahikam ’ s son , at Mizpah . While they were eating a meal together ,
CEB	Jeremiah	41	2	Ishmael , Nethaniah ’ s son , and the ten men got up and struck down Gedaliah , Ahikam ’ s son and Shaphan ’ s grandson , with the sword . They murdered him because he had been appointed over the region by the king of Babylon .
CEB	Jeremiah	41	3	Ishmael also murdered all the Judeans who had rallied around Gedaliah at Mizpah as well as the Babylonian soldiers who were posted there .
CEB	Jeremiah	41	4	The day after Gedaliah was killed , before anyone knew of it ,
CEB	Jeremiah	41	5	eighty men with shaved beards , torn clothes , and gashed bodies arrived from Shechem , Shiloh , and Samaria . They were bringing grain offerings and incense to present at the Lord ’ s temple .
CEB	Jeremiah	41	6	Ishmael , Nethaniah ’ s son , left Mizpah to meet them , weeping as he went . When he reached them , he said , “ Come to Gedaliah , Ahikam ’ s son ! ”
CEB	Jeremiah	41	7	When they arrived in the middle of the town , Ishmael , Nethaniah ’ s son , and the men with him slaughtered them and threw their bodies [ b ] into a cistern .
CEB	Jeremiah	41	8	But there were ten men among them who begged Ishmael , “ Don ’ t kill us ; we have wheat , barley , oil , and honey hidden in a field. ” So he stopped and didn ’ t kill them along with the rest . (
CEB	Jeremiah	41	9	Now the cistern that Ishmael used to discard the bodies of the men he had killed because of their association with Gedaliah [ c ] was the one that King Asa had made to defend against Israel ’ s King Baasha . Ishmael , Nethaniah ’ s son , filled it with the dead . )
CEB	Jeremiah	41	10	Ishmael captured the rest of the people who were at Mizpah , including the daughters of the king and all those assigned to Gedaliah , Ahikam ’ s son , at Mizpah by Nebuzaradan the captain of the special guard . Then Ishmael , Nethaniah ’ s son , set out to cross over to the Ammonites with the hostages .
CEB	Jeremiah	41	11	Johanan , Kareah ’ s son , and all the army officers at his side heard of the terrible acts committed by Ishmael , Nethaniah ’ s son .
CEB	Jeremiah	41	12	So they mustered all their forces and went to fight him . They found Ishmael , Nethaniah ’ s son , at the great pool in Gibeon .
CEB	Jeremiah	41	13	When all those taken by Ishmael at Mizpah saw Johanan , Kareah ’ s son , and all his army officers with him , they were delighted .
CEB	Jeremiah	41	14	They rallied around Johanan , Kareah ’ s son , and returned home with him .
CEB	Jeremiah	41	15	But Ishmael , Nethaniah ’ s son , and eight of his men eluded Johanan and went to the Ammonites .
CEB	Jeremiah	41	16	Then Johanan , Kareah ’ s son , and all the army officers with him took the small group they had rescued in Gibeon , including the soldiers , women , children , and commanding officers that Ishmael , Nethaniah ’ s son , had captured at Mizpah after killing Gedaliah , Ahikam ’ s son .
CEB	Jeremiah	41	17	They set out for Egypt , stopping on the way at Geruth Chimham near Bethlehem ,
CEB	Jeremiah	41	18	because they were afraid of what the Babylonians would do when they found out that Ishmael , Nethaniah ’ s son , had killed Gedaliah , Ahikam ’ s son , whom the king of Babylon had appointed over the region .

CEB	Jeremiah	42	42	Then all the army officers , including Johanan , Kareah ’ s son , and Jezaniah , Hoshaiah ’ s son , and the rest of the people , from the least to the greatest , approached
CEB	Jeremiah	42	2	Jeremiah the prophet and said to him , “ We have something to ask you : Please pray to the Lord your God for us , this small group , for as you can see we were once many but now are very few .
CEB	Jeremiah	42	3	May the Lord your God show us where we should go and what we should do. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	42	4	The prophet Jeremiah replied , “ Yes , I ’ ll pray to the Lord your God as you have asked . And I ’ ll tell you whatever the Lord says ; I won ’ t hide anything from you. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	42	5	Then they said to Jeremiah , “ May the Lord be a true and faithful witness against us if we fail to do everything that the Lord your God tells us through you .
CEB	Jeremiah	42	6	Whether we like it or not , we will obey all that the Lord our God says . We will obey the Lord our God , to whom we ’ re sending you , so it may go well for us. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	42	7	Ten days later Jeremiah received the Lord ’ s word .
CEB	Jeremiah	42	8	So he called Johanan , Kareah ’ s son , and all the army officers with him and the rest of the people , from the least to the greatest ,
CEB	Jeremiah	42	9	and he said to them : You have sent me to present your plea to the Lord , and this is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says :
CEB	Jeremiah	42	10	If you live in this land , I will build you up and not pull you down . I will plant you and not dig you up because I grieve over the disaster I have brought upon you .
CEB	Jeremiah	42	11	You don ’ t have to be afraid of the king of Babylon , whom you now fear . You don ’ t have to be afraid of him anymore , declares the Lord , for I will be with you to save you and rescue you from his hand .
CEB	Jeremiah	42	12	I will be merciful to you , and he will be merciful and return you to your land .
CEB	Jeremiah	42	13	But if you say , “ We won ’ t live in this land , ” you will disobey the Lord your God .
CEB	Jeremiah	42	14	And if you insist , “ No , we ’ re going to live in Egypt , where there ’ s no war , battle alarms , or hunger , and there we will stay , ”
CEB	Jeremiah	42	15	then listen to the Lord ’ s word , you remaining Judeans . The Lord of heavenly forces , the God of Israel , proclaims : If you are determined to go to Egypt and you then go and live there ,
CEB	Jeremiah	42	16	then the war you fear will seize you in the land of Egypt ; and the famine you dread will hunt you down in Egypt , and there you will die .
CEB	Jeremiah	42	17	Every one of you who is determined to go and live in Egypt will die by the sword , famine , and disease . No one will escape the disaster that I will bring upon them there .
CEB	Jeremiah	42	18	The Lord of heavenly forces , the God of Israel , proclaims : Just as my fierce anger was poured out on the people of Jerusalem , so it will be poured out on you if you go to Egypt . You will become an object of cursing , scorn , shock , and disgrace . And you will never see this place again .
CEB	Jeremiah	42	19	You who survive from Judah , the Lord has told you : Don ’ t go to Egypt . Know without a doubt that I have warned you this day .
CEB	Jeremiah	42	20	You are putting your lives at risk [ a ] by sending me to the Lord your God , saying , “ Pray for us to the Lord our God ; tell us everything the Lord our God says , and we ’ ll do it. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	42	21	Today I have told you , but you still haven ’ t obeyed all that the Lord your God has sent me to tell you .
CEB	Jeremiah	42	22	So know without a doubt that you will die by war , famine , and disease in the place you yearn to go and live . Footnotes - Jeremiah 42:20 Or to do evil
CEB	Jeremiah	43	43	When Jeremiah finished telling the people all the words of the Lord their God—he didn ’ t omit anything the Lord sent him to convey—
CEB	Jeremiah	43	2	Azariah , Hoshaiah ’ s son , and Johanan , Kareah ’ s son , and all the arrogant men said to Jeremiah , “ You ’ re lying to us ! The Lord our God didn ’ t send you to tell us not to go to Egypt to live .
CEB	Jeremiah	43	3	It ’ s Baruch , Neriah ’ s son , who put you up to it so that we end up in the hands of the Babylonians , who will either kill us or deport us to Babylon. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	43	4	So Johanan , Kareah ’ s son , and all the army officers and the rest of the people disobeyed the Lord ’ s command to stay in the land of Judah .
CEB	Jeremiah	43	5	Johanan , Kareah ’ s son , and all the army officers took the remaining Judeans who had returned to the land of Judah after being scattered among the nations—
CEB	Jeremiah	43	6	men , women , children , the king ’ s daughters , everyone Nebuzaradan the captain of the special guard had left with Gedaliah , Ahikam ’ s son and Shaphan ’ s grandson , including Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch , Neriah ’ s son .
CEB	Jeremiah	43	7	They went to the land of Egypt , as far as Tahpanhes , for they wouldn ’ t obey the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	43	8	The Lord ’ s word came to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes :
CEB	Jeremiah	43	9	Take some large stones and set them in the clay pavement [ a ] in front of Pharaoh ’ s palace in Tahpanhes while the people of Judah are watching .
CEB	Jeremiah	43	10	After that , say to the people : The Lord of heavenly forces , the God of Israel , proclaims : I ’ m sending for my servant King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon , who [ b ] will set his throne over these stones and will spread his canopy over them .
CEB	Jeremiah	43	11	He will come and ravage the land of Egypt : those marked for disaster , to disaster , and those marked for exile , to exile . and those marked for war , to war .
CEB	Jeremiah	43	12	He will set on fire [ c ] the temples of the Egyptian gods . He will burn them down and carry off their gods . He will wrap the land of Egypt around himself , just as a shepherd wraps [ d ] his garment around himself , and he will move on unharmed . [ e ]
CEB	Jeremiah	43	13	He will shatter the sacred pillars in the temple of the sun in Egypt and burn down the temples of the Egyptian gods .

CEB	Jeremiah	44	44	Jeremiah received the Lord ’ s word for the Judeans living in the land of Egypt , those living in Migdol , Tahpanhes , and Memphis and in the land of Pathros .
CEB	Jeremiah	44	2	The Lord of heavenly forces , the God of Israel , proclaims : You have seen the disaster I brought on Jerusalem and the towns of Judah . They are now a wasteland with no one left
CEB	Jeremiah	44	3	because of their evil ways . They have angered me by making offerings and worshipping other gods that neither they nor you nor your ancestors knew .
CEB	Jeremiah	44	4	Yet time and again I sent you all my servants the prophets , saying , “ Don ’ t do these detestable things that I hate. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	44	5	But they wouldn ’ t listen or pay attention or turn from their evil ways . They continued making offerings to other gods .
CEB	Jeremiah	44	6	So my fierce anger poured out and blazed against the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem . And they were reduced to an utter wasteland , as they are today .
CEB	Jeremiah	44	7	Now the Lord of heavenly forces , the God of Israel , proclaims : Why are you committing this huge mistake that will cost you your lives ? Every man , woman , child , and infant will be eliminated from the midst of Judah , and no one will be left .
CEB	Jeremiah	44	8	Why do you anger me by what you do : by burning incense to other gods in the land of Egypt where you have come to live ? You will be eliminated and become an object of cursing and disgrace among all the nations of the earth .
CEB	Jeremiah	44	9	Have you forgotten the sins of your ancestors and the sins of the kings of Judah and their wives ? [ a ] Have you forgotten the sins that you and your wives committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem ?
CEB	Jeremiah	44	10	To this day you [ b ] haven ’ t shown any sorrow for what you have done . And you haven ’ t revered me or followed my Instruction and my laws that I set before you and your ancestors .
CEB	Jeremiah	44	11	Therefore , the Lord of heavenly forces , the God of Israel , proclaims : I ’ m determined to bring disaster on you , to eliminate all of Judah .
CEB	Jeremiah	44	12	I will take the few remaining Judeans who were determined to go to the land of Egypt to live . They will all perish there . They will fall by the sword and perish due to famine . The least to the greatest will die by the sword and by famine . They will become an object of cursing , scorn , contempt , and disgrace .
CEB	Jeremiah	44	13	I will punish those who live in the land of Egypt , just as I punished Jerusalem with war , famine , and disease .
CEB	Jeremiah	44	14	From the few remaining in Judah , no fugitive or survivor who came to live here in the land of Egypt will be able to return to the land of Judah . Even though they want to return and live there , they won ’ t be able to return , except for some fugitives .
CEB	Jeremiah	44	15	Then all the men who knew that their wives had made offerings to other gods , along with the great crowd of women who were present , as well as the people living in Pathros in the land of Egypt , all answered Jeremiah :
CEB	Jeremiah	44	16	“ We ’ re not going to listen to a word you have said to us in the Lord ’ s name !
CEB	Jeremiah	44	17	No , we ’ re going to do exactly what we want : We ’ re going to burn incense to the queen of heaven and pour out drink offerings to her , as we and our ancestors , our kings and our officials , have done in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem . Then we had plenty to eat and we were thriving ; we didn ’ t have any troubles .
CEB	Jeremiah	44	18	But ever since we stopped burning incense to the queen of heaven and pouring drink offerings to her , we have been destroyed by the sword and by famine. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	44	19	And the women added , [ c ] “ Do you think that we burn incense to the queen of heaven and pour drink offerings to her without our husbands ’ support when we make cakes in her image and pour drink offerings to her ? ”
CEB	Jeremiah	44	20	Jeremiah said to all the people , men and women alike , in fact everyone who had spoken this way :
CEB	Jeremiah	44	21	“ Do you really think the Lord was unaware of what you were up to in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem ? Don ’ t you think the Lord knew that you and your ancestors were making offerings to other gods [ d ] —along with your kings and officials , and the people of the land ?
CEB	Jeremiah	44	22	It got so bad that the Lord could no longer bear your evil and shameless acts ; it was at that point that your land was reduced to an utter wasteland and a curse , as it is today .
CEB	Jeremiah	44	23	The current dire situation occurred because you made offerings to other gods [ e ] and sinned against the Lord—because you wouldn ’ t obey the Lord or follow the Lord ’ s instruction , laws , or warnings. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	44	24	Then Jeremiah said to all the people , including the women : Listen to the Lord ’ s word , all you Judeans in the land of Egypt .
CEB	Jeremiah	44	25	The Lord of heavenly forces , the God of Israel , proclaims : You and your wives have done exactly what you said you would do . You said , “ We will definitely fulfill our promise to burn incense to the queen of heaven and pour out drink offerings to her. ” Go ahead and keep your promises !
CEB	Jeremiah	44	26	But listen to the Lord ’ s word , all you Judeans who live in the land of Egypt . I swear by my great name , says the Lord , that no one from Judah living in Egypt will utter my name again , even in the solemn pledge : “ As surely as the Lord God lives. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	44	27	I ’ m watching over them for harm and not for good . Everyone from Judah who is living in the land of Egypt will die by the sword and by famine , until all are gone .
CEB	Jeremiah	44	28	Those who actually survive war and return from Egypt to the land of Judah will be very few . Then the few remaining Judeans living in Egypt will know for certain whose word is true—mine or theirs !
CEB	Jeremiah	44	29	And this will be a sign for you , declares the Lord : I will punish you here so that you know my threats against you will surely be fulfilled .
CEB	Jeremiah	44	30	The Lord proclaims : I will hand Pharaoh Hophra , Egypt ’ s king , over to his enemies who seek to kill him , just as I delivered Judah ’ s King Zedekiah over to his enemy King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon , who sought to kill him .

CEB	Jeremiah	45	45	In the fourth year of Judah ’ s King Jehoiakim , Josiah ’ s son , Baruch was writing in a scroll the words that Jeremiah was dictating to him . Jeremiah the prophet told Baruch , Neriah ’ s son :
CEB	Jeremiah	45	2	This is what the Lord the God of Israel proclaims about you , Baruch :
CEB	Jeremiah	45	3	You have said , “ I can ’ t take it anymore ! The Lord has added sorrow to my pain . I ’ m worn out from groaning and can find no rest. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	45	4	This is what you should say to him : “ The Lord proclaims : I ’ m breaking down everything I have built up . I ’ m digging up that which I have planted—the entire land .
CEB	Jeremiah	45	5	You seek great things for yourself , but don ’ t bother . I ’ m bringing disaster on all humanity , declares the Lord , but wherever you go I will let you escape with your life. ” Bible Gateway Recommends CEB Common English Bible Audio Edition with music - Joshua , Judges , Ruth - Unabridged Audiobook [ Download ] Our Price : $ 2.99 The CEB Study Bible Hardcover - Slightly Imperfect Retail : $ 59.99 Our Price : $ 37.39 Save : $ 22.60 (

CEB	Jeremiah	46	46	This is what the Lord told the prophet Jeremiah concerning the nations . Prophecy against Egypt
CEB	Jeremiah	46	2	About Egypt ! A message for the army of Pharaoh Neco , Egypt ’ s king , which was defeated by Babylon ’ s Nebuchadnezzar at Carchemish near the Euphrates River in the fourth year of Judah ’ s King Jehoiakim , Josiah ’ s son :
CEB	Jeremiah	46	3	Grab your shields and prepare for war !
CEB	Jeremiah	46	4	Saddle the horses ; mount the stallions ! Take your positions with helmets on ! Polish your spears ; put on your armor !
CEB	Jeremiah	46	5	Why do I see them terrified , retreating in haste ? Their soldiers are crushed , running for cover , and they don ’ t turn back . Panic lurks at every turn , declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	46	6	The swift can ’ t flee ; the mighty can ’ t escape . Up north by the Euphrates River , they stagger and fall .
CEB	Jeremiah	46	7	Who is this that rises like the Nile , whose banks overflow ? [ a ]
CEB	Jeremiah	46	8	It ’ s Egypt that rises like the Nile , whose banks overflow , [ b ] who declares , “ I will arise and cover the earth and destroy cities and inhabitants. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	46	9	Charge , you horses ; advance , you chariots ! Attack , you soldiers with your shield in hand , you people of Cush and Put [ c ] with your bow drawn , you archers from Lud .
CEB	Jeremiah	46	10	But that day belongs to the Lord God of heavenly forces ; it ’ s a day of reckoning , settling scores with enemies . The sword will devour until it has had its fill of blood . The Lord God of heavenly forces is preparing a sacrifice in the north by the Euphrates River .
CEB	Jeremiah	46	11	Go up to Gilead and seek balm , virgin Daughter Egypt . You search out remedies in vain , for your disease is incurable .
CEB	Jeremiah	46	12	Nations hear of your shame ; the earth is filled with your sobs . Soldier stumbles over soldier ; together they go down .
CEB	Jeremiah	46	13	This is the word that the Lord spoke to the prophet Jeremiah about the military offensive of Babylon ’ s King Nebuchadnezzar against the land of Egypt :
CEB	Jeremiah	46	14	Tell Egypt , warn Migdol , alert Memphis and Tahpanhes ! Say : “ Brace yourselves for what ’ s coming . War is breaking out from every side ! ”
CEB	Jeremiah	46	15	Why have your mighty fallen ? Why haven ’ t they stood their ground ? Because the Lord has struck them down .
CEB	Jeremiah	46	16	He ’ s tripped them up ; they fall over each other and say , “ Let ’ s get out of here and go home to our people , where we were born , far away from the oppressor ’ s sword. ” [ d ]
CEB	Jeremiah	46	17	There they call Pharaoh , Egypt ’ s king , Loudmouth—Nothing But Hot Air !
CEB	Jeremiah	46	18	As I live , declares the king , whose name is the Lord of heavenly forces , one is coming just as surely as Tabor is in the mountains and Carmel is by the sea . [ e ]
CEB	Jeremiah	46	19	Get what you need for deportation , you inhabitants of Egypt . [ f ] Memphis will be reduced to a wasteland , a ruin with no one left .
CEB	Jeremiah	46	20	Egypt is a beautiful , yes , beautiful heifer , but a horsefly from the north is coming to bite her . [ g ]
CEB	Jeremiah	46	21	Even her mercenaries are like well-fed calves ; they too will retreat and run for cover ; they won ’ t survive . The day of disaster has come to haunt them , the time of their punishment .
CEB	Jeremiah	46	22	Like the sound of a snake hissing as it slithers away is Egypt [ h ] as armies approach in force ; they come against her with axes , like woodcutters .
CEB	Jeremiah	46	23	They destroy her dense forest , though it is vast , because they outnumber locusts and can ’ t be counted , declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	46	24	Daughter Egypt will be humiliated , handed over to people from the north .
CEB	Jeremiah	46	25	This is what the Lord of heavenly forces , the God of Israel , proclaims : I ’ m going to punish Amon of Thebes , Egypt and its gods and kings , as well as Pharaoh and all who rely on him .
CEB	Jeremiah	46	26	I will hand them over to those who seek to kill them , namely Babylon ’ s King Nebuchadnezzar and his servants . But afterward Egypt will dwell like it did a long time ago , declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	46	27	But don ’ t be afraid , my servant Judah ; don ’ t lose heart , Israel . I will deliver you from a faraway place and your children from the land of their exile . My people Jacob will again be safe and sound , with no one harassing them .
CEB	Jeremiah	46	28	So don ’ t be afraid , my servant Jacob , declares the Lord . I ’ m with you ; I will put an end to all the nations where I have scattered you . But I won ’ t put an end to you . I won ’ t let you avoid punishment ; I will discipline you as you deserve .

CEB	Jeremiah	47	47	The Lord ’ s word to the prophet Jeremiah concerning the Philistines before Pharaoh conquered Gaza .
CEB	Jeremiah	47	2	The Lord proclaims : Waters are rising from the north and turning into a raging flood . They will engulf the land and everything in it , the towns and those living in them . The people cry out ; all who live there scream .
CEB	Jeremiah	47	3	At the pounding of the stallions ’ hooves , at the deafening roar of the chariots ’ wheels , parents abandon children , so paralyzed are they with fear .
CEB	Jeremiah	47	4	Because the time is coming for the Philistines ’ destruction , for cutting off from Tyre and Sidon anyone who might try to save Gaza , [ a ] because the Lord will destroy the Philistines , the few left from the island of Caphtor .
CEB	Jeremiah	47	5	Mourning [ b ] will come upon Gaza ; silence will cover Ashkelon , the few left in their valley . How long will you gash yourselves in grief ? [ c ]
CEB	Jeremiah	47	6	You sword of the Lord , how long until you are silent ? Return to your sheath ; rest and be still !
CEB	Jeremiah	47	7	How can you be silent when the Lord has directed you [ d ] to attack Ashkelon and the coast line ? Footnotes - Jeremiah 47:4 Or a helper - Jeremiah 47:5 Or baldness - Jeremiah 47:5 Heb lacks in grief . - Jeremiah 47:7 Or it
CEB	Jeremiah	48	48	Concerning Moab : The Lord of heavenly forces , the God of Israel , proclaims : How awful for Nebo ; it lies in ruins . Kirathaim is captured and shamed ; the fortress is disgraced , reduced to rubble .
CEB	Jeremiah	48	2	No one sings Moab ’ s praise any longer ! In Heshbon they are hatching a plot against her : “ Come , let ’ s bring down the nation ! ” You too , Madmen , will be silenced ; the sword will pursue you .
CEB	Jeremiah	48	3	Listen to the cries for help from Horonaim : “ Destruction and massive devastation ! ”
CEB	Jeremiah	48	4	Moab is shattered ; its young cry for help .
CEB	Jeremiah	48	5	On the way up to Luhith , there is uncontrollable weeping . On the way down to Horonaim , they hear sobs of anguish .
CEB	Jeremiah	48	6	Run for your lives ! Be like Aroer [ a ] in the desert .
CEB	Jeremiah	48	7	Because you have relied on your own strength and treasures , you also will be captured . Chemosh will go into exile , together with his priests and officials .
CEB	Jeremiah	48	8	The destroyer will sweep through every town ; no town will escape . The valleys will be ravaged ; the plateaus will be destroyed , because the Lord has declared it so .
CEB	Jeremiah	48	9	Give wings to Moab , and it would fly away [ b ] because its towns lie in ruins , with no one left in them .
CEB	Jeremiah	48	10	Cursed is the one who is halfhearted in doing the Lord ’ s work . Cursed is the one who restrains the sword from bloodshed .
CEB	Jeremiah	48	11	From early on Moab has been at ease , like wine [ c ] left to settle on its sediment . It hasn ’ t been poured into jars ; nor has Moab been taken into exile . Therefore , its taste is still pleasant , and its aroma is the same .
CEB	Jeremiah	48	12	But the time is coming , declares the Lord , when I will send to him someone to spill it—to pour out his wine and to smash his jars .
CEB	Jeremiah	48	13	And Moab will be put to shame on account of Chemosh , just as the people of Israel were put to shame on account of Bethel , in which they trusted . [ d ]
CEB	Jeremiah	48	14	How can you claim , “ We ’ re soldiers ; we ’ re war heroes ” ?
CEB	Jeremiah	48	15	Moab is doomed ; its towns will surrender ; [ e ] its elite forces will go down in defeat , declares the king whose name is the Lord of heavenly forces .
CEB	Jeremiah	48	16	Moab ’ s destruction is near ; its downfall approaches rapidly .
CEB	Jeremiah	48	17	Grieve for this nation , you neighbors of Moab , all you who know his name . Proclaim how its mighty scepter and magnificent staff are shattered !
CEB	Jeremiah	48	18	Come down from your lofty place and sit in the dust , [ f ] you inhabitants of Daughter Dibon ; [ g ] because Moab ’ s destroyer has arrived to level your fortresses .
CEB	Jeremiah	48	19	Stand by the roads and watch , you inhabitants of Aroer . Ask the men who flee and the women who run off , “ What ’ s happened ? ”
CEB	Jeremiah	48	20	Moab is shamed and shocked ; weep and wail ! Tell it by the Arnon River : Moab ’ s been destroyed !
CEB	Jeremiah	48	21	Judgment has come to the towns of the plateau— to Holon , Jahzah , and Mephaath ,
CEB	Jeremiah	48	22	to Dibon , Nebo , and Beth-diblathaim ,
CEB	Jeremiah	48	23	to Kiriathaim , Beth-gamul , and Beth-meon ,
CEB	Jeremiah	48	24	to Kerioth and Bozrah , to all the towns of Moab , far and near .
CEB	Jeremiah	48	25	Moab ’ s horn is cut off ; its arm is broken , declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	48	26	Get Moab drunk , because it has exalted itself above the Lord . Moab will collapse in its vomit and become the butt of every joke .
CEB	Jeremiah	48	27	Wasn ’ t Israel the butt of your jokes ? Didn ’ t you shake your head as if they were thieves caught in the act ?
CEB	Jeremiah	48	28	Leave your towns , head for the cliffs , you people of Moab . Hide like a dove that nests in the mouth of a cave .
CEB	Jeremiah	48	29	We have heard of Moab ’ s pride : arrogant , puffed up , exalted , high and mighty , boastful !
CEB	Jeremiah	48	30	I myself know about its arrogance , declares the Lord , the idle talk , the empty deeds .
CEB	Jeremiah	48	31	But I ’ ll still wail for Moab ; I ’ ll cry out for all Moab ; I ’ ll [ h ] sob for the people of Kir-heres .
CEB	Jeremiah	48	32	I ’ ll weep for you , vine of Sibmah , more than I would for Jazer . Though your branches extended to the sea and reached the coast of Jazer , now the destroyer has come to harvest your grapes and summer fruits .
CEB	Jeremiah	48	33	Joy and gladness have been taken from the orchards and farms of Moab . I have stopped making wine in the presses . No one shouts with joy while treading the grapes . Though there are shouts , they are not shouts of joy ! [ i ]
CEB	Jeremiah	48	34	Screams are heard from Heshbon to Elealeh and Jahaz ; their cries resound from Zoar to Horonaim and Eglath-shelishiyah . Even the waters of Nimrim are dried up .
CEB	Jeremiah	48	35	I ’ ll put an end to Moab , declares the Lord , for making offerings on the shrines , and worshipping their gods .
CEB	Jeremiah	48	36	Therefore , my heart wails for Moab like a mournful [ j ] flute that plays the dirge ; my heart wails for the people of Kir-heres , like a mournful flute . Their abundance is now gone .
CEB	Jeremiah	48	37	Every head is shaved , every beard is cut off , every hand is slashed , and everyone wears mourning clothes .
CEB	Jeremiah	48	38	On every housetop of Moab and in all its streets , there ’ s nothing but mourning . I have shattered Moab like a pottery vessel no one wants , declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	48	39	How it ’ s shattered ! Go wail ! How Moab turns away ! What shame ! Moab has become the butt of every joke , horrific to all its neighbors .
CEB	Jeremiah	48	40	The Lord proclaims : Look ! One who soars like an eagle and spreads its wings over Moab .
CEB	Jeremiah	48	41	The towns will be captured ; the strongholds will be seized . On that day , the heart of every soldier from Moab will be like that of a woman in the throes of labor .
CEB	Jeremiah	48	42	Moab will be destroyed once and for all because it has exalted itself above the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	48	43	Terror , traps , and trackers [ k ] are upon you , people of Moab , declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	48	44	Those who flee from terror will fall into a pit ; those who escape the pit will be captured by the trap . I will bring upon Moab the year of its punishment , declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	48	45	In Heshbon tired refugees seek shelter . But fire is raging in Heshbon , flames from the house [ l ] of Sihon . It has burned up part of Moab , including the leader of this rebellious nation . [ m ]
CEB	Jeremiah	48	46	How terrible for you , Moab ; the people of Chemosh have perished . Your sons have been carried off ; your daughters have been taken captive .
CEB	Jeremiah	48	47	But in the days to come I ’ ll bring back Moab from captivity , declares the Lord . Such is the judgment on Moab .

CEB	Jeremiah	49	49	Concerning the Ammonites , the Lord proclaims : Doesn ’ t Israel have children ? Aren ’ t there heirs to his land ? Why then has Milcom taken over Gad ? Why have his people settled in its towns ?
CEB	Jeremiah	49	2	Therefore , the time is coming , declares the Lord , when I will sound the battle alarm against Rabbah , the capital city of the Ammonites . The city will be demolished , and its neighboring villages will be burned to the ground . Then Israel will repossess the land seized by its captors , says the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	49	3	Weep , you people of Heshbon ; Ai has been destroyed . Wail , you daughters of Rabbah ; put on funeral clothing , cry your eyes out , run for shelter . [ a ] Milcom will surely go into exile , together with his priests and ministers .
CEB	Jeremiah	49	4	Why do you brag about your strength ? Your strength is exhausted , [ b ] you rebellious daughter . You trust in your treasures , never imagining who would attack you .
CEB	Jeremiah	49	5	I ’ m the one who will terrify you from every side , declares the Lord of heavenly forces . Every one of you will be scattered about ; no one will gather those who fled .
CEB	Jeremiah	49	6	Afterward , though , I will bring back the Ammonites from captivity , declares the Lord . Prophecy against Edom
CEB	Jeremiah	49	7	Concerning Edom , the Lord of heavenly forces proclaims : Is wisdom no longer in Teman ? Has good sense vanished from the perceptive ? Are they no longer wise ?
CEB	Jeremiah	49	8	Turn , flee , and run for cover , you inhabitants of Dedan . I ’ m bringing disaster on Esau : its day of reckoning .
CEB	Jeremiah	49	9	If workers would come to you to pick grapes , they would at least leave a few on the vine . If thieves would come in the night , they would take only what they needed .
CEB	Jeremiah	49	10	But me ? I will strip Esau bare . I will expose his hiding places , and he will find no place to take cover . His offspring , family , and acquaintances will perish , and there will be no one left to say , [ c ]
CEB	Jeremiah	49	11	“ Leave me your orphans , and I ’ ll look after them ; trust your widows into my care. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	49	12	The Lord proclaims : If the innocent must drink the cup , why do you expect to escape punishment ? You won ’ t ! You will drink it !
CEB	Jeremiah	49	13	I myself swear , declares the Lord , that Bozrah will become an object of horror and scorn , a wasteland and a curse . And all of its towns will lie in ruins forever .
CEB	Jeremiah	49	14	I have heard a report from the Lord that a messenger is sent among the nations : Join forces and come against her ; prepare for war !
CEB	Jeremiah	49	15	I ’ m about to cut you down to size before the nations ; you will be scorned by everyone .
CEB	Jeremiah	49	16	The terror you have inflicted on others has deceived you , as has your own pride . Though you live in a fortress and occupy the high ground ; though you nest on high like the eagles , I will bring you down , declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	49	17	Then Edom will become a wasteland . All who pass by will be shocked by its injuries .
CEB	Jeremiah	49	18	It will be like the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah and their surrounding towns , says the Lord . No one will live there ; no human will dwell in it .
CEB	Jeremiah	49	19	Like a lion coming up from the jungle of the Jordan to a well-watered meadow , [ d ] so I will suddenly chase down Edom and single out its choicest of rams . [ e ] Who is like me ? Who can direct me ? What shepherd can withstand me ?
CEB	Jeremiah	49	20	Therefore , listen to the counsel that the Lord has for Edom and the plans he ’ s devised against the people of Teman : The little ones of the flock will be dragged off , as their pasture watches in utter disbelief . [ f ]
CEB	Jeremiah	49	21	The earth quakes as the Edomites go down ; their screams echo as far as the Reed Sea . [ g ]
CEB	Jeremiah	49	22	Look ! One who mounts up and soars like an eagle , who swoops down and spreads his wings over Bozrah . On that day , the heart of every soldier from Edom will be like that of a woman in the throes of labor . Prophecy against Damascus
CEB	Jeremiah	49	23	Concerning Damascus : Hamath and Arpad lose heart when they hear the bad news . They are trembling with fear , like the raging sea , which can ’ t become quiet .
CEB	Jeremiah	49	24	Damascus staggers about ; she tries to flee , but panic overwhelms her . She ’ s gripped by anguish and pain , like a woman in labor .
CEB	Jeremiah	49	25	Forsaken [ h ] is the renowned city , city of my delight .
CEB	Jeremiah	49	26	Yes , her young men will fall in the streets , and her soldiers will be silent on that day , declares the Lord of heavenly forces .

CEB	Jeremiah	49	30	Run away ; take cover , you people of Hazor , declares the Lord . Babylon ’ s King Nebuchadnezzar has taken counsel and devised a plan against you .
CEB	Jeremiah	49	31	Get ready to attack a nation that feels safe and secure , declares the Lord , one without barred gates that lives by itself .
CEB	Jeremiah	49	32	Their camels will become plunder ; their many cattle will be pillaged . I will scatter to the winds those who are clean-shaven , [ j ] and I will bring disaster on them from every side , declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	49	33	Hazor will become a den for wild dogs , a wilderness forever . No one will live there ; no human will dwell in it . Prophecy against Elam

CEB	Jeremiah	50	50	This is what the Lord said concerning Babylon and the land of the Babylonians through the prophet Jeremiah :
CEB	Jeremiah	50	2	Tell the nations ; proclaim it far and wide ! Set up a flag ; proclaim it far and wide ! Hold nothing back ; just shout it : “ Babylon is captured ; Bel is shamed ; Marduk is panic-stricken . Her images are shamed ; her idols are panic-stricken. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	50	3	A nation from the north has risen up against her . It will decimate her land , and no one will live in it . Every living thing will flee .
CEB	Jeremiah	50	4	In those days and at that time , declares the Lord , the people of Israel and Judah will come out of Babylon [ a ] together ; with weeping they will leave as they seek the Lord their God .
CEB	Jeremiah	50	5	They will search for Zion , turning their faces toward it . They will come [ b ] and unite with the Lord , in an everlasting covenant that will never be forgotten .
CEB	Jeremiah	50	6	My people were lost sheep ; their shepherds led them astray ; they deserted them on the mountains , where they wandered off among the hills , forgetting their resting place .
CEB	Jeremiah	50	7	All who found them devoured them ; and their attackers said , “ It ’ s not our fault , because they have sinned against the Lord , the true pasture , [ c ] the hope of their ancestors—the Lord. ”
CEB	Jeremiah	50	8	Now wander far from Babylon . Get out of that country . Like rams of the flock , lead the way home .
CEB	Jeremiah	50	9	I ’ m stirring up against Babylon a coalition of mighty nations . It will mobilize in the north , and from there she will be captured . Their arrows are like those of an expert archer who does not return empty-handed .
CEB	Jeremiah	50	10	Babylon will be defeated ; its attackers will carry off all that they want , declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	50	11	Sure , you gloat and rejoice , you plunderers of my possession . Sure , you dance around like a calf and neigh like a stallion .
CEB	Jeremiah	50	12	But Mother Babylon [ d ] will be humiliated ; the one who bore you will be disgraced . She will become the least of the nations : a wilderness , a desert , and parched land .
CEB	Jeremiah	50	13	Because of the Lord ’ s anger , no one will live there ; she will be reduced to total ruin . All who pass by Babylon will be shocked ; they will gasp at all her injuries .
CEB	Jeremiah	50	14	Take up your positions around Babylon , all you archers ; now shoot at her ; save none of your arrows , because she ’ s sinned against the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	50	15	Raise a victory shout against her on every side ! She ’ s surrendered ; her towers have collapsed ; her walls are destroyed . This is the Lord ’ s retribution ; now pay her back : do to her what she ’ s done to others !
CEB	Jeremiah	50	16	Cut Babylon off from those who plant and those who harvest the crops , because of its ruthless sword . [ e ] Now return , all of you , to your people ; flee to your homeland !
CEB	Jeremiah	50	17	Israelites are scattered sheep , driven away by lions . First the king of Assyria devoured them , and now Babylon ’ s King Nebuchadnezzar has ravaged them . [ f ]
CEB	Jeremiah	50	18	Therefore , the Lord of heavenly forces , the God of Israel , proclaims : I ’ m going to punish the king of Babylon and his land , just as I punished the king of Assyria .
CEB	Jeremiah	50	19	But I will restore Israel to their pasture ; they will graze on Carmel and Bashan ; they will eat their fill in the highlands of Ephraim and Gilead .
CEB	Jeremiah	50	20	In those days and at that time , declares the Lord , if one searches for the sin of Israel , they will find nothing ; if one seeks out the wrongdoing of Judah , they will look in vain . I will forgive those I have spared .
CEB	Jeremiah	50	21	Attack the land of Merathaim ; [ g ] crush those living in Pekod . Ruin and destroy them , declares the Lord ; do all I have commanded you .
CEB	Jeremiah	50	22	There ’ s the sound of war in the land and enormous devastation .
CEB	Jeremiah	50	23	How the hammer of the whole earth has been broken and shattered into pieces ! How Babylon has become a wasteland among the nations !
CEB	Jeremiah	50	24	You set a trap for others , Babylon , [ h ] but you yourself were caught in it unaware ; you have been found and captured because you have defied the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	50	25	The Lord has opened his arsenal and brought out his brutal weapons . The Lord God of heavenly forces has a job to do in the land of the Babylonians .
CEB	Jeremiah	50	26	Come against her from every side ; throw open her granaries ; pile her up like stalks of grain ; totally destroy her ; leave nothing intact .
CEB	Jeremiah	50	27	Destroy all her bulls ; prepare them for slaughter . How terrible for them ! Their time has come , the day of reckoning .
CEB	Jeremiah	50	28	A voice of fugitives and refugees , from the land of Babylon , declaring in Zion the retribution of the Lord our God because of what has been done to his temple .
CEB	Jeremiah	50	29	Send the archers against Babylon , all who draw the bow ! Surround her and let no one escape . Pay her back for her deeds ; do to her what she ’ s done to others . She has acted arrogantly toward the Lord , the holy one of Israel !
CEB	Jeremiah	50	30	Therefore , her soldiers will fall in the streets ; all her warriors will be silenced on that day , declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	50	31	I ’ m against you , you arrogant one ! declares the Lord God of heavenly forces . Your day has come , your time of reckoning .
CEB	Jeremiah	50	32	The arrogant one will stumble and fall , and no one will help her up . I ’ ll set your cities on fire , and it will consume all that ’ s around her .
CEB	Jeremiah	50	33	The Lord of heavenly forces proclaims : The people of Israel were oppressed , together with the people of Judah . Their captors held them and refused to let them go .
CEB	Jeremiah	50	34	Yet their redeemer is strong ; the Lord of heavenly forces is his name . He will surely defend their cause and give them rest in the land . But he will unsettle the people of Babylon .
CEB	Jeremiah	50	35	A sword against Babylon and its people , declares the Lord , along with its officials and sages .
CEB	Jeremiah	50	36	A sword against its diviners so that they become fools . A sword against its warriors so that they are terrified .
CEB	Jeremiah	50	37	A sword against its horses and chariots , and the mercenaries [ i ] in its midst so that they lose courage . [ j ] A sword against its treasures so that they are looted .
CEB	Jeremiah	50	38	A sword [ k ] against the water supplies so that they dry up . It is truly the land of idols , idols about which they have gone utterly mad !
CEB	Jeremiah	50	39	Therefore , Babylon will become a ghost town , a place for desert animals , hyenas , and ravenous birds . [ l ] No one will live there again ; no one will make it their home .
CEB	Jeremiah	50	40	Just as God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighbors , declares the Lord , so no one will live in Babylon or settle there again .
CEB	Jeremiah	50	41	Look ! An army is on the move from the northern regions . A powerful nation and many kings are coming from the ends of the earth .
CEB	Jeremiah	50	42	Equipped with bow and spear , they are cruel and show no mercy . Their horsemen sound like the roaring sea , arrayed in battle formation against you , Daughter Babylon .
CEB	Jeremiah	50	43	The king of Babylon has heard reports of them and is panic-stricken ; distress overwhelms him , pain like that of a woman in labor .
CEB	Jeremiah	50	44	Like a lion coming up from the jungle of the Jordan to a well-watered meadow , [ m ] so I will suddenly chase down Babylon and single out its choicest of rams . Who is like me ? Who can direct me ? What shepherd can withstand me ?
CEB	Jeremiah	50	45	Therefore , listen to the counsel that the Lord has for Babylon and the plans he ’ s devised against the land of Babylon : The little ones of the flock will be dragged off , as their pasture watches in utter disbelief . [ n ]
CEB	Jeremiah	50	46	The earth quakes at the sound of Babylon ’ s capture ; its screams echo throughout the world .

CEB	Jeremiah	51	51	We ’ re humiliated by their taunts ; we ’ re disgraced that strangers have violated the sacred places of the Lord ’ s temple .
CEB	Jeremiah	51	2	I will send mercenaries [ b ] to Babylon who will sift her and clear out her land . They will surround her on the day of disaster .
CEB	Jeremiah	51	3	Let the archers draw their bows ; let them prepare their armor . Show no mercy to her young men ; wipe out her entire company !
CEB	Jeremiah	51	4	They will fall wounded in the land of Babylon , struck down in her streets .
CEB	Jeremiah	51	5	God , the Lord of heavenly forces , hasn ’ t abandoned Israel and Judah , even though they live in a land filled with guilt before the holy one of Israel .
CEB	Jeremiah	51	6	Escape from Babylon ; each of you run for your lives ! Don ’ t perish because of her guilt , because this is the time for the Lord ’ s retribution , a day of reckoning for all that Babylon [ c ] has done .
CEB	Jeremiah	51	7	Babylon was a gold cup in the Lord ’ s hand ; it made the whole earth drunk . The nations drank her wine and went mad .
CEB	Jeremiah	51	8	But suddenly Babylon fell and shattered into pieces . Wail for her ! Bring medicine for her pain ; perhaps she will recover .
CEB	Jeremiah	51	9	We tried to cure Babylon , but she was beyond help . Let ’ s depart from her and return to your own country , each of you . Her punishment reaches to heaven and extends to the clouds .
CEB	Jeremiah	51	10	The Lord has come to our defense , so let ’ s declare in Zion what the Lord our God has done !
CEB	Jeremiah	51	11	Sharpen your arrows ; prepare your shields . The Lord is stirring up the spirit of kings from Media . He intends to destroy Babylon ; this is the Lord ’ s retribution , a day of reckoning for his temple .
CEB	Jeremiah	51	12	Set up a flag on the walls of Babylon , fortify the guards , post watchmen , prepare an ambush , because the Lord has a plan against the inhabitants of Babylon . He will accomplish it , just as he said he would .
CEB	Jeremiah	51	13	You live beside a great river , and you are rich in treasures . But your time has come ; your cruelty has caught up with you . [ d ]
CEB	Jeremiah	51	14	The Lord of heavenly forces has sworn by his own name : I ’ m going to fill your cities [ e ] with soldiers like a swarm of locusts ; they will celebrate their victory over you .
CEB	Jeremiah	51	15	God made the earth by his might , shaped the world by his wisdom , and crafted the skies by his knowledge .
CEB	Jeremiah	51	16	At the sound of God ’ s voice , the heavenly waters roar . God raises the clouds from the ends of the earth . He makes lightning for the rain and sends the wind from his treasuries .
CEB	Jeremiah	51	17	Everyone is too foolish to understand ; every smith is shamed by his idols , for their images are shams ; they aren ’ t alive .
CEB	Jeremiah	51	18	They are a delusion , a charade ; at the appointed time they will be ruined !
CEB	Jeremiah	51	19	But the portion of Jacob is utterly different , for he has formed all things , including his very own tribe ; the Lord of heavenly forces is his name !
CEB	Jeremiah	51	20	You are my hammer , my weapon of war . With you I will crush the nations . With you I will destroy kingdoms .
CEB	Jeremiah	51	21	With you I will crush horse and rider . With you I will crush chariot and driver .
CEB	Jeremiah	51	22	With you I will crush men and women . With you I will crush old and young . With you I will crush young men and young women .
CEB	Jeremiah	51	23	With you I will crush shepherds and flocks . With you I will crush farmers and oxen . With you I will crush governors and officials .
CEB	Jeremiah	51	24	I will repay Babylon and all its inhabitants for the terrible things they have done to Zion in your sight , declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	51	25	I ’ m against you , you mountain of destruction , declares the Lord , you destroyer of the whole earth ! I will reach out against you ; I will topple you from your heights ; I will turn you into a rubbish heap .
CEB	Jeremiah	51	26	They will never remove a cornerstone or a foundation stone from you . You will be a wasteland forever , declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	51	27	Set up a flag in the land ; sound the alarm among the nations ! Prepare them for war against her ; summon kingdoms against her— Ararat , Minni , and Ashkenaz . Appoint a commander against her ; call up the troops , like swarms of locusts !
CEB	Jeremiah	51	28	Prepare the nations for war against her , the kings of Media , its governors , all its officials , and all the countries they rule .
CEB	Jeremiah	51	29	The earth quakes and trembles because the Lord ’ s plans against Babylon are fulfilled : to reduce Babylon to a wasteland , with no one left in it .
CEB	Jeremiah	51	30	Babylon ’ s warriors quit fighting ; they hide in their fortifications . Their strength is worn out ; their courage is gone ! Babylon ’ s houses are burned down , and its gates are smashed .
CEB	Jeremiah	51	31	Courier joins courier , messenger joins messenger to relate the news to the king of Babylon that his entire city has fallen .
CEB	Jeremiah	51	32	The river crossings are blocked ; the marshes are on fire ; the soldiers are terrified .
CEB	Jeremiah	51	33	The Lord of heavenly forces , the God of Israel , proclaims : Daughter Babylon is like a threshing floor ready to be trampled down . In a little while her harvest will come .
CEB	Jeremiah	51	34	Babylon ’ s King Nebuchadnezzar has eaten us alive ; he ’ s drained us of strength ; he ’ s left us for dead . [ f ] He ’ s gobbled us up like a great sea monster ; he ’ s filled his belly with our treasures ; and he ’ s spit us out .
CEB	Jeremiah	51	35	May Babylon be violated as our bodies were , say the inhabitants of Zion . May our blood be on the Babylonians , say those from Jerusalem .
CEB	Jeremiah	51	36	Therefore , the Lord proclaims : I ’ m going to defend your cause ; I ’ ll turn the tables on your attacker . I ’ ll dry up her sea ; I ’ ll shut up her springs .
CEB	Jeremiah	51	37	Babylon will become a heap of ruins , a den of wild dogs , a wasteland with no one left in it .
CEB	Jeremiah	51	38	Like lions they will roar together ; they will growl like lions ’ cubs .
CEB	Jeremiah	51	39	They are ready to devour , so I ’ ll prepare the feast and mix the drinks ! But after their noisy drunkenness , they will fall fast asleep . They will sleep forever , never to get up , declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	51	40	I ’ ll lead them off like lambs for slaughter , like rams and goats .
CEB	Jeremiah	51	41	How Sheshach [ g ] has been defeated , the pride of the whole earth taken captive ! How Babylon has become a wasteland among the nations !
CEB	Jeremiah	51	42	The sea has risen over Babylon ; its pounding waves overwhelm her .
CEB	Jeremiah	51	43	Her towns are devastated ; her land is scorched and barren , a place where no one lives or dares to pass through .
CEB	Jeremiah	51	44	I will punish Bel in Babylon ; I will force him to vomit what he ’ s consumed . Then nations will no longer stream to him , and Babylon ’ s walls will collapse !
CEB	Jeremiah	51	45	Get out of Babylon , my people ! Run for your lives from the Lord ’ s fierce anger .
CEB	Jeremiah	51	46	Don ’ t be distracted or frightened by the rumors you hear in the land . Sometimes you hear one thing and another time something else : rumors of violence and uprisings .
CEB	Jeremiah	51	47	The time is coming when I will deal with Babylon ’ s idols ; the whole land will be disgraced , and her wounded will fall in her midst .
CEB	Jeremiah	51	48	Then all creation will rejoice over Babylon , because out of the north destroying armies will come to attack her , declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	51	49	Babylon must fall for the dead in Israel , as the dead of all the earth have fallen to Babylon .
CEB	Jeremiah	51	50	You survivors of war , leave now ; don ’ t delay ! Remember the Lord , from a faraway land . Keep Jerusalem alive in your hearts .
CEB	Jeremiah	51	52	The time is coming , declares the Lord , when I will deal with her idols , and the wounded in her land will groan .
CEB	Jeremiah	51	53	Even if Babylon scales the heavens and strengthens its towering defenses , the destroying armies will still come against her , at my command , declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	51	54	Listen to the cries for help from Babylon , signs of massive devastation in the land , declares the Lord .
CEB	Jeremiah	51	55	The Lord is destroying Babylon and silencing her outcry , whose roar is like the crushing waves , a deafening crash .
CEB	Jeremiah	51	56	He certainly comes against her ; the destroyer comes against Babylon . Her warriors are captured ; their bows are broken . The Lord is an exacting God who repays in full .
CEB	Jeremiah	51	57	I ’ ll make her leaders and sages drunk , her governors , officials , and warriors as well . They will sleep forever , never to get up , declares the king , whose name is the Lord of heavenly forces .
CEB	Jeremiah	51	58	The Lord of heavenly forces proclaims : Babylon ’ s massive walls will come down , down to the ground ; and its high gates will be burned to the ground . People labor in vain ; nations toil for nothing but ashes !
CEB	Jeremiah	51	59	This is what the prophet Jeremiah instructed the staff officer [ h ] Seraiah , Neriah ’ s son and Mahseiah ’ s grandson , when Seraiah went to Babylon with Judah ’ s King Zedekiah in the fourth year of his rule .
CEB	Jeremiah	51	60	Jeremiah wrote down in a single scroll all the disasters that would happen to Babylon—all these things concerning Babylon .
CEB	Jeremiah	51	61	Jeremiah said to Seraiah : When you get to Babylon , see to it that you read all these words .
CEB	Jeremiah	51	62	Then say , “ Lord , you declared that this place will be destroyed and nothing will remain in it—neither human nor animal ; that it will forever be a wasteland ! ”
CEB	Jeremiah	51	63	When you finish reading the scroll , tie a stone to it and throw it into the Euphrates River .
CEB	Jeremiah	51	64	Then say , “ In the same way , Babylon will sink and never rise again because of the disaster I ’ m bringing against it. ” Jeremiah ’ s words end here .

CEB	Jeremiah	52	52	Zedekiah was
CEB	Jeremiah	52	21	Each column was about twenty-seven feet high and eighteen feet around . They were hollow , but the bronze was about three inches thick .
CEB	Jeremiah	52	2	He did evil in the Lord ’ s eyes just as Jehoiachin had done .
CEB	Jeremiah	52	3	It was because the Lord was angry against Jerusalem and Judah that he thrust them out of his presence . Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon .
CEB	Jeremiah	52	4	In the ninth year , the tenth month , and the tenth day of the month , Babylon ’ s King Nebuchadnezzar attacked Jerusalem with all of his army . He camped beside the city and built a siege wall around it .
CEB	Jeremiah	52	5	The city was under siege until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah .
CEB	Jeremiah	52	6	On the ninth day of the fourth month , the famine in the city reached a point that no food remained for the people .
CEB	Jeremiah	52	7	The enemy entered the city , and all the soldiers fled by night along the gate between the two walls by the royal gardens . So the Babylonians surrounded the city while the soldiers fled toward the desert plain .
CEB	Jeremiah	52	8	However , the Babylonian army chased down Zedekiah and caught him in the plains of Jericho . ( His entire army had fled from him . )
CEB	Jeremiah	52	9	They arrested the king and brought him before the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath . And he pronounced sentence on him .
CEB	Jeremiah	52	10	The king of Babylon slaughtered Zedekiah ’ s children before his very own eyes , and he slaughtered all Judah ’ s officers at Riblah .
CEB	Jeremiah	52	11	Then he gouged out Zedekiah ’ s eyes and bound him in chains . The king of Babylon dragged him off to Babylon and put him in prison , where he remained until he died .
CEB	Jeremiah	52	12	In the tenth day of the fifth month , which was the nineteenth year of Babylon ’ s King Nebuchadnezzar , Nebuzaradan commander of the guard came to Jerusalem on behalf of his king .
CEB	Jeremiah	52	13	He burned down the Lord ’ s temple , the royal palace , all the houses of Jerusalem , and all the important buildings .
CEB	Jeremiah	52	14	The entire Babylonian army and the commander of the guard destroyed the walls surrounding Jerusalem .
CEB	Jeremiah	52	15	Nebuzaradan commander of the guard deported some of the poorest people , the rest of the people left in the city , a few skilled workers , and those who had joined the king of Babylon .
CEB	Jeremiah	52	16	But Nebuzaradan commander of the guard left some of the poor to tend the vineyards and till the land .
CEB	Jeremiah	52	17	The Babylonians broke apart the bronze columns , the stands , and the bronze Sea in the Lord ’ s temple . They carried the bronze to Babylon .
CEB	Jeremiah	52	18	They took the pots , the shovels , the wick trimmers , the sprinkling bowls , the incense dishes , and all the bronze equipment used for the temple services .
CEB	Jeremiah	52	19	The commander of the guard took whatever gold or silver he could find as well : the small bowls , the fire pans , the sprinkling bowls , the pots , the lampstands , the basins , and the offering bowls .
CEB	Jeremiah	52	20	There was too much bronze to be weighed : two columns , the bronze Sea and the twelve bronze bulls that held it up , and the stands , all of which Solomon had made for the Lord ’ s temple .
CEB	Jeremiah	52	22	Each had a capital of bronze above it that towered seven and a half feet high , and each had an ornate design of bronze pomegranates around it . The second column was the same , also with pomegranates .
CEB	Jeremiah	52	23	There were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides , a total of one hundred pomegranates around the ornate design .
CEB	Jeremiah	52	24	The commander of the guard also took Seraiah the high priest , Zephaniah the deputy priest , and the three doorkeepers .
CEB	Jeremiah	52	25	From the city , he took a eunuch who was appointed over the army and the seven royal advisors who remained in the city . He also took the scribe of the commander of the army in charge of military conscription and sixty military personnel [ a ] who were found in the city .
CEB	Jeremiah	52	26	Nebuzaradan the commander of the guard took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah .
CEB	Jeremiah	52	27	The king of Babylon struck them and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath . And Judah went away from its land into exile .
CEB	Jeremiah	52	28	This is the number of people whom Nebuchadnezzar deported : In the seventh year , 3,023 Judeans .
CEB	Jeremiah	52	29	In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar , he took
CEB	Jeremiah	52	832	people from Jerusalem .
CEB	Jeremiah	52	30	In the twenty-third year of Nebuchadnezzar , he dispatched Nebuzaradan commander of the guard , who deported
CEB	Jeremiah	52	745	Judeans . Altogether , 4,600 were taken captive .
CEB	Jeremiah	52	31	Judah ’ s King Jehoiachin had been in exile for thirty-seven years when Awil-merodach [ b ] became king in Babylon . He took note of Jehoiachin ’ s plight and released him from prison on the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month [ c ] of that very year .
CEB	Jeremiah	52	32	Awil-merodach treated Jehoiachin kindly and gave him a throne higher than those of the other kings with him in Babylon .
CEB	Jeremiah	52	33	So Jehoiachin discarded his prison clothes and ate his meals at the king ’ s table for the rest of his life .
CEB	Jeremiah	52	34	The Babylonian king provided him daily provisions for the rest of his life , right up until he died . Footnotes - Jeremiah 52:25 Or from the people of the land - Jeremiah 52:31 Or Evil-merodach - Jeremiah 52:31 February–March , Adar
CEB	Lamentations	1	1	Oh , no ! She sits alone , the city that was once full of people . Once great among nations , she has become like a widow . Once a queen over provinces , she has become a slave .
CEB	Lamentations	1	2	She weeps bitterly in the night , her tears on her cheek . None of her lovers comfort her . All her friends lied to her ; they have become her enemies .
CEB	Lamentations	1	3	Judah was exiled after suffering and hard service . She lives among the nations ; she finds no rest . All who were chasing her caught her— right in the middle of her distress .
CEB	Lamentations	1	4	Zion ’ s roads are in mourning ; no one comes to the festivals . All her gates are deserted . Her priests are groaning , her young women grieving . She is bitter .
CEB	Lamentations	1	5	Her adversaries have become rulers ; her enemies relax . Certainly the Lord caused her grief because of her many wrong acts . Her children have gone away , captive before the enemy .
CEB	Lamentations	1	6	Daughter Zion lost all her glory . Her officials are like deer that can ’ t find pasture . They have gone away , frail , before the hunter .
CEB	Lamentations	1	7	While suffering and homeless , Jerusalem remembers all her treasures from days long past . When her people fell by the enemy ’ s hand , there was no one to help her . Enemies saw her , laughed at her defeat .
CEB	Lamentations	1	8	Jerusalem has sinned greatly ; therefore , she ’ s become a joke . [ a ] All who honored her now detest her , for they ’ ve seen her naked . Even she groans and turns away .
CEB	Lamentations	1	9	Her uncleanness shows on her clothing ; she didn ’ t consider what would happen to her . She ’ s gone down shockingly ; she has no comforter . “ Lord , look at my suffering—the enemy has definitely triumphed ! ”
CEB	Lamentations	1	10	The enemy grabbed all her treasures . She watched nations enter her sanctuary— nations that you , God , [ b ] commanded : They must not enter your assembly .
CEB	Lamentations	1	11	All her people are groaning , seeking bread . They give up their most precious things for food to survive . “ Lord , look and take notice : I am most certainly despised. ”
CEB	Lamentations	1	12	Is this nothing to all you who pass by ? [ c ] Look around : Is there any suffering like the suffering inflicted on me , the grief that the Lord caused on the day of his fierce anger ?
CEB	Lamentations	1	13	From above he sent fire into my bones ; he trampled them . He spread a net for my feet ; he forced me backward . He left me devastated , constantly sick .
CEB	Lamentations	1	14	My steps [ d ] are being watched ; [ e ] by his hand they are tripped up . His yoke is on my neck ; he makes my strength fail . My Lord has handed me over to people I can ’ t resist .
CEB	Lamentations	1	15	My Lord has despised my mighty warriors . He called a feast for me—in order to crush my young men ! My Lord has stomped on the winepress of the young woman Daughter Judah .
CEB	Lamentations	1	16	Because of all these things I ’ m crying . My eyes , my own eyes pour water because a comforter who might encourage me is nowhere near . My children are destroyed because the enemy was so strong .
CEB	Lamentations	1	17	Zion spreads out her hands ; she has no comforter . The Lord commanded Jacob ’ s enemies to surround him . Jerusalem is just a piece of garbage to them .
CEB	Lamentations	1	18	The Lord is right , because I disobeyed his word . Listen , all you people ; look at my suffering . My young women and young men have gone away as prisoners .
CEB	Lamentations	1	19	I called to my lovers , but they deceived me . My priests and my elders have perished in the city ; they were looking for food to survive .
CEB	Lamentations	1	20	Pay attention , Lord , for I am in trouble . My stomach is churning ; my heart is pounding inside me because I am so bitter . In the streets the sword kills ; in the house it is like death .
CEB	Lamentations	1	21	People heard that I was groaning , that I had no comforter . All my enemies heard about my distress ; they were thrilled that you had done this . Bring the day you have announced so they become like me !
CEB	Lamentations	1	22	Let all their evil come before you . Then injure them like you ’ ve injured me because of all my wrong acts ; my groans are many , my heart is sick .

CEB	Lamentations	2	2	Showing no compassion , my Lord devoured each of Jacob ’ s meadows ; in his wrath he tore down the walled cities of Daughter Judah . The kingdom and its officials , he forced to the ground , shamed .
CEB	Lamentations	2	3	In his burning rage , he cut off each of Israel ’ s horns ; right in front of the enemy , he withdrew his strong hand ; he burned against Jacob like a flaming fire that ate up everything nearby .
CEB	Lamentations	2	4	He bent his bow as an enemy would ; his strong hand was poised like an adversary . He killed every precious thing in sight ; he poured out his wrath like fire on Daughter Zion ’ s tent .
CEB	Lamentations	2	5	My Lord has become like an enemy . He devoured Israel ; he devoured all her palaces ; he made ruins of her city walls . In Daughter Judah he multiplied mourning along with more mourning !
CEB	Lamentations	2	6	He wrecked his own booth like a garden ; he destroyed his place for festivals . The Lord made Zion forget both festival and sabbath ; in his fierce rage , he scorned both monarch and priest .
CEB	Lamentations	2	7	My Lord rejected his altar , he abandoned his sanctuary ; he handed Zion ’ s palace walls over to enemies . They shouted in the Lord ’ s own house as if it were a festival day .
CEB	Lamentations	2	8	The Lord planned to destroy Daughter Zion ’ s wall . He stretched out a measuring line , didn ’ t stop himself from devouring . He made barricades and walls wither—together they wasted away .
CEB	Lamentations	2	9	Zion ’ s gates sank into the ground ; he broke and shattered her bars ; her king and her officials are now among the nations . There is no Instruction ! [ b ] Even her prophets couldn ’ t find a vision from the Lord .
CEB	Lamentations	2	10	Daughter Zion ’ s elders sit on the ground and mourn . They throw dust on their heads ; they put on mourning clothes . Jerusalem ’ s young women bow their heads all the way to the ground .
CEB	Lamentations	2	11	My eyes are worn out from weeping ; my stomach is churning . My insides are poured on the ground because the daughter of my people is shattered , because children and babies are fainting in the city streets .
CEB	Lamentations	2	12	They say to their mothers , “ Where are grain and wine ? ” while fainting like the wounded in the city streets , while their lives are draining away at their own mothers ’ breasts .
CEB	Lamentations	2	13	What can I testify about you , Daughter Jerusalem ? [ c ] To what could I compare you ? With what could I equate you ? How can I comfort you , young woman Daughter Zion ? Your hurt is as vast as the sea . Who can heal you ?
CEB	Lamentations	2	14	Your prophets gave you worthless and empty visions . They didn ’ t reveal your sin so as to prevent your captivity . Instead , they showed you worthless and incorrect prophecies .
CEB	Lamentations	2	15	All who pass by on the road clap their hands about you ; they whistle , shaking their heads at Daughter Jerusalem : “ Could this be the city called Perfect Beauty , the Joy of All the Earth ? ”
CEB	Lamentations	2	16	All your enemies open wide their mouths against you ; they whistle , grinding their teeth . They say , “ We have devoured ! This is definitely the day we ’ ve been waiting for . We ’ ve seen it come to pass. ”
CEB	Lamentations	2	17	The Lord did what he had planned . He accomplished the word that he had commanded long ago . He ripped down , showing no compassion . He made the enemy rejoice over you ; he raised up your adversaries ’ horn .
CEB	Lamentations	2	18	Cry out to my Lord from the heart , [ d ] you wall of Daughter Zion ; make your [ e ] tears run down like a flood all day and night . Don ’ t relax at all ; don ’ t rest your eyes a moment .
CEB	Lamentations	2	19	Get up and cry out at nighttime , at the start of the night shift ; pour out your heart before my Lord like water . Lift your hands up to him for the life of your children— the ones who are fainting from hunger on every street corner .
CEB	Lamentations	2	20	Lord , look and see to whom you have done this ! Should women eat their own offspring , their own beautiful babies ? Should priest and prophet be killed in my Lord ’ s own sanctuary ?
CEB	Lamentations	2	21	Young and old alike lie on the ground in the streets ; my young women and young men fall dead by the sword . On the day of your anger , you killed ; you slaughtered , showing no compassion .
CEB	Lamentations	2	22	You invited—as if to a festival ! —terrors [ f ] from every side . On the day of the Lord ’ s anger , no one escaped , not one survived . The children that I nurtured , that I raised myself , my enemy finished them off .

CEB	Lamentations	4	13	It was because of her prophets ’ sins , her priests ’ iniquities , those who shed righteous blood in the middle of the city .
CEB	Lamentations	4	14	People wandered blindly in the streets , polluted with blood . No one would even touch their clothing .
CEB	Lamentations	4	15	“ Go away ! Unclean ! ” was shouted at them , “ Go away ! Away ! Don ’ t touch ! ” So they fled and wandered around . The nations said , “ They can ’ t stay here anymore. ”

CEB	Lamentations	4	19	Our hunters were faster than airborne eagles . They chased us up the mountains ; they ambushed us in the wilderness .
CEB	Lamentations	4	20	The Lord ’ s chosen one , the very breath in our lungs , was caught in their traps— the one we used to talk about , saying , “ Under his protection we will live among the nations. ”

CEB	Ezekiel	1	1	In the thirtieth year , on the fifth day of the fourth month , I was with the exiles at the Chebar River when the heavens opened and I saw visions of God .
CEB	Ezekiel	1	2	( It happened on the fifth day of the month , in the fifth year after King Jehoiachin ’ s deportation .
CEB	Ezekiel	1	3	The Lord ’ s word burst in on the priest Ezekiel , Buzi ’ s son , in the land of Babylon at the Chebar River . There the Lord ’ s power overcame him . )
CEB	Ezekiel	1	4	As I watched , suddenly a driving storm came out of the north , a great cloud flashing fire , with brightness all around . At its center , in the middle of the fire , there was something like gleaming amber .
CEB	Ezekiel	1	5	And inside that were forms of four living creatures . This was what they looked like : Each had the form of a human being ,
CEB	Ezekiel	1	6	though each had four faces and four wings .
CEB	Ezekiel	1	7	Their feet looked like proper feet , but the soles of their feet were like calves ’ hooves , and they shone like burnished bronze .
CEB	Ezekiel	1	8	Human hands were under their wings on all four sides . All four creatures had faces and wings , and
CEB	Ezekiel	1	9	their wings touched each other ’ s wings . When they moved , they each went straight ahead without turning .
CEB	Ezekiel	1	10	As for the form of their faces : each of the four had a human face , with a lion ’ s face on the right and a bull ’ s face on the left , and also an eagle ’ s face .
CEB	Ezekiel	1	11	The pairs of wings [ a ] that stretched out overhead touched each other , while the other pairs covered their bodies .
CEB	Ezekiel	1	12	Each moved straight ahead wherever the wind propelled them ; they moved without turning .
CEB	Ezekiel	1	13	Regarding the creatures ’ forms : they looked like blazing coals , like torches . Fire darted about between the creatures and illuminated them , and lightning flashed from the fire .
CEB	Ezekiel	1	14	The creatures looked like lightning streaking back and forth .
CEB	Ezekiel	1	15	As I looked at the creatures , suddenly there was a wheel on the earth corresponding to all four faces of the creatures .
CEB	Ezekiel	1	16	The appearance and composition of the wheels were like sparkling topaz . There was one shape for all four of them , as if one wheel were inside another .
CEB	Ezekiel	1	17	When they moved in any of the four directions , they moved without swerving .
CEB	Ezekiel	1	18	Their rims were tall and terrifying , because all four of them were filled with eyes all around .
CEB	Ezekiel	1	19	When the creatures moved , the wheels moved next to them . Whenever the creatures rose above the earth , the wheels also rose up .
CEB	Ezekiel	1	20	Wherever the wind would appear to go , the wind would make them go there too . The wheels rose up beside them , because the spirit [ b ] of the creatures was in the wheels .
CEB	Ezekiel	1	21	When they moved , the wheels [ c ] moved ; when they stood still , the wheels stood still ; and when they rose above the earth , the wheels rose up along with them , because the spirit [ d ] of the creatures was in the wheels .
CEB	Ezekiel	1	22	The shape above the heads of the creatures [ e ] was a dome ; it was like glittering ice stretched out over their heads .
CEB	Ezekiel	1	23	Just below the dome , their outstretched wings touched each other . They each also had two wings to cover their bodies .
CEB	Ezekiel	1	24	Then I heard the sound of their wings when they moved forward . It was like the sound of mighty waters , like the sound of the Almighty , [ f ] like the sound of tumult or the sound of an army camp . When they stood still , their wings came to rest .
CEB	Ezekiel	1	25	Then there was a sound from above the dome over their heads . They stood still , and their wings came to rest .
CEB	Ezekiel	1	26	Above the dome over their heads , there appeared something like lapis lazuli in the form of a throne . Above the form of the throne there was a form that looked like a human being .
CEB	Ezekiel	1	27	Above what looked like his waist , I saw something like gleaming amber , something like fire enclosing it all around . Below what looked like his waist , I saw something that appeared to be fire . Its brightness shone all around .
CEB	Ezekiel	1	28	Just as a rainbow lights up a cloud on a rainy day , so its brightness shone all around . This was how the form of the Lord ’ s glory appeared . When I saw it , I fell on my face . I heard the sound of someone speaking . Footnotes - Ezekiel 1:11 LXX ; MT adds and their faces . - Ezekiel 1:20 Or wind - Ezekiel 1:21 Or they - Ezekiel 1:21 Or wind - Ezekiel 1:22 LXX ; MT creature - Ezekiel 1:24 Heb Shaddai or Mountain One
CEB	Ezekiel	2	2	As he spoke to me , a wind [ a ] came to me and stood me on my feet , and I heard someone addressing me .
CEB	Ezekiel	2	3	He said to me : Human one , I ’ m sending you to the Israelites , a traitorous and rebellious people . They and their ancestors have been rebelling against me to this very day .
CEB	Ezekiel	2	4	I ’ m sending you to their hardheaded and hard-hearted descendants , and you will say to them : The Lord God proclaims .
CEB	Ezekiel	2	5	Whether they listen or whether they refuse , since they are a household of rebels , they will know that a prophet has been among them .
CEB	Ezekiel	2	6	And as for you , human one , don ’ t be afraid of them or their words . Don ’ t be afraid ! You possess thistles and thorns that subdue scorpions . [ b ] Don ’ t be afraid of their words or shrink from their presence , because they are a household of rebels .
CEB	Ezekiel	2	7	You ’ ll speak my words to them whether they listen or whether they refuse . They are just a household [ c ] of rebels !
CEB	Ezekiel	2	8	As for you , human one , listen to what I say to you . Don ’ t become rebellious like that household of rebels . Open your mouth and eat what I give you .
CEB	Ezekiel	2	9	Then I looked , and there in a hand stretched out to me was a scroll .
CEB	Ezekiel	2	10	He spread it open in front of me , and it was filled with writing on both sides , songs of mourning , lamentation , and doom . Footnotes - Ezekiel 2:2 Or spirit - Ezekiel 2:6 Or thistles and thorns are with you , and you sit on scorpions . - Ezekiel 2:7 LXX , Syr , Tg ; MT lacks household .
CEB	Ezekiel	3	3	He said to me : Human one , feed your belly and fill your stomach with this scroll that I give you . So I ate it , and in my mouth it became as sweet as honey .
CEB	Ezekiel	3	2	So I opened my mouth , and he fed me the scroll .
CEB	Ezekiel	3	4	Then he said to me : Human one , go ! Go to the house of Israel and speak my words to them .
CEB	Ezekiel	3	5	You aren ’ t being sent to a people whose language and speech are difficult and obscure but to the house of Israel .
CEB	Ezekiel	3	6	No , not to many peoples who speak difficult and obscure languages , whose words you wouldn ’ t understand . If I did send you to them , they would listen to you .
CEB	Ezekiel	3	7	But the house of Israel—they will refuse to listen to you because they refuse to listen to me . The whole house of Israel is hardheaded and hard-hearted too .
CEB	Ezekiel	3	8	I ’ ve now hardened your face so that you can meet them head-on .
CEB	Ezekiel	3	9	I ’ ve made your forehead like a diamond , harder than stone . Don ’ t be afraid of them or shrink away from them , because they are a household of rebels .
CEB	Ezekiel	3	10	He said to me : Human one , listen closely , and take to heart every word I say to you .
CEB	Ezekiel	3	11	Then go to the exiles , to your people ’ s children . Whether they listen or not , speak to them and say : The Lord God proclaims !
CEB	Ezekiel	3	12	Then a wind lifted me up , and I heard behind me a great quaking sound from his place . Blessed is the Lord ’ s glory !
CEB	Ezekiel	3	13	The sound was the creatures ’ wings beating against each other and the sound of the wheels beside them ; it was a great rumbling noise .
CEB	Ezekiel	3	14	Then the wind picked me up and took me away . With the Lord ’ s power pressing down against me I went away , bitter and deeply angry ,
CEB	Ezekiel	3	15	and I came to the exiles who lived beside the Chebar River at Tel-abib . I stayed there among them for seven desolate days .
CEB	Ezekiel	3	16	At the end of the seven days , the Lord ’ s word came to me :
CEB	Ezekiel	3	17	Human one , I ’ ve made you a lookout for the house of Israel . When you hear a word from me , deliver my warning .
CEB	Ezekiel	3	18	If I declare that the wicked will die but you don ’ t warn them , if you say nothing to warn them from their wicked ways so that they might live , they will die because of their guilt , but I will hold you accountable for their deaths .
CEB	Ezekiel	3	19	If you do warn the wicked and they don ’ t turn from their wickedness or their wicked ways , they will die because of their guilt , but you will save your life .
CEB	Ezekiel	3	20	Or suppose righteous people turn away from doing the right thing . If they act dishonestly , and I make them stumble because of it , they will die because you didn ’ t warn them of their sin . Their righteous deeds won ’ t be remembered , and I will hold you accountable for their deaths .
CEB	Ezekiel	3	21	But if you do warn the righteous not to sin , and they don ’ t sin , they will be declared righteous . Their lives will be preserved because they heeded the warning , and you will save your life .
CEB	Ezekiel	3	22	The Lord ’ s power overcame me , and he said to me : Get up ! Go out to the valley , and I ’ ll speak to you there .
CEB	Ezekiel	3	23	So I got up and went out to the valley . Suddenly , the Lord ’ s glory stood there , like the glory that I had seen at the Chebar River , and I fell on my face .
CEB	Ezekiel	3	24	When a wind came to me and stood me on my feet , he spoke to me and said : Go , shut yourself up inside your house .
CEB	Ezekiel	3	25	Look at you , human one ! They ’ ve now put cords on you and bound you up so that you can ’ t go out among them .
CEB	Ezekiel	3	26	I ’ ll make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth and take away your ability to speak . You won ’ t be able to correct them , because they are a household of rebels .
CEB	Ezekiel	3	27	But whenever I speak to you , I ’ ll open your mouth , and you will say to them : The Lord God proclaims . Those who hear will understand , but those who refuse will not . They are just a household of rebels .
CEB	Ezekiel	4	4	Now , lie on your left side , and set the guilt of the house of Israel on it . For the length of time that you lie on your side , you will bear their punishment .
CEB	Ezekiel	4	2	Prepare the siege : Build a wall , construct ramps , set up army camps , and place battering rams all around .
CEB	Ezekiel	4	3	Take an iron plate and set it up as an iron wall between you and the city . Face it directly . When it is under siege like this , press hard against it . This is a sign for the house of Israel .
CEB	Ezekiel	4	5	I appoint to you three hundred ninety days , one day for each year of their guilt . So you will bear the punishment of the house of Israel .
CEB	Ezekiel	4	6	When you have completed these days , lie on your right side to bear the guilt of the house of Judah . I appoint forty days to you , one day for each year .
CEB	Ezekiel	4	7	With your arm stretched out , face the siege of Jerusalem directly and prophesy against it .
CEB	Ezekiel	4	8	I ’ ve now bound you with cords so that you can ’ t turn from one side to the other until you have completed the days of your siege .
CEB	Ezekiel	4	9	You , gather some wheat and barley , beans and lentils , and millet and spelt . Put them in a bowl and make your bread from them . Eat it during the three hundred ninety days that you lie on your side .
CEB	Ezekiel	4	10	At fixed times you will eat your food by weight , fourteen ounces a day . [ a ]
CEB	Ezekiel	4	11	You will also ration your water by measure , drinking a sixth of a hin [ b ] at fixed times each day .
CEB	Ezekiel	4	12	Eat it like barley bread , and bake it on human excrement while they watch .
CEB	Ezekiel	4	13	The Lord says : In this same way the Israelites will eat their unclean bread among the nations where I am scattering them .
CEB	Ezekiel	4	14	And I said : “ Ah , Lord God ! I ’ ve never been unclean ! From my childhood until now I ’ ve never eaten anything that wasn ’ t properly slaughtered , [ c ] and no unclean meat has ever entered my mouth ! ”
CEB	Ezekiel	4	15	He answered me : “ Then I ’ ll let you use cow dung instead of human excrement . You can make your bread over that. ”
CEB	Ezekiel	4	16	Then he said to me : Human one , I ’ m destroying the food supply in Jerusalem . They will anxiously ration and eat their food , and in dismay they will dole out and drink their water .
CEB	Ezekiel	4	17	When their food and water dwindles away , everyone will be horrified , and they will waste away because of their guilt . Footnotes - Ezekiel 4:10 Or twenty shekels - Ezekiel 4:11 A hin is approximately one gallon . - Ezekiel 4:14 Or what died of itself or was torn by wild beasts
CEB	Ezekiel	5	5	The Lord God proclaims : This is Jerusalem ! I have set her in the middle of the nations and surrounding countries .
CEB	Ezekiel	5	2	At the end of the siege , burn one-third of it in the city . Strike another third with the sword left and right . Then scatter one-third to the wind and let loose [ a ] the sword after it .
CEB	Ezekiel	5	3	From that third , take a few strands and hide them in your garment .
CEB	Ezekiel	5	4	From that hair , take yet another batch and throw it into the fire and burn it up . From there , fire will spread to the whole house of Israel .
CEB	Ezekiel	5	6	But she rebelled against my case laws and my regulations with greater treachery than these nations and surrounding countries , who also rejected my case laws and didn ’ t follow my regulations .
CEB	Ezekiel	5	7	Therefore , the Lord God proclaims : You have become more turbulent than these nations around you because you haven ’ t obeyed my regulations or followed my case laws . You haven ’ t even followed the case laws of the nations around you !
CEB	Ezekiel	5	8	So now the Lord God proclaims : I myself am now against you ! I will impose the case law penalties on you in the sight of the nations .
CEB	Ezekiel	5	9	Because of you , I will do what I ’ ve never done before and will never do again—all because of your detestable practices .
CEB	Ezekiel	5	10	Therefore , parents among you will eat their children , and children will eat their parents . I will impose penalties from case laws on you and scatter all that is left of you to the winds .
CEB	Ezekiel	5	11	Therefore , as surely as I live , this is what the Lord God says : Because you made my sanctuary unclean with all your disgusting practices and detestable things , I myself will shave you . I will not shed a tear . You will have no compassion , even from me .
CEB	Ezekiel	5	12	One-third of you will die of plague and waste away by famine among you . One-third will fall by the sword all around you . And one-third I will scatter to all the winds , letting loose a sword to pursue them .
CEB	Ezekiel	5	13	My anger will be complete . I will exhaust my wrath against them and take my revenge . Then they will know that I , the Lord , have spoken against them in my zeal and consumed them in my wrath .
CEB	Ezekiel	5	14	I will turn you into a desolation to the ridicule of the nations all around you , in the sight of all who pass by .
CEB	Ezekiel	5	15	You will become an object of ridicule , a mockery , and a horrifying lesson to the nations all around you , when I impose penalties from case laws against you in anger , wrath , and overflowing fury . I , the Lord , have spoken .
CEB	Ezekiel	5	16	When I launch my deadly arrows of famine against you , I have released them for your destruction ! I will add to your famine and completely cut off your food supply .
CEB	Ezekiel	5	17	I will send famine and wild animals against you , and they will leave you childless . Plague and bloodshed will come to you , and I will bring the sword against you . I , the Lord , have spoken . Footnotes - Ezekiel 5:2 Or I will let loose
CEB	Ezekiel	6	6	Wherever you live , cities will be in ruins , shrines made desolate , turned into utter ruin . Your altars will be punished and then broken down . Your idols will be demolished , your incense altars shattered , and all your works wiped out .
CEB	Ezekiel	6	2	Human one , face Israel ’ s mountains , and prophesy to them .
CEB	Ezekiel	6	3	Say : Hear the Lord God ’ s word , mountains of Israel ! The Lord God proclaims to the mountains and hills , to the valleys and their deepest ravines : I ’ m about to bring a sword against you and destroy your shrines .
CEB	Ezekiel	6	4	Your altars will be destroyed , your incense altars broken . And I ’ ll make your slain fall in front of your idols .
CEB	Ezekiel	6	5	I ’ ll throw the Israelites ’ corpses in front of their idols , and I ’ ll scatter your bones all around your altars .
CEB	Ezekiel	6	7	The slain will fall among you , and you will know that I am the Lord .
CEB	Ezekiel	6	8	But I will spare a few . Some of you will escape the nations ’ swords when you are scattered throughout the lands .
CEB	Ezekiel	6	9	Your fugitives will remember me in the nations to which they ’ ve been banished , how I was crushed when their roving hearts turned away from me , and their roving eyes went after their idols . They will loathe themselves for their treacherous acts and detestable practices ,
CEB	Ezekiel	6	10	and they will know that I am the Lord . Not in vain have I threatened to bring this evil against them .
CEB	Ezekiel	6	11	The Lord God proclaims : Clap your hands , stamp your feet , and cry “ Horror ” over all the detestable practices of the house of Israel . They will fall by the sword , famine , and plague .
CEB	Ezekiel	6	12	Whoever is far off will die of plague , whoever is nearby will fall to the sword , and whoever finds refuge will die of famine . I ’ ll satisfy my wrath against them !
CEB	Ezekiel	6	13	They will know that I am the Lord when their slain appear among their idols and around their altars , wherever they offered up pleasing aromas for all their idols , on every high hill and mountaintop , and under every lofty tree and leafy oak .
CEB	Ezekiel	6	14	Wherever they live , I will direct my power against them . I will turn the land into a greater wasteland than the Riblah desert . Then they will know that I am the Lord .
CEB	Ezekiel	7	7	You who live on the earth , you are finally caught in your own trap ! The time has come ; the day draws near . On the hills panic , not glory .
CEB	Ezekiel	7	2	You , human one , this is what the Lord God proclaims to the land of Israel : An end ! The end has come to the four corners of the earth !
CEB	Ezekiel	7	3	Even now the end is upon you ! I ’ ll send my anger against you , I ’ ll judge you according to your ways , and I ’ ll turn all your detestable practices against you .
CEB	Ezekiel	7	4	I won ’ t shed a tear for you or show any pity . Instead , I ’ ll turn your ways against you , and your detestable practices will stay with you . Then you will know that I am the Lord .
CEB	Ezekiel	7	5	The Lord God proclaims : Disaster ! A singular disaster ! Look , it comes !
CEB	Ezekiel	7	6	The end has come ! Oh , yes , it has come ! It has come to you ! Look , it ’ s here !
CEB	Ezekiel	7	8	And now it ’ s near ! Against you I will pour out my wrath , and my anger will be satisfied . I ’ ll judge you according to your ways , and turn all your detestable practices against you .
CEB	Ezekiel	7	9	I won ’ t shed a tear or show any pity when I turn your ways against you , and your detestable practices stay with you . Then you will know that I , the Lord , am the one who strikes you !
CEB	Ezekiel	7	10	Look , the day ! Look , it comes ! Doom has arrived ! The staff blossoms , and pride springs up !
CEB	Ezekiel	7	11	Violence rises up as a wicked master . [ a ] It isn ’ t from others or their armies or their violence . It hasn ’ t loomed up because of them .
CEB	Ezekiel	7	12	The time is coming ! The day draws near ! No buyer should rejoice , and no seller should mourn , because wrath overcomes the whole crowd .
CEB	Ezekiel	7	13	The seller will never get back what was sold , even if both of them survive . The vision concerns the whole crowd . It won ’ t be revoked . And the guilty ones— they won ’ t even be able to hang on to their lives .
CEB	Ezekiel	7	14	They have blown the horn , and everything is ready , but no one goes to battle , because my wrath overcomes the whole crowd .
CEB	Ezekiel	7	15	Outside , the sword ! Inside , plague and famine ! Whoever is out in the field will die by the sword . Whoever is in the city , plague and famine will consume them .
CEB	Ezekiel	7	16	And those who flee ? They will turn up on the hills like valley doves , all of them moaning , those guilty ones .
CEB	Ezekiel	7	17	Every hand will hang limp ; urine will run down every leg .
CEB	Ezekiel	7	18	They will put on mourning clothes , and horror will cover them . On every face , shame ; on all their heads , baldness .
CEB	Ezekiel	7	19	They will hurl their silver into the street , and their gold will seem unclean . Their silver and their gold won ’ t deliver them on the day of the Lord ’ s anger . They won ’ t satisfy their appetites or fill their bellies . Their guilt will bring them down .
CEB	Ezekiel	7	20	From their beautiful ornament , in which they took pride , they have made horrible and detestable images ! Therefore , I ’ ve declared it an unclean thing for them .
CEB	Ezekiel	7	21	I ’ ll hand it over to foreigners as loot taken in war , to the earth ’ s wicked ones as plunder—they will defile it !
CEB	Ezekiel	7	22	When I hide my face from my people , foreigners will defile my treasured place . Violent intruders will invade it ; they will defile it !
CEB	Ezekiel	7	23	Make a chain ! The earth is full of perverted justice , the city full of violence .
CEB	Ezekiel	7	24	I ’ ll bring up the cruelest nations , and they will seize their houses . I ’ ll break their proud strength , and their sanctuaries will be defiled .
CEB	Ezekiel	7	25	Disaster ! It has come ! They seek peace , but there is none .
CEB	Ezekiel	7	26	One disaster comes after another , and rumor follows rumor . They seek a vision from the prophet . Instruction disappears from the priest , and counsel from the elders .
CEB	Ezekiel	7	27	The king will go into mourning , the prince will clothe himself in despair , and the hands of the land ’ s people will tremble . When I do to them as they have done and judge them by their own justice , they will know that I am the Lord . Footnotes - Ezekiel 7:11 Or wicked staff
CEB	Ezekiel	8	8	He said to me : Human one , dig through the wall . So I dug through the wall , and I discovered a doorway .
CEB	Ezekiel	8	2	I looked , and there was a form that looked like fire . Below what looked like his waist was fire , but above his waist it looked like gold , like gleaming amber .
CEB	Ezekiel	8	3	He stretched out the form of a hand and picked me up by the hair of my head . A wind lifted me up between earth and heaven , and in a divine vision it brought me to Jerusalem , to the north-facing entrance of the gate to the inner court . That was where the pedestal was for the outrageous image that incites outrage .
CEB	Ezekiel	8	4	There I saw the glory of Israel ’ s God , exactly like what I had seen in the valley .
CEB	Ezekiel	8	5	He said to me : Human one , look toward the north . So I looked north , and there , north of the altar gate , was this outrageous image in the entrance .
CEB	Ezekiel	8	6	He said to me : Human one , do you see what they are doing , the terribly detestable practices that the house of Israel is doing here that drive me far from my sanctuary ? Yet you will see even more detestable practices than these .
CEB	Ezekiel	8	7	Then he brought me to the court entrance . When I looked , I saw a hole in the wall .
CEB	Ezekiel	8	9	And he said to me : Go in and see what wicked and detestable things they are doing in there .
CEB	Ezekiel	8	10	So I went in and looked , and I saw every form of loathsome beasts and creeping things and all the idols of the house of Israel engraved on the walls all around .
CEB	Ezekiel	8	11	The seventy elders of the house of Israel were standing in front of them , and all of them were holding censers in their hands . Jaazaniah , Shaphan ’ s son , was standing right there with them , and the scent of the incense cloud rose up .
CEB	Ezekiel	8	12	He said to me : Human one , do you see what the elders of the house of Israel are doing in the dark , every one of them in their rooms full of sculptured images ? They say , “ The Lord doesn ’ t see us ; the Lord has abandoned the land. ”
CEB	Ezekiel	8	13	He said to me : You will see them performing even more detestable practices .
CEB	Ezekiel	8	14	He brought me to the entrance of the north gate of the temple , where women were sitting and performing the Tammuz lament .
CEB	Ezekiel	8	15	He said to me : Human one , do you see ? Yet you will see even more detestable practices than these .
CEB	Ezekiel	8	16	He brought me to the inner court of the Lord ’ s temple . There , at the entrance to the Lord ’ s temple , between the porch and the altar , were twenty-five men facing toward the east with their backs to the Lord ’ s temple . They were bowing to the sun in the east .
CEB	Ezekiel	8	17	He said to me : Do you see , human one ? Isn ’ t it enough that the house of Judah has observed here all these detestable things ? They have filled the land with violence , and they continue to provoke my fury . Look at them ! They even put the branch to their noses !
CEB	Ezekiel	8	18	I will certainly respond with wrath . I won ’ t spare or pity anyone . Even though they call out loudly to me in my hearing , I won ’ t listen to them .
CEB	Ezekiel	9	9	He said to me : “ Judah and the house of Israel are very , very guilty . The land is filled with blood , and the city is full of injustice . They have said , ‘ The Lord has forsaken the land ; the Lord sees nothing. ’
CEB	Ezekiel	9	2	Suddenly , six men came from the Upper Gate that faces north . All of them were holding weapons of destruction . Among them was another man who was dressed in linen and had a writing case at his side . When they came in and stood beside the bronze altar ,
CEB	Ezekiel	9	3	the glory of Israel ’ s God rose from above the winged creatures [ a ] where he had been and moved toward the temple ’ s threshold . The Lord called to the man who was dressed in linen with the writing case at his side :
CEB	Ezekiel	9	4	Go through the city , through Jerusalem , and mark the foreheads of those who sigh and groan because of all the detestable practices that have been conducted in it .
CEB	Ezekiel	9	5	To the others he said in my hearing : Go through the city after him , and attack . Spare no one ! Be merciless !
CEB	Ezekiel	9	6	Kill them all , old men , young men and women , babies and mothers . Only don ’ t touch anyone who has the mark . Begin at my sanctuary . So they began with the men , the elders in front of the temple .
CEB	Ezekiel	9	7	He said to them : Make the temple unclean ! Fill the courts with the slain ! Go ! And they went out and attacked the city .
CEB	Ezekiel	9	8	While they were attacking , I was left alone . I fell on my face , and I cried out , “ Oh , Lord God ! When you pour out your wrath on Jerusalem , will you destroy all that is left of Israel ? ”
CEB	Ezekiel	9	10	I most definitely won ’ t spare or pity anyone ! I will hold them accountable for their ways. ”
CEB	Ezekiel	9	11	Just then the man who was dressed in linen with the writing case at his side returned and said , “ I ’ ve done just as you commanded. ” Footnotes - Ezekiel 9:3 LXX ; MT creature
CEB	Ezekiel	10	10	It appeared that there was one shape for all four of them , as if one wheel were inside another .
CEB	Ezekiel	10	2	He said to the man clothed in linen : Go in between the wheels under the winged creatures . [ a ] Fill your hands with fiery coals from between the winged creatures , and scatter them over the city . As I watched , he went in .
CEB	Ezekiel	10	3	Now the winged creatures were standing to the right of the temple when the man went in , and the cloud filled the inner courtyard .
CEB	Ezekiel	10	4	Then the Lord ’ s glory rose from above the winged creatures [ b ] and moved toward the temple ’ s threshold . The temple was filled with the cloud , and the courtyard was filled with the brightness of the Lord ’ s glory .
CEB	Ezekiel	10	5	The sound of the winged creatures ’ wings could be heard as far as the outer courtyard . It was like the sound of God Almighty [ c ] when he speaks .
CEB	Ezekiel	10	6	When he instructed the man clothed in linen to take fire from between the winged creatures and their wheels , the man went and stood next to the wheel .
CEB	Ezekiel	10	7	Then one of the winged creatures stretched a hand between the winged creatures into the fire that was between them , and he drew out some of it and set it in the palm of the one clothed in linen . He took it and went out .
CEB	Ezekiel	10	8	It appeared that the winged creatures had the form of a human hand under their wings .
CEB	Ezekiel	10	9	Suddenly , I saw four wheels next to the winged creatures . There was a wheel next to each winged creature , and the appearance of the wheels was like sparkling topaz .
CEB	Ezekiel	10	11	When they moved in any of the four directions , they moved without swerving . Whichever way the leading one faced , they moved in that direction without swerving .
CEB	Ezekiel	10	12	Their whole body—backs , hands , and wings—as well as their wheels , all four of them , were covered with eyes all around .
CEB	Ezekiel	10	13	It was these wheels that were called “ the wheels ” in my hearing .
CEB	Ezekiel	10	14	Each winged creature had four faces . The first face was that of a winged creature , the second face was that of a human being , the third that of a lion , and the fourth that of an eagle .
CEB	Ezekiel	10	15	The winged creatures rose up , the same creatures that I had seen at the Chebar River .
CEB	Ezekiel	10	16	When the winged creatures moved , the wheels moved beside them . When the winged creatures lifted their wings to ascend above the earth , the wheels remained beside them without swerving .
CEB	Ezekiel	10	17	When they stood still , the wheels stood still ; when they rose up , they rose up with them , because the spirit [ d ] of the living creatures was in them .
CEB	Ezekiel	10	18	Then the Lord ’ s glory went out from above the temple ’ s threshold and it stood over the winged creatures .
CEB	Ezekiel	10	19	While I watched , the winged creatures raised their wings and rose from the ground to leave , with their wheels beside them . They stopped at the entrance to the east gate of the temple , and the glory of Israel ’ s God was up above them .
CEB	Ezekiel	10	20	These were the same living creatures that I saw underneath Israel ’ s God at the Chebar River , and I realized that they were winged creatures .
CEB	Ezekiel	10	21	Each had four faces and four wings , with the form of a human hand under their wings .
CEB	Ezekiel	10	22	The forms of their faces were the same faces that I saw at the Chebar River . Their appearance was also the same . All four of them moved straight ahead .

CEB	Ezekiel	11	11	The city won ’ t be your cooking pot , and you won ’ t be the meat in it . At Israel ’ s borders , I will judge you .
CEB	Ezekiel	11	2	He said to me : Human one , these men devise evil plans and give wicked advice in this city .
CEB	Ezekiel	11	3	They are the ones who say , “ The nearest relatives aren ’ t building houses . [ a ] The city is the cooking pot , and we are the meat. ”
CEB	Ezekiel	11	4	Therefore , prophesy against them , human one , prophesy !
CEB	Ezekiel	11	5	The Lord ’ s spirit took hold of me , and he said to me : Say , This is what the Lord God proclaims : So you have said , house of Israel ! But I know what you really mean .
CEB	Ezekiel	11	6	You continue to commit murder in this city , and you fill its streets with the slain .
CEB	Ezekiel	11	7	Therefore , the Lord God proclaims : The city is the cooking pot , and the ones you have slain in it are the meat . But you will be taken out of it .
CEB	Ezekiel	11	8	You fear the sword , so I will bring the sword against you . This is what the Lord God says !
CEB	Ezekiel	11	9	I will lead you out of the city , hand you over to foreigners , and execute judgments against you .
CEB	Ezekiel	11	10	You will fall by the sword ! At Israel ’ s borders I will judge you , and you will know that I am the Lord .
CEB	Ezekiel	11	12	You will know that I am the Lord , whose regulations you didn ’ t observe and whose case laws you didn ’ t follow . Instead , you followed the case laws of the nations around you .
CEB	Ezekiel	11	13	While I was prophesying , Benaiah ’ s son Pelatiah dropped dead . I fell on my face , and I wailed and said , “ Oh , Lord God ! Are you finishing off even the Israelites who are left ? ”
CEB	Ezekiel	11	14	The Lord ’ s word came to me :
CEB	Ezekiel	11	15	Human one , when the people living in Jerusalem said , “ They ’ ve gone far from the Lord , and we ’ ve been given the land as an inheritance , ” they were talking about your family , your nearest relatives , the whole house of Israel , all of it .
CEB	Ezekiel	11	16	Therefore , say , The Lord God proclaims : Even though I made them go far away among the nations and caused them to scatter throughout the earth , I ’ ve provided some sanctuary for them in the countries to which they ’ ve gone .
CEB	Ezekiel	11	17	Therefore , say , The Lord God proclaims : I will gather you from the nations , assemble you from the countries where you were scattered , and I will give you Israel ’ s fertile land .
CEB	Ezekiel	11	18	They will enter the land , and they will remove from it all its disgusting and detestable things .
CEB	Ezekiel	11	19	I will give them a single heart , and I will put a new spirit in them . I will remove the stony hearts from their bodies and give them hearts of flesh
CEB	Ezekiel	11	20	so that they may follow my regulations and carefully observe my case laws . They will be my people , and I will be their God .
CEB	Ezekiel	11	21	As for those whose hearts continue to go after their disgusting and detestable things , I will hold them accountable for their ways . This is what the Lord God says !
CEB	Ezekiel	11	22	Then the winged creatures raised their wings . The wheels were next to them , and the glory of Israel ’ s God was above them .
CEB	Ezekiel	11	23	The Lord ’ s glory ascended from the middle of the city , and it stopped at the mountain east of the city .
CEB	Ezekiel	11	24	And a wind lifted me up and brought me to the exiles in Chaldea , through a vision with a divine wind . [ b ] When the vision I had seen left me ,
CEB	Ezekiel	11	25	I spoke to the exiles about everything the Lord had shown to me . Footnotes - Ezekiel 11:3 Or it is not time to build houses - Ezekiel 11:24 Or spirit
CEB	Ezekiel	12	12	Their prince will shoulder his backpack at night and go out . They will dig through the wall to lead him out through it , and he will cover his face so that his eyes won ’ t see the land .
CEB	Ezekiel	12	2	Human one , you live in a household of rebels . They have eyes to see but they don ’ t see , ears to hear but they don ’ t hear , because they are a household of rebels .
CEB	Ezekiel	12	3	But you , human one , prepare a backpack for going into exile . In the daytime while they watch , go into exile ; while they watch , go out from your place to another . Even though they are a household of rebels , perhaps they will understand .
CEB	Ezekiel	12	4	In the daytime while they watch , carry your backpack as if for exile . At twilight while they watch , go out like those who are led out to exile .
CEB	Ezekiel	12	5	While they watch , dig a hole through the wall and take your backpack out through it .
CEB	Ezekiel	12	6	While they watch , shoulder your backpack and carry it out in the dark . Cover your face so that you can ’ t see the land , because I ’ m making you a sign for the house of Israel .
CEB	Ezekiel	12	7	So I did as I was commanded . I carried out my backpack like an exile ’ s backpack in the daytime . At night I dug a hole through the wall with my hands . In the darkness , I shouldered my backpack and carried it out while they watched .
CEB	Ezekiel	12	8	In the morning , the Lord ’ s word came to me :
CEB	Ezekiel	12	9	Human one , has the house of Israel , that household of rebels , asked you , “ What are you doing ? ”
CEB	Ezekiel	12	10	Say to them , The Lord God proclaims : This concerns the prince in Jerusalem , along with the entire house of Israel in it . [ a ]
CEB	Ezekiel	12	11	Say : I ’ m your sign . Just as I have done , so it will be done to them . They will go into captivity in exile .
CEB	Ezekiel	12	13	But I will spread my net over him , catch him in my trap , and bring him to Babylon , to the land of the Chaldeans . He won ’ t see it , but he will die there .
CEB	Ezekiel	12	14	As for all those who are in league with him , I will scatter his helpers and all his troops to the winds and let the sword loose after them .
CEB	Ezekiel	12	15	They will know that I am the Lord when I disperse them among the nations and scatter them throughout the lands .
CEB	Ezekiel	12	16	But I will preserve a few of their number from the sword , famine , and plague , so that they may confess all their detestable practices among the nations where they go . Then they will know that I am the Lord .
CEB	Ezekiel	12	17	The Lord ’ s word came to me :
CEB	Ezekiel	12	18	Human one , eat your bread in trembling , and drink your water in anxious agitation .
CEB	Ezekiel	12	19	Say to the land ’ s people , The Lord God proclaims to those living in Jerusalem regarding Israel ’ s fertile land : As they anxiously eat up their bread and drink up their water in dismay , the land will be emptied of everything in it because of the violence of all who live there .
CEB	Ezekiel	12	20	The inhabited cities will be laid waste , the land left desolate , and you will know that I am the Lord . Fulfillment of prophecy
CEB	Ezekiel	12	21	The Lord ’ s word came to me :
CEB	Ezekiel	12	22	Human one , what is this proverb of your people concerning Israel ’ s fertile land ? They say , “ The days go by , and every vision vanishes. ”
CEB	Ezekiel	12	23	Therefore , say to them , The Lord God proclaims : I ’ ll put an end to this proverb ! It will never again be uttered in Israel . Tell them instead : The days are coming soon for the fulfillment of every vision .
CEB	Ezekiel	12	24	Never again will there be any worthless vision or deceptive divination in the house of Israel .
CEB	Ezekiel	12	25	I am the Lord ! The word that I speak is the word that I will speak ! It will happen and be delayed no longer . In your own days , household of rebels , I speak a word and make it happen . This is what the Lord God says !
CEB	Ezekiel	12	26	The Lord ’ s word came to me :
CEB	Ezekiel	12	27	Human one , the house of Israel is now saying , “ The vision that he sees is for distant days ; he prophesies about future times. ”
CEB	Ezekiel	12	28	Therefore , say to them , The Lord God proclaims : It will be delayed no longer . Every word of mine that I ’ ve spoken is certain , and it will happen . This is what the Lord God says . Footnotes - Ezekiel 12:10 Or them
CEB	Ezekiel	13	13	Therefore , the Lord God proclaims : In my fury I will make a storm wind break out , and in my anger there will be flooding rains and hailstones in consuming wrath .
CEB	Ezekiel	13	2	Human one , prophesy to Israel ’ s prophets who prophesy from their own imaginations . Say , Hear the Lord ’ s word !
CEB	Ezekiel	13	3	The Lord God proclaims : Doom to the foolish prophets who follow their own whims but see nothing .
CEB	Ezekiel	13	4	Israel , your prophets have been like jackals among ruins .
CEB	Ezekiel	13	5	You haven ’ t gone up into the breach or reinforced the wall of the house of Israel , so that it might withstand the battle on the day of the Lord .
CEB	Ezekiel	13	6	They saw worthless visions and performed deceptive divinations . Even though the Lord didn ’ t send them , they said , “ This is what the Lord says ” and expected their word to stand .
CEB	Ezekiel	13	7	Didn ’ t you see worthless visions ? And didn ’ t you report deceptive divinations and say , “ This is what the Lord says , ” even though I didn ’ t speak ?
CEB	Ezekiel	13	8	Therefore , the Lord God proclaims : Because you spoke worthless things and had false visions , I ’ m against you . This is what the Lord God says !
CEB	Ezekiel	13	9	I ’ ll wield my power against the prophets , those seers of nothingness and diviners of lies . They won ’ t be included in my people ’ s council , or recorded in the house of Israel ’ s official records , or enter Israel ’ s fertile land . Then you will know that I am the Lord .
CEB	Ezekiel	13	10	Without a doubt , they led my people astray , saying “ Peace ” when there was no peace , and “ He is building a wall ” when they were the ones who laid on the plaster .
CEB	Ezekiel	13	11	Say to those who laid on the plaster that it will fall . When the flooding rains appear and I send hailstones , it will collapse , and the storm winds will break it apart .
CEB	Ezekiel	13	12	The wall will certainly fall . Won ’ t it be said about you , “ Where is your plaster now ? ”
CEB	Ezekiel	13	14	I will tear down the wall on which you laid plaster . I will raze it to the ground and expose its foundation . When it falls , you will be destroyed with it , and you will know that I am the Lord .
CEB	Ezekiel	13	15	I will exhaust my fury on the wall and on those who laid plaster on it . Then I will say to you , “ Where is the wall ? ” [ a ] and “ Where are those who plastered it ,
CEB	Ezekiel	13	16	those prophets of Israel who prophesied to Jerusalem and envisioned peace when there was no peace ? ” This is what the Lord God says !
CEB	Ezekiel	13	17	You , human one , face the daughters of your people , those women who prophesy from their imaginations . Prophesy against them
CEB	Ezekiel	13	18	and say , The Lord God proclaims : Doom to the women who sew bands on every wrist and make veils for heads of all sizes to entrap human lives . Will you ensnare my people ’ s lives but preserve your own ?
CEB	Ezekiel	13	19	When you degrade me to my people for handfuls of barley and bread crumbs , you mislead my gullible people , and you bring about the death of those who shouldn ’ t die and keep alive those who shouldn ’ t live .
CEB	Ezekiel	13	20	Therefore , the Lord God proclaims : I ’ m against the bands that you use to trap human lives . [ b ] I will tear them from your arms , and I will set free the lives that you ’ ve trapped like birds .
CEB	Ezekiel	13	21	I will tear off your veils and snatch my people out of your clutches . They will be prey in your clutches no longer . Then you will know that I am the Lord .
CEB	Ezekiel	13	22	You hurt the righteous with slander—I didn ’ t wound them ! —and you strengthened the hands of the wicked so that they survived without changing their evil ways !
CEB	Ezekiel	13	23	Therefore , you will no longer see empty visions or perform divinations . I will rescue my people from your clutches , and you will know that I am the Lord . Footnotes - Ezekiel 13:15 Syr , cf 13:12 ; MT There is no wall . - Ezekiel 13:20 LXX ; MT adds like birds .
CEB	Ezekiel	14	14	If these three men , Noah , Daniel , and Job , lived there , their lives alone would be saved because they were righteous . This is what the Lord God says .
CEB	Ezekiel	14	2	the Lord ’ s word came to me :
CEB	Ezekiel	14	3	Human one , these men decide on their own to set up their idols , so the cause of their downfall is right in front of them . Why should I allow them to ask me anything ?
CEB	Ezekiel	14	4	Therefore , speak to them and tell them , The Lord God proclaims : If anyone from the house of Israel decides on his own to set up his idols and puts the cause of his downfall right in front of him , but then comes to the prophet , I , the Lord , will require an answer from him through his many idols .
CEB	Ezekiel	14	5	So I ’ ll seize the hearts of the house of Israel , whose idols have made them all strangers to me .
CEB	Ezekiel	14	6	Therefore , say to the house of Israel , The Lord God proclaims : Come back ! Turn away from your idols and from all your detestable practices . Turn away !
CEB	Ezekiel	14	7	Or anyone of the house of Israel or any immigrant in Israel who becomes estranged from me by deciding on their own to set up their idols and puts the cause of their downfall right in front of them , but then comes to the prophet to ask me something through him , I , the Lord , will require an answer .
CEB	Ezekiel	14	8	I will confront that one . I will set them up as a sign and an object lesson , and I will cut them off from my people . Then you will know that I am the Lord .
CEB	Ezekiel	14	9	As for the prophet who was seduced into speaking a word , even though it was I , the Lord , who seduced that prophet , I will use my power against him and cut him off completely from my people Israel .
CEB	Ezekiel	14	10	The prophet and the inquirer alike will bear their guilt ,
CEB	Ezekiel	14	11	so that the house of Israel won ’ t stray away from me again or make themselves impure with any of their sins . They will be my people , and I will be their God . This is what the Lord God says ! Failed request
CEB	Ezekiel	14	12	The Lord ’ s word came to me :
CEB	Ezekiel	14	13	Human one , suppose a land sins against me by acting faithlessly , so that I use my power against it , break off its food supply , let famine run rampant , and eliminate both humans and animals .
CEB	Ezekiel	14	15	Or suppose I allow wild animals to roam through the land , and it becomes so wild that no one can live there or even travel through it on account of the wild animals .
CEB	Ezekiel	14	16	If these three men lived there , as surely as I live , proclaims the Lord God , they wouldn ’ t be able to rescue even their sons or daughters . They alone would be rescued , but the land would become a ruin .
CEB	Ezekiel	14	17	Or suppose I bring a sword against that land and command the sword to pass through and eliminate both humans and animals .
CEB	Ezekiel	14	18	If these three men lived there , as surely as I live , proclaims the Lord God , they wouldn ’ t be able to rescue even their sons or daughters . They alone would be rescued .
CEB	Ezekiel	14	19	Or suppose I send a plague against that land and pour out my fury on it . With great bloodshed I would eliminate both humans and animals .
CEB	Ezekiel	14	20	If Noah , Daniel , and Job lived there , as surely as I live , proclaims the Lord God , they wouldn ’ t be able to rescue either sons or daughters . But they would save their lives because they were righteous .
CEB	Ezekiel	14	21	The Lord God proclaims : How much more if I send all four of these terrible acts of judgment—sword , famine , wild animals , and plague—against Jerusalem , to eliminate both humans and animals ?
CEB	Ezekiel	14	22	Yet a few survivors will be left . Sons and daughters will be brought out to you . When you see their ways and their deeds , you will be consoled for the evil that I inflicted on Jerusalem , for all that I brought against it .
CEB	Ezekiel	14	23	Seeing their ways and their deeds will bring you some consolation , because then you will understand what I ’ ve done , and that I didn ’ t do any of these things without cause . This is what the Lord God says .
CEB	Ezekiel	15	15	The Lord ’ s word came to me :
CEB	Ezekiel	15	2	Human one , how is the vine ’ s wood better than the wood of all the trees in the forest ?
CEB	Ezekiel	15	3	Can you make anything useful from its wood ? Can you make a peg from it and hang objects on it ?
CEB	Ezekiel	15	4	If not , can it be used as firewood ? Fire would consume its two ends , but its middle part would only get charred . So is it useful for anything ?
CEB	Ezekiel	15	5	Look , even when it was whole , it was worthless . Now that the fire has consumed it , and it is charred , it ’ s even more useless .
CEB	Ezekiel	15	6	Therefore , the Lord God proclaims : Of all the trees in the forest , I have decreed that the vine ’ s wood is destined to be consumed by fire . So also have I decreed for those who live in Jerusalem ,
CEB	Ezekiel	15	7	and I have confronted them . They may try to go out from the fire , but the fire will consume them . You will know that I am the Lord , because I confronted them .
CEB	Ezekiel	15	8	I will turn the land into a ruin because they acted faithlessly , proclaims the Lord God .
CEB	Ezekiel	16	16	You took some of your clothing to make colorful shrines and prostituted yourself in them .
CEB	Ezekiel	16	2	Human one , show Jerusalem her detestable practices .
CEB	Ezekiel	16	3	Say , The Lord God proclaims to Jerusalem : By origin and birth you are from the land of Canaan . Your father was an Amorite , your mother a Hittite .
CEB	Ezekiel	16	4	This is how you were treated on the day you were born : Your umbilical cord wasn ’ t cut , you weren ’ t washed clean with water or rubbed with salt , and you weren ’ t wrapped in blankets .
CEB	Ezekiel	16	5	No one took pity or cared enough to do any of these things for you . You were despised on the day of your birth and thrown out on the open field .
CEB	Ezekiel	16	6	When I happened to come by , I saw you flailing about in your blood . I said to you while you were still bloody , “ Live ! ”
CEB	Ezekiel	16	7	I helped you to flourish like a young plant in the field , and you grew tall and became wonderfully endowed . Your breasts were firm , your hair beautifully thick . And you were completely naked .
CEB	Ezekiel	16	8	When I passed by you , I realized that you were ready for love . So I spread my cloak over you and covered your nakedness . I made a solemn promise and entered into a covenant with you , and you became mine . This is what the Lord God says .
CEB	Ezekiel	16	9	Then I washed you with water , rinsed off your blood , and poured oil on you .
CEB	Ezekiel	16	10	I clothed you with colorful garments , put fine sandals on you , wrapped your head in linen , and covered you with jewels .
CEB	Ezekiel	16	11	I adorned you with fine jewelry , and put bracelets on your wrists and a necklace around your neck .
CEB	Ezekiel	16	12	I put a ring in your nose , earrings in your ears , and a beautiful crown on your head .
CEB	Ezekiel	16	13	I adorned you with gold and silver , and your garments were made of the finest linen and brocade . You ate the finest flour , honey , and oil . You became very beautiful , fit for royalty .
CEB	Ezekiel	16	14	Among the nations you were famous for your beauty . It was perfect because of the splendor that I had given you . This is what the Lord God says .
CEB	Ezekiel	16	15	But you trusted in your beauty and traded on your fame . At every opportunity , you seduced all who came by .
CEB	Ezekiel	16	17	You took the beautiful gold and silver jewelry that I had given to you , and you made male images for yourself and prostituted yourself with them .
CEB	Ezekiel	16	18	You took your fine garments and clothed them . You set my oil and incense before them .
CEB	Ezekiel	16	19	You set my food that I had given you to eat—fine wheat , oil , and honey—before them as a pleasing aroma . This is what the Lord God says .
CEB	Ezekiel	16	20	You took your sons and daughters , which you had borne to me , and you sacrificed these to them so they could consume them . Was this promiscuity of yours a small thing ?
CEB	Ezekiel	16	21	You slaughtered my sons and placed them in the fire for them !
CEB	Ezekiel	16	22	In all your detestable practices and promiscuities , you didn ’ t remember the days of your infancy when you lay completely naked , flailing about in your blood .
CEB	Ezekiel	16	23	After all your wickedness—doom , doom to you , proclaims the Lord God—
CEB	Ezekiel	16	24	you built a pavilion for yourself and set up platforms in every square .
CEB	Ezekiel	16	25	At every crossroad you built your platform and degraded your beauty by spreading your legs to all comers . And so you encouraged even more promiscuity .
CEB	Ezekiel	16	26	You prostituted yourself with the Egyptians , your neighbors with the large sexual organs , and as you added to your seductions , you provoked me to anger .
CEB	Ezekiel	16	27	So I used my power against you , cut off your allowance , and gave you up to the passions of the Philistine women who had been confounded by your infamous ways and had rejected you .
CEB	Ezekiel	16	28	Still not satisfied , you prostituted yourself to the Assyrians , but they weren ’ t enough for you either .
CEB	Ezekiel	16	29	So you prostituted yourself with the Babylonians , the land of traders , but again you weren ’ t satisfied .
CEB	Ezekiel	16	30	How sick was your heart—the Lord God proclaims—that you could do all these things , the deeds of a hardened prostitute .
CEB	Ezekiel	16	31	But you weren ’ t like an ordinary prostitute ! When you built your pavilion at the head of every street and made your platform in every square , you refused to be paid .
CEB	Ezekiel	16	32	You are like an adulterous wife : you take in strangers instead of your husband .
CEB	Ezekiel	16	33	Ordinary prostitutes are given gifts , but you gave your gifts to all your lovers . From every direction you even bribed them to come to you for your sexual favors .
CEB	Ezekiel	16	34	As a prostitute , you were more perverse than other women . No one approached you for sexual favors , but you yourself gave gifts instead of receiving them . You are perversion itself !
CEB	Ezekiel	16	35	Therefore , you prostitute , hear the Lord ’ s word !
CEB	Ezekiel	16	36	The Lord God proclaims : You were in a constant state of arousal [ a ] and exposed yourself when you acted like a prostitute with your lovers and with the idols to which you gave your children ’ s blood .
CEB	Ezekiel	16	37	Therefore , I will now gather all of your lovers whom you pleased , the ones you loved and the ones you rejected . I will gather them against you from all around , and I will expose you to them . They will see it all .
CEB	Ezekiel	16	38	I will convict you of adultery and murder , and I will hand you over in bloody fury and zeal .
CEB	Ezekiel	16	39	I will hand you over to them , and they will tear down your pavilion and destroy your platforms . They will strip you of your garments , take your beautiful jewels , and they will leave you completely naked .
CEB	Ezekiel	16	40	They will bring an army against you , pelt you with stones , and slaughter you with their swords .
CEB	Ezekiel	16	41	They will burn down your houses and execute judgments against you in the sight of many women . I will bring an end to your prostitution ; indeed , you will never again give payment .
CEB	Ezekiel	16	42	When I ’ ve satisfied my anger , and my rage has turned away from you , I will be calm and no longer angry .
CEB	Ezekiel	16	43	Because you didn ’ t remember your youthful days , and infuriated me with all these things , I will hold you accountable for what you ’ ve done . This is what the Lord God says . Have you not added bad reputation to all your detestable acts ?
CEB	Ezekiel	16	44	Now everyone who speaks in proverbs will say this about you : “ Like mother , like daughter. ”
CEB	Ezekiel	16	45	You are your mother ’ s daughter ! She loathed her husband and also her children . You are just like your sisters too ! They also loathed their husbands and children . Your mother was a Hittite , and your father was an Amorite .
CEB	Ezekiel	16	46	Your older sister is Samaria , who lives with her daughters in the north . Your younger sister is Sodom , who lives with her daughters in the south .
CEB	Ezekiel	16	47	You didn ’ t follow in their ways or engage in their detestable practices in any small way . You were far more destructive .
CEB	Ezekiel	16	48	As surely as I live , says the Lord God , not even your sister Sodom and her daughters did what you and your daughters have done !
CEB	Ezekiel	16	49	This is the sin of your sister Sodom : She and her daughters were proud , had plenty to eat , and enjoyed peace and prosperity ; but she didn ’ t help the poor and the needy .
CEB	Ezekiel	16	50	They became haughty and did detestable things in front of me , and I turned away from them as soon as I saw it .
CEB	Ezekiel	16	51	Samaria didn ’ t sin even half as much as you did . You ’ ve so outstripped her in multiplying your detestable practices , with all the detestable things you ’ ve done , that you ’ ve even made your sisters seem innocent .
CEB	Ezekiel	16	52	Bear your disgrace , which has actually improved your sisters ’ position . Because your sins and detestable acts were greater than theirs , they are now more righteous than you . Be ashamed , and bear the disgrace of making your sisters righteous !
CEB	Ezekiel	16	53	I will improve the circumstances of Sodom and her daughters and the circumstances of Samaria and her daughters . And what ’ s left of your fortune will go to them ,
CEB	Ezekiel	16	54	so that you will bear your disgrace and be humiliated by all that you ’ ve done to make them feel better .
CEB	Ezekiel	16	55	Then your sister Sodom and her daughters will return to their former state , and your sister Samaria and her daughters will return to their former state . You and your daughters will return to your former state ,
CEB	Ezekiel	16	56	but you will no longer talk about your sister Sodom as in your haughty days
CEB	Ezekiel	16	57	before your wickedness was exposed . You are now the reproach of all the daughters of Edom [ b ] and all those around her , including the daughters of the Philistines . They mock you on every side .
CEB	Ezekiel	16	58	You alone must bear your bad reputation and your detestable ways . This is what the Lord says .
CEB	Ezekiel	16	59	The Lord God proclaims : I will do to you just as you have done , despising solemn pledges and breaking covenants .
CEB	Ezekiel	16	60	Nevertheless , I will remember my covenant with you when you were young , and I will establish an everlasting covenant with you .
CEB	Ezekiel	16	61	And you will remember your ways and be ashamed , when in spite of your covenant I [ c ] take your big sisters and little sisters from you and give them back to you as daughters .
CEB	Ezekiel	16	62	I myself will establish my covenant with you , and you will know that I am the Lord .
CEB	Ezekiel	16	63	Then you will remember and be ashamed , and you won ’ t even open your mouth because of your shame , after I ’ ve forgiven you for all that you ’ ve done . This is what the Lord God says . Footnotes - Ezekiel 16:36 Heb uncertain - Ezekiel 16:57 Syr ; MT Aram - Ezekiel 16:61 LXX ; MT you
CEB	Ezekiel	17	17	Pharaoh won ’ t help him . There will be no strong force or mighty army in battle when siege ramps are set up and towers are built to eliminate many lives .
CEB	Ezekiel	17	2	Human one , compose a riddle and a parable about the house of Israel .
CEB	Ezekiel	17	3	Say , The Lord God proclaims : The great eagle with great wings , long feathers , and full , colorful plumage came to Lebanon and took the top branch of the cedar .
CEB	Ezekiel	17	4	He plucked a twig from the cedar ’ s crown , brought it to the land of traders , and set it down in a city of merchants .
CEB	Ezekiel	17	5	He took a native seed and planted it in a prepared field , placing it like a willow beside plentiful water .
CEB	Ezekiel	17	6	It grew and became a low-spreading vine . Its foliage turned toward him , and its roots developed under him . And so it became a vine , and it produced branches and sent out its shoots .
CEB	Ezekiel	17	7	Now there was another great eagle with great wings and much plumage . This vine bent its roots and turned its branches toward him so that it might draw more water from him than from its own bed ,
CEB	Ezekiel	17	8	a good field with plentiful water where it was planted to grow branches , bear fruit , and become a splendid vine .
CEB	Ezekiel	17	9	Say , The Lord God proclaims : Will it thrive ? Won ’ t he tear out its roots , strip its fruit , and cause all the leaves of its branches to wither ? It will dry up , and no one will need a strong arm or a mighty army to uproot it .
CEB	Ezekiel	17	10	Though it is planted , will it thrive ? When the east wind touches it , won ’ t it completely wither ? On the bed in which it was planted , it will wither away .
CEB	Ezekiel	17	11	The Lord ’ s word came to me :
CEB	Ezekiel	17	12	Say now to the rebellious household : Don ’ t you know what these things mean ? Say : The king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and carried its king and its officers away with him to Babylon .
CEB	Ezekiel	17	13	Then he took a prince from the royal line , made an agreement with him , and made him take a solemn pledge of loyalty . He also took away the land ’ s officials .
CEB	Ezekiel	17	14	Thus it would be a lowly kingdom , not asserting its own interests but observing the agreement so that it would survive .
CEB	Ezekiel	17	15	But the prince rebelled against him and sent messengers to Egypt to supply him with horses and a great army . Can such a person succeed ? Can one who does these things escape ? Can he overturn the agreement and escape capture ?
CEB	Ezekiel	17	16	As surely as I live , says the Lord God , he will die in Babylon , in the place of the king who gave him the authority to rule , whose solemn pledge he scorned and whose agreement he overturned .
CEB	Ezekiel	17	18	He scorned the solemn pledge and overturned the agreement ! Even though he made a promise , he did all these things , and he won ’ t escape capture .
CEB	Ezekiel	17	19	So now the Lord God proclaims : As surely as I live , it was my solemn pledge that he scorned and my agreement that he overturned , and I will hold him accountable .
CEB	Ezekiel	17	20	I will spread my net over him , and he will be caught in my trap . I will bring him to Babylon , and I myself will enter into judgment with him there for rebelling against me .
CEB	Ezekiel	17	21	All his elite fighters [ a ] along with all his troops will fall by the sword , and those who are left will be scattered to the winds . Then you will know that I , the Lord , have spoken .
CEB	Ezekiel	17	22	The Lord God proclaims : I myself will take one of the top branches from the tall cedar . I will pluck a tender shoot from its crown , and I myself will plant it on a very high and lofty mountain .
CEB	Ezekiel	17	23	On Israel ’ s mountainous highlands I will plant it , and it will send out branches and bear fruit . It will grow into a mighty cedar . Birds of every kind will nest in it and find shelter in the shade of its boughs .
CEB	Ezekiel	17	24	Then all the trees in the countryside will know that I , the Lord , bring down the tall tree and raise up the lowly tree , and make the green tree wither and the dry tree bloom . I , the Lord , have spoken , and I will do it . Footnotes - Ezekiel 17:21 LXX , Syr , Tg ; MT his fugitives
CEB	Ezekiel	18	18	As for his father : If he exploited the weak or committed robbery , or did anything else that wasn ’ t good for the people , he will die because of his own guilt .
CEB	Ezekiel	18	2	What do you mean by this proverb of yours about the land of Israel : “ When parents eat unripe grapes , the children ’ s teeth suffer ” ?
CEB	Ezekiel	18	3	As surely as I live , says the Lord God , no longer will you use this proverb in Israel !
CEB	Ezekiel	18	4	All lives are mine ; the life of the parent and the life of the child belong to me . Only the one who sins will die .
CEB	Ezekiel	18	5	People are declared innocent when they act justly and responsibly .
CEB	Ezekiel	18	6	They don ’ t eat on the hills or give their attention to the idols of the house of Israel . They don ’ t defile the wives of their neighbors or approach menstruating women .
CEB	Ezekiel	18	7	They don ’ t cheat anyone , but fulfill their obligations . They don ’ t rob others , but give food to the hungry and clothes to the naked .
CEB	Ezekiel	18	8	They don ’ t impose interest or take profit . They refrain from evil and settle cases between people fairly .
CEB	Ezekiel	18	9	They follow my regulations , keep my case laws , and act faithfully . Such people are innocent , and they will live , proclaims the Lord God .
CEB	Ezekiel	18	10	But suppose one of them has a violent child who sheds blood or does any one of these things ,
CEB	Ezekiel	18	11	even though his parents didn ’ t do any of them . He eats on the mountains , defiles his neighbor ’ s wife ,
CEB	Ezekiel	18	12	oppresses the poor and needy , robs others and doesn ’ t fulfill his obligations , pays attention to the idols and does detestable things ,
CEB	Ezekiel	18	13	and takes interest and profit . Should he live ? He should not . He engaged in all these detestable practices . He will surely die , and his blood will be on him .
CEB	Ezekiel	18	14	But suppose he has a child who sees all the sins that his father committed . He becomes alarmed and doesn ’ t do them .
CEB	Ezekiel	18	15	He doesn ’ t eat on the mountains or pay attention to the idols of the house of Israel . He doesn ’ t defile his neighbor ’ s wife .
CEB	Ezekiel	18	16	He doesn ’ t cheat anyone , either by seizing collateral for loans or committing robbery . He gives his food to the hungry and clothes to the naked .
CEB	Ezekiel	18	17	He refrains from oppressing the poor by taking neither interest nor profit . He observes my case laws and follows my regulations . He won ’ t die because of his father ’ s guilt . He will surely live .
CEB	Ezekiel	18	19	You will say , “ Why doesn ’ t the child bear his parent ’ s guilt ? ” The child has acted justly and responsibly . The child kept all my regulations and observed them . The child will surely live .
CEB	Ezekiel	18	20	Only the one who sins will die . A child won ’ t bear a parent ’ s guilt , and a parent won ’ t bear a child ’ s guilt . Those who do right will be declared innocent , and the wicked will be declared guilty .
CEB	Ezekiel	18	21	But if the wicked turn away from all the sins that they have committed , keep all my regulations , and act justly and responsibly , they will surely live and not die .
CEB	Ezekiel	18	22	None of the sins that they committed will be held against them , but they will live because they do the right things .
CEB	Ezekiel	18	23	Do I take pleasure in the death of the wicked ? says the Lord God . Certainly not ! If they change their ways , they will live .
CEB	Ezekiel	18	24	If those who do the right thing turn from righteousness and engage in the same detestable practices that the wicked committed , can they do these things and live ? None of their righteous deeds will be remembered . They will die because of their treacheries and sins .
CEB	Ezekiel	18	25	But you say , “ My Lord ’ s way doesn ’ t measure up. ” Listen , house of Israel , is it my ways that don ’ t measure up ? Isn ’ t it your ways that don ’ t measure up ?
CEB	Ezekiel	18	26	When those who do the right thing turn from their responsible ways and act maliciously , they will die because of it . For their malicious acts they will die .
CEB	Ezekiel	18	27	And when the wicked turn from their wicked deeds and act justly and responsibly , they will preserve their lives .
CEB	Ezekiel	18	28	When they become alarmed and turn away from all their sins , they will surely live ; they won ’ t die .
CEB	Ezekiel	18	29	Yet the house of Israel says , “ My Lord ’ s way doesn ’ t measure up. ” Is it my ways that don ’ t measure up ? Isn ’ t it your ways that don ’ t measure up , house of Israel ?
CEB	Ezekiel	18	30	Therefore , I will judge each of you according to your ways , house of Israel . This is what the Lord God says . Turn , turn away from all your sins . Don ’ t let them be sinful obstacles for you .
CEB	Ezekiel	18	31	Abandon all of your repeated sins . Make yourselves a new heart and a new spirit . Why should you die , house of Israel ?
CEB	Ezekiel	18	32	I most certainly don ’ t want anyone to die ! This is what the Lord God says . Change your ways , and live !
CEB	Ezekiel	19	19	You , raise a lament for Israel ’ s princes .
CEB	Ezekiel	19	2	Say : What a lioness among lionesses was your mother ! She bedded down among the strong young lions and reared her cubs .
CEB	Ezekiel	19	3	She singled out one of her cubs and he became a strong young lion ; he learned to tear flesh and devour humans .
CEB	Ezekiel	19	4	When the nations heard about him , they caught him in their trap and carried him with hooks to the land of Egypt .
CEB	Ezekiel	19	5	When she realized that she waited in vain , her hope faded . So she took another of her cubs and set him up as a strong young lion .
CEB	Ezekiel	19	6	He went on the prowl with the other lions and became a strong young lion . He learned to tear flesh and devour humans ;
CEB	Ezekiel	19	7	he ravaged [ a ] their widows and laid waste to their cities . When the earth and everything in it became horrified by the sound of his raging ,
CEB	Ezekiel	19	8	the nations from the surrounding regions allied against him . They cast their nets over him and caught him in their trap .
CEB	Ezekiel	19	9	They put a collar on him and brought him with hooks . They brought him with nets to the king of Babylon so that his voice would no longer be heard on the mountains of Israel . The proud mother
CEB	Ezekiel	19	10	Your mother was like a vine in a vineyard [ b ] planted beside the waters ; she bore lush fruit and foliage because of the plentiful water ,
CEB	Ezekiel	19	11	and she produced mighty branches , fit for rulers ’ scepters . She grew tall , and her crown went up between the clouds . Because of her height and thick growth , she became conspicuous .
CEB	Ezekiel	19	12	So she was struck down in anger , thrown down to the ground . The east wind dried her out and destroyed her fruit ; it sapped the branch of its strength , and fire consumed it .
CEB	Ezekiel	19	13	So now she is planted in the desert , in a parched and thirsty land ,
CEB	Ezekiel	19	14	and fire has gone out from her branch and consumed her foliage and fruit , leaving her no strong branch or ruler ’ s scepter . This is a lamentation , and it will serve as a lamentation . Footnotes - Ezekiel 19:7 Or knew - Ezekiel 19:10 Or in your blood
CEB	Ezekiel	20	20	Make my sabbaths holy , and let them be a sign between us that I am the Lord your God .
CEB	Ezekiel	20	2	the Lord ’ s word came to me :
CEB	Ezekiel	20	3	Human one , speak to Israel ’ s elders and say to them , The Lord God proclaims : Have you come to petition me ? As surely as I live , I reject your petitions . This is what the Lord God says !
CEB	Ezekiel	20	4	Will you judge them , human one , will you judge them ? Then expose to them the detestable practices of their ancestors .
CEB	Ezekiel	20	5	Say to them , The Lord God proclaims : On the day I chose Israel , I swore a solemn pledge to the descendants of Jacob ’ s household . When I made myself known to them in the land of Egypt , I swore a solemn pledge : I am the Lord your God .
CEB	Ezekiel	20	6	On that day I swore that I would lead them out of the land of Egypt to a land that I would show them , a land full of milk and honey , the most splendid of all lands .
CEB	Ezekiel	20	7	And I said to them , Every one of you must cast away your disgusting things . Don ’ t let yourselves be defiled by Egypt ’ s idols . I am the Lord your God .
CEB	Ezekiel	20	8	But they rebelled against me and refused to listen to me . No one cast off their disgusting things or abandoned their Egyptian idols . So I declared that I would pour out my wrath on them and satisfy my anger against them in the land of Egypt .
CEB	Ezekiel	20	9	But I acted for my name ’ s sake , so that it wouldn ’ t be degraded in the sight of the nations among whom they lived , and in whose sight I made it known that I would lead them out of the land of Egypt .
CEB	Ezekiel	20	10	So I led them out of the land of Egypt and brought them into the desert .
CEB	Ezekiel	20	11	I gave them my regulations and made known to them my case laws , which bring life to all who observe them .
CEB	Ezekiel	20	12	I also gave them my sabbaths as a sign between us that I , the Lord , have set them apart for my purpose . [ a ]
CEB	Ezekiel	20	13	But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the desert . They didn ’ t follow my regulations and rejected my case laws , which bring life to all who observe them . They completely degraded my sabbaths . So I declared that I would pour out my anger against them and destroy them in the desert .
CEB	Ezekiel	20	14	But instead , I acted for the sake of my name so that it wouldn ’ t be degraded in the sight of the nations who saw me lead them out of Egypt .
CEB	Ezekiel	20	15	So in the desert I swore another solemn pledge , that I wouldn ’ t bring them to the land that I had given to them , a land full of milk and honey , a land more splendid than any other ,
CEB	Ezekiel	20	16	because they rejected my case laws , didn ’ t follow my regulations , and degraded my sabbaths . They had their hearts set on their idols .
CEB	Ezekiel	20	17	But I had too much compassion to destroy them , so I didn ’ t put an end to them in the desert .
CEB	Ezekiel	20	18	In the desert , I said to their children , Don ’ t follow your parents ’ regulations or observe their case laws or become defiled by their idols .
CEB	Ezekiel	20	19	I am the Lord your God ! Follow my regulations ! Observe my case laws and do them !
CEB	Ezekiel	20	21	But the children rebelled against me . They didn ’ t follow my regulations or observe my case laws , which bring life to all who observe them . They also degraded my sabbaths . So I declared that I would pour out my wrath on them and satisfy my anger against them in the desert .
CEB	Ezekiel	20	22	But I restrained myself and acted for the sake of my name so that it wouldn ’ t be diminished in the sight of the nations who saw me lead them out of Egypt .
CEB	Ezekiel	20	23	And I swore yet another solemn pledge in the desert , that I would disperse them among the nations and scatter them throughout the earth ,
CEB	Ezekiel	20	24	because they didn ’ t observe my case laws , they rejected my regulations , and they degraded my sabbaths while they kept looking to their parents ’ idols .
CEB	Ezekiel	20	25	I also issued regulations that were not good and case laws by which they could not live .
CEB	Ezekiel	20	26	I defiled them with their very gifts when they offered up all their oldest children . They were supposed to be so horrified that they would acknowledge that I am the Lord .
CEB	Ezekiel	20	27	Therefore , human one , speak to the house of Israel and say to them , The Lord God proclaims : Yet again your ancestors defamed me by rebelling against me !
CEB	Ezekiel	20	28	I brought them into the land that I swore to give to them . But when they saw all the high hills and lofty trees , there they made their sacrifices : irksome offerings here , pleasing aromas there , and drink offerings elsewhere !
CEB	Ezekiel	20	29	I said to them , What shrine are you going to now ? So it ’ s called Shrine [ b ] to this very day .
CEB	Ezekiel	20	30	So now say to the house of Israel , The Lord God proclaims : Will you defile yourselves as your ancestors did , and will you prostitute yourself after their disgusting things ?
CEB	Ezekiel	20	31	When you offer up your gifts and make your children pass through the fire , you defile yourselves with all your idols to this very day . Should I let you seek me out , house of Israel ? This is what the Lord God says : As surely as I live , I won ’ t let you seek me .
CEB	Ezekiel	20	32	What is in your minds will never happen ! You ’ ve been saying , “ Let ’ s be like the nations and the clans of the lands in the service of wood and stone. ”
CEB	Ezekiel	20	33	This is what the Lord God says : As surely as I live , with a strong hand , an outstretched arm , and with wrath poured out , I will be your king !
CEB	Ezekiel	20	34	I will lead you out from the peoples and gather you from the countries where you ’ ve been scattered—yes , with a strong hand and an outstretched arm and with wrath poured out !
CEB	Ezekiel	20	35	I will march you out to the wilderness nations , and there I will judge you face-to-face .
CEB	Ezekiel	20	36	Just as I judged your ancestors in the desert of the land of Egypt , so will I judge you . This is what the Lord God says .
CEB	Ezekiel	20	37	I will make you walk under the rod , and I will bring you into the covenant bond .
CEB	Ezekiel	20	38	I will remove from among you those who rebel and transgress against me . I will lead them out from the land where they lived as immigrants , but they won ’ t enter Israel ’ s fertile land . Then you will know that I am the Lord .
CEB	Ezekiel	20	39	But to you , house of Israel , the Lord God proclaims : Go ahead and serve your idols , all of you ! But afterward , if any of you are left to listen to me , [ c ] you will no longer make my holy name impure with your gifts or your idols !
CEB	Ezekiel	20	40	On my holy mountain , on the high mountain in Israel , the whole house of Israel will serve me there—every one of them in the land ! This is what the Lord God says . There I will accept them , and there I will ask for their offerings , their finest gifts , and all their holy things .
CEB	Ezekiel	20	41	When I bring you out from the nations and gather you from the countries where you are scattered , I will accept you as a pleasing aroma . Through you I will be made holy in the sight of the nations .
CEB	Ezekiel	20	42	Then you will know that I am the Lord , when I bring you to Israel ’ s fertile land , to the land that I swore to give to your ancestors .
CEB	Ezekiel	20	43	There you will remember how your ways and all your wicked deeds defiled you , and you will loathe yourselves for all the wicked things that you ’ ve done .
CEB	Ezekiel	20	44	Then , house of Israel , you will know that I am the Lord , when I deal with you for the sake of my name and not according to your wicked ways and ruinous deeds . This is what the Lord God says . Fire in the southern plain
CEB	Ezekiel	20	45	[ d ] The Lord ’ s word came to me :
CEB	Ezekiel	20	46	Human one , face Teman , preach against the south , and prophesy against the thicket in the arid southern plain .
CEB	Ezekiel	20	47	Say to the thicket in the arid southern plain : Hear the Lord God ’ s word . This is what the Lord God says : I ’ m about to set a fire in you , and it will consume every green and every dry tree in you . Its blazing flame won ’ t be put out , and everything from south to north will be scorched .
CEB	Ezekiel	20	48	Everyone will see that I , the Lord , have set it on fire . It won ’ t be quenched .
CEB	Ezekiel	20	49	Then I said , “ Oh , Lord God ! They say about me , ‘ Isn ’ t he one for making metaphors ? ’ ” Footnotes - Ezekiel 20:12 Or to make them holy - Ezekiel 20:29 Heb sounds like Where are you going ? - Ezekiel 20:39 Heb uncertain - Ezekiel 20:45 21:1 in Heb
CEB	Ezekiel	21	21	The king of Babylon stands at the fork in the road where the two roads begin and performs his divinations . He shakes the arrows , consults the divine images , and inspects the liver .
CEB	Ezekiel	21	2	Human one , face Jerusalem , preach against their sanctuary , and prophesy against Israel ’ s fertile land .
CEB	Ezekiel	21	3	Say to Israel ’ s fertile land , The Lord proclaims : I ’ m now against you ! I will draw my sword from its sheath and cut off both the righteous and the wicked from you .
CEB	Ezekiel	21	4	In order to cut off the righteous and wicked from you , my sword will go out from its sheath against everyone from south to north .
CEB	Ezekiel	21	5	And everyone will know that I , the Lord , have taken my sword out of its sheath . It won ’ t be put away again .
CEB	Ezekiel	21	6	You , human one , groan in their sight ; groan bitterly with trembling knees .
CEB	Ezekiel	21	7	If they ask you why you ’ re groaning , say to them , “ Because of the news. ” When it comes , every heart will despair , every hand will hang lifeless , every spirit will be listless , and urine will run down every leg . It ’ s coming ! It will happen ! This is what the Lord God says . The sword dance
CEB	Ezekiel	21	8	The Lord ’ s word came to me :
CEB	Ezekiel	21	9	Human one , prophesy ! Say , The Lord proclaims ! Say : A sword ! A sharp and polished sword !
CEB	Ezekiel	21	10	For utter slaughter it is sharpened , polished to flash like lightning . Let ’ s not rejoice , because no one will escape the purge . [ b ]
CEB	Ezekiel	21	11	He appoints it for polishing , to seize in the hand . The sword is sharpened , it is polished ; it is ready for the destroyer ’ s hand .
CEB	Ezekiel	21	12	Human one , cry aloud , and wail , for it comes against my people , against all of Israel ’ s princes , handed over to the sword along with my people . Therefore , strike your thigh .
CEB	Ezekiel	21	13	He ’ s testing . When even the rod rejects , will it not certainly happen ? [ c ] This is what the Lord God says .
CEB	Ezekiel	21	14	And you , human one , prophesy ! Strike hand to hand . Let the sword strike twice , three times ! It ’ s a deadly sword , a great deadly sword . It whirls around them
CEB	Ezekiel	21	15	to make hearts shudder , to make many stumble and fall . I ’ ve set the slaughtering sword against all their gates . Oh ! It ’ s crafted to flash like lightning , polished for slaughter !
CEB	Ezekiel	21	16	Stab again and again ! Plunge right , plunge left , wherever your edge goes .
CEB	Ezekiel	21	17	It is I who strike hand to hand ! I ’ ll satisfy my wrath ! I , the Lord , have spoken . Guilt remembered
CEB	Ezekiel	21	18	The Lord ’ s word came to me :
CEB	Ezekiel	21	19	You , human one , mark two roads for the coming of the sword of the king of Babylon . They should diverge from a single country . Where the road to the city begins , set up a sign ,
CEB	Ezekiel	21	20	and point out the way for the sword to come : “ To Rabbah of the Ammonites ” or “ To Judah in its stronghold Jerusalem. ”
CEB	Ezekiel	21	22	On his right side appeared the omen for Jerusalem : to put battering rams in place , to proclaim war and raise the alarm , to place battering rams against the gates , and to set up siege ramps and build towers .
CEB	Ezekiel	21	23	It seems to them like a lying divination , because solemn pledges had been sworn to them . But he will remind them of their guilt , and they will be captured .
CEB	Ezekiel	21	24	So the Lord God proclaims : Now that you have remembered your guilt and your treacheries are exposed , your sins can be seen in everything you do . Because you have brought your guilt to light , you will be captured !
CEB	Ezekiel	21	25	But you vile , wicked prince of Israel whose day has come , the time of final punishment ,
CEB	Ezekiel	21	26	this is what the Lord God says : Remove the turban , take off the crown ! Nothing will be as it was . Bring down the exalted , and exalt the lowly .
CEB	Ezekiel	21	27	A ruin , ruin , ruin , I ’ ll make it ! Such a thing has never happened ! Even before the rightful judge comes , I ’ ve handed it over to him . Avenging Ammon ’ s disgrace
CEB	Ezekiel	21	28	You , human one , prophesy and say , The Lord God proclaims to the Ammonites concerning their disgrace . Say , Sword ! Sword unsheathed for slaughter , burnished , battle-ready , [ d ] flashing like lightning :
CEB	Ezekiel	21	29	False visions and lying divinations set you against the necks of vile , wicked men whose day had come , the time of final punishment .
CEB	Ezekiel	21	30	Return it to its sheath . In the place where you were created , in the land of your origin , I will judge you .
CEB	Ezekiel	21	31	I will pour out my wrath against you . With a raging fire I will blow against you , and I will hand you over to those who burn and forge destruction .
CEB	Ezekiel	21	32	Fire will consume you , your blood will sink into the earth , and you will no longer be remembered . I , the Lord , have spoken . Footnotes - Ezekiel 21:1 21:6 in Heb - Ezekiel 21:10 Heb uncertain - Ezekiel 21:13 Heb uncertain - Ezekiel 21:28 Or to take in the hand
CEB	Ezekiel	22	22	As silver is melted in a furnace , so you will be melted in it . You will know that I , the Lord , have poured out my rage on you .
CEB	Ezekiel	22	2	You , human one , will you judge ? Will you judge the bloody city ? Then explain all her detestable practices to her .
CEB	Ezekiel	22	3	Say , The Lord God proclaims : City , self-destructive blood-letter , self-defiling idol maker :
CEB	Ezekiel	22	4	All the blood that you ’ ve shed is your punishment , and all the idols that you ’ ve made are your defilement . This is how you ’ ve shortened your days and hastened the end [ a ] of your years ! For this reason I ’ ve given you over to the ridicule of nations and the derision of every land .
CEB	Ezekiel	22	5	Those from near and far will mock your infamous name and great chaos .
CEB	Ezekiel	22	6	Look , Israel ’ s princes , every one of them , have joined forces to shed blood in you .
CEB	Ezekiel	22	7	In you they treat father and mother with contempt . In you they oppress immigrants and deny the rights of orphans and widows .
CEB	Ezekiel	22	8	You despise my holy things and degrade my sabbaths .
CEB	Ezekiel	22	9	In you slanderers show up to shed blood . In you they eat on the mountains . In you they do obscene things .
CEB	Ezekiel	22	10	In you a father ’ s nakedness is uncovered . In you menstruating women are violated .
CEB	Ezekiel	22	11	Every man engages in detestable practices with his neighbor ’ s wife , every man defiles his daughter-in-law with obscene acts , and every man violates his sister , his own father ’ s daughter .
CEB	Ezekiel	22	12	In you they take bribes to shed blood . You collect interest and fees , you profit by extorting your neighbor , and you neglect even me ! This is what the Lord God says .
CEB	Ezekiel	22	13	I now strike my hands over your ill-gotten gain and blood that ’ s been shed in you .
CEB	Ezekiel	22	14	Will your strength and courage endure when I deal with you ? I am the Lord : I speak , and I act !
CEB	Ezekiel	22	15	I will scatter you among the nations and disperse you throughout the lands , and so I will remove your uncleanness from you .
CEB	Ezekiel	22	16	When you are degraded [ b ] like this in the sight of the nations , then you will know that I am the Lord .
CEB	Ezekiel	22	17	The Lord ’ s word came to me :
CEB	Ezekiel	22	18	Human one , the house of Israel has become a waste product for me . They are all copper , tin , iron , and lead . In the furnace , they ’ ve become the waste product of silver .
CEB	Ezekiel	22	19	So this is what the Lord God says : Because you ’ ve all become a waste product , I ’ m now gathering you into the middle of Jerusalem .
CEB	Ezekiel	22	20	Just as silver , copper , iron , lead , and tin are collected and placed in a furnace to fan the flames under them and melt them down , so in my anger and rage I will collect you , put you in , and melt you down .
CEB	Ezekiel	22	21	I will gather you , fan the flames of my wrath under you , and melt you down in the middle of it .
CEB	Ezekiel	22	23	The Lord ’ s word came to me :
CEB	Ezekiel	22	24	Human one , say to her , You are an unclean land without rain on the day of reckoning .
CEB	Ezekiel	22	25	The conspiracy of princes [ c ] in her is like a roaring lion ripping up prey . They ’ ve piled up wealth and precious goods and made many widows in her .
CEB	Ezekiel	22	26	Her priests have done violence to my instructions and made my holy things impure . They have not clearly separated the holy from the ordinary , and they have not taught the difference between unclean and clean things . They ’ ve disregarded my sabbaths . So I ’ ve been degraded among them .
CEB	Ezekiel	22	27	The officials in her are like wolves ripping up prey . They shed blood and destroy lives for unjust riches .
CEB	Ezekiel	22	28	Her prophets have whitewashed everything for them , seeing false visions and making wrong predictions for them , saying , “ This is what the Lord God says , ” when the Lord hasn ’ t spoken .
CEB	Ezekiel	22	29	The important people of the land have practiced extortion and have committed robbery . They ’ ve oppressed the poor and mistreated the immigrant . They ’ ve oppressed and denied justice .
CEB	Ezekiel	22	30	I looked for anyone to repair the wall and stand in the gap for me on behalf of the land , so I wouldn ’ t have to destroy it . But I couldn ’ t find anyone .
CEB	Ezekiel	22	31	So I ’ ve poured out my anger on them . With my furious fire I ’ ve finished them off . I ’ ve held them accountable . This is what the Lord God proclaims . Footnotes - Ezekiel 22:4 LXX , Syr ; Vulg time ; MT until - Ezekiel 22:16 MT adds in you . - Ezekiel 22:25 LXX ; MT prophets
CEB	Ezekiel	23	23	Babylonians and all the Chaldeans , Pekod and Shoa and Koa , all the Assyrians with them , the most handsome young men , all of them governors and officers , career officers and conscripts , all of them on horseback .
CEB	Ezekiel	23	2	Human one , there were two women , daughters of one woman .
CEB	Ezekiel	23	3	When they were girls in Egypt , they began to prostitute themselves by allowing their young and nubile breasts to be touched and fondled .
CEB	Ezekiel	23	4	The older sister was named Oholah , and the younger sister was named Oholibah . They became mine and gave birth to sons and daughters . Now Oholah is Samaria , and Oholibah is Jerusalem .
CEB	Ezekiel	23	5	But Oholah became unfaithful to me and lusted after her lovers the Assyrians :
CEB	Ezekiel	23	6	warriors dressed in fine blue cloth , governors and officers , charioteers and horsemen , all of them the most handsome of men .
CEB	Ezekiel	23	7	She sought them out to seduce them , all of them men of the highest rank of Assyria . She defiled herself by everyone she lusted after and also by all their idols .
CEB	Ezekiel	23	8	But she never gave up her promiscuities with the Egyptians , who had slept with her in her girlhood and fondled her nubile breasts , and who continued to seduce her .
CEB	Ezekiel	23	9	Therefore , I handed her over to her lovers , to the Assyrians for whom she lusted .
CEB	Ezekiel	23	10	They stripped her naked , took her sons and daughters , and killed her with the sword . And she became notorious among women for the punishments they enacted against her .
CEB	Ezekiel	23	11	Her sister Oholibah saw it , and she proceeded to outdo her sister in her lust and in her seductions .
CEB	Ezekiel	23	12	She lusted after the Assyrians , governors and officers , warriors richly clothed , charioteers and horsemen , all of them the most handsome of men .
CEB	Ezekiel	23	13	I saw that she too defiled herself . Both had the same tendencies ,
CEB	Ezekiel	23	14	but she was even more promiscuous . She saw men carved in wall reliefs , images of Chaldeans outlined in vermilion ,
CEB	Ezekiel	23	15	wearing only loincloths around their hips and flowing headbands on their heads . All of them had the appearance of warriors of the third rank , the likeness of Babylonians whose native land is Chaldea .
CEB	Ezekiel	23	16	Aroused just by looking at them , she sent messengers to them in Chaldea .
CEB	Ezekiel	23	17	The Babylonians came to her to lie down and make love with her , defiling her with their seductions . But once she had defiled herself with them , she recoiled from them in disgust .
CEB	Ezekiel	23	18	When her seductions became known and her nakedness exposed , I recoiled from her just as I had recoiled from her sister .
CEB	Ezekiel	23	19	But she added to her promiscuities , bringing to mind her youthful days when she was a prostitute in the land of Egypt .
CEB	Ezekiel	23	20	She lusted after their male consorts , whose sexual organs were like those of donkeys , and whose ejaculation was like that of horses .
CEB	Ezekiel	23	21	She relived the wicked days of her youth , when the Egyptians touched and fondled her young and nubile breasts .
CEB	Ezekiel	23	22	So Oholibah , the Lord God proclaims : I ’ m now inciting your lovers against you , all those from whom you recoiled , and I will bring them against you from all around—
CEB	Ezekiel	23	24	They will come against you with weapons , [ a ] chariots , and wagons , and with a great army , with shield , buckler , and helmet ; and they will surround you . I will hand your punishment over to them , and they will judge you according to their laws .
CEB	Ezekiel	23	25	I will direct my passion against you , and they will deal with you in wrath . They will cut off your nose and ears , and those who are left will fall by the sword . They will seize your sons and daughters , and those who are left will be burned with fire .
CEB	Ezekiel	23	26	They will strip your clothing from you and remove your beautiful crown .
CEB	Ezekiel	23	27	That ’ s how I will put an end to your lewdness and your Egyptian-styled promiscuity . Never again will you stare at them , and you won ’ t remember Egypt anymore .
CEB	Ezekiel	23	28	The Lord God proclaims : I ’ m now handing you over to those whom you hate and from whom you recoil .
CEB	Ezekiel	23	29	They will deal hatefully with you : They will seize your pay and leave you completely naked . Your promiscuity , betrayal , and seductions will be exposed .
CEB	Ezekiel	23	30	This will be done to you because you sold yourself to the nations and became defiled by their idols .
CEB	Ezekiel	23	31	You followed in your sister ’ s path , so I have put her cup into your hand .
CEB	Ezekiel	23	32	The Lord God proclaims : Deep and wide is your sister ’ s cup . Drink ! Appointed for abuse and scorn , it overflows .
CEB	Ezekiel	23	33	You will be filled with drunken sadness . A cup of devastation and dismay is the cup of your sister Samaria .
CEB	Ezekiel	23	34	Drink it , drain it dry , break it into pieces , and tear off your breasts , for I have spoken . This is what the Lord God says .
CEB	Ezekiel	23	35	So now the Lord God proclaims : Because you forgot me and turned your back on me , you alone will bear the consequences of your betrayal and promiscuities .
CEB	Ezekiel	23	36	Then the Lord said to me , Human one , judge Oholah and Oholibah , and make known their detestable practices to them .
CEB	Ezekiel	23	37	They committed adultery , so now blood is on their hands . They committed adultery with their idols , and they even took their children whom they had borne to me and offered them up to be consumed for them .
CEB	Ezekiel	23	38	They also did this to me : On the same day , they made my sanctuary unclean and made my sabbaths impure .
CEB	Ezekiel	23	39	When they slaughtered their children for their idols , they came into my sanctuary and made it impure on that very same day . They actually did this inside my temple .
CEB	Ezekiel	23	40	They even sent for men who came from a great distance . No sooner than a messenger was sent , they arrived ! For these men you bathed , you painted your eyes , and you put on your jewelry .
CEB	Ezekiel	23	41	You took your place on a splendid couch with a richly set table in front of it , and you set my incense and my oil on it .
CEB	Ezekiel	23	42	The sound of a noisy crowd was around her . Men from the common multitude , drinkers of wine , were brought from the desert . They put bracelets on their wrists and beautiful crowns on their heads .
CEB	Ezekiel	23	43	Then I thought , For a foolish woman they become adulterers ! Incited by her seduction , they prostitute themselves—for her ! [ b ]
CEB	Ezekiel	23	44	They come as if coming to a prostitute , first to Oholah , and then to Oholibah , those traitorous women .
CEB	Ezekiel	23	45	But men who do the right thing will judge them , and they will be punished as adulterers and murderers , because they are in fact adulterers , and blood is on their hands .
CEB	Ezekiel	23	46	The Lord God proclaims : Bring up an assembly against them , and decree terror and plunder for them .
CEB	Ezekiel	23	47	Let the assembly stone them ! Let them carve them up with their swords , slay their sons and daughters , and burn their houses with fire !
CEB	Ezekiel	23	48	So I will put an end to betrayal in the land . Taking warning , no woman will betray as you have done .
CEB	Ezekiel	23	49	You will be held accountable for your betrayals , and you will bear the sins of your idols . Then you will know that I am the Lord God . Footnotes - Ezekiel 23:24 Heb uncertain - Ezekiel 23:43 Heb uncertain
CEB	Ezekiel	24	24	Ezekiel is your sign . You will do everything that he has done . When this happens , you will know that I am the Lord God .
CEB	Ezekiel	24	2	Human one , write down today ’ s date , because today the king of Babylon has set up camp at Jerusalem—today !
CEB	Ezekiel	24	3	Compose a parable for the rebels ’ household and say to them , The Lord God proclaims : Put on the pot , set it on , and fill it with water .
CEB	Ezekiel	24	4	Add meat to it , every good piece . With shoulder and thigh , the meatiest bones , fill it up .
CEB	Ezekiel	24	5	Take the flock ’ s best animal ; arrange the wood [ a ] beneath it . Bring it to a rolling boil , and cook its bones in it .
CEB	Ezekiel	24	6	The Lord God proclaims : Horror ! You bloody city , you corroded pot ; pot whose corrosion can ’ t be removed ! Empty it piece by piece . She is rejected [ b ]
CEB	Ezekiel	24	7	because her blood is still with her . She didn ’ t pour it out on the ground so that it could be covered with dirt , but she spread it out on a bare rock .
CEB	Ezekiel	24	8	In order to arouse wrath , to guarantee vengeance , I will spread her blood on a bare rock , never to be covered .
CEB	Ezekiel	24	9	So now the Lord God proclaims : Horror ! You bloody city ! I myself will add fuel to the fire !
CEB	Ezekiel	24	10	Pile on the wood , light the fire , and cook the meat . Season it well and let the bones be charred .
CEB	Ezekiel	24	11	Let the pot stand empty on its coals until it ’ s so hot that its copper glows , its impurities melt in it , and its corrosion is consumed .
CEB	Ezekiel	24	12	It ’ s a worthless task . Even by fire its great corrosion isn ’ t removed .
CEB	Ezekiel	24	13	How your betrayals defile you ! I cleansed you , but you didn ’ t come clean from your impurities . You won ’ t be clean again until I have exhausted my anger against you .
CEB	Ezekiel	24	14	I , the Lord , have spoken ! It ’ s coming , and I ’ ll do it . I won ’ t relent or have any pity or compassion . Your punishments will fit your ways and your deeds ! This is what the Lord God says . Ezekiel ’ s wife dies
CEB	Ezekiel	24	15	The Lord ’ s word came to me :
CEB	Ezekiel	24	16	Human one , I am about to take the delight of your eyes away from you in a single stroke . Don ’ t mourn or weep . Don ’ t even let your tears well up .
CEB	Ezekiel	24	17	Sigh inwardly ; be deathly still . Don ’ t perform mourning rites , but bind on your turban and put your shoes on your feet . And don ’ t cover your upper lip or eat in human company .
CEB	Ezekiel	24	18	I spoke with the people in the morning , and by evening my wife was dead . The next morning I did as I was commanded .
CEB	Ezekiel	24	19	The people asked , “ Won ’ t you tell us what your actions mean for us ? ”
CEB	Ezekiel	24	20	So I said to them , The Lord ’ s word came to me :
CEB	Ezekiel	24	21	Say to the house of Israel , the Lord God proclaims : I ’ m about to make my sanctuary impure , the pride of your strength , the delight of your eyes . Your heart ’ s desire , the sons and daughters you left behind , will fall by the sword .
CEB	Ezekiel	24	22	You will do as I have done . You will neither cover your upper lip nor eat in human company .
CEB	Ezekiel	24	23	Your turbans will be on your heads , your sandals on your feet . You won ’ t mourn or weep . You will waste away in your guilt , all of you groaning to each other .
CEB	Ezekiel	24	25	And you , human one : On the day that I take from them their proud stronghold—their crowning joy , the delight of their eyes—and their sons and daughters , whose fate weighs on them ,
CEB	Ezekiel	24	26	on that day , a refugee will come to you so that you yourself will hear the news .
CEB	Ezekiel	24	27	On that day your mouth will be opened to the refugee , and you will speak and no longer be silent . You will be their sign , and they will know that I am the Lord . Footnotes - Ezekiel 24:5 Or bones - Ezekiel 24:6 Or the lot did not fall to her
CEB	Ezekiel	25	25	The Lord ’ s word came to me :
CEB	Ezekiel	25	2	Human one , face the Ammonites and prophesy against them .
CEB	Ezekiel	25	3	Say to the Ammonites : Hear the Lord God ’ s word ! The Lord God proclaims : You laughed when my sanctuary was degraded , when Israel ’ s fertile land was laid waste , and when the house of Judah went into exile ;
CEB	Ezekiel	25	4	therefore , I ’ m handing you over to people in the east for them to take possession . They will set up their encampments against you , establish residence , devour your fruit , and drink your milk .
CEB	Ezekiel	25	5	I ’ ll make Rabbah into pastureland for camels and Ammon a resting place for flocks . Then you will know that I am the Lord .
CEB	Ezekiel	25	6	The Lord God proclaims : Because you clapped your hands and stamped your feet when you rejoiced with utter contempt for Israel ’ s fertile land ,
CEB	Ezekiel	25	7	I ’ m about to overpower you . Nations will plunder you . I will cut you off from the peoples , remove you from the lands , and utterly destroy you . Then you will know that I am the Lord .
CEB	Ezekiel	25	8	The Lord God proclaims : Because Moab and Seir say , “ Aha ! The house of Judah has become like all the nations , ”
CEB	Ezekiel	25	9	I ’ ll open up the flank of Moab from the cities at its border , the land ’ s splendid cities , Beth-jeshimoth , Baal-meon , and Kiriathaim .
CEB	Ezekiel	25	10	I ’ ll hand it over , along with the Ammonites , to people in the east for them to take possession . And so Ammon will no longer be remembered among the nations .
CEB	Ezekiel	25	11	I ’ ll execute judgments in Moab , and they will know that I am the Lord .
CEB	Ezekiel	25	12	The Lord God proclaims : Edom acted with excessive force against the house of Judah . The Judeans were guilty , but Edom ’ s vengeance was excessive .
CEB	Ezekiel	25	13	So the Lord God now proclaims : I ’ ll overpower Edom , eliminate all living creatures , and make it a wasteland from Teman to Dedan . They will fall by the sword .
CEB	Ezekiel	25	14	I will execute my vengeance in Edom through my people Israel ’ s power . They will act in Edom according to my anger and fury , and they will know my vengeance . This is what the Lord God says .
CEB	Ezekiel	25	15	The Lord God proclaims : When the Philistines set out to right the wrongs done to them , they enacted revenge with utter contempt and old hatreds .
CEB	Ezekiel	25	16	So now the Lord God proclaims : I will overpower the Philistines , eliminate the Cherethites , and obliterate all who are left along the coastline .
CEB	Ezekiel	25	17	I will act against them with great vengeance and with wrathful punishments . When I execute my vengeance against them , they will know that I am the Lord .
CEB	Ezekiel	26	26	In the eleventh year , on the first day of the month , the Lord ’ s word came to me :
CEB	Ezekiel	26	2	Human one , because Tyre laughed at Jerusalem : “ The gate of the peoples is broken , she lies open before me , she is destroyed , but I will succeed ! ”
CEB	Ezekiel	26	3	The Lord God now proclaims : Tyre , I ’ m now against you ! Just as the sea hurls up its waves , I will bring many nations up against you .
CEB	Ezekiel	26	4	When they destroy the walls of Tyre and throw down its towers , I will scrape off all its dirt and make it into a bare rock ,
CEB	Ezekiel	26	5	a place for drying nets in the middle of the sea . I have spoken ! This is what the Lord God says . It will become prey for the nations ,
CEB	Ezekiel	26	6	and its towns around it will be put to the sword . Then they will know that I am the Lord .
CEB	Ezekiel	26	7	The Lord God proclaims : I ’ m bringing Nebuchadrezzar against Tyre , the king of Babylon from the north , the greatest of all kings , with horses , chariots , and charioteers , an assembly , a great army .
CEB	Ezekiel	26	8	The towns around you he will destroy with the sword . Then he will build towers against you , erect siege ramps against you , and set up shields .
CEB	Ezekiel	26	9	He will pound his battering ram against your walls ; with crowbars he will tear down your towers .
CEB	Ezekiel	26	10	The dust from all his horses will cover you when he enters your gates as one who enters a breached city . Your walls will quake at the thundering of the charioteers and chariot wheels .
CEB	Ezekiel	26	11	His horses ’ hooves will trample all your courtyards ; he will cut down your people with the sword , and the monuments to your strength he will bring down [ a ] to the ground .
CEB	Ezekiel	26	12	They will destroy your wealth , plunder your goods , tear down your walls , and raze your fine houses . Your stone , lumber , and rubble they will dump into the sea .
CEB	Ezekiel	26	13	I will bring an end to your cacophonous songs ; the sound of your lyres will never be heard again .
CEB	Ezekiel	26	14	I will make you into a bare rock , a place for drying nets , and you will never be rebuilt . I , the Lord , have spoken . This is what the Lord God says . A lament for Tyre
CEB	Ezekiel	26	15	The Lord God proclaims to Tyre : Won ’ t the coastlands quake at the news of your downfall , when the wounded groan , and when the slaughter in your midst goes on and on ?
CEB	Ezekiel	26	16	All the princes of the sea will come down from their thrones , remove their royal robes , and strip off their fine garments . They will be clothed only in terror as they sit on the ground . They will be so terrified , they won ’ t stop shuddering because of you .
CEB	Ezekiel	26	17	They will sing a lament for you , and they will say : How you have perished , queen of the sea , city once praised , who once dominated the sea , she and her rulers , who spread their terror abroad , every one of them .
CEB	Ezekiel	26	18	Now the wastelands tremble on the day of your fall . Your expulsion horrifies the islands of the sea .
CEB	Ezekiel	26	19	The Lord God proclaims : When I turn you into ruins like uninhabitable cities , when the deep sea washes over you and the raging seas cover you ,
CEB	Ezekiel	26	20	I will lead you down into the pit , to the everlasting people . I will install you in the world below , [ b ] in the everlasting ruins , with those who go down to the pit . And so you will neither rule nor radiate splendor in the land of the living .
CEB	Ezekiel	26	21	I will terrify you , and you will disappear . You will be sought but never found again . This is what the Lord God says . Footnotes - Ezekiel 26:11 LXX ; MT it will fall - Ezekiel 26:20 Or the land of the lowest places
CEB	Ezekiel	27	27	Your goods , your wares , your wealth , your sailors , your helmsmen , those patching your leaks , your merchants , all your warriors in you , and all the company that is with you— they also sank into the sea ’ s depth on the day of your demise .
CEB	Ezekiel	27	2	You , human one , sing a lament for Tyre .
CEB	Ezekiel	27	3	Say this about Tyre , who sits enthroned at the entrance to the sea , the people ’ s agent for trade throughout the coastlands . The Lord God proclaims : Tyre , you say , “ I ’ m perfectly beautiful ! ”
CEB	Ezekiel	27	4	But your territory is in the depths of the sea , and it ’ s your builders who made you beautiful .
CEB	Ezekiel	27	5	For you they made your deck of cypress from Senir . To make your mast , they took cedar from Lebanon .
CEB	Ezekiel	27	6	For your oars , they used the oaks of Bashan . They made your hull , inlaid with ivory , of boxwood from the coasts of Cyprus .
CEB	Ezekiel	27	7	Fine embroidered linen from Egypt was your sail ; it became your emblem . Your awning was made of blue and purple cloth from the coasts of Elishah .
CEB	Ezekiel	27	8	The princes of Sidon and Arvad were your oarsmen . Your own wise men were in you as your helmsmen .
CEB	Ezekiel	27	9	The elders and wise men of Gebal were in you , patching up your leaks . Every seagoing ship and its sailors came to do business with you .
CEB	Ezekiel	27	10	Paras , Lud , and Put were the warriors in your army . By hanging their shields and helmets on you , they made you radiant .
CEB	Ezekiel	27	11	The men of Arvad and Helech were stationed on your walls all around ; the men of Gamad were in your towers . They hung their weapons on your walls all around . They were the ones who completed your beauty .
CEB	Ezekiel	27	12	Tarshish was your procurer of great wealth . For your wares , they exchanged silver , iron , tin , and lead .
CEB	Ezekiel	27	13	Javan , Tubal , and Meshech were your agents in human trafficking . They gave you bronze vessels for these wares of yours .
CEB	Ezekiel	27	14	Beth-togarmah traded horses , warhorses , and mules for your wares .
CEB	Ezekiel	27	15	Islanders from Rhodes [ a ] were your agents . By contract they procured ebony and ivory for you from many coastlands .
CEB	Ezekiel	27	16	Aram was your agent for many products . They traded turquoise , purple cloth , colorful brocades , linen , coral , and rubies for your wares .
CEB	Ezekiel	27	17	Judah and the land of Israel were your agents , trading the finest wheat , [ b ] millet , [ c ] honey , oil , and balm for your wares .
CEB	Ezekiel	27	18	For many of your finished products , Damascus traded out of its great wealth the wine of Helbon and white wool .
CEB	Ezekiel	27	19	Vedan and Javan from the region of Uzal traded with you . They exchanged wrought iron , cinnamon , and spices for your wares .
CEB	Ezekiel	27	20	Dedan was your agent for saddle blankets .
CEB	Ezekiel	27	21	Arabia and all the princes of Kedar traded for you . They procured lambs , rams , and goats for you .
CEB	Ezekiel	27	22	They were your agents in Sheba and Raamah . For your wares they exchanged the finest spices , every kind of precious stone , and gold .
CEB	Ezekiel	27	23	Haran , Canneh , and Eden were your agents , [ d ] and also Assyria and Chilmad .
CEB	Ezekiel	27	24	They procured fine finished goods for you , garments of purple and brocade , and plush carpets rolled up and securely tied with ropes , among your acquisitions .
CEB	Ezekiel	27	25	The ships of Tarshish carried your goods . You were filled to capacity and heavily laden in the middle of the sea .
CEB	Ezekiel	27	26	Your oarsmen brought you out onto the high seas ; an east wind sank you into the sea ’ s depths .
CEB	Ezekiel	27	28	At your helmsmen ’ s cries for help , the troubled waters seethe .
CEB	Ezekiel	27	29	Those entrusted with the oars desert their posts . All sailors and helmsmen seek footing on the shore .
CEB	Ezekiel	27	30	Loudly they cry , bitterly they wail , and they put dust on their heads and cover themselves with ashes .
CEB	Ezekiel	27	31	They cut off all their hair and put on mourning clothes . In despair they weep for you , and bitterly perform the mourning rites .
CEB	Ezekiel	27	32	In their lamentation they raise a lament for you ; they sing lamentions over you : “ Who was like Tyre , silenced in the middle of the sea ? ”
CEB	Ezekiel	27	33	When your wares came out from the seas , you satisfied many people . Your abundant wealth and merchandise enriched the kings of the earth .
CEB	Ezekiel	27	34	Now you are shattered by the seas ; your cargoes , as well as everyone in your company , are sunk into the water ’ s depths .
CEB	Ezekiel	27	35	Now the inhabitants of the coastlands shudder on account of you . And as for their kings , their hair stands on end ; their faces betray their horror .
CEB	Ezekiel	27	36	The merchants for the peoples hiss because of you . You have become a terror ; from now on you are nothing . Footnotes - Ezekiel 27:15 Heb Dedan - Ezekiel 27:17 Or wheat from Minnith - Ezekiel 27:17 Heb uncertain - Ezekiel 27:23 LXX ; MT adds Sheba .
CEB	Ezekiel	28	28	The Lord ’ s word came to me :
CEB	Ezekiel	28	2	Human one , say to the prince of Tyre , The Lord God proclaims : In your arrogance , you say , “ I am God , and as God I rule the seas ! ” Though you claim to have the mind of a god , you are mortal , not divine .
CEB	Ezekiel	28	3	You are certainly wiser than Daniel ; no secrets are hidden from you .
CEB	Ezekiel	28	4	By your wisdom and discernment , you made yourself rich , and you filled your storehouses with silver and gold .
CEB	Ezekiel	28	5	Through your shrewd trading you multiplied your riches . But then you became proud of your riches .
CEB	Ezekiel	28	6	So now the Lord God proclaims : Because you claim to have the mind of a god ,
CEB	Ezekiel	28	7	I ’ ll bring foreigners , the most ruthless nations , against you . They will let loose their swords against your fine wisdom , and they will degrade your splendor .
CEB	Ezekiel	28	8	They will hurl you to destruction , and you will die , murdered , on the high seas .
CEB	Ezekiel	28	9	When you face your murderers , will you still say , “ I ’ m God ” ? In your killers ’ hands , you are mortal , not divine .
CEB	Ezekiel	28	10	You will die as the uncircumcised do , at the hands of foreigners . I have spoken . This is what the Lord God has said .
CEB	Ezekiel	28	11	The Lord ’ s word came to me :
CEB	Ezekiel	28	12	Human one , sing a lament for the king of Tyre . Say to him , The Lord God proclaims : You were full of wisdom and beauty , the image of perfection .
CEB	Ezekiel	28	13	You were in Eden , God ’ s garden . You were covered with gold and every precious stone : carnelian , topaz , and moonstone ; beryl , onyx , and jasper ; lapis lazuli , turquoise , and emerald . On the day that you were created , finely crafted pendants and engravings were prepared .
CEB	Ezekiel	28	14	You , a winged creature , were installed as a guardian . I placed you in God ’ s holy mountain where you walked among the stones of fire .
CEB	Ezekiel	28	15	From the day you were created until injustice was found in you , your ways were assured .
CEB	Ezekiel	28	16	But because of your trade , your oppressive business practices piled up , and you became impure . So I expelled you from God ’ s mountain . I removed you , winged creature , guardian , from among the stones of fire .
CEB	Ezekiel	28	17	You exalted yourself because of your beauty and corrupted your wisdom for the sake of your splendor . I will cast you down to the earth in the sight of kings , and I will make a spectacle of you .
CEB	Ezekiel	28	18	Because of your corrupt trade , which surpassed your many other sins , you made your sanctuaries impure . Therefore , I will bring fire from your midst . When it has consumed you , I will turn you into dust on the earth in the sight of all who see you .
CEB	Ezekiel	28	19	Everyone among the peoples who knows you will be appalled because of you . You will become a terror . From that time on , you will be nothing . Against Sidon
CEB	Ezekiel	28	20	The Lord ’ s word came to me :
CEB	Ezekiel	28	21	Human one , face Sidon , prophesy against it ,
CEB	Ezekiel	28	22	and say , The Lord God proclaims : I ’ m against you , Sidon , and I will manifest my glory in you . When I ’ ve executed judgment against it and through it have manifested my holiness , they will know that I am the Lord .
CEB	Ezekiel	28	23	I will hurl plague against it , and blood will run in its streets . When the sword comes against it from all sides , the slain will fall within it . Then they will know that I am the Lord .
CEB	Ezekiel	28	24	The house of Israel will no longer suffer from the pricking thorn or painful briar of any of its neighbors who hold it in contempt . And they will know that I am the Lord God .
CEB	Ezekiel	28	25	The Lord God proclaims : When I gather the house of Israel from the peoples among whom they ’ ve scattered , and I demonstrate my holiness through them in the sight of the nations , they will live on their fertile land , which I gave to my servant Jacob .
CEB	Ezekiel	28	26	They will live on it in safety . They will build houses , plant vineyards , and live in safety . When I execute judgments against all who hold them in contempt on every side , they will know that I , the Lord , am their God .
CEB	Ezekiel	29	29	In the tenth year , on the twelfth day of the tenth month , the Lord ’ s word came to me :
CEB	Ezekiel	29	2	Human one , face Pharaoh , Egypt ’ s king , and prophesy against him and against all of Egypt .
CEB	Ezekiel	29	3	Speak and say , The Lord God proclaims : I ’ m against you , Pharaoh , Egypt ’ s king , great crocodile lurking in the Nile ’ s canals , who says , “ The Nile is all mine ; I made it for myself ! ”
CEB	Ezekiel	29	4	I will set hooks in your jaws ; I will make the fish from the Nile ’ s canals cling to your scales . I will drag you out of the Nile ’ s canals , and also all the fish from the Nile ’ s canals clinging to your scales .
CEB	Ezekiel	29	5	I will fling you out into the desert , and also all the fish from the Nile ’ s canals . You will fall on the open ground , and won ’ t be gathered or retrieved . I ’ ve given you to the beasts of the earth and the birds in the sky for food .
CEB	Ezekiel	29	6	Everyone living in Egypt will know that I am the Lord . Because they were a flimsy crutch for the house of Israel—
CEB	Ezekiel	29	7	when they took you in hand , you would splinter and make their shoulders sore ; when they leaned on you , you would break , bringing them to their knees—
CEB	Ezekiel	29	8	now the Lord God proclaims : I ’ m bringing a sword against you , and I will cut off from you human and beast .
CEB	Ezekiel	29	9	The land of Egypt will be turned into a wasteland and ruins . Then they will know that I am the Lord . Because you [ a ] said , “ The Nile is mine ; I made it , ”
CEB	Ezekiel	29	10	I ’ m against you and against the Nile ’ s canals . I will make the land of Egypt into an utter ruin , a wasteland , from Migdol to Syene and as far as its boundary with Cush .
CEB	Ezekiel	29	11	No foot , animal or human , will walk across it , and it won ’ t be inhabited for forty years .
CEB	Ezekiel	29	12	I will make the land of Egypt the most desolate of wastelands and its cities the most devastated of ruined cities . It will be a wasteland for forty years , and the Egyptians will be scattered among the nations and dispersed throughout the lands .
CEB	Ezekiel	29	13	The Lord God proclaims : At the end of forty years , I will gather the Egyptians from among the nations where they are scattered .
CEB	Ezekiel	29	14	I will improve their circumstances and bring them back to the land of Pathros , the land of their origin . Egypt will be a lowly kingdom there .
CEB	Ezekiel	29	15	Out of all the kingdoms , it will be the lowliest . It will never again exalt itself over the nations , and I will make it small to keep it from ruling the nations .
CEB	Ezekiel	29	16	The house of Israel will never again bring guilt on itself by faithlessly turning to Egypt for help , for they will know that I am the Lord God .
CEB	Ezekiel	29	17	In the twenty-seventh year , on the first day of the first month , the Lord ’ s word came to me :
CEB	Ezekiel	29	18	Human one , Babylon ’ s King Nebuchadrezzar made his army labor very hard against Tyre . Every head was scraped bald , and every shoulder was rubbed raw , yet he got nothing from Tyre for himself or for his army for any of his efforts against it .
CEB	Ezekiel	29	19	So now the Lord God proclaims : I ’ m going to give the land of Egypt to Babylon ’ s King Nebuchadrezzar . He will carry off its wealth , he will plunder and loot it , and it will be the wages for his army .
CEB	Ezekiel	29	20	I will give him the land of Egypt as payment for his laboring for me . This is what the Lord God says .
CEB	Ezekiel	29	21	On that day I will give new strength [ b ] to the house of Israel , and I will open your mouth among them . Then they will know that I am the Lord . Footnotes - Ezekiel 29:9 Or he - Ezekiel 29:21 Or make a horn sprout
CEB	Ezekiel	30	30	The Lord ’ s word came to me :
CEB	Ezekiel	30	2	Human one , prophesy and say , The Lord God proclaims : Howl ! Horror for the day !
CEB	Ezekiel	30	3	The day is coming , the day of the Lord comes , a day of clouds : the nations ’ time has come .
CEB	Ezekiel	30	4	A sword will come into Egypt , and trembling will overcome Cush , when the slain fall in Egypt , its wealth carried away , and its foundations razed .
CEB	Ezekiel	30	5	Cush , Put , and Lud , all Arabia and Cub , and the people from the allied country [ a ] with them will fall by the sword .
CEB	Ezekiel	30	6	The Lord proclaims : When Egypt ’ s helpers fall , its proud strength will decline . From Migdol to Syene they will fall by the sword . This is what the Lord God says .
CEB	Ezekiel	30	7	Of all the lands laid waste , it will be the most desolate ; of all cities , the most ruined .
CEB	Ezekiel	30	8	They will know that I am the Lord . On the day that I set fire to Egypt and all its helpers are broken ,
CEB	Ezekiel	30	9	messengers in ships will go out from me to startle the complacent Cushites . Anguish will overcome them on Egypt ’ s day . It ’ s certainly coming .
CEB	Ezekiel	30	10	The Lord God proclaims : I will bring an end to the hordes of Egypt through the power of Babylon ’ s King Nebuchadrezzar .
CEB	Ezekiel	30	11	He and his people with him , the most terrible of the nations , will be brought in to destroy the land . They will draw their swords against Egypt and fill the land with the slain .
CEB	Ezekiel	30	12	I will dry up the Nile canals ; I will sell the land to evildoers . With the help of foreigners I will lay waste to the land and everything in it . I , the Lord , have spoken .
CEB	Ezekiel	30	13	The Lord God proclaims : I will destroy the idols and bring an end to the images in Memphis . Never again will there be a prince from the land of Egypt ; so I will kindle fear in the land of Egypt .
CEB	Ezekiel	30	14	I will turn Pathros into a desolation , set fire to Zoan , and execute judgments in Thebes .
CEB	Ezekiel	30	15	I will pour out my anger on Pelusium , the stronghold of Egypt , and I will cut down pompous Thebes .
CEB	Ezekiel	30	16	I will set Egypt on fire ; Pelusium will writhe in travail , Thebes will be split open , Memphis assaulted in broad daylight .
CEB	Ezekiel	30	17	The elite troops of On and Pi-beseth will fall by the sword , and the cities themselves will go into captivity .
CEB	Ezekiel	30	18	At Tehaphnehes the day will go dark when I break Egypt ’ s yoke and bring an end to its proud strength . A cloud will cover it , and the towns around it will go into captivity .
CEB	Ezekiel	30	19	I will execute judgments in Egypt , and they will know that I am the Lord .
CEB	Ezekiel	30	20	In the eleventh year , on the seventh day of the first month , the Lord ’ s word came to me :
CEB	Ezekiel	30	21	Human one , I ’ ve broken the arm of Pharaoh , Egypt ’ s king , and it hasn ’ t been set so that it might heal , nor has it been braced or wrapped up so that it might be strong enough to grasp a sword .
CEB	Ezekiel	30	22	So now the Lord God proclaims : I ’ m against Pharaoh , and I will break his arms , both the sound one and the broken one , and I ’ ll make the sword fall out of his hand .
CEB	Ezekiel	30	23	I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them throughout the earth .
CEB	Ezekiel	30	24	I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon , and I will put my sword into his hand . When I break the arms of Pharaoh , he will groan like a dying man in his presence .
CEB	Ezekiel	30	25	I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon , but the arms of Pharaoh will fall . They will know that I am the Lord , when I put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon and he uses it against the land of Egypt .
CEB	Ezekiel	30	26	When I scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them throughout the earth , they will know that I am the Lord . Footnotes - Ezekiel 30:5 Or land of the covenant
CEB	Ezekiel	31	31	In the eleventh year , on the first day of the third month , the Lord ’ s word came to me :
CEB	Ezekiel	31	2	Human one , say to Pharaoh , Egypt ’ s king , and his troops : With whom do you compare in your greatness ?
CEB	Ezekiel	31	3	Consider Assyria , a cedar of Lebanon : beautiful branches , dense shade , towering height ; indeed , its top went up between the clouds .
CEB	Ezekiel	31	4	Waters nourished it ; the deep raised it up , because its streams flowed around the place where it was planted . From there , water trickled down to all the other trees of the field .
CEB	Ezekiel	31	5	And so it became higher than all the trees of the field . Its branches became abundant ; its boughs grew long . Because of the plentiful water , it grew freely .
CEB	Ezekiel	31	6	All the birds in the sky made nests in its branches ; all the beasts of the field gave birth under its boughs , and in its shade , every great nation lived .
CEB	Ezekiel	31	7	It became beautiful in its greatness and in its lush foliage , because it took root in plentiful water .
CEB	Ezekiel	31	8	No cedar was its equal in God ’ s garden . The fir trees didn ’ t have anything like its branches , and the plane trees had nothing like its boughs . None of the trees in God ’ s garden could compare to it in its beauty .
CEB	Ezekiel	31	9	As for its beauty—I made it so , with its abundant foliage . All the trees of Eden envied it , all that were in God ’ s garden .
CEB	Ezekiel	31	10	So now the Lord God proclaims : Consider the fate of those who tower high ! When it allowed its branches to reach up among the clouds , it became arrogant .
CEB	Ezekiel	31	11	So I handed it over to the most powerful nation , who continually acted treacherously against it . I banished it !
CEB	Ezekiel	31	12	Foreigners , the worst of the nations , cut it down and left it to lie among the hills . All its branches fell among the valleys , and its boughs were broken off in the earth ’ s deep ravines . All the earth ’ s peoples departed from its shade and abandoned it .
CEB	Ezekiel	31	13	On its trunk roost all the birds in the sky , and on its boughs lie all the beasts of the field .
CEB	Ezekiel	31	14	All this has happened so that no other well-watered tree would tower high or allow its branches to reach among the clouds . Nor would their leaders achieve the towering stature of such well-watered trees . Certainly , all of them are consigned to death , to the world below , [ a ] among human beings who go down to the pit .
CEB	Ezekiel	31	15	The Lord God proclaims : On the day that it went down to the underworld , [ b ] I caused mourning . I blocked off the deep sea against it . I dried up its rivers and restrained the mighty waters . I made Lebanon go into mourning for it , and all the trees of the field languished on its account .
CEB	Ezekiel	31	16	When it was felled , the nations quaked at the sound . When I cast it down into the underworld , with those who go down to the pit , all the trees of Eden were comforted in the world below , the choicest and the best of Lebanon , all the trees that depended on water .
CEB	Ezekiel	31	17	His allies , [ c ] those among the nations who lived under his shade , these also went down with him to the underworld , to those who are slain by the sword .
CEB	Ezekiel	31	18	Are you like any of these in glory or greatness among Eden ’ s trees ? Then you too will go down with Eden ’ s trees to the world below . You will lie among the uncircumcised , with those who are slain by the sword . This is Pharaoh and his entire horde . This is what the Lord God says .

CEB	Ezekiel	32	32	Though it was I who put his terror in the land of the living , he will be laid out among the uncircumcised , with those slain by the sword , Pharaoh and all his horde .

CEB	Ezekiel	32	2	Human one , sing a lament for Pharaoh , Egypt ’ s king . Say to him : You consider yourself a young lion among the nations , but you are like the sea monster ! You thrash about in your rivers , you roil the waters with your feet , and you muddy your [ a ] rivers .
CEB	Ezekiel	32	3	The Lord God proclaims : In the company of many peoples I will spread my net over you , and I will haul you up in my dragnet .
CEB	Ezekiel	32	4	I will cast you out on the earth and throw you on the open ground . I will cause all the birds in the sky to settle on you , and all the beasts of the earth to devour you .
CEB	Ezekiel	32	5	Your flesh I will set upon the mountains , and I will fill the valleys with your gore .
CEB	Ezekiel	32	6	With your blood I will soak your irrigated land , [ b ] and the streambeds will be filled with you .
CEB	Ezekiel	32	7	When you are snuffed out , I will cover the sky , and I will darken the stars . I will cover the sun with a cloud , and the moon won ’ t radiate its light .
CEB	Ezekiel	32	8	As for the shining lights of the heavens , I will make them dark over you , and set darkness over your land . This is what the Lord God says .
CEB	Ezekiel	32	9	I will trouble the hearts of many peoples when I bring about your destruction with nations from lands you didn ’ t know .
CEB	Ezekiel	32	10	I will make many peoples appalled because of you . Their kings will shudder violently on your account when I brandish my sword before them . They will tremble for their lives again and again on the day of your downfall .
CEB	Ezekiel	32	11	The Lord God proclaims : The sword of the king of Babylon is coming against you !
CEB	Ezekiel	32	12	I will make your hordes fall by the swords of mighty men , the most terrifying of the nations , all of them . They will bring an end to Egypt ’ s pride , and all of its hordes will be destroyed .
CEB	Ezekiel	32	13	I will remove all its livestock from beside the plentiful waters so that neither human foot nor livestock ’ s hoof will trouble it again .
CEB	Ezekiel	32	14	At that time , I will allow the waters to run clear , and make its rivers flow like oil . This is what the Lord God says .
CEB	Ezekiel	32	15	When I turn the land of Egypt into a wasteland and the land is deprived of all that fills it , and when I strike down those who live there , then they will know that I am the Lord .
CEB	Ezekiel	32	16	This is a lament , and it will be sung as a lament . The daughters of the nations will lament for Egypt , and they will also lament for Egypt ’ s hordes . This is what the Lord God says .
CEB	Ezekiel	32	17	In the twelfth year , on the fifteenth day of the first month , [ c ] the Lord ’ s word came to me :
CEB	Ezekiel	32	18	Human one , mourn for Egypt ’ s hordes . Send Egypt down with the mighty nations subject [ d ] to it , to the world below , [ e ] among those who go down to the pit .
CEB	Ezekiel	32	19	Whom do you surpass in beauty ? Go down and take your bed with the uncircumcised ,
CEB	Ezekiel	32	20	among those who fall slain by the sword . A sword is appointed , and all his hordes will carry him off .
CEB	Ezekiel	32	21	The mighty chieftains , those who once came to his aid , will speak to him from the middle of the underworld , [ f ] for the uncircumcised have gone down and have lain down , slain by the sword . Vanished glory
CEB	Ezekiel	32	22	Assyria is there , and all its assembly round about his grave , all of them slain , fallen by the sword ,
CEB	Ezekiel	32	23	who were assigned graves in the deepest region of the pit . His assembly surrounded his grave , all of them slain , fallen by the sword , who caused terror in the land of the living .
CEB	Ezekiel	32	24	Elam is there , her entire horde round about her grave , all of them slain , fallen by the sword , who went down uncircumcised to the world below , [ g ] who caused terror in the land of the living . They bore their shame like those who go down to the pit .
CEB	Ezekiel	32	25	Among the slain they made a bed for her , with all her hordes round about her grave , all of them uncircumcised , slain by the sword , for they caused terror in the land of the living . They bore their shame like those who go down to the pit ; in the midst of the slain she [ h ] was placed .
CEB	Ezekiel	32	26	Meshech and Tubal are there , and all their hordes around their graves , all of them uncircumcised , slain by the sword , for they caused terror in the land of the living .
CEB	Ezekiel	32	27	They don ’ t lie with the mighty men fallen among the uncircumcised . When they went down to the underworld [ i ] with their weapons of war , they put their swords under their heads and their shields [ j ] over their bones . The terror of the mighty men is in the land of the living .
CEB	Ezekiel	32	28	But you , you will be broken among the uncircumcised , and you will lie with those who are slain by the sword .
CEB	Ezekiel	32	29	Edom is there , its kings and all its princes , who , though strong , were put with those slain by the sword . They lie with the uncircumcised , like those who go down to the pit .
CEB	Ezekiel	32	30	All the princes of the north are there , and all the Sidonians who went down with the slain ; in spite of the terror of their strength , they were disgraced . They lie uncircumcised with those slain by the sword . They bore their shame like those who go down to the pit .
CEB	Ezekiel	32	31	When Pharaoh sees them , he will be sorry for all his hordes who are slain by the sword— Pharaoh and all his army . This is what the Lord God says ,
CEB	Ezekiel	33	33	When this comes—and it is certainly coming—they will know that a prophet has been among them . Footnotes - Ezekiel 33:26 Or defiles his neighbor 's wife - Ezekiel 33:31 Or love songs
CEB	Ezekiel	33	2	Human one , speak to your people and say to them : Suppose I bring a sword against a country , and the people of the land take a certain person from their assembly and make him their lookout .
CEB	Ezekiel	33	3	When he sees the sword coming against the land , he blows the trumpet and warns the people .
CEB	Ezekiel	33	4	If they hear the sound of the trumpet but don ’ t heed the warning , when the sword comes and they are taken away , they are responsible for their blood .
CEB	Ezekiel	33	5	They heard the sound of the trumpet but didn ’ t heed the warning , so their blood is on them . If they had paid attention to the warning , they would have saved their lives .
CEB	Ezekiel	33	6	If the lookout sees the sword coming but doesn ’ t blow the trumpet to warn the people , when the sword comes and takes away any of them , they are taken away in their sin , but I ’ ll hold the lookout responsible for their blood .
CEB	Ezekiel	33	7	You , human one , I ’ ve made you a lookout for the house of Israel . Whenever you hear me speaking , you must give them warning from me .
CEB	Ezekiel	33	8	If I pronounce a death sentence on wicked people , and you don ’ t warn them to turn from their way , they will die in their guilt , but I will hold you responsible for their blood .
CEB	Ezekiel	33	9	But suppose you do warn the wicked of their ways so that they might turn from them . If they don ’ t turn from their ways , they will die in their guilt , but you will save your life .
CEB	Ezekiel	33	10	You , human one , say to the house of Israel : This is what all of you are saying : “ How our transgressions and our sins weigh on us ! We waste away because of them . How can we live ? ”
CEB	Ezekiel	33	11	Say to them , This is what the Lord God says : As surely as I live , do I take pleasure in the death of the wicked ? If the wicked turn from their ways , they will live . Turn , completely turn from your wicked ways ! Why should you die , house of Israel ?
CEB	Ezekiel	33	12	You , human one , say to your people : The righteousness of the righteous doesn ’ t rescue them when they begin to sin . Nor does the wickedness of the wicked make them stumble if they turn from their wickedness . If the righteous sin , their righteousness won ’ t protect them .
CEB	Ezekiel	33	13	Even if I ’ ve told the righteous they will live , none of their righteous deeds will be remembered if they trust in their righteousness and do wrong . They will die because of their evil deeds .
CEB	Ezekiel	33	14	And even if I have pronounced a death sentence on the wicked , if they turn from sin and do what is just and right—
CEB	Ezekiel	33	15	if they return pledges , make restitution for robbery , and walk in life-giving regulations in order not to sin—they will live and not die .
CEB	Ezekiel	33	16	None of the sins they ’ ve committed will be remembered against them . They ’ ve done what is just and right , and they will live .
CEB	Ezekiel	33	17	Yet your people say , “ My Lord ’ s way doesn ’ t measure up. ” Isn ’ t it their ways that don ’ t measure up ?
CEB	Ezekiel	33	18	When the righteous turn from their righteousness to do wrong , they will die because of it .
CEB	Ezekiel	33	19	And when the wicked turn from their wickedness to do what is just and right , it is for that reason they will live .
CEB	Ezekiel	33	20	Yet you say , “ My Lord ’ s way doesn ’ t measure up. ” I judge each one of you according to your ways , house of Israel ! News from Jerusalem
CEB	Ezekiel	33	21	In the twelfth year , on the fifth day of the tenth month of our exile , a survivor from Jerusalem came to me and reported , “ The city has fallen ! ”
CEB	Ezekiel	33	22	The Lord ’ s power was with me in the evening before the survivor arrived , and just before he arrived in the morning , God opened my mouth . So my mouth was opened , and I was no longer speechless .
CEB	Ezekiel	33	23	The Lord ’ s word came to me :
CEB	Ezekiel	33	24	Human one , those who live among those ruins in Israel ’ s fertile land are saying , “ Abraham was just one man , and he inherited the land . We are many , so certainly the land has been given to us as an inheritance. ”
CEB	Ezekiel	33	25	So say to them , The Lord God proclaims : You eat with the blood , you lift your eyes to the idols , and you shed blood . Should you inherit the land ?
CEB	Ezekiel	33	26	You live by the sword , you observe detestable practices , and every one of you commits adultery . [ a ] Should you inherit the land ?
CEB	Ezekiel	33	27	Say to them , The Lord God proclaims : As surely as I live , those in the ruins will fall by the sword , those in the countryside I will give to the wild beasts to consume , and those in the strongholds and caves will die of plague .
CEB	Ezekiel	33	28	I will make the land an uninhabitable waste . Its proud strength will come to an end , and Israel ’ s highlands will become so deserted that no one will cross through them .
CEB	Ezekiel	33	29	They will know that I am the Lord when I make the land an uninhabitable waste because of all their detestable practices . A fickle audience
CEB	Ezekiel	33	30	As for you , human one , your people talk about you beside the walls and in their doorways . One by one , they say to each other , “ Let ’ s go hear what sort of message has come from the Lord. ”
CEB	Ezekiel	33	31	So they come to you as people do , and they sit before you as my people . They listen to your words , but they refuse to do them . Though they speak of their longing [ b ] for me , they act out of their own interests and opinions .
CEB	Ezekiel	33	32	To them you are like a singer of love songs with a lovely voice and skilled technique . They listen to your words , but no one does them .
CEB	Ezekiel	34	34	The Lord ’ s word came to me :
CEB	Ezekiel	34	2	Human one , prophesy against Israel ’ s shepherds . Prophesy and say to them , The Lord God proclaims to the shepherds : Doom to Israel ’ s shepherds who tended themselves ! Shouldn ’ t shepherds tend the flock ?
CEB	Ezekiel	34	3	You drink the milk , you wear the wool , and you slaughter the fat animals , but you don ’ t tend the flock .
CEB	Ezekiel	34	4	You don ’ t strengthen the weak , heal the sick , bind up the injured , bring back the strays , or seek out the lost ; but instead you use force to rule them with injustice .
CEB	Ezekiel	34	5	Without a shepherd , my flock was scattered ; and when it was scattered , it became food for all the wild animals .
CEB	Ezekiel	34	6	My flock strayed on all the mountains and on every high hill throughout all the earth . My flock was scattered , and there was no one to look for them or find them .
CEB	Ezekiel	34	7	So now shepherds , hear the Lord ’ s word !
CEB	Ezekiel	34	8	This is what the Lord God says : As surely as I live , without a shepherd , my flock became prey . My flock became food for all the wild animals . My shepherds didn ’ t seek out my flock . They tended themselves , but they didn ’ t tend my flock .
CEB	Ezekiel	34	9	So , shepherds , hear the Lord ’ s word !
CEB	Ezekiel	34	10	The Lord God proclaims : I ’ m against the shepherds ! I will hold them accountable for my flock , and I will put an end to their tending the flock . The shepherds will no longer tend them , because I will rescue my flock from their mouths , and they will no longer be their food .
CEB	Ezekiel	34	11	The Lord God proclaims : I myself will search for my flock and seek them out .
CEB	Ezekiel	34	12	As a shepherd seeks out the flock when some in the flock have been scattered , so will I seek out my flock . I will rescue them from all the places where they were scattered during the time of clouds and thick darkness .
CEB	Ezekiel	34	13	I will gather and lead them out from the countries and peoples , and I will bring them to their own fertile land . I will feed them on Israel ’ s highlands , along the riverbeds , and in all the inhabited places .
CEB	Ezekiel	34	14	I will feed them in good pasture , and their sheepfold will be there , on Israel ’ s lofty highlands . On Israel ’ s highlands , they will lie down in a secure fold and feed on green pastures .
CEB	Ezekiel	34	15	I myself will feed my flock and make them lie down . This is what the Lord God says .
CEB	Ezekiel	34	16	I will seek out the lost , bring back the strays , bind up the wounded , and strengthen the weak . But the fat and the strong I will destroy , because I will tend my sheep [ a ] with justice .
CEB	Ezekiel	34	17	As for you , my flock , the Lord God proclaims : I will judge between the rams and the bucks among the sheep and the goats .
CEB	Ezekiel	34	18	Is feeding in good pasture or drinking clear water such a trivial thing that you should trample and muddy what is left with your feet ?
CEB	Ezekiel	34	19	But now my flock must feed on what your feet have trampled and drink water that your feet have muddied .
CEB	Ezekiel	34	20	So the Lord God proclaims to them : I will judge between the fat and the lean sheep .
CEB	Ezekiel	34	21	You shove with shoulder and flank , and with your horns you ram all the weak sheep until you ’ ve scattered them outside .
CEB	Ezekiel	34	22	But I will rescue my flock so that they will never again be prey . I will even judge between the sheep !
CEB	Ezekiel	34	23	I will appoint for them a single shepherd , and he will feed them . My servant David will feed them . He will be their shepherd .
CEB	Ezekiel	34	24	I , the Lord , will be their God , and my servant David will be their prince . I , the Lord , have spoken .
CEB	Ezekiel	34	25	I will make a covenant of peace for them , and I will banish the wild animals from the land . Then they will safely live in the desert and sleep in the forest .
CEB	Ezekiel	34	26	I will give them and those around my hill a blessing by sending the rain in its season . They will be rains of blessing .
CEB	Ezekiel	34	27	The trees in the field will bear fruit , and the earth will yield its harvest . They will be safe on their fertile land , and they will know that I am the Lord when I break the bars of their yoke and deliver them from those who enslaved them .
CEB	Ezekiel	34	28	The nations will no longer prey on them , and wild animals will no longer devour them . They will live in safety , with no one to trouble them .
CEB	Ezekiel	34	29	I will establish for them a place famous for what it grows . No longer will they experience famine in the land , nor will they bear the disgrace of the nations .
CEB	Ezekiel	34	30	They will know that I , the Lord their God , am with them , and they , the house of Israel , are my people . This is what the Lord God says .
CEB	Ezekiel	34	31	You are my flock , the flock of my pasture . You are human , and I am your God . This is what the Lord God says . Footnotes - Ezekiel 34:16 Or them
CEB	Ezekiel	35	35	The Lord ’ s word came to me :
CEB	Ezekiel	35	2	Human one , face Mount Seir , and prophesy against it .
CEB	Ezekiel	35	3	Say to it , The Lord God proclaims : I ’ m against you , Mount Seir ! I will use my power against you . I will make you into a desolate wasteland ,
CEB	Ezekiel	35	4	I will turn your cities into ruins , and you will become a desolation . Then you will know that I am the Lord .
CEB	Ezekiel	35	5	Because you nursed an ancient grudge , you handed the Israelites over to the sword in the time of their distress , during their final punishment .
CEB	Ezekiel	35	6	So now the Lord God proclaims : As surely as I live , I will prepare you for blood , and blood will pursue you . Because you don ’ t hate bloodshed , bloodshed will pursue you .
CEB	Ezekiel	35	7	I will turn Mount Seir into a desolate wasteland , when I cut off from it both passerby and homecomer .
CEB	Ezekiel	35	8	I will fill its highlands—your hills and your valleys , and all your ravines—with its slain . Those who are slain by the sword will fall on them .
CEB	Ezekiel	35	9	I will turn you into an eternal desolation . Your cities won ’ t be inhabited , and you will know that I am the Lord .
CEB	Ezekiel	35	10	You said , “ These two nations and these two territories are mine . We will take possession of them even if the Lord is there. ”
CEB	Ezekiel	35	11	Therefore , the Lord God proclaims : As surely as I live , I will act according to the anger and zeal you displayed when you dealt with them so hatefully . When I judge you , I will make myself known to them ,
CEB	Ezekiel	35	12	and you will know that I am the Lord . I ’ ve heard the lies and libels that you uttered against Israel ’ s highlands when you said , “ They are laid waste . They ’ ve been given to us to consume. ”
CEB	Ezekiel	35	13	With your mouths you exalted yourselves against me and spoke your words against me . I myself heard it !
CEB	Ezekiel	35	14	The Lord God proclaims : As the whole world rejoices , I will turn you into a desolation .
CEB	Ezekiel	35	15	Just as you rejoiced over the house of Israel ’ s inheritance because it became desolate , so I will deal with you . Mount Seir , you will become a desolation , with all of Edom , all of it . Then they will know that I am the Lord .
CEB	Ezekiel	36	36	The surviving nations around you will know that I , the Lord , have rebuilt what was torn down and have planted what was made desolate . I , the Lord , have spoken , and I will do it .
CEB	Ezekiel	36	2	The Lord God proclaims : The enemy mocked you and said , “ The ancient heights belong to us. ”
CEB	Ezekiel	36	3	Therefore , prophesy and say , The Lord God proclaims : When the surviving nations pressed in and ravaged you from all around to lay claim to you , you became an object of the people ’ s slander and derision .
CEB	Ezekiel	36	4	Hear the Lord God ’ s word , mountains of Israel ! The Lord God proclaims to the mountains and the hills , the watercourses and the valleys , the desolate ruins and the abandoned cities that were contemptuously looted by the surviving nations all around you .
CEB	Ezekiel	36	5	So now , says the Lord God , I will speak in my fiery passion against the surviving nations and against Edom , all those who gleefully and spitefully took my land for themselves as a possession only for plunder . [ a ]
CEB	Ezekiel	36	6	Prophesy concerning Israel ’ s fertile land , and say to the mountains and to the hills , to the ravines and to the valleys , The Lord God proclaims : Because you endured the ridicule of the nations , my passion and fury lead me to speak .
CEB	Ezekiel	36	7	So now the Lord God proclaims : I myself swear that the nations round about you will themselves suffer ridicule .
CEB	Ezekiel	36	8	But you , mountains of Israel , will extend your branches and bear your fruit for my people Israel , because they will come home very soon .
CEB	Ezekiel	36	9	Look , I ’ m here for you , and I will turn toward you , and you will be farmed and sown .
CEB	Ezekiel	36	10	I will populate you with human beings , the whole house of Israel , all of them . The cities will be inhabited , the ruins rebuilt .
CEB	Ezekiel	36	11	When I make people and animals increase on you , they will multiply and be fruitful . I will cause you to be inhabited as you were before . I will do more good for you than in the beginning , and you will know that I am the Lord .
CEB	Ezekiel	36	12	I will let people walk through you , my people Israel ! They will lay claim to you , you will be their inheritance , and you will no longer deprive them of anything .
CEB	Ezekiel	36	13	The Lord God proclaims : Because people say , “ You are a devourer of human beings ” and “ You are depriving your nation , ”
CEB	Ezekiel	36	14	therefore , you will no longer devour human beings or deprive your nation of anything . This is what the Lord God says .
CEB	Ezekiel	36	15	You won ’ t have to listen anymore to the taunts of the nations or endure the scorn of the peoples . And you will no longer deprive your nation of anything . This is what the Lord God says . A new heart
CEB	Ezekiel	36	16	The Lord ’ s word came to me :
CEB	Ezekiel	36	17	Human one , when the house of Israel lived on their fertile land , they polluted it with their ways and deeds . Their ways before me were polluted like the blood of menstruation ,
CEB	Ezekiel	36	18	and so I poured out my fury on them for all the blood they had poured out on the land and for all the defilement of their idols .
CEB	Ezekiel	36	19	When I scattered them to the nations and dispersed them into other lands , I judged them according to their ways and deeds .
CEB	Ezekiel	36	20	But then when they entered the other nations , they degraded my holy name because it was said of them , “ These are the Lord ’ s people , yet they had to leave his land. ”
CEB	Ezekiel	36	21	So I had compassion on my holy name , which the house of Israel degraded among the nations where they had gone .
CEB	Ezekiel	36	22	Therefore , say to the house of Israel , The Lord God proclaims : House of Israel , I ’ m not acting for your sake but for the sake of my holy name , which you degraded among the nations where you have gone .
CEB	Ezekiel	36	23	I will make my great name holy , which was degraded among the nations when you dishonored it among them . Then the nations will know that I am the Lord . This is what the Lord God says . When I make myself holy among you in their sight ,
CEB	Ezekiel	36	24	I will take you from the nations , I will gather you from all the countries , and I will bring you to your own fertile land .
CEB	Ezekiel	36	25	I will sprinkle clean water on you , and you will be cleansed of all your pollution . I will cleanse you of all your idols .
CEB	Ezekiel	36	26	I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you . I will remove your stony heart from your body and replace it with a living one ,
CEB	Ezekiel	36	27	and I will give you my spirit so that you may walk according to my regulations and carefully observe my case laws .
CEB	Ezekiel	36	28	Then you will live in the land that I gave to your ancestors , you will be my people , and I will be your God .
CEB	Ezekiel	36	29	I will save you from all your uncleanness , and I will summon the grain and make it grow abundantly so that you won ’ t endure famine .
CEB	Ezekiel	36	30	I will make abundant the orchards ’ fruit and the fields ’ produce so that you will never again endure the shame of famine among the nations .
CEB	Ezekiel	36	31	Then you will remember your evil ways and no-good deeds , and you will feel disgust for yourselves because of your sinful and detestable practices .
CEB	Ezekiel	36	32	Not for your sake do I act . This is what the Lord God proclaims . Let that be known to you ! Be ashamed and be humiliated because of all your ways , house of Israel .
CEB	Ezekiel	36	33	The Lord God proclaims : On the day that I cleanse you of all your guilt , I will cause the cities to be inhabited , and the ruins will be rebuilt .
CEB	Ezekiel	36	34	The desolate land will be farmed , and it won ’ t be like it was when it seemed a wasteland to all who passed by .
CEB	Ezekiel	36	35	They will say , “ This land , which was a desolation , has become like the garden of Eden. ” And the cities that were ruined , ravaged , and razed are now fortified and inhabited .
CEB	Ezekiel	36	37	The Lord God proclaims : I will also allow the house of Israel to ask me to do this for them : that I increase them like a human flock .
CEB	Ezekiel	36	38	Like the holy flock , like the flock of Jerusalem at its festivals , the ruined cities will be filled with a human flock . Then they will know that I am the Lord . Footnotes - Ezekiel 36:5 MT adds to drive it out .
CEB	Ezekiel	37	37	The Lord ’ s power overcame me , and while I was in the Lord ’ s spirit , he led me out and set me down in the middle of a certain valley . It was full of bones .
CEB	Ezekiel	37	2	He led me through them all around , and I saw that there were a great many of them on the valley floor , and they were very dry .
CEB	Ezekiel	37	3	He asked me , “ Human one , can these bones live again ? ” I said , “ Lord God , only you know. ”
CEB	Ezekiel	37	4	He said to me , “ Prophesy over these bones , and say to them , Dry bones , hear the Lord ’ s word !
CEB	Ezekiel	37	5	The Lord God proclaims to these bones : I am about to put breath in you , and you will live again .
CEB	Ezekiel	37	6	I will put sinews on you , place flesh on you , and cover you with skin . When I put breath in you , and you come to life , you will know that I am the Lord. ”
CEB	Ezekiel	37	7	I prophesied just as I was commanded . There was a great noise as I was prophesying , then a great quaking , and the bones came together , bone by bone .
CEB	Ezekiel	37	8	When I looked , suddenly there were sinews on them . The flesh appeared , and then they were covered over with skin . But there was still no breath in them .
CEB	Ezekiel	37	9	He said to me , “ Prophesy to the breath ; prophesy , human one ! Say to the breath , The Lord God proclaims : Come from the four winds , breath ! Breathe into these dead bodies and let them live. ”
CEB	Ezekiel	37	10	I prophesied just as he commanded me . When the breath entered them , they came to life and stood on their feet , an extraordinarily large company .
CEB	Ezekiel	37	11	He said to me , “ Human one , these bones are the entire house of Israel . They say , ‘ Our bones are dried up , and our hope has perished . We are completely finished. ’
CEB	Ezekiel	37	12	So now , prophesy and say to them , The Lord God proclaims : I ’ m opening your graves ! I will raise you up from your graves , my people , and I will bring you to Israel ’ s fertile land .
CEB	Ezekiel	37	13	You will know that I am the Lord , when I open your graves and raise you up from your graves , my people .
CEB	Ezekiel	37	14	I will put my breath [ a ] in you , and you will live . I will plant you on your fertile land , and you will know that I am the Lord . I ’ ve spoken , and I will do it . This is what the Lord says. ” Divided kingdom united
CEB	Ezekiel	37	15	The Lord ’ s word came to me :
CEB	Ezekiel	37	16	You , human one , take a stick , and write on it , “ Belonging to Judah and to the Israelites associated with him. ” Take another stick and write on it , “ Stick of Ephraim belonging to Joseph and everyone of the house of Israel associated with him. ”
CEB	Ezekiel	37	17	Join them to each other to make a single stick so that they become one stick in your hand .
CEB	Ezekiel	37	18	When your people ask you , “ Why won ’ t you tell us what these sticks mean to you ? ”
CEB	Ezekiel	37	19	say to them , The Lord God proclaims : I ’ m taking Joseph ’ s stick , which has been in Ephraim ’ s hand , and the tribes of Israel associated with him , and I ’ m putting it with Judah ’ s stick , and I ’ m making them into a single stick so that they will be one stick in my hand .
CEB	Ezekiel	37	20	When the two sticks that you ’ ve written on are in your hand in their sight ,
CEB	Ezekiel	37	21	speak to them , This is what the Lord God says : I will take the Israelites from among the nations where they ’ ve gone , I will gather them from all around , and I will bring them to their fertile land .
CEB	Ezekiel	37	22	I will make them into a single nation in the land on Israel ’ s highlands . There will be just one king for all of them . They will no longer be two nations , and they will no longer be divided into two kingdoms .
CEB	Ezekiel	37	23	They will no longer defile themselves with their idols or their worthless things or with any of their rebellions . I will deliver them from all the places where they sinned , and I will cleanse them . They will be my people , and I will be their God .
CEB	Ezekiel	37	24	My servant David will be king over them . There will be just one shepherd for all of them . They will follow my case laws and carefully observe my regulations .
CEB	Ezekiel	37	25	They will live on the land that I gave to my servant Jacob , where their ancestors lived . They will live on it , they and their children and their grandchildren , forever . My servant David will be their prince forever .
CEB	Ezekiel	37	26	I will make a covenant of peace for them . It will be their covenant forever . I will grant it to them and allow them to increase . I will set my sanctuary among them forever .
CEB	Ezekiel	37	27	My dwelling will be with them , and I will be their God , and they will be my people .
CEB	Ezekiel	37	28	The nations will know that I , the Lord , make Israel holy , when my sanctuary is among them forever . Footnotes - Ezekiel 37:14 Or spirit
CEB	Ezekiel	38	38	The Lord ’ s word came to me :
CEB	Ezekiel	38	2	Human one , face Gog in the land of Magog , chief prince of Meshech and Tubal . Prophesy concerning him
CEB	Ezekiel	38	3	and say , The Lord God proclaims : I challenge you , Gog , chief prince of Meshech and Tubal !
CEB	Ezekiel	38	4	I will turn you about , set hooks in your jaws , and lead you out , you and all your army , horses and riders , handsomely dressed , all of them , a great assembly , with buckler and shield , all of them wielding swords .
CEB	Ezekiel	38	5	Persia , Cush , and Put are with you , [ a ] all of them equipped with shield and helmet .
CEB	Ezekiel	38	6	Gomer and all his troops , Beth-togarmah from the far north and all his troops ; many peoples are with you .
CEB	Ezekiel	38	7	Stand ready and be prepared , you and all your assembly . You will watch out for those who gather against you .
CEB	Ezekiel	38	8	After many days you will be called out . In future years you will enter a country that has been freed from the sword , a gathering from many peoples on the mountains of Israel , which had become a perpetual ruin . This country was brought out from the peoples , and all of them live securely .
CEB	Ezekiel	38	9	You will invade like a sudden storm . You and all your troops , and the many peoples with you , will be like clouds covering the earth .
CEB	Ezekiel	38	10	The Lord God proclaims : On that day , thoughts will come into your mind , and you will devise an evil plan .
CEB	Ezekiel	38	11	You will say , “ I will go up against the open country and come against a quiet people who all live securely without walls , bars , or doors
CEB	Ezekiel	38	12	to take plunder and seize loot , to use my [ b ] power against the resettled waste places , against a people gathered from the nations , who are acquiring goods and cattle , and who live at the center [ c ] of the earth. ”
CEB	Ezekiel	38	13	Sheba and Dedan and the merchants and officials of Tarshish will say to you , “ Have you come to take plunder and seize loot ? Have you assembled your army to take silver and gold , to take goods and cattle , to engage in great looting ? ”
CEB	Ezekiel	38	14	So now , prophesy , human one , and say to Gog , The Lord God proclaims : Isn ’ t that what you will decide to do [ d ] on that day , when my people Israel live securely ?
CEB	Ezekiel	38	15	You will come up from your place from the far north , you and many peoples with you , all of them riding horses , a great assembly , a mighty army .
CEB	Ezekiel	38	16	You will go up against my people Israel like a cloud covering the earth . But when this happens in future days , I will be the one who brings you up against my land , so that the nations may know me , Gog , when through you I show my holiness in their sight !
CEB	Ezekiel	38	17	The Lord God proclaims : Are you the one about whom I spoke in former times through my servants , Israel ’ s prophets , the ones who prophesied for years in those days to bring you against them ?
CEB	Ezekiel	38	18	On that day , the day when Gog comes against Israel ’ s fertile land , my wrath will be aroused . This is what the Lord God says .
CEB	Ezekiel	38	19	In my jealousy and blazing anger I declare : On that day , a great quaking will come over Israel ’ s fertile land .
CEB	Ezekiel	38	20	The fish of the sea , the birds in the sky , the beasts of the field , all the creatures crawling on the ground , and every living human being will quake in my presence . Mountains will be thrown down and cliffs will crumble ; every wall will fall to the ground .
CEB	Ezekiel	38	21	I will summon a sword against Gog on all my mountains . This is what the Lord God says ! The swords of the warriors will be against each other ,
CEB	Ezekiel	38	22	and I will enter into judgment with him , with plague and blood . I will pour out flooding rain , hailstones , fire , and sulfur on him , on all his troops , and on the many peoples with him .
CEB	Ezekiel	38	23	So I will display my greatness , show my holiness , and make myself known in the sight of many nations . And they will know that I am the Lord . Footnotes - Ezekiel 38:5 Cf 38:6 ; MT them - Ezekiel 38:12 LXX ; MT your - Ezekiel 38:12 Or navel - Ezekiel 38:14 Or you will know
CEB	Ezekiel	39	39	You , human one , prophesy about Gog and say , The Lord God proclaims : I challenge you , Gog , chief prince of Meshech and Tubal !
CEB	Ezekiel	39	2	I will turn you about , drag you out , and bring you out of the far north , and I will bring you to Israel ’ s mountains .
CEB	Ezekiel	39	3	I will strike your bow from your left hand , and make your arrows fall from your right .
CEB	Ezekiel	39	4	You will fall on Israel ’ s mountains , you , all your troops , and the peoples who are with you . I will give you to the birds of prey , to every kind of bird and wild animal as food .
CEB	Ezekiel	39	5	You will fall on the open field , for I have spoken ! This is what the Lord God says !
CEB	Ezekiel	39	6	I will send fire on Magog and on those who live securely in the coastlands , and they will know that I am the Lord .
CEB	Ezekiel	39	7	I will make known my holy name among my people Israel . They will never again degrade my holy name , and the nations will know that I , the Lord , am holy in Israel .
CEB	Ezekiel	39	8	Look , it has come ! It has happened ! This is what the Lord God says . This is the day that I spoke about .
CEB	Ezekiel	39	9	Those who live in Israel ’ s cities will go out and kindle a fire with the weapons—shield and buckler , bow and arrow , spear and lance . They will burn them with fire for seven years .
CEB	Ezekiel	39	10	They won ’ t gather wood from the field or chop down trees from the forest , because they will be able to keep the fire burning with the weapons . So they will take plunder and seize loot . This is what the Lord says .
CEB	Ezekiel	39	11	On that day , I will assign Gog a place for burial in Israel in the Travelers ’ Valley east of the sea . It will block the travelers ’ way , because Gog and all of his horde will be buried there . It will be called Hamon-gog [ a ] Valley .
CEB	Ezekiel	39	12	For seven months , the house of Israel will bury them in order to cleanse the land .
CEB	Ezekiel	39	13	All the people of the land will take part in the burial , so they will make a name for themselves on the day that I glorify myself . This is what the Lord God says .
CEB	Ezekiel	39	14	They will appoint people who will continually cross through the land and bury [ b ] the human remains that are left on the surface of the ground in order to purify it . They will begin their search at the end of seven months .
CEB	Ezekiel	39	15	As the travelers cross through the land , when they see a human bone , they will set up a marker next to it until the gravediggers bury it in Hamon-gog Valley
CEB	Ezekiel	39	16	( the name of the city is Hamonah ) . So they will purify the land .
CEB	Ezekiel	39	17	And you , human one , the Lord God proclaims : Say to the birds of prey , to every kind of bird and every wild animal : Assemble and come ! Come together from all around for the sacrifice that I make for you , a great sacrifice on Israel ’ s mountains ! You will eat flesh and drink blood .
CEB	Ezekiel	39	18	You will eat the flesh of warriors and drink the blood of the princes of the earth : rams , lambs , goats , bulls , all fattened animals from Bashan .
CEB	Ezekiel	39	19	Gorge yourselves on their fat , and get drunk on their blood , from the sacrifice that I have made for you .
CEB	Ezekiel	39	20	Satisfy yourselves at my table with horses and riders , mighty men and every warrior . This is what the Lord God says !
CEB	Ezekiel	39	21	When I glorify myself among the nations , all the nations will understand the judgments that I executed and the power that I used among them .
CEB	Ezekiel	39	22	And the house of Israel will know that I , the Lord , am their God , from that day on .
CEB	Ezekiel	39	23	The nations will know that the house of Israel went into exile because of their guilt . Because they rebelled against me , I hid my face from them . When I handed them over to their enemies , all of them fell by the sword .
CEB	Ezekiel	39	24	I dealt with them according to their uncleanness and their transgressions and hid my face from them .
CEB	Ezekiel	39	25	So the Lord God proclaims : Now I will bring back the captives of Jacob . I will have compassion on the whole house of Israel and defend my holy name .
CEB	Ezekiel	39	26	They will forget their humiliation and all their rebellions against me when they live securely on their fertile land with no one to frighten them .
CEB	Ezekiel	39	27	When I bring them back from the peoples and gather them from the lands of their enemies , I will be made holy through them in the sight of the many nations .
CEB	Ezekiel	39	28	They will know that I am the Lord their God when , after I made them go into exile among the nations , I gathered them to their land . I won ’ t leave any of them behind .
CEB	Ezekiel	39	29	When I pour my Spirit upon the house of Israel , I won ’ t hide my face from them again . This is what the Lord God says . Footnotes - Ezekiel 39:11 Or horde of Gog - Ezekiel 39:14 LXX ; MT adds the travelers .
CEB	Ezekiel	40	40	Outside , two pairs of tables flanked the entrance of the north gate at both ends , at the steps on one end and the porch on the other .
CEB	Ezekiel	40	2	In God ’ s visions , he brought me to the land of Israel and set me down on a very high mountain , where there was a city structure to the south .
CEB	Ezekiel	40	3	When he brought me there , I saw a man standing in the gate . He appeared to be bronze , and he had a linen cord and a measuring rod in his hand .
CEB	Ezekiel	40	4	The man spoke to me , “ Human one , look and listen well , and take seriously everything I show you , because you were brought here so that these things could be revealed to you . Describe everything you see to the house of Israel. ” Temple compound
CEB	Ezekiel	40	5	Now there was an outer wall that went all the way around the temple compound . The measuring rod in the man ’ s hand was ten and a half feet [ a ] ( based on a standard eighteen inches [ b ] plus three inches [ c ] ) . When he measured the wall ’ s height and width it was ten and a half feet high and ten and a half feet wide .
CEB	Ezekiel	40	6	He entered the gate facing east . He went up its steps , and he measured the plaza [ d ] at the gate . It was ten and a half feet wide : the plaza was ten and a half feet wide .
CEB	Ezekiel	40	7	The rooms were ten and a half feet long and ten and a half feet wide , with a space of seven and a half feet between them . The plaza next to the porch at the gate opposite the temple was ten and a half feet .
CEB	Ezekiel	40	8	He measured the porch of the gate opposite the temple : it was ten and a half feet .
CEB	Ezekiel	40	9	Then he measured the porch of the gate : it was twelve feet , [ e ] and its arches were three feet . The porch of the gate was opposite the temple .
CEB	Ezekiel	40	10	Inside the east gate , there were three rooms on each side . Each was the same size , and the arches on each side were the same size also .
CEB	Ezekiel	40	11	Then he measured the width of the gate opening , which was fifteen feet , and the gate ’ s length , which was nineteen and a half feet .
CEB	Ezekiel	40	12	A border running along the front of the rooms on each side was eighteen inches wide , and each of the rooms was nine feet square .
CEB	Ezekiel	40	13	He measured the gate through the room openings that faced each other . From the outer ceiling edge of one room to the outer ceiling edge of the other , the gate was thirty-seven and a half feet wide .
CEB	Ezekiel	40	14	Next he made out the perimeter of the hallway , defined by the arches inside the gate : it was ninety feet .
CEB	Ezekiel	40	15	It was seventy-five feet from the front of the outer gate to the front of the inner porch of the gate .
CEB	Ezekiel	40	16	Inside the gate , all of the rooms and their arches had closed windows ; there were also niches inside the porch all the way around . The arches were decorated with palm trees .
CEB	Ezekiel	40	17	Then he brought me to the outer courtyard , which consisted of chambers and a pavement all the way around . Thirty chambers came up to the pavement ,
CEB	Ezekiel	40	18	and the pavement came up to the facades of the gates along their entire length . That was the lower pavement .
CEB	Ezekiel	40	19	When he measured the width from the inside of the lower gate to the outer edge of the inner courtyard , it was one hundred fifty feet . After he measured the east gate , he measured the north gate ,
CEB	Ezekiel	40	20	the one facing north at the outer courtyard . He measured its length and width ,
CEB	Ezekiel	40	21	its three inner rooms on each side , its arches , and its porch . Its measurements were the same as the first gate : seventy-five feet long and thirty-seven and a half feet wide .
CEB	Ezekiel	40	22	The windows , porch , and palm decorations had the same measurements as those of the east gate . Seven steps led up to the entrance , and the porch was at the other end .
CEB	Ezekiel	40	23	There were also gates to the inner courtyard opposite the north and east gates . When he measured from gate to gate , it was one hundred fifty feet .
CEB	Ezekiel	40	24	Then he had me walk toward the south , where there was a gate facing south . He measured its arches and porch using the same measurements .
CEB	Ezekiel	40	25	Its windows and its porch all around were like the others , and the gate also was seventy-five feet long and thirty-seven and a half feet wide .
CEB	Ezekiel	40	26	Its stairway had seven steps , and its porch was at the other end . On its arches , one on either side , were palm decorations .
CEB	Ezekiel	40	27	There was a gate to the inner courtyard on the south . When he measured from gate to gate on the south side , it was one hundred fifty feet .
CEB	Ezekiel	40	28	When he brought me to the inner courtyard by way of the south gate , he took the same measurements of the south gate .
CEB	Ezekiel	40	29	Its rooms , arches , and porch , as well as its windows and porch all the way around , measured the same as the others . It was seventy-five feet long and thirty-seven and a half feet wide .
CEB	Ezekiel	40	30	There were porches all around , thirty-seven and a half feet long and seven and a half feet wide .
CEB	Ezekiel	40	31	Its porch faced the outer courtyard . Palms decorated its arches , and its stairway had eight steps .
CEB	Ezekiel	40	32	Then he brought me to the inner courtyard on the east side , and again he took the same measurements of the gate .
CEB	Ezekiel	40	33	Its rooms , arches , and porch measured the same as the others , as well as its windows and porch all the way around . It was seventy-five feet long and thirty-seven and a half feet wide .
CEB	Ezekiel	40	34	Its porch faced the outer courtyard . Palm trees decorated its arches on both sides , and its stairway had eight steps .
CEB	Ezekiel	40	35	Then he brought me to the north gate and took the same measurements of the
CEB	Ezekiel	40	36	rooms , arches , and porch , and also its windows all around . It was seventy-five feet long and thirty-seven and a half feet wide .
CEB	Ezekiel	40	37	Its porch [ f ] faced the outer courtyard . Palm trees decorated its arches on both sides , and its stairway had eight steps .
CEB	Ezekiel	40	38	At that gate , there was a room with an entrance in the arches for washing the entirely burned offering ,
CEB	Ezekiel	40	39	and inside the porch on each side of the gate were two tables where the entirely burned offerings , the purification offerings , and the compensation offerings were slaughtered .
CEB	Ezekiel	40	41	There were four tables on each side of the gate , eight tables in all , for preparing the animal offerings .
CEB	Ezekiel	40	42	The four tables that were used for the entirely burned offering as well as for the communal sacrifices were made of hewn stone . Each was twenty-seven inches square and eighteen inches high . Equipment used in the ritual slaughter was set on them .
CEB	Ezekiel	40	43	Hooks , [ g ] three inches wide , were securely fixed all the way around . The tables were for the flesh of the offerings .
CEB	Ezekiel	40	44	Outside the inner gate there were two [ h ] chambers in the inner courtyard . The one beside the north gate faced south , and the one beside the east gate faced north .
CEB	Ezekiel	40	45	He spoke to me : “ The chamber facing south is for the priests who keep watch over the temple ,
CEB	Ezekiel	40	46	and the chamber facing north is for the priests who keep watch over the altar . Of all the Levites , only the Zadokites may draw near to serve the Lord. ”
CEB	Ezekiel	40	47	Then he measured the courtyard . It was square , one hundred fifty feet long and one hundred fifty feet wide . The altar was in front of the temple . The temple
CEB	Ezekiel	40	48	Then he brought me to the porch of the temple and measured its arches . They were seven and a half feet on each side , and the width of the gate was four and a half feet on each side .
CEB	Ezekiel	40	49	The porch was thirty feet long and eighteen feet wide . Steps led up into the porch , and there were columns for the arches , one on each side . Footnotes - Ezekiel 40:5 Heb shesh ammoth ba'ammah traditionally six long cubits , which is defined as six times a standard ammah of eighteen inches plus a topha ( traditionally handbreadth ) of three inches . So the measuring rod has six segments of twenty-one inches each , which equals ten and a half feet . It is unclear whether the measurements with the rod continue past 40:8 , when standard ammah appear , though the longer ammah do continue briefly in 43:13-17 for the altar . - Ezekiel 40:5 Or a standard cubit - Ezekiel 40:5 Or a handbreadth - Ezekiel 40:6 Or threshold ; Heb architectural and decorative terminology in Ezek 40–48 is often uncertain . - Ezekiel 40:9 Or eight cubits - Ezekiel 40:37 LXX ; MT arches - Ezekiel 40:43 Heb uncertain - Ezekiel 40:44 LXX ; MT singing
CEB	Ezekiel	41	41	He brought me to the main hall , and he measured the arches . They were nine feet deep on both sides , so that was also the depth of the tent .
CEB	Ezekiel	41	2	The entrance was fifteen feet wide , and the facades on either side of the entrance were seven and a half feet . When he measured its length , it was sixty feet , and its width was thirty feet .
CEB	Ezekiel	41	3	Then he went into the inner room , and he measured the arches on both sides of the entrance ; they were each three feet . The entrance was nine feet wide , and its depth was ten and a half feet .
CEB	Ezekiel	41	4	When he measured the length of the inner room , it was thirty feet , and the width of the side adjoining the main hall was also thirty feet . He said to me , “ This is the most holy place. ”
CEB	Ezekiel	41	5	When he measured the wall of the temple , it was nine feet , and the side chambers that went all the way around the temple were six feet .
CEB	Ezekiel	41	6	Now these side chambers adjoined each other , thirty chambers in three stories . The side chambers had a ledge in the temple wall all the way around to serve as supports , but these supports were not inserted into the temple wall itself .
CEB	Ezekiel	41	7	A wide ramp ascended stage by stage to the side chambers all the way around the temple . In this way , the ascent stage by stage all around the temple added to the temple ’ s width . One ascended from the foundation to the top by way of the middle story .
CEB	Ezekiel	41	8	Then I looked at the temple : Its roof all around rested on the side chambers . Each raised section was ten and a half feet , and the indentations between them were nine feet . [ a ]
CEB	Ezekiel	41	9	The width of the outer wall of the side chambers was seven and a half feet . The space left free between the temple ’ s side chambers and
CEB	Ezekiel	41	10	the other chambers was thirty feet wide all the way around the temple .
CEB	Ezekiel	41	11	There were two entrances from the side chambers to the free space , one facing north , the other facing south . And the width of the place that was left free was seven and a half feet all the way around .
CEB	Ezekiel	41	12	The structure facing the yard on the west was one hundred five feet wide . The structure ’ s wall was seven and a half feet wide all the way around , and its length was one hundred thirty-five feet .
CEB	Ezekiel	41	13	Then he measured the temple . It was one hundred fifty feet long . The yard , the structure , and its walls were also one hundred fifty feet .
CEB	Ezekiel	41	14	The area in front of the house and the yard to the east was one hundred fifty feet also .
CEB	Ezekiel	41	15	Then he measured the length of the structure along the side of the yard , including its promenades on both sides : one hundred fifty feet . Now the interior of the main hall as well as the porches in the courtyard
CEB	Ezekiel	41	16	were paneled all around , including the ceilings , [ b ] closed windows , and its three courses of promenades that adjoined the ceiling . From the ground up to the windows was covered .
CEB	Ezekiel	41	17	Above the entrance , from the interior to the exterior of the temple , and on every interior and exterior wall ,
CEB	Ezekiel	41	18	there were carved winged creatures and palm trees . The palm trees were positioned between the winged creatures , and each winged creature had two faces .
CEB	Ezekiel	41	19	A human face turned toward one palm tree , and the face of a lion turned toward another . They were carved on the temple all the way around .
CEB	Ezekiel	41	20	From the ground to above the entrance , the walls of the main hall were carved with winged creatures and palm trees .
CEB	Ezekiel	41	21	In the main hall itself , there were square doorposts in front of the holy place , where there was the appearance of
CEB	Ezekiel	41	22	the altar . It was four and a half feet high and three feet wide . It was made of wood , and its corners , base , and sides were also wood . He said to me , “ This is the table that stands before the Lord. ”
CEB	Ezekiel	41	23	The main hall and the holy place each had two doors ,
CEB	Ezekiel	41	24	and each door had two turning panels , two for one door and two for the other .
CEB	Ezekiel	41	25	Like the walls , the doors of the main hall were carved with winged creatures and palm trees . A single luxuriant [ c ] tree stood outside , in front of the porch ,
CEB	Ezekiel	41	26	while closed windows and palm trees decorated both sides of the facade of the porch , the temple ’ s side chambers , and the beams . Footnotes - Ezekiel 41:8 Heb uncertain - Ezekiel 41:16 Or thresholds - Ezekiel 41:25 Heb uncertain
CEB	Ezekiel	42	42	Then he led me north to the outer courtyard and brought me into the set of chambers opposite the yard and the structure to the north .
CEB	Ezekiel	42	2	The length of the facade at the north entrance was one hundred fifty feet , its depth seventy-five feet .
CEB	Ezekiel	42	3	It was next to the twenty chambers that belonged to the inner courtyard and next to the pavement of the outer courtyard , and it had three courses of promenades .
CEB	Ezekiel	42	4	In front of the chambers there was a passage fifteen feet wide , and to the inside , a passage eighteen inches wide . The entrance to the chambers was on the north .
CEB	Ezekiel	42	5	The upper chambers were smaller , because the promenades took up more space from them than from the first and second stories .
CEB	Ezekiel	42	6	This was because the promenades were arranged in three levels , but they didn ’ t have columns like those in the courtyards . For this reason , the top story was narrower than the first and second stories .
CEB	Ezekiel	42	7	A stone wall ran parallel to the chambers facing the outer courtyard . It was seventy-five feet long ,
CEB	Ezekiel	42	8	the same length , seventy-five feet , as the chambers facing the outer courtyard . Those facing the temple were one hundred fifty feet . 9-10 These chambers were entered from the outer courtyard at the end of the courtyard wall , because the entrance was at the end of the chambers at the east . South of the yard and the building , there were more chambers with a passage
CEB	Ezekiel	42	11	in front of them . The design of the chambers resembled the ones to the north in length and width , as well as in all their exits . The arrangement of the entrances
CEB	Ezekiel	42	12	to the chambers on the south side was identical as well . One entered from the east at the beginning of the corresponding wall .
CEB	Ezekiel	42	13	Then he said to me , “ The north and south chambers that face the building and the yard are the holy chambers where the priests eat the offerings that have been brought to the Lord . They are most holy . Here they will place the most holy things , the grain offering , the purification offering , and the compensation offering . The place is holy .
CEB	Ezekiel	42	14	When the priests enter , they won ’ t go out of the sanctuary to the outer courtyard . There they will place the priestly vests that they wore when they were ministering , because these garments are also holy . They will put on other garments when they go out to the people ’ s area. ”
CEB	Ezekiel	42	15	When he finished making the interior measurements of the temple , he led me out toward the east gate , and he measured all the way around .
CEB	Ezekiel	42	16	He used the same measuring rod on all four sides . He measured the east side , seven hundred fifty feet ;
CEB	Ezekiel	42	17	the north side , seven hundred fifty feet ; and
CEB	Ezekiel	42	18	the south side , seven hundred fifty feet .
CEB	Ezekiel	42	19	He turned to the west side , seven hundred fifty feet .
CEB	Ezekiel	42	20	On all four sides he measured the wall all the way around . Its length was seven hundred fifty feet , and its width seven hundred fifty feet . So he made a division between the holy and the ordinary .
CEB	Ezekiel	43	43	Then he led me to the east gate ,
CEB	Ezekiel	43	2	where the glory of Israel ’ s God was coming in from the east . Its sound was like the sound of a mighty flood , and the earth was lit up with his glory .
CEB	Ezekiel	43	3	What appeared when I looked was like what I had seen when he [ a ] came to destroy the city , and also like what I saw at the Chebar River , and I fell on my face .
CEB	Ezekiel	43	4	Then the Lord ’ s glory came into the temple by way of the east gate .
CEB	Ezekiel	43	5	A wind picked me up and brought me to the inner courtyard , and there the Lord ’ s glory filled the temple .
CEB	Ezekiel	43	6	A man was standing next to me , but the voice that I heard came from inside the temple .
CEB	Ezekiel	43	7	He said to me , Human one , this is the place for my throne and the place for the soles of my feet , where I will dwell among the Israelites forever . The house of Israel will never again defile my holy name , neither they nor their kings , with their disloyalties [ b ] and with their kings ’ corpses at the shrines .
CEB	Ezekiel	43	8	When they set their plazas [ c ] with mine and their doorposts next to mine , the wall was between us . They defiled my holy name with their detestable practices , so I consumed them in my anger .
CEB	Ezekiel	43	9	Now let them remove their disloyalties and their kings ’ corpses from me , and I will dwell among them forever .
CEB	Ezekiel	43	10	You , human one , describe the temple to the house of Israel . Let them be humiliated because of their guilt when they think about its design .
CEB	Ezekiel	43	11	When they feel humiliated by all that they have done , make known to them the shape of the temple and its adornment , its exits and its entrances , its entire plan and all of its regulations . [ d ] Write them down in their sight so that they may observe all of its entire plan and all its regulations and perform them .
CEB	Ezekiel	43	12	These are the instructions for the temple : the top of the mountain , as well as its boundaries all around , are most holy . These are the instructions for the temple . The altar
CEB	Ezekiel	43	13	These are the dimensions of the altar , according to a twenty-one-inch unit of measure . [ e ] The base is twenty-one inches high and twenty-one inches wide , with an outer curb measuring one and a half inches all around . This is the altar ’ s height .
CEB	Ezekiel	43	14	From the base at ground level to the lower ledge is forty-two inches ; the lower ledge is twenty-one inches wide . The distance from the lower to the upper ledge is seven feet ; the upper ledge is twenty-one inches wide .
CEB	Ezekiel	43	15	The hearth is seven feet high , with four horns projecting upward from the hearth .
CEB	Ezekiel	43	16	The hearth is twenty-one feet square ; each side is equal to the others .
CEB	Ezekiel	43	17	The ledge around the hearth is twenty-four and a half feet long by twenty-four and a half feet wide , a square . Its outer rim is ten and a half inches , and its base all around is twenty-one inches . Its ramp faces east . Purification of the altar
CEB	Ezekiel	43	18	He said to me , Human one , the Lord God proclaims : These are the regulations established for the altar on the day when it is prepared for making entirely burned offerings and dashing blood on it .
CEB	Ezekiel	43	19	You will provide a young bull as a purification offering to the levitical priests who are descendants of Zadok , the ones who may draw near to minster to me . This is what the Lord God says .
CEB	Ezekiel	43	20	You will take some of its blood and set it on the four horns of the altar and on the four sides of the ledge and on the curb all around . So you will purify it and purge it .
CEB	Ezekiel	43	21	Then you will take the bull selected as the purification offering , and the priests will burn it in a designated place of the temple outside of the sanctuary .
CEB	Ezekiel	43	22	On the second day , you will present a flawless male goat as a purification offering . The priests will purify the altar just as they purified the altar with the bull .
CEB	Ezekiel	43	23	When you have completed the purification , you will present a flawless bull from the herd and a flawless ram from the flock .
CEB	Ezekiel	43	24	You will present them to the Lord . The priests will throw salt on them and offer them as entirely burned offerings to the Lord .
CEB	Ezekiel	43	25	Daily , for seven days , you will present a male goat for a purification offering . You will also present a bull from the herd and a ram from the flock , both flawless .
CEB	Ezekiel	43	26	For seven days the priests will purge the altar in order to purify it and to dedicate it .
CEB	Ezekiel	43	27	When the seven days are completed , the priests will offer your entirely burned offerings and your well-being sacrifices on the altar from the eighth day on , and I will accept you with pleasure . This is what the Lord God says .

CEB	Ezekiel	44	44	He brought me back to the outer sanctuary gate that faces east . It was closed .
CEB	Ezekiel	44	2	The Lord said to me , This gate remains closed . It shouldn ’ t be opened . No one should come in through it because the Lord , Israel ’ s God , has entered through it . It will remain closed .
CEB	Ezekiel	44	3	As for the prince , he may sit in it to eat bread in the Lord ’ s presence . He may come in and go out by way of the gate ’ s porch . Foreigners , Levites , Zadokites
CEB	Ezekiel	44	4	Then he brought me by way of the north gate to the front of the temple . I looked , and suddenly the Lord ’ s glory filled the Lord ’ s temple , and I fell on my face .
CEB	Ezekiel	44	5	Then the Lord said to me : Human one , pay close attention ! Use your eyes and ears and listen to all that I say to you concerning the regulations of the Lord ’ s temple and all its instructions . Pay close attention to the access to the temple through all the sanctuary portals . [ a ]
CEB	Ezekiel	44	6	Speak to the rebels , to the house of Israel , The Lord God proclaims : Enough of your detestable practices , house of Israel !
CEB	Ezekiel	44	7	You made my temple unclean because you brought into my sanctuary foreigners who were physically and spiritually uncircumcised . When you offered my food of fat and blood to me , you [ b ] broke my covenant with all your detestable practices .
CEB	Ezekiel	44	8	You didn ’ t keep charge of my holy things . On the contrary , you appointed them [ c ] to keep charge in my sanctuary for you .
CEB	Ezekiel	44	9	The Lord God proclaims : Foreigners who are spiritually and physically uncircumcised must not enter my sanctuary ; that is , all foreigners among the Israelites .
CEB	Ezekiel	44	10	But the Levites , who went far from me when Israel went astray , who went astray from me after their idols , will bear their guilt .
CEB	Ezekiel	44	11	They will keep charge in my sanctuary , and they will oversee the temple gates and keep charge of the temple . They will slaughter the entirely burned offerings and the sacrifices for the people , and they will stand before them to minister to them .
CEB	Ezekiel	44	12	Because they ministered to them before their idols , they brought about the downfall of the house of Israel . For that reason I made a solemn pledge against them—this is what the Lord God says—and they will bear their guilt .
CEB	Ezekiel	44	13	They won ’ t approach me to officiate for me as priests or approach any of my holy things or the most holy place . Though they will bear their humiliation and the consequences of their detestable practices ,
CEB	Ezekiel	44	14	I will appoint them to keep charge of the temple , all its work , and all that is done in it .
CEB	Ezekiel	44	15	As for the priests of the levitical family of Zadok who did keep charge of my sanctuary when the Israelites strayed away from me , they will draw near to me to serve me . They will stand in my presence to present fat and blood to me . This is what the Lord God says .
CEB	Ezekiel	44	16	They will come into my sanctuary , and they will approach my table to minister to me . They will keep my charge .
CEB	Ezekiel	44	17	When they come through the gates to the inner courtyard , they will wear linen garments . They won ’ t wear any wool when they minister at the gates of the inner courtyard or in the temple .
CEB	Ezekiel	44	18	They will have linen turbans on their heads and linen undergarments around their waists . They won ’ t wear anything that makes them sweat .
CEB	Ezekiel	44	19	When they go out to the outer courtyard to the people , they will remove the garments in which they were ministering . They will lay them aside in the holy chambers and wear other clothing . They must not transfer holiness to the people through their clothing .
CEB	Ezekiel	44	20	They must neither shave their heads nor let their hair grow long , but they will trim the hair on their heads .
CEB	Ezekiel	44	21	None of the priests should drink wine when they come into the inner courtyard .
CEB	Ezekiel	44	22	They must not marry widows or divorced women , but only Israelite virgins . Priests may , however , marry the widows of other priests .
CEB	Ezekiel	44	23	They must teach my people the difference between the holy and the ordinary , and show them the difference between clean and unclean .
CEB	Ezekiel	44	24	They must execute judgments according to my case laws in cases of civil conflict . They must observe my instructions and my regulations regarding all my festivals . They must keep my sabbaths holy .
CEB	Ezekiel	44	25	In order to avoid uncleanness , they must not approach the dead . They may , however , become unclean for their father or mother , son or daughter , brother or unmarried sister .
CEB	Ezekiel	44	26	Once the priest is clean again , he must count off seven days .
CEB	Ezekiel	44	27	On the day that he comes into the holy place , the inner courtyard , to minister in the holy place , he will present his purification offering . This is what the Lord God says .
CEB	Ezekiel	44	28	As for their inheritance , I am their inheritance . They won ’ t be given family property in Israel ; I am their family property .
CEB	Ezekiel	44	29	They will eat the grain offerings , the purification offerings , and the compensation offerings . Every dedicated thing in Israel belongs to them .
CEB	Ezekiel	44	30	The best of the early produce of every kind , and every contribution , all of them , belong to the priests . You will give the best of your bread dough to the priest so that a blessing may come to rest on your household .
CEB	Ezekiel	44	31	The priests must not eat any bird or animal that dies naturally or is torn apart by prey . Footnotes - Ezekiel 44:5 Or exits - Ezekiel 44:7 LXX , Syr , Vulg ; MT they - Ezekiel 44:8 Heb lacks them .
CEB	Ezekiel	45	45	When you distribute the land as an inheritance , you will set aside a holy portion of land for the Lord . It will be 7.1 miles long and 5.68 miles [ a ] wide . It will be holy throughout the entire area .
CEB	Ezekiel	45	2	Out of this portion , an area seven hundred fifty feet by seven hundred fifty feet square will be for the sanctuary . All around it will be an open space seventy-five feet wide .
CEB	Ezekiel	45	3	Beginning with this measurement , you will measure out an area 7.1 miles long and 2.84 miles wide . The sanctuary , the most holy place , will lie on it .
CEB	Ezekiel	45	4	It is holy , set apart from the land , and it belongs to the priests who draw near to minister in the Lord ’ s sanctuary . It will be a place for their houses , and a holy place for the sanctuary .
CEB	Ezekiel	45	5	The area 7.1 miles long and 2.84 miles wide will be for the Levites who minister in the temple . Twenty chambers are theirs as their property .
CEB	Ezekiel	45	6	As the property for the city , you will set aside an area 1.42 miles wide and 7.1 miles long next to the holy portion . It will be for the whole house of Israel .
CEB	Ezekiel	45	7	The territory for the prince will be on both sides of the holy portion and the city property , alongside the holy portion and alongside the city property , from their western boundaries westward and from their eastern boundaries eastward . Its length will equal one tribal portion , from the western border to the eastern border .
CEB	Ezekiel	45	8	The land will be his property in Israel , and my princes will no longer oppress my people . They will give the land to the house of Israel according to their tribes .
CEB	Ezekiel	45	9	The Lord God proclaims : Enough , princes of Israel ! Turn aside from violence and oppression . Establish justice and righteousness . Cease your evictions of my people ! This is what the Lord God says :
CEB	Ezekiel	45	10	You must use fair scales , a fair ephah , [ b ] and a fair bath . [ c ]
CEB	Ezekiel	45	11	The ephah and the bath must be the same size . Both should be calibrated to the homer : each will contain one-tenth of a homer .
CEB	Ezekiel	45	12	The shekel must weigh twenty gerahs . Twenty shekels , twenty-five shekels , and fifteen shekels will equal one maneh for you . Sacrificial offerings and gifts
CEB	Ezekiel	45	13	These are your prescribed contributions : one-sixth of an ephah for each homer of wheat , and one-sixth of an ephah for each homer of barley ;
CEB	Ezekiel	45	14	a regular amount of oil , [ d ] one-tenth of a bath for each kor [ e ] ( each kor [ f ] contains ten baths ) ;
CEB	Ezekiel	45	15	and one sheep from the flock for every two hundred from Israel ’ s pastureland , for grain offerings , for entirely burned offerings , and for well-being sacrifices to make reconciliation for them . This is what the Lord God says .
CEB	Ezekiel	45	16	All the people will make this contribution on behalf of the prince in Israel .
CEB	Ezekiel	45	17	The prince will be responsible for the entirely burned offerings , grain offerings , and drink offerings for the festivals , new moons , and sabbaths , all the appointed festivals of the house of Israel . He will offer the purification offering , the grain offering , the entirely burned offering , and the well-being sacrifice to make reconciliation on behalf of the house of Israel . Festivals
CEB	Ezekiel	45	18	The Lord God proclaims : On the first day of the first month , [ g ] you will take a flawless young bull from the herd , and you will purify the sanctuary .
CEB	Ezekiel	45	19	The priest will take some of the blood from the purification offering , and he will set it on the doorposts of the temple and on the four corners of the ledge of the altar and on the doorposts of the gate to the inner courtyard .
CEB	Ezekiel	45	20	You will do the same on the seventh day of the month for anyone who sins through inadvertence or ignorance . So you will purge the temple .
CEB	Ezekiel	45	21	Your Passover will be on the fourteenth day of the first month . Unleavened bread will be eaten during the seven days of the festival .
CEB	Ezekiel	45	22	On that day , the prince will provide a young bull as the purification offering for himself and for the people of the land .
CEB	Ezekiel	45	23	For the seven days of the festival , he will provide seven flawless bulls and seven flawless rams , one for each day of the festival , as the entirely burned offering for the Lord , and , for the purification offering , one male goat for each day .
CEB	Ezekiel	45	24	He will also provide the grain offerings , one ephah [ h ] for each bull , and one ephah for each ram , with one hin [ i ] of oil for each ephah .
CEB	Ezekiel	45	25	For the festival that begins on the fifteenth day of the seventh month , [ j ] he will make the same provisions for the purification offerings , entirely burned offerings , grain offerings , and oil , for all seven days of the festival . Footnotes - Ezekiel 45:1 LXX twenty thousand ( pechon , standard cubit ) ; MT ten thousand ( ammah ) ; see note at Ezek 40:5 . - Ezekiel 45:10 One ephah is approximately twenty quarts of grain . - Ezekiel 45:10 One bath is approximately twenty quarts of liquid . - Ezekiel 45:14 Syr , Tg ; MT adds a bath of oil . - Ezekiel 45:14 MT adds each homer contains ten baths . - Ezekiel 45:14 Vulg ; MT homer - Ezekiel 45:18 March–April , Nisan - Ezekiel 45:24 One ephah is approximately twenty quarts of grain . - Ezekiel 45:24 One hin is approximately equal to one gallon . - Ezekiel 45:25 September–October , Tishrei
CEB	Ezekiel	46	46	The Lord God proclaims : The east-facing gate of the inner courtyard will remain closed for the six days of the workweek . But on the Sabbath and on the day of the new moon it will be opened ,
CEB	Ezekiel	46	2	and the prince will come in from outside by way of the porch of the gate and stand at the gate ’ s doorposts . The priests will present the prince ’ s entirely burned offerings and well-being sacrifices , and then he will bow down on the threshold of the gate and go out . The gate won ’ t be closed until evening
CEB	Ezekiel	46	3	so that the people of the land may bow in the presence of the Lord on sabbaths and new moons at the opening of that gate .
CEB	Ezekiel	46	4	On the Sabbath day , the prince will offer to the Lord an entirely burned offering of six flawless lambs and a flawless ram ,
CEB	Ezekiel	46	5	a grain offering of one ephah for the ram , and a grain offering at his discretion for the lambs , with one hin of oil for each ephah .
CEB	Ezekiel	46	6	For the day of the new moon , the offering will be a flawless young bull from the herd , six lambs , and a flawless ram ,
CEB	Ezekiel	46	7	and he will provide a grain offering of one ephah each for the bull and the ram , and for the lambs as much as he likes , with one hin of oil for each ephah .
CEB	Ezekiel	46	8	When the prince enters , he comes in by way of the porch of the gate and goes out in the same direction .
CEB	Ezekiel	46	9	When the people of the land come into the Lord ’ s presence for the festivals , those who enter through the north gate to worship should go out through the south , and those who come in through the south gate should go out through the north gate . They shouldn ’ t turn around and go out the same way they came in . Instead , they should go out the opposite gate .
CEB	Ezekiel	46	10	The prince should accompany them : when they come in , he comes in , and when they go out , he goes out .
CEB	Ezekiel	46	11	At the festivals and appointed gatherings , the grain offering is one ephah for each bull , one ephah for each ram , and whatever one is able to give for each lamb , with one hin of oil for each ephah .
CEB	Ezekiel	46	12	Whenever the prince makes a spontaneous gift to the Lord , whether it is an entirely burned offering or a well-being sacrifice , the gate facing east will be opened for him , and he will present his entirely burned offering and well-being sacrifices , just as he does on the Sabbath day . When he leaves , the gate will be closed after he has gone out . Daily offerings
CEB	Ezekiel	46	13	As a daily entirely burned offering for the Lord , you will provide a flawless year-old lamb . You will make the offering every morning .
CEB	Ezekiel	46	14	You will provide a grain offering along with it every morning , one-sixth of an ephah along with one-third of a hin of oil to moisten the choice flour . This is a permanent and perpetual regulation for the grain offering to the Lord .
CEB	Ezekiel	46	15	So the lamb , the grain offering , and the oil are provided every morning as a perpetual entirely burned offering . Royal land grants
CEB	Ezekiel	46	16	The Lord God proclaims : When the prince gives a gift to each of his sons , it becomes their inheritance . It becomes their family property as an inheritance .
CEB	Ezekiel	46	17	And if he gives one of his servants a gift from his inheritance , it will belong to the servant only until the year of release , and then it will revert to the prince . It is his children ’ s inheritance ; it belongs to them .
CEB	Ezekiel	46	18	The prince won ’ t take the people ’ s inheritance by evicting them from their family property . He will bequeath only his own property to his sons , lest any of my people be deprived of their rightful property . Kitchens
CEB	Ezekiel	46	19	Then he brought me through the passage beside the gate next to the priests ’ quarters , the holy chambers facing north . There was a place hidden away on the western side .
CEB	Ezekiel	46	20	He said to me , “ Rather than taking these offerings out into the outer courtyard and transferring holiness to the people , this is the place where the priests will boil the compensation offerings and the purification offerings , and where they will bake the grain offerings. ”
CEB	Ezekiel	46	21	Then he took me to the outer courtyard , and he had me pass through its four corners , and I saw that there were additional courtyards in each of the corners .
CEB	Ezekiel	46	22	In all four corners of the courtyard , these courtyards were constructed to handle smoke . All four were the same size , sixty feet long by forty-five feet wide .
CEB	Ezekiel	46	23	All four had stone masonry all the way around , and hearths were built under this masonry all the way around .
CEB	Ezekiel	46	24	He said to me , “ These are the kitchens where those who minister in the temple cook the people ’ s sacrifices . ”
CEB	Ezekiel	47	47	When he brought me back to the temple ’ s entrance , I noticed that water was flowing toward the east from under the temple ’ s threshold ( the temple faced east ) . The water was going out from under the temple ’ s facade toward the south , south of the altar .
CEB	Ezekiel	47	2	He led me out through the north gate and around the outside to the outer east gate , where the water flowed out under the facade on the south side .
CEB	Ezekiel	47	3	With the line in his hand , the man went out toward the east . When he measured off fifteen hundred feet , he made me cross the water ; it was ankle-deep .
CEB	Ezekiel	47	4	He measured off another fifteen hundred feet and made me cross the water ; it was knee-deep . He measured off another fifteen hundred feet and made me cross the water , and it was waist-high .
CEB	Ezekiel	47	5	When he measured off another fifteen hundred feet , it had become a river that I couldn ’ t cross . The water was high , deep enough for swimming but too high to cross .
CEB	Ezekiel	47	6	He said to me , “ Human one , do you see ? ” Then he led me back to the edge of the river .
CEB	Ezekiel	47	7	When I went back , I saw very many trees on both banks of the river .
CEB	Ezekiel	47	8	He said to me , “ These waters go out to the eastern region , flow down the steep slopes , [ a ] and go into the Dead Sea . [ b ] When the flowing waters enter the sea , its water becomes fresh .
CEB	Ezekiel	47	9	Wherever the river flows , every living thing that moves will thrive . There will be great schools of fish , because when these waters enter the sea , it will be fresh . Wherever the river flows , everything will live .
CEB	Ezekiel	47	10	People will stand fishing beside it , from En-gedi to En-eglayim , and it will become a place for spreading nets . It will be like the Mediterranean Sea , [ c ] having all kinds of fish in it .
CEB	Ezekiel	47	11	Its marshes and swamps won ’ t be made fresh ( they are left for salt ) ,
CEB	Ezekiel	47	12	but on both banks of the river will grow up all kinds of fruit-bearing trees . Their leaves won ’ t wither , and their fruitfulness won ’ t wane . They will produce fruit in every month , because their water comes from the sanctuary . Their fruit will be for eating , their leaves for healing. ”
CEB	Ezekiel	47	13	The Lord God proclaims : These [ d ] are the boundaries of the portions of land that will be distributed as an inheritance to the twelve tribes of Israel . Joseph will receive two portions .
CEB	Ezekiel	47	14	What I swore to give to your ancestors , you will distribute as an inheritance equally . This land is given to you as an inheritance .
CEB	Ezekiel	47	15	This is the boundary of the land . The northern limit begins at the Mediterranean Sea and goes in the direction of Hethlon toward Lebo-hamath , Zedad , [ e ]
CEB	Ezekiel	47	16	Berothah , Sibraim ( which is between the boundary of Damascus and the boundary of Hamath ) , and Hazer-hatticon ( that is on the boundary of Hauran ) .
CEB	Ezekiel	47	17	So the boundary from the Mediterranean Sea [ f ] to Hazar-enon will run north of the boundary of Damascus , with the boundary of Hamath to the north . This is the northern limit .
CEB	Ezekiel	47	18	For the eastern limit , you will measure continuously between Hauran and Damascus and between Gilead and the land of Israel , along the Jordan River as far as the Dead Sea . [ g ] This is the eastern limit .
CEB	Ezekiel	47	19	The southern limit runs from Tamar to the waters of Meribath-kadesh and from there along the border [ h ] of Egypt to the Mediterranean Sea . This is the southern limit .
CEB	Ezekiel	47	20	For the western limit , the Mediterranean Sea is the boundary up to Lebo-hamath . This is the western limit .
CEB	Ezekiel	47	21	You will apportion this land among yourselves according to the tribes of Israel .
CEB	Ezekiel	47	22	When you distribute the land as an inheritance , the immigrants who reside with you and raise families among you are considered full citizens along with the Israelites . They will receive an inheritance along with you among the tribes of Israel .
CEB	Ezekiel	47	23	You will assign the immigrants ’ inheritance with the tribe with whom they reside . This is what the Lord God says . Footnotes - Ezekiel 47:8 Or Arabah - Ezekiel 47:8 Or sea - Ezekiel 47:10 Or great sea - Ezekiel 47:13 LXX , Tg , Vulg ; Heb uncertain - Ezekiel 47:15 LXX ; MT transposes Hamath and Zedad . - Ezekiel 47:17 Or the sea - Ezekiel 47:18 Or eastern sea - Ezekiel 47:19 Or Wadi ; traditionally Brook
CEB	Ezekiel	48	48	These are the tribes ’ names : Beginning at the north , along the Hethlon road from Lebo-hamath to Hazar-enon , the boundary of Damascus with Hamath to the north , from the eastern border to the western border : Dan , one portion .
CEB	Ezekiel	48	2	Along the boundary of Dan from the eastern border to the western border : Asher , one portion .
CEB	Ezekiel	48	3	Along the boundary of Asher from the eastern border to the western border : Naphtali , one portion .
CEB	Ezekiel	48	4	Along the boundary of Naphtali from the eastern border to the western border : Manasseh , one portion .
CEB	Ezekiel	48	5	Along the boundary of Manasseh from the eastern border to the western border : Ephraim , one portion .
CEB	Ezekiel	48	6	Along the boundary of Ephraim from the eastern border to the western border : Reuben , one portion .
CEB	Ezekiel	48	7	Along the boundary of Reuben from the eastern border to the western border : Judah , one portion .
CEB	Ezekiel	48	8	Along the boundary of Judah from the eastern border to the western border will be the portion that you will set aside , 7.1 miles wide and the length of a tribal portion from the eastern border to the western border . The sanctuary is in its center .
CEB	Ezekiel	48	9	The portion that you will set aside for the Lord will be 7.1 miles long and 5.68 miles [ a ] wide .
CEB	Ezekiel	48	10	These measurements define the holy portion for the priests : along the north , a length of 7.1 miles ; along the west , a width of 2.84 miles ; along the east , a width of 2.84 miles ; and along the south , a length of 7.1 miles . The Lord ’ s sanctuary is in its center .
CEB	Ezekiel	48	11	This holy area is for the Zadokite priests who kept my charge and didn ’ t stray as the Levites did when the house of Israel strayed away from me .
CEB	Ezekiel	48	12	It belongs to them as a most special portion of the land , a most holy place , up to the border of the Levites .
CEB	Ezekiel	48	13	The Levites ’ allotment is next to the boundary of the priests , a length of 7.1 miles and a width of 2.84 miles . The entire length is 7.1 miles and the width 2.84 miles .
CEB	Ezekiel	48	14	None of it will be sold , exchanged , or transferred . It is the choicest land , because it is holy to the Lord .
CEB	Ezekiel	48	15	The remaining area , 1.42 miles wide and 7.1 miles long , is for ordinary use for the city , for residences , and for pastures . The city will be in the middle of it .
CEB	Ezekiel	48	16	It measures 1.28 miles on its northern border , 1.28 miles on its southern border , 1.28 miles on its eastern border , and 1.28 miles on its western border .
CEB	Ezekiel	48	17	There will be pastures for the city , three hundred seventy-five feet on the north side , three hundred seventy-five feet on the south side , three hundred seventy-five feet on the east side , and three hundred seventy-five feet on the west side .
CEB	Ezekiel	48	18	The remaining area alongside the holy portion is 2.84 miles on the east and 2.84 miles on the west . These areas that adjoin the holy portion will produce the food for the city ’ s workers .
CEB	Ezekiel	48	19	The city ’ s workers from every tribe of Israel will farm it .
CEB	Ezekiel	48	20	The entire portion that you will set aside is 7.1 miles by 7.1 miles , a square ; it includes the holy portion in addition to the city property .
CEB	Ezekiel	48	21	What is left on both sides of the holy portion and the city property belongs to the prince . The land from the edge of the portion of 7.1 miles , to the eastern boundary , and on the western edge of the 7.1 miles to the western boundary , belongs to the prince . It corresponds to one tribal portion . The holy portion and the temple sanctuary are in the middle of it ,
CEB	Ezekiel	48	22	but what belongs to the prince is separate from both the levitical property and the city property . The prince ’ s territory will be between the boundary of Judah and the boundary of Benjamin .
CEB	Ezekiel	48	23	Now for the rest of the tribes : From the eastern border to the western border : Benjamin , one portion .
CEB	Ezekiel	48	24	Along the boundary of Benjamin from the eastern border to the western border : Simeon , one portion .
CEB	Ezekiel	48	25	Along the boundary of Simeon from the eastern border to the western border : Issachar , one portion .
CEB	Ezekiel	48	26	Along the boundary of Issachar from the eastern border to the western border : Zebulun , one portion .
CEB	Ezekiel	48	27	Along the boundary of Zebulun from the eastern border to the western border : Gad , one portion .
CEB	Ezekiel	48	28	Along the boundary of Gad to the southern border , the boundary will run from Tamar to the waters of Meribath-kadesh and from there to the border of Egypt [ b ] and to the Mediterranean Sea . [ c ]
CEB	Ezekiel	48	29	This is the land that you will distribute as an inheritance for the tribes of Israel . These are their portions . This is what the Lord God says .
CEB	Ezekiel	48	30	These are the city exits . The north side is measured at 1.28 miles .
CEB	Ezekiel	48	31	The gates of the city go by the names of the tribes of Israel . There are three gates on the north side : one gate for Reuben , one gate for Judah , and one gate for Levi .
CEB	Ezekiel	48	32	There are three gates on the east side along its 1.28 miles : one gate for Joseph , one gate for Benjamin , and one gate for Dan .
CEB	Ezekiel	48	33	There are three gates on the south side measuring 1.28 miles : one gate for Simeon , one gate for Issachar , and one gate for Zebulun .
CEB	Ezekiel	48	34	There are three gates on the west side along its 1.28 miles : one gate for Gad , one gate for Asher , and one gate for Naphtali .
CEB	Ezekiel	48	35	The circumference of the city is 5.1 miles . As of today , the name of the city is The Lord Is There .

CEB	Daniel	1	1	In the third year of the rule of Judah ’ s King Jehoiakim , Babylon ’ s King Nebuchadnezzar came to Jerusalem and attacked it .
CEB	Daniel	1	2	The Lord handed Judah ’ s King Jehoiakim over to Nebuchadnezzar , along with some of the equipment from God ’ s house . Nebuchadnezzar took these to Shinar , to his own god ’ s temple , putting them in his god ’ s treasury . Training for royal service
CEB	Daniel	1	3	Nebuchadnezzar instructed his highest official Ashpenaz to choose royal descendants and members of the ruling class from the Israelites—
CEB	Daniel	1	4	good-looking young men without defects , skilled in all wisdom , possessing knowledge , conversant with learning , and capable of serving in the king ’ s palace . Ashpenaz was to teach them the Chaldean language and its literature .
CEB	Daniel	1	5	The king assigned these young men daily allotments from his own food and from the royal wine . Ashpenaz was to teach them for three years so that at the end of that time they could serve before the king .
CEB	Daniel	1	6	Among these young men from the Judeans were Daniel , Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah .
CEB	Daniel	1	7	But the chief official gave them new names . He named Daniel “ Belteshazzar , ” Hananiah “ Shadrach , ” Mishael “ Meshach , ” and Azariah “ Abednego. ” Test
CEB	Daniel	1	8	Daniel decided that he wouldn ’ t pollute himself with the king ’ s rations or the royal wine , and he appealed to the chief official in hopes that he wouldn ’ t have to do so .
CEB	Daniel	1	9	Now God had established faithful loyalty between Daniel and the chief official ;
CEB	Daniel	1	10	but the chief official said to Daniel , “ I ’ m afraid of my master , the king , who has mandated what you are to eat and drink . What will happen if he sees your faces looking thinner than the other young men in your group ? The king will have my head because of you ! ”
CEB	Daniel	1	11	So Daniel spoke to the guard whom the chief official had appointed over Daniel , Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah :
CEB	Daniel	1	12	“ Why not test your servants for ten days ? You could give us a diet of vegetables to eat and water to drink .
CEB	Daniel	1	13	Then compare our appearance to the appearance of the young men who eat the king ’ s food . Then deal with your servants according to what you see. ”
CEB	Daniel	1	14	The guard decided to go along with their plan and tested them for ten days .
CEB	Daniel	1	15	At the end of ten days they looked better and healthier than all the young men who were eating the king ’ s food .
CEB	Daniel	1	16	So the guard kept taking away their rations and the wine they were supposed to drink and gave them vegetables instead .
CEB	Daniel	1	17	And God gave knowledge , mastery of all literature , and wisdom to these four men . Daniel himself gained understanding of every type of vision and dream . Result of the training
CEB	Daniel	1	18	When the time came to review the young men as the king had ordered , the chief official brought them before Nebuchadnezzar .
CEB	Daniel	1	19	When the king spoke with them , he found no one as good as Daniel , Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah . So they took their place in the king ’ s service .
CEB	Daniel	1	20	Whenever the king consulted them about any aspect of wisdom and understanding , he found them head and shoulders above all the dream interpreters and enchanters in his entire kingdom .
CEB	Daniel	1	21	And Daniel stayed in the king ’ s service until the first year of King Cyrus .
CEB	Daniel	2	2	The king summoned the dream interpreters , enchanters , diviners , and Chaldeans to explain his dreams to him . They came and stood before the king .
CEB	Daniel	2	3	Then the king said to them : “ I had a dream , and I ’ m anxious to know its meaning. ”
CEB	Daniel	2	4	The Chaldeans answered the king in Aramaic : [ a ] “ Long live the king ! Tell your servants the dream , and we will explain its meaning. ”
CEB	Daniel	2	5	The king answered the Chaldeans : “ My decision is final : If you can ’ t tell me the dream and its meaning , you will be torn limb from limb , and your houses will be turned into trash dumps .
CEB	Daniel	2	6	But if you do explain the dream and its meaning , you ’ ll receive generous gifts and glorious honor from me . So explain to me the dream as well as its meaning. ”
CEB	Daniel	2	7	They answered him again : “ The king must tell his servants the dream . We will then explain the meaning. ”
CEB	Daniel	2	8	The king replied : “ Now I definitely know you are stalling for time , because you see that my decision is final
CEB	Daniel	2	9	and that if you can ’ t tell me the dream , your fate is certain . You ’ ve conspired to make false and lying speeches before me until the situation changes . Tell me the dream now ! Then I ’ ll know you can explain its meaning to me. ”
CEB	Daniel	2	10	The Chaldeans answered the king : “ No one on earth can do what the king is asking ! No king or ruler , no matter how great , has ever asked such a thing of any dream interpreter , enchanter , or Chaldean .
CEB	Daniel	2	11	What the king is asking is impossible ! No one could declare the dream to the king but the gods , who don ’ t live among mere humans. ”
CEB	Daniel	2	12	At this , the king exploded in a furious rage and ordered that all Babylon ’ s sages be wiped out .
CEB	Daniel	2	13	So the command went out : The sages were to be killed . Daniel and his friends too were hunted down ; they were to be killed as well . God reveals the mystery
CEB	Daniel	2	14	Then Daniel , with wisdom and sound judgment , responded to Arioch the king ’ s chief executioner , who had gone out to kill Babylon ’ s sages .
CEB	Daniel	2	15	He said to Arioch the king ’ s royal officer , “ Why is the king ’ s command so unreasonable ? ” After Arioch explained the situation to Daniel ,
CEB	Daniel	2	16	Daniel went and asked the king to give him some time so he could explain the dream ’ s meaning to him .
CEB	Daniel	2	17	Then Daniel went to his house and explained the situation to his friends Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah
CEB	Daniel	2	18	so that they would ask the God of heaven for help about this mystery , in hopes that Daniel and his friends wouldn ’ t die with the rest of Babylon ’ s sages .
CEB	Daniel	2	19	Then , in a vision by night , the mystery was revealed to Daniel ! Daniel praised the God of heaven :
CEB	Daniel	2	20	God ’ s name be praised from age to eternal age ! Wisdom and might are his !
CEB	Daniel	2	21	God is the one who changes times and eras , who dethrones one king , only to establish another , who grants wisdom to the wise and knowledge to those with insight .
CEB	Daniel	2	22	God is the one who uncovers what lies deeply hidden ; he knows what hides in darkness ; light lives with him !
CEB	Daniel	2	23	I acknowledge and praise you , my fathers ’ God ! You ’ ve given me wisdom and might , and now you ’ ve made known to me what we asked of you : you ’ ve made known to us the king ’ s demand . Daniel recounts the dream
CEB	Daniel	2	24	So Daniel went to Arioch , the man the king had appointed to wipe out Babylon ’ s sages . Daniel said to him , “ Don ’ t wipe out the sages of Babylon ! Bring me before the king , and I will explain the dream ’ s meaning to him. ”
CEB	Daniel	2	25	Wasting no time , Arioch brought Daniel before the king , telling him , “ I have found someone from the Judean exiles who will tell the dream ’ s meaning to the king. ”
CEB	Daniel	2	26	In reply the king said to Daniel ( whose name was Belteshazzar ) , “ Can you really tell me the dream that I saw , as well as its meaning ? ”
CEB	Daniel	2	27	Daniel answered the king , “ Sages , enchanters , dream interpreters , and diviners can ’ t explain to the king the mystery he seeks .
CEB	Daniel	2	28	But there is a God in heaven , a revealer of mysteries , who has shown King Nebuchadnezzar what will happen in the days to come ! Now this was your dream—this was the vision in your head as you lay in your bed :
CEB	Daniel	2	29	“ As you lay in bed , Your Majesty , your thoughts turned to what will happen in the future . The revealer of mysteries has revealed to you what will happen .
CEB	Daniel	2	30	Now this mystery was revealed to me , not because I have more wisdom than any other living person but so that the dream ’ s meaning might be made known to the king , and so that you might know the thoughts of your own mind .
CEB	Daniel	2	31	“ Your Majesty , you were looking , and there , rising before you , was a single , massive statue . This statue was huge , shining with dazzling light , and was awesome to see .
CEB	Daniel	2	32	The statue ’ s head was made of pure gold ; its chest and arms were made from silver ; its abdomen and hips were made of bronze .
CEB	Daniel	2	33	Its legs were of iron , and its feet were a mixture of iron and clay .
CEB	Daniel	2	34	You observed this until a stone was cut , but not by hands ; and it smashed the statue ’ s feet of iron and clay and shattered them .
CEB	Daniel	2	35	Then all the parts shattered simultaneously—iron , clay , bronze , silver , and gold . They became like chaff , left on summer threshing floors . The wind lifted them away until no trace of them remained . But the stone that smashed the statue became a mighty mountain , and it filled the entire earth . The dream ’ s meaning : four future rulers
CEB	Daniel	2	36	“ This was the dream . Now we will tell the king its meaning :
CEB	Daniel	2	37	You , Your Majesty , are the king of kings . The God of heaven has given kingship , power , might , and glory to you !
CEB	Daniel	2	38	God has delivered into your care human beings , wild creatures , and birds in the sky—wherever they live—and has made you ruler of all of them . You are the gold head .
CEB	Daniel	2	39	But in your place , another kingdom will arise , one inferior to yours , and then a third , bronze kingdom will rule over all the earth .
CEB	Daniel	2	40	Then will come a fourth kingdom , mighty like iron . Just as iron shatters and crushes everything ; so like an iron that smashes , it will shatter and crush all these others .
CEB	Daniel	2	41	As for the feet and toes that you saw , which were a mixture of potter ’ s clay and iron , that signifies a divided kingdom ; but it will possess some of the unyielding strength of iron . Even so , you saw the iron mixed with earthy clay
CEB	Daniel	2	42	so that the toes were made from a mixture of iron and clay . Part of the kingdom will be mighty , but part of it will be fragile .
CEB	Daniel	2	43	Just as you saw the iron mixed with earthy clay , they will join together by intermarrying , but they will not bond to each other , just as iron does not fuse with clay .
CEB	Daniel	2	44	“ But in the days of those kings , the God of heaven will raise up an everlasting kingdom that will be indestructible . Its rule will never pass to another people . It will shatter other kingdoms . It will put an end to all of them . It will stand firm forever ,
CEB	Daniel	2	45	just like you saw when the stone , which was cut from the mountain , but not by hands , shattered the iron , bronze , clay , silver , and gold . A great God has revealed to the king what will happen in the future . The dream is certain . Its meaning can be trusted. ” Nebuchadnezzar honors Daniel
CEB	Daniel	2	46	Then King Nebuchadnezzar bowed low and honored Daniel . The king ordered that grain and incense offerings be made to Daniel .
CEB	Daniel	2	47	The king declared to Daniel , “ No doubt about it : your God is God of gods , Lord of kings , and a revealer of mysteries because you were able to reveal this mystery ! ”
CEB	Daniel	2	48	Then the king exalted Daniel and lavished gifts on him , making him ruler over all the province of Babylon and chief minister over all Babylon ’ s sages .
CEB	Daniel	2	49	At Daniel ’ s urging , the king appointed Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego to administer the province of Babylon , but Daniel himself remained at the royal court . Footnotes - Daniel 2:4 The book switches into Aramaic at this point , returning to Hebrew in 8:1 .
CEB	Daniel	3	3	So the chief administrators , ministers , governors , counselors , treasurers , judges , magistrates , and all the provincial officials assembled for the dedication of the statue that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up . They stood in front of the statue the king had set up .
CEB	Daniel	3	2	King Nebuchadnezzar then ordered the chief administrators , ministers , governors , counselors , treasurers , judges , magistrates , and all the provincial officials to assemble and come for the dedication of the statue that he had set up .
CEB	Daniel	3	4	The herald proclaimed loudly : “ Peoples , nations , and languages ! This is what you must do :
CEB	Daniel	3	5	When you hear the sound of the horn , pipe , zither , lyre , harp , flute , and every kind of instrument , you must bow down and worship the gold statue that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up .
CEB	Daniel	3	6	Anyone who will not bow down and worship will be immediately thrown into a furnace of flaming fire. ”
CEB	Daniel	3	7	So because of this order as soon as they heard the sound of the horn , pipe , zither , lyre , harp , flute , [ a ] and every kind of instrument , all the peoples , nations , and languages bowed down and worshipped the gold statue that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up . Plot against Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego
CEB	Daniel	3	8	At that moment some Chaldeans came forward , seizing a chance to attack the Jews .
CEB	Daniel	3	9	They said to King Nebuchadnezzar : “ Long live the king !
CEB	Daniel	3	10	Your Majesty , you gave a command that everyone who hears the sound of the horn , pipe , zither , lyre , harp , flute , and every kind of instrument should bow down and worship the gold statue .
CEB	Daniel	3	11	Anyone who wouldn ’ t bow and worship would be thrown into a furnace of flaming fire .
CEB	Daniel	3	12	Now there are some Jews , ones you appointed to administer the province of Babylon—specifically , Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego—who have ignored your command . They don ’ t serve your gods , and they don ’ t worship the gold statue you ’ ve set up. ”
CEB	Daniel	3	13	In a violent rage Nebuchadnezzar ordered them to bring Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego . They were brought before the king .
CEB	Daniel	3	14	Nebuchadnezzar said to them : “ Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego : Is it true that you don ’ t serve my gods or worship the gold statue I ’ ve set up ?
CEB	Daniel	3	15	If you are now ready to do so , bow down and worship the gold statue I ’ ve made when you hear the sound of horn , pipe , zither , lyre , harp , flute , and every kind of instrument . But if you won ’ t worship it , you will be thrown straight into the furnace of flaming fire . Then what god will rescue you from my power ? ”
CEB	Daniel	3	16	Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego answered King Nebuchadnezzar : “ We don ’ t need to answer your question .
CEB	Daniel	3	17	If our God—the one we serve—is able to rescue us from the furnace of flaming fire and from your power , Your Majesty , then let him rescue us . [ b ]
CEB	Daniel	3	18	But if he doesn ’ t , know this for certain , Your Majesty : we will never serve your gods or worship the gold statue you ’ ve set up. ” Inside the furnace
CEB	Daniel	3	19	Nebuchadnezzar was filled with rage , and his face twisted beyond recognition because of Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego . In response he commanded that the furnace be heated to seven times its normal heat .
CEB	Daniel	3	20	He told some of the strongest men in his army to bind Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego and throw them into the furnace of flaming fire .
CEB	Daniel	3	21	So Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego were bound , still dressed in all their clothes , and thrown into the furnace of flaming fire . (
CEB	Daniel	3	22	Now the king ’ s command had been rash , and the furnace was heated to such an extreme that the fire ’ s flame killed the very men who carried Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego to it . )
CEB	Daniel	3	23	So these three men , Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego , fell , bound , into the furnace of flaming fire .
CEB	Daniel	3	24	Then King Nebuchadnezzar jumped up in shock and said to his associates , “ Didn ’ t we throw three men , bound , into the fire ? ” They answered the king , “ Certainly , Your Majesty. ”
CEB	Daniel	3	25	He replied , “ Look ! I see four men , unbound , walking around inside the fire , and they aren ’ t hurt ! And the fourth one looks like one of the gods. ”
CEB	Daniel	3	26	Nebuchadnezzar went near the opening of the furnace of flaming fire and said , “ Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego , servants of the Most High God , come out ! Come here ! ” Then Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego came out of the fire .
CEB	Daniel	3	27	The chief administrators , ministers , governors , and the king ’ s associates crowded around to look at them . The fire hadn ’ t done anything to them : their hair wasn ’ t singed ; their garments looked the same as before ; they didn ’ t even smell like fire ! Nebuchadnezzar praises God
CEB	Daniel	3	28	Nebuchadnezzar declared : “ May the God of Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego be praised ! He sent his messenger [ c ] to rescue his servants who trusted him . They ignored the king ’ s order , sacrificing their bodies , because they wouldn ’ t serve or worship any god but their God .
CEB	Daniel	3	29	I now issue a decree to every people , nation , and language : whoever speaks disrespectfully about Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego ’ s God will be torn limb from limb and their house made a trash heap , because there is no other god who can rescue like this. ”
CEB	Daniel	3	30	Then the king made Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego prosperous in the province of Babylon . Footnotes - Daniel 3:7 Identification of the instruments is not certain ; several of the Aramaic terms are Greek loanwords . - Daniel 3:17 Or he will deliver us - Daniel 3:28 Or angel
CEB	Daniel	4	4	[ b ] “ While I , Nebuchadnezzar , was safe in my house , content in my palace ,
CEB	Daniel	4	2	I ’ m delighted to share the signs and miracles that the Most High God has worked in my life .
CEB	Daniel	4	3	His signs are superb ! His miracles so powerful ! His kingdom is everlasting . His rule is for all time .
CEB	Daniel	4	5	I had a terrifying dream . My thoughts while I was lying in bed and the vision in my mind overwhelmed me .
CEB	Daniel	4	6	I ordered all Babylon ’ s sages to come before me , so they might tell me the dream ’ s meaning .
CEB	Daniel	4	7	So the dream interpreters , enchanters , Chaldeans , and diviners came . I told them the dream , but they couldn ’ t interpret it for me .
CEB	Daniel	4	8	Daniel , who is called Belteshazzar after the name of my god , was the last to come before me . In him is the breath [ c ] of the holy gods ! I told Daniel the dream : Nebuchadnezzar ’ s dream
CEB	Daniel	4	9	“ Belteshazzar , chief of the dream interpreters , I know the breath of the holy gods is in you , and no mystery is too difficult for you . Tell me the meaning of the visions I had in my dream .
CEB	Daniel	4	10	In my mind , as I lay in bed , I saw a vision : At the center of the earth was a towering tree .
CEB	Daniel	4	11	The tree grew in size and strength ; it was as high as the sky ; it could be seen from every corner of the earth .
CEB	Daniel	4	12	Its leaves were beautiful , its fruit abundant ; it had enough food for everyone . Wild animals took shade under it ; birds nested in its branches . All living things lived off that tree .
CEB	Daniel	4	13	“ In my mind , as I lay in bed , I saw another vision : A holy watcher came down from heaven .
CEB	Daniel	4	14	He proclaimed loudly : ‘ Cut down the tree and shear off its branches ! Strip its leaves and scatter its fruit ! The creatures should flee from its shelter ; the birds should take flight from its branches .
CEB	Daniel	4	15	But leave its deepest root in the earth , bound with iron and bronze in the field grass . Dew from heaven is to wash it , and it must live with the animals in the earth ’ s vegetation .
CEB	Daniel	4	16	Its [ d ] human mind is to be changed : it will be given the mind of an animal . Seven periods of time will pass over it .
CEB	Daniel	4	17	This sentence is by the watchers ’ decree ; this decision is the holy ones ’ word so that all who live might know that the Most High dominates human kingship . The Most High gives kingship to anyone he wants and sets over it the lowest of people. ’
CEB	Daniel	4	18	- Daniel 4:16 Throughout 4:15-16 and later in this chap , it and its could also be translated he and his .
CEB	Daniel	4	19	Daniel , who was called Belteshazzar , was shocked for a bit . What he thought about frightened him . The king declared , “ Don ’ t let the dream and its meaning scare you , Belteshazzar. ” Then Belteshazzar answered , “ Sir , I wish the dream to be for those who hate you and its meaning to be for your enemies !
CEB	Daniel	4	20	The tree you saw that grew in size and strength , that was as high as the sky , that could be seen from every corner of the earth ,
CEB	Daniel	4	21	with its beautiful leaves and its abundant fruit , and that had enough food for everyone , with wild animals living under it and birds nesting in its branches—
CEB	Daniel	4	22	Your Majesty , that tree is you ! You have grown large and become powerful . Your greatness is as high as the sky ; your rule extends to the edge of the earth !
CEB	Daniel	4	23	“ Your Majesty , the holy watcher you saw coming down from heaven , who said , ‘ Cut down the tree and destroy it , but leave its deepest root in the earth , bound with iron and bronze in the field grass , dew from heaven is to wash it , and it must live with the wild animals until seven periods of time pass over it ’ —
CEB	Daniel	4	24	Your Majesty , this is the dream ’ s meaning : It is the sentence of the Most High , delivered to my master the king .
CEB	Daniel	4	25	You will be driven away from other humans and will live with the wild animals . You will eat grass like cattle and will be washed by dew from heaven . Seven periods of time will pass over you , until you acknowledge that the Most High dominates human kingship , giving it to anyone he wants .
CEB	Daniel	4	26	And when he said to leave the deepest root of the tree—that means your kingship will again be yours , once you acknowledge that heaven rules all .
CEB	Daniel	4	27	Therefore , Your Majesty , please accept my advice : remove your sins by doing what is right ; remove your wrongdoing by showing mercy to the poor . Then your safety will be long lasting. ” Visions come true
CEB	Daniel	4	28	All this happened to King Nebuchadnezzar .
CEB	Daniel	4	29	Twelve months later , he was walking on the roof of the royal palace in Babylon .
CEB	Daniel	4	30	The king declared , “ Isn ’ t this Babylon , the magnificent city that I built as the royal house by my own mighty strength and for my own majestic glory ? ”
CEB	Daniel	4	31	These words hadn ’ t even left the king ’ s mouth when a voice came from heaven : “ You , King Nebuchadnezzar , are now informed : Kingship is taken away from you .
CEB	Daniel	4	32	You will be driven away from other humans and will live with the wild animals . You will eat grass like cattle , and seven periods of time will pass over you until you acknowledge that the Most High dominates human kingship , giving it to anyone he wants. ”
CEB	Daniel	4	33	Nebuchadnezzar ’ s sentence was immediately carried out . He was driven away from other humans and ate grass like cattle . Dew from heaven washed his body until he grew hair like eagles ’ feathers and claws like a bird . Nebuchadnezzar is restored
CEB	Daniel	4	34	“ At the end of that time , I , Nebuchadnezzar , raised my eyes to heaven . My reason returned to me , and I praised the Most High . I worshipped and glorified the one who lives forever because his rule is everlasting ; his kingdom is for all time .
CEB	Daniel	4	35	All of earth ’ s inhabitants are nothing in comparison . The Most High does whatever he wants with heaven ’ s forces and with earth ’ s inhabitants . No one can contain his power or say to him , ‘ What do you think you are doing ? ’
CEB	Daniel	4	36	So at that moment my reason returned to me . My honor and splendor came back to me for the glory of my kingdom . My associates and my princes wanted to be with me again . Not only was I reinstated over my kingdom , I received more power than ever before .
CEB	Daniel	4	37	“ Now I , Nebuchadnezzar , worship , magnify , and glorify the king of heaven . All his works are truth , all his paths are justice , and he is able to humble all who walk in pride. ” Footnotes - Daniel 4:1 3:31 in Aram - Daniel 4:4 4:1 in Aram - Daniel 4:8 Or spirit ; also in 4:9 ,
CEB	Daniel	5	5	Right then the fingers of a human hand appeared and wrote on the plaster of the king ’ s palace wall in the light of the lamp . The king saw the hand that wrote .
CEB	Daniel	5	2	While he was under the wine ’ s influence , Belshazzar commanded that the gold and silver equipment that his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken from Jerusalem ’ s temple be brought to the party so that the king , his princes , his consorts , and his secondary wives could drink wine out of them .
CEB	Daniel	5	3	So the gold [ a ] equipment that had been carried out of the temple , God ’ s house in Jerusalem , was brought in ; and the king , his princes , his consorts , and his secondary wives drank out of it .
CEB	Daniel	5	4	They drank a lot of wine ; and they praised the gods of gold , silver , bronze , iron , wood , and stone . Writing on the wall
CEB	Daniel	5	6	The king ’ s mood changed immediately , and he was deeply disturbed . He felt weak , and his knees were shaking .
CEB	Daniel	5	7	The king yelled , calling for the enchanters , the Chaldeans , and the diviners . The king told these sages of Babylon : “ Anyone who can read this writing and tell me its meaning will wear royal robes , will have a gold chain around his neck , and will rule the kingdom as third in command. ”
CEB	Daniel	5	8	Then all the king ’ s sages arrived , but they couldn ’ t read the writing or interpret it for the king .
CEB	Daniel	5	9	At that point King Belshazzar was really frightened . All the color drained from his face , and his princes were also very worried .
CEB	Daniel	5	10	Upon hearing the commotion coming from the king and his princes , the queen entered the banqueting hall and declared , “ Long live the king ! Don ’ t be so disturbed . Don ’ t be so frightened .
CEB	Daniel	5	11	There is a man in your kingdom who has the breath [ b ] of holy gods in him ! When your father was alive , this man was shown to possess illumination , insight , and wisdom like the very wisdom of the gods . [ c ] Your father King Nebuchadnezzar appointed this man as chief over the dream interpreters , enchanters , Chaldeans , and diviners . Yes , your father did this
CEB	Daniel	5	12	because this man—Daniel , the one the king named Belteshazzar—possesses an extraordinary spirit , knowledge , and insight into the meaning of dreams . He can explain ambiguities and resolve mysteries . Now in light of all that , summon Daniel ! He will explain the meaning of this thing. ”
CEB	Daniel	5	13	So Daniel was brought before the king . The king said to him , “ So you are Daniel , the Daniel from the exiles that my father the king brought from Judah ?
CEB	Daniel	5	14	I have heard that the breath of the gods is in you and that you possess illumination , insight , and extraordinary wisdom .
CEB	Daniel	5	15	Now , the sages and the dream interpreters were brought before me to read this writing and interpret it for me , but they couldn ’ t explain its meaning .
CEB	Daniel	5	16	But I ’ ve heard that you can explain meanings and solve mysteries . So if you can read this writing and interpret it for me , you will wear royal robes , have a gold chain around your neck , and will rule the kingdom as third in command. ” Daniel interprets the writing
CEB	Daniel	5	17	Daniel answered the king : “ Keep your gifts . Give the rewards to someone else . But I will still read the writing to the king and interpret it for him .
CEB	Daniel	5	18	Listen , Your Majesty : The Most High God gave kingship , power , glory , and majesty to your father Nebuchadnezzar .
CEB	Daniel	5	19	Because of the power God gave Nebuchadnezzar , all peoples , nations , and languages were terrified of him . He did whatever he wanted , whenever he wanted : killing or sparing , exalting or humbling .
CEB	Daniel	5	20	But when he became arrogant , acting in stubborn pride , he was pulled off his royal throne and the glory was taken from him .
CEB	Daniel	5	21	He was driven away from other humans , and his mind became like an animal ’ s . He lived with wild donkeys , he ate grass like cattle , and dew from heaven washed his body until he realized that the Most High God dominates human kingship and sets over it anyone he wants .
CEB	Daniel	5	22	“ But you who are his son , Belshazzar , you haven ’ t submitted , even though you ’ ve known all this .
CEB	Daniel	5	23	Instead , you ’ ve set yourself up against the Lord of heaven ! The equipment of God ’ s house was brought to you ; and you , your princes , your consorts , and your secondary wives drank wine out of it , all the while praising the gods of silver , gold , bronze , iron , wood , and stone—gods who can ’ t see , hear , or know anything . But you didn ’ t glorify the true God who holds your very breath in his hand and who owns every road you take .
CEB	Daniel	5	24	“ That ’ s why this hand was sent from God and why this message was written down .
CEB	Daniel	5	25	This is what was written down : mene , mene , tekel , and parsin . [ d ]
CEB	Daniel	5	26	“ This is the meaning of the word mene : God has numbered [ e ] the days of your rule . It ’ s over !
CEB	Daniel	5	27	tekel means that you ’ ve been weighed [ f ] on the scales , and you don ’ t measure up .
CEB	Daniel	5	28	peres [ g ] means your kingship is divided [ h ] and given to the Medes and the Persians. ” [ i ]
CEB	Daniel	5	29	Then Belshazzar commanded that Daniel be dressed in a purple robe , have a gold chain around his neck , and be officially appointed as third in command in the kingdom .
CEB	Daniel	5	30	That very same night , Belshazzar the Chaldean king was killed .
CEB	Daniel	5	31	Darius the Mede received the kingdom at the age of
CEB	Daniel	5	62	.

CEB	Daniel	6	6	So these officers and chief administrators ganged together and went to the king . They said to him , “ Long live King Darius !
CEB	Daniel	6	2	and to set over them three main officers to whom they would report so that the king wouldn ’ t have to be bothered with too much . [ a ] One of these main officers was Daniel .
CEB	Daniel	6	3	Because of his extraordinary spirit , Daniel soon surpassed the other officers and the chief administrators—so much so that the king had plans to set him over the entire kingdom .
CEB	Daniel	6	4	As a result , the other officers and the chief administrators tried to find some problem with Daniel ’ s work for the kingdom . But they couldn ’ t find any problem or corruption at all because Daniel was trustworthy . He wasn ’ t guilty of any negligence or corruption .
CEB	Daniel	6	5	So these men said , “ We won ’ t find any fault in Daniel , unless we can find something to use against him from his religious practice. ” [ b ]
CEB	Daniel	6	7	All the officers of the kingdom , the ministers , the chief administrators , the royal associates , and the governors advise the king to issue an edict and enforce a law , that for thirty days anyone who says prayers to any god or human being except you , Your Majesty , will be thrown into a pit of lions .
CEB	Daniel	6	8	Now , Your Majesty , issue the law and sign the document so that it can not be changed , as per the law of Media and Persia , which can not be annulled. ”
CEB	Daniel	6	9	Because of this , King Darius signed the document containing the law . Daniel prays
CEB	Daniel	6	10	When Daniel learned that the document had been signed , he went to his house . Now his upper room had open windows that faced Jerusalem . Daniel knelt down , prayed , and praised his God three times that day , just like he always did .
CEB	Daniel	6	11	Just then these men , all ganged together , came upon Daniel praying and seeking mercy from his God .
CEB	Daniel	6	12	They then went and talked to the king about the law : “ Your Majesty ! Didn ’ t you sign a law , that for thirty days any person who prays to any god or human being besides you , Your Majesty , would be thrown into a pit of lions ? ” The king replied , “ The decision is absolutely firm in accordance with the law of Media and Persia , which can not be annulled. ”
CEB	Daniel	6	13	So they said to the king , “ One of the Judean exiles , Daniel , has ignored you , Your Majesty , as well as the law you signed . He says his prayers three times a day ! ”
CEB	Daniel	6	14	When the king heard this report , he was very unhappy . He decided to rescue Daniel and did everything he could do to save Daniel before the sun went down .
CEB	Daniel	6	15	But these men , all ganged together , came and said to the king , “ You must realize , Your Majesty , that the law of Media and Persia , including every law and edict the king has issued , can not be changed. ” Daniel in the lions ’ pit
CEB	Daniel	6	16	So the king gave the order , and they brought Daniel and hurled him into the pit of lions . The king said to Daniel : “ Your God—the one you serve so consistently—will rescue you. ” [ c ]
CEB	Daniel	6	17	A single stone was brought and placed over the entrance to the pit . The king sealed it with his own ring and with those of his princes so that Daniel ’ s situation couldn ’ t be changed .
CEB	Daniel	6	18	The king then went home to his palace and fasted through the night . No pleasures [ d ] were brought to him , and he couldn ’ t sleep .
CEB	Daniel	6	19	At dawn , at the first sign of light , the king rose and rushed to the lions ’ pit .
CEB	Daniel	6	20	As he approached it , he called out to Daniel , worried : “ Daniel , servant of the living God ! Was your God—the one you serve so consistently—able to rescue you from the lions ? ”
CEB	Daniel	6	21	Then Daniel answered the king : “ Long live the king !
CEB	Daniel	6	22	My God sent his messenger , who shut the lions ’ mouths . They haven ’ t touched me because I was judged innocent before my God . I haven ’ t done anything wrong to you either , Your Majesty. ”
CEB	Daniel	6	23	The king was thrilled . He commanded that Daniel be brought up out of the pit , and Daniel was lifted out . Not a scratch was found on him , because he trusted in his God .
CEB	Daniel	6	24	The king then ordered that the men who had accused Daniel be brought and thrown into the lions ’ pit—including their wives and children . They hadn ’ t even reached the bottom of the pit before the lions overpowered them , crushing all their bones . New decree
CEB	Daniel	6	25	Then King Darius wrote the following decree : To all the peoples , nations , and languages inhabiting the entire earth : I wish you much peace .
CEB	Daniel	6	26	I now issue this command : In every region of my kingdom , all people must fear and revere Daniel ’ s God because : He is the living God . God stands firm forever . His kingship is indestructible . God ’ s rule will last until the end of time .
CEB	Daniel	6	27	He is rescuer and savior ; God performs signs and miracles in heaven and on earth . Here ’ s the proof : He rescued Daniel from the lions ’ power .
CEB	Daniel	6	28	And so Daniel was made prosperous during the rule of Darius and during the rule of Cyrus the Persian .

CEB	Daniel	7	7	After this , as I continued to watch this night vision , I saw a fourth beast , terrifying and hideous , with extraordinary power and with massive iron teeth . As it ate and crushed , its feet smashed whatever was left over . It was different from all the other beasts before it , and it had ten horns .
CEB	Daniel	7	2	I am Daniel . In the vision I had during the night I saw the four winds of heaven churning the great sea .
CEB	Daniel	7	3	Four giant beasts emerged from the sea , each different from the others .
CEB	Daniel	7	4	The first was like a lion with eagle ’ s wings . I observed it until its wings were pulled off , and it was lifted up from the ground . It was then set on two feet , like a human being , and it received a human mind .
CEB	Daniel	7	5	Then I saw another beast , a second one , like a bear . It was raised on one side . It had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth . It was told : “ Get up ! Devour much flesh ! ”
CEB	Daniel	7	6	I kept watching , and suddenly there was another beast , this one like a leopard . On its back it had four wings like bird wings . This beast had four heads . Authority was given to it .
CEB	Daniel	7	8	I was staring at the horns when , suddenly , another small horn came up between them . Three of the earlier horns were ripped out to make room for it . On this new horn were eyes like human eyes and a mouth that bragged and bragged . Throne of fire and the human figure
CEB	Daniel	7	9	As I was watching , thrones were raised up . The ancient one took his seat . His clothes were white like snow ; his hair was like a lamb ’ s wool . His throne was made of flame ; its wheels were blazing fire .
CEB	Daniel	7	10	A river of fire flowed out from his presence ; thousands upon thousands served him ; ten thousand times ten thousand stood ready to serve him ! The court sat in session ; the scrolls were opened .
CEB	Daniel	7	11	I kept watching . I watched from the moment the horn started bragging until the beast was killed and its body was destroyed , handed over to be burned with fire .
CEB	Daniel	7	12	Then the authority of the remaining beasts was brought to an end , but they were given an extension among the living for a set time and season .
CEB	Daniel	7	13	As I continued to watch this night vision of mine , I suddenly saw one like a human being [ a ] coming with the heavenly clouds . He came to the ancient one and was presented before him .
CEB	Daniel	7	14	Rule , glory , and kingship were given to him ; all peoples , nations , and languages will serve him . His rule is an everlasting one— it will never pass away ! — his kingship is indestructible . Beasts interpreted
CEB	Daniel	7	15	Now this caused me , Daniel , to worry . [ b ] My visions disturbed me greatly .
CEB	Daniel	7	16	So I went to one of the servants who was standing ready nearby . I asked him for the truth about all this . He spoke to me and explained to me the meaning of these things .
CEB	Daniel	7	17	“ These four giant beasts are four kings that will rise up from the earth ,
CEB	Daniel	7	18	for Heb approximations . - Daniel 7:15 Or my spirit was distressed in its sheath ; Aram uncertain
CEB	Daniel	7	19	Next I wanted greater clarity about the fourth beast , the one that was different from all the others and utterly terrifying with its iron teeth and bronze claws . As it ate and crushed , its feet smashed whatever was left over .
CEB	Daniel	7	20	I wanted greater clarity about the ten horns on its head , and the other horn that came up , along with the three that fell out to make room for it—but especially about the horn that had eyes and a mouth that bragged , and that seemed more important than the others .
CEB	Daniel	7	21	As I watched , this same horn waged war against the holy ones and defeated them ,
CEB	Daniel	7	22	until the Ancient One came . Then judgment was given in favor of the holy ones of the Most High . The set time arrived , and the holy ones held the kingship securely .
CEB	Daniel	7	23	This is what he said : “ The fourth beast means that there will be a fourth kingship on the earth . It will be different from all the other kingships . It will devour the entire earth , trample it , crush it .
CEB	Daniel	7	24	The ten horns mean that from this kingship will rise ten kings , and after them will rise yet another . He will be different from the previous ones . He will defeat three kings .
CEB	Daniel	7	25	He will say things against the Most High and will exhaust the holy ones of the Most High . He will try to change times set by law . And for a period of time , periods of time , and half a period of time , they will be delivered into his power .
CEB	Daniel	7	26	Then the court will sit in session . His rule will be taken away— ruined and wiped out for all time .
CEB	Daniel	7	27	The kingship , authority , and power of all kingdoms under heaven will be given to the people , the holy ones of the Most High . Their kingship is an everlasting one ; every authority will serve them and obey. ”
CEB	Daniel	7	28	The account ends here . Now as for how I , Daniel , felt about this : My thoughts disturbed me greatly . My mood darkened considerably , and I kept thinking about this matter . Footnotes - Daniel 7:13 Aram kebar enash ( like a son of man ) is an idiom that means like a human being ; cf also 8:17 ; 10:16 ,
CEB	Daniel	8	8	The he-goat became even greater , but at the height of its power , its large horn snapped . In its place , four horns , each a sight to see , came up toward the four winds of heaven .
CEB	Daniel	8	2	I saw this vision , and as I experienced it I was in the walled city of Susa in the province of Elam , [ a ] by the Ulai canal .
CEB	Daniel	8	3	When I lifted my eyes , I suddenly saw a ram with two horns standing in front of the canal . Both horns were high , but one was higher than the other . The higher one came up after the other one .
CEB	Daniel	8	4	I saw the ram goring west , north , and south . No animal could resist the ram , and no one could stop it , rescuing others from its power . The ram did whatever it pleased . It became powerful .
CEB	Daniel	8	5	I was trying to understand this when suddenly a he-goat came from the west , crossing the entire earth but not touching the ground . Between this goat ’ s eyes was a horn that was a sight to see .
CEB	Daniel	8	6	The he-goat came to the ram that had two horns , the one I ’ d seen standing in front of the canal . The he-goat charged the ram in powerful anger .
CEB	Daniel	8	7	I saw the he-goat approach the ram . It was enraged at the ram and attacked it , shattering the ram ’ s two horns . The ram couldn ’ t resist the he-goat . The he-goat threw the ram on the ground and trampled on it . No one could rescue the ram from the he-goat ’ s power .
CEB	Daniel	8	9	A single , very small horn came out of one of the four horns . It grew bigger and bigger , stretching toward the south , the east , and the beautiful country .
CEB	Daniel	8	10	It grew as high as the heavenly forces , until it finally threw some of them and some of the stars down to the earth . Then it trampled on them .
CEB	Daniel	8	11	It grew as high as the very leader of those forces , taking the daily sacrifice away from him [ b ] and overturning his holy place .
CEB	Daniel	8	12	In an act of rebellion , another force will take control of the daily sacrifice . It will throw truth to the ground and will succeed in everything it does . [ c ] How long ?
CEB	Daniel	8	13	I then heard a certain holy one speaking . A second holy one said to the first one : “ How long will this vision last—the one concerning the daily sacrifice , the desolating rebellion , and the handing over of the sanctuary and its forces to be trampled ? ”
CEB	Daniel	8	14	He said to me , “ For two thousand three hundred evenings and mornings . Then the sanctuary will be restored. ” Vision interpreted
CEB	Daniel	8	15	Now I , Daniel , needed help understanding the vision I saw . Suddenly standing in front of me was someone who looked like a man .
CEB	Daniel	8	16	I then heard a human voice coming out of the center of the Ulai canal . It called out : “ Gabriel , help this person understand what he has seen. ”
CEB	Daniel	8	17	Gabriel approached me , and I was terrified when he came . I fell with my face to the ground . Gabriel said to me , “ Know this , human one : the vision is for the end time. ”
CEB	Daniel	8	18	As soon as he said this to me , I fell into a trance . My face was still on the ground . Then Gabriel touched me and set me up on my feet .
CEB	Daniel	8	19	He said , “ Now , I am going to tell you what will happen during the time of doom that is coming , because at the appointed time there will be an end .
CEB	Daniel	8	20	The two-horned ram you saw represents the kings of Media and Persia .
CEB	Daniel	8	21	The long-haired he-goat is the king of Greece , and the big horn between its eyes is the first king .
CEB	Daniel	8	22	The horn that snapped so that four came up in its place means that four kingdoms will come from one nation , but these four won ’ t have the strength of the first one .
CEB	Daniel	8	23	When their kingship nears its end and their sins [ d ] are almost complete , a king will step forward . He will be stern and a master of deception .
CEB	Daniel	8	24	At the height of his power , [ e ] he will wreak unbelievable destructions . He will succeed in all he does . He will destroy both the mighty and the people of the holy ones .
CEB	Daniel	8	25	Along with his cunning , he will succeed by using deceit . In his own mind , he will be great . In a time of peace , he will bring destruction on many , opposing even the supreme leader . But he will be broken— and not by a human hand .
CEB	Daniel	8	26	Now this vision of evening and morning , which has been announced , is true . But you must seal it up , because it is for days far in the future. ”
CEB	Daniel	8	27	Then I , Daniel , was overwhelmed and felt sick for days . When I finally got up and went about the king ’ s business , I remained troubled by the vision and couldn ’ t understand it .

CEB	Daniel	9	9	Compassion and deep forgiveness belong to my Lord , our God , because we rebelled against him .
CEB	Daniel	9	2	I , Daniel , pondered the scrolls , specifically the number of years that it would take to complete Jerusalem ’ s desolation according to the Lord ’ s word to the prophet Jeremiah . It was seventy years .
CEB	Daniel	9	3	I then turned my face to my Lord God , asking for an answer with prayer and pleading , and with fasting , mourning clothes , and ashes .
CEB	Daniel	9	4	As I prayed to the Lord my God , I made this confession : Please , my Lord—you are the great and awesome God , the one who keeps the covenant , and truly faithful to all who love him and keep his commands :
CEB	Daniel	9	5	We have sinned and done wrong . We have brought guilt on ourselves and rebelled , ignoring your commands and your laws .
CEB	Daniel	9	6	We haven ’ t listened to your servants , the prophets , who spoke in your name to our kings , our leaders , our parents , and to all the land ’ s people .
CEB	Daniel	9	7	Righteousness belongs to you , my Lord ! But we are ashamed this day—we , the people of Judah , the inhabitants of Jerusalem , all Israel whether near or far , in whatever country where you ’ ve driven them because of their unfaithfulness when they broke faith with you .
CEB	Daniel	9	8	Lord , we are ashamed—we , our kings , our leaders , and our parents who sinned against you .
CEB	Daniel	9	10	We didn ’ t listen to the voice of the Lord our God by following the teachings he gave us through his servants , the prophets .
CEB	Daniel	9	11	All Israel broke your Instruction and turned away , ignoring your voice . Then the curse that was sworn long ago—the one written in the Instruction from Moses , God ’ s servant—swept over us because we sinned against God .
CEB	Daniel	9	12	God confirmed the words he spoke against us and against our rulers , bringing great trouble on us . What happened in Jerusalem hasn ’ t happened anywhere else in the entire world !
CEB	Daniel	9	13	All this trouble came upon us , exactly as it was written in the Instruction of Moses , but we didn ’ t try to reconcile with the Lord our God by turning from our wrongdoing or by finding wisdom in your faithfulness .
CEB	Daniel	9	14	So the Lord oversaw the great trouble and brought it on us , because the Lord our God has been right in every move he ’ s made , but we haven ’ t listened to his voice .
CEB	Daniel	9	15	“ But now , my Lord , our God—you who brought your people out of Egypt with a strong hand , making a name for yourself even to this day : We have sinned and done the wrong thing. ”
CEB	Daniel	9	16	My Lord , please ! In line with your many righteous acts , please turn your raging anger from Jerusalem , which is your city , your own holy mountain . Because of our sins and the wrongdoing of our parents , both Jerusalem and your people have become a disgrace to all our neighbors .
CEB	Daniel	9	17	“ But now , our God , listen to your servant ’ s prayer and pleas for help . Shine your face on your ruined sanctuary , for your own sake , my Lord .
CEB	Daniel	9	18	Open your ears , my God , and listen ! Open your eyes and look at our devastation . Look at the city called by your name ! We pray our prayers for help to you , not because of any righteous acts of ours but because of your great compassion .
CEB	Daniel	9	19	My Lord , listen ! My Lord , forgive ! My Lord , pay attention and act ! Don ’ t delay ! My God , do all this for your own sake , because your city and your people are called by your name . Seventy weeks
CEB	Daniel	9	20	While I was still speaking , praying , and confessing my sin and the sins of my people Israel—while I was still praying my prayer for help to the Lord my God about my God ’ s holy mountain—
CEB	Daniel	9	21	while I was still speaking this prayer , the man Gabriel approached me at the time of the evening offering . This was the same Gabriel I had seen in my earlier vision . He was weary with exhaustion . [ a ]
CEB	Daniel	9	22	He explained as he spoke with me : “ Daniel , here ’ s why I ’ ve come : to give you insight and understanding .
CEB	Daniel	9	23	When you began making your requests , a word went out , and I ’ ve come to tell it to you because you are greatly treasured . So now understand this word and grasp the meaning of this vision !
CEB	Daniel	9	24	Seventy weeks are appointed for your people and for your holy city to complete the rebellion , to end sins , to cover over wrongdoing , to bring eternal righteousness , to seal up prophetic vision , and to anoint the most holy place .
CEB	Daniel	9	25	“ So you must know and gain wisdom about this : There will be seven weeks from the moment the word went out to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until a leader is anointed . And for sixty-two weeks the city will be rebuilt with a courtyard and a moat . But in difficult times ,
CEB	Daniel	9	26	after the sixty-two weeks , an anointed one will be eliminated . No one will support him . [ b ] The army of a future leader will destroy the city and the sanctuary . His [ c ] end will come in a flood , but devastations will be decreed until the end of the war . [ d ]
CEB	Daniel	9	27	For one week , he will make a strong covenant with many people . For a half-week , he will stop both sacrifices and offerings . In their place [ e ] will be the desolating monstrosities until the decreed destruction sweeps over the devastator. ” Footnotes - Daniel 9:21 Or approached me in swift flight at the time of the evening offering ; Heb uncertain - Daniel 9:26 Or and will have nothing or and will disappear ; Heb uncertain - Daniel 9:26 Or Its ( the army ’ s ) - Daniel 9:26 Heb uncertain - Daniel 9:27 Correction on the wing ; Heb uncertain
CEB	Daniel	10	10	But then a hand touched me , lifting me up to my hands and knees .
CEB	Daniel	10	2	During that time , I , Daniel , had been mourning for three weeks .
CEB	Daniel	10	3	I didn ’ t eat any rich foods . Neither meat nor wine passed my lips , and I didn ’ t clean up at all until the three weeks were up .
CEB	Daniel	10	4	Then , on the twenty-fourth day of the first month , as I was on the bank of the great Tigris River ,
CEB	Daniel	10	5	I looked up and suddenly saw a man clothed in linen in front of me . He had a brilliant gold belt around his waist ,
CEB	Daniel	10	6	and his body was like topaz . His face was like a flash of lightning , and his eyes were like burning torches . His arms and feet looked like polished bronze . When he spoke , it sounded like the roar of a crowd .
CEB	Daniel	10	7	Only I , Daniel , saw this vision . The other people who were with me didn ’ t see it . Despite that , they were terrified and ran away to hide .
CEB	Daniel	10	8	So I was left alone to see this great vision all by myself . All my strength left me . My energy was sapped , and I couldn ’ t stay strong .
CEB	Daniel	10	9	Then I heard the sound of the man ’ s words . When I heard it , I fell into a trance with my face on the ground .
CEB	Daniel	10	11	The man said to me , “ Daniel , you are greatly treasured . Now grasp the meaning of what I ’ m saying to you . And stand up , because I ’ ve been sent to you. ” As he said this to me , I stood up , shaking .
CEB	Daniel	10	12	Then the man said to me , “ Don ’ t be afraid , Daniel , because from the day you first set your mind to understand things and to humble yourself before your God , your words were heard . I ’ ve come because of your words !
CEB	Daniel	10	13	For twenty-one days the leader of the Persian kingdom blocked my way . But then Michael , one of the highest leaders , came to help me . I left Michael there with the leader of the Persian kingdom . [ a ]
CEB	Daniel	10	14	But I ’ ve come to help you understand what will happen to your people in the future , because there is another vision concerning that time. ”
CEB	Daniel	10	15	While he said this to me , I turned my face to the ground and kept quiet .
CEB	Daniel	10	16	But then someone who looked like a human being [ b ] touched my lips . Then I opened my mouth and spoke , saying to the person standing in front of me : “ My lord , the vision bothered me deeply , and I couldn ’ t stay strong during it .
CEB	Daniel	10	17	So how can I , my lord ’ s servant , speak with you , my lord ? Even now there ’ s no strength in me , and I can barely breathe. ”
CEB	Daniel	10	18	The one who looked like a human being touched me again and gave me strength .
CEB	Daniel	10	19	He said , “ Don ’ t be afraid . You are greatly treasured . All will be well with you . Be strong ! ” As he spoke to me , I suddenly felt strong . Then I said : “ My lord can go on , because you ’ ve made me strong. ”
CEB	Daniel	10	20	Then he said : “ Do you know why I have come to you ? Now I must go back to fight the leader of Persia . As I leave , the leader of Greece will come !
CEB	Daniel	10	21	But I will tell you what is written in the Scroll of Truth . No one stands strong with me against these leaders except your leader Michael . Footnotes - Daniel 10:13 LXX ; Heb after I was detained there with the kings of Persia - Daniel 10:16 Heb bene adam ( a son of a man ) is an idiom that means human being ; cf 7:13 .
CEB	Daniel	11	11	“ The southern king , in a bitter rage , will come out to battle the northern king . He will muster a huge army , but the army will be handed over to his enemy .
CEB	Daniel	11	2	I will now tell you the truth . Persia will have three more kings , but the fourth will be richer than all of them . Once he has become strong through his great riches , he will disturb everyone , including the Greek kingdom .
CEB	Daniel	11	3	Then a warrior-king will come forward , ruling over a vast empire and doing whatever he wants .
CEB	Daniel	11	4	But even as he takes control , his kingdom will be broken , divided to the four winds of heaven . It won ’ t pass to his descendants . No one will rule like he did because his kingdom will be uprooted . It will belong to others , not to these . South and north
CEB	Daniel	11	5	“ Then the southern king will gain power , but one of his princes will overpower him , ruling in his place . His empire will be vast .
CEB	Daniel	11	6	After some years , they will make an agreement together . The southern king ’ s daughter will go to the northern king to finalize the agreement , but she won ’ t retain her great power . Neither will his power remain in place . In those times she will be handed over , along with her escort , the one who fathered her , and the one who strengthened her . [ a ]
CEB	Daniel	11	7	“ A branch from her roots will rise up in his place . Attacking the army , he will enter the walled fortress of the northern king . He will fight with them , and he will conquer .
CEB	Daniel	11	8	He will even carry off their gods to Egypt , along with their statues and their silver and gold equipment . For years he will avoid the northern king .
CEB	Daniel	11	9	Then the northern king will attack the kingdom of the southern king , but will return to his own land .
CEB	Daniel	11	10	His sons will get ready for war , gathering massive forces . Their attack will be like an overwhelming flood . And they will attack again , taking the battle as far as his walled fortress .
CEB	Daniel	11	12	When the army is carried off , he will become confident . He will kill tens of thousands , but he will not stand strong .
CEB	Daniel	11	13	The northern king will then muster another army—this one bigger than the first . After some years have passed , he will attack with a large and well-equipped army .
CEB	Daniel	11	14	In those times , many will oppose the southern king . Violent persons from among your people also will rise up to support the vision , but they will fail .
CEB	Daniel	11	15	“ When the northern king attacks , he will throw up a siege ramp and occupy a walled city . The southern forces will not be able to resist—not even its elite forces . No one will be strong enough to resist .
CEB	Daniel	11	16	The one who comes to attack will do whatever he wants ; no one will be able to oppose him . He will take his place in the beautiful country , and he will hand out destruction .
CEB	Daniel	11	17	He will decide to occupy his entire kingdom by force . He will make an agreement with him and will give him a wife , intending to destroy him , [ b ] but it won ’ t succeed and it won ’ t happen . [ c ]
CEB	Daniel	11	18	He will turn his face to the coastlands , capturing many people . A commander will put an end to his disgrace , [ d ] even though he won ’ t repay that disgrace .
CEB	Daniel	11	19	Then he will turn his attention to the walled fortresses of his own country but will stumble , fall , and disappear .
CEB	Daniel	11	20	“ In his place one will arise who will send his agent to exact a kingdom ’ s glory , but in a few days he will be broken , though not by anger and not by war .
CEB	Daniel	11	21	A worthless person will arise in his place . Royal majesty will not have been given to him , but he will come in a time of security and seize the kingdom by deceitful means .
CEB	Daniel	11	22	Forces will be completely swept away and broken before him . The same is true for the leader of the covenant .
CEB	Daniel	11	23	From the moment they make an agreement with him , he will act deceitfully . He will gain power at the expense of a small nation .
CEB	Daniel	11	24	He will come into a province ’ s richest places untroubled and will do what his fathers and grandfathers never could . He will hand out plunder , spoil , and wealth to them . He will make plans against fortresses , but only for a time .
CEB	Daniel	11	25	“ Then with a large army he will gather his strength and courage against the southern king . The southern king , with a large and super powerful army , will prepare for war , but he won ’ t endure because they will make plans against him .
CEB	Daniel	11	26	Those who eat the king ’ s provisions will destroy him . His army will be overrun . Many will die .
CEB	Daniel	11	27	“ These two kings , with their minds set on evil , will sit at one table , telling lies , but with no success because the end will come at the set time .
CEB	Daniel	11	28	He will return to his country with great wealth and set his mind against a holy covenant . He will do what he wants and then return to his country .
CEB	Daniel	11	29	At the set time he will again battle against the south , but the second time will be different from the first .
CEB	Daniel	11	30	Kittim ships will fight against him , and he will retreat in fear . He will rage against a holy covenant and will do what he wants . Then he will pay special attention to those who violate a holy covenant .
CEB	Daniel	11	31	His forces will come and make the sanctuary fortress impure . They will stop the daily sacrifice and set up a desolating monstrosity .
CEB	Daniel	11	32	By deceitful means he will corrupt those who violate a covenant , but the people who acknowledge their God will stand strong and will act .
CEB	Daniel	11	33	“ The people ’ s teachers will help many understand , but for a time they will fall by sword and by flame , by captivity and by plunder .
CEB	Daniel	11	34	When they fall , they will receive a little help , but many will join them with deceitful plans .
CEB	Daniel	11	35	Some of the teachers too will fall in order that they might be refined , purified , and cleansed—until an end time , because it is still not yet the set time . An end to the arrogant king
CEB	Daniel	11	36	“ The king will do whatever he wants . He will exalt himself , making himself greater than any god . He will say unbelievable things against the God of gods . He will succeed until the doom is completed , because what is decreed must take place .
CEB	Daniel	11	37	He will give no thought to the gods of his fathers , nor to the god cherished by women . He will give no thought to any god , because he will make himself greater than all of them .
CEB	Daniel	11	38	In their place , he will worship a god of walled fortresses . With gold and silver , rare stones and precious things , he will worship a god his fathers did not acknowledge .

CEB	Hosea	1	1	The Lord ’ s word that came to Hosea , Beeri ’ s son , in the days of Judah ’ s Kings Uzziah , Jotham , Ahaz , and Hezekiah , and in the days of Israel ’ s King Jeroboam , Joash ’ s son . God commands Hosea to marry
CEB	Hosea	1	2	When the Lord first spoke through Hosea , the Lord said to him , “ Go , marry a prostitute and have children of prostitution , for the people of the land commit great prostitution by deserting the Lord. ”
CEB	Hosea	1	3	So Hosea went and took Gomer , Diblaim ’ s daughter , and she became pregnant and bore him a son .
CEB	Hosea	1	4	The Lord said to him , “ Name him Jezreel ; for in a little while I will punish the house of Jehu for the blood of Jezreel , and I will destroy the kingdom of the house of Israel .
CEB	Hosea	1	5	On that day I will break the bow of Israel in the Jezreel Valley. ”
CEB	Hosea	1	6	Gomer became pregnant again and gave birth to a daughter . Then the Lord said to Hosea , “ Name her No Compassion , because I will no longer have compassion on the house of Israel or forgive them .
CEB	Hosea	1	7	But I will have compassion on the house of Judah . I , the Lord their God , will save them ; I will not save them by bow , or by sword , or by war , or by horses , or by horsemen. ”
CEB	Hosea	1	8	When Gomer finished nursing No Compassion , she became pregnant and gave birth to a son .
CEB	Hosea	1	9	Then the Lord said , “ Name him Not My People because you are not my people , and I am not your God. ” [ a ] Hope for the future
CEB	Hosea	1	10	[ b ] Yet the number of the people of Israel will be like the sand of the sea , which can be neither measured nor numbered ; and in the place where it was said to them , “ You are not my people , ” it will be said to them , “ Children of the living God. ”
CEB	Hosea	1	11	The people of Judah and the people of Israel will be gathered together , and they will choose one head . They will become fruitful in the land .

CEB	Hosea	2	2	Level a charge against your mother ; plead with her ! She is not my wife , and I am not her husband . Let her remove prostitution from her presence , and adultery from between her breasts ,
CEB	Hosea	2	3	or else I will strip her naked and expose her as on the day she was born . I will make her like a desert , and turn her into a dry land , and make her die of thirst .
CEB	Hosea	2	4	I will also have no compassion on her children because they are children of prostitution .
CEB	Hosea	2	5	Their mother has played the prostitute ; she who conceived them has behaved shamefully . She said , “ I will seek out my lovers ; they give me my bread and my water , my wool and my linen cloth , my oil and my drink. ” Divine correction
CEB	Hosea	2	6	Therefore , I will line her path with thorns ; and I will build a wall against her , so that she can ’ t find her paths .
CEB	Hosea	2	7	She will go after her lovers , but she won ’ t catch up with them ; she will seek them , but she won ’ t find them . Then she will say , “ I will return to my first husband , for I had it better then than now. ”
CEB	Hosea	2	8	She didn ’ t know that I gave her the corn , the new wine , and the fresh oil , and that I gave her much silver , and gold that they used for Baal .
CEB	Hosea	2	9	So now I will take back my corn in its time , and my wine in its season ; and I will take away my wool and my linen cloth , which were to cover her nakedness .
CEB	Hosea	2	10	Now I will uncover her nakedness in plain view of her lovers , and no one will rescue her from me .
CEB	Hosea	2	11	I will end all her religious celebrations , her festivals , her new moons , her Sabbath days , and all her sacred seasons .
CEB	Hosea	2	12	I will destroy her vines and her fig trees , of which she said , “ These are my pay , which my lovers have given to me. ” I will change them into a forest , and the wild animals will eat them .
CEB	Hosea	2	13	I will punish her for the days dedicated to the Baals , when she offered sweet-smelling sacrifices to them and dressed herself up with rings and jewelry , and went after her lovers , and forgot me , says the Lord . Promises : restoration and covenant love
CEB	Hosea	2	14	Therefore , I will charm her , and bring her into the desert , and speak tenderly to her heart .
CEB	Hosea	2	15	From there I will give her vineyards , and make the Achor Valley a door of hope . There she will respond to me as in the days of her youth , like the time when she came out of the land of Egypt .
CEB	Hosea	2	16	On that day , says the Lord , you will call me , “ My husband , ” and no longer will you call me , “ My Lord. ”
CEB	Hosea	2	17	I will take away the names of the Baals from her mouth , and they will not be mentioned by name anymore .
CEB	Hosea	2	18	On that day , I will make a covenant for them with the wild animals , the birds in the sky , and the creeping creatures of the fertile ground . I will do away with the bow , the sword , and war from the land ; I will make you lie down in safety .
CEB	Hosea	2	19	I will take you for my wife forever ; I will take you for my wife in righteousness and in justice , in devoted love , and in mercy .
CEB	Hosea	2	20	I will take you for my wife in faithfulness ; and you will know the Lord .
CEB	Hosea	2	21	On that day I will answer , says the Lord . I will answer the heavens and they will answer the earth .
CEB	Hosea	2	22	The earth will answer the corn , the new wine , and the fresh oil , and they will answer Jezreel ;
CEB	Hosea	2	23	I will sow him for myself in the land ; and I will have compassion on No Compassion , and I will say to Not My People , “ You are my people ” ; and he will say , “ You are my God . ”
CEB	Hosea	3	3	I said to her , “ You must stay with me for many days ; you won ’ t act like a prostitute ; you won ’ t have sex with a man , nor I with you. ”
CEB	Hosea	3	2	So I bought her for fifteen pieces of silver , a large amount of barley , and a portion of wine . [ a ]
CEB	Hosea	3	4	Similarly , the Israelites will remain many days without king or prince , without sacrifice or sacred standing stone , without a priestly vest or household divine images .

CEB	Hosea	4	4	Yet let no one protest , and let no one complain . Listen , priest , I am angry with your people . [ a ]
CEB	Hosea	4	2	Swearing , lying , murder , together with stealing and adultery are common ; bloody crime followed by bloody crime .
CEB	Hosea	4	3	Therefore , the earth itself becomes sick , and all who live on it grow weak ; together with the wild animals and the birds in the sky , even the fish of the sea are dying .
CEB	Hosea	4	5	You will stumble by day ; and at nighttime so will your prophet , and I will destroy your mother .
CEB	Hosea	4	6	My people are destroyed from lack of knowledge . Since you have rejected knowledge , so I will reject you from serving me as a priest . Since you have forgotten the Instruction of your God , so also I will forget your children .
CEB	Hosea	4	7	The more they increased , the more they sinned against me ; they exchanged their glory for shame .
CEB	Hosea	4	8	They feed on the sin of my people ; they set their hearts on evil things .
CEB	Hosea	4	9	The priest will be just like the people ; I will punish them for their ways , and judge them for their deeds .
CEB	Hosea	4	10	They will eat but not be satisfied ; they will have sex like prostitutes , but they will not have children , because they have rejected the Lord to devote themselves to
CEB	Hosea	4	11	false religious practices . Description of Israel ’ s idolatry Wine and new wine destroy understanding .
CEB	Hosea	4	12	My people take advice from a piece of wood , and their divining rod gives them predictions . A spirit of prostitution has led them astray ; they have left God to follow other gods .
CEB	Hosea	4	13	They offer sacrifices on mountaintops , and make entirely burned offerings on hills ; they offer sacrifices under various green trees , because their shade is pleasant . Therefore , your daughters act like prostitutes , and your daughters-in-law commit adultery .
CEB	Hosea	4	14	I will not punish your daughters because they act like prostitutes , nor your daughters-in-law because they commit adultery ; for the men themselves visit prostitutes , and offer sacrifices with consecrated workers at temples ; so now the people without sense must come to ruin .
CEB	Hosea	4	15	Israel , even though you act like a prostitute , don ’ t let Judah become guilty . Don ’ t enter into Gilgal , or go up to Beth-aven , and don ’ t swear , “ As the Lord lives. ”

CEB	Hosea	5	2	In their wicked condition , they have sunk deep into corruption ; I will correct them through judgment .
CEB	Hosea	5	3	I know Ephraim ; Israel doesn ’ t escape my eye ; for now Ephraim you have acted like a prostitute ; Israel is defiled .
CEB	Hosea	5	4	Their deeds don ’ t allow them to return to their God , because the spirit of prostitution is within them , and they don ’ t know the Lord .
CEB	Hosea	5	6	With their sheep and their cattle they will go to seek the Lord , but they will not find him ; he has withdrawn from them .
CEB	Hosea	5	7	They have acted faithlessly against the Lord ; for their children have produced illegitimate children . Now the new moon will devour them [ a ] along with their fields .
CEB	Hosea	5	8	Blow a horn in Gibeah ; blow a trumpet in Ramah . Sound the warning at Beth-aven : “ Look behind you , Benjamin ! ”
CEB	Hosea	5	9	Ephraim will become a horrible place on the Judgment Day . Against the tribes of Israel I will certainly announce what is to take place .
CEB	Hosea	5	10	The princes of Judah act like raiders who steal the land ; I will pour out my anger like water upon them .
CEB	Hosea	5	11	Ephraim is under pressure from its enemies ; Ephraim ’ s rights aren ’ t protected . This is because Ephraim chose to pursue worthless things .
CEB	Hosea	5	12	Therefore , I am like a moth to Ephraim , and like decay to the house of Judah .
CEB	Hosea	5	13	When Ephraim saw his sickness , and Judah his wound , then Ephraim went to Assyria , and Ephraim sent for the great king . But he could not heal them ; nor could he cure their wound .
CEB	Hosea	5	14	I am like a lion to Ephraim , like a young lion to the house of Judah . I am the one who tears the prey and goes forth ; no one can snatch it from me .

CEB	Hosea	6	6	I desire faithful love and not sacrifice , the knowledge of God instead of entirely burned offerings .
CEB	Hosea	6	2	After two days he will revive us ; on the third day he will raise us up , so that we may live before him .
CEB	Hosea	6	3	Let ’ s know , let ’ s press on to know the Lord ; whose appearing is as certain as the dawn ; who will come to us like the showers , like the spring rains that give drink to the earth. ” Infidelity and divine retribution
CEB	Hosea	6	4	Ephraim , what will I do with you ? Judah , what will I do with you ? Your love is like a morning cloud , like the dew that vanishes quickly .
CEB	Hosea	6	5	Therefore , I have attacked them by the prophets , I have killed them by the words of my mouth , and my judgment goes forth like a light .
CEB	Hosea	6	7	But like Adam [ a ] they broke the covenant ; then they acted in bad faith against me .
CEB	Hosea	6	8	Gilead is a city of wicked people , tracked with blood .
CEB	Hosea	6	9	As robbers lie in wait for someone , so the priests are in league with each other ; they murder on the road to Shechem ; they have done evil things .

CEB	Hosea	7	3	By their wickedness they make the king glad , and give joy to the officials with their lies .

CEB	Hosea	12	14	Ephraim has given bitter offense ; so the Lord will bring his crimes down on him and pay him back for his wrongdoing . Footnotes - Hosea 12:1 12:2 in Heb
CEB	Hosea	13	13	The pangs of a woman in childbirth come for him , but he is not aware of the time to be born ; for at the proper time he doesn ’ t present himself at the mouth of the womb .
CEB	Hosea	13	2	And now they keep on sinning ; they have made metal images , idols of silver , as a result of their skill , all of them the work of craftsmen . “ Sacrifice to these , ” they say . People are kissing calves !
CEB	Hosea	13	3	Therefore , they will be like the morning mist , like the dew that passes away early , like husks that swirl from the threshing floor , or like smoke from a window .
CEB	Hosea	13	4	Yet I have been the Lord your God ever since the land of Egypt ; and you will know no other gods but me ; there is no savior besides me .
CEB	Hosea	13	5	I knew you in the wilderness , in the land of no rain .
CEB	Hosea	13	6	When I fed them , they were satisfied ; and their hearts became proud ; therefore , they forgot me . Consequences of infidelity
CEB	Hosea	13	7	So I will become like a lion to them ; like a leopard I will lurk beside the road .
CEB	Hosea	13	8	I will fall upon them like a bear robbed of her cubs , and I will tear open the covering of their hearts . I will devour them like a lion , as a wild animal would eat them .
CEB	Hosea	13	9	I will destroy you , Israel ; for you didn ’ t realize that I could help you .
CEB	Hosea	13	10	Where is your king now , so that he can save you ? Where in all your cities are your judges , of whom you said , “ Give me a king and rulers ” ?
CEB	Hosea	13	11	I gave you a king in my anger , and I took him away in my wrath .
CEB	Hosea	13	12	Ephraim ’ s wickedness is bound up ; his sin is kept in store .
CEB	Hosea	13	14	Will I ransom them from the power of the grave [ a ] Will I redeem them from death ’ s hold ? Death , where are your diseases ? Grave , [ b ] where is your destruction ? Compassion is hidden from my eyes .
CEB	Hosea	13	15	Although he may flourish among rushes , the east wind will come— the breath of God rising from the wilderness ; and his spring will dry up ; his fountain will be dried up . It will strip his household of every cherished possession .
CEB	Hosea	13	16	[ c ] Samaria will be desolate , because she has rebelled against her God ; by the sword they will fall— their babies will be dashed , and their pregnant women ripped open . Footnotes - Hosea 13:14 Heb Sheol - Hosea 13:14 Heb Sheol - Hosea 13:16 14:1 in Heb
CEB	Hosea	14	14	[ a ] Return , Israel , to the Lord your God ; you have stumbled because of your wickedness .
CEB	Hosea	14	2	Prepare to speak and return to the Lord ; say to the Lord , “ Forgive all wickedness ; and receive the good . Instead of bulls , let us offer what we can say :
CEB	Hosea	14	3	Assyria won ’ t save us ; we won ’ t ride upon horses ; we will no longer say , ‘ Our God , ’ to the work of our hands . In you the orphan finds compassion. ” Divine promise of healing
CEB	Hosea	14	4	I will heal their faithlessness ; I will love them freely , for my anger has turned from them .
CEB	Hosea	14	5	I will be like the dew to Israel ; he will blossom like the lily ; he will cast out his roots like the forests of Lebanon . [ b ]
CEB	Hosea	14	6	His branches will spread out ; his beauty will be like the olive tree , and his fragrance like that of Lebanon .
CEB	Hosea	14	7	They will again live beneath my shadow , they will flourish like a garden ; they will blossom like the vine , their fragrance will be like the wine of Lebanon .
CEB	Hosea	14	8	Ephraim , what do idols have to do with me ? It is I who answer and look after you . I am like a green cypress tree ; your fruit comes from me . Be careful
CEB	Hosea	14	9	Whoever is wise understands these things . Whoever observes carefully knows them . Truly , the Lord ’ s ways are right , and the righteous will walk in them , but evildoers will stumble in them . Footnotes - Hosea 14:1 14:2 in Heb - Hosea 14:5 Or like Lebanon
CEB	Joel	1	1	The Lord ’ s word that came to Joel , Pethuel ’ s son :
CEB	Joel	1	2	Hear this , elders ; pay attention , everyone in the land ! Has anything like this ever happened in your days , or in the days of your ancestors ? [ a ]
CEB	Joel	1	3	Tell it to your children , and have your children tell their children , and their children tell their children .
CEB	Joel	1	4	What the cutting locust left , the swarming locust has eaten . What the swarming locust left , the hopping locust has eaten . And what the hopping locust left , the devouring locust has eaten . [ b ]
CEB	Joel	1	5	Wake up , you who drink too much , and weep . Scream over the sweet wine , all you wine drinkers , because it is snatched from your mouth ;
CEB	Joel	1	6	because a nation , powerful and beyond number , has invaded my land . Its teeth are like lions ’ teeth ; its fangs are like those of a lioness .
CEB	Joel	1	7	It has destroyed my vines , splintered my fig trees , stripped off their bark and thrown it down ; their branches have turned white .
CEB	Joel	1	8	Lament like a woman dressed in funeral clothing , one who has lost the husband of her youth .
CEB	Joel	1	9	The grain offering and the drink offering are gone from the Lord ’ s temple . The priests and the Lord ’ s ministers mourn .
CEB	Joel	1	10	The fields are devastated , the ground mourns ; for the grain is destroyed , the new wine dries up , the olive oil fails .
CEB	Joel	1	11	Be shocked , you farmers ; howl , you vinedressers , over the wheat and the barley , for the crops of the field are destroyed .
CEB	Joel	1	12	The grapevine is dried up ; the fig tree withers . Pomegranate , palm , and apple— all the trees of the field are dried up . Joy fades away from the people . [ c ] Call to mourn
CEB	Joel	1	13	Dress for a funeral and grieve , you priests ; lament , ministers of the altar . Come , spend the night in funeral clothing , servants of my God , because the grain offering and the drink offering have gone from the temple of your God .
CEB	Joel	1	14	Demand a fast , request a special assembly . Gather the elders and all the land ’ s people to the temple of the Lord your God , and cry out to the Lord . Time of suffering
CEB	Joel	1	15	What a terrible day ! The day of the Lord is near ; it comes like chaos from the Almighty . [ d ]
CEB	Joel	1	16	Isn ’ t the food cut off right before our eyes ? Aren ’ t joy and gladness also gone from our God ’ s house ?
CEB	Joel	1	17	The grain shrivels under the shovels ; [ e ] the barns are empty . The granaries are in ruin because the grain has dried up .
CEB	Joel	1	18	How the animals groan ! Herds of cattle are in distress because there is no pasture for them ; even the flocks of sheep pant . The prophet ’ s prayer
CEB	Joel	1	19	To you , Lord , I cry , for fire has completely destroyed the pastures of the wilderness ; and flames have burned all the trees of the field .
CEB	Joel	1	20	Even the field ’ s wild animals cry to you because the streams have dried up ; the fire has completely destroyed the meadows of the wilderness .
CEB	Joel	2	2	a day of darkness and no light , a day of clouds and thick darkness ! Like blackness spread out upon the mountains , a great and powerful army [ a ] comes , unlike any that has ever come before them , or will come after them in centuries ahead .
CEB	Joel	2	3	In front of them a fire consumes ; and behind them a flame burns . Land ahead of them is like Eden ’ s garden , but they leave behind them a barren wasteland ; nothing escapes them .
CEB	Joel	2	4	They resemble horses , and like warhorses they charge ,
CEB	Joel	2	5	like the rumbling of chariots . They leap on the mountaintops— like the crackling of a fire ’ s flame , devouring the stubble ; like a powerful army ready for battle .
CEB	Joel	2	6	In their presence , peoples shake with fear ; all faces turn red with worry .
CEB	Joel	2	7	Like warriors they charge ; like soldiers they climb the wall . Each keeps to their own path ; they didn ’ t change their course .
CEB	Joel	2	8	They don ’ t crowd each other ; each keeps to their own path . Even if they fall among the weapons , they won ’ t stop .
CEB	Joel	2	9	They rush upon the city ; they run upon the walls . They climb into the houses ; they enter through the windows like thieves .
CEB	Joel	2	10	The earth quakes before them ; the heavens shake . The sun and the moon are darkened ; the stars have stopped shining ,
CEB	Joel	2	11	because the Lord utters his voice at the head of his army . How numerous are his troops ! Mighty are those who obey his word . The day of the Lord is great ; it stirs up great fear—who can endure it ? Change your hearts
CEB	Joel	2	12	Yet even now , says the Lord , return to me with all your hearts , with fasting , with weeping , and with sorrow ;
CEB	Joel	2	13	tear your hearts and not your clothing . Return to the Lord your God , for he is merciful and compassionate , very patient , full of faithful love , and ready to forgive .
CEB	Joel	2	14	Who knows whether he will have a change of heart and leave a blessing behind him , a grain offering and a drink offering for the Lord your God ?
CEB	Joel	2	15	Blow the horn in Zion ; demand a fast ; request a special assembly .
CEB	Joel	2	16	Gather the people ; prepare a holy meeting ; assemble the elders ; gather the children , even nursing infants . Let the groom leave his room and the bride her chamber .
CEB	Joel	2	17	Between the porch and the altar let the priests , the Lord ’ s ministers , weep . Let them say , “ Have mercy , Lord , on your people , and don ’ t make your inheritance a disgrace , an example of failure among the nations . Why should they say among the peoples , ‘ Where is their God ? ’ ” Words of compassion and promise
CEB	Joel	2	18	Then the Lord became passionate about this land , [ b ] and had pity on his people .
CEB	Joel	2	19	The Lord responded to the people : See , I am sending you the corn , new wine , and fresh oil , and you will be fully satisfied by it ; and I will no longer make you a disgrace among the nations .
CEB	Joel	2	20	I will remove the northern army far from you and drive it into a dried-up and desolate land , its front into the eastern sea , and its rear into the western sea . Its stench will rise up ; its stink will come to the surface . The Lord is about to do great things !
CEB	Joel	2	21	Don ’ t fear , fertile land ; rejoice and be glad , for the Lord is about to do great things !
CEB	Joel	2	22	Don ’ t be afraid , animals of the field , for the meadows of the wilderness will turn green ; the tree will bear its fruit ; the fig tree and grapevine will give their full yield .
CEB	Joel	2	23	Children of Zion , rejoice and be glad in the Lord your God , because he will give you the early rain as a sign of righteousness ; he will pour down abundant rain for you , the early and the late rain , as before . [ c ]
CEB	Joel	2	24	The threshing floors will be full of grain ; the vats will overflow with new wine and fresh oil .
CEB	Joel	2	25	I will repay you for the years that the cutting locust , the swarming locust , the hopping locust , and the devouring locust have eaten— my great army , which I sent against you .
CEB	Joel	2	26	You will eat abundantly and be satisfied , and you will praise the name of the Lord your God , who has done wonders for you ; and my people will never again be put to shame .
CEB	Joel	2	27	You will know that I am in the midst of Israel , and that I am the Lord your God—no other exists ; never again will my people be put to shame .
CEB	Joel	2	28	After that I will pour out my spirit upon everyone ; your sons and your daughters will prophesy , your old men will dream dreams , and your young men will see visions .
CEB	Joel	2	29	In those days , I will also pour out my spirit on the male and female slaves .
CEB	Joel	2	30	I will give signs in the heavens and on the earth—blood and fire and columns of smoke .
CEB	Joel	2	31	The sun will be turned to darkness , and the moon to blood before the great and dreadful day of the Lord comes .
CEB	Joel	2	32	But everyone who calls on the Lord ’ s name will be saved ; for on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will be security , as the Lord has promised ; and in Jerusalem , the Lord will summon those who survive .
CEB	Joel	3	3	and have cast lots for my people . They have traded boys for prostitutes , and sold girls for wine , which they drank down .
CEB	Joel	3	2	I will gather all the nations , and I will bring them to the Jehoshaphat Valley . There I will enter into judgment with them in support of my people and my possession , Israel , which they have scattered among the nations . They have divided my land ,
CEB	Joel	3	4	What are you to me , Tyre and Sidon , and all the regions of Philistia ? Are you paying me back for something ? If you are paying me back , then in a flash I will turn your deeds back upon your own heads .
CEB	Joel	3	5	You have taken my silver and my gold , and have carried my rich treasures into your temples .
CEB	Joel	3	6	You have sold the people of Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks , removing them far from their own border .
CEB	Joel	3	7	But now I am calling them from the places where you have sold them , and I will repay you for your deeds .
CEB	Joel	3	8	I will sell your sons and your daughters as a possession of the people of Judah , and they will sell them to the Sabeans , to a nation far away ; for the Lord has spoken . Declaration of war
CEB	Joel	3	9	Announce this among the nations : Prepare a holy war , wake up the warriors ; let all the soldiers draw near , let them come up !
CEB	Joel	3	10	Beat the iron tips of your plows into swords and your pruning tools into spears ; let the weakling say , “ I am mighty. ”
CEB	Joel	3	11	Come quickly , all you surrounding nations ; gather yourselves there ; bring your mighty ones , Lord .
CEB	Joel	3	12	Let the nations prepare themselves , and come up to the Jehoshaphat Valley ; for there I will sit to judge all the surrounding nations .
CEB	Joel	3	13	Cut with the sickle , for the harvest is ripe . Go and crush grapes , for the winepress is full . The jars overflow with wine , for their wickedness is great .
CEB	Joel	3	14	Crowd after crowd fills the valley of judgment , for the day of the Lord is near in the valley of judgment .
CEB	Joel	3	15	The sun and the moon are darkened ; the stars have ceased shining . Salvation for God ’ s people
CEB	Joel	3	16	The Lord roars from Zion , and utters his voice from Jerusalem ; the heavens and the earth quake . But the Lord is a refuge for his people , a shelter for the people of Israel .
CEB	Joel	3	17	So you will know that I am the Lord your God , settle down in Zion , my holy mountain . Jerusalem will be holy , and never again will strangers pass through it .
CEB	Joel	3	18	In that day the mountains will drip sweet wine , the hills will flow with milk , and all the streambeds of Judah will flow with water ; a spring will come forth from the Lord ’ s house and water the Shittim Valley .
CEB	Joel	3	19	Egypt will become desolate and Edom a desolate wilderness . This is because of the violence done to the people of Judah , in whose land they have shed innocent blood .
CEB	Joel	3	20	But Judah will be inhabited forever , and Jerusalem for all generations .
CEB	Joel	3	21	I will forgive their bloodguilt , which I had not forgiven . I will act on their account ; I will not pardon the guilty . The Lord dwells in Zion .
CEB	Amos	1	1	These are the words of Amos , one of the shepherds of Tekoa . He perceived these things concerning Israel two years before the earthquake , in the days of Judah ’ s King Uzziah and in the days of Israel ’ s King Jeroboam , Joash ’ s son . Proclamation of divine judgment
CEB	Amos	1	2	He said : The Lord roars from Zion . He shouts from Jerusalem ; the pastures of the shepherds wither , and the top of Carmel dries up . A word to Damascus
CEB	Amos	1	3	The Lord proclaims : For three crimes of Damascus , and for four , I won ’ t hold back the punishment , because they have harvested Gilead with sharp iron tools .
CEB	Amos	1	4	I will send down fire on the house of Hazael ; it will devour the palaces of Ben-hadad .
CEB	Amos	1	5	I will break the fortified gates of Damascus , and eliminate the people from the Aven Valley , including the one who rules from Beth-eden ; the people of Aram will be forced to live in Kir , says the Lord . A word to Gaza and Ashdod
CEB	Amos	1	6	The Lord proclaims : For three crimes of Gaza , and for four , I won ’ t hold back the punishment , because they rounded up entire communities , to hand them over to Edom .
CEB	Amos	1	7	I will send down a fire on the wall of Gaza ; it will devour Gaza ’ s palaces .
CEB	Amos	1	8	I will eliminate the people from Ashdod , the one who rules from Ashkelon . I will turn my hand against Ekron , and the Philistines who remain will perish , says the Lord God . A word to Tyre
CEB	Amos	1	9	The Lord proclaims : For three crimes of Tyre , and for four , I won ’ t hold back the punishment , because they have delivered up entire communities over to Edom , and neglected their covenantal obligations .
CEB	Amos	1	10	So I will send a fire on the wall of Tyre ; it will devour their palaces . A word to Edom
CEB	Amos	1	11	The Lord proclaims : For three crimes of Edom , and for four , I won ’ t hold back the punishment , because he chased after his brother with the sword , denied all compassion , kept his anger alive , and fueled his wrath forever .
CEB	Amos	1	12	So I will send a fire on Teman ; it will devour the fortresses of Bozrah . A word to Ammon
CEB	Amos	1	13	The Lord proclaims : For three crimes of the Ammonites , and for four , I won ’ t hold back the punishment , because they have ripped open pregnant women in Gilead in order to possess more land .
CEB	Amos	1	14	So I will start a fire at the wall of Rabbah ; the fire will devour its palaces , with a war cry on the day of battle , with strong wind on the day of the storm .
CEB	Amos	1	15	Then their king will be taken away , he and his officials together , says the Lord .
CEB	Amos	2	2	So I will send down a fire on Moab ; it will devour the palaces of Kerioth . Moab will die in a great uproar , with a war cry , with the sound of the ram ’ s horn .
CEB	Amos	2	3	I will remove their judge from them and slay all their officials with him , says the Lord . A word to Judah
CEB	Amos	2	4	The Lord proclaims : For three crimes of Judah , and for four , I won ’ t hold back the punishment , because they have rejected the Instruction of the Lord , and haven ’ t kept his laws . They have been led off the right path by the same lies after which their ancestors walked .
CEB	Amos	2	5	So I will send a fire on Judah , and it will devour the palaces of Jerusalem . A word to Israel
CEB	Amos	2	6	The Lord proclaims : For three crimes of Israel , and for four , I won ’ t hold back the punishment , because they have sold the innocent for silver , and those in need for a pair of sandals .
CEB	Amos	2	7	They crush the head of the poor into the dust of the earth , and push the afflicted out of the way . Father and son have intercourse with the same young woman , degrading my holy name .
CEB	Amos	2	8	They stretch out beside every altar on garments taken in loan ; in the house of their god they drink wine bought with fines they imposed .
CEB	Amos	2	9	Yet I destroyed the Amorite before them , whose height was as tall as cedar trees , and whose strength was as strong as oak trees . I destroyed his fruit above and his roots below .
CEB	Amos	2	10	Also I brought you up out of the land of Egypt , and led you forty years in the wilderness , to lay claim to the land of the Amorite .
CEB	Amos	2	11	I raised up some of your children to be prophets and some of your youth to be nazirites . Isn ’ t this so , people of Israel ? says the Lord .
CEB	Amos	2	12	But you made the nazirites drink wine , and commanded the prophets , saying , “ You won ’ t prophesy. ”
CEB	Amos	2	13	So now I will oppress you , just like a cart is weighed down [ a ] when it is full of harvested grain .
CEB	Amos	2	14	Fast runners will find no refuge ; the strong will lose their strength ; the mighty will be unable to save their lives .
CEB	Amos	2	15	Those who shoot the bow won ’ t survive . Fast runners won ’ t escape ; those who ride horses won ’ t save themselves .
CEB	Amos	2	16	The bravest warrior will flee away naked in that day , says the Lord . Footnotes - Amos 2:13 Heb uncertain
CEB	Amos	3	3	Will two people walk together unless they have agreed to do so ? [ a ]
CEB	Amos	3	2	You only have I loved so deeply of all the families of the earth . Therefore , I will punish you for all your wrongdoing .
CEB	Amos	3	4	Does a lion roar in the forest when it has no prey ? Does a young lion cry out from its den if it has caught nothing ?
CEB	Amos	3	5	Will a bird fall into a trap on the ground when there is no bait for it ? Will a trap spring up from the ground when it has taken nothing ?
CEB	Amos	3	6	If a ram ’ s horn is blown in a city , won ’ t people tremble ? If disaster falls on a city , is it the Lord who has done it ?
CEB	Amos	3	7	Surely the Lord God does nothing without revealing his secret to his servants the prophets .
CEB	Amos	3	8	A lion has roared ; who will not fear ? The Lord God has spoken ; who can but prophesy ?
CEB	Amos	3	9	Proclaim it to the palaces of Ashdod and to the palaces in the land of Egypt . Say , “ Gather yourselves on Mount Samaria , and see the great turmoil in the city , and what violent deeds are inside it. ”
CEB	Amos	3	10	They don ’ t know how to do right , says the Lord— those who store up violence and robbery in their palaces .
CEB	Amos	3	11	Therefore , the Lord my God proclaims : An enemy will surround the land ; he will bring you down from your protected places , and your palaces will be robbed .
CEB	Amos	3	12	The Lord proclaims : Just as the shepherd rescues two legs or the piece of an ear from the mouth of the lion , so will the people of Israel be rescued . Those who live in Samaria will escape with the corner of a bed , and those in Damascus with a piece of a couch . [ b ]
CEB	Amos	3	13	Hear this and speak against the house of Jacob , says the Lord God , the God of heavenly forces :
CEB	Amos	3	14	On the day I punish the crimes of Israel , I will also visit the altars of Bethel ; the horns of the altar will be cut off and will fall to the ground .
CEB	Amos	3	15	I will tear down the winter house as well as the summer house ; the houses of ivory will perish ; the great houses will be swept away , says the Lord .
CEB	Amos	4	4	Come to Bethel—and commit a crime ; multiply crimes at Gilgal . Bring your sacrifices every morning , your tenth-part gifts every three days .
CEB	Amos	4	2	The Lord God has solemnly promised by his holiness : The days are surely coming upon you , when they will take you away with hooks , even the last one of you with fishhooks .
CEB	Amos	4	3	You will go out through the broken wall , each one after another ; and you will be flung out into Harmon , says the Lord . A divine taunt
CEB	Amos	4	5	Offer a thanksgiving sacrifice of leavened bread , and publicize your gifts to the Lord ; for so you love to do , people of Israel ! says the Lord God . Israel ’ s stubbornness
CEB	Amos	4	6	I have sent a famine in all your cities , and not provided enough bread in all your places , yet you didn ’ t return to me , says the Lord .
CEB	Amos	4	7	I also withheld rain from you when there were still three months to the harvest . I allowed rain to fall on one city , no rain to fall on another city . One field was rained on , and the field dried up where it didn ’ t rain .
CEB	Amos	4	8	So two or three thirsty towns went to one city to drink water , and weren ’ t satisfied ; yet you didn ’ t return to me , says the Lord .
CEB	Amos	4	9	I struck you with disease and mildew . I destroyed your gardens and your vineyards . The locust devoured your fig trees and your olive trees ; yet you didn ’ t return to me , says the Lord .
CEB	Amos	4	10	I sent a plague against you like the one in Egypt . I killed your young men with the sword . I carried away your horses . I made the stink of your camp go up into your nostrils ; yet you didn ’ t return to me , says the Lord .
CEB	Amos	4	11	I destroyed some of you , as when God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah . You were like a burning coal plucked out of the fire ; yet you didn ’ t return to me , says the Lord .
CEB	Amos	4	12	Truly , Israel , I will act in this way toward you ; therefore , I will do this to you . Prepare to meet your God , Israel !
CEB	Amos	4	13	The one who forms the mountains , creates the wind , makes known his thoughts to humankind , makes the morning darkness , and moves over the heights of the earth— the Lord , the God of heavenly forces is his name !
CEB	Amos	5	5	But don ’ t seek Bethel , don ’ t enter into Gilgal , or cross over to Beer-sheba ; for Gilgal will go into exile , and Bethel will come to nothing .
CEB	Amos	5	2	Fallen , no more to rise , is virgin Israel , deserted on her land , with no one to raise her up .
CEB	Amos	5	3	The Lord God proclaims : The city that marched out one thousand people will have one hundred left , and the city that marched out one hundred will have ten left in the house of Israel . Words of encouragement
CEB	Amos	5	4	The Lord proclaims to the house of Israel : Seek me and live .
CEB	Amos	5	6	Seek the Lord and live , or else God might rush like a fire against the house of Joseph . The fire will burn up Bethel , with no one to put it out . Words of doom
CEB	Amos	5	7	Doom to you who turn justice into poison , and throw righteousness to the ground !
CEB	Amos	5	8	The one who made the Pleiades and Orion , and turns deep darkness into the morning , and darkens the day into night ; who summons the waters of the sea , and pours them out on the surface of the earth— this one ’ s name is the Lord—
CEB	Amos	5	9	who causes destruction to flash out against the strong , so that destruction comes upon the fortress .
CEB	Amos	5	10	They hate the one who judges at the city gate , and they reject the one who speaks the truth .
CEB	Amos	5	11	Truly , because you crush the weak , and because you tax their grain , you have built houses of carved stone , but you won ’ t live in them ; you have planted pleasant vineyards , but you won ’ t drink their wine .
CEB	Amos	5	12	I know how many are your crimes , and how numerous are your sins— afflicting the righteous , taking money on the side , turning away the poor who seek help .
CEB	Amos	5	13	Therefore , the one who is wise will keep silent in that time ; it is an evil time . Words of inspiration
CEB	Amos	5	14	Seek good and not evil , that you may live ; and so the Lord , the God of heavenly forces , will be with you just as you have said .
CEB	Amos	5	15	Hate evil , love good , and establish justice at the city gate . Perhaps the Lord God of heavenly forces will be gracious to what is left of Joseph . Divine wrath anticipated
CEB	Amos	5	16	Truly , the Lord proclaims , the God of heavenly forces , the Lord : Crying will be heard in all the squares . In all the streets they will say , “ Oh no ! Oh no ! ” They will call upon the farmers to wail , and those skilled in mourning to lament .
CEB	Amos	5	17	In all the vineyards there will be bitter crying because I will pass through your midst , says the Lord . A statement of divine disgust
CEB	Amos	5	18	Doom to those who desire the day of the Lord ! Why do you want the day of the Lord ? It is darkness , not light ;
CEB	Amos	5	19	as if someone fled from a lion , and was met by a bear ; or sought refuge in a house , rested a hand against the wall , and was bitten by a snake .
CEB	Amos	5	20	Isn ’ t the day of the Lord darkness , not light ; all dark with no brightness in it ?
CEB	Amos	5	21	I hate , I reject your festivals ; I don ’ t enjoy your joyous assemblies .
CEB	Amos	5	22	If you bring me your entirely burned offerings and gifts of food— I won ’ t be pleased ; I won ’ t even look at your offerings of well-fed animals .
CEB	Amos	5	23	Take away the noise of your songs ; I won ’ t listen to the melody of your harps .
CEB	Amos	5	24	But let justice roll down like waters , and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream .
CEB	Amos	5	25	Did you bring me sacrifices and offerings during the forty years in the wilderness , house of Israel ?
CEB	Amos	5	26	You will take up Sakkuth your king , and Kaiwan your star-god , your images , which you made for yourselves .
CEB	Amos	5	27	Therefore , I will take you away beyond Damascus , says the Lord , whose name is the God of heavenly forces .
CEB	Amos	6	6	who drink bowls of wine , put the best of oils on themselves , but who aren ’ t grieved over the ruin of Joseph !
CEB	Amos	6	2	Cross over to Calneh and see ; from there go to Hamath the great ; then go down to Gath of the Philistines . Are you better than these kingdoms ? Or is your territory greater than their territory ?
CEB	Amos	6	3	Doom to those who ignore the evil day and make violent rule draw near :
CEB	Amos	6	4	who lie on beds of ivory , stretch out on their couches , eat lambs from the flock , and bull calves from the stall ;
CEB	Amos	6	5	who sing idle songs to the sound of the harp , and , like David , compose tunes on musical instruments ;
CEB	Amos	6	7	Therefore , they will now be the first to be taken away , and the feast of those who lounged at the table will pass away .
CEB	Amos	6	8	The Lord God has solemnly sworn , says the Lord , the God of heavenly forces : I reject the pride of Jacob . I hate his fortresses . I will hand over the city and all that is in it .
CEB	Amos	6	9	If ten people remain in one house , then they will die .
CEB	Amos	6	10	If a relative , someone who burns the dead , picks up the body to bring it out of the house , and says to someone inside the house , “ Is anyone else with you ? ” the answer will be , “ No. ” Then the relative will say , “ Hush ! We mustn ’ t mention the name of the Lord. ”
CEB	Amos	6	11	Look , the Lord is giving an order ; he will shatter the great house into bits and the little house into pieces .
CEB	Amos	6	12	Do horses run on rocks ? Does one plow the sea with oxen ? But you have turned justice into poison and the fruit of righteousness into bitterness—
CEB	Amos	6	13	you who rejoice in Lo-debar , who say , “ Haven ’ t we by our own strength taken Karnaim for ourselves ? ”
CEB	Amos	6	14	Indeed , I will raise up against you a nation , house of Israel , says the Lord God of heavenly forces , and they will oppress you from Lebo-hamath to the desert ravine .
CEB	Amos	7	7	This is what the Lord showed me : The Lord was standing by a wall , with a plumb line in his hand .
CEB	Amos	7	2	When they had finished eating the green plants of the land , I said , “ Lord God , please forgive ! How can Jacob survive ? He is so small ! ”
CEB	Amos	7	3	The Lord relented concerning this : “ It won ’ t take place , ” says the Lord . A vision of fire
CEB	Amos	7	4	This is what the Lord God showed me : The Lord God was calling for judgment with fire , and it devoured the great deep and was eating up part of the land .
CEB	Amos	7	5	Then I said , “ Lord God , I beg you , stop ! How can Jacob survive ? He is so small ! ”
CEB	Amos	7	6	The Lord relented concerning this : “ This also won ’ t take place , ” says the Lord God . A vision of a plumb line
CEB	Amos	7	8	The Lord said to me , “ Amos , what do you see ? ” “ A plumb line , ” I said . Then the Lord said , “ See , I am setting a plumb line in the middle of my people Israel . I will never again forgive them .
CEB	Amos	7	9	The shrines of Isaac will be made desolate , and the holy places of Israel will be laid waste , and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword. ” Exchange between Amaziah , Jeroboam , and Amos
CEB	Amos	7	10	Then Amaziah , the priest of Bethel , reported to Israel ’ s King Jeroboam , “ Amos has plotted against you within the house of Israel . The land isn ’ t able to cope with everything that he is saying .
CEB	Amos	7	11	Amos has said , ‘ Jeroboam will die by the sword , and Israel will be forced out of its land. ’ ”
CEB	Amos	7	12	Amaziah said to Amos , “ You who see things , go , run away to the land of Judah , eat your bread there , and prophesy there ;
CEB	Amos	7	13	but never again prophesy at Bethel , for it is the king ’ s holy place and his royal house. ”
CEB	Amos	7	14	Amos answered Amaziah , “ I am [ a ] not a prophet , nor am I a prophet ’ s son ; but I am a shepherd , and a trimmer of sycamore trees .
CEB	Amos	7	15	But the Lord took me from shepherding the flock , and the Lord said to me , ‘ Go , prophesy to my people Israel. ’
CEB	Amos	7	16	“ Now then hear the Lord ’ s word . You say , ‘ Don ’ t prophesy against Israel , and don ’ t preach against the house of Isaac. ’
CEB	Amos	7	17	“ Therefore , the Lord proclaims : ‘ Your wife will become a prostitute in the city , and your sons and your daughters will fall by the sword , and your land will be measured and divided up ; you yourself will die in an unclean land , and Israel will surely be taken away from its land. ’ ” Footnotes - Amos 7:14 Or was ; the verb is implied .
CEB	Amos	8	8	Will not the land tremble on this account , and all who live in it mourn , as it rises and overflows like the Nile , and then falls again , like the River of Egypt ? [ b ]
CEB	Amos	8	2	He said , “ Amos , what do you see ? ” I said , “ A basket of summer fruit. ” Then the Lord said to me , “ The end has come upon my people Israel ; I will never again forgive them .
CEB	Amos	8	3	On that day , the people will wail the temple songs , ” says the Lord God ; “ there will be many corpses , thrown about everywhere . [ a ] Silence. ” Judgment on oppressors and hypocrites
CEB	Amos	8	4	Hear this , you who trample on the needy and destroy the poor of the land ,
CEB	Amos	8	5	saying , “ When will the new moon be over so that we may sell grain , and the Sabbath so that we may offer wheat for sale , make the ephah smaller , enlarge the shekel , and deceive with false balances ,
CEB	Amos	8	6	in order to buy the needy for silver and the helpless for sandals , and sell garbage as grain ? ”
CEB	Amos	8	7	The Lord has sworn by the pride of Jacob : Surely I will never forget what they have done .
CEB	Amos	8	9	On that day , says the Lord God , I will make the sun go down at noon , and I will darken the earth in broad daylight .
CEB	Amos	8	10	I will turn your feasts into sad affairs and all your singing into a funeral song ; I will make people wear mourning clothes and shave their heads ; I will make it like the loss of an only child , and the end of it like a bitter day .
CEB	Amos	8	11	The days are surely coming , says the Lord God , when I will send hunger and thirst on the land ; neither a hunger for bread , nor a thirst for water , but of hearing the Lord ’ s words .
CEB	Amos	8	12	They will wander from sea to sea , and from north to east ; they will roam all around , seeking the Lord ’ s word , but they won ’ t find it .
CEB	Amos	8	13	On that day the beautiful young women and the young men will faint with thirst .
CEB	Amos	8	14	Those who swear by the guilt of Samaria , and say , “ As your god lives , Dan , ” and , “ As the way of Beer-sheba lives ” — even they will fall and never rise again .
CEB	Amos	9	9	Look , I am giving orders , and I will shake the house of Israel among all the nations as one sifts dirt with a screen , but no pebble will fall to the ground .
CEB	Amos	9	2	If they dig through into the underworld , [ a ] from there my hand will take them . If they climb up to the heavens , from there I will bring them down .
CEB	Amos	9	3	If they hide themselves on the top of Carmel , I will search for them there and remove them . If they hide from my sight at the bottom of the sea , I will give an order to the sea serpent , and it will bite them .
CEB	Amos	9	4	If they are forced from their homes before their enemies , there I will give an order to the sword , and it will kill them . I will fix my eyes on them for harm and not for good . A divine confession
CEB	Amos	9	5	The Lord , God of heavenly forces , touches the earth and it melts , and all who live in it are sick to death . All of it [ b ] rises up like the Nile and sinks again , like the Nile of Egypt .
CEB	Amos	9	6	It is the Lord who builds his upper rooms in the heavens and establishes his residence upon the earth ; who summons the waters of the sea , and pours them out upon the face of the earth— the Lord is his name . Divine address to the Israelites
CEB	Amos	9	7	Aren ’ t you like the Cushites to me , people of Israel ? says the Lord . Haven ’ t I brought Israel up from the land of Egypt , and the Philistines from Caphtor and the Arameans from Kir ?
CEB	Amos	9	8	Look , the Lord God is eyeing the sinful kingdom , and I will destroy it from the face of the earth . However , I won ’ t destroy fully the house of Jacob , says the Lord . Warning to the house of Israel
CEB	Amos	9	10	All the sinners of my people will die by the sword , those who say , “ Evil won ’ t overtake or meet us. ” Divine promise of restoration
CEB	Amos	9	11	On that day I will raise up the meeting tent of David that has fallen , and repair its broken places . I will raise up its ruins , and I will rebuild it like a long time ago ;
CEB	Amos	9	12	so that they may possess what is left of Edom , as well as all the nations who are called by my name , says the Lord who will do this .
CEB	Amos	9	13	The days are surely coming , says the Lord , when the one who plows will overtake the one who gathers , when the one who crushes grapes will overtake the one who sows the seed . The mountains will drip wine , and all the hills will flow with it .
CEB	Amos	9	14	I will improve the circumstances of my people Israel ; they will rebuild the ruined cities and inhabit them . They will plant vineyards and drink their wine ; and they will make gardens and eat their fruit .
CEB	Amos	9	15	I will plant them upon their land , and they will never again be plucked up out of the land that I have given them , says the Lord your God .
CEB	Obadiah	1	1	The vision of Obadiah . The Lord God proclaims concerning Edom : We have heard a message from the Lord— a messenger has been sent among the nations : “ Rise up ! Let us rise against her for battle ! ”
CEB	Obadiah	1	2	Look now , I will make you of little importance among the nations ; you will be totally despised .
CEB	Obadiah	1	3	Your proud heart has tricked you— you who live in the cracks of the rock , whose dwelling is high above . You who say in your heart , “ Who will bring me down to the ground ? ”
CEB	Obadiah	1	4	Though you soar like the eagle , though your nest is set among the stars , I will bring you down from there , says the Lord . Edom is robbed
CEB	Obadiah	1	5	If thieves approach you , if robbers by night—how you ’ ve been devastated ! — wouldn ’ t they steal only what they wanted ? If those who gather grapes came to you , wouldn ’ t they leave some grapes ?
CEB	Obadiah	1	6	How Esau has been looted , his treasures taken away !
CEB	Obadiah	1	7	All those who were your allies have driven you to the border . Those who were on your side tricked you and triumphed over you . They are setting your own bread as a trap under you , [ a ] but you don ’ t see it coming .
CEB	Obadiah	1	8	Won ’ t I on that day , says the Lord , destroy the wise from Edom and understanding from Mount Esau ?
CEB	Obadiah	1	9	Your warriors will be shattered , Teman , and everyone from Mount Esau will be eliminated . Edom ’ s misdeeds
CEB	Obadiah	1	10	Because of the slaughter and violence done to your brother Jacob , shame will cover you , and you will be destroyed forever .
CEB	Obadiah	1	11	You stood nearby , strangers carried off his wealth , and foreigners entered his gates and cast lots for Jerusalem ; you too were like one of them .
CEB	Obadiah	1	12	But you should have taken no pleasure over your brother on the day of his misery ; you shouldn ’ t have rejoiced over the people of Judah on the day of their devastation ; you shouldn ’ t have bragged on their day of hardship .
CEB	Obadiah	1	13	You shouldn ’ t have entered the gate of my people on the day of their defeat ; you shouldn ’ t have even looked on his suffering on the day of his disaster ; you shouldn ’ t have stolen his possessions on the day of his distress .
CEB	Obadiah	1	14	You shouldn ’ t have waited on the roads to destroy his escapees ; you shouldn ’ t have handed over his survivors on the day of defeat .
CEB	Obadiah	1	15	The day of the Lord is near against all the nations . As you have done , so it will be done to you ; your actions will make you suffer !
CEB	Obadiah	1	16	Just as you have drunk on my holy mountain , so will all the nations around you drink ; they will drink and swallow quickly , and they will be like they ’ ve never been before . Edom ’ s punishers
CEB	Obadiah	1	17	But on Mount Zion there will be those who escape , and it will be holy ; and the house of Jacob will drive out those who drove them out .
CEB	Obadiah	1	18	The house of Jacob will be a fire , the house of Joseph a flame , and the house of Esau straw ; they will burn them up completely , and there will be no one left of the house of Esau , for the Lord has spoken .
CEB	Obadiah	1	19	Those of the arid southern plain will possess Mount Esau , and those of the western foothills , the land of the Philistines ; they will possess the land of Ephraim and the land of Samaria , and Benjamin will possess Gilead .
CEB	Obadiah	1	20	Those who remain of the Israelites will possess the land of the Canaanites as far as Zarephath ; and those left from Jerusalem and who are now living in Sepharad will possess the cities of the arid southern plain .
CEB	Obadiah	1	21	The deliverers will go up to Mount Zion to rule Mount Esau , and the kingdom will be the Lord ’ s . Footnotes - Obadiah 1:7 Heb uncertain
CEB	Jonah	1	1	The Lord ’ s word came to Jonah , Amittai ’ s son :
CEB	Jonah	1	2	“ Get up and go to Nineveh , that great city , and cry out against it , for their evil has come to my attention. ”
CEB	Jonah	1	3	So Jonah got up—to flee to Tarshish from the Lord ! He went down to Joppa and found a ship headed for Tarshish . He paid the fare and went aboard to go with them to Tarshish , away from the Lord .
CEB	Jonah	1	4	But the Lord hurled a great wind upon the sea , so that there was a great storm on the sea ; the ship looked like it might be broken to pieces .
CEB	Jonah	1	5	The sailors were terrified , and each one cried out to his god . They hurled the cargo that was in the ship into the sea to make it lighter . Now Jonah had gone down into the hold of the vessel to lie down and was deep in sleep .
CEB	Jonah	1	6	The ship ’ s officer came and said to him , “ How can you possibly be sleeping so deeply ? Get up ! Call on your god ! Perhaps the god will give some thought to us so that we won ’ t perish. ”
CEB	Jonah	1	7	Meanwhile , the sailors said to each other , “ Come on , let ’ s cast lots so that we might learn who is to blame for this evil that ’ s happening to us. ” They cast lots , and the lot fell on Jonah .
CEB	Jonah	1	8	So they said to him , “ Tell us , since you ’ re the cause of this evil happening to us : What do you do and where are you from ? What ’ s your country and of what people are you ? ”
CEB	Jonah	1	9	He said to them , “ I ’ m a Hebrew . I worship the Lord , the God of heaven—who made the sea and the dry land. ”
CEB	Jonah	1	10	Then the men were terrified and said to him , “ What have you done ? ” ( The men knew that Jonah was fleeing from the Lord , because he had told them . )
CEB	Jonah	1	11	They said to him , “ What will we do about you so that the sea will become calm around us ? ” ( The sea was continuing to rage . )
CEB	Jonah	1	12	He said to them , “ Pick me up and hurl me into the sea ! Then the sea will become calm around you . I know it ’ s my fault that this great storm has come upon you. ”
CEB	Jonah	1	13	The men rowed to reach dry land , but they couldn ’ t manage it because the sea continued to rage against them .
CEB	Jonah	1	14	So they called on the Lord , saying , “ Please , Lord , don ’ t let us perish on account of this man ’ s life , and don ’ t blame us for innocent blood ! You are the Lord : whatever you want , you can do. ”
CEB	Jonah	1	15	Then they picked up Jonah and hurled him into the sea , and the sea ceased its raging .
CEB	Jonah	1	16	The men worshipped the Lord with a profound reverence ; they offered a sacrifice to the Lord and made solemn promises . No escape for the prophet
CEB	Jonah	1	17	[ a ] Meanwhile , the Lord provided a great fish to swallow Jonah . Jonah was in the belly of the fish for three days and three nights . Footnotes - Jonah 1:17 2:1 in Heb
CEB	Jonah	2	2	“ I called out to the Lord in my distress , and he answered me . From the belly of the underworld [ a ] I cried out for help ; you have heard my voice .
CEB	Jonah	2	3	You had cast me into the depths in the heart of the seas , and the flood surrounds me . All your strong waves and rushing water passed over me .
CEB	Jonah	2	4	So I said , ‘ I have been driven away from your sight . Will I ever again look on your holy temple ?
CEB	Jonah	2	5	Waters have grasped me to the point of death ; the deep surrounds me . Seaweed is wrapped around my head
CEB	Jonah	2	6	at the base of the undersea [ b ] mountains . I have sunk down to the underworld ; its bars held me with no end in sight . But you brought me out of the pit. ’
CEB	Jonah	2	7	When my endurance [ c ] was weakening , I remembered the Lord , and my prayer came to you , to your holy temple .
CEB	Jonah	2	8	Those deceived by worthless things lose their chance for mercy . [ d ]
CEB	Jonah	2	9	But me , I will offer a sacrifice to you with a voice of thanks . That which I have promised , I will pay . Deliverance belongs to the Lord ! ”
CEB	Jonah	2	10	Then the Lord spoke to the fish , and it vomited Jonah onto the dry land .
CEB	Jonah	3	3	And Jonah got up and went to Nineveh , according to the Lord ’ s word . ( Now Nineveh was indeed an enormous city , a three days ’ walk across . )
CEB	Jonah	3	2	“ Get up and go to Nineveh , that great city , and declare against it the proclamation that I am commanding you. ”
CEB	Jonah	3	4	Jonah started into the city , walking one day , and he cried out , “ Just forty days more and Nineveh will be overthrown ! ”
CEB	Jonah	3	5	And the people of Nineveh believed God . They proclaimed a fast and put on mourning clothes , from the greatest of them to the least significant .
CEB	Jonah	3	6	When word of it reached the king of Nineveh , he got up from his throne , stripped himself of his robe , covered himself with mourning clothes , and sat in ashes .
CEB	Jonah	3	7	Then he announced , “ In Nineveh , by decree of the king and his officials : Neither human nor animal , cattle nor flock , will taste anything ! No grazing and no drinking water !
CEB	Jonah	3	8	Let humans and animals alike put on mourning clothes , and let them call upon God forcefully ! And let all persons stop their evil behavior and the violence that ’ s under their control ! ”
CEB	Jonah	3	9	He thought , Who knows ? God may see this and turn from his wrath , so that we might not perish . [ a ]
CEB	Jonah	3	10	God saw what they were doing—that they had ceased their evil behavior . So God stopped planning to destroy them , and he didn ’ t do it . Footnotes - Jonah 3:9 Heb lacks He thought .
CEB	Jonah	4	4	The Lord responded , “ Is your anger a good thing ? ”
CEB	Jonah	4	2	He prayed to the Lord , “ Come on , Lord ! Wasn ’ t this precisely my point when I was back in my own land ? This is why I fled to Tarshish earlier ! I know that you are a merciful and compassionate God , very patient , full of faithful love , and willing not to destroy .
CEB	Jonah	4	3	At this point , Lord , you may as well take my life from me , because it would be better for me to die than to live. ”
CEB	Jonah	4	5	But Jonah went out from the city and sat down east of the city . There he made himself a hut and sat under it , in the shade , to see what would happen to the city .
CEB	Jonah	4	6	Then the Lord God provided a shrub , [ a ] and it grew up over Jonah , providing shade for his head and saving him from his misery . Jonah was very happy about the shrub .
CEB	Jonah	4	7	But God provided a worm the next day at dawn , and it attacked the shrub so that it died .
CEB	Jonah	4	8	Then as the sun rose God provided a dry east wind , and the sun beat down on Jonah ’ s head so that he became faint . He begged that he might die , saying , “ It ’ s better for me to die than to live. ”
CEB	Jonah	4	9	God said to Jonah , “ Is your anger about the shrub a good thing ? ” Jonah said , “ Yes , my anger is good—even to the point of death ! ”
CEB	Jonah	4	10	But the Lord said , “ You ‘ pitied ’ the shrub , for which you didn ’ t work and which you didn ’ t raise ; it grew in a night and perished in a night .
CEB	Jonah	4	11	Yet for my part , can ’ t I pity Nineveh , that great city , in which there are more than one hundred twenty thousand people who can ’ t tell their right hand from their left , and also many animals ? ” Footnotes - Jonah 4:6 Botanists disagree about whether Heb qiqayon refers to a climbing gourd plant , a castor bean plant , or some other shrub .
CEB	Micah	1	1	The Lord ’ s word that came to Micah of Moresheth in the days of Judah ’ s Kings Jotham , Ahaz , and Hezekiah , which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem :
CEB	Micah	1	2	Listen , all you peoples ! Pay attention , earth , and all that fills it ! May the Lord God be a witness against you , the Lord from his holy temple .
CEB	Micah	1	3	Look ! The Lord is coming out from his place ; he will go down and tread on the shrines of the earth .
CEB	Micah	1	4	Then the mountains will melt under him ; the valleys will split apart , like wax yielding to the fire , like waters poured down a slope .
CEB	Micah	1	5	All this is for the crime of Jacob and the sins of the house of Israel . Who is responsible for the crime of Jacob ? [ a ] Isn ’ t it Samaria ? Who is responsible for [ b ] the shrines of Judah ? Isn ’ t it Jerusalem ?
CEB	Micah	1	6	So I will make Samaria a pile of rubble in the open field , a place for planting vineyards . I will pour her stones into the valley ; her foundations I will lay bare .
CEB	Micah	1	7	All her images will be beaten to pieces ; all her wages will be burned ; I will make all her idols worthless . Since she gathered them from the wages of a prostitute , they will again become wages of a prostitute .
CEB	Micah	1	8	On account of this , I will cry out and howl ; I will go about barefoot and stripped . I will cry out like the jackals , and mourn like the ostriches . Destruction looms
CEB	Micah	1	9	Indeed , Zion has been weakened by her wounds ! It has come as far as Judah ; he has struck as far as the gate of my people , as far as Jerusalem .
CEB	Micah	1	10	In Gath tell it not ; no need to weep there ! [ c ] In Beth-le-aphrah , roll yourself in the dust !
CEB	Micah	1	11	Pass by ( for your sake ) , [ d ] inhabitants of Shaphir ! In nakedness and shame she will not go out , inhabitants of Zaanan . The cry of Beth-ezel will take away from you [ e ] any place to stand .
CEB	Micah	1	12	How she longs for good , inhabitants of Maroth ! Calamity has come down from the Lord to the gate of Jerusalem .
CEB	Micah	1	13	Harness the horses to the chariot , inhabitants of Lachish ! It was the beginning of sin for Daughter Zion ; the crimes of Israel have been found in you .
CEB	Micah	1	14	Therefore , you will give good-bye gifts to Moresheth-gath ; the houses of Achzib have become a deception for the kings of Israel .
CEB	Micah	1	15	Again I will bring to you the one who conquers , inhabitants of Mareshah ; the glory of Israel will come as far as Adullam .
CEB	Micah	1	16	Make yourself bald and cut off your hair because of your cherished children ! Make yourself as bald as the vulture , for they have gone from you into exile .

CEB	Micah	2	3	Therefore , the Lord proclaims : I myself am devising an evil against this family from which you will not be able to remove your necks ! You will no longer be able to go about arrogantly , for it will be an evil time .
CEB	Micah	2	4	On that day , a taunt will be raised against you ; someone will wail bitterly : “ We are utterly destroyed ! He exchanges the portion of my people ; he removes what belongs to me ; he gives away our fields to a rebel. ”
CEB	Micah	2	5	Therefore , you will have no one to set boundary lines by lot in the Lord ’ s assembly . Leaders unwilling to hear God ’ s word
CEB	Micah	2	6	“ They mustn ’ t preach ! ” so they preach . “ They mustn ’ t preach of such things ! Disgrace won ’ t overtake us. ”
CEB	Micah	2	7	( Should this be said , house of Jacob ? ) “ Is the Lord ’ s patience cut short ? Are these his deeds ? ” Don ’ t my words help the one who behaves righteously ?
CEB	Micah	2	8	But yesterday , my people , the Lord rose up as an enemy . [ a ] You strip off the glorious clothes [ b ] from trusting passersby , those who reject war .
CEB	Micah	2	9	You drive out the women of my people , each from her cherished house ; from their young children you take away my splendor forever .
CEB	Micah	2	10	Rise up and go ! This can ’ t be the resting place ; because of its uncleanness , it destroys and the destruction is horrific .
CEB	Micah	2	11	If someone were to go about inspired and say deceitfully : “ I will preach to you for wine and liquor , ” such a one would be the preacher for this people ! The false prophet ’ s “ peace ” will be destruction
CEB	Micah	2	12	I ’ ll surely gather Jacob—all of you ! I ’ ll surely assemble you , those who are left of Israel ! I ’ ll put them together like sheep in Bozrah , [ c ] like a flock in its pen , noisy with people .

CEB	Micah	3	4	Then they will cry out to the Lord , but he won ’ t answer them . He will hide his face from them at that time , because of their evil deeds .
CEB	Micah	3	5	The Lord proclaims concerning the prophets , those who lead my people astray , those who chew with their teeth and then proclaim “ Peace ! ” but stir up war against the one who puts nothing in their mouths :
CEB	Micah	3	6	Therefore , it will become night for you , without vision , only darkness without divination ! The sun will set on the prophets ; the day will be dark upon them .
CEB	Micah	3	7	Those seeing visions will be ashamed , and the diviners disgraced ; they will all cover their upper lips , [ a ] for there will be no answer from God .
CEB	Micah	3	8	But me ! I am filled with power , with the spirit of the Lord , with justice and might , to declare to Jacob his wrongdoing and to Israel his sin !
CEB	Micah	3	9	Hear this , leaders of the house of Jacob , rulers of the house of Israel , you who reject justice and make crooked all that is straight ,
CEB	Micah	3	10	who build Zion with bloodshed and Jerusalem with injustice !

CEB	Micah	4	5	Each of the peoples walks in the name of their own god ; but as for us , we will walk in the name of the Lord our God forever and always . Dominion in Zion
CEB	Micah	4	6	On that day , says the Lord , I will gather the lame ; I will assemble those who were driven away and those whom I have harmed .
CEB	Micah	4	7	I will make the lame into survivors , those driven away into a mighty nation . The Lord will rule over them on Mount Zion from now on and forever .

CEB	Nahum	1	14	The Lord has commanded concerning you : You will have no children to carry on your name . I will remove carved idol and cast image from the house of your gods ; I will make your grave , for you are worthless .

CEB	Nahum	3	6	I will throw disgusting things at you ; I will treat you with contempt and make you a spectacle .
CEB	Nahum	3	7	Then all who look at you will recoil from you and say , “ Nineveh has been devastated ! Who will lament for her ? ” Where could I possibly seek comforters for you ?
CEB	Nahum	3	8	Are you better than Thebes , situated by the Nile , waters surrounding her , whose fortress is sea and whose city wall is waters ?

CEB	Habakkuk	1	2	Lord , how long will I call for help and you not listen ? I cry out to you , “ Violence ! ” but you don ’ t deliver us .
CEB	Habakkuk	1	3	Why do you show me injustice and look at anguish so that devastation and violence are before me ? There is strife , and conflict abounds .
CEB	Habakkuk	1	4	The Instruction is ineffective . Justice does not endure because the wicked surround the righteous . Justice becomes warped . The Lord responds
CEB	Habakkuk	1	5	Look among the nations and watch ! Be astonished and stare because something is happening in your days that you wouldn ’ t believe even if told .
CEB	Habakkuk	1	6	I am about to rouse the Chaldeans , that bitter and impetuous nation , which travels throughout the earth to possess dwelling places it does not own .
CEB	Habakkuk	1	7	The Chaldean is dreadful and fearful . He makes his own justice and dignity . [ a ]
CEB	Habakkuk	1	8	His horses are faster than leopards ; they are quicker than wolves of the evening . His horsemen charge forward ; his horsemen come from far away . They fly in to devour , swiftly , like an eagle . [ b ]
CEB	Habakkuk	1	9	They come for violence , the horde with all their faces set toward the desert . [ c ] He takes captives like sand .

CEB	Habakkuk	1	11	He passes through like the wind and invades ; but he will be held guilty , the one whose strength is his god . The prophet questions the Lord
CEB	Habakkuk	1	12	Lord , aren ’ t you ancient , my God , my holy one ? Don ’ t let us die . [ d ] Lord , you put the Chaldean here for judgment . Rock , you established him as a rebuke .
CEB	Habakkuk	1	13	Your eyes are too pure to look on evil ; you are unable to look at disaster . Why would you look at the treacherous or keep silent when the wicked swallows one who is more righteous ?
CEB	Habakkuk	1	14	You made humans like the fish of the sea , like creeping things with no one to rule over them .
CEB	Habakkuk	1	15	The Chaldean brings all of them up with a fishhook . He drags them away with a net ; he collects them in his fishing net , then he rejoices and celebrates .
CEB	Habakkuk	1	16	Therefore , he sacrifices to his net ; he burns incense to his fishing nets , because due to them his portion grows fat and his food becomes luxurious .

CEB	Habakkuk	2	4	Some people ’ s desires are truly audacious ; [ d ] they don ’ t do the right thing . But the righteous person will live honestly .
CEB	Habakkuk	2	5	Moreover , wine betrays an arrogant man . He doesn ’ t rest . He opens his jaws [ e ] like the grave ; [ f ] like death , he is never satisfied . He gathers all nations to himself and collects all peoples for himself .
CEB	Habakkuk	2	6	Won ’ t everyone tell parables about him or mocking poems concerning him ? They will say : Doom to the one who multiplies what doesn ’ t belong to him and who increases his own burden . How long ?
CEB	Habakkuk	2	7	Won ’ t they suddenly rise up to bite you ? Those who frighten you will awaken ; you will become plunder for them .
CEB	Habakkuk	2	8	Since you yourself have plundered many nations , all the rest of the peoples will plunder you because of the human bloodshed and the violence done to the earth , to every village , and to all its inhabitants .
CEB	Habakkuk	2	9	Doom to the one making evil gain for his own house , for putting his own nest up high , for delivering himself from the grasp of calamity .
CEB	Habakkuk	2	10	You plan shame for your own house , cutting off many peoples and sinning against your own life .
CEB	Habakkuk	2	11	A stone will cry out from a village wall , and a tree branch will respond .
CEB	Habakkuk	2	12	Pity the one building a city with bloodshed and founding a village with injustice .
CEB	Habakkuk	2	13	Look , isn ’ t this from the Lord of heavenly forces ? Peoples grow weary from making just enough fire ; nations become tired for nothing . [ g ]
CEB	Habakkuk	2	14	But the land will be full of the knowledge of the Lord ’ s glory , just as water covers the sea .
CEB	Habakkuk	2	15	Doom to the one who makes his companions drunk , pouring out your wrath in order to see them naked . [ h ]
CEB	Habakkuk	2	16	You have drunk your fill of dishonor rather than glory . So drink and stagger . [ i ] The cup of the Lord ’ s strong hand will come around to you ; disgrace will engulf you .
CEB	Habakkuk	2	17	Because of the violence done to Lebanon , he will overwhelm you ; the destruction of animals will terrify you , as will human bloodshed and violence throughout the land , the villages , and all their inhabitants . [ j ]
CEB	Habakkuk	2	18	Of what value is an idol , when its potter carves it , or a cast image that has been shaped ? It is a teacher of lies , for the potter trusts the pottery , though it is incapable of speaking .
CEB	Habakkuk	2	19	Doom to the one saying to the tree , “ Wake up ! ” or “ Get up ” to the silent stone . Does it teach ? Look , it is overlaid with gold and silver , but there is no breath within it .

CEB	Zephaniah	2	3	Seek the Lord , all you humble of the land who practice his justice ; seek righteousness ; seek humility . Maybe you will be hidden on the day of the Lord ’ s anger . Oracles against foreign nations
CEB	Zephaniah	2	4	Gaza will certainly be abandoned ; and Ashkelon destroyed . Ashdod will be driven out at noon ; Ekron will be uprooted .
CEB	Zephaniah	2	5	Doom , inhabitants of the seacoast , nation of Cretans . The Lord ’ s word is against you , Canaan , land of the Philistines . I will exterminate you , leaving no inhabitant .
CEB	Zephaniah	2	6	The seacoast will become pastureland , with wells for shepherds and pens for the flocks .
CEB	Zephaniah	2	7	The coast will belong to the survivors from the house of Judah ; they will pasture beside the sea ; [ b ] in the houses of Ashkelon they will lie down in the evening . The Lord their God will visit them and restore their possessions .
CEB	Zephaniah	2	8	I have heard the taunting of Moab and the defamation of the Ammonites ; they taunted my people and enlarged their borders .
CEB	Zephaniah	2	9	Therefore , as I live— says the Lord of heavenly forces , the God of Israel— Moab will become like Sodom and the Ammonites like Gomorrah : a plot of weeds , salt pits , and devastation forever . The few remaining from my people will plunder them ; the rest of my nation will possess them .
CEB	Zephaniah	2	10	This will happen on account of their pride , because they taunted and boasted over the people of the Lord of heavenly forces .
CEB	Zephaniah	2	11	The Lord will terrify them ; he will make all the gods of the earth disappear . All the coastlands of the nations will bow down to the Lord , each one in its own place .
CEB	Zephaniah	2	12	Moreover , you too , Cushites , will be pierced by my sword .
CEB	Zephaniah	2	13	He will stretch out his hand against the north and will cause Assyria to perish . Let him make Nineveh a desolation , a desolate place like the wilderness .
CEB	Zephaniah	2	14	Flocks will lie down in its midst , every living thing of the nation . Moreover , the owl and the porcupine will spend the night on its columns . A bird ’ s call will resound from the window . Desolation will be on the sill , for the cedar will be stripped bare .
CEB	Zephaniah	2	15	This is the jubilant city , the one dwelling securely , the one saying in her heart , I , and no one else , will endure forever . How she has become a desolation , a resting place for the wild animals . All those who pass through her hiss and shake their fist . Footnotes - Zephaniah 2:2 Heb uncertain - Zephaniah 2:7 Or they will pasture by them .
CEB	Zephaniah	3	3	The princes in her midst are roaring lions . Her judges are wolves of the evening ; they leave nothing for the morning .
CEB	Zephaniah	3	2	She listened to no voice ; she accepted no discipline . She didn ’ t trust in the Lord , nor did she draw near to her God .
CEB	Zephaniah	3	4	Her prophets are reckless , men of treachery . Her priests pollute that which is holy ; they do violence to the Instruction .
CEB	Zephaniah	3	5	The Lord is righteous in her midst . He does nothing unjust . Morning by morning he renders justice , but the unrighteous one knows no shame .
CEB	Zephaniah	3	6	I will cut off nations ; their towers will be destroyed ; I will devastate their streets . No one will pass through . Their cities will be laid waste . There will be no person , no inhabitant left .
CEB	Zephaniah	3	7	I said , “ Surely , she will fear me ; she will take instruction so that her habitation won ’ t be cut off [ a ] because of everything I did to her. ” However , they rose early to corrupt their deeds .
CEB	Zephaniah	3	8	Therefore , wait for me , says the Lord , wait for the day when I rise up as a witness , [ b ] when I decide to gather nations , to collect kingdoms , to pour out my indignation upon them , all the heat of my anger . In the fire of my jealousy , all the earth will be devoured . Restoration of the nations and Jerusalem
CEB	Zephaniah	3	9	Then I will change the speech of the peoples into pure speech , that all of them will call on the name of the Lord and will serve him as one . [ c ]
CEB	Zephaniah	3	10	From beyond the rivers of Cush , my daughter , my dispersed ones , will bring me offerings .
CEB	Zephaniah	3	11	On that day , you won ’ t be ashamed of all your deeds with which you sinned against me ; then I will remove from your midst those boasting with pride . No longer will you be haughty on my holy mountain ,
CEB	Zephaniah	3	12	but I will cause a humble and powerless people to remain in your midst ; they will seek refuge in the name of the Lord .
CEB	Zephaniah	3	13	The few remaining from Israel won ’ t commit injustice ; they won ’ t tell lies ; a deceitful tongue won ’ t be found on their lips . They will graze and lie down ; no one will make them afraid .
CEB	Zephaniah	3	14	Rejoice , Daughter Zion ! Shout , Israel ! Rejoice and exult with all your heart , Daughter Jerusalem .
CEB	Zephaniah	3	15	The Lord has removed your judgment ; he has turned away your enemy . The Lord , the king of Israel , is in your midst ; you will no longer fear evil .
CEB	Zephaniah	3	16	On that day , it will be said to Jerusalem : Don ’ t fear , Zion . Don ’ t let your hands fall .
CEB	Zephaniah	3	17	The Lord your God is in your midst—a warrior bringing victory . He will create calm with his love ; he will rejoice over you with singing .
CEB	Zephaniah	3	18	I will remove from you those worried about the appointed feasts . [ d ] They have been a burden for her , a reproach .
CEB	Zephaniah	3	19	Watch what I am about to do to all your oppressors at that time . I will deliver the lame ; I will gather the outcast . I will change their shame into praise and fame throughout the earth .
CEB	Zephaniah	3	20	At that time , I will bring all of you back , at the time when I gather you . I will give you fame and praise among all the neighboring peoples when I restore your possessions and you can see them [ e ] —says the Lord .

CEB	Haggai	1	1	The Lord ’ s word came through Haggai the prophet in the second year of King Darius , in the sixth month on the first day of the month , to Judah ’ s governor Zerubbabel , Shealtiel ’ s son , and to the high priest Joshua , Jehozadak ’ s son :
CEB	Haggai	1	2	This is what the Lord of heavenly forces says : These people say , “ The time hasn ’ t come , the time to rebuild the Lord ’ s house. ”
CEB	Haggai	1	3	Then the Lord ’ s word came through Haggai the prophet :
CEB	Haggai	1	4	Is it time for you to dwell in your own paneled houses while this house lies in ruins ?
CEB	Haggai	1	5	So now , this is what the Lord of heavenly forces says : Take your ways to heart .
CEB	Haggai	1	6	You have sown much , but it has brought little . You eat , but there ’ s not enough to satisfy . You drink , but not enough to get drunk . There is clothing , but not enough to keep warm . Anyone earning wages puts those wages into a bag with holes .
CEB	Haggai	1	7	This is what the Lord of heavenly forces says : Take your ways to heart .
CEB	Haggai	1	8	Go up to the highlands and bring back wood . Rebuild the temple so that I may enjoy it and that I may be honored , says the Lord .
CEB	Haggai	1	9	You expect a surplus , but look how it shrinks . You bring it home , and I blow it away , says the Lord of heavenly forces , because my house lies in ruins . But all of you hurry to your own houses .
CEB	Haggai	1	10	Therefore , the skies above you have withheld the dew , and the earth has withheld its produce because of you .
CEB	Haggai	1	11	I have called for drought on the earth , on the mountains , on the grain , on the wine , on the olive oil , on that which comes forth from the fertile ground , on humanity , on beasts , and upon everything that handles produce .
CEB	Haggai	1	12	Zerubbabel , Shealtiel ’ s son , and the high priest Joshua , Jehozadak ’ s son , along with all who remained among the people , listened to the voice of the Lord God and to the words of Haggai the prophet because the Lord their God sent him . Then the people feared the Lord .
CEB	Haggai	1	13	Then Haggai , the Lord ’ s messenger , gave the Lord ’ s message to the people : I am with you , says the Lord .
CEB	Haggai	1	14	The Lord moved the spirit of Judah ’ s governor Zerubbabel , Shealtiel ’ s son , and the spirit of the high priest Joshua , Jehozadak ’ s son , and the spirit of all the rest of the people . Then they came and did work on the house of the Lord of heavenly forces , their God ,
CEB	Haggai	1	15	on the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month in the second year of Darius the king .
CEB	Haggai	2	2	Say to Judah ’ s governor Zerubbabel , Shealtiel ’ s son , and to the chief priest Joshua , Jehozadak ’ s son , and to the rest of the people :
CEB	Haggai	2	3	Who among you is left who saw this house in its former glory ? How does it look to you now ? Doesn ’ t it appear as nothing to you ?
CEB	Haggai	2	4	So now , be strong , Zerubbabel , says the Lord . Be strong , High Priest Joshua , Jehozadak ’ s son , and be strong , all you people of the land , says the Lord . Work , for I am with you , says the Lord of heavenly forces .
CEB	Haggai	2	5	As with our agreement when you came out of Egypt , my spirit stands in your midst . Don ’ t fear .
CEB	Haggai	2	6	This is what the Lord of heavenly forces says : In just a little while , I will make the heavens , the earth , the sea , and the dry land quake .
CEB	Haggai	2	7	I will make all the nations quake . The wealth of all the nations will come . I will fill this house with glory , says the Lord of heavenly forces .
CEB	Haggai	2	8	The silver and the gold belong to me , says the Lord of heavenly forces .
CEB	Haggai	2	9	This house will be more glorious than its predecessor , says the Lord of heavenly forces . I will provide prosperity in this place , says the Lord of heavenly forces . Cleansing the work
CEB	Haggai	2	10	On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month in the second year of Darius , the Lord ’ s word came to Haggai the prophet :
CEB	Haggai	2	11	This is what the Lord of heavenly forces says : Go ahead and ask the priests for a ruling :
CEB	Haggai	2	12	“ If someone lifts holy meat into the hem of one ’ s garment and that hem touches bread , stew , wine , oil , or any kind of food , will it be made holy ? ” And the priests responded , “ No. ”
CEB	Haggai	2	13	Haggai said , “ If an unclean person touches any of these things , will it become unclean ? ” And the priests responded , “ It will be unclean. ”
CEB	Haggai	2	14	Then Haggai responded : Thus has this people and this nation become to me , says the Lord , and everything that they do with their hands . Whatever they offer is unclean .
CEB	Haggai	2	15	So now , take it to heart from this day forward . Before stone was placed on stone in the Lord ’ s temple ,
CEB	Haggai	2	16	when one came to the granary for twenty measures , there were only ten ; and when one came to the wine vat for fifty measures , there were only twenty .
CEB	Haggai	2	17	I struck you—everything you do with your hands— with blight and mildew and hail ; but you didn ’ t return to me . [ a ]
CEB	Haggai	2	18	So take it to heart from this day forward , from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month . Take it to heart from the day when the foundation for the Lord ’ s temple was laid .
CEB	Haggai	2	19	Is the seed yet in the granary— or the vine , the fig tree , or the pomegranate— or has the olive tree not borne fruit ? From this day forward , I will bless you . Royal expectations
CEB	Haggai	2	20	And the Lord ’ s word came to Haggai a second time on the twenty-fourth of the month , saying :
CEB	Haggai	2	21	Speak to Judah ’ s governor Zerubbabel : I am about to make the heavens and the earth quake .
CEB	Haggai	2	22	I will overthrow the thrones of the kingdoms ; I will destroy the strength of the nations . [ b ] I will overthrow chariot and rider ; horses and riders will fall . Each one will fall by the sword of his companion .
CEB	Haggai	2	23	On that day , says the Lord of heavenly forces : I will take you , Zerubbabel , Shealtiel ’ s son , my servant , says the Lord ; I will make you like a signet ring because I have chosen you , says the Lord of heavenly forces .

CEB	Zechariah	1	1	In the eighth month in the second year of Darius , the Lord ’ s word came to Zechariah the prophet , Berechiah ’ s son and Iddo ’ s grandson :
CEB	Zechariah	1	2	The Lord was terribly angry with your ancestors .
CEB	Zechariah	1	3	But you must say to the people , The Lord of heavenly forces proclaims : Return to me , says the Lord of heavenly forces , and I will return to you , says the Lord of heavenly forces .
CEB	Zechariah	1	4	Don ’ t be like your ancestors to whom the former prophets preached : The Lord of heavenly forces proclaims : Turn from your evil ways and your evil deeds . But they didn ’ t listen ; they didn ’ t draw near to me .
CEB	Zechariah	1	5	So where are your ancestors ? Do the prophets live forever ?
CEB	Zechariah	1	6	In fact , didn ’ t my words and laws , which I gave to my servants , the prophets , pursue your ancestors ? And then the people changed their hearts , and they said , The Lord of heavenly forces has treated us according to what we have done , [ a ] exactly as he planned . First night vision
CEB	Zechariah	1	7	On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month ( the month of Shebat [ b ] ) in the second year of Darius , the Lord ’ s word came to Zechariah the prophet , Berechiah ’ s son and Iddo ’ s grandson :
CEB	Zechariah	1	8	Tonight I looked and saw a man riding on a red horse , which was standing among the myrtle trees in the valley ; and behind him were red , sorrel , and white horses .
CEB	Zechariah	1	9	I said , “ What are these , sir ? ” The messenger speaking with me said , “ I will show you what they are. ”
CEB	Zechariah	1	10	The man standing among the myrtles responded , “ These are the ones the Lord sent to patrol the earth. ”
CEB	Zechariah	1	11	Then they responded to the Lord ’ s messenger , who was standing among the myrtles , “ We have patrolled the earth . The whole earth is peaceful and quiet. ”
CEB	Zechariah	1	12	Then the Lord ’ s messenger , who was speaking with me , said : “ Lord of heavenly forces , how long will you withhold compassion from Jerusalem and the cities of Judah , with whom you have been angry these seventy years ? ”
CEB	Zechariah	1	13	The Lord responded to the messenger who was speaking with me with kind and compassionate words .
CEB	Zechariah	1	14	The messenger speaking with me called out , “ This is what the Lord of heavenly forces says : I care passionately about Jerusalem and Zion .
CEB	Zechariah	1	15	And I am exceedingly angry with those carefree nations . Though I was somewhat angry , they added to the violence. ”
CEB	Zechariah	1	16	Therefore , this is what the Lord says : I have returned to Jerusalem with compassion . My house will be built in it , says the Lord of heavenly forces . Let a measuring line be stretched over Jerusalem .
CEB	Zechariah	1	17	“ Call out again , The Lord of heavenly forces proclaims : My cities will again overflow with prosperity . The Lord will again show compassion to Zion and will again choose Jerusalem. ” Second night vision
CEB	Zechariah	1	18	[ c ] Then I looked up and saw four horns .
CEB	Zechariah	1	19	I said to the messenger speaking with me , “ What are these ? ” He said to me , “ These are the horns that scattered Judah , Israel , and Jerusalem. ”
CEB	Zechariah	1	20	Then the Lord showed me four metalworkers .
CEB	Zechariah	1	21	I said , “ What are they coming to do ? ” And he said , “ These are the horns that scattered Judah so that no one could raise his head . The metalworkers have come to terrify them and to destroy the horns of the nations , those who were attacking the land of Judah with [ d ] their horns to scatter it. ” Footnotes - Zechariah 1:6 Or our ways and our actions - Zechariah 1:7 January–February - Zechariah 1:18 2:1 in Heb - Zechariah 1:21 Or those lifting their horns toward Judah
CEB	Zechariah	2	2	I said , “ Where are you going ? ” He said to me , “ To measure Jerusalem to see how wide and long it will be. ”
CEB	Zechariah	2	3	As I watched , the messenger speaking with me went ahead and another messenger came to meet him .
CEB	Zechariah	2	4	He said to him , “ Run ! Say to this young man : Jerusalem will be inhabited like open fields because of the throngs of people and cattle inside it .
CEB	Zechariah	2	5	But I will be a wall of fire around it , says the Lord , and I will be glorious inside it .
CEB	Zechariah	2	6	Look out ; look out ! Flee from the land of the north , says the Lord , for I will scatter you like the four winds of heaven , says the Lord .
CEB	Zechariah	2	7	Look out , Zion . Flee , you who dwell with Daughter Babylon !
CEB	Zechariah	2	8	The Lord of heavenly forces proclaims ( after his glory sent me ) [ b ] concerning the nations plundering you : Those who strike you strike the pupil of my eye .
CEB	Zechariah	2	9	But look , I am about to raise my hand against them ; they will become prey to their own slaves , so you will know that the Lord of heavenly forces sent me .
CEB	Zechariah	2	10	Rejoice and be glad , Daughter Zion , because I am about to come and dwell among you , says the Lord .
CEB	Zechariah	2	11	Many nations will be joined to the Lord on that day . They will become my people , and I will dwell among you so you will know that the Lord of heavenly forces sent me to you. ”
CEB	Zechariah	2	12	The Lord will possess Judah as his inheritance upon the holy land ; he will again choose Jerusalem .
CEB	Zechariah	2	13	Be silent , everyone , in the Lord ’ s presence , because he has moved from his holy habitation ! Footnotes - Zechariah 2:1 2:5 in Heb - Zechariah 2:8 Heb uncertain
CEB	Zechariah	3	3	Joshua was wearing filthy clothes and standing before the messenger .
CEB	Zechariah	3	2	And the Lord said to the Adversary : “ The Lord rebukes you , Adversary . The Lord , the one choosing Jerusalem , rebukes you . Is this one not a log snatched from the fire ? ”
CEB	Zechariah	3	4	He responded to those standing before him , “ Take off his filthy clothes. ” And he said to Joshua , “ Look , I have removed your guilt from you . Put on priestly robes. ”
CEB	Zechariah	3	5	He [ b ] said , “ Put a clean turban upon his head. ” So they put the clean turban upon his head , and they dressed him in garments while the Lord ’ s messenger stood by .
CEB	Zechariah	3	6	Then the Lord ’ s messenger admonished Joshua :
CEB	Zechariah	3	7	“ The Lord of heavenly forces proclaims : If you will walk in my paths , if you will keep my charge , then you will lead my house and guard my courts , and I will allow you to walk among those standing here .
CEB	Zechariah	3	8	Now listen , High Priest Joshua , you and your companions sitting before you— for these men are a sign— look , I am about to bring my servant , Branch .
CEB	Zechariah	3	9	See this stone that I have put before Joshua . Upon one stone , there are seven facets . I am about to engrave an inscription on it , says the Lord of heavenly forces . I will remove the guilt of that land in one day .
CEB	Zechariah	3	10	On that day , says the Lord of heavenly forces , everyone will invite their neighbors to sit beneath their vines and the fig trees. ” Footnotes - Zechariah 3:1 Heb hassatan ; cf Job 1:6 - Zechariah 3:5 Or I
CEB	Zechariah	4	4	I responded to the messenger speaking with me , “ What are these , sir ? ”
CEB	Zechariah	4	2	Then he said to me , “ What do you see ? ” I said , “ I see a lampstand made entirely of gold . It has a bowl on top . The bowl has seven lamps on top and seven metal pipes for those lamps .
CEB	Zechariah	4	3	It has two olive trees beside the lampstand , one to the right of its bowl and one to the left. ”
CEB	Zechariah	4	5	The messenger responded to me : “ Don ’ t you know what these are ? ” I said , “ No , sir . I don ’ t. ”
CEB	Zechariah	4	6	He answered me : “ This is the Lord ’ s word to Zerubbabel : Neither by power , nor by strength , but by my spirit , says the Lord of heavenly forces. ”
CEB	Zechariah	4	7	Who are you , great mountain ? Before Zerubbabel you will become a plain . He will present the capstone to shouts of great gratitude .
CEB	Zechariah	4	8	The Lord ’ s word came to me :
CEB	Zechariah	4	9	The hands of Zerubbabel laid the foundation of this house , and his hands will finish it so that you will know that the Lord of heavenly forces has sent me to you .
CEB	Zechariah	4	10	Those who despise a time of little things will rejoice when they see the plumb line [ a ] in Zerubbabel ’ s hand . These are the seven eyes of the Lord , surveying the entire earth .
CEB	Zechariah	4	11	I responded to him , “ What are these two olive trees on the right and left sides of the lampstand ? ”
CEB	Zechariah	4	12	Then I responded a second time , “ What are these two olive branches that empty out golden oil through the two gold pipes ? ”
CEB	Zechariah	4	13	He said to me , “ Don ’ t you know what these are ? ” I said , “ No , sir. ”
CEB	Zechariah	4	14	He said , “ These are the two anointed ones [ b ] standing beside the Lord of all the earth. ” Footnotes - Zechariah 4:10 Or stone , tin - Zechariah 4:14 Or sons of oil
CEB	Zechariah	5	5	Then the messenger speaking with me came forward and said , “ Look up and see what ’ s approaching. ”
CEB	Zechariah	5	2	And he said to me , “ What do you see ? ” I said , “ I see a flying scroll , thirty feet long and fifteen feet wide. ”
CEB	Zechariah	5	3	He said to me , “ This is the curse going out across all the land . Anyone stealing will be purged according to what ’ s on one side of the scroll , [ a ] and anyone swearing lies [ b ] will be purged according to what ’ s on the other side .
CEB	Zechariah	5	4	I sent it out , says the Lord of heavenly forces . It will come to the house of the thief and the one swearing lies in my name . It will lodge in their house and destroy the wood and stones of that house. ” Seventh night vision
CEB	Zechariah	5	6	I said , “ What ’ s this ? ” He said , “ This is the basket [ c ] that is going out . This is how it appears [ d ] throughout the entire land. ” [ e ]
CEB	Zechariah	5	7	Then a lead cover was lifted , showing a woman sitting in the middle of the basket .
CEB	Zechariah	5	8	He said , “ This is wickedness. ” He shoved her back into the basket , and he put the lead stone over its opening .
CEB	Zechariah	5	9	I looked up again and saw two women going out . There was a wind in their wings ; their wings were like the wings of a stork . They carried the basket between the earth and the sky .
CEB	Zechariah	5	10	I said to the messenger speaking with me , “ Where are they taking the basket ? ”
CEB	Zechariah	5	11	He said to me , “ To build a house for it in the land of Shinar .

CEB	Zechariah	6	2	The first chariot had red horses , and the second chariot had black horses .
CEB	Zechariah	6	3	The third chariot had white horses , and the fourth chariot had horses that were heavily spotted .
CEB	Zechariah	6	4	I responded and said to the messenger speaking with me , “ What are these , sir ? ”
CEB	Zechariah	6	5	The messenger answered and said to me , “ These are the four winds of heaven that are going out after presenting themselves to the Lord of all the earth .
CEB	Zechariah	6	7	Then the powerful ones approached , intent on going to patrol the earth . He said , “ Go ! Patrol the earth ! ” So they patrolled the earth .
CEB	Zechariah	6	8	Then he called out and said to me , “ Look , the ones going north have provided rest for my spirit in the north. ”
CEB	Zechariah	6	9	The Lord ’ s word came to me :
CEB	Zechariah	6	10	Take silver and gold [ b ] from the exiles who came from Babylon , from Heldai , from Tobijah , and from Jedaiah . As for you , go that same day to the house of Josiah son of Zephaniah .
CEB	Zechariah	6	11	Take silver and gold and make a crown . [ c ] Place it on the head of the high priest Joshua , Jehozadak ’ s son .
CEB	Zechariah	6	12	Say to him , “ The Lord of heavenly forces proclaims : Here is a man . His name is Branch , and he will branch out from his place ; he will build the Lord ’ s temple .
CEB	Zechariah	6	13	He will build the Lord ’ s temple . He will be majestic ; he will sit and rule on his throne . There will be a priest on his throne , and the two of them will share a peaceable plan .
CEB	Zechariah	6	14	The crown will be a memorial in the Lord ’ s temple for Helem , Tobijah , Jedaiah , and for Hen , Zephaniah ’ s son .

CEB	Zechariah	7	7	Weren ’ t these the words that the Lord proclaimed through the former prophets when Jerusalem was dwelling quietly along with the surrounding cities , and when the arid southern plain and the western foothills were inhabited ?
CEB	Zechariah	7	2	The people of [ b ] Bethel sent Sharezer and Regem-Melech , [ c ] along with his men , to seek the Lord ’ s favor ,
CEB	Zechariah	7	3	saying to the priests who were in the house of the Lord of heavenly forces and to the prophets : “ Should I weep in the fifth month and abstain as I have done for a number of years ? ”
CEB	Zechariah	7	4	Then the word of the Lord of heavenly forces came to me :
CEB	Zechariah	7	5	Say to all the land ’ s people and to the priests : When you fasted and lamented in the fifth month and the seventh month for these past seventy years , did you fast for me ?
CEB	Zechariah	7	6	When you ate and drank , weren ’ t you the ones eating and drinking ?
CEB	Zechariah	7	8	The Lord ’ s word came to Zechariah :
CEB	Zechariah	7	9	The Lord of heavenly forces proclaims : Make just and faithful decisions ; show kindness and compassion to each other !
CEB	Zechariah	7	10	Don ’ t oppress the widow , the orphan , the stranger , and the poor ; don ’ t plan evil against each other !
CEB	Zechariah	7	11	But they refused to pay attention . They turned a cold shoulder and stopped listening .
CEB	Zechariah	7	12	They steeled their hearts against hearing the Instruction and the words that the Lord of heavenly forces sent by his spirit through the earlier prophets . As a result , the Lord of heavenly forces became enraged .
CEB	Zechariah	7	13	So just as he called and they didn ’ t listen , when they called , I didn ’ t listen , says the Lord of heavenly forces .
CEB	Zechariah	7	14	I scattered them throughout the nations whom they didn ’ t know . The land was devastated behind them , with no one leaving or returning . They turned a delightful land into a wasteland . Footnotes - Zechariah 7:1 November–December - Zechariah 7:2 Heb lacks the people of . - Zechariah 7:2 Heb uncertain

CEB	Zechariah	8	11	But now , unlike those earlier days , I ’ ll be with the few remaining among this people , says the Lord of heavenly forces .
CEB	Zechariah	8	12	The seed is healthy : the vine will give its fruit . The land will give its produce ; the heavens will give its dew . I will give the remnant of this people all these things .
CEB	Zechariah	8	13	Just as you were a curse among the nations , house of Judah and house of Israel , so now I will deliver you ; you will be a blessing . Don ’ t fear , but be strong .
CEB	Zechariah	8	14	The Lord of heavenly forces proclaims : Just as I planned evil against you when your ancestors angered me , says the Lord of heavenly forces , and did not relent ,
CEB	Zechariah	8	15	so now I have changed course and again plan to do good to Jerusalem and the house of Judah . Don ’ t be afraid .
CEB	Zechariah	8	16	These are the things you should do : Speak the truth to each other ; make truthful , just , and peaceable decisions within your gates .

CEB	Zechariah	9	9	Rejoice greatly , Daughter Zion . Sing aloud , Daughter Jerusalem . Look , your king will come to you . He is righteous and victorious . He is humble and riding on an ass , on a colt , the offspring of a donkey .
CEB	Zechariah	9	2	Hamath also borders on it . Tyre and Sidon , indeed , each is exceedingly wise .
CEB	Zechariah	9	3	Tyre built a fortress for herself . She piled up silver like dust and gold like mud in the streets ,

CEB	Zechariah	10	11	They [ c ] will pass through the sea of distress and strike the sea with waves . [ d ] All the depths of the river will dry up . The pride of Assyria will be brought down ; the scepter of Egypt will turn away .

CEB	Zechariah	11	11	It was broken on that day . As a result , the afflicted [ b ] of the flock knew that it was the Lord ’ s word .
CEB	Zechariah	11	2	Scream , cypress , for the cedar has fallen ; those majestic ones have been devastated . Scream , oaks of Bashan , for the deep forest has fallen .
CEB	Zechariah	11	3	The sound of screaming appears among the shepherds because their majesty has been devastated . The sound of roaring can be heard among the young lions because the pride of the Jordan has been devastated . The shepherd ’ s two staffs
CEB	Zechariah	11	4	This is what the Lord my God says : Shepherd the flock intended for slaughter .
CEB	Zechariah	11	5	Those who buy them will kill them , but they will go unpunished . Those who sell them will say , “ Blessed is the Lord , for I have become rich. ” And their own shepherds won ’ t spare them .
CEB	Zechariah	11	6	In fact , I will no longer spare the inhabitants of the land , says the Lord . But look what I am about to bring upon humanity , upon each of them by their neighbor ’ s hand and by the hand of their king : They will beat the land to pieces , but I won ’ t rescue anyone from their hand .
CEB	Zechariah	11	7	So I shepherded the flock intended for slaughter , the afflicted of the flock . [ a ] I took two staffs for myself . I named one Delight ; the other I named Harmony . I shepherded the flock .
CEB	Zechariah	11	8	I removed three shepherds in one month when I grew impatient with them . Moreover , they detested me .
CEB	Zechariah	11	9	Then I said , “ I won ’ t shepherd you . Let the dying die , and let what is to be removed be removed . Let those who are left devour the flesh of their neighbor. ”
CEB	Zechariah	11	10	Then I took the staff Delight , and I chopped it up in order to break my covenant that I had made with all the peoples .
CEB	Zechariah	11	12	And I said to them , “ If it appears good to you , give me my wages ; but if not , then stop. ” So they weighed out my wages , thirty shekels of silver .
CEB	Zechariah	11	13	The Lord said to me , “ Put it in the treasury . [ c ] They value me at too magnificent a price. ” So I took the thirty shekels [ d ] of silver and put them in the treasury of the Lord ’ s house .
CEB	Zechariah	11	14	Then I chopped up my second staff Harmony , to break the alliance between Judah and Israel .
CEB	Zechariah	11	15	Then the Lord said to me , “ Take for yourself again the equipment of a foolish shepherd ,
CEB	Zechariah	11	16	because I am about to appoint a shepherd in the land . He won ’ t tend to those who have been removed . He won ’ t seek the young or heal the broken . He won ’ t sustain the one standing . Instead , he will devour the flesh of the fat ones , even tearing off their hooves .

CEB	Zechariah	12	2	I am about to make Jerusalem a cup that will stagger all the surrounding nations . There will be a siege against Judah and against Jerusalem .
CEB	Zechariah	12	3	On that day I will make Jerusalem into a heavy stone [ a ] for all the peoples . All who carry it will hurt themselves ; nevertheless , the nations of the earth will conspire against it .
CEB	Zechariah	12	4	On that day , says the Lord , I will strike every horse with confusion and its rider with madness . I will keep my eyes open for the house of Judah ; I will strike blind every horse of the peoples .
CEB	Zechariah	12	5	The chieftains of Judah will say to themselves , We are strong ; the inhabitants of Jerusalem will say , The Lord their God of heavenly forces is strong . [ b ]

CEB	Zechariah	12	7	The Lord will first deliver the tents of Judah so that the splendor of David ’ s house and the splendor of Jerusalem ’ s inhabitants won ’ t overshadow Judah .
CEB	Zechariah	12	8	On that day the Lord will protect the inhabitants of Jerusalem . Anyone among them who stumbles on that day will become like David , and David ’ s house will become like God , like the Lord ’ s messenger in front of them .
CEB	Zechariah	12	9	On that day I intend to destroy all the nations who come against Jerusalem ,
CEB	Zechariah	12	10	but I will pour out a spirit of grace and mercy on David ’ s house and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem . They will look to me concerning the one whom they pierced ; they will mourn over him like the mourning for an only child . They will mourn bitterly over him like the bitter mourning over the death of [ c ] an oldest child .
CEB	Zechariah	12	11	On that day , the mourning in Jerusalem will be as great as the mourning of Hadad-Rimmon in the Megiddo Valley .

CEB	Zechariah	13	13	On that day , a fountain will open to cleanse [ a ] the sin and impurity of David ’ s house and the inhabitants of Jerusalem .
CEB	Zechariah	13	2	On that day , says the Lord of heavenly forces , I will eliminate the names of the idols from the land ; they will no longer be remembered . Moreover , I will remove the prophets and the sinful spirit from the land .
CEB	Zechariah	13	3	If anyone again prophesies , then that person ’ s birth father and mother will say , “ You won ’ t live , for you have told a lie in the name of the Lord. ” That person ’ s own birth father and mother will stab him when he prophesies .
CEB	Zechariah	13	4	On that day each of the prophets will be ashamed of his vision when he prophesies and won ’ t put on a shaggy coat in order to deceive .
CEB	Zechariah	13	5	Each will say , “ I ’ m not a prophet . I ’ m a man who works the ground , for the soil has been my occupation since I was young. ”
CEB	Zechariah	13	6	Someone will say to him , “ What are these wounds between your hands ? ” And he will say , “ These happened when I was hit in my friends ’ home. ”

CEB	Zechariah	14	3	The Lord will go out and fight against those nations as when he fights on a day of battle .
CEB	Zechariah	14	4	On that day he will stand upon the Mount of Olives , to the east of Jerusalem . The Mount of Olives will be split in half by a very large valley running from east to west . Half of the mountain will move north , and the other half will move south .
CEB	Zechariah	14	5	You will flee through the valley of my mountain , because the valley of the mountains will reach to Azal . You will flee just as you fled from the earthquake in the days of Judah ’ s King Uzziah . The Lord my God will come , and all the holy ones with him . [ a ]

CEB	Zechariah	14	11	People will dwell in it ; it will never again be destroyed . Jerusalem will dwell securely .
CEB	Zechariah	14	12	This will be the plague with which the Lord will strike all the peoples who swarmed against Jerusalem : their flesh will rot , even while standing on their feet ; their eyes will rot in their sockets ; and their tongues will rot in their mouths .

CEB	Malachi	1	6	A son honors a father , and a servant honors his master . But if I ’ m a father , where is my honor ? Or if I ’ m a master , where is my respect ? says the Lord of heavenly forces to you priests who despise my name . So you say , “ How have we despised your name ? ”

CEB	Malachi	1	8	If you bring a blind animal to sacrifice , isn ’ t that evil ? If you bring a lame or sick one , isn ’ t that evil ? Would you bring it to your governor ? Would he be pleased with it or accept you ? says the Lord of heavenly forces .

CEB	Malachi	1	10	Who among you will shut the doors of the temple [ c ] so that you don ’ t burn something on my altar in vain ? I take no delight in you , says the Lord of heavenly forces . I won ’ t accept a grain offering from your hand .

CEB	Malachi	1	12	But you make my name impure when you say , “ The table of the Lord is polluted . Its fruit , its food , is despised. ”
CEB	Malachi	1	13	But you say , “ How tedious ! ” and you groan about it , says the Lord of heavenly forces . You permit what is stolen , lame , or sick to be brought for a sacrifice , [ d ] and you bring the grain offering . Should I accept such from your hands ? says the Lord .
CEB	Malachi	1	14	I will curse the cheater who has a healthy [ e ] male in his flock , but who promises and sacrifices to the Lord that which is corrupt .

CEB	Malachi	2	3	I am about to denounce your offspring ; I will scatter feces on your faces , the feces of your festivals . Then I will lift you up to me , [ a ]
CEB	Malachi	2	4	and you will know that I have sent this command to you so that my covenant with Levi can continue to exist , says the Lord of heavenly forces .
CEB	Malachi	2	5	My covenant with him involved life and peace , which I gave him , and also fear so that he honored me . He was in awe of my name .
CEB	Malachi	2	6	True Instruction was in his mouth ; injustice wasn ’ t found on his lips . He walked with me in peace and did the right thing ; he made many turn from iniquity .
CEB	Malachi	2	7	The lips of the priest should guard knowledge ; everyone [ b ] should seek Instruction from his mouth , for he is the messenger from the Lord of heavenly forces .
CEB	Malachi	2	8	But you have turned from the path . You have caused many to stumble by your instruction . You have corrupted the covenant of Levi , says the Lord of heavenly forces .

CEB	Malachi	2	11	Judah cheated— a detestable thing was done in Israel and Jerusalem . Judah made the Lord ’ s holy place impure , which God loved , and married the daughter of a foreign god .
CEB	Malachi	2	12	May the Lord eliminate anyone who does so from the tents of Jacob , anyone awaking , testifying , [ c ] and making an offering to the Lord of heavenly forces .
CEB	Malachi	2	13	You should do this as well : cover the altar of the Lord with tears , weeping , and groaning because there is still no divine favor for your offering or favorable regard for anything from your hand .
CEB	Malachi	2	14	But you say , “ Why ? ” Because the Lord testifies about you and the wife of your youth against whom you cheated . She is your partner , the wife of your covenant .
CEB	Malachi	2	15	Didn ’ t he make her [ d ] the one [ e ] and the remnant of his spirit ? [ f ] What is the one ? The one seeking godly offspring . You should guard your own spirit . Don ’ t cheat on the wife of your youth
CEB	Malachi	2	16	because he hates divorce , says the Lord God of Israel , and he also hates the one covering his garment with violence , [ g ] says the Lord of heavenly forces . Guard your own life , and don ’ t cheat . Purifying judgment

CEB	Malachi	3	6	I am the Lord , and I do not change ; and you , children of Jacob , have not perished . Return to the Lord
CEB	Malachi	3	7	Ever since the time of your ancestors , you have deviated from my laws and have not kept them . Return to me and I will return to you , says the Lord of heavenly forces . But you say , “ How should we return ? ”
CEB	Malachi	3	8	Should a person deceive God ? Yet you deceive me . But you say , “ How have we deceived you ? ” With your tenth-part gifts and offerings .
CEB	Malachi	3	9	You are being cursed with a curse , and you , the entire nation , are robbing me .
CEB	Malachi	3	10	Bring the whole tenth-part to the storage house so there might be food in my house . Please test me in this , says the Lord of heavenly forces . See whether I do not open all the windows of the heavens for you and empty out a blessing until there is enough . [ a ]
CEB	Malachi	3	11	I will threaten the one who wants to devour you so that it doesn ’ t spoil the fruit of your fertile land , and so that the vine doesn ’ t abort its fruit in your field , says the Lord of heavenly forces .
CEB	Malachi	3	12	All the nations will consider you fortunate , for you will be a desirable land , says the Lord of heavenly forces .
CEB	Malachi	3	13	You have spoken harshly about me , says the Lord ; but you say , “ What have we spoken about you ? ”
