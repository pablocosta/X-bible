DRA	Genesis	2	4	These are the generations of the heaven and the earth , when they were created , in the day that the Lord God made the heaven and the earth :
DRA	Genesis	2	5	And every plant of the field before it sprung up in the earth , and every herb of the ground before it grew : for the Lord God had not rained upon the earth ; and there was not a man to till the earth .

DRA	Genesis	2	10	And a river went out of the place of pleasure to water paradise , which from thence is divided into four heads .
DRA	Genesis	2	11	The name of the one is Phison : that is it which compasseth all the land of Hevilath , where gold groweth .

DRA	Genesis	3	1899	American Edition
DRA	Genesis	3	2	And the woman answered him , saying : Of the fruit of the trees that are in paradise we do eat :
DRA	Genesis	3	4	And the serpent said to the woman : No , you shall not die the death .
DRA	Genesis	3	5	For God doth know that in what day soever you shall eat thereof , your eyes shall be opened : and you shall be as Gods , knowing good and evil .
DRA	Genesis	3	6	And the woman saw that the tree was good to eat , and fair to the eyes , and delightful to behold : and she took of the fruit thereof , and did eat , and gave to her husband who did eat .
DRA	Genesis	3	7	And the eyes of them both were opened : and when they perceived themselves to be naked , they sewed together fig leaves , and made themselves aprons .

DRA	Genesis	3	9	And the Lord God called Adam , and said to him : Where art thou ?
DRA	Genesis	3	10	And he said : I heard thy voice in paradise ; and I was afraid , because I was naked , and I hid myself .

DRA	Genesis	3	12	And Adam said : The woman , whom thou gavest me to be my companion , gave me of the tree , and I did eat .
DRA	Genesis	3	13	And the Lord God said to the woman : Why hast thou done this ? And she answered : The serpent deceived me , and I did eat .
DRA	Genesis	3	14	And the Lord God said to the serpent : Because thou hast done this thing , thou art cursed among all cattle , and beasts of the earth : upon thy breast shalt thou go , and earth shalt thou eat all the days of thy life .
DRA	Genesis	3	15	I will put enmities between thee and the woman , and thy seed and her seed : she shall crush thy head , and thou shalt lie in wait for her heel .

DRA	Genesis	3	17	And to Adam he said : Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife , and hast eaten of the tree , whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldst not eat , cursed is the earth in thy work ; with labour and toil shalt thou eat thereof all the days of thy life .
DRA	Genesis	3	18	Thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee ; and thou shalt eat the herbs of the earth .
DRA	Genesis	3	19	In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return to the earth , out of which thou wast taken : for dust thou art , and into dust thou shalt return .

DRA	Genesis	3	21	And the Lord God made for Adam and his wife , garments of skins , and clothed them .
DRA	Genesis	3	22	And he said : Behold Adam is become as one of us , knowing good and evil : now , therefore , lest perhaps he put forth his hand , and take also of the tree of life , and eat , and live for ever .
DRA	Genesis	3	23	And the Lord God sent him out of the paradise of pleasure , to till the earth from which he was taken .
DRA	Genesis	3	24	And he cast out Adam ; and placed before the paradise of pleasure Cherubims , and a flaming sword , turning every way , to keep the way of the tree of life . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )

DRA	Genesis	18	18	Seeing he shall become a great and mighty nation , and in him all the nations of the earth shall be blessed ?
DRA	Genesis	18	1899	American Edition
DRA	Genesis	18	2	And when he had lifted up his eyes , there appeared to him three men standing near him : and as soon as he saw them he ran to meet them from the door of his tent , and adored down to the ground .
DRA	Genesis	18	3	And he said : Lord , if I have found favour in thy sight , pass not away from thy servant :
DRA	Genesis	18	4	But I will fetch a little water , and wash ye your feet , and rest ye under the tree .
DRA	Genesis	18	5	And I will set a morsel of bread , and strengthen ye your heart , afterwards you shall pass on : for therefore are you come aside to your servant . And they said : Do as thou hast spoken .
DRA	Genesis	18	6	Abraham made haste into the tent to Sara , and said to her : Make haste , temper together three measures of flour , and make cakes upon the hearth .
DRA	Genesis	18	7	And he himself ran to the herd , and took from thence a calf very tender and very good , and gave it to a young man : who made haste and boiled it .
DRA	Genesis	18	8	He took also butter and milk , and the calf which he had boiled , and set before them : but he stood by them under the tree .
DRA	Genesis	18	9	And when they had eaten , they said to him : Where is Sara thy wife ? He answered : Lo , she is in the tent .
DRA	Genesis	18	10	And he said to him : I will return and come to thee at this time , life accompanying and Sara thy wife shall have a son . Which when Sara heard , she laughed behind the door of the tent .
DRA	Genesis	18	11	Now they were both old , and far advanced in years , and it had ceased to be with Sara after the manner of women .
DRA	Genesis	18	12	And she laughed secretly , saying : After I am grown old and my lord is an old man , shall I give myself to pleasure ?
DRA	Genesis	18	13	And the Lord said to Abraham : Why did Sara laugh , saying : Shall I who am an old woman bear a child indeed ?
DRA	Genesis	18	14	Is there any thing hard to God ? According to appointment I will return to thee at this same time , life accompanying , and Sara shall have a son .
DRA	Genesis	18	15	Sara denied , saying : I did not laugh : for she was afraid . But the Lord said , Nay : but thou didst laugh :
DRA	Genesis	18	16	And when the men rose up from thence , they turned their eyes towards Sodom : and Abraham walked with them , bringing them on the way .
DRA	Genesis	18	17	And the Lord said : Can I hide from Abraham what I am about to do :
DRA	Genesis	18	19	For I know that he will command his children , and his household after him to keep the way of the Lord , and do judgment and justice : that for Abraham 's sake the Lord may bring to effect all the things he hath spoken unto him .
DRA	Genesis	18	20	And the Lord said : The cry of Sodom and Gomorrha is multiplied , and their sin is become exceedingly grievous .
DRA	Genesis	18	21	I will go down and see whether they have done according to the cry that is come to me : or whether it be not so , that I may know .
DRA	Genesis	18	22	And they turned themselves from thence , and went their way to Sodom : but Abraham as yet stood before the Lord .
DRA	Genesis	18	23	And drawing nigh he said : Wilt thou destroy the just with the wicked ?
DRA	Genesis	18	24	If there be fifty just men in the city , shall they perish withal ? and wilt thou not spare that place for the sake of the fifty just , if they be therein ?
DRA	Genesis	18	25	Far be it from thee to do this thing , and to slay the just with the wicked , and for the just to be in like case as the wicked , this is not beseeming thee : thou who judgest all the earth , wilt not make this judgment .
DRA	Genesis	18	26	And the Lord said to him : If I find in Sodom fifty just within the city , I will spare the whole place for their sake .
DRA	Genesis	18	27	And Abraham answered , and said : Seeing I have once begun , I will speak to my Lord , whereas I am dust and ashes .
DRA	Genesis	18	28	What if there be five less than fifty just persons ? wilt thou for five and forty destroy the whole city ? And he said : I will not destroy it , if I find five and forty .
DRA	Genesis	18	29	And again he said to him : But if forty be found there , what wilt thou do ? He said : I will not destroy it for the sake of forty .
DRA	Genesis	18	30	Lord , saith he , be not angry , I beseech thee , if I speak : What if thirty shall be found there ? He answered : I will not do it , if I find thirty there .
DRA	Genesis	18	31	Seeing , saith he , I have once begun , I will speak to my Lord . What if twenty be found there ? He said : I will not destroy it for the sake of twenty .
DRA	Genesis	18	32	I beseech thee , saith he , be not angry , Lord , if I speak yet once more : What if ten should be found there ? And he said : I will not destroy it for the sake of ten .
DRA	Genesis	18	33	And the Lord departed , after he had left speaking to Abraham : and Abraham returned to his place . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Genesis	19	19	Because thy servant hath found grace before thee , and thou hast magnified thy mercy , which thou hast shewn to me , in saving my life , and I can not escape to the mountain , lest some evil seize me , and I die :
DRA	Genesis	19	1899	American Edition
DRA	Genesis	19	2	And said : I beseech you , my lords , turn in to the house of your servant , and lodge there : wash your feet , and in the morning you shall go on your way . And they said : No , but we will abide in the street .
DRA	Genesis	19	3	He pressed them very much to turn in unto him : and when they were come into his house , he made them a feast , and baked unleavened bread and they ate :
DRA	Genesis	19	4	But before they went to bed , the men of the city beset the house both young and old , all the people together .
DRA	Genesis	19	5	And they called Lot , and said to him : Where are the men that came in to thee at night ? bring them out hither that we may know them :
DRA	Genesis	19	6	Lot went out to them , and shut the door after him , and said :
DRA	Genesis	19	7	Do not so , I beseech you , my brethren , do not commit this evil .
DRA	Genesis	19	8	I have two daughters who as yet have not known man : I will bring them out to you , and abuse you them as it shall please you , so that you do no evil to these men , because they are come in under the shadow of my roof .
DRA	Genesis	19	9	But they said : Get thee back thither . And again : Thou camest in , said they , as a , stranger , was it to be a judge ? therefore we will afflict thee more than them . And they pressed very violently upon Lot : and they were even at the point of breaking open the doors .
DRA	Genesis	19	10	And behold the men put out their hand , and drew in Lot unto them , and shut the door :
DRA	Genesis	19	11	And them that were without , they struck with blindness from the least to the greatest , so that they could not find the door .
DRA	Genesis	19	12	And they said to Lot : Hast thou here any of thine ? son in law , or sons , or daughters , all that are thine bring them out of this city :
DRA	Genesis	19	13	For we will destroy this place , because their cry is grown loud before the Lord , who hath sent us to destroy them .
DRA	Genesis	19	14	So Lot went out , and spoke to his sons in law that were to have his daughters , and said : Arise : get you out of this place , because the Lord will destroy this city . And he seemed to them to speak as it were in jest .
DRA	Genesis	19	15	And when it was morning , the angels pressed him , saying : Arise , take thy wife , and the two daughters which thou hast : lest thou also perish in the wickedness of the city .
DRA	Genesis	19	16	And as he lingered , they took his hand , and the hand of his wife , and of his two daughters , because the Lord spared him .
DRA	Genesis	19	17	And they brought him forth , and set him without the city : and there they spoke to him , saying : Save thy life : look not back , neither stay thou in all the country about : but save thyself in the mountain , lest thou be also consumed .
DRA	Genesis	19	18	And Lot said to them : I beseech thee my Lord ,
DRA	Genesis	19	20	There is this city here at hand , to which I may flee , it is a little one , and I shall be saved in it : is it not a little one , and my soul shall live ?
DRA	Genesis	19	21	And he said to him : Behold also in this , I have heard thy prayers , not to destroy the city for which thou hast spoken .
DRA	Genesis	19	22	Make haste and be saved there , because I can not do any thing till thou go in thither . Therefore the name of that city was called Segor .
DRA	Genesis	19	23	The sun was risen upon the earth , and Lot entered into Segor .
DRA	Genesis	19	24	And the Lord rained upon Sodom and Gomorrha brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven .
DRA	Genesis	19	25	And he destroyed these cities , and all the country about , all the inhabitants of the cities , and all things that spring from the earth .
DRA	Genesis	19	26	And his wife looking behind her , was turned into a statue of salt .
DRA	Genesis	19	27	And Abraham got up early in the morning and in the place where he had stood before with the Lord ,
DRA	Genesis	19	28	He looked towards Sodom and Gomorrha , and the whole land of that country : and he saw the ashes rise up from the earth as the smoke of a furnace .
DRA	Genesis	19	29	Now when God destroyed the cities of that country , remembering Abraham , he delivered Lot out of the destruction of the cities wherein he had dwelt .
DRA	Genesis	19	30	And Lot went up out of Segor , and abode in the mountain , and his two daughters with him , ( for he was afraid to stay in Segor , ) and he dwelt in a cave , he and his two daughters with him .
DRA	Genesis	19	31	And the elder said to the younger Our father is old , and there is no man left on the earth , to come in unto us after the manner of the whole earth .
DRA	Genesis	19	32	Come , let us make him drunk with wine , and let us lie with him , that we may preserve seed of our father .
DRA	Genesis	19	33	And they made their father drink wine that night : and the elder went in and lay with her father : but he perceived not neither when his daughter lay down , nor when she rose up .
DRA	Genesis	19	34	And the next day the elder said to the younger : Behold I lay last night with my father , let us make him drink wine also to night , and thou shalt lie with him , that we may save seed of our father .
DRA	Genesis	19	35	They made their father drink wine that night also , and the younger daughter went in , and lay with him : and neither then did he perceive when she lay down , nor when she rose up .
DRA	Genesis	19	36	So the two daughters of Lot were with child by their father .
DRA	Genesis	19	37	And the elder bore a son , and she called his name Moab : he is the father of the Moabites unto this day .
DRA	Genesis	19	38	The younger also bore a son , and she called his name Ammon , that is , the son of my people : he is the father of the Ammonites unto this day . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Genesis	20	20	Abraham removed from thence to the south country , and dwelt between Cades and Sur , and sojourned in Gerara .
DRA	Genesis	20	1899	American Edition
DRA	Genesis	20	2	And he said of Sara his wife : She is my sister . So Abimelech the king of Gerara sent , and took her .
DRA	Genesis	20	3	And God came to Abimelech in a dream by night , and he said to him : Lo thou shalt die for the woman thou hast taken : for she hath a husband .
DRA	Genesis	20	4	Now Abimelech had not touched her , and he said : Lord , wilt thou slay a nation , that is ignorant and just ?
DRA	Genesis	20	5	Did not he say to me : She is my sister : and she say , He is my brother ? in the simplicity of my heart , and cleanness of my hands have I done this .
DRA	Genesis	20	6	And God said to him : And I know that thou didst it with a sincere heart : and therefore I withheld thee from sinning against me , and I suffered thee not to touch her .
DRA	Genesis	20	7	Now therefore restore the man his wife , for he is a prophet : and he shall pray for thee , and thou shalt live : but if thou wilt not restore her , know that thou shalt surely die , thou and all that are thine .
DRA	Genesis	20	8	And Abimelech forthwith rising up in the night , called all his servants : and spoke all these words in their hearing , and all the men were exceedingly afraid .
DRA	Genesis	20	9	And Abimelech called also for Abraham , and said to him : What hast thou done to us ? what have we offended thee in , that thou hast brought upon me and upon my kingdom a great sin ? thou hast done to us what thou oughtest not to do .
DRA	Genesis	20	10	And again he expostulated with him , and said , What sawest thou , that thou hast done this ?
DRA	Genesis	20	11	Abraham answered : I thought with myself , saying : Perhaps there is not the fear of God in this place : and they will kill me for the sake of my wife :
DRA	Genesis	20	12	Howbeit , otherwise also she is truly my sister , the daughter of my father , and not the daughter of my mother , and I took her to wife .
DRA	Genesis	20	13	And after God brought me out of my father 's house , I said to her : Thou shalt do me this kindness : In every place , to which we shall come , thou shalt say that I am thy brother .
DRA	Genesis	20	14	And Abimelech took sheep and oxen , and servants and handmaids , and gave to Abraham : and restored to him Sara , his wife .
DRA	Genesis	20	15	And said : The land is before you , dwell wheresoever it shall please thee .
DRA	Genesis	20	16	And to Sara he said : Behold I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver : this shall serve thee for a covering of thy eyes to all that are with thee , and whithersoever thou shalt go : and remember thou wast taken .
DRA	Genesis	20	17	And when Abraham prayed , God healed Abimelech and his wife , and his handmaids , and they bore children :
DRA	Genesis	20	18	For the Lord had closed up every womb of the house of Abimelech on account of Sara , Abraham 's wife . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Genesis	21	21	And he dwelt in the wilderness of Pharan , and his mother took a wife for him out of the land of Egypt .
DRA	Genesis	21	1899	American Edition
DRA	Genesis	21	2	And she conceived and bore a son in her old age , at the time that God had foretold her .
DRA	Genesis	21	3	And Abraham called the name of his son , whom Sara bore him , Isaac .
DRA	Genesis	21	4	And he circumcised him the eighth day , as God had commanded him ,
DRA	Genesis	21	5	When he was a hundred years old : for at this age of his father was Isaac born .
DRA	Genesis	21	6	And Sara said : God hath made a laughter for me : whosoever shall hear of it will laugh with me .
DRA	Genesis	21	7	And again she said : Who would believe that Abraham should hear that Sara gave suck to a son , whom she bore to him in his old age .
DRA	Genesis	21	8	And the child grew and was weaned : and Abraham made a great feast on the day of his weaning .
DRA	Genesis	21	9	And when Sara had seen the son of Agar the Egyptian playing with Isaac her son , she said to Abraham :
DRA	Genesis	21	10	Cast out this bondwoman , and her son : for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with my son Isaac .
DRA	Genesis	21	11	Abraham took this grievously for his son .
DRA	Genesis	21	12	And God said to him : Let it not seem grievous to thee for the boy , and for thy bondwoman : in all that Sara hath said to thee , hearken to her voice : for in Isaac shall thy seed be called .
DRA	Genesis	21	13	But I will make the son also of the bondwoman a great nation , because he is thy seed .
DRA	Genesis	21	14	So Abraham rose up in the morning , and taking bread and a bottle of water , put it upon her shoulder , and delivered the boy , and sent her away . And she departed , and wandered in the wilderness of Bersabee .
DRA	Genesis	21	15	And when the water in the bottle was spent , she cast the boy under one of the trees that were there .
DRA	Genesis	21	16	And she went her way , and sat over against him a great way off as far as a bow can carry , for she said : I will not see the boy die : and sitting over against , she lifted up her voice and wept .
DRA	Genesis	21	17	And God heard the voice of the boy : and an angel of God called to Agar from heaven , saying : What art thou doing , Agar ? fear not : for God hath heard the voice of the boy , from the place wherein he is .
DRA	Genesis	21	18	Arise , take up the boy , and hold him by the hand : for I will make him a great nation .
DRA	Genesis	21	19	And God opened her eyes : and she saw a well of water , and went and filled the bottle , and gave the boy to drink .
DRA	Genesis	21	20	And God was with him : and he grew , and dwelt in the wilderness , and became a young man , an archer .
DRA	Genesis	21	22	At the same time Abimelech , and Phicol the general of his army said to Abraham : God is with thee in all that thou dost .
DRA	Genesis	21	23	Swear therefore by God , that thou wilt not hurt me , nor my posterity , nor my stock : but according to the kindness that I have done to thee , thou shalt do to me , and to the land wherein thou hast lived a stranger .
DRA	Genesis	21	24	And Abraham said : I will swear .
DRA	Genesis	21	25	And he reproved Abimelech for a well of water , which his servants had taken away by force .
DRA	Genesis	21	26	And Abimelech answered : I knew not who did this thing : and thou didst not tell me , and I heard not of it till to day .
DRA	Genesis	21	27	And Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech : and both of them made a league .
DRA	Genesis	21	28	And Abraham set apart seven ewe lambs of the flock .
DRA	Genesis	21	29	And Abimelech said to him : What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set apart ?
DRA	Genesis	21	30	But he said : Thou shalt take seven ewe lambs at my hand : that they may be a testimony for me , that I dug this well .
DRA	Genesis	21	31	Therefore that place was called Bersabee : because there both of them did swear .
DRA	Genesis	21	32	And they made a league for the well of oath .
DRA	Genesis	21	33	And Abimelech , and Phicol the general of his army arose and returned to the land of the Palestines . But Abraham planted a grove in Bersabee , and there called upon the name of the Lord God eternal .

DRA	Genesis	22	2	He said to him : Take thy only begotten son Isaac , whom thou lovest , and go into the land of vision : and there thou shalt offer him for an holocaust upon one of the mountains which I will shew thee .
DRA	Genesis	22	3	So Abraham rising up in the night , saddled his ass : and took with him two young men , and Isaac his son : and when he had cut wood for the holocaust he went his way to the place which God had commanded him .
DRA	Genesis	22	4	And on the third day , lifting up his eyes , he saw the place afar off .
DRA	Genesis	22	5	And he said to his young men : Stay you here with the ass : I and the boy will go with speed as far as yonder , and after we have worshipped , will return to you .
DRA	Genesis	22	6	And he took the wood for the holocaust , and laid it upon Isaac his son : and he himself carried in his hands fire and a sword . And as they two went on together ,
DRA	Genesis	22	7	Isaac said to his father : My father . And he answered : What wilt thou , son ? Behold , saith he , fire and wood : where is the victim for the holocaust ?
DRA	Genesis	22	8	And Abraham said : God will provide himself a victim for an holocaust , my son . So they went on together .
DRA	Genesis	22	9	And they came to the place which God had shewn him , where he built an altar , and laid the wood in order upon it : and when he had bound Isaac his son , he laid him on the altar upon the pile of wood .
DRA	Genesis	22	10	And he put forth his hand and took the sword , to sacrifice his son .
DRA	Genesis	22	11	And behold an angel of the Lord from heaven called to him , saying : Abraham , Abraham . And he answered : Here I am .
DRA	Genesis	22	12	And he said to him : Lay not thy hand upon the boy , neither do thou any thing to him : now I know that thou fearest God , and hast not spared thy only begotten son for my sake .
DRA	Genesis	22	13	Abraham lifted up his eyes , and saw behind his back a ram amongst the briers sticking fast by the horns , which he took and offered for a holocaust instead of his son .
DRA	Genesis	22	14	And he called the name of that place , The Lord seeth . Whereupon even to this day it is said : In the mountain the Lord will see .
DRA	Genesis	22	15	And the angel of the Lord called to Abraham a second time from heaven , saying :
DRA	Genesis	22	16	By my own self have I sworn , saith the Lord : because thou hast done this thing , and hast not spared thy only begotten son for my sake :
DRA	Genesis	22	17	I will bless thee , and I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven , and as the sand that is by the sea shore : thy seed shall possess the gates of their enemies .
DRA	Genesis	22	18	And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed , because thou hast obeyed my voice .
DRA	Genesis	22	19	Abraham returned to his young men , and they went to Bersabee together , and he dwelt there .
DRA	Genesis	22	20	After these things , it was told Abraham that Melcha also had borne children to Nachor his brother .

DRA	Genesis	23	2	And she died in the city of Arbee which is Hebron , in the land of Chanaan : and Abraham came to mourn and weep for her .
DRA	Genesis	23	3	And after he rose up from the funeral obsequies , he spoke to the children of Heth , saying :
DRA	Genesis	23	4	I am a stranger and sojourner among you : give me the right of a buryingplace with you , that I may bury my dead .
DRA	Genesis	23	5	The children of Heth answered , saying :
DRA	Genesis	23	6	My Lord , hear us , thou art a prince of God among us : bury thy dead in our principal sepulchres : and no man shall have power to hinder thee from burying thy dead in his sepulchre .
DRA	Genesis	23	7	Abraham rose up , and bowed down to the people of the land , to wit the children of Heth :
DRA	Genesis	23	8	And said to them : If it please your soul that I should bury my dead , hear me , and intercede for me to Ephron the son of Seor .
DRA	Genesis	23	9	That he may give me the double cave , which he hath in the end of his field : for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me before you , for a possession of a buryingplace .
DRA	Genesis	23	10	Now Ephron dwelt in the midst of the children of Heth . And Ephron made answer to Abraham in the hearing of all that went in at the gate of the city , saying :
DRA	Genesis	23	11	Let it not be so , my lord , but do thou rather hearken to what I say : The field I deliver to thee , and the cave that is therein , in the presence of the children of my people , bury thy dead .
DRA	Genesis	23	12	Abraham bowed down before the people of the land ,
DRA	Genesis	23	13	And he spoke to Ephron , in the presence of the people : I beseech thee to hear me : I will give money for the field : take it , and so I will bury my dead in it .
DRA	Genesis	23	14	And Ephron answered :
DRA	Genesis	23	15	My lord , hear me . The ground which thou desirest , is worth four hundred sicles of silver : this is the price between me and thee : but what is this ? bury thy dead .
DRA	Genesis	23	16	And when Abraham had heard this , he weighed out the money that Ephron had asked , in the hearing of the children of Heth , four hundred sicles of silver of common current money .
DRA	Genesis	23	17	And the field that before was Ephron 's , wherein was the double cave , looking towards Mambre , both it and the cave , and all the trees thereof in all its limits round about ,
DRA	Genesis	23	18	Was made sure to Abraham for a possession , in the sight of the children of Heth , and of all that went in at the gate of his city .
DRA	Genesis	23	19	And so Abraham buried Sara his wife , in a double cave of the field , that looked towards Mambre , this is Hebron in the land of Chanaan .

DRA	Genesis	24	2	And he said to the elder servant of his house , who was ruler over all he had : Put thy hand under my thigh ,
DRA	Genesis	24	3	That I may make thee swear by the Lord the God of heaven and earth , that thou take not a wife for my son , of the daughters of the Chanaanites , among whom I dwell :
DRA	Genesis	24	4	But that thou go to my own country and kindred , and take a wife from thence for my son Isaac .
DRA	Genesis	24	5	The servant answered : If the woman will not come with me into this land , must I bring thy son back again to the place , from whence thou camest out ?
DRA	Genesis	24	6	And Abraham said : Beware thou never bring my son back again thither .
DRA	Genesis	24	7	The Lord God of heaven , who took me out of my father 's house , and out of my native country , who spoke to me , and swore to me , saying : To thy seed will I give this land : he will send his angel before thee , and thou shalt take from thence a wife for my son .
DRA	Genesis	24	8	But if the woman will not follow thee , thou shalt not be bound by the oath ; only bring not my son back thither again .
DRA	Genesis	24	9	The servant therefore put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his lord , and swore to him upon this word .
DRA	Genesis	24	10	And he took ten camels of his master 's herd , and departed , carrying something of all his goods with him , and he set forward and went on to Mesopotamia to the city of Nachor .
DRA	Genesis	24	11	And when he had made the camels lie down without the town near a well of water in the evening , at the time when women are wont to come out to draw water , he said :
DRA	Genesis	24	12	O Lord the God of my master Abraham , meet me to day , I beseech thee , and shew kindness to my master Abraham .
DRA	Genesis	24	13	Behold I stand nigh the spring of water , and the daughters of the inhabitants of this city will come out to draw water .
DRA	Genesis	24	14	Now , therefore , the maid to whom I shall say : Let down thy pitcher that I may drink : and she shall answer , Drink , and I will give thy camels drink also : let it be the same whom thou hast provided for thy servant Isaac : and by this I shall understand , that thou hast shewn kindness to my master .
DRA	Genesis	24	15	He had not yet ended these words within himself , and behold Rebecca came out , the daughter of Bathuel , son of Melcha , wife to Nachor the brother of Abraham , having a pitcher on her shoulder :
DRA	Genesis	24	16	An exceeding comely maid , and a most beautiful virgin , and not known to man : and she went down to the spring , and filled her pitcher and was coming back .
DRA	Genesis	24	17	And the servant ran to meet her , and said : Give me a little water to drink of thy pitcher .
DRA	Genesis	24	18	And she answered : Drink , my lord . And quickly she let down the pitcher upon her arm , and gave him drink .
DRA	Genesis	24	19	And when he had drunk , she said : I will draw water for thy camels also , till they all drink .
DRA	Genesis	24	20	And pouring out the pitcher into the troughs , she ran back to the well to draw water : and having drawn she gave to all the camels .
DRA	Genesis	24	21	But he musing beheld her with silence , desirous to know whether the Lord had made his journey prosperous or not .
DRA	Genesis	24	22	And after that the camels had drunk , the man took out golden earrings , weighing two sicles : and as many bracelets of ten sicles weight .
DRA	Genesis	24	23	And he said to her : Whose daughter art thou ? tell me : is there any place in thy father 's house to lodge ?
DRA	Genesis	24	25	And she said moreover to him : We have good store of both straw and hay , and a large place to lodge in .
DRA	Genesis	24	26	The man bowed himself down , and adored the Lord ,
DRA	Genesis	24	27	Saying : Blessed be the Lord God of my master Abraham , who hath not taken away his mercy and truth from my master , and hath brought me the straight way into the house of my master 's brother .
DRA	Genesis	24	28	Then the maid ran , and told in her mother 's house , all that she had heard .
DRA	Genesis	24	29	And Rebecca had a brother named Laban , who went out in haste to the man , to the well .
DRA	Genesis	24	30	And when he had seen the earrings and bracelets in his sister 's hands , and had heard all that she related , saying : Thus and thus the man spoke to me : he came to the man who stood by the camels , and near to the spring of water ,
DRA	Genesis	24	31	And said to him : Come in , thou blessed of the Lord : why standest thou without ? I have prepared the house , and a place for the camels .
DRA	Genesis	24	32	And he brought him in into his lodging : and he unharnessed the camels and gave straw and hay , and water to wash his feet , and the feet of the men that were come with him .
DRA	Genesis	24	33	And bread was set before him . But he said : I will not eat , till I tell my message . He answered him : Speak .
DRA	Genesis	24	34	And he said : I am the servant of Abraham :
DRA	Genesis	24	35	And the Lord hath blessed my master wonderfully , and he is become great : and he hath given him sheep and oxen , silver and gold , menservants and womenservants , camels and asses .
DRA	Genesis	24	36	And Sara my master 's wife hath borne my master a son in her old age , and he hath given him all that he had .
DRA	Genesis	24	37	And my master made me swear , saying : Thou shalt not take a wife for my son of the Chanaanites , in whose land I dwell :
DRA	Genesis	24	38	But thou shalt go to my father 's house , and shalt take a wife of my own kindred for my son :
DRA	Genesis	24	39	But I answered my master : What if the woman will not come with me ?
DRA	Genesis	24	40	The Lord , said he , in whose sight I walk , will send his angel with thee , and will direct thy way : and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my own kindred , and of my father 's house .
DRA	Genesis	24	41	But thou shalt be clear from my curse , when thou shalt come to my kindred , if they will not give thee one .
DRA	Genesis	24	42	And I came to day to the well of water , and said : O Lord God of my master Abraham , if thou hast prospered my way , wherein I now walk ,
DRA	Genesis	24	43	Behold I stand by the well of water , and the virgin , that shall come out to draw water , who shall hear me say : Give me a little water to drink of thy pitcher :
DRA	Genesis	24	44	And shall say to me : Both drink thou , and I will also draw for thy camels : let the same be the woman , whom the Lord hath prepared for my master 's son .
DRA	Genesis	24	45	And whilst I pondered these things secretly with myself , Rebecca appeared coming with a pitcher , which she carried on her shoulder : and she went down to the well and drew water . And I said to her : Give me a little to drink .
DRA	Genesis	24	46	And she speedily let down the pitcher from her shoulder , and said to me : Both drink thou , and to thy camels I will give drink . I drank , and she watered the camels .
DRA	Genesis	24	47	And I asked her , and said : Whose daughter art thou ? And she answered : I am the daughter of Bathuel , the son of Nachor , whom Melcha bore to him . So I put earrings on her to adorn her face , and I put bracelets on her hands .
DRA	Genesis	24	48	And falling down I adored the Lord , blessing the Lord God of my master Abraham , who hath brought me the straight way to take the daughter of my master 's brother for his son .
DRA	Genesis	24	49	Wherefore if you do according to mercy and truth with my master , tell me : but if it please you otherwise , tell me that also , that I may go to the right hand , or to the left .
DRA	Genesis	24	50	And Laban and Bathuel answered : The word hath proceeded from the Lord , we can not speak any other thing to thee but his pleasure .
DRA	Genesis	24	51	Behold Rebecca is before thee , take her and go thy way , and let her be the wife of thy master 's son , as the Lord hath spoken .
DRA	Genesis	24	52	Which when Abraham 's servant heard , falling down to the ground he adored the Lord .
DRA	Genesis	24	53	And bringing forth vessels of silver and gold , and garments , he gave them to Rebecca for a present . He offered gifts also to her brothers , and to her mother .
DRA	Genesis	24	54	And a banquet was made , and they ate and drank together , and lodged there . And in the morning , the servant arose , and said : Let me depart , that I may go to my master .
DRA	Genesis	24	55	And her brother and mother answered : Let the maid stay at least ten days with us , and afterwards she shall depart .
DRA	Genesis	24	56	Stay me not , said he , because the Lord hath prospered my way : send me away , that I may go to my master .
DRA	Genesis	24	57	And they said : Let us call the maid , and ask her will .
DRA	Genesis	24	58	And they called her , and when she was come , they asked : Wilt thou go with this man ? She said : I will go .
DRA	Genesis	24	59	So they sent her away , and her nurse , and Abraham 's servant , and his company ,
DRA	Genesis	24	60	Wishing prosperity to their sister , and saying : Thou art our sister , mayst thou increase to thousands of thousands , and may thy seed possess the gates of their enemies .
DRA	Genesis	24	61	So Rebecca and her maids , being set upon camels , followed the man : who with speed returned to his master .
DRA	Genesis	24	62	At the same time Isaac was walking along the way to the well which is called Of the living and the seeing : for he dwelt in the south country .
DRA	Genesis	24	63	And he was gone forth to meditate in the field , the day being now well spent : and when he had lifted up his eyes , he saw camels coming afar off .
DRA	Genesis	24	64	Rebecca also , when she saw Isaac , lighted off the camel ,
DRA	Genesis	24	65	And said to the servant : Who is that man who cometh towards us along the field ? And he said to her : That man is my master . But she quickly took her cloak , and covered herself .
DRA	Genesis	24	66	And the servant told Isaac all that he had done .

DRA	Genesis	25	2	Who bore him Zamran , and Jecsan , and Madan , and Madian , and Jesboc , and Sue .
DRA	Genesis	25	3	Jecsan also begot Saba and Dadan . The children of Dadan were Assurim , and Latusim , and Loomin .
DRA	Genesis	25	4	But of Madian was born Epha , and Opher , and Henoch , and Abida , and Eldaa : all these were the children of Cetura .
DRA	Genesis	25	5	And Abraham gave all his possessions to Isaac .
DRA	Genesis	25	6	And to the children of the concubines he gave gifts , and separated them from Isaac his son , while he yet lived , to the east country .
DRA	Genesis	25	7	And the days of Abraham 's life were a hundred and seventy-five years .
DRA	Genesis	25	8	And decaying he died in a good old age , and having lived a long time , and being full of days : and was gathered to his people .
DRA	Genesis	25	9	And Isaac and Ismael his sons buried him in the double cave , which was situated in the field of Ephron the son of Seor the Hethite , over against Mambre ;
DRA	Genesis	25	10	Which he had bought of the children of Heth : there was he buried , and Sara his wife .
DRA	Genesis	25	11	And after his death , God blessed Isaac his son , who dwelt by the well named Of the living and seeing .
DRA	Genesis	25	12	These are the generations of Ismael the son of Abraham , whom Agar the Egyptian , Sara 's servant , bore unto him :
DRA	Genesis	25	13	And these are the names of his children according to their calling and generations . The firstborn of Ismael was Nabajoth , then Cedar , and Adbeel , and Mabsam .
DRA	Genesis	25	14	And Masma , and Duma , and Massa ,
DRA	Genesis	25	15	Hadar , and Thema , and Jethur , and Naphis , and Cedma .
DRA	Genesis	25	16	These are the sons of Ismael : and these are their names by their castles and towns , twelve princes of their tribes .
DRA	Genesis	25	17	And the years of Ismael 's life were a hundred and thirty-seven , and decaying he died , and was gathered unto his people .
DRA	Genesis	25	18	And he dwelt from Hevila as far as Sur , which looketh towards Egypt , to them that go towards the Assyrians . He died in the presence of all his brethren .
DRA	Genesis	25	19	These also are the generations of Isaac the son of Abraham : Abraham begot Isaac :
DRA	Genesis	25	20	Who when he was forty years old , took to wife Rebecca the daughter of Bathuel the Syrian of Mesopotamia , sister to Laban .
DRA	Genesis	25	21	And Isaac besought the Lord for his wife , because she was barren ; and he heard him , and made Rebecca to conceive .
DRA	Genesis	25	22	But the children struggled in her womb : and she said : If it were to be so with me , what need was there to conceive ? And she went to consult the Lord .
DRA	Genesis	25	23	And he answering said : Two nations are in thy womb , and two peoples shall be divided out of thy womb , and one people shall overcome the other , and the elder shall serve the younger .
DRA	Genesis	25	24	And when her time was come to be delivered , behold twins were found in her womb .
DRA	Genesis	25	26	Isaac was threescore years old when the children were born unto him .
DRA	Genesis	25	27	And when they were grown up , Esau became a skillful hunter , and a husbandman , but Jacob a plain man dwelt in tents .
DRA	Genesis	25	28	Isaac loved Esau , because he ate of his hunting : and Rebecca loved Jacob .
DRA	Genesis	25	29	And Jacob boiled pottage : to whom Esau , coming faint out of the field ,
DRA	Genesis	25	30	Said : Give me of this red pottage , for I am exceeding faint . For which reason his name was called Edom .
DRA	Genesis	25	31	And Jacob said to him : Sell me thy first birthright .
DRA	Genesis	25	32	He answered : Lo I die , what will the first birthright avail me ?
DRA	Genesis	25	33	Jacob said : Swear therefore to me . Esau swore to him , and sold his first birthright .
DRA	Genesis	25	34	And so taking bread and the pottage of lentils , he ate , and drank , and went his way ; making little account of having sold his first birthright . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Genesis	26	26	To which place when Abimelech , and Ochozath his friend , and Phicol chief captain of his soldiers came from Gerara ,
DRA	Genesis	26	1899	American Edition
DRA	Genesis	26	2	And the Lord appeared to him and said : Go not down into Egypt , but stay in the land that I shall tell thee .
DRA	Genesis	26	3	And sojourn in it , and I will be with thee , and will bless thee : for to thee and to thy seed I will give all these countries , to fulfill the oath which I swore to Abraham thy father .
DRA	Genesis	26	4	And I will multiply thy seed like the stars of heaven : and I will give to thy posterity all these countries : and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed .
DRA	Genesis	26	5	Because Abraham obeyed my voice , and kept my precepts and commandments , and observed my ceremonies and laws .
DRA	Genesis	26	6	So Isaac abode in Gerara .
DRA	Genesis	26	7	And when he was asked by the men of that place , concerning his wife , he answered : She is my sister ; for he was afraid to confess that she was his wife , thinking lest perhaps they would kill him because of her beauty .
DRA	Genesis	26	8	And when very many days were passed , and he abode there , Abimelech king of the Palestines looking out through a window , saw him playing with Rebecca his wife .
DRA	Genesis	26	9	And calling for him , he said : It is evident she is thy wife : why didst thou feign her to be thy sister ? He answered : I feared lest I should die for her sake .
DRA	Genesis	26	10	And Abimelech said : Why hast thou deceived us ? Some man of the people might have lain with thy wife , and thou hadst brought upon us a great sin . And he commanded all the people , saying :
DRA	Genesis	26	11	He that shall touch this man 's wife , shall surely be put to death .
DRA	Genesis	26	12	And Isaac sowed in that land , and he found that same year a hundredfold : and the Lord blessed him .
DRA	Genesis	26	13	And the man was enriched , and he went on prospering and increasing , till he became exceeding great :
DRA	Genesis	26	14	And he had possessions of sheep and of herds , and a very great family . Wherefore the Palestines envying him ,
DRA	Genesis	26	15	Stopped up at that time all the wells , that the servants of his father Abraham had digged , filling them up with earth :
DRA	Genesis	26	16	Insomuch that Abimelech himself said to Isaac : Depart from us , for thou art become much mightier than we .
DRA	Genesis	26	17	So he departed and came to the torrent of Gerara , to dwell there :
DRA	Genesis	26	18	And he digged again other wells , which the servants of his father Abraham had digged , and which , after his death , the Palestines had of old stopped up : and he called them by the same names by which his father before had called them .
DRA	Genesis	26	19	And they digged in the torrent , and found living water .
DRA	Genesis	26	20	But there also the herdsmen of Gerara strove against the herdsmen of Isaac , saying : It is our water . Wherefore he called the name of the well , on occasion of that which had happened , Calumny .
DRA	Genesis	26	21	And they digged also another ; and for that they quarrelled likewise , and he called the name of it , Enmity .
DRA	Genesis	26	22	Going forward from thence , he digged another well , for which they contended not : therefore he called the name thereof , Latitude , saying : Now hath the Lord given us room , and made us to increase upon the earth .
DRA	Genesis	26	23	And he went up from that place to Bersabee ,
DRA	Genesis	26	24	Where the Lord appeared to him that same night , saying : I am the God of Abraham thy father ; do not fear , for I am with thee : I will bless thee , and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham 's sake .
DRA	Genesis	26	25	And he built there an altar : and called upon the name of the Lord , and pitched his tent : and commanded his servants to dig a well .
DRA	Genesis	26	27	Isaac said to them : Why are ye come to me , a man whom you hate , and have thrust out from you ?
DRA	Genesis	26	28	And they answered : We saw that the Lord is with thee , and therefore we said : Let there be an oath between us , and let us make a covenant ,
DRA	Genesis	26	29	That thou do us no harm , as we on our part have touched nothing of thine , nor have done any thing to hurt thee : but with peace have sent thee away increased with the blessing of the Lord .
DRA	Genesis	26	30	And he made them a feast , and after they had eaten and drunk :
DRA	Genesis	26	31	Arising in the morning , they swore one to another : and Isaac sent them away peaceably to their own home .
DRA	Genesis	26	32	And behold the same day the servants of Isaac came , telling him of a well which they had digged , and saying : We have found water .
DRA	Genesis	26	33	Whereupon he called it Abundance : and the name of the city was called Bersabee , even to this day .
DRA	Genesis	26	34	And Esau being forty years old , married wives , Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hethite , and Basemath the daughter of Elon of the same place .
DRA	Genesis	26	35	And they both offended the mind of Isaac and Rebecca . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Genesis	27	27	He came near , and kissed him . And immediately as he smelled the fragrant smell of his garments , blessing him , he said : Behold the smell of my son is as the smell of a plentiful field , which the Lord hath blessed .
DRA	Genesis	27	1899	American Edition
DRA	Genesis	27	2	And his father said to him : Thou seest that I am old , and know not the day of my death .
DRA	Genesis	27	3	Take thy arms , thy quiver , and bow , and go abroad : and when thou hast taken some thing by hunting ,
DRA	Genesis	27	4	Make me savoury meat thereof , as thou knowest I like , and bring it , that I may eat : and my soul may bless thee before I die .
DRA	Genesis	27	5	And when Rebecca had heard this , and he was gone into the field to fulfill his father 's commandment ,
DRA	Genesis	27	6	She said to her son Jacob : I heard thy father talking with Esau thy brother , and saying to him :
DRA	Genesis	27	7	Bring me of thy hunting , and make me meats that I may eat , and bless thee in the sight of the Lord , before I die .
DRA	Genesis	27	8	Now , therefore , my son , follow my counsel :
DRA	Genesis	27	9	And go thy way to the flock , bring me two kids of the best , that I may make of them meat for thy father , such as he gladly eateth :
DRA	Genesis	27	10	Which when thou hast brought in , and he hath eaten , he may bless thee before he die .
DRA	Genesis	27	11	And he answered her : Thou knowest that Esau my brother is a hairy man , and I am smooth .
DRA	Genesis	27	12	If my father shall feel me , and perceive it , I fear lest he will think I would have mocked him , and I shall bring upon me a curse instead of a blessing .
DRA	Genesis	27	13	And his mother said to him : Upon me be this curse , my son : only hear thou my voice , and go , fetch me the things which I have said .
DRA	Genesis	27	14	He went , and brought , and gave them to his mother . She dressed meats , such as she knew his father liked .
DRA	Genesis	27	15	And she put on him very good garments of Esau , which she had at home with her :
DRA	Genesis	27	16	And the little skins of the kids she put about his hands , and covered the bare of his neck .
DRA	Genesis	27	17	And she gave him the savoury meat , and delivered him bread that she had baked .
DRA	Genesis	27	18	Which when he had carried in , he said : My father ? But he answered : I hear . Who art thou , my son ?
DRA	Genesis	27	19	And Jacob said : I am Esau thy firstborn : I have done as thou didst command me : arise , sit , and eat of my venison , that thy soul may bless me .
DRA	Genesis	27	20	And Isaac said to his son : How couldst thou find it so quickly , my son ? He answered : It was the will of God , that what I sought came quickly in my way .
DRA	Genesis	27	21	And Isaac said : Come hither , that I may feel thee , my son , and may prove whether thou be my son Esau , or not .
DRA	Genesis	27	22	He came near to his father , and when he had felt him , Isaac said : The voice indeed is the voice of Jacob ; but the hands are the hands of Esau .
DRA	Genesis	27	23	And he knew him not , because his hairy hands made him like to the elder . Then blessing him ,
DRA	Genesis	27	24	He said : Art thou my son Esau ? He answered : I am .
DRA	Genesis	27	25	Then he said : Bring me the meats of thy hunting , my son , that my soul may bless thee . And when they were brought , and he had eaten , he offered him wine also , which after he had drunk ,
DRA	Genesis	27	26	He said to him : Come near me , and give me a kiss , my son .
DRA	Genesis	27	28	God give thee the dew of heaven , and of the fatness of the earth , abundance of corn and wine .
DRA	Genesis	27	29	And let peoples serve thee , and tribes worship thee : be thou lord of thy brethren , and let thy mother 's children bow down before thee . Cursed be he that curseth thee : and let him that blesseth thee be filled with blessings .
DRA	Genesis	27	30	Isaac had scarce ended his words , when Jacob being now gone out abroad , Esau came ,
DRA	Genesis	27	31	And brought in to his father meats made of what he had taken in hunting , saying : Arise , my father , and eat of thy son 's venison ; that thy soul may bless me .
DRA	Genesis	27	32	And Isaac said to him : Why ! who art thou ? He answered : I am thy firstborn son Esau .
DRA	Genesis	27	33	Isaac was struck with fear , and astonished exceedingly : and wondering beyond what can be believed , said Who is he then that even now brought me venison that he had taken , and I ate of all before thou camest ? and I have blessed him , and he shall be blessed .
DRA	Genesis	27	34	Esau having heard his father 's words , roared out with a great cry : and being in a great consternation , said : Bless me also , my father .
DRA	Genesis	27	35	And he said : Thy brother came deceitfully and got thy blessing .
DRA	Genesis	27	36	But he said again : Rightly is his name called Jacob ; for he hath supplanted me lo this second time : my first birthright he took away before , and now this second time he hath stolen away my blessing . And again he said to his father : Hast thou not reserved me also a blessing ?
DRA	Genesis	27	37	Isaac answered : I have appointed him thy lord , and have made all his brethren his servants : I have established him with corn and wine , and after this , what shall I do more for thee , my son ?
DRA	Genesis	27	38	And Esau said to him : Hast thou only one blessing , father ? I beseech thee bless me also . And when he wept with a loud cry ,
DRA	Genesis	27	39	Isaac being moved , said to him : In the fat of the earth , and in the dew of heaven from above ,
DRA	Genesis	27	40	Shall thy blessing be . Thou shalt live by the sword and shalt serve thy brother : and the time shall come , when thou shalt shake off and loose his yoke from thy neck .
DRA	Genesis	27	41	Esau therefore always hated Jacob for the blessing wherewith his father had blessed him : and he said in his heart : The days will come of the mourning of my father , and I will kill my brother Jacob .
DRA	Genesis	27	42	These things were told to Rebecca : and she sent and called Jacob her son , and said to him : Behold Esau thy brother threateneth to kill thee .
DRA	Genesis	27	43	Now therefore , my son , hear my voice : arise and flee to Laban my brother to Haran :
DRA	Genesis	27	44	And thou shalt dwell with him a few days , till the wrath of thy brother be assuaged ,
DRA	Genesis	27	45	And his indignation cease , and he forget the things thou hast done to him : afterwards I will send , and bring thee from thence hither . Why shall I be deprived of both my sons in one day ?
DRA	Genesis	27	46	And Rebecca said to Isaac : I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth : if Jacob take a wife of the stock of this land , I choose not to live . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )

DRA	Genesis	28	2	But go , and take a journey to Mesopotamia of Syria , to the house of Bathuel thy mother 's father , and take thee a wife thence of the daughters of Laban thy uncle .
DRA	Genesis	28	3	And God almighty bless thee , and make thee to increase , and multiply thee : that thou mayst be a multitude of people .
DRA	Genesis	28	4	And give the blessings of Abraham to thee , and to thy seed after thee : that thou mayst possess the land of thy sojournment , which he promised to thy grandfather .
DRA	Genesis	28	5	And when Isaac had sent him away , he took his journey and went to Mesopotamia of Syria to Laban the son of Bathuel the Syrian , brother to Rebecca his mother .
DRA	Genesis	28	6	And Esau seeing that his father had blessed Jacob , and had sent him into Mesopotamia of Syria , to marry a wife thence ; and that after the blessing he had charged him , saying : Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Chanaan :
DRA	Genesis	28	7	And that Jacob obeying his parents was gone into Syria :
DRA	Genesis	28	8	Experiencing also that his father was not well pleased with the daughters of Chanaan :
DRA	Genesis	28	9	He went to Ismael , and took to wife , besides them he had before , Maheleth the daughter of Ismael , Abraham 's son , the sister of Nabajoth .
DRA	Genesis	28	10	But Jacob being departed from Bersabee , went on to Haran .
DRA	Genesis	28	11	And when he was come to a certain place , and would rest in it after sunset , he took of the stones that lay there , and putting under his head , slept in the same place .
DRA	Genesis	28	12	And he saw in his sleep a ladder standing upon the earth , and the top thereof touching heaven : the angels also of God ascending and descending by it ;
DRA	Genesis	28	13	And the Lord leaning upon the ladder , saying to him : I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father , and the God of Isaac ; the land , wherein thou sleepest , I will give to thee and to thy seed .
DRA	Genesis	28	14	And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth : thou shalt spread abroad to the west , and to the east , and to the north , and to the south : and IN THEE and thy seed all the tribes of the earth SHALL BE BLESSED .

DRA	Genesis	28	17	And trembling he said : How terrible is this place ! this is no other but the house of God , and the gate of heaven .
DRA	Genesis	28	18	And Jacob , arising in the morning , took the stone , which he had laid under his head , and set it up for a title , pouring oil upon the top of it .
DRA	Genesis	28	19	And he called the name of the city Bethel , which before was called Luza .

DRA	Genesis	29	2	And he saw a well in the field , and three flocks of sheep lying by it : for the beasts were watered out of it , and the mouth thereof was closed with a great stone .
DRA	Genesis	29	3	And the custom was , when all the sheep were gathered together to roll away the stone , and after the sheep were watered , to put it on the mouth of the well again .
DRA	Genesis	29	4	And he said to the shepherds : Brethren , whence are you ? They answered : Of Haran .
DRA	Genesis	29	5	And he asked them , saying : Know you Laban the son of Nachor ? They said : We know him .
DRA	Genesis	29	6	He said : Is he in health ? He is in health , say they : and behold Rachel his daughter cometh with his flock .
DRA	Genesis	29	7	And Jacob said : There is yet much day remaining , neither is it time to bring the flocks into the folds again : first give the sheep drink , and so lead them back to feed .
DRA	Genesis	29	8	They answered : We can not , till all the cattle be gathered together , and we remove the stone from the well 's mouth , that we may water the flocks .
DRA	Genesis	29	9	They were yet speaking , and behold Rachel came with her father 's sheep : for she fed the flock .
DRA	Genesis	29	10	And when Jacob saw her , and knew her to be his cousin-german , and that they were the sheep of Laban , his uncle : he removed the stone wherewith the well was closed .

DRA	Genesis	29	14	He answered : Thou art my bone and my flesh . And after the days of one month were expired ,
DRA	Genesis	29	15	He said to him : Because thou art my brother , shalt thou serve me without wages ? Tell me what wages thou wilt have .
DRA	Genesis	29	16	Now he had two daughters , the name of the elder was Lia : and the younger was called Rachel .
DRA	Genesis	29	17	But Lia was blear eyed : Rachel was well favoured , and of a beautiful countenance .
DRA	Genesis	29	18	And Jacob being in love with her , said : I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter .
DRA	Genesis	29	19	Laban answered : It is better that I give her to thee than to another man ; stay with me .
DRA	Genesis	29	20	So Jacob served seven years for Rachel : and they seemed but a few days , because of the greatness of his love .
DRA	Genesis	29	21	And he said to Laban : Give me my wife ; for now the time is fulfilled , that I may go in unto her .
DRA	Genesis	29	22	And he , having invited a great number of his friends to the feast , made the marriage .
DRA	Genesis	29	23	And at night he brought in Lia his daughter to him ,
DRA	Genesis	29	24	Giving his daughter a handmaid , named Zelpha . Now when Jacob had gone in to her according to custom when morning was come he saw it was Lia :
DRA	Genesis	29	25	And he said to his father in law : What is it that thou didst mean to do ? did not I serve thee for Rachel ? why hast thou deceived me ?
DRA	Genesis	29	26	Laban answered : It is not the custom in this place , to give the younger in marriage first .
DRA	Genesis	29	27	Make up the week of days of this match : and I will give thee her also , for the service that thou shalt render me other seven years .
DRA	Genesis	29	28	He yielded to his pleasure : and after the week was past , he married Rachel :
DRA	Genesis	29	30	And having at length obtained the marriage he wished for , he preferred the love of the latter before the former , and served with him other seven years .
DRA	Genesis	29	31	And the Lord seeing that he despised Lia , opened her womb , but her sister remained barren .
DRA	Genesis	29	32	And she conceived and bore a son , and called his name Ruben , saying : The Lord saw my affliction : now my husband will love me .
DRA	Genesis	29	33	And again she conceived and bore a son , and said : Because the Lord heard that I was despised , he hath given this also to me : and she called his name Simeon .
DRA	Genesis	29	34	And she conceived the third time , and bore another son : and said : Now also my husband will be joined to me , because I have borne him three sons : and therefore she called his name Levi .
DRA	Genesis	29	35	The fourth time she conceived and bore a son , and said : now will I praise the Lord : and for this she called him Juda . And she left bearing . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Genesis	30	30	Thou hadst but little before I came to thee , and now thou art become rich : and the Lord hath blessed thee at my coming . It is reasonable therefore that I should now provide also for my own house .
DRA	Genesis	30	1899	American Edition
DRA	Genesis	30	2	And Jacob being angry with her , answered : Am I as God , who hath deprived thee of the fruit of thy womb ?
DRA	Genesis	30	3	But she said : I have here my servant Bala : go in unto her , that she may bear upon my knees , and I may have children by her .
DRA	Genesis	30	4	And she gave him Bala in marriage : who ,
DRA	Genesis	30	5	When her husband had gone in unto her , conceived and bore a son .
DRA	Genesis	30	6	And Rachel said : The Lord hath judged for me , and hath heard my voice , giving me a son , and therefore she called his name Dan .
DRA	Genesis	30	7	And again Bala conceived and bore another ,
DRA	Genesis	30	8	For whom Rachel said : God hath compared me with my sister , and I have prevailed : and she called him Nephtali .
DRA	Genesis	30	9	Lia , perceiving that she had left off bearing , gave Zelpha her handmaid to her husband .
DRA	Genesis	30	10	And when she had conceived and brought forth a son ,
DRA	Genesis	30	11	She said : Happily . And therefore called his name Gad .
DRA	Genesis	30	12	Zelpha also bore another .
DRA	Genesis	30	13	And Lia said : This is for my happiness : for women will call me blessed . Therefore she called him Aser .
DRA	Genesis	30	14	And Ruben , going out in the time of the wheat harvest into the field , found mandrakes : which he brought to his mother Lia . And Rachel said : Give me part of thy son 's mandrakes .
DRA	Genesis	30	15	She answered : Dost thou think it a small matter , that thou hast taken my husband from me , unless thou take also my son 's mandrakes ? Rachel said : He shall sleep with thee this night , for thy son 's mandrakes .
DRA	Genesis	30	16	And when Jacob returned at even from the field , Lia went out to meet him , and said : Thou shalt come in unto me , because I have hired thee for my son 's mandrakes . And he slept with her that night .
DRA	Genesis	30	17	And God heard her prayers : and she conceived and bore the fifth son ,
DRA	Genesis	30	18	And said : God hath given me a reward , because I gave my handmaid to my husband . And she called his name Issachar .
DRA	Genesis	30	19	And Lia conceived again , and bore the sixth son ,
DRA	Genesis	30	20	And said : God hath endowed me with a good dowry : this turn also my husband will be with me , because I have borne him six sons : and therefore she called his name Zabulon .
DRA	Genesis	30	21	After whom she bore a daughter , named Dina .
DRA	Genesis	30	22	The Lord also remembering Rachel , heard her , and opened her womb .
DRA	Genesis	30	23	And she conceived , and bore a son , saying : God hath taken away my reproach .
DRA	Genesis	30	24	And she called his name Joseph , saying : The Lord give me also another son .
DRA	Genesis	30	25	And when Joseph was born , Jacob said to his father in law : Send me away that I may return into my country , and to my land .
DRA	Genesis	30	26	Give me my wives , and my children , for whom I have served thee , that I may depart : thou knowest the service that I have rendered thee .
DRA	Genesis	30	27	Laban said to him : Let me find favour in thy sight : I have learned by experience , that God hath blessed me for thy sake .
DRA	Genesis	30	28	Appoint thy wages which I shall give thee .
DRA	Genesis	30	29	But he answered : Thou knowest how I have served thee , and how great thy possession hath been in my hands .
DRA	Genesis	30	31	And Laban said : What shall I give thee ? But he said : I require nothing : but if thou wilt do what I demand , I will feed , and keep thy sheep again .
DRA	Genesis	30	32	Go round through all thy flocks , and separate all the sheep of divers colours , and speckled : and all that is brown and spotted , and of divers colours , as well among the sheep , as among the goats , shall be my wages .
DRA	Genesis	30	33	And my justice shall answer for me to morrow before thee when the time of the bargain shall come : and all that is not of divers colours , and spotted , and brown , as well among the sheep as among the goats , shall accuse me of theft .
DRA	Genesis	30	34	And Laban said : I like well what thou demandest .
DRA	Genesis	30	35	And he separated the same day the she goats , and the sheep , and the he goats , and the rams of divers colours , and spotted : and all the flock of one colour , that is , of white and black fleece , he delivered into the hands of his sons .
DRA	Genesis	30	36	And he set the space of three days ' journey betwixt himself and his son in law , who fed the rest of his flock .
DRA	Genesis	30	37	And Jacob took green rods of poplar , and of almond , and of plane trees , and pilled them in part : so when the bark was taken off , in the parts that were pilled , there appeared whiteness : but the parts that were whole remained green : and by this means the colour was divers .
DRA	Genesis	30	38	And he put them in the troughs , where the water was poured out : that when the flocks should come to drink , they might have the rods before their eyes , and in the sight of them might conceive .
DRA	Genesis	30	39	And it came to pass that in the very heat of coition , the sheep beheld the rods , and brought forth spotted , and of divers colours , and speckled .
DRA	Genesis	30	40	And Jacob separated the flock , and put the rods in the troughs before the eyes of the rams : and all the white and the black were Laban 's : and the rest were Jacob 's , when the flocks were separated one from the other .
DRA	Genesis	30	41	So when the ewes went first to ram , Jacob put the rods in the troughs of water before the eyes of the rams , and of the ewes , that they might conceive while they were looking upon them :
DRA	Genesis	30	42	But when the latter coming was , and the last conceiving , he did not put them . And those that were lateward , became Laban 's : and they of the first time , Jacob 's .
DRA	Genesis	30	43	And the man was enriched exceedingly , and he had many flocks , maid servants and men servants , camels and asses . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Genesis	31	31	Jacob answered : That I departed unknown to thee , it was for fear lest thou wouldst take away thy daughters by force .
DRA	Genesis	31	1899	American Edition
DRA	Genesis	31	2	And perceiving also that Laban 's countenance was not towards him as yesterday and the other day ,
DRA	Genesis	31	3	Especially the Lord saying to him : Return into the land of thy fathers , and to thy kindred , and I will be with thee .
DRA	Genesis	31	4	He sent , and called Rachel and Lia into the field , where he fed the flocks ,
DRA	Genesis	31	5	And said to them : I see your father 's countenance is not towards me as yesterday and the other day : but the God of my father hath been with me .
DRA	Genesis	31	6	And you know that I have served your father to the uttermost of my power .
DRA	Genesis	31	7	Yea , your father also hath overreached me , and hath changed my wages ten times : and yet God hath not suffered him to hurt me .
DRA	Genesis	31	8	If at any time he said : The speckled shall be thy wages : all the sheep brought forth speckled : but when he said on the contrary : Thou shalt take all the white ones for thy wages : all the flocks brought forth white ones .
DRA	Genesis	31	9	And God hath taken your father 's substance , and given it to me .
DRA	Genesis	31	10	For after that time came of the ewes conceiving , I lifted up my eyes , and saw in my sleep that the males which leaped upon the females were of divers colours , and spotted , and speckled .
DRA	Genesis	31	11	And the angel of God said to me in my sleep : Jacob ? And I answered : Here I am .
DRA	Genesis	31	12	And he said : Lift up thy eyes , and see that all the males leaping upon the females , are of divers colours , spotted , and speckled . For I have seen all that Laban hath done to thee .
DRA	Genesis	31	13	I am the God of Bethel , where thou didst anoint the stone , and make a vow to me . Now therefore arise , and go out of this land , and return into thy native country .
DRA	Genesis	31	14	And Rachel and Lia answered : Have we any thing left among the goods and inheritance of our father 's house ?
DRA	Genesis	31	15	Hath he not counted us as strangers and sold us , and eaten up the price of us ?
DRA	Genesis	31	16	But God hath taken our father 's riches , and delivered them to us , and to our children : wherefore do all that God hath commanded thee .
DRA	Genesis	31	17	Then Jacob rose up , and having set his children and wives upon camels , went his way .
DRA	Genesis	31	18	And he took all his substance , and flocks , and whatsoever he had gotten in Mesopotamia , and went forward to Isaac his father to the land of Chanaan .
DRA	Genesis	31	19	At that time Laban was gone to shear his sheep , and Rachel stole away her father 's idols .
DRA	Genesis	31	20	And Jacob would not confess to his father in law that he was flying away .
DRA	Genesis	31	21	And when he was gone , together with all that belonged to him , and having passed the river , was going on towards mount Galaad ,
DRA	Genesis	31	22	It was told Laban on the third day that Jacob fled .
DRA	Genesis	31	23	And he took his brethren with him , and pursued after him seven days ; and overtook him in the mount of Galaad .
DRA	Genesis	31	24	And he saw in a dream God saying to him : Take heed thou speak not any thing harshly against Jacob .
DRA	Genesis	31	25	Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain : and when he with his brethren had overtaken him , he pitched his tent in the same mount of Galaad .
DRA	Genesis	31	26	And he said to Jacob : Why hast thou done thus , to carry away , without my knowledge , my daughters , as captives taken with the sword .
DRA	Genesis	31	27	Why wouldst thou run away privately and not acquaint me , that I might have brought thee on the way with joy , and with songs , and with timbrels , and with harps ?
DRA	Genesis	31	28	Thou hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and daughters : thou hast done foolishly : and now , indeed ,
DRA	Genesis	31	29	It is in my power to return thee evil : but the God of your father said to me yesterday : Take heed thou speak not any thing harshly against Jacob .
DRA	Genesis	31	30	Suppose thou didst desire to go to thy friends , and hadst a longing after thy father 's house : why hast thou stolen away my gods ?
DRA	Genesis	31	32	But whereas thou chargest me with theft : with whomsoever thou shalt find thy gods , let him be slain before our brethren . Search , and if thou find any of thy things with me , take them away . Now when he said this , he knew not that Rachel had stolen the idols .
DRA	Genesis	31	33	So Laban went into the tent of Jacob , and of Lia , and of both the handmaids , and found them not . And when he was entered into Rachel 's tent ,
DRA	Genesis	31	34	She in haste hid the idols under the camel 's furniture , and sat upon them : and when he had searched all the tent , and found nothing ,
DRA	Genesis	31	35	She said : Let not my lord be angry that I can not rise up before thee , because it has now happened to me , according to the custom of women , So his careful search was in vain .
DRA	Genesis	31	36	And Jacob being angry , said in a chiding manner : For what fault of mine , and for what offence on my part hast thou so hotly pursued me ,
DRA	Genesis	31	37	And searched all my household stuff ? What hast thou found of all the substance of thy house ? lay it here before my brethren , and thy brethren , and let them judge between me and thee .
DRA	Genesis	31	38	Have I therefore been with thee twenty years ? thy ewes and goats were not barren , the rams of thy flocks I did not eat :
DRA	Genesis	31	39	Neither did I shew thee that which the beast had torn , I made good all the damage : whatsoever was lost by theft , thou didst exact it of me :
DRA	Genesis	31	40	Day and night was I parched with heat , and with frost , and sleep departed from my eyes .
DRA	Genesis	31	41	And in this manner have I served thee in thy house twenty years , fourteen for thy daughters , and six for thy flocks : thou hast changed also my wages ten times .
DRA	Genesis	31	42	Unless the God of my father Abraham , and the fear of Isaac had stood by me , peradventure now thou hadst sent me away naked : God beheld my affliction and the labour of my hands , and rebuked thee yesterday .
DRA	Genesis	31	43	Laban answered him : The daughters are mine and the children , and thy flocks , and all things that thou seest are mine : what can I do to my children , and grandchildren ?
DRA	Genesis	31	44	Come therefore , let us enter into a league : that it may be for a testimony between me and thee .
DRA	Genesis	31	45	And Jacob took a stone , and set it up for a title :
DRA	Genesis	31	46	And he said to his brethren : Bring hither stones . And they gathering stones together , made a heap , and they ate upon it .
DRA	Genesis	31	47	And Laban called it The witness heap : and Jacob , The hillock of testimony : each of them according to the propriety of his language .
DRA	Genesis	31	48	And Laban said : This heap shall be a witness between me and thee this day , and therefore the name thereof was called Galaad , that is , The witness heap .
DRA	Genesis	31	49	The Lord behold and judge between us when we shall be gone one from the other .
DRA	Genesis	31	50	If thou afflict my daughters , and if thou bring in other wives over them : none is witness of our speech but God , who is present and beholdeth .
DRA	Genesis	31	51	And he said again to Jacob : Behold , this heap , and the stone which I have set up between me and thee ,
DRA	Genesis	31	52	Shall be a witness : this heap , I say , and the stone , be they for a testimony , if either I shall pass beyond it going towards thee , or thou shalt pass beyond it , thinking harm to me .
DRA	Genesis	31	53	The God of Abraham , and the God of Nachor , the God of their father , judge between us . And Jacob swore by the fear of his father Isaac .
DRA	Genesis	31	54	And after he had offered sacrifices in the mountain , he called his brethren to eat bread . And when they had eaten , they lodged there :
DRA	Genesis	31	55	But Laban arose in the night , and kissed his sons , and daughters , and blessed them : and returned to his place . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Genesis	32	32	Therefore the children of Israel , unto this day , eat not the sinew , that shrank in Jacob 's thigh : because he touched the sinew of his thigh and it shrank . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Genesis	32	1899	American Edition
DRA	Genesis	32	2	And when he saw them , he said : These are the camps of God , and he called the name of that place Mahanaim , that is , Camps .
DRA	Genesis	32	3	And he sent messengers before him to Esau his brother to the land of Seir to the country of Edom :
DRA	Genesis	32	4	And he commanded them , saying : Thus shall ye speak to my lord Esau : Thus saith thy brother Jacob : I have sojourned with Laban , and have been with him until this day .
DRA	Genesis	32	5	I have oxen , and asses , and sheep , and menservants , and womenservants : and now I send a message to my lord , that I may find favour in thy sight .
DRA	Genesis	32	6	And the messengers returned to Jacob , saying : We came to Esau thy brother , and behold he cometh with speed to meet thee with four hundred men .
DRA	Genesis	32	7	Then Jacob was greatly afraid ; and in his fear divided the people that was with him , and the flocks , and the sheep , and the oxen , and the camels , into two companies ,
DRA	Genesis	32	8	Saying : If Esau come to one company and destroy it , the other company that is left shall escape .
DRA	Genesis	32	9	And Jacob said : O God of my father Abraham , and God of my father Isaac , O Lord , who saidst to me : Return to thy land and to the place of thy birth , and I will do well for thee ,
DRA	Genesis	32	10	I am not worthy of the least of all thy mercies , and of thy truth which thou hast fulfilled to thy servant . With my staff I passed over this Jordan ; and now I return with two companies .
DRA	Genesis	32	11	Deliver me from the hand of my brother Esau , for I am greatly afraid of him : lest perhaps he come , and kill the mother with the children .
DRA	Genesis	32	12	Thou didst say that thou wouldst do well by me , and multiply my seed like the sand of the sea , which can not be numbered for multitude .
DRA	Genesis	32	13	And when he had slept there that night , he set apart , of the things which he had , presents for his brother Esau .
DRA	Genesis	32	14	Two hundred she goats , twenty he goats , two hundred ewes , and twenty rams ,
DRA	Genesis	32	15	Thirty milch camels with their colts , forty kine , and twenty bulls , twenty she asses , and ten of their foals .
DRA	Genesis	32	16	And he sent them by the hands of his servants , every drove by itself , and he said to his servants : Go before me , and let there be a space between drove and drove .
DRA	Genesis	32	17	And he commanded the first , saying : If thou meet my brother Esau , and he ask thee : Whose art thou ? or whither goest thou ? or whose are these before thee ?
DRA	Genesis	32	18	Thou shalt answer : Thy servant Jacob 's : he hath sent them as a present to my lord Esau : and he cometh after us .
DRA	Genesis	32	19	In like manner he commanded the second and the third , and all that followed the droves , saying : Speak ye the same words to Esau , when ye find him .
DRA	Genesis	32	20	And ye shall add : Thy servant Jacob himself also followeth after us : for he said : I will appease him with the presents that go before , and afterwards I will see him , perhaps he will be gracious to me .
DRA	Genesis	32	21	So the presents went before him , but himself lodged that night in the camp .
DRA	Genesis	32	22	And rising early he took his two wives , and his two handmaids , with his eleven sons , and passed over the ford of Jaboc .
DRA	Genesis	32	23	And when all things were brought over that belonged to him ,
DRA	Genesis	32	24	He remained alone : and behold a man wrestled with him till morning .
DRA	Genesis	32	25	And when he saw that he could not overcome him , he touched the sinew of his thigh , and forthwith it shrank .
DRA	Genesis	32	26	And he said to him : Let me go , for it is break of day . He answered : I will not let thee go except thou bless me .
DRA	Genesis	32	27	And he said : What is thy name ? He answered : Jacob .
DRA	Genesis	32	28	But he said : Thy name shall not be called Jacob , but Israel : for if thou hast been strong against God , how much more shalt thou prevail against men ?
DRA	Genesis	32	29	Jacob asked him , Tell me by what name art thou called ? He answered : Why dost thou ask my name ? And he blessed him in the same place .
DRA	Genesis	32	30	And Jacob called the name of the place Phanuel , saying : I have seen God face to face , and my soul has been saved .
DRA	Genesis	32	31	And immediately the sun rose upon him , after he was past Phanuel ; but he halted on his foot .
DRA	Genesis	33	33	And Jacob lifting up his eyes , saw Esau coming , and with him four hundred men : and he divided the children of Lia , and of Rachel , and of the two handmaids :
DRA	Genesis	33	1899	American Edition
DRA	Genesis	33	2	And he put both the handmaids and their children foremost : and Lia and her children in the second place : and Rachel and Joseph last .
DRA	Genesis	33	3	And he went forward and bowed down with his face to the ground seven times until his brother came near .
DRA	Genesis	33	4	Then Esau ran to meet his brother , and embraced him : and clasping him fast about the neck , and kissing him , wept .
DRA	Genesis	33	5	And lifting up his eyes , he saw the women and their children , and said : What mean these ? And do they belong to thee ? He answered : They are the children which God hath given to me thy servant .
DRA	Genesis	33	6	Then the handmaids and their children came near , and bowed themselves .
DRA	Genesis	33	7	Lia also with her children came near , and bowed down in like manner , and last of all Joseph and Rachel bowed down .
DRA	Genesis	33	8	And Esau said : What are the droves that I met ? He answered : That I might find favour before my lord .
DRA	Genesis	33	9	But he said : I have plenty , my brother , keep what is thine for thyself .
DRA	Genesis	33	10	And Jacob said : Do not so I beseech thee , but if I have found favour in thy eyes , receive a little present at my hands : for I have seen thy face , as if I should have seen the countenance of God : be gracious to me ,
DRA	Genesis	33	11	And take the blessing , which I have brought thee , and which God hath given me , who giveth all things . He took it with much ado at his brother 's earnest pressing him ,
DRA	Genesis	33	12	And said : Let us go on together , and I will accompany thee in thy journey .
DRA	Genesis	33	13	And Jacob said : My lord , thou knowest that I have with me tender children , and sheep , and kine with young : which if I should cause to be overdriven , in one day all the flocks will die .
DRA	Genesis	33	14	May it please my lord to go before his servant : and I will follow softly after him , as I shall see my children to be able , until I come to my lord in Seir .
DRA	Genesis	33	15	Esau answered : I beseech thee , that some of the people at least , who are with me , may stay to accompany thee in the way . And he said : There is no necessity : I want nothing else but only to find favour , my lord , in thy sight .
DRA	Genesis	33	16	So Esau returned , that day , the way that he came , to Seir .
DRA	Genesis	33	17	And Jacob came to Socoth : where having built a house , and pitched tents , he called the name of the place Socoth , that is , Tents .
DRA	Genesis	33	18	And he passed over to Salem , a city of the Sichemites , which is in the land of Chanaan , after he returned from Mesopotamia of Syria : and he dwelt by the town :
DRA	Genesis	33	19	And he bought that part of the field , in which he pitched his tents , of the children of Hemor , the father of Sichem for a hundred lambs .
DRA	Genesis	33	20	And raising an altar there , he invoked upon it the most mighty God of Israel . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Genesis	34	34	And Dina the daughter of Lia went out to see the women of that country .
DRA	Genesis	34	1899	American Edition
DRA	Genesis	34	2	And when Sichem the son of Hemor the Hevite , the prince of that land , saw her , he was in love with her : and took her away , and lay with her , ravishing the virgin .
DRA	Genesis	34	3	And his soul was fast knit unto her , and whereas she was sad , he comforted her with sweet words .
DRA	Genesis	34	4	And going to Hemor his father , he said : Get me this damsel to wife .
DRA	Genesis	34	5	But when Jacob had heard this , his sons being absent , and employed in feeding the cattle , he held his peace till they came back .
DRA	Genesis	34	6	And when Hemor the father of Sichem was come out to speak to Jacob ,
DRA	Genesis	34	7	Behold his sons came from the field : and hearing what had passed , they were exceeding angry , because he had done a foul thing in Israel , and committed an unlawful act , in ravishing Jacob 's daughter ,
DRA	Genesis	34	8	And Hemor spoke to them : The soul of my son Sichem has a longing for your daughter : give her him to wife :
DRA	Genesis	34	9	And let us contract marriages one with another : give us your daughters and take you our daughters ,
DRA	Genesis	34	10	And dwell with us : the land is at your command , till , trade , and possess it .
DRA	Genesis	34	11	Sichem also said to her father and to her brethren : Let me find favour in your sight : and whatsoever you shall appoint I will give .
DRA	Genesis	34	12	Raise the dowry , and ask gifts , and I will gladly give what you shall demand : only give me this damsel to wife .
DRA	Genesis	34	13	The sons of Jacob answered Sichem and his father deceitfully , being enraged at the deflowering of their sister :
DRA	Genesis	34	14	We can not do what you demand , nor give our sister to one that is uncircumcised , which with us is unlawful and abominable .
DRA	Genesis	34	15	But in this we may be allied with you , if you will be like us , and all the male sex among you be circumcised :
DRA	Genesis	34	16	Then will we mutually give and take your daughters , and ours : and we will dwell with you , and will be one people :
DRA	Genesis	34	17	But if you will not be circumcised , we will take our daughter and depart :
DRA	Genesis	34	18	Their offer pleased Hemor , and Sichem his son :
DRA	Genesis	34	19	And the young man made no delay , but forthwith fulfilled what was required , for he loved the damsel exceedingly , and he was the greatest man in all his father 's house .
DRA	Genesis	34	20	And going into the gate of the city they spoke to the people :
DRA	Genesis	34	21	These men are peaceable and willing to dwell with us : let them trade in the land , and till it , which being large and wide wanteth men to till it : we shall take their daughters for wives , and we will give them ours .
DRA	Genesis	34	22	One thing there is for which so great a good is deferred : We must circumcise every male among us , following the manner of the nation .
DRA	Genesis	34	23	And their substance , and cattle , and all that they possess , shall be ours : only in this let us condescend , and by dwelling together , we shall make one people .
DRA	Genesis	34	24	And they all agreed , and circumcised all the males .
DRA	Genesis	34	25	And behold the third day , when the pain of the wound was greatest , two of the sons of Jacob , Simeon and Levi , the brothers of Dina , taking their swords , entered boldly into the city , and slew all the men :
DRA	Genesis	34	26	And they killed also Hemor and Sichem , and took away their sister Dina , out of Sichem 's house .
DRA	Genesis	34	27	And when they were gone out , the other sons of Jacob came upon the slain ; and plundered the city in revenge of the rape .
DRA	Genesis	34	28	And they took their sheep and their herds and their asses , wasting all they had in their houses and in the fields .

DRA	Genesis	34	30	And when they had boldly perpetrated these things , Jacob said to Simeon and Levi : You have troubled me , and made me hateful to the Chanaanites and Pherezites , the inhabitants of this land : we are few : they will gather themselves together and kill me ; and both I , and my house , shall be destroyed .

DRA	Genesis	35	1899	American Edition
DRA	Genesis	35	2	And Jacob having called together all his household , said : Cast away the strange gods that are among you , and be cleansed and change your garments .
DRA	Genesis	35	3	Arise , and let us go up to Bethel , that we may make there an altar to God : who heard me in the day of my affliction , and accompanied me in my journey .
DRA	Genesis	35	4	So they gave him all the strange gods they had , and the earrings which were in their ears : and he buried them under the turpentine tree , that is behind the city of Sichem .

DRA	Genesis	35	12	And the land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac , I will give to thee , and to thy seed after thee .
DRA	Genesis	35	13	And he departed from him .
DRA	Genesis	35	14	But he set up a monument of stone , in the place where God had spoken to him : pouring drink offerings upon it , and pouring oil thereon :
DRA	Genesis	35	15	And calling the name of that place Bethel .
DRA	Genesis	35	16	And going forth from thence , he came in the springtime to the land which leadeth to Ephrata : wherein when Rachel was in travail ,
DRA	Genesis	35	17	By reason of her hard labour she began to be in danger , and the midwife said to her : Fear not , for thou shalt have this son also .
DRA	Genesis	35	18	And when her soul was departing for pain , and death was now at hand , she called the name of her son Benoni , that is , The son of my pain : but his father called him Benjamin , that is , The son of the right hand .

DRA	Genesis	35	21	Departing thence , he pitched his tent beyond the Flock tower .
DRA	Genesis	35	22	And when he dwelt in that country , Ruben went , and slept with Bala , the concubine of his father : which he was not ignorant of . Now the sons of Jacob were twelve .

DRA	Genesis	37	37	And Jacob dwelt in the land of Chanaan wherein his father sojourned .
DRA	Genesis	37	1899	American Edition
DRA	Genesis	37	2	And these are his generations : Joseph , when he was sixteen years old , was feeding the flock with his brethren , being but a boy : and he was with the sons of Bala and of Zelpha his father 's wives : and he accused his brethren to his father of a most wicked crime .
DRA	Genesis	37	3	Now Israel loved Joseph above all his sons , because he had him in his old age : and he made him a coat of divers colours .
DRA	Genesis	37	4	And his brethren seeing that he was loved by his father , more than all his sons , hated him , and could not speak peaceably to him .
DRA	Genesis	37	5	Now it fell out also that he told his brethren a dream , that he had dreamed : which occasioned them to hate him the more .
DRA	Genesis	37	6	And he said to them : Hear my dream which I dreamed .
DRA	Genesis	37	7	I thought we were binding sheaves in the field : and my sheaf arose as it were , and stood , and your sheaves standing about , bowed down before my sheaf .
DRA	Genesis	37	8	His brethren answered : Shalt thou be our king ? or shall we be subject to thy dominion ? Therefore this matter of his dreams and words ministered nourishment to their envy and hatred .
DRA	Genesis	37	9	He dreamed also another dream , which he told his brethren , saying : I saw in a dream , as it were the sun , and the moon , and eleven stars worshipping me .
DRA	Genesis	37	10	And when he had told this to his father and brethren , his father rebuked him , and said : What meaneth this dream that thou hast dreamed ? shall I and thy mother , and thy brethren worship thee upon the earth ?
DRA	Genesis	37	11	His brethren therefore envied him : but his father considered the thing with himself .
DRA	Genesis	37	12	And when his brethren abode in Sichem feeding their father 's flocks ,
DRA	Genesis	37	13	Israel said to him : Thy brethren feed the sheep in Sichem : come , I will send thee to them . And when he answered :
DRA	Genesis	37	14	I am ready : he said to him : Go , and see if all things be well with thy brethren , and the cattle : and bring me word again what is doing . So being sent from the vale of Hebron , he came to Sichem :
DRA	Genesis	37	15	And a man found him there wandering in the field , and asked what he sought .
DRA	Genesis	37	16	But he answered : I seek my brethren ; tell me where they feed the flocks .
DRA	Genesis	37	17	And the man said to him : They are departed from this place : for I heard them say : Let us go to Dothain . And Joseph went forward after his brethren , and found them in Dothain .
DRA	Genesis	37	18	And when they saw him afar off , before he came nigh them , they thought to kill him .
DRA	Genesis	37	19	And said one to another : Behold the dreamer cometh .
DRA	Genesis	37	20	Come , let us kill him , and cast him into some old pit : and we will say : Some evil beast hath devoured him : and then it shall appear what his dreams avail him :
DRA	Genesis	37	21	And Ruben hearing this , endeavoured to deliver him out of their hands , and said :
DRA	Genesis	37	22	Do not take away his life , nor shed his blood : but cast him into this pit , that is in the wilderness , and keep your hands harmless : now he said this , being desirous to deliver him out of their hands and to restore him to his father .
DRA	Genesis	37	23	And as soon as he came to his brethren , they forthwith stript him of his outside coat , that was of divers colours :
DRA	Genesis	37	24	And cast him into an old pit , where there was no water .
DRA	Genesis	37	25	And sitting down to eat bread , they saw some Ismaelites on their way coming from Galaad , with their camels , carrying spices , and balm , and myrrh to Egypt .
DRA	Genesis	37	26	And Juda said to his brethren : What will it profit us to kill our brother , and conceal his blood ?
DRA	Genesis	37	27	It is better that he be sold to the Ismaelites , and that our hands be not defiled : for he is our brother and our flesh . His brethren agreed to his words .
DRA	Genesis	37	28	And when the Madianite merchants passed by , they drew him out of the pit , and sold him to the Ismaelites , for twenty pieces of silver : and they led him into Egypt .
DRA	Genesis	37	29	And Ruben , returning to the pit , found not the boy :
DRA	Genesis	37	30	And rending his garments he went to his brethren , and said : The boy doth not appear and whither shall I go ?
DRA	Genesis	37	31	And they took his coat , and dipped it in the blood of a kid , which they had killed :
DRA	Genesis	37	32	Sending some to carry it to their father , and to say : This we have found : see whether it be thy son 's coat , or not .
DRA	Genesis	37	33	And the father acknowledging it , said : It is my son 's coat , an evil wild beast hath eaten him , a beast hath devoured Joseph .
DRA	Genesis	37	34	And tearing his garments , he put on sackcloth , mourning for his son a long time .
DRA	Genesis	37	35	And all his children being gathered together to comfort their father in his sorrow , he would not receive comfort , but said : I will go down to my son into hell , mourning . And whilst he continued weeping ,
DRA	Genesis	37	36	The Madianites sold Joseph in Egypt to Putiphar , an eunuch of Pharao , captain of the soldiers . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Genesis	38	38	At that time Juda went down from his brethren , and turned in to a certain Odollamite , named Hiras .
DRA	Genesis	38	1899	American Edition
DRA	Genesis	38	2	And he saw there the daughter of a man of Chanaan , called Sue : and taking her to wife , he went in unto her .
DRA	Genesis	38	3	And she conceived , and bore a son , and called his name Her .
DRA	Genesis	38	4	And conceiving again , she bore a son , and called him Onan .
DRA	Genesis	38	5	She bore also a third : whom she called Sela . After whose birth , she ceased to bear any more .
DRA	Genesis	38	6	And Juda took a wife for Her his firstborn , whose name was Thamar .
DRA	Genesis	38	7	And Her , the firstborn of Juda , was wicked in the sight of the Lord : and was slain by him .
DRA	Genesis	38	8	Juda , therefore said to Onan his son : Go in to thy brother 's wife and marry her , that thou mayst raise seed to thy brother .
DRA	Genesis	38	9	He knowing that the children should not be his , when he went in to his brother 's wife , spilled his seed upon the ground , lest children should be born in his brother 's name .
DRA	Genesis	38	10	And therefore the Lord slew him , because he did a detestable thing .
DRA	Genesis	38	11	Wherefore Juda said to Thamar his daughter in law : Remain a widow in thy father 's house , till Sela my son grow up : for he was afraid lest he also might die , as his brethren did . She went her way and dwelt in her father 's house .
DRA	Genesis	38	12	And after many days were past , the daughter of Sue the wife of Juda died : and when he had taken comfort after his mourning , he went up to Thamnas , to the shearers of his sheep , he and Hiras the Odollamite the shepherd of his flock .
DRA	Genesis	38	13	And it was told Thamar that her father in law was come up to Thamnas to shear his sheep .
DRA	Genesis	38	14	And she put off the garments of her widowhood , and took a veil : and changing her dress , sat in the cross way , that leadeth to Thamnas : because Sela was grown up , and she had not been married to him .
DRA	Genesis	38	15	When Juda saw her , he thought she was a harlot : for she had covered her face , lest she should be known .
DRA	Genesis	38	16	And going to her , he said : Suffer me to lie with thee : for he knew her not to be his daughter in law . And she answered : What wilt thou give me to enjoy my company ?
DRA	Genesis	38	17	He said : I will send thee a kid out of the flock . And when she said again : I will suffer what thou wilt , if thou give a pledge , till thou send what thou promisest ,
DRA	Genesis	38	18	Juda said : What wilt thou have for a pledge ? She answered : Thy ring and bracelet , and the staff which thou holdest in thy hand . The woman therefore at one copulation conceived .
DRA	Genesis	38	19	And she arose and went her way : and putting off the apparel which she had taken , put on the garments of her widowhood .
DRA	Genesis	38	20	And Juda sent a kid by his shepherd , the Odollamite , that he might receive the pledge again , which he had given to the woman : but he , not finding her ,
DRA	Genesis	38	21	Asked the men of that place : Where is the woman that sat in the cross way ? And when they all made answer : There was no harlot in this place ,
DRA	Genesis	38	22	He returned to Juda , and said to him : I have not found her ; moreover the men of that place said to me , that there never sat a harlot there .
DRA	Genesis	38	23	Juda said : Let her take it to herself ; surely she can not charge us with a , lie : I sent the kid which I promised : and thou didst not find her .
DRA	Genesis	38	24	And behold after three months they told Juda , saying : Thamar , thy daughter in law hath played the harlot , and she appeareth to have a big belly . And Juda said : Bring her out that she may be burnt .
DRA	Genesis	38	25	But when she was led to execution , she sent to her father in law , saying : By the man , to whom these things belong , I am with child . See whose ring , and bracelet , and staff this is .
DRA	Genesis	38	26	But he acknowledging the gifts , said : She is juster than I : because I did not give her to Sela , my son . However , he knew her no more .
DRA	Genesis	38	27	And when she was ready to be brought to bed , there appeared twins in her womb : and in the very delivery of the infants , one put forth a hand , whereon the midwife tied a scarlet thread , saying :
DRA	Genesis	38	28	This shall come forth the first .
DRA	Genesis	38	29	But he drawing back his hand , the other came forth : and the woman said : Why is the partition divided for thee ? and therefore called his name Phares .
DRA	Genesis	38	30	Afterwards his brother came out , on whose hand was the scarlet thread : and she called him Zara . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Genesis	39	39	And Joseph was brought into Egypt , and Putiphar an eunuch of Pharao , chief captain of the army , an Egyptian , bought him of the Ismaelites , by whom he was brought .
DRA	Genesis	39	1899	American Edition
DRA	Genesis	39	2	And the Lord was with him , and he was a prosperous man in all things : and he dwelt in his master 's house ,
DRA	Genesis	39	3	Who knew very well that the Lord was with him , and made all that he did to prosper in his hand .
DRA	Genesis	39	4	And Joseph found favour in the sight of his master , and ministered to him : and being set over all by him , he governed the house committed to him , and all things that were delivered to him :
DRA	Genesis	39	5	And the Lord blessed the house of the Egyptian for Joseph 's sake , and multiplied all his substance , both at home , and in the fields .
DRA	Genesis	39	6	Neither knew he any other thing , but the bread which he ate . And Joseph was of a beautiful countenance , and comely to behold .
DRA	Genesis	39	7	And after many days his mistress cast her eyes on Joseph , and said : Lie with me .
DRA	Genesis	39	8	But he , in no wise consenting to that wicked act , said to her : Behold , my master hath delivered all things to me , and knoweth not what he hath in his own house :
DRA	Genesis	39	9	Neither is there any thing which is not in my power , or that he hath not delivered to me , but thee , who art his wife : how then can I do this wicked thing , and sin against my God ?
DRA	Genesis	39	10	With such words as these day by day , both the woman was importunate with the young man , and he refused the adultery .
DRA	Genesis	39	11	Now it happened on a certain day , that Joseph went into the house , and was doing some business without any , man with him :
DRA	Genesis	39	12	And she catching the skirt of his garment , said : Lie with me . But he leaving the garment in her hand , fled , and went out .
DRA	Genesis	39	13	And when the woman saw the garment in her hands , and herself disregarded ,
DRA	Genesis	39	14	She called to her the men of her house , and said to them : See , he hath brought in a Hebrew , to abuse us : he came in to me , to lie with me : and when I cried out ,
DRA	Genesis	39	15	And he heard my voice , he left the garment that I held , and got him out .
DRA	Genesis	39	16	For a proof therefore of her fidelity , she kept the garment , and shewed it to her husband when he returned home :
DRA	Genesis	39	17	And said : The Hebrew servant , whom thou hast brought , came to me to abuse me .
DRA	Genesis	39	18	And when he heard me cry , he left the garment which I held , and fled out .
DRA	Genesis	39	19	His master hearing these things , and giving too much credit to his wife 's words , was very angry .
DRA	Genesis	39	20	And cast Joseph into the prison , where the king 's prisoners were kept , and he was there shut up .
DRA	Genesis	39	21	But the Lord was with Joseph and having mercy upon him gave him favour in the sight of the chief keeper of the prison :
DRA	Genesis	39	22	Who delivered into his hand all the prisoners that were kept in custody : and whatsoever was done was under him .
DRA	Genesis	39	23	Neither did he himself know any thing , having committed all things to him : for the Lord was with him , and made all that he did to prosper . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Genesis	40	40	After this , it came to pass , that two eunuchs , the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt , offended their lord .
DRA	Genesis	40	1899	American Edition
DRA	Genesis	40	2	And Pharao being angry with them ( now the one was chief butler , the other chief baker )
DRA	Genesis	40	3	He sent them to the prison of the commander of the soldiers , in which Joseph also was prisoner ,
DRA	Genesis	40	4	But the keeper of the prison delivered them to Joseph , and he served them . Some little time passed , and they were kept in custody .
DRA	Genesis	40	5	And they both dreamed a dream the same night , according to the interpretation agreeing to themselves :
DRA	Genesis	40	6	And when Joseph was come in to them in the morning , and saw them sad ,
DRA	Genesis	40	7	He asked them , saying : Why is your countenance sadder to day than usual ?
DRA	Genesis	40	8	They answered : We have dreamed a dream , and there is nobody to interpret it to us . And Joseph said to them : Doth not interpretation belong to God ? Tell me what you have dreamed .
DRA	Genesis	40	9	The chief butler first told his dream : I saw before me a vine ,
DRA	Genesis	40	10	On which were three branches , which by little and little sent out buds , and after the blossoms brought forth ripe grapes :
DRA	Genesis	40	11	And the cup of Pharao was in my hand : and I took the grapes , and pressed them into the cup which I held , and I gave the cup to Pharao .
DRA	Genesis	40	12	Joseph answered : This is the interpretation of the dream : The three branches are yet three days :
DRA	Genesis	40	13	After which Pharao will remember thy service , and will restore thee to thy former place : and thou shalt present him the cup according to thy office , as before thou wast wont to do .
DRA	Genesis	40	14	Only remember me , when it shall be well with thee , and do me this kindness : to put Pharao in mind to take me out of this prison :
DRA	Genesis	40	15	For I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews , and here without any fault was cast into the dungeon .
DRA	Genesis	40	16	The chief baker seeing that he had wisely interpreted the dream , said : I also dreamed a dream , That I had three baskets of meal upon my head :
DRA	Genesis	40	17	And that in one basket which was uppermost , I carried all meats that are made by the art of baking , and that the birds ate out of it .
DRA	Genesis	40	18	Joseph answered : This is the interpretation of the dream : The three baskets are yet three days :
DRA	Genesis	40	19	After which Pharao will take thy head from thee , and hang thee on a cross , and the birds shall tear thy flesh .
DRA	Genesis	40	20	The third day after this was the birthday of Pharao : and he made a great feast for his servants , and at the banquet remembered the chief butler , and the chief baker .
DRA	Genesis	40	21	And he restored the one to his place to present him the cup :
DRA	Genesis	40	22	The other he hanged on a gibbet , that the truth of the interpreter might be shewn .
DRA	Genesis	40	23	But the chief butler , when things prospered with him , forgot his interpreter . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Genesis	41	41	And again Pharao said to Joseph : Behold , I have appointed thee over the whole land of Egypt .
DRA	Genesis	41	1899	American Edition
DRA	Genesis	41	2	Out of which came up seven kine , very beautiful and fat : and they fed in marshy places .
DRA	Genesis	41	3	Other seven also came up out of the river , ill favoured , and leanfleshed : and they fed on the very bank of the river , in green places :
DRA	Genesis	41	4	And they devoured them , whose bodies were very beautiful and well conditioned . So Pharao awoke .
DRA	Genesis	41	5	He slept again , and dreamed another dream : Seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk full and fair :
DRA	Genesis	41	6	Then seven other ears sprung up thin and blasted ,
DRA	Genesis	41	7	And devoured all the beauty of the former . Pharao awaked after his rest :
DRA	Genesis	41	8	And when morning was come , being struck with fear , he sent to all the interpreters of Egypt , and to all the wise men : and they being called for , he told them his dream , and there was not any one that could interpret it .
DRA	Genesis	41	9	Then at length the chief butler remembering , said : I confess my sin :
DRA	Genesis	41	10	The king being angry with his servants , commanded me and the chief baker to be cast into the prison of the captain of the soldiers :
DRA	Genesis	41	11	Where in one night both of us dreamed a dream foreboding things to come .
DRA	Genesis	41	12	There was there a young man a Hebrew , servant to the same captain of the soldiers : to whom we told our dreams ,
DRA	Genesis	41	13	And we heard what afterwards the event of the thing proved to be so . For I was restored to my office : and he was hanged upon a gibbet .
DRA	Genesis	41	14	Forthwith at the king 's command , Joseph was brought out of the prison , and they shaved him , and changing his apparel , brought him in to him .
DRA	Genesis	41	15	And he said to him : I have dreamed dreams , and there is no one that can expound them : Now I have heard that thou art very wise at interpreting them .
DRA	Genesis	41	16	Joseph answered : Without me , God shall give Pharao a prosperous answer .
DRA	Genesis	41	17	So Pharao told what he had dreamed : Methought I stood upon the bank of the river ,
DRA	Genesis	41	18	And seven kine came up out of the river exceeding beautiful and full of flesh : and they grazed on green places in a marshy pasture .
DRA	Genesis	41	19	And behold , there followed these , other seven kine , so very ill favoured and lean , that I never saw the like in the land of Egypt :
DRA	Genesis	41	20	And they devoured and consumed the former ,
DRA	Genesis	41	21	And yet gave no mark of their being full : but were as lean and ill favoured as before . I awoke , and then fell asleep again ,
DRA	Genesis	41	22	And dreamed a dream : Seven ears of corn grew upon one stalk , full and very fair .
DRA	Genesis	41	23	Other seven also thin and blasted , sprung of the stock :
DRA	Genesis	41	24	And they devoured the beauty of the former : I told this dream to the conjecturers , and there is no man that can expound it .
DRA	Genesis	41	25	Joseph answered : The king 's dream is one : God hath shewn to Pharao what he is about to do .
DRA	Genesis	41	26	The seven beautiful kine , and the seven full ears , are seven years of plenty : and both contain the same meaning of the dream .
DRA	Genesis	41	27	And the seven lean and thin kine that came up after them , and the seven thin ears that were blasted with the burning wind , are seven years of famine to come :
DRA	Genesis	41	28	Which shall be fulfilled in this order :
DRA	Genesis	41	29	Behold , there shall come seven years of great plenty in the whole land of Egypt :
DRA	Genesis	41	30	After which shall follow other seven years of so great scarcity , that all the abundance before shall be forgotten : for the famine shall consume all the land ,
DRA	Genesis	41	31	And the greatness of the scarcity shall destroy the greatness of the plenty .
DRA	Genesis	41	32	And for that thou didst see the second time a dream pertaining to the same thing : it is a token of the certainty , and that the word of God cometh to pass , and is fulfilled speedily .
DRA	Genesis	41	33	Now therefore let the king provide a wise and industrious man , and make him ruler over the land of Egypt :
DRA	Genesis	41	34	That he may appoint overseers over all the countries : and gather into barns the fifth part of the fruits , during the seven fruitful years ,
DRA	Genesis	41	35	That shall now presently ensue : and let all the corn be laid up under Pharao 's hands and be reserved in the cities .
DRA	Genesis	41	36	And let it be in readiness , against the famine of seven years to come , which shall oppress Egypt , and the land shall not be consumed with scarcity .
DRA	Genesis	41	37	The counsel pleased Pharao and all his servants .
DRA	Genesis	41	38	And he said to them : Can we find such another man , that is full of the spirit of God ?
DRA	Genesis	41	39	He said therefore to Joseph : Seeing God hath shewn thee all that thou hast said , can I find one wiser and one like unto thee ?
DRA	Genesis	41	40	Thou shalt be over my house , and at the commandment of thy mouth all the people shall obey : only in the kingly throne will I be above thee .
DRA	Genesis	41	42	And he took his ring from his own hand , and gave it into his hand : and he put upon him a robe of silk , and put a chain of gold about his neck .
DRA	Genesis	41	43	And he made him go up into his second chariot , the crier proclaiming that all should bow their knee before him , and that they should know he was made governor over the whole land of Egypt .
DRA	Genesis	41	44	And the king said to Joseph : I am Pharao ; without thy commandment no man shall move hand or foot in all the land of Egypt .
DRA	Genesis	41	45	And he turned his name , and called him in the Egyptian tongue , The saviour of the world . And he gave him to wife Aseneth the daughter of Putiphare priest of Heliopolis . Then Joseph went out to the land of Egypt :
DRA	Genesis	41	46	( Now he was thirty years old when he stood before king Pharao ) and he went round all the countries of Egypt .
DRA	Genesis	41	47	And the fruitfulness of the seven years came : and the corn being bound up into sheaves was gathered together into the barns of Egypt .
DRA	Genesis	41	48	And all the abundance of grain was laid up in every city .
DRA	Genesis	41	49	And there was so great abundance of wheat , that it was equal to the sand of the sea , and the plenty exceeded measure .
DRA	Genesis	41	50	And before the famine came , Joseph had two sons born : whom Aseneth the daughter of Putiphare priest of Heliopolis bore unto him .
DRA	Genesis	41	51	And he called the name of the firstborn Manasses , saying : God hath made me to forget all my labours , and my father 's house .
DRA	Genesis	41	52	And he named the second Ephraim , saying : God hath made me to grow in the land of my poverty .
DRA	Genesis	41	53	Now when the seven years of the plenty that had been in Egypt were past :
DRA	Genesis	41	54	The seven years of scarcity , which Joseph had foretold , began to come : and the famine prevailed in the whole world , but there was bread in all the land of Egypt .
DRA	Genesis	41	55	And when there also they began to be famished , the people cried to Pharao for food . And he said to them : Go to Joseph : and do all that he shall say to you .
DRA	Genesis	41	56	And the famine increased daily in all the land : and Joseph opened all the barns , and sold to the Egyptians : for the famine had oppressed them also .
DRA	Genesis	41	57	And all provinces came into Egypt , to buy food , and to seek some relief of their want . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Genesis	42	42	And Jacob hearing that food was sold in Egypt , said to his sons : Why are ye careless ?
DRA	Genesis	42	1899	American Edition
DRA	Genesis	42	2	I have heard that wheat is sold in Egypt : go ye down , and buy us necessaries , that we may live , and not be consumed with want .
DRA	Genesis	42	3	So the ten brethren of Joseph went down , to buy corn in Egypt :
DRA	Genesis	42	4	Whilst Benjamin was kept at home by Jacob , who said to his brethren : Lest perhaps he take any harm in the journey .
DRA	Genesis	42	5	And they entered into the land of Egypt with others that went to buy . For the famine was in the land of Chanaan .
DRA	Genesis	42	6	And Joseph was governor in the land of Egypt , and corn was sold by his direction to the people . And when his brethren had bowed down to him ,
DRA	Genesis	42	7	And he knew them , he spoke as it were to strangers somewhat roughly , asking them : Whence came you ? They answered : From the land of Chanaan , to buy necessaries of life .
DRA	Genesis	42	8	And though he knew his brethren , he was not known by them .
DRA	Genesis	42	9	And remembering the dreams , which formerly he had dreamed , he said to them : You are spies . You are come to view the weaker parts of the land .
DRA	Genesis	42	10	But they said : It is not so , my lord , but thy servants are come to buy food .
DRA	Genesis	42	11	We are all the sons of one man : we are come as peaceable men , neither do thy servants go about any evil .
DRA	Genesis	42	12	And he answered them : It is otherwise : you are come to consider the unfenced parts of this land .
DRA	Genesis	42	13	But they said : We thy servants are twelve brethren , the sons of one man in the land of Chanaan : the youngest is with our father , the other is not living .
DRA	Genesis	42	14	He saith : This is it that I said : You are spies .
DRA	Genesis	42	15	I shall now presently try what you are : by the health of Pharao you shall not depart hence , until your youngest brother come .
DRA	Genesis	42	16	Send one of you to fetch him : and you shall be in prison , till what you have said be proved , whether it be true or false : or else by the health of Pharao you are spies .
DRA	Genesis	42	17	So he put them in prison three days .
DRA	Genesis	42	18	And the third day he brought them out of prison , and said : Do as I have said , and you shall live : for I fear God .
DRA	Genesis	42	19	If you be peaceable men , let one of your brethren be bound in prison : and go ye your ways and carry the corn that you have bought , unto your houses .
DRA	Genesis	42	20	And bring your youngest brother to me , that I may find your words to be true , and you may not die . They did as he had said .
DRA	Genesis	42	21	And they talked one to another : We deserve to suffer these things , because we have sinned against our brother , seeing the anguish of his soul , when he besought us , and we would not hear : therefore is this affliction come upon us .
DRA	Genesis	42	22	And Ruben one of them , said : Did not I say to you : Do not sin against the boy : and you would not hear me ? Behold his blood is required .
DRA	Genesis	42	23	And they knew not that Joseph understood , because he spoke to them by an interpreter .
DRA	Genesis	42	24	And he turned himself away a little while , and wept : and returning he spoke to them .
DRA	Genesis	42	25	And taking Simeon , and binding him in their presence , he commanded his servants to fill their sacks with wheat , and to put every man 's money again in their sacks , and to give them besides provisions for the way : and they did so .
DRA	Genesis	42	26	But they having loaded their asses with the corn , went their way .
DRA	Genesis	42	27	And one of them opening his sack , to give his beast provender in the inn , saw the money in the sack 's mouth ;
DRA	Genesis	42	28	And said to his brethren : My money is given me again , behold it is in the sack . And they were astonished , and troubled , and said to one another : What is this that God hath done unto us ?
DRA	Genesis	42	29	And they came to Jacob their father in the land of Chanaan , and they told him all things that had befallen them , saying :
DRA	Genesis	42	30	The lord of the land spoke roughly to us , and took us to be spies of the country .
DRA	Genesis	42	31	And we answered him : We are peaceable men , and we mean no plot .
DRA	Genesis	42	32	We are twelve brethren born of one father : one is not living , the youngest is with our father in the land of Chanaan .
DRA	Genesis	42	33	And he said to us : Hereby shall I know that you are peaceable men : Leave one of your brethren with me , and take ye necessary provision for your houses , and go your ways .
DRA	Genesis	42	34	And bring your youngest brother to me , that I may know you are not spies : and you may receive this man again , that is kept in prison : and afterwards may have leave to buy what you will .
DRA	Genesis	42	35	When they had told this , they poured out their corn and every man found his money tied in the mouth of his sack : and all being astonished together ,
DRA	Genesis	42	36	Their father Jacob said : You have made me to be without children : Joseph is not living , Simeon is kept in bonds , and Benjamin you will take away : all these evils are fallen upon me .
DRA	Genesis	42	37	And Ruben answered him : Kill my two sons if I bring him not again to thee : deliver him into my hand , and I will restore him to thee .
DRA	Genesis	42	38	But he said : My son shall not go down with you : his brother is dead , and he is left alone : if any mischief befall him in the land to which you go , you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to hell . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Genesis	43	43	In the mean time the famine was heavy upon all the land .
DRA	Genesis	43	1899	American Edition
DRA	Genesis	43	2	And when they had eaten up all the corn , which they had brought out of Egypt , Jacob said to his sons : Go again and buy us a little food .
DRA	Genesis	43	3	Juda answered : The man declared unto us with the attestation of an oath , saying : You shall not see my face , unless you bring your youngest brother with you .
DRA	Genesis	43	4	If therefore thou wilt send him with us , we will set out together , and will buy necessaries for thee .
DRA	Genesis	43	5	But if thou wilt not , we will not go : for the man , as we have often said , declared unto us , saying : You shall not see my face without your youngest brother .
DRA	Genesis	43	6	Israel said to them : You have done this for my misery in that you told him you had also another brother .
DRA	Genesis	43	7	But they answered : The man asked us in order concerning our kindred : if our father lived : if we had a brother : and we answered him regularly , according to what he demanded : could we know that he would say : Bring hither your brother with you ?
DRA	Genesis	43	8	And Juda said to his father : Send the boy with me , that we may set forward , and may live : lest both we and our children perish .
DRA	Genesis	43	9	I take the boy upon me , require him at my hand : unless I bring him again , and restore him to thee , I will be guilty of sin against thee for ever .
DRA	Genesis	43	10	If delay had not been made , we had been here again the second time .
DRA	Genesis	43	11	Then Israel said to them : If it must needs be so , do what you will : take of the best fruits of the land in your vessels , and carry down presents to the man , a little balm , and honey , and storax , myrrh , turpentine , and almonds .
DRA	Genesis	43	12	And take with you double money , and carry back what you found in your sacks , lest perhaps it was done by mistake .
DRA	Genesis	43	13	And take also your brother , and go to the man .
DRA	Genesis	43	14	And may my almighty God make him favourable to you ; and send back with you your brother , whom he keepeth , and this Benjamin : and as for me I shall be desolate without children .
DRA	Genesis	43	15	So the men took the presents , and double money , and Benjamin : and went down into Egypt , and stood before Joseph .
DRA	Genesis	43	16	And when he had seen them , and Benjamin with them , he commanded the steward of his house , saying : Bring in the men into the house , and kill victims , and prepare a feast : because they shall eat with me at noon .
DRA	Genesis	43	17	He did as he was commanded , and brought the men into the house .
DRA	Genesis	43	18	And they being much afraid , said there one to another : Because of the money , which we carried back the first time in our sacks , we are brought in : that he may bring upon us a false accusation , and by violence make slaves of us and our asses .
DRA	Genesis	43	19	Wherefore going up to the steward of the house , at the door ,
DRA	Genesis	43	20	They said : Sir , we desire thee to hear us : We came down once before to buy food :
DRA	Genesis	43	21	And when we had bought , and come to the inn , we opened our sacks , and found our money in the mouths of the sacks : which we have now brought again in the same weight .
DRA	Genesis	43	22	And we have brought other money besides , to buy what we want : we can not tell who put it in our bags .
DRA	Genesis	43	23	But he answered : Peace be with you , fear not : your God , and the God of your father hath given you treasure in your sacks . For the money , which you gave me , I have for good . And he brought Simeon out to them .
DRA	Genesis	43	24	And having brought them into the house , he fetched water , and they washed their feet , and he gave provender to their asses .
DRA	Genesis	43	25	But they made ready the presents , against Joseph came at noon : for they had heard that they should eat bread there .
DRA	Genesis	43	26	Then Joseph came into his house , and they offered him the presents holding them in their hands , and they bowed down with their face to the ground .
DRA	Genesis	43	27	But he , courteously saluting them again , asked them , saying : Is the old man your father in health , of whom you told me ? Is he yet living ?
DRA	Genesis	43	28	And they answered : Thy servant our father is in health , he is yet living . And bowing themselves they made obeisance to him .
DRA	Genesis	43	29	And Joseph lifting up his eyes , saw Benjamin his brother , by the same mother , and said : Is this your young brother , of whom you told me ? And he said : God be gracious to thee , my son .
DRA	Genesis	43	30	And he made haste because his heart was moved upon his brother , and tears gushed out : and going into his chamber he wept .
DRA	Genesis	43	31	And when he had washed his face , coming out again , he refrained himself , and said : Set bread on the table .
DRA	Genesis	43	32	And when it was set on , for Joseph apart , and for his brethren apart , for the Egyptians also that ate with him , apart , ( for it is unlawful for the Egyptians to eat with the Hebrews , and they think such a feast profane : ) :
DRA	Genesis	43	33	They sat before him , the firstborn according to his birthright , and the youngest according to his age . And they wondered very much :
DRA	Genesis	43	34	Taking the messes which they received of him : and the greater mess came to Benjamin , so that it exceeded by five parts . And they drank , and were merry with him . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Genesis	44	44	And Joseph commanded the steward of his house , saying : Fill their sacks with corn , as much as they can hold : and put the money of every one in the top of his sack .
DRA	Genesis	44	1899	American Edition
DRA	Genesis	44	2	And in the mouth of the younger 's sack put my silver cup , and the price which he gave for the wheat . And it was so done .
DRA	Genesis	44	3	And when the morning arose , they were sent away with their asses .
DRA	Genesis	44	4	And when they were now departed out of the city , and had gone forward a little way ; Joseph sending for the steward of his house , said : Arise , and pursue after the men : and when thou hast overtaken them , say to them : Why have you returned evil for good ?
DRA	Genesis	44	5	The cup which you have stolen is that in which my lord drinketh , and in which he is wont to divine : you have done a very evil thing .
DRA	Genesis	44	6	He did as he had commanded him . And having overtaken them , he spoke to them the same words .
DRA	Genesis	44	7	And they answered : Why doth our lord speak so , as though thy servants had committed so heinous a fact ?
DRA	Genesis	44	8	The money , that we found in the top of our sacks , we brought back to thee from the land of Chanaan : how then should it be that we should steal out of thy lord 's house , gold or silver ?
DRA	Genesis	44	9	With whomsoever of thy servants shall be found that which thou seekest , let him die , and we will be the bondmen of my lord .
DRA	Genesis	44	10	And he said to them : Let it be according to your sentence : with whomsoever it shall be found , let him be my servant , and you shall be blameless .
DRA	Genesis	44	11	Then they speedily took down their sacks to the ground , and every man opened his sack .
DRA	Genesis	44	12	Which when he had searched , beginning at the eldest and ending at the youngest , he found the cup in Benjamin 's sack .
DRA	Genesis	44	13	Then they rent their garments , and loading their asses again , returned into the town .
DRA	Genesis	44	14	And Juda at the head of his brethren went in to Joseph , ( for he was not yet gone out of the place , ) and they altogether fell down before him on the ground .
DRA	Genesis	44	15	And he said to them : Why would you do so ? know you not that there is no one like me in the science of divining .
DRA	Genesis	44	16	And Juda said to him : What shall we answer my lord ? or what shall we say , or be able justly to allege ? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants : behold , we are all bondmen to my lord , both we , and he with whom the cup was found .
DRA	Genesis	44	17	Joseph answered : God forbid that I should do so : he that stole the cup , he shall be my bondman : and go you away free to your father .
DRA	Genesis	44	18	Then Juda coming nearer , said boldly : I beseech thee , my lord , let thy servant speak a word in thy ears , and be not angry with thy servant : for after Pharao thou art ,
DRA	Genesis	44	19	My lord . Thou didst ask thy servants the first time : Have you a father or a brother ?
DRA	Genesis	44	20	And we answered thee , my lord : We have a father an old man , and a young boy , that was born in his old age ; whose brother by the mother is dead : and he alone is left of his mother , and his father loveth him tenderly .
DRA	Genesis	44	21	And thou saidst to thy servants : Bring him hither to me , and I will set my eyes on him .
DRA	Genesis	44	22	We suggested to my lord : The boy can not leave his father : for if he leave him , he will die .
DRA	Genesis	44	23	And thou saidst to thy servants : Except your youngest brother come with you , you shall see my face no more .
DRA	Genesis	44	24	Therefore when we were gone up to thy servant our father , we told him all that my lord had said .
DRA	Genesis	44	25	And our father said : Go again , and buy us a little wheat .
DRA	Genesis	44	26	And we said to him : We can not go : if our youngest brother go down with us , we will set out together : otherwise , without him we dare not see the man 's face .
DRA	Genesis	44	27	Whereunto he answered : You know that my wife bore me two .
DRA	Genesis	44	28	One went out , and you said : A beast devoured him : and hitherto he appeareth not .
DRA	Genesis	44	29	If you take this also , and any thing befall him in the way you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow unto hell .
DRA	Genesis	44	30	Therefore if I shall go to thy servant our father , and the boy be wanting , ( whereas his life dependeth upon the life of him , )
DRA	Genesis	44	31	And he shall see that he is not with us , he will die , and thy servants shall bring down his gray hairs with sorrow unto hell .
DRA	Genesis	44	32	Let me be thy proper servant , who took him into my trust , and promised , saying : If I bring him not again , I will be guilty of sin against my father for ever .
DRA	Genesis	44	33	Therefore I thy servant will stay instead of the boy in the service of my lord , and let the boy go up with his brethren .
DRA	Genesis	44	34	For I can not return to my father without the boy , lest I be a witness of the calamity that will oppress my father . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Genesis	45	45	Joseph could no longer refrain himself before many that stood by : whereupon he commanded that all should go out , and no stranger be present at their knowing one another .
DRA	Genesis	45	1899	American Edition
DRA	Genesis	45	2	And he lifted up his voice with weeping , which the Egyptians and all the house of Pharao heard .
DRA	Genesis	45	3	And he said to his brethren : I am Joseph : is my father yet living ? His brethren could not answer him , being struck with exceeding great fear .
DRA	Genesis	45	4	And he said mildly to them : Come nearer to me . And when they were come near him , he said : I am Joseph , your brother , whom you sold into Egypt .
DRA	Genesis	45	5	Be not afraid , and let it not seem to you a hard case that you sold me into these countries : for God sent me before you into Egypt for your preservation .
DRA	Genesis	45	6	For it is two years since the famine began to be upon the land , and five years more remain , wherein there can be neither ploughing nor reaping .
DRA	Genesis	45	7	And God sent me before , that you may be preserved upon the earth , and may have food to live .
DRA	Genesis	45	8	Not by your counsel was I sent hither , but by the will of God : who hath made me as it were a father to Pharao , and lord of his whole house , and governor in all the land of Egypt .
DRA	Genesis	45	9	Make haste , and go ye up to my father , and say to him : Thus saith thy son Joseph : God hath made me lord of the whole land of Egypt : come down to me , linger not .
DRA	Genesis	45	10	And thou shalt dwell in the land of Gessen : and thou shalt be near me , thou and thy sons , and thy sons ' sons , thy sheep , and thy herds , and all things that thou hast .
DRA	Genesis	45	11	And there I will feed thee , ( for there are yet five years of famine remaining , ) lest both thou perish , and thy house , and all things that thou hast .
DRA	Genesis	45	12	Behold , your eyes , and the eyes of my brother Benjamin see that it is my mouth that speaketh to you .
DRA	Genesis	45	13	You shall tell my father of all my glory , and all things that you have seen in Egypt : make haste and bring him to me .
DRA	Genesis	45	14	And falling upon the neck of his brother Benjamin , he embraced him and wept : and Benjamin in like manner wept also on his neck .
DRA	Genesis	45	15	And Joseph kissed all his brethren , and wept upon every one of them : after which they were emboldened to speak to him .
DRA	Genesis	45	16	And it was heard , and the fame was abroad in the king 's court : The brethren of Joseph are come : and Pharao with all his family was glad .
DRA	Genesis	45	17	And he spoke to Joseph that he should give orders to his brethren , saying : Load your beasts , and go into the land of Chanaan .
DRA	Genesis	45	18	And bring away from thence your father and kindred , and come to me : and I will give you all the good things of Egypt , that you may eat the marrow of the land .
DRA	Genesis	45	19	Give orders also that they take wagons out of the land of Egypt , for the carriage of their children and their wives : and say : Take up your father , and make haste to come with all speed :
DRA	Genesis	45	20	And leave nothing of your household stuff : for all the riches of Egypt shall be yours .
DRA	Genesis	45	21	And the sons of Israel did as they were bid . And Joseph gave them wagons according to Pharao 's commandment : and provisions for the way .
DRA	Genesis	45	22	He ordered also to be brought out for every one of them two robes : but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver with five robes of the best :
DRA	Genesis	45	23	Sending to his father as much money and raiment , adding besides ten he asses to carry off all the riches of Egypt , and as many she asses , carrying wheat and bread for the journey .
DRA	Genesis	45	24	So he sent away his brethren , and at their departing said to them : Be not angry in the way .
DRA	Genesis	45	25	And they went up out of Egypt , and came into the land of Chanaan to their father Jacob .
DRA	Genesis	45	26	And they told him , saying : Joseph thy son is living : and he is ruler in all the land of Egypt . Which when Jacob heard , he awaked as it were out of a deep sleep , yet did not believe them .
DRA	Genesis	45	27	They , on the other side , told the whole order of the thing . And when he saw the wagons and all that he had sent his spirit revived ,
DRA	Genesis	45	28	And he said : It is enough for me , if Joseph my son be yet living : I will go and see him before I die . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Genesis	46	46	And Israel taking his journey , with all that he had , came to the well of the oath , and killing victims there to the God of his father Isaac ,

DRA	Genesis	46	2	He heard him by a vision in the night calling him , and saying to him : Jacob , Jacob . And he answered him : Lo , here I am .

DRA	Genesis	47	47	Then Joseph went in and told Pharao , saying : My father and brethren , their sheep and their herds , and all that they possess , are come out of the land of Chanaan : and behold they stay in the land of Gessen .
DRA	Genesis	47	1899	American Edition
DRA	Genesis	47	2	Five men also the last of his brethren , he presented before the king :
DRA	Genesis	47	3	And he asked them : What is your occupation ? They answered : We thy servants are shepherds , both we , and our fathers .
DRA	Genesis	47	4	We are come to sojourn in thy land , because there is no grass for the flocks of thy servants , the famine being very grievous in the land of Chanaan : and we pray thee to give orders that we thy servants may be in the land of Gessen .
DRA	Genesis	47	5	The king therefore said to Joseph : Thy father and thy brethren are come to thee .
DRA	Genesis	47	6	The land of Egypt is before thee : make them dwell in the best place , and give them the land of Gessen . And if thou knowest that there are industrious men among them , make them rulers over my cattle .
DRA	Genesis	47	7	After this Joseph brought in his father to the king , and presented him before him : and he blessed him .
DRA	Genesis	47	8	And being asked by him : How many are the days of the years of thy life ?
DRA	Genesis	47	9	He answered : The days of my pilgrimage are a hundred and thirty years , few , and evil , and they are not come up to the days of the pilgrimage of my fathers .
DRA	Genesis	47	10	And blessing the king , he went out .
DRA	Genesis	47	11	But Joseph gave a possession to his father and his brethren in Egypt , in the best place of the land , in Ramesses , as Pharao had commanded .
DRA	Genesis	47	12	And he nourished them , and all his father 's house , allowing food to every one .
DRA	Genesis	47	13	For in the whole world there was want of bread , and a famine had oppressed the land : more especially of Egypt and Chanaan .
DRA	Genesis	47	14	Out of which he gathered up all the money for the corn which they bought , and brought it into the king 's treasure .
DRA	Genesis	47	15	And when the buyers wanted money , all Egypt came to Joseph , saying : Give us bread : why should we die in thy presence , having now no money .
DRA	Genesis	47	16	And he answered them : Bring me your cattle , and for them I will give you food , if you have no money .
DRA	Genesis	47	17	And when they had brought them , he gave them food in exchange for their horses , and sheep , and oxen , and asses and he maintained them that year for the exchange of their cattle .
DRA	Genesis	47	18	And they came the second year , and said to him : We will not hide from our lord , how that our money is spent , and our cattle also are gone : neither art thou ignorant that we have nothing now left but our bodies and our lands .
DRA	Genesis	47	19	Why therefore shall we die before thy eyes ? we will be thine , both we and our lands : buy us to be the king 's servants , and give us seed , lest for want of tillers the land be turned into a wilderness .
DRA	Genesis	47	20	So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt , every man selling his possessions , because of the greatness of the famine . And he brought it into Pharao 's hands :
DRA	Genesis	47	21	And all its people from one end of the borders of Egypt , even to the other end thereof ,
DRA	Genesis	47	22	Except the land of the priests , which had been given them by the king : to whom also a certain allowance of food was given out of the public stores , and therefore they were not forced to sell their possessions .
DRA	Genesis	47	23	Then Joseph said to the people : Behold as you see , both you and your lands belong to Pharao : take seed and sow the fields ,
DRA	Genesis	47	24	That you may have corn . The fifth part you shall give to the king : the other four you shall have for seed , and for food for your families and children .
DRA	Genesis	47	25	And they answered : Our life is in thy hand : only let my lord look favourably upon us , and we will gladly serve the king .
DRA	Genesis	47	26	From that time unto this day , in the whole land of Egypt , the fifth part is paid to the king , and it is become as a law , except the land of the priests , which was free from this covenant .
DRA	Genesis	47	27	So Israel dwelt in Egypt , that is , in the land of Gessen , and possessed it : and grew , and was multiplied exceedingly .
DRA	Genesis	47	28	And he lived in it seventeen years : and all the days of his life came to a hundred and forty-seven years .
DRA	Genesis	47	29	And when he saw that the day of his death drew nigh , he called his son Joseph , and said to him : If I have found favour in thy sight , put thy hand under my thigh ; and thou shalt shew me this kindness and truth , not to bury me in Egypt :
DRA	Genesis	47	30	But I will sleep with my fathers , and thou shalt take me away out of this land , and bury me in the burying place of my ancestors . And Joseph answered him : I will do what thou hast commanded .
DRA	Genesis	47	31	And he said : Swear then to me . And as he was swearing , Israel adored God , turning to the bed 's head . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Genesis	48	48	After these things , it was told Joseph that his father was sick : and he set out to go to him , taking his two sons Manasses and Ephraim .
DRA	Genesis	48	1899	American Edition
DRA	Genesis	48	2	And it was told the old man : Behold thy son Joseph cometh to thee . And being strengthened he sat on his bed .
DRA	Genesis	48	3	And when Joseph was come in to him , he said : God Almighty appeared to me at Luza , which is in the land of Chanaan : and he blessed me ,
DRA	Genesis	48	4	And he said : I will cause thee to increase and multiply , and I will make of thee a multitude of people : and I will give this land to thee , and to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession .
DRA	Genesis	48	5	So thy two sons who were born to thee in the land of Egypt before I came hither to thee , shall be mine : Ephraim and Manasses shall be reputed to me as Ruben and Simeon .
DRA	Genesis	48	6	But the rest whom thou shalt have after them , shall be thine , and shall be called by the name of their brethren in their possessions .
DRA	Genesis	48	7	For , when I came out of Mesopotamia , Rachel died from me in the land of Chanaan in the very journey , and it was springtime : and I was going to Ephrata , and I buried her near the way of Ephrata , which by another name is called Bethlehem .
DRA	Genesis	48	8	Then seeing his sons , he said to him : Who are these ?
DRA	Genesis	48	9	He answered : They are my sons , whom God hath given me in this place . And he said : Bring them to me that I may bless them .
DRA	Genesis	48	10	For Israel 's eyes were dim by reason of his great age , and he could not see clearly . And when they were brought to him , he kissed and embraced them .
DRA	Genesis	48	11	And said to his son : I am not deprived of seeing thee : moreover God hath shewed me thy seed .
DRA	Genesis	48	12	And when Joseph had taken them from his father 's lap , he bowed down with his face to the ground .
DRA	Genesis	48	13	And he set Ephraim on his right hand , that is , towards the left hand of Israel ; but Manasses on his left hand , to wit , towards his father 's right hand , and brought them near to him .
DRA	Genesis	48	14	But he stretching forth his right hand , put it upon the head of Ephraim the younger brother ; and the left upon the head of Manasses who was the elder , changing his hands .
DRA	Genesis	48	15	And Jacob blessed the sons of Joseph , and said : God , in whose sight my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked , God that feedeth me from my youth until this day ;
DRA	Genesis	48	16	The angel that delivereth me from all evils , bless these boys : and let my name be called upon them , and the names of my fathers Abraham , and Isaac , and may they grow into a multitude upon the earth .
DRA	Genesis	48	17	And Joseph seeing that his father had put his right hand upon the head of Ephraim , was much displeased : and taking his father 's hand he tried to lift it from Ephraim 's head , and to remove it to the head of Manasses .
DRA	Genesis	48	18	And he said to his father : It should not be so , my father : for this is the firstborn , put thy right hand upon his head .
DRA	Genesis	48	19	But he refusing , said : I know , my son , I know : and this also shall become peoples , and shall be multiplied : but this younger brother shall be greater than he : and his seed shall grow into nations .
DRA	Genesis	48	20	And he blessed them at that time , saying : In thee shall Israel be blessed , and it shall be said : God do to thee as to Ephraim , and as to Manasses . And he set Ephraim before Manasses .
DRA	Genesis	48	21	And he said to Joseph his son : Behold I die , and God will be with you , and will bring you back into the land of your fathers .

DRA	Genesis	49	4	Thou art poured out as water , grow thou not : because thou wentest up to thy father 's bed , and didst defile his couch .
DRA	Genesis	49	5	Simeon and Levi brethren : vessels of iniquity , waging war .
DRA	Genesis	49	6	Let not my soul go into their counsel , nor my glory be in their assembly : because in their fury they slew a man , and in their selfwill they undermined a wall .
DRA	Genesis	49	7	Cursed be their fury , because it was stubborn : and their wrath because it was cruel : I will divide them in Jacob , and will scatter them in Israel .
DRA	Genesis	49	8	Juda , thee shall thy brethren praise : thy hands shall be on the necks of thy enemies : the sons of thy father shall bow down to thee .

DRA	Genesis	49	12	His eyes are more beautiful than wine , and his teeth whiter than milk .
DRA	Genesis	49	13	Zabulon shall dwell on the sea shore , and in the road of ships , reaching as far as Sidon .
DRA	Genesis	49	14	Issachar shall be a strong ass lying down between the borders .
DRA	Genesis	49	15	He saw rest that it was good : and the land that it was excellent : and he bowed his shoulder to carry , and became a servant under tribute .
DRA	Genesis	49	16	Dan shall judge his people like another tribe in Israel .
DRA	Genesis	49	17	Let Dan be a snake in the way , a serpent in the path , that biteth the horse 's heels that his rider may fall backward .
DRA	Genesis	49	18	I will look for thy salvation , O Lord .
DRA	Genesis	49	19	Gad , being girded , shall fight before him : and he himself shall be girded backward .
DRA	Genesis	49	20	Aser , his bread shall be fat , and he shall yield dainties to kings .
DRA	Genesis	49	21	Nephtali , a hart let loose , and giving words of beauty .
DRA	Genesis	49	22	Joseph is a growing son , a growing son and comely to behold ; the daughters run to and fro upon the wall .
DRA	Genesis	49	23	But they that held darts provoked him , and quarrelled with him , and envied him .
DRA	Genesis	49	24	His bow rested upon the strong , and the bands of his arms and his hands were loosed , by the hands of the mighty one of Jacob : thence he came forth a pastor , the stone of Israel .
DRA	Genesis	49	25	The God of thy father shall be thy helper , and the Almighty shall bless thee with the blessings of heaven above , with the blessings of the deep that lieth beneath , with the blessings of the breasts and of the womb .

DRA	Genesis	49	30	Over against Mambre in the land of Chanaan , which Abraham bought together with the field of Ephron the Hethite for a possession to bury in .

DRA	Genesis	50	50	And when Joseph saw this , he fell upon his father 's face weeping and kissing him .
DRA	Genesis	50	1899	American Edition
DRA	Genesis	50	2	And he commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father .
DRA	Genesis	50	3	And while they were fulfilling his commands , there passed forty days : for this was the manner with bodies that were embalmed , and Egypt mourned for him seventy days .
DRA	Genesis	50	4	And the time of the mourning being expired , Joseph spoke to the family of Pharao : If I have found favour in your sight , speak in the ears of Pharao :
DRA	Genesis	50	5	For my father made me swear to him , saying : Behold I die : thou shalt bury me in my sepulchre which I have digged for myself in the land of Chanaan . So I will go up and bury my father , and return .
DRA	Genesis	50	6	And Pharao said to him : Go up and bury thy father according as he made thee swear .
DRA	Genesis	50	7	So he went up , and there went with him all the ancients of Pharao 's house , and all the elders of the land of Egypt ,
DRA	Genesis	50	8	And the house of Joseph with his brethren , except their children , and their flocks and herds , which they left in the land of Gessen .
DRA	Genesis	50	9	He had also in his train chariots and horsemen : and it was a great company .
DRA	Genesis	50	10	And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad , which is situated beyond the Jordan : where celebrating the exequies with a great and vehement lamentation , they spent full seven days .
DRA	Genesis	50	11	And when the inhabitants of Chanaan saw this , they said : This is a great mourning to the Egyptians . And therefore the name of that place was called , The mourning of Egypt .
DRA	Genesis	50	12	So the sons of Jacob did as he had commanded them .
DRA	Genesis	50	13	And carrying him into the land of Chanaan , they buried him in the double cave which Abraham had bought together with the field for a possession of a buryingplace , of Ephron the Hethite over against Mambre .
DRA	Genesis	50	14	And Joseph returned into Egypt with his brethren , and all that were in his company , after he had buried his father .
DRA	Genesis	50	15	Now he being dead , his brethren were afraid , and talked one with another : Lest perhaps he should remember the wrong he suffered , and requite us all the evil that we did to him .
DRA	Genesis	50	16	And they sent a message to him , saying : Thy father commanded us before he died ,
DRA	Genesis	50	17	That we should say thus much to thee from him : I beseech thee to forget the wickedness of thy brethren , and the sin and malice they practiced against thee : we also pray thee , to forgive the servants of the God of thy father this wickedness . And when Joseph heard this , he wept .
DRA	Genesis	50	18	And his brethren came to him : and worshipping prostrate on the ground they said : We are thy servants .
DRA	Genesis	50	19	And he answered them : Fear not : can we resist the will of God ?
DRA	Genesis	50	20	You thought evil against me : but God turned it into good , that he might exalt me , as at present you see , and might save many people .
DRA	Genesis	50	21	Fear not : I will feed you and your children . And he comforted them , and spoke gently and mildly .
DRA	Genesis	50	22	And he dwelt in Egypt with all his father 's house : and lived a hundred and ten years . And he saw the children of Ephraim to the third generation . The children also of Machir the son of Manasses were born on Joseph 's knees .
DRA	Genesis	50	23	After which he told his brethren : God will visit you after my death , and will make you go up out of this land , to the land which he swore to Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob .
DRA	Genesis	50	24	And he made them swear to him , saying : God will visit you , carry my bones with you out of this place :

DRA	Exodus	1	1	These are the names of the children of Israel , that went into Egypt with Jacob : they went in , every man with his household :
DRA	Exodus	1	1899	American Edition
DRA	Exodus	1	2	Ruben , Simeon , Levi , Juda ,
DRA	Exodus	1	3	Issachar , Zabulon , and Benjamin ,
DRA	Exodus	1	4	Dan , and Nephtali , Gad and Aser .
DRA	Exodus	1	5	And all the souls that came out of Jacob 's thigh , were seventy : but Joseph was in Egypt .
DRA	Exodus	1	6	After he was dead , and all his brethren , and all that generation ,
DRA	Exodus	1	7	The children of Israel increased , and sprung up into multitudes , and growing exceedingly strong they filled the land .
DRA	Exodus	1	8	In the mean time there arose a new king over Egypt , that knew not Joseph :
DRA	Exodus	1	9	And he said to his people : Behold the people of the children of Israel are numerous and stronger than we .
DRA	Exodus	1	10	Come , let us wisely oppress them , lest they multiply : and if any war shall rise against us , join with our enemies , and having overcome us , depart out of the land .
DRA	Exodus	1	11	Therefore he set over them masters of the works , to afflict them with burdens , and they built for Pharao cities of tabernacles , Phithom and Ramesses .
DRA	Exodus	1	12	But the more they oppressed them , the more they were multiplied , and increased :
DRA	Exodus	1	13	And the Egyptians hated the children of Israel , and afflicted them and mocked them :
DRA	Exodus	1	14	And they made their life bitter with hard works in clay , and brick , and with all manner of service , wherewith they were overcharged in the works of the earth .
DRA	Exodus	1	15	And the king of Egypt spoke to the midwives of the Hebrews : of whom one was called Sephora , the other Phua ,
DRA	Exodus	1	16	Commanding them : When you shall do the office of midwives to the Hebrew women , and the time of delivery is come : if it be a man child , kill it : if a woman , keep it alive .
DRA	Exodus	1	17	But the midwives feared God , and did not do as the king of Egypt had commanded , but saved the men children .
DRA	Exodus	1	18	And the king called for them and said : What is that you meant to do , that you would save the men children ?
DRA	Exodus	1	19	They answered : The Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women : for they themselves are skillful in the office of a midwife ; and they are delivered before we come to them .
DRA	Exodus	1	20	Therefore God dealt well with the midwives : and the people multiplied and grew exceedingly strong .
DRA	Exodus	1	21	And because the midwives feared God , he built them houses .
DRA	Exodus	1	22	Pharao therefore charged all his people , saying : Whatsoever shall be born of the male sex , ye shall cast into the river : whatsoever of the female , ye shall save alive . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Exodus	2	2	And she conceived , and bore a son ; and seeing him a goodly child hid him three months .
DRA	Exodus	2	1899	American Edition
DRA	Exodus	2	3	And when she could hide him no longer , she took a basket made of bulrushes , and daubed it with slime and pitch : and put the little babe therein , and laid him in the sedges by the river 's brink ,
DRA	Exodus	2	4	His sister standing afar off , and taking notice what would be done .
DRA	Exodus	2	5	And behold the daughter of Pharao came down to wash herself in the river : and her maids walked by the river 's brink . And when she saw the basket in the sedges , she sent one of her maids for it : and when it was brought ,
DRA	Exodus	2	6	She opened it and seeing within it an infant crying , having compassion on it she said : This is one of the babes of the Hebrews .
DRA	Exodus	2	7	And the child 's sister said to her Shall I go and call to thee a Hebrew woman , to nurse the babe ?
DRA	Exodus	2	8	She answered : Go . The maid went and called her mother .
DRA	Exodus	2	9	And Pharao 's daughter said to her . Take this child and nurse him for me : I will give thee thy wages . The woman took , and nursed the child : and when he was grown up , she delivered him to Pharao 's daughter .
DRA	Exodus	2	10	And she adopted him for a son , and called him Moses , saying : Because I took him out of the water .
DRA	Exodus	2	11	In those days after Moses was grown up , he went out to his brethren : and saw their affliction , and an Egyptian striking one of the Hebrews his brethren .
DRA	Exodus	2	12	And when he had looked about this way and that way , and saw no one there , he slew the Egyptian and hid him in the sand .
DRA	Exodus	2	13	And going out the next day , he saw two Hebrews quarrelling : and he said to him that did the wrong : Why strikest thou thy neighbour ?
DRA	Exodus	2	14	But he answered : Who hath appointed thee prince and judge over us : wilt thou kill me , as thou didst yesterday kill the Egyptian ? Moses feared , and said : How is this come to be known ?
DRA	Exodus	2	15	And Pharao heard of this word and sought to kill Moses : but he fled from his sight , and abode in the land of Madian , and he sat down by a well .
DRA	Exodus	2	16	And the priest of Madian had seven daughters , who came to draw water : and when the troughs were filled , desired to water their father 's flocks .
DRA	Exodus	2	17	And the shepherds came and drove them away : and Moses arose , and defending the maids , watered their sheep .
DRA	Exodus	2	18	And when they returned to Raguel their father , he said to them : Why are ye come sooner than usual ?
DRA	Exodus	2	19	They answered : A man of Egypt delivered us from the hands of the shepherds : and he drew water also with us , and gave the sheep to drink .
DRA	Exodus	2	20	But he said : Where is he ? why have you let the man go ? call him that he may eat bread .
DRA	Exodus	2	21	And Moses swore that he would dwell with him . And he took Sephora his daughter to wife :
DRA	Exodus	2	22	And she bore him a son , whom he called Gersam , saying : I have been a stranger in a foreign country . And she bore another , whom he called Eliezer , saying : For the God of my father , my helper hath delivered me out of the hand of Pharao .
DRA	Exodus	2	23	Now after a long time the king of Egypt died : and the children of Israel groaning , cried out because of the works : and their cry went up unto God from the works .
DRA	Exodus	2	24	And he heard their groaning , and remembered the covenant which he made with Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob .

DRA	Exodus	3	1899	American Edition
DRA	Exodus	3	2	And the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush : and he saw that the bush was on fire and was not burnt .
DRA	Exodus	3	4	And when the Lord saw that he went forward to see , he called to him out of the midst of the bush , and said : Moses , Moses . And he answered : Here I am .
DRA	Exodus	3	5	And he said : Come not nigh hither , put off the shoes from thy feet : for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground .
DRA	Exodus	3	6	And he said : I am the God of thy father , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob . Moses hid his face : for he durst not look at God .
DRA	Exodus	3	7	And the Lord said to him : I have seen the affliction of my people in Egypt , and I have heard their cry because of the rigour of them that are over the works :
DRA	Exodus	3	8	And knowing their sorrow , I am come down to deliver them out of the hands of the Egyptians , and to bring them out of that land into a good and spacious land , into a land that floweth with milk and honey , to the places of the Chanaanite , and Hethite , and Amorrhite , and Pherezite , and Hevite , and Jebusite .
DRA	Exodus	3	9	For the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me : and I have seen their affliction , wherewith they are oppressed by the Egyptians .
DRA	Exodus	3	10	But come , and I will send thee to Pharao , that thou mayst bring forth my people , the children of Israel out of Egypt .
DRA	Exodus	3	11	And Moses said to God : Who am I that I should go to Pharao , and should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt ?
DRA	Exodus	3	12	And he said to him : I will be with thee : and this thou shalt have for a sign , that I have sent thee : When thou shalt have brought my people out of Egypt , thou shalt offer sacrifice to God upon this mountain .
DRA	Exodus	3	13	Moses said to God : Lo , I shall go to the children of Israel , and say to them : The God of your fathers hath sent me to you . If they should say to me : What is his name ? what shall I say to them ?
DRA	Exodus	3	14	God said to Moses : I AM WHO AM . He said : Thus shalt thou say to the children of Israel : HE WHO IS , hath sent me to you .

DRA	Exodus	35	20	And all the multitude of the children of Israel going out from the presence of Moses ,
DRA	Exodus	35	21	Offered firstfruits to the Lord with a most ready and devout mind , to make the work of the tabernacle of the testimony . Whatsoever was necessary to the service , and to the holy vestments ,
DRA	Exodus	35	22	Both men and women gave bracelets and earrings , rings and tablets : every vessel of gold was set aside to be offered to the Lord .
DRA	Exodus	35	23	If any man had violet , and purple , and scarlet twice dyed , fine linen and goats ' hair , rams ' skins dyed red , and violet coloured skins ,
DRA	Exodus	35	24	Metal of silver and brass , they offered it to the Lord , and setim wood for divers uses .

DRA	Exodus	35	29	All both men and women with devout mind offered gifts , that the works might be done which the Lord had commanded by the hand of Moses . All the children of Israel dedicated voluntary offerings to the Lord .

DRA	Exodus	35	31	And hath filled him with the spirit of God , with wisdom and understanding and knowledge and all learning .

DRA	Exodus	36	36	And four pillars of setim wood , which with their heads be overlaid with gold , casting for them sockets of silver .
DRA	Exodus	36	1899	American Edition
DRA	Exodus	36	2	And when Moses had called them , and every skillful man , to whom the Lord had given wisdom , and such as of their own accord had offered themselves to the making of the work ,
DRA	Exodus	36	3	He delivered all the offerings of the children of Israel unto them . And while they were earnest about the work , the people daily in the morning offered their vows .
DRA	Exodus	36	4	Whereupon the workmen being constrained to come ,
DRA	Exodus	36	5	Said to Moses : The people offereth more than is necessary .
DRA	Exodus	36	6	Moses therefore commanded proclamation to be made by the crier 's voice : Let neither man nor woman offer any more for the work of the sanctuary . And so they ceased from offering gifts ,
DRA	Exodus	36	7	Because the things that were offered did suffice , and were too much .
DRA	Exodus	36	8	And all the men that were wise of heart , to accomplish the work of the tabernacle , made ten curtains of twisted fine linen , and violet , and purple , and scarlet twice dyed , with varied work , and the art of embroidering :
DRA	Exodus	36	9	The length of one curtain was twenty-eight cubits , and the breadth four : all the curtains were of the same size .
DRA	Exodus	36	10	And he joined five curtains , one to another , and the other five he coupled one to another .
DRA	Exodus	36	11	He made also loops of violet in the edge of the curtain on both sides , and in the edge of the other curtain in like manner ,
DRA	Exodus	36	12	That the loops might meet on against another , and might be joined each with the other .
DRA	Exodus	36	13	Whereupon also he cast fifty rings of gold , that might catch the loops of the curtains , and they might be made one tabernacle .
DRA	Exodus	36	14	He made also eleven curtains of goats ' hair , to cover the roof of the tabernacle :
DRA	Exodus	36	15	One curtain was thirty cubits long and four cubits broad : all the curtains were of one measure .
DRA	Exodus	36	16	Five of which he joined apart , and the other six apart .
DRA	Exodus	36	17	And he made fifty loops in the edge of one curtain , and fifty in the edge of another curtain , that they might be joined one to another .
DRA	Exodus	36	18	And fifty buckles of brass wherewith the roof might be knit together , that of all the curtains there might be made one covering .
DRA	Exodus	36	19	He made also a cover for the tabernacle of rams ' skins dyed red : and another cover over that of violet skins .
DRA	Exodus	36	20	He made also the boards of the tabernacle of setim wood standing .
DRA	Exodus	36	21	The length of one board was ten cubits : and the breadth was one cubit and a half .
DRA	Exodus	36	22	There were two mortises throughout every board , that one might be joined to the other . And in this manner he made for all the boards of the tabernacle .
DRA	Exodus	36	23	Of which twenty were at the south side southward ,
DRA	Exodus	36	24	With forty sockets of silver , two sockets were put under one board on the two sides of the corners , where the mortises of the sides end in the corners .
DRA	Exodus	36	25	At that side also of the tabernacle , that looketh toward the north , he made twenty boards .
DRA	Exodus	36	26	With forty sockets of silver , two sockets for every board .
DRA	Exodus	36	27	But against the west , to wit , at that side of the tabernacle , which looketh to the sea , he made six boards ,
DRA	Exodus	36	28	And two others at each corner of the tabernacle behind :
DRA	Exodus	36	29	Which were also joined from beneath unto the top , and went together into one joint . Thus he did on both sides at the corners :
DRA	Exodus	36	30	So there were in all eight boards and they had sixteen sockets of silver , to wit , two sockets under every board .
DRA	Exodus	36	31	He made also bars of setim wood , five to hold together the boards of one side of the tabernacle ,
DRA	Exodus	36	32	And five others to join together the boards of the other side : and besides these , five other bars at the west side of the tabernacle towards the sea .
DRA	Exodus	36	33	He made also another bar , that might come by the midst of the boards from corner to corner .
DRA	Exodus	36	34	And the board works themselves he overlaid with gold , casting for them sockets of silver . And their rings he made of gold , through which the bars might be drawn : and he covered the bars themselves with plates of gold .
DRA	Exodus	36	35	He made also a veil of violet , and purple , scarlet , and fine twisted linen , varied and distinguished with embroidery :
DRA	Exodus	36	37	He made also a hanging in the entry of the tabernacle of violet , purple , scarlet , and fine twisted linen , with the work of an embroiderer .

DRA	Exodus	37	7	Two cherubims also of beaten gold , which he set on the two sides of the propitiatory :
DRA	Exodus	37	8	One cherub in the top of one side , and the other cherub in the top of the other side : two cherubims at the two ends of the propitiatory ,
DRA	Exodus	37	9	Spreading their wings , and covering the propitiatory , and looking one towards the other , and towards it .
DRA	Exodus	37	10	He made also the table of setim wood , in length two cubits , and in breadth one cubit , and in height it was a cubit and a half .
DRA	Exodus	37	11	And he overlaid it with the finest gold , and he made to it a golden ledge round about .
DRA	Exodus	37	12	And to the ledge itself he made a polished crown of gold , of four fingers ' breadth , and upon the same another golden crown .
DRA	Exodus	37	13	And he cast four rings of gold , which he put in the four corners at each foot of the table ,
DRA	Exodus	37	14	Over against the crown : and he put the bars into them , that the table might be carried .
DRA	Exodus	37	15	And the bars also themselves he made of setim wood , and overlaid them with gold ,
DRA	Exodus	37	16	And the vessels for the divers uses of the table , dishes , bowls , and cups , and censers of pure gold , wherein the libations are to be offered .
DRA	Exodus	37	17	He made also the candlestick of beaten work of the finest gold . From the shaft whereof its branches , its cups , and bowls , and lilies came out :
DRA	Exodus	37	18	Six on the two sides : three branches on one side , and three on the other .
DRA	Exodus	37	19	Three cups in manner of a nut on each branch , and bowls withal and lilies ; and three cups of the fashion of a nut in another branch , and bowls withal and lilies . The work of the six branches that went out from the shaft of the candlestick was equal .
DRA	Exodus	37	20	And in the shaft itself were four cups after the manner of a nut , and bowls withal at every one , and lilies :
DRA	Exodus	37	21	And bowls under two branches in three places , which together make six branches going out from one shaft .
DRA	Exodus	37	22	So both the bowls , and the branches were of the same , all beaten work of the purest gold .
DRA	Exodus	37	23	He made also the seven lamps with their snuffers , and the vessels where the snuffings were to be put out , of the purest gold .
DRA	Exodus	37	24	The candlestick with all the vessels thereof weighed a talent of gold .
DRA	Exodus	37	25	He made also the altar of incense of setim wood , being a cubit on every side foursquare , and in height two cubits : from the corners of which went out horns .
DRA	Exodus	37	26	And he overlaid it with the purest gold , with its grate and the sides , and the horns .
DRA	Exodus	37	27	And he made to it a crown of gold round about , and two golden rings under the crown at each side , that the bars might be put into them , and the altar be carried .
DRA	Exodus	37	28	And the bars themselves he made also of setim wood , and overlaid them with plates of gold .

DRA	Exodus	38	3	And for the uses thereof , he prepared divers vessels of brass , cauldrons , tongs , fleshhooks , pothooks , and firepans .
DRA	Exodus	38	4	And he made the grate thereof of brass , in manner of a net , and under it in the midst of the altar a hearth ,
DRA	Exodus	38	5	Casting four rings at the four ends of the net at the top , to put in bars to carry it .
DRA	Exodus	38	6	And he made the bars of setim wood , and overlaid them with plates of brass :
DRA	Exodus	38	7	And he drew them through the rings that stood out in the sides of the altar . And the altar itself was not solid , but hollow , of boards , and empty within .
DRA	Exodus	38	8	He made also the laver of brass , with the foot thereof , of the mirrors of the women that watch at the door of the tabernacle .
DRA	Exodus	38	9	He made also the court , in the south side whereof were hangings of fine twisted linen , of a hundred cubits ,
DRA	Exodus	38	10	Twenty pillars of brass with their sockets , the heads of the pillars , and the whole graving of the work , of silver .
DRA	Exodus	38	11	In like manner at the north side the hangings , the pillars , and the sockets and heads of the pillars were of the same measure , and work and metal .
DRA	Exodus	38	12	But on that side that looketh to the west , there were hangings of fifty cubits , ten pillars of brass with their sockets , and the heads of the pillars , and all the graving of the work , of silver .
DRA	Exodus	38	13	Moreover towards the east he prepared hangings of fifty cubits :
DRA	Exodus	38	14	Fifteen cubits of which were on one side with three pillars , and their sockets :
DRA	Exodus	38	15	And on the other side ( for between the two he made the entry of the tabernacle ) there were hangings equally of fifteen cubits , and three pillars , and as many sockets .
DRA	Exodus	38	16	All the hangings of the court were woven with twisted linen .
DRA	Exodus	38	17	The sockets of the pillars were of brass , and their heads with all their gravings of silver : and he overlaid the pillars of the court also with silver .
DRA	Exodus	38	18	And he made in the entry thereof an embroidered hanging of violet , purple , scarlet , and fine twisted linen , that was twenty cubits long , and five cubits high according to the measure of all the hangings of the court .
DRA	Exodus	38	19	And the pillars in the entry were four with sockets of brass , and their heads and gravings of silver .
DRA	Exodus	38	20	The pins also of the tabernacle and of the court round about he made of brass .
DRA	Exodus	38	21	These are the instruments of the tabernacle of the testimony , which were counted according to the commandment of Moses , in the ceremonies of the Levites , by the hand of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest :
DRA	Exodus	38	22	Which Beseleel the son of Uri the son of Hur of the tribe of Juda had made as the Lord commanded by Moses ,
DRA	Exodus	38	23	Having for his companion Ooliab the son of Achisamech of the tribe of Dan : who also was an excellent artificer in wood , and worker in tapestry and embroidery in violet , purple , scarlet , and fine linen .
DRA	Exodus	38	24	All the gold that was spent in the work of the sanctuary , and that was offered in gifts was nine and twenty talents , and seven hundred and thirty sicles according to the standard of the sanctuary .
DRA	Exodus	38	25	And it was offered by them that went to be numbered , from twenty years old and upwards , of six hundred and three thousand five hundred and fifty men able to bear arms .

DRA	Exodus	38	27	A hundred sockets were made of a hundred talents , one talent being reckoned for every socket .
DRA	Exodus	38	28	And of the thousand seven hundred and seventy-five he made the heads of the pillars , which also he overlaid with silver .

DRA	Exodus	39	2	So he made an ephod of gold , violet , and purple , and scarlet twice dyed , and fine twisted linen .
DRA	Exodus	39	3	With embroidered work : and he cut thin plates of gold , and drew them small into threads , that they might be twisted with the woof of the aforesaid colours ,
DRA	Exodus	39	4	And two borders coupled one to the other in the top on either side ,
DRA	Exodus	39	5	And a girdle of the same colours , as the Lord had commanded Moses .
DRA	Exodus	39	6	He prepared also two onyx stones , fast set and closed in gold , and graven by the art of a lapidary , with the names of the children of Israel :
DRA	Exodus	39	7	And he set them in the sides of the ephod for a memorial of the children of Israel , as the Lord had commanded Moses .
DRA	Exodus	39	8	He made also a rational with embroidered work , according to the work of the ephod , of gold , violet , purple , and scarlet twice dyed , and fine twisted linen ,
DRA	Exodus	39	9	Foursquare , double , of the measure of a span .
DRA	Exodus	39	10	And he set four rows of precious stones in it . In the first row was a sardius , a topaz , and emerald .
DRA	Exodus	39	11	In the second , a carbuncle , a sapphire , and a jasper .
DRA	Exodus	39	12	In the third , a ligurius , an agate , and an amethyst .
DRA	Exodus	39	13	In the fourth , a chrysolite , an onyx , and a beryl , set and enclosed in gold by their rows .
DRA	Exodus	39	14	And the twelve stones were engraved with the names of the twelve tribes of Israel , each one with its several name .
DRA	Exodus	39	15	They made also in the rational little chains linked one to another of the purest gold ,
DRA	Exodus	39	16	And two hooks , and as many rings of gold . And they set the rings on either side of the rational ,
DRA	Exodus	39	17	On which rings the two golden chains should hang , which they put into the hooks that stood out in the corners of the ephod .
DRA	Exodus	39	18	These both before and behind so answered one another , that the ephod and the rational were bound together ,
DRA	Exodus	39	19	Being fastened to the girdle and strongly coupled with rings , which a violet fillet joined , lest they should flag loose , and be moved one from the other , as the Lord commanded Moses .
DRA	Exodus	39	20	They made also the tunick of the ephod all of violet ,
DRA	Exodus	39	21	And a hole for the head in the upper part at the middle , and a woven border round about the hole :
DRA	Exodus	39	22	And beneath at the feet pomegranates of violet , purple , scarlet , and fine twisted linen :
DRA	Exodus	39	23	And little bells of the purest gold , which they put between the pomegranates at the bottom of the tunick round about :
DRA	Exodus	39	24	To wit , a bell of gold , and a pomegranate , wherewith the high priest went adorned , when he discharged his ministry , as the Lord had commanded Moses .
DRA	Exodus	39	25	They made also fine linen tunicks with woven work for Aaron and his sons :
DRA	Exodus	39	26	And mitres with their little crowns of fine linen :
DRA	Exodus	39	27	And linen breeches of fine linen :
DRA	Exodus	39	28	And a girdle of fine twisted linen , violet , purple , and scarlet twice dyed , of embroidery work , as the Lord had commanded Moses .
DRA	Exodus	39	29	They made also the plate of sacred veneration of the purest gold , and they wrote on it with the engraving of a lapidary , The Holy of the Lord :
DRA	Exodus	39	30	And they fastened it to the mitre with a violet fillet , as the Lord had commanded Moses .
DRA	Exodus	39	31	So all the work of the tabernacle and of the roof of the testimony was finished : and the children of Israel did all things which the Lord had commanded Moses .
DRA	Exodus	39	32	And they offered the tabernacle and the roof and the whole furniture , the rings , the boards , the bars , the pillars , and their sockets ,
DRA	Exodus	39	33	The cover of rams ' skins dyed red , and the other cover of violet skins ,

DRA	Exodus	39	38	And the hanging in the entry of the tabernacle :
DRA	Exodus	39	40	The hanging in the entry of the court , and the little cords , and the pins thereof . Nothing was wanting of the vessels , that were commanded to be made for the ministry of the tabernacle , and for the roof of the covenant .

DRA	Exodus	40	3	And shalt put the ark in it , and shalt let down the veil before it :
DRA	Exodus	40	4	And thou shalt bring in the table , and set upon it the things that are commanded according to the rite . The candlestick shall stand with its lamps ,
DRA	Exodus	40	5	And the altar of gold whereon the incense is burnt , before the ark of the testimony . Thou shalt put the hanging in the entry of the tabernacle ,
DRA	Exodus	40	6	And before it the altar of holocaust :
DRA	Exodus	40	7	The laver between the altar and the tabernacle , and thou shalt fill it with water .
DRA	Exodus	40	8	And thou shalt encompass the court with hangings , and the entry thereof .

DRA	Exodus	40	11	The laver with its foot : thou shalt consecrate all with the oil of unction , that they may be most holy .
DRA	Exodus	40	12	And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons to the door of the tabernacle of the testimony , and having washed them with water ,
DRA	Exodus	40	13	Thou shalt put on them the holy vestments , that they may minister to me , and that the unction of them may prosper to an everlasting priesthood .
DRA	Exodus	40	14	And Moses did all that the Lord had commanded .
DRA	Exodus	40	15	So in the first month of the second year , the first day of the month , the tabernacle was set up .
DRA	Exodus	40	16	And Moses reared it up , and placed the boards and the sockets and the bars , and set up the pillars ,
DRA	Exodus	40	17	And spread the roof over the tabernacle , putting over it a cover , as the Lord had commanded .
DRA	Exodus	40	18	And he put the testimony in the ark , thrusting bars underneath , and the oracle above .
DRA	Exodus	40	19	And when he had brought the ark into the tabernacle , he drew the veil before it to fulfill the commandment of the Lord .
DRA	Exodus	40	20	And he set the table in the tabernacle of the testimony at the north side without the veil ,
DRA	Exodus	40	21	Setting there in order the loaves of proposition , as the Lord had commanded Moses .
DRA	Exodus	40	22	He set the candlestick also in the tabernacle of the testimony over against the table on the south side ,
DRA	Exodus	40	23	Placing the lamps in order , according to the precept of the Lord .
DRA	Exodus	40	24	He set also the altar of gold under the roof of the testimony over against the veil ,
DRA	Exodus	40	25	And burnt upon it the incense of spices , as the Lord had commanded Moses .
DRA	Exodus	40	26	And he put also the hanging in the entry of the tabernacle of the testimony ,
DRA	Exodus	40	27	And the altar of holocaust of the entry of the testimony , offering the holocaust , and the sacrifices upon it , as the Lord had commanded .
DRA	Exodus	40	28	And he set the laver between the tabernacle of the testimony and the altar , filling it with water .
DRA	Exodus	40	29	And Moses and Aaron , and his sons washed their hands and feet ,
DRA	Exodus	40	30	When they went into the tabernacle of the covenant , and went to the altar , as the Lord had commanded Moses .
DRA	Exodus	40	31	He set up also the court round about the tabernacle and the altar , drawing the hanging in the entry thereof . After all things were perfected ,
DRA	Exodus	40	32	The cloud covered the tabernacle of the testimony , and the glory of the Lord filled it .
DRA	Exodus	40	33	Neither could Moses go into the tabernacle of the covenant , the cloud covering all things and the majesty of the Lord shining , for the cloud had covered all .
DRA	Exodus	40	34	If at any time the cloud removed from the tabernacle , the children of Israel went forward by their troops :
DRA	Exodus	40	35	If it hung over , they remained in the same place .
DRA	Exodus	40	36	For the cloud of the Lord hung over the tabernacle by day , and a fire by night , in the sight of all the children of Israel throughout all their mansions . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )

DRA	Leviticus	10	10	And that you may have knowledge to discern between holy and unholy , between unclean and clean :
DRA	Leviticus	10	1899	American Edition
DRA	Leviticus	10	2	And fire coming out from the Lord destroyed them , and they died before the Lord .
DRA	Leviticus	10	3	And Moses said to Aaron : This is what the Lord hath spoken : I will be sanctified in them that approach to me , and I will be glorified in the sight of all the people . And when Aaron heard this , he held his peace .
DRA	Leviticus	10	4	And Moses called Misael and Elisaphan , the sons of Oziel , the uncle of Aaron , and said to them : Go and take away your brethren from before the sanctuary , and carry them without the camp .
DRA	Leviticus	10	5	And they went forthwith and took them as they lay , vested with linen tunicks , and cast them forth , as had been commanded them .
DRA	Leviticus	10	6	And Moses said to Aaron , and to Eleazar and Ithamar , his sons : Uncover not your heads , and rend not your garments , lest perhaps you die , and indignation come upon all the congregation . Let your brethren , and all the house of Israel , bewail the burning which the Lord has kindled :
DRA	Leviticus	10	7	But you shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle , otherwise you shall perish , for the oil of the holy unction is on you . And they did all things according to the precept of Moses .
DRA	Leviticus	10	8	The Lord also said to Aaron :
DRA	Leviticus	10	9	You shall not drink wine nor any thing that may make drunk , thou nor thy sons , when you enter into the tabernacle of the testimony , lest you die : because it is an everlasting precept through your generations :
DRA	Leviticus	10	11	And may teach the children of Israel all my ordinances which the Lord hath spoken to them by the hand of Moses .
DRA	Leviticus	10	12	And Moses spoke to Aaron , and to Eleazar and Ithamar , his sons that were left : Take the sacrifice that is remaining of the oblation of the Lord , and eat it without leaven beside the altar , because it is holy of holies .
DRA	Leviticus	10	13	And you shall eat it in a holy place : which is given to thee and thy sons of the oblations of the Lord , as it hath been commanded me .
DRA	Leviticus	10	14	The breast also that is offered , and the shoulder that is separated , you shall eat in a most clean place , thou and thy sons , and thy daughters with thee . For they are set aside for thee and thy children , of the victims of peace offerings of the children of Israel :
DRA	Leviticus	10	15	Because they have elevated before the Lord the shoulder and the breast , and the fat that is burnt on the altar , and they belong to thee and to thy sons by a perpetual law , as the Lord hath commanded .
DRA	Leviticus	10	16	While these things were a doing , when Moses sought for the buck goat , that had been offered for sin , he found it burnt : and being angry with Eleazar and Ithamar , the sons of Aaron that were left , he said :
DRA	Leviticus	10	17	Why did you not eat in the holy place the sacrifice for sin , which is most holy , and given to you , that you may bear the iniquity of the people , and may pray for them in the sight of the Lord ,
DRA	Leviticus	10	18	Especially whereas none of the blood thereof hath been carried within the holy places , and you ought to have eaten it in the sanctuary , as was commanded me ?
DRA	Leviticus	10	19	Aaron answered : This day hath been offered the victim for sin , and the holocaust before the Lord : and to me what thou seest has happened : how could I eat it , or please the Lord in the ceremonies , having a sorrowful heart ?

DRA	Leviticus	13	13	The priest shall view him , and shall judge that the leprosy which he has is very clean : because it is all turned into whiteness , and therefore the man shall be clean .
DRA	Leviticus	13	1899	American Edition
DRA	Leviticus	13	2	The man in whose skin or flesh shalt arise a different colour or a blister , or as it were something shining , that is , the stroke of the leprosy , shall be brought to Aaron the priest , or any one of his sons .
DRA	Leviticus	13	3	And if he see the leprosy in his skin , and the hair turned white , and the place where the leprosy appears lower than the skin and the rest of the flesh : it is the stroke of the leprosy , and upon his judgment he shall be separated .
DRA	Leviticus	13	4	But if there be a shining whiteness in the skin , and not lower than the other flesh , and the hair be of the former colour , the priest shall shut him up seven days .
DRA	Leviticus	13	5	And the seventh day he shall look on him : and if the leprosy be grown no farther , and hath not spread itself in the skin , he shall shut him up again other seven days .
DRA	Leviticus	13	6	And on the seventh day , he shall look on him : if the leprosy be somewhat obscure , and not spread in the skin , he shall declare him clean , because it is but a scab : and the man shall wash his clothes , and shall be clean .
DRA	Leviticus	13	7	But if the leprosy grow again , after he was seen by the priest and restored to cleanness , he shall be brought to him ,
DRA	Leviticus	13	8	And shall be condemned of uncleanness .
DRA	Leviticus	13	9	If the stroke of the leprosy be in a man , he shall be brought to the priest ,
DRA	Leviticus	13	10	And he shall view him . And when there shall be a white colour in the skin , and it shall have changed the look of the hair , and the living flesh itself shall appear :
DRA	Leviticus	13	11	It shall be judged an inveterate leprosy , and grown into the skin . The priest therefore shall declare him unclean , and shall not shut him up , because he is evidently unclean .
DRA	Leviticus	13	12	But if the leprosy spring out running about in the skin , and cover all the skin from the head to the feet , whatsoever falleth under the sight of the eyes ,
DRA	Leviticus	13	14	But when the live flesh shall appear in him ,
DRA	Leviticus	13	15	Then by the judgment of the priest he shall be defiled , and shall be reckoned among the unclean : for live flesh , if it be spotted with leprosy , is unclean .
DRA	Leviticus	13	16	And if again it be turned into whiteness , and cover all the man ,
DRA	Leviticus	13	17	The priest shall view him , and shall judge him to be clean .
DRA	Leviticus	13	18	When also there has been an ulcer in the flesh and the skin , and it has been healed ,
DRA	Leviticus	13	19	And in the place of the ulcer , there appeareth a white scar , or somewhat red , the man shall be brought to the priest :
DRA	Leviticus	13	20	And when he shall see the place of the leprosy lower than the other flesh , and the hair turned white , he shall declare him unclean , for the plague of leprosy is broken out in the ulcer .
DRA	Leviticus	13	21	But if the hair be of the former colour , and the scar somewhat obscure , and be not lower than the flesh that is near it , he shall shut him up seven days .
DRA	Leviticus	13	22	And if it spread , he shall judge him to have the leprosy :
DRA	Leviticus	13	23	But if it stay in its place , it is but the scar of an ulcer , and the man shall be clean .
DRA	Leviticus	13	24	The flesh also and skin that hath been burnt , and after it is healed hath a white or a red scar ,
DRA	Leviticus	13	25	The priest shall view it , and if he see it turned white , and the place thereof is lower than the other skin : he shall declare him unclean , because the evil of leprosy is broken out in the scar .
DRA	Leviticus	13	26	But if the colour of the hair be not changed , nor the blemish lower than the other flesh , and the appearance of the leprosy be somewhat obscure , he shall shut him up seven days ,
DRA	Leviticus	13	27	And on the seventh day he shall view him : if the leprosy be grown farther in the skin , he shall declare him unclean .
DRA	Leviticus	13	28	But if the whiteness stay in its place , and be not very clear , it is the sore of a burning , and therefore he shall be cleansed , because it is only the scar of a burning .
DRA	Leviticus	13	29	If the leprosy break out in the head or the beard of a man or woman , the Priest shall see them ,
DRA	Leviticus	13	30	And if the place be lower than the other flesh , and the hair yellow , and thinner than usual : he shall declare them unclean , because it is the leprosy of the head and the beard ;
DRA	Leviticus	13	31	But if he perceive the place of the spot is equal with the flesh that is near it , and the hair black : he shall shut him up seven days ,
DRA	Leviticus	13	32	And on the seventh day he shall look upon it . If the spot be not grown , and the hair keep its colour , and the place of the blemish be even with the other flesh :
DRA	Leviticus	13	33	The man shall be shaven all but the place of the spot , and he shall be shut up other seven days :
DRA	Leviticus	13	34	If on the seventh day the evil seem to have stayed in its place , and not lower than the other flesh , he shall cleanse him , and his clothes being washed he shall be clean .
DRA	Leviticus	13	35	But if after his cleansing the spot spread again in the skin ,
DRA	Leviticus	13	36	He shall seek no more whether the hair be turned yellow , because he is evidently unclean .
DRA	Leviticus	13	37	But if the spot be stayed , and the hair be black , let him know that the man is healed , and let him confidently pronounce him clean .
DRA	Leviticus	13	38	If a whiteness appear in the skin of a man or a woman ,
DRA	Leviticus	13	39	The priest shall view them . If he find that a darkish whiteness shineth in the skin , let him know that it is not the leprosy , but a white blemish , and that the man is clean .
DRA	Leviticus	13	40	The man whose hair falleth off from his head , he is bald and clean :
DRA	Leviticus	13	41	And if the hair fall from his forehead , he is bald before and clean .
DRA	Leviticus	13	42	But if in the bald head or in the bald forehead there be risen a white or reddish colour ,
DRA	Leviticus	13	43	And the priest perceive this , he shall condemn him undoubtedly of leprosy which is risen in the bald part .
DRA	Leviticus	13	44	Now whosoever shall be defiled with the leprosy , and is separated by the judgment of the priest ,
DRA	Leviticus	13	45	Shall have his clothes hanging loose , his head bare , his mouth covered with a cloth , and he shall cry out that he is defiled and unclean .

DRA	Leviticus	13	51	And on the seventh day when he looketh on it again , if he find that it if grown , it is a Axed leprosy : he shall judge the garment unclean , and every thing wherein it shall be found :
DRA	Leviticus	13	52	And therefore it shall be burnt with fire .
DRA	Leviticus	13	53	But if he see that it is not grown ,
DRA	Leviticus	13	54	He shall give orders , and they shall wash that part wherein the leprosy is , and he shall shut it up other seven days .
DRA	Leviticus	13	55	And when he shall see that the former colour is not returned , nor yet the leprosy spread , he shall judge it unclean , and shall burn it with fire , for the leprosy has taken hold of the outside of the garment , or through the whole .
DRA	Leviticus	13	56	But if the place of the leprosy be somewhat dark , after the garment is washed , he shall tear it off , and divide it from that which is sound .
DRA	Leviticus	13	57	And if after this there appear in those places that before were without spot , a flying and wandering leprosy : it must be burnt with fire .
DRA	Leviticus	13	58	If it cease , he shall wash with water the parts that are pure , the second time , and they shall be clean .

DRA	Leviticus	25	3	Six years thou shalt sow thy field and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard , and shalt gather the fruits thereof :
DRA	Leviticus	25	4	But in the seventh year there shall be a sabbath to the land , of the resting of the Lord : thou shalt not sow thy field , nor prune thy vineyard .
DRA	Leviticus	25	5	What the ground shall bring forth of itself , thou shalt not reap : neither shalt thou gather the grapes of the firstfruits as a vintage : for it is a year of rest to the land :
DRA	Leviticus	25	6	But they shall be unto you for meat , to thee and to thy manservant , to thy maidservant and thy hireling , and to the strangers that sojourn with thee :
DRA	Leviticus	25	7	All things that grow shall be meat to thy beasts and to thy cattle .
DRA	Leviticus	25	8	Thou shalt also number to thee seven weeks of years , that is to say , seven times seven , which together make forty-nine years :
DRA	Leviticus	25	9	And thou shalt sound the trumpet in the seventh month , the tenth day of the month , in the time of the expiation in all your land .
DRA	Leviticus	25	10	And thou shalt sanctify the fiftieth year , and shalt proclaim remission to all the inhabitants of thy land : for it is the year of jubilee . Every man shall return to his possession , and every one shall go back to his former family :
DRA	Leviticus	25	11	Because it is the jubilee and the fiftieth year . You shall not sow , nor reap the things that grow in the field of their own accord , neither shall you gather the firstfruits of the vines ,
DRA	Leviticus	25	12	Because of the sanctification of the jubilee : but as they grow you shall presently eat them .
DRA	Leviticus	25	13	In the year of the jubilee all shall return to their possessions .
DRA	Leviticus	25	14	When thou shalt sell any thing to thy neighbour , or shalt buy of him ; grieve not thy brother : but thou shalt buy of him according to the number of years from the jubilee .
DRA	Leviticus	25	15	And he shall sell to thee according to the computation of the fruits .
DRA	Leviticus	25	16	The more years remain after the jubilee , the more shall the price increase : and the less time is counted , so much the less shall the purchase cost . For he shall sell to thee the time of the fruits .

DRA	Leviticus	25	18	Do my precepts , and keep my judgments , and fulfill them : that you may dwell in the land without any fear ,
DRA	Leviticus	25	19	And the ground may yield you its fruits , of which you may eat your fill , fearing no man 's invasion .

DRA	Leviticus	25	21	I will give you my blessing the sixth year , and it shall yield the fruits of three years :

DRA	Leviticus	25	26	But if he have no kinsman , and he himself can find the price to redeem it :
DRA	Leviticus	25	27	The value of the fruits shall be counted from that time when he sold it : and the overplus he shall restore to the buyer , and so shall receive his possession again .

DRA	Leviticus	25	31	But if the house be in a village , that hath no walls , it shall be sold according to the same law as the fields : if it be not redeemed before , in the jubilee it shall return to the owner .
DRA	Leviticus	25	32	The houses of Levites , which are in cities , may always be redeemed :
DRA	Leviticus	25	33	If they be not redeemed , in the jubilee they shall all return to the owners , because the houses of the cities of the Levites are for their possessions among the children of Israel .
DRA	Leviticus	25	34	But let not their suburbs be sold , because it is a perpetual possession .
DRA	Leviticus	25	35	If thy brother be impoverished , and weak of hand , and thou receive him as a stranger and sojourner , and he live with thee ,
DRA	Leviticus	25	36	Take not usury of him nor more than thou gavest : fear thy God , that thy brother may live with thee .

DRA	Leviticus	25	38	I am the Lord your God , who brought you out of the land of Egypt , that I might give you the land of Chanaan , and might be your God .
DRA	Leviticus	25	39	If thy brother constrained by poverty , sell himself to thee , thou shalt not oppress him with the service of bondservants :
DRA	Leviticus	25	40	But he shall be as a hireling , and a sojourner : he shall work with thee until the year of the jubilee ,
DRA	Leviticus	25	41	And afterwards he shall go out with his children , and shall return to his kindred and to the possession of his fathers ,
DRA	Leviticus	25	42	For they are my servants , and I brought them out of the land of Egypt : let them not be sold as bondmen :

DRA	Leviticus	25	49	Either his uncle , or his uncle 's son , or his kinsman , by blood , or by affinity . But if he himself be able also , he shall redeem himself ,
DRA	Leviticus	25	50	Counting only the years from the time of his selling unto the year of the jubilee : and counting the money that he was sold for , according to the number of the years and the reckoning of a hired servant ,
DRA	Leviticus	25	51	If there be many years that remain until the jubilee , according to them shall he also repay the price .
DRA	Leviticus	25	52	If few , he shall make the reckoning with him according to the number of the years , and shall repay to the buyer of what remaineth of the years ,
DRA	Leviticus	25	53	His wages being allowed for which he served before : he shall not afflict him violently in thy sight .
DRA	Leviticus	25	54	And if by these means he can not be redeemed , in the year of the jubilee he shall go out with his children .

DRA	Leviticus	26	12	I will walk among you , and will be your God , and you shall be my people .
DRA	Leviticus	26	13	I am the Lord your God : who have brought you out of the land of the Egyptians , that you should not serve them , and who have broken the chains of your necks , that you might go upright .
DRA	Leviticus	26	14	But if you will not hear me , nor do all my commandments ,
DRA	Leviticus	26	15	If you despise my laws , and contemn my judgments so as not to do those things which are appointed by me , and to make void my covenant :
DRA	Leviticus	26	16	I also will do these things to you : I will quickly visit you with poverty , and burning heat , which shall waste your eyes , and consume your lives . You shall sow your seed in vain , which shall be devoured by your enemies .
DRA	Leviticus	26	17	I will set my face against you , and you shall fall down before your enemies , and shall be made subject to them that hate you , you shall flee when no man pursueth you .

DRA	Leviticus	26	25	And I will bring in upon you the sword that shall avenge my covenant . And when you shall flee into the cities , I will send the pestilence in the midst of you , and you shall be delivered into the hands of your enemies ,
DRA	Leviticus	26	27	But if you will not for all this hearken to me , but will walk against me :
DRA	Leviticus	26	28	I will also go against you with opposite fury , and I will chastise you with seven plagues for your sins ,
DRA	Leviticus	26	29	So that you shall eat the flesh of your sons and of your daughters .

DRA	Leviticus	26	36	And as to them that shall remain of you I will send fear in their hearts in the countries of their enemies , the sound of a flying leaf shall terrify them , and they shall flee as it were from the sword : they shall fall , when no man pursueth them ,
DRA	Leviticus	26	37	And they shall every one fall upon their brethren as fleeing from wars , none of you shall dare to resist your enemies .
DRA	Leviticus	26	38	You shall perish among the Gentiles , and an enemy 's land shall consume you .
DRA	Leviticus	26	39	And if of them also some remain , they shall pine away in their iniquities , in the land of their enemies , and they shall be afflicted for the sins of their fathers , and their own :
DRA	Leviticus	26	40	Until they confess their iniquities and the iniquities of their ancestors , whereby they have transgressed me , and walked contrary unto me .
DRA	Leviticus	26	41	Therefore I also will walk them , and bring them into their enemies ' land until their uncircumcised mind be ashamed : then shall they pray for their sins .
DRA	Leviticus	26	42	And I will remember my covenant , that I made with Jacob , and Isaac , and Abraham . I will remember also the land :
DRA	Leviticus	26	43	Which when she shall be left by them , shall enjoy her sabbaths , being desolate for them . But they shall pray for their sins , because they rejected my judgments , and despised my laws .
DRA	Leviticus	26	44	And yet for all that when they were in the land of their enemies , I did not cast them off altogether , neither did I so despise them that they should be quite consumed , and I should make void my covenant with them . For I am the Lord their God .

DRA	Numbers	5	5	And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
DRA	Numbers	5	1899	American Edition
DRA	Numbers	5	2	Command the children of Israel , that they cast out of the camp every leper , and whosoever hath an issue of seed , or is defiled by the dead :
DRA	Numbers	5	3	Whether it be man or woman , cast ye them out of the camp , lest they defile it when I shall dwell with you .
DRA	Numbers	5	4	And the children of Israel did so , and they cast them forth without the camp , as the Lord had spoken to Moses .
DRA	Numbers	5	6	Say to the children of Israel : When a man or woman shall have committed any of all the sins that men are wont to commit , and by negligence shall have transgressed the commandment of the Lord , and offended ,
DRA	Numbers	5	7	They shall confess their sin , and restore the principal itself , and the fifth part over and above , to him against whom they have sinned .
DRA	Numbers	5	8	But if there be no one to receive it , they shall give it to the Lord , and it shall be the priest 's , besides the ram that is offered for expiation , to be an atoning sacrifice .
DRA	Numbers	5	9	All the firstfruits also , which the children of Israel offer , belong to the priest :
DRA	Numbers	5	10	And whatsoever is offered into the sanctuary by every one , and is delivered into the hands of the priest , it shall be his .
DRA	Numbers	5	11	And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
DRA	Numbers	5	12	Speak to the children of Israel , and thou shalt say to them : The man whose wife shall have gone astray , and contemning her husband ,
DRA	Numbers	5	13	Shall have slept with another man , and her husband can not discover it , but the adultery is secret , and can not be proved by witnesses , because she was not found in the adultery :
DRA	Numbers	5	14	If the spirit of jealousy stir up the husband against his wife , who either is defiled , or is charged with false suspicion ,
DRA	Numbers	5	15	He shall bring her to the priest , and shall offer an oblation for her , the tenth part of a measure of barley meal : he shall not pour oil thereon , nor put frankincense upon it : because it is a sacrifice of jealousy , and an oblation searching out adultery .
DRA	Numbers	5	16	The priest therefore shall offer it , and set it before the Lord .
DRA	Numbers	5	17	And he shall take holy water in an earthen vessel , and he shall cast a little earth of the pavement of the tabernacle into it .
DRA	Numbers	5	18	And when the woman shall stand before the Lord , he shall uncover her head , and shall , put on her hands the sacrifice of remembrance , and the oblation of jealousy : and he himself shall hold the most bitter waters , whereon he hath heaped curses with execration .
DRA	Numbers	5	19	And he shall adjure her , and shall say : If another man hath not slept with thee , and if thou be not defiled by forsaking thy husband 's bed , these most bitter waters , on which I have heaped curses , shall not hurt thee .
DRA	Numbers	5	20	But if thou hast gone aside from thy husband , and art defiled , and hast lain with another man :
DRA	Numbers	5	21	These curses shall light upon thee : The Lord make thee a curse , and an example for all among his people : may he make thy thigh to rot , and may thy belly swell and burst asunder .
DRA	Numbers	5	22	Let the cursed waters enter into thy belly , and may thy womb swell and thy thigh rot . And the woman shall answer , Amen , amen .
DRA	Numbers	5	23	And the priest shall write these curses in a book , and shall wash them out with the most bitter waters , upon which he hath heaped the curses ,
DRA	Numbers	5	24	And he shall give them her to drink . And when she hath drunk them up ,
DRA	Numbers	5	25	The priest shall take from her hand the sacrifice of jealousy , and shall elevate it before the Lord , and shall put it upon the altar : yet so as first ,
DRA	Numbers	5	26	To take a handful of the sacrifice of that which is offered , and burn it upon the altar : and so give the most bitter waters to the woman to drink .
DRA	Numbers	5	27	And when she hath drunk them , if she be defiled , and having despised her husband be guilty of adultery , the malediction shall go through her , and her belly swelling , her thigh shall rot : and the woman shall be a curse , and an example to all the people .
DRA	Numbers	5	28	But if she be not defiled , she shall not be hurt , and shall bear children .
DRA	Numbers	5	29	This is the law of jealousy . If a woman hath gone aside from her husband , and be defiled ,
DRA	Numbers	5	30	And the husband stirred up by the spirit of jealousy bring her before the Lord , and the priest do to her according to all things that are here written :
DRA	Numbers	5	31	The husband shall be blameless , and she shall bear her iniquity . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Numbers	6	6	All the time of his consecration he shall not go in to any dead ,
DRA	Numbers	6	1899	American Edition

DRA	Numbers	6	3	They shall abstain from wine , and from every thing that may make a man drunk . They shall not drink vinegar of wine , or of any other drink , nor any thing that is pressed out of the grape : nor shall they eat grapes either fresh or dried .
DRA	Numbers	6	4	All the days that they are consecrated to the Lord by vow : they shall eat nothing that cometh of the vineyard , from the raisin even to the kernel .
DRA	Numbers	6	5	All the time of his separation no razor shall pass over his head , until the day be fulfilled of his consecration to the Lord . He shall be holy , and shall let the hair of his head grow .
DRA	Numbers	6	7	Neither shall he make himself unclean , even for his father , or for his mother , or for his brother , or for his sister , when they die , because the consecration of his God is upon his head .
DRA	Numbers	6	8	All the days of his separation he shall be holy to the Lord .
DRA	Numbers	6	9	But if any man die suddenly before him : the head of his consecration shall be defiled : and he shall shave it forthwith on the same day of his purification , and again on the seventh day .
DRA	Numbers	6	10	And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles , or two young pigeons to the priest in the entry of the covenant of the testimony .
DRA	Numbers	6	11	And the priest shall offer one for sin , and the other for a holocaust , and shall pray for him , for that he hath sinned by the dead : and he shall sanctify his head that day :
DRA	Numbers	6	12	And shall consecrate to the Lord the days of his separation , offering a lamb of one year for sin : yet so that the former days be made void , because his sanctification was profaned .
DRA	Numbers	6	13	This is the law of consecration . When the days which he had determined by vow shall be expired , he shall bring him to the door of the tabernacle of the covenant ,
DRA	Numbers	6	14	And shall offer his oblation to the Lord : one he lamb of a year old without blemish for a holocaust , and one awe lamb of a year old without blemish for a sin offering , and one ram without blemish for a victim of peace offering ,
DRA	Numbers	6	15	A basket also of unleavened bread , tempered with oil , and wafers without leaven anointed with oil , and the libations of each :
DRA	Numbers	6	16	And the priest shall present them before the Lord , and shall offer both the sin offering and the holocaust .
DRA	Numbers	6	17	But the ram he shall immolate for a sacrifice of peace offering to the Lord , offering at the same time the basket of unleavened bread , and the libations that are due by custom .
DRA	Numbers	6	18	Then shall the hair of the consecration of the Nazarite , be shaved off before the door of the tabernacle of the covenant : and he shall take his hair , and lay it upon the fire , which is under the sacrifice of the peace offerings .
DRA	Numbers	6	19	And shall take the boiled shoulder of the ram , and one unleavened cake out of the basket , and one unleavened wafer , and he shall deliver them into the hands of the Nazarite , after his head is shaven .
DRA	Numbers	6	20	And receiving them again from him , he shall elevate them in the sight of the Lord : and they being sanctified shall belong to the priest , as the breast , which was commanded to be separated , and the shoulder . After this the Nazarite may drink wine .
DRA	Numbers	6	21	This is the law of the Nazarite , when he hath vowed his oblation to the Lord in the time of his consecration , besides those things which his hand shall find , according to that which he had vowed in his mind , so shall he do for the fulfilling of his sanctification .
DRA	Numbers	6	22	And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
DRA	Numbers	6	23	Say to Aaron and his sons : Thus shall you bless the children of Israel , and you shall say to them :
DRA	Numbers	6	24	The Lord bless thee , and keep thee .
DRA	Numbers	6	25	The Lord shew his face to thee , and have mercy on thee .
DRA	Numbers	6	26	The Lord turn his countenance to thee , and give thee peace .
DRA	Numbers	6	27	And they shall invoke my name upon the children of Israel , and I will bless them . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )

DRA	Numbers	8	22	That being purified they might go into the tabernacle of the covenant to do their services before Aaron and his sons . As the Lord had commanded Moses touching the Levites , so was it done .
DRA	Numbers	8	23	And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
DRA	Numbers	8	24	This is the law of the Levites : From twenty-five years old and upwards , they shall go in to minister in the tabernacle of the covenant .
DRA	Numbers	8	25	And when they shall have accomplished the fiftieth year of their age , they shall cease to serve :
DRA	Numbers	8	26	And they shall be the ministers of their brethren in the tabernacle of the covenant , to keep the things that are committed to their care , but not to do the works . Thus shalt thou order the Levites touching their charge . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )

DRA	Numbers	9	1899	American Edition
DRA	Numbers	9	2	Let the children of Israel make the phase in its due time ,
DRA	Numbers	9	3	The fourteenth day of this month in the evening , according to all the ceremonies and justifications thereof .
DRA	Numbers	9	4	And Moses commanded the children of Israel that they should make the phase .
DRA	Numbers	9	5	And they made it in its proper time : the fourteenth day of the month at evening , in mount Sinai . The children of Israel did according to all things that the Lord had commanded Moses .
DRA	Numbers	9	6	But behold some who were unclean by occasion of the soul of a man , who could not make the phase on that day , coming to Moses and Aaron ,
DRA	Numbers	9	7	Said to them : We are unclean by occasion of the soul of a man . Why are we kept back that we may not offer in its season the offering to the Lord among the children of Israel ?
DRA	Numbers	9	8	And Moses answered them : Stay that I may consult the Lord what he will ordain concerning you .
DRA	Numbers	9	10	Say to the children of Israel : The man that shall be unclean by occasion of one that is dead , or shall be in a journey afar off in your nation , let him make the phase to the Lord .
DRA	Numbers	9	11	In the second month , on the fourteenth day of the month in the evening , they shall eat it with unleavened bread and wild lettuce :
DRA	Numbers	9	12	They shall not leave any thing thereof until morning , a nor break a bone thereof , they shall observe all the ceremonies of the phase .
DRA	Numbers	9	13	But if any man is clean , and was not on a journey , and did not make the phase , that soul shall be cut off from among his people , because he offered not sacrifice to the Lord in due season : he shall bear his sin .
DRA	Numbers	9	14	The sojourner also and the stranger if they be among you , shall make the phase to the Lord according to the ceremonies and justifications thereof . The same ordinance shall be with you both for the stranger , and for him that was born in the land .
DRA	Numbers	9	15	Now on the day that the tabernacle was reared up , a cloud covered it . But from the evening there was over the tabernacle , as it were , the appearance of fire until the morning .
DRA	Numbers	9	16	So it was always : by day the cloud covered it , and by night as it were the appearance of fire .
DRA	Numbers	9	17	And when the cloud that covered the tabernacle was taken up , then the children of Israel marched forward : and in the place where the cloud stood still , there they camped .
DRA	Numbers	9	18	At the commandment of the Lord they marched , and at his commandment they pitched the tabernacle . All the days that the cloud abode over the tabernacle , they remained in the same place :
DRA	Numbers	9	19	And if it was so that it continued over it a long time , the children of Israel kept the watches of the Lord , and marched not ,
DRA	Numbers	9	20	For as many days soever as the cloud stayed over the tabernacle . At the commandment of the Lord they pitched their tents , and at his commandment they took them down .
DRA	Numbers	9	21	If the cloud tarried from evening until morning , and immediately at break of day left the tabernacle , they marched forward : and if it departed after a day and a night , they took down their tents .
DRA	Numbers	9	22	But if it remained over the tabernacle for two days or a month or a longer time , the children of Israel remained in the same place , and marched not : but immediately as soon as it departed , they removed the camp .
DRA	Numbers	9	23	By the word of the Lord they pitched their tents , and by his word they marched : and kept the watches of the Lord according to his commandment by the hand of Moses . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )

DRA	Numbers	10	2	Make thee two trumpets of beaten silver , wherewith thou mayest call together the multitude when the camp is to be removed .
DRA	Numbers	10	3	And when thou shalt sound the trumpets , all the multitude shall gather unto thee to the door of the tabernacle of the covenant .
DRA	Numbers	10	4	If thou sound but once , the princes and the heads of the multitude of Israel shall come to thee .
DRA	Numbers	10	5	But if the sound of the trumpets be longer , and with interruptions , they that are on the east side , shall first go forward .
DRA	Numbers	10	6	And at the second sounding and like noise of the trumpet , they who lie on the south side shall take up their tents . And after this manner shall the rest do , when the trumpets shall sound for a march .
DRA	Numbers	10	7	But when the people is to be gathered together , the sound of the trumpets shall be plain , and they shall not make a broken sound .
DRA	Numbers	10	8	And the sons of Aaron the priest shall sound the trumpets : and this shall be an ordinance for ever in your generations .
DRA	Numbers	10	9	If you go forth to war out of your land against the enemies that fight against you , you shall sound aloud with the trumpets , and there shall be a remembrance of you before the Lord your God , that you may be delivered out of the hands of your enemies .

DRA	Numbers	10	29	And Moses said to Hobab the son of Raguel the Madianite , his kinsman : We are going towards the place which the Lord will give us : come with us , that we may do thee good : for the Lord hath promised good things to Israel .
DRA	Numbers	10	30	But he answered him : I will not go with thee , but I will return to my country , wherein I was born .
DRA	Numbers	10	31	And he said : Do not leave us : for thou knowest in what places we should encamp in the wilderness , and thou shalt be our guide .
DRA	Numbers	10	32	And if thou comest with us , we will give thee what is the best of the riches which the Lord shall deliver to us .
DRA	Numbers	10	33	So they marched from the mount of the Lord three days ' journey , and the ark of the covenant of the Lord went before them , for three days providing a place for the camp .
DRA	Numbers	10	34	The cloud also of the Lord was over them by day when they marched .
DRA	Numbers	10	35	And when the ark was lifted up , Moses said : Arise , O Lord , and let thy enemies be scattered , and let them that hate thee , flee from before thy face .

DRA	Numbers	11	1899	American Edition
DRA	Numbers	11	2	And when the people cried to Moses , Moses prayed to the Lord , and the fire was swallowed up .
DRA	Numbers	11	3	And he called the name of that place , The burning : for that the fire of the Lord had been kindled against them .
DRA	Numbers	11	4	For a mixt multitude of people , that came up with them , burned with desire , sitting and weeping , the children of Israel also being joined with them , and said : Who shall give us flesh to eat ?
DRA	Numbers	11	5	We remember the Ash that we ate in Egypt free cost : the cucumbers come into our mind , and the melons , and the leeks , and the onions , and the garlic .
DRA	Numbers	11	6	Our soul is dry , our eyes behold nothing else but manna .
DRA	Numbers	11	7	A Now the manna was like coriander seed , of the colour of bdellium .
DRA	Numbers	11	8	And the people went about , and gathering it , ground it in a mill , or beat it in a mortar , and boiled it in a pot , and made cakes thereof of the taste of bread tempered with oil .
DRA	Numbers	11	9	And when the dew fell in the night upon the camp , the manna also fell with it .
DRA	Numbers	11	10	Now Moses heard the people weeping by their families , every one at the door of his tent . And the wrath of the Lord was exceedingly enkindled : to Moses also the thing seemed insupportable .
DRA	Numbers	11	12	Have I conceived all this multitude , or begotten them , that thou shouldst say to me : Carry them in thy bosom as the nurse is wont to carry the little infant , and bear them into the land , for which thou hast sworn to their fathers ?
DRA	Numbers	11	13	Whence should I have flesh to give to so great a multitude ? they weep against me , saying : Give us flesh that we may eat .
DRA	Numbers	11	14	I am not able alone to bear all this people , because it is too heavy for me .
DRA	Numbers	11	15	But if it seem unto thee otherwise , I beseech thee to kill me , and let me find grace in thy eyes , that I be not afflicted with so great evils .
DRA	Numbers	11	16	And the Lord said to Moses : Gather unto me seventy men of the ancients of Israel , whom thou knowest to be ancients and masters of the people : and thou shalt bring them to the door of the tabernacle of the covenant , and shalt make them stand there with thee ,
DRA	Numbers	11	17	That I may come down and speak with thee : and I will take of thy spirit , and will give to them , that they may bear with thee the burden of the people , and thou mayest not be burthened alone .
DRA	Numbers	11	18	And thou shalt say to the people : Be ye sanctified : to morrow you shall eat flesh : for I have heard you say : Who will give us flesh to eat ? it was well with us in Egypt . That the Lord may give you flesh , and you may eat :
DRA	Numbers	11	19	Not for one day , nor two , nor five , nor ten , no nor for twenty .
DRA	Numbers	11	20	But even for a month of days , till it come out at your nostrils , and become loathsome to you , because you have cast off the Lord , who is in the midst of you , and have wept before him , saying : Why came we out of Egypt ?
DRA	Numbers	11	21	And Moses said : There are six hundred thousand footmen of this people , and sayest thou : I will give them flesh to eat a whole month ?
DRA	Numbers	11	22	Shall then a multitude of sheep and oxen be killed , that it may suffice for their food ? or shall the fishes of the sea be gathered together to fill them ?
DRA	Numbers	11	23	And the Lord answered him : Is the hand of the Lord unable ? Thou shalt presently see whether my word shall come to pass or no .
DRA	Numbers	11	24	Moses therefore came , and told the people the words of the Lord , and assembled seventy men of the ancients of Israel , and made them to stand about the tabernacle .
DRA	Numbers	11	25	And the Lord came down in a cloud , and spoke to him , taking away of the spirit that was in Moses , and giving to the seventy men . And when the spirit had rested on them they prophesied , nor did they cease afterwards .
DRA	Numbers	11	26	Now there remained in the camp two of the men , of whom one was called Eldad , and the other Medad , upon whom the spirit rested ; for they also had been enrolled , but were not gone forth to the tabernacle .
DRA	Numbers	11	27	And when they prophesied in the camp , there ran a young man , and told Moses , saying : Eldad and Medad prophesy in the camp .
DRA	Numbers	11	28	Forthwith Josue the son of Nun , the minister of Moses , and chosen out of many , said : My lord Moses forbid them .
DRA	Numbers	11	29	But he said : Why hast thou emulation for me ? O that all the people might prophesy , and that the Lord would give them his spirit !
DRA	Numbers	11	30	And Moses returned , with the ancients of Israel , into the camp .
DRA	Numbers	11	31	And a wind going out from the Lord , taking quails up beyond the sea brought them , and cast them into the camp for the space of one day 's journey , on every side of the camp round about , and they flew in the air two cubits high above the ground .
DRA	Numbers	11	32	The people therefore rising up all that day , and night , and the next day , gathered together of quails , he that did least , ten cores : and they dried them round about the camp .
DRA	Numbers	11	33	As yet the flesh was between their teeth , neither had that kind of meat failed : when behold the wrath of the Lord being provoked against the people , struck them with an exceeding great plague .
DRA	Numbers	11	34	And that place was called , The graves of lust : for there they buried the people that had lusted . And departing from the graves of lust , they came unto Haseroth , and abode there . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )

DRA	Numbers	12	2	And they said : Hath the Lord spoken by Moses only ? hath he not also spoken to us in like manner ? And when the Lord heard this ,
DRA	Numbers	12	3	( For Moses was a man exceeding meek above all men that dwelt upon earth )
DRA	Numbers	12	4	Immediately he spoke to him , and to Aaron and Mary : Come out you three only to the tabernacle of the covenant . And when they were come out ,
DRA	Numbers	12	5	The Lord came down in a pillar of the cloud , and stood in the entry of the tabernacle calling to Aaron and Mary . And when they were come ,
DRA	Numbers	12	6	He said to them : Hear my words : if there be among you a prophet of the Lord , I will appear to him in a vision , or I will speak to him in a dream .
DRA	Numbers	12	7	But it is not so with my servant Moses a who is most faithful in all my house :
DRA	Numbers	12	8	For I speak to him mouth to mouth : and plainly , and not by riddles and figures doth he see the Lord . Why then were you not afraid to speak ill of my servant Moses ?
DRA	Numbers	12	9	And being angry with them he went away :
DRA	Numbers	12	10	The cloud also that was over the tabernacle departed : and behold Mary appeared white as snow with a leprosy . And when Aaron had looked on her , and saw her all covered with leprosy ,
DRA	Numbers	12	11	He said to Moses : I beseech thee , my lord , lay not upon us this sin , which we have foolishly committed :
DRA	Numbers	12	13	And Moses cried to the Lord , saying : O God , I beseech thee heal her .
DRA	Numbers	12	14	And the Lord answered him : If her father had spitten upon her face , ought she not to have been ashamed for seven days at least ? Let her be separated seven days without the camp , and after wards she shall be called again .
DRA	Numbers	12	15	Mary therefore was put out of the camp seven days : and the people moved not from that place until Mary was called again . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )

DRA	Numbers	13	19	View the land , of what sort it is : and the people that are the inhabitants thereof , whether they be strong or weak : few in number or many :
DRA	Numbers	13	20	The land itself , whether it be good or bad : what manner of cities , walled or without walls :
DRA	Numbers	13	21	The ground , fat or barren , woody or without trees . Be of good courage , and bring us of the fruits of the land . Now it was the time when the first ripe grapes are fit to be eaten .
DRA	Numbers	13	22	And when they were gone up , they viewed the land from the desert of Sin , unto Rohob as you enter into Emath .
DRA	Numbers	13	23	And they went up at the south side , and came to Hebron , where were Achiman and Sisai and Tholmai the sons of Enac . For Hebron was built seven years before Tanis the city of Egypt .
DRA	Numbers	13	24	And going forward as far as the torrent of the cluster of grapes , they cut off a branch with its cluster of grapes , which two men carried upon a lever . They took also of the pomegranates and of the figs of that place :
DRA	Numbers	13	25	Which was called Nehelescol , that is to say , the torrent of the cluster of grapes , because from thence the children of Israel had carried a cluster of grapes .
DRA	Numbers	13	26	And they that went to spy out the land returned after forty days , having gone round all the country ,
DRA	Numbers	13	27	And came to Moses and Aaron and to all the assembly of the children of Israel to the desert of Pharan , which is in Cades . And speaking to them and to all the multitude , they shewed them the fruits of the land :
DRA	Numbers	13	28	And they related and said : We came into the land to which thou sentest us , which in very deed floweth with milk and honey as may be known by these fruits :
DRA	Numbers	13	29	But it hath very strong inhabitants , and the cities are great and walled . We saw there the race of Enac .
DRA	Numbers	13	30	Amalec dwelleth in the south , the Hethite and the Jebusite and the Amorrhite in the mountains : but the Chanaanite abideth by the sea and near the streams of the Jordan .
DRA	Numbers	13	31	In the mean time Caleb , to still the murmuring of the people that rose against Moses , said : Let us go up and possess the land , for we shall be able to conquer it .
DRA	Numbers	13	32	But the others , that had been with him , said : No , we are not able to go up to this people , because they are stronger than we .
DRA	Numbers	13	33	And they spoke ill of the land , which they had viewed , before the children of Israel , saying : The land which we have viewed , devoureth its inhabitants : the people , that we beheld , are of a tall stature .

DRA	Numbers	14	2	And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron , saying :
DRA	Numbers	14	3	Would God that we had died in Egypt and would God we may die in this vast wilderness , and that the Lord may not bring us into this land , lest we fall by the sword , and our wives and children be led away captives . Is it not better to return into Egypt ?
DRA	Numbers	14	4	And they said one to another : Let us appoint a captain , and let us return into Egypt .
DRA	Numbers	14	5	And when Moses and Aaron heard this , they fell down flat upon the ground before the multitude of the children of Israel .
DRA	Numbers	14	6	But Josue the son of Nun , and Caleb the son of Jephone , who themselves also had viewed the land , rent their garments ,
DRA	Numbers	14	7	And said to all the multitude of the children of Israel : The land which we have gone round is very good :
DRA	Numbers	14	8	If the Lord be favourable , he will bring us into it , and give us a land flowing with milk and honey .
DRA	Numbers	14	9	Be not rebellious against the Lord : and fear ye not the people of this land , for we are able to eat them up as bread . All aid is gone from them : the Lord is with us , fear ye not .
DRA	Numbers	14	10	And when all the multitude cried out , and would have stoned them , the glory of the Lord appeared over the tabernacle of the covenant to all the children of Israel .
DRA	Numbers	14	11	And the Lord said to Moses : How long will this people detract me ? how long will they not believe me for all the signs that I have wrought before them ?
DRA	Numbers	14	12	I will strike them therefore with pestilence , and will consume them : but thee I will make a ruler over a great nation , and a mightier than this is .
DRA	Numbers	14	13	And Moses said to the Lord : That the Egyptians , from the midst of whom thou hast brought forth this people ,
DRA	Numbers	14	15	May hear that thou hast killed so great a multitude as it were one man and may say :

DRA	Numbers	14	18	The Lord is patient and full of mercy , taking away iniquity and wickedness , and leaving no man clear , who visitest the sins of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation .
DRA	Numbers	14	19	Forgive , I beseech thee , the sins of this people , according to the greatness of thy mercy , as thou hast been merciful to them from their going out of Egypt unto this place .
DRA	Numbers	14	20	And the Lord said : I have forgiven according to thy word .
DRA	Numbers	14	21	As I live : and the whole earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord .
DRA	Numbers	14	22	But yet all the men that have seen my majesty , and the signs that I have done in Egypt , and in the wilderness , and have tempted me now ten times , and have not obeyed my voice ,
DRA	Numbers	14	23	Shall not see the land for which I aware to their fathers , neither shall any one of them that hath detracted me behold it .
DRA	Numbers	14	24	My servant Caleb , who being full of another spirit hath followed me , I will bring into this land which he hath gone round : and his seed shall possess it .
DRA	Numbers	14	25	For the Amalecite and the Chanaanite dwell in the valleys . To morrow remove the camp , and return into the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea .
DRA	Numbers	14	26	And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron , saying :
DRA	Numbers	14	27	How long doth this wicked multitude murmur against me ? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel .
DRA	Numbers	14	28	Say therefore to them : As I live , saith the Lord : According as you have spoken in my hearing , so will I do to you .
DRA	Numbers	14	29	In the wilderness shall your carcasses lie . All you that were numbered from twenty years old and upward , and have murmured against me ,
DRA	Numbers	14	30	Shall not enter into the land , over which I lifted up my bend to make you dwell therein , except Caleb the son of Jephone , and Josue the son of Nun .
DRA	Numbers	14	31	But your children , of whom you said , that they should be a prey to the enemies , will I bring in : that they may see the land which you have despised .
DRA	Numbers	14	32	Your carcasses shall lie in the wilderness .
DRA	Numbers	14	33	Your children shall wander in the desert forty years , and shall bear your fornication , until the carcasses of their fathers be consumed ill the desert ,
DRA	Numbers	14	34	According to the number of the forty days , wherein you viewed the land : year shall be counted for a day . And forty years you shall receive your iniquities , and shall know my revenge :
DRA	Numbers	14	35	For as I have spoken , so will I do to all this wicked multitude , that hath risen up together against me : in this wilderness shall it faint away and die .
DRA	Numbers	14	36	Therefore all the men , whom Moses had sent to view the land , and who at their return had made the whole multitude to murmur against him , speaking ill of the land that it was naught ,
DRA	Numbers	14	37	Died and were struck in the sight of the Lord .
DRA	Numbers	14	38	But Josue the son of Nun , and Caleb the son of Jephone lived , of all them that had gone to view the land .
DRA	Numbers	14	39	And Moses spoke all these words to all the children of Israel , and the people mourned exceedingly .
DRA	Numbers	14	40	And behold rising up very early in the morning , they went up to the top of the mountain , and said : We are ready to go up to the place , of which the Lord hath spoken : for we have sinned .
DRA	Numbers	14	41	And Moses said to them : Why transgress you the word of the Lord , which shall not succeed prosperously with you ?
DRA	Numbers	14	42	Go not up , for the Lord is not with you : lest you fall before your enemies .

DRA	Numbers	15	6	And for every ram there shall be a sacrifice of hour of two tenths , which shall be tempered with the third part of a hin of oil :
DRA	Numbers	15	7	And he shall offer the third part of the same measure of wine for the libation , for a sweet savour to the Lord .
DRA	Numbers	15	8	But when thou offerest a holocaust or sacrifice of oxen , to fulfill thy vow or for victims of peace offerings ,
DRA	Numbers	15	9	Thou shalt give for every ox three tenths of flour tempered with half a hin of oil ,
DRA	Numbers	15	10	And wine for libations of the same measure , for an offering of most sweet savour to the Lord .
DRA	Numbers	15	11	Thus shalt thou do
DRA	Numbers	15	12	For every ox and ram and lamb and kid .
DRA	Numbers	15	13	Both they that are born in the land , and the strangers
DRA	Numbers	15	14	Shall offer sacrifices after the same rite .
DRA	Numbers	15	16	And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
DRA	Numbers	15	17	Speak to the children of Israel , and thou shalt say to them :
DRA	Numbers	15	18	When you are come into the land which I will give you ,
DRA	Numbers	15	19	And shall eat of the bread of that country , you shall separate firstfruits to the Lord ,
DRA	Numbers	15	20	Of the things you eat . As you separate firstfruits of your barnfloors :
DRA	Numbers	15	21	So also shall you give firstfruits of your dough to the Lord .
DRA	Numbers	15	22	And if through ignorance you omit any of these things , which the Lord hath spoken to Moses ,
DRA	Numbers	15	23	And by him hath commanded you , from the day that he began to command and thenceforward ,
DRA	Numbers	15	24	And the multitude have forgotten to do it : they shall offer a calf out of the herd , a holocaust for a most sweet savour to the Lord , and the sacrifice and libations thereof , as the ceremonies require , and a buck goat for sin :
DRA	Numbers	15	25	And the priest shall pray for all the multitude of the children of Israel : and it shall be forgiven them , because they sinned ignorantly , offering notwithstanding a burnt offering to the Lord for themselves and for their sin and their ignorance :
DRA	Numbers	15	26	And it shall be forgiven all the people of the children of Israel : and the strangers that sojourn among them : because it is the fault of all the people through ignorance .
DRA	Numbers	15	27	But if one soul shall sin ignorantly , he shall offer a she goat of a year old for his sin .
DRA	Numbers	15	28	And the priest shall pray for him , because he sinned ignorantly before the Lord : and he shall obtain his pardon , and it shall be forgiven him .
DRA	Numbers	15	29	The same law shall be for all that sin by ignorance , whether they be natives or strangers .
DRA	Numbers	15	30	But the soul that committeth any thing through pride , whether he be born in the land or a stranger ( because he hath been rebellious against the Lord ) shall be cut off from among his people :
DRA	Numbers	15	31	For he hath contemned the word the Lord , and made void his precept : therefore shall he be destroyed , and shall bear his iniquity .
DRA	Numbers	15	32	And it came to pass , when the children of Israel were in the wilderness , and had found a man gathering sticks on the sabbath day ,
DRA	Numbers	15	33	That they brought him to Moses and Aaron and the whole multitude .
DRA	Numbers	15	34	And they put him into prison , not knowing what they should do with him .
DRA	Numbers	15	35	And the Lord said to Moses : Let that man die , let all the multitude stone him without the camp .
DRA	Numbers	15	36	And when they had brought him out , they stoned him , and he died as the Lord had commanded .
DRA	Numbers	15	37	The Lord also said to Moses :
DRA	Numbers	15	38	Speak to the children of Israel , and thou shalt tell them I to make to themselves fringes in the corners of their garments , putting in them ribands of blue :
DRA	Numbers	15	39	That when they shall see them , they may remember all the commandments of the Lord , and not follow their own thoughts and eyes going astray after divers things ,
DRA	Numbers	15	40	But rather being mindful of the precepts of the Lord , may do them and be holy to their God .

DRA	Numbers	16	2	Rose up against Moses , and with them two hundred and fifty others of the children of Israel , leading men of the synagogue , and who in the time of assembly were called by name .
DRA	Numbers	16	3	And when they had stood up against Moses and Aaron , they said : Let it be enough for you , that all the multitude consisteth of holy ones , and the Lord is among them : Why lift you up yourselves above the people of the Lord ?
DRA	Numbers	16	4	When Moses heard this , he fell flat on his face :
DRA	Numbers	16	5	And speaking to Core and all the multitude , he said : In the morning the Lord will make known who belong to him , and the holy he will join to himself : and whom he shall choose , they shall approach to him .
DRA	Numbers	16	6	Do this therefore : Take every man of you your censers , thou Core , and all thy company .
DRA	Numbers	16	7	And putting fire in them to morrow , put incense upon it before the Lord : and whomsoever he shall choose , the same shall be holy : you take too much upon you , ye sons of Levi .
DRA	Numbers	16	8	And he said again to Core : Hear ye sons of Levi .
DRA	Numbers	16	9	Is it a small thing unto you , that the God of Israel hath spared you from all the people , and joined you to himself , that you should serve him in the service of the tabernacle , and should stand before the congregation of the people , and should minister to him ?
DRA	Numbers	16	10	Did he therefore make thee and all thy brethren the sons of Levi to approach unto him , that you should challenge to yourselves the priesthood also ,
DRA	Numbers	16	11	And that all thy company should stand against the Lord ? for what is Aaron that you murmur against him ?
DRA	Numbers	16	12	Then Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiron the sons of Eliab . But they answered : We will not come .
DRA	Numbers	16	13	Is it a small matter to thee , that thou hast brought us out of a land that flowed with milk and honey , to kill us in the desert , except thou rule also like a lord over us ?
DRA	Numbers	16	14	Thou hast brought us indeed into a land that floweth with rivers of milk and honey , and hast given us possessions of fields and vineyards ; wilt thou also pull out our eyes ? We will not come .
DRA	Numbers	16	15	Moses therefore being very angry , said to the Lord : Respect not their sacrifices : thou knowest that I have not taken of them so much as a young ass at any time , nor have injured any of them .
DRA	Numbers	16	17	Take every one of you censers , and put incense upon them , offering to the Lord two hundred and fifty censers : let Aaron also hold his censer .
DRA	Numbers	16	18	When they had done this , Moses and Aaron standing ,
DRA	Numbers	16	19	And had drawn up all the multitude against them to the door of the tabernacle , the glory of the Lord appeared to them all .
DRA	Numbers	16	20	And the Lord speaking to Moses and Aaron , said :
DRA	Numbers	16	21	Separate yourselves from among this congregation , that I may presently destroy them .
DRA	Numbers	16	22	They fell flat on their face , and said : O most mighty , the God of the spirits of all flesh , for one man 's sin shall thy wrath rage against all ?
DRA	Numbers	16	23	And the Lord said to Moses :
DRA	Numbers	16	24	Command the whole people to separate themselves from the tents of Core and Dathan and Abiron .
DRA	Numbers	16	25	And Moses arose , and went to Dathan and Abiron : and the ancients of Israel following him ,
DRA	Numbers	16	26	He said to the multitude : Depart from the tents of these wicked men , and touch nothing of theirs , lest you be involved in their sins .
DRA	Numbers	16	27	And when they were departed from their tents round about , Dathan and Abiron coming out stood in the entry of their pavilions with their wives and children , and all the people .
DRA	Numbers	16	28	And Moses said : By this you shall know that the Lord hath sent me to do all things that you see , and that I have not forged them of my own head :
DRA	Numbers	16	29	If these men die the common death of men , and if they be visited with a plague , wherewith others also are wont to be visited , the Lord did not send me .
DRA	Numbers	16	30	But if the Lord do a new thing , and the earth opening her mouth swallow them down , and all things that belong to them , and they go down alive into hell , you shall know that they have blasphemed the Lord .
DRA	Numbers	16	31	And immediately as he had made an end of speaking , the earth broke asunder under their feet :
DRA	Numbers	16	32	And opening her mouth , devoured them with their tents and all their substance .
DRA	Numbers	16	33	And they went down alive into hell the ground closing upon them , and they perished from among the people .
DRA	Numbers	16	34	But all Israel , that was standing round about , fled at the cry of them that were perishing : saying : Lest perhaps the earth swallow us up also .
DRA	Numbers	16	35	And a fire coming out from the Lord , destroyed the two hundred and fifty men that offered the incense .
DRA	Numbers	16	36	And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
DRA	Numbers	16	37	Command Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest to take up the censers that lie in the burning , and to scatter the fire of one side and the other : because they are sanctified
DRA	Numbers	16	38	In the deaths of the sinners : and let him beat them into plates , and fasten them to the altar , because incense hath been offered in them to the Lord , and they are sanctified , that the children of Israel may see them for a sign and a memorial .
DRA	Numbers	16	39	Then Eleazar the priest took the brazen censers , wherein they had offered , whom the burning fire had devoured , and beat them into plates , fastening them to the altar :
DRA	Numbers	16	40	That the children of Israel might have for the time to come wherewith they should be admonished , that no stranger or any one that is not of seed of Aaron should come near to offer incense to the Lord , lest he should suffer as Core suffered , and all his congregation , according as the Lord spoke to Moses .
DRA	Numbers	16	41	The following day all the multitude of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron , saying : You have killed the people of the Lord .
DRA	Numbers	16	42	And when there arose a sedition , and the tumult increased ,
DRA	Numbers	16	43	Moses and Aaron fled to the tabernacle of the covenant . And when the were gone into it , the cloud covered it , and the glory of the Lord appeared .
DRA	Numbers	16	44	And the Lord said to Moses :
DRA	Numbers	16	45	Get you out from the midst of this multitude , this moment will I destroy them . And as they were lying on the ground ,
DRA	Numbers	16	46	Moses said to Aaron : Take the censer , and putting fire in it from the altar , put incense upon it , and go quickly to the people to pray for them : for already wrath is gone out from the Lord , and the plague rageth .
DRA	Numbers	16	47	When Aaron had done this , and had run to the midst of the multitude which the burning fire was now destroying , he offered the incense :
DRA	Numbers	16	48	And standing between the dead and the living , he prayed for the people , and the plague ceased .
DRA	Numbers	16	49	And the number of them that were slain was fourteen thousand and seven hundred men , besides them that had perished in the sedition of Core .

DRA	Numbers	17	3	And the name of Aaron shall be for the tribe of Levi , and one rod shall contain all their families :
DRA	Numbers	17	4	And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the covenant before the testimony , where I will speak to thee .
DRA	Numbers	17	5	Whomsoever of these I shall choose , his rod shall blossom : and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel , wherewith they murmur against you .
DRA	Numbers	17	6	And Moses spoke to the children of Israel : and all the princes gave him rods one for every tribe : and there were twelve rods besides the rod of Aaron .
DRA	Numbers	17	7	And when Moses had laid them up before the Lord in the tabernacle of the testimony :
DRA	Numbers	17	8	He returned on the following day , and found that the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi , was budded : and that the buds swelling it had bloomed blossoms , which spreading the leaves , were formed into almonds .
DRA	Numbers	17	9	Moses therefore brought out all the rods from before the Lord to all the children of Israel : and they saw , and every one received their rods .
DRA	Numbers	17	10	And the Lord said to Moses : Carry back the rod of Aaron into the tabernacle of the testimony , that it may be kept there for a token of the rebellious children of Israel , and that their complaints may cease from me lest they die .
DRA	Numbers	17	11	And Moses did as the Lord had commanded .
DRA	Numbers	17	12	And the children of Israel said to Moses : Behold we are consumed , we all perish .

DRA	Numbers	18	2	And take with thee thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi , and the sceptre of thy father , and let them be ready in hand , and minister to thee : but thou and thy sons shall minister in the tabernacle of the testimony .
DRA	Numbers	18	3	And the Levites shall watch to do thy commands , and about all the works of the tabernacle : only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary nor the altar , lest both they die , and you also perish with them .
DRA	Numbers	18	4	But let them be with thee , and watch in the charge of the tabernacle , and in all the ceremonies thereof . A stranger shall not join himself with you .
DRA	Numbers	18	5	Watch ye in the charge of the sanctuary , and in the ministry of the altar : lest indignation rise upon the children of Israel .

DRA	Numbers	20	2	And the people wanting water , came together against Moses and Aaron :

DRA	Numbers	20	4	Why have you brought out the church of the Lord into the wilderness , that both we and our cattle should die ?
DRA	Numbers	20	5	Why have you made us come up out of Egypt , and have brought us into this wretched place which can not be sowed , nor bringeth forth figs , nor vines , nor pomegranates , neither is there any water to drink ?

And the glory of the Lord appeared over them .
DRA	Numbers	20	7	And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
DRA	Numbers	20	8	Take the rod , and assemble the people together , thou and Aaron thy brother , and speak to the rock before them , and it shall yield waters . And when thou hast brought forth water out of the rock , all the multitude and their cattle shall drink .

DRA	Numbers	20	11	And when Moses had lifted up his hand , and struck the rock twice with the rod , there came forth water in great abundance , so that the people and their cattle drank ,
DRA	Numbers	20	12	And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron : Because you have not believed me , to sanctify me before the children of Israel , you shall not bring these people into the land , which I will give them .
DRA	Numbers	20	13	This is the Water of contradiction , where the children of Israel strove with words against the Lord , and he was sanctified in them .

DRA	Numbers	20	15	In what manner our fathers went down into Egypt , and there we dwelt a long time , and the Egyptians afflicted us and our fathers .
DRA	Numbers	20	16	And how we cried to the Lord , and he heard us , and sent an angel , who hath brought us out of Egypt . Lo , we are now in the city of Cades , which is in the uttermost of thy borders ,
DRA	Numbers	20	17	And we beseech thee that we may have leave to pass through thy country . We will not go through the fields , nor through the vineyards , we will not drink the waters of thy wells , but we will go by the common highway , neither turning aside to the right hand , nor to the left , till we are past thy borders .
DRA	Numbers	20	18	And Edom answered them : Thou shalt not pass by me : if thou dost I will come out armed against thee .
DRA	Numbers	20	19	And the children of Israel said : We will go by the beaten way : and if we and our cattle drink of thy waters , we will give thee what is just : there shall be no difficulty in the price , only let us pass speedily .

DRA	Numbers	21	4	And they marched from mount Hor , by the way that leadeth to the Red Sea , to compass the land of Edom . And the people began to be weary of their journey and labour :
DRA	Numbers	21	5	And speaking against God and Moses , they said : Why didst thou bring us out of Egypt , to die in the wilderness ? There is no bread , nor have we any waters : our soul now loatheth this very light food .
DRA	Numbers	21	6	Wherefore the Lord sent among the people fiery serpents , which bit them and killed many of them .
DRA	Numbers	21	7	Upon which they came to Moses , and said : We have sinned , because we have spoken against the Lord and thee : pray that he may take away these serpents from us . And Moses prayed for the people .
DRA	Numbers	21	8	And the Lord said to him : Make brazen serpent , and set it up for a sign : whosoever being struck shall look on it , shall live .
DRA	Numbers	21	9	Moses therefore made a brazen serpent , and set it up for a sign : which when they that were bitten looked upon , they were healed .

DRA	Numbers	21	11	And departing thence they pitched their tents in Jeabarim , in the wilderness , that faceth Moab toward the east .
DRA	Numbers	21	12	And removing from thence , they came to the torrent Zared :
DRA	Numbers	21	13	Which they left and encamped over against Arnon , which is in the desert and standeth out on the borders of the Amorrhite . For Arnon is the border of Moab , dividing the Moabites and the Amorrhites .
DRA	Numbers	21	14	Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the Lord : As he did in the Red Sea , so will he do in the streams of Amen .
DRA	Numbers	21	15	The rocks of the torrents were bowed down that they might rest in Ar , and lie down in the borders of the Moabites .
DRA	Numbers	21	16	When they went from that place , the well appeared whereof the Lord said to Moses : Gather the people together , and I will give them water .
DRA	Numbers	21	17	Then Israel sung this song : Let the well spring up . They sung thereto :
DRA	Numbers	21	18	The well , which the princes dug , and the chiefs of the people prepared by the direction of the lawgiver , and with their staves . And they marched from the wilderness to Mathana .
DRA	Numbers	21	19	From Mathana unto Nahaliel : from Nahaliel unto Bamoth .
DRA	Numbers	21	20	From Bamoth , is a valley in the country of Moab , to the top of Phasga , which looked towards the desert .
DRA	Numbers	21	22	I beseech thee that I may have leave to pass through thy land : we will not go aside into the fields or the vineyards , we will not drink waters of the wells , we will go the king 's highway , till we be past thy borders .
DRA	Numbers	21	23	And he would not grant that Israel should pass by his borders : but rather gathering an army , went forth to meet them in the desert , and came to Jasa , and fought against them .
DRA	Numbers	21	24	And he was slain by them with the edge of the sword , and they possessed his land from the Arnon unto the Jeboc , and to the confines of the children of Ammon : for the borders of the Ammonites , were kept with a strong garrison .
DRA	Numbers	21	25	So Israel took all his cities , and dwelt in the cities of the Amorrhite , to wit , in Hesebon , and in the villages thereof .
DRA	Numbers	21	26	Hesebon was the city of Sehon the king of the Amorrhites , who fought against the king of Moab : and took all the land , that had been of his dominions , as far as the Arnon .
DRA	Numbers	21	27	Therefore it is said in the proverb : Come into Hesebon , let the city of Sehon be built and set up :
DRA	Numbers	21	28	A fire is gone out of Hesebon , a flame from the city of Sehon , and hath consumed Ar of the Moabites , and the inhabitants of the high places of the Arnon .
DRA	Numbers	21	29	Woe to thee Moab : thou art undone , O people of Chamos . He hath given his sons to flight , and his daughters into captivity to Sehon the king of the Amorrhites .
DRA	Numbers	21	30	Their yoke is perished from Hesebon unto Dibon , they came weary to Nophe , and unto Medaba .
DRA	Numbers	21	31	So Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorrhite .
DRA	Numbers	21	32	And Moses sent some to take a view of Jazer : and they took the villages of it , and conquered the inhabitants .
DRA	Numbers	21	33	And they turned themselves , and went up by the way of Basan , and Og the king of Basan came against them with all his people , to fight in Edrai .
DRA	Numbers	21	34	And the Lord said to Moses : Fear him not , for I have delivered him and all his people , and his country into thy hand : and thou shalt do to him as thou didst to Sehon the king of the Amorrhites , the inhabitant of Hesebon .
DRA	Numbers	21	35	So they slew him also with his sons , and all his people , not letting any one escape , and they possessed his land . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Numbers	22	22	And God was angry . And an angel of the Lord stood in the way against Balaam , who sat on the ass , and had two servants with him .
DRA	Numbers	22	1899	American Edition
DRA	Numbers	22	2	And Balac the son of Sephor , seeing all that Israel had done to the Amorrhite ,
DRA	Numbers	22	3	And that the Moabites were in great fear of him , and were not able to sustain his assault ,
DRA	Numbers	22	4	He said to the elders of Madian : So will this people destroy all that dwell in our borders , as the ox is wont to eat the grass to the very roots . Now he was at that time king in Moab .
DRA	Numbers	22	5	He sent therefore messengers to Balaam the son of Beer , a soothsayer , who dwelt by the river of the land of the children of Ammon , to call him , and to say : Behold a people is come out of Egypt , that hath covered the face of the earth , sitting over against me .
DRA	Numbers	22	6	Come therefore , and curse this people , because it is mightier than I : if by any means I may beat them and drive them out of my land : for I know that he whom thou shalt bless is blessed , and he whom thou shalt curse is cursed .
DRA	Numbers	22	7	And the ancients of Moab , and the elders of Madian , went with the price of divination in their hands . And when they were come to Balaam , and had told him all the words of Balac :
DRA	Numbers	22	8	He answered : Tarry here this night , and I will answer whatsoever the Lord shall say to me . And while they stayed with Balaam , God came and said to him :
DRA	Numbers	22	9	What mean these men that are with thee ?
DRA	Numbers	22	10	He answered : Balac the son of Sephor king of the Moabites hath sent to me ,
DRA	Numbers	22	11	Saying : Behold a people that is come out of Egypt , hath covered the face of the land : come and curse them , if by any means I may fight with them and drive them away .
DRA	Numbers	22	12	And God said to Balaam : Thou shalt not go with them , nor shalt thou curse the people : because it is blessed .
DRA	Numbers	22	13	And he rose in the morning and said to the princes : Go into your country , because the Lord hath forbid me to come with you .
DRA	Numbers	22	14	The princes returning , said to Balac : Balaam would not come with us .
DRA	Numbers	22	15	Then he sent many more and more noble than he had sent before :
DRA	Numbers	22	16	Who , when they were come to Balaam , said : Thus saith Balac the son of Sephor , Delay not to come to me :
DRA	Numbers	22	17	For I am ready to honour thee , and will give thee whatsoever thou wilt : come and curse this people .
DRA	Numbers	22	18	Balaam answered : If Balac would give me his house full of silver and gold , I can not alter the word of the Lord my God , to speak either more or less .
DRA	Numbers	22	19	I pray you to stay here this night also , that I may know what the Lord will answer me once more .
DRA	Numbers	22	20	God therefore came to Balaam in the night , and said to him : It these men be come to call thee , arise and go with them : yet so , that thou do what I shall command thee .
DRA	Numbers	22	21	Balaam arose in the morning , and saddling his ass went with them .
DRA	Numbers	22	23	The ass seeing the angel standing in the way , with a drawn sword , turned herself out of the way , and went into the field . And when Balaam beat her , and had a mind to bring her again to the way ,
DRA	Numbers	22	24	The angel stood in a narrow place between two walls , wherewith the vineyards were enclosed .
DRA	Numbers	22	25	And the ass seeing him , thrust herself close to the wall , and bruised the foot of the rider . But he beat her again :
DRA	Numbers	22	26	And nevertheless the angel going on to a narrow place , where there was no way to turn aside either to the right hand or to the left , stood to meet him .
DRA	Numbers	22	27	And when the ass saw the angel standing , she fell under the feet of the rider : who being angry beat her sides more vehemently with a staff .
DRA	Numbers	22	28	And the Lord opened the mouth of the ass , and she said : What have I done to thee ? Why strikest thou me , lo , now this third time ?
DRA	Numbers	22	29	Balaam answered : Because thou hast deserved it , and hast served me ill : I would I had a sword that I might kill thee .
DRA	Numbers	22	30	The ass said : Am not I thy beast , on which thou hast been always accustomed to ride until this present day ? tell me if I ever did the like thing to thee . But he said : Never .
DRA	Numbers	22	31	Forthwith the Lord opened the eyes of Balaam , and he saw the angel standing in the way with a drawn sword , and he worshipped him falling flat on the ground .
DRA	Numbers	22	32	And the angel said to him : Why beatest thou thy ass these three times ? I am come to withstand thee , because thy way is perverse , and contrary to me :
DRA	Numbers	22	33	And unless the ass had turned out of the way , giving place to me who stood against thee , I had slain thee , and she should have lived .
DRA	Numbers	22	34	Balaam said : I have sinned , not knowing that thou didst stand against me : and now if it displease thee that I go , I will return .
DRA	Numbers	22	35	The angel said : Go with these men , and see thou speak no other thing than what I shall command thee . He went therefore with the princes .
DRA	Numbers	22	36	And when Balac heard it he came forth to meet him in a town of the Moabites , that is situate in the uttermost borders of Arnon .
DRA	Numbers	22	37	And he said to Balaam : I sent messengers to call thee , why didst thou not come immediately to me ? was it because I am not able to reward thy coming ?
DRA	Numbers	22	38	He answered him : Lo , here I am : shall I have power to speak any other thing but that which God shall put in my mouth ?
DRA	Numbers	22	39	So they went on together , and came into a city , that was in the uttermost borders of his kingdom .
DRA	Numbers	22	40	And when Balac had killed oxen and sheep , he sent presents to Balaam , and to the princes that were with him .
DRA	Numbers	22	41	And when morning was come , he brought him to the high places of Baal , and he beheld the uttermost part of the people . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )

DRA	Numbers	23	2	And when he had done according to the word of Balaam , they laid together a calf and a ram upon every altar .
DRA	Numbers	23	3	And Balaam said to Balac : Stand a while by thy burnt offering , until I go , to see if perhaps the Lord will meet me , and whatsoever he shall command , I will speak to thee .
DRA	Numbers	23	4	And when he was gone with speed , God met him . And Balaam speaking to him , said : I have erected seven altars , and have laid on everyone a calf and a ram .
DRA	Numbers	23	5	And the Lord put the word in his mouth , and said : Return to Balac , and thus shalt thou speak .
DRA	Numbers	23	6	Returning he found Balac standing by his burnt offering , with all the princes of the Moabites :
DRA	Numbers	23	7	And taking up his parable , he said : Balac king of the Moabites hath brought me from Aram , from the mountains of the east : Come , said he , and curse Jacob : make haste and detest Israel .
DRA	Numbers	23	8	How shall I curse him , whom God hath not cursed ? By what means should I detest him , whom the Lord detesteth not ?
DRA	Numbers	23	9	I shall see him from the tops of the rocks , and shall consider him from the hills . This people shall dwell alone , and shall not be reckoned among the nations .
DRA	Numbers	23	10	Who can count the dust of Jacob , and know the number of the stock of Israel ? Let my soul die the death of the just , and my last end be like to them .
DRA	Numbers	23	11	And Balac said to Balaam : What is this that thou dost ? I sent for thee to curse my enemies : and thou contrariwise blessest them .
DRA	Numbers	23	12	He answered him : Call I speak any thing else but what the Lord commandeth ?
DRA	Numbers	23	13	Balac therefore said : Come with me to another place from whence thou mayest see part of Israel , and canst not see them all : curse them from thence .
DRA	Numbers	23	14	And when he had brought him to a high place , upon the top of mount Phasga , Balaam built seven altars , and laying on every one a calf and a ram ,
DRA	Numbers	23	15	He said to Balac : Stand here by thy burnt offering while I go to meet him .
DRA	Numbers	23	16	And when the Lord had met him , and had put the word in his mouth , he said : Return to Balac , and thus shalt thou say to him .
DRA	Numbers	23	17	Returning he found him standing by his burnt sacrifice , and the princes of the Moabites with him . And Balac said to him : What hath the Lord spoken ?
DRA	Numbers	23	18	But he taking up his parable , said : Stand , O Balac , and give ear : hear , thou son of Sephor :
DRA	Numbers	23	19	God is not a man , that he should lie , nor as the son of man , that he should be changed . Hath he said then , and will he not do ? hath he spoken , and will he not fulfill ?
DRA	Numbers	23	20	I was brought to bless , the blessing I am not able to hinder .
DRA	Numbers	23	21	There is no idol in Jacob , neither is there an image god to be seen in Israel . The Lord his God is with him , and the sound of the victory of the king in him .

DRA	Numbers	23	24	Behold the people shall rise up as a lioness , and shall lift itself up as a lion : it shall not lie down till it devour the prey , and drink the blood of the slain .
DRA	Numbers	23	25	And Balac said to Balaam : Neither curse , nor bless him .
DRA	Numbers	23	26	And he said : Did I not tell thee , that whatsoever God should command me , that I would do ?
DRA	Numbers	23	27	And Balac said to him : Come and I will bring thee to another place ; if peradventure it please God that thou mayest curse them from thence .
DRA	Numbers	23	28	And when he had brought him upon the top of mount Phogor , which looketh towards the wilderness ,
DRA	Numbers	23	29	Balaam said to him : Build me here seven altars , and prepare as many calves , and the same number of rams .

DRA	Numbers	24	3	He took up his parable and said : Balaam the son of Beor hath said : The man hath said , whose eye ire stopped up :
DRA	Numbers	24	4	The hearer of the words of God hath said , he that hath beheld the vision of the Almighty , he that falleth , and so his eyes are opened :
DRA	Numbers	24	5	How beautiful are thy tabernacles , O Jacob , and thy tents , O Israel !

DRA	Numbers	24	10	And Balac being angry against Balaam , clapped his hands together and said : I called thee to curse my enemies , and thou on the contrary hast blessed them three times .
DRA	Numbers	24	11	Return to thy place . I had determined indeed greatly to honour thee , but the Lord hath deprived thee of the honour designed for thee .
DRA	Numbers	24	12	Balaam made answer to Balac : Did I not say to thy messengers , whom thou sentest to me :
DRA	Numbers	24	13	If Balac would give me his house full of silver and gold , I can not go beyond the word of the Lord my God , to utter any thing of my own head either good or evil : but whatsoever the Lord shall say , that I will speak ?
DRA	Numbers	24	14	But yet going to my people , I will give thee counsel , what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days .
DRA	Numbers	24	15	Therefore taking up his parable , again he said : Balaam the son of Beor hath said : The man whose eye is stopped up , hath said :
DRA	Numbers	24	16	The hearer of the words of God hath said , who knoweth the doctrine of the Highest , and seeth the visions of the Almighty , who falling hath his eyes opened :
DRA	Numbers	24	17	I shall see him , but not now : I shall behold him , but not near . A STAR SHALL RISE out of Jacob and a sceptre shall spring up from Israel : and shall strike the chiefs of Moab , and shall waste all the children of Seth .

DRA	Numbers	24	23	And taking up his parable , again he said : Alas , who shall live when God shall do these things ?

DRA	Numbers	25	10	And the Lord said to Moses :
DRA	Numbers	25	11	Phinees the son of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest , hath turned away my wrath from the children of Israel : because he was moved with my zeal against them , that I myself might not destroy the children of Israel in my zeal .
DRA	Numbers	25	12	Therefore say to him : Behold I give him the peace of my covenant ,

DRA	Numbers	27	2	And they stood before Moses and Eleazar the priest , and all the princes of the people at the door of the tabernacle of the covenant , and said :
DRA	Numbers	27	3	Our father died in the desert , and was not in the sedition , that was raised against the Lord under Core , but he died in his own sin : and he had no male children . Why is his name taken away out of his family , because he had no son ? Give us a possession among the kinsmen of our father .
DRA	Numbers	27	4	And Moses referred their cause to the judgment of the Lord .
DRA	Numbers	27	5	And the Lord said to him :
DRA	Numbers	27	6	The daughters of Salphaad demand a just thing : Give them a possession among their father 's kindred , and let them succeed him in his inheritance .
DRA	Numbers	27	7	And to the children of Israel thou shalt speak these things :
DRA	Numbers	27	8	When a man dieth without a son , his inheritance shall pass to his daughter .
DRA	Numbers	27	9	If he have no daughter , his brethren shall succeed him .
DRA	Numbers	27	10	And if he have no brethren , you shall give the inheritance to his father 's brethren .
DRA	Numbers	27	11	But if he have no uncles by the father , the inheritance shall be given to them that are the next akin . And this shall be to the children of Israel sacred by a perpetual law , as the Lord hath commanded Moses .

DRA	Numbers	27	13	And when thou shalt have seen it , thou also shalt go to thy people , as thy brother Aaron is gone :
DRA	Numbers	27	14	Because you offended me in the desert of Sin in the contradiction of the multitude , neither would you sanctify me before them at the waters . These are the waters of contradiction in Cades of the desert of Sin .
DRA	Numbers	27	15	And Moses answered him :
DRA	Numbers	27	16	May the Lord the God of the spirits of all flesh provide a man , that may be over this multitude :
DRA	Numbers	27	17	And may go out and in before them , and may lead them out , or bring them in : lest the people of the Lord be as sheep without a shepherd .

DRA	Numbers	30	30	And Moses told the children of Israel all that the Lord had commanded him :
DRA	Numbers	30	1899	American Edition
DRA	Numbers	30	2	And he said to the princes of the tribes of the children of Israel : This is the word that the Lord hath commanded :
DRA	Numbers	30	3	If any man make a vow to the Lord , or bind himself by an oath : he shall not make his word void but shall fulfill all that he promised .
DRA	Numbers	30	4	If a woman vow any thing , and bind herself by an oath , being in her father 's house , and but yet a girl in age : if her father knew the vow that she hath promised , and the oath wherewith she hath bound her soul , and held his peace , she shall be bound by the vow :
DRA	Numbers	30	5	Whatsoever she promised and swore , she shall fulfill in deed .
DRA	Numbers	30	6	But if her father , immediately as soon as he heard it , gainsaid it , both her vows and her oaths shall be void , neither shall she be bound to what she promised , because her father hath gainsaid it .
DRA	Numbers	30	7	If she have a husband , and shall vow any thing , and the word once going out of her mouth shall bind her soul by an oath :
DRA	Numbers	30	8	The day that her husband shall hear it , and not gainsay it , she shall be bound to the vow , and shall give whatsoever she promised .
DRA	Numbers	30	9	But if as soon as he heareth he gainsay it , and make her promises and the words wherewith she had bound her soul of no effect : the Lord will forgive her .
DRA	Numbers	30	10	The widow , and she that is divorced , shall fulfill whatsoever they vow .
DRA	Numbers	30	11	If the wife in the house of her husband , hath bound herself by vow and by oath ,
DRA	Numbers	30	12	If her husband hear , and hold his peace , and doth not disallow the promise , she shall accomplish whatsoever she had promised .
DRA	Numbers	30	13	But if forthwith he gainsay it , she shall not be bound by the promise : because her husband gainsaid it , and the Lord will be merciful to her .
DRA	Numbers	30	14	If she vow and bind herself by oath , to afflict her soul by fasting , or abstinence from other things , it shall depend on the will of her husband , whether she shall do it , or not do it .
DRA	Numbers	30	15	But if the husband hearing it hold his peace , and defer the declaring his mind till another day : whatsoever she had vowed and promised , she shall fulfill : because immediately as he heard it , he held his peace .
DRA	Numbers	30	16	But if he gainsay it after that he knew it , he shall bear her iniquity .
DRA	Numbers	30	17	These are the laws which the Lord appointed to Moses between the husband and the wife , between the father and the daughter that is as yet but a girl in age , or that abideth in her father 's house . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )

DRA	Numbers	31	8	And their kings Evi , and Recem , and Sur , and Hur , and Rebe , five princes of the nation : Balaam also the son of Beer they killed with the sword .
DRA	Numbers	31	9	And they took their women , and their children captives , and all their cattle , and all their goods : and all their possessions they plundered :
DRA	Numbers	31	10	And all their cities , and their villages , and castles , they burned .

DRA	Numbers	31	15	Said : Why have you saved the women ?
DRA	Numbers	31	16	Are not these they , that deceived the children of Israel by the counsel of Balaam , and made you transgress against the Lord by the sin of Phogor , for which also the people was punished ?
DRA	Numbers	31	17	Therefore kill all that are of the male sex , even of the children : and put to death the women , that have carnally known men .
DRA	Numbers	31	18	But the girls , and all the women that are virgins save for yourselves :

DRA	Numbers	31	22	Gold , and silver , and brass , and iron , and lend , and tin ,
DRA	Numbers	31	23	And all that may pass through the fire , shall be purified by fire , but whatsoever can not abide the fire , shall be sanctified with the water of expiation :
DRA	Numbers	31	24	And you shall wash your garments the seventh day , and being purified , you shall afterwards enter into the camp .
DRA	Numbers	31	25	And the Lord said to Moses :
DRA	Numbers	31	26	Take the sum of the things that were taken both of man and beast , thou and Eleazar the priest and the princes of the multitude :
DRA	Numbers	31	27	And thou shalt divide the spoil equally , between them that fought and went out to the war , and between the rest of the multitude .
DRA	Numbers	31	28	And thou shalt separate a portion to the Lord from them that fought and were in the battle , one soul of five hundred as well of persons as of oxen and asses and sheep .
DRA	Numbers	31	29	And thou shalt give it to Eleazar the priest , because they are the firstfruits of the Lord .
DRA	Numbers	31	30	Out of the moiety also of the children of Israel thou shalt take the fiftieth head of persons , and of oxen , and asses , and sheep , and of all beasts , and thou shalt give them to the Levites that watch in the charge of the tabernacle of the Lord .

DRA	Numbers	31	33	Seventy-two thousand oxen ,
DRA	Numbers	31	34	Sixty-one thousand asses :
DRA	Numbers	31	35	And thirty-two thousand persons of the female sex , that had not known men .
DRA	Numbers	31	36	And one half was given to them that had been in the battle , to wit , three hundred thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep :

DRA	Numbers	31	38	And out of the thirty-six thousand oxen , seventy-two oxen :
DRA	Numbers	31	39	Out of the thirty thousand five hundred asses , sixty-one asses :
DRA	Numbers	31	40	Out of the sixteen thousand persons , there fell to the portion of the Lord , thirty-two souls .

DRA	Numbers	31	42	Out of the half of the children of Israel , which he had separated for them that had been in the battle .
DRA	Numbers	31	43	But out of the half that fell to the rest of the multitude , that is to say , out of the three hundred thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep ,
DRA	Numbers	31	44	And out of the thirty-six thousand oxen ,
DRA	Numbers	31	45	And out of the thirty thousand five hundred asses ,
DRA	Numbers	31	46	And out of the sixteen thousand persons ,
DRA	Numbers	31	47	Moses took the fiftieth head , and gave it to the Levites that watched in the tabernacle of the Lord , as the Lord had commanded .
DRA	Numbers	31	48	And when the commanders of the army , and the tribunes and centurions were come to Moses , they said :
DRA	Numbers	31	49	We thy servants have reckoned up the number of the fighting men , whom we had under our hand , and not so much as one was wanting .
DRA	Numbers	31	50	Therefore we offer as gifts to the Lord what gold every one of us could find in the booty , in garters and tablets , rings and bracelets , and chains , that thou mayst pray to the Lord for us .
DRA	Numbers	31	51	And Moses and Eleazar the priest received all the gold in divers kinds ,
DRA	Numbers	31	52	In weight sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty sicles , from the tribunes and from the centurions .
DRA	Numbers	31	53	For that which every one had taken in the booty was his own .

DRA	Numbers	32	4	The land , which the Lord hath conquered in the sight of the children of Israel , is a very fertile soil for the feeding of beasts : and we thy servants have very much cattle :
DRA	Numbers	32	5	And we pray thee , if we have found favour in thy sight , that thou give it to us thy servants in possession , and make us not pass over the Jordan .
DRA	Numbers	32	6	And Moses answered them : What , shall your brethren go to fight , and will you sit here ?
DRA	Numbers	32	7	Why do ye overturn the minds of the children of Israel , that they may not dare to pass into the place which the Lord hath given them ?
DRA	Numbers	32	8	Was it not thus your fathers did , when I sent from Cadesbarne to view the land ?
DRA	Numbers	32	9	And when they were come as far as the valley of the cluster , having viewed all the country , they overturned the hearts of the children of Israel , that they should not enter into the coasts , which the Lord gave them .
DRA	Numbers	32	10	And he swore in his anger , saying :
DRA	Numbers	32	11	If these men , that came up out of Egypt , from twenty years old and upward , shall see the land , which I promised with an oath to Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob : because they would not follow me ,
DRA	Numbers	32	12	Except Caleb the son of Jephone the Cenezite , and Josue the son of Nun : these have fulfilled my will .
DRA	Numbers	32	13	And the Lord being angry against Israel , led them about through the desert forty years , until the whole generation , that had done evil in his sight , was consumed .
DRA	Numbers	32	14	And behold , said he , you are risen up instead of your fathers , the increase and offspring of sinful men , to augment the fury of the Lord against Israel .
DRA	Numbers	32	15	For if you will not follow him , he will leave the people in the wilderness , and you shall be the cause of the destruction of all .
DRA	Numbers	32	16	But they coming near , said : We will make sheepfolds , and stalls for our cattle , and strong cities for our children :
DRA	Numbers	32	17	And we ourselves will go armed and ready for battle before the children of Israel , until we bring them in unto their places . Our little ones , and all we have , shall be in walled cities , for fear of the ambushes of the inhabitants .
DRA	Numbers	32	18	We will not return into our houses until the children of Israel possess their inheritance :
DRA	Numbers	32	19	Neither will we seek any thing beyond the Jordan , because we have already our possession on the east side thereof ,
DRA	Numbers	32	20	And Moses said to them : If you do what you promise , go on well appointed for war before the Lord :
DRA	Numbers	32	21	And let every fighting man pass over the Jordan , until the Lord overthrow his enemies :
DRA	Numbers	32	22	And all the land be brought under him , then shall you be blameless before the Lord and before Israel , and you shall obtain the countries that you desire , before the Lord .
DRA	Numbers	32	23	But if you do not what you say , no man can doubt but you sin against God : and know ye , that your sin shall overtake you .
DRA	Numbers	32	24	Build therefore cities for your children , and folds and stalls for your sheep and beasts , and accomplish what you have promised .

DRA	Numbers	32	27	And we thy servants all well appointed will march on to the war , as thou , my lord , speakest .
DRA	Numbers	32	28	Moses therefore commanded Eleazar the priest , and Josue the son of Nun , and the princes of the families of all the tribes of Israel , and said to them :
DRA	Numbers	32	29	If the children of Gad , and the children of Ruben pass with you over the Jordan , all armed for war before the Lord , and the land be made subject to you : give them Galaad in possession .
DRA	Numbers	32	30	But if they will not pass armed with you into the land of Chanaan , let them receive places to dwell in among you .
DRA	Numbers	32	31	And the children of Gad , and the children of Ruben answered : As the Lord hath spoken to his servants , so will we do :
DRA	Numbers	32	33	Moses therefore gave to the children of Cad and of Ruben , and to the half tribe of Manasses the son of Joseph , the kingdom of Sehon king of the Amorrhites , and the kingdom of Og king of Basan , and their land and the cities thereof round about .

DRA	Numbers	34	2	Command the children of Israel , and then shalt say to them : When you are entered into the land of Chanaan , and it shall be fallen into your possession by lot , it shall be bounded by these limits :
DRA	Numbers	34	3	The south side shall begin from the wilderness of Sin , which is by Edom : and shall have the most salt sea for its furthest limits eastward :
DRA	Numbers	34	4	Which limits shall go round on the south side by the ascent of the Scorpion and so into Senna , and reach toward the south as far as Cadesbarne , from whence the frontiers shall go out to the town called Adar , and shall reach as far as Asemona .
DRA	Numbers	34	5	And the limits shall fetch a compass from Asemona to the torrent of Egypt , and shall end in the shore of the great sea .

DRA	Numbers	35	1899	American Edition
DRA	Numbers	35	2	Command the children of Israel that they give to the Levites out of their possessions ,
DRA	Numbers	35	3	Cities to dwell in , and their suburbs round about : that they may abide in the towns , and the suburbs may be for their cattle and beasts :
DRA	Numbers	35	4	Which suburbs shall reach from the walls of the cities outward , a thousand paces on every side :
DRA	Numbers	35	5	Toward the east shall be two thousand cubits : and toward the south in like manner shall be two thousand cubits : toward the sea also , which looketh to the west , shall be the same extent : and the north side shall be bounded with the like limits . And the cities shall be in the midst , and the suburbs without .
DRA	Numbers	35	6	And among the cities , which you shall give to the Levites , six shall be separated for refuge to fugitives , that he who hath shed blood may flee to them : and besides these there shall be other forty-two cities ,
DRA	Numbers	35	7	That is , in all forty-eight with their suburbs .
DRA	Numbers	35	8	And of these cities which shall be given out of the possessions of the children of Israel , from them that have more , more shall be taken : and from them that have less , fewer . Each shall give towns to the Levites according to the extent of their inheritance .
DRA	Numbers	35	9	The Lord said to Moses :
DRA	Numbers	35	10	Speak to the children of Israel , and thou shalt say to them : When you shall have passed over the Jordan into the land of Chanaan ,
DRA	Numbers	35	11	Determine what cities shall be for the refuge of fugitives , who have shed blood against their will .
DRA	Numbers	35	12	And when the fugitive shall be in them , the kinsman of him that is slain may not have power to kill him , until he stand before the multitude , and his cause be judged .
DRA	Numbers	35	13	And of those cities , that are separated for the refuge of fugitives ,
DRA	Numbers	35	14	Three shall be beyond the Jordan , and three in the land of Chanaan ,
DRA	Numbers	35	15	As well for the children of Israel as for strangers and sojourners , that he may flee to them , who hath shed blood against his will .
DRA	Numbers	35	16	If any man strike with iron , and he die that was struck : he shall be guilty of murder , and he himself shall die .
DRA	Numbers	35	17	If he throw a stone , and he that is struck die : he shall be punished in the same manner .
DRA	Numbers	35	18	If he that is struck with wood die : he shall be revenged by the blood of him that struck him .
DRA	Numbers	35	19	The kinsman of him that was slain , shall kill the murderer : as soon as he apprehendeth him , he shall kill him .
DRA	Numbers	35	20	If through hatred any one push a man , or fling any thing at him with ill design :
DRA	Numbers	35	21	Or being his enemy , strike ; him with his hand , and he die : the striker shall be guilty of murder : the kinsman of him that was slain as soon as he findeth him , shall kill him .
DRA	Numbers	35	22	But if by chance medley , and without hatred ,
DRA	Numbers	35	23	And enmity , he do any of these things ,
DRA	Numbers	35	24	And this be proved in the hearing of the people , and the cause be debated between him that struck , and the next of kin :
DRA	Numbers	35	25	The innocent shall be delivered from the hand of the revenger , and shall be brought back by sentence into the city , to which he had fled , and he shall abide there until the death of the high priest , that is anointed with the holy oil .
DRA	Numbers	35	26	If the murderer be found without the limits of the cities that are appointed for the banished ,
DRA	Numbers	35	27	And be struck by him that is the avenger of blood : he shall not be guilty that killed him .
DRA	Numbers	35	28	For the fugitive ought to have stayed in the city until the death of the high priest : and after he is dead , then shall the manslayer return to his own country .
DRA	Numbers	35	29	These things shall be perpetual , and for an ordinance in all your dwellings .
DRA	Numbers	35	30	The murderer shall be punished by witnesses : none shall be condemned upon the evidence of one man .
DRA	Numbers	35	31	You shall not take money of him that is guilty of blood , but he shall die forthwith .
DRA	Numbers	35	32	The banished and fugitives before the death of the high priest may by no means return into their own cities .
DRA	Numbers	35	33	Defile not the land of your habitation , which is stained with the blood of the innocent : neither can it otherwise be expiated , but by his blood that hath shed the blood of another .
DRA	Numbers	35	34	And thus shall your possession he cleansed , myself abiding with you . For I am the Lord that dwell among the children of Israel . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Numbers	36	36	And the princes of the families of Galaad , the son of Machir , the son of Manasses , of the stock Of the children of Joseph , came and spoke to Moses before the princes of Israel , and said :
DRA	Numbers	36	1899	American Edition
DRA	Numbers	36	2	The Lord hath commanded thee , my lord , that thou shouldst divide the land by lot to the children of Israel , and that thou shouldst give to the daughters of Salphaad our brother the possession due to their father :
DRA	Numbers	36	3	Now if men of another tribe take them to wives , their possession will follow them , and being transferred to another tribe , will be a diminishing of our inheritance .
DRA	Numbers	36	4	And so it shall come to pass , that when the jubilee , that is , the fiftieth year of remission , is come , the distribution made by the lots shall be confounded , and the possession of the one shall pass to the others .
DRA	Numbers	36	5	Moses answered the children of Israel , and said by the command of the Lord : The tribe of the children of Joseph hath spoken rightly .
DRA	Numbers	36	6	And this is the law promulgated by the Lord touching the daughters of Salphaad : Let them marry to whom they will , only so that it be to men of their own tribe .
DRA	Numbers	36	7	Lest the possession of the children of Israel be mingled from tribe to tribe . For all men shall marry wives of their own tribe and kindred :
DRA	Numbers	36	8	And all women shall take husbands of the same tribe : that the inheritance may remain in the families ,
DRA	Numbers	36	9	And that the tribes be not mingled one with another , but remain so
DRA	Numbers	36	10	As they were separated by the Lord . And the daughters of Salphaad did as was commanded :
DRA	Numbers	36	11	And Maala , and Thersa , and Hegla , and Melcha , and Noa were married to the sons of their uncle by their father
DRA	Numbers	36	12	Of the family of Manasses , who was the son of Joseph : and the possession that had been allotted to them , remained in the tribe and family of their father .

DRA	Deuteronomy	1	1	These are the words , which Moses spoke to all Israel beyond the Jordan , in the plain wilderness , over against the Red Sea , between Pharan and Thophel and Laban and Haseroth , where there is very much gold :
DRA	Deuteronomy	1	1899	American Edition
DRA	Deuteronomy	1	2	Eleven days ' journey from Horeb by the way of Mount Seir to Cadesbarne .
DRA	Deuteronomy	1	3	In the fortieth year , the eleventh month , the first day of the month , Moses spoke to the children of Israel all that the Lord had commanded him to say to them :
DRA	Deuteronomy	1	4	After that he had slain Sehon king of the Amorrhites , who dwelt in Hesebon : and Og king of Basan who abode in Astaroth , and in Edrai ,
DRA	Deuteronomy	1	5	Beyond the Jordan in the land of Moab . And Moses began to expound the law , and to say :
DRA	Deuteronomy	1	6	The Lord our God spoke to us in Horeb , saying : You have stayed long enough in this mountain :
DRA	Deuteronomy	1	7	Turn you , and come to the mountain of the Amorrhites , and to the other places that are next to it , the plains and the hills and the vales towards the south , and by the sea shore , the land of the Chanaanites , and of Libanus , as far as the great river Euphrates .
DRA	Deuteronomy	1	8	Behold , said he , I have delivered it to you : go in and possess it , concerning which the Lord swore to your fathers Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , that he would give it to them , and to their seed after them .
DRA	Deuteronomy	1	9	And I said to you at that time :
DRA	Deuteronomy	1	10	I alone am not able to bear you : for the Lord your God hath multiplied you , and you are this day as the stars of heaven , for multitude .
DRA	Deuteronomy	1	11	( The Lord God of your fathers add to this number many thousands , and bless you as he hath spoken . )
DRA	Deuteronomy	1	12	I alone am not able to bear your business , and the charge of you and your differences .
DRA	Deuteronomy	1	13	Let me have from among you wise and understanding men , and such whose conversation is approved among your tribes , that I may appoint them your rulers .
DRA	Deuteronomy	1	14	Then you answered me : The thing is good which thou meanest to do .
DRA	Deuteronomy	1	15	And I took out of your tribes men wise and honourable , and appointed them rulers , tribunes , and centurions , and officers over fifties , and over tens , who might teach you all things .
DRA	Deuteronomy	1	16	And I commanded them , saying : Hear them , and judge that which is just : whether he be one of your country , or a stranger .
DRA	Deuteronomy	1	17	There shall be no difference of persons , you shall hear the little as well as the great : neither shall you respect any man 's person , because it is the judgment of God . And if any thing seem hard to you , refer it to me , and I will hear it .
DRA	Deuteronomy	1	18	And I commanded you all things that you were to do .
DRA	Deuteronomy	1	19	And departing from Horeb , we passed through the terrible and vast wilderness , which you saw , by the way of the mountain of the Amorrhite , as the Lord our God had commanded us . And when we were come into Cadesbarne ,
DRA	Deuteronomy	1	20	I said to you : You are come to the mountain of the Amorrhite , which the Lord our God will give to us .
DRA	Deuteronomy	1	21	See the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee : go up and possess it , as the Lord our God hath spoken to thy fathers : fear not , nor be any way discouraged .
DRA	Deuteronomy	1	22	And you came all to me , and said : Let us send men who may view the land , and bring us word what way we shall go up , and to what cities we shall go .
DRA	Deuteronomy	1	23	And because the saying pleased me , I sent of you twelve men , one of every tribe :
DRA	Deuteronomy	1	24	Who , when they had set forward and had gone up to the mountains , came as far as the valley of the cluster : and having viewed the land ,
DRA	Deuteronomy	1	25	Taking of the fruits thereof , to shew its fertility , they brought them to us , and said : The land is good , which the Lord our God will give us .
DRA	Deuteronomy	1	26	And you would not go up , but being incredulous to the word of the Lord our God ,
DRA	Deuteronomy	1	27	You murmured in your tents , and said : The Lord hateth us , and therefore he hath brought us out of the land of Egypt , that he might deliver us into the hand of the Amorrhite , and destroy us .
DRA	Deuteronomy	1	28	Whither shall we go up ? the messengers have terrified our hearts , saying : The multitude is very great , and taller than we : the cities are great , and walled up to the sky , we have seen the sons of the Enacims there .
DRA	Deuteronomy	1	29	And I said to you : Fear not , neither be ye afraid of them :
DRA	Deuteronomy	1	30	The Lord God , who is your leader , himself will fight for you , as he did in Egypt in the sight of all .
DRA	Deuteronomy	1	31	And in the wilderness ( as thou hast seen ) the Lord thy God hath carried thee , as a man is wont to carry his little son , all the way that you have come , until you came to this place .
DRA	Deuteronomy	1	32	And yet for all this you did not believe the Lord your God ,
DRA	Deuteronomy	1	33	Who went before you in the way , and marked out the place , wherein you should pitch your tents , in the night shewing you the way by fire , and in the day by the pillar of a cloud .
DRA	Deuteronomy	1	34	And when the Lord had heard the voice of your words , he was angry and swore , and said :
DRA	Deuteronomy	1	35	Not one of the men of this wicked generation shall see the good land , which I promised with an oath to your fathers :
DRA	Deuteronomy	1	36	Except Caleb the son of Jephone : for he shall see it , and to him I will give the land that he hath trodden upon , and to his children , because he hath followed the Lord .
DRA	Deuteronomy	1	37	Neither is his indignation against the people to be wondered at , since the Lord was angry with me also on your account , and said : Neither shalt thou go in thither .
DRA	Deuteronomy	1	38	But Josue the son of Nun , thy minister , he shall go in for thee : exhort and encourage him , and he shall divide the land by lot to Israel .
DRA	Deuteronomy	1	39	Your children , of whom you said that they should be led away captives , and your sons who know not this day the difference of good and evil , they shall go in : and to them I will give the land , and they shall possess it .
DRA	Deuteronomy	1	40	But return you and go into the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea .
DRA	Deuteronomy	1	41	And you answered me : We have sinned against the Lord : we will go up and fight , as the Lord our God hath commanded . And when you went ready armed unto the mountain ,
DRA	Deuteronomy	1	42	The Lord said to me : Say to them : Go not up , and fight not , for I am not with you : lest you fall before your enemies .
DRA	Deuteronomy	1	43	I spoke , and you hearkened not : but resisting the commandment of the Lord , and swelling with pride , you went up into the mountain .
DRA	Deuteronomy	1	44	And the Amorrhite that dwelt in the mountains coming out , and meeting you , chased you , as bees do : and made slaughter of you from Seir as far as Horma .
DRA	Deuteronomy	1	45	And when you returned and wept before the Lord , he heard you not , neither would he yield to your voice .
DRA	Deuteronomy	1	46	So you abode in Cadesbarne a long time . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Deuteronomy	2	2	And the Lord said to me :
DRA	Deuteronomy	2	1899	American Edition
DRA	Deuteronomy	2	3	You have compassed this mountain long enough : go toward the north :
DRA	Deuteronomy	2	4	And command thou the people , saying : You shall pass by the borders of your brethren the children of Esau , who dwell in Seir , and they will be afraid of you .
DRA	Deuteronomy	2	5	Take ye then good heed that you stir not against them . For I will not give you of their land so much as the step of one foot can tread upon , because I have given mount Seir to Esau , for a possession .
DRA	Deuteronomy	2	6	You shall buy meats of them for money and shall eat : you shall draw waters for money , and shall drink .
DRA	Deuteronomy	2	7	The Lord thy God hath blessed thee in every work of thy hands : the Lord thy God dwelling with thee , knoweth thy journey , how thou hast passed through this great wilderness , for forty years , and thou hast wanted nothing .
DRA	Deuteronomy	2	8	And when we had passed by our brethren the children of Esau , that dwelt in Seir , by the way of the plain from Elath and from Asiongaber , we came to the way that leadeth to the desert of Moab .
DRA	Deuteronomy	2	9	And the Lord said to me : Fight not against the Moabites , neither go to battle against them : for I will not give thee any of their land , because I have given Ar to the children of Lot in possession .
DRA	Deuteronomy	2	10	The Emims first were the inhabitants thereof , a people great , and strong , and so tall , that like the race of the Enacims ,
DRA	Deuteronomy	2	11	They were esteemed as giants , and were like the sons of the Enacims . But the Moabites call them Emims .
DRA	Deuteronomy	2	12	The Horrhites also formerly dwelt in Seir : who being driven out and destroyed , the children of Esau dwelt there , as Israel did in the land of his possession , which the Lord gave him .
DRA	Deuteronomy	2	13	Then rising up to pass the torrent Zared , we came to it .
DRA	Deuteronomy	2	14	And the time that we journeyed from Cadesbarne till we passed over the torrent Zared , was thirty-eight years : until all the generation of the men that were fit for war was consumed out of the camp , as the Lord had sworn :
DRA	Deuteronomy	2	15	For his hand was against them , that they should perish from the midst of the camp .
DRA	Deuteronomy	2	16	And after all the fighting men were dead ,
DRA	Deuteronomy	2	17	The Lord spoke to me , saying :
DRA	Deuteronomy	2	18	Thou shalt pass this day the borders of Moab , the city named Ar :
DRA	Deuteronomy	2	19	And when thou comest nigh the frontiers of the children of Ammon , take heed thou fight not against them , nor once move to battle : for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon , because I have given it to the children of Lot for a possession .
DRA	Deuteronomy	2	20	It was accounted a land of giants : and giants formerly dwelt in it , whom the Ammonites call Zomzommims ,
DRA	Deuteronomy	2	21	A people great and many , and of tall stature , like the Enacims whom the Lord destroyed before their face : and he made them to dwell in their stead ,
DRA	Deuteronomy	2	22	As he had done in favour of the children of Esau , that dwell in Seir , destroying the Horrhites , and delivering their land to them , which they possess to this day .
DRA	Deuteronomy	2	23	The Hevites also , that dwelt in Haserim as far as Gaza , were expelled by the Cappadocians : who came out of Cappadocia , and destroyed them , and dwelt in their stead .
DRA	Deuteronomy	2	24	Arise ye , and pass the torrent Arnon : Behold I have delivered into thy hand Sehon king of Hesebon the Amorrhite , and begin thou to possess his land and make war against him .
DRA	Deuteronomy	2	25	This day will I begin to send the dread and fear of thee upon the nations that dwell under the whole heaven : that when they hear thy name they may fear and tremble , and be in pain like women in travail .
DRA	Deuteronomy	2	26	So I sent messengers from the wilderness of Cademoth to Sehon the king of Hesebon with peaceable words , saying :
DRA	Deuteronomy	2	27	We will pass through thy land , we will go along by the highway : we will not turn aside neither to the right hand nor to the left .
DRA	Deuteronomy	2	28	Sell us meat for money , that we may eat : give us water for money and so we will drink . We only ask that thou wilt let us pass through ,
DRA	Deuteronomy	2	29	As the children of Esau have done , that dwell in Seir , and the Moabites , that abide in Ar : until we come to the Jordan , and pass to the land which the Lord our God will give us .
DRA	Deuteronomy	2	30	And Sehon the king of Hesebon would not let us pass : because the Lord thy God had hardened his spirit , and fixed his heart , that he might be delivered into thy hands , as now thou seest .
DRA	Deuteronomy	2	31	And the Lord said to me : Behold I have begun to deliver unto thee Sehon and his land , begin to possess it .
DRA	Deuteronomy	2	32	And Sehon came out to meet us with all his people to fight at Jasa .
DRA	Deuteronomy	2	33	And the Lord our God delivered him to us : and we slew him with his sons and all his people .
DRA	Deuteronomy	2	34	And we took all his cities at that time , killing the inhabitants of them , men and women and children . We left nothing of them :
DRA	Deuteronomy	2	35	Except the cattle which came to the share of them that took them : and the spoils of the cities , which we took :
DRA	Deuteronomy	2	36	From Aroer , which is upon the bank of the torrent Amen , a town that is situate in a valley , as far as Galaad . There was not a village or city , that escaped our hands : the Lord our God delivered all unto us :
DRA	Deuteronomy	2	37	Except the land of the children of Ammon , to which we approached not : and all that border upon the torrent Jeboc , and the cities in the mountains , and all the places which the Lord our God forbade us . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Deuteronomy	3	3	So the Lord our God delivered into our hands , Og also the king of Basan , and all his people : and we utterly destroyed them ,
DRA	Deuteronomy	3	1899	American Edition
DRA	Deuteronomy	3	2	And the Lord said to me : Fear him not : because he is delivered into thy hand , with all his people and his land : and thou shalt do to him as thou hast done to Sehon king of the Amorrhites , that dwelt in Hesebon .
DRA	Deuteronomy	3	4	Wasting all his cities at one time , there was not a town that escaped us : sixty cities , all the country of Argob the kingdom of Og in Basan .
DRA	Deuteronomy	3	5	All the cities were fenced with very high walls , and with gates and bars , besides innumerable towns that had no walls .
DRA	Deuteronomy	3	6	And we utterly destroyed them , as we had done to Sehon the king of Hesebon , destroying every city , men and women and children :
DRA	Deuteronomy	3	7	But the cattle and the spoils of the cities we took for our prey .
DRA	Deuteronomy	3	8	And we took at that time the land out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorrhites , that were beyond the Jordan : from the torrent Amen unto the mount Hermon ,
DRA	Deuteronomy	3	9	Which the Sidonians call Sarion , and the Amorrhites Sanir :
DRA	Deuteronomy	3	10	All the cities that are situate in the plain , and all the land of Galaad and Basan as far as Selcha and Edrai , cities of the kingdom of Og in Basan .
DRA	Deuteronomy	3	11	For only Og king of Basan remained of the race of the giants . His bed of iron is shewn , which is in Rabbath of the children of Ammon , being nine cubits long , and four broad after the measure of the cubit of a man 's hand .
DRA	Deuteronomy	3	12	And we possessed the land at that time from Aroer , which is upon the bank of the torrent Amen , unto the half of mount Galaad : and I gave the cities thereof to Ruben and Gad .
DRA	Deuteronomy	3	13	And I delivered the other part of Galaad , and all Basan the kingdom of Og to the half tribe of Manasses , all the country of Argob : and all Basan is called the Land of giants .
DRA	Deuteronomy	3	14	Jair the son of Manasses possessed all the country of Argob unto the borders of Gessuri , and Machati . And he called Basan by his own name , Havoth Jair , that is to say , the towns of Jair , until this present day .
DRA	Deuteronomy	3	15	To Machir also I gave Galaad .
DRA	Deuteronomy	3	16	And to the tribes of Ruben and Gad I gave of the land of Galaad as far as the torrent Amen , half the torrent , and the confines even unto the torrent Jeboc , which is the border of the children of Ammon :
DRA	Deuteronomy	3	17	And the plain of the wilderness , and the Jordan , and the borders of Cenereth unto the sea of the desert , which is the most salt sea , to the foot of mount Phasga eastward .
DRA	Deuteronomy	3	18	And I commanded you at that time , saying : The Lord your God giveth you this land for an inheritance , go ye well appointed before your brethren the children of Israel , all the strong men of you ,
DRA	Deuteronomy	3	19	Leaving your wives and children and cattle . For I know you have much cattle , and they must remain in the cities , which I have delivered to you .
DRA	Deuteronomy	3	20	Until the Lord give rest to your brethren , as he hath given to you : and they also possess the land , which he will give them beyond the Jordan : then shall every man return to his possession , which I have given you .
DRA	Deuteronomy	3	21	I commanded Josue also at that time , saying : Thy eyes have seen what the Lord your God hath done to these two kings : so will he do to all the kingdoms to which thou shalt pass .
DRA	Deuteronomy	3	22	Fear them not : for the Lord your God will fight for you .
DRA	Deuteronomy	3	23	And I besought the Lord at that time , saying :
DRA	Deuteronomy	3	24	Lord God , thou hast begun to shew unto thy servant thy greatness , and most mighty hand , for there is no other God either in heaven or earth , that is able to do thy works , or to be compared to thy strength .
DRA	Deuteronomy	3	25	I will pass over therefore , and will see this excellent land beyond the Jordan , and this goodly mountain , and Libanus .
DRA	Deuteronomy	3	26	And the Lord was angry with me on your account and heard me not , but said to me : It is enough : speak no more to me of this matter .
DRA	Deuteronomy	3	27	Go up to the top of Phasga , and cast thy eyes round about to the west , and to the north , and to the south , and to the east , and behold it , for thou shalt not pass this Jordan .
DRA	Deuteronomy	3	28	Command Josue , and encourage and strengthen him : for he shall go before this people , and shall divide unto them the land which thou shalt see .
DRA	Deuteronomy	3	29	And we abode in the valley over against the temple of Phogor . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Deuteronomy	4	4	But you that adhere to the Lord your God , are all alive until this present day .
DRA	Deuteronomy	4	1899	American Edition
DRA	Deuteronomy	4	2	You shall not add to the word that I speak to you , neither shall you take away from it : keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you .
DRA	Deuteronomy	4	3	Your eyes have seen all that the Lord hath done against Beelphegor , how he hath destroyed all his worshippers from among you .
DRA	Deuteronomy	4	5	You know that I have taught you statutes and justices , as the Lord my God hath commanded me : so shall you do them in the land which you shall possess :
DRA	Deuteronomy	4	6	And you shall observe , and fulfill them in practice . For this is your wisdom , and understanding in the sight of nations , that hearing all these precepts , they may say : Behold a wise and understanding people , a great nation .
DRA	Deuteronomy	4	7	Neither is there any other nation so great , that hath gods so nigh them , as our God is present to all our petitions .
DRA	Deuteronomy	4	8	For what other nation is there so renowned that hath ceremonies , and just judgments , and all the law , which I will set forth this day before your eyes ?
DRA	Deuteronomy	4	9	Keep thyself therefore , and thy soul carefully . Forget not the words that thy eyes have seen , and let them not go out of thy heart all the days of thy life . Thou shalt teach them to thy sons and to thy grandsons ,
DRA	Deuteronomy	4	10	From the day in which thou didst stand before the Lord thy God in Horeb , when the Lord spoke to me , saying : Call together the people unto me , that they may hear my words , and may learn to fear me all the time that they live on the earth , and may teach their children .
DRA	Deuteronomy	4	11	And you came to the foot of the mount , which burned even unto heaven : and there was darkness , and a cloud and obscurity in it .
DRA	Deuteronomy	4	12	And the Lord spoke to you from the midst of the fire . You heard the voice of his words , but you saw not any form at all .
DRA	Deuteronomy	4	13	And he shewed you his covenant , which he commanded you to do , and the ten words that he wrote in two tables of stone .
DRA	Deuteronomy	4	14	And he commanded me at that time that I should teach you the ceremonies and judgments which you shall do in the land , that you shall possess .
DRA	Deuteronomy	4	15	Keep therefore your souls carefully . You saw not any similitude in the day that the Lord God spoke to you in Horeb from the midst of the fire :
DRA	Deuteronomy	4	16	Lest perhaps being deceived you might make you a graven similitude , or image of male or female ,
DRA	Deuteronomy	4	17	The similitude of any beasts , that are upon the earth , or of birds , that fly under heaven ,
DRA	Deuteronomy	4	18	Or of creeping things , that move on the earth , or of fishes , that abide in the waters under the earth :
DRA	Deuteronomy	4	19	Lest perhaps lifting up thy eyes to heaven , thou see the sun and the moon , and all the stars of heaven , and being deceived by error thou adore and serve them , which the Lord thy God created for the service of all the nations , that are under heaven .
DRA	Deuteronomy	4	20	But the Lord hath taken you and brought you out of the iron furnace of Egypt , to make you his people of inheritance , as it is this present day .
DRA	Deuteronomy	4	21	And the Lord was angry with me for your words , and he swore that I should not pass over the Jordan , nor enter into the excellent land , which he will give you .
DRA	Deuteronomy	4	22	Behold I die in this land , I shall not pass over the Jordan : you shall pass , and possess the goodly land .
DRA	Deuteronomy	4	23	Beware lest thou ever forget the covenant of the Lord thy God , which he hath made with thee : and make to thyself a graven likeness of those things which the Lord hath forbid to be made :
DRA	Deuteronomy	4	24	Because the Lord thy God is a consuming fire , a jealous God .
DRA	Deuteronomy	4	25	If you shall beget sons and grandsons , and abide in the land , and being deceived , make to yourselves any similitude , committing evil before the Lord your God , to provoke him to wrath :
DRA	Deuteronomy	4	26	I call this day heaven and earth to witness , that you shall quickly perish out of the land , which , when you have passed over the Jordan , you shall possess . You shall not dwell therein long , but the Lord will destroy you ,
DRA	Deuteronomy	4	27	And scatter you among all nations , and you shall remain a few among the nations , to which the Lord shall lead you .
DRA	Deuteronomy	4	28	And there you shall serve gods , that were framed with men 's hands : wood and stone , that neither see , nor hear , nor eat , nor smell .
DRA	Deuteronomy	4	29	And when thou shalt seek there the Lord thy God , thou shalt find him : yet so , if thou seek him with all thy heart , and all the affliction of thy soul .
DRA	Deuteronomy	4	30	After all the things aforesaid shall and thee , in the latter time thou shalt return to the Lord thy God , and shalt hear his voice .
DRA	Deuteronomy	4	31	Because the Lord thy God is a merciful God : he will not leave thee , nor altogether destroy thee , nor forget the covenant , by which he swore to thy fathers .
DRA	Deuteronomy	4	32	Ask of the days of old , that have been before thy time from the day that God created man upon the earth , from one end of heaven to the other end thereof , if ever there was done the like thing , or it hath been known at any time ,
DRA	Deuteronomy	4	33	That a people should hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of fire , as thou hast heard , and lived :
DRA	Deuteronomy	4	34	If God ever did so as to go , and take to himself a nation out of the midst of nations by temptations , signs , and wonders , by fight , and a strong hand , and stretched out arm , and horrible visions according to all the things that the Lord your God did for you in Egypt , before thy eyes .
DRA	Deuteronomy	4	35	That thou mightest know that the Lord he is God , and there is no other besides him .
DRA	Deuteronomy	4	36	From heaven he made thee to hear his voice , that he might teach thee . And upon earth he shewed thee his exceeding great fire , and thou didst hear his words out of the midst of the fire ,
DRA	Deuteronomy	4	37	Because he loved thy fathers , and chose their seed after them . And he brought thee out of Egypt , going before thee with his great power ,
DRA	Deuteronomy	4	38	To destroy at thy coming very great nations , and stronger than thou art , and to bring thee in , and give thee their land for a possession , as thou seest at this present day .
DRA	Deuteronomy	4	39	Know therefore this day , and think in thy heart that the Lord he is God in heaven above , and in the earth beneath , and there is no other .
DRA	Deuteronomy	4	40	Keep his precepts and commandments , which I command thee : that it may be well with thee , and thy children after thee , and thou mayst remain a long time upon the land , which the Lord thy God will give thee .
DRA	Deuteronomy	4	41	Then Moses set aside three cities beyond the Jordan at the east side ,
DRA	Deuteronomy	4	42	That any one might flee to them who should kill his neighbour unwillingly , and was not his enemy a day or two before , and that he might escape to some one of these cities :
DRA	Deuteronomy	4	43	Bosor in the wilderness , which is situate in the plains of the tribe of Ruben : and Ramoth in Galaad , which is in the tribe of Gad : and Golan in Basan , which is in the tribe of Manasses .
DRA	Deuteronomy	4	44	This is the law , that Moses set before the children of Israel ,
DRA	Deuteronomy	4	45	And these are the testimonies and ceremonies and judgments , which he spoke to the children of Israel , when they came out of Egypt ,
DRA	Deuteronomy	4	46	Beyond the Jordan in the valley over against the temple of Phogor , in the land of Sehon king of the Amorrhites , that dwelt in Hesebon , whom Moses slew . And the children of Israel coming out of Egypt ,
DRA	Deuteronomy	4	47	Possessed his land , and the land of Og king of Basan , of the two kings of the Amorrhites , who were beyond the Jordan towards the rising of the sun :
DRA	Deuteronomy	4	48	From Aroer , which is situate upon the bank of the torrent Amen , unto mount Sion , which is also called Hermon ,
DRA	Deuteronomy	4	49	All the plain beyond the Jordan at the east side , unto the see of the wilderness , and unto the foot of mount Phasga . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Deuteronomy	5	5	I was the mediator and stood between the Lord and you at that time , to shew you his words , for you feared the fire , and went not up into the mountain , and he said :
DRA	Deuteronomy	5	1899	American Edition
DRA	Deuteronomy	5	2	The Lord our God made a covenant with us in Horeb .
DRA	Deuteronomy	5	3	He made not the covenant with our fathers , but with us , who are now present and living .
DRA	Deuteronomy	5	4	He spoke to us face to face in the mount out of the midst of fire .
DRA	Deuteronomy	5	6	I am the Lord thy God , who brought thee out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage .
DRA	Deuteronomy	5	7	Thou shalt not have strange gods in my sight .
DRA	Deuteronomy	5	8	Thou shalt not make to thyself a graven thing , nor the likeness of any things , that are in heaven above , or that are in the earth beneath , or that abide in the waters under the earth .
DRA	Deuteronomy	5	9	Thou shalt not adore them , and thou shalt not serve them . For I am the Lord thy God , a jealous God , visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon their children unto the third and fourth generation , to them that hate me ,
DRA	Deuteronomy	5	10	And shewing mercy unto many thousands , to them that love me , and keep my commandments .
DRA	Deuteronomy	5	11	Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain : for he shall not be unpunished that taketh his name upon a vain thing .
DRA	Deuteronomy	5	12	Observe the day of the sabbath , to sanctify it , as the Lord thy God hath commanded thee .
DRA	Deuteronomy	5	13	Six days shalt thou labour , and shalt do all thy works .
DRA	Deuteronomy	5	14	The seventh is the day of the sabbath , that is , the rest of the Lord thy God . Thou shalt not do any work therein , thou nor thy son nor thy daughter , nor thy manservant nor thy maidservant , nor thy ox , nor thy ass , nor any of thy beasts , nor the stranger that is within thy gates : that thy manservant and thy maidservant may rest , even as thyself .
DRA	Deuteronomy	5	15	Remember that thou also didst serve in Egypt , and the Lord thy God brought thee out from thence with a strong hand , and a stretched out arm . Therefore hath he commanded thee that thou shouldst observe the sabbath day .
DRA	Deuteronomy	5	16	Honour thy father and mother , as the Lord thy God hath commanded thee , that thou mayst live a long time , and it may be well with thee in the land , which the Lord thy God will give thee .
DRA	Deuteronomy	5	17	Thou shalt not kill .
DRA	Deuteronomy	5	18	Neither shalt thou commit adultery .
DRA	Deuteronomy	5	19	And thou shalt not steal .
DRA	Deuteronomy	5	20	Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour .
DRA	Deuteronomy	5	21	Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour 's wife : nor his house , nor his field , nor his manservant , nor his maidservant , nor his ox , nor his ass , nor any thing that is his .
DRA	Deuteronomy	5	22	These words the Lord spoke to all the multitude of you in the mountain , out of the midst of the fire and the cloud , and the darkness , with a loud voice , adding nothing more : and he wrote them in two tables of stone , which he delivered unto me .
DRA	Deuteronomy	5	23	But you , after you heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness , and saw the mountain burn , came to me , all the princes of the tribes and the elders , and you said :
DRA	Deuteronomy	5	24	Behold the Lord our God hath shewn us his majesty and his greatness , we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire , and have proved this day that God speaking with man , man hath lived .
DRA	Deuteronomy	5	25	Why shall we die therefore , and why shall this exceeding great fire consume us : for if we hear the voice of the Lord our God any more , we shall die .
DRA	Deuteronomy	5	26	What is all flesh , that it should hear the voice of the living God , who speaketh out of the midst of the fire , as we have heard , and be able to live ?
DRA	Deuteronomy	5	27	Approach thou rather : and hear all things that the Lord our God shall say to thee , and thou shalt speak to us , and we will hear and will do them .
DRA	Deuteronomy	5	28	And when the Lord had heard this , he said to me : I have heard the voice of the words of this people , which they spoke to thee : they have spoken all things well .
DRA	Deuteronomy	5	29	Who shall give them to have such a mind , to fear me , and to keep all my commandments at all times , that it may be well with them and with their children for ever ?
DRA	Deuteronomy	5	30	Go and say to them : Return into your tents .
DRA	Deuteronomy	5	31	But stand thou here with me , and I will speak to thee all my commandments , and ceremonies and judgments : which thou shalt teach them , that they may do them in the land , which I will give them for a possession .
DRA	Deuteronomy	5	32	Keep therefore and do the things which the Lord God hath commanded you : you shall not go aside neither to the right hand , nor to the left .
DRA	Deuteronomy	5	33	But you shall walk in the way that the Lord your God hath commanded , that you may live , and it may be well with you , and your days may be long in the land of your possession . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )

DRA	Deuteronomy	6	5	Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart , and with thy whole soul , and with thy whole strength .
DRA	Deuteronomy	6	7	And thou shalt tell them to thy children , and thou shalt meditate upon them sitting in thy house , and walking on thy journey , sleeping and rising .
DRA	Deuteronomy	6	8	And thou shalt bind them as a sign on thy hand , and they shall be and shall move between thy eyes .
DRA	Deuteronomy	6	9	And thou shalt write them in the entry , and on the doors of thy house .
DRA	Deuteronomy	6	10	And when the Lord thy God shall have brought thee into the land , for which he swore to thy fathers Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob : and shall have given thee great and goodly cities , which thou didst not build ,
DRA	Deuteronomy	6	11	Houses full of riches , which thou didst not set up , cisterns which thou didst not dig , vineyards and oliveyards , which thou didst not plant ,
DRA	Deuteronomy	6	12	And thou shalt have eaten and be full :
DRA	Deuteronomy	6	13	Take heed diligently lest thou forget the Lord , who brought thee out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage . Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God , and shalt serve him only , and thou shalt swear by his name .
DRA	Deuteronomy	6	14	You shall not go after the strange gods of all the nations , that are round about you :

DRA	Deuteronomy	6	20	And when thy son shall ask thee to morrow , saying : What mean these testimonies , and ceremonies and judgments , which the Lord our God hath commanded us ?
DRA	Deuteronomy	6	21	Thou shalt say to him : We were bondmen of Pharao in Egypt , and the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a strong hand .
DRA	Deuteronomy	6	22	And he wrought signs and wonders great and very grievous in Egypt against Pharao , and all his house , in our sight ,
DRA	Deuteronomy	6	23	And he brought us out from thence , that he might bring us in and give us the land , concerning which he swore to our fathers .

DRA	Deuteronomy	7	1899	American Edition
DRA	Deuteronomy	7	2	And the Lord thy God shall have delivered them to thee , thou shalt utterly destroy them . Thou shalt make no league with them , nor shew mercy to them :
DRA	Deuteronomy	7	3	Neither shalt thou make marriages with them . Thou shalt not give thy daughter to his son , nor take his daughter for thy son :
DRA	Deuteronomy	7	4	For she will turn away thy son from following me , that he may rather serve strange gods , and the wrath of the Lord will be kindled , and will quickly destroy thee .
DRA	Deuteronomy	7	5	But thus rather shall you deal with them : Destroy their altars , and break their statues , and cut down their groves , and burn their graven things .
DRA	Deuteronomy	7	6	Because thou art a holy people to the Lord thy God . The Lord thy God hath chosen thee , to be his peculiar people of all peoples that are upon the earth .
DRA	Deuteronomy	7	8	But because the Lord hath loved you , and hath kept his oath , which he swore to your fathers : and hath brought you out with a strong hand , and redeemed you from the house of bondage , out of the hand of Pharao the king of Egypt .
DRA	Deuteronomy	7	9	And thou shalt know that the Lord thy God , he is a strong and faithful God , keeping his covenant and mercy to them that love him , and to them that keep his commandments , unto a thousand generations :
DRA	Deuteronomy	7	10	And repaying forthwith them that hate him , so as to destroy them , without further delay immediately rendering to them what they deserve .
DRA	Deuteronomy	7	11	Keep therefore the precepts and ceremonies and judgments , which I command thee this day to do .
DRA	Deuteronomy	7	12	If after thou hast heard these judgments , thou keep and do them , the Lord thy God will also keep his covenant to thee , and the mercy which he swore to thy fathers :
DRA	Deuteronomy	7	13	And he will love thee and multiply thee , and will bless the fruit of thy womb , and the fruit of thy land , thy corn , and thy vintage , thy oil , and thy herds , and the flocks of thy sheep upon the land , for which he swore to thy fathers that he would give it thee .
DRA	Deuteronomy	7	14	Blessed shalt thou be among all people . No one shall be barren among you of either sex , neither of men nor cattle .

DRA	Deuteronomy	7	19	The exceeding great plagues , which thy eyes saw , and the signs and wonders , and the strong hand , and the stretched out arm , with which the Lord thy God brought thee out : so will he do to all the people , whom thou fearest .
DRA	Deuteronomy	7	20	Moreover the Lord thy God will send also hornets among them , until he destroy and consume all that have escaped thee , and could hide themselves .
DRA	Deuteronomy	7	21	Thou shalt not fear them , because the Lord thy God is in the midst of thee , a God mighty and terrible :
DRA	Deuteronomy	7	22	He will consume these nations in thy sight by little and little and by degrees . Thou wilt not be able to destroy them altogether : lest perhaps the beasts of the earth should increase upon thee .
DRA	Deuteronomy	7	23	But the Lord thy God shall deliver them in thy sight : and shall slay them until they be utterly destroyed .
DRA	Deuteronomy	7	24	And he shall deliver their kings into thy hands , and thou shalt destroy their names from under Heaven : no man shall be able to resist thee , until thou destroy them .
DRA	Deuteronomy	7	25	Their graven things thou shalt burn with fire : thou shalt not covet the silver and gold of which they are made , neither shalt thou take to thee any thing thereof , lest thou offend , because it is an abomination to the Lord thy God .
DRA	Deuteronomy	7	26	Neither shalt thou bring any thing of the idol into thy house , lest thou become an anathema , like it . Thou shalt detest it as dung , and shalt utterly abhor it as uncleanness and filth , because it is an anathema . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )

DRA	Deuteronomy	8	3	He afflicted thee with want , and gave thee manna for thy food , which neither thou nor thy fathers knew : to shew that not in bread alone doth man live , but in every word that proceedeth from the mouth of God .
DRA	Deuteronomy	8	4	Thy raiment , with which thou wast covered , hath not decayed for age , and thy foot is not worn , lo this is the fortieth year ,

DRA	Deuteronomy	8	6	That thou shouldst keep the commandments of the Lord thy God , and walk in his ways , and fear him .
DRA	Deuteronomy	8	7	For the Lord thy God will bring thee into a good land , of brooks and of waters , and of fountains : in the plains of which and the hills deep rivers break out :
DRA	Deuteronomy	8	9	Where without any want thou shalt eat thy bread , and enjoy abundance of all things : where the stones are iron , and out of its hills are dug mines of brass :
DRA	Deuteronomy	8	10	That when thou hast eaten , and art full , thou mayst bless the Lord thy God for the excellent land which he hath given thee .

DRA	Deuteronomy	29	1899	American Edition
DRA	Deuteronomy	29	2	And Moses called all Israel , and said to them : You have seen all the things that the Lord did before you in the land of Egypt to Pharao , and to all his servants , and to his whole land .
DRA	Deuteronomy	29	3	The great temptations , which thy eyes have seen , those mighty signs and wonders ,
DRA	Deuteronomy	29	4	And the Lord hath not given you a heart to understand , and eyes to see , and ears that may hear , unto this present day .
DRA	Deuteronomy	29	5	He hath brought you forty years through the desert : your garments are not worn out , neither are the shoes of your feet consumed with age .
DRA	Deuteronomy	29	6	You have not eaten bread , nor have you drunk wine or strong drink : that you might know that I am the Lord your God .
DRA	Deuteronomy	29	7	And you came to this place : sand Sehon king of Hesebon , and Og king of Basan , came out against us to fight . And we slew them .
DRA	Deuteronomy	29	8	And took their land , and delivered it for a possession to Ruben and Gad , and the half tribe of Manasses .
DRA	Deuteronomy	29	9	Keep therefore the words of this covenant , and fulfill them : that you may understand all that you do .
DRA	Deuteronomy	29	10	You all stand this day before the Lord your God , your princes , and tribes , and ancients , and doctors , all the people of Israel ,
DRA	Deuteronomy	29	11	Your children and your wives , and the stranger that abideth with thee in the camp , besides the hewers of wood , and them that bring water :
DRA	Deuteronomy	29	12	That thou mayst pass in the covenant of the Lord thy God , and in the oath which this day the Lord thy God maketh with thee .
DRA	Deuteronomy	29	13	That he may raise thee up a people to himself , and he may be thy God as he hath spoken to thee , and as he swore to thy fathers Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob .
DRA	Deuteronomy	29	14	Neither with you only do I make this covenant , and confirm these oaths ,
DRA	Deuteronomy	29	15	But with all that are present and that are absent .
DRA	Deuteronomy	29	16	For you know how we dwelt in the land of Egypt , and how we have passed through the midst of nations , and passing through them ,
DRA	Deuteronomy	29	17	You have seen their abominations and filth , that is to say , their idols , wood and stone , silver and gold , which they worshipped .
DRA	Deuteronomy	29	18	Lest perhaps there should be among you a man or a woman , a family or a tribe , whose heart is turned away this day from the Lord our God , to go and serve the gods of those nations : and there should be among you a root bringing forth gall and bitterness .
DRA	Deuteronomy	29	19	And when he shall hear the words of this oath , he should bless himself in his heart saying : I shall have peace , and will walk on in the naughtiness of my heart : and the drunken may consume the thirsty ,
DRA	Deuteronomy	29	20	And the Lord should not forgive him : but his wrath and jealousy against that man should be exceedingly enkindled at that time , and all the curses that are written in this volume should light upon him : and the Lord should blot out his name from under heaven ,
DRA	Deuteronomy	29	21	And utterly destroy him out of all the tribes of Israel , according to the curses that are contained in the book of this law and covenant :
DRA	Deuteronomy	29	22	And the following generation shall say , and the children that shall be born hereafter , and the strangers that shall come from afar , seeing the plagues of that land and the evils wherewith the Lord hath afflicted it ,
DRA	Deuteronomy	29	23	Burning it with brimstone , and the heat of salt , so that it can not be sown any more , nor any green thing grow therein , after the example of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrha , Adama and Seboim , which the Lord destroyed in his wrath and indignation :
DRA	Deuteronomy	29	24	And all the nations shall say : Why hath the Lord done thus to this land ? what meaneth this exceeding great heat of his wrath ?
DRA	Deuteronomy	29	25	And they shall answer : Because they forsook the covenant of the Lord , which he made with their fathers , when he brought them out of the land of Egypt :
DRA	Deuteronomy	29	26	And they have served strange gods , and adored them , whom they knew not , and for whom they had not been assigned :
DRA	Deuteronomy	29	27	Therefore the wrath of the Lord was kindled against this land , to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this volume :
DRA	Deuteronomy	29	28	And he hath cast them out of their land , in anger and in wrath , and in very great indignation , and hath thrown them into a strange land , as it is seen this day .
DRA	Deuteronomy	30	30	Now when all these things shall be come upon thee , the blessing or the curse , which I have set forth before thee , and thou shalt be touched with repentance of thy heart among all the nations , into which the Lord thy God shall have scattered thee ,
DRA	Deuteronomy	30	1899	American Edition
DRA	Deuteronomy	30	2	And shalt return to him , and obey his commandments , as I command thee this day , thou and thy children , with all thy heart , and with all thy soul :
DRA	Deuteronomy	30	3	The Lord thy God will bring back again thy captivity , and will have mercy on thee , and gather thee again out of all the nations , into which he scattered thee before .
DRA	Deuteronomy	30	4	If thou be driven as far as the poles of heaven , the Lord thy God will fetch thee back from thence ,
DRA	Deuteronomy	30	5	And will take thee to himself , and bring thee into the land which thy fathers possessed , and thou shalt possess it : and blessing thee , he will make thee more numerous than were thy fathers .
DRA	Deuteronomy	30	6	The Lord thy God will circumcise thy heart , and the heart of thy seed : that then mayst love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul , that thou mayst live .
DRA	Deuteronomy	30	7	And he will turn all these curses upon thy enemies , and upon them that hate and persecute thee .
DRA	Deuteronomy	30	8	But thou shalt return , and hear the voice of the Lord thy God , and shalt do all the commandments which I command thee this day :
DRA	Deuteronomy	30	9	And the Lord thy God will make thee abound in all the works of thy hands , in the fruit of thy womb , and in the fruit of thy cattle , in the fruitfulness of thy land , and in the plenty of all things . For the Lord will return to rejoice over thee in all good things , as he rejoiced in thy fathers :
DRA	Deuteronomy	30	10	Yet so if thou hear the voice of the Lord thy God , and keep his precepts and ceremonies , which are written in this law : and return to the Lord thy God with all thy heart , and with all thy soul .
DRA	Deuteronomy	30	11	This commandment , that I command thee this day is not above thee , nor far off from thee :
DRA	Deuteronomy	30	12	Nor is it in heaven , that thou shouldst say : Which of us can go up to heaven to bring it unto us , and we may hear and fulfill it in work ?
DRA	Deuteronomy	30	13	Nor is it beyond the sea : that thou mayst excuse thyself , and say : Which of us can cross the sea , and bring it unto us : that we may hear , and do that which is commanded ?
DRA	Deuteronomy	30	14	But the word is very nigh unto thee , in thy mouth and in thy heart , that thou mayst do it .
DRA	Deuteronomy	30	15	Consider that I have set before thee this day life and good , and on the other hand death and evil :
DRA	Deuteronomy	30	16	That thou mayst love the Lord thy God , and walk in his ways , and keep his commandments and ceremonies and judgments , and thou mayst live , and he may multiply thee , and bless thee in the land , which thou shalt go in to possess .
DRA	Deuteronomy	30	17	But if thy heart be turned away , so that thou wilt not hear , and being deceived with error thou adore strange gods , and serve them :
DRA	Deuteronomy	30	18	I foretell thee this day that thou shalt perish , and shalt remain but a short time in the land , to which thou shalt pass over the Jordan , and shalt go in to possess it .
DRA	Deuteronomy	30	19	I call heaven and earth to witness this day , that I have set before you life and death , blessing and cursing . Choose therefore life , that both thou and thy seed may live :
DRA	Deuteronomy	30	20	And that thou mayst love the Lord thy God , and obey his voice , and adhere to him ( for he is thy life , and the length of thy days , ) that thou mayst dwell in the land , for which the Lord swore to thy fathers Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob that he would give it them .

DRA	Deuteronomy	31	31	And Moses went , and spoke all these words to all Israel ,
DRA	Deuteronomy	31	1899	American Edition
DRA	Deuteronomy	31	2	And he said to them : I am this day a hundred and twenty years old , I can no longer go out and come in , especially as the Lord also hath said to me : O Thou shalt not pass over this Jordan .
DRA	Deuteronomy	31	3	The Lord thy God then will pass over before thee : he will destroy all these nations in thy sight , and thou shalt possess them : and this Josue shall go over before thee , as the Lord hath spoken .
DRA	Deuteronomy	31	4	And the Lord shall do to them as he did to Sehon and Og the kings of the Amorrhites , and to their land , and shall destroy them .
DRA	Deuteronomy	31	5	Therefore when the Lord shall have delivered these also to you , you shall do in like manner to them as I have commanded you ,
DRA	Deuteronomy	31	6	Do manfully and be of good heart : fear not , nor be ye dismayed at their sight : for the Lord thy God he himself is thy leader , and will not leave thee nor forsake thee .
DRA	Deuteronomy	31	7	And Moses called Josue , and said to him before all Israel : Take courage , and be valiant : for thou shalt bring this people into the land which the Lord swore he would give to their fathers , and thou shalt divide it by lot .
DRA	Deuteronomy	31	8	And the Lord who is your leader , he himself will be with thee : he will not leave thee , nor forsake thee : fear not , neither be dismayed .
DRA	Deuteronomy	31	9	And Moses wrote this law , and delivered it to the priests the sons of Levi , who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord , and to all the ancients of Israel .
DRA	Deuteronomy	31	10	And he commanded them , saying : After seven years , in the year of remission , in the feast of tabernacles ,
DRA	Deuteronomy	31	11	When all Israel come together , to appear in the sight of the Lord thy God in the place which the Lord shall choose , thou shalt read the words of this law before all Israel , in their hearing ,
DRA	Deuteronomy	31	12	And the people being all assembled together , both men and women , children and strangers , that are within thy gates : that hearing they may learn , and fear the Lord your God , and keep , and fulfill all the words of this law :
DRA	Deuteronomy	31	13	That their children also , who now are ignorant , may hear , and fear the Lord their God , all the days that they live in the land whither you are going over the Jordan to possess it .
DRA	Deuteronomy	31	14	And the Lord said to Moses : Behold the days of thy death are nigh : call Josue , and stand ye in the tabernacle of the testimony , that I may give him a charge . So Moses and Josue went and stood in the tabernacle of the testimony :
DRA	Deuteronomy	31	15	And the Lord appeared there in the pillar of a cloud , which stood in the entry of the tabernacle .
DRA	Deuteronomy	31	16	And the Lord said to Moses : Behold thou shalt sleep with thy fathers , and this people rising up will go a fornicating after strange gods in the land , to which it goeth in to dwell : there will they forsake me , and will make void the covenant , which I have made with them ,
DRA	Deuteronomy	31	17	And my wrath shall be kindled against them in that day : and I will forsake them , and will hide my face from them , and they shall be devoured : all evils and afflictions shall find them , so that they shall say in that day : In truth it is because God is not with me , that these evils have found me .
DRA	Deuteronomy	31	18	But I will hide , and cover my face in that day , for all the evils which they have done , because they have followed strange gods .
DRA	Deuteronomy	31	19	Now therefore write you this canticle , and teach the children of Israel : that they may know it by heart , and sing it by mouth , and this song may be unto me for a testimony among the children of Israel .
DRA	Deuteronomy	31	20	For I will bring them into the land , for which I swore to their fathers , that floweth with milk and honey . And when they have eaten , and are full and fat , they will turn away after strange gods , and will serve them : and will despise me , and make void my covenant .
DRA	Deuteronomy	31	21	And after many evils and afflictions shall have come upon them , this canticle shall answer them for a testimony , which no oblivion shall take away out of the mouth of their seed . For I know their thoughts , and what they are about to do this day , before that I bring them into the land which I have promised them .
DRA	Deuteronomy	31	22	Moses therefore wrote the canticle and taught it to the children of Israel .
DRA	Deuteronomy	31	23	And the Lord commanded Josue the son of Nun , and said : Take courage , and be valiant : for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the land which I have promised , and I will be with thee .
DRA	Deuteronomy	31	24	Therefore after Moses had wrote the words of this law in a volume , and finished it :
DRA	Deuteronomy	31	25	He commanded the Levites , who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord . saying :
DRA	Deuteronomy	31	26	Take this book , and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God : that it may be there for a testimony against thee .
DRA	Deuteronomy	31	27	For I know thy obstinacy , and thy most stiff neck , While I am yet living , and going in with you , you have always been rebellious against the Lord : how much more when I shall be dead ?
DRA	Deuteronomy	31	28	Gather unto me all the ancients of your tribes , and your doctors , and I will speak these words in their hearing , and will call heaven and earth to witness against them .
DRA	Deuteronomy	31	29	For I know that , after my death , you will do wickedly , and will quickly turn aside from the way that I have commanded you : and evils shall come upon you in the latter times , when you shall do evil in the sight of the Lord , to provoke him by the works of your hands .
DRA	Deuteronomy	31	30	Moses therefore spoke , in the hearing of the whole assembly of Israel , the words of this canticle , and finished it even to the end , Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )

DRA	Deuteronomy	32	2	Let my doctrine gather as the rain , let my speech distil as the dew , as a shower upon the herb , and as drops upon the grass .
DRA	Deuteronomy	32	3	Because I will invoke the name of the Lord : give ye magnificence to our God .
DRA	Deuteronomy	32	4	The works of God are perfect , and all his ways are judgments : God is faithful and without any iniquity , he is just and right .
DRA	Deuteronomy	32	5	They have sinned against him , and are nose of his children in their filth : they are a wicked and perverse generation .
DRA	Deuteronomy	32	6	Is this the return thou makest to the Lord , O foolish and senseless people ? Is not he thy father , that hath possessed thee , and made thee , and created thee ?
DRA	Deuteronomy	32	7	Remember the days of old , think upon every generation : ask thy father , and he will declare to thee : thy elders and they will tell thee .
DRA	Deuteronomy	32	8	When the Most High divided the nations : when he separated the sons of Adam , he appointed the bounds of people according to the number of the children of Israel .
DRA	Deuteronomy	32	9	But the Lord 's portion is his people : Jacob the lot of his inheritance .
DRA	Deuteronomy	32	10	He found him in a desert land , in a place of horror , and of vast wilderness : he led him about , and taught him : and he kept him as the apple of his eye .
DRA	Deuteronomy	32	11	As the eagle enticing her young to fly , and hovering over them , he spread his wings , and hath taken him and carried him on his shoulders .
DRA	Deuteronomy	32	12	The Lord alone was his leader : and there was no strange god with him .
DRA	Deuteronomy	32	13	He set him upon high land : that he might eat the fruits of the fields , that he might suck honey out of the rock , and oil out of the hardest stone ,
DRA	Deuteronomy	32	14	Butter of the herd , and milk of the sheep with the fat of lambs , and of the rams of the breed of Basan : and goats with the marrow of wheat , and might drink the purest blood of the grape .
DRA	Deuteronomy	32	15	The beloved grew fat , and kicked : he grew fat , and thick and gross , he forsook God who made him , and departed from God his saviour .
DRA	Deuteronomy	32	16	They provoked him by strange gods , and stirred him up to anger , with their abominations .
DRA	Deuteronomy	32	17	They sacrificed to devils and not to God : to gods whom they knew not : that were newly come up , whom their fathers worshipped not .
DRA	Deuteronomy	32	18	Thou hast forsaken the God that beget thee , and hast forgotten the Lord that created thee .
DRA	Deuteronomy	32	19	The Lord saw , and was moved to wrath : because his own sons and daughters provoked him .
DRA	Deuteronomy	32	20	And he said : I will hide my face from them , and will consider what their last end shall be : for it is a perverse generation , and unfaithful children .
DRA	Deuteronomy	32	21	They have provoked me with that which was no god , and have angered me with their vanities : and I will provoke them with that which is no people , and will vex them with a foolish nation .

DRA	Deuteronomy	32	23	I will heap evils upon them , and will spend my arrows among them .

DRA	Deuteronomy	32	25	Without , the sword shall lay them waste , and terror within , both the young man and the virgin , the sucking child with the man in years .
DRA	Deuteronomy	32	26	I said : Where are they ? I will make the memory of them to cease from among men .
DRA	Deuteronomy	32	27	But for the wrath of the enemies I have deferred it : lest perhaps their enemies might be proud , and should say : Our mighty hand , and not the Lord , hath done all these things .
DRA	Deuteronomy	32	28	They are a nation without counsel , and without wisdom .
DRA	Deuteronomy	32	29	O that they would be wise and would understand , and would provide for their last end .
DRA	Deuteronomy	32	30	How should one pursue after a thousand , and two chase ten thousand ? Was it not , because their God had sold them , and the Lord had shut them up ?
DRA	Deuteronomy	32	31	For our God is not as their gods : our enemies themselves are judges .
DRA	Deuteronomy	32	33	Their wine is the gall of dragons , and the venom of asps , which is incurable .
DRA	Deuteronomy	32	34	Are not these things stored up with me , and sealed up in my treasures ?
DRA	Deuteronomy	32	35	Revenge is mine , and I will repay them in due time , that their foot may slide : the day of destruction is at hand , and the time makes haste to come .
DRA	Deuteronomy	32	36	The Lord will judge his people , and will have mercy on his servants : he shall see that their hand is weakened , and that they who were shut up have also failed , and they that remained are consumed .
DRA	Deuteronomy	32	37	And he shall say : Where are their gods , in whom they trusted ?
DRA	Deuteronomy	32	38	Of whose victims they ate the fat , and drank the wine of their drink offerings : let them arise and help you , and protect you in your distress .
DRA	Deuteronomy	32	39	See ye that I alone am , and there is no other God besides me : I will kill and I will make to live : I will strike , and I will heal , and there is none that can deliver out of my hand .
DRA	Deuteronomy	32	40	I will lift up my hand to heaven , and I will say : I live for ever .
DRA	Deuteronomy	32	41	If I shall whet my sword as the lightning , and my hand take hold on judgment : I will render vengeance to my enemies , and repay them that hate me .
DRA	Deuteronomy	32	42	I will make my arrows drunk with blood , and my sword shall devour flesh , of the blood of the slain and of the captivity , of the bare head of the enemies .

DRA	Deuteronomy	32	50	When thou art gone up into it thou shalt be gathered to thy people , as Aaron thy brother died in mount Her , and was gathered to his people :
DRA	Deuteronomy	32	51	Because you trespassed against me in the midst of the children of Israel , at the waters of contradiction in Cades of the desert of Sin : and you did not sanctify me among the children of Israel .

DRA	Joshua	1	4	From the desert and from Libanus unto the great river Euphrates , all the land of the Hethites unto the great sea toward the going ; down of the sun , shall be your border .
DRA	Joshua	1	5	No man shall be able to resist you all the days of thy life : as I have been with Moses , so will I be with thee : I will not leave thee , nor forsake thee .
DRA	Joshua	1	6	Take courage , and be strong : for thou shalt divide by lot to this people the land , for which I swore to their fathers , that I would deliver it to them .
DRA	Joshua	1	7	Take courage therefore , and be very valiant : that thou mayst observe and do all the law , which Moses my servant hath commanded thee : turn not from it to the right hand or to the left , that thou mayst understand all things which thou dost .
DRA	Joshua	1	8	Let not the book of this law depart from thy mouth : but thou shalt meditate on it day and night , that thou mayst observe and do all things that are written in it : then shalt thou direct thy way , and understand it .

DRA	Joshua	2	2	And it was told the king of Jericho , and was said : Behold there are men come in hither , by night , of the children of Israel , to spy the land .
DRA	Joshua	2	1899	American Edition
DRA	Joshua	2	3	And the king of Jericho sent to Rahab , saying : Bring forth the men that came to thee , and are entered into thy house : for they are spies , and are come to view all the land .
DRA	Joshua	2	4	And the woman taking the men , hid them , and said : I confess they came to me , but I knew not whence they were :
DRA	Joshua	2	5	And at the time of shutting the gate in the dark , they also went out together . I know not whither they are gone : pursue after them quickly , and you will overtake them .
DRA	Joshua	2	6	But she made the men go up to the top of her house , and covered them with the stalks of flax , which was there .
DRA	Joshua	2	7	Now they that were sent , pursued after them , by the way that leadeth to the fords of the Jordan : and as soon as they were gone out , the gate was presently shut .
DRA	Joshua	2	8	The men that were hidden were not yet asleep , when behold the woman went up to them , and said :
DRA	Joshua	2	9	I know that the Lord hath given this land to you : for the dread of you is fallen upon us , and all the inhabitants of the land have lost all strength .
DRA	Joshua	2	10	We have heard that the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea at your going in , when you came out of Egypt : and what things you did to the two kings of the Amorrhites , that were beyond the Jordan : Sehon and Og whom you slew .
DRA	Joshua	2	11	And hearing these things we were affrighted , and our heart fainted away , neither did there remain any spirit in us at your coming in : for the Lord your God he is God in heaven above , and in the earth beneath .
DRA	Joshua	2	12	Now therefore swear ye to me by the Lord , that as I have shewn mercy to you , so you also will shew mercy to my father 's house : and give me a true token ,
DRA	Joshua	2	13	That you will save my father and mother , my brethren and sisters , and all things that are theirs , and deliver our souls from death .
DRA	Joshua	2	14	They answered her : Be our lives for you unto death , only if thou betray us not . And when the Lord shall have delivered us the land , we will shew thee mercy and truth .
DRA	Joshua	2	15	Then she let them down with a cord out of a window : for her house joined close to the wall .
DRA	Joshua	2	16	And she said to them : Get ye up to the mountains , lest perhaps they meet you as they return : and there lie ye hid three days , till they come back , and so you shall go on your way .
DRA	Joshua	2	17	And they said to her : We shall be blameless of this oath , which thou hast made us swear :
DRA	Joshua	2	18	If when we come into the land , this scarlet cord be a sign , and thou tie it in the window , by which thou hast let us down : and gather together thy father and mother , and brethren and all thy kindred into thy house .
DRA	Joshua	2	19	Whosoever shall go out of the door of thy house , his blood shall be upon his own head , and we shall be quit . But the blood of all that shall be with thee in the house , shall light upon our head , if any man touch them .
DRA	Joshua	2	20	But if thou wilt betray us , and utter this word abroad , we shall be quit of this oath which thou hast made us swear .
DRA	Joshua	2	21	And she answered : As you have spoken , so be it done . And sending them on their way , she hung the scarlet cord in the window .
DRA	Joshua	2	22	But they went and came to the mountains , and stayed there three days till they that pursued them were returned . For having sought them through all the way , they found them not .
DRA	Joshua	2	23	And when they were gone back into the city , the spies returned , and came down from the mountain : and passing over the Jordan , they came to Josue the son of Nun , and told him all that befel them .

DRA	Joshua	3	3	And began to proclaim : When you shall see the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God , and the priests of the race of Levi carrying it , rise you up also , and follow them as they go before :
DRA	Joshua	3	1899	American Edition
DRA	Joshua	3	2	After which , the heralds went through the midst of the camp ,
DRA	Joshua	3	4	And let there be between you and the ark the space of two thousand cubits : that you may see it afar off , and know which way you must go : for you have not gone this way before : and take care you come not near the ark .
DRA	Joshua	3	5	And Josue said to the people : Be ye sanctified : for to morrow the Lord will do wonders among you .
DRA	Joshua	3	6	And he said to the priests : Take up the ark of the covenant , and go before the people . And they obeyed his commands , and took it up and walked before them .
DRA	Joshua	3	7	And the Lord said to Josue : This day will I begin to exalt thee before Israel : that they may know that as I was with Moses , so I am with thee also .
DRA	Joshua	3	8	And do thou command the priests that carry the ark of the covenant , and say to them : When you shall have entered into part of the water of the Jordan , stand in it .
DRA	Joshua	3	9	And Josue said to the children of Israel : Come hither and hear the word of the Lord your God .
DRA	Joshua	3	10	And again he said : By this you shall know that the Lord the living God is in the midst of you , and that he shall destroy before your sight the Chanaanite and the Hethite , the Hevite and the Pherezite , the Gergesite also and the Jebusite , and the Amorrhite .
DRA	Joshua	3	11	Behold the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth shall go before you into the Jordan .
DRA	Joshua	3	12	Prepare ye twelve men of the tribes of Israel , one of every tribe .
DRA	Joshua	3	13	And when the priests , that carry the ark of the Lord the God of the whole earth , shall set the soles of their feet in the waters of the Jordan , the waters that are beneath shall run down and go off : and those that come from above , shall stand together upon a heap .
DRA	Joshua	3	14	So the people went out of their tents , to pass over the Jordan : and the priests that carried the ark of the covenant . went on before them .
DRA	Joshua	3	15	And as soon as they came into the Jordan , and their feet were dipped in part of the water , ( now the Jordan , it being harvest time , had filled the banks of its channel , )
DRA	Joshua	3	16	The waters that came down from above stood in one place , and swelling up like a mountain , were seen afar off from the city that is called Adom , to the place of Sarthan : but those that were beneath , ran down into the sea of the wilderness ( which now is called the Dead Sea ) until they wholly failed .
DRA	Joshua	3	17	And the people marched over against Jericho : and the priests that carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord , stood girded upon the dry ground in the midst of the Jordan , and all the people passed over through the channel that was dried up .

DRA	Joshua	4	1899	American Edition
DRA	Joshua	4	2	Choose twelve men , one of every tribe :
DRA	Joshua	4	3	And command them to take out of the midst of the Jordan , where the feet of the priests stood , twelve very hard stones , which you shall set in the place of the camp , where you shall pitch your tents this night .
DRA	Joshua	4	5	And he said to them : Go before the ark of the Lord your God to the midst of the Jordan , and carry from thence every man a stone on your shoulders , according to the number of the children of Israel ,
DRA	Joshua	4	6	That it may be a sign among you and when your children shall ask you to morrow , saying : What mean these stones ?
DRA	Joshua	4	7	You shall answer them : The waters of the Jordan ran off before the ark of the covenant of the Lord , when it passed over the same : therefore were these atones set for a monument of the children of Israel for ever .
DRA	Joshua	4	8	The children of Israel therefore did as Josue commanded them , carrying out of the channel of the Jordan twelve stones , as the Lord had commanded him , according to the number of the children of Israel , unto the place wherein they camped , and there they set them .
DRA	Joshua	4	9	And Josue put other twelve stones in the midst of the channel of the Jordan , where the priests stood that carried the ark of the covenant : and they are there until this present day .
DRA	Joshua	4	10	Now the priests that carried the ark , stood in the midst of the Jordan till all things were accomplished which the Lord had commanded Josue to speak to the people , and Moses had said to him . And the people made haste and passed over .
DRA	Joshua	4	11	And when they had all passed over , the ark also of the Lord passed over , and the priests went before the people .
DRA	Joshua	4	12	The children of Ruben also and Gad , and half the tribe of Manasses , went armed before the children of Israel as Moses had commanded them .
DRA	Joshua	4	13	And forty thousand fighting men by their troops , and bands , marched through the plains and fields of the city of Jericho .
DRA	Joshua	4	14	In that day the Lord magnified Josue in the sight of all Israel , that they should fear him , as they had feared Moses , while he lived .
DRA	Joshua	4	15	And he said to him :
DRA	Joshua	4	16	Command the priests , that carry the ark of the covenant , to come up out of the Jordan .
DRA	Joshua	4	17	And he commanded them , saying : Come ye up out of the Jordan .
DRA	Joshua	4	18	And when they that carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord , were come up , and began to tread on the dry ground , the waters returned into the channel , and ran as they were wont before .
DRA	Joshua	4	19	And the people came up out of the Jordan , the tenth day of the first month , and camped in Galgal , over against the east side of the city of Jericho .
DRA	Joshua	4	20	And the twelve stones which they had taken out of the channel of the Jordan , Josue pitched in Galgal ,
DRA	Joshua	4	21	And said to the children of Israel : When your children shall ask their fathers , to morrow , and shall say to them : What mean these stones ?
DRA	Joshua	4	22	You shall teach them and say : Israel passed over this Jordan through the dry channel .
DRA	Joshua	4	23	The Lord your God drying up the waters thereof in your sight , until you passed over :
DRA	Joshua	4	24	As he had done before in the Red Sea , which he dried up till we passed through :

DRA	Joshua	5	5	Now these were all circumcised . But the people that were born in the desert ,
DRA	Joshua	5	1899	American Edition
DRA	Joshua	5	2	At that time the Lord said to Josue : Make thee knives of stone , and circumcise the second time the children of Israel .
DRA	Joshua	5	3	He did what the Lord had commanded , and he circumcised the children of Israel in the hill of the foreskins .
DRA	Joshua	5	4	Now this is the cause of the second circumcision : All the people that came out of Egypt that were males , all the men fit for war , died in the desert , during the time of the long going about in the way .
DRA	Joshua	5	6	Luring the forty years of the journey in the wide wilderness , were uncircumcised : till all they were consumed that had not heard the voice of the Lord , and to whom he had sworn before , that he would not shew them the land flowing with milk and honey .
DRA	Joshua	5	7	The children of these succeeded in the place of their fathers , and were circumcised by Josue : for they were uncircumcised even as they were born , and no one had circumcised them in the way .
DRA	Joshua	5	8	Now after they were all circumcised , they remained in the same place of the camp , until they were healed .
DRA	Joshua	5	9	And the Lord said to Josue : This day have I taken away from you the reproach of Egypt . And the name of that place was called Galgal , until this present day .
DRA	Joshua	5	10	And the children of Israel abode in Galgal , and they kept the phase on the fourteenth day of the month , at evening , in the plains of Jericho :
DRA	Joshua	5	11	And they ate on the next day unleavened bread of the corn of the land , and frumenty of the same year .
DRA	Joshua	5	12	And the manna ceased after they ate of the corn of the land , neither did the children of Israel use that food any more , but they ate of the corn of the present year of the land of Chanaan .
DRA	Joshua	5	13	And when Josue was in the field of the city of Jericho , he lifted up his eyes , and saw a man standing over against him : holding a drawn sword , and he went to him , and said : Art thou one of ours , or of our adversaries ?
DRA	Joshua	5	14	And he answered : No : but I am prince of the host of the Lord , and now I am come .
DRA	Joshua	5	15	Josue fell on his face to the ground . And worshipping , add : What saith my lord to his servant ?

DRA	Joshua	6	6	Then Josue the son of Nun called the priests , and said to them : Take the ark of the covenant : and let seven other priests take the seven trumpets of the jubilee , and march before the ark of the Lord .
DRA	Joshua	6	1899	American Edition
DRA	Joshua	6	2	And the Lord said to Josue : Behold I have given into thy hands Jericho , and the king thereof , and all the valiant men .
DRA	Joshua	6	3	Go round about the city , all ye fighting men , once a day : so shall ye do for six days .
DRA	Joshua	6	4	And on the seventh day the priests shall take the seven trumpets , which are used in the jubilee , and shall go before the ark of the covenant : and you shall go about the city seven times , and the priests shall sound the trumpets .
DRA	Joshua	6	5	And when the voice of the trumpet shall give a longer and broken tune , and shall sound in your ears , all the people shall shout together with a very great shout , and the walls of the city shall fall to the ground , and they shall enter in every one at the place against which they shall stand .
DRA	Joshua	6	7	And he said to the people : Go , and compass the city , armed , marching before the ark of the Lord .
DRA	Joshua	6	8	And when Josue had ended his words , and the seven priests blew the seven trumpets before the ark of the covenant of the Lord ,
DRA	Joshua	6	9	And all the armed men went before , the rest of the common people followed the ark , and the sound of the trumpets was heard on all sides .
DRA	Joshua	6	10	But Josue had commanded the people , saying : You shall not shout , nor shall your voice be heard , nor any word go out of your mouth : until the day come wherein I shall say to you : Cry , and shout .
DRA	Joshua	6	11	So the ark of the Lord went about the city once a day , and returning into the camp , abode there .
DRA	Joshua	6	12	And Josue rising before day , the priests took the ark of the Lord ,
DRA	Joshua	6	13	And seven of them seven trumpets , which are used in the jubilee : and they went before the ark of the Lord walking and sounding the trumpets : and the armed men went before them , and the rest of the common people followed the ark , and they blew the trumpets .
DRA	Joshua	6	14	And they went round about the city the second day once , and returned into the camp . So they did six days .
DRA	Joshua	6	15	But the seventh day , rising up early , they went about the city , as it was ordered , seven times .
DRA	Joshua	6	16	And when in the seventh going about the priests sounded with the trumpets , Josue said to all Israel : Shout : for the Lord hath delivered the city to you :
DRA	Joshua	6	17	And let this city be an anathema , and all things that are in it , to the Lord . Let only Rahab the harlot live , with all that are with her in the house : for she hid the messengers whom we sent .
DRA	Joshua	6	18	But beware ye lest you touch ought of those things that are forbidden , and you be guilty of transgression , and all the camp of Israel be under sin , and be troubled .
DRA	Joshua	6	19	But whatsoever gold or silver there shall be , or vessels of brass and iron , let it be consecrated to the Lord , laid up in his treasures .
DRA	Joshua	6	20	So all the people making a shout , and the trumpets sounding , when the voice and the sound thundered in the ears of the multitude , the walls forthwith fell down : and every man went up by the place that was over against him : and they took the city ,
DRA	Joshua	6	21	And killed all that were in it , man and woman , young and old . The oxen also and the sheep , and the asses , they slew with the edge of the sword .
DRA	Joshua	6	22	But Josue said to the two men that had been sent for spies : Go into the harlot 's house , and bring her out , and all things that are hers , as you assured her by oath .
DRA	Joshua	6	23	And the young men went in and brought out Rahab , and her parents , her brethren also and all her goods and her kindred , and made them to stay without the camp .
DRA	Joshua	6	24	But they burned the city , and all things that were therein ; except the gold and silver , and vessels of brass and iron , which they consecrated into the treasury of the Lord .
DRA	Joshua	6	25	But Josue saved Rahab the harlot and her father 's house , and all she had , and they dwelt in the midst of Israel until this present day : because she hid the messengers whom he had sent to spy out Jericho . At that time , Josue made an imprecation , saying :
DRA	Joshua	6	26	Cursed be the man before the Lord , that shall raise up and build the city of Jericho . In his firstborn may he lay the foundation thereof , and in the last of his children set up its gates .

DRA	Joshua	7	1899	American Edition
DRA	Joshua	7	2	And when Josue sent men from Jericho against Hai , which is beside Bethaven , on the east side of the town of Bethel , he said to them : Go up , and view the country : and they fulfilled his command , and viewed Hai .
DRA	Joshua	7	3	And returning they said to him : Let not all the people go up , but let two or three thousand men go and destroy the city : why should all the people be troubled in vain against enemies that are very few ?
DRA	Joshua	7	4	There went up therefore three thousand fighting men : who immediately turned their backs ,
DRA	Joshua	7	5	And were defeated by the men of the city of Hai , and there fell of them six and thirty men : and the enemies pursued them from the gate as far as Sabarim , and they slew them as they fled by the descent : and the heart of the people was struck with fear , and melted like water .
DRA	Joshua	7	6	But Josue rent his garments , and fell flat on the ground before the ark of the Lord until the evening , both he and all the ancients of Israel : and they put dust upon their heads .
DRA	Joshua	7	8	My Lord God , what shall I say , seeing Israel turning their backs to their enemies ?
DRA	Joshua	7	9	The Chanaanites , and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it , and being gathered together will surround us and cut off our name from the earth : and what wilt thou do to thy great name ?
DRA	Joshua	7	10	And the Lord said to Josue : Arise , why liest thou flat on the ground ?
DRA	Joshua	7	11	Israel hath sinned , and transgressed my covenant : and they have taken of the anathema , and have stolen and lied , and have hidden it among their goods .
DRA	Joshua	7	12	Neither can Israel stand before his enemies , but he shall flee from them : because he is defiled with the anathema . I will be no more with you , till you destroy him that is guilty of this wickedness .
DRA	Joshua	7	13	Arise , sanctify the people , and say to them : Be ye sanctified against to morrow : for thus saith the Lord God of Israel : The anathema is in the midst of thee , O Israel : thou canst not stand before thy enemies , till he be destroyed out of thee that is defiled with this wickedness .
DRA	Joshua	7	14	And you shall come in the morning every one by your tribes : and what tribe soever the lot shall find , it shall come by its kindreds and the kindred by its houses , and the house by the men .
DRA	Joshua	7	15	And whosoever he be that shall be found guilty of this fact , he shall be burnt with fire with all his substance , because he hath transgressed the covenant of the Lord , and hath done wickedness in Israel .
DRA	Joshua	7	16	Josue , therefore , when he rose in the morning , made Israel to come by their tribes , and the tribe of Juda was found ,
DRA	Joshua	7	17	Which being brought by its families , it was found to be the family of Zare . Bringing that also by the houses , he found it to be Zabdi .
DRA	Joshua	7	18	And bringing his house man by man , he found Achan the son of Charmi , the son of Zabdi , the son of Zare of the tribe of Juda .
DRA	Joshua	7	19	And Josue said to Achan : My son , give glory to the Lord God of Israel , and confess , and tell me what thou hast done , hide it not .
DRA	Joshua	7	20	And Achan answered Josue , and said to him : Indeed I have sinned against the Lord the God of Israel , and thus and thus have I done .
DRA	Joshua	7	21	For I saw among the spoils a scarlet garment exceeding good , and two hundred sides of silver , and a golden rule of fifty sides : and I coveted them , and I took them away , and hid them in the ground is the midst of my tent , and the silver I covered with the earth that I dug up .
DRA	Joshua	7	22	Josue therefore sent ministers : who running to his tent , found all hidden in the same place , together with the silver .
DRA	Joshua	7	23	And taking them away out of the tent , they brought them to Josue , and to all the children of Israel , and threw them down before the Lord .
DRA	Joshua	7	24	Then Josue and all Israel with him took Achan the son of Zare , and the silver and the garments , and the golden rule , his sons also and his daughters , his oxen and asses and sheep , the tent also , and all the goods : and brought them to the valley of Achor :
DRA	Joshua	7	25	Where Josue said : Because thou hast troubled us , the Lord trouble thee this day . And all Israel stoned him : and all things that were his , were consumed with fire .
DRA	Joshua	7	26	And they gathered together upon him a great heap of stones , which remaineth until this present day . And the wrath of the Lord was turned away from them .

DRA	Joshua	8	8	And when you shall have taken it , set it on fire , and you shall do all things so as I have commanded .
DRA	Joshua	8	1899	American Edition
DRA	Joshua	8	2	And thou shalt do to the city of Hai , and to the king thereof , as thou hast done to Jericho , and to the king thereof : but the spoils and all the cattle you shall take for a prey to yourselves : lay an ambush for the city behind it .
DRA	Joshua	8	3	And Josue arose , and all the army of the fighting men with him , to go up against Hai : and he sent thirty thousand chosen valiant men in the night ,
DRA	Joshua	8	4	And commanded them , saying : Lay an ambush behind the city : and go not very far from it : and be ye all ready .
DRA	Joshua	8	5	But I and the rest of the multitude which is with me ; will approach on the contrary side against the city . And when they shall come out against us , we will flee , and turn our backs , as we did before :
DRA	Joshua	8	6	Till they pursuing us be drawn farther from the city : for they will think that we flee as before .
DRA	Joshua	8	7	And whilst we are fleeing , and they pursuing , you shall arise out of the ambush , and shall destroy the city : and the Lord your God will deliver it into our hands .
DRA	Joshua	8	9	And he sent them away , and they went on to the place of the ambush , and abode between Bethel and Hai , on the west side of the city of Hai . But Josue stayed that night in the midst of the people ,
DRA	Joshua	8	10	And rising early in the morning , he mustered his soldiers , and went up with the ancients in the front of the army environed with the aid of the fighting men .
DRA	Joshua	8	11	And when they were come , and were gone up over against the city , they stood on the north side of the city , between which and them there was a valley in the midst .
DRA	Joshua	8	12	And he had chosen five thousand men , and set them to lie in ambush between Bethel and Hai , on the west side of the same city :
DRA	Joshua	8	13	But all the rest of the army went in battle array on the north side , so that the last of that multitude reached to the west side of the city . So Josue went that night , and stood in the midst of the valley .
DRA	Joshua	8	14	And when the king of Hai saw this , he made haste in the morning , and went out with all the army of the city , and set it in battle array toward the desert , not knowing that there lay an ambush behind his back .
DRA	Joshua	8	15	But Josue , and all Israel gave back , making as if they were afraid , and fleeing by the way of the wilderness .
DRA	Joshua	8	16	But they shouting together , and encouraging one another , pursued them . And when they were come from the city ,
DRA	Joshua	8	17	And not one remained in the city of Hai and of Bethel , that did not pursue after Israel , leaving the towns open as they had rushed out ,
DRA	Joshua	8	18	The Lord said to Josue : Lift up the shield that is in thy hand , towards the city of Hai , for I will deliver it to thee .
DRA	Joshua	8	19	And when he had lifted up his shield towards the city , the ambush that lay hid , rose up immediately : and going to the city , took it and set it on fire .
DRA	Joshua	8	20	And the men of the city , that pursued after Josue , looking back and seeing the smoke of the city rise up to heaven , had no more power to flee this way or that way : especially as they that had counterfeited flight , and were going toward the wilderness , turned back most valiantly against them that pursued .
DRA	Joshua	8	21	So Josue and all Israel seeing that the city was taken , and that the smoke of the city rose up , returned and slew the men of Hai .
DRA	Joshua	8	22	And they also that had taken and set the city on fire , issuing out of the city to meet their own men , began to cut off the enemies who were surrounded by them . So that the enemies being cut off on both sides , not one of so great a multitude was saved .
DRA	Joshua	8	23	And they took the king of the city of Hai alive , and brought him to Josue .
DRA	Joshua	8	24	So all being slain that had pursued after Israel in his flight to the wilderness , and tailing by the sword in the same place , the children of Israel returned and laid waste the city .
DRA	Joshua	8	25	And the number of them that fell that day , both of men and women , was twelve thousand persons all of the city of Hai .

DRA	Joshua	9	2	Gathered themselves together , to fight against Josue and Israel with one mind , and one resolution .
DRA	Joshua	9	3	But they that dwelt in Gabaon , hearing all that Josue had done to Jericho and Hai :
DRA	Joshua	9	4	Cunningly devising took for themselves provisions , laying old sacks upon their asses , and wine bottles rent and sewed up again ,
DRA	Joshua	9	5	And very old shoes , which for a shew of age were clouted with patches , and old garments upon them : the leaves also , which they carried for provisions by the way , were hard , and broken into pieces :
DRA	Joshua	9	6	And they went to Josue , who then abode in the camp at Galgal , and said to him , and to all Israel with him : We are come from a far country , desiring to make peace with you . And the children of Israel answered them , and said :
DRA	Joshua	9	7	Perhaps you dwell in the land which falls to our lot ; if so , we can make no league with you .
DRA	Joshua	9	8	But they said to Josue : We are thy servants . Josue said to them : Who are you ? and whence came you ?
DRA	Joshua	9	10	And to the two kings of the Amorrhites that were beyond the Jordan , Sehon king of Hesebon , and Og king of Basan , that was in Astaroth :
DRA	Joshua	9	11	And our ancients , and all the inhabitants of our country said to us : Take with you victuals for a long way , and go meet them , and say : We are your servants , make ye a league with us .
DRA	Joshua	9	12	Behold , these leaves we took hot , when we set out from our houses to come to you , now they are become dry , and broken in pieces , by being exceeding old .
DRA	Joshua	9	13	These bottles of wine when we filled them were new , now they are rent and burst . These garments we have on , and the shoes we have on our feet , by reason of the very long journey are worn out , and almost consumed .
DRA	Joshua	9	14	They took therefore of their victuals , and consulted not the mouth of the Lord .
DRA	Joshua	9	15	And Josue made peace with them , and entering into a league promised that they should not be slain : the princes also of the multitude swore to them .
DRA	Joshua	9	16	Now three days after the league was made , they heard that they dwelt nigh , and they should be among them .
DRA	Joshua	9	17	And the children of Israel removed the camp , and came into their cities on the third day , the names of which are Gabaon , and Caphira , and Beroth , and Cariathiarim .
DRA	Joshua	9	18	And they slew them not , because the princes of the multitude had sworn in the name of the Lord the God of Israel . Then all the common people murmured against the princes .
DRA	Joshua	9	19	And they answered them : We have sworn to them in the name of the Lord the God of Israel , and therefore we may not touch them .
DRA	Joshua	9	20	But this we mill do to them : Let their lives be saved , lest the wrath of the Lord be stirred up against us , if we should be forsworn .
DRA	Joshua	9	21	But so let them live , as to serve the whole multitude in hewing wood , and bringing in water . As they were speaking these things ,
DRA	Joshua	9	22	Josue called the Gabaonites and said to them : Why would you impose upon us , saying : We dwell far off from you , whereas you are in the midst of us ?
DRA	Joshua	9	23	Therefore you shall be under a curse , and your race shall always be hewers of wood , and carriers of water unto the house of my God .
DRA	Joshua	9	24	They answered : It was told us thy servants , that the Lord thy God had promised his servant Moses to give you all the land , and to destroy all the inhabitants thereof . Therefore we feared exceedingly and provided for our lives . compelled by the dread we had of you and we took this counsel .
DRA	Joshua	9	25	And now we are in thy hand : deal with us as it seemeth good and right unto thee .
DRA	Joshua	9	26	So Josue did as he had said , and delivered them from the hand of the children of Israel , that they should not be slain .
DRA	Joshua	9	27	And he gave orders in that day that they should be in the service of all the people , and of the altar of the Lord , hewing wood and carrying water , until this present time , in the place which the Lord hath chosen . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )

DRA	Joshua	10	1899	American Edition
DRA	Joshua	10	2	He was exceedingly afraid . For Gabaon was a great city , and one of the royal cities , and greater than the town of Hai , and all its fighting men were most valiant .
DRA	Joshua	10	3	Therefore Adonisedec king of Jerusalem sent to Oham king of Hebron , and to Pharam king of Jerimoth , and to Japhia king of Lachis , and to Dabir king of Eglon , saying :
DRA	Joshua	10	4	Come up to me , and bring help , that we may take Gabaon , because it hath gone over to Josue , and to the children of Israel .
DRA	Joshua	10	5	So the five kings of the Amorrhites being assembled together went up : the king of Jerusalem , the king of Hebron , the king of Jerimoth , the king of Lachis , the king of Eglon , they and their armies , and camped about Gabaon , laying siege to it .
DRA	Joshua	10	6	But the inhabitants of the city of Gabaon which was besieged , sent to Josue , who then abode in the camp at Galgal , and said to him : Withdraw not thy hands from helping thy servants : come up quickly and save us , and bring us succour : for all the kings of the Amorrhites , who dwell in the mountains , are gathered together against us .
DRA	Joshua	10	7	And Josue went up from Galgal , and all the army of the warriors with him , most valiant men .
DRA	Joshua	10	8	And the Lord said to Josue : Fear them not : for I have delivered them into thy hands : none of them shall be able to stand against thee .
DRA	Joshua	10	9	So Josue going up from Galgal all the night , came upon them suddenly .
DRA	Joshua	10	11	And when they were fleeing from the children of Israel , and were in the descent of Beth-horon , the Lord cast down upon them great stones from heaven as far as Azeca : and many more were killed with the hailstones than were slain by the swords of the children of Israel .
DRA	Joshua	10	12	Then Josue spoke to the Lord , in the day that he delivered the Amorrhite in the sight of the children of Israel , and he said before them : Move not , O sun , toward Gabaon , nor thou , O moon , toward the valley of Ajalon .
DRA	Joshua	10	13	And the sun and the moon stood still , till the people revenged themselves of their enemies . Is not this written in the book of the just ? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven , and hasted not to go down the space of one day .
DRA	Joshua	10	14	There was not before nor after so long a day , the Lord obeying the voice of a man , and fighting for Israel .
DRA	Joshua	10	15	And Josue returned with all Israel into the camp of Galgal .
DRA	Joshua	10	16	For the five kings were fled , and had hidden themselves in a cave of the city of Maceda .
DRA	Joshua	10	17	And it was told Josue that the five kings were found hidden in a cave of the city of Maceda .
DRA	Joshua	10	18	And he commanded them that were with him , saying : Roll great stones to the mouth of the cave , and set careful men , to keep them shut up :
DRA	Joshua	10	19	And stay you not , but pursue after the enemies , and kill all the hindermost of them as they flee , and do not suffer them whom the Lord God hath delivered into your hands to shelter themselves in their cities .
DRA	Joshua	10	20	So the enemies being slain with a great slaughter , and almost utterly consumed , they that were able to escape from Israel , entered into fenced cities .
DRA	Joshua	10	21	And all the army returned to Josue in Maceda , where the camp then was , in good health and without the loss of any one : and no man durst move his tongue against the children of Israel .
DRA	Joshua	10	22	And Josue gave orders , saying : Open the mouth of the cave , and bring forth to me the five kings that lie hid therein .
DRA	Joshua	10	23	And the ministers did as they were commanded : and they brought out to him the five kings out of the cave : the king of Jerusalem , the king of Hebron , the king of Jerimoth , the king of Lachis , the king of Eglon .
DRA	Joshua	10	24	And when they were Drought out to him , he called all the men of Israel , and said to the chiefs of the army that were with him : Go , and set your feet on the necks of these kings . And when they had gone , and put their feet upon the necks of them lying under them ,
DRA	Joshua	10	25	He said again to them : Fear not , neither be ye dismayed , take courage and be strong : for so will the Lord do to all your enemies , against whom you fight .
DRA	Joshua	10	26	And Josue struck , and slew them , and hanged them upon five gibbets , and they hung until the evening .
DRA	Joshua	10	27	And when the sun was down , he commanded the soldiers to take them down from the gibbets . And after they were taken down , they cast them into the cave where they had lain hid , and put great stones at the mouth thereof , which remain until this day .
DRA	Joshua	10	28	The same day Josue took Maceda and destroyed it , with the edge of the sword , and killed the king and all the inhabitants thereof : he left not in it the least remains . And he did to the king of Maceda , as he had done to the king of Jericho .
DRA	Joshua	10	29	And he passed from Maceda with all Israel to Lebna , and fought against it :
DRA	Joshua	10	30	And the Lord delivered it with the king thereof into the hands of Israel : and they destroyed the city with the edge of the sword , and all the inhabitants thereof . They left not in it any remains . And they did to the king of Lebna , as they had done to the king of Jericho .
DRA	Joshua	10	31	From Lebna he passed unto Lachis , with all Israel : and investing it with his army , besieged it .
DRA	Joshua	10	32	And the Lord delivered Lachis into the hands of Israel , and he took it the following day , and put it to the sword , and every soul that was in it , as he had done to Lebna .
DRA	Joshua	10	33	At that time Horam king of Gazer , came up to succour Lachis : and Josue slew him with all his people , so as to leave none alive .

DRA	Joshua	10	35	And took it the same day : and put to the sword all the souls that were in it , according to all that he had done to Lachis .
DRA	Joshua	10	36	He went up also with all Israel from Eglon to Hebron , and fought against it :
DRA	Joshua	10	37	Took it , and destroyed it with the edge of the sword : the king also thereof , and all the towns of that country , and all the souls that dwelt in it : he left not therein any remains : as he had done to Eglon , so did he also to Hebron , putting to the sword all that he found in it .
DRA	Joshua	10	38	Returning from thence to Dabir ,
DRA	Joshua	10	39	He took it and destroyed it : the king also thereof and all the towns round about he destroyed with the edge of the sword : he left not in it any remains : as he had done to Hebron and Lebna and to their kings , so did he to Dabir and to the king thereof .

DRA	Joshua	11	5	And all these kings assembled together at the waters of Merom , to fight against Israel .

DRA	Joshua	11	19	There was hot a city that delivered itself to the children of Israel , except the Hevite , who dwelt in Gabaon : for he took all by fight .

DRA	Joshua	22	2	And said to them : You have done all that Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you : you have also obeyed me in all things ,
DRA	Joshua	22	3	Neither have you left your brethren this long time , until this present day , keeping the commandment of the Lord your God .
DRA	Joshua	22	4	Therefore as the Lord your God hath given your brethren rest and peace , as he promised : return , and go to your dwellings , and to the land of your possession , which Moses the servant of the Lord gave you beyond the Jordan :
DRA	Joshua	22	5	Yet so that you observe attentively , and in work fulfill the commandment and the law which Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you : that you love the Lord your God , and walk in all his ways , and keep all his commandments , and cleave to him , and serve him with all your heart , and with all your soul .
DRA	Joshua	22	6	And Josue blessed them , and sent them away , and they returned to their dwellings .
DRA	Joshua	22	7	Now to half the tribe of Manasses , Moses had given a possession in Basan : and therefore to the half that remained , Josue gave a lot among the rest of their brethren beyond the Jordan to the west . And when he sent them away to their dwellings and had blessed them ,

DRA	Joshua	22	9	So the children of Ruben , and the children of Gad , and the half tribe of Manasses returned , and parted from the children of Israel in Silo , which is in Chanaan , to go into Galaad the land of their possession , which they had obtained according to the commandment of the Lord by the hand of Moses .
DRA	Joshua	22	10	And when they were come to the banks of the Jordan , in the land of Chanaan , they built an altar immensely great near the Jordan .
DRA	Joshua	22	11	And when the children of Israel had heard of it , and certain messengers had brought them an account that the children of Ruben , and of Cad , and the half tribe of Manasses had built an altar in the land of Chanaan , upon the banks of the Jordan , over against the children of Israel :
DRA	Joshua	22	12	They all assembled in Silo , to go up and fight against them .
DRA	Joshua	22	13	And in the mean time they sent to them into the land of Galaad , Phinees the son of Eleazar the priest ,
DRA	Joshua	22	14	And ten princes with him , one of every tribe .
DRA	Joshua	22	15	Who came to the children of Ruben , and of Gad , and the half tribe of Manasses , into the land of Galaad , and said to them :
DRA	Joshua	22	16	Thus saith all the people of the Lord : What meaneth this transgression ? Why have you forsaken the Lord the God of Israel , building a sacrilegious altar , and revolting from the worship of him ?
DRA	Joshua	22	17	Is it a small thing to you that you sinned with Beelphegor , and the stain of that crime remaineth in us to this day ? and many of the people perished .
DRA	Joshua	22	18	And you have forsaken the Lord to day , and to morrow his wrath will rage against all Israel .
DRA	Joshua	22	19	But if you think the land of your possession to be unclean , pass over to the land wherein is the tabernacle of the Lord , and dwell among us : only depart not from the Lord , and from our society , by building an altar beside the altar of the Lord our God .
DRA	Joshua	22	20	Did not Achan the son of Zare transgress the commandment of the Lord , and his wrath lay upon all the people of Israel ? And he was but one man , and would to God he alone had perished in his wickedness .
DRA	Joshua	22	21	And the children of Ruben , and of Gad , and of the half tribe of Manasses answered the princes of the embassage of Israel :
DRA	Joshua	22	23	And if we did it with that mind , that we might lay upon it holocausts , and sacrifice , and victims of peace offerings , let him require and judge :
DRA	Joshua	22	24	And not rather with this thought and design , that we should say : To morrow your children will say to our children : What have you to do with the Lord the God of Israel ?
DRA	Joshua	22	25	The Lord hath put the river Jordan for a border between us and you , O ye children of Ruben , and ye children of Gad : and therefore you have no part in the Lord . And by this occasion you children shall turn away our children from the fear of the Lord . We therefore thought , it best ,
DRA	Joshua	22	26	And said : Let us build us an altar , not for holocausts , nor to offer victims ,
DRA	Joshua	22	27	But for a testimony between us and you , and our posterity and yours , that we may serve the Lord , and that we may have a right to offer both holocausts , and victims and sacrifices of peace offerings : and that your children to morrow may not say to our children : You have no part in the Lord .
DRA	Joshua	22	28	And if they will say so , they shall answer them : Behold the altar of the Lord , which our fathers made , not for holocausts , nor for sacrifice , but for a testimony between us and you .
DRA	Joshua	22	29	God keep us from any such wickedness that we should revolt from the Lord , and leave off following his steps , by building an altar to offer holocausts , and sacrifices , and victims , beside the altar of the Lord our God , which is erected before his tabernacle .
DRA	Joshua	22	30	And when Phinees the priest , and the princes of the embassage , who were with him , had heard this , they were satisfied : and they admitted most willingly the words of the children of Ruben , and Gad , and of the half tribe of Manasses .
DRA	Joshua	22	31	And Phinees the priest the son of Eleazar said to them : Now we know that the Lord is with us , because you are not guilty of this revolt , and you have delivered the children of Israel from the hand of the Lord .
DRA	Joshua	22	32	And he returned with the princes from the children of Ruben and Gad , out of the land of Galaad , into the land of Chanaan , to the children of Israel , and brought them word again .
DRA	Joshua	22	33	And the saying pleased all that heard it . And the children of Israel praised God , and they no longer said that they would go up against them , and fight , and destroy the land of their possession .
DRA	Joshua	22	34	And the children of Ruben , and the children of Cad called the altar which they had built , Our testimony , that the Lord is God . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )

DRA	Joshua	23	6	Only take courage , and be careful to observe all things that are written in the book of the law of Moses : and turn not aside from them neither to the right hand nor to the left :
DRA	Joshua	23	7	Lest after that you are come in among the Gentiles , who will remain among you , you should swear by the name of their gods , and serve them , and adore them :
DRA	Joshua	23	8	But cleave ye unto the Lord your God : as you have done until this day .
DRA	Joshua	23	9	And then the Lord God will take away before your eyes nations that are great and very strong , and no man shall be able to resist you .
DRA	Joshua	23	10	One of you shall chase a thousand men of the enemies : because the Lord your God himself will fight for you , as he hath promised .
DRA	Joshua	23	11	This only take care of with all diligence , that you love the Lord your God .
DRA	Joshua	23	12	But if you will embrace the errors of these nations that dwell among you , and make marriages with them , and join friendships :
DRA	Joshua	23	13	Know ye for a certainty that the Lord your God will not destroy them before your face , but they shall be a pit and a snare in your way , and a stumblingblock at your side , and stakes in your eyes , till he take you away and destroy you from off this excellent land , which he hath given you .
DRA	Joshua	23	14	Behold this day I am going into the way of all the earth , and you shall know with all your mind that of all the words which the Lord promised to perform for you , not one hath failed .
DRA	Joshua	23	15	Therefore as he hath fulfilled in deed , what he promised , and all things prosperous have come : so Will he bring upon you all the evils he hath threatened , till he take you away and destroy you from off this excellent land , which he hath given you ,
DRA	Joshua	23	16	When you shall have transgressed the covenant of the Lord your God , which he hath made with you , and shall have served strange gods , and adored them : then shall the indignation of the Lord rise up quickly and speedily against you , and you shall be taken away from this excellent land , which he hath delivered to you .

DRA	Judges	3	21	And Aod put forth his left hand , and took the dagger from his right thigh , and thrust it into his belly ,
DRA	Judges	3	22	With such force that the haft went in after the blade into the wound , and was closed up with the abundance of fat .

DRA	Judges	3	23	But Aod carefully shutting the doors of the parlour and locking them ,
DRA	Judges	3	24	Went out by a postern door . And the king 's servants going in , saw the doors of the parlour shut , and they said : Perhaps he is easing nature in his summer parlour .

DRA	Judges	6	2	And they were grievously oppressed by them . And they made themselves dens and eaves in the mountains , and strong holds to resist .
DRA	Judges	6	3	And when Israel had sown , Madian and Amalec , and the rest of the eastern nations came up :
DRA	Judges	6	4	And pitching their tents among them , wasted all things as they were in the blade even to the entrance of Gaza : and they left nothing at all in Israel for sustenance of life , nor sheep , nor oxen , nor asses .
DRA	Judges	6	5	For they and all their flocks came with their tents , and like locusts filled all places , an innumerable multitude of men , and of camels , wasting whatsoever they touched .

DRA	Judges	6	13	And Gedeon said to him : I beseech thee , my lord , if the Lord be with us , why have these evils fallen upon us ? Where are his miracles , which our fathers have told us of , saying : The Lord brought us Out of Egypt ? but now the Lord hath forsaken us , and delivered us into the bands of Madian .
DRA	Judges	6	14	And the Lord looked upon him , and said : Go in this thy strength , and thou shalt deliver Israel out of the hand of Madian : know that I have sent thee .
DRA	Judges	6	15	He answered and said : I beseech thee , my lord , wherewith shall I deliver Israel ? Behold my family is the meanest in Manasses , and I am the least in my father 's house .

DRA	Judges	6	31	He answered them : Are you the avengers of Baal , that you fight for him ? he that is his adversary , let him die before to morrow light appear : if he be a god , let him revenge himself on him that hath cast down his altar .
DRA	Judges	6	32	From that day Gedeon was called Jerobaal , because Joss had said : Let Baal revenge himself on him that hath cast down his altar .

DRA	Judges	6	36	And Gedeon said to God : If thou wilt save Israel by my hand , as thou hast said ,
DRA	Judges	6	37	I will put this fleece of wool on the floor : if there be dew on the fleece only , and it be dry on all the ground beside , I , shall know that by my hand , as thou hast said , thou wilt deliver Israel .
DRA	Judges	6	38	And it was so . And rising before day wringing the fleece , he filled a vessel with the dew .
DRA	Judges	6	39	And he said again to God : let not thy wrath be kindled against me if I try once more , seeking a sign in the fleece . I pray that the fleece only may be dry , and all the ground wet with dew .

DRA	Judges	9	4	And they gave him seventy weight of silver out of the temple of Baalberith : wherewith he hired to himself men that were needy , and vagabonds , and they followed him .
DRA	Judges	9	5	And he came to his father 's house in Ephra , and slew his brethren the sons of Jerobaal , seventy men , upon one stone : and there remained only Joatham the youngest son of Jerobaal , who was hidden .
DRA	Judges	9	6	And all the men of Sichem were gathered together , and all the families of the city of Mello : and they went and made Abimelech king , by the oak that stood in Sichem .
DRA	Judges	9	7	This being told to Joatham , he went and stood on the top of mount Garizim : and lifting up his voice , he cried , and said : Hear me , ye men of Sichem , so may God hear you .
DRA	Judges	9	8	The trees went to anoint a king over them : and they said to the olive tree : Reign thou over us .
DRA	Judges	9	10	And the trees said to the fig tree : Come thou and reign over us .
DRA	Judges	9	11	And it answered them : Can I leave my sweetness , and my delicious fruits , and go to be promoted among the other trees ?
DRA	Judges	9	12	And the trees said to the vine : Come thou and reign over us .
DRA	Judges	9	13	And it answered them : Can I forsake my wine , that cheereth God and men , and be promoted among the other trees ?
DRA	Judges	9	14	And all the trees said to the bramble : Come thou and reign over us .
DRA	Judges	9	15	And it answered them : If indeed you mean to make me king , come ye and rest under my shadow : but if you mean it not , let fire come out from the bramble , and devour the cedars of Libanus .
DRA	Judges	9	16	Now therefore if you have done well , and without sin in appointing Abimelech king over you , and have dealt well with Jerobaal , and with his house , and have made a suitable return for the benefits of him , who fought for you ,
DRA	Judges	9	17	And exposed his life to dangers , to deliver you from the hands of Madian ,
DRA	Judges	9	18	And you are now risen up against my father 's house , and have killed his sons seventy men upon one stone , and have made Abimelech the son of his handmaid king over the inhabitants of Sichem , because he is your brother :
DRA	Judges	9	19	If therefore you have dealt well , and without fault with Jerobaal , and his house , rejoice ye this day in Abimelech , and may he rejoice in you .
DRA	Judges	9	20	But if unjustly : let fire come out from him , and consume the inhabitants of Sichem , and the town of Mello : and let fire come out from the men of Sichem , and from the town of Mello , and devour Abimelech .
DRA	Judges	9	21	And when he had said thus he fled , and went into Bera : and dwelt there for fear of Abimelech his brother .
DRA	Judges	9	22	So Abimelech reigned over Israel for three years .
DRA	Judges	9	23	And the Lord sent a very evil spirit between Abimelech and the inhabitants of Sichem : who began to detest him ,
DRA	Judges	9	24	And to leave the crime of the murder of the seventy sons of Jerobaal , and the shedding of their blood upon Abimelech their brother , and upon the rest of the princes of the Sichemites , who aided him .
DRA	Judges	9	25	And they set an ambush against him on the top of the mountains : and while they waited for his coming , they committed robberies , taking spoils of all that passed by : and it was told Abimelech .
DRA	Judges	9	26	And Gaal the son of Obed came with his brethren , and went over to Sichem . And the inhabitants of Sichem taking courage at his coming ,
DRA	Judges	9	27	Went out into the fields , wasting the vineyards , and treading down the grapes : and singing and dancing they went into the temple of their god , and in their banquets and cups they cursed Abimelech .
DRA	Judges	9	28	And Gaal the son of Obed cried : Who is Abimelech , and what is Sichem , that we should serve him ? Is he not the son of Jerobaal , and hath made Zebul his servant ruler over the men of Emor the father of Sichem ? Why then shall we serve him ?
DRA	Judges	9	29	Would to God that some man would put this people under my hand , that I might remove Abimelech out of the way . And it was said to Abimelech : Gather together the multitude of an army , and come .
DRA	Judges	9	30	For Zebul the ruler of the city , hearing the words of Gaal , the son of Obed , was very angry ,
DRA	Judges	9	31	And sent messengers privately to Abimelech , saying : Behold Gaal the son of Obed is come into Sichem with his brethren , and endeavoureth to set the city against thee .
DRA	Judges	9	32	Arise therefore in the night with the people that is with thee and he hid in the field :
DRA	Judges	9	33	And betimes in the morning at sun rising set upon the city . And when he shall come out against thee with his people , do to him what thou shalt be able .
DRA	Judges	9	34	Abimelech therefore arose with all his army by night , and laid ambushes near Sichem in four places .
DRA	Judges	9	35	And Gaal the son of Obed went out , and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city . And Abimelech rose up , and all his army with him from the places of the ambushes .
DRA	Judges	9	36	And when Gaal saw the people , he said to Zebul : Behold a multitude cometh down from the mountains . And he answered him : Thou seest the shadows of the mountains as if they were the heads of men , and this is thy mistake .
DRA	Judges	9	37	Again Gaal said : Behold there cometh people down from the middle of the land , and one troop cometh by the way that looketh towards the oak .
DRA	Judges	9	38	And Zebul said to him : Where is now thy mouth wherewith thou saidst ? Who is Abimelech that we should serve him ? Is not this the people which thou didst despise ? Go out , and fight against him .
DRA	Judges	9	39	So Gaal went out in the sight of the people of Sichem , and fought against Abimelech ,
DRA	Judges	9	40	Who chased and put him to flight , and drove him to the city : and many were slain of his people , even to the gate of the city :
DRA	Judges	9	41	And Abimelech sat down in Ruma : but Zebul drove Gaal , and his companions out of the city , and would not suffer them to abide in it .
DRA	Judges	9	42	So the day following the people went out into the field . And it was told Abimelech .
DRA	Judges	9	43	And he took his army , and divided it into three companies , and laid ambushes in the fields . And seeing that the people came out of the city , he arose and set upon them ,
DRA	Judges	9	44	With his own company , assaulting and besieging the city : whilst the two other companies chased the enemies that were scattered about the field .
DRA	Judges	9	45	And Abimelech assaulted the city all that day : and took it , and killed the inhabitants thereof , and demolished it , so that he sowed salt in it .
DRA	Judges	9	46	And when they who dwelt in the tower of Sichem had heard this , they went into the temple of their god Berith where they had made a covenant with him , and from thence the place had taken its name , and it was exceeding strong .
DRA	Judges	9	47	Abimelech also hearing that the men of the tower of Sichem were gathered together ,
DRA	Judges	9	48	Went up into mount Selmon he and all his people with him : and taking an axe , he cut down the bough of a tree , and laying it on his shoulder and carrying it , he said to his companions : What you see me do , do you out of hand .
DRA	Judges	9	49	So they cut down boughs from the trees , every man as fast as he could , and followed their leader . And surrounding the fort they set it on fire : and so it came to pass that with the smoke and with the fire a thousand persons were killed , men and women together , of the inhabitants of the tower of Sichem .
DRA	Judges	9	50	Then Abimelech departing from thence came to the town of Thebes , which he surrounded and besieged with his army .
DRA	Judges	9	51	And there was in the midst of the city a high tower , to which both the men and the women were fled together , and all the princes of the city , and having shut and strongly barred the gate , they stood upon the battlements of the tower to defend themselves .
DRA	Judges	9	52	And Abimelech coming near the tower , fought stoutly : and approaching to the gate , endeavoured to set fire to it :
DRA	Judges	9	53	And behold a certain woman casting a piece of a millstone from above , dashed it against the head of Abimelech , and broke his skull .
DRA	Judges	9	54	And he called hastily to his armourbearer , and said to him : Draw thy sword , and kill me : lest it should be said that I was slain by a woman . He did as he was commanded , and slew him .
DRA	Judges	9	55	And when he was dead , all the men of Israel that were with him , returned to their homes .
DRA	Judges	9	56	And God repaid the evil , that Abimelech had done against his father , killing his seventy brethren .
DRA	Judges	9	57	The Sichemites also were rewarded for what they had done , and the curse of Joatham the son of Jerobaal came upon them . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )

DRA	Judges	10	4	Having thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts , and were princes of thirty cities , which from his name were called Havoth Jair , that is , the towns of Jair , until this present day in the land of Galaad .
DRA	Judges	10	5	And Jair died : and was buried in the place which was called Camon .
DRA	Judges	10	6	But the children of Israel , adding new sins to their old ones , did evil in the sight of the Lord , and served idols , Baalim and Astaroth , and the gods of Syria and of Sidon and of Moab and of the children of Ammon and of the Philistines : and they left the Lord , and did not serve him .
DRA	Judges	10	7	And the Lord being angry with them , delivered them into the hands of the Philistines and of the children of Ammon .
DRA	Judges	10	8	And they were afflicted , and grievously oppressed for eighteen years , all they that dwelt beyond the Jordan in the land of the Amorrhite , who is in Galaad :
DRA	Judges	10	9	Insomuch that the children of Ammon passing over the Jordan , wasted Juda and Benjamin and Ephraim : and Israel was distressed exceedingly .
DRA	Judges	10	11	And the Lord said to them : Did not the Egyptians and the Amorrhites , and the children of Ammon and the Philistines ,
DRA	Judges	10	12	The Sidonians also and Amalec and Chanaan oppress you , and you cried to me , and I delivered you out of their hand ?
DRA	Judges	10	13	And yet you have forsaken me , and have worshipped strange gods : therefore I will deliver you no more :
DRA	Judges	10	14	Go and call upon the gods which you have chosen : let them deliver you in the time of distress .
DRA	Judges	10	15	And the children of Israel said to the Lord : We have sinned , do thou unto us whatsoever pleaseth thee : only deliver us this time .

DRA	Judges	11	11	Jephte therefore went with the princes of Galaad , and all the people made him their prince . And Jephte spoke all his words before the Lord in Maspha .
DRA	Judges	11	1899	American Edition
DRA	Judges	11	2	Now Galaad had a wife of whom he had sons : who after they were grown up , thrust out Jephte , saying : Thou canst not inherit in the house of our father , because thou art born of another mother .
DRA	Judges	11	3	Then he fled and avoided them and dwelt in the land of Tob : and there were gathered to him needy men , and robbers , and they followed him as their prince .
DRA	Judges	11	4	In those days the children of Ammon made war against Israel .
DRA	Judges	11	5	And as they pressed hard upon them , the ancients of Galaad went to fetch Jephte out of the land of Tob to help them :
DRA	Judges	11	6	And they said to him : Come thou and be our prince , and fight against the children of Ammon .
DRA	Judges	11	7	And he answered them : Are not you the men that hated me , and cast me out of my father 's house , and now you are come to me constrained by necessity ?
DRA	Judges	11	8	And the princes of Galaad said to Jephte : For this cause we are now come to thee , that thou mayst go with us , and fight against the children of Ammon , and be head over all the inhabitants of Galaad .
DRA	Judges	11	9	Jephte also said to them : If you be come to me sincerely , that I should fight for you against the children of Ammon , and the Lord shall deliver them into my band , shall I be your prince ?
DRA	Judges	11	10	They answered him : The Lord who heareth these things , he himself is mediator and witness that we will do as we have promised .
DRA	Judges	11	12	And he sent messengers to the king of the children of Ammon , to say in his name , What hast thou to do with me , that thou art come against me , to waste my land ?
DRA	Judges	11	13	And he answered them : I Because Israel took away my land when he came up out of Egypt , from the confines of the Arnon unto the Jaboc and the Jordan : now therefore restore the same peaceably to me .
DRA	Judges	11	14	And Jephte again sent word by them , and commanded them to say to the king of Ammon :
DRA	Judges	11	15	Thus saith Jephte : Israel did not take away the land of Moab , nor the land of the children of Ammon :
DRA	Judges	11	16	But when they came up out of Egypt , he walked through the desert to the Red Sea and came into Cades .
DRA	Judges	11	17	And he sent messengers to the king of Edom , saying : Suffer me to pass through thy land . But he would not condescend to his request . He sent also to the king of Moab , who likewise refused to give him passage . He abode therefore in Cades ,
DRA	Judges	11	18	And went round the land of Edom at the side , and the land of Moab : and came over against the east coast of the land of Moab , and camped on the other side of the Arnon : and he would not enter the bounds of Moab .
DRA	Judges	11	19	So Israel sent messengers to Sehon king of the Amorrhites , who dwelt in Hesebon , and they said to him : Suffer me to pass through thy land to the river .
DRA	Judges	11	20	But he also despising the words of Israel , suffered him not to pass through his borders : but gathering an infinite multitude , went out against him to Jasa , and made strong opposition .
DRA	Judges	11	21	And the Lord delivered him with all his army into the hands of Israel , and he slew him , and possessed all the land of the Amorrhite the inhabitant of that country ,
DRA	Judges	11	22	And all the coasts thereof from the Arnon to the Jaboc , and from the wilderness to the Jordan .
DRA	Judges	11	23	So the Lord the God of Israel destroyed the Amorrhite , his people of Israel fighting against him , and wilt thou now possess this land ?
DRA	Judges	11	24	Are not those things which thy god Chamos possesseth , due to thee by right ? But what the Lord our God hath obtained by conquest , shall be our possession :
DRA	Judges	11	25	Unless perhaps thou art better than Balac the son of Sephor king of Moab : or canst shew that he strove against Israel and fought against him ,
DRA	Judges	11	26	Whereas he hath dwelt in Hesebon , and the villages thereof , and in Aroer , and its villages , and in all the cities near the Jordan , for three hundred years . Why have you for so long a time attempted nothing about this claim ?
DRA	Judges	11	27	Therefore I do not trespass against thee , but thou wrongest me by declaring an unjust war against me . The Lord be judge and decide this day between Israel and the children of Ammon .
DRA	Judges	11	28	And the king of the children of Ammon would not hearken to the words of Jephte , which he sent him by the messengers .
DRA	Judges	11	29	Therefore the spirit of the Lord came upon Jephte , and going round Galaad , and Manasses , and Maspha of Galaad , and passing over from thence to the children of Ammon ,
DRA	Judges	11	30	He made a vow to the Lord , saying : If thou wilt deliver the children of Ammon into my hands ,
DRA	Judges	11	31	Whosoever shall first come forth out of the doors of my house , and shall meet me when I return in peace from the children of Ammon , the same will I offer a holocaust to the Lord .
DRA	Judges	11	32	And Jephte passed over to the children of Ammon , to fight against them : and the Lord delivered them into his hands .
DRA	Judges	11	33	And he smote them from Aroer till you come to Mennith , twenty cities , and as far as Abel , which is set with vineyards , with a very great slaughter : and the children of Ammon were humbled by the children of Israel .
DRA	Judges	11	34	And when Jephte returned into Maspha to his house , his only daughter met him with timbrels and with dances : for he had no other children .
DRA	Judges	11	35	And when he saw her , he rent his garments , and said : Alas ! my daughter , thou hast deceived me , and thou thyself art deceived : for I have opened my mouth to the Lord , and I can do no other thing .
DRA	Judges	11	36	And she answered him : My father , if thou hast opened thy mouth to the Lord , do unto me whatsoever thou hast promised , since the victory hath been granted to thee , and revenge of thy enemies .
DRA	Judges	11	37	And she said to her father : Grant me only this which I desire : Let me go , that I may go about the mountains for two months , and may bewail my virginity with my companions .
DRA	Judges	11	38	And he answered her : Go . And he sent her away for two months . And when she was gone with her comrades and companions , she mourned her virginity in the mountains .
DRA	Judges	11	39	And the two months being expired , she returned to her father , and he did to her as he had vowed , and she knew no man . From thence came a fashion in Israel , and a custom has been kept :

DRA	Judges	12	3	And when I saw this , I put my life in my own hands , and passed over against the children of Ammon , and the Lord delivered them into my hands . What have I deserved , that you should rise up to fight against me ?
DRA	Judges	12	4	Then calling to him all the men of Galaad , he fought against Ephraim : and the men of Galaad defeated Ephraim , because he had said : Galaad is a fugitive of Ephraim , and dwelleth in the midst of Ephraim and Manasses .
DRA	Judges	12	5	And the Galaadites secured the fords of the Jordan , by which Ephraim was to return . And when any one of the number of Ephraim came thither in the flight , and said : I beseech you let me pass : the Galaadites said to him : Art thou not an Ephraimite ? If he said : I am not :
DRA	Judges	12	6	They asked him : Say then , Scibboleth , which is interpreted , An ear of corn . But he answered , Sibboleth , not being able to express an ear of corn by the same letter . Then presently they took him and killed him in the very passage of the Jordan . And there fell at that time of Ephraim two and forty thousand .

DRA	Judges	13	13	And the angel of the Lord said to Manue : From all the things I have spoken of to thy wife , let her refrain herself :
DRA	Judges	13	1899	American Edition
DRA	Judges	13	2	Now there was a certain man of Saraa , and of the race of Dan , whose name was Manue , and his wife was barren .
DRA	Judges	13	3	And an angel of the Lord appeared to her , and said : Thou art barren and without children : but thou shalt conceive and bear a son .
DRA	Judges	13	4	Now therefore beware and drink no wine nor strong drink , and eat not any unclean thing .
DRA	Judges	13	5	Because thou shalt conceive and bear a son , and no razor shall touch his head : for he shall be a Nazarite of God , from his infancy , and from his mother 's womb , and he shall begin to deliver Israel from the hands of the Philistines .
DRA	Judges	13	6	And when she was come to her husband she said to him : A man of God came to me , having the countenance of an angel , very awful . And when I asked him who he was , and whence he came , and by what name he was called , he would not tell me .
DRA	Judges	13	7	But he answered thus : Behold thou shalt conceive and bear a son : beware thou drink no wine , nor strong drink , nor eat any unclean thing : for the child shall be a Nazarite of God from his infancy , from his mother 's womb until the day of his death .
DRA	Judges	13	8	Then Manue prayed to the Lord , and said : I beseech thee , O Lord , that the mail of God , whom thou didst send , may come again , and teach us what we ought to do concerning the child that shall be born .
DRA	Judges	13	9	And the Lord heard the prayer of Manue , and the angel of the Lord appeared again to his wife as she was sitting in the field . But Manue her husband was not with her . And when she saw the angel ,
DRA	Judges	13	10	She made haste and ran to her husband : and told him saying : Behold the man hath appeared to me whom I saw before .
DRA	Judges	13	11	He rose up and followed his wife : and coming to the man , said to him : Art thou he that spoke to the woman ? And he answered : I am .
DRA	Judges	13	12	And Manue said to him : When thy word shall come to pass , what wilt thou that the child should do ? or from what shall he keep himself ?
DRA	Judges	13	14	And let her eat nothing that cometh of the vine , neither let her drink wine or strong drink , nor eat any unclean thing : and whatsoever I have commanded her , let her fulfill and observe .
DRA	Judges	13	15	And Manue said to the angel of the Lord : I beseech thee to consent to my request , and let us dress a kid for thee .
DRA	Judges	13	16	And the angel answered him : If thou press me , I will not eat of thy bread : but if thou wilt offer a holocaust , offer it to the Lord . And Manue knew not it was the angel of the Lord .
DRA	Judges	13	17	And he said to him : What is thy name , that , if thy word shall come to pass , we may honour thee ?
DRA	Judges	13	18	And he answered him : Why askest thou my name , which is wonderful ?
DRA	Judges	13	19	Then Manue took a kid of the flocks , and the libations , and put them upon a rock , offering to the Lord , who doth wonderful things : and he and his wife looked on .
DRA	Judges	13	20	And when the flame from the altar went up towards heaven , the angel of the lord ascended also in the flame . And when Manue and his wife saw this , they fell flat on the ground .
DRA	Judges	13	21	And the angel of the Lord appeared to them no more . And forthwith Manue understood that it was an angel of the Lord ,
DRA	Judges	13	22	And he said to his wife : We shall certainly die , because we have seen God .
DRA	Judges	13	23	And his wife answered him : If the Lord had a mind to kill us , he would not have received a holocaust and libations at our hands , neither would he have shewed us all these things , nor have told us the things that are to come .
DRA	Judges	13	24	And she bore a son , and called his name Samson . And the child grew , and the Lord blessed him .

DRA	Judges	14	1899	American Edition
DRA	Judges	14	2	He came up , and told his father and his mother , saying : I saw a woman in Thamnatha of the daughters of the Philistines : I beseech you , take her for me to wife .
DRA	Judges	14	3	And his father and mother said to him : Is there no woman among the daughters of thy brethren , or among all my people , that thou wilt take a wife of the Philistines , who are uncircumcised ? And Samson said to his father : Take this woman for me , for she hath pleased my eyes .
DRA	Judges	14	4	Now his parents knew not that the thing was done by the Lord , and that he sought an occasion against the Philistines : for at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel .
DRA	Judges	14	5	Then Samson went down with his father and mother to Thamnatha . And when they were come to the vineyards of the town , behold a young lion met him raging and roaring .
DRA	Judges	14	6	And the spirit of the Lord came upon Samson , and he tore the lion as he would have torn a kid in pieces , having nothing at all in his hand : and he would not tell this to his father and mother .
DRA	Judges	14	7	And he went down and spoke to the woman that had pleased his eyes .
DRA	Judges	14	8	And after some days returning to take her , he went aside to see the carcass of the lion , and behold there was a swarm of bees in the mouth of the lion and a honeycomb .
DRA	Judges	14	9	And when be had taken it in his hands , he went on eating : and coming to his father and mother , he gave them of it , and they ate : but he would not tell them , that he had taken the honey from the body of the lion .
DRA	Judges	14	10	So his father went down to the woman , and made a feast for his son Samson : for so the young men used to do .
DRA	Judges	14	11	And when the citizens of that place saw him , they brought him thirty companions to be with him .
DRA	Judges	14	12	And Samson said to them : I will propose to you a riddle , which if you declare unto me within the seven days of the feast , I will give you thirty shirts , and as many coats :
DRA	Judges	14	13	But if you shall not be able to declare it , you shall give me thirty shirts and the same number of coats . They answered him : Put forth the riddle that we may hear it .
DRA	Judges	14	15	And when the seventh day came , they said to the wife of Samson : Soothe thy husband , and persuade him to tell thee what the riddle meaneth . But if thou wilt not do it , we will burn thee , and thy father 's house . Have you called us to the wedding on purpose to strip us ?
DRA	Judges	14	16	So she wept before Samson and complained , saying : Thou hatest me , and dost not love me : therefore thou wilt not expound to me the riddle which thou hast proposed to the sons of my people . But he answered : I would not tell it to my father and mother , and how can I tell it to thee ?
DRA	Judges	14	17	So she wept before him the seven days of the feast : and at length on the seventh day as she was troublesome to him , he expounded it . And she immediately told her countrymen .
DRA	Judges	14	18	And they on the seventh day before the sun went down said to him : What is sweeter than honey ? and what is stronger than a lion ? And he said to them : If you had not ploughed with my heifer , you had not found out my riddle .
DRA	Judges	14	19	And the spirit of the Lord came upon him , and he went down to Ascalon , and slew there thirty men , whose garments he took away and gave to them that had declared the riddle . And being exceeding angry he went up to his father 's house :

DRA	Judges	15	5	And setting them on fire he let the foxes go , that they might run about hither and thither . And they presently went into the standing corn of the Philistines . Which being set on fire , both the corn that was already carried together , and that which was yet standing , was all burnt , insomuch , that the flame consumed also the vineyards and the oliveyards .
DRA	Judges	15	6	Then the Philistines said : Who hath done this thing ? And it was answered : Samson the son in law of the Thamnathite , because he took away his wife , and gave her to another , hath done these things . And the Philistines went up and burnt both the woman and her father .
DRA	Judges	15	7	But Samson said to them : Although you have done this , yet will I be revenged of you , and then I will be quiet .
DRA	Judges	15	8	And he made a great slaughter of them , so that in astonishment they laid the calf of the leg upon the thigh . And going down he dwelt in a cavern of the rock Etam .
DRA	Judges	15	9	Then the Philistines going up into the land of Juda , camped in the place which afterwards was called Lechi , that is , the Jawbone , where their army was spread .
DRA	Judges	15	10	And the men of the tribe of Juda said to them : Why are you come up against us ? They answered : We are come to bind Samson , and to pay him for what he hath done against us .
DRA	Judges	15	11	Wherefore three thousand men of Juda , went down to the cave of the rock Etam , and said to Samson : Knowest thou not that the Philistines rule over us ? Why wouldst thou do thus ? And he said to them : As they did to me , so have I done to them .
DRA	Judges	15	12	And they said to him , We are come to bind thee and to deliver thee into the hands of the Philistines . And Samson said to them : Swear to me , and promise me , that you will not kill me .
DRA	Judges	15	13	They said : We will not kill thee : but we will deliver thee up bound . And they bound him with two new cords , and brought him from the rock Etam .
DRA	Judges	15	14	Now when he was come to the place of the Jawbone , and the Philistines shouting went to meet him , the spirit of the Lord came strongly upon him : and as the flax is wont to be consumed at the approach of fire , so the bands with which he was bound were broken and loosed .
DRA	Judges	15	16	And he said : With the jawbone of an ass , with the jaw of the colt of asses I have destroyed them , and have slain a thousand men .
DRA	Judges	15	17	And when he had ended these words singing , he threw the jawbone out of his hand , and called the name of that place Ramathlechi , which is interpreted the lifting up of the jawbone .
DRA	Judges	15	18	Arid being very thirsty , he cried to the Lord , and said : Thou hast given this very great deliverance and victory into the hand of thy servant : and behold I die for thirst , and shall fall into the hands of the uncircumcised .
DRA	Judges	15	19	Then the Lord opened a great tooth in the jaw of the ass , and waters issued out of it . And when he had drank them he refreshed his spirit , and recovered his strength . Therefore the name of that place was called , The Spring of him that invoked from the jawbone , until this present day .

DRA	Judges	16	1899	American Edition
DRA	Judges	16	2	And when the Philistines had beard this , and it was noised about among them , that Samson was come into the city , they surrounded him , setting guards at the gate of the city , and watching there all the night in silence , that in the morning they might kill him as he went out .
DRA	Judges	16	3	But Samson slept till midnight , and then rising he took both the doors of the gate , with the posts thereof , and the bolt , and laying them on his shoulders , carried them up to the top of the hill , which looketh towards Hebron .
DRA	Judges	16	4	After this he loved a woman , who dwelt in the valley of Sorec , and she was called Dalila .
DRA	Judges	16	5	And the princes of the Philistines came to her , and said : Deceive him , and learn of him wherein his great strength lieth , and how we may be able to overcome him , to bind and afflict him : which if thou shalt do , we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver .
DRA	Judges	16	6	And Dalila said to Samson : Tell me , I beseech thee , wherein thy greatest strength lieth , and what it is wherewith if thou wert bound thou couldst not break loose .
DRA	Judges	16	7	And Samson answered her : If I shall be bound with seven cords made of sinews not yet dry , but still moist , I shall be weak like other men .
DRA	Judges	16	8	And the princes of the Philistines brought unto her seven cords , such is he spoke of , with which she bound him ;
DRA	Judges	16	9	Men lying privately in wait with her , and in the chamber expecting the event of the thing , and she cried out to him : The Philistines are upon thee , Samson . And he broke the bands , as a man would break a thread of tow twined with spittle , when it smelleth the fire : so it was not known wherein his strength Jay .
DRA	Judges	16	10	And Dalila said to him : Behold thou hast mocked me , and hast told me a false thing : but now at least tell me wherewith thou mayest be bound .
DRA	Judges	16	11	And he answered her : If I shall be bound with new ropes , that were never in work , I shall be weak and like other men .
DRA	Judges	16	12	Dalila bound him again with these , and cried out : The Philistines are upon thee , Samson , there being an ambush prepared for him in the chamber . But he broke the bands like threads of webs .
DRA	Judges	16	13	And Dalila said to him again : How long dost thou deceive me , and tell me lies ? shew me wherewith thou mayest be bound . And Samson answered her : If thou plattest the seven locks of my head with a lace , and tying them round about a nail fastenest it in the ground , I shall be weak .
DRA	Judges	16	14	And when Dalila had done this , she said to him : The Philistines are upon thee , Samson . And awaking out of his sleep he drew out the nail with the hairs and the lace .
DRA	Judges	16	15	And Dalila said to him : How dost thou say thou lovest me , when thy mind is not with me ? Thou hast told me lies these three times , and wouldst not tell me wherein thy great strength lieth .
DRA	Judges	16	17	Then opening the truth of the thing , he said to her : The razor hath never come upon my head , for I am a Nazarite , that is to say , consecrated to God from my mother 's womb : if my head be shaven , my strength shall depart from me , and I shall become weak , and shall be like other men .
DRA	Judges	16	18	Then seeing that be had discovered to her all his mind , she sent to the princes of the Philistines , saying : Come up this once more , for now he hath opened his heart to me . And they went up taking with them the money which they had promised .
DRA	Judges	16	19	But she made him sleep upon her knees , and lay his head in her bosom . And she called a barber , and shaved his seven locks , and began to drive him away , and thrust him from her : for immediately his strength departed from him .
DRA	Judges	16	20	And she said : The Philistines are upon thee , Samson . And awaking from sleep , he said in his mind : I will go out as I did before , and shake myself , not knowing that the Lord was departed from him .
DRA	Judges	16	21	Then the Philistines seized upon him , and forthwith pulled out his eyes , and led him bound in chains to Gaza , and shutting him up in prison made him grind .
DRA	Judges	16	22	And now his hair began to grow again .
DRA	Judges	16	23	And the princes of the Philistines assembled together , to offer great sacrifices to Dagon their god , and to make merry , saying : Our god hath delivered our enemy Samson into our hands .
DRA	Judges	16	24	And the people also seeing this , praised their god , and said the same : Our god hath delivered our adversary into our bands , him that destroyed our country and killed very many .
DRA	Judges	16	25	And rejoicing in their feasts , when they had now taken their good cheer , they commanded that Samson should be called , and should play before them . And being brought out of prison he played before them , and they made him stand between two pillars .
DRA	Judges	16	26	And he said to the lad that guided his steps : Suffer me to touch the pillars which support the whole house , and let me lean upon them , and rest a little .
DRA	Judges	16	27	Now the house was full of men and women , and all the princes of the Philistines were there . Moreover about three thousand persons of both sexes from the roof and the higher part of the house , were beholding Samson 's play .
DRA	Judges	16	28	But he called upon the Lord , saying : O Lord God , remember me , and restore to me now my former strength , O my God , that I may revenge myself on my enemies , and for the loss of my two eyes I may take one revenge .
DRA	Judges	16	29	And laying hold on both the pillars on which the house rested , and holding the one with his right hand , and the other with his left ,
DRA	Judges	16	30	He said : Let me die with the Philistines . And when he had strongly shook the pillars , the house fell upon all the princes , and the rest of the multitude that was there : and he killed many more at his death , than he had killed before in his life .
DRA	Judges	16	31	And his brethren and all his kindred , going down took his body , and buried it between Saraa and Esthaol in the buryingplace of his father Manue : and he judged Israel twenty years . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Judges	17	17	There was at that time a man of mount Ephraim whose name was Michas ,
DRA	Judges	17	1899	American Edition
DRA	Judges	17	2	Who said to his mother : The eleven hundred pieces of silver , which thou hadst put aside for thyself , and concerning which thou didst swear in my hearing , behold I have , and they are with me . And she said to him : Blessed be my son by the Lord .
DRA	Judges	17	3	So he restored them to his mother , who said to him : I have consecrated and vowed this silver to the Lord , that my son may receive it at my hand , and make a graven and a molten god , so now I deliver it to thee .
DRA	Judges	17	4	And he restored them to his mother : and she took two hundred pieces of silver and gave them to the silversmith , to make of them a graven and a molten god , which was in the house of Michas .
DRA	Judges	17	5	And he separated also therein a little temple for the god , and made an ephod , and theraphim , that is to say , a priestly garment , and idols : and he filled the hand of one of his sons , and he became his priest .
DRA	Judges	17	6	In those days there was no king in Israel , but every one did that which seemed right to himself .
DRA	Judges	17	7	There was also another young man of Bethlehem Juda , of the kindred thereof : and he was a Levite , and dwelt there .
DRA	Judges	17	8	Now he went out from the city of Bethlehem , and desired to sojourn wheresoever he should find it convenient for him . And when he was come to mount Ephraim , as he was on his journey , and had turned aside a little into the house of Michas ,
DRA	Judges	17	9	He was asked by him whence he came . And he answered : I am a Levite of Bethlehem Juda , and I am going to dwell where I can , and where I shall find a place to my advantage .
DRA	Judges	17	10	And Michas said : Stay with me , and be unto me a father and a priest , and I will give thee every year ten pieces of silver , and a double suit of apparel , and thy victuals .
DRA	Judges	17	11	He was content , and abode with the man , and was unto him as one of his sons .
DRA	Judges	17	12	And Michas filled his hand , and had the young man with him , for his priest , saying :
DRA	Judges	17	13	Now I know God will do me good , since I have a priest of the race of the Levites . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Judges	18	18	So they that were gone in took away the graven thing , the ephod , and the idols , and the molten god . And the priest said to them : What are you doing ?
DRA	Judges	18	1899	American Edition
DRA	Judges	18	2	So the children of Dan sent five most valiant men of their stock and family from Saraa and Esthaol , to spy out the land , and to view it diligently : and they said to them : Go , and view the land . They went on their way , and when they came to mount Ephraim , they went into the house of Michas , and rested there :
DRA	Judges	18	3	And knowing the voice of the young man the Levite , and lodging with him , they said to him : Who brought thee hither ? what dost thou here ? why wouldst thou come hither ?
DRA	Judges	18	4	He answered them : Michas hath done such and such things for me , and hath hired me to be his priest .
DRA	Judges	18	5	Then they desired him to consult the Lord , that they might know whether their journey should be prosperous , and the thing should have effect .
DRA	Judges	18	6	He answered them : Go in peace , the Lord looketh on your way , and the journey that you go .
DRA	Judges	18	7	So the five men going on came to Lais : and they saw how the people dwelt therein without any fear , according to the custom of the Sidonians , secure and easy , having no man at all to oppose them , being very rich , and living separated , at a distance from Sidon and from all men .
DRA	Judges	18	8	And they returned to their brethren in Saraa and Esthaol , who asked them what they had done ? to whom they answered :
DRA	Judges	18	9	Arise , and let us go up to them : for we have seen the land which is exceeding rich and fruitful : neglect not , lose no time : let us go and possess it , there will be no difficulty .
DRA	Judges	18	10	We shall come to a people that is secure , into a spacious country , and the Lord will deliver the place to us , in which there is no want of any thing that groweth on the earth .
DRA	Judges	18	11	There went therefore of the kindred of Dan , to wit , from Saraa and Esthaol , six hundred men , furnished with arms for war ,
DRA	Judges	18	12	And going up they lodged in Cariathiarim of Juda : which place from that time is called the camp of Dan , and is behind Cariathiarim .
DRA	Judges	18	13	From thence they passed into mount Ephraim . And when they were come to the house of Michas ,
DRA	Judges	18	14	The five men , that before had been sent to view the land of Lais , said to the rest of their brethren : You know that in these houses there is an ephod , and theraphim , and a graven , and a molten god : see what you are pleased to do .
DRA	Judges	18	15	And when they had turned a little aside , they went into the house of the young man the Levite , who was in the house of Michas : and they saluted him with words of peace .
DRA	Judges	18	16	And the six hundred men stood before the door , appointed with their arms .
DRA	Judges	18	17	But they that were gone into the house of the young man , went about to take away the graven god , and the ephod , and the theraphim , and the molten god , and the priest stood before the door , the six hundred valiant men waiting not far off .
DRA	Judges	18	19	And they said to him : Hold thy peace and put thy finger on thy mouth and come with us , that we may have thee for a father , and a priest . Whether is better for thee , to be a priest in the house of one man , or in a tribe and family in Israel ?
DRA	Judges	18	20	When he had heard this , he agreed to their words , and took the ephod , and the idols , and the graven god , and departed with them .
DRA	Judges	18	21	And when they were going forward , and had put before them the children and the cattle and all that was valuable ,
DRA	Judges	18	22	And were now at a distance from the house of Michas , the men that dwelt in the houses of Michas gathering together followed them ,
DRA	Judges	18	23	And began to shout out after them . They looked back , and said to Michas : What aileth thee ? Why dost thou cry ?
DRA	Judges	18	24	And he answered : You have taken away my gods which I have made me and the priest , and all that I have , and do you say : What aileth thee ?
DRA	Judges	18	25	And the children of Dan said to him : See thou say no more to us , lest men enraged come upon thee , and thou perish with all thy house .
DRA	Judges	18	26	And so they went on the journey they had begun . But Michas seeing that they were stronger than he , returned to his house .
DRA	Judges	18	27	And the six hundred men took the priest , and the things we spoke of before , and came to Lais to a people that was quiet and secure , and smote them with the edge of the sword : and the city was burnt with fire ,
DRA	Judges	18	28	There being no man at all who brought them any succour , because they dwelt far from Sidon , and had no society or business with any man . And the city was in the land of Rohob : and they rebuilt it and dwelt therein .
DRA	Judges	18	29	Calling the name of the city Dan after the name of their father , who was the son of Israel , which before was called Lais .
DRA	Judges	18	30	And they set up to themselves the graven idol , and Jonathan the son of Gersam the son of Moses , he and his sons were priests in the tribe of Dan , until the day of their captivity .
DRA	Judges	18	31	And the idol of Michas remained with them all the time that the house of God was in Silo . In those days there was no king in Israel . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Judges	19	19	We have straw and hay for provender of the asses , and bread and wine for the use of myself and of thy handmaid , and of the servant that is with me : we want nothing but lodging .
DRA	Judges	19	1899	American Edition
DRA	Judges	19	2	And she left him and returned to her father 's house in Bethlehem , and abode with him four months .
DRA	Judges	19	3	And her husband followed her , willing to be reconciled with her , and to speak kindly to her , and to bring her back with him , having with him a servant and two asses : and she received him , and brought him into her father 's house . And when his father in law had heard this , and had seen him , he met him with joy ,
DRA	Judges	19	4	And embraced the man . And the son in law tarried in the house of his father in law three days , eating with him and drinking familiarly .
DRA	Judges	19	5	But on the fourth day arising early in the morning he desired to depart . But his father in law kept him , and said to him : Taste first a little bread , and strengthen thy stomach , and so thou shalt depart .
DRA	Judges	19	6	And they sat down together , and ate and drank . And the father of the young woman said to his son in law : I beseech thee to stay here to day , and let us make merry together .
DRA	Judges	19	7	But he rising up began to be for departing . And nevertheless his father in law earnestly pressed him , and made him stay with him .
DRA	Judges	19	8	But when morning was come , the Levite prepared to go on his journey . And his father in law said to him again : I beseech thee to take a little meat , and strengthening thyself , till the day be farther advanced , afterwards thou mayest depart . And they ate together .
DRA	Judges	19	9	And the young man arose to set forward with his wife and servant . And his father in law spoke to him again : Consider that the day is declining , and draweth toward evening : tarry with me to day also , and spend the day in mirth , and to morrow thou shalt depart , that thou mayest go into thy house .
DRA	Judges	19	10	His son in law would not consent to his words : but forthwith went forward and came over against Jebus , which by another name is called Jerusalem , leading with him two asses laden , and his concubine .
DRA	Judges	19	11	And now they were come near Jebus , and the day was far spent : and the servant said to his master : Come , I beseech thee , let us turn into the city of the Jebusites , and lodge there .
DRA	Judges	19	12	His master answered him : I will not go into the town of another nation , who are not of the children of Israel , but I will pass over to Gabaa :
DRA	Judges	19	13	And when I shall come thither , we will lodge there , or at least in the city of Rama .
DRA	Judges	19	14	So they passed by Jebus , and went on their journey , and the sun went down upon them when they were by Gabaa , which is in the tribe of Benjamin :
DRA	Judges	19	15	And they turned into it , to lodge there . And when they were come in , they sat in the street of the city , for no man would receive them to lodge .
DRA	Judges	19	16	And behold they saw an old man , returning out of the field and from his work in the evening , and he also was of mount Ephraim , and dwelt as a stranger in Gabaa ; but the men of that country were the children of Jemini .
DRA	Judges	19	17	And the old man lifting up his eyes , saw the man sitting with his bundles in the street of the city , and said to him : Whence comest thou ? and whither goest thou ?
DRA	Judges	19	18	He answered him : We came out from Bethlehem Juda , and we are going to our home , which is on the side of mount Ephraim , from whence we went to Bethlehem : and now we go to the house of God , and none will receive us under his roof :
DRA	Judges	19	20	And the old man answered him : Peace be with thee : I will furnish all things that are necessary : only I beseech thee , stay not in the street .
DRA	Judges	19	21	And he brought him into his house , and gave provender to his asses : and after they had washed their feet , he entertained them with a feast .
DRA	Judges	19	22	While they were making merry , and refreshing their bodies with meat and drink , after the labour of the journey , the men of that city , sons of Belial , ( that is , without yoke , ) came and beset the old man 's house , and began to knock at the door , calling to the master of the house , and saying : Bring forth the man that came into thy house , that we may abuse him .
DRA	Judges	19	23	And the old man went out to them , and said : Do not so , my brethren , do not so wickedly : because this man is come into my lodging , and cease I pray you from this folly .
DRA	Judges	19	24	I have a maiden daughter , and this man hath a concubine , I will bring them out to you , and you may humble them , and satisfy your lust : only , I beseech you , commit not this crime against nature on the man .
DRA	Judges	19	25	They would not be satisfied with his words ; which the man seeing , brought out his concubine to them , and abandoned her to their wickedness : and when they had abused her all the night , they let her go in the morning .
DRA	Judges	19	26	But the woman , at the dawning of the day , came to the door of the house where her lord lodged , and there fell down .
DRA	Judges	19	27	And in the morning the man arose , and opened the door that he might end the journey he had begun : and behold his concubine lay before the door with her hands spread on the threshold .
DRA	Judges	19	28	He thinking she was taking her rest , said to her : Arise , and let us be going . But as she made no answer , perceiving she was dead , he took her up , and laid her upon his ass , and returned to his house .
DRA	Judges	19	29	And when he was come home he took a sword , and divided the dead body of his wife with her bones into twelve parts , and sent the pieces into all the borders of Israel .
DRA	Judges	19	30	And when every one had seen this , they all cried out : There was never such a thing done in Israel from the day that our fathers came up out of Egypt , until this day : give sentence , and decree in common what ought to be done .

DRA	Judges	20	20	And going out from thence to fight against Benjamin , began to assault the city .
DRA	Judges	20	1899	American Edition
DRA	Judges	20	2	And all the chiefs of the people , and all the tribes of Israel met together in the assembly of the people of God , four hundred thousand footmen fit for war .
DRA	Judges	20	3	( Nor were the children of Benjamin ignorant that the children of Israel were come up to Maspha . ) And the Levite the husband of the woman that was killed , being asked , how so great a wickedness had been committed ,
DRA	Judges	20	4	Answered : I came into Gabaa of Benjamin with my wife , and there I lodged :
DRA	Judges	20	5	And behold the men of that city in the night beset the house wherein I was , intending to kill me , and abused my wife with an incredible fury of lust , so that at last she died .
DRA	Judges	20	6	And I took her and cut her in pieces , and sent the , parts into all the borders of your possession : because there never was so heinous a crime , and so great an abomination committed in Israel .
DRA	Judges	20	7	You are all here , O children of Israel , determine what you ought to do .
DRA	Judges	20	8	And all the people standing , answered as by the voice of one man : We will not return to our tents , neither shall any one of us go into his own house :
DRA	Judges	20	9	But this we will do in common against Gabaa :
DRA	Judges	20	10	We will take ten men of a hundred out of all the tribes of Israel , and a hundred out of a thousand , and a thousand out of ten thousand , to bring victuals for the army , that we might fight against Gabaa of Benjamin , and render to it for its wickedness , what it deserveth .
DRA	Judges	20	11	And all Israel were gathered together against the city , as one man , with one mind , and one counsel :
DRA	Judges	20	12	And they sent messengers to all the tribe of Benjamin to say to them : Why hath so great an abomination been found among you ?
DRA	Judges	20	13	Deliver up the men of Gabaa , that have committed this heinous crime , that they may die , and the evil may be taken away out of Israel . But they would not hearken to the proposition of their brethren the children of Israel :
DRA	Judges	20	14	But out of all the cities which were of their lot , they gathered themselves together into Gabaa , to aid them , and to fight against the whole people of Israel .
DRA	Judges	20	15	And there were found of Benjamin five and twenty thousand men that drew the sword , besides the inhabitants of Gabaa ,
DRA	Judges	20	16	Who were seven hundred most valiant men , fighting with the left hand as well as with the right : and slinging stones so sure that they could hit even a hair , and not miss by the stone 's going on either side .
DRA	Judges	20	17	Of the men of Israel also , beside the children of Benjamin , were found four hundred thousand that drew swords , and were prepared to fight .
DRA	Judges	20	18	And they arose and came to the house of God , that is , to Silo : and they consulted God , and said : Who shall be in our army the first to go to the battle against the children of Benjamin ? And the Lord answered them : Let Juda be your leader .
DRA	Judges	20	19	And forthwith the children of Israel rising in the morning , camped by Gabaa :
DRA	Judges	20	21	And the children of Benjamin coming out of Gabaa , slew of the children of Israel that day two and twenty thousand men .
DRA	Judges	20	22	Again Israel trusting in their strength and their number , set their army in array in the same place , where they had fought before :
DRA	Judges	20	23	Yet so that they first went up and wept before the Lord until night : and consulted him , and said : Shall I go out any more to fight against the children of Benjamin my brethren , or not ? And he answered them : Go up against them , and join battle .
DRA	Judges	20	24	And when the children of Israel went out the next day to fight against the children of Benjamin ,
DRA	Judges	20	25	The children of Benjamin sallied forth out of the gates of Gabaa : and meeting them made so great a slaughter of them , as to kill eighteen thousand men that drew the sword .
DRA	Judges	20	26	Wherefore all the children of Israel came to the house of God , and sat and wept before the Lord : and they fasted that day till the evening , and offered to him holocausts , and victims of peace offerings ,
DRA	Judges	20	27	And inquired of him concerning their state . At that time the ark of the covenant of the Lord was there ,
DRA	Judges	20	28	And Phinees the son of Eleazar the son of Aaron was over the house . So they consulted the Lord and said : Shall we go out any more to fight against the children of Benjamin our brethren , or shall we cease ? And the Lord said to them : Go up , for to morrow I will deliver them into your hands .
DRA	Judges	20	29	And the children of Israel set ambushes round about the city of Gabaa :
DRA	Judges	20	30	And they drew up their army against Benjamin the third time , as they had done the first and second .
DRA	Judges	20	31	And the children of Benjamin boldly issued out of the city , and seeing their enemies flee , pursued them a long way , so as to wound and kill some of them , as they had done the first and second day , whilst they fled by two highways , whereof one goeth up to Bethel , and the other to Gabaa , and they slew about thirty men :
DRA	Judges	20	32	For they thought to cut them off , as they did before . But they artfully feigning a flight , designed to draw them away from the city , and by their seeming to flee to bring them to the highways aforesaid .
DRA	Judges	20	33	Then all the children of Israel rising up out of the places where they were , set their army in battle array , in the place which is called Baalthamar . The ambushes also which were about the city , began by little and little to come forth ,
DRA	Judges	20	34	And to march from the west side of the city . And other ten thousand men chosen out of all Israel attacked the inhabitants of the city . And the battle grew hot against the children of Benjamin : and they understood not that present death threatened them on every side .
DRA	Judges	20	35	And the Lord defeated them before the children of Israel , and they slew of them in that day five and twenty thousand , and one hundred , all fighting men and that drew the sword .
DRA	Judges	20	36	But the children of Benjamin when they saw themselves to be too weak , began to flee . Which the children of Israel seeing , gave them place to flee , that they might come to the ambushes that were prepared , which they had set near the city .
DRA	Judges	20	37	And they that were in ambush arose on a sudden out of their coverts , and whilst Benjamin turned their backs to the slayers , went into the city , and smote it with the edge of the sword .
DRA	Judges	20	38	Now the children of Israel had given a sign to them , whom they had laid in ambushes , that after they had taken the city , they should make a fire : that by the smoke rising on high , they might shew that the city was taken .
DRA	Judges	20	39	And when the children of Israel saw this in the battle ( for the children of Benjamin thought they fled and pursued them vigorously , killing thirty men of their army )
DRA	Judges	20	40	And perceived as it were a pillar of smoke rise up from the city ; and Benjamin looking back , saw that the city was taken , and that the flames ascended on high :
DRA	Judges	20	41	They that before had made as if they fled , turning their faces stood bravely against them ; which the children of Benjamin seeing , turned their backs ,
DRA	Judges	20	42	And began to go towards the way of the desert , the enemy pursuing them thither also . And they that fired the city came also out to meet them .
DRA	Judges	20	43	And so it was , that they were slain on both sides by the enemies , and there was no rest of their men dying . They fell and were beaten down on the east side of the city Gabaa .
DRA	Judges	20	44	And they that were slain in the same place were eighteen thousand men , all most valiant soldiers .
DRA	Judges	20	45	And when they that remained of Benjamin saw this , they fled into the wilderness and made towards the rock that is called Remmon . In that flight , also as they were straggling and going different ways , they slew of them five thousand men . And as they went farther , they still pursued them , and slew also other two thousand .
DRA	Judges	20	46	And so it came to pass , that all that were slain of Benjamin in divers places , were five and twenty thousand fighting men , most valiant for war .
DRA	Judges	20	47	And there remained of all the number of Benjamin only six hundred men that were able to escape , and flee to the wilderness : and they abode in the rock Remmon four months .
DRA	Judges	20	48	But the children of Israel returning , put all the remains of the city to the sword , both men and beasts , and all the cities and villages of Benjamin were consumed with devouring flames . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )

DRA	Judges	21	1899	American Edition
DRA	Judges	21	2	And they all came to the house of God in Silo , and abiding before him till the evening , lifted up their voices , and began to lament and weep , saying :
DRA	Judges	21	3	O Lord God of Israel , why is so great an evil come to pass in thy people , that this day one tribe should be taken away from among us ?
DRA	Judges	21	4	And rising early the next day , they built an altar : and offered there holocausts , and victims of peace , and they said :
DRA	Judges	21	5	Who is there among all the tribes of Israel that came not up with the army of the Lord ? for they had bound themselves with a great oath , when they were in Maspha , that whosoever were wanting should be slain .
DRA	Judges	21	6	And the children of Israel being moved with repentance for their brother Benjamin , began to say : One tribe is taken away from Israel .
DRA	Judges	21	7	Whence shall they take wives ? For we have all in general sworn , not to give our daughters to them .
DRA	Judges	21	8	Therefore they said : Who is thereof all the tribes of Israel , that came not up to the Lord to Maspha . And behold the inhabitants of Jabes Galaad were found not to have been in that army .
DRA	Judges	21	9	( At that time also when they were in Silo , no one of them was found there . )
DRA	Judges	21	10	So they sent ten thousand of the most valiant men , and commanded them , saying : Go and put the inhabitants of Jabes Galaad to the sword , with their wives and their children .
DRA	Judges	21	11	And this is what you shall observe : Every male , and all women that have known men , you shall kill , but the virgins you shall save .
DRA	Judges	21	12	And there were found of Jabes Galaad four hundred virgins , that had not known the bed of a man , and they brought them to the camp Silo , into the land of Chanaan .
DRA	Judges	21	13	And they sent messengers to the children of Benjamin , that were in the rock Remmon , and commanded them to receive them in peace .
DRA	Judges	21	14	And the children of Benjamin came at that time , and wives were given them of the daughters of Jabes Galaad : but they found no others , whom they might give in like manner .
DRA	Judges	21	15	And all Israel was very sorry , and repented for the destroying of one tribe out of Israel .
DRA	Judges	21	16	And the ancients said : What shall we do with the rest , that have not received wives ? for all the women in Benjamin are dead .
DRA	Judges	21	17	And we must use all care , and provide with great diligence , that one tribe be not destroyed out of Israel .
DRA	Judges	21	18	For as to our own daughters we can not give them , being bound with an oath and a curse , whereby we said : Cursed be he that shall give Benjamin any of his daughters to wife .
DRA	Judges	21	19	So they took counsel , and said : Behold there is a yearly solemnity of the Lord in Silo , which is situate on the north of the city of Bethel , and on the east side of the way , that goeth from Bethel to Sichem , and on the south of the town of Lebona .
DRA	Judges	21	20	And they commanded the children of Benjamin , and said : Go , and lie hid in the vineyards ,
DRA	Judges	21	22	And when their fathers and their brethren shall come , and shall begin to complain against you , and to chide , we will say to them : Have pity on them for they took them not away as by the right of war or conquest , but when they asked to have them , you gave them not , and the fault was committed on your part .
DRA	Judges	21	23	And the children of Benjamin did , as they had been commanded : and according to their number , they carried off for themselves every man his wife of them that were dancing : and they went into their possession and built up their cities , and dwelt in them .
DRA	Judges	21	24	The children of Israel also returned by their tribes , and families , to their dwellings . In those days there was no king in Israel : but every one did that which seemed right to himself . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Ruth	1	1	In the days of one of the judges , when the judges ruled , there came a famine in the land . And a certain man of Bethlehem Juda , went to sojourn in the land of Moab with his wife and his two sons .
DRA	Ruth	1	1899	American Edition
DRA	Ruth	1	2	He was named Elimelech , and his wife , Noemi : and his two sons , the one Mahalon , and the other Chelion , Ephrathites of Bethlehem Juda . And entering into the country of Moab , they abode there .
DRA	Ruth	1	3	And Elimelech the husband of Noemi died : and she remained with her sons .
DRA	Ruth	1	4	And they took wives of the women of Moab , of which one was called Orpha , and the other Ruth . And they dwelt there ten years .
DRA	Ruth	1	5	And they both died , to wit , Mahalon and Chelion : and the woman was left alone , having lost both her sons and her husband .
DRA	Ruth	1	6	And she arose to go from the land of Moab to her own country with both her daughters in law : for she had heard that the Lord had looked upon his people , and had given them food .
DRA	Ruth	1	7	Wherefore she went forth out of the place of her sojournment , with both her daughters in law : and being now in the way to return into the land of Juda ,
DRA	Ruth	1	8	She said to them : Go ye home to your mothers : the Lord deal mercifully with you , as you have dealt with the dead and with me .
DRA	Ruth	1	9	May he grant you to find rest in the houses of the husbands which you shall take . And she kissed them . And they lifted up their voice and began to weep ,
DRA	Ruth	1	10	And to say : We will go on with thee to thy people .
DRA	Ruth	1	11	But she answered them : Return , my daughters : why come ye with me ? have I any more sons in my womb , that you may hope for husbands of me ?
DRA	Ruth	1	12	Return again , my daughters , and go your ways : for I am now spent with age , and not fit for wedlock . Although I might conceive this night , and bear children ,
DRA	Ruth	1	13	If you would wait till they were grown up , and come to man 's estate , you would be old women before you marry . Do not so , my daughters , I beseech you : for I am grieved the more for your distress , and the hand of the Lord is gone out against me .
DRA	Ruth	1	14	And they lifted up their voice , and began to weep again : Orpha kissed her mother in law and returned : Ruth stuck close to her mother in law .
DRA	Ruth	1	15	And Noemi said to her : Behold thy kinswoman is returned to her people , and to her gods , go thou with her .
DRA	Ruth	1	16	She answered : Be not against me , to desire that I should leave thee and depart : for whithersoever thou shalt go , I will go : and where thou shalt dwell , I also will dwell . Thy people shall be my people , and thy God my God .
DRA	Ruth	1	17	The land that shall receive thee dying , in the same will I die : and there will I be buried . The Lord do so and so to me , and add more also , if aught but death part me and thee .
DRA	Ruth	1	18	Then Noemi , seeing that Ruth was steadfastly determined to go with her , would not be against it , nor persuade her any more to return to her friends :
DRA	Ruth	1	19	So they went together and came to Bethlehem . And when they were come into the city , the report was quickly spread among all : and the women said : This is that Noemi .
DRA	Ruth	1	20	But she said to them : Call me not Noemi , ( that is , beautiful , ) but call me Mara , ( that is , bitter , ) for the Almighty hath quite filled me with bitterness .
DRA	Ruth	1	21	I went out full , and the Lord hath brought me back empty . Why then do you call me Noemi , whom the Lord hath humbled and the Almighty hath afflicted ?
DRA	Ruth	1	22	So Noemi came with Ruth the Moabitess her daughter in law , from the land of her sojournment : and returned into Bethlehem , in the beginning of the barley harvest . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Ruth	2	2	And Ruth the Moabitess said to her mother in law : If thou wilt , I will go into the field , and glean the ears of corn that escape the hands of the reapers , wheresoever I shall find grace with a householder that will be favourable to me . And she answered her : Go , my daughter .
DRA	Ruth	2	1899	American Edition
DRA	Ruth	2	3	She went therefore and gleaned the ears of corn after the reapers . And it happened that the owner of that field was Booz , who was of the kindred of Elimelech .
DRA	Ruth	2	4	And behold , he came out of Bethlehem , and said to the reapers : The Lord be with you . And they answered him : The Lord bless thee .
DRA	Ruth	2	5	And Booz said to the young man that was set over the reapers : Whose maid is this ?
DRA	Ruth	2	6	And he answered him : This is the Moabitess who came with Noemi , from the land of Moab ,
DRA	Ruth	2	7	And she desired leave to glean the ears of corn that remain , following the steps of the reapers : and she hath been in the field from morning till now , and hath not gone home for one moment .
DRA	Ruth	2	8	And Booz said to Ruth : Hear me , daughter , do not go to glean in any other field , and do not depart from this place : but keep with my maids ,
DRA	Ruth	2	9	And follow where they reap . For I have charged my young men , not to molest thee : and if thou art thirsty , go to the vessels , and drink of the waters whereof the servants drink .
DRA	Ruth	2	10	She fell on her face and worshipping upon the ground , said to him : Whence cometh this to me , that I should find grace before thy eyes , and that thou shouldst vouchsafe to take notice of me a woman of another country ?
DRA	Ruth	2	11	And he answered her : All hath been told me , that thou hast done to thy mother in law after the death of thy husband : and how thou hast left thy parents , and the land wherein thou wast born , and art come to a people which thou knewest not heretofore .
DRA	Ruth	2	12	The Lord render unto thee for thy work , and mayest thou receive a full reward of the Lord the God of Israel , to whom thou art come , and under whose wings thou art fled .
DRA	Ruth	2	13	And she said : I have found grace in thy eyes , my lord , who hast comforted me and hast spoken to the heart of thy handmaid , who am not like to one of thy maids .
DRA	Ruth	2	14	And Booz said to her : At mealtime come thou hither , and eat of the bread , and dip thy morsel in the vinegar . So she sat at the side of the reapers , and she heaped to herself frumenty , and ate and was filled , and took the leavings .
DRA	Ruth	2	15	And she arose from thence , to glean the ears of corn as before . And Booz commanded his servants , saying : If she would even reap with you , hinder her not :
DRA	Ruth	2	16	And let fall some of your handfuls of purpose , and leave them , that she may gather them without shame , and let no man rebuke her when she gathereth them .
DRA	Ruth	2	17	She gleaned therefore in the field till evening : and beating out with a rod and threshing what she had gleaned , she found about the measure of an ephi of barley , that is , three bushels :
DRA	Ruth	2	18	Which she took up and returned into the city , and shewed it to her mother in law : moreover she brought out , and gave her of the remains of her meat , wherewith she had been filled .
DRA	Ruth	2	19	And her mother in law said to her : Where hast thou gleaned to day , and where hast thou wrought ? blessed be he that hath had pity on thee . And she told her with whom she had wrought : and she told the man 's name , that he was called Booz .
DRA	Ruth	2	20	And Noemi answered her : Blessed be he of the Lord : because the same kindness which he shewed to the living , he hath kept also to the dead . And again she said : The man is our kinsman .
DRA	Ruth	2	21	And Ruth said , He also charged me , that I should keep close to his reapers , till all the corn should be reaped .
DRA	Ruth	2	22	And her mother in law said to her : It is better for thee , my daughter , to go out to reap with his maids , lest in another man 's field some one may resist thee .
DRA	Ruth	2	23	So she kept close to the maids of Booz : and continued to glean with them , till all the barley and the wheat were laid up in the barns . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Ruth	3	3	Wash thyself therefore and anoint thee , and put on thy best garments , and go down to the barnfloor : but let not the man see thee , till he shall have done eating and drinking .
DRA	Ruth	3	1899	American Edition
DRA	Ruth	3	2	This Booz , with whose maids thou wast joined in the field , is our near kinsman , and behold this night he winnoweth barley in the threshingfloor .
DRA	Ruth	3	4	And when he shall go to sleep , mark the place wherein he sleepeth : and thou shalt go in , and lift up the clothes wherewith he is covered towards his feet , and shalt lay thyself down there : and he will tell thee what thou must do .
DRA	Ruth	3	5	She answered : Whatsoever thou shalt command , I will do .
DRA	Ruth	3	6	And she went down to the barnfloor , and did all that her mother in law had bid her .
DRA	Ruth	3	7	And when Booz had eaten , and drunk , and was merry , he went to sleep by the heap of sheaves , and she came softly and uncovering his feet , laid herself down .
DRA	Ruth	3	8	And behold , when it was now midnight the man was afraid , and troubled : and he saw a woman lying at his feet ,
DRA	Ruth	3	9	And he said to her : Who art thou ? And she answered : I am Ruth thy handmaid : spread thy coverlet over thy servant , for thou art a near kinsman .
DRA	Ruth	3	10	And he said : Blessed art thou of the Lord , my daughter , and thy latter kindness has surpassed the former : because thou hast not followed young men either poor or rich .
DRA	Ruth	3	11	Fear not therefore , but whatsoever thou shalt say to me I will do to thee . For all the people that dwell within the gates of my city , know that thou art a virtuous woman .
DRA	Ruth	3	12	Neither do I deny myself to be near of kin , but there is another nearer than I .
DRA	Ruth	3	13	Rest thou this night : and when morning is come , if he will take thee by the right of kindred , all is well : but if he will not , I will undoubtedly take thee , as the Lord liveth : sleep till the morning .
DRA	Ruth	3	14	So she slept at his feet till the night was going off . And she arose before men could know one another , and Booz said : Beware lest any man know that thou camest hither .
DRA	Ruth	3	15	And again he said : Spread thy mantle , wherewith thou art covered , and hold it with both hands . And when she spread it and held it , he measured six measures of barley , and laid it upon her . And she carried it and went into the city ,
DRA	Ruth	3	16	And came to her mother in law ; who said to her : What hast thou done , daughter ? And she told her all that the man had done to her .
DRA	Ruth	3	17	And she said : Behold he hath given me six measures of barley : for he said : I will not have thee return empty to thy mother in law .
DRA	Ruth	3	18	And Noemi said : Wait my daughter , till we see what end the thing will have . For the man will not rest until he have accomplished what he hath said . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Ruth	4	4	I would have thee to understand this , and would tell thee before all that sit here , and before the ancients of my people . If thou wilt take possession of it by the right of kindred : buy it and possess it : but if it please thee not , tell me so , that I may know what I have to do . For there is no near kinsman besides thee , who art first , and me , who am second . But he answered : I will buy the field .
DRA	Ruth	4	1899	American Edition
DRA	Ruth	4	2	And Booz taking ten men of the ancients of the city , said to them : Sit ye down here .
DRA	Ruth	4	3	They sat down , and he spoke to the kinsman : Noemi , who is returned from the country of Moab , will sell a parcel of land that belonged to our brother Elimelech .
DRA	Ruth	4	5	And Booz said to him : When thou shalt buy the field at the woman 's hand , thou must take also Ruth the Moabitess , who was the wife of the deceased : to raise up the name of thy kinsman in his inheritance .
DRA	Ruth	4	6	He answered : I yield up my right of next akin : for I must not cut off the posterity of my own family . Do thou make use of my privilege , which I profess I do willingly forego .
DRA	Ruth	4	7	Now this in former times was the manner in Israel between kinsmen , that if at any time one yielded his right to another : that the grant might be sure , the man put off his shoe , and gave it to his neighhour ; this was a testimony of cession of right in Israel .
DRA	Ruth	4	8	So Booz said to his kinsman : Put off thy shoe . And immediately he took it off from his foot .
DRA	Ruth	4	9	And he said to the ancients and to all the people : You are witnesses this day , that I have bought all that was Elimelech 's , and Chelion 's , and Mahalon 's , of the hand of Noemi :
DRA	Ruth	4	10	And have taken to wife Ruth the Moabitess , the wife of Mahalon , to raise up the name of the deceased in his inheritance lest his name be cut off , from among his family and his brethren and his people . You , I say , are witnesses of this thing .
DRA	Ruth	4	11	Then all the people that were in the gate , and the ancients answered : We are witnesses : The Lord make this woman who cometh into thy house , like Rachel , and Lia , who built up the house of Israel : that she may be an example of virtue in Ephrata , and may have a famous name in Bethlehem :
DRA	Ruth	4	12	And that the house may be , as the house of Phares , whom Thamar bore unto Juda , of the seed which the Lord shall give thee of this young woman .
DRA	Ruth	4	13	Booz therefore took Ruth , and married her : and went in unto her , and the Lord gave her to conceive and to bear a son .
DRA	Ruth	4	14	And the women said to Noemi : Blessed be the Lord , who hath not suffered thy family to want a successor , that his name should be preserved in Israel .
DRA	Ruth	4	15	And thou shouldst have one to comfort thy soul , and cherish thy old age . For he is born of thy daughter in law : who loveth thee : and is much better to thee , than if thou hadst seven sons .
DRA	Ruth	4	16	And Noemi taking the child laid it in her bosom , and she carried it , and was a nurse unto it .
DRA	Ruth	4	17	And the women her neighbours , congratulating with her and saying : There is a son born to Noemi : called his name Obed : he is the father of Isai , the father of David .
DRA	Ruth	4	18	These are the generations of Phares : Phares begot Esron ,

DRA	1%20Samuel	1	1	There was a man of Ramathaimsophim , of mount Ephraim , and his name was Elcana , the son of Jeroham , the son of Eliu , the son of Thohu , the son of Suph , an Ephraimite :
DRA	1%20Samuel	1	1899	American Edition
DRA	1%20Samuel	1	2	And he had two wives , the name of one was Anna , and the name of the other Phenenna . Phenenna had children : but Anna had no children .
DRA	1%20Samuel	1	3	And this man went up out of his city upon the appointed days , to adore and to offer sacrifice to the Lord of hosts in Silo . And the two sons of Heli , Ophni and Phinees , were there priests of the Lord .
DRA	1%20Samuel	1	4	Now the day came , and Elcana offered sacrifice , and gave to Phenenna his wife , and to all her sons and daughters , portions :
DRA	1%20Samuel	1	5	But to Anna he gave one portion with sorrow , because he loved Anna . And the Lord had shut up her womb .
DRA	1%20Samuel	1	6	Her rival also afflicted her , and troubled her exceedingly , insomuch that she upbraided her , that the Lord had shut up her womb :
DRA	1%20Samuel	1	7	And thus she did every year , when the time returned that they went up to the temple of the Lord : and thus she provoked her : but Anna wept , and did not eat .
DRA	1%20Samuel	1	8	Then Elcana her husband said to her : Anna , why weepest thou ? and why dost thou not eat ? And why dost thou afflict thy heart ? Am not I better to thee than ten children ?
DRA	1%20Samuel	1	9	So Anna arose after she had eaten and drunk in Silo : And Heli the priest sitting upon a stool , before the door of the temple of the Lord :
DRA	1%20Samuel	1	10	As Anna had her heart full of grief , she prayed to the Lord , shedding many tears ,
DRA	1%20Samuel	1	11	And she made a vow , saying : O Lord , of hosts , if thou wilt look down on the affliction of thy servant , and wilt be mindful of me , and not forget thy handmaid , and wilt give to thy servant a man child : I will give him to the Lord all the days of his life , and no razor shall come upon his head .
DRA	1%20Samuel	1	12	And it came to pass , as she multiplied prayers before the Lord , that Heli observed her mouth .
DRA	1%20Samuel	1	13	Now Anna spoke in her heart , and only her lips moved , but her voice was not heard at all . Heli therefore thought her to be drunk ,
DRA	1%20Samuel	1	14	And said to her : How long wilt thou , be drunk ? digest a little the wine , of which thou hast taken too much .
DRA	1%20Samuel	1	15	Anna answering , said : Not so , my lord : for I am an exceeding unhappy woman , and have drunk neither wine nor any strong drink , but I have poured out my soul before the Lord .
DRA	1%20Samuel	1	16	Count not thy handmaid for one of the daughters of Belial : for out of the abundance of my sorrow and grief have I spoken till now .
DRA	1%20Samuel	1	17	Then Heli said to her : Go in peace : and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition , which thou hast asked of him .
DRA	1%20Samuel	1	18	And she said : Would to God thy handmaid may find grace in thy eyes . So the woman went on her way , and ate , and her countenance was no more changed .
DRA	1%20Samuel	1	19	And they rose in the morning , and worshipped before the Lord : and they returned , and came into their house at Ramatha . And Elcana knew Anna his wife : and the Lord remembered her .
DRA	1%20Samuel	1	20	And it came to pass when the time was come about , Anna conceived and bore a son , and called his name Samuel : because she had asked him of the Lord .
DRA	1%20Samuel	1	21	And Elcana her husband went up , and all his house , to offer to the Lord the solemn sacrifice , and his vow .
DRA	1%20Samuel	1	22	But Anna went not up : for she said to her husband : I will not go till the child be weaned , and till I may carry him , that he may appear before the Lord , and may abide always there .
DRA	1%20Samuel	1	23	And Elcana her husband said to her : Do what seemeth good to thee , and stay till thou wean him : and I pray that the Lord may fulfill his word . So the woman stayed at home , and gave her son suck , till she weaned him .
DRA	1%20Samuel	1	24	And after she had weaned him , she carried him with her , with three calves , and three bushels of flour , and a bottle of wine , and she brought him to the house of the Lord in Silo . Now the child was as yet very young :
DRA	1%20Samuel	1	25	And they immolated a calf , and offered the child to Heli .
DRA	1%20Samuel	1	26	And Anna said : I beseech thee , my lord , as thy soul liveth , my lord : I am that woman who stood before thee here praying to the Lord .
DRA	1%20Samuel	1	27	For this child did I pray , and the Lord hath granted me my petition , which I asked of him .
DRA	1%20Samuel	1	28	Therefore I also have lent him to the Lord all the days of his life , he shall be lent to the Lord . And they adored the Lord there . And Anna prayed , and said : Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )

DRA	1%20Samuel	2	8	He raiseth up the needy from the dust , and lifteth up the poor from the dunghill : that he may sit with princes , and hold the throne of glory . For the poles of the earth are the Lord 's , and upon them he hath set the world .

DRA	1%20Samuel	2	11	And Elcana went to Ramatha , to his house : but the child ministered in the sight of the Lord before the face of Heli the priest .
DRA	1%20Samuel	2	12	Now the sons of Heli were children of Belial , not knowing the Lord ,
DRA	1%20Samuel	2	13	Nor the office of the priests to the people : but whosoever had offered a sacrifice , the servant of the priest came , while the flesh was in boiling , with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand ,
DRA	1%20Samuel	2	14	And thrust it into the kettle , or into the caldron , or into the pot , or into the pan : and all that the fleshhook brought up , the priest took to himself . Thus did they to all Israel that came to Silo .
DRA	1%20Samuel	2	15	Also before they burnt the fat , the servant of the priest came , and said to the man that sacrificed : Give me flesh to boil for the priest : for I will not take of thee sodden flesh , but raw .
DRA	1%20Samuel	2	16	And he that sacrificed said to him : Let the fat first be burnt to day according to the custom , and then take as much as thy soul desireth . But he answered and said to him : Not so : but thou shalt give it me now , or else I will take it by force .
DRA	1%20Samuel	2	17	Wherefore the sin of the young men was exceeding great before the Lord : because they withdrew men from the sacrifice of the Lord .

DRA	1%20Samuel	14	5	One rock stood out towards the north over against Machmas , and the other to the south over against Gabaa .
DRA	1%20Samuel	14	6	And Jonathan said to the young man that bore his armour : Come , let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised , it may be the Lord will do for us , because it is easy for the Lord to save either by many , or by few .
DRA	1%20Samuel	14	7	And his armourbearer said to him : Do all that pleaseth thy mind : go whither thou wilt , and I will be with thee wheresoever thou hast a mind .
DRA	1%20Samuel	14	8	And Jonathan said : Behold we will go over to these men . And when we shall be seen by them ,
DRA	1%20Samuel	14	9	If they shall speak thus to us : Stay till we come to you : let us stand still in our place , and not go up to them .

DRA	1%20Samuel	14	22	And all the Israelites that had hid themselves in mount Ephraim , hearing that the Philistines fled , joined themselves with their countrymen in the fight . And there were with Saul about ten thousand men .
DRA	1%20Samuel	14	23	And the Lord saved Israel that day . And the fight went on as far as Bethaven .
DRA	1%20Samuel	14	24	And the men of Israel were joined together that day ; and Saul adjured the people , saying : Cursed be the man that shall eat food till evening , till I be revenged of my enemies . So none of the people tasted any food :
DRA	1%20Samuel	14	25	And all the common people came into a forest , in which there was honey upon the ground .
DRA	1%20Samuel	14	26	And when the people came into the forest , behold the honey dropped , but no man put his hand to his mouth . For the people feared the oath .
DRA	1%20Samuel	14	27	But Jonathan had not heard when his father adjured the people : and he put forth the end of the rod , which he had in his hand , and dipt it in a honeycomb : and he carried his hand to his mouth , and his eyes were enlightened .
DRA	1%20Samuel	14	28	And one of the people answering , said : Thy father hath bound the people with an oath , saying : Cursed be the man that shall eat any food this day . ( And the people were faint . )
DRA	1%20Samuel	14	29	And Jonathan said : My father hath troubled the land : you have seen yourselves that my eyes are enlightened , because I tasted a little of this honey :
DRA	1%20Samuel	14	30	How much more if the people had eaten of the prey of their enemies , which they found ? had there not been made a greater slaughter among the Philistines ?
DRA	1%20Samuel	14	31	So they smote that day the Philistines from Machmas to Ailon . And the people were wearied exceedingly .
DRA	1%20Samuel	14	32	And falling upon the spoils , they took sheep , and oxen , and calves , and slew them on the ground : and the people ate them with the blood .
DRA	1%20Samuel	14	33	And they told Saul that the people had sinned against the Lord , eating with the blood . And he said : You have transgressed : roll here to me now a great stone .
DRA	1%20Samuel	14	34	And Saul said : Disperse yourselves among the people , and tell them to bring me every man his ox and his ram , and slay them upon this stone , and eat , and you shall not sin against the Lord in eating with the blood .

DRA	1%20Samuel	14	38	And Saul said : Bring hither all the corners of the people : and know , and see by whom this sin hath happened to day .
DRA	1%20Samuel	14	39	As the Lord liveth who is the saviour of Israel , if it was done by Jonathan my son , he shall surely die . In this none of the people gainsaid him .
DRA	1%20Samuel	14	40	And he said to all Israel : Be you on one side , and I with Jonathan my son will be on the other side . And the people answered Saul : Do what seemeth good in thy eyes .
DRA	1%20Samuel	14	41	And Saul said to the Lord : O Lord God of Israel , give a sign , by which we may know , what the meaning is , that thou answerest not thy servant to day . If this iniquity be in me , or in my son Jonathan , give a proof : or if this iniquity be in thy people , give holiness . And Jonathan and Saul were taken , and the people escaped .
DRA	1%20Samuel	14	42	And Saul said : Cast lots between me , and Jonathan my son . And Jonathan was taken .
DRA	1%20Samuel	14	43	And Saul said to Jonathan : Tell me what thou hast done . And Jonathan told him , and said : I did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod , which was in my hand , and behold I must die .
DRA	1%20Samuel	14	44	And Saul said : May God do so and so to me , and add still more : for dying thou shalt die , O Jonathan .
DRA	1%20Samuel	14	45	And the people said to Saul : Shall Jonathan then die , who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel ? This must not be .

DRA	1%20Samuel	15	2	Thus saith the Lord of hosts : I have reckoned up all that Amalec hath done to Israel : I how he opposed them in the way when they came up out of Egypt .
DRA	1%20Samuel	15	3	Now therefore go , and smite Amalec , and utterly destroy all that he hath : spare him not , nor covet any thing that is his : but slay both man and woman , child and suckling , ox and sheep , camel and ass .
DRA	1%20Samuel	15	4	So Saul commanded the people , and numbered them as lambs : two hundred thousand footmen , and ten thousand of the men of Juda .
DRA	1%20Samuel	15	5	And when Saul was come to the city of Amalec , he laid ambushes in the torrent .
DRA	1%20Samuel	15	6	And Saul said to the Cinite : Go , depart and get ye down from Amalec : lest I destroy thee with him . For thou hast shewn kindness to all the children of Israel , when they came up out of Egypt . And the Cinite departed from the midst of Amalec .
DRA	1%20Samuel	15	7	And Saul smote Amalec from Hevila , until thou comest to Sur , which is over against Egypt .
DRA	1%20Samuel	15	8	And he took Agag the king of Amalec alive : but all the common people he slew with the edge of the sword .
DRA	1%20Samuel	15	9	And Saul and the people spared Agag and the best of the flocks of sheep and of the herds , and the garments and the rams , and all that was beautiful , and would not destroy them : but every thing that was vile and good for nothing , that they destroyed .
DRA	1%20Samuel	15	10	And the word of the Lord came to Samuel , saying :
DRA	1%20Samuel	15	11	It repenteth me that I have made Saul king : for he hath forsaken me , and hath not executed my commandments . And Samuel was grieved , and he cried unto the Lord all night .
DRA	1%20Samuel	15	12	And when Samuel rose early , to go to Saul in the morning , it was told Samuel , that Saul was come to Carmel , and had erected for himself a triumphant arch , and returning had passed on , and gone down to Galgal . And Samuel came to Saul , and Saul was offering a holocaust to the Lord out of the choicest of the spoils which he had brought from Amalec .
DRA	1%20Samuel	15	13	And when Samuel was come to Saul , Saul said to him : Blessed be thou of the Lord , I have fulfilled the word of the Lord .
DRA	1%20Samuel	15	14	And Samuel said : What meaneth then this bleating of the flocks , which soundeth in my ears , and the lowing of the herds , which I hear ?

DRA	1%20Samuel	15	19	Why then didst thou not hearken to the voice of the Lord : but hast turned to the prey , and hast done evil in the eyes of the Lord .
DRA	1%20Samuel	15	20	And Saul said to Samuel : Yea I have hearkened to the voice of the Lord , and have walked in the way by which the Lord sent me , and have brought Agag the king of Amalec , and Amalec I have slain .
DRA	1%20Samuel	15	21	But the people took of the spoils sheep and oxen , as the firstfruits of those things that were slain , to offer sacrifice to the Lord their God in Galgal .
DRA	1%20Samuel	15	22	And Samuel said : Doth the Lord desire holocausts and victims , and not rather that the voice of the Lord should be obeyed ? For obedience is better than sacrifices : and to hearken rather than to offer the fat of rams .
DRA	1%20Samuel	15	23	Because it is like the sin of witchcraft , to rebel : and like the crime of idolatry , to refuse to obey . Forasmuch therefore as thou hast rejected the word of the Lord , the Lord hath also rejected thee from being king .
DRA	1%20Samuel	15	24	And Saul said to Samuel : I have sinned because I have transgressed the commandment of the Lord , and thy words , fearing the people , and obeying their voice .

DRA	1%20Samuel	15	26	And Samuel said to Saul : I will not return with thee , because thou hast rejected the word of the Lord , and the Lord hath rejected thee from being king over Israel .

DRA	1%20Samuel	15	28	And Samuel said to him : The Lord hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day , and hath given it to thy neighbour who is better than thee .
DRA	1%20Samuel	15	29	But the triumpher in Israel will riot spare , and will not be moved to repentance : for he is not a mail that he should repent .
DRA	1%20Samuel	15	30	Then he said : I have sinned : yet honour me now before the ancients of my people , and before Israel , and return with me , that I may adore the Lord thy God .
DRA	1%20Samuel	15	31	So Samuel turned again after Saul : and Saul adored the Lord .
DRA	1%20Samuel	15	32	And Samuel said : Bring hitherto me Agag the king of Amalec . And Agag was presented to him very fat , and trembling . And Agag said : Doth bitter death separate in this manner ?
DRA	1%20Samuel	15	33	And Samuel said : As thy sword hath made women childless , so shall thy mother be childless among women . And Samuel hewed him in pieces before the Lord in Galgal .
DRA	1%20Samuel	15	34	And Samuel departed to Ramatha : but Saul went up to his house in Gabaa .

DRA	1%20Samuel	16	12	He sent therefore and brought him Now he was ruddy and beautiful to behold , and of a comely face . And the Lord said : Arise , and anoint him , for this is he .
DRA	1%20Samuel	16	13	Then Samuel took the horn of oil , and anointed him in the midst of his brethren : and the spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward : and Samuel rose up , and went to Ramatha .
DRA	1%20Samuel	16	14	But the spirit of the Lord departed from Saul , and an evil spirit from the Lord troubled him .

DRA	1%20Samuel	16	17	And Saul said to his servants : Provide me then some man that can play well , and bring him to me .
DRA	1%20Samuel	16	18	And one of the servants answering , said : Behold I have seen a son of Isai the Bethlehemite , a skillful player , and one of great strength , and a man fit for war , and prudent in his words , and a comely person : and the Lord is with him .

DRA	1%20Samuel	19	12	She let him down through a window . And he went and fled away and escaped .
DRA	1%20Samuel	19	13	And Michol took an image and laid it on the bed , and put a goat 's skin with the hair at the head of it , and covered it with clothes .
DRA	1%20Samuel	19	14	And Saul sent officers to seize David : and it was answered that he was sick .
DRA	1%20Samuel	19	15	And again Saul sent to see David , saying : Bring him to me in the bed , that he may be slain .
DRA	1%20Samuel	19	16	And when the messengers were come in , they found an image upon the bed , and a goat 's skin at its head .
DRA	1%20Samuel	19	17	And Saul said to Michol : Why hast thou deceived me so , and let my enemy go and flee away ? And Michol answered Saul : Because he said to me : Let me go , or else I will kill thee .
DRA	1%20Samuel	19	18	But David fled and escaped , and came to Samuel in Ramatha , and told him all that Saul had done to him : and he and Samuel went and dwelt in Najoth .
DRA	1%20Samuel	19	20	So Saul sent officers to take David : and when they saw a company of prophets prophesying , and Samuel presiding over them , the spirit of the Lord came also upon them , and they likewise began to prophesy .
DRA	1%20Samuel	19	21	And when this was told Saul , he sent other messengers : but they also prophesied . And again Saul sent messengers the third time : and they prophesied also . And Saul being exceedingly angry ,
DRA	1%20Samuel	19	22	Went also himself to Ramatha , and came as far as the great cistern , which is in Socho , and he asked , and said : In what place are Samuel and David ? And it was told him : Behold they are in Najoth in Ramatha .
DRA	1%20Samuel	19	23	And he went to Najoth in Ramatha , and the spirit of the Lord came upon him also , and he went on , and prophesied till he came to Najoth in Ramatha .
DRA	1%20Samuel	19	24	And he stripped himself also of his garments , and prophesied with the rest before Samuel , and lay down naked all that day and night . This gave occasion to a proverb : What ! is Saul too among the prophets ? Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )

DRA	1%20Samuel	20	1899	American Edition
DRA	1%20Samuel	20	2	And he said to him : God forbid , thou shalt not die : for my father will do nothing great or little , without first telling me : hath then my father hid this word only from me ? no , this shall not be .
DRA	1%20Samuel	20	3	And he swore again to David . And David said : Thy father certainly knoweth that I have found grace in thy sight , and he will say : Let not Jonathan know this , lest he be grieved . But truly as the Lord liveth , and thy soul liveth , there is but one step ( as I may say ) between me and death .
DRA	1%20Samuel	20	4	And Jonathan said to David : Whatsoever thy soul shall say to me , I will do for thee .
DRA	1%20Samuel	20	5	And David said to Jonathan : Behold to morrow is the new moon , and I according to custom am wont to sit beside the king to eat : let me go then that I may be hid in the field till the evening of the third day .
DRA	1%20Samuel	20	6	If thy father look and inquire for me , thou shalt answer him : David asked me that he might run to Bethlehem his own city : because there are solemn sacrifices there for all his tribe .
DRA	1%20Samuel	20	7	If he shall say , It is well : thy servant shall have peace : but if he be angry , know that his malice is come to its height .
DRA	1%20Samuel	20	8	Deal mercifully then with thy servant : for thou hast brought me thy servant into a covenant of the Lord with thee . But if there be any iniquity in me , do thou kill me , and bring me not in to thy father .
DRA	1%20Samuel	20	9	And Jonathan said : Far be this from thee : for if I should certainly know that evil is determined by my father against thee , I could do no otherwise than tell thee .
DRA	1%20Samuel	20	10	And David answered Jonathan : Who shall bring me word , if thy father should answer thee harshly concerning me ?
DRA	1%20Samuel	20	11	And Jonathan said to David : Come and let us go out into the field . And when they were both of them gone out into the field ,
DRA	1%20Samuel	20	12	Jonathan said to David : O Lord God of Israel , if I shall discover my father 's mind , to morrow or the day after , and there be any thing good for David , and I send not immediately to thee , and make it known to thee ,
DRA	1%20Samuel	20	13	May the Lord do so and so to Jonathan and add still more . But if my father shall continue in malice against thee , I will discover it to thy ear , and will send thee away , that thou mayest go in peace , and the Lord be with thee , as he hath been with my father .
DRA	1%20Samuel	20	14	And if I live , thou shalt shew me the kindness of the Lord : but if I die ,
DRA	1%20Samuel	20	15	Thou shalt not take away thy kindness from my house for ever , when the Lord shall have rooted out the enemies of David , every one of them from the earth , may he take away Jonathan from his house , and may the Lord require it at the hands of David 's enemies .
DRA	1%20Samuel	20	16	Jonathan therefore made a covenant with the house of David : and the Lord required it at the hands of David 's enemies .
DRA	1%20Samuel	20	17	And Jonathan swore again to David , because he loved him : for he loved him as his own soul .
DRA	1%20Samuel	20	18	And Jonathan said to him : To morrow is the new moon , and thou wilt be missed :
DRA	1%20Samuel	20	19	For thy seat will be empty till after to morrow . So thou shalt go down quickly , and come to the place , where thou must be hid on the day when it is lawful to work , and thou shalt remain beside the stone , which is called Ezel .
DRA	1%20Samuel	20	21	And I will send a boy , saying to him : Go and fetch me the arrows .
DRA	1%20Samuel	20	22	If I shall say to the boy : Behold the arrows are on this side of thee , take them up : come thou to me , because , there is peace to thee , and there is no evil , as the Lord liveth . But if I shall speak thus to the boy : Behold the arrows are beyond thee : go in peace , for the Lord hath sent thee away .
DRA	1%20Samuel	20	23	And concerning the word which I and thou have spoken , the Lord be between thee and me for ever .
DRA	1%20Samuel	20	24	So David was hid in the field , and the new moon came , and the king sat down to eat bread .
DRA	1%20Samuel	20	25	And when the king sat down upon his chair ( according to custom ) which was beside the wall , Jonathan arose , and Abner sat by Saul 's side , and David 's place appeared empty .
DRA	1%20Samuel	20	26	And Saul said nothing that day , for he thought it might have happened to him , that he was not clean , nor purified .
DRA	1%20Samuel	20	27	And when the second day after the new moon was come , David 's place appeared empty again . And Saul said to Jonathan his son : Why cometh not the son of Isai to meat neither yesterday nor to day ?
DRA	1%20Samuel	20	28	And Jonathan answered Saul : He asked leave of me earnestly to go to Bethlehem ,
DRA	1%20Samuel	20	29	And he said : Let me go , for there is a solemn sacrifice in the city , one of my brethren hath sent for me : and now if I have found favour in thy eyes , I will go quickly , and see my brethren . For this cause he came not to the king 's table .
DRA	1%20Samuel	20	30	Then Saul being angry against Jonathan said to him : Thou son of a woman that is the ravisher of a man , do I not know that thou lovest the son of Isai to thy own confusion and to the confusion of thy shameless mother ?
DRA	1%20Samuel	20	31	For as long as the son of Isai liveth upon earth , thou shalt not be established , nor thy kingdom . Therefore now presently send , and fetch him to me : for he is the son of death .
DRA	1%20Samuel	20	32	And Jonathan answering Saul his father , said : Why shall he die : what hath he done ?
DRA	1%20Samuel	20	33	And Saul caught up a spear to strike him . And Jonathan understood that it was determined by his father to kill David .
DRA	1%20Samuel	20	34	So Jonathan rose from the table in great anger , and did not eat bread on the second day after the new moon . For he was grieved for David , because his father had put him to confusion .
DRA	1%20Samuel	20	35	And when the morning came , Jonathan went into the field , according to the appointment with David , and a little boy with him .
DRA	1%20Samuel	20	36	And he said to his boy : Go , and fetch me the arrows which I shoot . And when the boy ran , he shot another arrow beyond the boy .
DRA	1%20Samuel	20	37	The boy therefore came to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot : and Jonathan cried after the boy , and said : Behold the arrow is there further beyond thee .
DRA	1%20Samuel	20	38	And Jonathan cried again after the boy , saying : Make haste speedily , stand not . And Jonathan 's boy gathered up the arrows , and brought them to his master :
DRA	1%20Samuel	20	39	And he knew not at all what was doing : for only Jonathan and David knew the matter .
DRA	1%20Samuel	20	40	Jonathan therefore gave his arms to the boy , and said to him : Go , and carry them into the city .
DRA	1%20Samuel	20	41	And when the boy was gone , David rose out of his place , which was towards the south , and falling on his face to the ground , adored thrice : and kissing one another , they wept together , but David more .
DRA	1%20Samuel	20	42	And Jonathan said to David : Go in peace : and let all stand that we have sworn both of us in the name of the Lord , saying : The Lord be between me and thee , and between my seed and thy seed for ever .

DRA	1%20Samuel	21	2	And David said to Achimelech the priest : The king hath commanded me a business , and said : Let no man know the thing for which thou art sent by me , and what manner of commands I have given thee : and I have appointed my servants to such and such a place .
DRA	1%20Samuel	21	3	Now therefore if thou have any thing at hand , though it were but five loaves , give me , or whatsoever thou canst find .
DRA	1%20Samuel	21	4	And the priest answered David , saying : I have no common bread at hand , but only holy bread , if the young men be clean , especially from women ?
DRA	1%20Samuel	21	5	And David answered the priest , and said to him : Truly , as to what concerneth women , we have refrained ourselves from yesterday and the day before , when we came out , and the vessels of the young men were holy . Now this way is defiled , but it shall also be sanctified this day in the vessels .
DRA	1%20Samuel	21	6	The priest therefore gave him hallowed bread : for there was no bread there , but only the loaves of proposition , which had been taken away from before the face of the Lord , that hot loaves might be set up .
DRA	1%20Samuel	21	7	Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day , within the tabernacle of the Lord : and his name was Doeg , an Edomite , the chiefest of Saul 's herdsmen .
DRA	1%20Samuel	21	8	And David said to Achimelech : Hast thou here at hand a spear , or a sword ? for I brought not my own sword , nor my own weapons with me , for the king 's business required haste .
DRA	1%20Samuel	21	9	And the priest said : Lo , here is the sword of Goliath the Philistine whom thou slewest in the valley of Terebinth , wrapped up in a cloth behind the ephod : if thou wilt take this , take it , for here is no other but this . And David said : There is none like that , give it me .
DRA	1%20Samuel	21	10	And David arose and fled that day from the face of Saul : and came to Achis the king of Geth :
DRA	1%20Samuel	21	11	And the servants of Achis , when they saw David , said to him : Is not this David the king of the land ? Did they not sing to him in their dances , saying : Saul hath slain his thousands , and David his ten thousands ?
DRA	1%20Samuel	21	12	But David laid up these words in his heart , and was exceedingly afraid at the face of Achis the king of Geth .
DRA	1%20Samuel	21	13	And he changed his countenance before them , and slipt down between their hands : and he stumbled against the doors of the gate , and his spittle ran down upon his beard .
DRA	1%20Samuel	21	14	And Achis said to his servants : You saw the man was mad : why have you brought him to me ?

DRA	1%20Samuel	22	3	And David departed from thence into Maspha of Moab : and he said to the king of Moab : Let my father and my mother tarry with you , I beseech thee , till I know what God will do for me .
DRA	1%20Samuel	22	4	And he left them under the eyes of the king of Moab , and they abode with him all the days that David was in the hold .
DRA	1%20Samuel	22	5	And Gad the prophet said to David : Abide not in the hold , depart , and go into the land of Juda . And David departed , and came into the forest of Haret .
DRA	1%20Samuel	22	6	And Saul heard that David was seen , and the men that were with him . Now whilst Saul abode in Gabaa , and was in the wood , which is by Rama , having his spear in his hand , and all his servants were standing about him ,
DRA	1%20Samuel	22	7	He said to his servants that stood about him : Hear me now , ye sons of Jemini : will the son of Isai give everyone of you fields , and vineyards , and make you all tribunes , and centurions :
DRA	1%20Samuel	22	8	That all of you have conspired against me , and there is no one to inform me , especially when even my son hath entered into league with the soil of Isai ? There is not one of you that pitieth my case , nor that giveth me any information : because my son hath raised up my servant against me , plotting against me to this day .
DRA	1%20Samuel	22	9	And Doeg the Edomite who stood by , and was the chief among the servants of Saul , answering , said : I saw the son of Isai , in Nobe with Achimelech the son of Achitob the priest .
DRA	1%20Samuel	22	10	And he consulted the Lord for him , and gave him victuals , and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine .

DRA	1%20Samuel	22	13	And Saul said to him : Why have you conspired against me , thou , and the son of Isai , and thou hast given him bread and a sword , and hast consulted the Lord for him , that he should rise up against me , continuing a traitor to this day .
DRA	1%20Samuel	22	14	And Achimelech answering the king , said : And who amongst all thy servants is so faithful as David , who is the king 's son in law , and goeth forth at thy bidding , and is honourable in thy house ?
DRA	1%20Samuel	22	15	Did I begin to day to consult the Lord for him ? far be this from me : let not the king suspect such a thing against his servant , or any one in all my father 's house : for thy servant knew nothing of this matter , either little or great .
DRA	1%20Samuel	22	16	And the king said : Dying thou shalt die , Achimelech , thou and all thy father 's house .
DRA	1%20Samuel	22	17	And the king said to the messengers that stood about him : Turn , and kill the priests of the Lord , for their hand is with David , because they knew that he was fled , and they told it not to me .

DRA	1%20Samuel	23	2	Therefore David consulted the Lord , saying : Shall I go and smite these Philistines ? And the Lord said to David : Go , and thou shalt smite the Philistines , and shalt save Ceila .
DRA	1%20Samuel	23	3	And the men that were with David , said to him : Behold we are in fear here in Judea , how much more if we go to Ceila against the hands of the Philistines ?
DRA	1%20Samuel	23	4	Therefore David consulted the Lord again . And he answered and said to him : Arise , and go to Ceila : for I will deliver the Philistines into thy hand .
DRA	1%20Samuel	23	5	David therefore , and his men , went to Ceila , and fought against the Philistines , and brought away their cattle , and made a great slaughter of them : and David saved the inhabitants of Ceila .
DRA	1%20Samuel	23	6	Now at that time , when Abiathar the son of Achimelech fled to David to Ceila , he came down having an ephod with him .

DRA	1%20Samuel	23	8	And Saul commanded all the people to go down to fight against Ceila , and to besiege David , and his men .
DRA	1%20Samuel	23	9	Now when David understood , that Saul secretly prepared evil against him , he said to Abiathar the priest : Bring hither the ephod .
DRA	1%20Samuel	23	10	And David said : O Lord God of Israel , thy servant hath heard a report , that Saul designeth to come to Ceila , to destroy the city for my sake :
DRA	1%20Samuel	23	11	Will the men of Ceila deliver me into his hands ? and will Saul come down , as thy servant hath heard ? O Lord God of Israel , tell thy servant . And the Lord said : He will come down .
DRA	1%20Samuel	23	12	And David said : Will the men of Ceila deliver me , and my men , into the hands of Saul ? And the Lord said : They will deliver thee up .
DRA	1%20Samuel	23	13	Then David and his men , who were about six hundred , arose , and departing from Ceila , wandered up and down uncertain where they should stay : and it was told Saul that David was fled from Ceila , and had escaped : wherefore he forbore to go out .

DRA	1%20Samuel	23	16	And Jonathan the son of Saul arose , and went to David into the wood , and strengthened his hands in God : and he said to him :
DRA	1%20Samuel	23	17	Fear not : for the hand of my father Saul shall not find thee , and thou shalt reign over Israel , and I shall be next to thee , yea , and my father knoweth this .
DRA	1%20Samuel	23	18	And the two made a covenant before the Lord : and David abode in the wood : but Jonathan returned to his house .
DRA	1%20Samuel	23	19	And the Ziphites went up to Saul in Gabaa , saying : Lo , doth not David lie hid with us in the strong holds of the wood , in mount Hachila , which is on the right hand of the desert .
DRA	1%20Samuel	23	20	Now therefore come down , as thy soul hath desired to come down : and it shall be our business to deliver him into the king 's hands .
DRA	1%20Samuel	23	21	And Saul said : Blessed be ye of the Lord , for you have pitied my case .
DRA	1%20Samuel	23	22	Go therefore , I pray you , and use all diligence , and curiously inquire , and consider the place where his foot is , and who hath seen him there : for he thinketh of me , that I lie craftily in wait for him .
DRA	1%20Samuel	23	24	And they arose and went to Ziph before Saul : and David and his men were in the desert of Maon , in the plain at the right hand of Jesimon .
DRA	1%20Samuel	23	25	Then Saul and his men went to seek him : and it was told David , and forthwith he went down to the rock , and abode in the wilderness of Maon : and when Saul had heard of it he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon .

DRA	1%20Samuel	24	5	And the servants of David said to him : Behold the day , of which the Lord said to thee : I will deliver thy enemy unto thee , that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good in thy eyes . Then David arose , and secretly cut off the hem of Saul 's robe .

DRA	1%20Samuel	25	5	He sent ten young men , and said to them : Go up to Carmel , and go to Nabal , and salute him in my name with peace .
DRA	1%20Samuel	25	6	And you shall say : Peace be to my brethren , and to thee , and peace to thy house , and peace to all that thou hast .
DRA	1%20Samuel	25	7	I heard that thy shepherds that were with us in the desert were shearing : we never molested them , neither was there ought missing to them of the flock at any time , all the while they were with us in Carmel .
DRA	1%20Samuel	25	8	Ask thy servants , and they will tell thee . Now therefore let thy servants find favour in thy eyes : for we are come in a good day , whatsoever thy hand shall find give to thy servants , and to thy son David .
DRA	1%20Samuel	25	9	And when David 's servants came , they spoke to Nabal all these words in David 's name : and then held their peace .
DRA	1%20Samuel	25	10	But Nabal answering the servants of David , said : Who is David ? and what is the son of Isai ? servants are multiplied now a days who flee from their masters .
DRA	1%20Samuel	25	11	Shall I then take my bread , and my water , and the flesh of my cattle , which I have killed for my shearers , and give to men whom I know not whence they are ?
DRA	1%20Samuel	25	12	So the servants of David went back their way , and returning came and told him all the words that he said .
DRA	1%20Samuel	25	13	Then David said to his young men : Let every man gird on his sword . And they girded on every man his sword . And David also girded on his sword : and there followed David about four hundred men : and two hundred remained with the baggage .
DRA	1%20Samuel	25	14	But one of the servants told Abigail the wife of Nabal , saying : Behold David sent messengers out of the wilderness , to salute our master : and he rejected them .
DRA	1%20Samuel	25	15	These men were very good to us , and gave us no trouble : neither did we ever lose any thing all the time that we conversed with them in the desert .
DRA	1%20Samuel	25	16	They were a wall unto us both by night and day , all the while we were with them keeping the sheep .
DRA	1%20Samuel	25	17	Wherefore consider , and think what thou hast to do : for evil is determined against thy husband , and against thy house , and he is a son of Belial , so that no man can speak to him .
DRA	1%20Samuel	25	18	Then Abigail made haste and took two hundred loaves , and two vessels of wine , and five sheep ready dressed , and five measures of parched corn , and a hundred clusters of raisins , and two hundred cakes of dry figs , and laid them upon asses :
DRA	1%20Samuel	25	19	And she said to her servants : Go before me : behold I will follow after you : but she told not her husband Nabal .
DRA	1%20Samuel	25	20	And when she had gotten upon an ass , and was coming down to the foot of the mountain , David and his men came down over against her , and she met them .
DRA	1%20Samuel	25	21	And David said : Truly in vain have I kept all that belonged to this man in the wilderness , and nothing was lost of all that pertained unto him : and he hath returned me evil for good .
DRA	1%20Samuel	25	22	May God do so and so , and add more to the foes of David , if I leave of all that belong to him till the morning , any that pisseth against the wall .
DRA	1%20Samuel	25	23	And when Abigail saw David she made haste and lighted off the ass , and fell before David , on her face , and adored upon the ground .
DRA	1%20Samuel	25	24	And she fell at his feet , and said : Upon me let this iniquity be , my lord : let thy handmaid speak , I beseech thee , in thy ears : and hear the words of thy servant .
DRA	1%20Samuel	25	26	Now therefore , my lord , the Lord liveth , and thy soul liveth , who hath withholden thee from coming to blood , and hath saved thy hand to thee : and now let thy enemies be as Nabal , and all they that seek evil to my lord .
DRA	1%20Samuel	25	27	Wherefore receive this blessing , which thy handmaid hath brought to thee , my lord : and give it to the young men that follow thee , my lord .
DRA	1%20Samuel	25	28	Forgive the iniquity of thy handmaid : for the Lord will surely make for my lord a faithful house , because thou , my lord , fightest the battles of the Lord : let not evil therefore be found in thee all the days of thy life .
DRA	1%20Samuel	25	29	For if a man at any time shall rise , and persecute thee , and seek thy life , the soul of my lord shall be kept , as in the bundle of the living , with the Lord thy God : but the souls of thy enemies shall be whirled , as with the violence and whirling of a sling .
DRA	1%20Samuel	25	30	And when the Lord shall have done to thee , my lord , all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee , and shall have made thee prince over Israel ,
DRA	1%20Samuel	25	31	This shall not be an occasion of grief to thee , and a scruple of heart to my lord , that thou hast shed innocent blood , or hast revenged thyself : and when the Lord shall have done well by my lord , thou shalt remember thy handmaid .
DRA	1%20Samuel	25	32	And David said to Abigail : Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel , who sent thee this day to meet me , and blessed be thy speech :
DRA	1%20Samuel	25	33	And blessed be thou , who hast kept me to day , from coming to blood , and revenging me with my own hand .
DRA	1%20Samuel	25	34	Otherwise as the Lord liveth the God of Israel , who hath withholden me from doing thee any evil : if thou hadst not quickly come to meet me , there had not been left to Nabal by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall .
DRA	1%20Samuel	25	35	And David received at her hand all that she had brought him , and said to her : Go in peace into thy house , behold I have heard thy voice , and have honoured thy face .
DRA	1%20Samuel	25	36	And Abigail came to Nabal : and behold he had a feast in his house , like the feast of a king , and Nabal 's heart was merry : for he was very drunk : and she told him nothing less or more until morning .
DRA	1%20Samuel	25	37	But early in the morning when Nabal had digested his wine , his wife told him these words , and his heart died within him , and he became as a stone .
DRA	1%20Samuel	25	38	And after ten days had passed , the Lord struck Nabal , and he died .
DRA	1%20Samuel	25	39	And when David had heard that Nabal was dead , he said : Blessed be the Lord , who hath judged the cause of my reproach at the hand of Nabal , and hath kept his servant from evil , and the Lord hath returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his head . Then David sent and treated with Abigail , that he might take her to himself for a wife .
DRA	1%20Samuel	25	40	And David 's servants came to Abigail to Carmel , and spoke to her , saying : David hath sent us to thee , to take thee to himself for a wife .
DRA	1%20Samuel	25	41	And she arose and bowed herself down with her face to the earth , and said : Behold , let thy servant be a handmaid , to wash the feet of the servants of my lord .
DRA	1%20Samuel	25	42	And Abigail arose , and made haste , and got upon an ass , and five damsels went with her , her waiting maids , and she followed the messengers of David , and became his wife .
DRA	1%20Samuel	25	43	Moreover David took also Achinoam of Jezrahel : and they were both of them his wives .

DRA	1%20Samuel	26	26	And the men of Ziph came to Saul in Gabaa , saying : Behold David is hid in the hill of Hachila , which is over against the wilderness .
DRA	1%20Samuel	26	1899	American Edition
DRA	1%20Samuel	26	2	And Saul arose , and went down to the wilderness of Ziph , having with him three thousand chosen men of Israel , to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph .
DRA	1%20Samuel	26	3	And Saul encamped in Gabaa Hachila , which was over against the wilderness in the way : and David abode in the wilderness . And seeing that Saul was come after him into the wilderness ,
DRA	1%20Samuel	26	4	He sent spies , and learned that he was most certainly come thither .
DRA	1%20Samuel	26	5	And David arose secretly , and came to the place where Saul was : and when he had beheld the place , wherein Saul slept , and Abner the son of Ner , the captain of his army , and Saul sleeping in a tent , and the rest of the multitude round about him ,
DRA	1%20Samuel	26	6	David spoke to Achimelech the Hethite , and Abisai the son of Sarvia the brother of Joab , saying : Who will go down with me to Saul into the camp ? And Abisai said : I will go with thee .
DRA	1%20Samuel	26	7	So David and Abisai came to the people by night , and found Saul lying and sleeping in the tent , and his spear fixed in the ground at his head : and Abner and the people sleeping round about him .
DRA	1%20Samuel	26	8	And Abisai said to David : God hath shut up thy enemy this day into thy hands : now then I will run him through with my spear even to the earth at once , and there shall be no need of a second time .
DRA	1%20Samuel	26	9	And David said to Abisai : Kill him not : for who shall put forth his hand against the Lord 's anointed , and shall be guiltless ?
DRA	1%20Samuel	26	10	And David said : As the Lord liveth , unless the Lord shall strike him , or his day shall come to die , or he shall go down to battle and perish :
DRA	1%20Samuel	26	11	The Lord be merciful unto me , that I extend not my hand upon the Lord 's anointed . But now take the spear , which is at his head , and the cup of water , and let us go .
DRA	1%20Samuel	26	12	So David took the spear , and the cup of water which was at Saul 's head , and they went away : and no man saw it , or knew it , or awaked , but they were all asleep , for a deep sleep from the Lord was fallen upon them .
DRA	1%20Samuel	26	13	And when David was gone over to the other side . and stood on the top of the hill afar off , and a good space was between them ,
DRA	1%20Samuel	26	14	David cried to the people , and to Abner the son of Ner , saying : Wilt thou not answer , Abner ? And Abner answering , said : Who art thou , that criest , and disturbest the king ?
DRA	1%20Samuel	26	15	And David said to Abner : Art not thou a man ? and who is like thee in Israel ? why then hast thou not kept thy lord the king ? for there came one of the people in to kill the king thy lord .
DRA	1%20Samuel	26	16	This thing is not good , that thou hast done : as the Lord liveth , you are the sons of death , who have not kept your master , the Lord 's anointed . And now where is the king 's spear , and the cup of water , which was at his head ?
DRA	1%20Samuel	26	17	And Saul knew David 's voice , and said : Is this thy voice , my son David ? And David said : It is my voice , my lord the king .
DRA	1%20Samuel	26	18	And he said : Wherefore doth my lord persecute his servant ? What have I done ? or what evil is there in my hand ?
DRA	1%20Samuel	26	19	Now therefore hear , I pray thee , my lord the king , the words of thy servant : If the Lord stir thee up against me , let him accept of sacrifice : but if the sons of men , they are cursed in the sight of the Lord , who have cast me out this day , that I should not dwell in the inheritance of the Lord , saying : Go , serve strange gods .
DRA	1%20Samuel	26	20	And now let not my blood be shed upon the earth before the Lord : for the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea , as the partridge is hunted in the mountains .
DRA	1%20Samuel	26	21	And Saul said : I have sinned , return , my son David , for I will no more do thee harm , because my life hath been precious in thy eyes this day : for it appeareth that I have done foolishly , and have been ignorant in very many things .
DRA	1%20Samuel	26	22	And David answering , said : Behold the king 's spear : let one of the king 's servants come over and fetch it .
DRA	1%20Samuel	26	23	And the Lord will reward every one according to his justice , and his faithfulness : for the Lord hath delivered thee this day into my hand , and I would not put forth my hand against the Lord 's anointed .

DRA	1%20Samuel	27	27	And David said in his heart : I shall gone day or other fall into the hands of Saul : is it not better for me to flee , and to be saved in the land of the Philistines , that Saul may despair of me , and cease to seek me in all the coasts of Israel ? I will flee then out of his hands .

DRA	1%20Samuel	28	3	Now Samuel was dead , and all Israel mourned for him , and buried him in Ramatha his city . And Saul had put away all the magicians and soothsayers out of the land .
DRA	1%20Samuel	28	4	And the Philistines were gathered together , and came and camped in Sunam : and Saul also gathered together all Israel , and came to Gelboe .

DRA	1%20Samuel	28	9	And the woman said to him : Behold thou knowest all that Saul hath done , and how he hath rooted out the magicians and soothsayers from the land : why then dost thou lay a snare for my life , to cause me to be put to death ?

DRA	1%20Samuel	28	16	And Samuel said : Why askest thou me , seeing the Lord has departed from thee , and is gone over to thy rival :
DRA	1%20Samuel	28	17	For the Lord will do to thee as he spoke by me , and he will rend thy kingdom out of thy hand , and will give it to thy neighbour David :

DRA	1%20Samuel	29	5	Is not this David , to whom they sung in their dances , saying : Saul slew his thousands , and David his ten thousands ?
DRA	1%20Samuel	29	6	Then Achis called David , and said to him : As the Lord liveth , thou art upright and good in my sight : and so is thy going out , and thy coming in with me in the army : and I have not found my evil in thee , since the day that thou camest to me unto this day : but thou pleasest not the lords .

DRA	2%20Samuel	2	9	And made him king over Galaad , and , over Gessuri , and over Jezrahel , and over Ephraim , and over Benjamin , and over all Israel .
DRA	2%20Samuel	2	10	Isboseth the son of Saul was forty years old when he began to reign over , Israel , and he reigned two years : and only the house of Juda followed David .
DRA	2%20Samuel	2	11	And the number of the days that David abode , reigning in Hebron over the house of Juda , was seven years and six months .
DRA	2%20Samuel	2	12	And Abner the son of Ner , and the servants of Isboseth the son of Saul , went out from the camp to Gabaon .
DRA	2%20Samuel	2	13	And Joab the son of Sarvia , and the servants of David went out , and met them by the pool of Gabaon . And when they were come together , they sat down over against one another : the one on the one side of the pool , and the other on the other side .
DRA	2%20Samuel	2	14	And Abner said to Joab : Let the young men rise , and play before us . And Joab answered : Let them rise .

DRA	2%20Samuel	2	16	And every one catching his fellow , by the head , thrust his sword into the side of his adversary , and they fell down together : and the name of the place was called : The field of the valiant , in Gabaon .

DRA	2%20Samuel	2	18	And there were the three sons of Sarvia there , Joab , and Abisai , and Asael : now Asael was a most swift runner , like one of the roes that abide in the woods .
DRA	2%20Samuel	2	19	And Asael pursued after Abner , and turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner .
DRA	2%20Samuel	2	20	And Abner looked behind him , and said : Art thou Asael ? And he answered : I am .
DRA	2%20Samuel	2	21	And Abner said to him : Go to the right hand or to the left , and lay hold on one of the young men and take thee his spoils . But Asael would not leave off following him close .
DRA	2%20Samuel	2	22	And again Abner said to Asael : Go off , and do not follow me , lest I be obliged to stab thee to the ground , and I shall not be able to hold up my face to Joab thy brother .
DRA	2%20Samuel	2	23	But he refused to hearken to him , and would not turn aside : wherefore Abner struck him with his spear with a back stroke in the groin , and thrust him through , and he died upon the spot : and all that came to the place where Asael fell down and died stood still .
DRA	2%20Samuel	2	24	Now while Joab and Abisai pursued after Abner , the sun went down : and they came as far as the hill of the aqueduct , that lieth over against the valley by the way of the wilderness in Gabaon .

DRA	2%20Samuel	2	26	And Abner cried out to Joab , and said : Shall thy sword rage unto utter destruction ? knowest thou not that it is dangerous to drive people to despair ? how long dost thou defer to bid the people cease from pursuing after their brethren ?
DRA	2%20Samuel	2	27	And Joab said : As the Lord liveth , if thou hadst spoke sooner , even in the morning the people should have retired from pursuing after their brethren .
DRA	2%20Samuel	2	28	Then Joab sounded the trumpet , and all the army stood still , and did not pursue after Israel any farther , nor fight any more .
DRA	2%20Samuel	2	29	And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plains : and they passed the Jordan , and having gone through all Beth-horon , came to the camp .
DRA	2%20Samuel	2	30	And Joab returning , after he had left Abner , assembled all the people : and there were wanting of David 's servants nineteen men , beside Asael .
DRA	2%20Samuel	2	31	But the servants of David had killed of Benjamin , and of the men that were with Abner , three hundred and sixty , who all died .

DRA	2%20Samuel	3	8	Why didst thou go in to my father 's concubine ? And he was exceedingly angry for the words of Isboseth , and said : Am I a dog 's head against Juda this day , who have shewn mercy to the house of Saul thy father , and to his brethren and friends , and have not delivered thee into the hands of David , and hast thou sought this day against me to charge me with a matter concerning a woman ?
DRA	2%20Samuel	3	9	So do God to Abner , and more also , unless as the Lord hath sworn to David , so I do to him ,
DRA	2%20Samuel	3	10	That the kingdom be translated from the house of Saul , and the throne of David be set up over Israel , and over Juda from Dan to Bersabee .
DRA	2%20Samuel	3	11	And he could not answer him a word , because he feared him .
DRA	2%20Samuel	3	12	Abner therefore sent messengers to David for himself , saying : Whose is the land ? and that they should say : Make a league with me , and my hand shall be with thee : and I will bring all Israel to thee .
DRA	2%20Samuel	3	13	And he said : Very well : I will make a league with thee : but one thing I require of thee , saying : Thou shalt not see my face before thou bring Michol the daughter of Saul : and so thou shalt come , and see me .
DRA	2%20Samuel	3	14	And David sent messengers to Isboseth the son of Saul , saying : Restore my wife Michol , whom I espoused to me for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines .
DRA	2%20Samuel	3	15	And Isboseth sent , and took her from her husband Phaltiel , the son of Lais .
DRA	2%20Samuel	3	16	And her husband followed her , weeping as far as Bahurim : and Abner said to him : Go and return . And he returned .
DRA	2%20Samuel	3	17	Abner also spoke to the ancients of Israel , saying : Both yesterday and the day before you sought for David that he might reign over you .
DRA	2%20Samuel	3	18	Now then do it : because the Lord hath spoken to David , saying : By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel from the hands of the Philistines , and of all their enemies .
DRA	2%20Samuel	3	19	And Abner spoke also to Benjamin . And he went to speak to David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel , and to all Benjamin .
DRA	2%20Samuel	3	20	And he came to David in Hebron with twenty men : and David made a feast for Abner , and his men that came with him .
DRA	2%20Samuel	3	21	And Abner said to David : I will rise , that I may gather all Israel unto thee my lord the king , and may enter into a league with thee , and that thou mayst reign over all as thy soul desireth . Now when David bad brought Abner on his way , and he was gone in peace ,
DRA	2%20Samuel	3	22	Immediately David 's servants and Joab came , after having slain the robbers , with an exceeding great booty : and Abner , was not with David in Hebron , for he had now sent him away , and he was gone in peace .
DRA	2%20Samuel	3	23	And Joab and all the army that was with him , came afterwards : and it was told Joab , that Abner the son of Ner came to the king , and he hath sent him away , and he is gone in peace .
DRA	2%20Samuel	3	24	And Joab went in to the king , and said : What hast thou done ? Behold Abner came to thee : Why didst thou send him away , and he is gone and departed ?
DRA	2%20Samuel	3	25	Knowest thou not Abner the son of Ner , that to this end he came to thee , that he might deceive thee , and to know thy going out , and thy coming in , and to know all thou dost ?
DRA	2%20Samuel	3	26	Then Joab going out from David , sent messengers after Abner , and brought him back from the cistern of Sira , David knowing nothing of it .
DRA	2%20Samuel	3	27	And when Abner was returned to Hebron , Joab took him aside to the middle of the gate , to speak to him treacherously : and he stabbed him there in the groin , and he died , in revenge of the blood of Asael his brother .
DRA	2%20Samuel	3	28	And when David heard of it , after the thing was now done , he said : I , and my kingdom are innocent before the Lord for ever of the blood of Abner the son of Ner :
DRA	2%20Samuel	3	29	And may it come upon the head of Joab , and upon all his father 's house : and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue of seed , or that is a leper , or that holdeth the distaff , or that falleth by the sword , or that wanteth bread .
DRA	2%20Samuel	3	30	So Joab and Abisai his brother slew Abner , because he had killed their brother Asael at Gabaon in the battle .
DRA	2%20Samuel	3	31	And David said to Joab , and to all the people that were with him : Rend your garments , and gird yourselves with sackcloths , and mourn before the funeral of Abner . And king David himself followed the bier .

DRA	2%20Samuel	3	33	And the king mourning and lamenting over Abner , said : Not as cowards are wont to die , hath Abner died .
DRA	2%20Samuel	3	34	Thy hands were not bound , nor thy feet laden with fetters : but as men fall before the children of iniquity , so didst thou fall . And all the people repeating it wept over him .
DRA	2%20Samuel	3	35	And when all the people came to take meat with David , while it was yet broad day , David swore , saying : So do God to me , and more also , if I taste bread or any thing else before sunset .

DRA	2%20Samuel	24	11	And David arose in the morning , and the word of the Lord came to Gad the prophet and the seer of David , saying :

DRA	1%20Kings	1	2	His servants therefore said to him : Let us seek for our lord the king , a young virgin , and let her stand before the king , and cherish him , and sleep in his bosom , and warm our lord the king .
DRA	1%20Kings	1	3	So they sought a beautiful young woman in all the coasts of Israel , and they found Abisag a Sunamitess , and brought her to the king .
DRA	1%20Kings	1	4	And the damsel was exceeding beautiful , and she slept with the king : and served him , but the king did not know her .
DRA	1%20Kings	1	5	And Adonias the son of Haggith exalted himself , saying : I will be king . And he made himself chariots and horsemen , and fifty men to run before him .
DRA	1%20Kings	1	6	Neither did his father rebuke him at any time , saying : Why hast thou done this ? And he also was very beautiful , the next in birth after Absalom .
DRA	1%20Kings	1	7	And he conferred with Joab the son of Sarvia , and with Abiathar the priest , who furthered Adonias 's side .
DRA	1%20Kings	1	8	But Sadoc the priest , and Banaias the son of Joiada , and Nathan the prophet , and Semei , and Rei , and the strength of David 's army was not with Adonias .
DRA	1%20Kings	1	9	And Adonias having slain rams and calves , and all fat cattle by the stone of Zoheleth , which was near the fountain Rogel , invited all his brethren the king 's sons , and all the men of Juda , the king 's servants :
DRA	1%20Kings	1	10	But Nathan the prophet , and Banaias , and all the valiant men , and Solomon his brother , he invited not .
DRA	1%20Kings	1	11	And Nathan said to Bethsabee the mother of Solomon : Hast thou not heard that Adonias the son of Haggith reigneth , and our lord David knoweth it not ?
DRA	1%20Kings	1	12	Now then come , take my counsel and save thy life , and the life of thy son Solomon .
DRA	1%20Kings	1	13	Go , and get thee in to king David , and say to him : Didst not thou , my lord O king , swear to me thy handmaid , saying : Solomon thy son shall reign after me , and he shall sit on my throne ? why then doth Adonias reign ?
DRA	1%20Kings	1	14	And while thou art yet speaking there with the king , I will come in after thee , and will fill up thy words .
DRA	1%20Kings	1	15	So Bethsabee went in to the king into the chamber : now the king was very old , and Abisag the Sunamitess ministered to him .
DRA	1%20Kings	1	16	Bethsabee bowed herself , and worshipped the king . And the king said to her : What is thy will ?
DRA	1%20Kings	1	17	She answered and said : My lord , thou didst swear to thy handmaid by the Lord thy God , saying : Solomon thy son shall reign after me , and he shall sit on my throne .
DRA	1%20Kings	1	18	And behold now Adonias reigneth , and thou , my lord the king , knowest nothing of it .
DRA	1%20Kings	1	19	He hath killed oxen , and all fat cattle , and many rams , and invited all the king 's sons , and Abiathar the priest , and Joab the general of the army : but Solomon thy servant he invited not .
DRA	1%20Kings	1	20	And now , my lord O king , the eyes of all Israel are upon thee , that thou shouldst tell them , who shall sit on thy throne , my lord the king , after thee .
DRA	1%20Kings	1	21	Otherwise it shall come to pass , when my lord the king sleepeth with his fathers , that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders .
DRA	1%20Kings	1	22	As she was yet speaking with the king , Nathan the prophet came .
DRA	1%20Kings	1	23	And they told the king , saying : Nathan the prophet is here . And when he was come in before the king , and had worshipped , bowing down to the ground ,
DRA	1%20Kings	1	24	Nathan said : My lord O king , hast thou said : Let Adonias reign after me , and let him sit upon my throne ?
DRA	1%20Kings	1	25	Because he is gone down to day , and hath killed oxen , and fatlings , and many rams , and invited all the king 's sons , and the captains of the army , and Abiathar the priest : and they are eating and drinking before him , and saying : God save king Adonias :
DRA	1%20Kings	1	26	But me thy servant , and Sadoc the priest , and Banaias the son of Joiada , and Solomon thy servant he hath not invited .
DRA	1%20Kings	1	27	Is this word come out from my lord the king , and hast thou not told me thy servant who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him ?
DRA	1%20Kings	1	28	And king David answered and said : Call to me Bethsabee . And when she was come in to the king , and stood before him ,
DRA	1%20Kings	1	29	The king swore and said : As the Lord liveth , who hath delivered my soul out of all distress ,
DRA	1%20Kings	1	30	Even as I swore to thee by the Lord the God of Israel , saying : Solomon thy son shall reign after me , and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead , so will I do this day .
DRA	1%20Kings	1	31	And Bethsabee bowing with her face to the earth worshipped the king , saying : May my lord David live for ever .
DRA	1%20Kings	1	32	King David also said : Call me Sadoc the priest , and Nathan the prophet , and Banaias the son of Joiada . And when they were come in before the king ,
DRA	1%20Kings	1	33	He said to them : Take with you the servants of your lord , and set my son Solomon upon my mule : and bring him to Gihon .
DRA	1%20Kings	1	34	And let Sadoc the priest , and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel : and you shall sound the trumpet , and shall say : God save king Solomon .
DRA	1%20Kings	1	35	And you shall come up after him , and he shall come , and shall sit upon my throne , and he shall reign in my stead : and I will appoint him to be ruler over Israel , and over Juda .
DRA	1%20Kings	1	36	And Banaias the son of Joiada answered the king , saying : Amen : so say the Lord the God of my lord the king .
DRA	1%20Kings	1	37	As the Lord hath been with my lord the king , so be he with Solomon , and make his throne higher than the throne of my lord king David .
DRA	1%20Kings	1	38	So Sadoc the priest , and Nathan the prophet went down , and Banaias the son of Joiada , and the Cerethi , and Phelethi : and they set Solomon upon the mule of king David , and brought him to Gihon .
DRA	1%20Kings	1	39	And Sadoc the priest took a horn of oil out of the tabernacle , and anointed Solomon : and they sounded the trumpet , and all the people said : God save king Solomon .
DRA	1%20Kings	1	40	And all the multitude went up after him , and the people played with pipes , and rejoiced with a great joy , and the earth rang with the noise of their cry .
DRA	1%20Kings	1	41	And Adonias , and all that were invited by him , heard it , and now the feast was at an end : Joab also hearing the sound of the trumpet , said : What meaneth this noise of the city in an uproar ?
DRA	1%20Kings	1	42	While he yet spoke , Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came : and Adonias said to him : Come in , because thou art a valiant man , and bringest good news .
DRA	1%20Kings	1	43	And Jonathan answered Adonias : Not so : for our lord king David hath appointed Solomon king .
DRA	1%20Kings	1	44	And hath sent with him Sadoc the priest , and Nathan the prophet , and Banaias the son of Joiada , and the Cerethi , and Phelethi , and they have set him upon the king 's mule .
DRA	1%20Kings	1	45	And Sadoc the priest , and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon : and they are gone up from thence rejoicing , so that the city rang again : this is the noise that you have heard .
DRA	1%20Kings	1	46	Moreover Solomon sitteth upon the throne of the kingdom ,
DRA	1%20Kings	1	47	And the king 's servants going in have blessed our lord king David , saying : May God make the name of Solomon greater than thy name , and make his throne greater than thy throne . And the king adored in his bed :
DRA	1%20Kings	1	48	And he said : Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel , who hath given this day one to sit on my throne , my eyes seeing it .
DRA	1%20Kings	1	49	Then all the guests of Adonias were afraid , and they all arose and every man went his way .
DRA	1%20Kings	1	50	And Adonias fearing Solomon , arose , and went , and took hold on the horn of the altar .
DRA	1%20Kings	1	51	And they told Solomon , saying : Behold Adonias , fearing king Solomon , hath taken hold of the horn of the altar , saying : Let king Solomon swear to me this day , that he will not kill his servant with the sword .
DRA	1%20Kings	1	52	And Solomon said : If he be a good man , there shall not so much as one hair of his head fall to the ground : but if evil be found in him , he shall die .
DRA	1%20Kings	1	53	Then king Solomon sent , and brought him out from the altar : and going in he worshipped king Solomon : and Solomon said to him : Go to thy house . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )

DRA	1%20Kings	2	5	Thou knowest also what Joab the son of Sarvia hath done to me , what he did to the two captains of the army of Israel , to Abner the son of Ner , and to Amasa the son of Jether : whom he slew , and shed the blood of war in peace , and put the blood of war on his girdle that was about his loins , and in his shoes that were on his feet .

DRA	1%20Kings	2	7	But shew kindness to the sons of Berzellai the Galaadite , and let them eat at thy table : for they met me when I fled from the face of Absalom thy brother .
DRA	1%20Kings	2	8	Thou hast also with thee Semei the son of Gera the son of Jemini of Bahurim , who cursed me with a grievous curse , when I went to the camp : but because he came down to meet me when I passed over the Jordan , and I swore to him by the Lord , saying : I will not kill thee with a sword :
DRA	1%20Kings	2	9	Do not thou hold him guiltless . But thou art a wise man , and knowest what to do with him , and thou shalt bring down his grey hairs with blood to hell .
DRA	1%20Kings	2	10	So David slept with his fathers , and was buried in the city of David .
DRA	1%20Kings	2	11	And the days that David reigned in Israel , were forty years : in Hebron he reigned seven years , in Jerusalem thirty-three .
DRA	1%20Kings	2	12	And Solomon sat upon the throne of his father David , and his kingdom was strengthened exceedingly .
DRA	1%20Kings	2	13	And Adonias the son of Haggith came to Bethsabee the mother of Solomon . And she said to him : Is thy coming peaceable ? he answered : Peaceable .
DRA	1%20Kings	2	14	And he added : I have a word to speak with thee . She said to him : Speak . And he said :
DRA	1%20Kings	2	15	Thou knowest that the kingdom was nine , and all Israel had preferred me to be their king : but the kingdom is transferred , and is become my brother 's : for it was appointed him by the Lord .
DRA	1%20Kings	2	16	Now therefore I ask one petition of thee : turn not away my face . And she said to him : Say on .
DRA	1%20Kings	2	17	And he said : I pray thee speak to king Solomon ( for he can not deny thee any thing ) to give me Abisag the Sunamitess to wife .

DRA	1%20Kings	2	23	Then king Solomon swore by the Lord , saying : So and so may God do to me , and add more , if Adonias hath not spoken this word against his own life .
DRA	1%20Kings	2	24	And now as the Lord liveth , who hath established me , and placed me upon the throne of David my father , and who hath made me a house , as he promised , Adonias shall be put to death this day .
DRA	1%20Kings	2	25	And king Solomon sent by the hand of Banaias the son of Joiada , who slew him , and he died .
DRA	1%20Kings	2	26	And the king said also to Abiathar the priest : Go to Anathoth to thy lands , for indeed thou art worthy of death : but I will not at this time put thee to death , because thou didst carry the ark of the Lord God before David my father , and hast endured trouble in all the troubles my father endured .
DRA	1%20Kings	2	27	So Solomon cast out Abiathar , from being the priest of the Lord , that the word of the Lord might be fulfilled , which he spoke concerning the house of Deli in Silo .
DRA	1%20Kings	2	28	And the news came to Joab , because Joab had turned after Adonias , and had not turned after Solomon : and Joab fled into the tabernacle of the Lord and laid hold on the horn of the altar .
DRA	1%20Kings	2	29	And it was told king Solomon , that Joab was fled into the tabernacle of the Lord , and was by the altar : and Solomon sent Banaias the son of Joiada , saying : Go , kill him .
DRA	1%20Kings	2	30	And Banaias came to the tabernacle of the Lord , and said to him : Thus saith the king : Come forth . And he said : I will not come forth , but here I will die . Banaias brought word back to the king , saying : Thus saith Joab , and thus he answered me .
DRA	1%20Kings	2	31	And the king said to him : Do as he hath said : and kill him , and bury him , and thou shalt remove the innocent blood which hath been shed by Joab , from me , and from the house of my father .
DRA	1%20Kings	2	32	And the Lord shall return his blood upon his own head , because he murdered two men , just and better than himself : and slew them with the sword , my father David not knowing it , Abner the son of Ner , general of the army of Israel , and Amasa the son of Jether , general of the army of Juda .
DRA	1%20Kings	2	33	And their blood shall return the head of Joab , and upon the head of his seed for ever . But to David and his seed and his house , and to his throne be peace for ever from the Lord .
DRA	1%20Kings	2	34	So Banaias the son of Joiada went up , and setting upon him slew him , and he was buried in his house in the desert .
DRA	1%20Kings	2	35	And the king appointed Banaias the son of Joiada in his room over the army , and Sadoc the priest he put in the place of Abiathar .
DRA	1%20Kings	2	36	The king also sent , and called for Semei , and said to him : Build thee a house in Jerusalem , and dwell there : and go not out from thence any whither .
DRA	1%20Kings	2	37	For on what day soever thou shalt go out , and shalt pass over the brook Cedron , know that thou shalt be put to death : thy blood shall be upon thy own head :
DRA	1%20Kings	2	38	And Semei said to the king : The saying is good : as my lord the king hath said , so will thy servant do . And Semei dwelt in Jerusalem , many days .
DRA	1%20Kings	2	39	And it came to pass after three years , that the servants of Semei ran away to Achis the son of Maacha the king of Geth : and it was told Semei that his servants were gone to Geth .
DRA	1%20Kings	2	40	And Semei arose , and saddled his ass , and went to Achis to Geth to seek his servants , and he brought them out of Geth .
DRA	1%20Kings	2	41	And it was told Solomon that Semei had gone from Jerusalem to Geth , and was come back .
DRA	1%20Kings	2	42	And sending he called for him , and said to him : Did I not protest to thee by the Lord , and tell thee before : On what day soever thou shalt go out and walk abroad any whither , know that thou shalt die ? And thou answeredst me : The word that I have heard is good .
DRA	1%20Kings	2	43	Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the Lord , and the commandment that I laid upon thee ?
DRA	1%20Kings	2	44	And the king said to Semei : Thou knowest all the evil , of which thy heart is conscious , which thou didst to David my father : the Lord hath returned thy wickedness upon thy own head :
DRA	1%20Kings	2	45	And king Solomon shall be blessed , and the throne of David shall be established before the Lord for ever .
DRA	1%20Kings	2	46	So the king commanded Banaias the son of Joiada : and he went out and struck him , and he died . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )

DRA	1%20Kings	3	3	And Solomon loved the Lord , walking in the precepts of David his father , only he sacrificed in the high places : and burnt incense .
DRA	1%20Kings	3	1899	American Edition
DRA	1%20Kings	3	2	But yet the people sacrificed in the high places : far there was no temple built to the name of the Lord until that day .
DRA	1%20Kings	3	4	He went therefore to Gabaon , to sacrifice there : for that was the great high place : a thousand victims for holocausts did Solomon offer upon that altar in Gabaon .
DRA	1%20Kings	3	5	And the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream by night , saying : Ask what thou wilt that I should give thee .
DRA	1%20Kings	3	6	And Solomon said : Thou hast shewn great mercy to thy servant David my father , even at , he walked before thee in truth , and justice , and an upright heart with thee : and thou hast kept thy great mercy for him , and hast given him a son to sit on his throne , as it is this day .
DRA	1%20Kings	3	7	And now , O Lord God , thou hast made thy servant king instead of David my father : and I am but a child , and know not how to go out and come in .
DRA	1%20Kings	3	8	And thy servant is in the midst of the people which thou hast chosen , an immense people , which can not be numbered nor counted for multitude .
DRA	1%20Kings	3	9	Give therefore to thy servant an understanding heart , to judge thy people , and discern between good and evil . For who shall be able to judge this people , thy people which is so numerous ?
DRA	1%20Kings	3	10	And the word was pleasing to the Lord that Solomon had asked such a thing .
DRA	1%20Kings	3	11	And the Lord said to Solomon : Because thou hast asked this thing , and hast not asked for thyself long life or riches , nor the lives of thy enemies , but hast asked for thyself wisdom to discern judgment ,
DRA	1%20Kings	3	12	Behold I have done for thee according to thy words , and have given thee a wise and understanding heart , insomuch that there hath been no one like thee before thee , nor shall arise after thee .
DRA	1%20Kings	3	13	Yea and the things also which thou didst not ask , I have given thee : to wit riches and glory , as that no one hath been like thee among the kings in all days heretofore .
DRA	1%20Kings	3	14	And if thou wilt walk in my ways , and keep my precepts , and my commandments , as thy father walked , I will lengthen thy days .
DRA	1%20Kings	3	15	And Solomon awaked , and perceived that it was a dream : and when he was come to Jerusalem , he stood before the ark of the covenant of the Lord , and offered holocausts , and sacrificed victims of peace offerings , and made a great feast for all his servants .
DRA	1%20Kings	3	16	Then there came two women that were harlots , to the king , and stood before him :
DRA	1%20Kings	3	17	And one of them said : I beseech thee , my lord , I and this woman dwelt in one house , and I was delivered of a child with her in the chamber .
DRA	1%20Kings	3	18	And the third day , after that I was delivered , she also was delivered , and we were together , and no other person with us in the house , only we two .
DRA	1%20Kings	3	19	And this woman 's child died in the night : for in her sleep she overlaid him .
DRA	1%20Kings	3	20	And rising in the dead time of the night , she took my child from my side , while I thy handmaid was asleep , and laid it in her bosom : and laid her dead child in my bosom .
DRA	1%20Kings	3	21	And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck , behold it was dead : but considering him more diligently when it was clear day , I found that it was not mine which I bore .
DRA	1%20Kings	3	22	And the other woman answered : It is not so as thou sayest , but thy child is dead , and mine is alive . On the contrary she said : Thou liest : for my child liveth , and thy child is dead . And in this manner they strove before the king .
DRA	1%20Kings	3	23	Then said the king : The one saith , My child is alive , and thy child is dead . And the other answereth : Nay , but thy child is dead , and mine liveth .
DRA	1%20Kings	3	24	The king therefore said : Bring me a sword . And when they had brought a sword before the king ,
DRA	1%20Kings	3	25	Divide , said he , the living child in two , and give half to the one , and half to the other .
DRA	1%20Kings	3	26	But the woman whose child was alive , said to the king , ( for her bowels were moved upon her child , ) I beseech thee , my lord , give her the child alive , and do not kill it . But the other said : Let it be neither mine nor thine , but divide it .
DRA	1%20Kings	3	27	The king answered , and said : Give the living child to this woman , and let it not be killed , for she is the mother thereof .

DRA	1%20Kings	5	1899	American Edition
DRA	1%20Kings	5	2	And Solomon sent to Hiram , saying :
DRA	1%20Kings	5	3	Thou knowest the will of David my father , and that he could not build a house to the name of the Lord his God , because of the wars that were round about him , until the Lord put them under the soles of his feet .

DRA	1%20Kings	8	63	And Solomon slew victims of peace offerings , which he sacrificed to the Lord , two and twenty thousand oxen , and hundred and twenty thousand sheep : so the king , and the children of Israel dedicated the temple of the Lord .
DRA	1%20Kings	8	64	In that day the king sanctified the middle of the court that was before the house of the Lord : for there he offered the holocaust , and sacrifice , and fat of the peace offerings : because the brazen altar that was before the Lord , was too little to receive the holocaust , and sacrifice , and fat of the peace offerings .

DRA	1%20Kings	11	14	And the Lord raised up an adversary to Solomon , Adad the Edomite of the king 's seed , in Edom .
DRA	1%20Kings	11	15	For when David was in Edom , and Joab the general of the army was gone up to bury them that were slain , and had killed every male in Edom ,
DRA	1%20Kings	11	16	( For Joab remained there six months with all Israel , till he had slain every male in Edom , )
DRA	1%20Kings	11	17	Then Adad fled , he and certain Edomites , of his father 's servants with him , to go into Egypt : and Adad was then a little boy .
DRA	1%20Kings	11	18	And they arose out of Madian , and came into Pharan , and they took men with them from Pharan , and went into Egypt to Pharao the king of Egypt : who gave him a house , and appointed him victuals , and assigned him land .
DRA	1%20Kings	11	19	And Adad found great favour before Pharao , insomuch that he gave him to wife , the own sister of his wife Taphnes the queen .
DRA	1%20Kings	11	20	And the sister of Taphnes bore him his son Genubath , and Taphnes brought him up in the house of Pharao : and Genubath dwelt with Pharao among his children .
DRA	1%20Kings	11	21	And when Adad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers , and that Joab the general of the army was dead , he said to Pharao : Let me depart , that I may go to my own country .
DRA	1%20Kings	11	22	And Pharao said to him : Why , what is wanting to thee with me , that thou seekest to go to thy own country ? But he answered : Nothing : yet I beseech thee to let me go .
DRA	1%20Kings	11	23	God also raised up against him an adversary , Razon the son of Eliada , who had fled from his master Adarezer the king of Soba :
DRA	1%20Kings	11	24	And he gathered men against him , and he became a captain of robbers , when David slew them of Soba : and they went to Damascus , and dwelt there , and they made him king in Damascus .
DRA	1%20Kings	11	25	And he was an adversary to Israel , all the days of Solomon : and this is the evil of Adad , and his hatred against Israel , and he reigned in Syria .
DRA	1%20Kings	11	26	Jeroboam also the son of Nabat an Ephrathite of Sareda , a servant of Solomon , whose mother was named Sarua , a widow woman , lifted up his hand against the king .
DRA	1%20Kings	11	27	And this is the cause of his rebellion against him , for Solomon built Mello , and filled up the breach of the city of David his father .
DRA	1%20Kings	11	28	And Jeroboam was a valiant and mighty man : and Solomon seeing him a young man ingenious and industrious , made him chief over the tributes of all the house of Joseph .
DRA	1%20Kings	11	29	So it came to paste at that time , that Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem , and the prophet Ahias the Silonite , clad with a new garment , found him in the way : and they two were alone in the held .
DRA	1%20Kings	11	30	And Ahias taking his new garment , wherewith he was clad , divided it into twelve parts :
DRA	1%20Kings	11	31	And he said to Jeroboam : Take to thee ten pieces : for thus saith the Lord the God of Israel : Behold I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon , and will give thee ten tribes .
DRA	1%20Kings	11	32	But one tribe shall remain to him for the sake of my servant David , and Jerusalem the city , which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel :
DRA	1%20Kings	11	33	Because he hath forsaken me , and hath adored Astarthe the goddess of the Sidonians , and Chamos the god of Moab , and Moloch the god of the children of Ammon : and hath not walked in my ways , to do justice before me , and to keep my precepts , and judgments as did David his father .
DRA	1%20Kings	11	34	Yet I will not take away all the kingdom out of his hand , but I will make him prince all the days of his life , for David my servant 's sake , whom I chose , who kept my commandments and my precepts .
DRA	1%20Kings	11	35	But I will take away the kingdom out of his son 's hand and will give thee ten tribes :
DRA	1%20Kings	11	36	And to his son I will give one tribe , that there may remain a lamp for my servant David before me always in Jerusalem the city which I have chosen , that my name might be there .
DRA	1%20Kings	11	37	And I will take thee , and thou shalt reign over all that thy soul desireth , and thou shalt be king over Israel .
DRA	1%20Kings	11	38	If then thou wilt hearken to all that I shall command thee , and wilt walk in my ways , and do what is right before me , keeping my commandments and my precepts , as David my servant did : I will be with thee , and will build thee up a faithful house , as I built a house for David , and I will deliver Israel to thee :

DRA	1%20Kings	12	11	And now my father put a , heavy yoke upon you , but I will add to your yoke : my father beat you with whips , but I will beat you with scorpions .

DRA	1%20Kings	12	15	And the king condescended not to the people : for the Lord was turned away from him , to make good his word , which he had spoken in the hand of Ahias the Silonite , to Jeroboam the son of Nabat .
DRA	1%20Kings	12	16	Then the people seeing that the king would not hearken to them , answered him , saying : What portion have we in David ? or what inheritance in the son of Isai ? Go home to thy dwellings , O Israel , now David look to thy own house . So Israel departed to their dwellings .

DRA	1%20Kings	13	3	And he gave a sign the same day , saying : This shall be the sign , that the Lord hath spoken : Behold the altar shall be rent , and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out .
DRA	1%20Kings	13	4	And when the king had heard the word of the man of God , which he had cried out against the altar in Bethel , he stretched forth his hand from the altar , saying : Lay hold on him . And his hand which he stretched forth against him withered : and he was not able to draw it back again to him .
DRA	1%20Kings	13	5	The altar also was rent , and the ashes were poured out from the altar , according to the sign which the man of God had given before in the word of the Lord .
DRA	1%20Kings	13	6	And the king said to the man of God : Entreat the face of the Lord thy God , and pray for me , that my hand may be restored to me . And the man of God besought the face of the Lord , and the king 's hand was restored to him , and it became as it was before .
DRA	1%20Kings	13	7	And the king said to the man of God : Come home with me to dine , and I will make thee presents .

DRA	1%20Kings	13	16	But he said : I must not return , nor go with thee , neither will I eat bread , nor drink water in this place :

DRA	1%20Kings	13	18	He said to him : I also am a prophet like unto thee : and an angel spoke to me in the word of the Lord , saying : Bring him back with thee into thy house , that he may eat bread , and drink water . He deceived him ,

DRA	1%20Kings	13	26	And when that prophet , who had brought him back out of the way , heard of it , he said : It is the man of God , that was disobedient to the mouth of the Lord , and the Lord hath delivered him to the lion , and he hath torn him , and killed him according to the word of the Lord , which he spoke to him .
DRA	1%20Kings	13	27	And he said to his sons : Saddle me an ass . And when they had saddled it ,

DRA	1%20Kings	13	31	And when they had mourned over him , he said to his sons : When I am dead , bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of God is buried : lay my bones beside his bones .

DRA	1%20Kings	20	15	So he mustered the servants of the princes of the provinces , and he found the number of two hundred and thirty-two : and he mustered after them the people , all the children of Israel , seven thousand :
DRA	1%20Kings	20	16	And they went out at noon . But Benadad was drinking himself drunk in his pavilion , and the two and thirty kings with him , who were come to help him .
DRA	1%20Kings	20	17	And the servants of the princes of the provinces went out first . And Benadad sent . And they told him , saying : There are men come out of Samaria .
DRA	1%20Kings	20	18	And he said : Whether they come for peace , take them alive : or whether they come to fight , take them alive .
DRA	1%20Kings	20	19	So the servants of the princes of the provinces went out , and the rest of the army followed :
DRA	1%20Kings	20	21	But the king of Israel going out overthrew the horses and chariots , and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter .
DRA	1%20Kings	20	22	( And a prophet coming to the king of Israel , said to him : Go , and strengthen thyself , and know , and see what thou dost : for the next year the king of Syria will come up against thee . )
DRA	1%20Kings	20	23	But the servants of the king of Syria said to him : Their gods are gods of the hills , therefore they have overcome us : but it is better that we should fight against them in the plains , and we shall overcome them .
DRA	1%20Kings	20	24	Do thou therefore this thing : Remove all the kings from thy army , and put captains in their stead :
DRA	1%20Kings	20	25	And make up the number of soldiers that have been slain of thine , and horses according to the former horses , and chariots according to the chariots which thou hadst before : and we will fight against them in the plains , and thou shalt see that we shall overcome them . He believed their counsel and did so .
DRA	1%20Kings	20	26	Wherefore at the return of the year , Benadad mustered the Syrians , ancient up to Aphec , to fight against Israel .
DRA	1%20Kings	20	27	And the children of Israel were mustered , and taking victuals went out on the other side , and camped over against them , like two little flocks of goats : but the Syrians filled the land .
DRA	1%20Kings	20	28	( And a man of God coming , said to the king of Israel : Thus saith the Lord : Because the Syrians have said : The Lord is God of the hills , but is not God of the valleys : I will deliver all this great multitude into thy hand , and you shall know that I am the Lord . )
DRA	1%20Kings	20	29	And both sides set their armies in array one against the other seven days , and on the seventh day the battle was fought : and the children of Israel slew of the Syrians a hundred thousand footmen in one day .
DRA	1%20Kings	20	30	And they that remained fled to Aphec , into the city : and the wall fell upon seven and twenty thousand men , that were left . And Benadad fleeing went into the city , into a chamber that was within a chamber .
DRA	1%20Kings	20	31	And his servants said to him : Behold , we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful : so let us put sackcloth on our loins , and ropes on our heads , and go out to the king of Israel : perhaps he will save our lives .
DRA	1%20Kings	20	32	So they girded sackcloth on their loins , and put ropes on their heads , and came to the king of Israel , and said to him : Thy servant Benadad saith : I beseech thee let me have my life . And he said : If he be yet alive he is my brother .
DRA	1%20Kings	20	33	The men took this for a sign : and in haste caught the word out of his mouth , and said : Thy brother Benadad . And he said to them : Go , and bring him to me . Then Benadad came out to him , and he lifted him up into his chariot .
DRA	1%20Kings	20	34	And he said to him : The cities which my father took from thy father , I will restore : and do thou make thee streets in Damascus , as my father made in Samaria , and having made a league I will depart from thee . So he made a league with him , and let him go .
DRA	1%20Kings	20	35	Then a certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his companion in the word of the Lord : Strike me . But he would not strike .
DRA	1%20Kings	20	36	Then he said to him : Because thou wouldst not hearken to the word of the Lord , behold then shalt depart from me , and a lion shall slay thee . And when he was gone a little from him , a lion found him , and slew him .
DRA	1%20Kings	20	37	Then he found another man , and said to him : Strike me . And he struck him , and wounded him .
DRA	1%20Kings	20	38	So the prophet went , and met the king in the way , and disguised himself by sprinkling dust on his face and his eyes .
DRA	1%20Kings	20	39	And as the king passed by , he cried to the king , and said : Thy servant went out to fight hand to hand : and when a certain man was run away , one brought him to me , and said : Keep this man : and if he shall slip away , thy life shall be for his life , or thou shalt pay a talent of silver .
DRA	1%20Kings	20	40	And whilst I in a hurry turned this way and that , on a sudden he was not to be seen . And the king of Israel said to him : This is thy judgment , which thyself hast decreed .
DRA	1%20Kings	20	41	But he forthwith wiped off the dust from his face , and the king of Israel knew him , that he was one of the prophets .
DRA	1%20Kings	20	42	And he said to him : Thus saith the Lord : Because thou hast let go out of thy hand a man worthy of death , thy life shall be for his life , and thy people for his people .

DRA	1%20Kings	21	21	Behold I will bring evil upon thee , and I will cut down thy posterity , and I will kill of Achab him that pisseth against the wall , and him that is shut up , and the last in Israel .
DRA	1%20Kings	21	1899	American Edition
DRA	1%20Kings	21	2	And Achab spoke to Naboth , saying : Give me thy vineyard , that I may make me a garden of herbs , because it is nigh , and adjoining to my house , and I will give thee for it a better vineyard : or if thou think it more convenient for thee , I will give thee the worth of it in money .
DRA	1%20Kings	21	3	Naboth answered him : The Lord be merciful to me , and not let me give thee the inheritance of my fathers .
DRA	1%20Kings	21	4	And Achab came into his house angry and fretting , because of the word that Naboth the Jezrahelite had spoken to him , saying : I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers . And casting himself upon his bed , he turned away his face to the wall , and would eat no bread .
DRA	1%20Kings	21	5	And Jezabel his wife went in to him , and said to him : What is the matter that thy soul is so grieved ? and why eatest thou no bread ?
DRA	1%20Kings	21	6	And he answered her : I spoke to Naboth the Jezrahelite , and said to him : Give me thy vineyard , and take money for it : or if it please thee , I will give thee a better vineyard for it . And he said : I will not give thee my vineyard .
DRA	1%20Kings	21	7	Then Jezabel his wife said to him : Thou art of great authority indeed , and governest well the kingdom of Israel . Arise , and eat bread , and be of good cheer , I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezrahelite .
DRA	1%20Kings	21	8	So she wrote letter 's in Achab 's name , and sealed them with his ring , and sent them to the ancients , and the chief men that were in his city , and that dwelt with Naboth .
DRA	1%20Kings	21	9	And this was the tenor of the letters : Proclaim a fast , and make Naboth sit among the chief of the people ,
DRA	1%20Kings	21	10	And suborn two men , sons of Belial against him , and let them bear false witness : that he hath blasphemed God and the king : and then carry him out , and stone him , and so let him die .
DRA	1%20Kings	21	11	And the men of his city , the ancients and nobles , that dwelt with him in the city , did as Jezabel had commanded them , and as it was written in the letters which she had sent to them :
DRA	1%20Kings	21	12	They proclaimed a fast , and made Naboth sit among the chief of the people .
DRA	1%20Kings	21	13	And bringing two men , sons of the devil , they made them sit against him : and they , like men of the devil , bore witness against him before the people , saying : Naboth hath blasphemed God and the king : wherefore they brought him forth without the city , and stoned him to death .
DRA	1%20Kings	21	14	And they sent to Jezabel , saying : Naboth is stoned , and is dead .
DRA	1%20Kings	21	15	And it came to pass when Jezabel heard that Naboth was stoned , and dead , that she said to Achab : Arise and take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezrahelite , who would not agree with thee , and give it thee for money : for Naboth is not alive , but dead .
DRA	1%20Kings	21	16	And when Achab heard this , to wit , that Naboth was dead , he arose , and went down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezrahelite , to take possession of it .
DRA	1%20Kings	21	17	And the word of the Lord came to Elias the Thesbite , saying :
DRA	1%20Kings	21	18	Arise , and go down to meet Achab king of Israel , who is in Samaria : behold he is going down to the vineyard of Naboth , to take possession of it :
DRA	1%20Kings	21	19	And thou shalt speak to him , saying : Thus saith the Lord : Thou hast slain , moreover also thou hast taken possession . And after these words thou shalt add : Thus saith the Lord : In this place , wherein the dogs have licked the blood of Naboth , they shall lick thy blood also .
DRA	1%20Kings	21	20	And Achab said to Elias : Hast thou found me thy enemy ? He said : I have found thee , because thou art sold , to do evil in the sight of the Lord .
DRA	1%20Kings	21	22	And I will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nabat , and like the house of Baasa the son of Ahias : for what thou hast done , to provoke me to anger , and for making Israel to sin .
DRA	1%20Kings	21	23	And of Jezabel also the Lord spoke , saying : The dogs shall eat Jezabel in the field of Jezrahel .
DRA	1%20Kings	21	24	If Achab die in the city , the dogs shall eat him : but if he die in the field , the birds of the air shall eat him .
DRA	1%20Kings	21	25	Now there was not such another as Achab , who was sold to do evil in the sight of the Lord : for his wife Jezabel set him on ,
DRA	1%20Kings	21	26	And he became abominable , insomuch that he followed the idols which the Amorrhites had made , whom the Lord destroyed before the face of the children of Israel .
DRA	1%20Kings	21	27	And when Achab had heard these words , he rent his garments , and put haircloth upon his flesh , and fasted and slept in sackcloth , and walked with his head cast down .
DRA	1%20Kings	21	28	And the word of the Lord came to Elias the Thesbite , saying :
DRA	1%20Kings	21	29	Hast thou not seen Achab humbled before me ? therefore , because he hath humbled himself for my sake , I will not bring the evil in his days , but in his son 's days will I bring the evil upon his house . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )

DRA	1%20Kings	22	5	And Josaphat said to the king of Israel : As I am , so art thou : my people and thy people are one : and my horsemen , thy horsemen . And Josaphat said to the king of Israel : Inquire , I beseech thee , this day , the word of the Lord .
DRA	1%20Kings	22	6	Then the king of Israel assembled the prophets , about four hundred men , and he said to them : Shall I go to Ramoth Galaad to fight , or shall I forbear ? They answered : Go up , and the Lord will deliver it into the hand of the king .
DRA	1%20Kings	22	7	And Josaphat said : Is there not here some prophet of the Lord , that we may inquire by him ?
DRA	1%20Kings	22	8	And the king of Israel said to Josaphat : There is one man left , by whom we may inquire of the Lord : Micheas the son of Jemla ; but I hate him , for he doth not prophesy good to me , but evil . And Josaphat said : Speak not so , O king .
DRA	1%20Kings	22	9	Then the king of Israel called an eunuch , and said to him : Make haste , and bring hither Micheas the son of Jemla .
DRA	1%20Kings	22	10	Then the king of Israel , and Josaphat king of Juda , sat each on his throne clothed with royal robes , in a court by the entrance of the gate of Samaria , and all the prophets prophesied before them .
DRA	1%20Kings	22	11	And Sedecias the son of Chanaana made himself horns of iron , and said : Thus saith the Lord : With these shalt thou push Syria , till thou destroy it .

DRA	1%20Kings	22	13	And the messenger , that went to call Micheas , spoke to him , saying : Behold the words of the prophets with one mouth declare good things to the king : let thy word therefore be like to theirs , and speak that which is good .
DRA	1%20Kings	22	14	But Micheas said to him : As the Lord liveth , whatsoever the Lord shall say to me , that will I speak .
DRA	1%20Kings	22	15	So he came to the king , and the king said to him : Micheas , shall we go to Ramoth Galaad to battle , or shall we forbear ? He answered him : Go up , and prosper , and the Lord shall deliver it into the king 's hands .
DRA	1%20Kings	22	16	But the king said to him : I adjure thee again and again , that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the Lord .
DRA	1%20Kings	22	17	And he said : I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills , like sheep that have no shepherd : and the Lord said : These have no master : let every man of them return to his house in peace .

DRA	1%20Kings	22	20	And the Lord said : Who shall deceive Achab king of Israel , that he may go up , and fall at Ramoth Galaad ? And one spoke words of this manner , and another otherwise .
DRA	1%20Kings	22	21	And there came forth a spirit , and stood before the Lord , and said : I will deceive him . And the Lord said to him : By what means ?
DRA	1%20Kings	22	23	Now therefore behold the Lord hath given a lying spirit in the mouth of all thy prophets that are here , and the Lord hath spoken evil against thee .
DRA	1%20Kings	22	24	And Sedecias the son of Chanaana came , and struck Micheas on the cheek , and said : Hath then the spirit of the Lord left me , and spoken to thee ?
DRA	1%20Kings	22	25	And Micheas said : Thou shalt see in the day when thou shalt go into a chamber within a chamber to hide thyself .
DRA	1%20Kings	22	26	And the king of Israel said : Take Micheas , and let him abide with Ammon the governor of the city , and with Joas the son of Amalech .
DRA	1%20Kings	22	27	And tell them : Thus saith the king : Put this man in prison , and feed him with bread of affliction , and water of distress , till I return in peace .

DRA	1%20Kings	22	30	And the king of Israel said to Josaphat : Take armour , and go into the battle , and put on thy own garments . But the king of Israel changed his dress , and went into the battle .
DRA	1%20Kings	22	31	And the king of Syria had commanded the two and thirty captains of the chariots , saying : You shall not fight against any , small or great , but against the king of Israel only .
DRA	1%20Kings	22	32	So when the captains of the chariots saw Josaphat , they suspected that he was the king of Israel , and making a violent assault they fought against him : and Josaphat cried out .
DRA	1%20Kings	22	33	And the captains of the chariots perceived that he was not the king of and they turned away from him .
DRA	1%20Kings	22	34	And a certain man bent his bow , shooting at a venture , and chanced to strike the king of Israel between the lungs and the stomach . But he said to the driver of his chariot : Turn thy hand , and carry me out of the army , for I am grievously wounded .
DRA	1%20Kings	22	35	And the battle was fought that day , and the king of Israel stood in his chariot against the Syrians , and he died in the evening : and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot .

DRA	2%20Kings	1	6	But they answered him : A man met us , and said to us : Go , and return to the king , that sent you , and you shall say to him : Thus saith the Lord : Is it because there was no God in Israel that thou sendest to Beelzebub the god of Accaron ? Therefore thou shalt not come down from the bed , on which thou art gone up , but then shalt surely die .
DRA	2%20Kings	1	7	And he said to them : What manner of man was he who met you , and spoke these words ?

DRA	2%20Kings	21	15	Because they have done evil before me , and have continued to provoke me , from the day that their fathers came out of Egypt , even unto this day .
DRA	2%20Kings	21	16	Moreover Manasses shed also very much innocent blood , till he filled Jerusalem up to the mouth : besides his sins , wherewith he made Juda to sin , to do evil before the Lord .

DRA	2%20Kings	22	4	Go to Helcias the high priest , that the money may be put together which is brought into the temple of the Lord , which the doorkeepers of the temple have gathered of the people .
DRA	2%20Kings	22	5	And let it be given to the workmen by the overseers of the house of the Lord : and lot them distribute it to those that work in the temple of the Lord , to repair the temple :
DRA	2%20Kings	22	6	That is , to carpenters and masons , and to such as mend breaches : and that timber may be bought , and stones out of the quarries , to repair the temple of the Lord .
DRA	2%20Kings	22	7	But let there be no reckoning made with them of the money which they receive , but let them have it in their power , and in their trust .
DRA	2%20Kings	22	8	And Helcias the high priest said to Saphan the scribe : I have found the book of the law in the house of the Lord : and Helcias gave the book to Saphan , and he read it .
DRA	2%20Kings	22	9	And Saphan the scribe came to the king , and brought him word again concerning that which he had commanded , and said : Thy servants have gathered together the money that was found in the house of the Lord , and they have given it to be distributed to the workmen , by the overseers of the works of the temple of the Lord .
DRA	2%20Kings	22	10	And Saphan the scribe told the king , saying : Helcias the priest hath delivered to me a book . And when Saphan had read it before the king ,
DRA	2%20Kings	22	11	And the king had heard the words of the law of the Lord , he rent his garments .
DRA	2%20Kings	22	12	And he commanded Helcias the priest , and Ahicam the son of Saphan , and Achobor the son of Micha , and Saphan the scribe , and Asaia the king 's servant , saying :
DRA	2%20Kings	22	13	Go and consult the Lord for me , and for the people , and for all Juda , concerning the words of this book which is found : for the great wrath of the Lord is kindled against us , because our fathers have not hearkened to the words of this book , to do all that is written for us .
DRA	2%20Kings	22	14	So Helcias the priest , and Ahicam , and Achobor , and Saphan , and Asaia went to Holda the prophetess the wife of Sellum the son of Thecua , the son of Araas keeper of the wardrobe , who dwelt in Jerusalem in the Second : and they spoke to her .
DRA	2%20Kings	22	15	And she said to them : Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel : Tell the man that sent you to me :
DRA	2%20Kings	22	16	Thus saith the Lord : Behold , I will bring evils upon this place , and upon the inhabitants thereof , all the words of the law which the king of Juda hath read :
DRA	2%20Kings	22	17	Because they have forsaken me , and have sacrificed to strange gods , provoking me by all the works of their hands : therefore my indignation shall be kindled against this place , and shall not be quenched .
DRA	2%20Kings	22	18	But to the king of Juda , who sent you to consult the Lord , thus shall you say : Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel : Forasmuch as thou hast heard the words of the book ,

DRA	1%20Chronicles	21	2	And David said to Joab , and to the rulers of the people : Go , and number Israel from Bersabee even to Dan , and bring me the number of them that I may know it .
DRA	1%20Chronicles	21	3	And Joab answered : The Lord make his people a hundred times more than they are : but , my lord the king , are they not all thy servants : why doth my lord seek this thing , which may be imputed as a sin to Israel ?
DRA	1%20Chronicles	21	4	But the king 's word rather prevailed : and Joab departed , and went through all Israel : and returned to Jerusalem .
DRA	1%20Chronicles	21	5	And he gave David the number of them , whom he had surveyed : and all the number of Israel was found to be eleven hundred thousand men that drew the sword : and of Juda four hundred and seventy thousand fighting men .
DRA	1%20Chronicles	21	6	But Levi and Benjamin he did not number : for Joab unwillingly executed the king 's orders .
DRA	1%20Chronicles	21	7	And God was displeased with this thing that was commanded : and he struck Israel .
DRA	1%20Chronicles	21	8	And David said to God : I have sinned exceedingly in doing this : I beseech thee take away the iniquity of thy servant , for I have done foolishly .
DRA	1%20Chronicles	21	9	And the Lord spoke to Gad the seer of David , saying :
DRA	1%20Chronicles	21	10	Go , and speak to David , and tell him : Thus saith the Lord : I give thee the choice of three things : choose one which thou wilt , and I will do it to thee .
DRA	1%20Chronicles	21	11	And when Gad was come to David , he said to him : Thus saith the Lord : choose which thou wilt :
DRA	1%20Chronicles	21	12	Either three years ' famine : or three months to flee from thy enemies , and not to be able to escape their sword : or three days to have the sword of the Lord , and pestilence in the land , and the angel of the Lord destroying in all the coasts of Israel : now therefore see what I shall answer him who sent me .
DRA	1%20Chronicles	21	13	And David said to Gad : I am on every side in a great strait : but it is better for me to fall into the hands of the Lord , for his mercies are many , than into the hands of men .
DRA	1%20Chronicles	21	14	So the Lord sent a pestilence upon Israel . And there fell of Israel seventy thousand men .
DRA	1%20Chronicles	21	15	And he sent an angel to Jerusalem , to strike it : and as he was striking it , the Lord beheld , and took pity for the greatness of the evil : and said to the angel that destroyed : It is enough , now stop thy hand . And the angel of the Lord stood by the thrashingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite .
DRA	1%20Chronicles	21	16	And David lifting up his eyes , saw the angel of the Lord standing between heaven and earth , with a drawn sword in his hand , turned against Jerusalem : and both he and the ancients clothed in haircloth , fell down flat on the ground .
DRA	1%20Chronicles	21	17	And David said to God : Am not I he that commanded the people to be numbered ? It is I that have sinned : it is I that have done the evil : but as for this flock , what hath it deserved ? O Lord my God , let thy hand be turned , I beseech thee , upon me , and upon my father 's house : and let not thy people be destroyed .
DRA	1%20Chronicles	21	18	And the angel of the Lord commanded Gad to tell David , to go up , and build an altar to the Lord God in the thrashingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite .
DRA	1%20Chronicles	21	19	And David went up , according to the word of Gad , which he spoke to him in the name of the Lord .
DRA	1%20Chronicles	21	20	Now when Ornan looked up , and saw the angel , he and his four sons hid themselves : for at that time he was thrashing wheat in the floor .
DRA	1%20Chronicles	21	22	And David said to him : Give me this place of thy thrashingfloor , that I may build therein an altar to the Lord : but thou shalt take of me as much money as it is worth , that the plague may cease from the people .
DRA	1%20Chronicles	21	23	And Ornan said to David : Take it , and let my lord the king do all that pleaseth him : and moreover the oxen also I give for a holocaust , and the drays for wood , and the wheat for the sacrifice : I will give it all willingly .
DRA	1%20Chronicles	21	24	And king David said to him : It shall not be so , but I will give thee money as much as it is worth : for I must not take it from thee , and so offer to the Lord holocausts free cost .
DRA	1%20Chronicles	21	25	So David gave to Ornan for the place , six hundred sicles of gold of just weight .
DRA	1%20Chronicles	21	26	And he built there an altar to the Lord : and he offered holocausts , and peace offerings , and he called upon the Lord , and he heard him by sending fire from heaven upon the altar of the holocaust .
DRA	1%20Chronicles	21	27	And the Lord commanded the angel : and he put up his sword again into the sheath .
DRA	1%20Chronicles	21	28	And David seeing that the Lord had heard him in the thrashingfloor of Oman the Jebusite , forthwith offered victims there .
DRA	1%20Chronicles	21	29	But the tabernacle of the Lord , which Moses made in the desert , and the altar of holocausts , was at that time in the high place of Gabaon .

DRA	1%20Chronicles	22	8	But the word of the Lord came to me , saying : Thou hast shed much blood , and fought many battles , so thou canst not build a house to my name , after shedding so much blood before me :

DRA	1%20Chronicles	22	10	He shall build a house to my name , and he shall be a son to me , and I will be a father to him : and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever .

DRA	2%20Chronicles	29	17	And they began to cleanse on the first day of the first month , and on the eighth day of the same month they came into the porch of the temple of the Lord , and they purified the temple in eight days , and on the sixteenth day of the same month they finished what they had begun .

DRA	2%20Chronicles	29	20	And king Ezechias rising early , assembled all the rulers of the city , and went up into the house of the Lord :
DRA	2%20Chronicles	29	21	And they offered together seven bullocks , and seven rams , and seven lambs , and seven he goats for sin , for the kingdom , for the sanctuary , for Juda : and he spoke to the priests the sons of Aaron , to offer them upon the altar of the Lord .
DRA	2%20Chronicles	29	22	Therefore they killed the bullocks , and the priests took the blood , and poured it upon the altar ; they killed also the rams , and their blood they poured also upon the altar , and they killed the lambs , and poured the blood upon the altar .
DRA	2%20Chronicles	29	23	And they brought the he goats for sin before the king , and the whole multitude , and they laid their hand upon them :
DRA	2%20Chronicles	29	24	And the priests immolated them , and sprinkled their blood before the altar for an expiation of all Israel : for the king had commanded that the holocaust and the sin offering should be made for all Israel .
DRA	2%20Chronicles	29	25	And he set the Levites in the house of the Lord with cymbals , and psalteries , and harps according to the regulation of David the king , and of Gad the seer , and of Nathan the prophet : for it was the commandment of the Lord by the hand of his prophets .
DRA	2%20Chronicles	29	26	And the Levites stood , with the instruments of David , and the priests with trumpets .
DRA	2%20Chronicles	29	27	And Ezechias commanded that they should offer holocausts upon the altar : and when the holocausts were offered , they began to sing praises to the Lord , and to sound with trumpets , and divers instruments which David the king of Israel had prepared .
DRA	2%20Chronicles	29	28	And all the multitude adored , and the singers , and the trumpeters , were in their office till the holocaust was finished .
DRA	2%20Chronicles	29	30	And Ezechias and the princes commanded the Levites to praise the Lord with the words of David , and Asaph the seer : and they praised him with great joy , and bowing the knee adored .

DRA	2%20Chronicles	29	33	And they consecrated to the Lord six hundred oxen , and three thousand sheep .
DRA	2%20Chronicles	29	34	But the priests were few , and were not enough to flay the holocausts : wherefore the Levites their brethren helped them , till the work was ended , and priests were sanctified , for the Levites are sanctified with an easier rite than the priests .
DRA	2%20Chronicles	29	35	So there were many holocausts , and the fat of peace offerings , and the libations of holocausts : and the service of the house of the Lord was completed .

DRA	2%20Chronicles	30	3	For they could not keep it in its time ; because there were not priests enough sanctified , and the people was not as yet gathered together to Jerusalem .
DRA	2%20Chronicles	30	4	And the thing pleased the king , and all the people .
DRA	2%20Chronicles	30	5	And they decreed to send messengers to all Israel from Bersabee even to Dan , that they should come , and keep the phase to the Lord the God of Israel in Jerusalem : for many had not kept it as it is prescribed by the law .
DRA	2%20Chronicles	30	6	And the posts went with letters by commandment of the king , and his princes , to all Israel and Juda , proclaiming according to the king 's orders : Ye children of Israel , turn again to the Lord the God of Abraham , and of Isaac , and of Israel : and he will return to the remnant of you that have escaped the hand of the king of the Assyrians .
DRA	2%20Chronicles	30	7	Be not like your fathers , and brethren , who departed from the Lord the God of their fathers , and he hath given them up to destruction , as you see .
DRA	2%20Chronicles	30	8	Harden not your necks , as your fathers did : yield yourselves to the Lord , and come to his sanctuary , which he hath sanctified for ever : serve the Lord the God of your fathers , and the wrath of his indignation shall be turned away from you .
DRA	2%20Chronicles	30	9	For if you turn again to the Lord : your brethren , and children shall find mercy before their masters , that have led them away captive , and they shall return into this land : for the Lord your God is merciful , and will not turn away his face from you , if you return to him .

DRA	2%20Chronicles	30	18	For a great part of the people from Ephraim , and Manasses , and Issachar , and Zabulon , that had not been sanctified , ate the phase otherwise than it is written : and Ezechias prayed for them , saying : The Lord who is good will shew mercy ,
DRA	2%20Chronicles	30	19	To all them , who with their whole heart , seek the Lord the God of their fathers : and will not impute it to them that they are not sanctified .

DRA	2%20Chronicles	30	21	And the children of Israel , that were found at Jerusalem , kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great joy , praising the Lord every day : the Levites also , and the priests , with instruments that agreed to their office .
DRA	2%20Chronicles	30	22	And Ezechias spoke to the heart of all the Levites , that had good understanding concerning the Lord : and they ate during the seven days of the solemnity , immolating victims of peace offerings , and praising the Lord the God of their fathers .

DRA	2%20Chronicles	31	31	And when these things had been duly celebrated , all Israel that were found in the cities of Juda , went out , and they broke the idols , and cut down the groves . demolished the high places , and destroyed the altars , not only out of all Juda and Benjamin , but out of Ephraim also and Manasses , till they had utterly destroyed them : then all the children of Israel returned to their possessions and cities .

DRA	2%20Chronicles	32	3	He took counsel with the princes , and the most valiant men , to stop up the heads of the springs , that were without the city : and as they were all of this mind ,
DRA	2%20Chronicles	32	4	He gathered together a very great multitude , and they stopped up all the springs , and the brook , that ran through the midst of the land , saying : Lest the kings of the Assyrians should come , and And abundance of water .
DRA	2%20Chronicles	32	5	He built up also with great diligence all the wall that had been broken down , and built towers upon it , and another wall without : and he repaired Mello in the city of David , and made all sorts of arms and shields :
DRA	2%20Chronicles	32	6	And he appointed captains of the soldiers of the army : and he called them all together in the street of the gate of the city , and spoke to their heart , saying :
DRA	2%20Chronicles	32	7	Behave like men , and take courage : be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of the Assyrians , nor for all the multitude that is with him : for there are many more with us than with him .
DRA	2%20Chronicles	32	8	For with him is an arm of flesh : with us the Lord our God , who is our helper , and fighteth for us . And the people were encouraged with these words of Ezechias king of Juda .
DRA	2%20Chronicles	32	9	After this , Sennacherib king of the Assyrians sent his servants to Jerusalem , ( for he with all his army was besieging Lachis , ) to Ezechias king of Juda , and to all the people that were in the city , saying :
DRA	2%20Chronicles	32	10	Thus saith Sennacherib king of the Assyrians : In whom do you trust , that you sit still besieged in Jerusalem ?
DRA	2%20Chronicles	32	11	Doth not Ezechias deceive you , to give you up to die by hunger and thirst , affirming that the Lord your God shall deliver you from the hand of the king of the Assyrians ?
DRA	2%20Chronicles	32	12	Is it not this same Ezechias , that hath destroyed his high places , and his altars , and commanded Juda and Jerusalem , saying : You shall worship before one altar , and upon it you shall burn incense ?
DRA	2%20Chronicles	32	13	Know you not what I and my fathers have done to all the people of the lands ? have the gods of any nations and lands been able to deliver their country out of my hand ?
DRA	2%20Chronicles	32	14	Who is there among all the gods of the nations , which my fathers have destroyed , that could deliver his people out of my hand , that your God should be able to deliver you out of this hand ?
DRA	2%20Chronicles	32	15	Therefore let not Ezechias deceive you , nor delude you with a vain persuasion , and do not believe him . For if no god of all the nations and kingdoms , could deliver his people out of my hand , and out of the hand of my fathers , consequently neither shall your God be able to deliver you out of my hand .
DRA	2%20Chronicles	32	16	And many other things did his servants speak against the Lord God , and against Ezechias his servant .
DRA	2%20Chronicles	32	17	He wrote also letters full of blasphemy against the Lord the God of Israel , and he spoke against him : As the gods of other nations could not deliver their people out of my hand , so neither can the God of Ezechias deliver his people out of this hand .

DRA	2%20Chronicles	32	23	Many also brought victims , and sacrifices to the Lord to Jerusalem , and presents to Ezechias king of Juda : and he was magnified thenceforth in the sight of all nations .
DRA	2%20Chronicles	32	24	In those days Ezechias was sick even to death , and he prayed to the Lord : and he heard him , and gave him a sign .
DRA	2%20Chronicles	32	25	But he did not render again according to the benefits which he had received , for his heart was lifted up : and wrath was enkindled against him , and against Juda and Jerusalem .
DRA	2%20Chronicles	32	26	And he humbled himself afterwards , because his heart had been lifted up , both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem : and therefore the wrath of the Lord came not upon them in the days of Ezechias .
DRA	2%20Chronicles	32	27	And Ezechias was rich , and very glorious , and he gathered himself great treasures of silver and of gold , and of precious stones , of spices , and of arms , of all kinds , and of vessels of great price .

DRA	2%20Chronicles	33	6	And he made his sons to pass through the fire in the valley of Benennom : he observed dreams , followed divinations , gave himself up to magic arts , had with him magicians , and enchanters : and he wrought many evils before the Lord , to provoke him to anger .
DRA	2%20Chronicles	33	7	He set also a graven , and a molten statue in the house of God , of which God had said to David , and to Solomon his son : In this house , and in Jerusalem , which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel , will I put my name for ever .
DRA	2%20Chronicles	33	8	And I will not make the foot of Israel to be removed out of the land which I have delivered to their fathers : yet so if they will take heed to do what I hare commanded them , and all the law , and the ceremonies , and judgments by the hand of Moses .

DRA	2%20Chronicles	33	10	And the Lord spoke to him , and to his people , and they would not hearken .
DRA	2%20Chronicles	33	11	Therefore he brought upon them the captains of the army of the king of the Assyrians : and they took Manasses , and carried him bound with chains and fetters to Babylon .

DRA	2%20Chronicles	34	25	Because they have forsaken me , and have sacrificed to strange gods , to provoke me to wrath with all the works of their hands , therefore my wrath shall fall upon this place , and shall not be quenched .
DRA	2%20Chronicles	34	26	But as to the king of Juda that sent you to beseech the Lord , thus shall you say to him : Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel : Because thou hast heard the words of this book ,

DRA	2%20Chronicles	34	30	And went up to the house of the Lord , and all the men of Juda , and the inhabitants of Jerusalem , the priests and the Levites , and all the people from the least to the greatest . And the king read in their hearing , in the house of the Lord , all the words of the book .

DRA	Nehemiah	13	2	Because they met not the children of Israel with bread and water : and they hired against them Balaam , to curse them , and our God turned the curse into blessing .
DRA	Nehemiah	13	3	And it came to pass , when they had heard the law , that they separated every stranger from Israel .
DRA	Nehemiah	13	4	And over this thing was Eliasib the priest , who was set over the treasury of the house of our God , and was near akin to Tobias .
DRA	Nehemiah	13	5	And he made him a great storeroom , where before him they laid up gifts , and frankincense , and vessels , and the tithes of the corn , of the wine , and of the oil , the portions of the Levites , and of the singing men , and of the porters , and the firstfruits of the priests .
DRA	Nehemiah	13	6	But in all this time I was not in Jerusalem , because in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon , I went to the king , and after certain days I asked the king :
DRA	Nehemiah	13	7	And I came to Jerusalem , and I understood the evil that Eliasib had done for Tobias , to make him a storehouse in the courts of the house of God .
DRA	Nehemiah	13	8	And it seemed to me exceeding evil . And I cast forth the vessels of the house of Tobias out of the storehouse .
DRA	Nehemiah	13	9	And I commanded and they cleansed the storehouses : and I brought thither again the vessels of the house of God , the sacrifice , and the frankincense .
DRA	Nehemiah	13	10	And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them : and that the Levites , and the singing men , and they that ministered were fled away every man to his own country :
DRA	Nehemiah	13	11	And I pleaded the matter against the magistrates , and said : Why have we forsaken the house of God ? And I gathered them together , and I made them to stand in their places .
DRA	Nehemiah	13	12	And all Juda brought the tithe of the corn , and the wine , and the oil into the storehouses .
DRA	Nehemiah	13	14	Remember me , O my God , for this thing , and wipe not out my kindnesses , which I have done relating to the house of my God and his ceremonies .
DRA	Nehemiah	13	15	In those days I saw in Juda some treading the presses on the sabbath , and carrying sheaves , and lading asses with wine , and grapes , and figs , and all manner of burthens , and bringing them into Jerusalem on the sabbath day . And I charged them that they should sell on a day on which it was lawful to sell .
DRA	Nehemiah	13	16	Some Tyrians also dwelt there , who brought fish , and all manner of wares : and they sold them on the sabbaths to the children of Juda in Jerusalem .
DRA	Nehemiah	13	17	And I rebuked the chief men of Juda , and said to them : What is this evil thing that you are doing , profaning the sabbath day ?
DRA	Nehemiah	13	18	Did not our fathers do these things , and our God brought all this evil upon us , and upon this city ? And you bring more wrath upon Israel by violating the sabbath .
DRA	Nehemiah	13	19	And it came to pass , that when the gates of Jerusalem were at rest on the sabbath day , I spoke : and they shut the gates , and I commanded that they should not open them till after the sabbath : and I set some of my servants at the gates , that none should bring in burthens on the sabbath day .
DRA	Nehemiah	13	20	So the merchants , and they that sold all kinds of wares , stayed without Jerusalem once or twice .
DRA	Nehemiah	13	21	And I charged them , and I said to them : Why stay you before the wall ? if you do so another time , I will lay hands on you . And from that time they came no more on the sabbath .
DRA	Nehemiah	13	22	I spoke also to the Levites that they should be purified , and should come to keep the gates , and to sanctify the sabbath day : for this also remember me , O my God , and spare me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies .
DRA	Nehemiah	13	23	In those days also I saw Jews that married wives , women of Azotus , and of Ammon , and of Moab .
DRA	Nehemiah	13	24	And their children spoke half in the speech of Azotus , and could not speak the Jews ' language , but they spoke according to the language of this and that people .
DRA	Nehemiah	13	25	And I chid them , and laid my curse upon them . And I beat some of them , and shaved off their hair , and made them swear by God that they would not give their daughters to their sons , nor take their daughters for their sons , nor for themselves , saying :
DRA	Nehemiah	13	26	Did not Solomon king of Israel sin in this kind of thing ? and surely among many nations , there was not a king like him , and he was beloved of his God , and God made him king over all Israel : and yet women of other countries brought even him to sin .

DRA	Esther	1	1	In the days of Assuerus , who reigned from India to Ethiopia over a hundred and twenty-seven provinces :
DRA	Esther	1	1899	American Edition
DRA	Esther	1	2	When he sat on the throne of his kingdom , the city Susan was the capital of his kingdom .
DRA	Esther	1	3	Now in the third year of his reign he made a great feast for all the princes , and for his servants , for the most mighty of the Persians , and the nobles of the Medes , and the governors of the provinces in his sight ,
DRA	Esther	1	4	That he might shew the riches of the glory of his kingdom , and the greatness , and boasting of his power , for a long time , to wit , for a hundred and fourscore days .
DRA	Esther	1	5	And when the days of the feast were expired , he invited all the people that were found in Susan , from the greatest to the least : and commanded a feast to be made seven days in the court of the garden , and of the wood , which was planted by the care and the hand of the king .
DRA	Esther	1	6	And there were hung up on every side sky coloured , and green , and violet hangings , fastened with cords of silk , and of purple , which were put into rings of ivory , and were held up with marble pillars . The beds also were of gold and silver , placed in order upon a floor paved with porphyry and white marble : which was embellished with painting of wonderful variety .
DRA	Esther	1	7	And they that were invited , drank in golden cups , and the meats were brought in divers vessels one after another . Wine also in abundance and of the best was presented , as was worthy of a king 's magnificence .
DRA	Esther	1	8	Neither was there any one to compel them to drink that were not willing , but as the king had appointed , who set over every table one of his nobles , that every man might take what he would .
DRA	Esther	1	9	Also Vasthi the queen made a feast for the women in the palace , where king Assuerus was used to dwell .
DRA	Esther	1	10	Now on the seventh day , when the king was merry , and after very much drinking was well warmed with wine , he commanded Mauman , and Bazatha , and Harbona , and Bagatha , and Abgatha , and Zethar , and Charcas , the seven eunuchs that served in his presence ,
DRA	Esther	1	11	To bring in queen Vasthi before the king , with the crown set upon her head , to shew her beauty to all the people and the princes : for she was exceeding beautiful .
DRA	Esther	1	12	But she refused , and would not come at the king 's commandment , which he had signified to her by the eunuchs . Whereupon the king , being angry , and inflamed with a very great fury ,
DRA	Esther	1	13	Asked the wise men , who according to the custom of the kings , were always near his person , and all he did was by their counsel , who knew the laws , and judgments of their forefathers :
DRA	Esther	1	14	( Now the chief and nearest him were , Charsena , and Sethar , and Admatha , and Tharsis , and Mares , and Marsana , and Mamuchan , seven princes of the Persians , and of the Medes , who saw the face of the king , and were used to sit first after him : )
DRA	Esther	1	15	What sentence ought to pass upon Vasthi the queen , who had refused to obey the commandment of king Assuerus , which he had sent to her by the eunuchs ?
DRA	Esther	1	16	And Mamuchan answered , in the hearing of the king and the princes : Queen Vasthi hath not only injured the king , but also all the people and princes that are in all the provinces of king Assuerus .
DRA	Esther	1	17	For this deed of the queen will go abroad to all women , so that they will despise their husbands , and will say : King Assuerus commanded that queen Vasthi should come in to him , and she would not .
DRA	Esther	1	18	And by this example all the wives of the princes of the Persians and the Medes will slight the commandments of their husbands : wherefore the king 's indignation is just .
DRA	Esther	1	19	If it please thee , let an edict go out from thy presence , and let it be written according to the law of the Persians and of the Medes , which must not be altered , that Vasthi come in no more to the king , but another , that is better than her , be made queen in her place .
DRA	Esther	1	20	And let this be published through all the provinces of thy empire , ( which is very wide , ) and let all wives , as well of the greater as of the lesser , give honour to their husbands .
DRA	Esther	1	21	His counsel pleased the king , and the princes : and the king did according to the counsel of Mamuchan .
DRA	Esther	1	22	And he sent letters to all the provinces of his kingdom , as every nation could hear and read , in divers languages and characters , that the husbands should be rulers and masters in their houses : and that this should be published to every people .

DRA	Esther	2	2	And the king 's servants and his officers said : Let young women be sought for the king , virgins and beautiful ,
DRA	Esther	2	1899	American Edition
DRA	Esther	2	3	And let some persons be sent through all the provinces to look for beautiful maidens and virgins : and let them bring them to the city of Susan , and put them into the house of the women under the hand of Egeus the eunuch , who is the overseer and keeper of the king 's women : and let them receive women 's ornaments , and other things necessary for their use .
DRA	Esther	2	4	And whosoever among them all shall please the king 's eyes , let her be queen instead of Vasthi . The word pleased the king : and he commanded it should be done as they had suggested .
DRA	Esther	2	5	There was a man in the city of Susan , a Jew , named Mardochai , the son of Jair , the son of Semei , the son of Cis , of the race of Jemini ,
DRA	Esther	2	6	Who had been carried away from Jerusalem at the time that Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon carried away Jechonias king of Juda ,
DRA	Esther	2	7	And he had brought up his brother 's daughter Edissa , who by another name was called Esther : now she had lost both her parents : and was exceeding fair and beautiful . And her father and mother being dead , Mardochai adopted her for his daughter .
DRA	Esther	2	8	And when the king 's ordinance was noised abroad , and according to his commandment many beautiful virgins were brought to Susan , and were delivered to Egeus the eunuch : Esther also among the rest of the maidens was delivered to him to be kept in the number of the women .
DRA	Esther	2	9	And she pleased him , and found favour in his sight . And he commanded the eunuch to hasten the women 's ornaments , and to deliver to her her part , and seven of the most beautiful maidens of the king 's house , and to adorn and deck out both her and her waiting maids .
DRA	Esther	2	10	And she would not tell him her people nor her country . For Mardochai had charged her to say nothing at all of that :
DRA	Esther	2	11	And he walked every day before the court of the house , in which the chosen virgins were kept , having a care for Esther 's welfare , and desiring to know what would befall her .
DRA	Esther	2	12	Now when every virgin 's turn came to go in to the king , after all had been done for setting them off to advantage , it was the twelfth month : so that for six months they were anointed with oil of myrrh , and for other six months they used certain perfumes and sweet spices .
DRA	Esther	2	13	And when they were going in to the king , whatsoever they asked to adorn themselves they received : and being decked out , as it pleased them , they passed from the chamber of the women to the king 's chamber .
DRA	Esther	2	14	And she that went in at evening , came out in the morning , and from thence she was conducted to the second house , that was under the hand of Susagaz the eunuch , who had the charge over the king 's concubines : neither could she return any more to the king , unless the king desired it , and had ordered her by name to come .
DRA	Esther	2	15	And as the time came orderly about , the day was at hand , when Esther , the daughter of Abihail the brother of Mardochai , whom he had adopted for his daughter , was to go in to the king . But she sought not women 's ornaments , but whatsoever Egeus the eunuch the keeper of the virgins had a mind , he gave her to adorn her . For she was exceeding fair , and her incredible beauty made her appear agreeable and amiable in the eyes of all .
DRA	Esther	2	16	So she was brought to the chamber of king Assuerus the tenth month , which is called Tebeth , in the seventh year of his reign .
DRA	Esther	2	17	And the king loved her more than all the women , and she had favour and kindness before him above all the women , and he set the royal crown on her head , and made her queen instead of Vasthi .
DRA	Esther	2	18	And he commanded a magnificent feast to be prepared for all the princes , and for his servants , for the marriage and wedding of Esther . And he gave rest to all the provinces , and bestowed gifts according to princely magnificence .
DRA	Esther	2	19	And when the virgins were sought the second time , and gathered together , Mardochai stayed at the king 's gate ,
DRA	Esther	2	20	Neither had Esther as yet declared her country and people , according to his commandment . For whatsoever he commanded , Esther observed : and she did all things in the same manner as she was wont at that time when he brought her up a little one .
DRA	Esther	2	21	At that time , therefore , when Mardochai abode at the king 's gate , Bagathan and Thares , two of the king 's eunuchs , who were porters , and presided in the first entry of the palace , were angry : and they designed to rise up against the king , and to kill him .
DRA	Esther	2	22	And Mardochai had notice of it , and immediately he told it to queen Esther : and she to the king in Mardochai 's name , who had reported the thing unto her .
DRA	Esther	2	23	It was inquired into , and found out : and they were both hanged on a gibbet . And it was put in the histories , and recorded in the chronicles before the king . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Esther	3	3	And the king 's servants that were chief at the doors of the palace , said to him : Why dost thou alone not observe the king 's commandment ?
DRA	Esther	3	1899	American Edition
DRA	Esther	3	2	And all the king 's servants , that were at the doors of the palace , bent their knees , and worshipped Aman : for so the emperor had commanded them , only Mardochai did not bend his knee , nor worship him .
DRA	Esther	3	4	And when they were saying this often , and he would not hearken to them ; they told Aman , desirous to know whether he would continue in his resolution : for he had told them that he was a Jew .
DRA	Esther	3	5	Now when Aman had heard this , and had proved by experience that Mardochai did not bend his knee to him , nor worship him , he was exceeding angry .
DRA	Esther	3	6	And he counted it nothing to lay his hands upon Mardochai alone : for he had heard that he was of the nation of the Jews , and he chose rather to destroy all the nation of the Jews that were in the kingdom of Assuerus .
DRA	Esther	3	7	In the first month ( which is called Nisan ) in the twelfth year a of the reign of Assuerus , the lot was cast into an urn , which in Hebrew is called Phur , before Aman , on what day and what month the nation of the Jews should be destroyed : and there came out the twelfth month , which is called Adar .
DRA	Esther	3	8	And Aman said to king Assuerus : There is a people scattered through all the provinces of thy kingdom , and separated one from another , that use new laws and ceremonies , and moreover despise the king 's ordinances : and thou knowest very well that it is not expedient for thy kingdom that they should grow insolent by impunity .
DRA	Esther	3	9	If it please thee , decree that they may he destroyed , and I will pay ten thousand talents to thy treasurers .
DRA	Esther	3	10	And the king took the ring that he used , from his own hand , and gave it to Aman , the son of Amadathi of the race of Agag , the enemy of the Jews ,
DRA	Esther	3	11	And he said to him : As to the money which thou promisest , keep it for thyself : and as to the people , do with them as seemeth good to thee .
DRA	Esther	3	12	And the king 's scribes were called in the first month Nisan , on the thirteenth day of the same month : and they wrote , as Aman had commanded , to all the king 's lieutenants , and to the judges of the provinces , and of divers nations , as every nation could read , and hear according to their different languages , in the name of king Assuerus : and the letters , sealed with his ring ,
DRA	Esther	3	13	Were sent by the king 's messengers to all provinces , to kill and destroy all the Jews , both young and old , little children , and women , in one day , that is , on the thirteenth of the twelfth month , which is called Adar , and to make a spoil of their goods .
DRA	Esther	3	14	And the contents of the letters were to this effect , that all provinces might know and be ready against that day .
DRA	Esther	3	15	The couriers that were sent made haste to fulfill the king 's commandment . And immediately the edict was hung up in Susan , the king and Aman feasting together , and all the Jews that were in the city weeping . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Esther	4	4	Then Esther 's maids and her eunuchs went in , and told her . And when she heard it she was in a consternation : and she sent a garment , to clothe him , and to take away the sackcloth : but he would not receive it .
DRA	Esther	4	1899	American Edition
DRA	Esther	4	2	And he came lamenting in this manner even to the gate of the palace : for no one clothed with sackcloth might enter the king 's court .
DRA	Esther	4	3	And in all provinces , towns , and places , to which the king 's cruel edict was come , there was great mourning among the Jews , with fasting , wailing , and weeping , many using sackcloth and ashes for their bed .
DRA	Esther	4	5	And she called for Athach the eunuch , whom the king had appointed to attend upon her , and she commanded him to go to Mardochai , and learn of him why he did this .
DRA	Esther	4	6	And Athach going out went to Mardochai , who was standing in the street of the city , before the palace gate :
DRA	Esther	4	7	And Mardochai told him all that had happened , how Aman had promised to pay money into the king 's treasures , to have the Jews destroyed .
DRA	Esther	4	8	He gave him also a copy of the edict which was hanging up in Susan , that he should shew it to the queen , and admonish her to go in to the king , and to entreat him for her people .
DRA	Esther	4	9	And Athach went back and told Esther all that Mardochai had said .
DRA	Esther	4	10	She answered him , and bade him say to Mardochai :
DRA	Esther	4	11	All the king 's servants , and all the provinces that are under his dominion , know , that whosoever , whether man or woman , cometh into the king 's inner court , who is not called for , is immediately to be put to death without any delay : except the king shall hold out the golden sceptre to him , in token of clemency , that so he may live . How then can I go in to the king , who for these thirty days now have not been called unto him ?
DRA	Esther	4	12	And when Mardochai had heard this ,
DRA	Esther	4	13	He sent word to Esther again , saying : Think not that thou mayst save thy life only , because thou art in the king a house , more than all the Jews :
DRA	Esther	4	14	For if thou wilt now hold thy peace , the Jews shall be delivered by some other occasion : and thou , and thy father 's house shall perish . And who knoweth whether thou art not therefore come to the kingdom , that thou mightest be ready in such a time as this ?
DRA	Esther	4	15	And again Esther sent to Mardochai in these words :
DRA	Esther	4	16	Go , and gather together all the Jews whom thou shalt find in Susan , and pray ye for me . Neither eat nor drink for three days and three nights : and I with my handmaids will fast in like manner , and then I will go in to the king , against the law , not being called , and expose myself to death and to danger .
DRA	Esther	4	17	So Mardochai went , and did all that Esther had commanded him . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Esther	5	5	And the king said forthwith : Call ye Aman quickly , that he may obey Esther 's will . So the king and Aman came to the banquet which the queen had prepared for them .
DRA	Esther	5	1899	American Edition
DRA	Esther	5	2	And when he saw Esther the queen standing , she pleased his eyes , and he held out toward her the golden sceptre , which he held in his hand : and she drew near , and kissed the top of his sceptre .
DRA	Esther	5	3	And the king said to her : What wilt then , queen Esther ? what is thy request ? if thou shouldst even ask one half of the kingdom , it shall be given to thee .
DRA	Esther	5	4	But she answered : If it please the king . I beseech thee to come to me this day , and Aman with thee to the banquet which I have prepared .
DRA	Esther	5	6	And the king said to her , after he had drunk wine plentifully : What dost thou desire should be given thee ? and for what thing askest thou ? although thou shouldst ask the half of my kingdom , thou shalt have it .
DRA	Esther	5	7	And Esther answered : My petition and request is this :
DRA	Esther	5	8	If I have found favour in the king 's sight , and if it please the king to give me what I ask , and to fulfill my petition : let the king and Aman come to the banquet which I have prepared them , and to morrow I will open my mind to the king .
DRA	Esther	5	9	So Aman went out that day joyful and merry . And when he saw Mardochai sitting before the gate of the palace , and that he not only did not rise up to honour him , but did not so much as move from the place where he sat , he was exceedingly angry :
DRA	Esther	5	10	But dissembling his anger , and returning into his house , he called together to him his friends , and Zares his wife :
DRA	Esther	5	11	And he declared to them the greatness of his riches , and the multitude of his children , and with how great glory the king had advanced him above all his princes and servants .
DRA	Esther	5	12	And after this he said : Queen Esther also hath invited no other to the banquet with the king , but me : and with her I am also to dine to morrow with the king :
DRA	Esther	5	13	And whereas I have all these things , I think I have nothing , so long as I see Mardochai the Jew sitting before the king 's gate .
DRA	Esther	5	14	Then Zares his wife , and the rest of his friends answered him : Order a great beam to be prepared , fifty cubits high , and in the morning speak to the king , that Mardochai may be hanged upon it , and so thou shalt go full of joy with the king to the banquet . The counsel pleased him , and he commanded a high gibbet to be prepared . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Esther	6	6	And when he was come in , he said to him : What ought to be done to the man whom the king is desirous to honour ? But Aman thinking in his heart , and supposing that the king would honour no other but himself ,
DRA	Esther	6	1899	American Edition
DRA	Esther	6	2	They came to that place where it was written , how Mardochai had discovered the treason of Bagathan and Thares the eunuchs , who sought to kill king Assuerus .
DRA	Esther	6	3	And when the king heard this , he said : What honour and reward hath Mardochai received for this fidelity ? His servants and ministers said to him : He hath received no reward at all .
DRA	Esther	6	4	And the king said immediately : Who is in the court ? for Aman was coming in to the inner court of the king 's house , to speak to the king , that he might order Mardochai to be hanged upon the gibbet which was prepared for him .
DRA	Esther	6	5	The servants answered : Aman standeth in the court , and the king said : Let him come in .
DRA	Esther	6	7	Answered : The man whom the king desireth to honour ,
DRA	Esther	6	8	Ought to be clothed with the king 's apparel , and to be set upon the horse that the king rideth upon , and to have the royal crown upon his head ,
DRA	Esther	6	9	And let the first of the king 's princes and nobles hold his horse , and going through the street of the city , proclaim before him and say : Thus shall he be honoured , whom the king hath a mind to honour .
DRA	Esther	6	10	And the king said to him : Make haste and take the robe and the horse , and do as thou hast spoken to Mardochai the Jew , who sitteth before the gates of the palace . Beware thou pass over any of those things which thou hast spoken .
DRA	Esther	6	11	So Aman took the robe and the horse , and arraying Mardochai in the street of the city , and setting him on the horse , went before him , and proclaimed : This honour is he worthy of , whom the king hath a mind to honour .
DRA	Esther	6	12	But Mardochai returned to the palace gate : and Aman made haste to go to his house , mourning and having his head covered :
DRA	Esther	6	13	And he told Zares his wife , and his friends , all that had befallen him . And the wise men whom he had in counsel , and his wife answered him : If Mardochai be of the seed of the Jews , before whom thou hast begun to fall , thou canst not resist him , but thou shalt fall in his sight .
DRA	Esther	6	14	As they were yet speaking , the king 's eunuchs came , and compelled him to go quickly to the banquet which the queen had prepared . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Esther	7	7	But the king being angry rose up , and went from the place of the banquet into the garden set with trees . Aman also rose up to entreat Esther the queen for his life , for he understood that evil was prepared for him by the king .
DRA	Esther	7	1899	American Edition
DRA	Esther	7	2	And the king said to her again the second day , after he was warm with wine : What is thy petition , Esther , that it may be granted thee ? and what wilt thou have done : although thou ask the half of my kingdom , thou shalt have it .
DRA	Esther	7	3	Then she answered : If I have found Favour in thy sight , O king , and if it please thee , give me my life for which I ask , and my people for which I request .
DRA	Esther	7	4	For we are given up , I and my people , to be destroyed , to be slain , and to perish . And would God we were sold for bondmen and bondwomen : the evil might be borne with , and I would have mourned in silence : but now we have an enemy , whose cruelty redoundeth upon the king .
DRA	Esther	7	5	And king Assuerus answered and said : Who is this , and of what power , that he should do these things ?
DRA	Esther	7	6	And Esther said : It is this Aman that is our adversary and most wicked enemy . Aman hearing this was forthwith astonished , not being able to bear the countenance of the king and of the queen .
DRA	Esther	7	8	And when the king came back out of the garden set with trees , and entered into the place of the banquet , he found Aman was fallen upon the bed on which Esther lay , and he said : He will force the queen also in my presence , in my own house . The word was not yet gone out of the king 's mouth , and immediately they covered his face .
DRA	Esther	7	9	And Harbona , one of the eunuchs that stood waiting on the king , said : Behold the gibbet which he hath prepared for Mardochai , who spoke for the king , standeth in Aman 's house , being fifty cubits high . And the king said to him : Hang him upon it .

DRA	Esther	8	8	Write ye therefore to the Jews , as it pleaseth you , in the king 's name , and seal the letters with my ring . For this was the custom , that no man durst gainsay the letters which were sent in the king 's name , and were sealed with his ring .
DRA	Esther	8	1899	American Edition
DRA	Esther	8	2	And the king took the ring which he had commanded to be taken again from Aman , and gave it to Mardochai . And Esther set Mardochai over her house .
DRA	Esther	8	3	And not content with these things , she fell down at the king 's feet and wept , and speaking to him besought him , that he would give orders that the malice of Aman the Agagite , and his most wicked devices which he had invented against the Jews , should be of no effect .
DRA	Esther	8	4	But he , as the manner was , held out the golden sceptre with his hand , which was the sign of clemency : and she arose up and stood before him ,
DRA	Esther	8	5	And said : If it please the king , and if I have found favour in his sight , and my request be not disagreeable to him , I beseech thee , that the former letters of Aman the traitor and enemy of the Jews , by which he commanded that they should be destroyed in all the king 's provinces , may be reversed by new letters .
DRA	Esther	8	6	For how can I endure the murdering and slaughter of my people ?
DRA	Esther	8	7	And king Assuerus answered Esther the queen , and Mardochai the Jew : I have given Aman 's house to Esther , and I have commanded him to be hanged on a gibbet , because he durst lay hands on the Jews .
DRA	Esther	8	9	Then the king 's scribes and secretaries were called for ( now it was the time of the third month which is called Siban ) the three and twentieth day of the month , and letters were written , as Mardochai had a mind , to the Jews , and to the governors , and to the deputies , and to the judges , who were rulers over the hundred and twenty-seven provinces , from India even to Ethiopia : to province and province , to people and people , according to their languages and characters , and to the Jews , according as they could read and hear .
DRA	Esther	8	10	And these letters which were sent in the king 's name , were sealed with his ring , and sent by posts : who were to run through all the provinces , to prevent the former letters with new messages .
DRA	Esther	8	11	And the king gave orders to them , to speak to the Jews in every city , and to command them to gather themselves together , and to stand for their lives , and to kill and destroy all their enemies with their wives and children and all their houses , and to take their spoil .
DRA	Esther	8	12	And one day of revenge was appointed through all the provinces , to wit , the thirteenth of the twelfth month Adar .
DRA	Esther	8	13	And this was the content of the letter , that it should be notified in all lands and peoples that were subject to the empire of king Assuerus , that the Jews were ready to be revenged of their enemies .
DRA	Esther	8	14	So the swift posts went out carrying the messages , and the king 's edict was hung up in Susan .
DRA	Esther	8	15	And Mardochai going forth out of the palace , and from the king 's presence , shone in royal apparel , to wit , of violet and sky colour , wearing a golden crown on his head , and clothed with a cloak of silk and purple . And all the city rejoiced and was glad .
DRA	Esther	8	16	But to the Jews a new light seemed to rise , joy , honour , and dancing .
DRA	Esther	8	17	And in all peoples , cities , and provinces , whithersoever the king 's commandments came , there was wonderful rejoicing , feasts and banquets , and keeping holy day : insomuch that many of other nations and religion , joined themselves to their worship and ceremonies .

DRA	Esther	9	1899	American Edition
DRA	Esther	9	2	And they gathered themselves together in every city , and town , and place , to lay their hands on their enemies , and their persecutors . And no one durst withstand them , for the fear of their power had gone through every people .
DRA	Esther	9	3	And the judges of the provinces , and the governors , and lieutenants , and every one in dignity , that presided over every place and work , extolled the Jews for fear of Mardochai :
DRA	Esther	9	4	For they knew him to be prince of the palace , and to have great power : and the fame of his name increased daily , and was spread abroad through all men 's mouths .
DRA	Esther	9	5	So the Jews made a great slaughter of their enemies , and killed them , repaying according to what they had prepared to do to them :
DRA	Esther	9	6	Insomuch that even in Susan they killed five hundred men , besides the ten sons of Aman the Agagite , the enemy of the Jews : whose names are these :
DRA	Esther	9	7	Pharsandatha , and Delphon , and Esphatha ,
DRA	Esther	9	8	And Phoratha , and Adalia , and Aridatha ,
DRA	Esther	9	10	And when they had slain them , they would not touch the spoils of their goods .
DRA	Esther	9	11	And presently the number of them that were killed in Susan was brought to the king .
DRA	Esther	9	12	And he said to the queen : The Jews have killed five hundred men in the city of Susan , besides the ten sons of Aman : how many dost thou think they have slain in all the provinces ? What askest thou more , and what wilt thou have me to command to be done ?
DRA	Esther	9	13	And she answered : If it please the king , let it be granted to the Jews , to do to morrow in Susan as they have done to day , and that the ten sons of Aman may be hanged upon gibbets .
DRA	Esther	9	14	And the king commanded that it should be so done . And forthwith the edict was hung up in Susan , and the ten sons of Aman were hanged .
DRA	Esther	9	15	And on the fourteenth day of the month Adar the Jews gathered themselves together , and they killed in Susan three hundred men : but they took not their substance .
DRA	Esther	9	16	Moreover through all the provinces which were subject to the king 's dominion the Jews stood for their lives , and slew their enemies and persecutors : insomuch that the number of them that were Billed amounted to seventy-five thousand , and no man took any of their goods .
DRA	Esther	9	17	Now the thirteenth day of the month Adar was the first day with them all of the slaughter , and on the fourteenth day they left off . Which they ordained to be kept holy day , so that all times hereafter they should celebrate it with feasting , joy , and banquets .
DRA	Esther	9	18	But they that were killing in the city of Susan , were employed in the slaughter on the thirteenth and fourteenth day of the same month : and on the fifteenth day they rested . And therefore they appointed that day to be a holy day of feasting and gladness .
DRA	Esther	9	19	But those Jews that dwelt in towns not walled and in villages , appointed the fourteenth day of the month Adar for banquets and gladness , so as to rejoice on that day , and send one another portions of their banquets and meats .
DRA	Esther	9	20	And Mardochai wrote all these things , and sent them comprised in letters to the Jews that abode in all the king 's provinces , both those that lay near and those afar off ,
DRA	Esther	9	21	That they should receive the fourteenth and fifteenth day of the month Adar for holy days , and always at the return of the year should celebrate them with solemn honour :
DRA	Esther	9	22	Because on those days the Jews revenged themselves of their enemies , and their mourning and sorrow were turned into mirth and joy , and that these should be days of feasting and gladness , in which they should send one to another portions of meats ; and should give gifts to the poor .
DRA	Esther	9	23	And the Jews undertook to observe with solemnity all they had begun to do at that time , which Mardochai by letters had commanded to be done .
DRA	Esther	9	24	For Aman , the son of Amadathi of the race of Agag , the enemy and adversary of the Jews , had devised evil against them , to kill them and destroy them : and had cast Phur , that is , the lot .
DRA	Esther	9	25	And afterwards Esther went in to the king , beseeching him that his endeavours might be made void by the king 's letters : and the evil that he had intended against the Jews , might return upon his own head . And so both he and his sons were hanged upon gibbets .
DRA	Esther	9	26	And since that time these days are called Phurim , that is , of lots : because Phur , that is , the lot , was cast into the urn . And all things that were done , are contained in the volume of this epistle , that is , of this book :
DRA	Esther	9	27	And the things that they suffered , and that were afterwards changed , the Jews took upon themselves and their seed , and upon all that had a mind to be joined to their religion , so that it should be lawful for none to pass these days without solemnity : which the writing testifieth , and certain times require , as the years continually succeed one another .
DRA	Esther	9	28	These are the days which shall never be forgot : and which all provinces in the whole world shall celebrate throughout all generations : neither is there any city wherein the days of Phurim , that is , of lots , must not be observed by the Jews , and by their posterity , which is bound to these ceremonies .
DRA	Esther	9	29	And Esther the queen , the daughter of Abihail , and Mardochai the Jew , wrote also a second epistle , that with all diligence this day should be established a festival for the time to come .
DRA	Esther	9	30	And they sent to all the Jews that were in the hundred and twenty-seven provinces of king Assuerus , that they should have peace , and receive truth ,
DRA	Esther	9	31	And observe the days of lots , and celebrate them with joy in their proper time : as Mardochai and Esther had appointed , and they undertook them to be observed by themselves and by their seed , fasts , and cries , and the days of lots ,
DRA	Esther	9	32	And all things which are contained in the history of this book , which is called Esther . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )

DRA	Esther	10	3	And how Mardochai of the race of the Jews , was next after king Assuerus : and great among the Jews , and acceptable to the people of his brethren , seeking the good of his people , and speaking those things which were for the welfare of his seed .
DRA	Esther	10	4	Then Mardochai said : God hath done these things .
DRA	Esther	10	5	I remember a dream that I saw , which signified these same things : and nothing thereof hath failed .
DRA	Esther	10	6	The little fountain which grew into a river , and was turned into a light , and into the sun , and abounded into many waters , is Esther , whom the king married , and made queen .

DRA	Job	1	6	Now on a certain day when the sons of God came to stand before the Lord , Satan also was present among them .
DRA	Job	1	7	And the Lord said to him : Whence comest thou ? And he answered and said : I have gone round about the earth , and walked through it .
DRA	Job	1	8	And the Lord said to him : Hast thou considered my servant Job , that there is none like him in the earth , a simple and upright man , and fearing God , and avoiding evil ?
DRA	Job	1	9	And Satan answering , said : Doth Job fear God in vain ?
DRA	Job	1	10	Hast not thou made a fence for him , and his house , and all his substance round about , blessed the works of his hands , and his possession hath increased on the earth ?
DRA	Job	1	11	But stretch forth thy hand a little , and touch all that he hath , and see if he blesseth thee not to thy face .
DRA	Job	1	12	Then the Lord said to Satan : Behold , all that he hath is in thy hand : only put not forth thy hand upon his person . And Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord .
DRA	Job	1	13	Now upon a certain day when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their eldest brother ,
DRA	Job	1	14	There came a messenger to Job , and said : The oxen were ploughing , and the asses feeding beside them ,

DRA	Job	1	18	He was yet speaking , and behold another came in , and said : Thy sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their elder brother :
DRA	Job	1	19	A violent wind came on a sudden from the side of the desert , and shook the four corners of the house , and it fell upon thy children and they are dead , and I alone have escaped to fell thee .
DRA	Job	1	20	Then Job rose up , and rent his garments , and having shaven his head fell down upon the ground and worshipped ,
DRA	Job	1	21	And said : Naked came I out of my mother 's womb , and naked shall I return thither : the Lord gave , and the Lord hath taken away : as it hath pleased the Lord so is it done : blessed be the name of the Lord .

DRA	Job	2	3	And the Lord said to Satan : Hast thou considered my servant Job , that there is none like him in the earth , a man simple , and upright , and fearing God , and avoiding evil , and still keeping his innocence ?

DRA	Job	2	4	And Satan answered , and said : Skin for skin , and all that a man hath he will give for his life :
DRA	Job	2	5	But put forth thy hand , and touch his bone and his flesh , and then thou shalt see that he will bless thee to thy face .
DRA	Job	2	6	And the Lord said to Satan : Behold be is in thy hand , but yet save his life .

DRA	Job	28	6	The stones of it are the place of sapphires , and the clods of it are gold .
DRA	Job	28	7	The bird hath not known the path , neither hath the eye of the vulture beheld it .
DRA	Job	28	8	The children of the merchants have not trodden it , neither hath the lioness passed by it .
DRA	Job	28	9	He hath stretched forth his hand to the flint , he hath overturned mountains from the roots .
DRA	Job	28	10	In the rocks he hath cut out rivers , and his eye hath seen every precious thing .
DRA	Job	28	11	The depths also of rivers he hath searched , and hidden things he hath brought forth to light .
DRA	Job	28	12	But where is wisdom to be found , and where is the place of understanding ?
DRA	Job	28	13	Man knoweth not the price thereof , neither is it found in the land of them that live in delights .
DRA	Job	28	14	The depth saith : It is not in me : and the sea saith : It is not with me .
DRA	Job	28	15	The finest gold shall not purchase it , neither shall silver be weighed in exchange for it .
DRA	Job	28	16	It shall not be compared with the dyed colours of India , or with the most precious stone sardonyx , or the sapphire .
DRA	Job	28	17	Gold or crystal can not equal it , neither shall any vessels of gold be changed for it .
DRA	Job	28	18	High and eminent things shall not be mentioned in comparison of it : but wisdom is drawn out of secret places .
DRA	Job	28	19	The topaz of Ethiopia shall not be equal to it , neither shall it be compared to the cleanest dyeing .
DRA	Job	28	20	Whence then cometh wisdom ? and where is the place of understanding ?
DRA	Job	28	21	It is hid from the eyes of all living . and the fowls of the air know it not .
DRA	Job	28	22	Destruction and death have said : With our ears we have heard the fame thereof .
DRA	Job	28	23	God understandeth the way of it , and he knoweth the place thereof .
DRA	Job	28	24	For he beholdeth the ends of the world : and looketh on all things that are under heaven .
DRA	Job	28	25	Who made a weight for the winds and weighed the waters by measure .
DRA	Job	28	26	When he gave a law for the rain , and a way for the sounding storms .
DRA	Job	28	27	Then he saw it , and declared , and prepared , and searched it .
DRA	Job	29	29	Job also added , taking up his parable , and said :
DRA	Job	29	1899	American Edition
DRA	Job	29	2	Who will grant me , that I might be according to the months past , according to the days in which God kept me ?
DRA	Job	29	3	When his lamp shined over my head , and I walked by his light in darkness ?
DRA	Job	29	4	As I was in the days of my youth , when God was secretly in my tabernacle ?
DRA	Job	29	5	When the Almighty was with me : and my servants round about me ?
DRA	Job	29	6	When I washed my feet with butter , and the rock poured me out rivers of oil ?
DRA	Job	29	7	When I went out to the gate of the city , and in the street they prepared me a chair ?
DRA	Job	29	8	The young men saw me , and hid themselves : and the old men rose up and stood .
DRA	Job	29	9	The princes ceased to speak , and laid the finger on their mouth .
DRA	Job	29	10	The rulers held their peace , and their tongue cleaved to their throat .
DRA	Job	29	11	The ear that heard me blessed me , and the eye that saw me gave witness to me :
DRA	Job	29	12	Because I had delivered the poor man that cried out ; and the fatherless that had no helper .
DRA	Job	29	13	The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me , and I comforted the heart of the widow .
DRA	Job	29	14	I was clad with justice : and I clothed myself with my judgment , as with a robe and a diadem .
DRA	Job	29	15	I was an eye to the blind , and a foot to the lame .
DRA	Job	29	16	I was the father of the poor : and the cause which I knew not , I searched out most diligently .
DRA	Job	29	17	I broke the jaws of the wicked man , and out of his teeth I took away the prey .
DRA	Job	29	18	And I said : I shall die in my nest , and as a palm tree shall multiply my days .
DRA	Job	29	19	My root is opened beside the waters , and dew shall continue in my harvest .
DRA	Job	29	20	My glory shall always be renewed , and my bow in my hand shall be repaired .
DRA	Job	29	21	They that heard me , waited for my sentence , and being attentive held their peace at my counsel .
DRA	Job	29	22	To my words they durst add nothing , and my speech dropped upon them .
DRA	Job	29	23	They waited for me as for rain , and they opened their mouth as for a latter shower .
DRA	Job	29	24	If at any time I laughed on them , they believed not , and the light of my countenance fell not on earth .
DRA	Job	29	25	If I had a mind to go to them , I sat first , and when I sat as a king , with his army standing about him , yet I was a comforter of them that mourned . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Job	30	30	My skin is become black upon me , and my bones are dried up with heat .
DRA	Job	30	1899	American Edition
DRA	Job	30	2	The strength of whose hands was to me as nothing , and they were thought unworthy of life itself .
DRA	Job	30	3	Barren with want and hunger , who gnawed in the wilderness , disfigured with calamity and misery .
DRA	Job	30	4	And they ate grass , and barks of trees , and the root of junipers was their food .
DRA	Job	30	5	Who snatched up these things out of the valleys , and when they had found any of them , they ran to them with a cry .
DRA	Job	30	6	They dwelt in the desert places of torrents , and in caves of earth , or upon the gravel .
DRA	Job	30	7	They pleased themselves among these kind of things , and counted it delightful to be under the briers .
DRA	Job	30	8	The children of foolish and base men , and not appearing at all upon the earth .
DRA	Job	30	9	Now I am turned into their song , and am become their byword .
DRA	Job	30	10	They abhor me , and flee far from me , and are not afraid to spit in my face .
DRA	Job	30	11	For he hath opened his quiver , and hath afflicted me , and hath put a bridle into my mouth .
DRA	Job	30	12	At the right hand of my rising , my calamities forthwith arose : they have overthrown my feet , and have overwhelmed me with their paths as with waves .
DRA	Job	30	13	They have destroyed my ways , they have lain in wait against me , and they have prevailed , and there was none to help .
DRA	Job	30	14	They have rushed in upon me , as when a wall is broken , and a gate opened , and have rolled themselves down to my miseries .
DRA	Job	30	15	I am brought to nothing : as a wind thou hast taken away my desire : and my prosperity hath passed away like a cloud .
DRA	Job	30	16	And now my soul fadeth within myself , and the days of affliction possess me .
DRA	Job	30	17	In the night my bone is pierced with sorrows : and they that feed upon me , do not sleep .
DRA	Job	30	18	With the multitude of them my garment is consumed , and they have girded me about , as with the collar of my coat .
DRA	Job	30	19	I am compared to dirt , and am likened to embers and ashes .
DRA	Job	30	20	I cry to thee , and thou hearest me not : I stand up , and thou dost not regard me .
DRA	Job	30	21	Thou art changed to be cruel toward me , and in the hardness of thy hand thou art against me .
DRA	Job	30	22	Thou hast lifted me up , and set me as it were upon the wind , and thou hast mightily dashed me .
DRA	Job	30	23	I know that thou wilt deliver me to death , where a house is appointed for every one that liveth .
DRA	Job	30	24	But yet thou stretchest not forth thy hand to their consumption : and if they shall fall down thou wilt save .
DRA	Job	30	25	I wept heretofore for him that was afflicted , and my soul had compassion on the poor .
DRA	Job	30	26	I expected good things , and evils are come upon me : I waited for light , and darkness broke out .
DRA	Job	30	27	My inner parts have boiled without any rest , the days of affliction have prevented me .
DRA	Job	30	28	I went mourning without indignation ; I rose up , and cried in the crowd .
DRA	Job	30	29	I was the brother of dragons , and companion of ostriches .
DRA	Job	30	31	My harp is turned to mourning , and my organ into the voice of those that weep . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Job	31	31	If the men of my tabernacle have not said : Who will give us of his flesh that we may be filled ?
DRA	Job	31	1899	American Edition
DRA	Job	31	2	For what part should God from above have in me , and what inheritance the Almighty from on high ?
DRA	Job	31	3	Is not destruction to the wicked , and aversion to them that work iniquity ?
DRA	Job	31	4	Doth not he consider my ways , and number all my steps ?
DRA	Job	31	5	If I have walked in vanity , and my foot hath made haste to deceit :
DRA	Job	31	6	Let him weigh me in a just balance , and let God know my simplicity .
DRA	Job	31	7	If my step hath turned out of the way , and if my heart hath followed my eyes , and if a spot hath cleaved to my hands :
DRA	Job	31	8	Then let me sow and let another eat : and let my offspring be rooted out .
DRA	Job	31	9	If my heart hath been deceived upon a woman , and if I have laid wait at my friend 's door :
DRA	Job	31	10	Let my wife be the harlot of another , and let other men lie with her .
DRA	Job	31	11	For this is a heinous crime , and a most grievous iniquity .
DRA	Job	31	12	It is a fire that devoureth even to destruction , and rooteth up all things that spring .
DRA	Job	31	13	If I have despised to abide judgment with my manservant , or my maidservant , when they had any controversy against me :
DRA	Job	31	14	For what shall I do when God shall rise to judge ? and when he shall examine , what shall I answer him ?
DRA	Job	31	15	Did not he that made me in the womb make him also : and did not one and the same form me in the womb ?
DRA	Job	31	16	If I have denied to the poor what they desired , and have made the eyes of the widow wait :
DRA	Job	31	17	If I have eaten my morsel alone , and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof :
DRA	Job	31	18	( For from my infancy mercy grew up with me : and it came out with me from my mother 's womb : )
DRA	Job	31	19	If I have despised him that was perishing for want of clothing , and the poor man that had no covering :
DRA	Job	31	20	If his sides have not blessed me , and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep :
DRA	Job	31	21	If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless , even when I saw myself superior in the gate :
DRA	Job	31	22	Let my shoulder fall from its joint , and let my arm with its bones be broken .
DRA	Job	31	23	For I have always feared God as waves swelling over me , and his weight I was not able to bear .
DRA	Job	31	24	If I have thought gold my strength , and have said to fine gold : My confidence :
DRA	Job	31	25	If I have rejoiced over my great riches , and because my hand had gotten much .
DRA	Job	31	26	If I beheld the sun when it shined , and the moon going in brightness :
DRA	Job	31	27	And my heart in secret hath rejoiced , and I have kissed my hand with my mouth :
DRA	Job	31	28	Which is a very great iniquity , and a denial against the most high God .
DRA	Job	31	29	If I have been glad at the downfall of him that hated me , and have rejoiced that evil had found him .
DRA	Job	31	30	For I have not given my mouth to sin , by wishing a curse to his soul .
DRA	Job	31	32	The stranger did not stay without , my door was open to the traveller .
DRA	Job	31	33	If as a man I have hid my sin , and have concealed my iniquity in my bosom .
DRA	Job	31	34	If I have been afraid at a very great multitude , and the contempt of kinsmen hath terrified me : and I have not rather held my peace , and not gone out of the door .
DRA	Job	31	35	Who would grant me a hearer , that the Almighty may hear my desire ; and that he himself that judgeth would write a book ,
DRA	Job	31	36	That I may carry it on my shoulder , and put it about me as a crown ?
DRA	Job	31	37	At every step of mine I would pronounce it , and offer it as to a prince .
DRA	Job	31	38	If my land cry against me , and with it the furrows thereof mourn :
DRA	Job	31	39	If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money , and have afflicted the soul of the tillers thereof :
DRA	Job	31	40	Let thistles grow up to me instead of wheat , and thorns instead of barley . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Job	32	32	So these three men ceased to answer Job , because he seemed just to himself .
DRA	Job	32	1899	American Edition
DRA	Job	32	2	And Eliu the son of Barachel the Buzite , of the kindred of Ram , was angry and was moved to indignation : now he was angry against Job , because he said he was just before God .
DRA	Job	32	3	And he was angry with his friends because they had not found a reasonable answer , but only had condemned Job .
DRA	Job	32	4	So Eliu waited while Job was speaking , because they were his elders that were speaking .
DRA	Job	32	5	But when he saw that the three were not able to answer , he was exceedingly angry .
DRA	Job	32	6	Then Eliu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said : I am younger in days , and you are more ancient ; therefore hanging down my head , I was afraid to shew you my opinion .
DRA	Job	32	7	For I hoped that greater age would speak , and that a multitude of years would teach wisdom .
DRA	Job	32	8	But , as I see , there is a spirit in men , and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth understanding .
DRA	Job	32	9	They that are aged are not the wise men , neither do the ancients understand judgment .
DRA	Job	32	10	Therefore I will speak : Hearken to me , I also will shew you my wisdom .
DRA	Job	32	11	For I have waited for your words , I have given ear to your wisdom , as long as you were disputing in words .
DRA	Job	32	12	And as long as I thought you said some thing , I considered : but , as I see , there is none of you that can convince Job , and answer his words .
DRA	Job	32	13	Lest you should say : We have found wisdom , God hath cast him down , not man .
DRA	Job	32	14	He hath spoken nothing to me , and I will not answer him according to your words .
DRA	Job	32	15	They were afraid , and answered no more , and they left off speaking .
DRA	Job	32	16	Therefore because I have waited , and they have not spoken : they stood , and answered no more :
DRA	Job	32	17	I also will answer my part , and will shew my knowledge .
DRA	Job	32	18	For I am full of matter to speak of , and the spirit of my bowels straiteneth me .
DRA	Job	32	19	Behold , my belly is as new wine which wanteth vent , which bursteth the new vessels .
DRA	Job	32	20	I will speak and take breath a little : I will open my lips , and will answer .
DRA	Job	32	21	I will not accept the person of man , and I will not level God with man .
DRA	Job	32	22	For I know not how long I shall continue , and whether after a while my Maker may take me away . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )

DRA	Job	33	1899	American Edition
DRA	Job	33	2	Behold now I have opened my mouth , let my tongue speak within my jaws .
DRA	Job	33	3	My words are from my upright heart , and my lips shall speak a pure sentence .
DRA	Job	33	4	The spirit of God made me , and the breath of the Almighty gave me life .
DRA	Job	33	5	If thou canst , answer me , and stand up against my face .
DRA	Job	33	6	Behold God hath made me as well as thee , and of the same clay I also was formed .
DRA	Job	33	7	But yet let not my wonder terrify thee , and let not my eloquence be burdensome to thee .
DRA	Job	33	8	Now thou has said in my hearing , and I have heard the voice of thy words :
DRA	Job	33	9	I am clean , and without sin : I am unspotted , and there is no iniquity in me .
DRA	Job	33	10	Because he hath found complaints against me , therefore he hath counted me for his enemy .
DRA	Job	33	11	He hath put my feet in the stocks , he hath observed all my paths .
DRA	Job	33	12	Now this is the thing in which thou art not justified : I will answer thee , that God is greater than man .
DRA	Job	33	13	Dost thou strive against him , because he hath not answered thee to all words ?
DRA	Job	33	14	God speaketh once , and repeateth not the selfsame thing the second time .
DRA	Job	33	15	By a dream in a vision by night , when deep sleep falleth upon men , and they are sleeping in their beds :
DRA	Job	33	16	Then he openeth the ears of men , and teaching instructeth them in what they are to learn .
DRA	Job	33	17	That he may withdraw a man from the things he is doing , and may deliver him from pride .
DRA	Job	33	18	Rescuing his soul from corruption : and his life from passing to the sword .
DRA	Job	33	19	He rebuketh also by sorrow in the bed , and he maketh all his bones to wither .
DRA	Job	33	20	Bread becometh abominable to him in his life , and to his soul the meat which before he desired .
DRA	Job	33	21	His flesh shall be consumed away , and his bones that were covered shall be made bare .
DRA	Job	33	22	His soul hath drawn near to corruption , and his life to the destroyers .
DRA	Job	33	23	If there shall be an angel speaking for him , one among thousands , to declare man 's uprightness ,
DRA	Job	33	24	He shall have mercy on him , and shall say : Deliver him , that he may not go down to corruption : I have found wherein I may be merciful to him .
DRA	Job	33	25	His flesh is consumed with punishment , let him return to the days of his youth .
DRA	Job	33	26	He shall pray to God , and he will be gracious to him : and he shall see his face with joy , and he will render to man his justice .
DRA	Job	33	27	He shall look upon men , and shall say : I have sinned , and indeed I have offended , and I have not received what I have deserved .
DRA	Job	33	28	He hath delivered his soul from going into destruction , that it may live and see the light .
DRA	Job	33	29	Behold , all these things God worketh three times within every one .
DRA	Job	33	30	That he may withdraw their souls from corruption , and enlighten them with the light of the living .
DRA	Job	33	31	Attend , Job , and hearken to me : and hold thy peace , whilst I speak .
DRA	Job	33	32	But if thou hast any thing to say , answer me , speak : for I would have thee to appear just .
DRA	Job	34	34	Let men of understanding speak to me , and let a wise man hearken to me .
DRA	Job	34	1899	American Edition
DRA	Job	34	2	Hear ye , wise men , my words , and ye learned , hearken to me :
DRA	Job	34	3	For the ear trieth words , and the mouth discerneth meats by the taste .
DRA	Job	34	4	Let us choose to us judgment , and let us see among ourselves what is the best .
DRA	Job	34	5	For Job hath said : I am just , and God hath overthrown my judgment .
DRA	Job	34	6	For in judging me there is a lie : my arrow is violent without any sin .
DRA	Job	34	7	What man is there like Job , who drinketh up scorning like water ?
DRA	Job	34	8	Who goeth in company with them that work iniquity , and walketh with wicked men ?
DRA	Job	34	9	For he hath said : Man shall not please God , although he run with him .
DRA	Job	34	10	Therefore , ye men of understanding , hear me : far from god be wickedness , and iniquity from the Almighty .
DRA	Job	34	11	For he will render to a man his work , and according to the ways of every one he will reward them .
DRA	Job	34	12	For in very deed God will not condemn without cause , neither will the Almighty pervert judgment .
DRA	Job	34	13	What other hath he appointed over the earth ? or whom hath he set over the world which he made ?
DRA	Job	34	14	If he turn his heart to him , he shall draw his spirit and breath unto himself .
DRA	Job	34	15	All flesh shall perish together , and man shall return into ashes .
DRA	Job	34	16	If then thou hast understanding , hear what is said , and hearken to the voice of my words .
DRA	Job	34	17	Can he be healed that loveth not judgment ? and how dost thou so far condemn him that is just ?
DRA	Job	34	18	Who saith to the king : Thou art an apostate : who calleth rulers ungodly ?
DRA	Job	34	19	Who accepteth not the persons of princes : nor hath regarded the tyrant , when he contended against the poor man : for all are the work of his hands .
DRA	Job	34	20	They shall suddenly die , and the people shall be troubled at midnight , and they shall pass , and take away the violent without hand .
DRA	Job	34	21	For his eyes are upon the ways of men , and he considereth all their steps .
DRA	Job	34	22	There is no darkness , and there is no shadow of death , where they may be hid who work iniquity .
DRA	Job	34	23	For it is no longer in the power of man to enter into judgment with God .
DRA	Job	34	24	He shall break in pieces many and innumerable , and shall make others to stand in their stead .
DRA	Job	34	25	For he knoweth their works : and therefore he shall bring night on them , and they shall be destroyed .
DRA	Job	34	26	He hath struck them , as being wicked , in open sight .
DRA	Job	34	27	Who as it were on purpose have revolted from him , and would not understand all his ways :
DRA	Job	34	28	So that they caused the cry of the needy to come to him , and he heard the voice of the poor .
DRA	Job	34	29	For when he granteth peace , who is there that can condemn ? When he hideth his countenance , who is there that can behold him , whether it regard nations , or all men ?
DRA	Job	34	30	Who maketh a man that is a hypocrite to reign for the sins of the people ?
DRA	Job	34	31	Seeing then I have spoken of God , I will not hinder thee in thy turn .
DRA	Job	34	32	If I have erred , teach thou me : if I have spoken iniquity , I will add no more .
DRA	Job	34	33	Doth God require it of thee , because it hath displeased thee ? for thou begannest to speak , and not I : but if thou know any thing better , speak .
DRA	Job	34	35	But Job hath spoken foolishly , and his words sound not discipline .
DRA	Job	34	36	My father , let Job be tried even to the end : cease not from the man of iniquity .
DRA	Job	34	37	Because he addeth blasphemy upon his sins , let him be tied fast in the mean time amongst us : and then let him provoke God to judgment with his speeches . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Job	35	35	Moreover Eliu spoke these words :
DRA	Job	35	1899	American Edition
DRA	Job	35	2	Doth thy thought seem right to thee , that thou shouldst say : I am more just than God ?
DRA	Job	35	3	For thou saidst : That which is right doth not please thee : or what will it profit thee if I sin ?
DRA	Job	35	4	Therefore I will answer thy words , and thy friends with thee .
DRA	Job	35	5	Look up to heaven and see , and behold the sky , that it is higher than thee .
DRA	Job	35	6	If thou sin , what shalt thou hurt him ? and if thy iniquities be multiplied , what shalt thou do against him ?
DRA	Job	35	7	And if thou do justly , what shalt thou give him , or what shall he receive of thy hand ?
DRA	Job	35	8	Thy wickedness may hurt a man that is like thee : and thy justice may help the son of man .
DRA	Job	35	9	By reason of the multitude of oppressions they shall cry out : and shall wail for the violence of the arm of tyrants .
DRA	Job	35	10	And he hath not said : Where is God , who made me , who hath given songs in the night ?
DRA	Job	35	11	Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth , and instructeth us more than the fowls of the air .
DRA	Job	35	12	There shall they cry , and he will not hear , because of the pride of evil men .
DRA	Job	35	13	God therefore will not hear in vain , and the Almighty will look into the causes of every one .
DRA	Job	35	14	Yea when thou shalt say : He considereth not : be judged before him , and expect him .
DRA	Job	35	15	For he doth not now bring on his fury , neither doth he revenge wickedness exceedingly .
DRA	Job	35	16	Therefore Job openeth his mouth in vain , and multiplieth words without knowledge . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Job	36	36	Eliu also proceeded , and said :
DRA	Job	36	1899	American Edition
DRA	Job	36	2	Suffer me a little , and I will shew thee : for I have yet somewhat to speak in God 's behalf .
DRA	Job	36	3	I will repeat my knowledge from the beginning , and I will prove my Maker just .
DRA	Job	36	4	For indeed my words are without a lie , and perfect knowledge shall be proved to thee .
DRA	Job	36	5	God doth not cast away the mighty , whereas he himself also is mighty .
DRA	Job	36	6	But he saveth not the wicked , and he giveth judgment to the poor .
DRA	Job	36	7	He will not take away his eyes from the just , and he placeth kings on the throne for ever , and they are exalted .
DRA	Job	36	8	And if they shall be in chains , and be bound with the cords of poverty :
DRA	Job	36	9	He shall shew them their works , and their wicked deeds , because they have been violent .
DRA	Job	36	10	He also shall open their ear , to correct them : and shall speak , that they may return from iniquity .
DRA	Job	36	11	If they shall hear and observe , they shall accomplish their days in good , and their years in glory .
DRA	Job	36	12	But if they hear not , they shall pass by the sword , and shall be consumed in folly .
DRA	Job	36	13	Dissemblers and crafty men prove the wrath of God , neither shall they cry when they are bound .
DRA	Job	36	14	Their soul shall die in a storm , and their life among the effeminate .
DRA	Job	36	15	He shall deliver the poor out of his distress , and shall open his ear in affliction .
DRA	Job	36	16	Therefore he shall set thee at large out of the narrow mouth , and which hath no foundation under it : and the rest of thy table shall be full of fatness .
DRA	Job	36	17	Thy cause hath been judged as that of the wicked , cause and judgment thou shalt recover .
DRA	Job	36	18	Therefore let not anger overcome thee to oppress any man : neither let multitude of gifts turn thee aside .
DRA	Job	36	19	Lay down thy greatness without tribulation , and all the mighty of strength .
DRA	Job	36	20	Prolong not the night that people may come up for them .
DRA	Job	36	21	Beware thou turn not aside to iniquity : for this thou hast begun to follow after misery .
DRA	Job	36	22	Behold , God is high in his strength , and none is like him among the lawgivers .
DRA	Job	36	23	Who can search out his ways ? or who can say to him : Thou has wrought iniquity ?
DRA	Job	36	24	Remember that thou knowest not his work , concerning which men have sung .

DRA	Psalms	76	3	In the day of my trouble I sought God , with my hands lifted up to him in the night , and I was not deceived . My soul refused to be comforted :

DRA	Psalms	77	1899	American Edition
DRA	Psalms	77	2	I will open my mouth in parables : I will utter propositions from the beginning .
DRA	Psalms	77	3	How great things have we heard and known , and our fathers have told us .
DRA	Psalms	77	4	They have not been hidden from their children , in another generation . Declaring the praises of the Lord , and his powers , and his wonders which he hath done .
DRA	Psalms	77	5	And he set up a testimony in Jacob : and made a law in Israel . How great things he commanded our fathers , that they should make the same known to their children :
DRA	Psalms	77	6	That another generation might know them . The children that should be born and should rise up , and declare them to their children .
DRA	Psalms	77	7	That they may put their hope in God and may not forget the works of God : and may seek his commandments .
DRA	Psalms	77	8	That they may not become like their fathers , a perverse and exasperating generation . A generation that set not their heart aright : and whose spirit was not faithful to God .
DRA	Psalms	77	9	The sons of Ephraim who bend and shoot with the bow : they have turned back in the day of battle .
DRA	Psalms	77	10	They kept not the covenant of God : and in his law they would not walk .
DRA	Psalms	77	11	And they forgot his benefits , and his wonders that he had shewn them .
DRA	Psalms	77	12	Wonderful things did he do in the sight of their fathers , in the land of Egypt , in the field of Tanis .
DRA	Psalms	77	13	He divided the sea and brought them through : and he made the waters to stand as in a vessel .
DRA	Psalms	77	14	And he conducted them with a cloud by day : and all the night with a light of fire .
DRA	Psalms	77	15	He struck the rock in the wilderness : and gave them to drink , as out of the great deep .
DRA	Psalms	77	16	He brought forth water out of the rock : and made streams run down as rivers .
DRA	Psalms	77	17	And they added yet more sin against him : they provoked the most High to wrath in the place without water .
DRA	Psalms	77	18	And they tempted God in their hearts , by asking meat for their desires .
DRA	Psalms	77	19	And they spoke ill of God : they said : Can God furnish a table in the wilderness ?
DRA	Psalms	77	20	Because he struck the rock , and the waters gushed out , and the streams overflowed . Can he also give bread , or provide a table for his people ?
DRA	Psalms	77	21	Therefore the Lord heard , and was angry : and a fire was kindled against Jacob , and wrath came up against Israel .
DRA	Psalms	77	22	Because they believed not in God : and trusted not in his salvation .
DRA	Psalms	77	23	And he had commanded the clouds from above , and had opened the doors of heaven .
DRA	Psalms	77	24	And had rained down manna upon them to eat , and had given them the bread of heaven .
DRA	Psalms	77	25	Man ate the bread of angels : he sent them provisions in abundance .
DRA	Psalms	77	26	He removed the south wind from heaven : and by his power brought in the southwest wind .
DRA	Psalms	77	27	And he rained upon them flesh as dust : and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea .
DRA	Psalms	77	28	And they fell in the midst of their camp , round about their pavilions .
DRA	Psalms	77	29	So they did eat , and were filled exceedingly , and he gave them their desire :
DRA	Psalms	77	30	They were not defrauded of that which they craved . As yet their meat was in their mouth :
DRA	Psalms	77	31	And the wrath of God came upon them . And he slew the fat ones amongst them , and brought down the chosen men of Israel .
DRA	Psalms	77	32	In all these things they sinned still : and they believed not for his wondrous works .
DRA	Psalms	77	33	And their days were consumed in vanity , and their years in haste .
DRA	Psalms	77	34	When he slew them , then they sought him : and they returned , and came to him early in the morning .
DRA	Psalms	77	35	And they remembered that God was their helper : and the most high God their redeemer .
DRA	Psalms	77	36	And they loved him with their mouth : and with their tongue they lied unto him :
DRA	Psalms	77	37	But their heart was not right with him : nor were they counted faithful in his covenant .
DRA	Psalms	77	38	But he is merciful , and will forgive their sins : and will not destroy them . And many a time did he turn away his anger : and did not kindle all his wrath .
DRA	Psalms	77	39	And he remembered that they are flesh : a wind that goeth and returneth not .
DRA	Psalms	77	40	How often did they provoke him in the desert : and move him to wrath in the place without water ?
DRA	Psalms	77	41	And they turned back and tempted God : and grieved the holy one of Israel .
DRA	Psalms	77	42	They remembered not his hand , in the day that he redeemed them from the hand of him that afflicted them :
DRA	Psalms	77	43	How he wrought his signs in Egypt , and his wonders in the field of Tanis .
DRA	Psalms	77	44	And he turned their rivers into blood , and their showers that they might , not drink .
DRA	Psalms	77	45	He sent amongst them divers sores of flies , which devoured them : and frogs which destroyed them .
DRA	Psalms	77	46	And he gave up their fruits to the blast , and their labours to the locust .
DRA	Psalms	77	47	And he destroyed their vineyards with hail , and their mulberry trees with hoarfrost .
DRA	Psalms	77	48	And he gave up their cattle to the hail , and their stock to the fire .
DRA	Psalms	77	49	And he sent upon them the wrath of his indignation : indignation and wrath and trouble , which he sent by evil angels .
DRA	Psalms	77	50	He made a way for a path to his anger : he spared not their souls from death , and their cattle he shut up in death .
DRA	Psalms	77	51	And he killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt : the firstfruits of all their labour in the tabernacles of Cham .
DRA	Psalms	77	52	And he took away his own people as sheep : and guided them in the wilderness like a flock .
DRA	Psalms	77	53	And he brought them out in hope , and they feared not : band the sea overwhelmed their enemies .
DRA	Psalms	77	54	And he brought them into the mountain of his sanctuary : the mountain which his right hand had purchased . And he cast out the Gentiles before them : and by lot divided to them their land by a line of distribution .
DRA	Psalms	77	55	And he made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tabernacles .
DRA	Psalms	77	56	Yet they tempted , and provoked the most high God : and they kept not his testimonies .
DRA	Psalms	77	57	And they turned away , and kept not the covenant : even like their fathers they were turned aside as a crooked bow .
DRA	Psalms	77	58	They provoked him to anger on their hills : and moved him to jealousy with their graven things .
DRA	Psalms	77	59	God heard , and despised them , and he reduced Israel exceedingly as it were to nothing .
DRA	Psalms	77	60	And he put away the tabernacle of Silo , his tabernacle where he dwelt among men .
DRA	Psalms	77	61	And he delivered their strength into captivity : and their beauty into the hands of the enemy .
DRA	Psalms	77	62	And he shut up his people under the sword : and he despised his inheritance .
DRA	Psalms	77	63	Fire consumed their young men : and their maidens were not lamented .
DRA	Psalms	77	64	Their priests fell by the sword : and their widows did not mourn .
DRA	Psalms	77	65	And the Lord was awaked as one out of sleep , and like a mighty man that hath been surfeited with wine .
DRA	Psalms	77	66	And he smote his enemies on the hinder parts : he put them to an everlasting reproach .
DRA	Psalms	77	67	And he rejected the tabernacle of Joseph : and chose not the tribe of Ephraim :
DRA	Psalms	77	68	But he chose the tribe of Juda , mount Sion which he loved .
DRA	Psalms	77	69	And he built his sanctuary as of unicorns , in the land which he founded for ever .
DRA	Psalms	77	70	And he chose his servant David , and took him from the flocks of sheep : he brought him from following the ewes great with young ,
DRA	Psalms	77	71	To feed Jacob his servant , and Israel his inheritance .
DRA	Psalms	77	72	And he fed them in the innocence of his heart : and conducted them by the skillfulness of his hands . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )

DRA	Ecclesiastes	3	13	For every man that eateth and drinketh , and seeth good of his labour , this is the gift of God .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	3	14	I have learned that all the works which God hath made , continue for ever : we can not add any thing , nor take away from those things which God hath made that he may be feared .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	3	15	That which hath been made , the same continueth : the things that shall be , have already been : and God restoreth that which is past .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	3	16	I saw under the sun in the place of judgment wickedness , and in the place of justice iniquity .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	3	17	And I said in my heart : God shall judge both the just and the wicked , and then shall be the time of every thing .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	3	18	I said in my heart concerning the sons of men , that God would prove them , and shew them to be like beasts .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	3	19	Therefore the death of man , and of beasts is one , and the condition of them both is equal : as man dieth , so they also die : all things breathe alike , and man hath nothing more than beast : all things are subject to vanity .

DRA	Ecclesiastes	4	4	Again I considered all the labours of men , and I remarked that their industries are exposed to the envy of their neighhour : so in this also there is vanity , and fruitless care .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	4	1899	American Edition
DRA	Ecclesiastes	4	2	And I praised the dead rather than the living :
DRA	Ecclesiastes	4	3	And I judged him happier than them both , that is not yet born , nor hath seen the evils that are done under the sun .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	4	5	The fool foldeth his hands together , and eateth his own flesh , saying :
DRA	Ecclesiastes	4	6	Better is a handful with rest , than both hands full with labour , and vexation of mind .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	4	7	Considering I found also another vanity under the sun :
DRA	Ecclesiastes	4	8	There is but one , and he hath not a second , no child , no brother , and yet he ceaseth not to labour , neither are his eyes satisfied with riches , neither doth he reflect , saying : For whom do I labour , and defraud my soul of good things ? in this also is vanity , and a grievous vexation .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	4	9	It is better therefore that two should be together , than one : for they have the advantage of their society :
DRA	Ecclesiastes	4	10	If one fall he shall be supported by the other : woe to him that is alone , for when he falleth , he hath none to lift him up .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	4	11	And if two lie together , they shall warm one another : how shall one alone be warmed ?
DRA	Ecclesiastes	4	12	And if a man prevail against one , two shall withstand him : a threefold cord is not easily broken .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	4	13	Better is a child that is poor and wise , than a king that is old and foolish , who knoweth not to foresee for hereafter .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	4	14	Because out of prison and chains sometimes a man cometh forth to a kingdom : and another born king is consumed with poverty .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	4	15	I saw all men living , that walk under the sun with the second young man , who shall rise up in his place .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	4	16	The number of the people , of all that were before him is infinite : and they that shall come afterwards , shall not rejoice in him : but this also is vanity , and vexation of spirit .

DRA	Ecclesiastes	5	2	Dreams follow many cares : and in many words shall be found folly .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	5	3	If thou hast vowed any thing to God , defer not to pay it : for an unfaithful and foolish promise displeaseth him : but whatsoever thou hast vowed , pay it .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	5	4	And it is much better not to vow , than after a vow not to perform the things promised .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	5	6	Where there are many dreams , there are many vanities , and words without number : but do thou fear God .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	5	7	If thou shalt see the oppressions of the poor , and violent judgments , and justice perverted in the province , wonder not at this matter : for he that is high hath another higher , and there are others still higher than these :
DRA	Ecclesiastes	5	8	Moreover there is the king that reigneth over all the land subject to him .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	5	9	A covetous man shall not be satisfied with money : and he that loveth riches shall reap no fruit from them : so this also is vanity .

DRA	Ecclesiastes	5	11	Sleep is sweet to a labouring man , whether he eat little or much : but the fulness of the rich will not suffer him to sleep .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	5	12	There is also another grievous evil , which I have seen under the sun : riches kept to the hurt of the owner .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	5	13	For they are lost with very great affliction : he hath begotten a son , who shall be in extremity of want .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	5	14	As he came forth naked from his mother 's womb , so shall he return , and shall take nothing away with him of his labour .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	5	15	A most deplorable evil : as he came , so shall he return . What then doth it profit him that he hath laboured for the wind ?
DRA	Ecclesiastes	5	16	All the days of his life he eateth in darkness , and in many cares , and in misery , and sorrow .

DRA	Ecclesiastes	6	2	A man to whom God hath given riches , and substance , and honour , and his soul wanteth nothing of all that he desireth : yet God doth not give him power to eat thereof , but a stranger shall eat it up . This is vanity and a great misery .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	6	3	If a man beget a hundred children , and live many years , and attain to a great age , and his soul make no use of the goods of his substance , and he be without burial : of this man I pronounce , that the untimely born is better than he .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	6	4	For he came in vain , and goeth to darkness , and his name shall be wholly forgotten .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	6	5	He hath not seen the sun , nor known the distance of good and evil :
DRA	Ecclesiastes	6	7	All the labour of man is for his mouth , but his soul shall not be filled .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	6	8	What hath the wise man more than the fool ? and what the poor man , but to go thither , where there is life ?
DRA	Ecclesiastes	6	9	Better it is to see what thou mayst desire , than to desire that which thou canst not know . But this also is vanity , and presumption of spirit .

DRA	Ecclesiastes	7	2	A good name is better than precious ointments : and the day of death than the day of one 's birth .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	7	3	It is better to go to the house of mourning , than to the house of feasting : for in that we are put in mind of the end of all , and the living thinketh what is to come .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	7	4	Anger is better than laughter : because by the sadness of the countenance the mind of the offender is corrected .

DRA	Ecclesiastes	7	9	Better is the end of a speech than the beginning . Better is the patient man than the presumptuous .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	7	10	Be not quickly angry : for anger resteth in the bosom of a fool .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	7	11	Say not : What thinkest thou is the cause that former times were better than they are now ? for this manner of question is foolish .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	7	12	Wisdom with riches is more profitable , and bringeth more advantage to them that see the sun .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	7	13	For as wisdom is a defence , so money is a defence : but learning and wisdom excel in this , that they give life to him that possesseth them .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	7	14	Consider the works of God , that no man can correct whom he hath despised .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	7	15	In the good day enjoy good things , and beware beforehand of the evil day : for God hath made both the one and the other , that man may not find against him any just complaint .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	7	16	These things also I saw in the days of my vanity : A just man perisheth in his justice , and a wicked man liveth a long time in his wickedness .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	7	17	Be not over just : and be not more wise than is necessary , lest thou become stupid .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	7	18	Be not overmuch wicked : and be not foolish , lest thou die before thy time .

DRA	Ecclesiastes	7	21	For there is no just man upon earth , that doth good , and sinneth not .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	7	22	But do not apply thy heart to all words that are spoken : lest perhaps thou hear thy servant reviling thee .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	7	23	For thy conscience knoweth that thou also hast often spoken evil of others .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	7	24	I have tried all things in wisdom . I have said : I will be wise : and it departed farther from me ,
DRA	Ecclesiastes	7	25	Much more than it was : it is a great depth , who shall find it out ?
DRA	Ecclesiastes	7	26	I have surveyed all things with my mind , to know , and consider , and seek out wisdom and reason : and to know the wickedness of the fool , and the error of the imprudent :
DRA	Ecclesiastes	7	27	And I have found a woman more bitter than death , who is the hunter 's snare , and her heart is a net , and her hands are bands . He that pleaseth God shall escape from her : but he that is a sinner , shall be caught by her .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	7	28	Lo this have I found , said Ecclesiastes , weighing one thing after another , that I might find out the account ,
DRA	Ecclesiastes	7	29	Which yet my soul seeketh , and I have not found it . One man among a thousand I have found , a woman among them all I have not found .

DRA	Ecclesiastes	8	8	It is not in man 's power to stop the spirit , neither hath he power in the day of death , neither is he suffered to rest when war is at hand , neither shall wickedness save the wicked .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	8	1899	American Edition
DRA	Ecclesiastes	8	2	I observe the mouth of the king , and the commandments of the oath of God .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	8	3	Be not hasty to depart from his face , and do not continue in an evil work : for he will do all that pleaseth him :
DRA	Ecclesiastes	8	4	And his word is full of power : neither can any man say to him : Why dost thou so ?
DRA	Ecclesiastes	8	5	He that keepeth the commandments shall find no evil . The heart of a wise man understandeth time and answer .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	8	6	There is a time and opportunity for every business , and great affliction for man :
DRA	Ecclesiastes	8	7	Because he is ignorant of things past , and things to come he can not know by any messenger .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	8	9	All these things I have considered , and applied my heart to all the works that are done under the sun . Sometimes one man ruleth over another to his own hurt .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	8	10	I saw the wicked buried : who also when they were yet living were in the holy place , and were praised in the city as men of just works : but this also is vanity .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	8	11	For because sentence is not speedily pronounced against the evil , the children of men commit evils without any fear .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	8	12	But though a sinner do evil a hundred times , and by patience be borne withal , I know from thence that it shall be well with them that fear God , who dread his face .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	8	13	But let it not be well with the wicked , neither let his days be prolonged , but as a shadow let them pass away that fear not the face of the Lord .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	8	14	There is also another vanity , which is done upon the earth . There are just men to whom evils happen , as though they had done the works of the wicked : and there are wicked men , who are as secure , as though they had the deeds of the just : but this also I judge most vain .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	8	15	Therefore I commended mirth , because there was no good for a man under the sun , but to eat , and drink , and be merry , and that he should take nothing else with him of his labour in the days of his life , which God hath given him under the sun .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	8	16	And I applied my heart to know wisdom , and to understand the distraction that is upon earth : for there are some that day and night take no sleep with their eyes .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	8	17	And I understood that man can find no reason of all those works of God that are done under the sun : and the more he shall labour to seek , so much the less shall he find : yea , though the wise man shall say , that he knoweth it , he shall not be able to find it .

DRA	Ecclesiastes	9	9	Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest , all the days of thy unsteady life , which are given to thee under the sun , all the time of thy vanity : for this is thy portion in life , and in thy labour wherewith thou labourest under the sun .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	9	1899	American Edition
DRA	Ecclesiastes	9	2	But all things are kept uncertain for the time to come , because all things equally happen to the just and to the wicked , to the good and to the evil , to the clean and to the unclean , to him that offereth victims , and to him that despiseth sacrifices . As the good is , so also is the sinner : as the perjured , so he also that sweareth truth .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	9	3	This is a very great evil among all things that are done under the sun , that the same things happen to all men : whereby also the hearts of the children of men are filled with evil , and with contempt while they live , and afterwards they shall be brought down to hell .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	9	4	There is no man that liveth always , or that hopeth for this : a living dog is better than a dead lion .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	9	5	For the living know that they shall die , but the dead know nothing more , neither have they a reward any more : for the memory of them is forgotten .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	9	6	Their love also , and their hatred , and their envy are all perished , neither have they any part in this world , and in the work that is done under the sun .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	9	7	Go then , and eat thy bread with joy , and drink thy wine with gladness : because thy works please God .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	9	8	At all times let thy garments be white , and let not oil depart from thy head .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	9	10	Whatsoever thy hand is able to do , do it earnestly : for neither work , nor reason , nor wisdom , nor knowledge shall be in hell , whither thou art hastening .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	9	11	I turned me to another thing , and I saw that under the sun , the race is not to the swift , nor the battle to the strong , nor bread to the wise , nor riches to the learned , nor favour to the skillful : but time and chance in all .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	9	12	Man knoweth not his own end : but as fishes are taken with the hook , and as birds are caught with the snare , so men are taken in the evil time , when it shall suddenly come upon them .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	9	13	This wisdom also I have seen under the sun , and it seemed to me to be very great :
DRA	Ecclesiastes	9	14	A little city , and few men in it : there came against it a great king , and invested it , and built bulwarks round about it , and the siege was perfect .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	9	15	Now there was found in it a man poor and wise , and he delivered the city by his wisdom , and no man afterward remembered that poor man .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	9	16	And I said that wisdom is better than strength : how then is the wisdom of the poor man slighted , and his words not heard ?
DRA	Ecclesiastes	9	17	The words of the wise are heard in silence , more than the cry of a prince among fools .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	9	18	Better is wisdom , than weapons of war : and he that shall offend in one , shall lose many good things . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Ecclesiastes	10	10	If the iron be blunt , and be not as before , but be made blunt , with much labour it shall be sharpened : and after industry shall follow wisdom .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	10	1899	American Edition
DRA	Ecclesiastes	10	2	The heart of a wise man is in his right hand , and the heart of a fool is in his left hand .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	10	3	Yea , and the fool when he walketh in the way , whereas be himself is a fool , esteemeth all men fools .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	10	4	If the spirit of him that hath power , ascend upon thee , leave not thy place : because care will make the greatest sins to cease .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	10	5	There is an evil that I have seen under the sun , as it were by an error proceeding from the face of the prince :
DRA	Ecclesiastes	10	6	A fool set in high dignity , and the rich sitting beneath .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	10	7	I have seen servants upon horses : and princes walking on the ground as servants .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	10	8	He that diggeth a pit , shall fall into it : and he that breaketh a hedge , a serpent shall bite him .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	10	9	He that removeth stones , shall be hurt by them : and he that cutteth trees , shall be wounded by them .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	10	11	If a serpent bite in silence , he is nothing better that backbiteth secretly .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	10	12	The words of the mouth of a wise man are grace : but the lips of a fool shall throw him down headlong .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	10	13	The beginning of his words is folly , and the end of his talk is a mischievous error .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	10	14	A fool multiplieth words . A man can not tell what hath been before him : and what shall be after him , who can tell him ?
DRA	Ecclesiastes	10	15	The labour of fools shall afflict them that know not bow to go to the city .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	10	16	Woe to thee , O land , when thy king is a child , and when the princes eat in the morning .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	10	17	Blessed is the land , whose king is noble , and whose princes eat in due season for refreshment , and not for riotousness .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	10	18	By slothfulness a building shall be brought down , and through the weakness of hands , the house shall drop through .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	10	19	For laughter they make bread , and wine that the living may feast : and all things obey money .
DRA	Ecclesiastes	10	20	Detract not the king , no not in thy thought ; and speak not evil of the rich man in thy private chamber : because even the birds of the air will carry thy voice , and he that hath wings will tell what thou hast said .

DRA	Ezekiel	1	1	Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year , in the fourth month , on the fifth day of the month , when I was in the midst of the captives by the river Chobar , the heavens were opened , and I saw the visions of God .
DRA	Ezekiel	1	1899	American Edition
DRA	Ezekiel	1	2	On the fifth day of the month , the same was the fifth year of the captivity of king Joachin ,
DRA	Ezekiel	1	3	The word of the Lord came to Ezechiel the priest the son of Buzi in the land of the Chaldeans , by the river Chobar : and the hand of the Lord was there upon him .
DRA	Ezekiel	1	4	And I saw , and behold a whirlwind came out of the north : and a great cloud , and a fire infolding it , and brightness was about it : and out of the midst thereof , that is , out of the midst of the fire , as it were the resemblance of amber :
DRA	Ezekiel	1	5	And in the midst thereof the likeness of four living creatures : and this was their appearance : there was the likeness of a man in them .
DRA	Ezekiel	1	6	Every one had four faces , and every one four wings .
DRA	Ezekiel	1	7	Their feet were straight feet , and the sole of their foot was like the sole of a calf 's foot , and they sparkled like the appearance of glowing brass .
DRA	Ezekiel	1	8	And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides : and they had faces , and wings on the four sides ,
DRA	Ezekiel	1	9	And the wings of one were joined to the wings of another . They turned not when they went : but every one went straight forward .
DRA	Ezekiel	1	10	And as for the likeness of their faces : there was the face of a man , and the face of a lion on the right side of all the four : and the face of an ox , on the left side of all the four : and the face of an eagle over all the four .
DRA	Ezekiel	1	11	And their faces , and their wings were stretched upward : two wings of every one were joined , and two covered their bodies :
DRA	Ezekiel	1	12	And every one of them went straight forward : whither the impulse of the spirit was to go , thither they went : and they turned not when they went .
DRA	Ezekiel	1	13	And as for the likeness of the living creatures , their appearance was like that of burning coals of fire , and like the appearance of lamps . This was the vision running to and fro in the midst of the living creatures , a bright fire , and lightning going forth from the fire .
DRA	Ezekiel	1	14	And the living creatures ran and returned like flashes of lightning .
DRA	Ezekiel	1	15	Now as I beheld the living creatures , there appeared upon the earth by the living creatures one wheel with four faces .
DRA	Ezekiel	1	16	And the appearance of the wheels , and the work of them was like the appearance of the sea : and the four had all one likeness : and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the midst of a wheel .
DRA	Ezekiel	1	17	When they went , they went by their four parts : and they turned not when they went .
DRA	Ezekiel	1	18	The wheels had also a size , and a height , and a dreadful appearance : and the whole body was full of eyes round about all the four .
DRA	Ezekiel	1	19	And when the living creatures went , the wheels also went together by them : and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth , the wheels also were lifted up with them .
DRA	Ezekiel	1	20	Whithersoever the spirit went , thither as the spirit went the wheels also were lifted up withal , and followed it : for the spirit of life was in the wheels .
DRA	Ezekiel	1	21	When those went these went , and when those stood these stood , and when those were lifted up from the earth , the wheels also were lifted up together , and followed them : for the spirit of life was in the wheels .
DRA	Ezekiel	1	22	And over the heads of the living creatures was the likeness of the firmament , as the appearance of crystal terrible to behold , and stretched out over their heads above .
DRA	Ezekiel	1	23	And under the firmament were their wings straight , the one toward the other , every one with two wings covered his body , and the other was covered in like manner .
DRA	Ezekiel	1	24	And I heard the noise of their wings , like the noise of many waters , as it were the voice of the most high God : when they walked , it was like the voice of a multitude , like the noise of an army , and when they stood , their wings were let down .
DRA	Ezekiel	1	25	For when a voice came from above the firmament , that was over their heads , they stood , and let down their wings .
DRA	Ezekiel	1	26	And above the firmament that was over their heads , was the likeness of a throne , as the appearance of the sapphire stone , and upon the likeness of the throne , was a likeness as of the appearance of a man above upon it .
DRA	Ezekiel	1	27	And I saw as it were the resemblance of amber as the appearance of fire within it round about : from his loins and upward , and from his loins downward , I saw as it were the resemblance of fire shining round about .
DRA	Ezekiel	1	28	As the appearance of the rainbow when it is in a cloud on a rainy day : this was the appearance of the brightness round about . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )

DRA	Ezekiel	3	2	And I opened my mouth , and he caused me to eat that book :
DRA	Ezekiel	3	4	And he said to me : Son of man , go to the house of Israel , and thou shalt speak my words to them .
DRA	Ezekiel	3	5	For thou art not sent to a people of a profound speech , and of an unknown tongue , but to the house of Israel :
DRA	Ezekiel	3	6	Nor to many nations of a strange speech , and of an unknown tongue , whose words thou canst not understand : and if thou wert sent to them , they would hearken to thee .
DRA	Ezekiel	3	7	But the house of Israel will not hearken to thee : because they will not hearken to me : for all the house of Israel are of a hard forehead and an obstinate heart .

DRA	Ezekiel	3	15	And I came to them of the captivity , to the heap of new corn , to them that dwelt by the river Chobar , and I sat where they sat : and I remained there seven days mourning in the midst of them .

DRA	Ezekiel	3	17	Son of man , I have made thee a watchman to the house of Israel : and thou shalt hear the word out of my mouth , and shalt tell it them from me .
DRA	Ezekiel	3	18	If , when I say to the wicked , Thou shalt surely die : thou declare it not to him , nor speak to him , that he may be converted from his wicked way , and live : the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity , but I will require his blood at thy hand .
DRA	Ezekiel	3	19	But if thou give warning to the wicked , and he be not converted from his wickedness , and from his evil way : he indeed shall die in his iniquity , but thou hast delivered thy soul .
DRA	Ezekiel	3	20	Moreover if the just man shall turn away from his justice , and shall commit iniquity : I will lay a stumblingblock before him , he shall die , because thou hast not given him warning : he shall die in his sin , and his justices which he hath done , shall not be remembered : but I will require his blood at thy hand .
DRA	Ezekiel	3	21	But if thou warn the just man , that the just may not sin , and he doth not sin : living he shall live , because thou hast warned him , and thou hast delivered thy soul .
DRA	Ezekiel	3	22	And the hand of the Lord was upon me , and he said to me : Rise and go forth into the plain , and there I will speak to thee .
DRA	Ezekiel	3	23	And I rose up , and went forth into the plain : and behold the glory of the Lord stood there , like the glory which I saw by the river Chobar : and I fell upon my face .
DRA	Ezekiel	3	24	And the spirit entered into me , and set me upon my feet : and he spoke to me , and said to me : Go in ; and shut thyself up in the midst of thy house .

DRA	Ezekiel	3	26	And I will make thy tongue stick fast to the roof of thy mouth , and thou shalt be dumb , and not as a man that reproveth : because they are a provoking house .
DRA	Ezekiel	3	27	But when I shall speak to thee , I will open thy mouth , and thou shalt say to them : Thus saith the Lord God : He that heareth , let him hear : and he that forbeareth , let him forbear : for they are a provoking house .

DRA	Ezekiel	16	1899	American Edition
DRA	Ezekiel	16	2	Son of man , make known to Jerusalem her abominations .
DRA	Ezekiel	16	3	And thou shalt say : Thus saith the Lord God to Jerusalem : Thy root , and thy nativity is of the land of Chanaan , thy father was an Amorrhite , and thy mother a Cethite .
DRA	Ezekiel	16	4	And when thou wast born , in the day of thy nativity thy navel was not cut , neither wast thou washed with water for thy health , nor salted with salt , nor swaddled with clouts .
DRA	Ezekiel	16	5	No eye had pity on thee to do any of these things for thee , out of compassion to thee : but thou wast cast out upon the face of the earth in the abjection of thy soul , in the day that thou wast born .
DRA	Ezekiel	16	6	And passing by thee , I saw that thou wast trodden under foot in thy own blood . and I said to thee when thou wast in thy blood : Live : I have said to thee : Live in thy blood .
DRA	Ezekiel	16	7	I caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field : and thou didst increase and grow great , and advancedst , and camest to woman 's ornament : thy breasts were fashioned , and thy hair grew : and thou wast naked , and full of confusion .
DRA	Ezekiel	16	8	And I passed by thee , and saw thee : and behold thy time was the time of lovers : and I spread my garment over thee , and covered thy ignominy . And I swore to thee , and I entered into a covenant with thee , saith the Lord God : and thou becamest mine .
DRA	Ezekiel	16	9	And I washed thee with water , and cleansed away thy blood from thee : and I anointed thee with oil .
DRA	Ezekiel	16	10	And I clothed thee with embroidery , and shod thee with violet coloured shoes : and I girded thee about with fine linen , and clothed thee with fine garments .
DRA	Ezekiel	16	11	I decked thee also with ornaments , and put bracelets on thy hands , and a chain about thy neck .
DRA	Ezekiel	16	12	And I put a jewel upon thy forehead and earrings in thy ears , and a beautiful crown upon thy head .
DRA	Ezekiel	16	13	And thou wast adorned with gold , and silver , and wast clothed with fine linen , and embroidered work , and many colours : thou didst eat fine flour , and honey , and oil , and wast made exceeding beautiful : and wast advanced to be a queen .
DRA	Ezekiel	16	14	And thy renown went forth among the nations for thy beauty : for thou wast perfect through my beauty , which I had put upon thee , saith the Lord God .
DRA	Ezekiel	16	15	But trusting in thy beauty , thou playedst the harlot because of thy renown , and thou hast prostituted thyself to every passenger , to be his .
DRA	Ezekiel	16	17	And thou tookest thy beautiful vessels , of my gold , and my silver , which I gave thee , and thou madest thee images of men , and hast committed fornication with them .
DRA	Ezekiel	16	18	And thou tookest thy garments of divers colours , and coveredst them : and settest my oil and my sweet incense before them .
DRA	Ezekiel	16	19	And my bread which I gave thee , the fine flour , and oil , and honey , wherewith I fed thee , thou hast set before them for a sweet odour ; and it was done , saith the Lord God .
DRA	Ezekiel	16	20	And thou hast taken thy sons , and thy daughters , whom thou hast borne to me : and hast sacrificed the same to them to be devoured . Is thy fornication small ?
DRA	Ezekiel	16	21	Thou hast sacrificed and given my children to them , consecrating them by fire .
DRA	Ezekiel	16	22	And after all thy abominations , and fornications , thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth , when thou wast naked , and full of confusion , trodden under foot in thy own blood .
DRA	Ezekiel	16	23	And it came to pass after all thy wickedness ( woe , woe to thee , saith the Lord God )
DRA	Ezekiel	16	24	That thou didst also build thee a common stew , and madest thee a brothel house in every street .
DRA	Ezekiel	16	25	At every head of the way thou hast set up a sign of thy prostitution : and hast made thy beauty to be abominable : and hast prostituted thyself to every one that passed by , and hast multiplied thy fornications .
DRA	Ezekiel	16	26	And thou hast committed fornication with the Egyptians thy neighbours , men of large bodies , and hast multiplied thy fornications to provoke me .
DRA	Ezekiel	16	27	Behold , I will stretch out my hand upon thee , and will take away thy justification : and I will deliver thee up to the will of the daughters of the Philistines that hate thee , that are ashamed of thy wicked way .
DRA	Ezekiel	16	28	Thou hast also committed fornication with the Assyrians , because thou wast not yet satisfied : and after thou hadst played the harlot with them , even so thou wast not contented .
DRA	Ezekiel	16	29	Thou hast also multiplied thy fornications in the land of Chanaan with the Chaldeans : and neither so wast thou satisfied .
DRA	Ezekiel	16	30	Wherein shall I cleanse thy heart , saith the Lord God : seeing thou dost all these the works of a shameless prostitute ?
DRA	Ezekiel	16	31	Because thou hast built thy brothel house at the head of every way , and thou hast made thy high place in every street : and wast not as a harlot that by disdain enhanceth her price ,
DRA	Ezekiel	16	32	But as an adulteress , that bringeth in strangers over her husband .
DRA	Ezekiel	16	33	Gifts are given to all harlots : but thou hast given hire to all thy lovers , and thou hast given them gifts to come to thee from every side , to commit fornication with thee .
DRA	Ezekiel	16	34	And it hath happened in thee contrary to the custom of women in thy fornications , and after thee there shall be no such fornication : for in that thou gavest rewards , and didst not take rewards , the contrary hath been done in thee .
DRA	Ezekiel	16	35	Therefore , O harlot , hear the word of the Lord .
DRA	Ezekiel	16	36	Thus saith the Lord God : Because thy money hath been poured out , and thy shame discovered through thy fornications with thy lovers , and with the idols of thy abominations , by the blood of thy children whom thou gavest them :
DRA	Ezekiel	16	37	Behold , I will gather together all thy lovers with whom thou hast taken pleasure , and all whom thou hast loved , with all whom thou hast hated : and I will gather them together against thee on every side , and will discover thy shame in their sight , and they shall see all thy nakedness .
DRA	Ezekiel	16	38	And I will judge thee as adulteresses , and they that shed blood are judged : and I will give thee blood in fury and jealousy .
DRA	Ezekiel	16	39	And I will deliver thee into their hands , and they shall destroy thy brothel house , and throw down thy stews : and they shall strip thee of thy garments , and shall take away the vessels of thy beauty : and leave thee naked , and full of disgrace .
DRA	Ezekiel	16	40	And they shall bring upon thee a multitude , and they shall stone thee with stones , and shall slay thee with their swords .
DRA	Ezekiel	16	41	And they shall burn thy houses with fire , and shall execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women : and thou shalt cease from fornication , and shalt give no hire any more .
DRA	Ezekiel	16	42	And my indignation shall rest in thee : and my jealousy shall depart from thee , and I will cease and be angry no more .
DRA	Ezekiel	16	43	Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth , but hast provoked me in all these things : wherefore I also have turned thy ways upon thy head , saith the Lord God , and I have not done according to thy wicked deeds in all thy abominations .
DRA	Ezekiel	16	44	Behold every one that useth a common proverb , shall use this against thee , saying : As the mother was , so also is her daughter .
DRA	Ezekiel	16	45	Thou art thy mother 's daughter , that cast off her husband , and her children : and thou art the sister of thy sisters , who cast off their husbands , and their children : your mother was a Cethite , and your father an Amorrhite .
DRA	Ezekiel	16	46	And thy elder sister is Samaria , she and her daughters that dwell at thy left hand : and thy younger sister that dwelleth at thy right hand is Sodom , and her daughters .
DRA	Ezekiel	16	47	But neither hast thou walked in their ways , nor hast thou done a little less than they according to their wickednesses : thou hast done almost more wicked things than they in all thy ways .
DRA	Ezekiel	16	48	As I live , saith the Lord God , thy sister Sodom herself , and her daughters , have not done as thou hast done , and thy daughters .
DRA	Ezekiel	16	49	Behold this was the iniquity of Sodom thy sister , pride , fulness of bread , and abundance , and the idleness of her , and of her daughters : and they did not put forth their hand to the needy , and to the poor .
DRA	Ezekiel	16	50	And they were lifted up , and committed abominations before me : and I took them away as thou hast seen .
DRA	Ezekiel	16	51	And Samaria committed not half thy sins : but thou hast surpassed them with thy crimes , and hast justified thy sisters by all thy abominations which thou hast done .
DRA	Ezekiel	16	52	Therefore do thou also bear thy confusion , thou that hast surpassed thy sisters with thy sins , doing more wickedly than they : for they are justified above thee , therefore be thou also confounded , and bear thy shame , thou that hast justified thy sisters .
DRA	Ezekiel	16	53	And I will bring back and restore them by bringing back Sodom , with her daughters , and by bringing back Samaria , and her daughters : and I will bring those that return of thee in the midst of them .
DRA	Ezekiel	16	54	That thou mayest bear thy shame , and mayest be confounded in all that thou hast done , comforting them .
DRA	Ezekiel	16	55	And thy sister Sodom and her daughters shall return to their ancient state : and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their ancient state : and thou and thy daughters shall return to your ancient state .
DRA	Ezekiel	16	56	And Sodom thy sister was not heard of in thy mouth , in the day of thy pride ,
DRA	Ezekiel	16	57	Before thy malice was laid open : as it is at this time , making thee a reproach of the daughters of Syria , and of all the daughters of Palestine round about thee , that encompass thee on all sides .
DRA	Ezekiel	16	58	Thou hast borne thy wickedness , and thy disgrace , saith the Lord God .
DRA	Ezekiel	16	59	For thus saith the Lord God : I will deal with thee , as thou hast despised the oath , in breaking the covenant :
DRA	Ezekiel	16	60	And I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth : and I will establish with thee an everlasting covenant .
DRA	Ezekiel	16	61	And thou shalt remember thy ways , and be ashamed : when thou shalt receive thy sisters , thy elder and thy younger : and I will give them to thee for daughters , but not by thy covenant .
DRA	Ezekiel	16	62	And I will establish my covenant with thee : and thou shalt know that I am the Lord ,
DRA	Ezekiel	16	63	That thou mayest remember , and be confounded , and mayest no more open thy mouth because of thy confusion , when I shall be pacified toward thee for all that thou hast done , saith the Lord God . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )

DRA	Ezekiel	17	1899	American Edition
DRA	Ezekiel	17	2	Son of man , put forth a riddle , and speak a parable to the house of Israel ,
DRA	Ezekiel	17	3	And say : Thus saith the Lord God : A large eagle with great wings , long-limbed , full of feathers , and of variety , came to Libanus , and took away the marrow of the cedar .
DRA	Ezekiel	17	4	He cropped off the top of the twigs thereof : and carried it away into the land of Chanaan , and he set it in a city of merchants .
DRA	Ezekiel	17	5	And he took of the seed of the land , and put it in the ground for seed , that it might take a firm root over many waters : he planted it on the surface of the earth .
DRA	Ezekiel	17	6	And it sprung up and grew into a spreading vine of low stature , and the branches thereof looked towards him : and the roots thereof were under him . So it became a vine , and grew into branches , and shot forth sprigs .
DRA	Ezekiel	17	7	And there was another large eagle , with great wings , and many feathers : and behold this vine , bending as it were her roots towards him , stretched forth her branches to him , that he might water it by the furrows of her plantation .
DRA	Ezekiel	17	8	It was planted in a good ground upon many waters , that it might bring forth branches , and bear fruit , that it might become a large vine .
DRA	Ezekiel	17	9	Say thou : Thus saith the Lord God : Shall it prosper then ? shall he not pull up the roots thereof , and strip off its fruit , and dry up all the branches it hath shot forth , and make it wither : and this without a strong arm , or many people , to pluck it up by the root ?
DRA	Ezekiel	17	10	Behold , it is planted : shall it prosper then ? shall it not be dried up when the burning wind shall touch it , and shall it not wither in the furrows where it grew ?
DRA	Ezekiel	17	11	And the word of the Lord came to me , saying :
DRA	Ezekiel	17	12	Say to the provoking house : Know you not what these things mean ? Tell them : Behold the king of Babylon cometh to Jerusalem : and he shall take away the king and the princes thereof , and carry them with him to Babylon .
DRA	Ezekiel	17	13	And he shall take one of the king 's seed , and make a covenant with him , and take an oath of him . Yea , and he shall take away the mighty men of the land ,
DRA	Ezekiel	17	14	That it may be a low kingdom and not lift itself up , but keep his covenant , and observe it .
DRA	Ezekiel	17	15	But he hath revolted from him and sent ambassadors to Egypt , that it might give him horses , and much people . And shall he that hath done thus prosper , or be saved ? and shall he escape that hath broken the covenant ?
DRA	Ezekiel	17	16	As I live , saith the Lord God : In the place where the king dwelleth that made him king , whose oath he hath made void , and whose covenant he broke , even in the midst of Babylon shall he die .
DRA	Ezekiel	17	18	For he had despised the oath , breaking his covenant , and behold he hath given his hand : and having done all these things , he shall not escape .
DRA	Ezekiel	17	19	Therefore thus saith the Lord God : As I live , I will lay upon his head the oath he hath despised , and the covenant he hath broken .
DRA	Ezekiel	17	20	And I will spread my net over him , and he shall be taken in my net : and I will bring him into Babylon , and will judge him there for the transgression by which he hath despised me .
DRA	Ezekiel	17	21	And all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the sword : and the residue shall be scattered into every wind : and you shall know that I the Lord have spoken .
DRA	Ezekiel	17	22	Thus saith the Lord God : I myself will take of the marrow of the high cedar , and will set it : I will crop off a tender twig from the top of the branches thereof , and I will plant it on a mountain high and eminent .
DRA	Ezekiel	17	23	On the high mountains of Israel will I plant it , and it shall shoot forth into branches , and shall bear fruit , and it shall become a great cedar : and all birds shall dwell under it , and every fowl shall make its nest under the shadow of the branches thereof .
DRA	Ezekiel	17	24	And all the trees of the country shall know that I the Lord have brought down the high tree , and exalted the low tree : and have dried up the green tree , and have caused the dry tree to flourish . I the Lord have spoken and have done it . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Ezekiel	18	18	As for his father , because he oppressed and offered violence to his brother , and wrought evil in the midst of his people , behold he is dead in his own iniquity .
DRA	Ezekiel	18	1899	American Edition
DRA	Ezekiel	18	2	That you use among you this parable as a proverb in the land of Israel , saying : The fathers have eaten sour grapes , and the teeth of the children are set on edge .
DRA	Ezekiel	18	3	As I live , saith the Lord God , this parable shall be no more to you a proverb in Israel .
DRA	Ezekiel	18	4	Behold all souls are mine : as the soul of the father , so also the soul of the son is mine : the soul that sinneth , the same shall die .
DRA	Ezekiel	18	5	And if a man be just , and do judgment and justice ,
DRA	Ezekiel	18	6	And hath not eaten upon the mountains , nor lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel : and hath not defiled his neighbour 's wife , nor come near to a menstruous woman :
DRA	Ezekiel	18	7	And hath not wronged any man : but hath restored the pledge to the debtor , hath taken nothing away by violence : hath given his bread to the hungry , and hath covered the naked with a garment :
DRA	Ezekiel	18	8	Hath not lent upon usury , nor taken any increase : hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity , and hath executed true judgment between man and man :
DRA	Ezekiel	18	9	Hath walked in my commandments , and kept my judgments , to do truth : he is just , he shall surely live , saith the Lord God .
DRA	Ezekiel	18	10	And if he beget a son that is a robber , a shedder of blood , and that hath done some one of these things :
DRA	Ezekiel	18	11	Though he doth not all these things , but that eateth upon the mountains , and that defileth his neighbour 's wife :
DRA	Ezekiel	18	12	That grieveth the needy and the poor , that taketh away by violence , that restoreth not the pledge , and that lifteth up his eyes to idols , that committeth abomination :
DRA	Ezekiel	18	13	That giveth upon usury , and that taketh an increase : shall such a one live ? he shall not live . Seeing he hath done all these detestable things , he shall surely die , his blood shall be upon him .
DRA	Ezekiel	18	14	But if he beget a son , who , seeing all his father 's sins , which he hath done , is afraid , and shall not do the like to them :
DRA	Ezekiel	18	15	That hath not eaten upon the mountains , nor lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel , and hath not defiled his neighbour 's wife :
DRA	Ezekiel	18	16	And hath not grieved any man , nor withholden the pledge , nor taken away with violence , but hath given his bread to the hungry , and covered the naked with a garment :
DRA	Ezekiel	18	17	That hath turned away his hand from injuring the poor , hath not taken usury and increase , but hath executed my judgments , and hath walked in my commandments : this man shall not die for the iniquity of his father , but living he shall live .
DRA	Ezekiel	18	19	And you say : Why hath not the son borne the iniquity of his father ? Verily , because the son hath wrought judgment and justice , hath kept all my commandments , and done them , living , he shall live .
DRA	Ezekiel	18	20	The soul that sinneth , the same shall die : the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father , and the father shall not bear the iniquity of the son : the justice of the just shall be upon him , and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him .
DRA	Ezekiel	18	21	But if the wicked do penance for all his sins which he hath committed , and keep all my commandments , and do judgment , and justice , living he shall live , and shall not die .
DRA	Ezekiel	18	22	I will not remember all his iniquities that he hath done : in his justice which he hath wrought , he shall live .
DRA	Ezekiel	18	23	Is it my will that a sinner should die , saith the Lord God , and not that he should be converted from his ways , and live ?
DRA	Ezekiel	18	24	But if the just man turn himself away from his justice , and do iniquity according to all the abominations which the wicked man useth to work , shall he live ? all his justices which he hath done , shall not be remembered : in the prevarication , by which he hath prevaricated , and in his sin , which he hath committed , in them he shall die .
DRA	Ezekiel	18	25	And you have said : The way of the Lord is not right . Hear ye , therefore , O house of Israel : Is it my way that is not right , and are not rather your ways perverse ?
DRA	Ezekiel	18	26	For when the just turneth himself away from his justice , and committeth iniquity , he shall die therein : in the injustice that he hath wrought he shall die .
DRA	Ezekiel	18	27	And when the wicked turneth himself away from his wickedness , which he hath wrought , and doeth judgment , and justice : he shall save his soul alive .
DRA	Ezekiel	18	28	Because he considereth and turneth away himself from all his iniquities which he hath wrought , he shall surely live , and not die .
DRA	Ezekiel	18	29	And the children of Israel say : The way of the Lord is not right . Are not my ways right , O house of Israel , and are not rather your ways perverse ?
DRA	Ezekiel	18	30	Therefore will I judge every man according to his ways , O house of Israel , saith the Lord God . Be converted , and do penance for all your iniquities : and iniquity shall not be your ruin .
DRA	Ezekiel	18	31	Cast away from you all your transgressions , by which you have transgressed , and make to yourselves a new heart , and a new spirit : and why will you die , O house of Israel ?
DRA	Ezekiel	18	32	For I desire not the death of him that dieth , saith the Lord God , return ye and live . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Ezekiel	19	19	Moreover take thou up a lamentation for the princes of Israel ,
DRA	Ezekiel	19	1899	American Edition
DRA	Ezekiel	19	2	And say : Why did thy mother the lioness lie down among the lions , and bring up her whelps in the midst of young lions ?
DRA	Ezekiel	19	3	And she brought out one of her whelps , and he became a lion : and he learned to catch the prey , and to devour men .
DRA	Ezekiel	19	4	And the nations heard of him , and took him , but not without receiving wounds : and they brought him in chains into the land of Egypt .
DRA	Ezekiel	19	5	But she seeing herself weakened , and that her hope was lost , took one of her young lions , and set him up for a lion .
DRA	Ezekiel	19	6	And he went up and down among the lions , and became a lion : and he learned to catch the prey , and to devour men .
DRA	Ezekiel	19	7	He learned to make widows , and to lay waste their cities : and the land became desolate , and the fulness thereof by the noise of his roaring .
DRA	Ezekiel	19	8	And the nations came together against him on every side out of the provinces , and they spread their net over him , in their wounds he was taken .
DRA	Ezekiel	19	9	And they put him into a cage , they brought him in chains to the king of Babylon : and they cast him into prison , that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel .
DRA	Ezekiel	19	10	Thy mother is like a vine in thy blood planted by the water : her fruit and her branches have grown out of many waters .
DRA	Ezekiel	19	11	And she hath strong rods to make sceptres for them that bear rule , and her stature was exalted among the branches : and she saw her height in the multitude of her branches .
DRA	Ezekiel	19	12	But she was plucked up in wrath , and cast on the ground , and the burning wind dried up her fruit : her strong rods are withered , and dried up : the fire hath devoured her .
DRA	Ezekiel	19	13	And now she is transplanted into the desert , in a land not passable , and dry .
DRA	Ezekiel	19	14	And a fire is gone out from a rod of her branches , which hath devoured her fruit : so that she now hath no strong rod , to be a sceptre of rulers . This is a lamentation , and it shall be for a lamentation . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Ezekiel	20	20	And sanctify my sabbaths , that they may be a sign between me and you : and that you may know that I am the Lord your God .
DRA	Ezekiel	20	1899	American Edition
DRA	Ezekiel	20	2	And the word of the Lord came to me , saying :
DRA	Ezekiel	20	3	Son of man , speak to the ancients of Israel , and say to them : Thus saith the Lord God : Are you come to inquire of me ? As I live , I will not answer you , saith the Lord God .
DRA	Ezekiel	20	4	If thou judgest them , if thou judgest , son of man , declare to them the abominations of their fathers .
DRA	Ezekiel	20	5	And say to them : Thus saith the Lord God : In the day when I chose Israel , and lifted up my hand for the race of the house of Jacob : and appeared to them in the land of Egypt , and lifted up my hand for them , saying : I am the Lord your God :
DRA	Ezekiel	20	6	In that day I lifted up my hand for them , to bring them out of the land of Egypt , into a land which I had provided for them , flowing with milk and honey , which excelleth amongst all lands .
DRA	Ezekiel	20	7	And I said to them : Let every man cast away the scandals of his eyes , and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt : I am the Lord your God .
DRA	Ezekiel	20	8	But they provoked me , and would not hearken to me : they did not every man cast away the abominations of his eyes , neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt : and I said I would pour out my indignation upon them , and accomplish my wrath against them in the midst of the land of Egypt .
DRA	Ezekiel	20	9	But I did otherwise for my name 's sake , that it might not be violated before the nations , in the midst of whom they were , and among whom I made myself known to them , to bring them out of the land of Egypt .
DRA	Ezekiel	20	10	Therefore I brought them out from the land of Egypt , and brought them into the desert .
DRA	Ezekiel	20	11	And I gave them my statutes , and I shewed them my judgments , which if a man do , he shall live in them .
DRA	Ezekiel	20	12	Moreover I gave them also my sabbaths , to be a sign between me and them : and that they might know that I am the Lord that sanctify them .
DRA	Ezekiel	20	13	But the house of Israel provoked me in the desert : they walked not in my statutes , and they cast away my judgments , which if a man do he shall live in them : and they grievously violated my sabbaths . I said therefore that I would pour out my indignation upon them in the desert , and would consume them .
DRA	Ezekiel	20	14	But I spared them for the sake of my name , lest it should be profaned before the nations , from which I brought them out , in their sight .
DRA	Ezekiel	20	15	So I lifted up my hand over them in the desert , not to bring them into the land which I had given them flowing with milk and honey , the best of all lands .
DRA	Ezekiel	20	16	Because they cast off my judgments , and walked not in my statutes , and violated my sabbaths : for their heart went after idols .
DRA	Ezekiel	20	17	Yet my eye spared them , so that I destroyed them not : neither did I consume them in the desert .
DRA	Ezekiel	20	18	And I said to their children in the wilderness : Walk not in the statutes of your fathers , and observe not their judgments , nor be ye defiled with their idols :
DRA	Ezekiel	20	19	I am the Lord your God : walk ye in my statutes , and observe my judgments , and do them .
DRA	Ezekiel	20	21	But their children provoked me , they walked not in my commandments , nor observed my judgments to do them : which if a man do , he shall live in them : and they violated my sabbaths : and I threatened to pour out my indignation upon them , and to accomplish my wrath in them in the desert .
DRA	Ezekiel	20	22	But I turned away my hand , and wrought for my name 's sake , that it might not be violated before the nations , out of which I brought them forth in their sight .
DRA	Ezekiel	20	23	Again I lifted up my hand upon them in the wilderness , to disperse them among the nations , and scatter them through the countries :
DRA	Ezekiel	20	24	Because they had not done my judgments , and had cast off my statutes , and had violated my sabbaths , and their eyes had been after the idols of their fathers .
DRA	Ezekiel	20	25	Therefore I also gave them statutes that were not good , and judgments , in which they shall not live .
DRA	Ezekiel	20	26	And I polluted them in their own gifts , when they offered all that opened the womb , for their offences : and they shall know that I am the Lord .
DRA	Ezekiel	20	27	Wherefore speak to the house of Israel , O son of man , and say to them : Thus saith the Lord God : Moreover in this also your fathers blasphemed me , when they had despised and contemned me ;
DRA	Ezekiel	20	28	And I had brought them into the land , for which I lifted up my hand to give it them : they saw every high hill , and every shady tree , and there they sacrificed their victims : and there they presented the provocation of their offerings , and there they set their sweet odours , and poured forth their libations .
DRA	Ezekiel	20	29	And I said to them : What meaneth the high place to which you go ? and the name thereof was called High-place even to this day .
DRA	Ezekiel	20	30	Wherefore say to the house of Israel : Thus saith the Lord God : Verily , you are defiled in the way of your fathers , and you commit fornication with their abominations .
DRA	Ezekiel	20	31	And you defile yourselves with all your : idols unto this day , in the offering of your gifts , when you make your children pass through the fire : and shall I answer you , O house of Israel ? As I live , saith the Lord God , I will not answer you .
DRA	Ezekiel	20	32	Neither shall the thought of your mind come to pass , by which you say : We will be as the Gentiles , and as the families of the earth , to worship stocks and stones .

DRA	Ezekiel	21	2	Son of man , set thy face toward Jerusalem , and let thy speech flow towards the holy places , and prophesy against the land of Israel :
DRA	Ezekiel	21	3	And say to the land of Israel : Thus saith the Lord God : Behold I come against thee , and I will draw forth my sword out of its sheath , and will cut off in thee the just , and the wicked .
DRA	Ezekiel	21	4	And forasmuch as I have cut off in thee the just , and the wicked , therefore shall my sword go forth out of its sheath against all flesh , from the south even to the north .
DRA	Ezekiel	21	5	That all flesh may know that I the Lord have drawn my sword out of its sheath not to be turned back .
DRA	Ezekiel	21	6	And thou , son of man , mourn with the breaking of thy loins , and with bitterness sigh before them .
DRA	Ezekiel	21	7	And when they shall say to thee : Why mournest thou ? thou shalt say : For that which I hear : because it cometh , and every heart shall melt , and all hands shall be made feeble , and every spirit shall faint , and water shall run down every knee : behold it cometh , and it shall be done , saith the Lord God .
DRA	Ezekiel	21	8	And the word of the Lord came to me , saying :
DRA	Ezekiel	21	9	Son of man , prophesy , and say : Thus saith the Lord God : Say : The sword , the sword is sharpened , and furbished .
DRA	Ezekiel	21	10	It is sharpened to kill victims : it is furbished that it may glitter : thou removest the sceptre of my son , thou hast cut down every tree .
DRA	Ezekiel	21	11	And I have given it to be furbished , that it may be handled : this sword is sharpened , and it is furbished , that it may be in the hand of the slayer .
DRA	Ezekiel	21	12	Cry , and howl , O son of man , for this sword is upon my people , it is upon all the princes of Israel , that are fled : they are delivered up to the sword with my people , strike therefore upon thy thigh ,
DRA	Ezekiel	21	13	Because it is tried : and that when it shall overthrow the sceptre , and it shall not be , saith the Lord God .
DRA	Ezekiel	21	14	Thou therefore , O son of man , prophesy , and strike thy hands together , and let the sword be doubled , and let the sword of the slain be tripled : this is the sword of a great slaughter , that maketh them stand amazed ,
DRA	Ezekiel	21	15	And languish in heart , and that multiplieth ruins . In all their gates I have set the dread of the sharp sword , the sword that is furbished to glitter , that is made ready for slaughter .
DRA	Ezekiel	21	16	Be thou sharpened , go to the right hand , or to the left , which way soever thou hast a mind to set thy face .
DRA	Ezekiel	21	17	And I will clap my hands together , and will satisfy my indignation : I the Lord have spoken .
DRA	Ezekiel	21	18	And the word of the Lord came to me , saying :
DRA	Ezekiel	21	19	And thou son of man , set thee two ways , for the sword of the king of Babylon to come : both shall come forth out of one land : and with his hand he shall draw lots , he shall consult at the head of the way of the city .
DRA	Ezekiel	21	20	Thou shalt make a way that the sword may come to Rabbath of the children of Ammon , and to Juda unto Jerusalem the strong city .
DRA	Ezekiel	21	22	On his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem , to set battering rams , to open the mouth in slaughter , to lift up the voice in howling , to set engines against the gates , to cast up a mount , to build forts .
DRA	Ezekiel	21	23	And he shall be in their eyes as one consulting the oracle in vain , and imitating the leisure of sabbaths : but he will call to remembrance the iniquity that they may be taken .
DRA	Ezekiel	21	24	Therefore thus saith the Lord God : Because you have remembered your iniquity , and have discovered your prevarications , and your sins have appeared in all your devices : because , I say , you have remembered , you shall be taken with the hand .
DRA	Ezekiel	21	25	But thou profane wicked prince of Israel , whose day is come that hath been appointed in the time of iniquity :
DRA	Ezekiel	21	26	Thus saith the Lord God : Remove the diadem , take off the crown : is it not this that hath exalted the low one , and brought down him that was high ?
DRA	Ezekiel	21	27	I will shew it to be iniquity , iniquity , iniquity : but this was not done till he came to whom judgment belongeth , and I will give it him .
DRA	Ezekiel	21	28	And thou son of man , prophesy , and say : Thus saith the Lord God concerning the children of Ammon , and concerning their reproach , and thou shalt say : O sword , O sword , come out of the scabbard to kill , be furbished to destroy , and to glitter ,
DRA	Ezekiel	21	29	Whilst they see vain things in thy regard , and they divine lies : to bring thee upon the necks of the wicked that are wounded , whose appointed day is come in the time of iniquity .

DRA	Ezekiel	22	2	And thou son of man , dost thou not judge , dost thou not judge the city of blood ?
DRA	Ezekiel	22	3	And thou shalt shew her all her abominations , and shalt say : Thus saith the Lord God : This is the city that sheddeth blood in the midst of her , that her time may come : and that hath made idols against herself , to defile herself .
DRA	Ezekiel	22	4	Thou art become guilty in thy blood which thou hast shed : and thou art defiled in thy idols which thou hast made : and thou hast made thy days to draw near , and hast brought on the time of thy years : therefore have I made thee a reproach to the Gentiles , and a mockery to all countries .
DRA	Ezekiel	22	5	Those that are near , and those that are far from thee , shall triumph over thee : thou filthy one , infamous , great in destruction .
DRA	Ezekiel	22	6	Behold the princes of Israel , every one hath employed his arm in thee to shed blood .
DRA	Ezekiel	22	7	They have abused father and mother in thee , they have oppressed the stranger in the midst of thee , they have grieved the fatherless and widow in thee .

DRA	Ezekiel	22	17	And the word of the Lord came to me , saying :
DRA	Ezekiel	22	18	Son of man , the house of Israel is become dross to me : all these are brass , and tin , and iron , and lead , in the midst of the furnace : they are become the dross of silver .
DRA	Ezekiel	22	19	Therefore thus saith the Lord God : Because you are all turned into dross , therefore behold I will gather you together in the midst of Jerusalem .
DRA	Ezekiel	22	20	As they gather silver , and brass , and tin , and iron , and lead in the midst of the furnace : that I may kindle a fire in it to melt it : so will I gather you together in my fury and in my wrath , and will take my rest , and I will melt you down .
DRA	Ezekiel	22	21	And I will gather you together , and will burn you in the fire of my wrath , and you shall be melted in the midst thereof .
DRA	Ezekiel	22	23	And the word of the Lord came to me , saying :
DRA	Ezekiel	22	24	Son of man , say to her : Thou art a land that is unclean , and not rained upon in the day of wrath .
DRA	Ezekiel	22	25	There is a conspiracy of prophets in the midst thereof : like a lion that roareth and catcheth the prey , they have devoured souls , they have taken riches and hire , they have made many widows in the midst thereof .
DRA	Ezekiel	22	26	Her priests have despised my law , and have defiled my sanctuaries : they have put no difference between holy and profane : nor have distinguished between the polluted and the clean : and they have turned away their eyes from my sabbaths , and I was profaned in the midst of them .
DRA	Ezekiel	22	27	Her princes in the midst of her , are like wolves ravening the prey to shed blood , and to destroy souls , and to run after gains through covetousness .

DRA	Ezekiel	23	23	The children of Babylon , and all the Chaldeans , the nobles , and the kings , and princes , all the sons of the Assyrians , beautiful young men , all the captains , and rulers , the princes of princes , and the renowned horsemen .
DRA	Ezekiel	23	1899	American Edition
DRA	Ezekiel	23	2	Son of man , there were two women , daughters of one mother .
DRA	Ezekiel	23	3	And they committed fornication in Egypt , in their youth they committed fornication : there were their breasts pressed down , and the teats of their virginity were bruised .
DRA	Ezekiel	23	4	And their names were Oolla the elder , and Ooliba her younger sister : and I took them , and they bore sons and daughters . Now for their names , Samaria is Oolla , and Jerusalem is Ooliba .
DRA	Ezekiel	23	5	And Oolla committed fornication against me , and doted on her lovers , on the Assyrians that came to her ,
DRA	Ezekiel	23	6	Who were clothed with blue , princes , and rulers , beautiful youths , all horsemen , mounted upon horses .
DRA	Ezekiel	23	7	And she committed her fornications with those chosen men , all sons of the Assyrians : and she defiled herself with the uncleanness of all them on whom she doted .
DRA	Ezekiel	23	8	Moreover also she did not forsake her fornications which she had committed in Egypt : for they also lay with her in her youth , and they bruised the breasts of her virginity , and poured out their fornication upon her .
DRA	Ezekiel	23	9	Therefore have I delivered her into the hands of her lovers , into the hands of the sons of the Assyrians , upon whose lust she doted .
DRA	Ezekiel	23	10	They discovered her disgrace , took away her sons and daughters , and slew her with the sword : and they became infamous women , and they executed judgments in her .
DRA	Ezekiel	23	11	And when her sister Ooliba saw this , she was mad with lust more than she : and she carried her fornication beyond the fornication of her sister .
DRA	Ezekiel	23	12	Impudently prostituting herself to the children of the Assyrians , the princes , and rulers that came to her , clothed with divers colours , to the horsemen that rode upon horses , and to young men all of great beauty .
DRA	Ezekiel	23	13	And I saw that she was defiled , and that they both took one way .
DRA	Ezekiel	23	14	And she increased her fornications : and when she had seen men painted on the wall , the images of the Chaldeans set forth in colours ,
DRA	Ezekiel	23	15	And girded with girdles about their reins , and with dyed turbans on their heads , the resemblance of all the captains , the likeness of the sons of Babylon , and of the land of the Chaldeans wherein they were born ,
DRA	Ezekiel	23	16	She doted upon them with the lust of her eyes , and she sent messengers to them into Chaldea .
DRA	Ezekiel	23	17	And when the sons of Babylon were come to her to the bed of love , they defiled her with their fornications , and she was polluted by them , and her soul was glutted with them .
DRA	Ezekiel	23	18	And she discovered her fornications , and discovered her disgrace : and my soul was alienated from her , as my soul was alienated from her sister .
DRA	Ezekiel	23	19	For she multiplied her fornications , remembering the days of her youth , in which she played the harlot in the land of Egypt .
DRA	Ezekiel	23	20	And she was mad with lust after lying with them whose flesh is as the flesh of asses : and whose issue as the issue of horses .
DRA	Ezekiel	23	21	And thou hast renewed the wickedness of thy youth , when thy breasts were pressed in Egypt , and the paps of thy virginity broken .
DRA	Ezekiel	23	22	Therefore , Ooliba , thus saith the Lord God : Behold I will raise up against thee all thy lovers with whom thy soul hath been glutted : and I will gather them together against thee round about .
DRA	Ezekiel	23	24	And they shall come upon thee well appointed with chariot and wheel , a multitude of people : they shall be armed against thee on every side with breastplate , and buckler , and helmet : and I will set judgment before them , and they shall judge thee by their judgments .
DRA	Ezekiel	23	25	And I will set my jealousy against thee , which they shall execute upon thee with fury : they shall cut off thy nose and thy ears : and what remains shall fall by the sword : they shall take thy sons , and thy daughters , and thy residue shall be devoured by fire .
DRA	Ezekiel	23	26	And they shall strip thee of thy garments , and take away the instruments of thy glory .
DRA	Ezekiel	23	27	And I will put an end to thy wickedness in thee , and thy fornication brought out of the land of Egypt : neither shalt thou lift up thy eyes to them , nor remember Egypt any more .
DRA	Ezekiel	23	28	For thus saith the Lord God : Behold , I will deliver thee into the hands of them whom thou hatest , into their hands with whom thy soul hath been glutted .
DRA	Ezekiel	23	29	And they shall deal with thee in hatred , and they shall take away all thy labours , and shall let thee go naked , and full of disgrace , and the disgrace of thy fornication shall be discovered , thy wickedness , and thy fornications .
DRA	Ezekiel	23	30	They have done these things to thee , because thou hast played the harlot with the nations among which thou wast defiled with their idols .
DRA	Ezekiel	23	31	Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister , and I will give her cup into thy hand .
DRA	Ezekiel	23	32	Thus saith the Lord God : Thou shalt drink thy sister 's cup , deep , and wide : thou shalt be had in derision and scorn , which containeth very much .
DRA	Ezekiel	23	33	Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness , and sorrow : with the cup of grief , and sadness , with the cup of thy sister Samaria .
DRA	Ezekiel	23	34	And thou shalt drink it , and shalt drink it up even to the dregs , and thou shalt devour the fragments thereof , thou shalt rend thy breasts : because I have spoken it , saith the Lord God .
DRA	Ezekiel	23	35	Therefore thus saith the Lord God : Because thou hast forgotten me , and hast cast me off behind thy back , bear thou also thy wickedness , and thy fornications .
DRA	Ezekiel	23	36	And the Lord spoke to me , saying : Son of man , dost thou judge Oolla , and Ooliba , and dost thou declare to them their wicked deeds ?
DRA	Ezekiel	23	37	Because they have committed adultery , and blood is in their hands , and they have committed fornication with their idols : moreover also their children , whom they bore to me , they have offered to them to be devoured .
DRA	Ezekiel	23	38	Yea , and they have done this to me . They polluted my sanctuary on the same day , and profaned my sabbaths .
DRA	Ezekiel	23	39	And when they sacrificed their children to their idols , and went into my sanctuary the same day to profane it : they did these things even in the midst of my house .
DRA	Ezekiel	23	40	They sent for men coming from afar , to whom they had sent a messenger : and behold they came : for whom thou didst wash thyself , and didst paint thy eyes , and wast adorned with women 's ornaments .
DRA	Ezekiel	23	41	Thou sattest on a very fine bed , and a table was decked before thee : whereupon thou didst set my incense , and my ointment .
DRA	Ezekiel	23	42	And there was in her the voice of a multitude rejoicing : and to some that were brought of the multitude of men , and that came from the desert , they put bracelets on their hands , and beautiful crowns on their heads .
DRA	Ezekiel	23	43	And I said to her that was worn out in her adulteries : Now will this woman still continue in her fornication .
DRA	Ezekiel	23	44	And they went in to her , as to a harlot : so went they in unto Oolla , and Ooliba , wicked women .
DRA	Ezekiel	23	45	They therefore are just men : these shall judge them as adulteresses are judged , and as shedders of blood are judged : because they are adulteresses , and blood is in their hands .
DRA	Ezekiel	23	46	For thus saith the Lord God : Bring a multitude upon them , and deliver them over to tumult and rapine :
DRA	Ezekiel	23	47	And let the people stone them with stones , and let them be stabbed with their swords : they shall kill their sons and daughters , and their houses they shall burn with fire .
DRA	Ezekiel	23	48	And I will take away wickedness out of the land : and all women shall learn , not to do according to the wickedness of them .

DRA	Ezekiel	24	1899	American Edition
DRA	Ezekiel	24	2	Son of man , write thee the name of this day , on which the king of Babylon hath set himself against Jerusalem to day .
DRA	Ezekiel	24	3	And thou shalt speak by a figure a parable to the provoking house , and say to them : Thus saith the Lord God : Set on a pot , set it on , I say , and put water into it .
DRA	Ezekiel	24	4	Heap together into it the pieces thereof , every good piece , the thigh and the shoulder , choice pieces and full of bones .
DRA	Ezekiel	24	5	Take the fattest of the flock , and lay together piles of bones under it : the seething thereof is boiling hot , and the bones thereof are thoroughly sodden in the midst of it .
DRA	Ezekiel	24	6	Therefore thus saith the Lord God : Woe to the bloody city , to the pot whose rust is in it , and its rust is not gone out of it : cast it out piece by piece , there hath no lot fallen upon it .
DRA	Ezekiel	24	7	For her blood is in the midst of her , she hath shed it upon the smooth rock : she hath not shed it upon the ground , that it might be covered with dust .
DRA	Ezekiel	24	8	And that I might bring my indignation upon her , and take my vengeance : I have shed her blood upon the smooth rock , that it should not be covered .
DRA	Ezekiel	24	9	Therefore thus saith the Lord God : Woe to the bloody city , of which I will make a great bonfire .
DRA	Ezekiel	24	10	Heap together the bones , which I will burn with fire : the flesh shall be consumed , and the whole composition shall be sodden , and the bones shall be consumed .
DRA	Ezekiel	24	11	Then set it empty upon burning coals , that it may be hot , and the brass thereof may be melted : and let the filth of it be melted in the midst thereof , and let the rust of it be consumed .
DRA	Ezekiel	24	12	Great pains have been taken , and the great rust thereof is not gone out , not even by fire .
DRA	Ezekiel	24	13	Thy uncleanness is execrable : because I desired to cleanse thee , and thou art not cleansed from thy filthiness : neither shalt thou be cleansed , before I cause my indignation to rest in thee .
DRA	Ezekiel	24	14	I the Lord have spoken : it shall come to pass , and I will do it : I will not pass by , nor spare , nor be pacified : I will judge thee according to thy ways , and according to thy doings , saith the Lord .
DRA	Ezekiel	24	15	And the word of the Lord came to me , saying :
DRA	Ezekiel	24	16	Son of man , behold I take from thee the desire of thy eyes with a stroke : and thou shalt not lament , nor weep : neither shall thy tears run down .
DRA	Ezekiel	24	17	Sigh in silence , make no mourning for the dead : let the tire of thy head be upon thee , and thy shoes on thy feet , and cover not thy face , nor eat the meat of mourners .
DRA	Ezekiel	24	18	So I spoke to the people in the morning , and my wife died in the evening : and I did in the morning as he had commanded me .
DRA	Ezekiel	24	19	And the people said to me : Why dost thou not tell us what these things mean that thou doest ?
DRA	Ezekiel	24	20	And I said to them : The word of the Lord came to me , saying :
DRA	Ezekiel	24	21	Speak to the house of Israel : Thus saith the Lord God : Behold I will profane my sanctuary , the glory of your realm , and the thing that your eyes desire , and for which your soul feareth : your sons , and your daughters , whom you have left , shall fall by the sword .
DRA	Ezekiel	24	22	And you shall do as I have done : you shall not cover your faces , nor shall you eat the meat of mourners .
DRA	Ezekiel	24	23	You shall have crowns on your heads , and shoes on your feet : you shall not lament nor weep , but you shall pine away for your iniquities , and every one shall sigh with his brother .
DRA	Ezekiel	24	25	And thou , O son of man , behold in the day wherein I will take away from them their strength , and the joy of their glory , and the desire of their eyes , upon which their souls rest , their sons and their daughters .
DRA	Ezekiel	24	26	In that day when he that escapeth shall come to thee , to tell thee :
DRA	Ezekiel	24	27	In that day , I say , shall thy mouth be opened to him that hath escaped , and thou shalt speak , and shalt be silent no more : and thou shalt be unto them for a sign of things to come , and you shall know that I am the Lord .

DRA	Ezekiel	31	31	And it came to pass in the eleventh year , the third month , the first day of the month , that the word of the Lord came to me , saying :
DRA	Ezekiel	31	1899	American Edition
DRA	Ezekiel	31	2	Son of man , speak to Pharao king of Egypt , and to his people : To whom art thou like in thy greatness ?
DRA	Ezekiel	31	3	Behold , the Assyrian was like a cedar in Libanus , with fair branches , and full of leaves , of a high stature , and his top was elevated among the thick boughs .
DRA	Ezekiel	31	4	The waters nourished him , the deep set him up on high , the streams thereof ran round about his roots , and it sent forth its rivulets to all the trees of the country .
DRA	Ezekiel	31	5	Therefore was his height exalted above all the trees of the country : and his branches were multiplied , and his boughs were elevated because of many waters .
DRA	Ezekiel	31	6	And when he had spread forth his shadow , all the fowls of the air made their nests in his boughs , and all the beasts of the forest brought forth their young under his branches , and the assembly of many nations dwelt under his shadow .
DRA	Ezekiel	31	7	And he was most beautiful for his greatness , and for the spreading of his branches : for his root was near great waters .
DRA	Ezekiel	31	8	The cedars in the paradise of God were not higher than he , the fir trees did not equal his top , neither were the plane trees to be compared with him for branches : no tree in the paradise of God was like him in his beauty .
DRA	Ezekiel	31	9	For I made him beautiful and thick set with many branches : and all the trees of pleasure , that were in the paradise of God , envied him .
DRA	Ezekiel	31	10	Therefore thus saith the Lord God : Because he was exalted in height , and shot up his top green and thick , and his heart was lifted up in his height :
DRA	Ezekiel	31	11	I have delivered him into the hands of the mighty one of the nations , he shall deal with him : I have cast him out according to his wickedness .
DRA	Ezekiel	31	12	And strangers , and the most cruel of the nations shall cut him down , and cast him away upon the mountains , and his boughs shall fall in every valley , and his branches shall be broken on every rock of the country : and all the people of the earth shall depart from his shadow , and leave him .
DRA	Ezekiel	31	13	All the fowls of the air dwelt upon his ruins , and all the beasts of the field were among his branches .
DRA	Ezekiel	31	14	For which cause none of the trees by the waters shall exalt themselves for their height : nor shoot up their tops among the thick branches and leaves , neither shall any of them that are watered stand up in their height : for they are all delivered unto death to the lowest parts of the earth , in the midst of the children of men , with them that go down into the pit .
DRA	Ezekiel	31	15	Thus saith the Lord God : In the day when he went down to hell , I brought in mourning , I covered him with the deep : and I withheld its rivers , and restrained the many waters : Libanus grieved for him , and all the trees of the field trembled .
DRA	Ezekiel	31	16	I shook the nations with the sound of his fall , when I brought him down to hell with them that descend into the pit : and all the trees of pleasure , the choice and best in Libanus , all that were moistened with waters , were comforted in the lowest parts of the earth .

DRA	Ezekiel	31	18	To whom art thou like , O thou that art famous and lofty among the trees of pleasure ?

DRA	Ezekiel	32	11	For thus saith the Lord God : The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon thee ,
DRA	Ezekiel	32	12	By the swords of the mighty I will overthrow thy multitude : all these nations are invincible : and they shall waste the pride of Egypt , and the multitude thereof shall be destroyed .
DRA	Ezekiel	32	13	I will destroy also all the beasts thereof that were beside the great waters : and the foot of man shall trouble them no more , neither shall the hoof of beasts trouble them .
DRA	Ezekiel	32	14	Then will I make their waters clear , and cause their rivers to run like oil , saith the Lord God :
DRA	Ezekiel	32	15	When I shall have made the land of Egypt desolate : and the land shall be destitute of her fulness , when I shall have struck all the inhabitants thereof : and they shall know that I am the Lord .
DRA	Ezekiel	32	16	This is the lamentation , and they shall lament therewith : the daughters of the nations shall lament therewith : for Egypt , and for the multitude thereof they shall lament therewith , saith the Lord God .
DRA	Ezekiel	32	17	And it came to pass in the twelfth year , in the fifteenth day of the month that the word of the Lord came to me , saying :
DRA	Ezekiel	32	18	Son of man , sing a mournful song for the multitude of Egypt : and cast her down , both her , and the daughters of the mighty nations to the lowest part of the earth , with them that go down into the pit .
DRA	Ezekiel	32	19	Whom dost thou excel in beauty ? go down and sleep with the uncircumcised .
DRA	Ezekiel	32	20	They shall fall in the midst of them that are slain with the sword : the sword is given , they have drawn her down , and all her people .
DRA	Ezekiel	32	21	The most mighty among the strong ones shall speak to him from the midst of hell , they that went down with his helpers , and slept uncircumcised , slain by the sword .
DRA	Ezekiel	32	22	Assur is there , and all his multitude : their graves are round about him , all of them slain , and that fell by the sword .
DRA	Ezekiel	32	23	Whose graves are set in the lowest parts of the pit : and his multitude lay round about his grave : all of them slain , and fallen by the sword , they that heretofore spread terror in the land of the living .
DRA	Ezekiel	32	24	There is Elam and all his multitude round about his grave , all of them slain , and fallen by the sword ; that went down uncircumcised to the lowest parts of the earth : that caused their terror in the land of the living , and they have borne their shame with them that go down into the pit .
DRA	Ezekiel	32	25	In the midst of the slain they have set him a bed among all his people : their graves are round about him : all these are uncircumcised , and slain by the sword : for they spread their terror in the land of the living , and have borne their shame with them that descend into the pit : they are laid in the midst of the slain .
DRA	Ezekiel	32	26	There is Mosoch , and Thubal , and all their multitude : their graves are round about him : all of them uncircumcised and slain , and fallen by the sword : though they spread their terror in the land of the living .
DRA	Ezekiel	32	27	And they shall not sleep with the brave , and with them that fell uncircumcised , that went down to hell with their weapons , and laid their swords under their heads , and their iniquities were in their bones , because they were the terror of the mighty in the land of the living .
DRA	Ezekiel	32	28	So thou also shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised , and shalt sleep with them that are slain by the sword .
DRA	Ezekiel	32	29	There is Edom , and her kings , and all her princes , who with their army are joined with them that are slain by the sword : and have slept with the uncircumcised , and with them that go down into the pit .
DRA	Ezekiel	32	30	There are all the princes of the north , and all the hunters : who were brought down with the slain , fearing , and confounded in their strength : who slept uncircumcised with them that are slain by the sword , and have borne their shame with them that go down into the pit .

DRA	Ezekiel	33	1899	American Edition
DRA	Ezekiel	33	2	Son of man , speak to the children of thy people , and say to them : When I bring the sword upon a land , if the people of the land take a man , one of their meanest , and make him a watchman over them :
DRA	Ezekiel	33	3	And he see the sword coming upon the land , and sound the trumpet , and tell the people :
DRA	Ezekiel	33	4	Then he that heareth the sound of the trumpet , whosoever he be , and doth not look to himself , if the sword come , and cut him off : his blood shall be upon his own head .
DRA	Ezekiel	33	5	He heard the sound of the trumpet and did not look to himself , his blood shall be upon him : but if he look to himself , he shall save his life .
DRA	Ezekiel	33	6	And if the watchman see the sword coming , and sound not the trumpet : and the people look not to themselves , and the sword come , and cut off a soul from among them : he indeed is taken away in his iniquity , but I will require his blood at the hand of the watchman .
DRA	Ezekiel	33	7	So thou , O son of man , I have made thee a watchman to the house of Israel : therefore thou shalt hear the word from my mouth , and shalt tell it them from me .
DRA	Ezekiel	33	8	When I say to the wicked : O wicked man , thou shalt surely die : if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked man from his way : that wicked man shall die in his iniquity , but I will require his blood at thy hand .
DRA	Ezekiel	33	9	But if thou tell the wicked man , that he may be converted from his ways , and he be not converted from his way : he shall die in his iniquity : but thou hast delivered thy soul .
DRA	Ezekiel	33	10	Thou therefore , O son of man , say to the house of Israel : Thus you have spoken , saying : Our iniquities , and our sins are upon us , and we pine away in them : how then can we live ?
DRA	Ezekiel	33	11	Say to them : As I live , saith the Lord God , I desire not the death of the wicked , but that the wicked turn from his way , and live . Turn ye , turn ye from your evil ways : and why will you die , O house of Israel ?
DRA	Ezekiel	33	12	Thou therefore , O son of man , say to the children of thy people : The justice of the just shall not deliver him , in what day soever he shall sin : and the wickedness of the wicked shall not hurt him , in what day soever he shall turn from his wickedness : and the just shall not be able to live in his justice , in what day soever he shall sin .
DRA	Ezekiel	33	13	Yea , if I shall say to the just that he shall surely live , and he , trusting in his justice , commit iniquity : all his justices shall be forgotten , and in his iniquity , which he hath committed , in the same shall he die .
DRA	Ezekiel	33	14	And if I shall say to the wicked : Thou shalt surely die : and he do penance for his sin , and do judgment and justice ,
DRA	Ezekiel	33	15	And if that wicked man restore the pledge , and render what he had robbed , and walk in the commandments of life , and do no unjust thing : he shall surely live , and shall not die .
DRA	Ezekiel	33	16	None of his sins , which he hath committed , shall be imputed to him : he hath done judgment and justice , he shall surely live .
DRA	Ezekiel	33	17	And the children of thy people have said : The way of the Lord is not equitable : whereas their own way is unjust .
DRA	Ezekiel	33	18	For when the just shall depart from his justice , and commit iniquities , he shall die in them .
DRA	Ezekiel	33	19	And when the wicked shall depart from his wickedness , and shall do judgments , and justice : he shall live in them .
DRA	Ezekiel	33	20	And you say : The way of the Lord is not right , I will judge every one of you according to his ways , O house of Israel .
DRA	Ezekiel	33	21	And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity , in the tenth month , in the fifth day of the month , that there came to me one that was fled from Jerusalem , saying : The city is laid waste .
DRA	Ezekiel	33	22	And the hand of the Lord had been upon me in the evening , before he that was fled came : and he opened my mouth till he came to me in the morning , and my mouth being opened , I was silent no more .
DRA	Ezekiel	33	23	And the word of the Lord came to me , saying :
DRA	Ezekiel	33	24	Son of man , they that dwell in these ruinous places in the land of Israel , speak , saying : Abraham was one , and he inherited the land , but we are many , the land is given us in possession .
DRA	Ezekiel	33	25	Therefore say to them : Thus saith the Lord God , You that eat with the blood and lift up your eyes to your uncleannesses , and that shed blood : shall you possess the land by inheritance ?
DRA	Ezekiel	33	26	You stood on your swords , you have committed abominations , and every one hath defiled his neighbour 's wife ; and shall you possess the land by inheritance ?
DRA	Ezekiel	33	27	Say thou thus to them : Thus saith the Lord God : As I live , they that dwell in the ruinous places , shall fall by the sword : and he that is in the field , shall be given to the beasts to be devoured : and they that are in holds , and caves , shall die of the pestilence .
DRA	Ezekiel	33	28	And I will make the land a wilderness , and a desert , and the proud strength thereof shall fail , and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate , because there is none to pass by them .
DRA	Ezekiel	33	29	And they shall know that I am the Lord , when I shall have made their land waste and desolate , for all their abominations which they have committed .
DRA	Ezekiel	33	30	And thou son of man : the children of thy people , that talk of thee by the walls , and in the doors of the houses , and speak one to another each man to his neighbour , saying : Come , and let us hear what is the word that cometh forth from the Lord .
DRA	Ezekiel	33	31	And they come to thee , as if a people were coming in , and my people sit before thee : and hear thy words , and do them not : for they turn them into a song of their mouth , and their heart goeth after their covetousness .
DRA	Ezekiel	33	32	And thou art to them as a musical song which is sung with a sweet and agreeable voice : and they hear thy words , and do them not .
DRA	Ezekiel	34	34	And the word of the Lord came to me , saying :
DRA	Ezekiel	34	1899	American Edition
DRA	Ezekiel	34	2	Son of man , prophesy concerning the shepherds of Israel : prophesy , and say to the shepherds : Thus saith the Lord God : Woe to the shepherds of Israel , that fed themselves : should not the flocks be fed by the shepherds ?
DRA	Ezekiel	34	3	You ate the milk , and you clothed yourselves with the wool , and you killed that which was fat : but my flock you did not feed .
DRA	Ezekiel	34	4	The weak you have not strengthened , and that which was sick you have not healed , that which was broken you have not bound up , and that which was driven away you have not brought again , neither have you sought that which was lost : but you ruled over them with rigour , and with a high hand .
DRA	Ezekiel	34	5	And my sheep were scattered , because there was no shepherd : and they became the prey of all the beasts of the field , and were scattered .
DRA	Ezekiel	34	6	My sheep have wandered in every mountain , and in every high hill : and my flocks were scattered upon the face of the earth , and there was none that sought them , there was none , I say , that sought them .
DRA	Ezekiel	34	7	Therefore , ye shepherds , hear the word of the Lord :
DRA	Ezekiel	34	8	As I live , saith the Lord God , forasmuch as my flocks have been made a spoil , and my sheep are become a prey to all the beasts of the field , because there was no shepherd : for my shepherds did not seek after my flock , but the shepherds fed themselves , and fed not my flocks :
DRA	Ezekiel	34	9	Therefore , ye shepherds , hear the word of the Lord :
DRA	Ezekiel	34	10	Thus saith the Lord God : Behold I myself come upon the shepherds , I will require my flock at their hand , and I will cause them to cease from feeding the flock any more , neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more : and I will deliver my flock from their mouth , and it shall no more be meat for them .
DRA	Ezekiel	34	11	For thus saith the Lord God : Behold I myself will seek my sheep , and will visit them .
DRA	Ezekiel	34	12	As the shepherd visiteth his flock in the day when he shall be in the midst of his sheep that were scattered , so will I visit my sheep , and will deliver them out of all the places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day .
DRA	Ezekiel	34	13	And I will bring them out from the peoples , and will gather them out of the countries , and will bring them to their own land : and I will feed them in the mountains of Israel , by the rivers , and in all the habitations of the land .
DRA	Ezekiel	34	14	I will feed them in the most fruitful pastures , and their pastures shall be in the high mountains of Israel : there shall they rest on the green grass , and be fed in fat pastures upon the mountains of Israel .
DRA	Ezekiel	34	15	I will feed my sheep : and I will cause them to lie down , saith the Lord God .
DRA	Ezekiel	34	16	I will seek that which was lost : and that which was driven away , I will bring again : and I will bind up that which was broken , and I will strengthen that which was weak , and that which was fat and strong I will preserve : and I will feed them in judgment .
DRA	Ezekiel	34	17	And as for you , O my flocks , thus saith the Lord God : Behold I judge between cattle and cattle , of rams and of he goats .
DRA	Ezekiel	34	18	Was it not enough for you to feed upon good pastures ? but you must also tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures : and when you drank the clearest water , you troubled the rest with your feet .
DRA	Ezekiel	34	19	And my sheep were fed with that which you had trodden with your feet : and they drank what your feet had troubled .
DRA	Ezekiel	34	20	Therefore thus saith the Lord God to you : Behold , I myself will judge between the fat cattle and the lean .
DRA	Ezekiel	34	21	Because you thrusted with sides and shoulders , and struck all the weak cattle with your horns , till they were scattered abroad :
DRA	Ezekiel	34	22	I will save my flock , and it shall be no more a spoil , and I will judge between cattle and cattle .
DRA	Ezekiel	34	23	AND I WILL SET UP ONE SHEPHERD OVER THEM , and he shall feed them , even my servant David : he shall feed them , and he shall be their shepherd .
DRA	Ezekiel	34	24	And I the Lord will be their God : and my servant David the prince in the midst of them : I the Lord have spoken it .
DRA	Ezekiel	34	25	And I will make a covenant of peace with them , and will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land : and they that dwell in the wilderness shall sleep secure in the forests .
DRA	Ezekiel	34	26	And I will make them a blessing round about my hill : and I will send down the rain in its season , there shall be showers of blessing .
DRA	Ezekiel	34	27	And the tree of the field shall yield its fruit , and the earth shall yield her increase , and they shall be in their land without fear : and they shall know that I am the Lord , when I shall have broken the bonds of their yoke , and shall have delivered them out of the hand of those that rule over them .
DRA	Ezekiel	34	28	And they shall be no more for a spoil to the nations , neither shall the beasts of the earth devour them : but they shall dwell securely without any terror .
DRA	Ezekiel	34	29	And I will raise up for them a bud of renown : and they shall be no more consumed with famine in the land , neither shall they bear any more the reproach of the Gentiles .
DRA	Ezekiel	34	30	And they shall know that I the Lord their God am with them , and that they are my people the house of Israel : saith the Lord God .

DRA	Ezekiel	35	1899	American Edition
DRA	Ezekiel	35	2	Son of man , set thy face against mount Seir , and prophesy concerning it , and say to it :
DRA	Ezekiel	35	3	Thus saith the Lord God : Behold I come against thee , mount Seir , and I will stretch forth my hand upon thee , and I will make thee desolate and waste .
DRA	Ezekiel	35	4	I will destroy thy cities , and thou shalt be desolate : and thou shalt know that I am the Lord .
DRA	Ezekiel	35	5	Because thou hast been an everlasting enemy , and hast shut up the children of Israel in the hands of the sword in the time of their affliction , in the time of their last iniquity .
DRA	Ezekiel	35	6	Therefore as I live , saith the Lord God , I will deliver thee up to blood , and blood shall pursue thee : and whereas thou hast hated blood , blood shall pursue thee .
DRA	Ezekiel	35	7	And I will make mount Seir waste and desolate : and I will take away from it him that goeth and him that returneth .
DRA	Ezekiel	35	8	And I will fill his mountains with his men that are slain : in thy hills , and in thy valleys , and in thy torrents they shall fall that are slain with the sword .
DRA	Ezekiel	35	9	I will make thee everlasting desolations , and thy cities shall not be inhabited : and thou shalt know that I am the Lord God .
DRA	Ezekiel	35	10	Because thou hast said : The two nations , and the two lands shall be mine , and I will possess them by inheritance : whereas the Lord was there .
DRA	Ezekiel	35	11	Therefore as I live , saith the Lord God , I will do according to thy wrath , and according to thy envy , which thou hast exercised in hatred to them : and I will be made known by them , when I shall have judged thee .
DRA	Ezekiel	35	12	And thou shalt know that I the Lord have heard all thy reproaches , that thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel , saying : They are desolate , they are given to us to consume .
DRA	Ezekiel	35	13	And you rose up against me with your mouth , and have derogated from me by your words : I have heard them .
DRA	Ezekiel	35	14	Thus saith the Lord God : When the whole earth shall rejoice , I will make thee a wilderness .
DRA	Ezekiel	35	15	As thou hast rejoiced over the inheritance of the house of Israel , because it was laid waste , so will I do to thee : thou shalt be laid waste , O mount Seir , and all Idumea : and they shall know that I am the Lord .

DRA	Ezekiel	36	1899	American Edition
DRA	Ezekiel	36	2	Thus saith the Lord God : Because the enemy hath said of you : Aha , the everlasting heights are given to us for an inheritance .
DRA	Ezekiel	36	3	Therefore prophesy , and say : Thus saith the Lord God : Because you have been desolate , and trodden under foot on every side , and made an inheritance to the rest of the nations , and are become the subject of the talk , and the reproach of the people :
DRA	Ezekiel	36	4	Therefore , ye mountains of Israel , hear the word of the Lord God : Thus saith the Lord God to the mountains , and to the hills , to the brooks , and to the valleys , and to desolate places , and ruinous walls , and to the cities that are forsaken , that are spoiled , and derided by the rest of the nations round about .
DRA	Ezekiel	36	5	Therefore thus saith the Lord God : In the fire of my zeal I have spoken of the rest of the nations , and of all Edom , who have taken my land to themselves , for an inheritance with joy , and with all the heart , and with the mind : and have cast it out to lay it waste .
DRA	Ezekiel	36	6	Prophesy therefore concerning the land of Israel , and say to the mountains , and to the hills , to the ridges , and to the valleys : Thus saith the Lord God : Behold I have spoken in my zeal , and in my indignation , because you have borne the shame of the Gentiles .

DRA	Ezekiel	36	16	And the word of the Lord came to me , saying :
DRA	Ezekiel	36	17	Son of man , when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land , they defiled it with their ways , and with their doings : their way was before me like the uncleanness of a menstruous woman .
DRA	Ezekiel	36	18	And I poured out my indignation upon them for the blood which they had shed upon the land , and with their idols they defiled it .
DRA	Ezekiel	36	19	And I scattered them among the nations , and they are dispersed through the countries : I have judged them according to their ways , and their devices .
DRA	Ezekiel	36	20	And when they entered among the nations whither they went , they profaned my holy name , when it was said of them : This is the people of the Lord , and they are come forth out of his land .
DRA	Ezekiel	36	21	And I have regarded my own holy name , which the house of Israel hath profaned among the nations to which they went in .
DRA	Ezekiel	36	22	Therefore thou shalt say to the house of Israel : Thus saith the Lord God : It is not for your sake that I will do this , O house of Israel , but for my holy name 's sake , which you have profaned among the nations whither you went .
DRA	Ezekiel	36	23	And I will sanctify my great name , which was profaned among the Gentiles , which you have profaned in the midst of them : that the Gentiles may know that I am the Lord , saith the Lord of hosts , when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes .

DRA	Daniel	1	1	In the third year of the reign of Joakim king of Juda , Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon came to Jerusalem , and besieged it .
DRA	Daniel	1	1899	American Edition
DRA	Daniel	1	2	And the Lord delivered into his hands Joakim the king of Juda , and part of the vessels of the house of God : and he carried them away into the land of Sennaar , to the house of his god , and the vessels he brought into the treasure house of his god .
DRA	Daniel	1	3	And the king spoke to Asphenez the master of the eunuchs , that he should bring in some of the children of Israel , and of the king 's seed and of the princes ,
DRA	Daniel	1	4	Children in whom there was no blemish , well favoured , and skillful in all wisdom , acute in knowledge , and instructed in science , and such as might stand in the king 's palace , that he might teach them the learning , and the tongue of the Chaldeans .
DRA	Daniel	1	5	And the king appointed them a daily provision , of his own meat , and of the wine of which he drank himself , that being nourished three years , afterwards they might stand before the king .
DRA	Daniel	1	6	Now there were among them of the children of Juda , Daniel , Ananias , Misael , and Azarias .
DRA	Daniel	1	7	And the master of the eunuchs gave them names : to Daniel , Baltassar : to Ananias , Sidrach : to Misael , Misach : and to Azarias , Abdenago .
DRA	Daniel	1	8	But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not be defiled with the king 's table , nor with the wine which he drank : and he requested the master of the eunuchs that he might not be defiled .
DRA	Daniel	1	9	And God gave to Daniel grace and mercy in the sight of the prince of the eunuchs .
DRA	Daniel	1	10	And the prince of the eunuchs said to Daniel : I fear my lord the king , who hath appointed you meat and drink : who if he should see your faces leaner than those of the other youths your equals , you shall endanger my head to the king .
DRA	Daniel	1	11	And Daniel said to Malasar , whom the prince of the eunuchs had appointed over Daniel , Ananias , Misael , and Azarias :
DRA	Daniel	1	12	Try , I beseech thee , thy servants for ten days , and let pulse be given us to eat , and water to drink :
DRA	Daniel	1	13	And look upon our faces , and the faces of the children that eat of the king 's meat : and as thou shalt see , deal with thy servants .
DRA	Daniel	1	14	And when he had heard these words , he tried them for ten days .
DRA	Daniel	1	15	And after ten days their faces appeared fairer and fatter than all the children that ate of the king 's meat .
DRA	Daniel	1	16	So Malasar took their portions , and the wine that they should drink : and he gave them pulse .
DRA	Daniel	1	17	And to these children God gave knowledge , and understanding in every book , and wisdom : but to Daniel the understanding also of all visions and dreams .
DRA	Daniel	1	18	And when the days were ended , after which the king had ordered they should be brought in : the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nabuchodonosor .
DRA	Daniel	1	19	And when the king had spoken to them , there were not found among them all such as Daniel , Ananias , Misael , and Azarias : and they stood in the king 's presence .
DRA	Daniel	1	20	And in all matters of wisdom and understanding , that the king inquired of them , he found them ten times better than all the diviners , and wise men , that were in all his kingdom .
DRA	Daniel	1	21	And Daniel continued even to the first year of king Cyrus . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Daniel	2	2	Then the king commanded to call together the diviners and the wise men , and the magicians , and the Chaldeans : to declare to the king his dreams : so they came and stood before the king .
DRA	Daniel	2	1899	American Edition
DRA	Daniel	2	3	And the king said to them : I saw a dream : and being troubled in mind I know not what I saw .
DRA	Daniel	2	4	And the Chaldeans answered the king in Syriac : O king , live for ever : tell to thy servants thy dream , and we will declare the interpretation thereof .
DRA	Daniel	2	5	And the king answering said to the Chaldeans : The thing is gone out of my mind : unless you tell me the dream , and the meaning thereof , you shall be put to death , and your houses shall be confiscated .
DRA	Daniel	2	6	But if you tell the dream , and the meaning of it , you shall receive of me rewards , and gifts , and great honour : therefore tell me the dream , and the interpretation thereof .
DRA	Daniel	2	7	They answered again and said : Let the king tell his servants the dream , and we will declare the interpretation of it .
DRA	Daniel	2	8	The king answered , and said : I know for certain that you seek to gain time , since you know that the thing is gone from me .
DRA	Daniel	2	9	If therefore you tell me not the dream , there is one sentence concerning you , that you have also framed a lying interpretation , and full of deceit , to speak before me till the time pass away . Tell me therefore the dream , that I may know that you also give a true interpretation thereof .
DRA	Daniel	2	10	Then the Chaldeans answered before the king , and said : There is no man upon earth , that can accomplish thy word , O king , neither doth any king , though great and mighty , ask such a thing of any diviner , or wise man , or Chaldean .
DRA	Daniel	2	11	For the thing that thou askest , O king , is difficult ; nor can any one be found that can shew it before the king , except the gods , whose conversation is not with men .
DRA	Daniel	2	12	Upon hearing this , the king in fury , and in great wrath , commanded that all the wise men of Babylon should be put to death .
DRA	Daniel	2	13	And the decree being gone forth , the wise men were slain : and Daniel and his companions were sought for , to be put to death .
DRA	Daniel	2	14	Then Daniel inquired concerning the law and the sentence , of Arioch the general of the king 's army , who was gone forth to kill the wise men of Babylon .
DRA	Daniel	2	15	And he asked him that had received the orders of the king , why so cruel a sentence was gone forth from the face of the king . And when Arioch had told the matter to Daniel ,
DRA	Daniel	2	16	Daniel went in and desired of the king , that he would give him time to resolve the question and declare it to the king .
DRA	Daniel	2	17	And he went into his house , and told the matter to Ananias , and Misael , and Azarias his companions :
DRA	Daniel	2	18	To the end that they should ask mercy at the face of the God of heaven concerning this secret , and that Daniel and his companions might not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon .
DRA	Daniel	2	19	Then was the mystery revealed to Daniel by a vision in the night : and Daniel blessed the God of heaven ,
DRA	Daniel	2	20	And speaking he said : Blessed be the name of the Lord from eternity and for evermore : for wisdom and fortitude are his .
DRA	Daniel	2	21	And he changeth times and ages : taketh away kingdoms and establisheth them , giveth wisdom to the wise , and knowledge to them that have understanding .
DRA	Daniel	2	22	He revealeth deep and hidden things , and knoweth what is in darkness : and light is with him .
DRA	Daniel	2	23	To thee , O God of our fathers , I give thanks , and I praise thee : because thou hast given me wisdom and strength : and now thou hast shewn me what we desired of thee , for thou hast made known to us , the king 's discourse .
DRA	Daniel	2	24	After this Daniel went in to Arioch , to whom the king had given orders to destroy the wise men of Babylon , and he spoke thus to him : Destroy not the wise men of Babylon : bring me in before the king , and I will tell the solution to the king .
DRA	Daniel	2	25	Then Arioch in haste brought in Daniel to the king , and said to him : I have found a man of the children of the captivity of Juda , that will resolve the question to the king .
DRA	Daniel	2	26	The king answered , and said to Daniel , whose name was Baltassar : Thinkest thou indeed that thou canst tell me the dream that I saw , and the interpretation thereof ?
DRA	Daniel	2	27	And Daniel made answer before the king , and said : The secret that the king desireth to know , none of the wise men , or the philosophers , or the diviners , or the soothsayers can declare to the king .
DRA	Daniel	2	28	But there is a God in heaven that revealeth mysteries , who hath shewn to thee , O king Nabuchodonosor , what is to come to pass in the latter times . Thy dream , and the visions of thy head upon thy bed , are these :
DRA	Daniel	2	29	Thou , O king , didst begin to think in thy bed , what should come to pass hereafter : and he that revealeth mysteries shewed thee what shall come to pass .
DRA	Daniel	2	30	To me also this secret is revealed , not by any wisdom that I have more than all men alive : but that the interpretation might be made manifest to the king , and thou mightest know the thoughts of thy mind .
DRA	Daniel	2	31	Thou , O king , sawest , and behold there was as it were a great statue : this statue , which was great and high , tall of stature , stood before thee , and the look thereof was terrible .
DRA	Daniel	2	32	The head of this statue was of fine gold , but the breast and the arms of silver , and the belly and the thighs of brass :
DRA	Daniel	2	33	And the legs of iron , the feet part of iron and part of clay .
DRA	Daniel	2	34	Thus thou sawest , till a stone was cut out of a mountain without hands : and it struck the statue upon the feet thereof that were of iron and of clay , and broke them in pieces .
DRA	Daniel	2	35	Then was the iron , the clay , the brass , the silver , and the gold broken to pieces together , and became like the chaff of a summer 's thrashingfloor , and they were carried away by the wind : and there was no place found for them : but the stone that struck the statue , became a great mountain , and filled the whole earth .
DRA	Daniel	2	36	This is the dream : we will also tell the interpretation thereof before thee , O king .
DRA	Daniel	2	37	Thou art a king of kings : and the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom , and strength , and power , and glory :
DRA	Daniel	2	38	And all places wherein the children of men , and the beasts of the field do dwell : he hath also given the birds of the air into thy hand , and hath put all things under thy power : thou therefore art the head of gold .
DRA	Daniel	2	39	And after thee shall rise up another kingdom , inferior to thee , of silver : and another third kingdom of brass , which shall rule over all the world .
DRA	Daniel	2	40	And the fourth kingdom shall be as iron . As iron breaketh into pieces , and subdueth all things , so shall that break and destroy all these .
DRA	Daniel	2	41	And whereas thou sawest the feet , and the toes , part of potter 's clay , and part of iron : the kingdom shall be divided , but yet it shall take its origin from the iron , according as thou sawest the iron mixed with the miry clay .
DRA	Daniel	2	42	And as the toes of the feet were part of iron , and part of clay , the kingdom shall be partly strong , and partly broken .
DRA	Daniel	2	43	And whereas thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay , they shall be mingled indeed together with the seed of man , but they shall not stick fast one to another , as iron can not be mixed with clay .
DRA	Daniel	2	44	But in the days of those kingdoms the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that shall never be destroyed , and his kingdom shall not be delivered up to another people , and it shall break in pieces , and shall consume all these kingdoms , and itself shall stand for ever .
DRA	Daniel	2	45	According as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands , and broke in pieces , the clay , and the iron , and the brass , and the silver , and the gold , the great God hath shewn the king what shall come to pass hereafter , and the dream is true , and the interpretation thereof is faithful .
DRA	Daniel	2	46	Then king Nabuchodonosor fell on his face , and worshipped Daniel , and commanded that they should offer in sacrifice to him victims and incense .
DRA	Daniel	2	47	And the king spoke to Daniel , and said : Verily your God is the God of gods , and Lord of kings , and a revealer of hidden things : seeing thou couldst discover this secret .
DRA	Daniel	2	48	Then the king advanced Daniel to a high station , and gave him many and great gifts : and he made him governor over all the provinces of Babylon , and chief of the magistrates over all the wise men of Babylon .
DRA	Daniel	2	49	And Daniel requested of the king , and he appointed Sidrach , Misach , and Abdenago over the works of the province of Babylon : but Daniel himself was in the king 's palace . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Daniel	3	3	Then the nobles , the magistrates , and the judges , the captains , and rulers , and the great men that were placed in authority , and all the princes of the provinces , were gathered together to come to the dedication of the statue , which king Nabuchodonosor had set up . And they stood before the statue which king Nabuchodonosor had set up .
DRA	Daniel	3	1899	American Edition
DRA	Daniel	3	2	Then Nabuchodonosor the king sent to call together the nobles , the magistrates , and the judges , the captains , the rulers , and governors , and all the chief men of the provinces , to come to the dedication of the statue which king Nabuchodonosor had set up .
DRA	Daniel	3	4	Then a herald cried with a strong voice : To you it is commanded , O nations , tribes , and languages :
DRA	Daniel	3	5	That in the hour that you shall hear the sound of the trumpet , and of the flute , and of the harp , of the sackbut , and of the psaltery , and of the symphony , and of all kind of music ; ye fall down and adore the golden statue which king Nabuchodonosor hath set up .
DRA	Daniel	3	6	But if any man shall not fall down and adore , he shall the same hour be cast into a furnace of burning fire .
DRA	Daniel	3	7	Upon this therefore , at the time when all the people heard the sound of the trumpet , the flute , and the harp , of the sackbut , and the psaltery , of the symphony , and of all kind of music : all the nations , tribes , and languages fell down and adored the golden statue which king Nabuchodonosor had set up .
DRA	Daniel	3	8	And presently at that very time some Chaldeans came and accused the Jews ,
DRA	Daniel	3	9	And said to king Nabuchodonosor : O king , live for ever :
DRA	Daniel	3	10	Thou , O king , hast made a decree that every man that shall hear the sound of the trumpet , the flute , and the harp , of the sackbut , and the psaltery , of the symphony , and of all kind of music , shall prostrate himself , and adore the golden statue :
DRA	Daniel	3	11	And that if any man shall not fall down and adore , he should be cast into a furnace of burning fire .
DRA	Daniel	3	12	Now there are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the works of the province of Babylon , Sidrach , Misach , and Abdenago : these men , O king , have slighted thy decree : they worship not thy gods , nor do they adore the golden statue which thou hast set up .
DRA	Daniel	3	13	Then Nabuchodonosor in fury , and in wrath , commanded that Sidrach , Misach , and Abdenago should be brought : who immediately were brought before the king .
DRA	Daniel	3	14	And Nabuchodonosor the king spoke to them , and said : Is it true , O Sidrach , Misach , and Abdenago , that you do not worship my gods , nor adore the golden statue that I have set up ?
DRA	Daniel	3	15	Now therefore if you be ready at what hour soever you shall hear the sound of the trumpet , flute , harp , sackbut , and psaltery , and symphony , and of all kind of music , prostrate yourselves , and adore the statue which I have made : but if you do not adore , you shall be cast the same hour into the furnace of burning fire : and who is the God that shall deliver you out of my hand ?
DRA	Daniel	3	16	Sidrach , Misach , and Abdenago answered and said to king Nabuchodonosor : We have no occasion to answer thee concerning this matter .
DRA	Daniel	3	17	For behold our God , whom we worship , is able to save us from the furnace of burning fire , and to deliver us out of thy hands , O king .
DRA	Daniel	3	18	But if he will not , be it known to thee , O king , that we will not worship thy gods , nor adore the golden statue which thou hast set up .
DRA	Daniel	3	19	Then was Nabuchodonosor filled with fury : and the countenance of his face was changed against Sidrach , Misach , and Abdenago , and he commanded that the furnace should be heated seven times more than it had been accustomed to be heated .
DRA	Daniel	3	20	And he commanded the strongest men that were in his army , to bind the feet of Sidrach , Misach , and Abdenago , and to cast them into the furnace of burning fire .
DRA	Daniel	3	21	And immediately these men were bound and were cast into the furnace of burning fire , with their coats , and their caps , and their shoes , and their garments .
DRA	Daniel	3	22	For the king 's commandment was urgent , and the furnace was heated exceedingly . And the flame of the fire slew those men that had cast in Sidrach , Misach , and Abdenago .
DRA	Daniel	3	23	But these three men , that is , Sidrach , Misach , and Abdenago , fell down bound in the midst of the furnace of burning fire .
DRA	Daniel	3	24	And they walked in the midst of the flame , praising God and blessing the Lord .
DRA	Daniel	3	25	Then Azarias standing up prayed in this manner , and opening his mouth in the midst of the fire , he said :
DRA	Daniel	3	26	Blessed art thou , O Lord , the God of our fathers , and thy name is worthy of praise , and glorious for ever :
DRA	Daniel	3	27	For thou art just in all that thou hast done to us , and all thy works are true , and thy ways right , and all thy judgments true .
DRA	Daniel	3	28	For thou hast executed true judgments in all the things that thou hast brought upon us , and upon Jerusalem the holy city of our fathers : for according to truth and judgment , thou hast brought all these things upon us for our sins .
DRA	Daniel	3	29	For we have sinned , and committed iniquity , departing from thee : and we have trespassed in all things :
DRA	Daniel	3	30	And we have not hearkened to thy commandments , nor have we observed nor done as thou hadst commanded us , that it might go well with us .
DRA	Daniel	3	31	Wherefore all that thou hast brought upon us , and every thing that thou hast done to us , thou hast done in true judgment :
DRA	Daniel	3	32	And thou hast delivered us into the hands of our enemies that are unjust , and most wicked , and prevaricators , and to a king unjust , and most wicked beyond all that are upon the earth .
DRA	Daniel	3	33	And now we can not open our mouths : we are become a shame and reproach to thy servants , and to them that worship thee .
DRA	Daniel	3	34	Deliver us not up for ever , we beseech thee , for thy name 's sake , and abolish not thy covenant .
DRA	Daniel	3	35	And take not away thy mercy from us for the sake of Abraham thy beloved , and Isaac thy servant , and Israel thy holy one :
DRA	Daniel	3	36	To whom thou hast spoken , promising that thou wouldst multiply their seed as the stars of heaven , and as the sand that is on the sea shore .
DRA	Daniel	3	37	For we , O Lord , are diminished more than any nation , and are brought low in all the earth this day for our sins .
DRA	Daniel	3	38	Neither is there at this time prince , or leader , or prophet , or holocaust , or sacrifice , or oblation , or incense , or place of firstfruits before thee ,
DRA	Daniel	3	39	That we may find thy mercy : nevertheless in a contrite heart and humble spirit let us be accepted .
DRA	Daniel	3	40	As in holocausts of rams , and bullocks , and as in thousands of fat lambs : so let our sacrifice be made in thy sight this day , that it may please thee : for there is no confusion to them that trust in thee .
DRA	Daniel	3	41	And now we follow thee with all our heart , and we fear thee , and seek thy face .
DRA	Daniel	3	42	Put us not to confusion , but deal . with us according to thy meekness , and according to the multitude of thy mercies .
DRA	Daniel	3	43	And deliver us according to thy wonderful works , and give glory to thy name , O Lord :
DRA	Daniel	3	44	And let all them be confounded that shew evils to thy servants , let them be confounded in all thy might , and let their strength be broken .
DRA	Daniel	3	45	And let them know that thou art the Lord , the only God , and glorious over all the world .
DRA	Daniel	3	46	Now the king 's servants that had cast them in , ceased not to heat the furnace with brimstone , and tow , and pitch , and dry sticks ,
DRA	Daniel	3	47	And the flame mounted up above the furnace nine and forty cubits :
DRA	Daniel	3	48	And it broke forth , and burnt such of the Chaldeans as it found near the furnace .
DRA	Daniel	3	49	But the angel of the Lord went down with Azarias and his companions into the furnace : and he drove the flame of the fire out of the furnace ,
DRA	Daniel	3	50	And made the midst of the furnace like the blowing of a wind bringing dew , and the fire touched them not at all , nor troubled them , nor did them any harm .
DRA	Daniel	3	51	Then these three as with one mouth praised , and glorified , and blessed God in the furnace , saying :
DRA	Daniel	3	52	Blessed art thou , O Lord the God of our fathers : and worthy to be praised , and glorified , and exalted above all for ever : and blessed is the holy name of thy glory : and worthy to be praised , and exalted above all in all ages .
DRA	Daniel	3	53	Blessed art thou in the holy temple of thy glory : and exceedingly to be praised , and exceeding glorious for ever .
DRA	Daniel	3	54	Blessed art thou on the throne of thy kingdom , and exceedingly to be praised , and exalted above all for ever .
DRA	Daniel	3	55	Blessed art thou , that beholdest the depths , and sittest upon the cherubims : and worthy to be praised and exalted above all for ever .

DRA	Daniel	3	88	O Ananias , Azarias , and Misael , bless ye the Lord : praise and exalt him above all for ever . For he hath delivered us from hell , and saved us out of the hand of death , and delivered us out of the midst of the burning flame , and saved us out of the midst of the fire .
DRA	Daniel	3	89	O give thanks to the Lord , because he is good : because his mercy endureth for ever and ever .
DRA	Daniel	3	90	O all ye religious , bless the Lord the God of gods : praise him and give him thanks , because his mercy endureth for ever and ever .
DRA	Daniel	3	91	Then Nabuchodonosor the king was astonished , and rose up in haste , and said to his nobles : Did we not cast three men bound into the midst of the fire ? They answered the king , and said : True , O king .
DRA	Daniel	3	92	He answered , and said : Behold I see four men loose , and walking in the midst of the fire , and there is no hurt in them , and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God .
DRA	Daniel	3	93	Then Nabuchodonosor came to the door of the burning fiery furnace , and said : Sidrach , Misach , and Abdenago , ye servants of the most high God , go ye forth , and come . And immediately Sidrach , Misach , and Abdenago went out from the midst of the fire .
DRA	Daniel	3	94	And the nobles , and the magistrates , and the judges , and the great men of the king being gathered together , considered these men , that the fire had no power on their bodies , and that not a hair of their head had been singed , nor their garments altered , nor the smell of the fire had passed on them .
DRA	Daniel	3	95	Then Nabuchodonosor breaking forth , said : Blessed be the God of them , to wit , of Sidrach , Misach , and Abdenago , who hath sent his angel , and delivered his servants that believed in him : and they changed the king 's word , and delivered up their bodies that they might not serve , nor adore any god , except their own God .
DRA	Daniel	3	96	By me therefore this decree is made , that every people , tribe , and tongue , which shall speak blasphemy against the God of Sidrach , Misach , and Abdenago , shall be destroyed , and their houses laid waste : for there is no other God that can save in this manner .
DRA	Daniel	3	97	Then the king promoted Sidrach , Misach , and Abdenago , in the province of Babylon .
DRA	Daniel	3	98	Nabuchodonosor the king , to all peoples , nations , and tongues , that dwell in all the earth , peace be multiplied unto you .

DRA	Daniel	4	2	I saw a dream that affrighted me : and my thoughts in my bed , and the visions of my head troubled me .
DRA	Daniel	4	3	Then I set forth a decree , that all the wise men of Babylon should be brought in before me , and that they should shew me the interpretation of the dream .
DRA	Daniel	4	5	Till their colleague Daniel came in before me , whose name is Baltassar , according to the name of my god , who hath in him the spirit of the holy gods : and I told the dream before him .
DRA	Daniel	4	6	Baltassar , prince of the diviners , because I know that thou hast in thee the spirit of the holy gods , and that no secret is impossible to thee : tell me the visions of my dreams that I have seen , and the interpretation of them .
DRA	Daniel	4	7	This was the vision of my head in my bed : I saw , and behold a tree in the midst of the earth , and the height thereof was exceeding great .
DRA	Daniel	4	8	The tree was great , and strong : and the height thereof reached unto heaven : the sight thereof was even to the ends of all the earth .
DRA	Daniel	4	9	Its leaves were most beautiful , and its fruit exceeding much : and in it was food for all : under it dwelt cattle , and beasts , and in the branches thereof the fowls of the air had their abode : and all flesh did eat of it .
DRA	Daniel	4	10	I saw in the vision of my head upon my bed , and behold a watcher , and a holy one came down from heaven .
DRA	Daniel	4	11	He cried aloud , and said thus : Cut down the tree , and chop off the branches thereof : shake off its leaves , and scatter its fruits : let the beasts fly away that are under it , and the birds from its branches .
DRA	Daniel	4	12	Nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth , and let it be tied with a band of iron , and of brass , among the grass , that is without , and let it be wet with the dew of heaven , and let its portion be with the wild beasts in the grass of the earth .
DRA	Daniel	4	13	Let his heart be changed from man 's , and let a beast 's heart be given him ; and let seven times pass over him .
DRA	Daniel	4	14	This is the decree by the sentence of the watchers , and the word and demand of the holy ones ; till the living know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men ; and he will give it to whomsoever it shall please him , and he will appoint the basest man over it .
DRA	Daniel	4	15	I king Nabuchodonosor saw this dream : thou , therefore , O Baltassar , tell me quickly the interpretation : for all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to declare the meaning of it to me : but thou art able , because the spirit of the holy gods is in thee .
DRA	Daniel	4	16	Then Daniel , whose name was Baltassar , began silently to think within himself for about one hour : and his thoughts troubled him . But the king answering , said : Baltassar , let not the dream and the interpretation thereof trouble thee . Baltassar answered , and said : My lord , the dream be to them that hate thee , and the interpretation thereof to thy enemies .
DRA	Daniel	4	17	The tree which thou sawest which was high and strong , whose height reached to the skies , and the sight thereof into all the earth :
DRA	Daniel	4	18	And the branches thereof were most beautiful , and its fruit exceeding much , and in it was food for all , under which the beasts of the field dwelt , and the birds of the air had their abode in its branches .
DRA	Daniel	4	19	It is thou , O king , who art grown great and become mighty : for thy greatness hath grown , and hath reached to heaven , and thy power unto the ends of the earth .
DRA	Daniel	4	20	And whereas the king saw a watcher , and a holy one come down from heaven , and say : Cut down the tree and destroy it , but leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth , and let it be bound with iron and brass among the grass without , and let it be sprinkled with the dew of heaven , and let his feeding be with the wild beasts , till seven times pass over him .
DRA	Daniel	4	21	This is the interpretation of the sentence of the most High , which is come upon my lord the king .
DRA	Daniel	4	22	They shall cast thee out from among men , and thy dwelling shall be with cattle and with wild beasts , and thou shalt eat grass as an ox , and shalt be wet with the dew of heaven : and seven times shall pass over thee , till thou know that the most High ruleth over the kingdom of men , and giveth it to whomsoever he will .
DRA	Daniel	4	23	But whereas he commanded , that the stump of the roots thereof , that is , of the tree , should be left : thy kingdom shall remain to thee after thou shalt have known that power is from heaven .
DRA	Daniel	4	24	Wherefore , O king , let my counsel be acceptable to thee , and redeem thou thy sins with alms , and thy iniquities with works of mercy to the poor : perhaps he will forgive thy offences .
DRA	Daniel	4	25	All these things came upon king Nabuchodonosor .
DRA	Daniel	4	26	At the end of twelve months he was walking in the palace of Babylon .
DRA	Daniel	4	27	And the king answered , and said : Is not this the great Babylon , which I have built to be the seat of the kingdom , by the strength of my power , and in the glory of my excellence ?
DRA	Daniel	4	28	And while the word was yet in the king 's mouth , a voice came down from heaven : To thee , O king Nabuchodonosor , it is said : Thy kingdom shall pass from thee ,
DRA	Daniel	4	29	And they shall cast thee out from among men , and thy dwelling shall be with cattle and wild beasts : thou shalt eat grass like an ox , and seven times shall pass over thee , till thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men , and giveth it to whomsoever he will .
DRA	Daniel	4	30	The same hour the word was fulfilled upon Nabuchodonosor , and he was driven away from among men , and did eat grass like an ox , and his body was wet with the dew of heaven : till his hairs grew like the feathers of eagles , and his nails like birds ' claws .
DRA	Daniel	4	31	Now at the end of the days , I Nabuchodonosor lifted up my eyes to heaven , and my sense was restored to me : and I blessed the most High , and I praised and glorified him that liveth for ever : for his power is an everlasting power , and his kingdom is to all generations .
DRA	Daniel	4	32	And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing before him : for he doth according to his will , as well with the powers of heaven , as among the inhabitants of the earth : and there is none that can resist his hand , and say to him : Why hast thou done it ?
DRA	Daniel	4	33	At the same time my sense returned to me , and I came to the honour and glory of my kingdom : and my shape returned to me : and my nobles , and my magistrates sought for me , and I was restored to my kingdom : and greater majesty was added to me .
DRA	Daniel	4	34	Therefore I Nabuchodonosor do now praise , and magnify , and glorify the King of heaven : because all his works are true , and his ways judgments , and them that walk in pride he is able to abase . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Daniel	5	5	In the same hour there appeared fingers , as it were of the hand of a man , writing over against the candlestick upon the surface of the wall of the king 's palace : and the king beheld the joints of the hand that wrote .
DRA	Daniel	5	1899	American Edition
DRA	Daniel	5	2	And being now drunk he commanded that they should bring the vessels of gold and silver which Nabuchodonosor his father had brought away out of the temple , that was in Jerusalem , that the king and his nobles , and his wives and his concubines , might drink in them .
DRA	Daniel	5	3	Then were the golden and silver vessels brought , which he had brought away out of the temple that was in Jerusalem : and the king and his nobles , his wives and his concubines , drank in them .
DRA	Daniel	5	4	They drank wine , and praised their gods of gold , and of silver , of brass , of iron , and of wood , and of stone .
DRA	Daniel	5	6	Then was the king 's countenance changed , and his thoughts troubled him : and the joints of his loins were loosed , and his knees struck one against the other .
DRA	Daniel	5	7	And the king cried out aloud to bring in the wise men , the Chaldeans , and the soothsayers . And the king spoke , and said to the wise men of Babylon : Whosoever shall read this writing , and shall make known to me the interpretation thereof , shall be clothed with purple , and shall have a golden chain on his neck , and shall be the third man in my kingdom .
DRA	Daniel	5	8	Then came in all the king 's wise men , but they could neither read the writing , nor declare the interpretation to the king .
DRA	Daniel	5	9	Wherewith king Baltasar was much troubled , and his countenance was changed : and his nobles also were troubled .
DRA	Daniel	5	10	Then the queen , on occasion of what had happened to the king , and his nobles , came into the banquet house : and she spoke and said : O king , live for ever : let not thy thoughts trouble thee , neither let thy countenance be changed .
DRA	Daniel	5	11	There is a man in thy kingdom that hath the spirit of the holy gods in him : and in the days of thy father knowledge and wisdom were found in him : for king Nabuchodonosor thy father appointed him prince of the wise men , enchanters , Chaldeans , and soothsayers , thy father , I say , O king :
DRA	Daniel	5	12	Because a greater spirit , and knowledge , and understanding , and interpretation of dreams , and shewing of secrets , and resolving of difficult things , were found in him , that is , in Daniel : whom the king named Baltassar . Now therefore let Daniel be called for , and he will tell the interpretation .
DRA	Daniel	5	13	Then Daniel was brought in before the king . And the king spoke , and said to him : Art thou Daniel of the children of the captivity of Juda , whom my father the king brought out of Judea ?
DRA	Daniel	5	14	I have heard of thee , that thou hast the spirit of the gods , and excellent knowledge , and understanding , and wisdom are found in thee .
DRA	Daniel	5	15	And now the wise men the magicians have come in before me , to read this writing , and shew me the interpretation thereof : and they could not declare to me the meaning of this writing .
DRA	Daniel	5	16	But I have heard of thee , that thou canst interpret obscure things , and resolve difficult things : now if thou art able to read the writing , and to shew me the interpretation thereof , thou shalt be clothed with purple , and shalt have a chain of gold about thy neck , and shalt be the third prince in my kingdom .
DRA	Daniel	5	17	To which Daniel made answer , and said before the king : Thy rewards be to thyself , and the gifts of thy house give to another : but the writing I will read to thee , O king , and shew thee the interpretation thereof .
DRA	Daniel	5	18	O king , the most high God gave to Nabuchodonosor thy father a kingdom , and greatness , and glory , and honour .
DRA	Daniel	5	19	And for the greatness that he gave to him , all people , tribes , and languages trembled , and were afraid of him : whom he would , he slew : and whom he would , he destroyed : and whom he would , he set up : and whom he would , he brought down .
DRA	Daniel	5	20	But when his heart was lifted up , and his spirit hardened unto pride , he was put down from the throne of his kingdom , and his glory was taken away .
DRA	Daniel	5	21	And he was driven out from the sons of men , and his heart was made like the beasts , and his dwelling was with the wild asses , and he did eat grass like an ox , and his body was wet with the dew of heaven : till he knew that the most High ruled in the kingdom of men , and that he will set over it whomsoever it shall please him .
DRA	Daniel	5	22	Thou also his son , O Baltasar , hast not humbled thy heart , whereas thou knewest all these things :
DRA	Daniel	5	23	But hast lifted thyself up against the Lord of heaven : and the vessels of his house have been brought before thee : and thou , and thy nobles , and thy wives , and thy concubines have drunk wine in them : and thou hast praised the gods of silver , and of gold , and of brass , of iron , and of wood , and of stone , that neither see , nor hear , nor feel : but the God who hath thy breath in his hand , and all thy ways , thou hast not glorified .
DRA	Daniel	5	24	Wherefore he hath sent the part of the hand which hath written this that is set down .
DRA	Daniel	5	25	And this is the writing that is written : MANE , THECEL , PHARES .
DRA	Daniel	5	26	And this is the interpretation of the word . MANE : God hath numbered thy kingdom , and hath finished it .
DRA	Daniel	5	27	THECEL : thou art weighed in the balance , and art found wanting .
DRA	Daniel	5	28	PHARES : thy kingdom is divided , and is given to the Medes and Persians .
DRA	Daniel	5	29	Then by the king 's command Daniel was clothed with purple , and a chain of gold was put about his neck : and it was proclaimed of him that he had power as the third man in the kingdom .
DRA	Daniel	5	30	The same night Baltasar the Chaldean king was slain .

DRA	Daniel	6	6	Then the princes , and the governors craftily suggested to the king , and spoke thus unto him : King Darius , live for ever :
DRA	Daniel	6	1899	American Edition
DRA	Daniel	6	2	And three princes over them , of whom Daniel was one : that the governors might give an account to them , and the king might have no trouble .
DRA	Daniel	6	3	And Daniel excelled all the princes , and governors : because a greater spirit of God was in him .
DRA	Daniel	6	4	And the king thought to set him over all the kingdom : whereupon the princes , and the governors sought to find occasion against Daniel with regard to the king : and they could find no cause , nor suspicion , because he was faithful , and no fault , nor suspicion was found in him .
DRA	Daniel	6	5	Then these men said : We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel , unless perhaps concerning the law of his God .
DRA	Daniel	6	7	All the princes of the kingdom , the magistrates , and governors , the senators , and judges have consulted together , that an imperial decree , and an edict be published : That whosoever shall ask any petition of any god , or man , for thirty days , but of thee , O king , shall be cast into the den of lions .
DRA	Daniel	6	8	Now , therefore , O king , confirm the sentence , and sign the decree : that what is decreed by the Medes and Persians may not be altered , nor any man be allowed to transgress it .
DRA	Daniel	6	9	So king Darius set forth the decree , and established it .
DRA	Daniel	6	10	Now when Daniel knew this , that is to say , that the law was made , he went into his house : and opening the windows in his upper chamber towards Jerusalem , he knelt down three times a day , and adored , and gave thanks before his God , as he had been accustomed to do before .
DRA	Daniel	6	11	Wherefore those men carefully watching him , found Daniel praying and making supplication to his God .
DRA	Daniel	6	12	And they came and spoke to the king concerning the edict : O king , hast thou not decreed , that every man that should make a request to any of the gods , or men , for thirty days , but to thyself , O king , should be cast into the den of the lions ? And the king answered them , saying : The word is true according to the decree of the Medes and Persians , which it is not lawful to violate .
DRA	Daniel	6	13	Then they answered , and said before the king : Daniel , who is of the children of the captivity of Juda , hath not regarded thy law , nor the decree that thou hast made : but three times a day he maketh his prayer .
DRA	Daniel	6	14	Now when the king had heard these words , he was very much grieved , and in behalf of Daniel he set his heart to deliver him and even till sunset he laboured to save him .
DRA	Daniel	6	15	But those men perceiving the king 's design , said to him : Know thou , O king , that the law of the Medes and Persians is , that no decree which the king hath made , may be altered .
DRA	Daniel	6	16	Then the king commanded , and they brought Daniel , and cast him into the den of the lions . And the king said to Daniel : Thy God , whom thou always servest , he will deliver thee .
DRA	Daniel	6	17	And a stone was brought , and laid upon the mouth of the den : which the king sealed with his own ring , and with the ring of his nobles , that nothing should be done against Daniel .
DRA	Daniel	6	18	And the king went away to his house and laid himself down without taking supper , and meat was not set before him , and even sleep departed from him .
DRA	Daniel	6	19	Then the king rising very early in the morning , went in haste to the lions ' den :
DRA	Daniel	6	20	And coming near to the den , cried with a lamentable voice to Daniel , and said to him : Daniel , servant of the living God , hath thy God , whom thou servest always , been able , thinkest thou , to deliver thee from the lions ?
DRA	Daniel	6	21	And Daniel answering the king , said : O king , live for ever :
DRA	Daniel	6	22	My God hath sent his angel , and hath shut up the mouths of the lions , and they have not hurt me : forasmuch as before him justice hath been found in me : yea and before thee , O king , I have done no offence .
DRA	Daniel	6	23	Then was the king exceeding glad for him , and he commanded that Daniel should be taken out of the den : and Daniel was taken out of the den , and no hurt was found in him , because he believed in his God .
DRA	Daniel	6	24	And by the king 's commandment , those men were brought that had accused Daniel : and they were cast into the lions ' den , they and their children , and their wives : and they did not reach the bottom of the den , before the lions caught them , and broke all their bones in pieces .
DRA	Daniel	6	25	Then king Darius wrote to all people , tribes , and languages , dwelling in the whole earth : PEACE be multiplied unto you .
DRA	Daniel	6	26	It is decreed by me , that in all my empire and my kingdom all men dread and fear the God of Daniel . For he is the living and eternal God for ever : and his kingdom shall not be destroyed , and his power shall be for ever .
DRA	Daniel	6	27	He is the deliverer , and saviour , doing signs and wonders in heaven , and in earth : who hath delivered Daniel out of the lions ' den .

DRA	Daniel	7	7	After this I beheld in the vision of the night , and lo , a fourth beast , terrible and wonderful , and exceeding strong , it had great iron teeth , eating and breaking in pieces , and treading down the rest with its feet : and it was unlike to the other beasts which I had seen before it , and had ten horns .
DRA	Daniel	7	1899	American Edition
DRA	Daniel	7	2	I saw in my vision by night , and behold the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea .
DRA	Daniel	7	3	And four great beasts , different one from another , came up out of the sea .
DRA	Daniel	7	4	The first was like a lioness , and had the wings of an eagle : I beheld till her wings were plucked off , and she was lifted up from the earth , and stood upon her feet as a man , and the heart of a man was given to her .
DRA	Daniel	7	5	And behold another beast like a bear stood up on one side : and there were three rows in the mouth thereof , and in the teeth thereof , and thus they said to it : Arise , devour much flesh .
DRA	Daniel	7	6	After this I beheld , and lo , another like a leopard , and it had upon it four wings as of a fowl , and the beast had four heads , and power was given to it .
DRA	Daniel	7	8	I considered the horns , and behold another little horn sprung out of the midst of them : and three of the first horns were plucked up at the presence thereof : and behold eyes like the eyes of a man were in this horn , and a mouth speaking great things .
DRA	Daniel	7	9	I beheld till thrones were placed , and the Ancient of days sat : his garment was white as snow , and the hair of his head like clean wool : his throne like flames of fire : the wheels of it like a burning fire .
DRA	Daniel	7	10	A swift stream of fire issued forth from before him : thousands of thousands ministered to him , and ten thousand times a hundred thousand stood before him : the judgment sat , and the books were opened .
DRA	Daniel	7	11	I beheld because of the voice of the great words which that horn spoke : and I saw that the beast was slain , and the body thereof was destroyed , and given to the fire to be burnt :
DRA	Daniel	7	12	And that the power of the other beasts was taken away : and that times of life were appointed them for a time , and a time .
DRA	Daniel	7	13	I beheld therefore in the vision of the night , and lo , one like the son of man came with the clouds of heaven , and he came even to the Ancient of days : and they presented him before him .
DRA	Daniel	7	14	And he gave him power , and glory , and a kingdom : and all peoples , tribes and tongues shall serve him : his power is an everlasting power that shall not be taken away : and his kingdom that shall not be destroyed .
DRA	Daniel	7	15	My spirit trembled , I Daniel was affrighted at these things , and the visions of my head troubled me .
DRA	Daniel	7	16	I went near to one of them that stood by , and asked the truth of him concerning all these things , and he told me the interpretation of the words , and instructed me :
DRA	Daniel	7	17	These four great beasts are four kingdoms , which shall arise out of the earth .
DRA	Daniel	7	18	But the saints of the most high God shall take the kingdom : and they shall possess the kingdom for ever and ever .
DRA	Daniel	7	19	After this I would diligently learn concerning the fourth beast , which was very different from all , and exceeding terrible : his teeth and claws were of iron : he devoured and broke in pieces , and the rest he stamped upon with his feet :
DRA	Daniel	7	20	And concerning the ten horns that he had on his head : and concerning the other that came up , before which three horns fell : and of that horn that had eyes , and a mouth speaking great things , and was greater than the rest .
DRA	Daniel	7	21	I beheld , and lo , that horn made war against the saints , and prevailed over them ,
DRA	Daniel	7	22	Till the Ancient of days came and gave judgment to the saints of the most High , and the time came , and the saints obtained the kingdom .
DRA	Daniel	7	23	And thus he said : The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth , which shall be greater than all the kingdoms , and shall devour the whole earth , and shall tread it down , and break it in pieces .
DRA	Daniel	7	24	And the ten horns of the same kingdom , shall be ten kings : and another shall rise up after them , and he shall be mightier than the former , and he shall bring down three kings .
DRA	Daniel	7	25	And he shall speak words against the High One , and shall crush the saints of the most High : and he shall think himself able to change times and laws , and they shall be delivered into his hand until a time , and times , and half a time .
DRA	Daniel	7	26	And judgment shall sit , that his power may be taken away , and be broken in pieces , and perish even to the end .
DRA	Daniel	7	27	And that the kingdom , and power , and the greatness of the kingdom , under the whole heaven , may be given to the people of the saints of the most High : whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom , and all kings shall serve him , and shall obey him .
DRA	Daniel	7	28	Hitherto is the end of the word . I Daniel was much troubled with my thoughts , and my countenance was changed in me : but I kept the word in my heart . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Daniel	8	8	And the he goat became exceeding great : and when he was grown , the great horn was broken , and there came up four horns under it towards the four winds of heaven .
DRA	Daniel	8	1899	American Edition
DRA	Daniel	8	2	Saw in my vision when I was in the castle of Susa , which is in the province of Elam : and I saw in the vision that I was over the gate of Ulai .
DRA	Daniel	8	3	And I lifted up my eyes , and saw : and behold a ram stood before the water , having two high horns , and one higher than the other , and growing up .
DRA	Daniel	8	4	Afterward I saw the ram pushing with his horns against the west , and against the north , and against the south : and no beasts could withstand him , nor be delivered out of his hand : and he did according to his own will , and became great .
DRA	Daniel	8	5	And I understood : and behold a he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth , and he touched not the ground , and the he goat had a notable horn between his eyes .
DRA	Daniel	8	6	And he went up to the ram that had the horns , which I had seen standing before the gate , and he ran towards him in the force of his strength .
DRA	Daniel	8	7	And when he was come near the ram , he was enraged against him , and struck the ram : and broke his two horns , and the ram could not withstand him : and when he had cast him down on the ground , he stamped upon him , and none could deliver the ram out of his hand .
DRA	Daniel	8	9	And out of one of them came forth a little horn : and it became great against the south , and against the east , and against the strength .
DRA	Daniel	8	10	And it was magnified even unto the strength of heaven : and it threw down of the strength , and of the stars , and trod upon them .
DRA	Daniel	8	11	And it was magnified even to the prince of the strength : and it took away from him the continual sacrifice , and cast down the place of his sanctuary .
DRA	Daniel	8	12	And strength was given him against the continual sacrifice , because of sins : and truth shall be cast down on the ground , and he shall do and shall prosper .
DRA	Daniel	8	13	And I heard one of the saints speaking , and one saint said to another , I know not to whom that was speaking : How long shall be the vision , concerning the continual sacrifice , and the sin of the desolation that is made : and the sanctuary , and the strength be trodden under foot ?
DRA	Daniel	8	14	And he said to him : Unto evening and morning two thousand three hundred days : and the sanctuary shall be cleansed .
DRA	Daniel	8	15	And it came to pass when I Daniel saw the vision , and sought the meaning , that behold there stood before me as it were the appearance of a man .
DRA	Daniel	8	16	And I heard the voice of a man between Ulai : and he called , and said : Gabriel , make this man to understand the vision .
DRA	Daniel	8	17	And he came and stood near where I stood : and when he was come , I fell on my face trembling , and he said to me : Understand , O son of man , for in the time of the end the vision shall be fulfilled .
DRA	Daniel	8	18	And when he spoke to me I fell flat on the ground : and he touched me , and set me upright ,
DRA	Daniel	8	19	And he said to me : I will shew thee what things are to come to pass in the end of the malediction : for the time hath its end .
DRA	Daniel	8	20	The ram , which thou sawest with horns , is the king of the Medes and Persians .
DRA	Daniel	8	21	And the he goat , is the king of the Greeks , and the great horn that was between his eyes , the same is the first king .
DRA	Daniel	8	22	But whereas when that was broken , there arose up four for it : four kings shall rise up of his nation , but not with his strength .
DRA	Daniel	8	23	And after their reign , when iniquities shall be grown up , there shall arise a king of a shameless face , and understanding dark sentences .
DRA	Daniel	8	24	And his power shall be strengthened , but not by his own force : and he shall lay all things waste , and shall prosper , and do more than can be believed . And he shall destroy the mighty , and the people of the saints ,
DRA	Daniel	8	25	According to his will , and craft shall be successful in his hand : and his heart shall be puffed up , and in the abundance of all things he shall kill many : and he shall rise up against the prince of princes , and shall be broken without hand .
DRA	Daniel	8	26	And the vision of the evening and the morning , which was told , is true : thou therefore seal up the vision , because it shall come to pass after many days .
DRA	Daniel	8	27	And I Daniel languished , and was sick for some days : and when I was risen up , I did the king 's business , and I was astonished at the vision , and there was none that could interpret it . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Daniel	9	9	But to thee , the Lord our God , mercy and forgiveness , for we have departed from thee :
DRA	Daniel	9	1899	American Edition
DRA	Daniel	9	2	The first year of his reign , I Daniel understood by books the number of the years , concerning which the word of the Lord came to Jeremias the prophet , that seventy years should be accomplished of the desolation of Jerusalem .
DRA	Daniel	9	3	And I set my face to the Lord my God , to pray and make supplication with fasting , and sackcloth , and ashes .
DRA	Daniel	9	4	And I prayed to the Lord my God , and I made my confession , and said : I beseech thee , O Lord God , great and terrible , who keepest the covenant , and mercy to them that love thee , and keep thy commandments .
DRA	Daniel	9	5	We have sinned , we have committed iniquity , we have done wickedly , and have revolted : and we have gone aside from thy commandments , and thy judgments .
DRA	Daniel	9	6	We have not hearkened to thy servants the prophets , that have spoken in thy name to our kings , to our princes , to our fathers , and to all the people of the land .
DRA	Daniel	9	7	To thee , O Lord , justice : but to us confusion of face , as at this day to the men of Juda , and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem , and to all Israel to them that are near , and to them that are far off in all the countries whither thou hast driven them , for their iniquities by which they have sinned against thee .
DRA	Daniel	9	8	O Lord , to us belongeth confusion of face , to our princes , and to our fathers that have sinned .
DRA	Daniel	9	10	And we have not hearkened to the voice of the Lord our God , to walk in his law , which he set before us by his servants the prophets .
DRA	Daniel	9	11	And all Israel have transgressed thy law , and have turned away from hearing thy voice , and the malediction , and the curse , which is written in the book of Moses the servant of God , is fallen upon us , because we have sinned against him .
DRA	Daniel	9	12	And he hath confirmed his words which he spoke against us , and against our princes that judged us , that he would bring in upon us a great evil , such as never was under all the heaven , according to that which hath been done in Jerusalem .
DRA	Daniel	9	13	As it is written in the law of Moses , all this evil is come upon us : and we entreated not thy face , O Lord our God , that we might turn from our iniquities , and think on thy truth .
DRA	Daniel	9	14	And the Lord hath watched upon the evil , and hath brought it upon us : the Lord our God is just in all his works which he hath done : for we have not hearkened to his voice .
DRA	Daniel	9	15	And now , O Lord our God , who hast brought forth thy people out of the land of Egypt with a strong hand , and hast made thee a name as at this day : we have sinned , we have committed iniquity ,
DRA	Daniel	9	16	O Lord , against all thy justice : let thy wrath and thy indignation be turned away , I beseech thee , from thy city Jerusalem , and from thy holy mountain .
