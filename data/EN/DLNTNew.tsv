DLNT	Matthew	6	6	But whenever you pray , enter into your inner-room , and having shut your door , pray to your Father , the One in secret . And your Father , the One seeing in secret , will reward you . Don ’ t Babble On In Prayer . Pray As a Child of God , Aligned With His Purposes
DLNT	Matthew	6	2	“ So whenever you do almsgiving [ c ] , do not trumpet it before you as-indeed the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the lanes [ d ] so that they may be glorified by people . Truly I say to you , they are receiving their reward [ e ] in full .
DLNT	Matthew	6	3	But while you are doing almsgiving , do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing ,
DLNT	Matthew	6	4	so that your almsgiving may be in secret . And your Father , the One seeing in secret , will reward you . Don ’ t Pray To Impress Others . Always Pray As If Alone With Your Heavenly Father
DLNT	Matthew	6	5	“ And whenever you pray , do not be like the hypocrites . Because standing in the synagogues and on the corners of the wide-roads , they love to pray so that they may make-an-appearance [ f ] to people . Truly I say to you , they are receiving their reward in full .
DLNT	Matthew	6	7	“ And while praying , do not babble as-indeed the Gentiles do . For they are thinking that they will be heard by means of their many-words [ g ] .
DLNT	Matthew	6	8	So do not be like them , for your Father knows of the things which you have a need before you ask Him .
DLNT	Matthew	6	9	Therefore , you be praying as follows , ‘ Our Father in the heavens :
DLNT	Matthew	6	10	let [ h ] Your name be treated-as-holy . Let Your kingdom come . Let Your will be done [ i ] — as in heaven , also on earth .
DLNT	Matthew	6	11	Give us today our daily bread .
DLNT	Matthew	6	12	And forgive us our debts , as we also forgave [ j ] our debtors .
DLNT	Matthew	6	13	And do not bring us into a temptation [ k ] , but deliver [ l ] us from the evil one [ m ] ’ .

DLNT	Matthew	6	16	“ And whenever you fast , do not be like the sad-faced hypocrites . For they disfigure [ n ] their faces so that they may appear to people as ones fasting . Truly I say to you , they are receiving their reward in full .

DLNT	Matthew	6	20	But be treasuring up treasures for yourselves in heaven , where neither moth nor eating destroys , and where thieves do not break in nor steal . Your Heart Will Be Where Your Treasure Is . You Can not Serve God And Money
DLNT	Matthew	6	21	“ For where your treasure is , there your heart also will be .
DLNT	Matthew	6	22	The lamp [ p ] of the body is the eye . Therefore if your eye is single [ q ] , your whole body will be full-of-light [ r ] .

DLNT	Matthew	6	24	No one can be serving [ u ] two masters . For either he will hate the one and love the other , or he will be devoted-to one and disregard [ v ] the other . You can not be serving God and wealth [ w ] . Don ’ t Be Anxious About Your Earthly Life . Seek God ’ s Kingdom And Righteousness
DLNT	Matthew	6	25	“ For this reason I say to you— do not be anxious [ x ] for your life as to what you may eat or what you may drink , nor for your body as to what you may put-on . Is not life more than food , and the body more than clothing ?
DLNT	Matthew	6	26	Look at the birds of the heaven— that they do not sow , nor reap , nor gather into barns . And your heavenly Father feeds them . Are you not worth more than they ?
DLNT	Matthew	6	27	And which of you while being anxious is able to add one cubit [ y ] upon his life-span ?
DLNT	Matthew	6	28	And why are you anxious about clothing ? Observe-closely the lilies of the field , how they grow— they do not labor nor spin .
DLNT	Matthew	6	29	But I say to you that not even Solomon in all his glory clothed himself like one of these .
DLNT	Matthew	6	30	But if God dresses in this manner the grass of the field existing today and being thrown into an oven tomorrow , will He not by much more care for you— ones of-little-faith ?
DLNT	Matthew	6	31	Therefore , do not be anxious [ z ] , saying , ‘ What may we eat ? ’ or ‘ What may we drink ? ’ or ‘ What may we put-on ? ’
DLNT	Matthew	6	32	For the Gentiles are seeking-after all these things . For your heavenly Father knows that you have need of all these things .
DLNT	Matthew	6	33	But be seeking first the kingdom of God and His righteousness , and all these things will be added to you .

DLNT	Matthew	10	16	“ Behold— I am sending [ j ] you out as sheep in the midst of wolves . Therefore be shrewd [ k ] as the snakes , and innocent [ l ] as the doves .
DLNT	Matthew	10	17	And beware of people . For they will hand you over to councils [ m ] and whip you in their synagogues .
DLNT	Matthew	10	18	And you will even be brought before governors and kings for My sake— for a testimony to them [ n ] and to the Gentiles .
DLNT	Matthew	10	19	But whenever they hand you over , do not be anxious-about how or what you should speak . For what you should speak will be given to you in that hour .
DLNT	Matthew	10	20	For you are not the ones speaking , but the Spirit of your Father is the One speaking in you .
DLNT	Matthew	10	21	And brother will hand-over brother to death , and a father his child . And children will rise-up-in-rebellion [ o ] against parents and they will put them to death .

DLNT	Matthew	10	24	“ A disciple [ r ] is not above the teacher , nor is a slave above his master .
DLNT	Matthew	10	25	It is enough for the disciple that he become like his teacher , and the slave like his master . If they called the Household-Master [ s ] Beelzebul [ t ] , how much more His household-members !
DLNT	Matthew	10	26	So do not fear [ u ] them . For nothing has been covered which will not be revealed , and is secret which will not be known .
DLNT	Matthew	10	27	What I am saying to you in the darkness , speak in the light . And what you are hearing in your ear , proclaim upon the housetops .
DLNT	Matthew	10	28	And do not be fearing [ v ] anything from the ones killing the body but not being able to kill the soul . But be fearing instead the One being able to destroy both soul and body in Gehenna [ w ] .
DLNT	Matthew	10	29	Are not two sparrows sold for an assarion [ x ] ? And one of them will not fall on the ground apart from [ y ] your Father .

DLNT	Matthew	10	31	So do not be fearing . You are more valuable than many sparrows . Jesus Instructs Them About His Mission : I Came To Divide The World Over Myself
DLNT	Matthew	10	32	“ Everyone therefore who will confess Me in front of people , I also will confess him in front of My Father in the heavens .
DLNT	Matthew	10	33	But whoever denies [ z ] Me in front of people , I also will deny him in front of My Father in the heavens .
DLNT	Matthew	10	34	Do not suppose that I came to cast peace over the earth . I did not come to cast peace , but a sword .
DLNT	Matthew	10	35	For I came to cause-a-separation [ aa ] — a man against his father , and a daughter against her mother , and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law .
DLNT	Matthew	10	36	And the enemies of the person will be his household-members .

DLNT	Matthew	11	11	Truly I say to you , a greater [ g ] one than John the Baptist has not arisen among ones born of women . But the least [ h ] one in the kingdom of the heavens is greater [ i ] than he .
DLNT	Matthew	11	2	Now John [ a ] , having in prison heard-of the works of the Christ , having sent through his disciples ,
DLNT	Matthew	11	3	said to Him , “ Are You the One coming [ b ] , or should we be looking-for a different one ? ”
DLNT	Matthew	11	4	And having responded , Jesus said to them , “ Having gone , report to John the things which you are hearing and seeing [ c ] —
DLNT	Matthew	11	5	blind ones are seeing-again and lame ones are walking . Lepers are being cleansed and deaf ones are hearing . And dead ones are being raised and poor ones are having-good-news-announced [ d ] to them .
DLNT	Matthew	11	6	And blessed is whoever does not take-offense [ e ] in Me ” . Jesus Says John The Baptist Is The Fulfillment of The Prophecies of Malachi
DLNT	Matthew	11	7	And while these ones were proceeding , Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John— “ What [ f ] did you go out into the wilderness to look-at ? A reed being shaken by the wind ?
DLNT	Matthew	11	8	But what did you go out to see ? A man having been dressed in soft garments ? Behold— the ones wearing the soft garments are in the houses of kings !
DLNT	Matthew	11	9	But what did you go out to see ? A prophet ? Yes , I say to you , and more than a prophet .
DLNT	Matthew	11	10	This one is about whom it has been written [ in Mal 3:1 ] : ‘ Behold— I am sending-forth My messenger ahead of Your presence , who will make Your way ready in front of You ’ .
DLNT	Matthew	11	12	But the kingdom of the heavens is being treated-violently [ j ] from the days of John the Baptist until now , and violent ones are snatching it away .
DLNT	Matthew	11	13	For all the prophets and the Law prophesied until John .
DLNT	Matthew	11	14	And if you are willing to accept it , he himself is Elijah— the one going-to [ k ] come .
DLNT	Matthew	11	15	Let the one having ears hear [ l ] . But This Generation Rejects Both The One Preparing And The One Who Came
DLNT	Matthew	11	16	“ But to what will I liken this generation ? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces who , calling to the others ,
DLNT	Matthew	11	17	say ‘ We played the flute for you and you did not dance . We lamented [ m ] and you did not beat-your-breast [ n ] ’ .
DLNT	Matthew	11	18	For John came neither eating nor drinking [ o ] , and they say ‘ He has a demon ’ .
DLNT	Matthew	11	19	The Son of Man came eating and drinking , and they say ‘ Behold— a man who is a glutton and drunkard [ p ] , a friend of tax-collectors and sinners ’ . And wisdom was vindicated [ q ] by her works [ r ] ” . Woe To You Cities Who Have Seen My Works And Not Repented
DLNT	Matthew	11	20	Then He began to reproach [ s ] the cities in which most-of [ t ] His miracles took place , because they did not repent .
DLNT	Matthew	11	21	“ Woe to you , Chorazin ! Woe to you , Bethsaida ! Because if the miracles having taken place in you had taken place in Tyre and Sidon , they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes .
DLNT	Matthew	11	22	Nevertheless [ u ] I say to you— it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you .
DLNT	Matthew	11	23	And you , Capernaum , will you be exalted up to heaven ? You will go-down as far as Hades . Because if the miracles having taken place in you had been done in Sodom , it would have remained until today .
DLNT	Matthew	11	24	Nevertheless I say to you that it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom on the day of judgment than for you ” . It Pleases God To Hide The Kingdom From The Wise And Reveal It To The Childlike
DLNT	Matthew	11	25	At that time , having responded , Jesus said , “ I praise You , Father , Lord of heaven and earth , that [ v ] You hid these things from wise ones and intelligent ones , and You revealed them to children [ w ] .
DLNT	Matthew	11	26	Yes , Father , because [ x ] in-this-manner it became well-pleasing in Your sight .
DLNT	Matthew	11	27	All things were handed-over to Me by My Father . And no one knows [ y ] the Son except the Father . Nor does anyone know the Father except the Son , and anyone to whom [ z ] the Son wills [ aa ] to reveal Him .
DLNT	Matthew	11	28	Come to Me , all the ones being weary and having been burdened [ ab ] , and I will give you rest .
DLNT	Matthew	11	29	Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me , because I am gentle and humble in heart , and you will find rest for your souls .
DLNT	Matthew	11	30	For My yoke is easy [ ac ] , and My burden [ ad ] is light ” . Footnotes - Matthew 11:2 Matthew now uses John to ‘ prepare the way ’ again by asking the key question , Are You the One ?

DLNT	Matthew	12	12	How much then is a person more-valuable than a sheep ! So then , it is lawful to be acting commendably [ f ] on the Sabbath ” .
DLNT	Matthew	12	2	And the Pharisees , having seen it , said to Him , “ Behold— Your disciples are doing what is not lawful to be doing on a Sabbath ” .
DLNT	Matthew	12	3	And the One said to them , “ Did you not read [ in
DLNT	Matthew	12	1	Sam 21:1-6 ] what David did when he was hungry , and the ones with him—
DLNT	Matthew	12	4	how he entered into the house of God and they ate the Bread of Presentation [ b ] which it was not lawful for him to eat , nor for the ones with him , but for the priests alone ?
DLNT	Matthew	12	5	Or did you not read in the Law that on the Sabbaths , the priests in the temple profane [ c ] the Sabbath and are guiltless [ d ] ?
DLNT	Matthew	12	6	But I say to you that a greater-thing than the temple is here .
DLNT	Matthew	12	7	But if you had known what it means [ in Hos 6:6 ] — ‘ I desire mercy , and not a sacrifice ’ — you would not have condemned the guiltless ones .
DLNT	Matthew	12	8	For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath [ e ] ” . Jesus Deliberately Heals a Man On The Sabbath , Inflaming The Pharisees
DLNT	Matthew	12	9	And having passed-on from there , He went into their synagogue .
DLNT	Matthew	12	10	And behold— there was a man having a withered hand . And they questioned Him , saying , ‘ Is it lawful to cure on the Sabbath ? ’ — in order that they might accuse Him .
DLNT	Matthew	12	11	And the One said to them , “ What person will there be from-among you who will have one sheep , and if this sheep falls into a pit on the Sabbath , will not take hold of it and raise it ?
DLNT	Matthew	12	13	Then He says to the man , “ Stretch-out your hand ” . And he stretched it out , and it was restored , healthy like the other .
DLNT	Matthew	12	14	And having gone out , the Pharisees took counsel against Him , so that they might destroy Him . Jesus Speaks By His Actions . He Does Not Quarrel Or Shout , Fulfilling Isaiah
DLNT	Matthew	12	15	But Jesus , having known it , withdrew from there . And large crowds followed Him , and He cured them all .
DLNT	Matthew	12	16	And He warned them that they should not make Him known ,
DLNT	Matthew	12	17	in order that the thing might be fulfilled having been spoken through Isaiah the prophet saying
DLNT	Matthew	12	18	“ Behold My servant Whom I chose , My Beloved in Whom My soul was [ g ] well-pleased : I will put My Spirit upon Him , and He will announce [ h ] justice to the Gentiles .
DLNT	Matthew	12	19	He will not quarrel , nor shout , nor will anyone hear His voice in the wide-roads .
DLNT	Matthew	12	20	He will not break a reed having been bruised , and He will not quench a smoldering wick , until He leads-out [ i ] justice [ j ] to victory .
DLNT	Matthew	12	21	And the Gentiles will put-hope in His name ” [ Isa 42:1-4 ] . The Crowds Call Jesus The Messiah . The Pharisees Attribute His Power To The Devil
DLNT	Matthew	12	22	Then a blind and mute man being demon-possessed was brought to Him . And He cured him , so that the mute man was speaking and seeing .
DLNT	Matthew	12	23	And all the crowds were astonished , and were saying , “ This One is not the Son of David , is He ? ”
DLNT	Matthew	12	24	But the Pharisees , having heard it , said , “ This One is not casting out the demons except by Beelzebul , the ruler of the demons ! ” Such Blasphemy Against The Spirit Will Not Be Forgiven
DLNT	Matthew	12	25	And knowing their thoughts , He said to them— “ Every kingdom having been divided against itself is desolated , and every city or house having been divided against itself will not stand ;
DLNT	Matthew	12	26	and if Satan is casting-out Satan , he was divided against himself . How then will his kingdom stand ?
DLNT	Matthew	12	27	And if I am casting out the demons by Beelzebul , by whom [ k ] are your sons casting them out ? For this reason they will be your judges ;
DLNT	Matthew	12	28	but if I am casting out the demons by the Spirit of God , then the kingdom of God came [ l ] upon you .
DLNT	Matthew	12	29	Or how can anyone enter into the house of the strong man and snatch-away his things unless he first binds the strong man ? And then he will plunder his house .
DLNT	Matthew	12	30	The one not being with Me [ m ] is against Me . And the one not gathering with Me is scattering .
DLNT	Matthew	12	31	For this reason I say to you— every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven to people . But the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven [ n ] .
DLNT	Matthew	12	32	And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man , it will be forgiven to him . But whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit , it will not be forgiven to him— neither in this age nor in the one coming .
DLNT	Matthew	12	33	Either make the tree good and its fruit good , or make the tree bad and its fruit bad [ o ] . For the tree is known by the fruit .
DLNT	Matthew	12	34	Brood of vipers ! How are you able to speak good things , being evil ? For the mouth speaks out of the abundance of the heart—
DLNT	Matthew	12	35	the good person brings out good things from his good treasure [ p ] , and the evil person brings out evil things from his evil treasure .
DLNT	Matthew	12	36	And I say to you that every useless [ q ] word which people will speak— they will render an account for it on the day of judgment .
DLNT	Matthew	12	37	For by your words you will be declared-righteous , and by your words you will be condemned ” . Pharisees Ask Jesus For a Sign . He Offers Only The Sign of Jonah : Three Days In a Grave
DLNT	Matthew	12	38	Then some of the scribes and Pharisees responded to Him , saying “ Teacher , we want to see a sign from You ” .
DLNT	Matthew	12	39	But the One , having responded , said to them— “ An evil and adulterous [ r ] generation is seeking-for a sign . And a sign will not be given to it , except the sign of Jonah the prophet .
DLNT	Matthew	12	40	For just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the sea-creature [ s ] , so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights [ t ] in the heart of the earth . The Ninevites Will Condemn This Generation , For They Repented At Jonah ’ s Message
DLNT	Matthew	12	41	“ Ninevite men will rise-up at the judgment with this generation , and they will condemn it . Because they repented at the proclamation of Jonah , and behold— a greater thing than Jonah is here .
DLNT	Matthew	12	42	The Queen of the South will be raised at the judgment with this generation , and she will condemn it . Because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon , and behold— a greater thing than Solomon is here . The Demons I Cast Out Now Will Return Later , And You Will Be Worse Off
DLNT	Matthew	12	43	“ Now when the unclean spirit departs from the person , it goes through waterless places seeking rest [ u ] , and does not find it .
DLNT	Matthew	12	44	Then it says , ‘ I will return to my house from where I came-out ’ . And having come , it finds it being unoccupied , having been swept and put-in-order [ v ] .
DLNT	Matthew	12	45	Then it proceeds and takes along with itself seven other spirits more evil than itself . And having gone in , they dwell there , and the last [ w ] state of that person becomes worse than the first . So it will be [ x ] also with this evil generation ” . Jesus Says That Whoever Does The Will of God Is His Brother And Sister And Mother
DLNT	Matthew	12	46	While He was still speaking to the crowds , behold— His mother and brothers were standing outside , seeking to speak to Him .
DLNT	Matthew	12	47	And someone said to Him , “ Behold— Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside , seeking to speak to You ” .
DLNT	Matthew	12	48	But the One , having responded , said to the one speaking to Him , “ Who is My mother and who are My brothers ? ”
DLNT	Matthew	12	49	And having stretched-out His hand toward His disciples , He said “ Behold— My mother and My brothers !

DLNT	Matthew	13	13	For this reason I am speaking to them in parables— because while seeing , they are not seeing ; and while hearing , they are not hearing , nor understanding .
DLNT	Matthew	13	2	And large crowds were gathered-together with Him so that He , having gotten into a boat , sits-down [ to teach ] . And the whole crowd was standing on the shore .
DLNT	Matthew	13	3	And He spoke many things to them in parables , saying— The Sower ’ s Seed Falls On Different Kinds of Soil . Only The Good Soil Produces Fruit “ Behold— the one sowing went out that he might sow .
DLNT	Matthew	13	4	And during his sowing , some seeds fell along the road . And having come , the birds ate them up .
DLNT	Matthew	13	5	And others fell on the rocky [ a ] places where they were not having much soil . And immediately they sprang-up , because of not having a depth of soil .
DLNT	Matthew	13	6	But the sun having risen , they were scorched . And because of not having a root , they were dried-up .
DLNT	Matthew	13	7	And others fell on the thorns . And the thorns came up and choked [ b ] them .
DLNT	Matthew	13	8	And others fell on the good soil and were giving fruit— one a hundred , and another sixty , and another thirty .
DLNT	Matthew	13	9	Let the one having ears , hear ” . Jesus Tells His Disciples He Uses Parables To Both Hide And Reveal The Truth
DLNT	Matthew	13	10	And having come to Him , the disciples said to Him , “ For what reason are You speaking to them in parables ? ”
DLNT	Matthew	13	11	And the One , having responded , said to them , “ Because it has been given to you to know [ c ] the mysteries [ d ] of the kingdom of the heavens . But it has not been given to those ones .
DLNT	Matthew	13	12	For whoever has— it will be given to him , and he will be caused to abound . But whoever does not have— even what he has will be taken-away from him .
DLNT	Matthew	13	14	And the prophecy of Isaiah is being fulfilled in them , the one [ e ] saying [ in Isa 6:9-10 ] : ‘ In hearing , you will hear and by no means understand . And while seeing , you will see and by no means perceive .
DLNT	Matthew	13	15	For the heart of this people became dull [ f ] , and they hardly [ g ] heard with their ears , and they closed their eyes that [ h ] they might not ever see with their eyes , and hear with their ears , and understand in their heart and turn-back , and I shall heal [ i ] them ’ .
DLNT	Matthew	13	16	But blessed [ j ] are your eyes because they are seeing , and your ears , because they are hearing .

DLNT	Mark	5	5	And continually , by night and by day , in the tombs and in the mountains , he was crying-out and cutting himself with stones .
DLNT	Mark	5	2	And He having gone out of the boat , immediately a man with [ a ] an unclean spirit met Him , out of the tombs—
DLNT	Mark	5	3	who was having his dwelling-place in the tombs . And no one was able to bind him any-more , not even with a chain ,

DLNT	Mark	5	11	Now there was a large herd of pigs feeding there at the mountain .
DLNT	Mark	5	12	And they begged Him , saying “ Send us to the pigs , in order that we may enter into them ” .
DLNT	Mark	5	13	And He permitted them . And the unclean spirits , having come out , entered into the pigs . And the herd , about two-thousand , rushed down the steep-bank into the sea . And they were drowning in the sea .
DLNT	Mark	5	14	And the ones feeding [ f ] them fled and reported it in the city and in the fields . And they came to see what the thing having happened was .
DLNT	Mark	5	15	And they come to Jesus , and see the one being demon-possessed sitting , having been clothed and being sound-minded— the one having had the “ legion ” . And they became afraid .
DLNT	Mark	5	16	And the ones having seen it related to them how it happened to the one being demon-possessed , and about the pigs .

DLNT	Mark	5	27	having heard about Jesus , having come in the crowd from behind— touched His garment .
DLNT	Mark	5	28	For she was saying that “ If I touch even His garments , I will be restored ” .
DLNT	Mark	5	29	And immediately the fountain [ l ] of her blood was dried-up , and she knew in her body that she had been healed from the scourge .
DLNT	Mark	5	30	And immediately Jesus— having known in Himself the power [ m ] having gone forth from Him , having turned around in the crowd— was saying “ Who touched My garments ? ”

DLNT	Mark	5	36	But Jesus , having ignored [ p ] the statement being spoken , says to the synagogue-official , “ Do not be fearing , only be believing [ q ] ” .
DLNT	Mark	5	37	And He did not permit anyone to follow with Him except Peter and James and John ( the brother of James ) .
DLNT	Mark	5	38	And they come to the house of the synagogue official , and He sees a commotion [ r ] and ones weeping and wailing loudly .
DLNT	Mark	5	39	And having gone in , He says to them , “ Why are you being thrown-into-a-commotion , and weeping ? The child did not die , but is sleeping ” .
DLNT	Mark	5	40	And they were laughing-scornfully at Him . But He , having put everyone out , takes along the father of the child and the mother and the ones with Him , and proceeds in where the child was .

DLNT	Luke	7	27	This one is about whom it has been written [ in Mal 3:1 ] : ‘ Behold— I am sending forth My messenger ahead of Your presence [ m ] , who will make Your way ready in front of You ’ .
DLNT	Luke	7	28	I say to you— no one is greater [ n ] among ones born of women than John . But the least one in the kingdom of God is greater than he .
DLNT	Luke	7	29	And all the people having heard him [ o ] , even the tax collectors , vindicated [ p ] God , having been baptized with the baptism of John .
DLNT	Luke	7	30	But the Pharisees and the Law-experts rejected the purpose of God for themselves , not having been baptized by him . But This Generation Rejects Both The One Preparing And He Who Came
DLNT	Luke	7	31	“ To what then will I liken the people of this generation , and to what are they like ?
DLNT	Luke	7	32	They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling to one another , who say ‘ We played the flute for you and you did not dance . We lamented [ q ] and you did not weep ’ .
DLNT	Luke	7	33	For John the Baptist has come not eating bread nor drinking wine , and you say ‘ He has a demon ’ .
DLNT	Luke	7	34	The Son of Man has come eating and drinking , and you say ‘ Behold— a man who is a glutton and drunkard [ r ] , a friend of tax-collectors and sinners ’ .
DLNT	Luke	7	35	And wisdom was vindicated [ s ] by all her children ” . Jesus Is Anointed By a Sinful Woman . A Pharisee Objects
DLNT	Luke	7	36	And one of the Pharisees was asking Him to eat with him . And having entered into the house of the Pharisee , He laid-down [ to eat ] .
DLNT	Luke	7	37	And behold— there was a woman in the city who was a sinner . And having learned that He is reclining [ to eat ] at the house of the Pharisee , having brought an alabaster-jar of perfume [ t ] ,
DLNT	Luke	7	38	and having stood behind Him at His feet weeping— she began to wet His feet with the tears , and was wiping them with the hair of her head . And she was kissing His feet , and anointing them with the perfume .
DLNT	Luke	7	39	And having seen it , the Pharisee having invited Him spoke within himself , saying , “ If this One were a prophet , He would know who and what-kind-of person the woman is who is touching Him— that she is a sinner ” . The One Forgiven Much Loves Much . Jesus Forgives Her Sins
DLNT	Luke	7	40	And having responded , Jesus said to him , “ Simon , I have something to speak to you ” . And the one says , “ Teacher , speak ” .
DLNT	Luke	7	41	“ There were two debtors to a certain lender . The one was owing five-hundred denarii [ u ] , and the other , fifty .
DLNT	Luke	7	42	They not having the means to pay , he forgave both . So which of them will love him more ? ”
DLNT	Luke	7	43	And having responded , Simon said , “ I assume that it is to whom he forgave the more ” . And the One said to him , “ You judged correctly ” .
DLNT	Luke	7	44	And having turned toward the woman , He said to Simon , “ Do you see this woman ? I entered into your house— You did not give Me water for My feet . But this one wet My feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair .
DLNT	Luke	7	45	You did not give Me a kiss . But this one did not stop kissing My feet from which hour I came-in .
DLNT	Luke	7	46	You did not anoint My head with oil . But this one anointed My feet with perfume .
DLNT	Luke	7	47	For which reason I say to you— her many sins have been forgiven , because she loved much . But he to whom little is forgiven , loves little ” .
DLNT	Luke	7	48	And He said to her , “ Your sins have been forgiven ” .
DLNT	Luke	7	49	And the ones reclining-back-with Him [ to eat ] began to say among themselves , “ Who is this One , Who even forgives sins ? ”

DLNT	Luke	8	8	And other seed fell into the fertile soil . And having grown , it produced fruit , a hundred-fold ” . While saying these things , He was calling , “ Let the one having ears to hear , hear ” . Jesus Explains The Purpose of Parables And The Meaning of The Sower
DLNT	Luke	8	2	and some women who had been cured from evil spirits and infirmities— Mary , the one being called Magdalene [ a ] , from whom seven demons had come out ,
DLNT	Luke	8	3	and Joanna , the wife of Chuza , Herod ’ s steward [ b ] , and Susanna , and many others , who were serving them out of their possessions .
DLNT	Luke	8	4	And while a large crowd was gathering , and the ones from every city were coming to Him , He spoke with a parable— The Sower ’ s Seed Falls On Different Kinds of Soil . Only The Good Soil Produces Fruit
DLNT	Luke	8	5	“ The one sowing went out that he might sow his seed . And during his sowing some seed fell along the road . And it was trampled-underfoot . And the birds of the heaven ate it up .
DLNT	Luke	8	6	And other seed fell-down on the bed-rock . And having grown , it was dried-up because of not having moisture .
DLNT	Luke	8	7	And other seed fell in the middle of the thorns . And the thorns , having grown-with it , choked it .
DLNT	Luke	8	9	And His disciples were asking Him what this parable might mean .
DLNT	Luke	8	10	And the One said— “ It has been given to you to know [ c ] the mysteries of the kingdom of God . But I speak in parables to the others in order that while seeing they may not be seeing , and while hearing , they may not be understanding .
DLNT	Luke	8	11	Now the parable means this : the seed is the word of God .
DLNT	Luke	8	12	And the people along the road are the ones having heard . Then the devil comes and takes away the word from their heart in order that they may not be saved , having believed .
DLNT	Luke	8	13	And the people on the bed-rock are ones who are welcoming the word with joy when they hear it . And these do not have a root— they are ones who are believing for a time , and are departing [ d ] in a time of testing [ e ] .
DLNT	Luke	8	14	And the seed having fallen into the thorns— these people are the ones having heard , and while proceeding are being choked by the anxieties [ f ] and riches and pleasures of life . And they are not bringing-fruit-to-maturity .
DLNT	Luke	8	15	And the seed in the good soil— these people are ones who , having heard the word in a good and fertile heart , are holding-on-to it and bearing-fruit with endurance . Lamps Are To Give Light And Reveal What Is Hidden
DLNT	Luke	8	16	“ And no one having lit a lamp covers it with a container or puts it under a bed . But he puts it on a lampstand [ g ] in order that the ones coming in may see the light .
DLNT	Luke	8	17	For there is not a hidden thing which will not become visible , nor a hidden-away thing which will never be known and come into visibility . Watch How You Listen
DLNT	Luke	8	18	“ Therefore be watching how you listen . For whoever has— it will be given to him . And whoever does not have— even what he thinks [ h ] that he has will be taken-away from him ” . Those Who Do The Word of God Are My Family
DLNT	Luke	8	19	And His mother and brothers came to Him , and they were not able to meet with Him because of the crowd .
DLNT	Luke	8	20	And it was reported to Him , “ Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside , wishing to see You ” .
DLNT	Luke	8	21	But the One , having responded , said to them , “ My mother and My brothers are these— the ones hearing and doing the word of God ” . Jesus Calms The Sea . Who Is This Man ? Even The Winds And Sea Obey Him !
DLNT	Luke	8	22	And it came about on one of the days that He got into a boat , and His disciples . And He said to them , “ Let us go to the other side of the lake [ i ] ” . And they put-to-sea .
DLNT	Luke	8	23	Now while they were sailing , He fell-asleep . And a storm of wind came down on the lake , and they were being filled-with water and were being-in-danger .
DLNT	Luke	8	24	And having gone to Him , they woke Him up , saying , “ Master , Master , we are perishing ! ” And the One , having awakened , rebuked the wind and the surge of the water . And they ceased , and there was calm .
DLNT	Luke	8	25	And He said to them , “ Where is your faith ? ” But having feared , they marveled , saying to one another , “ Who then is this One , that [ j ] He commands even [ k ] the winds and the water , and they obey Him ? ” Jesus Casts Demons Out of a Man Into a Herd of Pigs .

DLNT	Luke	8	28	And having seen Jesus , having cried out , he fell before Him and said with a loud voice , “ What do [ l ] I have to do with you , Jesus , Son of the Most-High God ? I beg You , do not torment me ” .
DLNT	Luke	8	29	For He ordered the unclean spirit to come out from the man . For it had seized him many times . And he was being bound with chains and shackles [ m ] , while being guarded . And tearing the bonds , he was being driven by the demon into the desolate places .
DLNT	Luke	8	30	And Jesus asked him , “ What is the name for you ? ” And the one said , “ Legion [ n ] ” , because many demons entered into him .
DLNT	Luke	8	31	And they were begging Him that He not command them to go into the abyss .
DLNT	Luke	8	32	Now there was a herd of many pigs there feeding on the mountain . And they begged Him that He permit them to enter into those pigs . And He permitted them .
DLNT	Luke	8	33	And the demons , having come out from the man , entered into the pigs . And the herd rushed down the steep-bank into the lake , and was drowned .
DLNT	Luke	8	34	And the ones feeding [ o ] them , having seen the thing having happened , fled and reported it in the city and in the fields .
DLNT	Luke	8	35	And they came out to see the thing having happened . And they came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons went out sitting— having been clothed , and being sound-minded— at the feet of Jesus . And they became afraid .
DLNT	Luke	8	36	And the ones having seen reported to them how the one having been demon-possessed was restored .
DLNT	Luke	8	37	And the whole crowd from the surrounding-region of the Gerasenes asked Him to depart from them because they were being gripped [ p ] with great fear . And He , having gotten into a boat , returned .
DLNT	Luke	8	38	But the man from whom the demons had gone out was begging Him to be with Him . But He sent him away , saying ,
DLNT	Luke	8	39	“ Return to your house and be relating [ q ] all-that God did for you ” . And he departed , proclaiming throughout the whole city all-that Jesus did for him . Jairus , a Synagogue Official , Comes To Jesus About His Dying Daughter
DLNT	Luke	8	40	And during Jesus ’ returning , the crowd welcomed Him , for they were all expecting Him .
DLNT	Luke	8	41	And behold— a man came , for whom the name was Jairus . And this one was an official [ r ] of the synagogue . And having fallen at [ s ] the feet of Jesus , he was begging Him to enter into his house ,
DLNT	Luke	8	42	because there was an only-born daughter to him , about twelve years old , and she was dying . On The Way , a Woman Touches The Garment of Jesus And Is Healed Now during His going , the crowds were thronging [ t ] Him .
DLNT	Luke	8	43	And a woman being in a flow of blood for twelve years— who , having expended her whole living on physicians , was not able to be cured by anyone—
DLNT	Luke	8	44	having approached from behind , touched the tassel of His garment . And at once her flow of blood stopped .
DLNT	Luke	8	45	And Jesus said , “ Who is the one having touched Me ? ” And while all were denying it , Peter said , “ Master , the crowds are enclosing You and pressing-against You ” .
DLNT	Luke	8	46	But Jesus said , “ Someone touched Me , for I recognized [ u ] power [ v ] having gone forth from Me ” .
DLNT	Luke	8	47	And the woman , having seen that she did not escape-notice , came trembling . And having fallen before Him , she declared in the presence of all the people for what reason she touched Him , and how she was healed at-once .
DLNT	Luke	8	48	And the One said to her , “ Daughter , your faith has restored [ w ] you . Go in peace ” . The Daughter Dies Before Jesus Arrives . He Raises Her From The Dead
DLNT	Luke	8	49	While He is still speaking , someone comes from [ the house of ] the synagogue-official , saying that “ Your daughter is dead . Be troubling the Teacher no longer ” .
DLNT	Luke	8	50	But Jesus , having heard , responded to him , “ Do not be fearing . Only believe , and she will be restored ” .
DLNT	Luke	8	51	And having come to the house , He did not permit anyone to go in with Him except Peter and John and James , and the father of the child , and the mother .
DLNT	Luke	8	52	Now they [ x ] were all weeping and beating-their-breasts for her . But the One said , “ Do not be weeping , for she did not die , but she is sleeping ” .
DLNT	Luke	8	53	And they were laughing-scornfully at Him , knowing that she died .
DLNT	Luke	8	54	But He , having taken hold of her hand , called , saying , “ Child , arise ! ”
DLNT	Luke	8	55	And her spirit returned , and she stood up at-once . And He directed that something should be given to her to eat .

DLNT	Luke	14	11	Because everyone exalting himself will be humbled . And the one humbling himself will be exalted ” . Jesus Says To The One Who Invited Him , Serve Those Who Can not Repay

DLNT	Luke	14	13	But whenever you make a reception , be inviting poor ones , crippled ones , lame ones , blind ones ,
DLNT	Luke	14	15	And one of the ones reclining back with Him [ to eat ] , having heard these things , said to Him , “ Blessed is whoever will eat bread in the kingdom of God ! ”

DLNT	Luke	14	18	And they all alike began to excuse-themselves . The first said to him , ‘ I bought a field . And I have a necessity , having gone out , to see it . I ask you , have me excused ’ .
DLNT	Luke	14	19	And another said , ‘ I bought five pair [ e ] of oxen , and I am proceeding to test them . I ask you , have me excused ’ .

DLNT	Luke	14	26	“ If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters , and furthermore , even his own life , he can not be My disciple .
DLNT	Luke	14	27	Whoever is not carrying his own cross [ l ] and coming after Me , can not be My disciple .

DLNT	Luke	14	29	in order that he having laid a foundation and not being able to finish it out , all the ones observing may not perhaps begin to mock him ,
DLNT	Luke	14	30	saying that ‘ This man began to build and was not able to finish it out ! ’
DLNT	Luke	14	31	Or what king going to engage another king in battle will not , having sat-down first , deliberate whether he is able with ten thousand men to meet [ m ] the one coming against him with twenty thousand ?
DLNT	Luke	14	32	Otherwise indeed , the one coming still being far away— the king , having sent-forth a delegation , asks the things for peace .

DLNT	Luke	17	27	they were eating , drinking , marrying , being given-in-marriage , until which day [ j ] Noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed everyone .
DLNT	Luke	17	28	Likewise , just as it happened in the days of Lot [ in Gen
DLNT	Luke	17	29	But on the day Lot departed from Sodom , it rained fire and sulphur from heaven and destroyed everyone .

DLNT	Luke	17	31	On that day , let he who will be on the housetop and his things in the house not go down to take them . And let the one in a field likewise not turn-back to the things behind .
DLNT	Luke	17	32	Remember Lot ’ s wife .
DLNT	Luke	17	33	Whoever seeks to preserve his life will lose it . But whoever loses it will keep it alive .

DLNT	John	3	26	And they came to John and said to him , “ Rabbi , He who was with you beyond the Jordan , concerning Whom you have testified , look— this One is baptizing , and all are going to Him ! ”
DLNT	John	3	27	John responded and said “ A person can not receive even one thing unless it has been given to him from heaven .

DLNT	John	4	9	So the Samaritan woman says to Him , “ How is it You , being a Jew , are asking something to drink from me , being a Samaritan woman ? ” For Jews do not use-things-together-with [ e ] Samaritans .
DLNT	John	4	10	Jesus responded and said to her , “ If you knew the gift of God , and Who the One saying to you ‘ Give Me water to drink ’ is— you would have asked Him , and He would have given you living water ” .
DLNT	John	4	11	The woman says to Him , “ Sir , You have no bucket and the well is deep . From where then do You have the living water ?
DLNT	John	4	12	You are not greater than our father Jacob , are You , who gave us the well , and himself drank from it , and his sons , and his animals ? ”
DLNT	John	4	13	Jesus responded and said to her , “ Everyone drinking from this water will thirst again .
DLNT	John	4	14	But whoever should drink from the water which I will give him— he will never thirst , ever . On the contrary , the water which I will give him will become a spring of water in him , bubbling-up to eternal life ” .
DLNT	John	4	15	The woman says to Him , “ Sir , give me this water in order that I may not be thirsting , nor coming here to draw it ” .
DLNT	John	4	16	He says to her , “ Go , call your husband and come here ” .
DLNT	John	4	17	The woman responded and said to Him , “ I do not have a husband ” . Jesus says to her , “ You said rightly that ‘ I do not have a husband ’ .
DLNT	John	4	18	For you had five husbands . And now he whom you have is not your husband . You have spoken this as a true thing ” .
DLNT	John	4	19	The woman says to Him , “ Sir , I perceive that You are a prophet .
DLNT	John	4	20	Our fathers worshiped on this [ f ] mountain , and you [ g ] Jews say that the place where one must worship is in Jerusalem ” .
DLNT	John	4	21	Jesus says to her , “ Believe Me , woman , that an hour is coming when you [ h ] Samaritans will give-worship to the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem .
DLNT	John	4	22	You Samaritans worship what you do not know . We Jews worship what we know , because salvation is from the Jews .
DLNT	John	4	23	But an hour is coming , and now is , when the true worshipers will give-worship to the Father in spirit and truth . For indeed the Father is seeking such ones to be the ones worshiping Him .
DLNT	John	4	24	God is spirit , and the ones worshiping Him must worship in spirit and truth ” .
DLNT	John	4	25	The woman says to Him , “ I know that Messiah is coming— the One being called Christ . When that One comes , He will declare all things to us ” .
DLNT	John	4	26	Jesus says to her , “ I , the One speaking to you , am He ” . The Disciples Marvel That He Was Speaking With a Woman
DLNT	John	4	27	And at this point His disciples came , and they were marveling that He was speaking with a woman . Yet no one said , “ What are you seeking ? ” or , “ Why are You speaking with her ? ”
DLNT	John	4	28	So the woman left her waterpot , and went into the city . And she says to the people ,
DLNT	John	4	29	“ Come , see a man Who told me everything that I did . This One is not the Christ , is He ? ”
DLNT	John	4	30	They went out of the city , and were coming to Him . Jesus Explains : I Came To Do God ’ s Will . The Harvest Is Ripe
DLNT	John	4	31	In the meantime the disciples were asking Him , saying , “ Rabbi , eat ” .
DLNT	John	4	32	But the One said to them , “ I have food to eat that you do not know about ” .
DLNT	John	4	33	So the disciples were saying to one another , “ Someone did not bring Him something to eat , did he ? ”
DLNT	John	4	34	Jesus says to them , “ My food is that I may do the will of the One having sent Me , and accomplish His work .
DLNT	John	4	35	Do you not say that ‘ There are still [ i ] four months , and the harvest comes ’ ? Behold , I say to you— lift-up your eyes and look-at the fields , that [ j ] they are white for harvest [ k ] . Already

DLNT	John	4	38	I sent you out to be reaping what you have not [ m ] labored-for . Others have labored , and you have entered into their labor ” . Many Samaritans Believe His Message After Hearing His Words
DLNT	John	4	39	And many of the Samaritans from that city believed in Him because of the word of the woman testifying that “ He told me everything which I did ” .
DLNT	John	4	40	Therefore when the Samaritans came to Him , they were asking Him to stay with them . And He stayed there for two days .
DLNT	John	4	41	And many more believed because of His word .
DLNT	John	4	42	And they were saying to the woman that “ We are no longer believing because of your speaking . For we ourselves have heard , and we know that this One is truly the Savior of the world ” .
DLNT	John	4	43	And after the two days , He went forth from there to Galilee .
DLNT	John	4	44	For Jesus Himself testified that a prophet does not have honor in his own homeland . Arriving In Galilee , a Royal Jew Believes After Jesus Heals His Son
DLNT	John	4	45	So when He came to Galilee , the Galileans welcomed Him , having seen all that He did in Jerusalem at the Feast . For they also went to the Feast .
DLNT	John	4	46	So He came again to Cana of Galilee , where He made the water wine . And there was a certain royal one whose son was sick in Capernaum .

DLNT	John	5	13	But the one having been healed did not know who He was . For Jesus withdrew , a crowd being in the place .
DLNT	John	5	14	After these things , Jesus finds him in the temple . And He said to him , “ See— you have become healthy ! Do not be sinning any longer in order that something worse may not happen to you ” .

DLNT	John	6	32	So Jesus said to them , “ Truly , truly , I say to you , Moses has not given you the bread from heaven , but My Father is giving you the true Bread from heaven .

DLNT	John	6	63	The Spirit is the One giving-life . The flesh profits nothing . The words which I have spoken to you are spirit , and are life .
DLNT	John	6	64	But there are some of you who do not believe ” . For Jesus knew from the beginning who the ones not believing were , and who the one who will hand Him over was .

DLNT	John	7	15	Then the Jews were marveling , saying , “ How does this One know writings [ e ] , not having learned ? ”

DLNT	John	9	2	And His disciples asked Him , saying “ Rabbi , who sinned— this one or his parents , that he should be born blind ? ”
DLNT	John	9	3	Jesus answered , “ Neither this one sinned nor his parents , but it was in order that the works of God might be made-visible in him .
DLNT	John	9	4	We must be working the works of the One having sent Me while it is day . Night is coming , when no one can work .
DLNT	John	9	5	When I am in the world , I am the light of the world ” .
DLNT	John	9	6	Having said these things , He spat on the ground and made mud from the saliva , and smeared its mud on the eyes ,
DLNT	John	9	7	and said to him , “ Go , wash in the pool of Siloam ” ( which is translated “ Sent ” [ a ] ) . So he went away and washed , and came [ b ] [ back ] seeing .
DLNT	John	9	8	Then the neighbors , and the ones seeing him formerly— because [ c ] he was a beggar— were saying “ Is not this the one sitting and begging ? ”
DLNT	John	9	10	So they were saying to him , “ How then were your eyes opened ? ”
DLNT	John	9	11	That one answered , “ The man being called Jesus made mud and smeared it on my eyes , and said to me ‘ Go to Siloam and wash ’ . So having gone away and washed , I received-sight ” .
DLNT	John	9	12	And they said to him , “ Where is that One ? ” He says , “ I do not know ” . The Pharisees Were Divided Over This Sign , Because It Was Done On a Sabbath
DLNT	John	9	13	They bring him to the Pharisees— the formerly blind one .
DLNT	John	9	14	Now it was a Sabbath on the day Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes .
DLNT	John	9	15	Therefore the Pharisees also were asking him again how he received-sight . And the one said to them , “ He put mud on my eyes , and I washed , and I see ” .
DLNT	John	9	16	Then some of the Pharisees were saying , “ This man is not from God , because He does not keep the Sabbath ” . But others were saying , “ How is a sinful man able to do such signs ? ” And there was a division among them .
DLNT	John	9	17	So they say to the blind one again , “ What do you say about Him , seeing-that He opened your eyes ? ” And the one said that “ He is a prophet ” . The Pharisees Question Whether He Was Blind , And Call In The Parents
DLNT	John	9	18	Then the Jews did not believe concerning him that he was blind and received-sight— until they called the parents of him having received-sight .
DLNT	John	9	19	And they asked them , saying “ Is this your son whom you are saying that he was born blind ? How then does he see now ? ”
DLNT	John	9	20	So his parents responded and said , “ We know that this is our son , and that he was born blind .
DLNT	John	9	21	But how he now sees— we do not know . Or who opened his eyes— we do not know . Ask him . He has a mature-age . He will speak about himself ” .

DLNT	John	9	23	For this reason his parents said that “ He has a mature-age , question him ” . They Don ’ t Want To Believe Jesus Did It , So They Question The Man Again
DLNT	John	9	24	Then they called for a second time the man who was blind , and said to him , “ Give glory to God . We know that this man is a sinner ” .
DLNT	John	9	25	So that one responded , “ Whether He is a sinner , I do not know . I know one thing— that being a blind one , now I see ” .
DLNT	John	9	26	So they said to him , “ What did He do to you ? How did He open your eyes ? ”
DLNT	John	9	27	He answered them , “ I told you already and you did not listen . Why do you want to hear it again ? You also do not want to become His disciples , do you ? ”
DLNT	John	9	28	And they reviled him and said , “ You are a disciple of that One , but we are disciples of Moses .
DLNT	John	9	29	We know that God has spoken to Moses . But we do not know where this One is from ” .
DLNT	John	9	30	The man responded and said to them , “ Why , in this is [ d ] the marvel [ e ] — that you do not know where He is from , and He opened my eyes !
DLNT	John	9	31	We know that God does not hear [ f ] sinners . But if anyone is a God-fearing one , and is doing His will— He hears this one .
DLNT	John	9	32	It was not ever heard that someone opened the eyes of one having been born blind .
DLNT	John	9	33	If this One were not from God , He would be able to do nothing ” .
DLNT	John	9	34	They responded and said to him , “ You were born entirely in sins , and you are teaching us ? ” And they threw him outside [ g ] . Jesus Tells The Man , I Came So The Blind May See And The Seeing May Become Blind
DLNT	John	9	35	Jesus heard that they threw him outside , and having found him , said “ Do you believe in the Son of Man ? ”
DLNT	John	9	36	That one responded and said , “ Who indeed is He , Sir , in order that I may believe in Him ? ”
DLNT	John	9	37	Jesus said to him , “ You have both seen Him , and that One is the One speaking with you ” .
DLNT	John	9	38	And the one said , “ Master , I believe ” , and prostrated-himself [ h ] before Him .
DLNT	John	9	39	And Jesus said , “ I came into this world for judgment— so that the ones not seeing [ i ] may be seeing , and the ones seeing may become blind ” . You Pharisees Are Thieves , Not Shepherds , So God ’ s Sheep Do Not Follow You
DLNT	John	9	40	Some of the Pharisees heard these things— the ones being with him— and said to Him , “ We indeed are not blind ones , are we ? ”
DLNT	John	9	41	Jesus said to them , “ If you were blind [ j ] ones , you would not have [ k ] sin . But you are saying now that ‘ We see ’ — your sin remains .

DLNT	John	10	2	But the One entering through the door is the shepherd of the sheep .
DLNT	John	10	3	The doorkeeper opens to this One . And the sheep hear [ a ] His voice . And He calls His own sheep by name , and leads them out .
DLNT	John	10	4	When He brings out all His own , He proceeds in front of them . And the sheep are following Him , because they know His voice .
DLNT	John	10	5	But they will never follow a stranger , but will flee from him , because they do not know the voice of strangers ” .
DLNT	John	10	6	Jesus spoke this figure-of-speech to them , but those ones did not understand what the things were which He was speaking to them . I Am The Door of The Sheep . All Who Enter Through Me Will Be Saved
DLNT	John	10	7	Then Jesus said again , “ Truly , truly , I say to you that I am the door of [ b ] the sheep .
DLNT	John	10	8	All who came before Me are thieves and robbers , but the sheep did not listen-to them .
DLNT	John	10	9	I am the door . If anyone enters through Me , he will be saved . And he will go in and go out , and he will find pasture .
DLNT	John	10	11	“ I am the good shepherd . The good shepherd lays-down His life for the sheep .
DLNT	John	10	12	The one being a hired one and not a shepherd , of whom the sheep are not his own— he sees the wolf coming and leaves [ d ] the sheep and flees , and the wolf snatches them and scatters them ,
DLNT	John	10	13	because he is a hired one , and he is not concerned about the sheep .
DLNT	John	10	14	I am the good shepherd . And I know My sheep , and My sheep know Me—
DLNT	John	10	15	just as the Father knows Me , and I know the Father . And I lay-down My life for the sheep .
DLNT	John	10	16	And I have other sheep , which are not of this fold [ e ] . I must bring those also . And they [ f ] will hear My voice . And they will become one flock , [ with ] one Shepherd .
DLNT	John	10	17	For this reason the Father loves Me— because I lay down My life so that I may take it up again .
DLNT	John	10	18	No one takes it away from Me , but I lay it down of Myself . I have authority to lay it down , and I have authority to take it up again . I received this commandment from My Father ” . The Pharisees Remain Divided
DLNT	John	10	19	A division again [ g ] took place among the Jews because of these words .
DLNT	John	10	20	And many of them were saying , “ He has a demon , and He is mad . Why are you listening-to Him ? ”
DLNT	John	10	21	Others [ h ] were saying , “ These words are not from one being demon-possessed . A demon is not able to open the eyes of blind ones , is he ? ” During The Festival of Hanukkah , Jesus Says He And The Father Are One
DLNT	John	10	22	Then the Festival-of-Dedication [ i ] took place in Jerusalem . It was winter .
DLNT	John	10	23	And Jesus was walking in the temple , in the portico of Solomon .
DLNT	John	10	24	Then the Jews surrounded Him . And they were saying to Him , “ How long are You keeping us in suspense [ j ] ? If You are the Christ , tell us with plainness ” .
DLNT	John	10	25	Jesus answered them , “ I told you , and you do not believe . The works which I am doing in the name of My Father— these are testifying about Me .
DLNT	John	10	26	However , you do not believe , because you are not of My sheep .
DLNT	John	10	27	My sheep hear My voice . And I know them , and they follow Me .
DLNT	John	10	28	And I give them eternal life , and they will never perish , ever . And someone will not snatch them out of My hand .
DLNT	John	10	29	What [ k ] My Father has given to Me is greater than all . And no one is able to snatch them out of the hand of the Father .
DLNT	John	10	30	I and the Father are one [ l ] ” . The Jewish Leaders Want To Kill Jesus For Blasphemy Because He Is Making Himself God
DLNT	John	10	31	The Jews again carried stones in order that they might stone Him .
DLNT	John	10	32	Jesus responded to them , “ I showed you many good works from the Father . For which work of them do you stone Me ? ”
DLNT	John	10	33	The Jews answered Him , “ We do not stone You for a good work , but for blasphemy— even because You , being a human , are making Yourself God ” . Jesus Responds : Saying “ I Am God ’ s Son ” Is Not Blasphemy If I Am Doing God ’ s Works
DLNT	John	10	34	Jesus responded to them , “ Has it not been written in your Law that ‘ I said , you are gods [ m ] ’ ?

DLNT	John	11	11	He said these things , and after this He says to them , “ Our friend Lazarus has fallen-asleep , but I am going in order that I may awaken him ” .
DLNT	John	11	2	And it was Mary , the one having anointed [ a ] the Lord with perfume and having wiped His feet with her hair , whose brother Lazarus was sick .
DLNT	John	11	3	So the sisters sent out a message to Him , saying , “ Lord , look— the one whom You love is sick ” .
DLNT	John	11	4	And having heard , Jesus said “ This sickness is not leading to death , but for the glory of God , in order that the Son of God may be glorified through it ” . Jesus Returns To Judea To Raise Lazarus From The Dead
DLNT	John	11	5	Now Jesus was loving Martha , and her sister , and Lazarus .
DLNT	John	11	6	So when He heard that he was sick , at that time He remained for two days in which place He was—
DLNT	John	11	7	then after this , says to the disciples , “ Let us be going to Judea again ” .
DLNT	John	11	8	The disciples say to Him , “ Rabbi , the Jews were just-now seeking to stone You , and You are going there again ? ”
DLNT	John	11	9	Jesus answered , “ Are there not twelve hours of the day ? If one walks during the day , he does not stumble , because he sees the light of this world .
DLNT	John	11	10	But if one walks during the night , he stumbles , because the light is not in him ” .
DLNT	John	11	12	So the disciples said to Him , “ Lord , if he has fallen asleep , he will be restored ” .
DLNT	John	11	13	Now Jesus had spoken concerning his death , but those ones thought that He was speaking concerning the sleep of slumber [ b ] .
DLNT	John	11	14	So at-that-time Jesus said to them with plainness , “ Lazarus died .
DLNT	John	11	15	And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there , so that you may believe . But let us be going to him ” .
DLNT	John	11	16	Then Thomas , the one being called Didymus [ c ] , said to his fellow-disciples , “ Let us indeed be going , so that we may die with Him [ d ] ” . Jesus Says , I Am The Resurrection And The Life . The One Believing In Me Will Live
DLNT	John	11	17	So having come , Jesus found him already having four days in the tomb .
DLNT	John	11	18	Now Bethany was near Jerusalem , about fifteen stades [ e ] away .
DLNT	John	11	19	And many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary in order that they might console them concerning their brother .
DLNT	John	11	20	So Martha , when she heard that Jesus was coming , met Him . But Mary was sitting in the house .
DLNT	John	11	21	Then Martha said to Jesus , “ Lord , if You had been here , my brother would not have died .
DLNT	John	11	22	But even now I know that whatever You ask God , God will give You ” .
DLNT	John	11	23	Jesus says to her , “ Your brother will rise-up ” .
DLNT	John	11	24	Martha says to Him , “ I know that he will rise-up in the resurrection at the last day ” .
DLNT	John	11	25	Jesus said to her , “ I am the resurrection and the life . The one believing in Me— even though he dies , he will live .
DLNT	John	11	26	And everyone living and believing in Me will never die , ever . Do you believe this ? ”
DLNT	John	11	27	She says to Him , “ Yes , Lord . I have believed that You are the Christ , the Son of God , the One coming into the world ” .
DLNT	John	11	28	And having said this , she went away and called Mary her sister secretly , having said , “ The Teacher is here and is calling you ” .
DLNT	John	11	29	And that one , when she heard , arose quickly and was going to Him .
DLNT	John	11	30	Now Jesus had not yet come into the village , but was still in the place where Martha met Him .
DLNT	John	11	31	So the Jews— the ones being with her in the house and consoling her—having seen that Mary stood up quickly and went out , followed her , having supposed that she was going to the tomb in order that she might weep there .
DLNT	John	11	32	Then Mary— when she came where Jesus was , having seen Him— fell at His feet , saying to Him , “ Lord , if You had been here , my brother would not have died ” .
DLNT	John	11	33	Then Jesus— when He saw her weeping , and the Jews having come with her weeping— was deeply-moved [ f ] in His spirit , and troubled [ g ] Himself .
DLNT	John	11	34	And He said , “ Where have you laid him ? ” They say to Him , “ Lord , come and see ” .

DLNT	John	11	36	So the Jews were saying , “ Look— how He was loving him ! ”
DLNT	John	11	37	And [ h ] some of them said , “ Was not this One— the One having opened the eyes of the blind one— able to cause that this one also should not die ? ” Jesus Calls Lazarus Out of The Tomb . Many Believe In Him
DLNT	John	11	38	Then Jesus , again being deeply-moved in Himself , comes to the tomb . Now it was a cave , and a stone was lying upon [ i ] it .
DLNT	John	11	39	Jesus says , “ Take away the stone ” . Martha , the sister of the one having come-to-an-end [ j ] , says to Him , “ Lord , he already stinks , for it is the fourth-day ” .
DLNT	John	11	40	Jesus says to her , “ Did I not say to you that if you believe , you will see the glory of God ? ”
DLNT	John	11	41	So they took away the stone . And Jesus lifted His eyes upward , and said , “ Father , I thank You that You heard Me .
DLNT	John	11	42	Now I knew that You always hear Me . But I said this for the sake of the crowd having stood around— in order that they may believe that You sent Me forth ” .
DLNT	John	11	43	And having said these things , He shouted with a loud voice , “ Lazarus , come outside ! ”
DLNT	John	11	44	The one having died came out , having been bound as to the feet and the hands with grave-cloths . And his face had been bound-around with a face-cloth . Jesus says to them , “ Unbind him , and allow him to go ” .
DLNT	John	11	45	Therefore many of the Jews— the ones having come to Mary , and having seen the things which He did— believed in Him . Some Told The Pharisees . Caiaphas Prophesies , Better For One To Die For The People
DLNT	John	11	46	But some [ k ] of them went to the Pharisees and told them the things which Jesus did .
DLNT	John	11	47	So the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered together a council [ l ] . And they were saying , “ What are we doing ? Because this man is doing many signs !
DLNT	John	11	48	If we tolerate Him in this manner , everyone will believe in Him , and the Romans will come and take away both our place [ m ] and nation ” .
DLNT	John	11	49	But a certain one of them , Caiaphas , being the high priest of that year , said to them , “ You do not know anything—
DLNT	John	11	50	nor do you consider that it is better for you that one Man die for the people , and the whole nation not perish ” .
DLNT	John	11	51	Now he did not say this from himself , but being the high priest of that year , he prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the nation .
DLNT	John	11	52	And not for the nation only , but in order that He might also gather together into one the children of God having been scattered [ in the world ] .
DLNT	John	11	53	Therefore from that day , they planned to kill Him . Jesus Withdraws From The Public
DLNT	John	11	54	Therefore Jesus was no longer walking in public among the Jews , but went away from there to the region near the wilderness , to a city being called Ephraim . And He stayed there with the disciples . At The Passover , Everyone Was Looking For Jesus
DLNT	John	11	55	Now the Passover [ Feast ] of the Jews was near . And many went up to Jerusalem from the country [ n ] before the Passover [ Feast ] , in order that they might purify themselves .
DLNT	John	11	56	So they were seeking Jesus , and saying , standing with one another in the temple , “ What seems right to you— that He will by no means come to the Feast ? ”
DLNT	John	11	57	And the chief priests and the Pharisees had given commands that if anyone came-to-know where He was , he should disclose it— so that they might seize Him .

DLNT	John	12	12	On the next day the large crowd [ f ] — the one having come to the Feast— having heard [ g ] that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem ,
DLNT	John	12	2	So they made a dinner for Him there . And Martha was serving . And Lazarus was one of the ones reclining-back [ to eat ] with Him .
DLNT	John	12	3	Then Mary , having taken a pound of very-valuable genuine [ a ] nard perfume , anointed the feet of Jesus , and wiped His feet with her hair . And the house was filled from the aroma of the perfume .
DLNT	John	12	4	But Judas the Iscariot— one of His disciples , the one going to hand Him over— says ,
DLNT	John	12	5	“ For what reason was this perfume not sold for three-hundred denarii [ b ] and given to poor ones ? ”
DLNT	John	12	6	Now he said this , not because he was concerned about the poor , but because he was a thief . And having the money-box , he was carrying [ c ] the things being put there .
DLNT	John	12	7	So Jesus said , “ Leave her alone . It was [ d ] in order that she might keep it for the day of My preparation-for-burial .
DLNT	John	12	8	For you always have the poor with you , but you do not always have Me ” .
DLNT	John	12	9	Then the large crowd [ e ] of the Jews came-to-know that He was there . And they came— not because of Jesus only , but in order that they might also see Lazarus , whom He raised from the dead .
DLNT	John	12	10	And the chief priests planned to kill Lazarus also ,
DLNT	John	12	11	because many of the Jews were going-away and were believing in Jesus because of him . Jesus The King Enters Jerusalem On a Donkey , As Predicted By Zechariah
DLNT	John	12	13	took the branches of palm-trees and came out to meet Him . And they were shouting , “ Hosanna ! Blessed is the One coming in the name of the Lord , even the King of Israel ” .
DLNT	John	12	14	And Jesus , having found a young-donkey , sat on it , just as it has been written [ in Zech 9:9 ] :
DLNT	John	12	15	“ Do not be fearing , daughter of Zion . Behold— your King is coming , sitting on a colt of a donkey ” .
DLNT	John	12	16	His disciples did not understand these things at first . But when Jesus was glorified , then they remembered that these things had been written for [ h ] Him , and that they did these things to Him .
DLNT	John	12	17	Then the crowd [ i ] was testifying— the one being with Him when He called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead .
DLNT	John	12	18	For this reason also the crowd [ j ] met Him— because they heard that He had done this sign .
DLNT	John	12	19	Then the Pharisees said to themselves , “ You see that you are profiting nothing ! Look— the world went after Him ! ” Jesus Says The Hour For Which He Came Has Come . A Seed Must Die To Bear Fruit
DLNT	John	12	20	Now some of the ones going up in order that they might worship at the Feast were Greeks [ k ] .
DLNT	John	12	21	So these ones came to Philip , the one from Bethsaida of Galilee , and were asking him , saying , “ Sir , we wish to see Jesus ” .
DLNT	John	12	22	Philip comes and tells Andrew . Andrew and Philip come , and they tell Jesus .
DLNT	John	12	23	And Jesus responds to them , saying , “ The hour has come for [ l ] the Son of Man to be glorified .
DLNT	John	12	24	Truly , truly , I say to you , unless the seed of wheat having fallen to the earth dies , it remains alone . But if it dies , it bears much fruit .
DLNT	John	12	25	The one loving his life loses it , and the one hating his life in this world will keep [ m ] it for eternal life .
DLNT	John	12	26	If anyone serves Me , let him be following Me . And where I am , there also My servant will be . If anyone serves Me , the Father will honor him .

DLNT	John	12	38	in order that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled which he spoke [ in Isa 53:1 ] : “ Lord , who believed our report ? And to whom was the arm of the Lord revealed ? ”
DLNT	John	12	39	For this reason [ r ] they were not able to believe : because again Isaiah said [ in Isa 6:10 ]
DLNT	John	12	40	“ He has blinded their eyes , and He hardened their heart , in order that they might not see with their eyes , and comprehend in their heart , and be turned , and I shall heal them ” .

DLNT	John	12	42	Yet indeed , even many of the rulers believed in Him . But because of the Pharisees , they were not confessing it in order that they might not become put-out-of-the-synagogue .

DLNT	John	13	2	And dinner taking-place [ c ] , the devil having already put into his heart that Judas , son of Simon Iscariot , should hand Him over—
DLNT	John	13	3	Jesus , knowing [ d ] that the Father gave Him all things into His hands , and that He came forth from God and is going to God ,
DLNT	John	13	4	arises from the dinner and lays-down His [ outer ] garments . And having taken a towel , He tied it around Himself .
DLNT	John	13	5	Then He puts water into the wash-basin . And He began to wash the feet of the disciples , and to wipe them with the towel which had been tied-around Himself .
DLNT	John	13	6	Then He comes to Simon Peter . He says to Him , “ Lord , do You wash my feet ? ”
DLNT	John	13	7	Jesus responded and said to him , “ You do not know what I am doing now , but you will understand after these things ” .
DLNT	John	13	8	Peter says to Him , “ You will never wash my feet , ever ! ” Jesus responded to him , “ If I do not wash you , you have no part [ e ] with Me ” .
DLNT	John	13	9	Simon Peter says to Him , “ Lord , wash not my feet only , but also the hands and the head ! ”
DLNT	John	13	10	Jesus says to him , “ The one having bathed has no need except to wash his feet , but is entirely clean . And you [ f ] are clean— but not all of you ” .
DLNT	John	13	11	For He knew the one handing Him over . For this reason He said that “ You are not all clean ” .
DLNT	John	13	12	Then when He washed their feet , and took His garments , and fell back again [ to eat ] , He said to them , “ Do you understand what I have done for you ?
DLNT	John	13	14	Therefore if I , the Lord and the Teacher , washed your feet , you also ought to be washing the feet of one another .
DLNT	John	13	15	For I gave you an example , in order that you also should be doing just as I did for you .
DLNT	John	13	16	Truly , truly , I say to you , a slave is not greater than his master , nor is a messenger greater than the one having sent him .

DLNT	John	13	21	Having said these things , Jesus was troubled in His spirit . And He testified and said “ Truly , truly , I say to you that one of you will hand Me over ” .
DLNT	John	13	22	The disciples were looking at one another , being perplexed about whom He was speaking .
DLNT	John	13	23	One of His disciples was reclining-back at the bosom of Jesus— the one whom Jesus was loving .
DLNT	John	13	24	So Simon Peter nods [ g ] to this one to inquire as to who it might be about whom He is speaking .
DLNT	John	13	25	So that one , having leaned back thus on the chest of Jesus , says to Him , “ Lord , who is it ? ”
DLNT	John	13	26	Jesus answers , “ It is that one for whom I will dip the piece-of-bread and give it to him ” . Then having dipped the piece-of-bread , He takes and gives it to Judas , son of Simon Iscariot .
DLNT	John	13	27	And after the piece-of-bread , at that time Satan entered into that one . Then Jesus says to him , “ What you are doing , do quicker [ h ] ” .
DLNT	John	13	28	Now none of the ones reclining-back [ to eat ] understood this— for what purpose He said it to him .
DLNT	John	13	29	For some were thinking , since Judas had the money-box , that Jesus was telling him , “ Buy the things of which we have a need for the Feast ” , or that he should give something to the poor .
DLNT	John	13	30	So having received the piece-of-bread , that one went out immediately . And it was night . Then Jesus Says , Now God Was Glorified In Me . And He Will Yet Glorify Me
DLNT	John	13	31	Then when he went out , Jesus says , “ Now [ i ] the Son of Man was glorified [ j ] , and God was glorified in Him .
DLNT	John	13	32	If God was [ k ] glorified in Him , God will also glorify Him in Himself— and will glorify Him immediately . Where I Am Going You Can not Come . Love One Another As I Have Loved You

DLNT	John	13	36	Simon Peter says to Him , “ Lord , where are You going ? ” Jesus answered him , “ Where I am going , you are not able to follow Me now . But you will follow later ” .
DLNT	John	13	37	Peter says to Him , “ Lord , for what reason am I not able to follow You right-now ? I will lay-down my life for You ” .

DLNT	John	16	20	Truly , truly , I say to you that you will weep and lament , but the world will rejoice . You will be grieved , but your grief will become joy .
DLNT	John	16	21	The woman has grief when she gives-birth , because her hour came . But when she bears the child , she no longer remembers the affliction because of the joy that a person was born into the world .
DLNT	John	16	22	You then also now have grief— but I will see you again , and your heart will rejoice . And no one is going to take away your joy from you .
DLNT	John	16	23	And in that day you will not question Me as to anything . Truly , truly , I say to you , if you ask the Father anything in My name , He will give it to you .
DLNT	John	16	24	Until now you did not ask anything in My name . Be asking and you will receive , in order that your joy may be full . Then I Will Speak To You Plainly About The Father
DLNT	John	16	25	“ I have spoken these things to you in figures-of-speech . An hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figures-of-speech , but I will tell you about the Father with plainness .
DLNT	John	16	26	In that day you will ask in My name . And I am not saying to you that I will request the Father on [ f ] your behalf .
DLNT	John	16	27	For the Father Himself loves you , because you have loved Me , and have believed that I came forth from God .
DLNT	John	16	28	I came forth from the Father , and I have come into the world . Again [ g ] , I am leaving the world and going to the Father ” . But Soon You Will Be Scattered
DLNT	John	16	29	His disciples say , “ Look— now You are speaking with plainness , and You are speaking no figure-of-speech .
DLNT	John	16	30	Now we know that You know all things , and You have no need that anyone question You . By this we believe that You came forth from God ” .
DLNT	John	16	31	Jesus responded to them , “ Now [ h ] you believe !
DLNT	John	16	32	Behold , an hour is coming , and has come , for you to be scattered— each to his own things— and leave Me alone . And-yet I am not alone , because the Father is with Me . Take Courage , I Have Overcome The World

DLNT	John	18	2	Now Judas , the one handing Him over , also knew the place , because Jesus often was gathered there with His disciples .
DLNT	John	18	3	So Judas— having received [ b ] the [ Roman ] cohort [ c ] , and officers from the chief priests and from the Pharisees— comes there with lanterns and torches and weapons .
DLNT	John	18	4	Then Jesus , knowing all the things coming upon Him , went forth . And He says to them , “ Whom are you seeking ? ”
DLNT	John	18	5	They answered Him , “ Jesus the Nazarene ” . He says to them , “ I am He ” . Now Judas , the one handing Him over , was also standing there with them .
DLNT	John	18	6	So when He said to them , “ I am He ” , they [ d ] went back , and fell on the ground .
DLNT	John	18	7	Then He again asked them , “ Whom are you seeking ? ” And the ones said , “ Jesus the Nazarene ” .
DLNT	John	18	8	Jesus responded , “ I told you that I am He . If then you are seeking Me , permit these ones to go ” —
DLNT	John	18	9	in order that the word which He spoke [ e ] might be fulfilled , that “ The ones whom You have given Me— I did not lose any of them ” .
DLNT	John	18	10	Then Simon Peter , having a sword , drew it and hit the slave of the high priest , and cut-off his right ear . And the name for the slave was Malchus .
DLNT	John	18	11	Then Jesus said to Peter , “ Put the sword into the sheath . The cup which the Father has given Me— shall not I drink it ? ” Jesus Stands Before Annas And Caiaphas
DLNT	John	18	12	Then the [ Roman ] cohort and its commander [ f ] , and the officers of the Jews , arrested Jesus , and bound Him .
DLNT	John	18	13	And they led Him to Annas first . For he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas , who was the high priest of that year .
DLNT	John	18	14	And Caiaphas was the one having counseled [ g ] the Jews that it was better that one Man die for the people . Peter Denies Jesus
DLNT	John	18	15	Now Simon Peter and another disciple [ h ] were following Jesus . And that disciple was known to the high priest , and he entered with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest .
DLNT	John	18	16	But Peter was standing at the door outside . So the other disciple , the one known by the high priest , went out and spoke to the doorkeeper , and brought in Peter .
DLNT	John	18	17	Then the doorkeeper servant-girl says to Peter , “ You are not also one of the disciples of this man , are you ? ” That one says , “ I am not ” .
DLNT	John	18	19	So the high priest questioned Jesus about His disciples , and about His teaching .
DLNT	John	18	20	Jesus answered him , “ I have spoken in public to the world . I always taught at synagogue , and in the temple , where all the Jews come together . And I spoke nothing in secret .
DLNT	John	18	21	Why are you questioning Me ? Question the ones having heard what I spoke to them . Look , these ones know the things which I said ” .
DLNT	John	18	22	And He having said these things , one of the officers standing near gave Jesus a slap [ i ] , having said , “ In this manner do you answer the high priest ? ”
DLNT	John	18	23	Jesus answered him , “ If I spoke wrongly , testify about the thing wrong . But if I spoke rightly , why do you beat Me ? ”
DLNT	John	18	24	Then Annas sent Him forth , having been bound , to Caiaphas the high priest . Peter Denies Jesus a Second And Third Time
DLNT	John	18	25	And Simon Peter is standing there and warming himself . So they said to him , “ You are not also one of His disciples , are you ? ” That one denied it and said , “ I am not ” .
DLNT	John	18	26	One of the slaves of the high priest , being a relative of the one of whom Peter cut-off the ear , says , “ Did I not see you in the garden with Him ? ”
DLNT	John	18	27	Then again Peter denied it . And immediately a rooster crowed . Jesus Stands Before Pilate
DLNT	John	18	28	Then they lead Jesus from Caiaphas to the Praetorium [ j ] . And it was early-morning . And they themselves did not enter into the Praetorium in order that they might not be defiled , but might eat the Passover [ Feast ] [ k ] . The Jewish Rulers Tell Pilate They Want Jesus Executed
DLNT	John	18	29	So Pilate went outside to them . And he says , “ What accusation do you bring against this man ? ”
DLNT	John	18	30	They responded and said to him , “ If this One were not doing wrong [ l ] , we would not have handed Him over to you ” .
DLNT	John	18	31	So Pilate said to them , “ You take Him and judge Him according to your Law ” . The Jews said to him , “ It is not lawful [ m ] for us to execute anyone ” —
DLNT	John	18	32	in order that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled which He spoke signifying [ n ] by what kind of death He was going to die . Jesus Says To Pilate , My Kingdom Is Not of This World
DLNT	John	18	33	So Pilate entered again into the Praetorium , and called Jesus . And he said to Him , “ Are You the King of the Jews ? ”
DLNT	John	18	34	Jesus answered , “ Are you saying this from yourself , or did others tell you about Me ? ”
DLNT	John	18	35	Pilate answered , “ I am not a Jew , am I ? Your nation [ o ] and the chief priests handed You over to me . What did You do ? ”
DLNT	John	18	36	Jesus answered , “ My kingdom is not of this world . If My kingdom were of this world , My servants would be fighting in order that I might not be handed-over to the Jews . But as-it-is [ p ] , My kingdom is not from here ” .
DLNT	John	18	37	Therefore Pilate said to Him , “ So-then You are a king ? ” Jesus answered , “ You are saying [ q ] that [ r ] I am a king . I have been born for this . And I have come into the world for this : that I might testify to the truth . Everyone being of the truth hears [ s ] My voice ” .
DLNT	John	18	38	Pilate says to Him , “ What is truth ? ” Pilate Finds No Charge Against Jesus , But Has Him Whipped And having said this , he again went out to the Jews . And he says to them , “ I find no charge [ t ] in [ u ] Him .

DLNT	John	19	9	And he entered into the Praetorium again . And he says to Jesus , “ Where are You from ? ” But Jesus did not give him an answer .
DLNT	John	19	10	So Pilate says to Him , “ You do not speak to me ? Do You not know that I have authority to release You , and I have authority to crucify You ? ”
DLNT	John	19	11	Jesus answered him , “ You would not have any authority against [ b ] Me unless it [ c ] had been given to you from above . For this reason the one having handed Me over to you has a greater sin ” . Pilate Tries To Release Jesus , But The Jewish Leaders Stop Him

DLNT	John	19	13	Therefore Pilate , having heard these words , brought Jesus outside , and sat on a judgment-seat in a place being called ‘ The Pavement ’ ( but in Hebrew , ‘ Gabbatha ’ ) .
DLNT	John	19	14	Now it was Preparation [ e ] day of the Passover [ Feast ] [ f ] . The hour was about the sixth [ g ] . And he says to the Jews , “ Look— your King ! ”
DLNT	John	19	15	Then those ones shouted , “ Take Him away , take Him away , crucify Him ! ” Pilate says to them , “ Shall I crucify your King ? ” The chief priests answered , “ We do not have a king except Caesar ” .
DLNT	John	19	16	So at that time he handed Him over to them [ h ] in order that He might be crucified . The King of The Jews Is Crucified So they took Jesus .
DLNT	John	19	17	And bearing the cross for Himself , He went out to the place being called “ The Place of a Skull ” ( which is called in Hebrew , “ Golgotha ” ) ,
DLNT	John	19	18	where they crucified Him and two others with Him— on this side and on this side , and Jesus in the middle .
DLNT	John	19	20	Therefore many of the Jews read this title , because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city . And it had been written in Hebrew , Latin , Greek .
DLNT	John	19	21	So the chief priests of the Jews were saying to Pilate , “ Do not write , ‘ The King of the Jews ’ , but that that One said , ‘ I am King of the Jews ’ ” .
DLNT	John	19	22	""
DLNT	John	19	23	Then the soldiers , when they crucified Jesus , took His garments and made four parts— a part for each soldier— and the tunic [ j ] . Now the tunic was seamless , woven from the top through the whole .
DLNT	John	19	24	So they said to one another , “ Let us not tear it , but let us cast-lots for it to decide whose it will be ” — in order that the Scripture [ in Ps 22:18 ] might be fulfilled , the one saying , “ They divided My garments among themselves , and they cast a lot for My clothing ” .

DLNT	John	19	25	Now His mother , and the sister of His mother , Mary the wife of Clopas , and Mary the Magdalene , were standing beside the cross of Jesus .
DLNT	John	19	26	So Jesus , having seen His mother and the disciple [ k ] whom He was loving standing near , says to His mother , “ Woman , look— your son ! ”

DLNT	John	19	28	After this , Jesus— knowing that all things have already [ m ] been finished , in order that the Scripture [ in Ps 69:21 ] might be accomplished— says , “ I am thirsty ” .
DLNT	John	19	29	A jar full of sour-wine was setting there . So having put a sponge full of the sour wine on a hyssop branch , they brought it to His mouth .

DLNT	John	19	31	Then the Jews— because it was Preparation day , in order that the bodies might not remain on the cross during the Sabbath ( for the day of that Sabbath was a great [ o ] day ) — asked Pilate that their legs be broken , and they be taken away .

DLNT	John	19	36	For these things took place in order that the Scripture [ in Ex 12:46 ] might be fulfilled : “ A bone of His will not be broken ” .

DLNT	John	19	38	Now after these things Joseph from Arimathea— being a disciple of Jesus , but having been hidden [ r ] because of the fear of the Jews— asked Pilate in order that he might take away the body of Jesus . And Pilate permitted it . So he came and took away His body .
DLNT	John	19	39	And Nicodemus also came— the one having first come to Him by night— bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes , about a hundred pounds [ s ] .
DLNT	John	19	40	So they took the body of Jesus and bound it in linen-cloths with the spices , as is the custom for the Jews to prepare-for-burial .
DLNT	John	19	41	Now there was a garden in the place where He was crucified . And in the garden was a new tomb in which no one yet had been laid .

DLNT	John	20	2	So she runs and comes to Simon Peter , and to the other disciple [ a ] whom Jesus was loving . And she says to them , “ They took the Lord out of the tomb , and we do not know where they put Him ” .
DLNT	John	20	3	So Peter and the other disciple went forth , and were going to the tomb .
DLNT	John	20	4	And the two were running together . And the other disciple ran ahead faster than Peter , and came to the tomb first .
DLNT	John	20	5	And having stooped-to-look , he sees the linen-cloths lying there , but he did not enter .
DLNT	John	20	6	Then Simon Peter also comes , following him . And he entered into the tomb . And he sees the linen-cloths lying there ,

DLNT	John	20	13	And those ones say to her , “ Woman , why are you weeping ? ” She says to them , “ Because [ e ] they took my Lord , and I do not know where they put Him ” .
DLNT	John	20	14	Having said these things , she turned back , and sees Jesus standing there . And she did not know that it was Jesus .
DLNT	John	20	15	Jesus says to her , “ Woman , why are you weeping ? Whom are you seeking ? ” That one , thinking that He is the gardener , says to Him , “ Sir , if you carried Him away , tell me where you put Him , and I will take Him ” .
DLNT	John	20	16	Jesus says to her , “ Mary ” . That one , having turned , says to Him in Hebrew , “ Rabboni ! ” ( which means , Teacher ) .
DLNT	John	20	17	Jesus says to her , “ Do not be clinging-to [ f ] Me , for I have not [ g ] yet gone-up to the Father . But go to My brothers and say to them , ‘ I am going-up [ h ] to My Father and your Father , and My God and your God ’ ” .
DLNT	John	20	18	Mary the Magdalene comes , announcing to the disciples that “ I have seen the Lord ” , and that He said these things to her . That Evening , Jesus Meets Ten of The Disciples And Says , Receive The Holy Spirit
DLNT	John	20	19	Then— being evening on that first [ i ] day of the week , and the doors having been locked where the disciples were because of the fear of the Jews— Jesus came and stood in their midst . And He says to them , “ Peace to you ” .
DLNT	John	20	21	Then Jesus said to them again , “ Peace to you . Just as the Father has sent Me forth , I also am sending you ” .
DLNT	John	20	22	And having said this , He breathed-on [ j ] them . And He says to them , “ Receive the Holy Spirit .
DLNT	John	20	23	If you forgive the sins of any , they have been forgiven for them . If you retain [ k ] the sins of any , they have been retained ” . After Eight Days , Jesus Meets Thomas , Who Says , My Lord And My God !
DLNT	John	20	24	Now Thomas , one of the twelve , the one being called Didymus [ l ] , was not with them when Jesus came .
DLNT	John	20	25	So the other disciples were saying to him , “ We have seen the Lord ! ” But the one said to them , “ Unless I see the mark [ m ] of the nails in His hands , and put my finger into the mark of the nails , and put my hand into His side , I will by no means believe ” .
DLNT	John	20	26	And after eight days , His disciples were again inside , and Thomas was with them . Jesus comes— the doors having been locked . And He stood in their midst and said , “ Peace to you ” .
DLNT	John	20	27	Then He says to Thomas , “ Bring your finger here and see My hands . And bring your hand and put it into My side . And do not be unbelieving , but believing ” .
DLNT	John	20	28	Thomas responded and said to Him [ n ] , “ My Lord and my God ! ”
DLNT	John	20	29	Jesus says to him , “ You have believed because you have seen Me . Blessed are the ones not having seen and having believed ” . Jesus Did Many Other Signs
DLNT	John	20	30	Then indeed Jesus also did many other signs [ o ] in the presence of His disciples , which have not been written in this book .
DLNT	John	20	31	But these things have been written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ , the Son of God , and so that believing , you may have life in His name .

DLNT	John	21	21	So Peter , having looked-at this one , says to Jesus , “ Lord , and what of this one ?
DLNT	John	21	2	Simon Peter , and Thomas ( the one being called Didymus ) , and Nathanael ( the one from Cana of Galilee ) , and the sons of Zebedee , and two other of His disciples were together .
DLNT	John	21	3	Simon Peter says to them , “ I am going to fish ” . They say to him , “ We are also coming with you ” . They went out and got into the boat . And during that night they caught nothing .
DLNT	John	21	4	Now having already become early-morning , Jesus stood at the shore . But the disciples did not know that it was Jesus .
DLNT	John	21	5	So Jesus says to them , “ Children [ b ] , you do not have any fish-to-eat , do you ? ” They answered Him , “ No ” .
DLNT	John	21	6	And the One said to them , “ Cast the net to the right side of the boat and you will find them ” . So they cast it , and they were no longer strong-enough to draw it [ into the boat ] because of the multitude of the fish .
DLNT	John	21	7	Then that disciple whom Jesus was loving says to Peter , “ It is the Lord ” . So Simon Peter , having heard that it was the Lord , tied his outer-garment around himself ( for he was naked [ c ] ) , and threw himself into the sea .
DLNT	John	21	8	But the other disciples came in the small-boat ( for they were not far from the land , but about two-hundred cubits [ d ] away ) — dragging the net of fish .
DLNT	John	21	9	Then when they got out to the land , they see a charcoal-fire lying there , and fish lying upon it , and bread .
DLNT	John	21	10	Jesus says to them , “ Bring from the fish which you now caught ” .
DLNT	John	21	11	So Simon Peter went up and drew the net to land , full of large fish— a hundred fifty three . And though being so many , the net was not torn .
DLNT	John	21	12	Jesus says to them , “ Come , eat-breakfast ” . And none of the disciples was daring to question Him , “ Who are You ? ” , knowing that it was the Lord .
DLNT	John	21	13	Jesus comes and takes the bread and gives it to them , and the fish likewise .
DLNT	John	21	14	This is now the third [ e ] time Jesus was manifested to the disciples after having arisen from the dead . At Breakfast , Jesus Restores Peter . Do You Love Me ? Feed My Sheep
DLNT	John	21	15	Then when they ate-breakfast , Jesus says to Simon Peter , “ Simon , son of John , do you devotedly-love [ f ] Me more than these [ g ] ? ” He says to Him , “ Yes , Lord . You know that I affectionately-love You ” . He says to him , “ Be feeding My lambs ” .
DLNT	John	21	16	He says to him again a second time , “ Simon , son of John , do you devotedly-love Me ? ” He says to Him , “ Yes , Lord . You know that I affectionately-love You ” . He says to him , “ Be shepherding My sheep ” .
DLNT	John	21	17	He says to him the third time , “ Simon , son of John , do you affectionately-love Me ? ” Peter was grieved because [ h ] He said to him the third time , “ Do you affectionately-love Me ? ” . And he says to Him , “ Lord , You know all things . You recognize [ i ] that I affectionately-love You ” . Jesus says to him , “ Be feeding My sheep .
DLNT	John	21	18	Truly , truly , I say to you , when you were younger you were girding [ j ] yourself and walking where you were wanting to go . But when you become-old [ k ] , you will stretch-out your hands and another will gird you and [ l ] bring you where you are not wanting to go ” .
DLNT	John	21	19	Now this He said signifying by what kind [ m ] of death he will glorify God . And having said this , He says to him , “ Be following Me ! ” Peter Asks Jesus About John
DLNT	John	21	20	Peter , having turned around , sees the disciple [ n ] following them whom Jesus was loving— the one who also leaned back on His chest during dinner and said , “ Lord , who is the one handing You over ? ”
DLNT	John	21	22	Jesus says to him , “ If I want him to remain until I come , what is it to you ? You be following Me ! ”
DLNT	John	21	23	Therefore this statement went out to the brothers , that “ that disciple does not die ” . But Jesus did not say to him that he does not die , but “ If I want him to remain until I come , what is it to you ? ” John Concludes The Book
DLNT	John	21	24	This [ o ] one is the disciple testifying about these things , and [ p ] the one having written these things , and we know that his testimony is true .
DLNT	John	21	25	And there are also many other things which Jesus did , which if they should be written individually , I suppose that not even the world itself would have-room-for the books being written .

DLNT	Romans	1	2	which He promised-beforehand through His prophets in the Holy Scriptures
DLNT	Romans	1	3	concerning His Son— the One having come from the seed of David according-to [ d ] the flesh ,
DLNT	Romans	1	4	the One having been designated [ e ] as the Son of God with power according to the Spirit [ f ] of holiness by the resurrection from the dead , Jesus Christ our Lord—
DLNT	Romans	1	5	through Whom we received grace and apostleship for the obedience of [ g ] faith among all the Gentiles for the sake of His name ,
DLNT	Romans	1	6	among whom you also are called ones of Jesus Christ ,
DLNT	Romans	1	7	to all the ones being in Rome , beloved ones of God , called saints : Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
DLNT	Romans	1	8	First , I am giving-thanks to my God through Jesus Christ for you all because your faith is being proclaimed in the whole world .
DLNT	Romans	1	9	For God is my witness— Whom I am serving in my spirit in [ h ] the good-news of His Son— how unceasingly I am making mention of you
DLNT	Romans	1	10	always in my prayers , asking if somehow now at last I shall be prospered in the will of God to come to you .
DLNT	Romans	1	11	For I am yearning to see you in order that I may impart some spiritual gift to you so that you may be established .
DLNT	Romans	1	12	And this is that I may be encouraged-together-with you among you— through each other ’ s faith , both yours and mine .
DLNT	Romans	1	13	And I do not want you to be-unaware , brothers , that often I planned to come to you— and was prevented until now— in order that I might have some fruit among you also , as indeed among the other Gentiles .
DLNT	Romans	1	14	I am a debtor both to Greeks and barbarians , both to wise and foolish .
DLNT	Romans	1	15	So for my part , I am eager also to announce-the-good-news to you , the ones in Rome .

DLNT	Romans	1	18	For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness [ k ] and unrighteousness [ l ] of people holding-down [ m ] the truth in [ n ] unrighteousness . Because God Revealed Enough of Himself In Creation For The World To Be Without Excuse
DLNT	Romans	1	19	Because the thing known of God is evident [ o ] in [ p ] them , for God made it evident to them .
DLNT	Romans	1	20	For His invisible things— both His eternal power and divine-nature— are clearly-seen , being understood since the creation of the world in the things made , so that they are without-excuse . And Having Known This Truth About God , The World Did Not Honor Him As God
DLNT	Romans	1	21	Because having known God , they did not glorify Him as God or give-thanks , but became futile in their thoughts , and their senseless heart was darkened . They Turned From The Glory of The Immortal God To Their Crafted Images of God
DLNT	Romans	1	22	While claiming to be wise , they became-foolish
DLNT	Romans	1	23	and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for a likeness— an image of a mortal person and of birds and of four-footed-animals and of reptiles .
DLNT	Romans	1	24	Therefore God handed them over [ q ] in the desires of their hearts to impurity so that [ r ] their bodies are dishonored among them . They Turned From The Truth To Worship The Creation Rather Than The Creator
DLNT	Romans	1	25	Who exchanged the truth of God for the lie [ s ] , and worshiped and served the creation [ t ] rather than the One having created— Who is blessed forever , amen .
DLNT	Romans	1	26	For this reason God handed them over to passions of [ u ] dishonor . For both their females exchanged the natural [ sexual ] function for the one contrary to nature ,
DLNT	Romans	1	27	and likewise also the males , having left the natural [ sexual ] function of the female , were inflamed by their craving for one another— males with males committing the indecent-act [ v ] and receiving-back in themselves the return [ w ] which was due their error [ x ] . They Disapproved of Keeping God In Mind
DLNT	Romans	1	28	And as they did not approve to have [ y ] God in their knowledge , God handed them over to a disapproved mind , to do the things not being proper—
DLNT	Romans	1	29	having been filled with all unrighteousness , evilness , greed , badness ; full of envy , murder , strife , deceit , malice ; whisperers [ z ] ,
DLNT	Romans	1	30	slanderers , God-haters [ aa ] , violent , proud , boasters , inventors of evils , disobedient to parents ,
DLNT	Romans	1	31	senseless , unfaithful [ ab ] , unaffectionate [ ac ] , unmerciful ;
DLNT	Romans	1	32	who , having known the regulation of God that the ones practicing such things are worthy of death , not only are doing them , but are also giving-approval to the ones practicing them .

DLNT	Romans	2	2	And we know that the judgment of God is according to truth upon [ b ] the ones practicing such things . Do You Think You Will Escape God ’ s Judgment When You Do The Same Things ?
DLNT	Romans	2	3	But are you thinking this , O human— the one judging the ones practicing such things and doing them [ yourself ] — that you will escape the judgment of God ?
DLNT	Romans	2	4	Or are you disregarding the riches of His goodness and forbearance and patience , not knowing that the good thing of God is leading you to repentance ?
DLNT	Romans	2	5	But in-accordance-with your hardness and your unrepentant heart , you are storing-up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath and the revelation of the righteous-judgment of God ,
DLNT	Romans	2	6	Who will render to each one according to his works—
DLNT	Romans	2	7	to the ones seeking glory and honor and immortality in accordance with endurance in good work , He will render eternal life ;
DLNT	Romans	2	8	but to the ones indeed disobeying the truth and obeying unrighteousness out of selfish-interest [ c ] , there will be wrath and fury . There Is No Respect of Persons With God Regarding Sin And Judgment
DLNT	Romans	2	9	There will be affliction and distress upon every soul of the person [ d ] committing evil— both of the Jew first and of the Greek .
DLNT	Romans	2	10	But there will be glory and honor and peace to everyone working good— both to the Jew first and to the Greek .

DLNT	Romans	2	13	For not the hearers of law [ f ] are righteous before God , but the doers of law will be declared-righteous . For Gentiles Will Be Judged By Their Own Standards Insofar As They Agree With God ’ s
DLNT	Romans	2	14	For whenever Gentiles , the ones not having the Law , are doing by nature the things of the Law , these ones not having the Law are a law to themselves ,
DLNT	Romans	2	15	who are demonstrating [ g ] the work of the Law written in their hearts— their conscience bearing co-witness and their thoughts accusing or even defending between one another
DLNT	Romans	2	16	on the day when God judges the hidden things of people according to my good-news , through Christ Jesus . And Jews Will Be Judged By The Law They Rely Upon
DLNT	Romans	2	17	But if you call-yourself a Jew , and rely upon the Law , and boast in God ,
DLNT	Romans	2	18	and know His will , and approve the things mattering [ h ] — being instructed out of the Law—
DLNT	Romans	2	19	and are confident as to yourself that you are a guide of blind ones , a light of the ones in darkness ,
DLNT	Romans	2	20	a corrector of foolish ones , a teacher of children , one having the embodiment of knowledge and truth in the Law ,
DLNT	Romans	2	21	then— the one teaching another , are you not teaching yourself ? The one proclaiming not to steal , do you steal ?
DLNT	Romans	2	22	The one saying not to commit-adultery , do you commit-adultery ? The one detesting idols , do you rob-temples ? Their Transgression of The Law Dishonors God
DLNT	Romans	2	23	You who are boasting in the Law are dishonoring God through transgression of the Law .
DLNT	Romans	2	24	For “ the name of God is being blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you ” , just as it has been written [ in Isa 52:5 ] . Circumcision Will Not Help Transgressors
DLNT	Romans	2	25	For circumcision profits if you practice the Law— but if you are a transgressor of the Law your circumcision has become uncircumcision .
DLNT	Romans	2	26	So if the uncircumcised one keeps the requirements of the Law , will not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision ?
DLNT	Romans	2	27	And the uncircumcised one by nature who is fulfilling the Law will judge you , the transgressor of the Law with the letter [ i ] and circumcision !
DLNT	Romans	2	28	For the Jew in the visible thing is not a Jew , nor is the circumcision in the visible [ j ] thing in the flesh circumcision ,
DLNT	Romans	2	29	but the Jew in the hidden thing is a Jew , and circumcision is of the heart , by [ k ] the Spirit not the letter— whose praise is not from people , but from God .

DLNT	Romans	3	2	Much in every way . For first— that they were entrusted the oracles [ a ] of God ! God Will Be Faithful To His Promises To The Jews Even If Some Reject Him
DLNT	Romans	3	4	May it never be ! But let God be [ seen to be ] true and every person a liar , just as it has been written [ in Ps 51:4 ] : “ So that You might be declared-righteous [ e ] in Your words and prevail in Your being judged [ f ] ” . But God Is Not Unrighteous To Inflict Wrath On Jews Who Sin
DLNT	Romans	3	5	But if our [ g ] unrighteousness demonstrates [ h ] the righteousness of God , what shall we say ? God , the One inflicting the wrath , is not unrighteous , is He ? ( I am speaking in accordance with human thinking [ i ] ) .
DLNT	Romans	3	6	May it never be ! Otherwise how will God judge the world ? God Holds Jews Accountable For Their Sin Too
DLNT	Romans	3	7	But if the truth of God abounded in my lie [ j ] to His glory , why am I also still being judged as a sinner ?
DLNT	Romans	3	8	Indeed , why not say “ Let us do evil things that good things may come ” , as we are blasphemed , and as some affirm us to say— whose condemnation is just [ k ] ! Scripture Declares All Are Accountable And Guilty Before God . None Are Righteous
DLNT	Romans	3	9	Therefore what ? Are we better [ l ] [ than they ] ? Not at-all . For we already-charged [ m ] that both Jews and Greeks are all under sin ,
DLNT	Romans	3	10	just as it has been written : “ There is not a righteous one , not even one .
DLNT	Romans	3	11	There is no one understanding . There is no one seeking-out God .
DLNT	Romans	3	12	They all turned-away , together they became useless [ n ] . There is no one doing goodness . There is not as-many-as one ” [ Ps 14:1-3 ] .

DLNT	Romans	3	20	Because by the works of law [ r ] no flesh will be declared-righteous in His sight . For through law comes the knowledge of sin . But Now Righteousness From God Has Been Revealed
DLNT	Romans	3	21	But now apart from law [ s ] , the righteousness of God has been revealed , being attested by the Law and the Prophets . It Comes As an Undeserved Gift Through Faith In Christ , Who Satisfied God ’ s Wrath
DLNT	Romans	3	22	And it is the righteousness of God through faith [ t ] in Jesus Christ for all the ones believing ! For there is no distinction ,
DLNT	Romans	3	23	for all sinned and are coming-short-of the glory of God ,

DLNT	Romans	3	27	Where then is the boasting ? It was shut-out [ ab ] . Through what kind of law [ ac ] ? Of works ? No , but through a law of faith .
DLNT	Romans	3	28	For we consider a person to be declared-righteous by faith apart from works of the Law .

DLNT	Romans	4	4	Now to the one working , the wages are not credited to him based-on grace , but based on debt .
DLNT	Romans	4	2	For if Abraham was declared-righteous by works , he has a boast— but not before God . His Righteousness Came By Faith
DLNT	Romans	4	3	For what does the Scripture say ? — “ And Abraham believed God , and it was credited to him for righteousness ” [ Gen 15:6 ] .
DLNT	Romans	4	5	But to the one not working but putting-faith upon the One declaring the ungodly righteous— his faith is credited for righteousness .
DLNT	Romans	4	6	Just as David also says [ in Ps 32:1-2 ] as to the blessedness of the person to whom God credits righteousness apart from works :
DLNT	Romans	4	7	“ Blessed are the ones whose lawless-deeds were forgiven and whose sins were covered .
DLNT	Romans	4	8	Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord will never count ” . This Occurred Prior To Circumcision
DLNT	Romans	4	9	So is this blessedness upon the circumcised , or upon the uncircumcised also ? For we say “ Faith was credited to Abraham for righteousness ” .
DLNT	Romans	4	10	How then was it credited— to one being in circumcision , or in uncircumcision ? Not in circumcision , but in uncircumcision !
DLNT	Romans	4	11	And he received the sign of circumcision , a seal of the righteousness of [ b ] faith while in uncircumcision , so that he might be [ c ] the father of all the ones believing through uncircumcision— so that righteousness might be credited also to them—
DLNT	Romans	4	12	and the father of the circumcised to the ones not of circumcision only , but indeed the ones walking-in-line in the footsteps of the faith of our father Abraham while he was in uncircumcision . The Promise Was Not Through The Law But Faith , Making It Firm To All
DLNT	Romans	4	13	For the promise to Abraham or to his seed [ d ] that he should be the inheritor of the world was not through the Law [ e ] , but through the righteousness of faith !
DLNT	Romans	4	14	For if the ones of the Law are inheritors , faith has been made-empty [ f ] and the promise has been nullified [ g ] .
DLNT	Romans	4	15	For the Law brings-about wrath . But where there is no Law , neither is there transgression [ h ] .
DLNT	Romans	4	16	For this reason it is by faith , in order that it may be based on grace , so that the promise might be firm [ i ] to all the seed— not to the seed of the Law only [ j ] , but also to the seed of the faith of Abraham , Abraham Is The Father of All Who Believe ... who is the father of us all—
DLNT	Romans	4	17	just as it has been written [ in Gen 17:5 ] that “ I have made you a father of many nations ” — before God [ k ] Whom he believed , the One giving-life-to the dead and calling the things not being as [ l ] being , He Believed God ’ s Promise , Contrary To All His Human Circumstances
DLNT	Romans	4	18	... who believed contrary-to [ m ] hope , upon hope , so that he might become [ n ] the father of many nations in accordance with the thing having been spoken [ in Gen 15:5 ] : “ So shall your seed be ” .
DLNT	Romans	4	19	And not having weakened in faith , he considered [ o ] his own body already having become impotent [ p ] , being about a hundred years old , and the deadness of the womb of Sarah .
DLNT	Romans	4	20	But he did not waver in unbelief with reference to the promise of God , but became-strong in faith— having given glory to God ,
DLNT	Romans	4	21	and having been fully-convinced that what He had promised He was able also to do . His Faith Was Credited To Him As Righteousness , And So Is Ours
DLNT	Romans	4	22	Therefore indeed it was credited to him for righteousness .
DLNT	Romans	4	23	And it was not written for his sake only that it was credited to him ,
DLNT	Romans	4	24	but also for our sake to whom it is going-to be credited— the ones putting-faith upon the One having raised Jesus our Lord from the dead ,

DLNT	Romans	5	2	through Whom also we have the access by faith into this grace in which we stand . And In Spite of Our Afflictions , Our Hope Will Not Disappoint Us , For God Loves Us And we are boasting over the hope of the glory of God .
DLNT	Romans	5	3	And not only this , but we also are boasting in the afflictions— knowing that the affliction is producing endurance ,
DLNT	Romans	5	4	and the endurance is producing approvedness , and the approvedness is producing hope ,
DLNT	Romans	5	6	For while we were still being weak , yet at the right-time , Christ died for ungodly ones .
DLNT	Romans	5	7	For one will rarely [ b ] die for a righteous person ; for [ c ] perhaps someone may even dare to die for the good person .
DLNT	Romans	5	8	But God demonstrates [ d ] His own love for us because while we were still being sinners , Christ died for us .

DLNT	Romans	5	15	But not as is the trespass , so also [ j ] is the grace-gift . For if by the trespass of the one man the many [ k ] died , by much more the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one man Jesus Christ abounded for the many . Death Reigned From One Sin .

DLNT	Romans	5	16	And not as [ l ] what resulted through one man having sinned is the given-gift . For the judgment is from one trespass [ m ] , resulting-in a verdict-of-condemnation ; but the grace-gift [ n ] is from many trespasses , resulting in a verdict-of-righteous [ o ] .

DLNT	Romans	8	15	For you did not receive a spirit [ u ] of slavery again leading-to fear , but you received a Spirit [ v ] of adoption by Whom we are crying-out “ Abba [ w ] ! Father ! ”
DLNT	Romans	8	16	The Spirit Himself bears-witness-with our spirit that we are children of God ! This Means We Are Joint-Heirs With Christ , Sharing His Suffering And Glory
DLNT	Romans	8	17	And if we are children , we are heirs also . We are heirs of God , and fellow-heirs of Christ , since [ x ] we are suffering-with Him in order that we may also be glorified-with Him .

DLNT	Romans	9	2	that there is great grief in me and unceasing pain in my heart .
DLNT	Romans	9	3	For I would pray [ a ] that I myself might be accursed from Christ for the sake of my brothers , my kinsmen according to the flesh—
DLNT	Romans	9	4	who are Israelites , of whom [ b ] is the adoption and the glory [ c ] and the covenants and the Law-giving and the [ temple ] service and the promises ,
DLNT	Romans	9	5	of whom are the fathers , and from whom is the Christ according-to [ d ] the flesh , the One being [ e ] over all , God , blessed forever , amen . But Not All Abraham ’ s Physical Children Are Children of God
DLNT	Romans	9	6	But it is not such as that the word of God has failed— for not all [ f ] these ones from Israel are Israel .
DLNT	Romans	9	7	Nor are they all children because they are seed of Abraham , but “ In Isaac a seed will be called for you ” [ Gen 21:12 ] .
DLNT	Romans	9	8	That is , these children of the flesh are not children of God , but the children of [ g ] the promise are counted for seed .
DLNT	Romans	9	10	And not only this , but there is also Rebekah having bed [ h ] from one man , Isaac our father .
DLNT	Romans	9	11	For the twins having not yet been born nor having done anything good or bad— in order that the purpose [ i ] of God according to His choosing [ j ] might continue [ k ] ,
DLNT	Romans	9	12	not of works but of the One calling— it was said to her [ in Gen 25:23 ] that “ the older will serve the younger ” .
DLNT	Romans	9	13	Just as it has been written [ in Mal 1:2-3 ] : “ I loved Jacob , but I hated Esau ” . God Has Mercy On Whom He Wants , And He Hardens Whom He Wants
DLNT	Romans	9	14	Therefore what shall we say ? There is not unrighteousness [ l ] with God , is there ? May it never be !
DLNT	Romans	9	15	For He says to Moses [ in Ex 33:19 ] , “ I will have-mercy-on whomever I have-mercy , and I will have-compassion-on whomever I have compassion ” .
DLNT	Romans	9	16	So then , mercy is not of [ m ] the one wanting , nor of the one running , but of the One having-mercy [ n ] — God .
DLNT	Romans	9	17	For the Scripture says to Pharaoh [ in Ex 9:16 ] that “ I raised you up for this very purpose : so that I might demonstrate My power [ o ] in you , and so that My name might be proclaimed in all the earth ” .
DLNT	Romans	9	18	So then , He has-mercy-on whom He wants , and He hardens [ p ] whom He wants . The Creator Is Making Known His Wrath And His Mercy In Humankind
DLNT	Romans	9	19	Therefore you will say to me , “ Why then does He still find-fault ? For who has resisted [ q ] His will ? ”
DLNT	Romans	9	20	O human , on the contrary , who are you , the one answering-back to God ? The thing formed will not say to the one having formed it , “ Why did you make me like-this ? ” , will it ?
DLNT	Romans	9	21	Or does not the potter have authority over the clay to make from the same lump one vessel for honor and another for dishonor ?
DLNT	Romans	9	22	But what if God , wanting [ r ] to demonstrate His wrath and to make-known His power , bore [ s ] with much patience vessels of wrath having been prepared [ t ] for destruction ,
DLNT	Romans	9	23	and did so in order that He might make-known the riches of His glory upon vessels of mercy which He prepared-beforehand [ u ] for glory—
DLNT	Romans	9	24	even us whom He called not only from the Jews , but also from the Gentiles ? He Is Making Those Not His People His Own Children
DLNT	Romans	9	25	As [ v ] He says also in Hosea : “ I will call ‘ Not My people ’ , ‘ My people ’ ; and ‘ Not having been loved ’ , ‘ Having been loved ’ ” [ Hos 2:23 ] .
DLNT	Romans	9	26	“ And it shall be in the place where it was said to them ‘ you are not My people ’ , there they will be called sons of the living God ” [ Hos 1:10 ] . But Only a Remnant of Israel Will Be Saved
DLNT	Romans	9	27	But [ w ] Isaiah cries-out concerning Israel : “ If the number of the sons of Israel should be like the sand of the sea , the remnant will be saved .
DLNT	Romans	9	28	For the Lord will accomplish [ x ] His word upon the earth , completing [ y ] and cutting-short [ z ] ” [ in Isa 10:22-23 ] .
DLNT	Romans	9	29	And just as Isaiah said-before [ in Isa 1:9 ] : “ Unless the Lord of Sabaoth had left-behind a seed for us , we would have become like Sodom , and we would have been likened [ aa ] as Gomorrah ” . Israel Pursued a Righteousness Through The Law , And Did Not Attain It
DLNT	Romans	9	30	Therefore , what shall we say ? That Gentiles , the ones not pursuing righteousness , took-hold-of [ ab ] righteousness— but a righteousness by faith .
DLNT	Romans	9	31	But Israel , pursuing the Law of righteousness , did not attain to that Law .
DLNT	Romans	9	32	For what reason ? Because they pursued it not by faith , but as-if it was by works . They stumbled on the Stone of stumbling ,
DLNT	Romans	9	33	just as it has been written [ in Isa 28:16 ] : “ Behold— I am laying in Zion a Stone of stumbling and a Rock of falling .

DLNT	Romans	13	13	Let us walk properly [ u ] as in the day [ v ] — not in revelries [ w ] and drunkenness [ x ] , not in beds [ y ] and sensualities , not in strife and jealousy ,
DLNT	Romans	13	2	So then the one opposing [ c ] the authority has resisted [ d ] the ordinance [ e ] of God . And the ones having resisted will receive [ f ] judgment on themselves . Rulers are God ’ s Servants To Reward Good And Punish Evil
DLNT	Romans	13	3	For the rulers are not a fear to good work , but to evil [ g ] . Now do you want to not be fearing the authority ? Be doing good , and you will have praise [ h ] from him [ i ] —
DLNT	Romans	13	4	for he is God ’ s servant to you for good . But if you are doing evil , be fearing ! For he does not bear [ j ] the sword in-vain [ k ] — for he is God ’ s servant , an avenger for wrath on the one practicing evil .
DLNT	Romans	13	5	Therefore it is a necessity to be subject— not only because of the wrath [ l ] , but also because of the conscience . So Give Them Their Due
DLNT	Romans	13	6	For because of this also you pay tributes [ m ] . For they are ministers [ n ] of God devoting-themselves to this very thing .
DLNT	Romans	13	7	Give-back to all authorities the things owed— the tribute to the one owed the tribute , the tax [ o ] to the one owed the tax , the fear [ p ] to the one owed the fear , the honor to the one owed the honor . Pay Your Ongoing Debt of Love

DLNT	Romans	13	9	For the saying “ You shall not commit-adultery , you shall not murder , you shall not steal , you shall not covet ” [ Ex 20:13-17 ] , and if there is any other commandment , is summed-up in this saying— in the “ You shall love your neighbor as yourself ” [ Lev 19:18 ] .

DLNT	Romans	14	3	Let not the one eating be treating-with-contempt [ e ] the one not eating . And let not the one not eating be judging [ f ] the one eating— for God accepted him .
DLNT	Romans	14	4	Who are you , the one judging a household-servant belonging-to-another ? To his own master he stands or falls . And he will stand , for the Lord is able to make him stand . Live For The Lord As You Think Best , For Each of Us Will Give an Account To God
DLNT	Romans	14	5	For one judges a day beyond a day [ g ] , but another judges every day alike . Let each one be fully-convinced in his own mind [ h ] .
DLNT	Romans	14	6	The one thinking [ i ] as to the day , is thinking for the Lord . And the one eating , is eating for the Lord— for he gives-thanks to God . And the one not eating , is not eating for the Lord— and he gives-thanks to God .
DLNT	Romans	14	7	For [ j ] none of us lives for himself , and none dies for himself .
DLNT	Romans	14	8	For if we live , we live for the Lord ; and if we die , we die for the Lord . Therefore if we live and if we die , we are the Lord ’ s .
DLNT	Romans	14	9	For Christ died and came-to-life for this : that He might be-Lord both of dead and living ones .
DLNT	Romans	14	10	But why are you judging your brother ? Or why also are you treating your brother with contempt ? For we will all stand before the judgment-seat of God .
DLNT	Romans	14	11	For it has been written [ in Isa 45:23 ] : “ As I live ” , says the Lord , “ every knee will bow to Me . And every tongue will confess-out to God ” .
DLNT	Romans	14	12	So then , each of us will give an account for himself to God . Don ’ t Let Your Good Choices Cause Spiritual Harm To Others ; Walk In Love

DLNT	Romans	14	15	For if your brother is grieved [ s ] because of food , you are no longer walking according-to love . Do not be destroying with [ t ] your food that one for whom Christ died .
DLNT	Romans	14	16	Therefore do not be letting your good thing be blasphemed [ u ] .
DLNT	Romans	14	17	For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking , but righteousness [ v ] and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit .
DLNT	Romans	14	18	For the one serving [ w ] Christ in this is pleasing to God and approved by people . Let Us Be Pursuing Peace And Things That Build Up , Not Things That Tear Down
DLNT	Romans	14	19	So then , let us be pursuing the things of [ x ] peace and the things of edification for one another .
DLNT	Romans	14	20	Do not be tearing-down the work of God for the sake of food . All things are clean— but it is evil for the person eating with an opportunity-for-stumbling .
DLNT	Romans	14	21	It is good not to eat meats , nor to drink wine , nor to do anything by which your brother stumbles . Hold To Your Convictions , But Carry The Weak . Don ’ t Just Please Yourselves

My Ministry of The Gospel To Gentiles Who Have Not Heard Is My Boast And My Ambition
DLNT	Romans	15	17	I then have this boasting [ n ] in Christ Jesus as to the things pertaining to God—

DLNT	1%20Corinthians	1	2	to the church of God being in Corinth , to ones having been sanctified [ b ] in Christ Jesus , called saints [ c ] , with all the ones calling-upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place , their Lord and ours :
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	1	3	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	1	4	I am giving-thanks to my God always for you for the grace of God having been given to you in Christ Jesus ,
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	1	5	because you were enriched in everything in [ d ] Him— in all speech [ e ] and all knowledge ,
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	1	6	even as the testimony of [ f ] Christ was confirmed [ g ] in [ h ] you—
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	1	7	so that you are not lacking in any gift while eagerly-awaiting the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	1	8	Who also will confirm you until the end so as to be blameless [ i ] on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	1	9	God is faithful , through Whom you were called into fellowship with His Son , Jesus Christ our Lord . Brothers , Be of One Mind ; Stop Dividing Over Your Leaders
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	1	10	Now I exhort you , brothers , by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that you all be speaking the same thing , and that there not be divisions among you , but that you be made-complete [ j ] in the same mind [ k ] and in the same purpose [ l ] .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	1	11	For it was made-clear to me concerning you , my brothers , by the ones [ m ] of Chloe , that there are quarrels among you .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	1	12	Now I mean this : that each of you is saying “ I am of Paul ” , and “ I of Apollos ” , and “ I of Cephas ” , and “ I of Christ ” . Has Christ Been Divided ? Were You Baptized Into Paul ? Thankfully , I Did Not Baptize You !
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	1	13	Has Christ been divided ? Paul was not crucified for you , was he ? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul ?
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	1	14	I give-thanks to God that I baptized none of you , except Crispus and Gaius ,
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	1	15	so that no one may say that you were baptized in my name !
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	1	16	Now I baptized also the household of Stephanas . As to the rest , I do not know if I baptized any other . For I Was Not Sent To Baptize , But To Announce The Gospel Without Wisdom of Speech
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	1	17	For Christ did not send me forth to be baptizing , but to be announcing-the-good-news— not in wisdom of speech , in order that the cross of Christ may not be made-empty [ n ] . For God Intends The Gospel To Be Both Foolishness And Powerful
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	1	18	For the speech [ o ] of the cross is foolishness to the ones perishing , but is the power of God to us being saved .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	1	19	For it has been written [ in Isa 29:14 ] : “ I will destroy the wisdom of the wise ones , and I will set-aside the intelligence [ p ] of the intelligent ones ” .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	1	20	Where is the wise one ? Where is the scribe [ q ] ? Where is the debater of this age ? Did not God make-foolish the wisdom of the world ? For God Saves Those Who Believe The “ Foolishness ” of Christ Crucified
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	1	21	For since , in the wisdom of God , the world through its wisdom did not know [ r ] God , God was well-pleased through the foolishness of [ s ] the proclamation to save the ones believing .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	1	22	Because indeed Jews are asking-for signs and Greeks are seeking wisdom ,
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	1	23	but we are proclaiming Christ crucified [ t ] — to Jews , an offense ; and to Gentiles , foolishness ;
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	1	24	but to the called ones themselves , both Jews and Greeks , Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	1	25	Because the foolish thing [ u ] of God is wiser than humans , and the weak thing of God is stronger than humans . God Chose To Save The Foolish And Weak To Shame Human Self-Effort
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	1	26	For look-at [ v ] your calling , brothers— that there are not many wise according-to [ w ] the flesh , not many powerful , not many well-born [ x ] .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	1	27	But God chose [ y ] the foolish things of the world in order that He might be putting the wise ones to shame . And God chose the weak things of the world in order that He might be putting the strong things to shame .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	1	28	And God chose the low-born [ z ] things of the world , and the things having been treated-with-contempt [ aa ] — the things not being [ ab ] , in order that He might bring-to-nothing the things being ,
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	1	29	so that no flesh may boast in the sight of God .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	1	30	But by Him you are in Christ Jesus , Who became wisdom to us from God— both righteousness and holiness [ ac ] , and redemption—
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	1	31	in order that just as it has been written [ in Jer 9:24 ] , “ Let the one boasting be boasting in the Lord ” . Footnotes -

DLNT	1%20Corinthians	2	2	For I determined not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ— and this One having been crucified .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	2	3	And I was [ c ] with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	2	4	And my speech and my proclamation was not in persuasive words of wisdom , but in demonstration [ d ] of [ e ] the Spirit and power ,
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	2	5	in order that your faith might not be in the wisdom of humans but in the power of God . Yet We Are Speaking God ’ s Wisdom To The Mature
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	2	6	Yet we are speaking wisdom among the mature , but a wisdom not of this age , nor of the rulers of this age— the ones being brought-to-nothing .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	2	7	Rather we are speaking God ’ s wisdom in a mystery ; the wisdom having been hidden which God predestined before the ages for our glory ,
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	2	8	which none of the rulers of this age has understood . For if they had understood , they would not have crucified the Lord of glory .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	2	9	But it [ f ] is just as it has been written : “ Things which an eye did not see and an ear did not hear , and which did not come-up [ g ] on the heart of a human— which God prepared for the ones loving Him ” . God Revealed This Wisdom To Us Through His Spirit
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	2	10	And God revealed it [ h ] to us through the Spirit . For the Spirit searches all things , even the deep things of God .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	2	11	For who among people knows the things of the person except the spirit of the person within him ? In this manner also , no one has known the things of God except the Spirit of God .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	2	12	And we did not receive the spirit of the world , but the Spirit from God , in order that we might know the things having been freely-given to us by God—
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	2	13	things which we also are speaking not in words taught by human wisdom , but in words taught by the Spirit , combining [ i ] spiritual things with spiritual words .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	2	14	But a natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God . For they are foolishness to him and he is not able to understand , because they are spiritually examined [ j ] .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	2	15	But the spiritual person examines all things , yet he himself is examined by no one [ k ] .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	2	16	For “ who knew the mind of the Lord ? Who will instruct Him ? ” [ Isa 40:13 ] , and we have the mind of Christ ! Footnotes -

DLNT	1%20Corinthians	3	3	for you are still fleshly [ b ] . For where there is jealousy and strife among you , are you not fleshly and walking in accordance with human thinking [ c ] ?
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	3	2	I gave you milk to drink , not food , for you were not yet able . But not-even still now are you able ,
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	3	4	For whenever one says “ I am of Paul ” , and another “ I am of Apollos ” , are you not [ mere ] humans ? So What Are Apollos And Paul ? Servants Planting And Watering Seed For God
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	3	5	Therefore , what is Apollos ? And what is Paul ? — servants through whom you believed , even as the Lord gave to each one .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	3	6	I planted , Apollos watered , but God was causing-growth .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	3	7	So then neither is the one planting anything , nor the one watering , but God causing the growth .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	3	8	And the one planting and the one watering are one [ d ] , but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor . We Are Workers In God ’ s Building . Be Careful How You Build On The Foundation
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	3	9	For we are God ’ s fellow-workers [ e ] ; you are God ’ s farm , God ’ s building .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	3	10	I laid a foundation according-to [ f ] the grace of God having been given to me as a wise master-builder , and another is building-upon it . But let each one be watching-out how he builds-upon it .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	3	11	For no one can lay another foundation other than the one which is laid , which is Jesus Christ .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	3	12	And if one builds gold , silver , precious stones , wood , hay , straw upon the foundation ,
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	3	13	each one ’ s work will become evident . For the day will make it clear [ g ] , because it is revealed by fire . And the fire itself will test what-sort each one ’ s work is .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	3	14	If one ’ s work which he built-upon it shall remain , he will receive a reward .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	3	15	If one ’ s work shall be burned-up , he will suffer-loss [ h ] . But he himself will be saved , yet so as through fire .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	3	16	Do you not know that you are God ’ s temple and the Spirit of God is dwelling in you ?
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	3	17	If anyone ruins [ i ] the temple of God , God will ruin this one . For the temple of God is holy— which you are ! Don ’ t Be Deceived . The World ’ s Wisdom Is Foolishness To God
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	3	18	Let no one be deceiving himself . If anyone among you thinks that he is wise in this age , let him become foolish in order that he may become wise .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	3	19	For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God . For it has been written [ in Job 5:13 ] , “ He is the One catching the wise in their craftiness [ j ] ” ;
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	3	20	and again [ in Ps 94:11 ] , “ The Lord knows the thoughts [ k ] of the wise , that they are futile ” . So Don ’ t Boast In People . All God ’ s Servants Belong To You
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	3	21	So then , let no one be boasting in people . For all things are yours—
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	3	22	whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things coming— all things are yours .

DLNT	1%20Corinthians	4	4	For I am conscious of nothing against myself , but I have not been declared-right [ h ] by this , but the One examining me is the Lord .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	4	2	Here [ d ] , furthermore , it is sought in [ e ] stewards that one be found faithful [ f ] .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	4	3	Now to me , it is a very small thing that I should be examined [ g ] by you , or by a human day of judgment . But I do not even examine myself !
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	4	5	So then do not be judging anything before the time , until the Lord comes , Who will both [ i ] illuminate the hidden things of the darkness and reveal the motives [ j ] of the hearts . And at-that-time the praise [ k ] will come to each one from God . Brothers , Learn From Apollos And Paul Not To Be Puffed Up About God ’ s Ministers
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	4	6	Now brothers , I applied [ l ] these things to myself and Apollos for your sakes , in order that in us you might learn the saying “ Do not go [ m ] beyond the things which have been written ” — in order that you might not be puffed-up , one on behalf of the one against the other .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	4	7	For who discerns [ n ] you to be superior ? And what do you have that you did not receive ? But if indeed you received it , why do you boast as-though not having received it ? For God Has Displayed Us Apostles As Last And Lowest In This World
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	4	8	You are already satisfied [ o ] ! You already became-rich ! You became-kings [ p ] without us ! And o-that indeed you became-kings , in order that we also might reign with you .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	4	9	For I think God displayed [ q ] us the apostles as last [ r ] , like ones condemned-to-death— because we were-made [ s ] a spectacle [ t ] to the world , both to angels and to people .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	4	10	We are foolish ones for the sake of Christ , but you are wise ones in Christ . We are weak ones , but you are strong ones . You are distinguished ones , but we are dishonored ones .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	4	11	Until the present hour indeed we hunger , and thirst , and are naked [ u ] , and are beaten , and live-transiently [ v ] ,
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	4	12	and labor— working with our own hands .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	4	13	While being reviled [ w ] , we bless ; while being persecuted , we endure ; while being slandered , we conciliate [ x ] . We were-made [ y ] like the sweepings [ z ] of the world , the scum [ aa ] of all things , up to now . I Am Writing To Admonish You As My Children . Be Imitators of Me
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	4	14	I am writing these things not shaming you , but admonishing you as my beloved children .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	4	15	For if you should have ten-thousand tutors [ ab ] in Christ , yet you do not have many fathers . For I fathered you in Christ Jesus through the good-news .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	4	16	Therefore I exhort you— be [ ac ] imitators of me .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	4	17	For this reason I sent Timothy to you , who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord , who will remind you as to my ways in Christ Jesus , just as I am teaching everywhere in every church .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	4	18	Now some were puffed-up as-if I were not coming to you .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	4	19	But I will come to you soon , if the Lord wills . And I shall come-to-know not the talk [ ad ] of the ones having been puffed-up , but the power .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	4	20	For the kingdom of God is not in [ ae ] talk , but in power .

DLNT	1%20Corinthians	5	9	I wrote you in the letter [ g ] not to associate-with [ h ] sexually-immoral ones—
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	5	10	not at-all meaning with the sexually-immoral ones of this world , or with the greedy and swindlers [ i ] , or with idolaters , because then you would have to go out of the world !

DLNT	1%20Corinthians	7	5	Do not be depriving one another— except perhaps by agreement , for a time , in order that you may devote-yourselves to prayer and [ then ] be together again— in order that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack-of-self-control .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	7	6	But I am saying this by way of concession , not by way of command .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	7	8	And I say to the unmarried and the widows— it is good for them if they remain as I also am .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	7	9	But if they do not have-self-control , let them marry . For it is better to marry than to be burning [ f ] . But Do Not Divorce Your Christian Spouse
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	7	10	But to the ones having married I command ( not I , but the Lord ) , that a wife not be separated from her husband—
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	7	11	but if indeed she is separated , let her remain unmarried or let her be reconciled to her husband— and that a husband not leave [ g ] his wife . Do Not Divorce an Unbelieving Spouse Who Chooses To Stay
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	7	12	But to the rest I say , not [ h ] the Lord— if any brother has an unbelieving wife and this one consents to dwell with him , let him not leave her .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	7	13	And if any woman has an unbelieving husband and this one consents to dwell with her , let her not leave her husband .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	7	14	For the unbelieving husband has been sanctified [ i ] by his wife . And the unbelieving wife has been sanctified by the brother . Otherwise then your children are unclean , but now [ j ] they are holy .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	7	15	But if the unbelieving one separates , let such a one separate . The brother or the sister has not been enslaved by such [ k ] things , but God has called you in peace .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	7	16	For how do you know , wife , whether you will save your husband ? Or how do you know , husband , whether you will save your wife ?
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	7	17	Except that [ l ] as the Lord apportioned [ m ] to each one , as God has called each one , in this manner let him be walking . And thus I am directing [ n ] in all the churches . In General , Remain With God In The Life Context In Which You Were Saved
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	7	18	Was anyone called having been circumcised ? Let him not conceal [ o ] it . Has anyone been called in uncircumcision ? Let him not be circumcised .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	7	19	Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing , but the keeping of the commandments of God .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	7	20	Each in the calling in which he was called— in this let him remain .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	7	21	Were you called as a slave ? Do not let it be a concern to you . But if also [ p ] you are able to become free , rather make-use-of the opportunity .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	7	22	For the one having been called in the Lord as a slave is a freedperson of the Lord . Likewise the one having been called as a free one is a slave of Christ .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	7	23	You were bought with a price ; do not become slaves [ q ] of people .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	7	24	Each in what he was called , brothers— in this let him remain with God . Concerning The Unmarried : In General , It Is Good To Remain As You Are In Life
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	7	25	Now concerning virgins , I do not have a command from the Lord , but I am giving an opinion as one having been shown-mercy by the Lord to be trustworthy .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	7	26	I think then that this [ r ] is good because of the present necessity [ s ] , that it is good for a person to be so [ t ] .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	7	27	Have you been bound [ u ] to a woman ? Do not be seeking a release [ v ] . Have you been released [ w ] from a woman ? Do not be seeking a wife .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	7	28	But even if you marry , you did not sin . And if the virgin marries , she did not sin . But such ones will have affliction in the flesh , and I am sparing [ x ] you . We All Must Keep Our Earthly Life In Eternal Perspective
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	7	29	And this I say , brothers— the time [ y ] is shortened , so that henceforth even the ones having wives should be as-though not having ,
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	7	30	and the ones weeping as-though not weeping , and the ones rejoicing as-though not rejoicing , and the ones buying as-though not holding-on-to [ z ] ,
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	7	31	and the ones making-use-of the world as-though not making-full-use-of it . For the form [ aa ] of this world is passing away . Single People Can Be Solely Devoted To God ; The Married Have a Dual Concern
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	7	32	Now I want you to be free-from-concern . The unmarried man is concerned-about the things of the Lord— how he may please the Lord .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	7	33	But the man having married is concerned-about the things of the world— how he may please his wife ,
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	7	34	and he has been divided [ ab ] . And the unmarried woman [ ac ] , and the virgin , is concerned-about the things of the Lord— that she may be holy both in the body and in the spirit . But the woman having married is concerned-about the things of the world— how she may please her husband . Do What You Think Is Honorable For Your Virgin Daughter

DLNT	1%20Corinthians	7	36	But if one [ ag ] thinks that he is behaving-dishonorably [ ah ] toward his virgin daughter— if she is beyond-the-bloom-of-youth [ ai ] , and it ought [ aj ] to be so— let him do what he wants . He is not sinning . Let them marry .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	7	37	But he who stands steadfast [ ak ] in his heart , not having a necessity [ al ] , and has authority [ am ] concerning [ an ] his own will , and has determined this in his own heart , to keep [ ao ] his virgin daughter— he will do well [ ap ] .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	7	38	So then , both the one giving his virgin daughter in marriage is doing well , and the one not giving-in-marriage will do better . Widows Are Free To Remarry , But May Be Happier Remaining As They Are
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	7	39	A wife has been bound for as much time as her husband lives . But if her husband falls-asleep , she is free to be married to whom she wishes— only in the Lord .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	7	40	But she is happier if she remains thus [ aq ] , according to my opinion ; and I also think that I have the Spirit of God . Footnotes -

DLNT	1%20Corinthians	8	2	If anyone thinks that he has come-to-know anything , he did not-yet know as he ought-to know .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	8	3	But if one loves [ b ] God , this one has been known by Him .

DLNT	1%20Corinthians	8	7	But this knowledge is not in all people . But some , by the accustomed-habit [ f ] of the idol until now , eat this food as [ g ] food-sacrificed-to-an-idol . And their conscience , being weak , is stained [ h ] .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	8	9	But be watching-out that this right [ k ] of yours does not somehow become an opportunity-for-stumbling to the weak ones .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	8	10	For if someone sees you , the one having knowledge , reclining [ to eat ] in an idol-temple , will not his conscience , being weak , be built-up so as to eat the foods-sacrificed-to-idols ?
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	8	11	For the one being weak is being destroyed [ l ] by your knowledge— the brother for the sake of whom Christ died !
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	8	12	And in this manner sinning against the brothers and striking [ m ] their conscience while being weak , you are sinning against Christ . On The One Hand , I Will Not Do Anything That Hinders People ’ s Spiritual Advance

DLNT	1%20Corinthians	9	11	If we sowed spiritual things to you , is it a great thing if we shall reap fleshly [ i ] things from you ?
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	9	12	If others partake of this right over you , should we not more ? But I Chose Not To Make Use Of This Right So As Not To Hinder The Gospel Nevertheless , we did not make-use-of [ j ] this right .

DLNT	1%20Corinthians	9	19	For [ s ] while being free from all people , I enslaved myself to all in order that I might gain the more .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	9	20	Indeed I became to the Jews as a Jew , in order that I might gain Jews ; to the ones under the Law , as under the Law— not being myself under the Law— in order that I might gain the ones under the Law ;

DLNT	1%20Corinthians	10	18	Look-at Israel according to the flesh— are not the ones eating the sacrifices sharers of the altar ?
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	10	19	Therefore what am I saying ? That [ i ] food-sacrificed-to-an-idol is anything , or that an idol is anything ?
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	10	20	On the contrary , that the things which they are sacrificing , they are sacrificing to demons , and not [ j ] to God . And I do not want you to be sharers of the demons .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	10	21	You can not drink the Lord ’ s cup and the demons ’ cup . You can not [ k ] partake of the Lord ’ s table and the demons ’ table .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	10	22	Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy ? We are not stronger than He , are we ? So As To The Eating of Meat , Do What Is Beneficial And Edifying To Those Eating

DLNT	1%20Corinthians	12	9	to a different one , faith by the same Spirit ; and to another , gifts of [ n ] healings by the one Spirit ;
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	12	10	and to another , things-worked [ o ] by miracles ; and to another , prophecy [ p ] ; and to another , discernments [ q ] of spirits ; to a different one , kinds of tongues [ r ] ; and to another , interpretation [ s ] of tongues .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	12	11	But the one and the same Spirit works [ t ] all these things , distributing to each one individually [ u ] , just as He wills [ v ] . For The Body of Christ Is Like The Human Body
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	12	13	For indeed with [ x ] one Spirit , we all were baptized into one body [ y ] — whether Jews or Greeks , whether slaves or free . And we all were given one Spirit to drink . It Has Many Body Parts Placed By God
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	12	14	For indeed the body is not one body-part , but many .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	12	15	If the foot should say “ Because I am not a hand , I am not a part of the body ” , it is not for this reason not a part of the body .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	12	16	And if the ear should say “ Because I am not an eye , I am not a part of the body ” , it is not for this reason not a part of the body .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	12	17	If the whole body were an eye , where would the hearing be ? If the whole were an ear , where would the smelling be ?
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	12	18	But now [ z ] , God placed the body-parts— each one of them— in the body , just as He wanted .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	12	19	And if all were one body-part , where would the body be ? All Body Parts Are Needed For The Healthy Functioning of The One Body
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	12	20	But now , there are many body-parts— but one body !
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	12	21	And the eye can not say to the hand , “ I do not have need of you ” . Or again the head to the feet , “ I do not have need of you ” .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	12	22	On the contrary , much rather the body-parts of the body seeming to be weaker are necessary .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	12	23	And the things of the body which we are thinking to be more-without-honor , on these we are putting-on [ aa ] more honor . Indeed our private [ ab ] parts have more [ ac ] presentability [ ad ] ,
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	12	24	but our presentable parts have no need [ ae ] . But God blended-together the body , having given more honor to the body-part lacking ,
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	12	25	in order that there should not be division in the body , but that the body-parts should be having the same concern for one another .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	12	26	And if one body-part is suffering , all the body-parts are suffering-with it . If one body-part is being glorified , all the body-parts are rejoicing-with it . You Are The Parts of Christ ’ s Body , Placed Where You Are By God
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	12	27	And you are the body of Christ , and body-parts in part [ af ] .

DLNT	1%20Corinthians	13	8	Love never fails . But if there are prophecies , they will be set-aside [ h ] . If there are tongues , they will cease [ i ] . If there is knowledge , it will be set-aside .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	13	9	For we know in part , and we prophesy in part—
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	13	10	but when the complete [ j ] thing comes , the thing in part will be set-aside .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	13	11	When I was a child , I was speaking like a child , thinking like a child , counting [ k ] like [ l ] a child— when I have become [ m ] a man , I have set-aside the things of the child .

DLNT	1%20Corinthians	14	2	; or more specifically , a sign of God ’ s judgment on Israel , as in Isaiah
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	14	3	But the one prophesying is speaking edification and exhortation and consolation [ g ] to people .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	14	4	The one speaking in a tongue is edifying himself [ h ] , but the one prophesying is edifying the church .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	14	5	And I wish [ i ] that you all were speaking in tongues , but even-more [ j ] that you might be prophesying . But [ k ] the one prophesying is greater [ l ] than one speaking in tongues— unless [ m ] he interprets in order that the church may receive edification . Speaking In Tongues Is Just Speaking Into The Air Unless It Is Understood
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	14	6	But now [ n ] , brothers , if I come to you speaking [ o ] in tongues , what will I profit you unless I speak to you either [ p ] by [ q ] a revelation or by knowledge or by a prophecy or by a teaching ?
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	14	7	Likewise the lifeless things giving a sound— whether a flute or harp— if it does not give a distinction in the tones , how will the thing being fluted or the thing being harped be known ?
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	14	8	For indeed , if a trumpet gives an uncertain sound , who will prepare himself for battle ?
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	14	9	So also you with the tongue— if you do not give a clear word , how will the thing being spoken be known ? For you will be speaking into the air !
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	14	10	There are perhaps so-many kinds of spoken sounds [ r ] in the world , and none is meaningless .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	14	11	If then I do not know the force of the spoken sound , I will be a barbarian to the one speaking , and the one speaking a barbarian with me .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	14	12	. -
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	14	13	Therefore let the one speaking in a tongue pray in order that he might interpret .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	14	15	What then [ x ] is to be done ? I will pray with the spirit , and [ y ] I will also pray with the mind . I will sing-praise with the spirit , and I will also sing-praise with the mind .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	14	16	Otherwise , if you are blessing [ z ] with your spirit [ aa ] [ only ] , how will the one filling the place of the uninstructed [ ab ] say the “ Amen ” at your thanksgiving , since he does not know what you are saying ?
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	14	17	For you are giving-thanks well [ ac ] — but the other person is not being edified .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	14	18	,
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	14	19	But in church [ ad ] , I want to speak five words with my mind in order that I might also instruct others , rather than ten-thousand words in a tongue . Tongues Are a Sign For Unbelievers ; Prophecy Is For Believers
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	14	20	Brothers , do not be children in your understanding . But be childlike in evilness , and be mature in your understanding .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	14	21	It has been written in the Law [ in Isa 28:11-12 ] that “ I will speak to this people by people of other-tongues , and by the lips of others . And not even in this manner will they listen-to Me , says the Lord ” .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	14	22	, or privately . -
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	14	23	Therefore , if the whole church comes-together at the same place , and they all speak in tongues [ af ] , and uninstructed ones or unbelievers come-in , will they not say that you are mad [ ag ] ?
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	14	24	But if they all prophesy [ ah ] , and some unbeliever or an uninstructed one comes in , he is convicted [ ai ] by all . He is examined by all .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	14	25	The hidden things of his heart become evident [ aj ] . And thus , having fallen on his face , he will give-worship to God , declaring that God is really among you . Brothers , Organize Your Church Service For Edification

DLNT	1%20Corinthians	14	34	let the women be silent [ ay ] in the churches . For it is not permitted for them to speak [ az ] . But let them be subject , just as the Law also says [ ba ] .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	14	35	And if they want to learn anything , let them question their own husbands at home . For it is shameful for a woman to speak in church . These Instructions Are The Lord ’ s Commandments
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	14	36	Or did the word of God go-forth from you ? Or did it reach to you only ?
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	14	37	If anyone thinks that he is a prophet or a spiritual person , let him acknowledge the things which I am writing to you— that they are a commandment of the Lord .

DLNT	1%20Corinthians	15	15	and we are even found to be false-witnesses of [ j ] God , because we testified against [ k ] God that He did raise Christ— Whom He did not raise if-indeed then dead ones are not raised .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	15	2	through which you also are being saved— if [ a ] you are holding-on in that message I announced-as-good-news to you , unless [ b ] you believed in-vain .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	15	3	For I delivered to you among the first [ c ] things what I also received : that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures ,
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	15	4	and that He was buried , and that He has been raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures ,
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	15	5	and that He appeared to Cephas , then to the twelve .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	15	6	After that He appeared to over five-hundred brothers at-one-time , of whom the majority are remaining until now . But some fell-asleep .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	15	7	After that He appeared to James , then to all the apostles .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	15	8	And last of all , as-if-indeed [ d ] to the untimely-born [ e ] one , He appeared to me also .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	15	9	For I am the least of the apostles— who am not fit to be called an apostle , because I persecuted the church of God .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	15	10	But by the grace of God I am what I am . And His grace toward me did not become [ f ] empty [ g ] . But I labored even more than them all— yet not I , but the grace of God with me .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	15	11	So whether it was I or those , thus we are proclaiming , and thus you believed . So If Christ Was Raised , Why Do Some of You Say There Is No Resurrection ?
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	15	12	. -
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	15	13	Now if there is no resurrection of dead ones , neither has Christ been raised .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	15	14	And if Christ has not been raised , then our proclamation is also empty ; your faith is also empty ;
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	15	16	For if dead ones are not raised , neither has Christ been raised .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	15	17	. -
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	15	18	Then also the ones having fallen-asleep in Christ perished [ l ] .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	15	19	If we are ones having hoped in Christ in this life only , we are more pitiable [ m ] than all people . But Christ Has Been Raised As The Firstfruit of Those Yet To Be Raised
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	15	20	But now , Christ has been raised from the dead— the firstfruit [ n ] of the ones having fallen-asleep .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	15	21	For since death came through a man , the resurrection of dead ones also came through a man .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	15	22	For just as in [ o ] Adam all die , so also in Christ all will be given-life [ p ] ,
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	15	23	but each in his own order [ q ] : Christ the firstfruit ; after-that [ r ] the ones of [ s ] Christ at His coming .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	15	24	Then [ t ] comes the end— when He hands-over the kingdom to His God and Father , when He [ u ] has abolished all [ v ] rule and all authority and power .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	15	25	For He [ w ] must reign until which time He [ x ] has put all the enemies under His feet .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	15	26	Death , the last enemy , is abolished [ y ] —
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	15	27	for “ He [ z ] subjected all things under His [ aa ] feet ” [ Ps 8:6 ] . But when He says [ ab ] that “ All things have been subjected ” , it is clear that this is except the One [ ac ] having subjected all things to Him .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	15	28	But when all things are subjected to Him , then the Son Himself also will be subjected to the One [ ad ] having subjected all things to Him , in order that God may be all things in all . Otherwise , Why Be Concerned About The Dead Or Risk Our Lives ?
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	15	29	Otherwise [ ae ] , what will the ones being baptized for [ af ] the dead do ? If dead ones are not raised at-all , why indeed are they baptized for them ?
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	15	30	Why indeed [ ag ] are we in danger every hour ?
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	15	31	I die [ ah ] daily— by [ ai ] your boasting , brothers , which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	15	32	If in accordance with human [ aj ] thinking I fought-wild-animals [ ak ] at Ephesus , what is the profit to me ? If dead ones are not raised , “ Let us eat and drink , for tomorrow we die ” [ Isa 22:13 ] . Don ’ t Be Deceived . Sober Up
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	15	33	Do not be deceived : bad companionships [ al ] corrupt good habits [ am ] .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	15	34	Sober-up [ an ] righteously [ ao ] and do not be [ ap ] sinning , for some have an ignorance of God . I speak to your shame . How Are The Dead Raised , And With What Kind of Body ?
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	15	35	But someone will say , “ How are the dead raised ? And with what kind of body do they come ? ” What You Sow Must Die , And Then God Gives It New Life In a Different Body
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	15	36	Foolish one ! What you sow is not given-life unless it dies .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	15	37	And as to what you sow— you do not sow the body which will come , but a bare seed , perhaps of wheat or of some of the rest .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	15	38	And God gives it a body just as He willed— indeed , to each of the seeds its own body [ aq ] .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	15	39	Not all flesh is the same flesh . But there is one of humans , and another flesh of livestock , and another flesh of birds , and another of fish .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	15	40	And there are heavenly [ ar ] bodies and earthly bodies . But the glory of the heavenly is one kind , and the glory of the earthly is different .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	15	41	There is one glory of the sun , and another glory of the moon , and another glory of the stars . For star differs from star in glory . So Also Is The Resurrection of The Dead . We Are Raised In a Heavenly Body
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	15	42	So also is the resurrection of the dead . It is sown in decay [ as ] ; it is raised in undecayability [ at ] .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	15	43	It is sown in dishonor ; it is raised in glory . It is sown in weakness ; it is raised in power .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	15	44	It is sown a natural [ au ] body ; it is raised a spiritual body . If there is [ av ] a natural body , there is also a spiritual body .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	15	45	So also it has been written [ in Gen 2:7 ] , “ The first man , Adam , became a living soul ” . The Last Adam [ aw ] became a life-giving [ ax ] spirit .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	15	46	But the spiritual body is not first— but the natural body , then the spiritual .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	15	47	The first man was from earth , made-of-dust . The second Man is from heaven [ ay ] .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	15	48	Such [ az ] as was the one made-of-dust— such ones also are the ones made-of-dust . And such as is the heavenly One— such ones also are the heavenly ones .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	15	49	And just as we bore [ ba ] the image [ bb ] of the one made of dust , we shall also bear the image of the heavenly One . Behold , I Tell You a Mystery : We Will Not All Die , But We Will All Conquer Death
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	15	50	Now I say this , brothers : that flesh and blood are not able to inherit the kingdom of God , nor does decay inherit undecayability .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	15	51	Behold , I tell you a mystery [ bc ] : we will not all fall-asleep . But we will all be changed—
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	15	52	in a moment , in the blink of an eye , at the last trumpet . For it will trumpet , and the dead will be raised undecayable [ bd ] , and we will be changed .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	15	53	For this decayable body must put-on undecayability , and this mortal body must put on immortality [ be ] .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	15	54	And when this decayable body puts-on undecayability , and this mortal body puts on immortality , then the saying having been written will come-about [ bf ] : “ Death was swallowed-up in victory ” [ Isa 25:8 ] .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	15	55	“ Death , where is your victory ? Death , where is your stinger ? ” [ Hos 13:14 ] .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	15	56	Now the stinger [ bg ] of death is sin , and the power of sin is the Law [ bh ] .
DLNT	1%20Corinthians	15	57	But thanks be to God , the One giving us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ . So Abound In The Work of The Lord ; Your Labor Is Not In Vain

DLNT	2%20Corinthians	1	8	For we do not want you to be unaware , brothers , with-reference-to our affliction having taken place in Asia [ h ] , that we were burdened [ i ] extremely beyond our power , so that we despaired [ j ] even of living .
DLNT	2%20Corinthians	1	9	But we had [ k ] the sentence of death in ourselves in order that we should not be trusting in ourselves , but in God , the One raising the dead ,
DLNT	2%20Corinthians	1	10	Who delivered us from so great a death [ l ] , and will deliver us ; in Whom we have put our hope that He will indeed [ m ] still deliver us—

DLNT	2%20Corinthians	1	12	For our boasting is this : the testimony of [ o ] our conscience that we conducted-ourselves in the world , and especially toward you , in simplicity [ p ] and purity [ q ] from God [ r ] ; and not in fleshly wisdom , but in the grace of God .
DLNT	2%20Corinthians	1	13	For we are writing no other things to you other than the things which you read or indeed understand . And I hope that you will understand until the end [ s ] —
DLNT	2%20Corinthians	1	14	just as you also did understand us in part— that we are your boast , even as you also are ours , on the day of our Lord Jesus . And In This Confidence I Was Intending To Come To You First , Then Go To Macedonia

DLNT	2%20Corinthians	1	18	But as God is faithful [ z ] , our message to you is not yes and no .
DLNT	2%20Corinthians	1	19	For God ’ s Son Jesus Christ , the One having been proclaimed among you by us— by me and Silvanus and Timothy— did not become [ aa ] yes and no , but has become yes in Him .

I Wrote To You In Anguish Not To Grieve You , But Out of Love For You
DLNT	2%20Corinthians	2	4	For I wrote to you through many tears , out of much affliction and anguish of heart— not that you might be grieved , but that you might know the love which I have especially for you .
DLNT	2%20Corinthians	2	5	But [ d ] if anyone has caused-grief , he has grieved not me , but in part [ e ] ( that I not be a burden [ f ] ) , you all .

DLNT	2%20Corinthians	2	8	Therefore I urge you to confirm [ j ] your love for him . I Also Wrote To Test Your Obedience To God
DLNT	2%20Corinthians	2	9	For I also wrote for this purpose : that I might know your approvedness , whether you are obedient in all things .

DLNT	2%20Corinthians	2	11	in order that we may not be exploited by Satan . For we are not unaware as to his schemes . So Instead I Went To Macedonia First To Find Titus

DLNT	2%20Corinthians	7	6	But the One comforting the downcast [ g ] , God , comforted us by the coming of Titus ;
DLNT	2%20Corinthians	7	8	Because even though I grieved you by the letter [ h ] , I do not regret it . Even though I was regretting it ( for I see that that letter grieved you , even though for an hour ) ,
DLNT	2%20Corinthians	7	9	now I am rejoicing— not that you were grieved , but that you were grieved into repentance . For you were grieved in-accordance-with God , in order that you might suffer-loss in nothing by us .
DLNT	2%20Corinthians	7	10	For the grief in accordance with God works unregretted repentance leading-to salvation . But the grief of the world produces death .

DLNT	2%20Corinthians	9	6	Now this [ e ] I say : the one sowing sparingly will also reap sparingly . And the one sowing for [ f ] blessings will also reap for blessings .
DLNT	2%20Corinthians	9	7	Each should give just as he has chosen-beforehand [ g ] in his heart— not out of grief [ h ] or out of compulsion . For God loves a cheerful giver .
DLNT	2%20Corinthians	9	8	And God is able to cause all grace to abound to you in order that in everything , always having all sufficiency , you may be abounding for every good work .
DLNT	2%20Corinthians	9	10	And the One supplying seed to the one sowing [ i ] , and bread for eating , will supply and multiply your seed , and will grow the fruits of [ j ] your righteousness .
DLNT	2%20Corinthians	9	11	In everything you will be enriched for all generosity , which through [ k ] us is going to produce thanksgiving to God ,

DLNT	2%20Corinthians	9	13	Through the approvedness of this ministry , they will be glorifying God for the obedience of [ n ] your confession to [ o ] the good-news of Christ , and the generosity [ p ] of the contribution for them and for all ,

DLNT	Galatians	1	6	I am marveling that you are so quickly [ b ] turning-away from the One having called you by the grace of Christ to a different good-news—

DLNT	Galatians	1	12	For I neither received it from a human , nor was I taught it , but I received it through a revelation of [ n ] Jesus Christ . For When God Was Pleased To Reveal Himself To Me , I Conferred With No One
DLNT	Galatians	1	13	For you heard-of my former conduct in Judaism— that I was persecuting the church of God extremely , and destroying [ o ] it .
DLNT	Galatians	1	14	And I was advancing in Judaism beyond many contemporaries in my nation , being far more a zealot for the traditions of my fathers .

DLNT	Galatians	2	3	But not even Titus , the one with me , being a Greek , was compelled to be circumcised .
DLNT	Galatians	2	4	Now [ e ] this arose [ f ] because of the false-brothers secretly-brought-in , who sneaked-in to spy-out our freedom which we have in Christ Jesus in order that they might enslave [ g ] us—

DLNT	Galatians	2	7	But on-the-contrary , having seen that I have been entrusted the good-news for the uncircumcised just as Peter for the circumcised—
DLNT	Galatians	2	8	for the One having worked [ k ] in Peter for an apostleship of the circumcised worked also in me for the Gentiles—
DLNT	Galatians	2	9	and having recognized the grace having been given to me , James and Cephas and John , the ones having-the-reputation-of being pillars , gave the right hands of fellowship to me and Barnabas , that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised .

DLNT	Galatians	2	13	And the other Jews also joined-in-hypocrisy with him , so that even Barnabas was carried-away by their hypocrisy .
DLNT	Galatians	2	14	But when I saw that they were not walking-straight [ o ] with regard to the truth of the good-news , I said to Cephas in front of everyone— “ If you being a Jew are living Gentile-ly [ p ] and not Jewish-ly [ q ] , how is it you are compelling the Gentiles to Judaize [ r ] ? ” Even We Jews Are Declared Righteous By Faith In Christ , Not By Works of The Law

DLNT	Galatians	3	3	Are you so foolish ? Having begun-with [ e ] the Spirit are you now perfecting-yourselves [ f ] with the flesh ?
DLNT	Galatians	3	2	I want to learn only this from you : did you receive the Spirit by works of the Law or by the hearing [ c ] of [ d ] faith ?
DLNT	Galatians	3	4	Did you suffer [ g ] so many things in-vain— if indeed it really was in-vain ?
DLNT	Galatians	3	5	Did then the One supplying [ h ] you the Spirit and working miracles among you do it because-of [ i ] works of the Law , or because-of the hearing of faith ? The Children of Abraham Are The Ones Living By Faith , Not By The Law
DLNT	Galatians	3	6	Just as Abraham “ believed God and it was credited to him for righteousness ” [ Gen 15:6 ] ,
DLNT	Galatians	3	7	know then that the ones of [ j ] faith— these are the sons [ k ] of Abraham .
DLNT	Galatians	3	8	Now the Scripture , having foreseen that God declares the Gentiles righteous by faith , announced-the-good-news-beforehand to Abraham : that “ All the Gentiles will be blessed in [ l ] you ” [ Gen 12:3 ] .
DLNT	Galatians	3	9	,
DLNT	Galatians	3	10	,
DLNT	Galatians	3	11	And that no one is declared-righteous by [ o ] the Law before God is evident [ p ] , because “ The righteous one will live by faith ” [ Hab 2:4 ] .
DLNT	Galatians	3	12	,
DLNT	Galatians	3	13	Christ redeemed us from the curse of the Law , having become a curse for us— because it has been written , “ Cursed is everyone hanging on a tree ” [ Deut 21:23 ] —
DLNT	Galatians	3	14	in order that the blessing of [ q ] Abraham might come to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus , in order that we might receive the promise of [ r ] the Spirit through faith . God ’ s Promises To Abraham Were Not Cancelled By The Law Which Came Later
DLNT	Galatians	3	15	Brothers , I speak in accordance with human thinking : Though it is [ a covenant ] of a human , no one sets-aside or adds-conditions-to a covenant having been ratified .
DLNT	Galatians	3	16	Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed [ s ] . He [ t ] does not say [ in Gen 13:15 ] “ and to seeds ” , as-though speaking in reference to many ; but as-though speaking in reference to one , “ and to your seed ” — who is Christ .
DLNT	Galatians	3	17	And this I say : the Law , having come-about after four-hundred and thirty years , does not un-ratify [ u ] the covenant having been previously-ratified by God , so as to do-away-with [ v ] the promise .

DLNT	Galatians	3	19	Why then the Law ? It was added because of the transgressions until which time the Seed should come to Whom the promise has been made , having been commanded [ x ] through angels by the hand of a mediator [ y ] .
DLNT	Galatians	3	20	Now a mediator is not [ a mediator ] of [ only ] one [ party ] , but God is one [ z ] . The Law Served To Lead Us To Faith In Christ So As To Inherit The Abrahamic Promises
DLNT	Galatians	3	21	Is the Law then against the promises of God ? May it never be ! For if a Law being able to give-life had been given , righteousness really would have been by the Law !
DLNT	Galatians	3	22	But the Scripture confined all things under [ aa ] sin , in order that the promise by faith [ ab ] in Jesus Christ might be given to the ones believing .
DLNT	Galatians	3	23	And before the faith [ ac ] came , we were being kept-in-custody [ ad ] under the Law— being confined until [ ae ] the faith destined to be revealed .
DLNT	Galatians	3	24	So then the Law has been [ af ] our tutor [ ag ] leading-to [ ah ] Christ , in order that we might be declared-righteous by faith .
DLNT	Galatians	3	25	But the faith having come , we are no longer under a tutor !
DLNT	Galatians	3	26	For you all are sons [ ai ] of God through faith in Christ Jesus !
DLNT	Galatians	3	27	For all you who were baptized into Christ put-on [ aj ] Christ .
DLNT	Galatians	3	28	There is no Jew nor Greek , there is no slave nor free , there is no male and female . For you all are one in Christ Jesus .
DLNT	Galatians	3	29	And if you are Christ ’ s , then you are seed of Abraham— heirs according-to the promise .

DLNT	Galatians	4	4	But when the fullness of time came , God sent-forth His Son— having come [ f ] from a woman , having come under the Law
DLNT	Galatians	4	2	nevertheless [ b ] he is under guardians and stewards [ c ] until the pre-appointed day of the father .
DLNT	Galatians	4	3	In this manner also we , when we were children , were [ d ] enslaved under the elemental [ e ] things of the world .
DLNT	Galatians	4	5	in order that He might redeem the ones under the Law , in order that we [ all ] might receive the adoption .
DLNT	Galatians	4	6	And because [ g ] you are sons , God sent-forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts crying-out , “ Abba ! Father ! ”
DLNT	Galatians	4	7	So then you are no longer a slave , but a son— and if a son , also an heir through God ! Why Turn Back To Being Slaves Again ? I Fear For You

DLNT	Galatians	4	12	I beg you , brothers , become as I , because I also became as you . You did me no wrong .
DLNT	Galatians	4	13	And you know that I first [ h ] announced-the-good-news to you because of a weakness [ i ] of the flesh .
DLNT	Galatians	4	14	And you did not treat-with-contempt nor loathe your trial in-connection-with my flesh , but you welcomed me as an angel [ j ] of God , as Christ Jesus .

DLNT	Galatians	4	21	Tell me , the ones wanting to be under the Law , do you not hear the Law ?
DLNT	Galatians	4	22	For it has been written that Abraham had two sons— one by the slave-woman and one by the free woman .
DLNT	Galatians	4	23	But the one by the slave-woman has been born according to the flesh , and the one by the free woman through the promise—
DLNT	Galatians	4	24	which things are being allegorized [ p ] , for these women are two covenants . One [ q ] is from Mount Sinai , bearing children for slavery , which is Hagar
DLNT	Galatians	4	25	( now Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia ) . And she [ r ] corresponds to the present Jerusalem , for she [ s ] is a slave [ t ] with her children .
DLNT	Galatians	4	26	But the Jerusalem above is free— which is our mother [ u ] .
DLNT	Galatians	4	27	For it has been written , “ Celebrate , barren one , the one not giving-birth . Break-forth and shout , the one not suffering-birth-pains . Because many more are the children of the desolate [ v ] than of the one having the husband ! ” [ Isa 54:1 ]
DLNT	Galatians	4	28	And you , brothers , are children of the promise in accordance with Isaac .
DLNT	Galatians	4	29	But just as at-that-time the one having been born according to the flesh was persecuting the one born according to the Spirit , so also now .
DLNT	Galatians	4	30	But what does the Scripture say ? “ Send-out the slave-woman and her son . For the son of the slave-woman shall by no means inherit with the son of the free woman ” [ Gen 21:10 ] .
DLNT	Galatians	4	31	Therefore , brothers , we are not children of a slave-woman , but of the free woman . Footnotes - Galatians 4:1 That is , a minor . - Galatians 4:2 slave ... nevertheless he is .

DLNT	Galatians	5	5	For by [ d ] the Spirit , by faith , we are eagerly-awaiting the hope of righteousness .
DLNT	Galatians	5	2	Behold— I , Paul , say to you that if you receive-circumcision , Christ will profit you nothing .
DLNT	Galatians	5	3	And I testify again to every man receiving-circumcision that he is a debtor to do the whole Law .
DLNT	Galatians	5	4	You who are [ trying to be ] declared-righteous by the Law were alienated [ b ] from Christ . You fell-from grace [ c ] .
DLNT	Galatians	5	6	For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision can-do [ e ] anything , but faith working [ f ] through love . Who Hindered You From Believing The Truth ? He Will Bear His Judgment
DLNT	Galatians	5	7	You were running well . Who hindered [ g ] you that you should not be persuaded [ h ] by the truth ?
DLNT	Galatians	5	8	The persuasion is not from the One calling you !
DLNT	Galatians	5	9	A little leaven leavens the whole lump .
DLNT	Galatians	5	10	I am persuaded [ i ] with reference to you in the Lord that you will think no other thing . But the one disturbing you will bear the judgment , whoever he may be .
DLNT	Galatians	5	11	But I , brothers , if I am still proclaiming circumcision , why am I still being persecuted ? Then the offense of [ j ] the cross has been abolished .
DLNT	Galatians	5	12	O-that [ k ] the ones upsetting you would indeed cut-themselves-off [ l ] ! Use Your Freedom To Serve One Another In Love , Not As an Opportunity For The Flesh
DLNT	Galatians	5	13	For you were called for freedom , brothers , only do not use the freedom for an opportunity for the flesh , but be serving one another through love .
DLNT	Galatians	5	14	For the whole Law has been fulfilled in one saying— in the “ You shall love your neighbor as yourself ” [ Lev 19:18 ] .
DLNT	Galatians	5	15	But if you are biting and devouring one another , watch out that you may not be consumed by one another ! Walk By The Spirit And You Will Not Fulfill The Flesh ’ s Desires Or Be Under The Law
DLNT	Galatians	5	16	. Compare
DLNT	Galatians	5	17	For the flesh desires against the Spirit and the Spirit against the flesh . For these are contrary [ p ] to one another in-order-that you might not be doing these [ q ] things which you may be wanting .
DLNT	Galatians	5	18	But if you are being led by the Spirit , you are not under the Law . Those Who Practice The Works of The Flesh Will Not Inherit God ’ s Kingdom
DLNT	Galatians	5	19	Now the works of the flesh are evident , which are sexual-immorality , impurity , sensuality ,
DLNT	Galatians	5	20	idolatry , sorcery , hostilities , strife , jealousy , rages [ r ] , selfish-interests , dissentions , factions ,
DLNT	Galatians	5	21	envy [ s ] , drunkenness , revelries , and the things like these— as to which things I tell you beforehand , just as I said-before , that the ones practicing such things will not inherit the kingdom of God . Those In Christ Crucified The Flesh And Bear The Fruit of Living By The Spirit
DLNT	Galatians	5	22	But the fruit of [ t ] the Spirit is love , joy , peace , patience , kindness , goodness , faithfulness ,
DLNT	Galatians	5	23	gentleness , self-control . Against such things there is no law .
DLNT	Galatians	5	24	And the ones of [ u ] Christ Jesus crucified the flesh , with its passions and desires .
DLNT	Galatians	5	25	If we are living by the Spirit , let us also be walking-in-line [ v ] with the Spirit . Don ’ t Be Conceited . Humbly Care For One Another And You Will Fulfill Christ ’ s Law

DLNT	Galatians	6	5	For each one will carry his own load [ f ] . We Will Reap What We Sow . Plant Good Works To Reap a Good Harvest
DLNT	Galatians	6	7	Do not be deceived— God is not mocked . For whatever a person sows , this he will also reap .
DLNT	Galatians	6	8	Because the one sowing to his own flesh will reap decay from the flesh . But the one sowing to the Spirit will reap eternal life from the Spirit .
DLNT	Galatians	6	9	And let us not grow-weary while doing good . For in His own time we not losing-heart [ g ] will reap .

DLNT	Galatians	6	11	See with what large letters I wrote to you with my own hand !
DLNT	Galatians	6	12	All who want to make-a-good-showing [ j ] in the flesh— these ones are compelling you to receive-circumcision only in order that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ .
DLNT	Galatians	6	13	For not even the ones receiving-circumcision themselves are keeping the Law . But they want you to receive-circumcision in order that they might boast in your flesh . I Will Boast Only In The Cross of Christ . Peace Be Upon All Who Do The Same
DLNT	Galatians	6	14	But for me , may it never be that I should boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ , through which [ k ] the world has been crucified to me , and I to the world .
DLNT	Galatians	6	15	For neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is anything , but a new creation .
DLNT	Galatians	6	16	And all who will walk-in-line with this standard [ l ] — peace and mercy be upon them , and [ m ] upon the Israel of God .

DLNT	Ephesians	2	2	in which you formerly walked in accordance with the [ present ] age [ a ] of this world , in accordance with the ruler of the authority [ b ] of the air , of [ c ] the spirit [ d ] now being at-work in the sons of [ e ] disobedience ,
DLNT	Ephesians	2	3	among whom even we all formerly conducted-ourselves [ f ] in the desires of our flesh , doing the wants [ g ] of the flesh and of the thoughts , and were by nature children of [ h ] wrath , as also the rest .
DLNT	Ephesians	2	4	But God , being rich in mercy , because of His great love with which He loved us ,
DLNT	Ephesians	2	5	even we being dead in trespasses , made-us-alive-with Christ— by grace you are saved—
DLNT	Ephesians	2	6	and raised-us-with Him and seated-us-with Him in the heavenly-places in Christ Jesus ,
DLNT	Ephesians	2	7	in order that He might demonstrate [ i ] in the coming ages [ j ] the surpassing riches of His grace in His kindness toward us in Christ Jesus . For We Are Saved By Grace For The Good Works Which God Prepared For Us
DLNT	Ephesians	2	8	For by grace you are saved through faith . And this [ k ] is not from you . It is the gift of God—
DLNT	Ephesians	2	9	not of works , in order that no one may boast .
DLNT	Ephesians	2	10	For we are His workmanship , having been created in Christ Jesus for good works , which God prepared-beforehand in order that we might walk in them . So Remember Your Hopeless Condition As Gentiles Without Christ And God ’ s Promises
DLNT	Ephesians	2	11	Therefore remember that formerly you , the Gentiles in the flesh— the ones being called “ the uncircumcised ” by the one being called “ the circumcised ” ( one done-by-human-hands in the flesh ) —
DLNT	Ephesians	2	12	that you were at that time without Christ , having been excluded from the citizenship [ l ] of Israel , and strangers from the covenants of promise , having no hope and without-God in the world . But Now Christ Made Peace And Reconciled Jews And Gentiles To God Through The Cross
DLNT	Ephesians	2	13	But now in Christ Jesus you , the ones formerly being far-away , were made near by the blood of Christ .
DLNT	Ephesians	2	14	For He Himself is our peace , the One having made both one and having broken-down the dividing-wall of partition [ m ] , the hostility— in His flesh
DLNT	Ephesians	2	15	having abolished [ n ] the Law of commandments in decrees [ o ] in order that He might create the two in Himself into one new man , making peace ,
DLNT	Ephesians	2	16	and reconcile both in one body to God through the cross , having killed the hostility by it [ p ] .
DLNT	Ephesians	2	17	And having come , He announced-as-good-news peace to you , the ones far-away , and peace to the ones near ,
DLNT	Ephesians	2	18	because [ q ] through Him we both have the access in [ r ] one Spirit to the Father . So You Are No Longer Strangers , But In Christ You Are Fellow Citizens And Family Members
DLNT	Ephesians	2	19	So then , you are no longer strangers and foreigners , but you are fellow-citizens with the saints and family-members of God ,
DLNT	Ephesians	2	20	having been built upon the foundation of [ s ] the apostles and prophets— Christ Jesus Himself being the cornerstone ,

DLNT	Ephesians	4	2	with all humblemindedness and gentleness , with patience bearing-with one another in love ,
DLNT	Ephesians	4	3	being diligent to keep [ a ] the unity of [ b ] the Spirit in the bond of [ c ] peace— God Made Us One , And Gave Gifts And Grace To Each One of Us

DLNT	Ephesians	4	6	one God and Father of all , the One over all and through all and in all ;
DLNT	Ephesians	4	7	and to each one of us grace was given according to the measure of the gift of Christ . For Scripture Says Jesus Ascended On High And Gave Gifts To His People
DLNT	Ephesians	4	8	For this reason it says , “ having ascended to on-high , He led captivity captive [ d ] , He gave gifts to people ” [ Ps 68:18 ] .
DLNT	Ephesians	4	9	Now what does the “ He ascended ” mean except that He also descended into the lower parts of the earth [ e ] ?
DLNT	Ephesians	4	10	The One having descended is Himself also the One having ascended far above all the heavens , in order that He might fill all things . He Gave Gifted People To Equip The Saints To Build Up The Body of Christ To Maturity
DLNT	Ephesians	4	11	And He Himself gave some as apostles , and others as prophets , and others as evangelists , and others as shepherds and teachers ,
DLNT	Ephesians	4	12	for [ f ] the equipping [ g ] of the saints for the work of ministry [ h ] , for the building-up of the body of Christ

DLNT	Ephesians	4	14	so that we may no longer be children , being tossed-about and carried-around by every wind of teaching , by the trickery of people , by craftiness with-regard-to [ j ] the scheme of [ k ] error [ l ] ,
DLNT	Ephesians	4	15	but that while speaking-the-truth in love , we may grow as to all things into Him Who is the head— Christ ,
DLNT	Ephesians	4	16	from Whom the whole body , being fitted-together [ m ] and held-together by every joint of supply according to the working in measure of each individual part , is producing the growth of the body for the building-up of itself in love . So Walk No Longer In The Futile Darkness of The Gentiles , As They Pursue Impurity
DLNT	Ephesians	4	17	Therefore this I say and testify in the Lord , that you be walking no longer as indeed the Gentiles are walking , in the futility of their mind ,
DLNT	Ephesians	4	18	being darkened in their understanding , having been excluded from the life of God because of the ignorance being in them , because of the hardness of their hearts—
DLNT	Ephesians	4	19	who , having become callous , gave themselves over to sensuality for the practice [ n ] of every impurity with greed . Lay Aside The Old Person . Be Renewed In Your Mind And Put On The New Person
DLNT	Ephesians	4	20	But you did not learn Christ in this manner ,
DLNT	Ephesians	4	21	if indeed you heard Him and were taught in Him , even as it is the truth in Jesus
DLNT	Ephesians	4	22	that in-relation-to your former way-of-life you lay-aside the old person being corrupted [ o ] in-accordance-with the desires of [ p ] deception ,
DLNT	Ephesians	4	23	and that you be being renewed in the spirit of your mind ,
DLNT	Ephesians	4	24	and that you put-on the new person having been created in accordance with God , in righteousness and holiness of [ q ] truth . Live Out Righteousness And Truth

DLNT	Ephesians	5	7	Therefore do not be fellow-partakers with them . For You Were Formerly Darkness , But Now You Are Light ; Walk As Children of Light

DLNT	Ephesians	5	11	And do not be participating in the unfruitful works of darkness , but rather even be exposing [ j ] them .
DLNT	Ephesians	5	12	For it is shameful even to speak the things being done in secret by them ,

DLNT	Ephesians	5	17	For this reason , do not be foolish ones , but understand what the will of the Lord is .

DLNT	Philippians	1	10	so that you may be approving the things mattering [ k ] , in-order-that [ l ] you might be pure and blameless [ m ] for [ n ] the day of Christ ,
DLNT	Philippians	1	11	having been filled with the fruit of righteousness which comes through Jesus Christ to the glory and praise of God . Things Are Turning Out For The Good of The Gospel
DLNT	Philippians	1	12	Now I want you to know , brothers , that the things concerning me have come rather for the advancement of the good-news— The Brothers Are More Fearlessly Speaking The Word
DLNT	Philippians	1	13	... so that my imprisonment in [ o ] Christ became visible [ p ] in the whole Praetorium [ q ] and to all the rest ,
DLNT	Philippians	1	14	and so that the majority of the brothers , being confident [ r ] in the Lord because-of my imprisonment , are more daring to fearlessly speak the word . Whatever Their Motives , Christ Is Being Proclaimed
DLNT	Philippians	1	15	Some indeed speak because of envy and strife , but some also are proclaiming Christ because of good-will .
DLNT	Philippians	1	16	The ones speak out of love , knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the good-news ;
DLNT	Philippians	1	17	but the others are proclaiming Christ out of selfish-interest , not purely , supposing to raise trouble in my imprisonment .
DLNT	Philippians	1	18	What indeed does it matter except that [ s ] in every way , whether in pretense or in truth , Christ is being proclaimed ! Christ Will Be Magnified In Me , Whether I Live or Die And I am rejoicing in this . But I also will rejoice ,
DLNT	Philippians	1	19	for I know that this will turn-out for me for deliverance through your prayer and the provision of the Spirit of Jesus Christ ,
DLNT	Philippians	1	20	in-accordance-with my eager-expectation and hope that I will in no way be put-to-shame , but that with all boldness , as always , even now Christ will be magnified in my body , whether by life or by death—
DLNT	Philippians	1	21	for to me , the living is Christ , and the dying [ t ] is gain . Death Would Be Much Better For Me , But I Know I Will Continue To Live For Your Sake
DLNT	Philippians	1	22	Now if it is the living in the flesh , this for me means fruit from work . And I do not know [ u ] what I shall choose ,
DLNT	Philippians	1	23	but am gripped [ v ] by the two— having the desire that I might depart and be with Christ , for that is better by much more ,
DLNT	Philippians	1	24	but the remaining in the flesh is more-necessary for your sake .
DLNT	Philippians	1	25	And being confident-of this , I know that I will remain and continue with you all for your advancement and joy of faith ,
DLNT	Philippians	1	26	in order that your boast may be abounding in Christ Jesus in me through my presence again with you . But Conduct Yourselves Worthily of The Gospel , And Don ’ t Be Frightened
DLNT	Philippians	1	27	Only be conducting-yourselves [ w ] worthily of the good-news of Christ in order that whether having come and seen you or being absent , I may be hearing-of the things concerning you— that you are standing-firm in one spirit , contending-together with one soul for the faith of the good-news ,
DLNT	Philippians	1	28	and not being frightened [ x ] in any way by the ones opposing you— which is a sign [ y ] of destruction for them , but of your salvation , and this from God . God Has Granted That We Should Both Believe In Christ And Suffer For Him
DLNT	Philippians	1	29	Because to you was granted the thing [ z ] for Christ ’ s sake— not only the believing in Him , but also the suffering for His sake ,
DLNT	Philippians	1	30	having the same struggle [ aa ] such as you saw in me and now are hearing to be in me .

DLNT	Philippians	2	2	fill-up my joy , which is that you be thinking the same thing [ c ] , having the same love , united-in-spirit , thinking [ d ] the one thing ,
DLNT	Philippians	2	3	doing nothing based-on selfish-interest nor based on conceit , but with humble-mindedness regarding one another as surpassing [ e ] yourselves ;
DLNT	Philippians	2	4	not each looking-out-for your own things , but also each the things of others . Think And Behave Like Christ Did
DLNT	Philippians	2	5	Be thinking [ f ] this in you , which also was in Christ Jesus—
DLNT	Philippians	2	6	Who , while [ g ] being [ h ] in the form [ i ] of God , did not regard the being equal with God a thing-to-be-grasped [ j ] ,
DLNT	Philippians	2	7	but emptied Himself , having taken the form of a slave , having come [ k ] in the likeness [ l ] of humans [ m ] . And having been found as a man in outward-appearance ,
DLNT	Philippians	2	8	He humbled Himself , having become obedient to the point of death— and a death of a cross !
DLNT	Philippians	2	9	Therefore God also highly-exalted Him , and granted Him the name above every name
DLNT	Philippians	2	10	in-order-that every knee should bow at the name of Jesus— of heavenly ones and earthly ones and ones under-the-earth—
DLNT	Philippians	2	11	and every tongue should confess-out [ n ] that Jesus Christ is Lord , to the glory of God the Father . Work Out Your Salvation As Shining Lights In The World , Holding Out The Word of Life
DLNT	Philippians	2	12	So then my beloved , just as you always obeyed— not as in my presence only , but now much more in my absence— be working-out your salvation with fear and trembling .
DLNT	Philippians	2	13	For God [ o ] is the One working in you both the wanting [ p ] and the working , for His good-pleasure .
DLNT	Philippians	2	14	Be doing all things without grumblings and arguments
DLNT	Philippians	2	15	in-order-that you may become [ q ] blameless [ r ] and innocent , children of God without-blemish amidst a crooked and perverted generation , among whom you are shining [ s ] as lights [ t ] in the world ,
DLNT	Philippians	2	16	holding-out [ u ] the word of life— for a boast for me in the day of Christ that I did not run in vain nor labor in vain ! But Let Us Rejoice Together No Matter What Happens To Me
DLNT	Philippians	2	17	But if I even am being poured-out [ v ] upon the sacrifice and service of your faith , I am rejoicing [ over it ] , and rejoicing-with you all .
DLNT	Philippians	2	18	And you also be rejoicing the same way , and be rejoicing-with me . I Am Hoping To Send Timothy To You , And To Come Soon Myself
DLNT	Philippians	2	19	Now I am hoping in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon in order that I also may be cheered , having come-to-know the things concerning you .
DLNT	Philippians	2	20	For I have no one likeminded who will genuinely be concerned-about the things concerning you .
DLNT	Philippians	2	21	For the ones all are seeking their own things , not the things of Jesus Christ .
DLNT	Philippians	2	22	But you know his approvedness , because he served with me for the good-news as a child with a father .
DLNT	Philippians	2	23	So indeed I am hoping to send this one at-once , whenever I see the things with-respect-to me .
DLNT	Philippians	2	24	And I am confident in the Lord that I myself also will come soon . I Sent Back Epaphroditus , Your Precious Servant To My Need . Rejoice In Him
DLNT	Philippians	2	25	But I regarded it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus— my brother and fellow-worker and fellow-soldier , and your delegate [ w ] and minister of my need—
DLNT	Philippians	2	26	because he was yearning-for you all , and was being distressed because you heard that he was sick .
DLNT	Philippians	2	27	For indeed he was sick nearly to death . But God had-mercy-on him— and not him only , but also me , in order that I should not have grief upon grief .
DLNT	Philippians	2	28	Therefore I sent him more-eagerly , in order that having seen him again you may rejoice , and I may be less-grieved .
DLNT	Philippians	2	29	So receive him in the Lord with all joy , and be holding such ones precious ,
DLNT	Philippians	2	30	because he drew-near to the point of death for the sake of the work of Christ— having risked his life in order that he might fill-up your lack [ x ] of service to me .

DLNT	Philippians	3	3	For we are the circumcision , the ones worshiping in the Spirit of God and boasting in Christ Jesus and not putting-confidence in the flesh—
DLNT	Philippians	3	2	Be watching-out-for the dogs [ a ] , be watching out for the evil workers , be watching out for the mutilation [ b ] .
DLNT	Philippians	3	4	though myself having confidence even in the flesh ! If Anyone Can Put Confidence In The Flesh , I More If any other person thinks that he may put-confidence in the flesh , I more—
DLNT	Philippians	3	5	in circumcision the eighth day ; from the nation of Israel , the tribe of Benjamin , a Hebrew from Hebrews ; in relation to the Law— a Pharisee ;
DLNT	Philippians	3	6	in relation to zeal— persecuting the church ; in relation to the righteousness in the Law— having been blameless [ c ] . But I Count All Such Things As Loss That I May Know Christ And His Power
DLNT	Philippians	3	7	But what things were gains to me , these I have regarded to be a loss for the sake of Christ .
DLNT	Philippians	3	8	But more than that , I am indeed regarding all things to be a loss for the sake of the surpassing greatness of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord , for the sake of Whom I suffered-loss-of all things and am regarding them as garbage in order that I might gain Christ
DLNT	Philippians	3	9	and be found in Him , not having my own righteousness from the Law but the one through faith [ d ] in Christ , the righteousness from God on the basis of faith—
DLNT	Philippians	3	10	that I might know Him and the power of His resurrection and the partnership [ e ] of His sufferings , being conformed to His death
DLNT	Philippians	3	11	if somehow [ f ] I might attain to [ the power of ] the resurrection-out from the dead . Brothers , I Am Forgetting The Past And Pressing On Toward The True Prize
DLNT	Philippians	3	12	Not that I already obtained it or have already been made-perfect [ g ] , but I am pressing-on to see if I may indeed take-hold-of [ h ] that for which also I was taken hold of by Christ Jesus .
DLNT	Philippians	3	13	Brothers , I do not consider myself to have taken hold , but one thing I do : forgetting the things behind and stretching-toward the things ahead ,
DLNT	Philippians	3	14	I am pressing-on toward the goal for the prize of the upward [ i ] calling from God in Christ Jesus . All Who Claim To Be Mature : Think This Same Way . Imitate Me
DLNT	Philippians	3	15	Therefore , all who are mature— let us be thinking [ j ] this . And if you are thinking anything differently , God will reveal this also to you .
DLNT	Philippians	3	16	Nevertheless , to what thinking we attained , by the same let us be walking-in-line .
DLNT	Philippians	3	17	Be fellow-imitators of me , brothers , and be watching the ones walking in this manner , just as you have us as a pattern . For There Are Many Enemies of The Cross . They Focus On Earthly Things
DLNT	Philippians	3	18	For many walk as to whom I was often saying to you , and now even weeping say , they are the enemies of the cross of Christ—
DLNT	Philippians	3	19	whose end is destruction , whose god is their stomach and glory is in their shame— the ones thinking [ k ] the earthly things . And Our Citizenship Is In Heaven
DLNT	Philippians	3	20	For our place-of-citizenship is in the heavens , from where also we are eagerly-awaiting the Savior , the Lord Jesus Christ ,
DLNT	Philippians	3	21	Who will transform the body of our lowliness [ l ] so as to be similar-in-form [ m ] to the body of His glory , according-to the working that enables Him also to subject all things to Himself .

DLNT	Philippians	4	4	Be rejoicing in the Lord always ; again I will say , be rejoicing .
DLNT	Philippians	4	2	I exhort Euodia and I exhort Syntyche to be thinking the same [ a ] thing in the Lord .
DLNT	Philippians	4	3	Yes , I ask you also , genuine comrade [ b ] , be helping these women who contended-together [ c ] with me in connection with the good-news , along-with both Clement and the rest of my fellow-workers , whose names are in the book of life . Be Rejoicing In The Lord , Kind To All , And Praying To God
DLNT	Philippians	4	5	Let your kindness [ d ] be known to all people . The Lord is near .
DLNT	Philippians	4	6	Be anxious-about nothing , but in everything , by prayer and petition with thanksgivings , let your requests be made-known to God .
DLNT	Philippians	4	7	And the peace of God surpassing all understanding will guard [ e ] your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus . Be Considering And Practicing All That Is True And Commendable
DLNT	Philippians	4	8	Finally , brothers , be considering these things— whatever things are true , whatever things are honorable , whatever things are right , whatever things are pure , whatever things are lovely , whatever things are commendable , if there is any virtue , and if there is any praise .
DLNT	Philippians	4	9	Be practicing these things which you indeed learned and received and heard and saw in me , and the God of peace will be with you . Thank You For The Gift Epaphroditus Brought , And Your Continuing Partnership With Me
DLNT	Philippians	4	10	Now I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at last you revived your thinking about me— upon which [ f ] indeed you were thinking , but you were lacking-opportunity .
DLNT	Philippians	4	11	Not that I speak in relation to a need , for I learned to be content in the things in which I am .
DLNT	Philippians	4	12	I indeed know-how to be humbled . I also know-how to abound . In anything and in all things , I have learned-the-secret [ g ] — both to be filled-to-satisfaction and to be hungry , both to abound and to be in-need .
DLNT	Philippians	4	13	I can-do all things by-means-of [ h ] the One strengthening me .
DLNT	Philippians	4	14	Nevertheless , you did well having co-partnered [ i ] in my affliction . You Alone Have Partnered With Me From The First
DLNT	Philippians	4	15	And you also know , Philippians , that in the beginning of the good-news when I departed from Macedonia , no church partnered [ j ] with me in the matter of giving and receiving except you alone .
DLNT	Philippians	4	16	Because even in Thessalonica you sent to me both once and twice [ k ] for my need .
DLNT	Philippians	4	17	Not that I am seeking-for the gift , but I am seeking-for the fruit increasing to your account . I Have Received Your Pleasing Offering To God , And I Am Abounding
DLNT	Philippians	4	18	And I am receiving everything in full , and I am abounding . I have been filled-up , having received from Epaphroditus the things from you— an aroma of fragrance , an acceptable sacrifice , pleasing to God .
DLNT	Philippians	4	19	And my God will fill-up every need of yours in-accordance-with His riches in glory in Christ Jesus .
DLNT	Philippians	4	20	Now to our God and Father be the glory forever and ever , amen .
DLNT	Philippians	4	21	Greet every saint in Christ Jesus . The brothers with me greet you .
DLNT	Philippians	4	22	All the saints greet you , but especially the ones from Caesar ’ s household .

DLNT	Colossians	1	15	... Who is the image [ y ] of the invisible God , the firstborn [ z ] of [ aa ] all creation [ ab ] ,
DLNT	Colossians	1	16	because all things were created by [ ac ] Him in the heavens and on the earth , the visible things and the invisible things— whether thrones or lordships or rulers or authorities . All things have been created through Him and for Him .
DLNT	Colossians	1	17	And He Himself is before all things , and all things have existence [ ad ] in Him .
DLNT	Colossians	1	18	And He Himself is the head of the body , the church . The Son Is First In Everything , Because God Reconciled All Things Through Him ... Who is the beginning [ ae ] , the firstborn from the dead , in order that He Himself might come-to-be holding-first-place in all things ,
DLNT	Colossians	1	19	because the Father [ af ] was well-pleased that all the fullness [ ag ] should dwell in Him
DLNT	Colossians	1	20	and that He should reconcile all things through Him to Himself , having made-peace through the blood of His cross— through Him , whether the things on the earth or the things in the heavens . Indeed , You Yourselves Were Reconciled By Him
DLNT	Colossians	1	21	Indeed you were formerly being excluded , and were enemies [ ah ] in the mind in-connection-with evil works .
DLNT	Colossians	1	22	But now He reconciled you in the body of His flesh [ ai ] through His death , that He might present you holy and without-blemish and blameless in His presence—
DLNT	Colossians	1	23	if indeed [ aj ] you continue in the faith , having been founded , and steadfast , and not being moved-away from the hope of the good-news which you heard , the one having been proclaimed in [ ak ] all creation under heaven , of which I , Paul , became a minister [ al ] . I Am Suffering To Fulfill My Stewardship of God ’ s Now Revealed Mystery : Christ In You

DLNT	Colossians	2	8	Be watching-out that there will not be anyone taking you captive through philosophy and empty deception according-to [ h ] the tradition of humans , according to the elemental things [ i ] of the world , and not according to Christ ,
DLNT	Colossians	2	9	because in Him dwells all the fullness of the Deity [ j ] bodily [ k ] . You Are Complete In Christ , With Whom You Have Been Buried And Raised Up
DLNT	Colossians	2	10	And in Him you are complete [ l ] , Who is the head of all rule [ m ] and authority ,

DLNT	1%20Thessalonians	1	4	knowing , brothers having been loved by God , your election [ e ] ,
DLNT	1%20Thessalonians	1	5	because our good-news did not come to you in word only , but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and with great fullness-of-conviction— just as you know what-kind-of men we proved-to-be among you for your sake . For You Became Imitators of Us And Examples To All
DLNT	1%20Thessalonians	1	6	And you became imitators of us and of the Lord , having accepted the word in much affliction with the joy of the Holy Spirit ,
DLNT	1%20Thessalonians	1	7	so that you became an example to all the ones believing in Macedonia and in Achaia .
DLNT	1%20Thessalonians	1	8	For from you the word of the Lord has sounded-forth— not only in Macedonia and in Achaia , but in every place your faith toward God has gone-out— so that we are having no need to speak anything !

DLNT	1%20Thessalonians	2	2	But having previously-suffered and been mistreated [ c ] in Philippi , as you know , we were bold in our God to speak the good-news of God to you in a great conflict .
DLNT	1%20Thessalonians	2	3	For our exhortation [ d ] is not from [ e ] error , nor from impurity [ f ] , nor in [ g ] deceit .

DLNT	1%20Thessalonians	2	7	[ although ] being able to be with weight [ h ] as apostles of Christ . But we proved-to-be child-like [ i ] in your midst . As when a nurse [ j ] cherishes [ k ] her children ,
DLNT	1%20Thessalonians	2	8	in this manner longing-affectionately for you , we were well-pleased to impart to you not only the good-news of God , but also our own lives [ l ] , because you became beloved ones to us .
DLNT	1%20Thessalonians	2	9	For you remember , brothers , our labor and hardship— working by night and by day so-as not to be a burden-on [ m ] any of you , we proclaimed to you the good-news of God .
DLNT	1%20Thessalonians	2	10	You and God are witnesses how devoutly and righteously and blamelessly we were with [ n ] you , the ones believing—

DLNT	1%20Thessalonians	2	13	And for this [ o ] reason we are indeed [ p ] giving-thanks to God unceasingly : because having received the word of God heard from us [ q ] , you accepted not the word of humans , but , as it truly is , the word of God , which also is at-work [ r ] in you , the ones believing .
DLNT	1%20Thessalonians	2	14	For you became imitators , brothers , of the churches of God existing in Judea in Christ Jesus , because you also suffered the same things by your own countrymen as they also by the Jews—
DLNT	1%20Thessalonians	2	15	the ones also [ s ] having killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets , and having driven us out , and not being pleasing to God , and being contrary [ t ] to all people ,

DLNT	1%20Thessalonians	4	5	not in the passion of [ e ] desire [ f ] as indeed the Gentiles not knowing God ;
DLNT	1%20Thessalonians	4	6	that [ g ] no one overstep [ h ] and exploit [ i ] his brother [ j ] in the matter [ k ] . Because the Lord is the avenger concerning all these things , just as we also told you before and solemnly-warned .
DLNT	1%20Thessalonians	4	7	For God did not call us for [ l ] impurity , but in [ m ] holiness .
DLNT	1%20Thessalonians	4	8	So-therefore [ n ] the one rejecting is not rejecting a human , but God , the One also giving His Holy Spirit to you . But You Know From God To Love One Another . We Exhort You To Abound Even More
DLNT	1%20Thessalonians	4	9	But concerning brotherly-love , you have no need that anyone should be writing to you . For you yourselves are God-taught so-that you might be loving one another .
DLNT	1%20Thessalonians	4	10	For indeed you are doing it toward all the brothers in all Macedonia . But we exhort you , brothers , to be abounding more ,
DLNT	1%20Thessalonians	4	11	and to be ambitious [ o ] to be quiet [ p ] , and to be doing [ q ] your own things and working with your own hands just as we commanded you ,
DLNT	1%20Thessalonians	4	12	in order that you may walk properly toward the ones outside and may have need of nothing [ r ] . Do Not Grieve Over The Dead In Christ . We Will Rise Together To Be With Him Forever
DLNT	1%20Thessalonians	4	13	And we do not want you to be unaware , brothers , concerning the ones falling-asleep [ s ] , in-order-that you may not grieve as indeed the others— the ones not having a hope .
DLNT	1%20Thessalonians	4	14	For if we believe that Jesus died and rose-up , so also [ t ] God will bring with Him the ones having fallen asleep through [ u ] Jesus .
DLNT	1%20Thessalonians	4	15	For we say this to you by the word of the Lord , that we— the ones living , the ones remaining [ v ] until the coming of the Lord— will in-no-way precede the ones having fallen asleep .
DLNT	1%20Thessalonians	4	16	Because [ w ] the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shouted-command [ x ] , with a voice of an archangel [ y ] , and with a trumpet of God , and the dead in Christ will rise-up first .
DLNT	1%20Thessalonians	4	17	Then we— the ones living , the ones remaining— will be snatched-up [ z ] together [ aa ] with them in the clouds [ ab ] to meet the Lord in the air . And so we shall always be with the Lord .
DLNT	1%20Thessalonians	4	18	So then , be encouraging [ ac ] one another with these words . Footnotes -

DLNT	Philemon	1	1	Paul [ a ] , a prisoner of Christ Jesus , and Timothy our brother , to Philemon , our beloved one and fellow-worker ,
DLNT	Philemon	1	2	and to Apphia our sister , and to Archippus our fellow-soldier , and to the church at your house :
DLNT	Philemon	1	3	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ . I Thank God For Your Love , And Pray That Your Faith May Become Effective
DLNT	Philemon	1	4	I am giving-thanks to my God always while [ b ] making mention of you in my prayers ,
DLNT	Philemon	1	5	hearing-of your love and the faith [ c ] which you have toward the Lord Jesus and for all the saints ,
DLNT	Philemon	1	6	so that the fellowship [ d ] of [ e ] your faith may become effective [ f ] in [ g ] the knowledge of every good thing in us for Christ .
DLNT	Philemon	1	7	For I had much joy and encouragement in your love , because the deep-feelings of the saints have been refreshed through you , brother . I Appeal To You For Onesimus , Your Slave And Our Beloved Brother
DLNT	Philemon	1	8	Therefore , [ although ] having much boldness in Christ to be commanding you to do the fitting thing ,
DLNT	Philemon	1	9	for the sake of love I am rather appealing— being such a one as Paul , an old-man [ h ] , and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus .
DLNT	Philemon	1	10	I am appealing to you concerning my child whom I fathered in my imprisonment , Onesimus ,
DLNT	Philemon	1	11	the one formerly useless [ i ] to you but now useful both to you and to me ,
DLNT	Philemon	1	12	whom I sent-back to you ( him ! That is , my own deep-feelings [ j ] ! ) ,
DLNT	Philemon	1	13	whom I was wishing to hold-back with myself in order that on behalf of you he might be serving me in my imprisonment for the good-news .

DLNT	Philemon	1	15	For perhaps for this reason he was separated for an hour : in order that you might receive him in full forever ,
DLNT	Philemon	1	16	no longer as a slave , but beyond a slave , a beloved brother— especially to me , but how much more to you , both in the flesh and in the Lord ! Accept Him As Me , And Charge His Debts To My Account
DLNT	Philemon	1	17	Therefore if you hold me as a partner , accept him as me .
DLNT	Philemon	1	18	And if as to anything he wronged [ n ] you or owes you , charge this to my account—

DLNT	Hebrews	4	4	For He has spoken somewhere about the seventh day as follows : “ And God rested on the seventh day from all His works ” [ Gen 2:2 ] ,
DLNT	Hebrews	4	2	for indeed , we have had-good-news-announced [ b ] , just as those [ c ] also .

DLNT	Hebrews	4	6	Since then it remains that some may enter into it , and the ones formerly having had-good-news-announced to them did not enter because of disobedience ,

DLNT	Hebrews	4	8	For if Joshua had given them rest , He would not be speaking after these things about another day [ i ] . So God ’ s Spiritual Rest Remains Open For Us To Enter
DLNT	Hebrews	4	9	Therefore a Sabbath-rest remains for the people of God .

DLNT	Hebrews	6	2	of instruction about cleansings [ b ] and laying-on of hands , and about the resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment . And We Will Do This As God Permits , For It Is Impossible For Us To Help Some
DLNT	Hebrews	6	3	And this [ c ] we will do if-indeed God permits .
DLNT	Hebrews	6	4	For it is impossible to renew [ d ] again to repentance the ones having once been enlightened [ e ] and having tasted [ f ] the heavenly gift , and having been made [ g ] partakers [ h ] of the Holy Spirit ,
DLNT	Hebrews	6	5	and having tasted the good word of God and the powers [ i ] of the coming age ,
DLNT	Hebrews	6	7	For land having drunk the rain coming often upon it , and producing a plant useful to those for whose sake it is also farmed , receives a blessing from God .
DLNT	Hebrews	6	8	But land bringing-forth thorns and thistles is disapproved [ k ] and near a curse [ l ] , whose end [ m ] is for burning . But As For You , Beloved , Diligently Imitate The Inheritors of The Promises
DLNT	Hebrews	6	9	But concerning you , beloved , we are convinced-of better things , and things having salvation— even though we are speaking in this manner .
DLNT	Hebrews	6	10	For God is not unjust so as to forget your work and the love which you demonstrated for His name , having served [ n ] the saints and [ still ] serving .
DLNT	Hebrews	6	11	But we desire that each of you be demonstrating the same diligence toward the full-assurance of hope until the end ,
DLNT	Hebrews	6	12	in order that you may not be sluggish , but imitators of the ones inheriting the promises through faith and patience . For Abraham Waited Patiently And Obtained The Promise
DLNT	Hebrews	6	13	For God , having promised to Abraham , swore by Himself— since He had by no one greater to swear—
DLNT	Hebrews	6	14	saying [ in Gen 22:17 ] : “ Surely while blessing I will bless you , and while multiplying I will multiply [ o ] you ” .
DLNT	Hebrews	6	15	And so , having waited-patiently , he obtained the promise . God Even Guaranteed His Promise To Encourage Those Waiting For It
DLNT	Hebrews	6	16	For people swear by the greater one . And for them the oath for confirmation is the end [ p ] of every dispute ,
DLNT	Hebrews	6	17	by which custom God , intending even more to show the unchangeableness of His intention [ q ] to the heirs of the promise , guaranteed with an oath ,
DLNT	Hebrews	6	18	in order that by two [ r ] unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie , we [ s ] — the ones having fled to take-hold-of the hope being set-before us— may have strong encouragement [ t ] ,
DLNT	Hebrews	6	19	which hope we have as an anchor of the soul , both secure and firm and entering into the inner side of the curtain ,

DLNT	Hebrews	7	7	And apart from all dispute , the lesser one is blessed by the better one . He Is Living As a Priest Perpetually
DLNT	Hebrews	7	2	to whom also Abraham divided a tenth from everything ; who is first ( [ his name ] being translated ) , king of righteousness ; and then also king of Salem , which is [ d ] king of peace ;
DLNT	Hebrews	7	3	. - Hebrews 7:9 Thus , the entire Levitical priesthood is inferior to the priesthood of Melchizedek . - Hebrews 7:11 This new priestly order is mentioned in Ps
DLNT	Hebrews	7	4	Now observe how great this one is to whom indeed Abraham the patriarch gave a tenth from the choicest-spoils : He Is Greater Than Abraham
DLNT	Hebrews	7	5	Indeed , the ones from the sons of Levi receiving the priestly-office have a commandment to be collecting-a-tenth-from the people according to the Law ( that is , from their brothers , even though their brothers have come-out of the loins of Abraham ) —
DLNT	Hebrews	7	6	yet the one not tracing-his-genealogy from them has collected-a-tenth from Abraham , and has blessed the one having the promises !
DLNT	Hebrews	7	8	And here , dying men [ g ] receive the tenths— yet there , it is being attested [ h ] that he is living ! He Is Greater Than Levi And His Priesthood
DLNT	Hebrews	7	9	And so to speak , through Abraham even Levi [ i ] , the one receiving the tenths , has paid-a-tenth .
DLNT	Hebrews	7	10	For he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him ! Now Why Did Another Priesthood Need To Arise After Aaron ?
DLNT	Hebrews	7	11	Now indeed , if perfection had been through the Levitical priesthood ( for the [ Jewish ] people have received-the-Law on the basis of it ) what further need would there have been that another priest should arise according to the order [ j ] of Melchizedek , and not be named according to the order of Aaron ? For This New Priesthood Also Brings a Change of Law
DLNT	Hebrews	7	12	For the priesthood being changed , of necessity there is [ k ] also a change of law . For Its High Priest Is From The Tribe of Judah
DLNT	Hebrews	7	13	For the One about Whom these [ l ] things are spoken has partaken of another tribe from which no one has attended-to the altar .
DLNT	Hebrews	7	14	For it is clear that our Lord has risen from Judah— for which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priests . And He Became High Priest Based On His Indestructible Life
DLNT	Hebrews	7	15	And it is still even-more very-clear [ m ] if Another Priest arises in accordance with the likeness of Melchizedek ,
DLNT	Hebrews	7	16	Who has become such not based-on the law of a fleshy [ n ] commandment , but based on the power of an indestructible life !
DLNT	Hebrews	7	17	For it is attested that “ You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek ” [ Ps 110:4 ] . The New Sets Aside The Old And Brings In a Better Hope
DLNT	Hebrews	7	18	For a setting-aside [ o ] of the preceding commandment takes place because of its weakness and unprofitableness
DLNT	Hebrews	7	19	( for the Law perfected nothing ) — and a bringing-in of a better hope through which we draw-near to God . Jesus Is a Better Priest Because His Priesthood Is Based On God ’ s Oath
DLNT	Hebrews	7	20	And [ p ] to the degree that it was not without an oath-swearing ( for the ones have become [ q ] priests without an oath-swearing ,
DLNT	Hebrews	7	21	but the One with an oath-swearing , through the One saying to Him [ in Ps 110:4 ] : “ The Lord swore and He will not change-His-mind , You are a priest forever ” ) —
DLNT	Hebrews	7	22	to that degree also Jesus has become the guarantee [ r ] of a better covenant . Jesus Serves As High Priest Forever
DLNT	Hebrews	7	23	And [ s ] the many have been [ Levitical ] priests because of their being prevented from continuing by death—
DLNT	Hebrews	7	24	but the One , because of His remaining forever , has a permanent [ t ] priesthood .
DLNT	Hebrews	7	25	Hence also , He is able to save completely [ u ] the ones coming-to God through Him , always living so as to intercede for them . God ’ s Son Perfected Forever Is a Fitting High Priest For Us
DLNT	Hebrews	7	26	For such a High Priest was indeed fitting for us— holy , innocent , undefiled , having been separated [ v ] from sinners , and having become higher than the heavens—
DLNT	Hebrews	7	27	Who does not have the daily necessity ( as indeed the high priests ) to be offering sacrifices first for His own sins , then the sins of the people . For He did this once-for-all , having offered Himself .
DLNT	Hebrews	7	28	For the Law appoints men having weakness as high priests , but the word of the oath-swearing after [ w ] the Law appoints a Son having been perfected forever . Footnotes - Hebrews 7:1 The meaning of this man is explained by examining the two places he is mentioned in the OT , Gen 14:17-20 ( in v 1-10 ) and Ps

DLNT	Hebrews	8	8	For , finding-fault-with [ g ] them , He says [ in Jer 31:31-34 ] : “ Behold— days are coming , says the Lord , and I will consummate [ h ] a new covenant for the house of Israel and for the house of Judah ;
DLNT	Hebrews	8	2	Minister of the Holies [ b ] , indeed [ c ] of the true tabernacle ( which the Lord pitched [ d ] , not a human ) . Earthly Priests Serve In a Copy And Shadow of The Heavenly Things
DLNT	Hebrews	8	3	For every high priest is appointed that he might be offering both gifts and sacrifices . Hence it is [ e ] necessary that this One also have something which He may offer .
DLNT	Hebrews	8	4	Now indeed , if He were on earth He would not even be a priest— there being the ones offering the gifts according-to the Law ,
DLNT	Hebrews	8	5	who are serving a copy and a shadow of the heavenly things , just as Moses has been warned , being about to complete the tabernacle : for “ See ” , He says [ in Ex 25:40 ] , “ that you make everything according to the pattern having been shown to you on the mountain ” . But Jesus Has a Better Ministry As Mediator of a Better Covenant With Better Promises
DLNT	Hebrews	8	6	But He has now obtained a more-excellent ministry [ f ] , by as much as He is indeed the mediator of a better covenant , which has been enacted on better promises ! For God Promised a New Covenant
DLNT	Hebrews	8	7	For if that first covenant had been faultless , no place would have been sought for a second .
DLNT	Hebrews	8	9	not in accordance with the covenant which I made with their fathers on the day I took-hold-of their hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt , because they did not continue in My covenant , and I did not-care-for them , says the Lord .
DLNT	Hebrews	8	10	Because this is the covenant which I will covenant with the house of Israel after those days , says the Lord : Giving My laws into their mind , I will also write them upon their heart . And I will be God to them and they will be a people to Me .
DLNT	Hebrews	8	11	And they will by no means each teach his fellow-citizen and each his brother , saying ‘ Know [ i ] the Lord ’ , because they all will know Me from the small [ j ] one up to their great one .
DLNT	Hebrews	8	12	Because I will be merciful [ k ] to their wrong-doings , and I will never remember [ l ] their sins again ” . God Has Thus Made The First Covenant Old
DLNT	Hebrews	8	13	In that He says “ New ” , He has made the first old [ m ] . And the thing becoming old and growing-aged is near disappearance .

DLNT	Hebrews	9	2	and
DLNT	Hebrews	9	3	And behind the second curtain was the tabernacle being called the Holies of Holies ,
DLNT	Hebrews	9	4	having a golden altar-of-incense [ c ] , and the ark [ d ] of the covenant having been covered on-all-sides with gold , in which was a golden jar having the manna and the rod of Aaron having budded and the tablets of the covenant ,

DLNT	Hebrews	9	8	... the Holy Spirit making this clear : that the way of [ h ] the Holies has not yet been made-known while the first tabernacle [ i ] was [ j ] still having [ k ] a standing ,
DLNT	Hebrews	9	10	being [ o ] only ( in-addition-to foods and drinks and different cleansings [ p ] ) regulations of [ q ] flesh being imposed until the time of reformation . But Christ Entered The True Holy of Holies Once For All And Obtained Redemption
DLNT	Hebrews	9	11	But Christ , having arrived [ r ] as High Priest of the good things having come , entered [ s ] once-for-all into the Holies through [ t ] the greater and more-perfect tabernacle not made-by-human-hands— that is , not of this creation ;

DLNT	Hebrews	9	13	For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the ones having been defiled sanctifies for the cleansing of the flesh ,
DLNT	Hebrews	9	14	by how much more will the blood of Christ , Who through the eternal Spirit [ w ] offered Himself without-blemish to God , cleanse our conscience from dead works so that we may worship [ x ] the living God ! Thus Christ Mediates a New Covenant Inaugurated By His Own Blood
DLNT	Hebrews	9	15	And for this reason He is the mediator of a new covenant , so that the ones having been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance— a death having taken-place for the redemption from the transgressions committed under [ y ] the first covenant .
DLNT	Hebrews	9	16	For where there is a will [ z ] , it is a necessity that the death of the one having made-the-will be brought-forth .
DLNT	Hebrews	9	17	For a will over dead ones is firm , since it does not ever have [ legal ] power when the one having made-the-will is living .
DLNT	Hebrews	9	18	Hence , not even the first covenant has been inaugurated [ aa ] without blood .
DLNT	Hebrews	9	19	For every commandment having been spoken to all the people by Moses according-to [ ab ] the Law— having taken the blood of the calves and the goats along with water and scarlet wool and hyssop , he sprinkled both the book itself and all the people ,
DLNT	Hebrews	9	20	saying “ This is the blood of the covenant which God commanded to you ” [ Ex 24:8 ] .
DLNT	Hebrews	9	21	And he likewise sprinkled with the blood both the tabernacle and all the objects of the ministry .
DLNT	Hebrews	9	22	Indeed according-to [ ac ] the Law almost everything is cleansed [ ad ] with blood , and forgiveness does not take-place [ ae ] apart-from blood-shedding [ af ] .
DLNT	Hebrews	9	23	Therefore it was a necessity that the copies [ ag ] of the things in the heavens be cleansed with these [ ah ] things— but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these . He Entered The Heavenly Temple
DLNT	Hebrews	9	24	For Christ did not enter into the Holies made-by-human-hands— copies of the true things— but into heaven itself , now to appear in the presence of God for us . He Offered Himself Once For All As a Sacrifice To Set Aside Sin
DLNT	Hebrews	9	25	Nor did He enter in order that He might offer Himself often— as indeed the high priest enters into the Holies yearly with the blood belonging-to-another—
DLNT	Hebrews	9	26	otherwise He would had-to-have suffered often since the foundation of the world . But now He has appeared once-for-all at the conclusion [ ai ] of the ages for the setting-aside of sin by the sacrifice [ aj ] of Himself . He Will Appear To Us a Second Time For Salvation
DLNT	Hebrews	9	27	And just as it is destined for people to die once and after this comes the judgment ,
DLNT	Hebrews	9	28	so also [ ak ] Christ , having been offered once so as to bear [ al ] the sins of many , will appear for a second time without reference to sin to the ones eagerly-awaiting Him , for salvation .

DLNT	Hebrews	10	10	... by which will we have been made-holy through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once-for-all . The Priests Offer Sacrifices Daily , But Jesus Offered One Sacrifice For All
DLNT	Hebrews	10	2	Otherwise would they not have ceased being offered , because of the ones worshiping no longer having a consciousness of sins , having been cleansed once-for-all ?
DLNT	Hebrews	10	3	But in them [ c ] there is a yearly reminder of sins .
DLNT	Hebrews	10	4	For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take-away sins .
DLNT	Hebrews	10	5	Therefore , while entering into the world , He says [ in Ps 40:6-8 ] : “ You did not desire sacrifice and offering , but You prepared a body for Me .
DLNT	Hebrews	10	6	You were not well-pleased with whole-burnt-offerings and offerings for sin .
DLNT	Hebrews	10	7	Then I said , Behold , I have come— in the roll [ d ] of a book it has been written about Me—that I might do Your will , God ” . Thus God Has Done Away With Animal Offerings And Established Christ ’ s
DLNT	Hebrews	10	8	Saying above that “ You did not desire nor were You well-pleased with sacrifices and offerings and whole-burnt-offerings and offerings for sin ” ( which are being offered according-to [ e ] the Law ! ) ,
DLNT	Hebrews	10	9	then He has said , “ Behold , I have come that I might do Your will ” — He does-away-with [ f ] the first in-order-that He might establish the second , And By God ’ s Will We Are Made Holy By The Offering of Christ ’ s Body
DLNT	Hebrews	10	11	And every priest stands ministering daily and offering often the same sacrifices which are never able to take-away sins—
DLNT	Hebrews	10	12	but this One , having offered one sacrifice for sins [ g ] for all time , sat-down at the right hand of God ,
DLNT	Hebrews	10	13	henceforth waiting until His enemies are put as a footstool of His feet . For By One Offering Jesus Perfected Us For All Time
DLNT	Hebrews	10	14	For by one offering He has perfected for all time the ones being made-holy . The New Covenant Says That God Will Never Remember Our Sins Again
DLNT	Hebrews	10	15	And the Holy Spirit also testifies to us ; for after the statement [ in Jer 31:33 ] having said
DLNT	Hebrews	10	16	“ This is the covenant which I will covenant with them after those days , says the Lord : Giving My laws upon their hearts , I will also write them upon their mind ” ,
DLNT	Hebrews	10	17	then He says “ And I will never remember their sins and their lawless-deeds again ” . God ’ s Permanent Forgiveness Makes Further Offerings For Sin Unnecessary
DLNT	Hebrews	10	18	Now where there is forgiveness of these things , there is no longer an offering for sin ! Therefore Let Us Approach God In Full Assurance of Faith And Hold On Without Wavering
DLNT	Hebrews	10	19	Therefore , brothers , having confidence for the entering of the Holies by the blood of Jesus—
DLNT	Hebrews	10	20	which fresh [ h ] and living way He inaugurated for us through [ i ] the curtain , that is [ j ] , His flesh—
DLNT	Hebrews	10	21	and having a great Priest over the house of God ,
DLNT	Hebrews	10	22	let us be approaching God with a true heart in full-assurance of faith , having our hearts sprinkled [ k ] from an evil conscience , and having our body washed [ l ] with clean water .
DLNT	Hebrews	10	23	Let us be holding-on-to the confession of our hope without-wavering , for the One having promised is faithful .
DLNT	Hebrews	10	24	And let us be considering [ m ] one another for the provoking [ n ] of love and good works ,
DLNT	Hebrews	10	25	not forsaking the gathering-together of ourselves as is a habit with some , but exhorting [ o ] one another , and so-much more by-as-much-as you see the day drawing-near . To Now Do Otherwise Is To Trample Underfoot The Son of God
DLNT	Hebrews	10	26	For while [ p ] we are willfully [ q ] sinning [ r ] after the receiving of the knowledge of the truth , a sacrifice no longer remains [ s ] for sins ,
DLNT	Hebrews	10	27	but some fearful expectation [ t ] of judgment and a zeal of fire going to consume the adversaries .

DLNT	Hebrews	10	31	It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God . You Need To Endure By Faith Until You Receive The Promises
DLNT	Hebrews	10	32	Now [ aa ] remember the former days during which , having been enlightened [ ab ] , you endured a great struggle [ ac ] of sufferings—
DLNT	Hebrews	10	33	on this hand being made-a-spectacle [ ad ] by both reproaches [ ae ] and afflictions , and on this hand having become partners of the ones living in this manner [ af ] .

DLNT	Hebrews	10	35	So do not throw-away your confidence , which has a great reward .
DLNT	Hebrews	10	36	For you have need of endurance , in order that having done the will of God , you might receive the promise .

DLNT	Hebrews	11	11	By faith— and Sarah herself being barren— he [ n ] received power for the foundation [ o ] of a seed [ p ] even beyond the time of mature-age , since he regarded the One having promised to be faithful .
DLNT	Hebrews	11	2	For in this the elders [ f ] were attested . The Early Times
DLNT	Hebrews	11	3	By faith we understand that the worlds have been prepared by the word of God , so that the thing being seen has not [ g ] come-into-being from things being visible .
DLNT	Hebrews	11	4	By faith Abel offered to God a greater sacrifice than Cain , through which he was attested to be righteous— God testifying about his gifts . And through it , [ although ] having died , he is still speaking .
DLNT	Hebrews	11	5	By faith Enoch was removed [ h ] , so as not to see death : “ And he was not found because God removed him ” [ Gen 5:24 ] . For before the removal , he has been attested to have pleased God .
DLNT	Hebrews	11	6	And without faith it is impossible to please Him . For the one coming-to God must believe that He is , and He becomes the rewarder to the ones seeking Him out .
DLNT	Hebrews	11	7	By faith Noah , having been warned about the things not yet being seen , having been reverent , prepared the ark for the salvation [ i ] of his household , through which he condemned the world and became an inheritor of the righteousness according-to faith . The Time of The Patriarchs
DLNT	Hebrews	11	8	By faith Abraham , being called , obeyed to go out to a place which he was going-to receive for an inheritance . And he went out not knowing where he was going .
DLNT	Hebrews	11	9	By faith he stayed [ j ] in the land of the promise as a land belonging-to-another , having dwelled in tents with Isaac and Jacob , the fellow-heirs of the same promise .
DLNT	Hebrews	11	10	For he was waiting-for the city having foundations , of which [ k ] God is designer [ l ] and maker [ m ] .
DLNT	Hebrews	11	12	Therefore indeed from one man— and he having become impotent as to these [ q ] things— were born [ r ] seed as the stars of heaven in number , and countless as the sand by the shore of the sea .
DLNT	Hebrews	11	13	In accordance with faith , these [ s ] all died not having received the promises , but having seen them from a distance , and having greeted them , and having confessed that they are strangers and pilgrims [ t ] on the earth .
DLNT	Hebrews	11	14	For the ones saying such things are making-clear that they are seeking-for a homeland .
DLNT	Hebrews	11	15	And if they had been remembering that homeland from which they came out , they would have had opportunity to return—
DLNT	Hebrews	11	16	but as-it-is , they are aspiring-to a better homeland ; that is , a heavenly one . Therefore God is not ashamed-of them , to be called their God . For He prepared a city for them .
DLNT	Hebrews	11	17	By faith Abraham has offered Isaac while being tested . And the one having received the promises was offering his only-born [ u ] ,
DLNT	Hebrews	11	18	with-regard-to whom [ v ] it was said [ in Gen 21:12 ] that “ In Isaac a seed will be called for you ” ,
DLNT	Hebrews	11	19	having considered [ w ] that God was able to raise him even from the dead , from-which [ x ] he also received him back in a symbol [ y ] .
DLNT	Hebrews	11	20	By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau even concerning coming things .
DLNT	Hebrews	11	21	By faith Jacob , while dying , blessed each of the sons of Joseph and “ worshiped [ leaning ] on the top of his staff ” [ Gen 47:31 ] .
DLNT	Hebrews	11	22	By faith Joseph , while coming-to-an-end [ z ] , mentioned concerning the departure [ aa ] of the sons of Israel and gave-commands concerning his bones . The Time of The Exodus
DLNT	Hebrews	11	23	By faith Moses , having been born , was hidden for three months by his parents , because they saw the child was beautiful and did not fear the edict of the king .
DLNT	Hebrews	11	24	By faith Moses , having become great [ ab ] , refused to be called son of Pharaoh ’ s daughter ,
DLNT	Hebrews	11	25	having chosen rather to be mistreated-with the people of God than to be having a temporary enjoyment of sin ,
DLNT	Hebrews	11	26	having regarded the reproach of [ ac ] the Christ to be greater riches than the treasures of Egypt . For he was looking-away [ ad ] to the reward .
DLNT	Hebrews	11	27	By faith he left Egypt , not having feared the fury of the king . For he persevered [ ae ] as seeing [ af ] the invisible One .
DLNT	Hebrews	11	28	By faith he has performed the Passover [ ag ] and the sprinkling of the blood in order that the one destroying the firstborns might not touch them .
DLNT	Hebrews	11	29	By faith they crossed [ ah ] the Red Sea as through dry land— of which having taken the test [ ai ] , the Egyptians were swallowed-up .
DLNT	Hebrews	11	30	By faith the walls of Jericho fell , having been encircled for seven days .
DLNT	Hebrews	11	31	By faith Rahab the prostitute did not perish-with the ones having disobeyed , having welcomed the spies with peace . What More Shall I Say ?
DLNT	Hebrews	11	32	And what more may I say ? For time will fail me while telling about Gideon , Barak , Samson , Jephthah , both David and Samuel , and the prophets ,
DLNT	Hebrews	11	33	who through faith conquered kingdoms , worked righteousness [ aj ] , obtained [ ak ] promises , stopped the mouths of lions ,
DLNT	Hebrews	11	34	quenched the power of fire , escaped the edges of the sword , were strengthened from weakness , became mighty in battle , put-to-flight armies of foreigners .
DLNT	Hebrews	11	35	Women received their dead by resurrection— but others were tortured , not accepting redemption [ al ] , in order that they might obtain a better resurrection .
DLNT	Hebrews	11	36	And others received a trial of mockings and whippings , and furthermore of bonds and prison .
DLNT	Hebrews	11	37	They were stoned , they were sawn-in-two , they died by murder of the sword . They went-around in sheepskins , in skins of-goats , being in-need , being afflicted , being mistreated—
DLNT	Hebrews	11	38	of whom the world was not worthy— wandering in desolate-places and mountains and caves and openings of the earth . They Did Not Receive The Promise , For God Had a Better Promise For Us
DLNT	Hebrews	11	39	And these all , having been attested through their faith , did not receive the promise—

DLNT	Hebrews	12	4	you did not yet resist to the point of blood while struggling against sin ! And Have You Forgotten That God Disciplines Those He Loves ?
DLNT	Hebrews	12	5	And have [ l ] you completely-forgotten [ m ] the exhortation which speaks [ n ] to you as sons ? : “ My son , do not be thinking-lightly [ o ] of the discipline [ p ] of the Lord , nor losing-heart while being rebuked by Him .
DLNT	Hebrews	12	6	For the one whom the Lord loves He disciplines , and He whips [ q ] every son whom He accepts ” [ Prov 3:11-12 ] . God Is Dealing With You As Sons
DLNT	Hebrews	12	7	You are enduring [ r ] [ your trials ] for discipline ; God is dealing with you as with sons . For what son is there whom his father does not discipline ?
DLNT	Hebrews	12	8	But if you are without discipline , of which all have become partakers [ s ] , then you are illegitimate [ t ] children and not sons . And God Is Disciplining You For Your Benefit
DLNT	Hebrews	12	9	Furthermore , we had fathers of our flesh [ u ] as discipliners and were respecting them— but shall we not much more be subject to the Father of [ our ] spirits and live ?
DLNT	Hebrews	12	10	For the ones were disciplining us for a few days according to the thing seeming good to them ; but the One does so for our benefit [ v ] , so that we may share-in His holiness . And His Discipline Will Yield The Fruit of Righteousness

DLNT	Hebrews	12	15	while exercising-oversight that someone may not be coming-short of the grace of God ; that some root of [ ac ] bitterness growing [ ad ] up may not be causing-trouble and many be defiled [ ae ] by it ;
DLNT	Hebrews	12	16	that someone may not be sexually-immoral or [ af ] profane like Esau , who sold his own firstborn-rights [ ag ] for one meal [ ah ] .
DLNT	Hebrews	12	17	For you know that indeed afterward , while wanting to inherit the blessing , he was rejected— for he did not find a place of [ ai ] repentance— even-though having sought-for it [ aj ] with tears . For You Have Come To The City of God , The Heavenly Jerusalem
DLNT	Hebrews	12	18	For you have not come-to a mountain being touched [ ak ] , and a fire having been burning , and darkness and gloom and a storm ,
DLNT	Hebrews	12	19	and a blast of a trumpet , and a sound of words— of which , the ones having heard begged that a word not be added to them .

DLNT	Hebrews	12	21	And so fearful was the thing appearing [ al ] , Moses said “ I am terrified and trembling ” .
DLNT	Hebrews	12	22	But you have come to Mount Zion ; and the city of the living God , the heavenly Jerusalem ; and the myriads of angels , a festive-gathering [ am ] ;
DLNT	Hebrews	12	23	and the church [ an ] of the firstborn ones having been registered [ ao ] in the heavens ; and the Judge , God of all ; and the spirits of righteous ones having been perfected ;
DLNT	Hebrews	12	24	and the mediator of the new covenant , Jesus ; and the blood of sprinkling speaking better than Abel . Do Not Refuse The One Warning From Heaven , But Worship Him With Gratitude
DLNT	Hebrews	12	25	Be watching-out that you not refuse [ ap ] the One speaking . For if those did not escape , having refused the One warning on earth , much more we will not escape : the ones turning-away-from the One warning from the heavens—
DLNT	Hebrews	12	26	Whose voice shook the earth at that time , but now He has promised , saying [ in Hag 2:6 ] “ I will shake once more not only the earth , but also the heaven ” .
DLNT	Hebrews	12	27	And the phrase “ once more ” indicates the removal of the things being shaken— as of things having been made— so that the things not being shaken may continue .
DLNT	Hebrews	12	28	Therefore while receiving an unshakable kingdom , let us have gratitude , through which we may worship [ aq ] God pleasingly [ ar ] , with reverence and awe .

DLNT	James	1	23	Because if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer , this one is like a man considering [ aa ] the face of his birth [ ab ] in a mirror .
DLNT	James	1	24	For he considered himself and has gone-away and immediately forgot [ ac ] what-sort of man he was .
DLNT	James	1	25	But the one having looked into the perfect law of liberty and having continued , not having become a forgetful [ ad ] hearer , but a doer of work— this one will be blessed in his doing .
DLNT	James	1	26	If anyone thinks that he is religious while not bridling [ ae ] his tongue , but deceiving his heart , the religion [ af ] of this one is worthless [ ag ] .
DLNT	James	1	27	This is pure and undefiled religion before our God and Father— to be looking-after orphans and widows in their affliction ; to be keeping oneself unspotted by the world .

DLNT	James	2	2	For if a gold-ringed man in shining clothing enters into your gathering , and a poor man in filthy clothing also enters ,
DLNT	James	2	3	and you look-upon [ d ] the one wearing the shining clothing and say “ You be sitting here honorably [ e ] ” , and you say to the poor man “ You stand there , or be sitting under [ f ] my footstool ” ,
DLNT	James	2	4	did you not make-distinctions among yourselves and become judges with [ g ] evil thoughts ? God Does Not Base His Actions On Human Distinctions . Love Your Neighbor
DLNT	James	2	5	Listen , my beloved brothers— did not God choose the poor in the world to be rich in faith and inheritors of the kingdom which He promised to the ones loving Him ?
DLNT	James	2	6	But you dishonored the poor man . Do not the rich oppress you and themselves drag you into courts ?
DLNT	James	2	7	Do not they blaspheme the good name having been called [ h ] upon you ?
DLNT	James	2	8	If indeed [ i ] you are fulfilling the royal law according to the Scripture [ in Lev 19:18 ] , “ You shall love your neighbor as yourself ” , you are doing well [ j ] .
DLNT	James	2	9	But if you are showing-respect-of-persons you are working [ k ] a sin , being convicted [ l ] by the Law as transgressors .
DLNT	James	2	10	For whoever keeps the whole Law but stumbles in one thing has become guilty of all .
DLNT	James	2	11	For the One having said “ Do not commit-adultery ” also said “ Do not murder ” . Now if you do not commit-adultery , but you murder , you have become a transgressor of the Law .
DLNT	James	2	12	So speak and so do as ones going to be judged by the law of liberty .
DLNT	James	2	13	For judgment will be merciless to the one not having done [ m ] mercy . Mercy vaunts [ n ] over judgment . Faith Without Works Is Dead
DLNT	James	2	14	What is the profit , my brothers , if someone claims to have faith but does not have works [ o ] ? The [ p ] faith is not able to save him , is it ?
DLNT	James	2	15	If brother or sister are naked and lacking daily food
DLNT	James	2	16	and one of you says to them “ Go in peace ; be warmed and filled ” , but you do not give them the necessities of the body , what is the profit [ q ] ?
DLNT	James	2	17	In this manner also faith , if it does not have works , is dead by [ r ] itself . Faith Can not Be Seen Apart From Works
DLNT	James	2	18	But someone will say “ You have faith , and I have works ” . Show me your faith without [ s ] the works , and I will show you the faith by my works .
DLNT	James	2	19	You believe that God is one [ t ] ? You do well . Even the demons believe and shudder ! Faith Is Perfected By Works
DLNT	James	2	20	But do you want to know [ u ] , O empty [ v ] person , that faith without works is useless [ w ] ?
DLNT	James	2	21	Abraham our father— was he not declared-righteous by works [ x ] , having offered Isaac his son on the altar ?
DLNT	James	2	22	Do you [ y ] see that faith was working-with his works , and the faith was perfected [ z ] by the works ?
DLNT	James	2	23	And the Scripture was fulfilled , the one saying [ in Gen 15:6 ] “ And Abraham believed God , and it was credited to him for righteousness ” . And he was called a friend of God .
DLNT	James	2	24	Do you [ aa ] all see that a person is declared-righteous by works , and not by faith alone [ ab ] ?
DLNT	James	2	25	And likewise also Rahab the prostitute— was she not declared-righteous by works , having received the messengers and sent-them-out by a different way ?
DLNT	James	2	26	For just as the body without spirit [ ac ] is dead , so also faith without works is dead .

DLNT	James	3	3	Now if we put bridles into the mouths of horses so-that they obey us , we also guide their whole body .
DLNT	James	3	2	For we all stumble many [ c ] ways . If one does not stumble in speech , this one is a perfect man able to bridle [ d ] also the whole body .
DLNT	James	3	4	Behold also ships being so large and being driven by hard winds— they are guided by a very small rudder where the impulse of the one steering wants .
DLNT	James	3	5	So also the tongue is a small body-part , and boastfully-declares great things . Behold how-small a fire kindles how-great a forest ! An Untamed Tongue Stains And Burns And Poisons Life
DLNT	James	3	6	And the tongue is a fire ! The [ e ] tongue is made [ f ] the world of [ g ] unrighteousness among our body-parts— the thing staining the whole body and setting-on-fire the course of our existence , and being set-on-fire by Gehenna [ h ] .
DLNT	James	3	7	For every nature [ i ] of both wild-animals and birds , of both reptiles and sea-creatures , is tamed and has been tamed by the human nature .
DLNT	James	3	8	But none of mankind is able to tame the tongue— a restless evil , full of death-bringing poison .
DLNT	James	3	9	With it we bless the Lord and Father , and with it we curse the people having been made in accordance with the likeness of God ;
DLNT	James	3	10	a blessing and a curse come out of the same mouth . Such Destruction Ought Not To Proceed From Us My brothers , these things ought [ j ] not to be so .
DLNT	James	3	11	The spring does not gush out of the same opening the sweet and the bitter , does it ?
DLNT	James	3	12	A fig tree is not able , my brothers , to make olives , or a grapevine figs , is it ? Neither is salty water able to make sweet water . Your Speech And Conduct And The Fruit They Produce Reveal The Source of Your Wisdom
DLNT	James	3	13	Who [ k ] is wise and knowledgeable among you ? Let him show from his good conduct his works done in the gentleness of wisdom .
DLNT	James	3	14	But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish-interest [ l ] in your heart , do not be vaunting [ m ] and lying against the truth .
DLNT	James	3	15	This wisdom is not coming down [ n ] from-above , but is earthly , natural , demonic .
DLNT	James	3	16	For where jealousy and selfish-interest are , in-that-place there is disorder [ o ] and every bad thing [ p ] .
DLNT	James	3	17	But the wisdom from-above is first pure , then peaceful , kind , yielding [ q ] , full of mercy and good fruits , impartial , sincere .

DLNT	James	4	4	Adulterous [ c ] ones , do you not know that friendship with the world is hostility toward God ? Therefore , whoever wants to be a friend of the world makes-himself [ d ] an enemy of God .
DLNT	James	4	2	You desire and do not have ; you [ a ] murder . And you are jealous and are not able to obtain ; you battle and fight . You do not have because of your not asking !
DLNT	James	4	3	You ask and do not receive because you ask badly [ b ] , in order that you may spend it in connection with your pleasures .
DLNT	James	4	5	Or do you think that the Scripture [ e ] speaks vainly ? He yearns jealously for the spirit [ f ] which He made-to-dwell in us ! But God Gives Grace To The Humble . So Submit To God And Purify Your Hearts

DLNT	James	4	7	Therefore , submit to God , but resist the devil and he will flee from you .
DLNT	James	4	8	Draw-near to God and He will draw-near to you . Cleanse your hands , sinners , and purify your hearts , double-minded ones .
DLNT	James	4	9	Be miserable [ g ] and mourn and weep . Let your laughter be turned into mourning and your joy into dejection [ h ] .
DLNT	James	4	10	Humble-yourselves [ i ] in the presence of the Lord , and He will exalt you . So Do Not Be Speaking Against Or Judging One Another
DLNT	James	4	11	Do not be speaking-against one another , brothers . The one speaking-against a brother or judging his brother is speaking-against the Law and judging the Law . But if you are judging the Law , you are not a doer of the Law , but a judge .
DLNT	James	4	12	There is one Lawgiver and Judge— the One being able to save and to destroy . But who are you , the one judging your neighbor ? Do Not Presume To Direct Your Life Apart From God
DLNT	James	4	13	Come now , the ones saying “ Today or tomorrow we will travel to such-and-such city and do a year there , and we will do-business and make-a-gain ” —
DLNT	James	4	14	who do not know the thing of [ j ] tomorrow ! What is your life ? For you are a vapor appearing for a little while , then indeed disappearing ! —
DLNT	James	4	15	instead of you saying , “ If the Lord wills , we indeed [ k ] will live and do this or that ” .
DLNT	James	4	16	But as-it-is , you are boasting in your pretensions . All such boasting is evil .
DLNT	James	4	17	Therefore , to one knowing [ l ] to be doing good and not doing it , to him it is a sin . Footnotes - James 4:2 have ; you murder ... fight . Or , have .

DLNT	James	5	5	You lived-in-luxury upon the earth , and you lived-indulgently [ d ] . You fattened your hearts in [ e ] a day of slaughter .
DLNT	James	5	2	Your riches have rotted and your garments have become moth-eaten .
DLNT	James	5	3	Your gold and silver have become corroded [ a ] . And their corrosion will be for a testimony against you , and will eat your flesh like fire . You stored-up treasure [ b ] in the last days !
DLNT	James	5	4	Behold— the wages of the workers having mowed your fields , the wages having been fraudulently-withheld by you , cry-out . And the outcries of the ones having reaped have entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth [ c ] .
DLNT	James	5	6	You condemned , you murdered the righteous . He does not oppose [ f ] you ! Be Patient and Endure Hardship Until The Lord Comes
DLNT	James	5	7	Therefore be patient , brothers , until the coming of the Lord . Behold— the farmer waits-for the precious fruit of the land , being-patient with it until it receives the early and late rain .
DLNT	James	5	8	You also be-patient . Establish your hearts , because the coming of the Lord has drawn-near .
DLNT	James	5	9	Do not be groaning against one another , brothers , in order that you may not be judged . Behold— the Judge stands in front of the doors .
DLNT	James	5	10	Take as an example of suffering-hardship and patience , brothers , the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord .
DLNT	James	5	11	Behold— we consider-blessed the ones having endured ! You heard of the endurance of Job , and you saw the outcome from the Lord : that the Lord is large-hearted [ g ] and compassionate . Above All , Be True To Your Word . Be Praying And Singing-Praise
DLNT	James	5	12	And above all , my brothers , do not be swearing [ h ] — neither by heaven nor by earth nor by any other oath . But let your yes be yes and your no be no , in order that you may not fall under judgment .
DLNT	James	5	13	Is anyone among you suffering-hardship ? Let him be praying . Is anyone cheerful ? Let him be singing-praise . Pray For One Another So That You May Be Healed
DLNT	James	5	14	Is anyone among you sick ? Let him summon the elders of the church , and let them pray over him , having anointed [ i ] him with oil in the name of the Lord .
DLNT	James	5	15	And the prayer of [ j ] faith will restore [ k ] the one being ill , and the Lord will raise him . And if he has committed [ l ] sins , it will be forgiven him .
DLNT	James	5	16	Therefore be confessing-out [ m ] your sins to one another , and be praying for one another so that you may be healed . A prayer [ n ] of a righteous person can-do much while working [ o ] .
DLNT	James	5	17	Elijah was a person of-like-nature to us , and he prayed with prayer [ p ] that it not rain . And it did not rain upon the land for three years and six months .
DLNT	James	5	18	And he prayed again and the heaven gave rain , and the earth produced its fruit . Try To Turn Back Those Who Stray From The Truth
DLNT	James	5	19	My brothers , if anyone among you errs [ q ] from the truth and someone turns him back ,
DLNT	James	5	20	let him know that the one having turned-back a sinner from the error of his way will save his [ r ] soul [ s ] from death , and will cover a multitude of sins .

DLNT	1%20Peter	1	3	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , the One having caused us to be born-again [ f ] according to His great mercy to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead ,
DLNT	1%20Peter	1	4	to an undecayable [ g ] and undefiled and unfading inheritance having been reserved [ h ] in the heavens for you—

DLNT	1%20Peter	1	6	... in which you are rejoicing-greatly , [ although ] right-now for a little while , if it is necessary , having been grieved by various trials

DLNT	1%20Peter	1	12	to whom it was revealed that they were ministering them not for themselves , but for you , ... which things now were declared to you through the ones having announced-the-good-news-to you by the Holy Spirit having been sent-forth from heaven , into which things angels desire to look . In Light of What God Has Done :
DLNT	1%20Peter	1	13	Therefore : Put Your Hope Completely Upon Your Coming Salvation Having girded-up the waist of your minds [ o ] , being sober [ p ] — put-your-hope completely [ q ] upon the grace being brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ . Be Holy In All Your Conduct
DLNT	1%20Peter	1	14	As children of [ r ] obedience not being conformed [ s ] to the former desires in-connection-with your ignorance ,
DLNT	1%20Peter	1	15	but in accordance with the holy One having called you— be holy yourselves also in all your conduct [ t ] .
DLNT	1%20Peter	1	16	Because it has been written that “ You shall be holy , because I am holy ” [ Lev 19:2 ] . Live Out Your Days In The Fear of God
DLNT	1%20Peter	1	17	And if you are calling-upon as Father the One judging without-respect-of-persons according to the work of each person— conduct the time of your stay [ u ] with fear [ v ] ,

DLNT	1%20Peter	2	21	For you were called to this [ y ] . Because Christ also suffered for you , leaving-behind a pattern for you in order that you might follow-after His footsteps— Christ Suffered Unjustly , Entrusting Himself To God
DLNT	1%20Peter	2	22	... Who “ did not commit sin , nor was deceit found in His mouth ” [ Isa 53:9 ] ;
DLNT	1%20Peter	2	23	Who while being reviled , was not reviling-in-return ; while suffering , was not threatening , but was committing Himself [ z ] to the One judging righteously ;
DLNT	1%20Peter	2	24	Who Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross in order that we , having died [ aa ] to sins , might live for righteousness ; by Whose bruise you were healed .

DLNT	1%20Peter	3	2	having observed your pure conduct with fear [ a ] —
DLNT	1%20Peter	3	4	but the hidden person of the heart in [ c ] the imperishable adorning consisting of the gentle and quiet spirit , which is very-precious in the sight of God .
DLNT	1%20Peter	3	5	For in this manner formerly also the holy wives putting-hope in God were adorning themselves , being subject to their own husbands ,
DLNT	1%20Peter	3	6	as Sarah obeyed Abraham , calling him lord [ d ] — of whom [ e ] you became children while [ f ] doing-good and not fearing any terror [ g ] . Honor Your Wives As Fellow Heirs of The Gift of Life

DLNT	1%20Peter	3	8	And finally , everyone— being likeminded [ o ] , sympathetic , brother-loving , tender-hearted [ p ] , humbleminded ,
DLNT	1%20Peter	3	9	not giving-back evil for evil or reviling [ q ] for reviling , but on the contrary , blessing them . Because you were called to this , in order that you might inherit a blessing .
DLNT	1%20Peter	3	10	For “ the one desiring [ r ] to love life and see good days— let him stop his tongue from evil and his lips that they not speak deceit ;
DLNT	1%20Peter	3	11	and let him turn-away from evil and do good . Let him seek peace and pursue it .
DLNT	1%20Peter	3	12	Because the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous , and His ears are open to their prayer . But the face of the Lord is against ones doing evil things ” [ Ps 34:12-16 ] . You Are Blessed If You Suffer For Righteousness
DLNT	1%20Peter	3	13	And who is the one who will do you evil [ s ] if you become zealots [ t ] for good ?
DLNT	1%20Peter	3	14	But even though you might be suffering [ u ] for the sake of righteousness , you are blessed [ v ] ones ! Make Christ Lord In Your Heart As You Suffer For Doing Good But do not fear their fear [ w ] , nor be disturbed ,
DLNT	1%20Peter	3	15	but set Christ apart as Lord in your hearts , being ready always for a defense to everyone asking you a reason for the hope in you ,
DLNT	1%20Peter	3	16	but with gentleness and fear [ x ] , having a good conscience in order that in what you are spoken-against [ y ] , the ones maligning your good conduct in Christ may be put-to-shame .
DLNT	1%20Peter	3	17	For it is better to be suffering while doing-good , if the will of God should [ so ] will it , than while doing-evil . Because Christ Himself Suffered To Bring Us To God , And Is Now Glorified By God
DLNT	1%20Peter	3	18	Because Christ also suffered once-for-all for sins— a righteous One for unrighteous ones— in order that He might bring you to God , having been put-to-death in the flesh but made-alive [ z ] by the Spirit [ aa ] ,
DLNT	1%20Peter	3	19	... by Whom [ ab ] also [ ac ] having gone , He proclaimed [ ad ] to the spirits [ ae ] in prison—

DLNT	1%20Peter	3	21	... which [ af ] also as to you a corresponding-thing [ ag ] now saves— baptism ( not a putting-off [ ah ] of dirt from the flesh , but an appeal [ ai ] to God for [ aj ] a good conscience ) through the resurrection of Jesus Christ ,
