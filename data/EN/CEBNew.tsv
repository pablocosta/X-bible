CEB	Matthew	1	16	Jacob was the father of Joseph , the husband of Mary—of whom Jesus was born , who is called the Christ .
CEB	Matthew	1	17	So there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David , fourteen generations from David to the exile to Babylon , and fourteen generations from the exile to Babylon to the Christ . Birth of Jesus
CEB	Matthew	1	18	This is how the birth of Jesus Christ took place . When Mary his mother was engaged to Joseph , before they were married , she became pregnant by the Holy Spirit .
CEB	Matthew	1	19	Joseph her husband was a righteous man . Because he didn ’ t want to humiliate her , he decided to call off their engagement quietly .
CEB	Matthew	1	20	As he was thinking about this , an angel from the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said , “ Joseph son of David , don ’ t be afraid to take Mary as your wife , because the child she carries was conceived by the Holy Spirit .
CEB	Matthew	1	21	She will give birth to a son , and you will call him Jesus , because he will save his people from their sins. ”
CEB	Matthew	1	22	Now all of this took place so that what the Lord had spoken through the prophet would be fulfilled :
CEB	Matthew	1	23	Look ! A virgin will become pregnant and give birth to a son , And they will call him , Emmanuel . [ a ] ( Emmanuel means “ God with us. ” )
CEB	Matthew	1	24	When Joseph woke up , he did just as an angel from God commanded and took Mary as his wife .
CEB	Matthew	1	25	But he didn ’ t have sexual relations with her until she gave birth to a son . Joseph called him Jesus .
CEB	Matthew	2	2	They asked , “ Where is the newborn king of the Jews ? We ’ ve seen his star in the east , and we ’ ve come to honor him. ”
CEB	Matthew	2	3	When King Herod heard this , he was troubled , and everyone in Jerusalem was troubled with him .
CEB	Matthew	2	4	He gathered all the chief priests and the legal experts and asked them where the Christ was to be born .
CEB	Matthew	2	5	They said , “ In Bethlehem of Judea , for this is what the prophet wrote :
CEB	Matthew	2	6	You , Bethlehem , land of Judah , by no means are you least among the rulers of Judah , because from you will come one who governs , who will shepherd my people Israel. ” [ a ]
CEB	Matthew	2	7	Then Herod secretly called for the magi and found out from them the time when the star had first appeared .
CEB	Matthew	2	8	He sent them to Bethlehem , saying , “ Go and search carefully for the child . When you ’ ve found him , report to me so that I too may go and honor him. ”
CEB	Matthew	2	9	When they heard the king , they went ; and look , the star they had seen in the east went ahead of them until it stood over the place where the child was .
CEB	Matthew	2	10	When they saw the star , they were filled with joy .
CEB	Matthew	2	11	They entered the house and saw the child with Mary his mother . Falling to their knees , they honored him . Then they opened their treasure chests and presented him with gifts of gold , frankincense , and myrrh .
CEB	Matthew	2	12	Because they were warned in a dream not to return to Herod , they went back to their own country by another route . Escape to Egypt
CEB	Matthew	2	13	When the magi had departed , an angel from the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said , “ Get up . Take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt . Stay there until I tell you , for Herod will soon search for the child in order to kill him. ”
CEB	Matthew	2	14	Joseph got up and , during the night , took the child and his mother to Egypt .
CEB	Matthew	2	15	He stayed there until Herod died . This fulfilled what the Lord had spoken through the prophet : I have called my son out of Egypt . [ b ] Murder of the Bethlehem children
CEB	Matthew	2	16	When Herod knew the magi had fooled him , he grew very angry . He sent soldiers to kill all the children in Bethlehem and in all the surrounding territory who were two years old and younger , according to the time that he had learned from the magi .
CEB	Matthew	2	17	This fulfilled the word spoken through Jeremiah the prophet :
CEB	Matthew	2	18	A voice was heard in Ramah , weeping and much grieving . Rachel weeping for her children , and she did not want to be comforted , because they were no more . [ c ] Return from Egypt
CEB	Matthew	2	19	After King Herod died , an angel from the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt .
CEB	Matthew	2	20	“ Get up , ” the angel said , “ and take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel . Those who were trying to kill the child are dead. ”
CEB	Matthew	2	21	Joseph got up , took the child and his mother , and went to the land of Israel .
CEB	Matthew	2	22	But when he heard that Archelaus ruled over Judea in place of his father Herod , Joseph was afraid to go there . Having been warned in a dream , he went to the area of Galilee .
CEB	Matthew	2	23	He settled in a city called Nazareth so that what was spoken through the prophets might be fulfilled : He will be called a Nazarene .
CEB	Matthew	3	3	He was the one of whom Isaiah the prophet spoke when he said : The voice of one shouting in the wilderness , “ Prepare the way for the Lord ; make his paths straight. ” [ a ]
CEB	Matthew	3	2	“ Change your hearts and lives ! Here comes the kingdom of heaven ! ”
CEB	Matthew	3	4	John wore clothes made of camel ’ s hair , with a leather belt around his waist . He ate locusts and wild honey .
CEB	Matthew	3	5	People from Jerusalem , throughout Judea , and all around the Jordan River came to him .
CEB	Matthew	3	6	As they confessed their sins , he baptized them in the Jordan River .
CEB	Matthew	3	7	Many Pharisees and Sadducees came to be baptized by John . He said to them , “ You children of snakes ! Who warned you to escape from the angry judgment that is coming soon ?
CEB	Matthew	3	8	Produce fruit that shows you have changed your hearts and lives .
CEB	Matthew	3	9	And don ’ t even think about saying to yourselves , Abraham is our father . I tell you that God is able to raise up Abraham ’ s children from these stones .
CEB	Matthew	3	10	The ax is already at the root of the trees . Therefore , every tree that doesn ’ t produce good fruit will be chopped down and tossed into the fire .
CEB	Matthew	3	11	I baptize with water those of you who have changed your hearts and lives . The one who is coming after me is stronger than I am . I ’ m not worthy to carry his sandals . He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire .
CEB	Matthew	3	12	The shovel he uses to sift the wheat from the husks is in his hands . He will clean out his threshing area and bring the wheat into his barn . But he will burn the husks with a fire that can ’ t be put out. ” Baptism of Jesus
CEB	Matthew	3	13	At that time Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River so that John would baptize him .
CEB	Matthew	3	14	John tried to stop him and said , “ I need to be baptized by you , yet you come to me ? ”
CEB	Matthew	3	15	Jesus answered , “ Allow me to be baptized now . This is necessary to fulfill all righteousness. ” So John agreed to baptize Jesus .
CEB	Matthew	3	16	When Jesus was baptized , he immediately came up out of the water . Heaven was opened to him , and he saw the Spirit of God coming down like a dove and resting on him .
CEB	Matthew	3	17	A voice from heaven said , “ This is my Son whom I dearly love ; I find happiness in him . ”
CEB	Matthew	4	4	Jesus replied , “ It ’ s written , People won ’ t live only by bread , but by every word spoken by God. ” [ a ]
CEB	Matthew	4	2	After Jesus had fasted for forty days and forty nights , he was starving .
CEB	Matthew	4	3	The tempter came to him and said , “ Since you are God ’ s Son , command these stones to become bread. ”
CEB	Matthew	4	5	After that the devil brought him into the holy city and stood him at the highest point of the temple . He said to him ,
CEB	Matthew	4	6	“ Since you are God ’ s Son , throw yourself down ; for it is written , I will command my angels concerning you , and they will take you up in their hands so that you won ’ t hit your foot on a stone. ” [ b ]
CEB	Matthew	4	7	Jesus replied , “ Again it ’ s written , Don ’ t test the Lord your God. ” [ c ]
CEB	Matthew	4	8	Then the devil brought him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory .
CEB	Matthew	4	9	He said , “ I ’ ll give you all these if you bow down and worship me. ”
CEB	Matthew	4	10	Jesus responded , “ Go away , Satan , because it ’ s written , You will worship the Lord your God and serve only him. ” [ d ]
CEB	Matthew	4	11	The devil left him , and angels came and took care of him . Move to Galilee
CEB	Matthew	4	12	Now when Jesus heard that John was arrested , he went to Galilee .
CEB	Matthew	4	13	He left Nazareth and settled in Capernaum , which lies alongside the sea in the area of Zebulun and Naphtali .
CEB	Matthew	4	14	This fulfilled what Isaiah the prophet said :
CEB	Matthew	4	15	Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali , alongside the sea , across the Jordan , Galilee of the Gentiles ,
CEB	Matthew	4	16	the people who lived in the dark have seen a great light , and a light has come upon those who lived in the region and in shadow of death . [ e ]
CEB	Matthew	4	17	From that time Jesus began to announce , “ Change your hearts and lives ! Here comes the kingdom of heaven ! ” Calling of the first disciples
CEB	Matthew	4	18	As Jesus walked alongside the Galilee Sea , he saw two brothers , Simon , who is called Peter , and Andrew , throwing fishing nets into the sea , because they were fishermen .
CEB	Matthew	4	19	“ Come , follow me , ” he said , “ and I ’ ll show you how to fish for people. ”
CEB	Matthew	4	20	Right away , they left their nets and followed him .
CEB	Matthew	4	21	Continuing on , he saw another set of brothers , James the son of Zebedee and his brother John . They were in a boat with Zebedee their father repairing their nets . Jesus called them and
CEB	Matthew	4	22	immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him . Ministry to the crowds
CEB	Matthew	4	23	Jesus traveled throughout Galilee , teaching in their synagogues . He announced the good news of the kingdom and healed every disease and sickness among the people .
CEB	Matthew	4	24	News about him spread throughout Syria . People brought to him all those who had various kinds of diseases , those in pain , those possessed by demons , those with epilepsy , and those who were paralyzed , and he healed them .
CEB	Matthew	4	25	Large crowds followed him from Galilee , the Decapolis , Jerusalem , Judea , and from the areas beyond the Jordan River .
CEB	Matthew	5	5	“ Happy are people who are humble , because they will inherit the earth .
CEB	Matthew	5	1	Now when Jesus saw the crowds , he went up a mountain . He sat down and his disciples came to him .
CEB	Matthew	5	2	He taught them , saying : Happy people
CEB	Matthew	5	3	“ Happy are people who are hopeless , because the kingdom of heaven is theirs .
CEB	Matthew	5	4	“ Happy are people who grieve , because they will be made glad .
CEB	Matthew	5	6	“ Happy are people who are hungry and thirsty for righteousness , because they will be fed until they are full .
CEB	Matthew	5	7	“ Happy are people who show mercy , because they will receive mercy .
CEB	Matthew	5	8	“ Happy are people who have pure hearts , because they will see God .
CEB	Matthew	5	9	“ Happy are people who make peace , because they will be called God ’ s children .
CEB	Matthew	5	10	“ Happy are people whose lives are harassed because they are righteous , because the kingdom of heaven is theirs .
CEB	Matthew	5	11	“ Happy are you when people insult you and harass you and speak all kinds of bad and false things about you , all because of me .
CEB	Matthew	5	12	Be full of joy and be glad , because you have a great reward in heaven . In the same way , people harassed the prophets who came before you . Salt and light
CEB	Matthew	5	13	“ You are the salt of the earth . But if salt loses its saltiness , how will it become salty again ? It ’ s good for nothing except to be thrown away and trampled under people ’ s feet .
CEB	Matthew	5	14	You are the light of the world . A city on top of a hill can ’ t be hidden .
CEB	Matthew	5	15	Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a basket . Instead , they put it on top of a lampstand , and it shines on all who are in the house .
CEB	Matthew	5	16	In the same way , let your light shine before people , so they can see the good things you do and praise your Father who is in heaven . Jesus and the Law
CEB	Matthew	5	17	“ Don ’ t even begin to think that I have come to do away with the Law and the Prophets . I haven ’ t come to do away with them but to fulfill them .
CEB	Matthew	5	18	I say to you very seriously that as long as heaven and earth exist , neither the smallest letter nor even the smallest stroke of a pen will be erased from the Law until everything there becomes a reality .
CEB	Matthew	5	19	Therefore , whoever ignores one of the least of these commands and teaches others to do the same will be called the lowest in the kingdom of heaven . But whoever keeps these commands and teaches people to keep them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven .
CEB	Matthew	5	20	I say to you that unless your righteousness is greater than the righteousness of the legal experts and the Pharisees , you will never enter the kingdom of heaven . Law of murder
CEB	Matthew	5	21	“ You have heard that it was said to those who lived long ago , Don ’ t commit murder , [ a ] and all who commit murder will be in danger of judgment .
CEB	Matthew	5	22	But I say to you that everyone who is angry with their brother or sister will be in danger of judgment . If they say to their brother or sister , ‘ You idiot , ’ they will be in danger of being condemned by the governing council . And if they say , ‘ You fool , ’ they will be in danger of fiery hell .
CEB	Matthew	5	23	Therefore , if you bring your gift to the altar and there remember that your brother or sister has something against you ,
CEB	Matthew	5	24	leave your gift at the altar and go . First make things right with your brother or sister and then come back and offer your gift .
CEB	Matthew	5	25	Be sure to make friends quickly with your opponents while you are with them on the way to court . Otherwise , they will haul you before the judge , the judge will turn you over to the officer of the court , and you will be thrown into prison .
CEB	Matthew	5	26	I say to you in all seriousness that you won ’ t get out of there until you ’ ve paid the very last penny . Law of adultery
CEB	Matthew	5	27	“ You have heard that it was said , Don ’ t commit adultery . [ b ]
CEB	Matthew	5	28	But I say to you that every man who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery in his heart .
CEB	Matthew	5	29	And if your right eye causes you to fall into sin , tear it out and throw it away . It ’ s better that you lose a part of your body than that your whole body be thrown into hell .
CEB	Matthew	5	30	And if your right hand causes you to fall into sin , chop it off and throw it away . It ’ s better that you lose a part of your body than that your whole body go into hell . Law of divorce
CEB	Matthew	5	31	“ It was said , ‘ Whoever divorces his wife must give her a divorce certificate. ’ [ c ]
CEB	Matthew	5	32	But I say to you that whoever divorces his wife except for sexual unfaithfulness forces her to commit adultery . And whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery . Law of solemn pledges
CEB	Matthew	5	33	“ Again you have heard that it was said to those who lived long ago : Don ’ t make a false solemn pledge , but you should follow through on what you have pledged to the Lord . [ d ]
CEB	Matthew	5	34	But I say to you that you must not pledge at all . You must not pledge by heaven , because it ’ s God ’ s throne .
CEB	Matthew	5	35	You must not pledge by the earth , because it ’ s God ’ s footstool . You must not pledge by Jerusalem , because it ’ s the city of the great king .
CEB	Matthew	5	36	And you must not pledge by your head , because you can ’ t turn one hair white or black .
CEB	Matthew	5	37	Let your yes mean yes , and your no mean no . Anything more than this comes from the evil one . Law of retaliation
CEB	Matthew	5	38	“ You have heard that it was said , An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth . [ e ]
CEB	Matthew	5	39	But I say to you that you must not oppose those who want to hurt you . If people slap you on your right cheek , you must turn the left cheek to them as well .
CEB	Matthew	5	40	When they wish to haul you to court and take your shirt , let them have your coat too .
CEB	Matthew	5	41	When they force you to go one mile , go with them two .
CEB	Matthew	5	42	Give to those who ask , and don ’ t refuse those who wish to borrow from you . Law of love
CEB	Matthew	5	43	“ You have heard that it was said , You must love your neighbor [ f ] and hate your enemy .
CEB	Matthew	5	44	But I say to you , love your enemies and pray for those who harass you
CEB	Matthew	5	45	so that you will be acting as children of your Father who is in heaven . He makes the sun rise on both the evil and the good and sends rain on both the righteous and the unrighteous .
CEB	Matthew	5	46	If you love only those who love you , what reward do you have ? Don ’ t even the tax collectors do the same ?
CEB	Matthew	5	47	And if you greet only your brothers and sisters , what more are you doing ? Don ’ t even the Gentiles do the same ?
CEB	Matthew	5	48	Therefore , just as your heavenly Father is complete in showing love to everyone , so also you must be complete .
CEB	Matthew	6	6	But when you pray , go to your room , shut the door , and pray to your Father who is present in that secret place . Your Father who sees what you do in secret will reward you . Proper prayer
CEB	Matthew	6	2	“ Whenever you give to the poor , don ’ t blow your trumpet as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets so that they may get praise from people . I assure you , that ’ s the only reward they ’ ll get .
CEB	Matthew	6	3	But when you give to the poor , don ’ t let your left hand know what your right hand is doing
CEB	Matthew	6	4	so that you may give to the poor in secret . Your Father who sees what you do in secret will reward you . Showy prayer
CEB	Matthew	6	5	“ When you pray , don ’ t be like hypocrites . They love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners so that people will see them . I assure you , that ’ s the only reward they ’ ll get .
CEB	Matthew	6	7	“ When you pray , don ’ t pour out a flood of empty words , as the Gentiles do . They think that by saying many words they ’ ll be heard .
CEB	Matthew	6	8	Don ’ t be like them , because your Father knows what you need before you ask .
CEB	Matthew	6	9	Pray like this : Our Father who is in heaven , uphold the holiness of your name .
CEB	Matthew	6	10	Bring in your kingdom so that your will is done on earth as it ’ s done in heaven .
CEB	Matthew	6	11	Give us the bread we need for today .
CEB	Matthew	6	12	Forgive us for the ways we have wronged you , just as we also forgive those who have wronged us .
CEB	Matthew	6	13	And don ’ t lead us into temptation , but rescue us from the evil one .
CEB	Matthew	6	14	“ If you forgive others their sins , your heavenly Father will also forgive you .
CEB	Matthew	6	15	But if you don ’ t forgive others , neither will your Father forgive your sins . Showy fasting
CEB	Matthew	6	16	“ And when you fast , don ’ t put on a sad face like the hypocrites . They distort their faces so people will know they are fasting . I assure you that they have their reward .
CEB	Matthew	6	17	When you fast , brush your hair and wash your face .
CEB	Matthew	6	18	Then you won ’ t look like you are fasting to people , but only to your Father who is present in that secret place . Your Father who sees in secret will reward you . Earthly and heavenly treasures
CEB	Matthew	6	19	“ Stop collecting treasures for your own benefit on earth , where moth and rust eat them and where thieves break in and steal them .
CEB	Matthew	6	20	Instead , collect treasures for yourselves in heaven , where moth and rust don ’ t eat them and where thieves don ’ t break in and steal them .
CEB	Matthew	6	21	Where your treasure is , there your heart will be also . Seeing and serving
CEB	Matthew	6	22	“ The eye is the lamp of the body . Therefore , if your eye is healthy , your whole body will be full of light .
CEB	Matthew	6	23	But if your eye is bad , your whole body will be full of darkness . If then the light in you is darkness , how terrible that darkness will be !
CEB	Matthew	6	24	No one can serve two masters . Either you will hate the one and love the other , or you will be loyal to the one and have contempt for the other . You can not serve God and wealth . Worry about necessities
CEB	Matthew	6	25	“ Therefore , I say to you , don ’ t worry about your life , what you ’ ll eat or what you ’ ll drink , or about your body , what you ’ ll wear . Isn ’ t life more than food and the body more than clothes ?
CEB	Matthew	6	26	Look at the birds in the sky . They don ’ t sow seed or harvest grain or gather crops into barns . Yet your heavenly Father feeds them . Aren ’ t you worth much more than they are ?
CEB	Matthew	6	27	Who among you by worrying can add a single moment to your life ?
CEB	Matthew	6	28	And why do you worry about clothes ? Notice how the lilies in the field grow . They don ’ t wear themselves out with work , and they don ’ t spin cloth .
CEB	Matthew	6	29	But I say to you that even Solomon in all of his splendor wasn ’ t dressed like one of these .
CEB	Matthew	6	30	If God dresses grass in the field so beautifully , even though it ’ s alive today and tomorrow it ’ s thrown into the furnace , won ’ t God do much more for you , you people of weak faith ?
CEB	Matthew	6	31	Therefore , don ’ t worry and say , ‘ What are we going to eat ? ’ or ‘ What are we going to drink ? ’ or ‘ What are we going to wear ? ’
CEB	Matthew	6	32	Gentiles long for all these things . Your heavenly Father knows that you need them .
CEB	Matthew	6	33	Instead , desire first and foremost God ’ s kingdom and God ’ s righteousness , and all these things will be given to you as well .
CEB	Matthew	6	34	Therefore , stop worrying about tomorrow , because tomorrow will worry about itself . Each day has enough trouble of its own .
CEB	Matthew	7	7	“ Ask , and you will receive . Search , and you will find . Knock , and the door will be opened to you .
CEB	Matthew	7	2	You ’ ll receive the same judgment you give . Whatever you deal out will be dealt out to you .
CEB	Matthew	7	3	Why do you see the splinter that ’ s in your brother ’ s or sister ’ s eye , but don ’ t notice the log in your own eye ?
CEB	Matthew	7	4	How can you say to your brother or sister , ‘ Let me take the splinter out of your eye , ’ when there ’ s a log in your eye ?
CEB	Matthew	7	5	You deceive yourself ! First take the log out of your eye , and then you ’ ll see clearly to take the splinter out of your brother ’ s or sister ’ s eye .
CEB	Matthew	7	6	Don ’ t give holy things to dogs , and don ’ t throw your pearls in front of pigs . They will stomp on the pearls , then turn around and attack you . Asking , seeking , knocking
CEB	Matthew	7	8	For everyone who asks , receives . Whoever seeks , finds . And to everyone who knocks , the door is opened .
CEB	Matthew	7	9	Who among you will give your children a stone when they ask for bread ?
CEB	Matthew	7	10	Or give them a snake when they ask for fish ?
CEB	Matthew	7	11	If you who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children , how much more will your heavenly Father give good things to those who ask him .
CEB	Matthew	7	12	Therefore , you should treat people in the same way that you want people to treat you ; this is the Law and the Prophets . Narrow gate
CEB	Matthew	7	13	“ Go in through the narrow gate . The gate that leads to destruction is broad and the road wide , so many people enter through it .
CEB	Matthew	7	14	But the gate that leads to life is narrow and the road difficult , so few people find it . Tree and fruit
CEB	Matthew	7	15	“ Watch out for false prophets . They come to you dressed like sheep , but inside they are vicious wolves .
CEB	Matthew	7	16	You will know them by their fruit . Do people get bunches of grapes from thorny weeds , or do they get figs from thistles ?
CEB	Matthew	7	17	In the same way , every good tree produces good fruit , and every rotten tree produces bad fruit .
CEB	Matthew	7	18	A good tree can ’ t produce bad fruit . And a rotten tree can ’ t produce good fruit .
CEB	Matthew	7	19	Every tree that doesn ’ t produce good fruit is chopped down and thrown into the fire .
CEB	Matthew	7	20	Therefore , you will know them by their fruit . Entrance requirements
CEB	Matthew	7	21	“ Not everybody who says to me , ‘ Lord , Lord , ’ will get into the kingdom of heaven . Only those who do the will of my Father who is in heaven will enter .
CEB	Matthew	7	22	On the Judgment Day , many people will say to me , ‘ Lord , Lord , didn ’ t we prophesy in your name and expel demons in your name and do lots of miracles in your name ? ’
CEB	Matthew	7	23	Then I ’ ll tell them , ‘ I ’ ve never known you . Get away from me , you people who do wrong. ’ Two foundations
CEB	Matthew	7	24	“ Everybody who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise builder who built a house on bedrock .
CEB	Matthew	7	25	The rain fell , the floods came , and the wind blew and beat against that house . It didn ’ t fall because it was firmly set on bedrock .
CEB	Matthew	7	26	But everybody who hears these words of mine and doesn ’ t put them into practice will be like a fool who built a house on sand .
CEB	Matthew	7	27	The rain fell , the floods came , and the wind blew and beat against that house . It fell and was completely destroyed. ” Crowd ’ s response
CEB	Matthew	7	28	When Jesus finished these words , the crowds were amazed at his teaching
CEB	Matthew	7	29	because he was teaching them like someone with authority and not like their legal experts .
CEB	Matthew	8	8	But the centurion replied , “ Lord , I don ’ t deserve to have you come under my roof . Just say the word and my servant will be healed .
CEB	Matthew	8	2	A man with a skin disease came , kneeled before him , and said , “ Lord , if you want , you can make me clean. ”
CEB	Matthew	8	3	Jesus reached out his hand and touched him , saying , “ I do want to . Become clean. ” Instantly his skin disease was cleansed .
CEB	Matthew	8	4	Jesus said to him , “ Don ’ t say anything to anyone . Instead , go and show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded . This will be a testimony to them. ” Healing of the centurion ’ s servant
CEB	Matthew	8	5	When Jesus went to Capernaum , a centurion approached ,
CEB	Matthew	8	6	pleading with him , “ Lord , my servant is flat on his back at home , paralyzed , and his suffering is awful. ”
CEB	Matthew	8	7	Jesus responded , “ I ’ ll come and heal him. ”
CEB	Matthew	8	9	I ’ m a man under authority , with soldiers under me . I say to one , ‘ Go , ’ and he goes , and to another , ‘ Come , ’ and he comes . I say to my servant , ‘ Do this , ’ and the servant does it. ”
CEB	Matthew	8	10	When Jesus heard this , he was impressed and said to the people following him , “ I say to you with all seriousness that even in Israel I haven ’ t found faith like this .
CEB	Matthew	8	11	I say to you that there are many who will come from east and west and sit down to eat with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven .
CEB	Matthew	8	12	But the children of the kingdom will be thrown outside into the darkness . People there will be weeping and grinding their teeth. ”
CEB	Matthew	8	13	Jesus said to the centurion , “ Go ; it will be done for you just as you have believed. ” And his servant was healed that very moment . Healing of many people
CEB	Matthew	8	14	Jesus went home with Peter and saw Peter ’ s mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever .
CEB	Matthew	8	15	He touched her hand , and the fever left her . Then she got up and served them .
CEB	Matthew	8	16	That evening people brought to Jesus many who were demon-possessed . He threw the spirits out with just a word . He healed everyone who was sick .
CEB	Matthew	8	17	This happened so that what Isaiah the prophet said would be fulfilled : He is the one who took our illnesses and carried away our diseases . [ a ] Discussions about following
CEB	Matthew	8	18	Now when Jesus saw the crowd , he ordered his disciples to go over to the other side of the lake .
CEB	Matthew	8	19	A legal expert came and said to him , “ Teacher , I ’ ll follow you wherever you go. ”
CEB	Matthew	8	20	Jesus replied , “ Foxes have dens , and the birds in the sky have nests , but the Human One [ b ] has no place to lay his head. ”
CEB	Matthew	8	21	Another man , one of his disciples , said to him , “ Lord , first let me go and bury my father. ”
CEB	Matthew	8	22	But Jesus said to him , “ Follow me , and let the dead bury their own dead. ” Calming a storm
CEB	Matthew	8	23	When Jesus got into a boat , his disciples followed him .
CEB	Matthew	8	24	A huge storm arose on the lake so that waves were sloshing over the boat . But Jesus was asleep .
CEB	Matthew	8	25	They came and woke him , saying , “ Lord , rescue us ! We ’ re going to drown ! ”
CEB	Matthew	8	26	He said to them , “ Why are you afraid , you people of weak faith ? ” Then he got up and gave orders to the winds and the lake , and there was a great calm .
CEB	Matthew	8	27	The people were amazed and said , “ What kind of person is this ? Even the winds and the lake obey him ! ” Jesus frees demon-possessed men
CEB	Matthew	8	28	When Jesus arrived on the other side of the lake in the country of the Gadarenes , two men who were demon-possessed came from among the tombs to meet him . They were so violent that nobody could travel on that road .
CEB	Matthew	8	29	They cried out , “ What are you going to do with us , Son of God ? Have you come to torture us before the time of judgment ? ”
CEB	Matthew	8	30	Far off in the distance a large herd of pigs was feeding .
CEB	Matthew	8	31	The demons pleaded with him , “ If you throw us out , send us into the herd of pigs. ”
CEB	Matthew	8	32	Then he said to the demons , “ Go away , ” and they came out and went into the pigs . The whole herd rushed down the cliff into the lake and drowned .
CEB	Matthew	8	33	Those who tended the pigs ran into the city and told everything that had happened to the demon-possessed men .
CEB	Matthew	8	34	Then the whole city came out and met Jesus . When they saw him , they pleaded with him to leave their region . Footnotes - Matthew 8:17 Isa 53:4 - Matthew 8:20 Or Son of Man
CEB	Matthew	9	9	As Jesus continued on from there , he saw a man named Matthew sitting at a kiosk for collecting taxes . He said to him , “ Follow me , ” and he got up and followed him .
CEB	Matthew	9	2	People brought to him a man who was paralyzed , lying on a cot . When Jesus saw their faith , he said to the man who was paralyzed , “ Be encouraged , my child , your sins are forgiven. ”
CEB	Matthew	9	3	Some legal experts said among themselves , “ This man is insulting God. ”
CEB	Matthew	9	4	But Jesus knew what they were thinking and said , “ Why do you fill your minds with evil things ?
CEB	Matthew	9	5	Which is easier—to say , ‘ Your sins are forgiven , ’ or to say , ‘ Get up and walk ’ ?
CEB	Matthew	9	6	But so you will know that the Human One [ a ] has authority on the earth to forgive sins ” —he said to the man who was paralyzed— “ Get up , take your cot , and go home. ”
CEB	Matthew	9	7	The man got up and went home .
CEB	Matthew	9	8	When the crowds saw what had happened , they were afraid and praised God , who had given such authority to human beings . Calling of Matthew
CEB	Matthew	9	10	As Jesus sat down to eat in Matthew ’ s house , many tax collectors and sinners joined Jesus and his disciples at the table .
CEB	Matthew	9	11	But when the Pharisees saw this , they said to his disciples , “ Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners ? ”
CEB	Matthew	9	12	When Jesus heard it , he said , “ Healthy people don ’ t need a doctor , but sick people do .
CEB	Matthew	9	13	Go and learn what this means : I want mercy and not sacrifice . [ b ] I didn ’ t come to call righteous people , but sinners. ” Question about fasting
CEB	Matthew	9	14	At that time John ’ s disciples came and asked Jesus , “ Why do we and the Pharisees frequently fast , but your disciples never fast ? ”
CEB	Matthew	9	15	Jesus responded , “ The wedding guests can ’ t mourn while the groom is still with them , can they ? But the days will come when the groom will be taken away from them , and then they ’ ll fast .
CEB	Matthew	9	16	“ No one sews a piece of new , unshrunk cloth on old clothes because the patch tears away the cloth and makes a worse tear .
CEB	Matthew	9	17	No one pours new wine into old wineskins . If they did , the wineskins would burst , the wine would spill , and the wineskins would be ruined . Instead , people pour new wine into new wineskins so that both are kept safe. ” A ruler ’ s daughter and the woman who touched Jesus ’ clothes
CEB	Matthew	9	18	While Jesus was speaking to them , a ruler came and knelt in front of him , saying , “ My daughter has just died . But come and place your hand on her , and she ’ ll live. ”
CEB	Matthew	9	19	So Jesus and his disciples got up and went with him .
CEB	Matthew	9	20	Then a woman who had been bleeding for twelve years came up behind Jesus and touched the hem of his clothes .
CEB	Matthew	9	21	She thought , If I only touch his robe I ’ ll be healed .
CEB	Matthew	9	22	When Jesus turned and saw her , he said , “ Be encouraged , daughter . Your faith has healed you. ” And the woman was healed from that time on .
CEB	Matthew	9	23	When Jesus went into the ruler ’ s house , he saw the flute players and the distressed crowd .
CEB	Matthew	9	24	He said , “ Go away , because the little girl isn ’ t dead but is asleep ” ; but they laughed at him .
CEB	Matthew	9	25	After he had sent the crowd away , Jesus went in and touched her hand , and the little girl rose up .
CEB	Matthew	9	26	News about this spread throughout that whole region . Healing of two blind men
CEB	Matthew	9	27	As Jesus departed , two blind men followed him , crying out , “ Show us mercy , Son of David. ”
CEB	Matthew	9	28	When he came into the house , the blind men approached him . Jesus said to them , “ Do you believe I can do this ? ” “ Yes , Lord , ” they replied .
CEB	Matthew	9	29	Then Jesus touched their eyes and said , “ It will happen for you just as you have believed. ”
CEB	Matthew	9	30	Their eyes were opened . Then Jesus sternly warned them , “ Make sure nobody knows about this. ”
CEB	Matthew	9	31	But they went out and spread the word about him throughout that whole region . Healing of a man unable to speak
CEB	Matthew	9	32	As they were leaving , people brought to him a man who was demon-possessed and unable to speak .
CEB	Matthew	9	33	When Jesus had thrown out the demon , the man who couldn ’ t speak began to talk . The crowds were amazed and said , “ Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel. ”
CEB	Matthew	9	34	But the Pharisees said , “ He throws out demons with the authority of the ruler of demons. ” Compassion
CEB	Matthew	9	35	Jesus traveled among all the cities and villages , teaching in their synagogues , announcing the good news of the kingdom , and healing every disease and every sickness .
CEB	Matthew	9	36	Now when Jesus saw the crowds , he had compassion for them because they were troubled and helpless , like sheep without a shepherd .
CEB	Matthew	9	37	Then he said to his disciples , “ The size of the harvest is bigger than you can imagine , but there are few workers .
CEB	Matthew	9	38	Therefore , plead with the Lord of the harvest to send out workers for his harvest. ” Footnotes - Matthew 9:6 Or Son of Man - Matthew 9:13 Hos 6:6

CEB	Matthew	10	5	Jesus sent these twelve out and commanded them , “ Don ’ t go among the Gentiles or into a Samaritan city .
CEB	Matthew	10	6	Go instead to the lost sheep , the people of Israel .
CEB	Matthew	10	7	As you go , make this announcement : ‘ The kingdom of heaven has come near. ’

CEB	Matthew	10	15	I assure you that it will be more bearable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah on Judgment Day than it will be for that city . Response to harassment
CEB	Matthew	10	16	“ Look , I ’ m sending you as sheep among wolves . Therefore , be wise as snakes and innocent as doves .
CEB	Matthew	10	17	Watch out for people—because they will hand you over to councils and they will beat you in their synagogues .
CEB	Matthew	10	18	They will haul you in front of governors and even kings because of me so that you may give your testimony to them and to the Gentiles .
CEB	Matthew	10	19	Whenever they hand you over , don ’ t worry about how to speak or what you will say , because what you can say will be given to you at that moment .
CEB	Matthew	10	20	You aren ’ t doing the talking , but the Spirit of my Father is doing the talking through you .
CEB	Matthew	10	21	Brothers and sisters will hand each other over to be executed . A father will turn his child in . Children will defy their parents and have them executed .
CEB	Matthew	10	22	Everyone will hate you on account of my name . But whoever stands firm until the end will be saved .
CEB	Matthew	10	23	Whenever they harass you in one city , escape to the next , because I assure that you will not go through all the cities of Israel before the Human One [ b ] comes .
CEB	Matthew	10	24	“ Disciples aren ’ t greater than their teacher , and slaves aren ’ t greater than their master .
CEB	Matthew	10	25	It ’ s enough for disciples to be like their teacher and slaves like their master . If they have called the head of the house Beelzebul , it ’ s certain that they will call the members of his household by even worse names . Whom to fear
CEB	Matthew	10	26	“ Therefore , don ’ t be afraid of those people because nothing is hidden that won ’ t be revealed , and nothing secret that won ’ t be brought out into the open .

CEB	Matthew	10	32	“ Therefore , everyone who acknowledges me before people , I also will acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven .

CEB	Matthew	10	34	“ Don ’ t think that I ’ ve come to bring peace to the earth . I haven ’ t come to bring peace but a sword .
CEB	Matthew	10	35	I ’ ve come to turn a man against his father , a daughter against her mother , and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law .

CEB	Matthew	11	2	Now when John heard in prison about the things the Christ was doing , he sent word by his disciples to Jesus , asking ,
CEB	Matthew	11	3	“ Are you the one who is to come , or should we look for another ? ”
CEB	Matthew	11	4	Jesus responded , “ Go , report to John what you hear and see .
CEB	Matthew	11	5	Those who were blind are able to see . Those who were crippled are walking . People with skin diseases are cleansed . Those who were deaf now hear . Those who were dead are raised up . The poor have good news proclaimed to them . [ a ]
CEB	Matthew	11	6	Happy are those who don ’ t stumble and fall because of me. ” Appeal of John ’ s ministry
CEB	Matthew	11	7	When John ’ s disciples had gone , Jesus spoke to the crowds about John : “ What did you go out to the wilderness to see ? A stalk blowing in the wind ?
CEB	Matthew	11	8	What did you go out to see ? A man dressed up in refined clothes ? Look , those who wear refined clothes are in royal palaces .
CEB	Matthew	11	9	What did you go out to see ? A prophet ? Yes , I tell you , and more than a prophet .
CEB	Matthew	11	10	He is the one of whom it is written : Look , I ’ m sending my messenger before you , who will prepare your way before you . [ b ] Significance of John ’ s ministry
CEB	Matthew	11	12	From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven is violently attacked as violent people seize it .
CEB	Matthew	11	13	All the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John came .
CEB	Matthew	11	14	If you are willing to accept it , he is Elijah who is to come .
CEB	Matthew	11	15	Let the person who has ears , hear . This generation
CEB	Matthew	11	16	“ To what will I compare this generation ? It is like a child sitting in the marketplaces calling out to others ,
CEB	Matthew	11	17	‘ We played the flute for you and you didn ’ t dance . We sang a funeral song and you didn ’ t mourn. ’
CEB	Matthew	11	18	For John came neither eating nor drinking , and they say , ‘ He has a demon. ’
CEB	Matthew	11	19	Yet the Human One [ c ] came eating and drinking , and they say , ‘ Look , a glutton and a drunk , a friend of tax collectors and sinners. ’ But wisdom is proved to be right by her works. ” Condemnation of Bethsaida and Capernaum
CEB	Matthew	11	20	Then he began to scold the cities where he had done his greatest miracles because they didn ’ t change their hearts and lives .
CEB	Matthew	11	21	“ How terrible it will be for you , Chorazin ! How terrible it will be for you , Bethsaida ! For if the miracles done among you had been done in Tyre and Sidon , they would have changed their hearts and lives and put on funeral clothes and ashes a long time ago .
CEB	Matthew	11	22	But I say to you that Tyre and Sidon will be better off on Judgment Day than you .
CEB	Matthew	11	23	And you , Capernaum , will you be honored by being raised up to heaven ? No , you will be thrown down to the place of the dead . After all , if the miracles that were done among you had been done in Sodom , it would still be here today .
CEB	Matthew	11	24	But I say to you that it will be better for the land of Sodom on the Judgment Day than it will be for you. ” The Father and the Son
CEB	Matthew	11	25	At that time Jesus said , “ I praise you , Father , Lord of heaven and earth , because you ’ ve hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have shown them to babies .
CEB	Matthew	11	26	Indeed , Father , this brings you happiness .
CEB	Matthew	11	27	“ My Father has handed all things over to me . No one knows the Son except the Father . And nobody knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son wants to reveal him .
CEB	Matthew	11	28	“ Come to me , all you who are struggling hard and carrying heavy loads , and I will give you rest .
CEB	Matthew	11	29	Put on my yoke , and learn from me . I ’ m gentle and humble . And you will find rest for yourselves .
CEB	Matthew	11	30	My yoke is easy to bear , and my burden is light. ” Footnotes - Matthew 11:5 Isa 35:5-6 ; 61:1 - Matthew 11:10 Mal 3:1 - Matthew 11:19 Or Son of Man
CEB	Matthew	12	12	How much more valuable is a person than a sheep ! So the Law allows a person to do what is good on the Sabbath. ”
CEB	Matthew	12	2	When the Pharisees saw this , they said to him , “ Look , your disciples are breaking the Sabbath law. ”
CEB	Matthew	12	3	But he said to them , “ Haven ’ t you read what David did when he and those with him were hungry ?
CEB	Matthew	12	4	He went into God ’ s house and broke the law by eating the bread of the presence , which only the priests were allowed to eat .
CEB	Matthew	12	5	Or haven ’ t you read in the Law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple treat the Sabbath as any other day and are still innocent ?
CEB	Matthew	12	6	But I tell you that something greater than the temple is here .
CEB	Matthew	12	7	If you had known what this means , I want mercy and not sacrifice , [ a ] you wouldn ’ t have condemned the innocent .
CEB	Matthew	12	8	The Human One [ b ] is Lord of the Sabbath. ” Healing on the Sabbath
CEB	Matthew	12	9	Jesus left that place and went into their synagogue .
CEB	Matthew	12	10	A man with a withered hand was there . Wanting to bring charges against Jesus , they asked , “ Does the Law allow a person to heal on the Sabbath ? ”
CEB	Matthew	12	11	Jesus replied , “ Who among you has a sheep that falls into a pit on the Sabbath and will not take hold of it and pull it out ?
CEB	Matthew	12	13	Then Jesus said to the man , “ Stretch out your hand. ” So he did and it was made healthy , just like the other one .
CEB	Matthew	12	14	The Pharisees went out and met in order to find a way to destroy Jesus . Healing the crowd
CEB	Matthew	12	15	Jesus knew what they intended to do , so he went away from there . Large crowds followed him , and he healed them all .
CEB	Matthew	12	16	But he ordered them not to spread the word about him ,
CEB	Matthew	12	17	so that what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled :
CEB	Matthew	12	18	Look , my Servant whom I chose , the one I love , in whom I find great pleasure . I ’ ll put my Spirit upon him , and he ’ ll announce judgment to the Gentiles .
CEB	Matthew	12	19	He won ’ t argue or shout , and nobody will hear his voice in the streets .
CEB	Matthew	12	20	He won ’ t break a bent stalk , and he won ’ t snuff out a smoldering wick , until he makes justice win .
CEB	Matthew	12	21	And the Gentiles will put their hope in his name . [ c ]
CEB	Matthew	12	22	They brought to Jesus a demon-possessed man who was blind and unable to speak . Jesus healed him so that he could both speak and see .
CEB	Matthew	12	23	All the crowds were amazed and said , “ This man couldn ’ t be the Son of David , could he ? ”
CEB	Matthew	12	24	When the Pharisees heard , they said , “ This man throws out demons only by the authority of Beelzebul , the ruler of the demons. ”
CEB	Matthew	12	25	Because Jesus knew what they were thinking , he replied , “ Every kingdom involved in civil war becomes a wasteland . Every city or house torn apart by divisions will collapse .
CEB	Matthew	12	26	If Satan throws out Satan , he is at war with himself . How then can his kingdom endure ?
CEB	Matthew	12	27	And if I throw out demons by the authority of Beelzebul , then by whose authority do your followers throw them out ? Therefore , they will be your judges .
CEB	Matthew	12	28	But if I throw out demons by the power of God ’ s Spirit , then God ’ s kingdom has already overtaken you .
CEB	Matthew	12	29	Can people go into a house that belongs to a strong man and steal his possessions , unless they first tie up the strong man ? Then they can rob his house .
CEB	Matthew	12	30	Whoever isn ’ t with me is against me , and whoever doesn ’ t gather with me scatters . Insulting the Holy Spirit
CEB	Matthew	12	31	“ Therefore , I tell you that people will be forgiven for every sin and insult to God . But insulting the Holy Spirit won ’ t be forgiven .
CEB	Matthew	12	32	And whoever speaks a word against the Human One [ d ] will be forgiven . But whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit won ’ t be forgiven , not in this age or in the age that is coming . Trees and fruits
CEB	Matthew	12	33	“ Either consider the tree good and its fruit good , or consider the tree rotten and its fruit rotten . A tree is known by its fruit .
CEB	Matthew	12	34	Children of snakes ! How can you speak good things while you are evil ? What fills the heart comes out of the mouth .
CEB	Matthew	12	35	Good people bring out good things from their good treasure . But evil people bring out evil things from their evil treasure .
CEB	Matthew	12	36	I tell you that people will have to answer on Judgment Day for every useless word they speak .
CEB	Matthew	12	37	By your words you will be either judged innocent or condemned as guilty. ” Request for a sign
CEB	Matthew	12	38	At that time some of the legal experts and the Pharisees requested of Jesus , “ Teacher , we would like to see a sign from you. ”
CEB	Matthew	12	39	But he replied , “ An evil and unfaithful generation searches for a sign , but it won ’ t receive any sign except Jonah ’ s sign .
CEB	Matthew	12	40	Just as Jonah was in the whale ’ s belly for three days and three nights , [ e ] so the Human One [ f ] will be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights .
CEB	Matthew	12	41	The citizens of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it as guilty , because they changed their hearts and lives in response to Jonah ’ s preaching . And look , someone greater than Jonah is here .
CEB	Matthew	12	42	The queen of the South will be raised up by God at the judgment with this generation and condemn it because she came from a distant land to hear Solomon ’ s wisdom . And look , someone greater than Solomon is here . Unclean spirit seeking a home
CEB	Matthew	12	43	“ When an unclean spirit leaves a person , it wanders through dry places looking for a place to rest . But it doesn ’ t find any .
CEB	Matthew	12	44	Then it says , ‘ I ’ ll go back to the house I left. ’ When it arrives , it finds the place vacant , cleaned up , and decorated .
CEB	Matthew	12	45	Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more evil than itself . They go in and make their home there . That person is worse off at the end than at the beginning . This is the way it will be also for this evil generation. ” Jesus ’ family
CEB	Matthew	12	46	While Jesus was speaking to the crowds , his mother and brothers stood outside trying to speak with him .
CEB	Matthew	12	47	Someone said to him , “ Look , your mother and brothers are outside wanting to speak with you. ”
CEB	Matthew	12	48	Jesus replied , “ Who is my mother ? Who are my brothers ? ”
CEB	Matthew	12	49	He stretched out his hand toward his disciples and said , “ Look , here are my mother and my brothers .
CEB	Matthew	12	50	Whoever does the will of my Father who is in heaven is my brother , sister , and mother. ” Footnotes - Matthew 12:7 Hos 6:6 - Matthew 12:8 Or Son of Man - Matthew 12:21 Isa 42:1-4 - Matthew 12:32 Or Son of Man - Matthew 12:40 Jonah 1:17 - Matthew 12:40 Or Son of Man
CEB	Matthew	13	13	This is why I speak to the crowds in parables : although they see , they don ’ t really see ; and although they hear , they don ’ t really hear or understand .
CEB	Matthew	13	2	Such large crowds gathered around him that he climbed into a boat and sat down . The whole crowd was standing on the shore . Parable of the soils
CEB	Matthew	13	3	He said many things to them in parables : “ A farmer went out to scatter seed .
CEB	Matthew	13	4	As he was scattering seed , some fell on the path , and birds came and ate it .
CEB	Matthew	13	5	Other seed fell on rocky ground where the soil was shallow . They sprouted immediately because the soil wasn ’ t deep .
CEB	Matthew	13	6	But when the sun came up , it scorched the plants , and they dried up because they had no roots .
CEB	Matthew	13	7	Other seed fell among thorny plants . The thorny plants grew and choked them .
CEB	Matthew	13	8	Other seed fell on good soil and bore fruit , in one case a yield of one hundred to one , in another case a yield of sixty to one , and in another case a yield of thirty to one .
CEB	Matthew	13	9	Everyone who has ears should pay attention. ” Why Jesus speaks in parables
CEB	Matthew	13	10	Jesus ’ disciples came and said to him , “ Why do you use parables when you speak to the crowds ? ”
CEB	Matthew	13	11	Jesus replied , “ Because they haven ’ t received the secrets of the kingdom of heaven , but you have .
CEB	Matthew	13	12	For those who have will receive more and they will have more than enough . But as for those who don ’ t have , even the little they have will be taken away from them .
CEB	Matthew	13	14	What Isaiah prophesied has become completely true for them : You will hear , to be sure , but never understand ; and you will certainly see but never recognize what you are seeing .
CEB	Matthew	13	15	For this people ’ s senses have become calloused , and they ’ ve become hard of hearing , and they ’ ve shut their eyes so that they won ’ t see with their eyes or hear with their ears or understand with their minds , and change their hearts and lives that I may heal them . [ a ]
CEB	Matthew	13	16	“ Happy are your eyes because they see . Happy are your ears because they hear .
CEB	Matthew	13	17	I assure you that many prophets and righteous people wanted to see what you see and hear what you hear , but they didn ’ t . Explanation of the parable of the farmer
CEB	Matthew	13	18	“ Consider then the parable of the farmer .
CEB	Matthew	13	19	Whenever people hear the word about the kingdom and don ’ t understand it , the evil one comes and carries off what was planted in their hearts . This is the seed that was sown on the path .
CEB	Matthew	13	20	As for the seed that was spread on rocky ground , this refers to people who hear the word and immediately receive it joyfully .
CEB	Matthew	13	21	Because they have no roots , they last for only a little while . When they experience distress or abuse because of the word , they immediately fall away .
CEB	Matthew	13	22	As for the seed that was spread among thorny plants , this refers to those who hear the word , but the worries of this life and the false appeal of wealth choke the word , and it bears no fruit .
CEB	Matthew	13	23	As for what was planted on good soil , this refers to those who hear and understand , and bear fruit and produce—in one case a yield of one hundred to one , in another case a yield of sixty to one , and in another case a yield of thirty to one. ” Parable of the weeds
CEB	Matthew	13	24	Jesus told them another parable : “ The kingdom of heaven is like someone who planted good seed in his field .
CEB	Matthew	13	25	While people were sleeping , an enemy came and planted weeds among the wheat and went away .
CEB	Matthew	13	26	When the stalks sprouted and bore grain , then the weeds also appeared .
CEB	Matthew	13	27	“ The servants of the landowner came and said to him , ‘ Master , didn ’ t you plant good seed in your field ? Then how is it that it has weeds ? ’
CEB	Matthew	13	28	“ ‘ An enemy has done this , ’ he answered . “ The servants said to him , ‘ Do you want us to go and gather them ? ’
CEB	Matthew	13	29	“ But the landowner said , ‘ No , because if you gather the weeds , you ’ ll pull up the wheat along with them .
CEB	Matthew	13	30	Let both grow side by side until the harvest . And at harvesttime I ’ ll say to the harvesters , “ First gather the weeds and tie them together in bundles to be burned . But bring the wheat into my barn. ” ’ ” Parable of the mustard seed
CEB	Matthew	13	31	He told another parable to them : “ The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that someone took and planted in his field .
CEB	Matthew	13	32	It ’ s the smallest of all seeds . But when it ’ s grown , it ’ s the largest of all vegetable plants . It becomes a tree so that the birds in the sky come and nest in its branches. ” Parable of the yeast
CEB	Matthew	13	33	He told them another parable : “ The kingdom of heaven is like yeast , which a woman took and hid in a bushel of wheat flour until the yeast had worked its way through all the dough. ” Purpose of parables to the crowds
CEB	Matthew	13	34	Jesus said all these things to the crowds in parables , and he spoke to them only in parables .
CEB	Matthew	13	35	This was to fulfill what the prophet spoke : I ’ ll speak in parables ; I ’ ll declare what has been hidden since the beginning of the world . [ b ] Explanation of the parable of the weeds
CEB	Matthew	13	36	Jesus left the crowds and went into the house . His disciples came to him and said , “ Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field. ”
CEB	Matthew	13	37	Jesus replied , “ The one who plants the good seed is the Human One . [ c ]
CEB	Matthew	13	38	The field is the world . And the good seeds are the followers of the kingdom . But the weeds are the followers of the evil one .
CEB	Matthew	13	39	The enemy who planted them is the devil . The harvest is the end of the present age . The harvesters are the angels .
CEB	Matthew	13	40	Just as people gather weeds and burn them in the fire , so it will be at the end of the present age .
CEB	Matthew	13	41	The Human One [ d ] will send his angels , and they will gather out of his kingdom all things that cause people to fall away and all people who sin .
CEB	Matthew	13	42	He will throw them into a burning furnace . People there will be weeping and grinding their teeth .
CEB	Matthew	13	43	Then the righteous will shine like the sun in their Father ’ s kingdom . Those who have ears should hear. ” Parable of the treasure
CEB	Matthew	13	44	“ The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure that somebody hid in a field , which someone else found and covered up . Full of joy , the finder sold everything and bought that field . Parable of the merchant
CEB	Matthew	13	45	“ Again , the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls .
CEB	Matthew	13	46	When he found one very precious pearl , he went and sold all that he owned and bought it . Parable of the net
CEB	Matthew	13	47	“ Again , the kingdom of heaven is like a net that people threw into the lake and gathered all kinds of fish .
CEB	Matthew	13	48	When it was full , they pulled it to the shore , where they sat down and put the good fish together into containers . But the bad fish they threw away .
CEB	Matthew	13	49	That ’ s the way it will be at the end of the present age . The angels will go out and separate the evil people from the righteous people ,
CEB	Matthew	13	50	and will throw the evil ones into a burning furnace . People there will be weeping and grinding their teeth . Treasures new and old
CEB	Matthew	13	51	“ Have you understood all these things ? ” Jesus asked . They said to him , “ Yes. ”
CEB	Matthew	13	52	Then he said to them , “ Therefore , every legal expert who has been trained as a disciple for the kingdom of heaven is like the head of a household who brings old and new things out of their treasure chest. ” Jesus in his hometown
CEB	Matthew	13	53	When Jesus finished these parables , he departed .
CEB	Matthew	13	54	When he came to his hometown , he taught the people in their synagogue . They were surprised and said , “ Where did he get this wisdom ? Where did he get the power to work miracles ?
CEB	Matthew	13	55	Isn ’ t he the carpenter ’ s son ? Isn ’ t his mother named Mary ? Aren ’ t James , Joseph , Simon , and Judas his brothers ?
CEB	Matthew	13	56	And his sisters , aren ’ t they here with us ? Where did this man get all this ? ”
CEB	Matthew	13	57	They were repulsed by him and fell into sin . But Jesus said to them , “ Prophets are honored everywhere except in their own hometowns and in their own households. ”
CEB	Matthew	13	58	He was unable to do many miracles there because of their disbelief . Footnotes - Matthew 13:15 Isa 6:9-10 - Matthew 13:35 Ps 78:2 - Matthew 13:37 Or Son of Man - Matthew 13:41 Or Son of Man
CEB	Matthew	14	14	When Jesus arrived and saw a large crowd , he had compassion for them and healed those who were sick .
CEB	Matthew	14	2	He said to his servants , “ This is John the Baptist . He ’ s been raised from the dead . This is why these miraculous powers are at work through him. ”
CEB	Matthew	14	3	Herod had arrested John , bound him , and put him in prison because of Herodias , the wife of Herod ’ s brother Philip .
CEB	Matthew	14	4	That ’ s because John told Herod , “ It ’ s against the law for you to marry her. ”
CEB	Matthew	14	5	Although Herod wanted to kill him , he feared the crowd because they thought John was a prophet .
CEB	Matthew	14	6	But at Herod ’ s birthday party Herodias ’ daughter danced in front of the guests and thrilled Herod .
CEB	Matthew	14	7	Then he swore to give her anything she asked .
CEB	Matthew	14	8	At her mother ’ s urging , the girl said , “ Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a plate. ”
CEB	Matthew	14	9	Although the king was upset , because of his solemn pledge and his guests he commanded that they give it to her .
CEB	Matthew	14	10	Then he had John beheaded in prison .
CEB	Matthew	14	11	They brought his head on a plate and gave it to the young woman , and she brought it to her mother .
CEB	Matthew	14	12	But John ’ s disciples came and took his body and buried it . Then they went and told Jesus what had happened . Feeding the five thousand
CEB	Matthew	14	13	When Jesus heard about John , he withdrew in a boat to a deserted place by himself . When the crowds learned this , they followed him on foot from the cities .
CEB	Matthew	14	15	That evening his disciples came and said to him , “ This is an isolated place and it ’ s getting late . Send the crowds away so they can go into the villages and buy food for themselves. ”
CEB	Matthew	14	16	But Jesus said to them , “ There ’ s no need to send them away . You give them something to eat. ”
CEB	Matthew	14	17	They replied , “ We have nothing here except five loaves of bread and two fish. ”
CEB	Matthew	14	18	He said , “ Bring them here to me. ”
CEB	Matthew	14	19	He ordered the crowds to sit down on the grass . He took the five loaves of bread and the two fish , looked up to heaven , blessed them and broke the loaves apart and gave them to his disciples . Then the disciples gave them to the crowds .
CEB	Matthew	14	20	Everyone ate until they were full , and they filled twelve baskets with the leftovers .
CEB	Matthew	14	21	About five thousand men plus women and children had eaten . Walking on the water
CEB	Matthew	14	22	Right then , Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go ahead to the other side of the lake while he dismissed the crowds .
CEB	Matthew	14	23	When he sent them away , he went up onto a mountain by himself to pray . Evening came and he was alone .
CEB	Matthew	14	24	Meanwhile , the boat , fighting a strong headwind , was being battered by the waves and was already far away from land .
CEB	Matthew	14	25	Very early in the morning he came to his disciples , walking on the lake .
CEB	Matthew	14	26	When the disciples saw him walking on the lake , they were terrified and said , “ It ’ s a ghost ! ” They were so frightened they screamed .
CEB	Matthew	14	27	Just then Jesus spoke to them , “ Be encouraged ! It ’ s me . Don ’ t be afraid. ”
CEB	Matthew	14	28	Peter replied , “ Lord , if it ’ s you , order me to come to you on the water. ”
CEB	Matthew	14	29	And Jesus said , “ Come. ” Then Peter got out of the boat and was walking on the water toward Jesus .
CEB	Matthew	14	30	But when Peter saw the strong wind , he became frightened . As he began to sink , he shouted , “ Lord , rescue me ! ”
CEB	Matthew	14	31	Jesus immediately reached out and grabbed him , saying , “ You man of weak faith ! Why did you begin to have doubts ? ”
CEB	Matthew	14	32	When they got into the boat , the wind settled down .
CEB	Matthew	14	33	Then those in the boat worshipped Jesus and said , “ You must be God ’ s Son ! ” Healing the sick
CEB	Matthew	14	34	When they had crossed the lake , they landed at Gennesaret .
CEB	Matthew	14	35	When the people who lived in that place recognized him , they sent word throughout that whole region , and they brought to him everyone who was sick .
CEB	Matthew	14	36	Then they begged him that they might just touch the edge of his clothes . Everyone who touched him was cured . Footnotes - Matthew 14:1 Or tetrarch , which refers to a prince over a small region
CEB	Matthew	15	15	Then Peter spoke up , “ Explain this riddle to us. ”
CEB	Matthew	15	2	“ Why are your disciples breaking the elders ’ rules handed down to us ? They don ’ t ritually purify their hands by washing before they eat. ”
CEB	Matthew	15	3	Jesus replied , “ Why do you break the command of God by keeping the rules handed down to you ?
CEB	Matthew	15	4	For God said , Honor your father and your mother , [ a ] and The person who speaks against father or mother will certainly be put to death . [ b ]
CEB	Matthew	15	5	But you say , ‘ If you tell your father or mother , “ Everything I ’ m expected to contribute to you I ’ m giving to God as a gift , ” then you don ’ t have to honor your father. ’
CEB	Matthew	15	6	So you do away with God ’ s Law for the sake of the rules that have been handed down to you .
CEB	Matthew	15	7	Hypocrites ! Isaiah really knew what he was talking about when he prophesied about you ,
CEB	Matthew	15	8	This people honors me with their lips , but their hearts are far away from me .
CEB	Matthew	15	9	Their worship of me is empty since they teach instructions that are human rules. ” [ c ]
CEB	Matthew	15	10	Jesus called the crowd near and said to them , “ Listen and understand .
CEB	Matthew	15	11	It ’ s not what goes into the mouth that contaminates a person in God ’ s sight . It ’ s what comes out of the mouth that contaminates the person. ”
CEB	Matthew	15	12	Then the disciples came and said to him , “ Do you know that the Pharisees were offended by what you just said ? ”
CEB	Matthew	15	13	Jesus replied , “ Every plant that my heavenly Father didn ’ t plant will be pulled up .
CEB	Matthew	15	14	Leave the Pharisees alone . They are blind people who are guides to blind people . But if a blind person leads another blind person , they will both fall into a ditch. ”
CEB	Matthew	15	16	Jesus said , “ Don ’ t you understand yet ?
CEB	Matthew	15	17	Don ’ t you know that everything that goes into the mouth enters the stomach and goes out into the sewer ?
CEB	Matthew	15	18	But what goes out of the mouth comes from the heart . And that ’ s what contaminates a person in God ’ s sight .
CEB	Matthew	15	19	Out of the heart come evil thoughts , murders , adultery , sexual sins , thefts , false testimonies , and insults .
CEB	Matthew	15	20	These contaminate a person in God ’ s sight . But eating without washing hands doesn ’ t contaminate in God ’ s sight. ” Canaanite woman
CEB	Matthew	15	21	From there , Jesus went to the regions of Tyre and Sidon .
CEB	Matthew	15	22	A Canaanite woman from those territories came out and shouted , “ Show me mercy , Son of David . My daughter is suffering terribly from demon possession. ”
CEB	Matthew	15	23	But he didn ’ t respond to her at all . His disciples came and urged him , “ Send her away ; she keeps shouting out after us. ”
CEB	Matthew	15	24	Jesus replied , “ I ’ ve been sent only to the lost sheep , the people of Israel. ”
CEB	Matthew	15	25	But she knelt before him and said , “ Lord , help me. ”
CEB	Matthew	15	26	He replied , “ It is not good to take the children ’ s bread and toss it to dogs. ”
CEB	Matthew	15	27	She said , “ Yes , Lord . But even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall off their masters ’ table. ”
CEB	Matthew	15	28	Jesus answered , “ Woman , you have great faith . It will be just as you wish. ” And right then her daughter was healed . Healing of many people
CEB	Matthew	15	29	Jesus moved on from there along the shore of the Galilee Sea . He went up a mountain and sat down .
CEB	Matthew	15	30	Large crowds came to him , including those who were paralyzed , blind , injured , and unable to speak , and many others . They laid them at his feet , and he healed them .
CEB	Matthew	15	31	So the crowd was amazed when they saw those who had been unable to speak talking , and the paralyzed cured , and the injured walking , and the blind seeing . And they praised the God of Israel . Feeding the four thousand
CEB	Matthew	15	32	Now Jesus called his disciples and said , “ I feel sorry for the crowd because they have been with me for three days and have nothing to eat . I don ’ t want to send them away hungry for fear they won ’ t have enough strength to travel. ”
CEB	Matthew	15	33	His disciples replied , “ Where are we going to get enough food in this wilderness to satisfy such a big crowd ? ”
CEB	Matthew	15	34	Jesus said , “ How much bread do you have ? ” They responded , “ Seven loaves and a few fish. ”
CEB	Matthew	15	35	He told the crowd to sit on the ground .
CEB	Matthew	15	36	He took the seven loaves of bread and the fish . After he gave thanks , he broke them into pieces and gave them to the disciples , and the disciples gave them to the crowds .
CEB	Matthew	15	37	Everyone ate until they were full . The disciples collected seven baskets full of leftovers .
CEB	Matthew	15	38	Four thousand men ate , plus women and children .
CEB	Matthew	15	39	After dismissing the crowds , Jesus got into the boat and came to the region of Magadan .
CEB	Matthew	16	16	Simon Peter said , “ You are the Christ , the Son of the living God. ”
CEB	Matthew	16	2	But he replied , “ At evening you say , ‘ It will be nice weather because the sky is bright red. ’
CEB	Matthew	16	3	And in the morning you say , ‘ There will be bad weather today because the sky is cloudy. ’ You know how to make sense of the sky ’ s appearance . But you are unable to recognize the signs that point to what the time is .
CEB	Matthew	16	4	An evil and unfaithful generation searches for a sign . But it won ’ t receive any sign except Jonah ’ s sign. ” Then he left them and went away . Yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees
CEB	Matthew	16	5	When the disciples arrived on the other side of the lake , they had forgotten to bring bread .
CEB	Matthew	16	6	Jesus said to them , “ Watch out and be on your guard for the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees. ”
CEB	Matthew	16	7	They discussed this among themselves and said , “ We didn ’ t bring any bread. ”
CEB	Matthew	16	8	Jesus knew what they were discussing and said , “ You people of weak faith ! Why are you discussing among yourselves the fact that you don ’ t have any bread ?
CEB	Matthew	16	9	Don ’ t you understand yet ? Don ’ t you remember the five loaves that fed the five thousand and how many baskets of leftovers you gathered ?
CEB	Matthew	16	10	And the seven loaves that fed the four thousand and how many large baskets of leftovers you gathered ?
CEB	Matthew	16	11	Don ’ t you know that I wasn ’ t talking about bread ? But be on your guard for the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees. ”
CEB	Matthew	16	12	Then they understood that he wasn ’ t telling them to be on their guard for yeast used in making bread . No , he was telling them to watch out for the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees . Peter ’ s declaration about Jesus
CEB	Matthew	16	13	Now when Jesus came to the area of Caesarea Philippi , he asked his disciples , “ Who do people say the Human One [ a ] is ? ”
CEB	Matthew	16	14	They replied , “ Some say John the Baptist , others Elijah , and still others Jeremiah or one of the other prophets. ”
CEB	Matthew	16	15	He said , “ And what about you ? Who do you say that I am ? ”
CEB	Matthew	16	17	Then Jesus replied , “ Happy are you , Simon son of Jonah , because no human has shown this to you . Rather my Father who is in heaven has shown you .
CEB	Matthew	16	18	I tell you that you are Peter . [ b ] And I ’ ll build my church on this rock . The gates of the underworld won ’ t be able to stand against it .
CEB	Matthew	16	19	I ’ ll give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven . Anything you fasten on earth will be fastened in heaven . Anything you loosen on earth will be loosened in heaven. ”
CEB	Matthew	16	20	Then he ordered the disciples not to tell anybody that he was the Christ . First prediction of Jesus ’ death and resurrection
CEB	Matthew	16	21	From that time Jesus began to show his disciples that he had to go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders , chief priests , and legal experts , and that he had to be killed and raised on the third day .
CEB	Matthew	16	22	Then Peter took hold of Jesus and , scolding him , began to correct him : “ God forbid , Lord ! This won ’ t happen to you. ”
CEB	Matthew	16	23	But he turned to Peter and said , “ Get behind me , Satan . You are a stone that could make me stumble , for you are not thinking God ’ s thoughts but human thoughts. ” Saving and losing life
CEB	Matthew	16	24	Then Jesus said to his disciples , “ All who want to come after me must say no to themselves , take up their cross , and follow me .
CEB	Matthew	16	25	All who want to save their lives will lose them . But all who lose their lives because of me will find them .
CEB	Matthew	16	26	Why would people gain the whole world but lose their lives ? What will people give in exchange for their lives ?
CEB	Matthew	16	27	For the Human One [ c ] is about to come with the majesty of his Father with his angels . And then he will repay each one for what that person has done .
CEB	Matthew	16	28	I assure you that some standing here won ’ t die before they see the Human One [ d ] coming in his kingdom. ” Footnotes - Matthew 16:13 Or Son of Man - Matthew 16:18 Peter means rock . - Matthew 16:27 Or Son of Man - Matthew 16:28 Or Son of Man
CEB	Matthew	17	17	Jesus answered , “ You faithless and crooked generation , how long will I be with you ? How long will I put up with you ? Bring the boy here to me. ”
CEB	Matthew	17	2	He was transformed in front of them . His face shone like the sun , and his clothes became as white as light .
CEB	Matthew	17	3	Moses and Elijah appeared to them , talking with Jesus .
CEB	Matthew	17	4	Peter reacted to all of this by saying to Jesus , “ Lord , it ’ s good that we ’ re here . If you want , I ’ ll make three shrines : one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah. ”
CEB	Matthew	17	5	While he was still speaking , look , a bright cloud overshadowed them . A voice from the cloud said , “ This is my Son whom I dearly love . I am very pleased with him . Listen to him ! ”
CEB	Matthew	17	6	Hearing this , the disciples fell on their faces , filled with awe .
CEB	Matthew	17	7	But Jesus came and touched them . “ Get up , ” he said . “ Don ’ t be afraid. ”
CEB	Matthew	17	8	When they looked up , they saw no one except Jesus .
CEB	Matthew	17	9	As they were coming down the mountain , Jesus commanded them , “ Don ’ t tell anybody about the vision until the Human One [ a ] is raised from the dead. ”
CEB	Matthew	17	10	The disciples asked , “ Then why do the legal experts say that Elijah must first come ? ”
CEB	Matthew	17	11	Jesus responded , “ Elijah does come first and will restore all things .
CEB	Matthew	17	12	In fact , I tell you that Elijah has already come , and they didn ’ t know him . But they did to him whatever they wanted . In the same way the Human One [ b ] is also going to suffer at their hands. ”
CEB	Matthew	17	13	Then the disciples realized he was telling them about John the Baptist . Healing of a boy who was demon-possessed
CEB	Matthew	17	14	When they came to the crowd , a man met Jesus . He knelt before him ,
CEB	Matthew	17	15	saying , “ Lord , show mercy to my son . He is epileptic and suffers terribly , for he often falls into the fire or the water .
CEB	Matthew	17	16	I brought him to your disciples , but they couldn ’ t heal him. ”
CEB	Matthew	17	18	Then Jesus spoke harshly to the demon . And it came out of the child , who was healed from that time on .
CEB	Matthew	17	19	Then the disciples came to Jesus in private and said , “ Why couldn ’ t we throw the demon out ? ”
CEB	Matthew	17	20	“ Because you have little faith , ” he said . “ I assure you that if you have faith the size of a mustard seed , you could say to this mountain , ‘ Go from here to there , ’ and it will go . There will be nothing that you can ’ t do. ” [ c ] Second prediction of Jesus ’ death and resurrection
CEB	Matthew	17	22	When the disciples came together in Galilee , Jesus said to them , “ The Human One [ d ] is about to be delivered over into human hands .
CEB	Matthew	17	23	They will kill him . But he will be raised on the third day. ” And they were heartbroken . Paying the temple tax
CEB	Matthew	17	24	When they came to Capernaum , the people who collected the half-shekel temple tax came to Peter and said , “ Doesn ’ t your teacher pay the temple tax ? ”
CEB	Matthew	17	25	“ Yes , ” he said . But when they came into the house , Jesus spoke to Peter first. “ What do you think , Simon ? From whom do earthly kings collect taxes , from their children or from strangers ? ”
CEB	Matthew	17	26	“ From strangers , ” he said . Jesus said to him , “ Then the children don ’ t have to pay .
CEB	Matthew	17	27	But just so we don ’ t offend them , go to the lake , throw out a fishing line and hook , and take the first fish you catch . When you open its mouth , you will find a shekel coin . Take it and pay the tax for both of us. ” Footnotes - Matthew 17:9 Or Son of Man - Matthew 17:12 Or Son of Man - Matthew 17:20 17:21 is omitted in most critical editions of the Gk New Testament This kind doesn ’ t come out except through prayer and fasting . - Matthew 17:22 Or Son of Man
CEB	Matthew	18	18	I assure you that whatever you fasten on earth will be fastened in heaven . And whatever you loosen on earth will be loosened in heaven .
CEB	Matthew	18	2	Then he called a little child over to sit among the disciples ,
CEB	Matthew	18	3	and said , “ I assure you that if you don ’ t turn your lives around and become like this little child , you will definitely not enter the kingdom of heaven .
CEB	Matthew	18	4	Those who humble themselves like this little child will be the greatest in the kingdom of heaven .
CEB	Matthew	18	5	Whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me . Falling into sin
CEB	Matthew	18	6	“ As for whoever causes these little ones who believe in me to trip and fall into sin , it would be better for them to have a huge stone hung around their necks and be drowned in the bottom of the lake .
CEB	Matthew	18	7	How terrible it is for the world because of the things that cause people to trip and fall into sin ! Such things have to happen , but how terrible it is for the person who causes those things to happen !
CEB	Matthew	18	8	If your hand or your foot causes you to fall into sin , chop it off and throw it away . It ’ s better to enter into life crippled or lame than to be thrown into the eternal fire with two hands or two feet .
CEB	Matthew	18	9	If your eye causes you to fall into sin , tear it out and throw it away . It ’ s better to enter into life with one eye than to be cast into a burning hell with two eyes . Parable of the lost sheep
CEB	Matthew	18	10	“ Be careful that you don ’ t look down on one of these little ones . I say to you that their angels in heaven are always looking into the face of my Father who is in heaven . [ a ]
CEB	Matthew	18	12	What do you think ? If someone had one hundred sheep and one of them wandered off , wouldn ’ t he leave the ninety-nine on the hillsides and go in search for the one that wandered off ?
CEB	Matthew	18	13	If he finds it , I assure you that he is happier about having that one sheep than about the ninety-nine who didn ’ t wander off .
CEB	Matthew	18	14	In the same way , my Father who is in heaven doesn ’ t want to lose one of these little ones . Sinning brother or sister
CEB	Matthew	18	15	“ If your brother or sister sins against you , go and correct them when you are alone together . If they listen to you , then you ’ ve won over your brother or sister .
CEB	Matthew	18	16	But if they won ’ t listen , take with you one or two others so that every word may be established by the mouth of two or three witnesses . [ b ]
CEB	Matthew	18	17	But if they still won ’ t pay attention , report it to the church . If they won ’ t pay attention even to the church , treat them as you would a Gentile and tax collector .
CEB	Matthew	18	19	Again I assure you that if two of you agree on earth about anything you ask , then my Father who is in heaven will do it for you .
CEB	Matthew	18	20	For where two or three are gathered in my name , I ’ m there with them. ” Parable of the unforgiving servant
CEB	Matthew	18	21	Then Peter said to Jesus , “ Lord , how many times should I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me ? Should I forgive as many as seven times ? ”
CEB	Matthew	18	22	Jesus said , “ Not just seven times , but rather as many as seventy-seven times . [ c ]
CEB	Matthew	18	23	Therefore , the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants .
CEB	Matthew	18	24	When he began to settle accounts , they brought to him a servant who owed him ten thousand bags of gold . [ d ]
CEB	Matthew	18	25	Because the servant didn ’ t have enough to pay it back , the master ordered that he should be sold , along with his wife and children and everything he had , and that the proceeds should be used as payment .
CEB	Matthew	18	26	But the servant fell down , kneeled before him , and said , ‘ Please , be patient with me , and I ’ ll pay you back. ’
CEB	Matthew	18	27	The master had compassion on that servant , released him , and forgave the loan .
CEB	Matthew	18	28	“ When that servant went out , he found one of his fellow servants who owed him one hundred coins . [ e ] He grabbed him around the throat and said , ‘ Pay me back what you owe me. ’
CEB	Matthew	18	29	“ Then his fellow servant fell down and begged him , ‘ Be patient with me , and I ’ ll pay you back. ’
CEB	Matthew	18	30	But he refused . Instead , he threw him into prison until he paid back his debt .
CEB	Matthew	18	31	“ When his fellow servants saw what happened , they were deeply offended . They came and told their master all that happened .
CEB	Matthew	18	32	His master called the first servant and said , ‘ You wicked servant ! I forgave you all that debt because you appealed to me .
CEB	Matthew	18	33	Shouldn ’ t you also have mercy on your fellow servant , just as I had mercy on you ? ’
CEB	Matthew	18	34	His master was furious and handed him over to the guard responsible for punishing prisoners , until he had paid the whole debt .
CEB	Matthew	18	35	“ My heavenly Father will also do the same to you if you don ’ t forgive your brother or sister from your heart. ” Footnotes - Matthew 18:10 18:11 is omitted in most critical editions of the Gk New Testament For the Human One has come to save the lost . - Matthew 18:16 Deut 19:15 - Matthew 18:22 Or seventy times seven - Matthew 18:24 Or ten thousand talanta , an amount equal to the wages for sixty million days - Matthew 18:28 Or one hundred denaria , an amount equal to the wages for one hundred days

CEB	Matthew	19	2	Large crowds followed him , and he healed them .
CEB	Matthew	19	3	Some Pharisees came to him . In order to test him , they said , “ Does the Law allow a man to divorce his wife for just any reason ? ”
CEB	Matthew	19	4	Jesus answered , “ Haven ’ t you read that at the beginning the creator made them male and female ? [ a ]
CEB	Matthew	19	5	And God said , ‘ Because of this a man should leave his father and mother and be joined together with his wife , and the two will be one flesh. ’ [ b ]
CEB	Matthew	19	6	So they are no longer two but one flesh . Therefore , humans must not pull apart what God has put together. ”
CEB	Matthew	19	7	The Pharisees said to him , “ Then why did Moses command us to give a divorce certificate and divorce her ? ” [ c ]
CEB	Matthew	19	8	Jesus replied , “ Moses allowed you to divorce your wives because your hearts are unyielding . But it wasn ’ t that way from the beginning .
CEB	Matthew	19	9	I say to you that whoever divorces his wife , except for sexual unfaithfulness , and marries another woman commits adultery. ”
CEB	Matthew	19	10	His disciples said to him , “ If that ’ s the way things are between a man and his wife , then it ’ s better not to marry. ”
CEB	Matthew	19	11	He replied , “ Not everybody can accept this teaching , but only those who have received the ability to accept it .
CEB	Matthew	19	12	For there are eunuchs who have been eunuchs from birth . And there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by other people . And there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs because of the kingdom of heaven . Those who can accept it should accept it. ” Jesus blesses children
CEB	Matthew	19	13	Some people brought children to Jesus so that he would place his hands on them and pray . But the disciples scolded them .
CEB	Matthew	19	14	“ Allow the children to come to me , ” Jesus said . “ Don ’ t forbid them , because the kingdom of heaven belongs to people like these children. ”
CEB	Matthew	19	15	Then he blessed the children and went away from there . A rich man ’ s question
CEB	Matthew	19	16	A man approached him and said , “ Teacher , what good thing must I do to have eternal life ? ”
CEB	Matthew	19	17	Jesus said , “ Why do you ask me about what is good ? There ’ s only one who is good . If you want to enter eternal life , keep the commandments. ”
CEB	Matthew	19	18	The man said , “ Which ones ? ” Then Jesus said , “ Don ’ t commit murder . Don ’ t commit adultery . Don ’ t steal . Don ’ t give false testimony .
CEB	Matthew	19	20	The young man replied , “ I ’ ve kept all these . What am I still missing ? ”
CEB	Matthew	19	21	Jesus said , “ If you want to be complete , go , sell what you own , and give the money to the poor . Then you will have treasure in heaven . And come follow me. ”
CEB	Matthew	19	22	But when the young man heard this , he went away saddened , because he had many possessions . Teaching about giving up things
CEB	Matthew	19	23	Then Jesus said to his disciples , “ I assure you that it will be very hard for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven .
CEB	Matthew	19	24	In fact , it ’ s easier for a camel to squeeze through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter God ’ s kingdom. ”
CEB	Matthew	19	25	When his disciples heard this , they were stunned . “ Then who can be saved ? ” they asked .
CEB	Matthew	19	26	Jesus looked at them carefully and said , “ It ’ s impossible for human beings . But all things are possible for God. ”
CEB	Matthew	19	27	Then Peter replied , “ Look , we ’ ve left everything and followed you . What will we have ? ”
CEB	Matthew	19	28	Jesus said to them , “ I assure you who have followed me that , when everything is made new , when the Human One [ f ] sits on his magnificent throne , you also will sit on twelve thrones overseeing the twelve tribes of Israel .
CEB	Matthew	19	29	And all who have left houses , brothers , sisters , father , mother , children , or farms because of my name will receive one hundred times more and will inherit eternal life .
CEB	Matthew	19	30	But many who are first will be last . And many who are last will be first .
CEB	Matthew	20	20	Then the mother of Zebedee ’ s sons came to Jesus along with her sons . Bowing before him , she asked a favor of him .
CEB	Matthew	20	2	After he agreed with the workers to pay them a denarion , [ a ] he sent them into his vineyard .
CEB	Matthew	20	3	“ Then he went out around nine in the morning and saw others standing around the marketplace doing nothing .
CEB	Matthew	20	4	He said to them , ‘ You also go into the vineyard , and I ’ ll pay you whatever is right. ’
CEB	Matthew	20	5	And they went . “ Again around noon and then at three in the afternoon , he did the same thing .
CEB	Matthew	20	6	Around five in the afternoon he went and found others standing around , and he said to them , ‘ Why are you just standing around here doing nothing all day long ? ’
CEB	Matthew	20	7	“ ‘ Because nobody has hired us , ’ they replied . “ He responded , ‘ You also go into the vineyard. ’
CEB	Matthew	20	8	“ When evening came , the owner of the vineyard said to his manager , ‘ Call the workers and give them their wages , beginning with the last ones hired and moving on finally to the first. ’
CEB	Matthew	20	9	When those who were hired at five in the afternoon came , each one received a denarion .
CEB	Matthew	20	10	Now when those hired first came , they thought they would receive more . But each of them also received a denarion .
CEB	Matthew	20	11	When they received it , they grumbled against the landowner ,
CEB	Matthew	20	12	‘ These who were hired last worked one hour , and they received the same pay as we did even though we had to work the whole day in the hot sun. ’
CEB	Matthew	20	13	“ But he replied to one of them , ‘ Friend , I did you no wrong . Didn ’ t I agree to pay you a denarion ?
CEB	Matthew	20	14	Take what belongs to you and go . I want to give to this one who was hired last the same as I give to you .
CEB	Matthew	20	15	Don ’ t I have the right to do what I want with what belongs to me ? Or are you resentful because I ’ m generous ? ’
CEB	Matthew	20	16	So those who are last will be first . And those who are first will be last. ” Jesus predicts his death and resurrection
CEB	Matthew	20	17	As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem , he took the Twelve aside by themselves on the road . He told them ,
CEB	Matthew	20	18	“ Look , we are going up to Jerusalem . The Human One [ b ] will be handed over to the chief priests and legal experts . They will condemn him to death .
CEB	Matthew	20	19	They will hand him over to the Gentiles to be ridiculed , tortured , and crucified . But he will be raised on the third day. ” Request from James and John ’ s mother
CEB	Matthew	20	21	“ What do you want ? ” he asked . She responded , “ Say that these two sons of mine will sit , one on your right hand and one on your left , in your kingdom. ”
CEB	Matthew	20	22	Jesus replied , “ You don ’ t know what you ’ re asking ! Can you drink from the cup that I ’ m about to drink from ? ” They said to him , “ We can. ”
CEB	Matthew	20	23	He said to them , “ You will drink from my cup , but to sit at my right or left hand isn ’ t mine to give . It belongs to those for whom my Father prepared it. ”
CEB	Matthew	20	24	Now when the other ten disciples heard about this , they became angry with the two brothers .
CEB	Matthew	20	25	But Jesus called them over and said , “ You know that those who rule the Gentiles show off their authority over them and their high-ranking officials order them around .
CEB	Matthew	20	26	But that ’ s not the way it will be with you . Whoever wants to be great among you will be your servant .
CEB	Matthew	20	27	Whoever wants to be first among you will be your slave—
CEB	Matthew	20	28	just as the Human One [ c ] didn ’ t come to be served but rather to serve and to give his life to liberate many people. ” Healing of two blind men
CEB	Matthew	20	29	As Jesus and his disciples were going out of Jericho a large crowd followed him .
CEB	Matthew	20	30	When two blind men sitting along the road heard that Jesus was passing by , they shouted , “ Show us mercy , Lord , Son of David ! ”
CEB	Matthew	20	31	Now the crowd scolded them and told them to be quiet . But they shouted even louder , “ Show us mercy , Lord , Son of David ! ”
CEB	Matthew	20	32	Jesus stopped in his tracks and called to them . “ What do you want me to do for you ? ” he asked .
CEB	Matthew	20	33	“ Lord , we want to see , ” they replied .
CEB	Matthew	20	34	Jesus had compassion on them and touched their eyes . Immediately they were able to see , and they followed him . Footnotes - Matthew 20:2 A denarion was a typical day ’ s wage . - Matthew 20:18 Or Son of Man - Matthew 20:28 Or Son of Man
CEB	Matthew	21	21	Jesus responded , “ I assure you that if you have faith and don ’ t doubt , you will not only do what was done to the fig tree . You will even say to this mountain , ‘ Be lifted up and thrown into the lake. ’ And it will happen .
CEB	Matthew	21	2	He said to them , “ Go into the village over there . As soon as you enter , you will find a donkey tied up and a colt with it . Untie them and bring them to me .
CEB	Matthew	21	3	If anyone says anything to you , say that their master needs them. ” He sent them off right away .
CEB	Matthew	21	4	Now this happened to fulfill what the prophet said ,
CEB	Matthew	21	5	Say to Daughter Zion , “ Look , your king is coming to you , humble and riding on a donkey , and on a colt the donkey ’ s offspring. ” [ a ]
CEB	Matthew	21	6	The disciples went and did just as Jesus had ordered them .
CEB	Matthew	21	7	They brought the donkey and the colt and laid their clothes on them . Then he sat on them .
CEB	Matthew	21	8	Now a large crowd spread their clothes on the road . Others cut palm branches off the trees and spread them on the road .
CEB	Matthew	21	9	The crowds in front of him and behind him shouted , “ Hosanna to the Son of David ! Blessings on the one who comes in the name of the Lord ! [ b ] Hosanna in the highest ! ”
CEB	Matthew	21	10	And when Jesus entered Jerusalem , the whole city was stirred up . “ Who is this ? ” they asked .
CEB	Matthew	21	11	The crowds answered , “ It ’ s the prophet Jesus from Nazareth in Galilee. ” Cleansing the temple
CEB	Matthew	21	12	Then Jesus went into the temple and threw out all those who were selling and buying there . He pushed over the tables used for currency exchange and the chairs of those who sold doves .
CEB	Matthew	21	13	He said to them , “ It ’ s written , My house will be called a house of prayer . [ c ] But you ’ ve made it a hideout for crooks. ”
CEB	Matthew	21	14	People who were blind and lame came to Jesus in the temple , and he healed them .
CEB	Matthew	21	15	But when the chief priests and legal experts saw the amazing things he was doing and the children shouting in the temple , “ Hosanna to the Son of David ! ” they were angry .
CEB	Matthew	21	16	They said to Jesus , “ Do you hear what these children are saying ? ” “ Yes , ” he answered . “ Haven ’ t you ever read , From the mouths of babies and infants you ’ ve arranged praise for yourself ? [ d ] ”
CEB	Matthew	21	17	Then he left them and went out of the city to Bethany and spent the night there . Cursing the fig tree
CEB	Matthew	21	18	Early in the morning as Jesus was returning to the city , he was hungry .
CEB	Matthew	21	19	He saw a fig tree along the road , but when he came to it , he found nothing except leaves . Then he said to it , “ You ’ ll never again bear fruit ! ” The fig tree dried up at once .
CEB	Matthew	21	20	When the disciples saw it , they were amazed . “ How did the fig tree dry up so fast ? ” they asked .
CEB	Matthew	21	22	If you have faith , you will receive whatever you pray for. ” Jesus ’ authority questioned
CEB	Matthew	21	23	When Jesus entered the temple , the chief priests and elders of the people came to him as he was teaching . They asked , “ What kind of authority do you have for doing these things ? Who gave you this authority ? ”
CEB	Matthew	21	24	Jesus replied , “ I have a question for you . If you tell me the answer , I ’ ll tell you what kind of authority I have to do these things .
CEB	Matthew	21	25	Where did John get his authority to baptize ? Did he get it from heaven or from humans ? ” They argued among themselves , “ If we say ‘ from heaven , ’ he ’ ll say to us , ‘ Then why didn ’ t you believe him ? ’
CEB	Matthew	21	26	But we can ’ t say ‘ from humans ’ because we ’ re afraid of the crowd , since everyone thinks John was a prophet. ”
CEB	Matthew	21	27	Then they replied , “ We don ’ t know. ” Jesus also said to them , “ Neither will I tell you what kind of authority I have to do these things . Parable of two sons
CEB	Matthew	21	28	“ What do you think ? A man had two sons . Now he came to the first and said , ‘ Son , go and work in the vineyard today. ’
CEB	Matthew	21	29	“ ‘ No , I don ’ t want to , ’ he replied . But later he changed his mind and went .
CEB	Matthew	21	30	“ The father said the same thing to the other son , who replied , ‘ Yes , sir. ’ But he didn ’ t go .
CEB	Matthew	21	31	“ Which one of these two did his father ’ s will ? ” They said , “ The first one. ” Jesus said to them , “ I assure you that tax collectors and prostitutes are entering God ’ s kingdom ahead of you .
CEB	Matthew	21	32	For John came to you on the righteous road , and you didn ’ t believe him . But tax collectors and prostitutes believed him . Yet even after you saw this , you didn ’ t change your hearts and lives and you didn ’ t believe him . Parable of the tenant farmers
CEB	Matthew	21	33	“ Listen to another parable . There was a landowner who planted a vineyard . He put a fence around it , dug a winepress in it , and built a tower . Then he rented it to tenant farmers and took a trip .
CEB	Matthew	21	34	When it was time for harvest , he sent his servants to the tenant farmers to collect his fruit .
CEB	Matthew	21	35	But the tenant farmers grabbed his servants . They beat some of them , and some of them they killed . Some of them they stoned to death .
CEB	Matthew	21	36	“ Again he sent other servants , more than the first group . They treated them in the same way .
CEB	Matthew	21	37	Finally he sent his son to them . ‘ They will respect my son , ’ he said .
CEB	Matthew	21	38	“ But when the tenant farmers saw the son , they said to each other , ‘ This is the heir . Come on , let ’ s kill him and we ’ ll have his inheritance. ’
CEB	Matthew	21	39	They grabbed him , threw him out of the vineyard , and killed him .
CEB	Matthew	21	40	“ When the owner of the vineyard comes , what will he do to those tenant farmers ? ”
CEB	Matthew	21	41	They said , “ He will totally destroy those wicked farmers and rent the vineyard to other tenant farmers who will give him the fruit when it ’ s ready. ”
CEB	Matthew	21	42	Jesus said to them , “ Haven ’ t you ever read in the scriptures , The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone . The Lord has done this , and it ’ s amazing in our eyes ? [ e ]
CEB	Matthew	21	43	Therefore , I tell you that God ’ s kingdom will be taken away from you and will be given to a people who produce its fruit .
CEB	Matthew	21	44	Whoever falls on this stone will be crushed . And the stone will crush the person it falls on. ”
CEB	Matthew	21	45	Now when the chief priests and the Pharisees heard the parable , they knew Jesus was talking about them .
CEB	Matthew	21	46	They were trying to arrest him , but they feared the crowds , who thought he was a prophet .
CEB	Matthew	22	22	When they heard this they were astonished , and they departed . Question about resurrection
CEB	Matthew	22	2	“ The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding party for his son .
CEB	Matthew	22	3	He sent his servants to call those invited to the wedding party . But they didn ’ t want to come .
CEB	Matthew	22	4	Again he sent other servants and said to them , ‘ Tell those who have been invited , “ Look , the meal is all prepared . I ’ ve butchered the oxen and the fattened cattle . Now everything ’ s ready . Come to the wedding party ! ” ’
CEB	Matthew	22	5	But they paid no attention and went away—some to their fields , others to their businesses .
CEB	Matthew	22	6	The rest of them grabbed his servants , abused them , and killed them .
CEB	Matthew	22	7	“ The king was angry . He sent his soldiers to destroy those murderers and set their city on fire .
CEB	Matthew	22	8	Then he said to his servants , ‘ The wedding party is prepared , but those who were invited weren ’ t worthy .
CEB	Matthew	22	9	Therefore , go to the roads on the edge of town and invite everyone you find to the wedding party. ’
CEB	Matthew	22	10	“ Then those servants went to the roads and gathered everyone they found , both evil and good . The wedding party was full of guests .
CEB	Matthew	22	11	Now when the king came in and saw the guests , he spotted a man who wasn ’ t wearing wedding clothes .
CEB	Matthew	22	12	He said to him , ‘ Friend , how did you get in here without wedding clothes ? ’ But he was speechless .
CEB	Matthew	22	13	Then the king said to his servants , ‘ Tie his hands and feet and throw him out into the farthest darkness . People there will be weeping and grinding their teeth. ’
CEB	Matthew	22	14	“ Many people are invited , but few people are chosen. ” Question about taxes
CEB	Matthew	22	15	Then the Pharisees met together to find a way to trap Jesus in his words .
CEB	Matthew	22	16	They sent their disciples , along with the supporters of Herod , to him . “ Teacher , ” they said , “ we know that you are genuine and that you teach God ’ s way as it really is . We know that you are not swayed by people ’ s opinions , because you don ’ t show favoritism .
CEB	Matthew	22	17	So tell us what you think : Does the Law allow people to pay taxes to Caesar or not ? ”
CEB	Matthew	22	18	Knowing their evil motives , Jesus replied , “ Why do you test me , you hypocrites ?
CEB	Matthew	22	19	Show me the coin used to pay the tax. ” And they brought him a denarion .
CEB	Matthew	22	20	“ Whose image and inscription is this ? ” he asked .
CEB	Matthew	22	21	“ Caesar ’ s , ” they replied . Then he said , “ Give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar and to God what belongs to God. ”
CEB	Matthew	22	23	That same day Sadducees , who deny that there is a resurrection , came to Jesus .
CEB	Matthew	22	24	They asked , “ Teacher , Moses said , If a man who doesn ’ t have children dies , his brother must marry his wife and produce children for his brother . [ a ]
CEB	Matthew	22	25	Now there were seven brothers among us . The first one married , then died . Because he had no children he left his widow to his brother .
CEB	Matthew	22	26	The same thing happened with the second brother and the third , and in fact with all seven brothers .
CEB	Matthew	22	27	Finally , the woman died .
CEB	Matthew	22	28	At the resurrection , which of the seven brothers will be her husband ? They were all married to her. ”
CEB	Matthew	22	29	Jesus responded , “ You are wrong because you don ’ t know either the scriptures or God ’ s power .
CEB	Matthew	22	30	At the resurrection people won ’ t marry nor will they be given in marriage . Instead , they will be like angels from God .
CEB	Matthew	22	31	As for the resurrection of the dead , haven ’ t you read what God told you ,
CEB	Matthew	22	32	I ’ m the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ? [ b ] He isn ’ t the God of the dead but of the living. ”
CEB	Matthew	22	33	Now when the crowd heard this , they were astonished at his teaching . Great commandment
CEB	Matthew	22	34	When the Pharisees heard that Jesus had left the Sadducees speechless , they met together .
CEB	Matthew	22	35	One of them , a legal expert , tested him .
CEB	Matthew	22	36	“ Teacher , what is the greatest commandment in the Law ? ”
CEB	Matthew	22	37	He replied , “ You must love the Lord your God with all your heart , with all your being , [ c ] and with all your mind .
CEB	Matthew	22	38	This is the first and greatest commandment .
CEB	Matthew	22	39	And the second is like it : You must love your neighbor as you love yourself . [ d ]
CEB	Matthew	22	40	All the Law and the Prophets depend on these two commands. ” Question about David ’ s son
CEB	Matthew	22	41	Now as the Pharisees were gathering , Jesus asked them ,
CEB	Matthew	22	42	“ What do you think about the Christ ? Whose son is he ? ” “ David ’ s son , ” they replied .
CEB	Matthew	22	43	He said , “ Then how is it that David , inspired by the Holy Spirit , called him Lord when he said ,
CEB	Matthew	22	44	The Lord said to my lord , ‘ Sit at my right side until I turn your enemies into your footstool ’ ? [ e ]
CEB	Matthew	22	45	If David calls him Lord , how can he be David ’ s son ? ”
CEB	Matthew	22	46	Nobody was able to answer him . And from that day forward nobody dared to ask him anything .
CEB	Matthew	23	23	“ How terrible it will be for you legal experts and Pharisees ! Hypocrites ! You give to God a tenth of mint , dill , and cumin , but you forget about the more important matters of the Law : justice , peace , and faith . You ought to give a tenth but without forgetting about those more important matters .
CEB	Matthew	23	2	“ The legal experts and the Pharisees sit on Moses ’ seat .
CEB	Matthew	23	3	Therefore , you must take care to do everything they say . But don ’ t do what they do .
CEB	Matthew	23	4	For they tie together heavy packs that are impossible to carry . They put them on the shoulders of others , but are unwilling to lift a finger to move them .
CEB	Matthew	23	5	Everything they do , they do to be noticed by others . They make extra-wide prayer bands for their arms and long tassels for their clothes .
CEB	Matthew	23	6	They love to sit in places of honor at banquets and in the synagogues .
CEB	Matthew	23	7	They love to be greeted with honor in the markets and to be addressed as ‘ Rabbi. ’
CEB	Matthew	23	8	“ But you shouldn ’ t be called Rabbi , because you have one teacher , and all of you are brothers and sisters .
CEB	Matthew	23	9	Don ’ t call anybody on earth your father , because you have one Father , who is heavenly .
CEB	Matthew	23	10	Don ’ t be called teacher , because Christ is your one teacher .
CEB	Matthew	23	11	But the one who is greatest among you will be your servant .
CEB	Matthew	23	12	All who lift themselves up will be brought low . But all who make themselves low will be lifted up . Condemnation of the legal experts and the Pharisees
CEB	Matthew	23	13	“ How terrible it will be for you legal experts and Pharisees ! Hypocrites ! You shut people out of the kingdom of heaven . You don ’ t enter yourselves , and you won ’ t allow those who want to enter to do so . [ a ]
CEB	Matthew	23	15	“ How terrible it will be for you , legal experts and Pharisees ! Hypocrites ! You travel over sea and land to make one convert . But when they ’ ve been converted , they become twice the child of hell you are .
CEB	Matthew	23	16	“ How terrible it will be for you blind guides who say , ‘ If people swear by the temple , it ’ s nothing . But if people swear by the gold in the temple , they are obligated to do what they swore. ’
CEB	Matthew	23	17	You foolish and blind people ! Which is greater , the gold or the temple that makes the gold holy ?
CEB	Matthew	23	18	You say , ‘ If people swear by the altar , it ’ s nothing . But if they swear by the gift on the altar , they are obligated to do what they swore. ’
CEB	Matthew	23	19	You blind people ! Which is greater , the gift or the altar that makes the gift holy ?
CEB	Matthew	23	20	Therefore , those who swear by the altar swear by it and by everything that ’ s on it .
CEB	Matthew	23	21	Those who swear by the temple swear by it and by everything that ’ s part of it .
CEB	Matthew	23	22	Those who swear by heaven swear by God ’ s throne and by the one who sits on it .
CEB	Matthew	23	24	You blind guides ! You filter out an ant but swallow a camel .
CEB	Matthew	23	25	“ How terrible it will be for you legal experts and Pharisees ! Hypocrites ! You clean the outside of the cup and plate , but inside they are full of violence and pleasure seeking .
CEB	Matthew	23	26	Blind Pharisee ! First clean the inside of the cup so that the outside of the cup will be clean too .
CEB	Matthew	23	27	“ How terrible it will be for you legal experts and Pharisees ! Hypocrites ! You are like whitewashed tombs . They look beautiful on the outside . But inside they are full of dead bones and all kinds of filth .
CEB	Matthew	23	28	In the same way you look righteous to people . But inside you are full of pretense and rebellion .
CEB	Matthew	23	29	“ How terrible it will be for you legal experts and Pharisees ! Hypocrites ! You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous .
CEB	Matthew	23	30	You say , ‘ If we had lived in our ancestors ’ days , we wouldn ’ t have joined them in killing the prophets. ’
CEB	Matthew	23	31	You testify against yourselves that you are children of those who murdered the prophets .
CEB	Matthew	23	32	Go ahead , complete what your ancestors did .
CEB	Matthew	23	33	You snakes ! You children of snakes ! How will you be able to escape the judgment of hell ?
CEB	Matthew	23	34	Therefore , look , I ’ m sending you prophets , wise people , and legal experts . Some of them you will kill and crucify . And some you will beat in your synagogues and chase from city to city .
CEB	Matthew	23	35	Therefore , upon you will come all the righteous blood that has been poured out on the earth , from the blood of that righteous man Abel to the blood of Zechariah the son of Barachiah , whom you killed between the temple and the altar .
CEB	Matthew	23	36	I assure you that all these things will come upon this generation . Crying over Jerusalem
CEB	Matthew	23	37	“ Jerusalem , Jerusalem ! You who kill the prophets and stone those who were sent to you . How often I wanted to gather your people together , just as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings . But you didn ’ t want that .
CEB	Matthew	23	38	Look , your house is left to you deserted .
CEB	Matthew	23	39	I tell you , you won ’ t see me until you say , Blessings on the one who comes in the Lord ’ s name. ” [ b ] Footnotes - Matthew 23:13 Most critical editions of the Gk New Testament omit 23:14 How terrible it will be for you legal experts and Pharisees ! Hypocrites ! You eat up widows ’ houses and make a show of praying long prayers . Therefore , you will receive greater judgment . - Matthew 23:39 Ps 118:26
CEB	Matthew	24	24	False christs and false prophets will appear , and they will offer great signs and wonders in order to deceive , if possible , even those whom God has chosen .
CEB	Matthew	24	2	He responded , “ Do you see all these things ? I assure that no stone will be left on another . Everything will be demolished. ” Beginning of troubles
CEB	Matthew	24	3	Now while Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives , the disciples came to him privately and said , “ Tell us , when will these things happen ? What will be the sign of your coming and the end of the age ? ”
CEB	Matthew	24	4	Jesus replied , “ Watch out that no one deceives you .
CEB	Matthew	24	5	Many will come in my name , saying , ‘ I ’ m the Christ. ’ They will deceive many people .
CEB	Matthew	24	6	You will hear about wars and reports of wars . Don ’ t be alarmed . These things must happen , but this isn ’ t the end yet .
CEB	Matthew	24	7	Nations and kingdoms will fight against each other , and there will be famines and earthquakes in all sorts of places .
CEB	Matthew	24	8	But all these things are just the beginning of the sufferings associated with the end .
CEB	Matthew	24	9	They will arrest you , abuse you , and they will kill you . All nations will hate you on account of my name .
CEB	Matthew	24	10	At that time many will fall away . They will betray each other and hate each other .
CEB	Matthew	24	11	Many false prophets will appear and deceive many people .
CEB	Matthew	24	12	Because disobedience will expand , the love of many will grow cold .
CEB	Matthew	24	13	But the one who endures to the end will be delivered .
CEB	Matthew	24	14	This gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the world as a testimony to all the nations . Then the end will come . The great suffering
CEB	Matthew	24	15	“ When you see the disgusting and destructive thing that Daniel talked about standing in the holy place ( the reader should understand this ) ,
CEB	Matthew	24	16	then those in Judea must escape to the mountains .
CEB	Matthew	24	17	Those on the roof shouldn ’ t come down to grab things from their houses .
CEB	Matthew	24	18	Those in the field shouldn ’ t come back to grab their clothes .
CEB	Matthew	24	19	How terrible it will be at that time for women who are pregnant and for women who are nursing their children .
CEB	Matthew	24	20	Pray that it doesn ’ t happen in winter or on the Sabbath day .
CEB	Matthew	24	21	There will be great suffering such as the world has never before seen and will never again see .
CEB	Matthew	24	22	If that time weren ’ t shortened , nobody would be rescued . But for the sake of the ones whom God chose , that time will be cut short .
CEB	Matthew	24	23	“ Then if somebody says to you , ‘ Look , here ’ s the Christ , ’ or ‘ He ’ s over here , ’ don ’ t believe it .
CEB	Matthew	24	25	Look , I ’ ve told you ahead of time .
CEB	Matthew	24	26	So if they say to you , ‘ Look , he ’ s in the desert , ’ don ’ t go out . And if they say , ‘ Look , he ’ s in the rooms deep inside the house , ’ don ’ t believe it .
CEB	Matthew	24	27	Just as the lightning flashes from the east to the west , so it will be with the coming of the Human One . [ a ]
CEB	Matthew	24	28	The vultures gather wherever there ’ s a dead body . Coming of the Human One
CEB	Matthew	24	29	“ Now immediately after the suffering of that time the sun will become dark , and the moon won ’ t give its light . The stars will fall from the sky and the planets and other heavenly bodies will be shaken .
CEB	Matthew	24	30	Then the sign of the Human One [ b ] will appear in the sky . At that time all the tribes of the earth will be full of sadness , and they will see the Human One [ c ] coming in the heavenly clouds [ d ] with power and great splendor .
CEB	Matthew	24	31	He will send his angels with the sound of a great trumpet , and they will gather his chosen ones from the four corners of the earth , from one end of the sky to the other . A lesson from the fig tree
CEB	Matthew	24	32	“ Learn this parable from the fig tree . After its branch becomes tender and it sprouts new leaves , you know that summer is near .
CEB	Matthew	24	33	In the same way , when you see all these things , you know that the Human One [ e ] is near , at the door .
CEB	Matthew	24	34	I assure you that this generation won ’ t pass away until all these things happen .
CEB	Matthew	24	35	Heaven and earth will pass away , but my words will certainly not pass away . Day and hour
CEB	Matthew	24	36	“ But nobody knows when that day or hour will come , not the heavenly angels and not the Son . Only the Father knows .
CEB	Matthew	24	37	As it was in the time of Noah , so it will be at the coming of the Human One . [ f ]
CEB	Matthew	24	38	In those days before the flood , people were eating and drinking , marrying and giving in marriage , until the day Noah entered the ark .
CEB	Matthew	24	39	They didn ’ t know what was happening until the flood came and swept them all away . The coming of the Human One [ g ] will be like that .
CEB	Matthew	24	40	At that time there will be two men in the field . One will be taken and the other left .
CEB	Matthew	24	41	Two women will be grinding at the mill . One will be taken and the other left .
CEB	Matthew	24	42	Therefore , stay alert ! You don ’ t know what day the Lord is coming .
CEB	Matthew	24	43	But you understand that if the head of the house knew at what time the thief would come , he would keep alert and wouldn ’ t allow the thief to break into his house .
CEB	Matthew	24	44	Therefore , you also should be prepared , because the Human One [ h ] will come at a time you don ’ t know . Faithful and unfaithful servants
CEB	Matthew	24	45	“ Who then are the faithful and wise servants whom their master puts in charge of giving food at the right time to those who live in his house ?
CEB	Matthew	24	46	Happy are those servants whom the master finds fulfilling their responsibilities when he comes .
CEB	Matthew	24	47	I assure you that he will put them in charge of all his possessions .
CEB	Matthew	24	48	But suppose those bad servants should say to themselves , My master won ’ t come until later .
CEB	Matthew	24	49	And suppose they began to beat their fellow servants and to eat and drink with the drunks ?
CEB	Matthew	24	50	The master of those servants will come on a day when they are not expecting him , at a time they couldn ’ t predict .
CEB	Matthew	24	51	He will cut them in pieces and put them in a place with the hypocrites . People there will be weeping and grinding their teeth .

CEB	Matthew	25	25	So I was afraid . And I hid my valuable coin in the ground . Here , you have what ’ s yours. ’
CEB	Matthew	25	2	Now five of them were wise , and the other five were foolish .
CEB	Matthew	25	3	The foolish ones took their lamps but didn ’ t bring oil for them .
CEB	Matthew	25	4	But the wise ones took their lamps and also brought containers of oil .
CEB	Matthew	25	5	“ When the groom was late in coming , they all became drowsy and went to sleep .
CEB	Matthew	25	6	But at midnight there was a cry , ‘ Look , the groom ! Come out to meet him. ’
CEB	Matthew	25	7	“ Then all those bridesmaids got up and prepared their lamps .
CEB	Matthew	25	8	But the foolish bridesmaids said to the wise ones , ‘ Give us some of your oil , because our lamps have gone out. ’
CEB	Matthew	25	9	“ But the wise bridesmaids replied , ‘ No , because if we share with you , there won ’ t be enough for our lamps and yours . We have a better idea . You go to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves. ’
CEB	Matthew	25	10	But while they were gone to buy oil , the groom came . Those who were ready went with him into the wedding . Then the door was shut .
CEB	Matthew	25	11	“ Later the other bridesmaids came and said , ‘ Lord , lord , open the door for us. ’
CEB	Matthew	25	12	“ But he replied , ‘ I tell you the truth , I don ’ t know you. ’
CEB	Matthew	25	13	“ Therefore , keep alert , because you don ’ t know the day or the hour . Parable of the valuable coins
CEB	Matthew	25	14	“ The kingdom of heaven is like a man who was leaving on a trip . He called his servants and handed his possessions over to them .
CEB	Matthew	25	15	To one he gave five valuable coins , [ a ] and to another he gave two , and to another he gave one . He gave to each servant according to that servant ’ s ability . Then he left on his journey .
CEB	Matthew	25	16	“ After the man left , the servant who had five valuable coins took them and went to work doing business with them . He gained five more .
CEB	Matthew	25	17	In the same way , the one who had two valuable coins gained two more .
CEB	Matthew	25	18	But the servant who had received the one valuable coin dug a hole in the ground and buried his master ’ s money .
CEB	Matthew	25	19	“ Now after a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them .
CEB	Matthew	25	20	The one who had received five valuable coins came forward with five additional coins . He said , ‘ Master , you gave me five valuable coins . Look , I ’ ve gained five more. ’
CEB	Matthew	25	21	“ His master replied , ‘ Excellent ! You are a good and faithful servant ! You ’ ve been faithful over a little . I ’ ll put you in charge of much . Come , celebrate with me. ’
CEB	Matthew	25	22	“ The second servant also came forward and said , ‘ Master , you gave me two valuable coins . Look , I ’ ve gained two more. ’
CEB	Matthew	25	23	“ His master replied , ‘ Well done ! You are a good and faithful servant . You ’ ve been faithful over a little . I ’ ll put you in charge of much . Come , celebrate with me. ’
CEB	Matthew	25	24	“ Now the one who had received one valuable coin came and said , ‘ Master , I knew that you are a hard man . You harvest grain where you haven ’ t sown . You gather crops where you haven ’ t spread seed .
CEB	Matthew	25	26	“ His master replied , ‘ You evil and lazy servant ! You knew that I harvest grain where I haven ’ t sown and that I gather crops where I haven ’ t spread seed ?
CEB	Matthew	25	27	In that case , you should have turned my money over to the bankers so that when I returned , you could give me what belonged to me with interest .
CEB	Matthew	25	28	Therefore , take from him the valuable coin and give it to the one who has ten coins .
CEB	Matthew	25	29	Those who have much will receive more , and they will have more than they need . But as for those who don ’ t have much , even the little bit they have will be taken away from them .
CEB	Matthew	25	30	Now take the worthless servant and throw him out into the farthest darkness. ’ “ People there will be weeping and grinding their teeth . Judgment of the nations
CEB	Matthew	25	31	“ Now when the Human One [ b ] comes in his majesty and all his angels are with him , he will sit on his majestic throne .
CEB	Matthew	25	32	All the nations will be gathered in front of him . He will separate them from each other , just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats .
CEB	Matthew	25	33	He will put the sheep on his right side . But the goats he will put on his left .
CEB	Matthew	25	34	“ Then the king will say to those on his right , ‘ Come , you who will receive good things from my Father . Inherit the kingdom that was prepared for you before the world began .
CEB	Matthew	25	35	I was hungry and you gave me food to eat . I was thirsty and you gave me a drink . I was a stranger and you welcomed me .
CEB	Matthew	25	36	I was naked and you gave me clothes to wear . I was sick and you took care of me . I was in prison and you visited me. ’
CEB	Matthew	25	37	“ Then those who are righteous will reply to him , ‘ Lord , when did we see you hungry and feed you , or thirsty and give you a drink ?
CEB	Matthew	25	38	When did we see you as a stranger and welcome you , or naked and give you clothes to wear ?
CEB	Matthew	25	39	When did we see you sick or in prison and visit you ? ’
CEB	Matthew	25	40	“ Then the king will reply to them , ‘ I assure you that when you have done it for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine , you have done it for me. ’
CEB	Matthew	25	41	“ Then he will say to those on his left , ‘ Get away from me , you who will receive terrible things . Go into the unending fire that has been prepared for the devil and his angels .
CEB	Matthew	25	42	I was hungry and you didn ’ t give me food to eat . I was thirsty and you didn ’ t give me anything to drink .
CEB	Matthew	25	43	I was a stranger and you didn ’ t welcome me . I was naked and you didn ’ t give me clothes to wear . I was sick and in prison , and you didn ’ t visit me. ’
CEB	Matthew	25	44	“ Then they will reply , ‘ Lord , when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and didn ’ t do anything to help you ? ’
CEB	Matthew	25	45	Then he will answer , ‘ I assure you that when you haven ’ t done it for one of the least of these , you haven ’ t done it for me. ’
CEB	Matthew	25	46	And they will go away into eternal punishment . But the righteous ones will go into eternal life. ” Footnotes - Matthew 25:15 Or talantas ( talents ) - Matthew 25:31 Or Son of Man
CEB	Matthew	26	26	While they were eating , Jesus took bread , blessed it , broke it , and gave it to the disciples and said , “ Take and eat . This is my body. ”
CEB	Matthew	26	2	“ You know that the Passover is two days from now . And the Human One [ a ] will be handed over to be crucified. ”
CEB	Matthew	26	3	Then the chief priests and elders of the people gathered in the courtyard of Caiaphas the high priest .
CEB	Matthew	26	4	They were plotting to arrest Jesus by cunning tricks and to kill him .
CEB	Matthew	26	5	But they agreed that it shouldn ’ t happen during the feast so there wouldn ’ t be an uproar among the people . A woman pouring perfume on Jesus
CEB	Matthew	26	6	When Jesus was at Bethany visiting the house of Simon , who had a skin disease ,
CEB	Matthew	26	7	a woman came to him with a vase made of alabaster containing very expensive perfume . She poured it on Jesus ’ head while he was sitting at dinner .
CEB	Matthew	26	8	Now when the disciples saw it they were angry and said , “ Why this waste ?
CEB	Matthew	26	9	This perfume could have been sold for a lot of money and given to the poor. ”
CEB	Matthew	26	10	But Jesus knew what they were thinking . He said , “ Why do you make trouble for the woman ? She ’ s done a good thing for me .
CEB	Matthew	26	11	You always have the poor with you , but you won ’ t always have me .
CEB	Matthew	26	12	By pouring this perfume over my body she ’ s prepared me to be buried .
CEB	Matthew	26	13	I tell you the truth that wherever in the whole world this good news is announced , what she ’ s done will also be told in memory of her. ” Judas betrays Jesus
CEB	Matthew	26	14	Then one of the Twelve , who was called Judas Iscariot , went to the chief priests
CEB	Matthew	26	15	and said , “ What will you give me if I turn Jesus over to you ? ” They paid him thirty pieces of silver .
CEB	Matthew	26	16	From that time on he was looking for an opportunity to turn him in . Passover with the disciples
CEB	Matthew	26	17	On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread , the disciples came to Jesus and said , “ Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover meal ? ”
CEB	Matthew	26	18	He replied , “ Go into the city , to a certain man , and say , ‘ The teacher says , “ My time is near . I ’ m going to celebrate the Passover with my disciples at your house. ” ’ ”
CEB	Matthew	26	19	The disciples did just as Jesus instructed them . They prepared the Passover .
CEB	Matthew	26	20	That evening he took his place at the table with the twelve disciples .
CEB	Matthew	26	21	As they were eating he said , “ I assure you that one of you will betray me. ”
CEB	Matthew	26	22	Deeply saddened , each one said to him , “ I ’ m not the one , am I , Lord ? ”
CEB	Matthew	26	23	He replied , “ The one who will betray me is the one who dips his hand with me into this bowl .
CEB	Matthew	26	24	The Human One [ b ] goes to his death just as it is written about him . But how terrible it is for that person who betrays the Human One ! [ c ] It would have been better for him if he had never been born. ”
CEB	Matthew	26	25	Now Judas , who would betray him , replied , “ It ’ s not me , is it , Rabbi ? ” Jesus answered , “ You said it. ” Last supper
CEB	Matthew	26	27	He took a cup , gave thanks , and gave it to them , saying , “ Drink from this , all of you .
CEB	Matthew	26	28	This is my blood of the covenant , which is poured out for many so that their sins may be forgiven .
CEB	Matthew	26	29	I tell you , I won ’ t drink wine again until that day when I drink it in a new way with you in my Father ’ s kingdom. ”
CEB	Matthew	26	30	Then , after singing songs of praise , they went to the Mount of Olives . Predictions about disciples leaving Jesus
CEB	Matthew	26	31	Then Jesus said to his disciples , “ Tonight you will all fall away because of me . This is because it is written , I will hit the shepherd , and the sheep of the flock will go off in all directions . [ d ]
CEB	Matthew	26	32	But after I ’ m raised up , I ’ ll go before you to Galilee. ”
CEB	Matthew	26	33	Peter replied , “ If everyone else stumbles because of you , I ’ ll never stumble. ”
CEB	Matthew	26	34	Jesus said to him , “ I assure you that , before the rooster crows tonight , you will deny me three times. ”
CEB	Matthew	26	35	Peter said , “ Even if I must die alongside you , I won ’ t deny you. ” All the disciples said the same thing . Jesus in prayer
CEB	Matthew	26	36	Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane . He said to the disciples , “ Stay here while I go and pray over there. ”
CEB	Matthew	26	37	When he took Peter and Zebedee ’ s two sons , he began to feel sad and anxious .
CEB	Matthew	26	38	Then he said to them , “ I ’ m very sad . It ’ s as if I ’ m dying . Stay here and keep alert with me. ”
CEB	Matthew	26	39	Then he went a short distance farther and fell on his face and prayed , “ My Father , if it ’ s possible , take this cup of suffering away from me . However—not what I want but what you want. ”
CEB	Matthew	26	40	He came back to the disciples and found them sleeping . He said to Peter , “ Couldn ’ t you stay alert one hour with me ?
CEB	Matthew	26	41	Stay alert and pray so that you won ’ t give in to temptation . The spirit is eager , but the flesh is weak. ”
CEB	Matthew	26	42	A second time he went away and prayed , “ My Father , if it ’ s not possible that this cup be taken away unless I drink it , then let it be what you want. ”
CEB	Matthew	26	43	Again he came and found them sleeping . Their eyes were heavy with sleep .
CEB	Matthew	26	44	But he left them and again went and prayed the same words for the third time .
CEB	Matthew	26	45	Then he came to his disciples and said to them , “ Will you sleep and rest all night ? Look , the time has come for the Human One [ e ] to be betrayed into the hands of sinners .
CEB	Matthew	26	46	Get up . Let ’ s go . Look , here comes my betrayer. ” Arrest
CEB	Matthew	26	47	While Jesus was still speaking , Judas , one of the Twelve , came . With him was a large crowd carrying swords and clubs . They had been sent by the chief priests and elders of the people .
CEB	Matthew	26	48	His betrayer had given them a sign : “ Arrest the man I kiss. ”
CEB	Matthew	26	49	Just then he came to Jesus and said , “ Hello , Rabbi. ” Then he kissed him .
CEB	Matthew	26	50	But Jesus said to him , “ Friend , do what you came to do. ” Then they came and grabbed Jesus and arrested him .
CEB	Matthew	26	51	One of those with Jesus reached for his sword . Striking the high priest ’ s slave , he cut off his ear .
CEB	Matthew	26	52	Then Jesus said to him , “ Put the sword back into its place . All those who use the sword will die by the sword .
CEB	Matthew	26	53	Or do you think that I ’ m not able to ask my Father and he will send to me more than twelve battle groups [ f ] of angels right away ?
CEB	Matthew	26	54	But if I did that , how would the scriptures be fulfilled that say this must happen ? ”
CEB	Matthew	26	55	Then Jesus said to the crowds , “ Have you come with swords and clubs to arrest me , like a thief ? Day after day , I sat in the temple teaching , but you didn ’ t arrest me .
CEB	Matthew	26	56	But all this has happened so that what the prophets said in the scriptures might be fulfilled. ” Then all the disciples left Jesus and ran away . Jesus before the council
CEB	Matthew	26	57	Those who arrested Jesus led him to Caiaphas the high priest . The legal experts and the elders had gathered there .
CEB	Matthew	26	58	Peter followed him from a distance until he came to the high priest ’ s courtyard . He entered that area and sat outside with the officers to see how it would turn out .
CEB	Matthew	26	59	The chief priests and the whole council were looking for false testimony against Jesus so that they could put him to death .
CEB	Matthew	26	60	They didn ’ t find anything they could use from the many false witnesses who were willing to come forward . But finally they found two
CEB	Matthew	26	61	who said , “ This man said , ‘ I can destroy God ’ s temple and rebuild it in three days. ’ ”
CEB	Matthew	26	62	Then the high priest stood and said to Jesus , “ Aren ’ t you going to respond to the testimony these people have brought against you ? ”
CEB	Matthew	26	63	But Jesus was silent . The high priest said , “ By the living God , I demand that you tell us whether you are the Christ , God ’ s Son. ”
CEB	Matthew	26	64	“ You said it , ” Jesus replied . “ But I say to you that from now on you ’ ll see the Human One [ g ] sitting on the right side of the Almighty [ h ] and coming on the heavenly clouds. ” [ i ]
CEB	Matthew	26	65	Then the high priest tore his clothes and said , “ He ’ s insulting God ! Why do we need any more witnesses ? Look , you ’ ve heard his insult against God .
CEB	Matthew	26	66	What do you think ? ” And they answered , “ He deserves to die ! ”
CEB	Matthew	26	67	Then they spit in his face and beat him . They hit him
CEB	Matthew	26	68	and said , “ Prophesy for us , Christ ! Who hit you ? ” Peter ’ s denial
CEB	Matthew	26	69	Meanwhile , Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard . A servant woman came and said to him , “ You were also with Jesus the Galilean. ”
CEB	Matthew	26	70	But he denied it in front of all of them , saying , “ I don ’ t know what you are talking about. ”
CEB	Matthew	26	71	When he went over to the gate , another woman saw him and said to those who were there , “ This man was with Jesus , the man from Nazareth. ”
CEB	Matthew	26	72	With a solemn pledge , he denied it again , saying , “ I don ’ t know the man. ”
CEB	Matthew	26	73	A short time later those standing there came and said to Peter , “ You must be one of them . The way you talk gives you away. ”
CEB	Matthew	26	74	Then he cursed and swore , “ I don ’ t know the man ! ” At that very moment the rooster crowed .
CEB	Matthew	26	75	Peter remembered Jesus ’ words , “ Before the rooster crows you will deny me three times. ” And Peter went out and cried uncontrollably .

CEB	Matthew	27	27	The governor ’ s soldiers took Jesus into the governor ’ s house , and they gathered the whole company [ b ] of soldiers around him .
CEB	Matthew	27	2	They bound him , led him away , and turned him over to Pilate the governor . Judas ’ death
CEB	Matthew	27	3	When Judas , who betrayed Jesus , saw that Jesus was condemned to die , he felt deep regret . He returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders , and
CEB	Matthew	27	4	said , “ I did wrong because I betrayed an innocent man. ” But they said , “ What is that to us ? That ’ s your problem. ”
CEB	Matthew	27	5	Judas threw the silver pieces into the temple and left . Then he went and hanged himself .
CEB	Matthew	27	6	The chief priests picked up the silver pieces and said , “ According to the Law it ’ s not right to put this money in the treasury . Since it was used to pay for someone ’ s life , it ’ s unclean. ”
CEB	Matthew	27	7	So they decided to use it to buy the potter ’ s field where strangers could be buried .
CEB	Matthew	27	8	That ’ s why that field is called “ Field of Blood ” to this very day .
CEB	Matthew	27	9	This fulfilled the words of Jeremiah the prophet : And I took the thirty pieces of silver , the price for the one whose price had been set by some of the Israelites ,
CEB	Matthew	27	10	and I gave them for the potter ’ s field , as the Lord commanded me . [ a ] Questioned by Pilate
CEB	Matthew	27	11	Jesus was brought before the governor . The governor said , “ Are you the king of the Jews ? ” Jesus replied , “ That ’ s what you say. ”
CEB	Matthew	27	12	But he didn ’ t answer when the chief priests and elders accused him .
CEB	Matthew	27	13	Then Pilate said , “ Don ’ t you hear the testimony they bring against you ? ”
CEB	Matthew	27	14	But he didn ’ t answer , not even a single word . So the governor was greatly amazed . Death sentence
CEB	Matthew	27	15	It was customary during the festival for the governor to release to the crowd one prisoner , whomever they might choose .
CEB	Matthew	27	16	At that time there was a well-known prisoner named Jesus Barabbas .
CEB	Matthew	27	17	When the crowd had come together , Pilate asked them , “ Whom would you like me to release to you , Jesus Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ ? ”
CEB	Matthew	27	18	He knew that the leaders of the people had handed him over because of jealousy .
CEB	Matthew	27	19	While he was serving as judge , his wife sent this message to him , “ Leave that righteous man alone . I ’ ve suffered much today in a dream because of him. ”
CEB	Matthew	27	20	But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and kill Jesus .
CEB	Matthew	27	21	The governor said , “ Which of the two do you want me to release to you ? ” “ Barabbas , ” they replied .
CEB	Matthew	27	22	Pilate said , “ Then what should I do with Jesus who is called Christ ? ” They all said , “ Crucify him ! ”
CEB	Matthew	27	23	But he said , “ Why ? What wrong has he done ? ” They shouted even louder , “ Crucify him ! ”
CEB	Matthew	27	24	Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere and that a riot was starting . So he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd . “ I ’ m innocent of this man ’ s blood , ” he said . “ It ’ s your problem. ”
CEB	Matthew	27	25	All the people replied , “ Let his blood be on us and on our children. ”
CEB	Matthew	27	26	Then he released Barabbas to them . He had Jesus whipped , then handed him over to be crucified . Soldiers mocking Jesus
CEB	Matthew	27	28	They stripped him and put a red military coat on him .
CEB	Matthew	27	29	They twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head . They put a stick in his right hand . Then they bowed down in front of him and mocked him , saying , “ Hey ! King of the Jews ! ”
CEB	Matthew	27	30	After they spit on him , they took the stick and struck his head again and again .
CEB	Matthew	27	31	When they finished mocking him , they stripped him of the military coat and put his own clothes back on him . They led him away to crucify him . Crucifixion
CEB	Matthew	27	32	As they were going out , they found Simon , a man from Cyrene . They forced him to carry his cross .
CEB	Matthew	27	33	When they came to a place called Golgotha , which means Skull Place ,
CEB	Matthew	27	34	they gave Jesus wine mixed with vinegar to drink . But after tasting it , he didn ’ t want to drink it .
CEB	Matthew	27	35	After they crucified him , they divided up his clothes among them by drawing lots .
CEB	Matthew	27	36	They sat there , guarding him .
CEB	Matthew	27	37	They placed above his head the charge against him . It read , “ This is Jesus , the king of the Jews. ”
CEB	Matthew	27	38	They crucified with him two outlaws , one on his right side and one on his left .
CEB	Matthew	27	39	Those who were walking by insulted Jesus , shaking their heads
CEB	Matthew	27	40	and saying , “ So you were going to destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days , were you ? Save yourself ! If you are God ’ s Son , come down from the cross. ”
CEB	Matthew	27	41	In the same way , the chief priests , along with the legal experts and the elders , were making fun of him , saying ,
CEB	Matthew	27	42	“ He saved others , but he can ’ t save himself . He ’ s the king of Israel , so let him come down from the cross now . Then we ’ ll believe in him .
CEB	Matthew	27	43	He trusts in God , so let God deliver him now if he wants to . He said , ‘ I ’ m God ’ s Son. ’ ”
CEB	Matthew	27	44	The outlaws who were crucified with him insulted him in the same way . Death
CEB	Matthew	27	45	From noon until three in the afternoon the whole earth was dark .
CEB	Matthew	27	46	At about three Jesus cried out with a loud shout , “ Eli , Eli , lama sabachthani , ” which means , “ My God , my God , why have you left me ? ” [ c ]
CEB	Matthew	27	47	After hearing him , some standing there said , “ He ’ s calling Elijah. ”
CEB	Matthew	27	48	One of them ran over , took a sponge full of vinegar , and put it on a pole . He offered it to Jesus to drink .
CEB	Matthew	27	49	But the rest of them said , “ Let ’ s see if Elijah will come and save him. ”
CEB	Matthew	27	50	Again Jesus cried out with a loud shout . Then he died .
CEB	Matthew	27	51	Look , the curtain of the sanctuary was torn in two from top to bottom . The earth shook , the rocks split ,
CEB	Matthew	27	52	and the bodies of many holy people who had died were raised .
CEB	Matthew	27	53	After Jesus ’ resurrection they came out of their graves and went into the holy city where they appeared to many people .
CEB	Matthew	27	54	When the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and what had just happened , they were filled with awe and said , “ This was certainly God ’ s Son. ”
CEB	Matthew	27	55	Many women were watching from a distance . They had followed Jesus from Galilee to serve him .
CEB	Matthew	27	56	Among them were Mary Magdalene , Mary the mother of James and Joseph , and the mother of Zebedee ’ s sons . Burial
CEB	Matthew	27	57	That evening a man named Joseph came . He was a rich man from Arimathea who had become a disciple of Jesus .
CEB	Matthew	27	58	He came to Pilate and asked for Jesus ’ body . Pilate gave him permission to take it .
CEB	Matthew	27	59	Joseph took the body , wrapped it in a clean linen cloth ,
CEB	Matthew	27	60	and laid it in his own new tomb , which he had carved out of the rock . After he rolled a large stone at the door of the tomb , he went away .
CEB	Matthew	27	61	Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were there , sitting in front of the tomb . Guard at the tomb
CEB	Matthew	27	62	The next day , which was the day after Preparation Day , the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate .
CEB	Matthew	27	63	They said , “ Sir , we remember that while that deceiver was still alive he said , ‘ After three days I will arise. ’
CEB	Matthew	27	64	Therefore , order the grave to be sealed until the third day . Otherwise , his disciples may come and steal the body and tell the people , ‘ He ’ s been raised from the dead. ’ This last deception will be worse than the first. ”
CEB	Matthew	27	65	Pilate replied , “ You have soldiers for guard duty . Go and make it as secure as you know how. ”
CEB	Matthew	27	66	Then they went and secured the tomb by sealing the stone and posting the guard . Footnotes - Matthew 27:10 Zech 11:12-13 ; Jer 32:6-9 - Matthew 27:27 Or cohort ( approximately six hundred soldiers ) - Matthew 27:46 Ps 22:1
CEB	Matthew	28	28	After the Sabbath , at dawn on the first day of the week , Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to look at the tomb .
CEB	Matthew	28	2	Look , there was a great earthquake , for an angel from the Lord came down from heaven . Coming to the stone , he rolled it away and sat on it .
CEB	Matthew	28	3	Now his face was like lightning and his clothes as white as snow .
CEB	Matthew	28	4	The guards were so terrified of him that they shook with fear and became like dead men .
CEB	Matthew	28	5	But the angel said to the women , “ Don ’ t be afraid . I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified .
CEB	Matthew	28	6	He isn ’ t here , because he ’ s been raised from the dead , just as he said . Come , see the place where they laid him .
CEB	Matthew	28	7	Now hurry , go and tell his disciples , ‘ He ’ s been raised from the dead . He ’ s going on ahead of you to Galilee . You will see him there. ’ I ’ ve given the message to you. ”
CEB	Matthew	28	8	With great fear and excitement , they hurried away from the tomb and ran to tell his disciples .
CEB	Matthew	28	9	But Jesus met them and greeted them . They came and grabbed his feet and worshipped him .
CEB	Matthew	28	10	Then Jesus said to them , “ Don ’ t be afraid . Go and tell my brothers that I am going into Galilee . They will see me there. ” Guards ’ report
CEB	Matthew	28	11	Now as the women were on their way , some of the guards came into the city and told the chief priests everything that had happened .
CEB	Matthew	28	12	They met with the elders and decided to give a large sum of money to the soldiers .
CEB	Matthew	28	13	They told them , “ Say that Jesus ’ disciples came at night and stole his body while you were sleeping .
CEB	Matthew	28	14	And if the governor hears about this , we will take care of it with him so you will have nothing to worry about. ”
CEB	Matthew	28	15	So the soldiers took the money and did as they were told . And this report has spread throughout all Judea to this very day . Commissioning of the disciples
CEB	Matthew	28	16	Now the eleven disciples went to Galilee , to the mountain where Jesus told them to go .
CEB	Matthew	28	17	When they saw him , they worshipped him , but some doubted .
CEB	Matthew	28	18	Jesus came near and spoke to them , “ I ’ ve received all authority in heaven and on earth .
CEB	Matthew	28	19	Therefore , go and make disciples of all nations , baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit ,
CEB	Matthew	28	20	teaching them to obey everything that I ’ ve commanded you . Look , I myself will be with you every day until the end of this present age . ”
CEB	Mark	1	1	The beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ , God ’ s Son ,
CEB	Mark	1	2	happened just as it was written about in the prophecy of Isaiah : Look , I am sending my messenger before you . He will prepare your way ,
CEB	Mark	1	3	a voice shouting in the wilderness : “ Prepare the way for the Lord ; make his paths straight. ” [ a ] John ’ s preaching
CEB	Mark	1	4	John the Baptist was in the wilderness calling for people to be baptized to show that they were changing their hearts and lives and wanted God to forgive their sins .
CEB	Mark	1	5	Everyone in Judea and all the people of Jerusalem went out to the Jordan River and were being baptized by John as they confessed their sins .
CEB	Mark	1	6	John wore clothes made of camel ’ s hair , with a leather belt around his waist . He ate locusts and wild honey .
CEB	Mark	1	7	He announced , “ One stronger than I am is coming after me . I ’ m not even worthy to bend over and loosen the strap of his sandals .
CEB	Mark	1	8	I baptize you with water , but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit. ” Jesus is baptized and tempted
CEB	Mark	1	9	About that time , Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee , and John baptized him in the Jordan River .
CEB	Mark	1	10	While he was coming up out of the water , Jesus saw heaven splitting open and the Spirit , like a dove , coming down on him .
CEB	Mark	1	11	And there was a voice from heaven : “ You are my Son , whom I dearly love ; in you I find happiness. ”
CEB	Mark	1	12	At once the Spirit forced Jesus out into the wilderness .
CEB	Mark	1	13	He was in the wilderness for forty days , tempted by Satan . He was among the wild animals , and the angels took care of him . Jesus ’ message
CEB	Mark	1	14	After John was arrested , Jesus came into Galilee announcing God ’ s good news ,
CEB	Mark	1	15	saying , “ Now is the time ! Here comes God ’ s kingdom ! Change your hearts and lives , and trust this good news ! ” Jesus calls disciples
CEB	Mark	1	16	As Jesus passed alongside the Galilee Sea , he saw two brothers , Simon and Andrew , throwing fishing nets into the sea , for they were fishermen .
CEB	Mark	1	17	“ Come , follow me , ” he said , “ and I ’ ll show you how to fish for people. ”
CEB	Mark	1	18	Right away , they left their nets and followed him .
CEB	Mark	1	19	After going a little farther , he saw James and John , Zebedee ’ s sons , in their boat repairing the fishing nets .
CEB	Mark	1	20	At that very moment he called them . They followed him , leaving their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired workers . Jesus throws a demon out
CEB	Mark	1	21	Jesus and his followers went into Capernaum . Immediately on the Sabbath Jesus entered the synagogue and started teaching .
CEB	Mark	1	22	The people were amazed by his teaching , for he was teaching them with authority , not like the legal experts .
CEB	Mark	1	23	Suddenly , there in the synagogue , a person with an evil spirit screamed ,
CEB	Mark	1	24	“ What have you to do with us , Jesus of Nazareth ? Have you come to destroy us ? I know who you are . You are the holy one from God. ”
CEB	Mark	1	25	“ Silence ! ” Jesus said , speaking harshly to the demon . “ Come out of him ! ”
CEB	Mark	1	26	The unclean spirit shook him and screamed , then it came out .
CEB	Mark	1	27	Everyone was shaken and questioned among themselves , “ What ’ s this ? A new teaching with authority ! He even commands unclean spirits and they obey him ! ”
CEB	Mark	1	28	Right away the news about him spread throughout the entire region of Galilee . Jesus heals Simon ’ s mother-in-law
CEB	Mark	1	29	After leaving the synagogue , Jesus , James , and John went home with Simon and Andrew .
CEB	Mark	1	30	Simon ’ s mother-in-law was in bed , sick with a fever , and they told Jesus about her at once .
CEB	Mark	1	31	He went to her , took her by the hand , and raised her up . The fever left her , and she served them . Jesus ’ ministry spreads
CEB	Mark	1	32	That evening , at sunset , people brought to Jesus those who were sick or demon-possessed .
CEB	Mark	1	33	The whole town gathered near the door .
CEB	Mark	1	34	He healed many who were sick with all kinds of diseases , and he threw out many demons . But he didn ’ t let the demons speak , because they recognized him .
CEB	Mark	1	35	Early in the morning , well before sunrise , Jesus rose and went to a deserted place where he could be alone in prayer .
CEB	Mark	1	36	Simon and those with him tracked him down .
CEB	Mark	1	37	When they found him , they told him , “ Everyone ’ s looking for you ! ”
CEB	Mark	1	38	He replied , “ Let ’ s head in the other direction , to the nearby villages , so that I can preach there too . That ’ s why I ’ ve come. ”
CEB	Mark	1	39	He traveled throughout Galilee , preaching in their synagogues and throwing out demons . A man with a skin disease
CEB	Mark	1	40	A man with a skin disease approached Jesus , fell to his knees , and begged , “ If you want , you can make me clean. ”
CEB	Mark	1	41	Incensed , [ b ] Jesus reached out his hand , touched him , and said , “ I do want to . Be clean. ”
CEB	Mark	1	42	Instantly , the skin disease left him , and he was clean .
CEB	Mark	1	43	Sternly , Jesus sent him away ,
CEB	Mark	1	44	saying , “ Don ’ t say anything to anyone . Instead , go and show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifice for your cleansing that Moses commanded . This will be a testimony to them. ”
CEB	Mark	1	45	Instead , he went out and started talking freely and spreading the news so that Jesus wasn ’ t able to enter a town openly . He remained outside in deserted places , but people came to him from everywhere . Footnotes - Mark 1:3 Isa 40:3 ; Mal 3:1 ; Exod 23:20 - Mark 1:41 Most critical editions of the Gk New Testament read filled with compassion .
CEB	Mark	2	2	So many gathered that there was no longer space , not even near the door . Jesus was speaking the word to them .
CEB	Mark	2	3	Some people arrived , and four of them were bringing to him a man who was paralyzed .
CEB	Mark	2	4	They couldn ’ t carry him through the crowd , so they tore off part of the roof above where Jesus was . When they had made an opening , they lowered the mat on which the paralyzed man was lying .
CEB	Mark	2	5	When Jesus saw their faith , he said to the paralytic , “ Child , your sins are forgiven ! ”
CEB	Mark	2	6	Some legal experts were sitting there , muttering among themselves ,
CEB	Mark	2	7	“ Why does he speak this way ? He ’ s insulting God . Only the one God can forgive sins. ”
CEB	Mark	2	8	Jesus immediately recognized what they were discussing , and he said to them , “ Why do you fill your minds with these questions ?
CEB	Mark	2	9	Which is easier—to say to a paralyzed person , ‘ Your sins are forgiven , ’ or to say , ‘ Get up , take up your bed , and walk ’ ?
CEB	Mark	2	10	But so you will know that the Human One [ a ] has authority on the earth to forgive sins ” —he said to the man who was paralyzed ,
CEB	Mark	2	11	“ Get up , take your mat , and go home. ”
CEB	Mark	2	12	Jesus raised him up , and right away he picked up his mat and walked out in front of everybody . They were all amazed and praised God , saying , “ We ’ ve never seen anything like this ! ” Eating with sinners
CEB	Mark	2	13	Jesus went out beside the lake again . The whole crowd came to him , and he began to teach them .
CEB	Mark	2	14	As he continued along , he saw Levi , Alphaeus ’ son , sitting at a kiosk for collecting taxes . Jesus said to him , “ Follow me. ” Levi got up and followed him .
CEB	Mark	2	15	Jesus sat down to eat at Levi ’ s house . Many tax collectors and sinners were eating with Jesus and his disciples . Indeed , many of them had become his followers .
CEB	Mark	2	16	When some of the legal experts from among the Pharisees saw that he was eating with sinners and tax collectors , they asked his disciples , “ Why is he eating with sinners and tax collectors ? ”
CEB	Mark	2	17	When Jesus heard it , he said to them , “ Healthy people don ’ t need a doctor , but sick people do . I didn ’ t come to call righteous people , but sinners. ” When to fast
CEB	Mark	2	18	John ’ s disciples and the Pharisees had a habit of fasting . Some people asked Jesus , “ Why do John ’ s disciples and the Pharisees ’ disciples fast , but yours don ’ t ? ”
CEB	Mark	2	19	Jesus said , “ The wedding guests can ’ t fast while the groom is with them , can they ? As long as they have the groom with them , they can ’ t fast .
CEB	Mark	2	20	But the days will come when the groom will be taken away from them , and then they will fast .
CEB	Mark	2	21	“ No one sews a piece of new , unshrunk cloth on old clothes ; otherwise , the patch tears away from it , the new from the old , and makes a worse tear .
CEB	Mark	2	22	No one pours new wine into old leather wineskins ; otherwise , the wine would burst the wineskins and the wine would be lost and the wineskins destroyed . But new wine is for new wineskins. ” Scripture and the Sabbath
CEB	Mark	2	23	Jesus went through the wheat fields on the Sabbath . As the disciples made their way , they were picking the heads of wheat .
CEB	Mark	2	24	The Pharisees said to Jesus , “ Look ! Why are they breaking the Sabbath law ? ”
CEB	Mark	2	25	He said to them , “ Haven ’ t you ever read what David did when he was in need , when he and those with him were hungry ?
CEB	Mark	2	26	During the time when Abiathar was high priest , David went into God ’ s house and ate the bread of the presence , which only the priests were allowed to eat . He also gave bread to those who were with him. ”
CEB	Mark	2	27	Then he said , “ The Sabbath was created for humans ; humans weren ’ t created for the Sabbath .
CEB	Mark	2	28	This is why the Human One [ b ] is Lord even over the Sabbath . ”
CEB	Mark	3	3	He said to the man with the withered hand , “ Step up where people can see you. ”
CEB	Mark	3	2	Wanting to bring charges against Jesus , they were watching Jesus closely to see if he would heal on the Sabbath .
CEB	Mark	3	4	Then he said to them , “ Is it legal on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil , to save life or to kill ? ” But they said nothing .
CEB	Mark	3	5	Looking around at them with anger , deeply grieved at their unyielding hearts , he said to the man , “ Stretch out your hand. ” So he did , and his hand was made healthy .
CEB	Mark	3	6	At that , the Pharisees got together with the supporters of Herod to plan how to destroy Jesus . Healing and throwing demons out
CEB	Mark	3	7	Jesus left with his disciples and went to the lake . A large crowd followed him because they had heard what he was doing . They were from Galilee ,
CEB	Mark	3	8	Judea , Jerusalem , Idumea , beyond the Jordan , and the area surrounding Tyre and Sidon .
CEB	Mark	3	9	Jesus told his disciples to get a small boat ready for him so the crowd wouldn ’ t crush him .
CEB	Mark	3	10	He had healed so many people that everyone who was sick pushed forward so that they could touch him .
CEB	Mark	3	11	Whenever the evil spirits saw him , they fell down at his feet and shouted , “ You are God ’ s Son ! ”
CEB	Mark	3	12	But he strictly ordered them not to reveal who he was . Jesus appoints twelve apostles
CEB	Mark	3	13	Jesus went up on a mountain and called those he wanted , and they came to him .
CEB	Mark	3	14	He appointed twelve and called them apostles . He appointed them to be with him , to be sent out to preach ,
CEB	Mark	3	15	and to have authority to throw out demons .
CEB	Mark	3	16	He appointed twelve : Peter , a name he gave Simon ;
CEB	Mark	3	17	James and John , Zebedee ’ s sons , whom he nicknamed Boanerges , which means “ sons of Thunder ” ;
CEB	Mark	3	18	and Andrew ; Philip ; Bartholomew ; Matthew ; Thomas ; James , Alphaeus ’ son ; Thaddaeus ; Simon the Cananaean ; [ a ]
CEB	Mark	3	19	and Judas Iscariot , who betrayed Jesus . Misunderstandings about Jesus
CEB	Mark	3	20	Jesus entered a house . A crowd gathered again so that it was impossible for him and his followers even to eat .
CEB	Mark	3	21	When his family heard what was happening , they came to take control of him . They were saying , “ He ’ s out of his mind ! ”
CEB	Mark	3	22	The legal experts came down from Jerusalem . Over and over they charged , “ He ’ s possessed by Beelzebul . He throws out demons with the authority of the ruler of demons. ”
CEB	Mark	3	23	When Jesus called them together he spoke to them in a parable : “ How can Satan throw Satan out ?
CEB	Mark	3	24	A kingdom involved in civil war will collapse .
CEB	Mark	3	25	And a house torn apart by divisions will collapse .
CEB	Mark	3	26	If Satan rebels against himself and is divided , then he can ’ t endure . He ’ s done for .
CEB	Mark	3	27	No one gets into the house of a strong person and steals anything without first tying up the strong person . Only then can the house be burglarized .
CEB	Mark	3	28	I assure you that human beings will be forgiven for everything , for all sins and insults of every kind .
CEB	Mark	3	29	But whoever insults the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven . That person is guilty of a sin with consequences that last forever. ”
CEB	Mark	3	30	He said this because the legal experts were saying , “ He ’ s possessed by an evil spirit. ”
CEB	Mark	3	31	His mother and brothers arrived . They stood outside and sent word to him , calling for him .
CEB	Mark	3	32	A crowd was seated around him , and those sent to him said , “ Look , your mother , brothers , and sisters are outside looking for you. ”
CEB	Mark	3	33	He replied , “ Who is my mother ? Who are my brothers ? ”
CEB	Mark	3	34	Looking around at those seated around him in a circle , he said , “ Look , here are my mother and my brothers .
CEB	Mark	3	35	Whoever does God ’ s will is my brother , sister , and mother. ” Footnotes - Mark 3:18 Or zealot
CEB	Mark	4	4	As he was scattering seed , some fell on the path ; and the birds came and ate it .
CEB	Mark	4	2	He said many things to them in parables . While teaching them , he said ,
CEB	Mark	4	3	“ Listen to this ! A farmer went out to scatter seed .
CEB	Mark	4	5	Other seed fell on rocky ground where the soil was shallow . They sprouted immediately because the soil wasn ’ t deep .
CEB	Mark	4	6	When the sun came up , it scorched the plants ; and they dried up because they had no roots .
CEB	Mark	4	7	Other seed fell among thorny plants . The thorny plants grew and choked the seeds , and they produced nothing .
CEB	Mark	4	8	Other seed fell into good soil and bore fruit . Upon growing and increasing , the seed produced in one case a yield of thirty to one , in another case a yield of sixty to one , and in another case a yield of one hundred to one. ”
CEB	Mark	4	9	He said , “ Whoever has ears to listen should pay attention ! ” Jesus explains his parable
CEB	Mark	4	10	When they were alone , the people around Jesus , along with the Twelve , asked him about the parables .
CEB	Mark	4	11	He said to them , “ The secret of God ’ s kingdom has been given to you , but to those who are outside everything comes in parables .
CEB	Mark	4	12	This is so that they can look and see but have no insight , and they can hear but not understand . Otherwise , they might turn their lives around and be forgiven .
CEB	Mark	4	13	“ Don ’ t you understand this parable ? Then how will you understand all the parables ?
CEB	Mark	4	14	The farmer scatters the word .
CEB	Mark	4	15	This is the meaning of the seed that fell on the path : When the word is scattered and people hear it , right away Satan comes and steals the word that was planted in them .
CEB	Mark	4	16	Here ’ s the meaning of the seed that fell on rocky ground : When people hear the word , they immediately receive it joyfully .
CEB	Mark	4	17	Because they have no roots , they last for only a little while . When they experience distress or abuse because of the word , they immediately fall away .
CEB	Mark	4	18	Others are like the seed scattered among the thorny plants . These are the ones who have heard the word ;
CEB	Mark	4	19	but the worries of this life , the false appeal of wealth , and the desire for more things break in and choke the word , and it bears no fruit .
CEB	Mark	4	20	The seed scattered on good soil are those who hear the word and embrace it . They bear fruit , in one case a yield of thirty to one , in another case sixty to one , and in another case one hundred to one. ” Parables about lamps and measures
CEB	Mark	4	21	Jesus said to them , “ Does anyone bring in a lamp in order to put it under a basket or a bed ? Shouldn ’ t it be placed on a lampstand ?
CEB	Mark	4	22	Everything hidden will be revealed , and everything secret will come out into the open .
CEB	Mark	4	23	Whoever has ears to listen should pay attention ! ”
CEB	Mark	4	24	He said to them , “ Listen carefully ! God will evaluate you with the same standard you use to evaluate others . Indeed , you will receive even more .
CEB	Mark	4	25	Those who have will receive more , but as for those who don ’ t have , even what they don ’ t have will be taken away from them. ” More parables about God ’ s kingdom
CEB	Mark	4	26	Then Jesus said , “ This is what God ’ s kingdom is like . It ’ s as though someone scatters seed on the ground ,
CEB	Mark	4	27	then sleeps and wakes night and day . The seed sprouts and grows , but the farmer doesn ’ t know how .
CEB	Mark	4	28	The earth produces crops all by itself , first the stalk , then the head , then the full head of grain .
CEB	Mark	4	29	Whenever the crop is ready , the farmer goes out to cut the grain because it ’ s harvesttime. ”
CEB	Mark	4	30	He continued , “ What ’ s a good image for God ’ s kingdom ? What parable can I use to explain it ?
CEB	Mark	4	31	Consider a mustard seed . When scattered on the ground , it ’ s the smallest of all the seeds on the earth ;
CEB	Mark	4	32	but when it ’ s planted , it grows and becomes the largest of all vegetable plants . It produces such large branches that the birds in the sky are able to nest in its shade. ”
CEB	Mark	4	33	With many such parables he continued to give them the word , as much as they were able to hear .
CEB	Mark	4	34	He spoke to them only in parables , then explained everything to his disciples when he was alone with them . Jesus stops a storm
CEB	Mark	4	35	Later that day , when evening came , Jesus said to them , “ Let ’ s cross over to the other side of the lake. ”
CEB	Mark	4	36	They left the crowd and took him in the boat just as he was . Other boats followed along .
CEB	Mark	4	37	Gale-force winds arose , and waves crashed against the boat so that the boat was swamped .
CEB	Mark	4	38	But Jesus was in the rear of the boat , sleeping on a pillow . They woke him up and said , “ Teacher , don ’ t you care that we ’ re drowning ? ”
CEB	Mark	4	39	He got up and gave orders to the wind , and he said to the lake , “ Silence ! Be still ! ” The wind settled down and there was a great calm .
CEB	Mark	4	40	Jesus asked them , “ Why are you frightened ? Don ’ t you have faith yet ? ”
CEB	Mark	4	41	Overcome with awe , they said to each other , “ Who then is this ? Even the wind and the sea obey him ! ”
CEB	Mark	5	5	Night and day in the tombs and the hills , he would howl and cut himself with stones .
CEB	Mark	5	2	As soon as Jesus got out of the boat , a man possessed by an evil spirit came out of the tombs .
CEB	Mark	5	3	This man lived among the tombs , and no one was ever strong enough to restrain him , even with a chain .
CEB	Mark	5	4	He had been secured many times with leg irons and chains , but he broke the chains and smashed the leg irons . No one was tough enough to control him .
CEB	Mark	5	6	When he saw Jesus from far away , he ran and knelt before him ,
CEB	Mark	5	7	shouting , “ What have you to do with me , Jesus , Son of the Most High God ? Swear to God that you won ’ t torture me ! ”
CEB	Mark	5	8	He said this because Jesus had already commanded him , “ Unclean spirit , come out of the man ! ”
CEB	Mark	5	9	Jesus asked him , “ What is your name ? ” He responded , “ Legion is my name , because we are many. ”
CEB	Mark	5	10	They pleaded with Jesus not to send them out of that region .
CEB	Mark	5	11	A large herd of pigs was feeding on the hillside .
CEB	Mark	5	12	years old . They were shocked !
CEB	Mark	5	13	Jesus gave them permission , so the unclean spirits left the man and went into the pigs . Then the herd of about two thousand pigs rushed down the cliff into the lake and drowned .
CEB	Mark	5	14	Those who tended the pigs ran away and told the story in the city and in the countryside . People came to see what had happened .
CEB	Mark	5	15	They came to Jesus and saw the man who used to be demon-possessed . They saw the very man who had been filled with many demons sitting there fully dressed and completely sane , and they were filled with awe .
CEB	Mark	5	16	Those who had actually seen what had happened to the demon-possessed man told the others about the pigs .
CEB	Mark	5	17	Then they pleaded with Jesus to leave their region .
CEB	Mark	5	18	While he was climbing into the boat , the one who had been demon-possessed pleaded with Jesus to let him come along as one of his disciples .
CEB	Mark	5	19	But Jesus wouldn ’ t allow it . “ Go home to your own people , ” Jesus said , “ and tell them what the Lord has done for you and how he has shown you mercy. ”
CEB	Mark	5	20	The man went away and began to proclaim in the Ten Cities all that Jesus had done for him , and everyone was amazed . Jesus heals two people
CEB	Mark	5	21	Jesus crossed the lake again , and on the other side a large crowd gathered around him on the shore .
CEB	Mark	5	22	Jairus , one of the synagogue leaders , came forward . When he saw Jesus , he fell at his feet
CEB	Mark	5	23	and pleaded with him , “ My daughter is about to die . Please , come and place your hands on her so that she can be healed and live. ”
CEB	Mark	5	24	So Jesus went with him . A swarm of people were following Jesus , crowding in on him .
CEB	Mark	5	25	A woman was there who had been bleeding for twelve years .
CEB	Mark	5	26	She had suffered a lot under the care of many doctors , and had spent everything she had without getting any better . In fact , she had gotten worse .
CEB	Mark	5	27	Because she had heard about Jesus , she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his clothes .
CEB	Mark	5	28	She was thinking , If I can just touch his clothes , I ’ ll be healed .
CEB	Mark	5	29	Her bleeding stopped immediately , and she sensed in her body that her illness had been healed .
CEB	Mark	5	30	At that very moment , Jesus recognized that power had gone out from him . He turned around in the crowd and said , “ Who touched my clothes ? ”
CEB	Mark	5	31	His disciples said to him , “ Don ’ t you see the crowd pressing against you ? Yet you ask , ‘ Who touched me ? ’ ”
CEB	Mark	5	32	But Jesus looked around carefully to see who had done it .
CEB	Mark	5	33	The woman , full of fear and trembling , came forward . Knowing what had happened to her , she fell down in front of Jesus and told him the whole truth .
CEB	Mark	5	34	He responded , “ Daughter , your faith has healed you ; go in peace , healed from your disease. ”
CEB	Mark	5	35	While Jesus was still speaking with her , messengers came from the synagogue leader ’ s house , saying to Jairus , “ Your daughter has died . Why bother the teacher any longer ? ”
CEB	Mark	5	36	But Jesus overheard their report and said to the synagogue leader , “ Don ’ t be afraid ; just keep trusting. ”
CEB	Mark	5	37	He didn ’ t allow anyone to follow him except Peter , James , and John , James ’ brother .
CEB	Mark	5	38	They came to the synagogue leader ’ s house , and he saw a commotion , with people crying and wailing loudly .
CEB	Mark	5	39	He went in and said to them , “ What ’ s all this commotion and crying about ? The child isn ’ t dead . She ’ s only sleeping. ”
CEB	Mark	5	40	They laughed at him , but he threw them all out . Then , taking the child ’ s parents and his disciples with him , he went to the room where the child was .
CEB	Mark	5	41	Taking her hand , he said to her , “ Talitha koum , ” which means , “ Young woman , get up. ”
CEB	Mark	5	42	Suddenly the young woman got up and began to walk around . She was
CEB	Mark	5	43	He gave them strict orders that no one should know what had happened . Then he told them to give her something to eat .
CEB	Mark	6	6	He was appalled by their disbelief . Sending out the disciples Then Jesus traveled through the surrounding villages teaching .
CEB	Mark	6	2	On the Sabbath , he began to teach in the synagogue . Many who heard him were surprised . “ Where did this man get all this ? What ’ s this wisdom he ’ s been given ? What about the powerful acts accomplished through him ?
CEB	Mark	6	3	Isn ’ t this the carpenter ? Isn ’ t he Mary ’ s son and the brother of James , Joses , Judas , and Simon ? Aren ’ t his sisters here with us ? ” They were repulsed by him and fell into sin .
CEB	Mark	6	4	Jesus said to them , “ Prophets are honored everywhere except in their own hometowns , among their relatives , and in their own households. ”
CEB	Mark	6	5	He was unable to do any miracles there , except that he placed his hands on a few sick people and healed them .
CEB	Mark	6	7	He called for the Twelve and sent them out in pairs . He gave them authority over unclean spirits .
CEB	Mark	6	8	He instructed them to take nothing for the journey except a walking stick—no bread , no bags , and no money in their belts .
CEB	Mark	6	9	He told them to wear sandals but not to put on two shirts .
CEB	Mark	6	10	He said , “ Whatever house you enter , remain there until you leave that place .
CEB	Mark	6	11	If a place doesn ’ t welcome you or listen to you , as you leave , shake the dust off your feet as a witness against them. ”
CEB	Mark	6	12	So they went out and proclaimed that people should change their hearts and lives .
CEB	Mark	6	13	They cast out many demons , and they anointed many sick people with olive oil and healed them . Death of John the Baptist
CEB	Mark	6	14	Herod the king heard about these things , because the name of Jesus had become well-known . Some were saying , “ John the Baptist has been raised from the dead , and this is why miraculous powers are at work through him. ”
CEB	Mark	6	15	Others were saying , “ He is Elijah. ” Still others were saying , “ He is a prophet like one of the ancient prophets. ”
CEB	Mark	6	16	But when Herod heard these rumors , he said , “ John , whom I beheaded , has been raised to life. ”
CEB	Mark	6	17	He said this because Herod himself had arranged to have John arrested and put in prison because of Herodias , the wife of Herod ’ s brother Philip . Herod had married her ,
CEB	Mark	6	18	but John told Herod , “ It ’ s against the law for you to marry your brother ’ s wife ! ”
CEB	Mark	6	19	So Herodias had it in for John . She wanted to kill him , but she couldn ’ t .
CEB	Mark	6	20	This was because Herod respected John . He regarded him as a righteous and holy person , so he protected him . John ’ s words greatly confused Herod , yet he enjoyed listening to him .
CEB	Mark	6	21	Finally , the time was right . It was on one of Herod ’ s birthdays , when he had prepared a feast for his high-ranking officials and military officers and Galilee ’ s leading residents .
CEB	Mark	6	22	Herod ’ s daughter Herodias [ a ] came in and danced , thrilling Herod and his dinner guests . The king said to the young woman , “ Ask me whatever you wish , and I will give it to you. ”
CEB	Mark	6	23	Then he swore to her , “ Whatever you ask I will give to you , even as much as half of my kingdom. ”
CEB	Mark	6	24	She left the banquet hall and said to her mother , “ What should I ask for ? ” “ John the Baptist ’ s head , ” Herodias replied .
CEB	Mark	6	25	Hurrying back to the ruler , she made her request : “ I want you to give me John the Baptist ’ s head on a plate , right this minute. ”
CEB	Mark	6	26	Although the king was upset , because of his solemn pledge and his guests , he didn ’ t want to refuse her .
CEB	Mark	6	27	So he ordered a guard to bring John ’ s head . The guard went to the prison , cut off John ’ s head ,
CEB	Mark	6	28	brought his head on a plate , and gave it to the young woman , and she gave it to her mother .
CEB	Mark	6	29	When John ’ s disciples heard what had happened , they came and took his dead body and laid it in a tomb . Jesus feeds five thousand people
CEB	Mark	6	30	The apostles returned to Jesus and told him everything they had done and taught .
CEB	Mark	6	31	Many people were coming and going , so there was no time to eat . He said to the apostles , “ Come by yourselves to a secluded place and rest for a while. ”
CEB	Mark	6	32	They departed in a boat by themselves for a deserted place .
CEB	Mark	6	33	Many people saw them leaving and recognized them , so they ran ahead from all the cities and arrived before them .
CEB	Mark	6	34	When Jesus arrived and saw a large crowd , he had compassion on them because they were like sheep without a shepherd . Then he began to teach them many things .
CEB	Mark	6	35	Late in the day , his disciples came to him and said , “ This is an isolated place , and it ’ s already late in the day .
CEB	Mark	6	36	Send them away so that they can go to the surrounding countryside and villages and buy something to eat for themselves. ”
CEB	Mark	6	37	He replied , “ You give them something to eat. ” But they said to him , “ Should we go off and buy bread worth almost eight months ’ pay [ b ] and give it to them to eat ? ”
CEB	Mark	6	38	He said to them , “ How much bread do you have ? Take a look. ” After checking , they said , “ Five loaves of bread and two fish. ”
CEB	Mark	6	39	He directed the disciples to seat all the people in groups as though they were having a banquet on the green grass .
CEB	Mark	6	40	They sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties .
CEB	Mark	6	41	He took the five loaves and the two fish , looked up to heaven , blessed them , broke the loaves into pieces , and gave them to his disciples to set before the people . He also divided the two fish among them all .
CEB	Mark	6	42	Everyone ate until they were full .
CEB	Mark	6	43	They filled twelve baskets with the leftover pieces of bread and fish .
CEB	Mark	6	44	About five thousand had eaten . Jesus walks on water
CEB	Mark	6	45	Right then , Jesus made his disciples get into a boat and go ahead to the other side of the lake , toward Bethsaida , while he dismissed the crowd .
CEB	Mark	6	46	After saying good-bye to them , Jesus went up onto a mountain to pray .
CEB	Mark	6	47	Evening came and the boat was in the middle of the lake , but he was alone on the land .
CEB	Mark	6	48	He saw his disciples struggling . They were trying to row forward , but the wind was blowing against them . Very early in the morning , he came to them , walking on the lake . He intended to pass by them .
CEB	Mark	6	49	When they saw him walking on the lake , they thought he was a ghost and they screamed .
CEB	Mark	6	50	Seeing him was terrifying to all of them . Just then he spoke to them , “ Be encouraged ! It ’ s me . Don ’ t be afraid. ”
CEB	Mark	6	51	He got into the boat , and the wind settled down . His disciples were so baffled they were beside themselves .
CEB	Mark	6	52	That ’ s because they hadn ’ t understood about the loaves . Their minds had been closed so that they resisted God ’ s ways . Healings at Gennesaret
CEB	Mark	6	53	When Jesus and his disciples had crossed the lake , they landed at Gennesaret , anchored the boat ,
CEB	Mark	6	54	and came ashore . People immediately recognized Jesus
CEB	Mark	6	55	and ran around that whole region bringing sick people on their mats to wherever they heard he was .
CEB	Mark	6	56	Wherever he went—villages , cities , or farming communities—they would place the sick in the marketplaces and beg him to allow them to touch even the hem of his clothing . Everyone who touched him was healed .
CEB	Mark	7	7	Their worship of me is empty since they teach instructions that are human words . [ a ]
CEB	Mark	7	2	They saw some of his disciples eating food with unclean hands . ( They were eating without first ritually purifying their hands through washing .
CEB	Mark	7	3	The Pharisees and all the Jews don ’ t eat without first washing their hands carefully . This is a way of observing the rules handed down by the elders .
CEB	Mark	7	4	Upon returning from the marketplace , they don ’ t eat without first immersing themselves . They observe many other rules that have been handed down , such as the washing of cups , jugs , pans , and sleeping mats . )
CEB	Mark	7	5	So the Pharisees and legal experts asked Jesus , “ Why are your disciples not living according to the rules handed down by the elders but instead eat food with ritually unclean hands ? ”
CEB	Mark	7	6	He replied , “ Isaiah really knew what he was talking about when he prophesied about you hypocrites . He wrote , This people honors me with their lips , but their hearts are far away from me .
CEB	Mark	7	8	You ignore God ’ s commandment while holding on to rules created by humans and handed down to you. ”
CEB	Mark	7	9	Jesus continued , “ Clearly , you are experts at rejecting God ’ s commandment in order to establish these rules .
CEB	Mark	7	10	Moses said , Honor your father and your mother , [ b ] and The person who speaks against father or mother will certainly be put to death . [ c ]
CEB	Mark	7	11	But you say , ‘ If you tell your father or mother , “ Everything I ’ m expected to contribute to you is corban ( that is , a gift I ’ m giving to God ) , ”
CEB	Mark	7	12	then you are no longer required to care for your father or mother. ’
CEB	Mark	7	13	In this way you do away with God ’ s word in favor of the rules handed down to you , which you pass on to others . And you do a lot of other things just like that. ”
CEB	Mark	7	14	Then Jesus called the crowd again and said , “ Listen to me , all of you , and understand .
CEB	Mark	7	15	Nothing outside of a person can enter and contaminate a person in God ’ s sight ; rather , the things that come out of a person contaminate the person. ” [ d ]
CEB	Mark	7	17	After leaving the crowd , he entered a house where his disciples asked him about that riddle .
CEB	Mark	7	18	He said to them , “ Don ’ t you understand either ? Don ’ t you know that nothing from the outside that enters a person has the power to contaminate ?
CEB	Mark	7	19	That ’ s because it doesn ’ t enter into the heart but into the stomach , and it goes out into the sewer. ” By saying this , Jesus declared that no food could contaminate a person in God ’ s sight .
CEB	Mark	7	20	“ It ’ s what comes out of a person that contaminates someone in God ’ s sight , ” he said .
CEB	Mark	7	21	“ It ’ s from the inside , from the human heart , that evil thoughts come : sexual sins , thefts , murders ,
CEB	Mark	7	22	adultery , greed , evil actions , deceit , unrestrained immorality , envy , insults , arrogance , and foolishness .
CEB	Mark	7	23	All these evil things come from the inside and contaminate a person in God ’ s sight. ” An immigrant ’ s daughter is delivered
CEB	Mark	7	24	Jesus left that place and went into the region of Tyre . He didn ’ t want anyone to know that he had entered a house , but he couldn ’ t hide .
CEB	Mark	7	25	In fact , a woman whose young daughter was possessed by an unclean spirit heard about him right away . She came and fell at his feet .
CEB	Mark	7	26	The woman was Greek , Syrophoenician by birth . She begged Jesus to throw the demon out of her daughter .
CEB	Mark	7	27	He responded , “ The children have to be fed first . It isn ’ t right to take the children ’ s bread and toss it to the dogs. ”
CEB	Mark	7	28	But she answered , “ Lord , even the dogs under the table eat the children ’ s crumbs. ”
CEB	Mark	7	29	“ Good answer ! ” he said . “ Go on home . The demon has already left your daughter. ”
CEB	Mark	7	30	When she returned to her house , she found the child lying on the bed and the demon gone . A deaf man is healed
CEB	Mark	7	31	After leaving the region of Tyre , Jesus went through Sidon toward the Galilee Sea through the region of the Ten Cities .
CEB	Mark	7	32	Some people brought to him a man who was deaf and could hardly speak , and they begged him to place his hand on the man for healing .
CEB	Mark	7	33	Jesus took him away from the crowd by himself and put his fingers in the man ’ s ears . Then he spit and touched the man ’ s tongue .
CEB	Mark	7	34	Looking into heaven , Jesus sighed deeply and said , “ Ephphatha , ” which means , “ Open up. ”
CEB	Mark	7	35	At once , his ears opened , his twisted tongue was released , and he began to speak clearly .
CEB	Mark	7	36	Jesus gave the people strict orders not to tell anyone . But the more he tried to silence them , the more eagerly they shared the news .
CEB	Mark	7	37	People were overcome with wonder , saying , “ He does everything well ! He even makes the deaf to hear and gives speech to those who can ’ t speak. ” Footnotes - Mark 7:7 Isa 29:13 - Mark 7:10 Exod 20:12 ; Deut 5:16 - Mark 7:10 Exod 21:17 ; Lev 20:9 - Mark 7:15 7:16 is omitted in most critical editions of the Gk New Testament Whoever has ears to listen should pay attention !
CEB	Mark	8	8	They ate until they were full . They collected seven baskets full of leftovers .
CEB	Mark	8	2	“ I feel sorry for the crowd because they have been with me for three days and have nothing to eat .
CEB	Mark	8	3	If I send them away hungry to their homes , they won ’ t have enough strength to travel , for some have come a long distance. ”
CEB	Mark	8	4	His disciples responded , “ How can anyone get enough food in this wilderness to satisfy these people ? ”
CEB	Mark	8	5	Jesus asked , “ How much bread do you have ? ” They said , “ Seven loaves. ”
CEB	Mark	8	6	He told the crowd to sit on the ground . He took the seven loaves , gave thanks , broke them apart , and gave them to his disciples to distribute ; and they gave the bread to the crowd .
CEB	Mark	8	7	They also had a few fish . He said a blessing over them , then gave them to the disciples to hand out also .
CEB	Mark	8	9	This was a crowd of about four thousand people ! Jesus sent them away ,
CEB	Mark	8	10	then got into a boat with his disciples and went over to the region of Dalmanutha . Looking for proof
CEB	Mark	8	11	The Pharisees showed up and began to argue with Jesus . To test him , they asked for a sign from heaven .
CEB	Mark	8	12	With an impatient sigh , Jesus said , “ Why does this generation look for a sign ? I assure you that no sign will be given to it. ”
CEB	Mark	8	13	Leaving them , he got back in the boat and crossed to the other side of the lake . Understanding about the bread
CEB	Mark	8	14	Jesus ’ disciples had forgotten to bring any bread , so they had only one loaf with them in the boat .
CEB	Mark	8	15	He gave them strict orders : “ Watch out and be on your guard for the yeast of the Pharisees as well as the yeast of Herod. ”
CEB	Mark	8	16	The disciples discussed this among themselves , “ He said this because we have no bread. ”
CEB	Mark	8	17	Jesus knew what they were discussing and said , “ Why are you talking about the fact that you don ’ t have any bread ? Don ’ t you grasp what has happened ? Don ’ t you understand ? Are your hearts so resistant to what God is doing ?
CEB	Mark	8	18	Don ’ t you have eyes ? Why can ’ t you see ? Don ’ t you have ears ? Why can ’ t you hear ? Don ’ t you remember ?
CEB	Mark	8	19	When I broke five loaves of bread for those five thousand people , how many baskets full of leftovers did you gather ? ” They answered , “ Twelve. ”
CEB	Mark	8	20	“ And when I broke seven loaves of bread for those four thousand people , how many baskets full of leftovers did you gather ? ” They answered , “ Seven. ”
CEB	Mark	8	21	Jesus said to them , “ And you still don ’ t understand ? ” A blind man is healed
CEB	Mark	8	22	Jesus and his disciples came to Bethsaida . Some people brought a blind man to Jesus and begged him to touch and heal him .
CEB	Mark	8	23	Taking the blind man ’ s hand , Jesus led him out of the village . After spitting on his eyes and laying his hands on the man , he asked him , “ Do you see anything ? ”
CEB	Mark	8	24	The man looked up and said , “ I see people . They look like trees , only they are walking around. ”
CEB	Mark	8	25	Then Jesus placed his hands on the man ’ s eyes again . He looked with his eyes wide open , his sight was restored , and he could see everything clearly .
CEB	Mark	8	26	Then Jesus sent him home , saying , “ Don ’ t go into the village ! ” Jesus predicts his death
CEB	Mark	8	27	Jesus and his disciples went into the villages near Caesarea Philippi . On the way he asked his disciples , “ Who do people say that I am ? ”
CEB	Mark	8	28	They told him , “ Some say John the Baptist , others Elijah , and still others one of the prophets. ”
CEB	Mark	8	29	He asked them , “ And what about you ? Who do you say that I am ? ” Peter answered , “ You are the Christ. ”
CEB	Mark	8	30	Jesus ordered them not to tell anyone about him .
CEB	Mark	8	31	Then Jesus began to teach his disciples : “ The Human One [ a ] must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders , chief priests , and the legal experts , and be killed , and then , after three days , rise from the dead. ”
CEB	Mark	8	32	He said this plainly . But Peter took hold of Jesus and , scolding him , began to correct him .
CEB	Mark	8	33	Jesus turned and looked at his disciples , then sternly corrected Peter : “ Get behind me , Satan . You are not thinking God ’ s thoughts but human thoughts. ”
CEB	Mark	8	34	After calling the crowd together with his disciples , Jesus said to them , “ All who want to come after me must say no to themselves , take up their cross , and follow me .
CEB	Mark	8	35	All who want to save their lives will lose them . But all who lose their lives because of me and because of the good news will save them .
CEB	Mark	8	36	Why would people gain the whole world but lose their lives ?
CEB	Mark	8	37	What will people give in exchange for their lives ?
CEB	Mark	8	38	Whoever is ashamed of me and my words in this unfaithful and sinful generation , the Human One [ b ] will be ashamed of that person when he comes in the Father ’ s glory with the holy angels . ”
CEB	Mark	9	9	As they were coming down the mountain , he ordered them not to tell anyone what they had seen until after the Human One [ a ] had risen from the dead .
CEB	Mark	9	1	Jesus continued , “ I assure you that some standing here won ’ t die before they see God ’ s kingdom arrive in power. ” Jesus transformed
CEB	Mark	9	2	Six days later Jesus took Peter , James , and John , and brought them to the top of a very high mountain where they were alone . He was transformed in front of them ,
CEB	Mark	9	3	and his clothes were amazingly bright , brighter than if they had been bleached white .
CEB	Mark	9	4	Elijah and Moses appeared and were talking with Jesus .
CEB	Mark	9	5	Peter reacted to all of this by saying to Jesus , “ Rabbi , it ’ s good that we ’ re here . Let ’ s make three shrines—one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah. ”
CEB	Mark	9	6	He said this because he didn ’ t know how to respond , for the three of them were terrified .
CEB	Mark	9	7	Then a cloud overshadowed them , and a voice spoke from the cloud , “ This is my Son , whom I dearly love . Listen to him ! ”
CEB	Mark	9	8	Suddenly , looking around , they no longer saw anyone with them except Jesus .
CEB	Mark	9	10	So they kept it to themselves , wondering , “ What ’ s this ‘ rising from the dead ’ ? ”
CEB	Mark	9	11	They asked Jesus , “ Why do the legal experts say that Elijah must come first ? ”
CEB	Mark	9	12	He answered , “ Elijah does come first to restore all things . Why was it written that the Human One [ b ] would suffer many things and be rejected ?
CEB	Mark	9	13	In fact , I tell you that Elijah has come , but they did to him whatever they wanted , just as it was written about him. ” A demon-possessed boy
CEB	Mark	9	14	When Jesus , Peter , James , and John approached the other disciples , they saw a large crowd surrounding them and legal experts arguing with them .
CEB	Mark	9	15	Suddenly the whole crowd caught sight of Jesus . They ran to greet him , overcome with excitement .
CEB	Mark	9	16	Jesus asked them , “ What are you arguing about ? ”
CEB	Mark	9	17	Someone from the crowd responded , “ Teacher , I brought my son to you , since he has a spirit that doesn ’ t allow him to speak .
CEB	Mark	9	18	Wherever it overpowers him , it throws him into a fit . He foams at the mouth , grinds his teeth , and stiffens up . So I spoke to your disciples to see if they could throw it out , but they couldn ’ t. ”
CEB	Mark	9	19	Jesus answered them , “ You faithless generation , how long will I be with you ? How long will I put up with you ? Bring him to me. ”
CEB	Mark	9	20	They brought him . When the spirit saw Jesus , it immediately threw the boy into a fit . He fell on the ground and rolled around , foaming at the mouth .
CEB	Mark	9	21	Jesus asked his father , “ How long has this been going on ? ” He said , “ Since he was a child .
CEB	Mark	9	22	It has often thrown him into a fire or into water trying to kill him . If you can do anything , help us ! Show us compassion ! ”
CEB	Mark	9	23	Jesus said to him , “ ‘ If you can do anything ’ ? All things are possible for the one who has faith. ”
CEB	Mark	9	24	At that the boy ’ s father cried out , “ I have faith ; help my lack of faith ! ”
CEB	Mark	9	25	Noticing that the crowd had surged together , Jesus spoke harshly to the unclean spirit , “ Mute and deaf spirit , I command you to come out of him and never enter him again. ”
CEB	Mark	9	26	After screaming and shaking the boy horribly , the spirit came out . The boy seemed to be dead ; in fact , several people said that he had died .
CEB	Mark	9	27	But Jesus took his hand , lifted him up , and he arose .
CEB	Mark	9	28	After Jesus went into a house , his disciples asked him privately , “ Why couldn ’ t we throw this spirit out ? ”
CEB	Mark	9	29	Jesus answered , “ Throwing this kind of spirit out requires prayer. ” Jesus predicts his death
CEB	Mark	9	30	From there Jesus and his followers went through Galilee , but he didn ’ t want anyone to know it .
CEB	Mark	9	31	This was because he was teaching his disciples , “ The Human One [ c ] will be delivered into human hands . They will kill him . Three days after he is killed he will rise up. ”
CEB	Mark	9	32	But they didn ’ t understand this kind of talk , and they were afraid to ask him .
CEB	Mark	9	33	They entered Capernaum . When they had come into a house , he asked them , “ What were you arguing about during the journey ? ”
CEB	Mark	9	34	They didn ’ t respond , since on the way they had been debating with each other about who was the greatest .
CEB	Mark	9	35	He sat down , called the Twelve , and said to them , “ Whoever wants to be first must be least of all and the servant of all. ”
CEB	Mark	9	36	Jesus reached for a little child , placed him among the Twelve , and embraced him . Then he said ,
CEB	Mark	9	37	“ Whoever welcomes one of these children in my name welcomes me ; and whoever welcomes me isn ’ t actually welcoming me but rather the one who sent me. ” Recognize your allies
CEB	Mark	9	38	John said to Jesus , “ Teacher , we saw someone throwing demons out in your name , and we tried to stop him because he wasn ’ t following us. ”
CEB	Mark	9	39	Jesus replied , “ Don ’ t stop him . No one who does powerful acts in my name can quickly turn around and curse me .
CEB	Mark	9	40	Whoever isn ’ t against us is for us .
CEB	Mark	9	41	I assure you that whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you belong to Christ will certainly be rewarded .
CEB	Mark	9	42	“ As for whoever causes these little ones who believe in me to trip and fall into sin , it would be better for them to have a huge stone hung around their necks and to be thrown into the lake .
CEB	Mark	9	43	If your hand causes you to fall into sin , chop it off . It ’ s better for you to enter into life crippled than to go away with two hands into the fire of hell , which can ’ t be put out . [ d ]
CEB	Mark	9	45	If your foot causes you to fall into sin , chop it off . It ’ s better for you to enter life lame than to be thrown into hell with two feet . [ e ]
CEB	Mark	9	47	If your eye causes you to fall into sin , tear it out . It ’ s better for you to enter God ’ s kingdom with one eye than to be thrown into hell with two .
CEB	Mark	9	48	That ’ s a place where worms don ’ t die and the fire never goes out . [ f ]
CEB	Mark	9	49	Everyone will be salted with fire .
CEB	Mark	9	50	Salt is good ; but if salt loses its saltiness , how will it become salty again ? Maintain salt among yourselves and keep peace with each other. ” Footnotes - Mark 9:9 Or Son of Man - Mark 9:12 Or Son of Man - Mark 9:31 Or Son of Man - Mark 9:43 9:44 is omitted in most critical editions of the Gk New Testament where worms don ’ t die and the fire never goes out . - Mark 9:45 9:46 is omitted in most critical editions of the Gk New Testament where worms don ’ t die and the fire never goes out . - Mark 9:48 Isa 66:24
CEB	Mark	10	10	Inside the house , the disciples asked him again about this .
CEB	Mark	10	2	Some Pharisees came and , trying to test him , they asked , “ Does the Law allow a man to divorce his wife ? ”
CEB	Mark	10	3	Jesus answered , “ What did Moses command you ? ”
CEB	Mark	10	4	They said , “ Moses allowed a man to write a divorce certificate and to divorce his wife. ”
CEB	Mark	10	5	Jesus said to them , “ He wrote this commandment for you because of your unyielding hearts .
CEB	Mark	10	6	At the beginning of creation , God made them male and female . [ a ]
CEB	Mark	10	7	Because of this , a man should leave his father and mother and be joined together with his wife ,
CEB	Mark	10	8	and the two will be one flesh . [ b ] So they are no longer two but one flesh .
CEB	Mark	10	9	Therefore , humans must not pull apart what God has put together. ”
CEB	Mark	10	11	He said to them , “ Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her ;
CEB	Mark	10	12	and if a wife divorces her husband and marries another , she commits adultery. ” Jesus blesses children
CEB	Mark	10	13	People were bringing children to Jesus so that he would bless them . But the disciples scolded them .
CEB	Mark	10	14	When Jesus saw this , he grew angry and said to them , “ Allow the children to come to me . Don ’ t forbid them , because God ’ s kingdom belongs to people like these children .
CEB	Mark	10	15	I assure you that whoever doesn ’ t welcome God ’ s kingdom like a child will never enter it. ”
CEB	Mark	10	16	Then he hugged the children and blessed them . A rich man ’ s question
CEB	Mark	10	17	As Jesus continued down the road , a man ran up , knelt before him , and asked , “ Good Teacher , what must I do to obtain eternal life ? ”
CEB	Mark	10	18	Jesus replied , “ Why do you call me good ? No one is good except the one God .
CEB	Mark	10	19	You know the commandments : Don ’ t commit murder . Don ’ t commit adultery . Don ’ t steal . Don ’ t give false testimony . Don ’ t cheat . Honor your father and mother. ” [ c ]
CEB	Mark	10	20	“ Teacher , ” he responded , “ I ’ ve kept all of these things since I was a boy. ”
CEB	Mark	10	21	Jesus looked at him carefully and loved him . He said , “ You are lacking one thing . Go , sell what you own , and give the money to the poor . Then you will have treasure in heaven . And come , follow me. ”
CEB	Mark	10	22	But the man was dismayed at this statement and went away saddened , because he had many possessions .
CEB	Mark	10	23	Looking around , Jesus said to his disciples , “ It will be very hard for the wealthy to enter God ’ s kingdom ! ”
CEB	Mark	10	24	His words startled the disciples , so Jesus told them again , “ Children , it ’ s difficult to enter God ’ s kingdom !
CEB	Mark	10	25	It ’ s easier for a camel to squeeze through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter God ’ s kingdom. ”
CEB	Mark	10	26	They were shocked even more and said to each other , “ Then who can be saved ? ”
CEB	Mark	10	27	Jesus looked at them carefully and said , “ It ’ s impossible with human beings , but not with God . All things are possible for God. ”
CEB	Mark	10	28	Peter said to him , “ Look , we ’ ve left everything and followed you. ”
CEB	Mark	10	29	Jesus said , “ I assure you that anyone who has left house , brothers , sisters , mother , father , children , or farms because of me and because of the good news
CEB	Mark	10	30	will receive one hundred times as much now in this life—houses , brothers , sisters , mothers , children , and farms ( with harassment ) —and in the coming age , eternal life .
CEB	Mark	10	31	But many who are first will be last . And many who are last will be first. ” Jesus predicts his death and resurrection
CEB	Mark	10	32	Jesus and his disciples were on the road , going up to Jerusalem , with Jesus in the lead . The disciples were amazed while the others following behind were afraid . Taking the Twelve aside again , he told them what was about to happen to him .
CEB	Mark	10	33	“ Look ! ” he said . “ We ’ re going up to Jerusalem . The Human One [ d ] will be handed over to the chief priests and the legal experts . They will condemn him to death and hand him over to the Gentiles .
CEB	Mark	10	34	They will ridicule him , spit on him , torture him , and kill him . After three days , he will rise up. ” A request from James and John
CEB	Mark	10	35	James and John , Zebedee ’ s sons , came to Jesus and said , “ Teacher , we want you to do for us whatever we ask. ”
CEB	Mark	10	36	“ What do you want me to do for you ? ” he asked .
CEB	Mark	10	37	They said , “ Allow one of us to sit on your right and the other on your left when you enter your glory. ”
CEB	Mark	10	38	Jesus replied , “ You don ’ t know what you ’ re asking ! Can you drink the cup I drink or receive the baptism I receive ? ”
CEB	Mark	10	39	“ We can , ” they answered . Jesus said , “ You will drink the cup I drink and receive the baptism I receive ,
CEB	Mark	10	40	but to sit at my right or left hand isn ’ t mine to give . It belongs to those for whom it has been prepared. ”
CEB	Mark	10	41	Now when the other ten disciples heard about this , they became angry with James and John .
CEB	Mark	10	42	Jesus called them over and said , “ You know that the ones who are considered the rulers by the Gentiles show off their authority over them and their high-ranking officials order them around .
CEB	Mark	10	43	But that ’ s not the way it will be with you . Whoever wants to be great among you will be your servant .
CEB	Mark	10	44	Whoever wants to be first among you will be the slave of all ,
CEB	Mark	10	45	for the Human One [ e ] didn ’ t come to be served but rather to serve and to give his life to liberate many people. ” Healing of blind Bartimaeus
CEB	Mark	10	46	Jesus and his followers came into Jericho . As Jesus was leaving Jericho , together with his disciples and a sizable crowd , a blind beggar named Bartimaeus , Timaeus ’ son , was sitting beside the road .
CEB	Mark	10	47	When he heard that Jesus of Nazareth was there , he began to shout , “ Jesus , Son of David , show me mercy ! ”
CEB	Mark	10	48	Many scolded him , telling him to be quiet , but he shouted even louder , “ Son of David , show me mercy ! ”
CEB	Mark	10	49	Jesus stopped and said , “ Call him forward. ” They called the blind man , “ Be encouraged ! Get up ! He ’ s calling you. ”
CEB	Mark	10	50	Throwing his coat to the side , he jumped up and came to Jesus .
CEB	Mark	10	51	Jesus asked him , “ What do you want me to do for you ? ” The blind man said , “ Teacher , I want to see. ”
CEB	Mark	10	52	Jesus said , “ Go , your faith has healed you. ” At once he was able to see , and he began to follow Jesus on the way . Footnotes - Mark 10:6 Gen 1:27 - Mark 10:8 Gen 2:24 - Mark 10:19 Exod 20:12-16 ; Deut 5:16-20 - Mark 10:33 Or Son of Man - Mark 10:45 Or Son of Man
CEB	Mark	11	11	Jesus entered Jerusalem and went into the temple . After he looked around at everything , because it was already late in the evening , he returned to Bethany with the Twelve . Fig tree and the temple
CEB	Mark	11	2	saying to them , “ Go into the village over there . As soon as you enter it , you will find tied up there a colt that no one has ridden . Untie it and bring it here .
CEB	Mark	11	3	If anyone says to you , ‘ Why are you doing this ? ’ say , ‘ Its master needs it , and he will send it back right away. ’ ”
CEB	Mark	11	4	They went and found a colt tied to a gate outside on the street , and they untied it .
CEB	Mark	11	5	Some people standing around said to them , “ What are you doing , untying the colt ? ”
CEB	Mark	11	6	They told them just what Jesus said , and they left them alone .
CEB	Mark	11	7	They brought the colt to Jesus and threw their clothes upon it , and he sat on it .
CEB	Mark	11	8	Many people spread out their clothes on the road while others spread branches cut from the fields .
CEB	Mark	11	9	Those in front of him and those following were shouting , “ Hosanna ! Blessings on the one who comes in the name of the Lord ! [ a ]
CEB	Mark	11	10	Blessings on the coming kingdom of our ancestor David ! Hosanna in the highest ! ”
CEB	Mark	11	12	The next day , after leaving Bethany , Jesus was hungry .
CEB	Mark	11	13	From far away , he noticed a fig tree in leaf , so he went to see if he could find anything on it . When he came to it , he found nothing except leaves , since it wasn ’ t the season for figs .
CEB	Mark	11	14	So he said to it , “ No one will ever again eat your fruit ! ” His disciples heard this .
CEB	Mark	11	15	They came into Jerusalem . After entering the temple , he threw out those who were selling and buying there . He pushed over the tables used for currency exchange and the chairs of those who sold doves .
CEB	Mark	11	16	He didn ’ t allow anyone to carry anything through the temple .
CEB	Mark	11	17	He taught them , “ Hasn ’ t it been written , My house will be called a house of prayer for all nations ? [ b ] But you ’ ve turned it into a hideout for crooks. ” [ c ]
CEB	Mark	11	18	The chief priests and legal experts heard this and tried to find a way to destroy him . They regarded him as dangerous because the whole crowd was enthralled at his teaching .
CEB	Mark	11	19	When it was evening , Jesus and his disciples went outside the city . Power , prayer , and forgiveness
CEB	Mark	11	20	Early in the morning , as Jesus and his disciples were walking along , they saw the fig tree withered from the root up .
CEB	Mark	11	21	Peter remembered and said to Jesus , “ Rabbi , look how the fig tree you cursed has dried up. ”
CEB	Mark	11	22	Jesus responded to them , “ Have faith in God !
CEB	Mark	11	23	I assure you that whoever says to this mountain , ‘ Be lifted up and thrown into the sea ’ —and doesn ’ t waver but believes that what is said will really happen—it will happen .
CEB	Mark	11	24	Therefore I say to you , whatever you pray and ask for , believe that you will receive it , and it will be so for you .
CEB	Mark	11	25	And whenever you stand up to pray , if you have something against anyone , forgive so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your wrongdoings. ” [ d ] Controversy over authority
CEB	Mark	11	27	Jesus and his disciples entered Jerusalem again . As Jesus was walking around the temple , the chief priests , legal experts , and elders came to him .
CEB	Mark	11	28	They asked , “ What kind of authority do you have for doing these things ? Who gave you this authority to do them ? ”
CEB	Mark	11	29	Jesus said to them , “ I have a question for you . Give me an answer , then I ’ ll tell you what kind of authority I have to do these things .
CEB	Mark	11	30	Was John ’ s baptism of heavenly or of human origin ? Answer me. ”
CEB	Mark	11	31	They argued among themselves , “ If we say , ‘ It ’ s of heavenly origin , ’ he ’ ll say , ‘ Then why didn ’ t you believe him ? ’
CEB	Mark	11	32	But we can ’ t say , ‘ It ’ s of earthly origin. ’ ” They said this because they were afraid of the crowd , because they all thought John was a prophet .
CEB	Mark	11	33	They answered Jesus , “ We don ’ t know. ” Jesus replied , “ Neither will I tell you what kind of authority I have to do these things. ” Footnotes - Mark 11:9 Ps 118:26 - Mark 11:17 Isa 56:7 - Mark 11:17 Jer 7:11 - Mark 11:25 11:26 is omitted in most critical editions of the Gk New Testament And if you don ’ t forgive , neither will your Father in heaven forgive you your wrongdoings .
CEB	Mark	12	12	They wanted to arrest Jesus because they knew that he had told the parable against them . But they were afraid of the crowd , so they left him and went away . A question about taxes
CEB	Mark	12	2	When it was time , he sent a servant to collect from the tenants his share of the fruit of the vineyard .
CEB	Mark	12	3	But they grabbed the servant , beat him , and sent him away empty-handed .
CEB	Mark	12	4	Again the landowner sent another servant to them , but they struck him on the head and treated him disgracefully .
CEB	Mark	12	5	He sent another one ; that one they killed . The landlord sent many other servants , but the tenants beat some and killed others .
CEB	Mark	12	6	Now the landowner had one son whom he loved dearly . He sent him last , thinking , They will respect my son .
CEB	Mark	12	7	But those tenant farmers said to each other , ‘ This is the heir . Let ’ s kill him , and the inheritance will be ours. ’
CEB	Mark	12	8	They grabbed him , killed him , and threw him out of the vineyard .
CEB	Mark	12	9	“ So what will the owner of the vineyard do ? He will come and destroy those tenants and give the vineyard to others .
CEB	Mark	12	10	Haven ’ t you read this scripture , The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone .
CEB	Mark	12	11	The Lord has done this , and it ’ s amazing in our eyes ? ” [ a ]
CEB	Mark	12	13	They sent some of the Pharisees and supporters of Herod to trap him in his words .
CEB	Mark	12	14	They came to him and said , “ Teacher , we know that you ’ re genuine and you don ’ t worry about what people think . You don ’ t show favoritism but teach God ’ s way as it really is . Does the Law allow people to pay taxes to Caesar or not ? Should we pay taxes or not ? ”
CEB	Mark	12	15	Since Jesus recognized their deceit , he said to them , “ Why are you testing me ? Bring me a coin . Show it to me. ”
CEB	Mark	12	16	And they brought one . He said to them , “ Whose image and inscription is this ? ” “ Caesar ’ s , ” they replied .
CEB	Mark	12	17	Jesus said to them , “ Give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar and to God what belongs to God. ” His reply left them overcome with wonder . A question about the resurrection
CEB	Mark	12	18	Sadducees , who deny that there is a resurrection , came to Jesus and asked ,
CEB	Mark	12	19	“ Teacher , Moses wrote for us that if a man ’ s brother dies , leaving a widow but no children , the brother must marry the widow and raise up children for his brother . [ b ]
CEB	Mark	12	20	Now there were seven brothers . The first one married a woman ; when he died , he left no children .
CEB	Mark	12	21	The second married her and died without leaving any children . The third did the same .
CEB	Mark	12	22	None of the seven left any children . Finally , the woman died .
CEB	Mark	12	23	At the resurrection , when they all rise up , whose wife will she be ? All seven were married to her. ”
CEB	Mark	12	24	Jesus said to them , “ Isn ’ t this the reason you are wrong , because you don ’ t know either the scriptures or God ’ s power ?
CEB	Mark	12	25	When people rise from the dead , they won ’ t marry nor will they be given in marriage . Instead , they will be like God ’ s angels .
CEB	Mark	12	26	As for the resurrection from the dead , haven ’ t you read in the scroll from Moses , in the passage about the burning bush , how God said to Moses , I am the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ? [ c ]
CEB	Mark	12	27	He isn ’ t the God of the dead but of the living . You are seriously mistaken. ” God ’ s most important command
CEB	Mark	12	28	One of the legal experts heard their dispute and saw how well Jesus answered them . He came over and asked him , “ Which commandment is the most important of all ? ”
CEB	Mark	12	29	Jesus replied , “ The most important one is Israel , listen ! Our God is the one Lord ,
CEB	Mark	12	30	and you must love the Lord your God with all your heart , with all your being , with all your mind , and with all your strength . [ d ]
CEB	Mark	12	31	The second is this , You will love your neighbor as yourself . [ e ] No other commandment is greater than these. ”
CEB	Mark	12	32	The legal expert said to him , “ Well said , Teacher . You have truthfully said that God is one and there is no other besides him .
CEB	Mark	12	33	And to love God with all of the heart , a full understanding , and all of one ’ s strength , and to love one ’ s neighbor as oneself is much more important than all kinds of entirely burned offerings and sacrifices. ”
CEB	Mark	12	34	When Jesus saw that he had answered with wisdom , he said to him , “ You aren ’ t far from God ’ s kingdom. ” After that , no one dared to ask him any more questions . Jesus corrects the legal experts
CEB	Mark	12	35	While Jesus was teaching in the temple , he said , “ Why do the legal experts say that the Christ is David ’ s son ?
CEB	Mark	12	36	David himself , inspired by the Holy Spirit , said , The Lord said to my lord , ‘ Sit at my right side until I turn your enemies into your footstool. ’ [ f ]
CEB	Mark	12	37	David himself calls him ‘ Lord , ’ so how can he be David ’ s son ? ” The large crowd listened to him with delight .
CEB	Mark	12	38	As he was teaching , he said , “ Watch out for the legal experts . They like to walk around in long robes . They want to be greeted with honor in the markets .
CEB	Mark	12	39	They long for places of honor in the synagogues and at banquets .
CEB	Mark	12	40	They are the ones who cheat widows out of their homes , and to show off they say long prayers . They will be judged most harshly. ” A poor widow ’ s contribution
CEB	Mark	12	41	Jesus sat across from the collection box for the temple treasury and observed how the crowd gave their money . Many rich people were throwing in lots of money .
CEB	Mark	12	42	One poor widow came forward and put in two small copper coins worth a penny . [ g ]
CEB	Mark	12	43	Jesus called his disciples to him and said , “ I assure you that this poor widow has put in more than everyone who ’ s been putting money in the treasury .
CEB	Mark	12	44	All of them are giving out of their spare change . But she from her hopeless poverty has given everything she had , even what she needed to live on. ” Footnotes - Mark 12:11 Ps 118:22-23 - Mark 12:19 Deut 25:5 ; Gen 38:8 - Mark 12:26 Exod 3:6 , 15-16 - Mark 12:30 Deut 6:4-5 - Mark 12:31 Lev 19:18 - Mark 12:36 Ps 110:1 - Mark 12:42 Or two lepta ( the smallest Greek copper coin , each worth 1/128 of a single day ’ s pay ) , that is , a kodrantes ( the smallest Roman coin , equal in value to two lepta )
CEB	Mark	13	13	Everyone will hate you because of my name . But whoever stands firm until the end will be saved .
CEB	Mark	13	2	Jesus responded , “ Do you see these enormous buildings ? Not even one stone will be left upon another . All will be demolished. ”
CEB	Mark	13	3	Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives across from the temple . Peter , James , John , and Andrew asked him privately ,
CEB	Mark	13	4	“ Tell us , when will these things happen ? What sign will show that all these things are about to come to an end ? ” Keep watch !
CEB	Mark	13	5	Jesus said , “ Watch out that no one deceives you .
CEB	Mark	13	6	Many people will come in my name , saying , ‘ I ’ m the one ! ’ They will deceive many people .
CEB	Mark	13	7	When you hear of wars and reports of wars , don ’ t be alarmed . These things must happen , but this isn ’ t the end yet .
CEB	Mark	13	8	Nations and kingdoms will fight against each other , and there will be earthquakes and famines in all sorts of places . These things are just the beginning of the sufferings associated with the end .
CEB	Mark	13	9	“ Watch out for yourselves . People will hand you over to the councils . You will be beaten in the synagogues . You will stand before governors and kings because of me so that you can testify before them .
CEB	Mark	13	10	First , the good news must be proclaimed to all the nations .
CEB	Mark	13	11	When they haul you in and hand you over , don ’ t worry ahead of time about what to answer or say . Instead , say whatever is given to you at that moment , for you aren ’ t doing the speaking but the Holy Spirit is .
CEB	Mark	13	12	Brothers and sisters will hand each other over to death . A father will turn in his children . Children will rise up against their parents and have them executed .
CEB	Mark	13	14	“ When you see the disgusting and destructive thing standing where it shouldn ’ t be ( the reader should understand this ) , then those in Judea must escape to the mountains .
CEB	Mark	13	15	Those on the roof shouldn ’ t come down or enter their houses to grab anything .
CEB	Mark	13	16	Those in the field shouldn ’ t come back to grab their clothes .
CEB	Mark	13	17	How terrible it will be at that time for women who are pregnant and for women who are nursing their children .
CEB	Mark	13	18	Pray that it doesn ’ t happen in winter .
CEB	Mark	13	19	In those days there will be great suffering such as the world has never before seen and will never again see .
CEB	Mark	13	20	If the Lord hadn ’ t shortened that time , no one would be rescued . But for the sake of the chosen ones , the ones whom God chose , he has cut short the time .
CEB	Mark	13	21	“ Then if someone says to you , ‘ Look , here ’ s the Christ , ’ or ‘ There he is , ’ don ’ t believe it .
CEB	Mark	13	22	False christs and false prophets will appear , and they will offer signs and wonders in order to deceive , if possible , those whom God has chosen .
CEB	Mark	13	23	But you , watch out ! I ’ ve told you everything ahead of time .
CEB	Mark	13	24	“ In those days , after the suffering of that time , the sun will become dark , and the moon won ’ t give its light .
CEB	Mark	13	25	The stars will fall from the sky , and the planets and other heavenly bodies will be shaken .
CEB	Mark	13	26	Then they will see the Human One [ a ] coming in the clouds with great power and splendor .
CEB	Mark	13	27	Then he will send the angels and gather together his chosen people from the four corners of the earth , from the end of the earth to the end of heaven . A lesson from the fig tree
CEB	Mark	13	28	“ Learn this parable from the fig tree . After its branch becomes tender and it sprouts new leaves , you know that summer is near .
CEB	Mark	13	29	In the same way , when you see these things happening , you know that he ’ s near , at the door .
CEB	Mark	13	30	I assure you that this generation won ’ t pass away until all these things happen .
CEB	Mark	13	31	Heaven and earth will pass away , but my words will certainly not pass away .
CEB	Mark	13	32	“ But nobody knows when that day or hour will come , not the angels in heaven and not the Son . Only the Father knows .
CEB	Mark	13	33	Watch out ! Stay alert ! You don ’ t know when the time is coming .
CEB	Mark	13	34	It is as if someone took a trip , left the household behind , and put the servants in charge , giving each one a job to do , and told the doorkeeper to stay alert .
CEB	Mark	13	35	Therefore , stay alert ! You don ’ t know when the head of the household will come , whether in the evening or at midnight , or when the rooster crows in the early morning or at daybreak .
CEB	Mark	13	36	Don ’ t let him show up when you weren ’ t expecting and find you sleeping .
CEB	Mark	13	37	What I say to you , I say to all : Stay alert ! ” Footnotes - Mark 13:26 Or Son of Man
CEB	Mark	14	14	Wherever he enters , say to the owner of the house , ‘ The teacher asks , “ Where is my guest room where I can eat the Passover meal with my disciples ? ” ’
CEB	Mark	14	2	But they agreed that it shouldn ’ t happen during the festival ; otherwise , there would be an uproar among the people .
CEB	Mark	14	3	Jesus was at Bethany visiting the house of Simon , who had a skin disease . During dinner , a woman came in with a vase made of alabaster and containing very expensive perfume of pure nard . She broke open the vase and poured the perfume on his head .
CEB	Mark	14	4	Some grew angry . They said to each other , “ Why waste the perfume ?
CEB	Mark	14	5	This perfume could have been sold for almost a year ’ s pay [ a ] and the money given to the poor. ” And they scolded her .
CEB	Mark	14	6	Jesus said , “ Leave her alone . Why do you make trouble for her ? She has done a good thing for me .
CEB	Mark	14	7	You always have the poor with you ; and whenever you want , you can do something good for them . But you won ’ t always have me .
CEB	Mark	14	8	She has done what she could . She has anointed my body ahead of time for burial .
CEB	Mark	14	9	I tell you the truth that , wherever in the whole world the good news is announced , what she ’ s done will also be told in memory of her. ” Passover meal
CEB	Mark	14	10	Judas Iscariot , one of the Twelve , went to the chief priests to give Jesus up to them .
CEB	Mark	14	11	When they heard it , they were delighted and promised to give him money . So he started looking for an opportunity to turn him in .
CEB	Mark	14	12	On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread , when the Passover lamb was sacrificed , the disciples said to Jesus , “ Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover meal ? ”
CEB	Mark	14	13	He sent two of his disciples and said to them , “ Go into the city . A man carrying a water jar will meet you . Follow him .
CEB	Mark	14	15	He will show you a large room upstairs already furnished . Prepare for us there. ”
CEB	Mark	14	16	The disciples left , came into the city , found everything just as he had told them , and they prepared the Passover meal .
CEB	Mark	14	17	That evening , Jesus arrived with the Twelve .
CEB	Mark	14	18	During the meal , Jesus said , “ I assure you that one of you will betray me—someone eating with me. ”
CEB	Mark	14	19	Deeply saddened , they asked him , one by one , “ It ’ s not me , is it ? ”
CEB	Mark	14	20	Jesus answered , “ It ’ s one of the Twelve , one who is dipping bread with me into this bowl .
CEB	Mark	14	21	The Human One [ b ] goes to his death just as it is written about him . But how terrible it is for that person who betrays the Human One ! [ c ] It would have been better for him if he had never been born. ”
CEB	Mark	14	22	While they were eating , Jesus took bread , blessed it , broke it , and gave it to them , and said , “ Take ; this is my body. ”
CEB	Mark	14	23	He took a cup , gave thanks , and gave it to them , and they all drank from it .
CEB	Mark	14	24	He said to them , “ This is my blood of the covenant , which is poured out for many .
CEB	Mark	14	25	I assure you that I won ’ t drink wine again until that day when I drink it in a new way in God ’ s kingdom. ”
CEB	Mark	14	26	After singing songs of praise , they went out to the Mount of Olives . Predictions about disciples leaving Jesus
CEB	Mark	14	27	Jesus said to them , “ You will all falter in your faithfulness to me . It is written , I will hit the shepherd , and the sheep will go off in all directions . [ d ]
CEB	Mark	14	28	But after I ’ m raised up , I will go before you to Galilee. ”
CEB	Mark	14	29	Peter said to him , “ Even if everyone else stumbles , I won ’ t. ”
CEB	Mark	14	30	But Jesus said to him , “ I assure you that on this very night , before the rooster crows twice , you will deny me three times. ”
CEB	Mark	14	31	But Peter insisted , “ If I must die alongside you , I won ’ t deny you. ” And they all said the same thing . Jesus in prayer
CEB	Mark	14	32	Jesus and his disciples came to a place called Gethsemane . Jesus said to them , “ Sit here while I pray. ”
CEB	Mark	14	33	He took Peter , James , and John along with him . He began to feel despair and was anxious .
CEB	Mark	14	34	He said to them , “ I ’ m very sad . It ’ s as if I ’ m dying . Stay here and keep alert. ”
CEB	Mark	14	35	Then he went a short distance farther and fell to the ground . He prayed that , if possible , he might be spared the time of suffering .

CEB	Luke	2	44	Supposing that he was among their band of travelers , they journeyed on for a full day while looking for him among their family and friends .
CEB	Luke	2	45	When they didn ’ t find Jesus , they returned to Jerusalem to look for him .
CEB	Luke	2	46	After three days they found him in the temple . He was sitting among the teachers , listening to them and putting questions to them .
CEB	Luke	2	47	Everyone who heard him was amazed by his understanding and his answers .
CEB	Luke	2	48	When his parents saw him , they were shocked . His mother said , “ Child , why have you treated us like this ? Listen ! Your father and I have been worried . We ’ ve been looking for you ! ”
CEB	Luke	2	49	Jesus replied , “ Why were you looking for me ? Didn ’ t you know that it was necessary for me to be in my Father ’ s house ? ”
CEB	Luke	2	50	But they didn ’ t understand what he said to them .
CEB	Luke	2	51	Jesus went down to Nazareth with them and was obedient to them . His mother cherished every word in her heart .
CEB	Luke	2	52	Jesus matured in wisdom and years , and in favor with God and with people .
CEB	Luke	3	3	John went throughout the region of the Jordan River , calling for people to be baptized to show that they were changing their hearts and lives and wanted God to forgive their sins .
CEB	Luke	3	2	during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas—God ’ s word came to John son of Zechariah in the wilderness .
CEB	Luke	3	4	This is just as it was written in the scroll of the words of Isaiah the prophet , A voice crying out in the wilderness : “ Prepare the way for the Lord ; make his paths straight .
CEB	Luke	3	5	Every valley will be filled , and every mountain and hill will be leveled . The crooked will be made straight and the rough places made smooth .
CEB	Luke	3	6	All humanity will see God ’ s salvation. ” [ d ]
CEB	Luke	3	7	Then John said to the crowds who came to be baptized by him , “ You children of snakes ! Who warned you to escape from the angry judgment that is coming soon ?
CEB	Luke	3	8	Produce fruit that shows you have changed your hearts and lives . And don ’ t even think about saying to yourselves , Abraham is our father . I tell you that God is able to raise up Abraham ’ s children from these stones .
CEB	Luke	3	9	The ax is already at the root of the trees . Therefore , every tree that doesn ’ t produce good fruit will be chopped down and tossed into the fire. ”
CEB	Luke	3	10	The crowds asked him , “ What then should we do ? ”
CEB	Luke	3	11	He answered , “ Whoever has two shirts must share with the one who has none , and whoever has food must do the same. ”
CEB	Luke	3	12	Even tax collectors came to be baptized . They said to him , “ Teacher , what should we do ? ”
CEB	Luke	3	13	He replied , “ Collect no more than you are authorized to collect. ”
CEB	Luke	3	14	Soldiers asked , “ What about us ? What should we do ? ” He answered , “ Don ’ t cheat or harass anyone , and be satisfied with your pay. ” Responses to John
CEB	Luke	3	15	The people were filled with expectation , and everyone wondered whether John might be the Christ .
CEB	Luke	3	16	John replied to them all , “ I baptize you with water , but the one who is more powerful than me is coming . I ’ m not worthy to loosen the strap of his sandals . He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire .
CEB	Luke	3	17	The shovel he uses to sift the wheat from the husks is in his hands . He will clean out his threshing area and bring the wheat into his barn . But he will burn the husks with a fire that can ’ t be put out. ”
CEB	Luke	3	18	With many other words John appealed to them , proclaiming good news to the people .
CEB	Luke	3	19	But Herod the ruler had been criticized harshly by John because of Herodias , Herod ’ s brother ’ s wife , and because of all the evil he had done .
CEB	Luke	3	20	He added this to the list of his evil deeds : he locked John up in prison . Jesus ’ baptism
CEB	Luke	3	21	When everyone was being baptized , Jesus also was baptized . While he was praying , heaven was opened
CEB	Luke	3	22	and the Holy Spirit came down on him in bodily form like a dove . And there was a voice from heaven : “ You are my Son , whom I dearly love ; in you I find happiness. ” Jesus ’ genealogy

CEB	Luke	4	4	Jesus replied , “ It ’ s written , People won ’ t live only by bread. ” [ a ]
CEB	Luke	4	2	There he was tempted for forty days by the devil . He ate nothing during those days and afterward Jesus was starving .
CEB	Luke	4	3	The devil said to him , “ Since you are God ’ s Son , command this stone to become a loaf of bread. ”
CEB	Luke	4	5	Next the devil led him to a high place and showed him in a single instant all the kingdoms of the world .
CEB	Luke	4	6	The devil said , “ I will give you this whole domain and the glory of all these kingdoms . It ’ s been entrusted to me and I can give it to anyone I want .
CEB	Luke	4	7	Therefore , if you will worship me , it will all be yours. ”
CEB	Luke	4	8	Jesus answered , “ It ’ s written , You will worship the Lord your God and serve only him. ” [ b ]
CEB	Luke	4	9	The devil brought him into Jerusalem and stood him at the highest point of the temple . He said to him , “ Since you are God ’ s Son , throw yourself down from here ;
CEB	Luke	4	10	for it ’ s written : He will command his angels concerning you , to protect you
CEB	Luke	4	11	and they will take you up in their hands so that you won ’ t hit your foot on a stone . [ c ] ”
CEB	Luke	4	12	Jesus answered , “ It ’ s been said , Don ’ t test the Lord your God. ” [ d ]
CEB	Luke	4	13	After finishing every temptation , the devil departed from him until the next opportunity . Jesus announces good news to the poor
CEB	Luke	4	14	Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit to Galilee , and news about him spread throughout the whole countryside .
CEB	Luke	4	15	He taught in their synagogues and was praised by everyone .
CEB	Luke	4	16	Jesus went to Nazareth , where he had been raised . On the Sabbath he went to the synagogue as he normally did and stood up to read .
CEB	Luke	4	17	The synagogue assistant gave him the scroll from the prophet Isaiah . He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written :
CEB	Luke	4	18	The Spirit of the Lord is upon me , because the Lord has anointed me . He has sent me to preach good news to the poor , to proclaim release to the prisoners and recovery of sight to the blind , to liberate the oppressed ,
CEB	Luke	4	19	and to proclaim the year of the Lord ’ s favor . [ e ]
CEB	Luke	4	20	He rolled up the scroll , gave it back to the synagogue assistant , and sat down . Every eye in the synagogue was fixed on him .
CEB	Luke	4	21	He began to explain to them , “ Today , this scripture has been fulfilled just as you heard it. ”
CEB	Luke	4	22	Everyone was raving about Jesus , so impressed were they by the gracious words flowing from his lips . They said , “ This is Joseph ’ s son , isn ’ t it ? ”
CEB	Luke	4	23	Then Jesus said to them , “ Undoubtedly , you will quote this saying to me : ‘ Doctor , heal yourself . Do here in your hometown what we ’ ve heard you did in Capernaum. ’ ”
CEB	Luke	4	24	He said , “ I assure you that no prophet is welcome in the prophet ’ s hometown .
CEB	Luke	4	25	And I can assure you that there were many widows in Israel during Elijah ’ s time , when it didn ’ t rain for three and a half years and there was a great food shortage in the land .
CEB	Luke	4	26	Yet Elijah was sent to none of them but only to a widow in the city of Zarephath in the region of Sidon .
CEB	Luke	4	27	There were also many persons with skin diseases in Israel during the time of the prophet Elisha , but none of them were cleansed . Instead , Naaman the Syrian was cleansed. ”
CEB	Luke	4	28	When they heard this , everyone in the synagogue was filled with anger .
CEB	Luke	4	29	They rose up and ran him out of town . They led him to the crest of the hill on which their town had been built so that they could throw him off the cliff .
CEB	Luke	4	30	But he passed through the crowd and went on his way . Jesus in Capernaum
CEB	Luke	4	31	Jesus went down to the city of Capernaum in Galilee and taught the people each Sabbath .
CEB	Luke	4	32	They were amazed by his teaching because he delivered his message with authority .
CEB	Luke	4	33	A man in the synagogue had the spirit of an unclean demon . He screamed ,
CEB	Luke	4	34	“ Hey ! What have you to do with us , Jesus of Nazareth ? Have you come to destroy us ? I know who you are . You are the holy one from God. ”
CEB	Luke	4	35	“ Silence ! ” Jesus said , speaking harshly to the demon . “ Come out of him ! ” The demon threw the man down before them , then came out of him without harming him .
CEB	Luke	4	36	They were all shaken and said to each other , “ What kind of word is this , that he can command unclean spirits with authority and power , and they leave ? ”
CEB	Luke	4	37	Reports about him spread everywhere in the surrounding region .
CEB	Luke	4	38	After leaving the synagogue , Jesus went home with Simon . Simon ’ s mother-in-law was sick with a high fever , and the family asked Jesus to help her .
CEB	Luke	4	39	He bent over her and spoke harshly to the fever , and it left her . She got up at once and served them .
CEB	Luke	4	40	When the sun was setting , everyone brought to Jesus relatives and acquaintances with all kinds of diseases . Placing his hands on each of them , he healed them .
CEB	Luke	4	41	Demons also came out of many people . They screamed , “ You are God ’ s Son. ” But he spoke harshly to them and wouldn ’ t allow them to speak because they recognized that he was the Christ .
CEB	Luke	4	42	When daybreak arrived , Jesus went to a deserted place . The crowds were looking for him . When they found him , they tried to keep him from leaving them .
CEB	Luke	4	43	But he said to them , “ I must preach the good news of God ’ s kingdom in other cities too , for this is why I was sent. ”
CEB	Luke	4	44	So he continued preaching in the Judean synagogues .
CEB	Luke	5	5	Simon replied , “ Master , we ’ ve worked hard all night and caught nothing . But because you say so , I ’ ll drop the nets. ”
CEB	Luke	5	2	Jesus saw two boats sitting by the lake . The fishermen had gone ashore and were washing their nets .
CEB	Luke	5	3	Jesus boarded one of the boats , the one that belonged to Simon , then asked him to row out a little distance from the shore . Jesus sat down and taught the crowds from the boat .
CEB	Luke	5	4	When he finished speaking to the crowds , he said to Simon , “ Row out farther , into the deep water , and drop your nets for a catch. ”
CEB	Luke	5	6	So they dropped the nets and their catch was so huge that their nets were splitting .
CEB	Luke	5	7	They signaled for their partners in the other boat to come and help them . They filled both boats so full that they were about to sink .
CEB	Luke	5	8	When Simon Peter saw the catch , he fell at Jesus ’ knees and said , “ Leave me , Lord , for I ’ m a sinner ! ”
CEB	Luke	5	9	Peter and those with him were overcome with amazement because of the number of fish they caught .
CEB	Luke	5	10	James and John , Zebedee ’ s sons , were Simon ’ s partners and they were amazed too . Jesus said to Simon , “ Don ’ t be afraid . From now on , you will be fishing for people. ”
CEB	Luke	5	11	As soon as they brought the boats to the shore , they left everything and followed Jesus . A man with a skin disease
CEB	Luke	5	12	Jesus was in one of the towns where there was also a man covered with a skin disease . When he saw Jesus , he fell on his face and begged , “ Lord , if you want , you can make me clean. ”
CEB	Luke	5	13	Jesus reached out his hand , touched him , and said , “ I do want to . Be clean. ” Instantly , the skin disease left him .
CEB	Luke	5	14	Jesus ordered him not to tell anyone . “ Instead , ” Jesus said , “ go and show yourself to the priest and make an offering for your cleansing , as Moses instructed . This will be a testimony to them. ”
CEB	Luke	5	15	News of him spread even more and huge crowds gathered to listen and to be healed from their illnesses .
CEB	Luke	5	16	But Jesus would withdraw to deserted places for prayer . Jesus heals a paralyzed man
CEB	Luke	5	17	One day when Jesus was teaching , Pharisees and legal experts were sitting nearby . They had come from every village in Galilee and Judea , and from Jerusalem . Now the power of the Lord was with Jesus to heal .
CEB	Luke	5	18	Some men were bringing a man who was paralyzed , lying on a cot . They wanted to carry him in and place him before Jesus ,
CEB	Luke	5	19	but they couldn ’ t reach him because of the crowd . So they took him up on the roof and lowered him—cot and all—through the roof tiles into the crowded room in front of Jesus .
CEB	Luke	5	20	When Jesus saw their faith , he said , “ Friend , your sins are forgiven. ”
CEB	Luke	5	21	The legal experts and Pharisees began to mutter among themselves , “ Who is this who insults God ? Only God can forgive sins ! ”
CEB	Luke	5	22	Jesus recognized what they were discussing and responded , “ Why do you fill your minds with these questions ?
CEB	Luke	5	23	Which is easier—to say , ‘ Your sins are forgiven , ’ or to say , ‘ Get up and walk ’ ?
CEB	Luke	5	24	But so that you will know that the Human One [ a ] has authority on the earth to forgive sins ” —Jesus now spoke to the man who was paralyzed , “ I say to you , get up , take your cot , and go home. ”
CEB	Luke	5	25	Right away , the man stood before them , picked up his cot , and went home , praising God .
CEB	Luke	5	26	All the people were beside themselves with wonder . Filled with awe , they glorified God , saying , “ We ’ ve seen unimaginable things today. ” Jesus calls a tax collector
CEB	Luke	5	27	Afterward , Jesus went out and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at a kiosk for collecting taxes . Jesus said to him , “ Follow me. ”
CEB	Luke	5	28	Levi got up , left everything behind , and followed him .
CEB	Luke	5	29	Then Levi threw a great banquet for Jesus in his home . A large number of tax collectors and others sat down to eat with them .
CEB	Luke	5	30	The Pharisees and their legal experts grumbled against his disciples . They said , “ Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners ? ”
CEB	Luke	5	31	Jesus answered , “ Healthy people don ’ t need a doctor , but sick people do .
CEB	Luke	5	32	I didn ’ t come to call righteous people but sinners to change their hearts and lives. ” The old and the new
CEB	Luke	5	33	Some people said to Jesus , “ The disciples of John fast often and pray frequently . The disciples of the Pharisees do the same , but your disciples are always eating and drinking. ”
CEB	Luke	5	34	Jesus replied , “ You can ’ t make the wedding guests fast while the groom is with them , can you ?
CEB	Luke	5	35	The days will come when the groom will be taken from them , and then they will fast. ”
CEB	Luke	5	36	Then he told them a parable . “ No one tears a patch from a new garment to patch an old garment . Otherwise , the new garment would be ruined , and the new patch wouldn ’ t match the old garment .
CEB	Luke	5	37	Nobody pours new wine into old wineskins . If they did , the new wine would burst the wineskins , the wine would spill , and the wineskins would be ruined .
CEB	Luke	5	38	Instead , new wine must be put into new wineskins .
CEB	Luke	5	39	No one who drinks a well-aged wine wants new wine , but says , ‘ The well-aged wine is better. ’ ” Footnotes - Luke 5:24 Or Son of Man
CEB	Luke	6	6	On another Sabbath , Jesus entered a synagogue to teach . A man was there whose right hand was withered .
CEB	Luke	6	2	Some Pharisees said , “ Why are you breaking the Sabbath law ? ”
CEB	Luke	6	3	Jesus replied , “ Haven ’ t you read what David and his companions did when they were hungry ?
CEB	Luke	6	4	He broke the Law by going into God ’ s house and eating the bread of the presence , which only the priests can eat . He also gave some of the bread to his companions. ”
CEB	Luke	6	5	Then he said to them , “ The Human One [ a ] is Lord of the Sabbath. ”
CEB	Luke	6	7	The legal experts and the Pharisees were watching him closely to see if he would heal on the Sabbath . They were looking for a reason to bring charges against him .
CEB	Luke	6	8	Jesus knew their thoughts , so he said to the man with the withered hand , “ Get up and stand in front of everyone. ” He got up and stood there .
CEB	Luke	6	9	Jesus said to the legal experts and Pharisees , “ Here ’ s a question for you : Is it legal on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil , to save life or to destroy it ? ”
CEB	Luke	6	10	Looking around at them all , he said to the man , “ Stretch out your hand. ” So he did and his hand was made healthy .
CEB	Luke	6	11	They were furious and began talking with each other about what to do to Jesus . Jesus chooses apostles
CEB	Luke	6	12	During that time , Jesus went out to the mountain to pray , and he prayed to God all night long .
CEB	Luke	6	13	At daybreak , he called together his disciples . He chose twelve of them whom he called apostles :
CEB	Luke	6	14	Simon , whom he named Peter ; his brother Andrew ; James ; John ; Philip ; Bartholomew ;
CEB	Luke	6	15	Matthew ; Thomas ; James the son of Alphaeus ; Simon , who was called a zealot ;
CEB	Luke	6	16	Judas the son of James ; and Judas Iscariot , who became a traitor . Jesus ’ popularity increases
CEB	Luke	6	17	Jesus came down from the mountain with them and stood on a large area of level ground . A great company of his disciples and a huge crowd of people from all around Judea and Jerusalem and the area around Tyre and Sidon joined him there .
CEB	Luke	6	18	They came to hear him and to be healed from their diseases , and those bothered by unclean spirits were healed .
CEB	Luke	6	19	The whole crowd wanted to touch him , because power was going out from him and he was healing everyone . Happy people and doomed people
CEB	Luke	6	20	Jesus raised his eyes to his disciples and said : “ Happy are you who are poor , because God ’ s kingdom is yours .
CEB	Luke	6	21	Happy are you who hunger now , because you will be satisfied . Happy are you who weep now , because you will laugh .
CEB	Luke	6	22	Happy are you when people hate you , reject you , insult you , and condemn your name as evil because of the Human One . [ b ]
CEB	Luke	6	23	Rejoice when that happens ! Leap for joy because you have a great reward in heaven . Their ancestors did the same things to the prophets .
CEB	Luke	6	24	But how terrible for you who are rich , because you have already received your comfort .
CEB	Luke	6	25	How terrible for you who have plenty now , because you will be hungry . How terrible for you who laugh now , because you will mourn and weep .
CEB	Luke	6	26	How terrible for you when all speak well of you . Their ancestors did the same things to the false prophets . Behaving as God ’ s children
CEB	Luke	6	27	“ But I say to you who are willing to hear : Love your enemies . Do good to those who hate you .
CEB	Luke	6	28	Bless those who curse you . Pray for those who mistreat you .
CEB	Luke	6	29	If someone slaps you on the cheek , offer the other one as well . If someone takes your coat , don ’ t withhold your shirt either .
CEB	Luke	6	30	Give to everyone who asks and don ’ t demand your things back from those who take them .
CEB	Luke	6	31	Treat people in the same way that you want them to treat you .
CEB	Luke	6	32	“ If you love those who love you , why should you be commended ? Even sinners love those who love them .
CEB	Luke	6	33	If you do good to those who do good to you , why should you be commended ? Even sinners do that .
CEB	Luke	6	34	If you lend to those from whom you expect repayment , why should you be commended ? Even sinners lend to sinners expecting to be paid back in full .
CEB	Luke	6	35	Instead , love your enemies , do good , and lend expecting nothing in return . If you do , you will have a great reward . You will be acting the way children of the Most High act , for he is kind to ungrateful and wicked people .
CEB	Luke	6	36	Be compassionate just as your Father is compassionate .
CEB	Luke	6	37	“ Don ’ t judge , and you won ’ t be judged . Don ’ t condemn , and you won ’ t be condemned . Forgive , and you will be forgiven .
CEB	Luke	6	38	Give , and it will be given to you . A good portion—packed down , firmly shaken , and overflowing—will fall into your lap . The portion you give will determine the portion you receive in return. ” Avoiding self-deception
CEB	Luke	6	39	Jesus also told them a riddle . “ A blind person can ’ t lead another blind person , right ? Won ’ t they both fall into a ditch ?
CEB	Luke	6	40	Disciples aren ’ t greater than their teacher , but whoever is fully prepared will be like their teacher .
CEB	Luke	6	41	Why do you see the splinter in your brother ’ s or sister ’ s eye but don ’ t notice the log in your own eye ?
CEB	Luke	6	42	How can you say to your brother or sister , ‘ Brother , Sister , let me take the splinter out of your eye , ’ when you don ’ t see the log in your own eye ? You deceive yourselves ! First take the log out of your eye , and then you will see clearly to take the splinter out of your brother ’ s or sister ’ s eye .
CEB	Luke	6	43	“ A good tree doesn ’ t produce bad fruit , nor does a bad tree produce good fruit .
CEB	Luke	6	44	Each tree is known by its own fruit . People don ’ t gather figs from thorny plants , nor do they pick grapes from prickly bushes .
CEB	Luke	6	45	A good person produces good from the good treasury of the inner self , while an evil person produces evil from the evil treasury of the inner self . The inner self overflows with words that are spoken .
CEB	Luke	6	46	“ Why do you call me ‘ Lord , Lord ’ and don ’ t do what I say ?
CEB	Luke	6	47	I ’ ll show what it ’ s like when someone comes to me , hears my words , and puts them into practice .
CEB	Luke	6	48	It ’ s like a person building a house by digging deep and laying the foundation on bedrock . When the flood came , the rising water smashed against that house , but the water couldn ’ t shake the house because it was well built .
CEB	Luke	6	49	But those who don ’ t put into practice what they hear are like a person who built a house without a foundation . The floodwater smashed against it and it collapsed instantly . It was completely destroyed . ”
CEB	Luke	7	7	In fact , I didn ’ t even consider myself worthy to come to you . Just say the word and my servant will be healed .
CEB	Luke	7	2	A centurion had a servant who was very important to him , but the servant was ill and about to die .
CEB	Luke	7	3	When the centurion heard about Jesus , he sent some Jewish elders to Jesus to ask him to come and heal his servant .
CEB	Luke	7	4	When they came to Jesus , they earnestly pleaded with Jesus . “ He deserves to have you do this for him , ” they said .
CEB	Luke	7	5	“ He loves our people and he built our synagogue for us. ”
CEB	Luke	7	6	Jesus went with them . He had almost reached the house when the centurion sent friends to say to Jesus , “ Lord , don ’ t be bothered . I don ’ t deserve to have you come under my roof .
CEB	Luke	7	8	I ’ m also a man appointed under authority , with soldiers under me . I say to one , ‘ Go , ’ and he goes , and to another , ‘ Come , ’ and he comes . I say to my servant , ‘ Do this , ’ and the servant does it. ”
CEB	Luke	7	9	When Jesus heard these words , he was impressed with the centurion . He turned to the crowd following him and said , “ I tell you , even in Israel I haven ’ t found faith like this. ”
CEB	Luke	7	10	When the centurion ’ s friends returned to his house , they found the servant restored to health . Jesus raises a widow ’ s son
CEB	Luke	7	11	A little later Jesus went to a city called Nain . His disciples and a great crowd traveled with him .
CEB	Luke	7	12	As he approached the city gate , a dead man was being carried out . He was his mother ’ s only son , and she was a widow . A large crowd from the city was with her .
CEB	Luke	7	13	When he saw her , the Lord had compassion for her and said , “ Don ’ t cry. ”
CEB	Luke	7	14	He stepped forward and touched the stretcher on which the dead man was being carried . Those carrying him stood still . Jesus said , “ Young man , I say to you , get up. ”
CEB	Luke	7	15	The dead man sat up and began to speak , and Jesus gave him to his mother .
CEB	Luke	7	16	Awestruck , everyone praised God . “ A great prophet has appeared among us , ” they said . “ God has come to help his people. ”
CEB	Luke	7	17	This news about Jesus spread throughout Judea and the surrounding region . John the Baptist and Jesus
CEB	Luke	7	18	John ’ s disciples informed him about all these things . John called two of his disciples
CEB	Luke	7	19	and sent them to the Lord . They were to ask him , “ Are you the one who is coming , or should we look for someone else ? ”
CEB	Luke	7	20	When they reached Jesus , they said , “ John the Baptist sent us to you . He asks , ‘ Are you the one who is coming , or should we look for someone else ? ’ ”
CEB	Luke	7	21	Right then , Jesus healed many of their diseases , illnesses , and evil spirits , and he gave sight to a number of blind people .
CEB	Luke	7	22	Then he replied to John ’ s disciples , “ Go , report to John what you have seen and heard . Those who were blind are able to see . Those who were crippled now walk . People with skin diseases are cleansed . Those who were deaf now hear . Those who were dead are raised up . And good news is preached to the poor . [ a ]
CEB	Luke	7	23	Happy is anyone who doesn ’ t stumble along the way because of me. ”
CEB	Luke	7	24	After John ’ s messengers were gone , Jesus spoke to the crowds about John . “ What did you go out into the wilderness to see ? A stalk blowing in the wind ?
CEB	Luke	7	25	What did you go out to see ? A man dressed up in refined clothes ? Look , those who dress in fashionable clothes and live in luxury are in royal palaces .
CEB	Luke	7	26	What did you go out to see ? A prophet ? Yes , I tell you , and more than a prophet .
CEB	Luke	7	27	He is the one of whom it ’ s written : Look , I ’ m sending my messenger before you , who will prepare your way before you . [ b ]
CEB	Luke	7	28	I tell you that no greater human being has ever been born than John . Yet whoever is least in God ’ s kingdom is greater than he. ”
CEB	Luke	7	29	Everyone who heard this , including the tax collectors , acknowledged God ’ s justice because they had been baptized by John .
CEB	Luke	7	30	But the Pharisees and legal experts rejected God ’ s will for themselves because they hadn ’ t been baptized by John .
CEB	Luke	7	31	“ To what will I compare the people of this generation ? ” Jesus asked . “ What are they like ?
CEB	Luke	7	32	They are like children sitting in the marketplace calling out to each other , ‘ We played the flute for you and you didn ’ t dance . We sang a funeral song and you didn ’ t cry. ’
CEB	Luke	7	33	John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine , and you say , ‘ He has a demon. ’
CEB	Luke	7	34	Yet the Human One [ c ] came eating and drinking , and you say , ‘ Look , a glutton and a drunk , a friend of tax collectors and sinners. ’
CEB	Luke	7	35	But wisdom is proved to be right by all her descendants. ” Forgiveness and gratitude
CEB	Luke	7	36	One of the Pharisees invited Jesus to eat with him . After he entered the Pharisee ’ s home , he took his place at the table .
CEB	Luke	7	37	Meanwhile , a woman from the city , a sinner , discovered that Jesus was dining in the Pharisee ’ s house . She brought perfumed oil in a vase made of alabaster .
CEB	Luke	7	38	Standing behind him at his feet and crying , she began to wet his feet with her tears . She wiped them with her hair , kissed them , and poured the oil on them .
CEB	Luke	7	39	When the Pharisee who had invited Jesus saw what was happening , he said to himself , If this man were a prophet , he would know what kind of woman is touching him . He would know that she is a sinner .
CEB	Luke	7	40	Jesus replied , “ Simon , I have something to say to you. ” “ Teacher , speak , ” he said .
CEB	Luke	7	41	“ A certain lender had two debtors . One owed enough money to pay five hundred people for a day ’ s work . [ d ] The other owed enough money for fifty .
CEB	Luke	7	42	When they couldn ’ t pay , the lender forgave the debts of them both . Which of them will love him more ? ”
CEB	Luke	7	43	Simon replied , “ I suppose the one who had the largest debt canceled. ” Jesus said , “ You have judged correctly. ”
CEB	Luke	7	44	Jesus turned to the woman and said to Simon , “ Do you see this woman ? When I entered your home , you didn ’ t give me water for my feet , but she wet my feet with tears and wiped them with her hair .
CEB	Luke	7	45	You didn ’ t greet me with a kiss , but she hasn ’ t stopped kissing my feet since I came in .
CEB	Luke	7	46	You didn ’ t anoint my head with oil , but she has poured perfumed oil on my feet .
CEB	Luke	7	47	This is why I tell you that her many sins have been forgiven ; so she has shown great love . The one who is forgiven little loves little. ”
CEB	Luke	7	48	Then Jesus said to her , “ Your sins are forgiven. ”
CEB	Luke	7	49	The other table guests began to say among themselves , “ Who is this person that even forgives sins ? ”
CEB	Luke	7	50	Jesus said to the woman , “ Your faith has saved you . Go in peace . ”
CEB	Luke	8	8	Still other seed landed on good soil . When it grew , it produced one hundred times more grain than was scattered. ” As he said this , he called out , “ Everyone who has ears should pay attention. ”
CEB	Luke	8	2	along with some women who had been healed of evil spirits and sicknesses . Among them were Mary Magdalene ( from whom seven demons had been thrown out ) ,
CEB	Luke	8	3	Joanna ( the wife of Herod ’ s servant Chuza ) , Susanna , and many others who provided for them out of their resources . Parable of the soils
CEB	Luke	8	4	When a great crowd was gathering and people were coming to Jesus from one city after another , he spoke to them in a parable :
CEB	Luke	8	5	“ A farmer went out to scatter his seed . As he was scattering it , some fell on the path where it was crushed , and the birds in the sky came and ate it .
CEB	Luke	8	6	Other seed fell on rock . As it grew , it dried up because it had no moisture .
CEB	Luke	8	7	Other seed fell among thorny plants . The thorns grew with the plants and choked them .
CEB	Luke	8	9	His disciples asked him what this parable meant .
CEB	Luke	8	10	He said , “ You have been given the mysteries of God ’ s kingdom , but these mysteries come to everyone else in parables so that when they see , they can ’ t see , and when they hear , they can ’ t understand . [ a ]
CEB	Luke	8	11	“ The parable means this : The seed is God ’ s word .
CEB	Luke	8	12	The seed on the path are those who hear , but then the devil comes and steals the word from their hearts so that they won ’ t believe and be saved .
CEB	Luke	8	13	The seed on the rock are those who receive the word joyfully when they hear it , but they have no root . They believe for a while but fall away when they are tempted .
CEB	Luke	8	14	As for the seed that fell among thorny plants , these are the ones who , as they go about their lives , are choked by the concerns , riches , and pleasures of life , and their fruit never matures .
CEB	Luke	8	15	The seed that fell on good soil are those who hear the word and commit themselves to it with a good and upright heart . Through their resolve , they bear fruit . Sharing the light
CEB	Luke	8	16	“ No one lights a lamp and then covers it with a bowl or puts it under a bed . Instead , they put it on top of a lampstand so that those who enter can see the light .
CEB	Luke	8	17	Nothing is hidden that won ’ t be exposed . Nor is anything concealed that won ’ t be made known and brought to the light .
CEB	Luke	8	18	Therefore , listen carefully . Those who have will receive more , but as for those who don ’ t have , even what they seem to have will be taken away from them. ” Jesus ’ family
CEB	Luke	8	19	Jesus ’ mother and brothers came to him but were unable to reach him because of the crowd .
CEB	Luke	8	20	Someone told him , “ Your mother and brothers are standing outside , wanting to see you. ”
CEB	Luke	8	21	He replied , “ My mother and brothers are those who listen to God ’ s word and do it. ” Jesus calms the sea
CEB	Luke	8	22	One day Jesus and his disciples boarded a boat . He said to them , “ Let ’ s cross over to the other side of the lake. ” So they set sail .
CEB	Luke	8	23	While they were sailing , he fell asleep . Gale-force winds swept down on the lake . The boat was filling up with water and they were in danger .
CEB	Luke	8	24	So they went and woke Jesus , shouting , “ Master , Master , we ’ re going to drown ! ” But he got up and gave orders to the wind and the violent waves . The storm died down and it was calm .
CEB	Luke	8	25	He said to his disciples , “ Where is your faith ? ” Filled with awe and wonder , they said to each other , “ Who is this ? He commands even the winds and the water , and they obey him ! ” Jesus frees a demon-possessed man
CEB	Luke	8	26	Jesus and his disciples sailed to the Gerasenes ’ land , which is across the lake from Galilee .
CEB	Luke	8	27	As soon as Jesus got out of the boat , a certain man met him . The man was from the city and was possessed by demons . For a long time , he had lived among the tombs , naked and homeless .
CEB	Luke	8	28	When he saw Jesus , he shrieked and fell down before him . Then he shouted , “ What have you to do with me , Jesus , Son of the Most High God ? I beg you , don ’ t torture me ! ”
CEB	Luke	8	29	He said this because Jesus had already commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man . Many times it had taken possession of him , so he would be bound with leg irons and chains and placed under guard . But he would break his restraints , and the demon would force him into the wilderness .
CEB	Luke	8	30	Jesus asked him , “ What is your name ? ” “ Legion , ” he replied , because many demons had entered him .
CEB	Luke	8	31	They pleaded with him not to order them to go back into the abyss . [ b ]
CEB	Luke	8	32	A large herd of pigs was feeding on the hillside . The demons begged Jesus to let them go into the pigs . Jesus gave them permission ,
CEB	Luke	8	33	and the demons left the man and entered the pigs . The herd rushed down the cliff into the lake and drowned .
CEB	Luke	8	34	When those who tended the pigs saw what happened , they ran away and told the story in the city and in the countryside .
CEB	Luke	8	35	People came to see what had happened . They came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had gone . He was sitting at Jesus ’ feet , fully dressed and completely sane . They were filled with awe .
CEB	Luke	8	36	Those people who had actually seen what had happened told them how the demon-possessed man had been delivered .
CEB	Luke	8	37	Then everyone gathered from the region of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave their area because they were overcome with fear . So he got into the boat and returned across the lake .
CEB	Luke	8	38	The man from whom the demons had gone begged to come along with Jesus as one of his disciples . Jesus sent him away , saying ,
CEB	Luke	8	39	“ Return home and tell the story of what God has done for you. ” So he went throughout the city proclaiming what Jesus had done for him . Jesus heals two women
CEB	Luke	8	40	When Jesus returned , the crowd welcomed him , for they had been waiting for him .
CEB	Luke	8	41	A man named Jairus , who was a synagogue leader , came and fell at Jesus ’ feet . He pleaded with Jesus to come to his house
CEB	Luke	8	42	because his only daughter , a twelve-year-old , was dying . As Jesus moved forward , he faced smothering crowds .
CEB	Luke	8	43	A woman was there who had been bleeding for twelve years . She had spent her entire livelihood on doctors , but no one could heal her .
CEB	Luke	8	44	She came up behind him and touched the hem of his clothes , and at once her bleeding stopped .
CEB	Luke	8	45	“ Who touched me ? ” Jesus asked . When everyone denied it , Peter said , “ Master , the crowds are surrounding you and pressing in on you ! ”
CEB	Luke	8	46	But Jesus said , “ Someone touched me . I know that power has gone out from me. ”
CEB	Luke	8	47	When the woman saw that she couldn ’ t escape notice , she came trembling and fell before Jesus . In front of everyone , she explained why she had touched him and how she had been immediately healed .
CEB	Luke	8	48	“ Daughter , your faith has healed you , ” Jesus said . “ Go in peace. ”
CEB	Luke	8	49	While Jesus was still speaking , someone came from the synagogue leader ’ s house , saying to Jairus , “ Your daughter has died . Don ’ t bother the teacher any longer. ”
CEB	Luke	8	50	When Jesus heard this , he responded , “ Don ’ t be afraid ; just keep trusting , and she will be healed. ”
CEB	Luke	8	51	When he came to the house , he didn ’ t allow anyone to enter with him except Peter , John , and James , and the child ’ s father and mother .
CEB	Luke	8	52	They were all crying and mourning for her , but Jesus said , “ Don ’ t cry . She isn ’ t dead . She ’ s only sleeping. ”
CEB	Luke	8	53	They laughed at him because they knew she was dead .
CEB	Luke	8	54	Taking her hand , Jesus called out , “ Child , get up. ”
CEB	Luke	8	55	Her life returned and she got up at once . He directed them to give her something to eat .
CEB	Luke	8	56	Her parents were beside themselves with joy , but he ordered them to tell no one what had happened .
CEB	Luke	9	9	Herod said , “ I beheaded John , so now who am I hearing about ? ” Herod wanted to see him . Jesus feeds the five thousand
CEB	Luke	9	2	He sent them out to proclaim God ’ s kingdom and to heal the sick .
CEB	Luke	9	3	He told them , “ Take nothing for the journey—no walking stick , no bag , no bread , no money , not even an extra shirt .
CEB	Luke	9	4	Whatever house you enter , remain there until you leave that place .
CEB	Luke	9	5	Wherever they don ’ t welcome you , as you leave that city , shake the dust off your feet as a witness against them. ”
CEB	Luke	9	6	They departed and went through the villages proclaiming the good news and healing people everywhere . Herod ’ s confusion
CEB	Luke	9	7	Herod the ruler [ a ] heard about everything that was happening . He was confused because some people were saying that John had been raised from the dead ,
CEB	Luke	9	8	others that Elijah had appeared , and still others that one of the ancient prophets had come back to life .
CEB	Luke	9	10	When the apostles returned , they described for Jesus what they had done . Taking them with him , Jesus withdrew privately to a city called Bethsaida .
CEB	Luke	9	11	When the crowds figured it out , they followed him . He welcomed them , spoke to them about God ’ s kingdom , and healed those who were sick .
CEB	Luke	9	12	When the day was almost over , the Twelve came to him and said , “ Send the crowd away so that they can go to the nearby villages and countryside and find lodging and food , because we are in a deserted place. ”
CEB	Luke	9	13	He replied , “ You give them something to eat. ” But they said , “ We have no more than five loaves of bread and two fish—unless we go and buy food for all these people. ”
CEB	Luke	9	14	( They said this because about five thousand men were present . ) Jesus said to his disciples , “ Seat them in groups of about fifty. ”
CEB	Luke	9	15	They did so , and everyone was seated .
CEB	Luke	9	16	He took the five loaves and the two fish , looked up to heaven , blessed them , and broke them and gave them to the disciples to set before the crowd .
CEB	Luke	9	17	Everyone ate until they were full , and the disciples filled twelve baskets with the leftovers . Following Christ
CEB	Luke	9	18	Once when Jesus was praying by himself , the disciples joined him , and he asked them , “ Who do the crowds say that I am ? ”
CEB	Luke	9	19	They answered , “ John the Baptist , others Elijah , and still others that one of the ancient prophets has come back to life. ”
CEB	Luke	9	20	He asked them , “ And what about you ? Who do you say that I am ? ” Peter answered , “ The Christ sent from God. ”
CEB	Luke	9	21	Jesus gave them strict orders not to tell this to anyone .
CEB	Luke	9	22	He said , “ The Human One [ b ] must suffer many things and be rejected—by the elders , chief priests , and the legal experts—and be killed and be raised on the third day. ”
CEB	Luke	9	23	Jesus said to everyone , “ All who want to come after me must say no to themselves , take up their cross daily , and follow me .
CEB	Luke	9	24	All who want to save their lives will lose them . But all who lose their lives because of me will save them .
CEB	Luke	9	25	What advantage do people have if they gain the whole world for themselves yet perish or lose their lives ?
CEB	Luke	9	26	Whoever is ashamed of me and my words , the Human One [ c ] will be ashamed of that person when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels .
CEB	Luke	9	27	I assure you that some standing here won ’ t die before they see God ’ s kingdom. ” Jesus transformed
CEB	Luke	9	28	About eight days after Jesus said these things , he took Peter , John , and James , and went up on a mountain to pray .
CEB	Luke	9	29	As he was praying , the appearance of his face changed and his clothes flashed white like lightning .
CEB	Luke	9	30	Two men , Moses and Elijah , were talking with him .
CEB	Luke	9	31	They were clothed with heavenly splendor and spoke about Jesus ’ departure , which he would achieve in Jerusalem .
CEB	Luke	9	32	Peter and those with him were almost overcome by sleep , but they managed to stay awake and saw his glory as well as the two men with him .
CEB	Luke	9	33	As the two men were about to leave Jesus , Peter said to him , “ Master , it ’ s good that we ’ re here . We should construct three shrines : one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah ” —but he didn ’ t know what he was saying .
CEB	Luke	9	34	Peter was still speaking when a cloud overshadowed them . As they entered the cloud , they were overcome with awe .
CEB	Luke	9	35	Then a voice from the cloud said , “ This is my Son , my chosen one . Listen to him ! ”
CEB	Luke	9	36	Even as the voice spoke , Jesus was found alone . They were speechless and at the time told no one what they had seen . Jesus heals a boy
CEB	Luke	9	37	The next day , when Jesus , Peter , John , and James had come down from the mountain , a large crowd met Jesus .
CEB	Luke	9	38	A man from the crowd shouted , “ Teacher , I beg you to take a look at my son , my only child .
CEB	Luke	9	39	Look , a spirit seizes him and , without any warning , he screams . It shakes him and causes him to foam at the mouth . It tortures him and rarely leaves him alone .
CEB	Luke	9	40	I begged your disciples to throw it out , but they couldn ’ t. ”
CEB	Luke	9	41	Jesus answered , “ You faithless and crooked generation , how long will I be with you and put up with you ? Bring your son here. ”
CEB	Luke	9	42	While he was coming , the demon threw him down and shook him violently . Jesus spoke harshly to the unclean spirit , healed the child , and gave him back to his father .
CEB	Luke	9	43	Everyone was overwhelmed by God ’ s greatness . Jesus warns about his arrest While everyone was marveling at everything he was doing , Jesus said to his disciples ,
CEB	Luke	9	44	“ Take these words to heart : the Human One [ d ] is about to be delivered into human hands. ”
CEB	Luke	9	45	They didn ’ t understand this statement . Its meaning was hidden from them so they couldn ’ t grasp it . And they were afraid to ask him about it . Jesus corrects the disciples
CEB	Luke	9	46	An argument arose among the disciples about which of them was the greatest .
CEB	Luke	9	47	Aware of their deepest thoughts , Jesus took a little child and had the child stand beside him .
CEB	Luke	9	48	Jesus said to his disciples , “ Whoever welcomes this child in my name welcomes me . Whoever welcomes me , welcomes the one who sent me . Whoever is least among you all is the greatest. ”
CEB	Luke	9	49	John replied , “ Master , we saw someone throwing demons out in your name , and we tried to stop him because he isn ’ t in our group of followers. ”
CEB	Luke	9	50	But Jesus replied , “ Don ’ t stop him , because whoever isn ’ t against you is for you. ” Jesus sets out for Jerusalem
CEB	Luke	9	51	As the time approached when Jesus was to be taken up into heaven , he determined to go to Jerusalem .
CEB	Luke	9	52	He sent messengers on ahead of him . Along the way , they entered a Samaritan village to prepare for his arrival ,
CEB	Luke	9	53	but the Samaritan villagers refused to welcome him because he was determined to go to Jerusalem .
CEB	Luke	9	54	When the disciples James and John saw this , they said , “ Lord , do you want us to call fire down from heaven to consume them ? ”
CEB	Luke	9	55	But Jesus turned and spoke sternly to them ,
CEB	Luke	9	56	and they went on to another village . Following Jesus
CEB	Luke	9	57	As Jesus and his disciples traveled along the road , someone said to him , “ I will follow you wherever you go. ”
CEB	Luke	9	58	Jesus replied , “ Foxes have dens and the birds in the sky have nests , but the Human One [ e ] has no place to lay his head. ”
CEB	Luke	9	59	Then Jesus said to someone else , “ Follow me. ” He replied , “ Lord , first let me go and bury my father. ”
CEB	Luke	9	60	Jesus said to him , “ Let the dead bury their own dead . But you go and spread the news of God ’ s kingdom. ”
CEB	Luke	9	61	Someone else said to Jesus , “ I will follow you , Lord , but first let me say good-bye to those in my house. ”
CEB	Luke	9	62	Jesus said to him , “ No one who puts a hand on the plow and looks back is fit for God ’ s kingdom . ”
CEB	Luke	10	10	Whenever you enter a city and the people don ’ t welcome you , go out into the streets and say ,
CEB	Luke	10	2	He said to them , “ The harvest is bigger than you can imagine , but there are few workers . Therefore , plead with the Lord of the harvest to send out workers for his harvest .
CEB	Luke	10	3	Go ! Be warned , though , that I ’ m sending you out as lambs among wolves .
CEB	Luke	10	4	Carry no wallet , no bag , and no sandals . Don ’ t even greet anyone along the way .
CEB	Luke	10	5	Whenever you enter a house , first say , ‘ May peace be on this house. ’
CEB	Luke	10	6	If anyone there shares God ’ s peace , then your peace will rest on that person . If not , your blessing will return to you .
CEB	Luke	10	7	Remain in this house , eating and drinking whatever they set before you , for workers deserve their pay . Don ’ t move from house to house .
CEB	Luke	10	8	Whenever you enter a city and its people welcome you , eat what they set before you .
CEB	Luke	10	9	Heal the sick who are there , and say to them , ‘ God ’ s kingdom has come upon you. ’
CEB	Luke	10	11	‘ As a complaint against you , we brush off the dust of your city that has collected on our feet . But know this : God ’ s kingdom has come to you. ’
CEB	Luke	10	12	I assure you that Sodom will be better off on Judgment Day than that city . Judgment against cities that reject Jesus
CEB	Luke	10	13	“ How terrible it will be for you , Chorazin . How terrible it will be for you , Bethsaida . If the miracles done among you had been done in Tyre and Sidon , they would have changed their hearts and lives long ago . They would have sat around in funeral clothes and ashes .
CEB	Luke	10	14	But Tyre and Sidon will be better off at the judgment than you .
CEB	Luke	10	15	And you , Capernaum , will you be honored by being raised up to heaven ? No , you will be cast down to the place of the dead .
CEB	Luke	10	16	Whoever listens to you listens to me . Whoever rejects you rejects me . Whoever rejects me rejects the one who sent me. ” The seventy-two return
CEB	Luke	10	17	The seventy-two returned joyously , saying , “ Lord , even the demons submit themselves to us in your name. ”
CEB	Luke	10	18	Jesus replied , “ I saw Satan fall from heaven like lightning .
CEB	Luke	10	19	Look , I have given you authority to crush snakes and scorpions underfoot . I have given you authority over all the power of the enemy . Nothing will harm you .
CEB	Luke	10	20	Nevertheless , don ’ t rejoice because the spirits submit to you . Rejoice instead that your names are written in heaven. ”
CEB	Luke	10	21	At that very moment , Jesus overflowed with joy from the Holy Spirit and said , “ I praise you , Father , Lord of heaven and earth , because you ’ ve hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and shown them to babies . Indeed , Father , this brings you happiness .
CEB	Luke	10	22	My Father has handed all things over to me . No one knows who the Son is except the Father , or who the Father is except the Son and anyone to whom the Son wants to reveal him. ”
CEB	Luke	10	23	Turning to the disciples , he said privately , “ Happy are the eyes that see what you see .
CEB	Luke	10	24	I assure you that many prophets and kings wanted to see what you see and hear what you hear , but they didn ’ t. ” Loving your neighbor
CEB	Luke	10	25	A legal expert stood up to test Jesus . “ Teacher , ” he said , “ what must I do to gain eternal life ? ”
CEB	Luke	10	26	Jesus replied , “ What is written in the Law ? How do you interpret it ? ”
CEB	Luke	10	27	He responded , “ You must love the Lord your God with all your heart , with all your being , with all your strength , and with all your mind , and love your neighbor as yourself. ” [ a ]
CEB	Luke	10	28	Jesus said to him , “ You have answered correctly . Do this and you will live. ”
CEB	Luke	10	29	But the legal expert wanted to prove that he was right , so he said to Jesus , “ And who is my neighbor ? ”
CEB	Luke	10	30	Jesus replied , “ A man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho . He encountered thieves , who stripped him naked , beat him up , and left him near death .
CEB	Luke	10	31	Now it just so happened that a priest was also going down the same road . When he saw the injured man , he crossed over to the other side of the road and went on his way .
CEB	Luke	10	32	Likewise , a Levite came by that spot , saw the injured man , and crossed over to the other side of the road and went on his way .
CEB	Luke	10	33	A Samaritan , who was on a journey , came to where the man was . But when he saw him , he was moved with compassion .
CEB	Luke	10	34	The Samaritan went to him and bandaged his wounds , tending them with oil and wine . Then he placed the wounded man on his own donkey , took him to an inn , and took care of him .
CEB	Luke	10	35	The next day , he took two full days ’ worth of wages and gave them to the innkeeper . He said , ‘ Take care of him , and when I return , I will pay you back for any additional costs. ’
CEB	Luke	10	36	What do you think ? Which one of these three was a neighbor to the man who encountered thieves ? ”
CEB	Luke	10	37	Then the legal expert said , “ The one who demonstrated mercy toward him. ” Jesus told him , “ Go and do likewise. ” Jesus visits Martha and Mary
CEB	Luke	10	38	While Jesus and his disciples were traveling , Jesus entered a village where a woman named Martha welcomed him as a guest .
CEB	Luke	10	39	She had a sister named Mary , who sat at the Lord ’ s feet and listened to his message .
CEB	Luke	10	40	By contrast , Martha was preoccupied with getting everything ready for their meal . So Martha came to him and said , “ Lord , don ’ t you care that my sister has left me to prepare the table all by myself ? Tell her to help me. ”
CEB	Luke	10	41	The Lord answered , “ Martha , Martha , you are worried and distracted by many things .
CEB	Luke	10	42	One thing is necessary . Mary has chosen the better part . It won ’ t be taken away from her . ”
CEB	Luke	11	11	“ Which father among you would give a snake to your child if the child asked for a fish ?
CEB	Luke	11	2	Jesus told them , “ When you pray , say : ‘ Father , uphold the holiness of your name . Bring in your kingdom .
CEB	Luke	11	3	Give us the bread we need for today .
CEB	Luke	11	4	Forgive us our sins , for we also forgive everyone who has wronged us . And don ’ t lead us into temptation. ’ ”
CEB	Luke	11	5	He also said to them , “ Imagine that one of you has a friend and you go to that friend in the middle of the night . Imagine saying , ‘ Friend , loan me three loaves of bread
CEB	Luke	11	6	because a friend of mine on a journey has arrived and I have nothing to set before him. ’
CEB	Luke	11	7	Imagine further that he answers from within the house , ‘ Don ’ t bother me . The door is already locked , and my children and I are in bed . I can ’ t get up to give you anything. ’
CEB	Luke	11	8	I assure you , even if he wouldn ’ t get up and help because of his friendship , he will get up and give his friend whatever he needs because of his friend ’ s brashness .
CEB	Luke	11	9	And I tell you : Ask and you will receive . Seek and you will find . Knock and the door will be opened to you .
CEB	Luke	11	10	Everyone who asks , receives . Whoever seeks , finds . To everyone who knocks , the door is opened .
CEB	Luke	11	12	If a child asked for an egg , what father would give the child a scorpion ?
CEB	Luke	11	13	If you who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children , how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him ? ” Controversy over Beelzebul
CEB	Luke	11	14	Jesus was throwing out a demon that causes muteness . When the demon was gone , the man who couldn ’ t speak began to talk . The crowds were amazed .
CEB	Luke	11	15	But some of them said , “ He throws out demons with the authority of Beelzebul , the ruler of demons. ”
CEB	Luke	11	16	Others were testing him , seeking a sign from heaven .
CEB	Luke	11	17	Because Jesus knew what they were thinking , he said to them , “ Every kingdom involved in civil war becomes a wasteland , and a house torn apart by divisions will collapse .
CEB	Luke	11	18	If Satan is at war with himself , how will his kingdom endure ? I ask this because you say that I throw out demons by the authority of Beelzebul .
CEB	Luke	11	19	If I throw out demons by the authority of Beelzebul , then by whose authority do your followers throw them out ? Therefore , they will be your judges .
CEB	Luke	11	20	But if I throw out demons by the power [ a ] of God , then God ’ s kingdom has already overtaken you .
CEB	Luke	11	21	When a strong man , fully armed , guards his own palace , his possessions are secure .
CEB	Luke	11	22	But as soon as a stronger one attacks and overpowers him , the stronger one takes away the armor he had trusted and divides the stolen goods .
CEB	Luke	11	23	“ Whoever isn ’ t with me is against me , and whoever doesn ’ t gather with me , scatters .
CEB	Luke	11	24	When an unclean spirit leaves a person , it wanders through dry places looking for a place to rest . But it doesn ’ t find any . Then it says , ‘ I ’ ll go back to the house I left. ’
CEB	Luke	11	25	When it arrives , it finds the house cleaned up and decorated .
CEB	Luke	11	26	Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more evil than itself . They go in and make their home there . That person is worse off at the end than at the beginning. ” On seeking signs
CEB	Luke	11	27	While Jesus was saying these things , a certain woman in the crowd spoke up : “ Happy is the mother who gave birth to you and who nursed you. ”
CEB	Luke	11	28	But he said , “ Happy rather are those who hear God ’ s word and put it into practice. ”
CEB	Luke	11	29	When the crowds grew , Jesus said , “ This generation is an evil generation . It looks for a sign , but no sign will be given to it except Jonah ’ s sign .
CEB	Luke	11	30	Just as Jonah became a sign to the people of Nineveh , so the Human One [ b ] will be a sign to this generation .
CEB	Luke	11	31	The queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with the people of this generation and condemn them , because she came from a distant land to hear Solomon ’ s wisdom . And look , someone greater than Solomon is here .
CEB	Luke	11	32	The people of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it , because they changed their hearts and lives in response to Jonah ’ s preaching—and one greater than Jonah is here .
CEB	Luke	11	33	“ People don ’ t light a lamp and then put it in a closet or under a basket . Rather , they place the lamp on a lampstand so that those who enter the house can see the light .
CEB	Luke	11	34	Your eye is the lamp of your body . When your eye is healthy , your whole body is full of light . But when your eye is bad , your whole body is full of darkness .
CEB	Luke	11	35	Therefore , see to it that the light in you isn ’ t darkness .
CEB	Luke	11	36	If your whole body is full of light—with no part darkened—then it will be as full of light as when a lamp shines brightly on you. ” Jesus condemns Pharisees and legal experts
CEB	Luke	11	37	While Jesus was speaking , a Pharisee invited him to share a meal with him , so Jesus went and took his place at the table .
CEB	Luke	11	38	When the Pharisee saw that Jesus didn ’ t ritually purify his hands by washing before the meal , he was astonished .
CEB	Luke	11	39	The Lord said to him , “ Now , you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and platter , but your insides are stuffed with greed and wickedness .
CEB	Luke	11	40	Foolish people ! Didn ’ t the one who made the outside also make the inside ?
CEB	Luke	11	41	Therefore , give to those in need from the core of who you are and you will be clean all over .
CEB	Luke	11	42	“ How terrible for you Pharisees ! You give a tenth of your mint , rue , and garden herbs of all kinds , while neglecting justice and love for God . These you ought to have done without neglecting the others .
CEB	Luke	11	43	“ How terrible for you Pharisees ! You love the most prominent seats in the synagogues and respectful greetings in the marketplaces .
CEB	Luke	11	44	“ How terrible for you ! You are like unmarked graves , and people walk on them without recognizing it. ”
CEB	Luke	11	45	One of the legal experts responded , “ Teacher , when you say these things , you are insulting us too. ”
CEB	Luke	11	46	Jesus said , “ How terrible for you legal experts too ! You load people down with impossible burdens and you refuse to lift a single finger to help them .
CEB	Luke	11	47	“ How terrible for you ! You built memorials to the prophets , whom your ancestors killed .
CEB	Luke	11	48	In this way , you testify that you approve of your ancestors ’ deeds . They killed the prophets , and you build memorials !
CEB	Luke	11	49	Therefore , God ’ s wisdom has said , ‘ I will send prophets and apostles to them and they will harass and kill some of them. ’
CEB	Luke	11	50	As a result , this generation will be charged with the murder of all the prophets since the beginning of time .
CEB	Luke	11	51	This includes the murder of every prophet—from Abel to Zechariah—who was killed between the altar and the holy place . Yes , I ’ m telling you , this generation will be charged with it .
CEB	Luke	11	52	“ How terrible for you legal experts ! You snatched away the key of knowledge . You didn ’ t enter yourselves , and you stood in the way of those who were entering. ”
CEB	Luke	11	53	As he left there , the legal experts and Pharisees began to resent him deeply and to ask him pointed questions about many things .
CEB	Luke	11	54	They plotted against him , trying to trap him in his words . Footnotes - Luke 11:20 Or finger - Luke 11:30 Or Son of Man
CEB	Luke	12	12	The Holy Spirit will tell you at that very moment what you must say. ” Warning against greed
CEB	Luke	12	2	Nothing is hidden that won ’ t be revealed , and nothing is secret that won ’ t be brought out into the open .
CEB	Luke	12	3	Therefore , whatever you have said in the darkness will be heard in the light , and whatever you have whispered in the rooms deep inside the house will be announced from the rooftops .
CEB	Luke	12	4	“ I tell you , my friends , don ’ t be terrified by those who can kill the body but after that can do nothing more .
CEB	Luke	12	5	I ’ ll show you whom you should fear : fear the one who , after you have been killed , has the authority to throw you into hell . Indeed , I tell you , that ’ s the one you should fear .
CEB	Luke	12	6	Aren ’ t five sparrows sold for two small coins ? [ a ] Yet not one of them is overlooked by God .
CEB	Luke	12	7	Even the hairs on your head are all counted . Don ’ t be afraid . You are worth more than many sparrows . Acknowledging the Human One
CEB	Luke	12	8	“ I tell you , everyone who acknowledges me before humans , the Human One [ b ] will acknowledge before God ’ s angels .
CEB	Luke	12	9	But the one who rejects me before others will be rejected before God ’ s angels .
CEB	Luke	12	10	Anyone who speaks a word against the Human One [ c ] will be forgiven , but whoever insults the Holy Spirit won ’ t be forgiven .
CEB	Luke	12	11	When they bring you before the synagogues , rulers , and authorities , don ’ t worry about how to defend yourself or what you should say .
CEB	Luke	12	13	Someone from the crowd said to him , “ Teacher , tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me. ”
CEB	Luke	12	14	Jesus said to him , “ Man , who appointed me as judge or referee between you and your brother ? ”
CEB	Luke	12	15	Then Jesus said to them , “ Watch out ! Guard yourself against all kinds of greed . After all , one ’ s life isn ’ t determined by one ’ s possessions , even when someone is very wealthy. ”
CEB	Luke	12	16	Then he told them a parable : “ A certain rich man ’ s land produced a bountiful crop .
CEB	Luke	12	17	He said to himself , What will I do ? I have no place to store my harvest !
CEB	Luke	12	18	Then he thought , Here ’ s what I ’ ll do . I ’ ll tear down my barns and build bigger ones . That ’ s where I ’ ll store all my grain and goods .
CEB	Luke	12	19	I ’ ll say to myself , You have stored up plenty of goods , enough for several years . Take it easy ! Eat , drink , and enjoy yourself .
CEB	Luke	12	20	But God said to him , ‘ Fool , tonight you will die . Now who will get the things you have prepared for yourself ? ’
CEB	Luke	12	21	This is the way it will be for those who hoard things for themselves and aren ’ t rich toward God. ” Warning about worry
CEB	Luke	12	22	Then Jesus said to his disciples , “ Therefore , I say to you , don ’ t worry about your life , what you will eat , or about your body , what you will wear .
CEB	Luke	12	23	There is more to life than food and more to the body than clothing .
CEB	Luke	12	24	Consider the ravens : they neither plant nor harvest , they have no silo or barn , yet God feeds them . You are worth so much more than birds !
CEB	Luke	12	25	Who among you by worrying can add a single moment to your life ? [ d ]
CEB	Luke	12	26	If you can ’ t do such a small thing , why worry about the rest ?
CEB	Luke	12	27	Notice how the lilies grow . They don ’ t wear themselves out with work , and they don ’ t spin cloth . But I say to you that even Solomon in all his splendor wasn ’ t dressed like one of these .
CEB	Luke	12	28	If God dresses grass in the field so beautifully , even though it ’ s alive today and tomorrow it ’ s thrown into the furnace , how much more will God do for you , you people of weak faith !
CEB	Luke	12	29	Don ’ t chase after what you will eat and what you will drink . Stop worrying .
CEB	Luke	12	30	All the nations of the world long for these things . Your Father knows that you need them .
CEB	Luke	12	31	Instead , desire his kingdom and these things will be given to you as well .
CEB	Luke	12	32	“ Don ’ t be afraid , little flock , because your Father delights in giving you the kingdom .
CEB	Luke	12	33	Sell your possessions and give to those in need . Make for yourselves wallets that don ’ t wear out—a treasure in heaven that never runs out . No thief comes near there , and no moth destroys .
CEB	Luke	12	34	Where your treasure is , there your heart will be too . Warning about being prepared
CEB	Luke	12	35	“ Be dressed for service and keep your lamps lit .
CEB	Luke	12	36	Be like people waiting for their master to come home from a wedding celebration , who can immediately open the door for him when he arrives and knocks on the door .
CEB	Luke	12	37	Happy are those servants whom the master finds waiting up when he arrives . I assure you that , when he arrives , he will dress himself to serve , seat them at the table as honored guests , and wait on them .
CEB	Luke	12	38	Happy are those whom he finds alert , even if he comes at midnight or just before dawn . [ e ]
CEB	Luke	12	39	But know this , if the homeowner had known what time the thief was coming , he wouldn ’ t have allowed his home to be broken into .
CEB	Luke	12	40	You also must be ready , because the Human One [ f ] is coming at a time when you don ’ t expect him. ”
CEB	Luke	12	41	Peter said , “ Lord , are you telling this parable for us or for everyone ? ”
CEB	Luke	12	42	The Lord replied , “ Who are the faithful and wise managers whom the master will put in charge of his household servants , to give them their food at the proper time ?
CEB	Luke	12	43	Happy are the servants whom the master finds fulfilling their responsibilities when he comes .
CEB	Luke	12	44	I assure you that the master will put them in charge of all his possessions .
CEB	Luke	12	45	“ But suppose that these servants should say to themselves , My master is taking his time about coming . And suppose they began to beat the servants , both men and women , and to eat , drink , and get drunk .
CEB	Luke	12	46	The master of those servants would come on a day when they weren ’ t expecting him , at a time they couldn ’ t predict . The master will cut them into pieces and assign them a place with the unfaithful .
CEB	Luke	12	47	That servant who knew his master ’ s will but didn ’ t prepare for it or act on it will be beaten severely .
CEB	Luke	12	48	The one who didn ’ t know the master ’ s will but who did things deserving punishment will be beaten only a little . Much will be demanded from everyone who has been given much , and from the one who has been entrusted with much , even more will be asked . Conflicts brought by Jesus
CEB	Luke	12	49	“ I came to cast fire upon the earth . How I wish that it was already ablaze !
CEB	Luke	12	50	I have a baptism I must experience . How I am distressed until it ’ s completed !
CEB	Luke	12	51	Do you think that I have come to bring peace to the earth ? No , I tell you , I have come instead to bring division .
CEB	Luke	12	52	From now on , a household of five will be divided—three against two and two against three .
CEB	Luke	12	53	Father will square off against son and son against father ; mother against daughter and daughter against mother ; and mother-in-law against daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law. ” Learning and practicing good judgment
CEB	Luke	12	54	Jesus also said to the crowds , “ When you see a cloud forming in the west , you immediately say , ‘ It ’ s going to rain. ’ And indeed it does .
CEB	Luke	12	55	And when a south wind blows , you say , ‘ A heat wave is coming. ’ And it does .
CEB	Luke	12	56	Hypocrites ! You know how to interpret conditions on earth and in the sky . How is it that you don ’ t know how to interpret the present time ?
CEB	Luke	12	57	And why don ’ t you judge for yourselves what is right ?
CEB	Luke	12	58	As you are going to court with your accuser , make your best effort to reach a settlement along the way . Otherwise , your accuser may bring you before the judge , and the judge hand you over to the officer , and the officer throw you into prison .
CEB	Luke	12	59	I tell you , you won ’ t get out of there until you have paid the very last cent. ” [ g ] Footnotes - Luke 12:6 Or two assaria—that is , 1/8 of a day ’ s wage - Luke 12:8 Or Son of Man - Luke 12:10 Or Son of Man - Luke 12:25 Or eighteen inches to your height - Luke 12:38 Or in the second or third watch - Luke 12:40 Or Son of Man - Luke 12:59 Or leptos ( 1/128 of a day ’ s wages )
CEB	Luke	13	13	He placed his hands on her and she straightened up at once and praised God .
CEB	Luke	13	2	He replied , “ Do you think the suffering of these Galileans proves that they were more sinful than all the other Galileans ?
CEB	Luke	13	3	No , I tell you , but unless you change your hearts and lives , you will die just as they did .
CEB	Luke	13	4	What about those eighteen people who were killed when the tower of Siloam fell on them ? Do you think that they were more guilty of wrongdoing than everyone else who lives in Jerusalem ?
CEB	Luke	13	5	No , I tell you , but unless you change your hearts and lives , you will die just as they did. ”
CEB	Luke	13	6	Jesus told this parable : “ A man owned a fig tree planted in his vineyard . He came looking for fruit on it and found none .
CEB	Luke	13	7	He said to his gardener , ‘ Look , I ’ ve come looking for fruit on this fig tree for the past three years , and I ’ ve never found any . Cut it down ! Why should it continue depleting the soil ’ s nutrients ? ’
CEB	Luke	13	8	The gardener responded , ‘ Lord , give it one more year , and I will dig around it and give it fertilizer .
CEB	Luke	13	9	Maybe it will produce fruit next year ; if not , then you can cut it down. ’ ” Healing on a Sabbath
CEB	Luke	13	10	Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath .
CEB	Luke	13	11	A woman was there who had been disabled by a spirit for eighteen years . She was bent over and couldn ’ t stand up straight .
CEB	Luke	13	12	When he saw her , Jesus called her to him and said , “ Woman , you are set free from your sickness. ”
CEB	Luke	13	14	The synagogue leader , incensed that Jesus had healed on the Sabbath , responded , “ There are six days during which work is permitted . Come and be healed on those days , not on the Sabbath day. ”
CEB	Luke	13	15	The Lord replied , “ Hypocrites ! Don ’ t each of you on the Sabbath untie your ox or donkey from its stall and lead it out to get a drink ?
CEB	Luke	13	16	Then isn ’ t it necessary that this woman , a daughter of Abraham , bound by Satan for eighteen long years , be set free from her bondage on the Sabbath day ? ”
CEB	Luke	13	17	When he said these things , all his opponents were put to shame , but all those in the crowd rejoiced at all the extraordinary things he was doing . Growth of God ’ s kingdom
CEB	Luke	13	18	Jesus asked , “ What is God ’ s kingdom like ? To what can I compare it ?
CEB	Luke	13	19	It ’ s like a mustard seed that someone took and planted in a garden . It grew and developed into a tree and the birds in the sky nested in its branches. ”
CEB	Luke	13	20	Again he said , “ To what can I compare God ’ s kingdom ?
CEB	Luke	13	21	It ’ s like yeast , which a woman took and hid in a bushel of wheat flour until the yeast had worked its way through the whole. ” Who will be saved ?
CEB	Luke	13	22	Jesus traveled through cities and villages , teaching and making his way to Jerusalem .
CEB	Luke	13	23	Someone said to him , “ Lord , will only a few be saved ? ” Jesus said to them ,
CEB	Luke	13	24	“ Make every effort to enter through the narrow gate . Many , I tell you , will try to enter and won ’ t be able to .
CEB	Luke	13	25	Once the owner of the house gets up and shuts the door , then you will stand outside and knock on the door , saying , ‘ Lord , open the door for us. ’ He will reply , ‘ I don ’ t know you or where you are from. ’
CEB	Luke	13	26	Then you will begin to say , ‘ We ate and drank in your presence , and you taught in our streets. ’
CEB	Luke	13	27	He will respond , ‘ I don ’ t know you or where you are from . Go away from me , all you evildoers ! ’ [ a ]
CEB	Luke	13	28	There will be weeping and grinding of teeth when you see Abraham , Isaac , Jacob , and all the prophets in God ’ s kingdom , but you yourselves will be thrown out .
CEB	Luke	13	29	People will come from east and west , north and south , and sit down to eat in God ’ s kingdom .
CEB	Luke	13	30	Look ! Those who are last will be first and those who are first will be last. ” Sorrow for Jerusalem
CEB	Luke	13	31	At that time , some Pharisees approached Jesus and said , “ Go ! Get away from here , because Herod wants to kill you. ”
CEB	Luke	13	32	Jesus said to them , “ Go , tell that fox , ‘ Look , I ’ m throwing out demons and healing people today and tomorrow , and on the third day I will complete my work .
CEB	Luke	13	33	However , it ’ s necessary for me to travel today , tomorrow , and the next day because it ’ s impossible for a prophet to be killed outside of Jerusalem. ’
CEB	Luke	13	34	“ Jerusalem , Jerusalem , you who kill the prophets and stone those who were sent to you ! How often I have wanted to gather your people just as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings . But you didn ’ t want that .
CEB	Luke	13	35	Look , your house is abandoned . I tell you , you won ’ t see me until the time comes when you say , Blessings on the one who comes in the Lord ’ s name. ” [ b ]
CEB	Luke	14	14	And you will be blessed because they can ’ t repay you . Instead , you will be repaid when the just are resurrected. ”
CEB	Luke	14	2	A man suffering from an abnormal swelling of the body was there .
CEB	Luke	14	3	Jesus asked the lawyers and Pharisees , “ Does the Law allow healing on the Sabbath or not ? ”
CEB	Luke	14	4	But they said nothing . Jesus took hold of the sick man , cured him , and then let him go .
CEB	Luke	14	5	He said to them , “ Suppose your child or ox fell into a ditch on the Sabbath day . Wouldn ’ t you immediately pull it out ? ”
CEB	Luke	14	6	But they had no response . Lessons on humility and generosity
CEB	Luke	14	7	When Jesus noticed how the guests sought out the best seats at the table , he told them a parable .
CEB	Luke	14	8	“ When someone invites you to a wedding celebration , don ’ t take your seat in the place of honor . Someone more highly regarded than you could have been invited by your host .
CEB	Luke	14	9	The host who invited both of you will come and say to you , ‘ Give your seat to this other person. ’ Embarrassed , you will take your seat in the least important place .
CEB	Luke	14	10	Instead , when you receive an invitation , go and sit in the least important place . When your host approaches you , he will say , ‘ Friend , move up here to a better seat. ’ Then you will be honored in the presence of all your fellow guests .
CEB	Luke	14	11	All who lift themselves up will be brought low , and those who make themselves low will be lifted up. ”
CEB	Luke	14	12	Then Jesus said to the person who had invited him , “ When you host a lunch or dinner , don ’ t invite your friends , your brothers and sisters , your relatives , or rich neighbors . If you do , they will invite you in return and that will be your reward .
CEB	Luke	14	13	Instead , when you give a banquet , invite the poor , crippled , lame , and blind .
CEB	Luke	14	15	When one of the dinner guests heard Jesus ’ remarks , he said to Jesus , “ Happy are those who will feast in God ’ s kingdom. ”
CEB	Luke	14	16	Jesus replied , “ A certain man hosted a large dinner and invited many people .
CEB	Luke	14	17	When it was time for the dinner to begin , he sent his servant to tell the invited guests , ‘ Come ! The dinner is now ready. ’
CEB	Luke	14	18	One by one , they all began to make excuses . The first one told him , ‘ I bought a farm and must go and see it . Please excuse me. ’
CEB	Luke	14	19	Another said , ‘ I bought five teams of oxen , and I ’ m going to check on them . Please excuse me. ’
CEB	Luke	14	20	Another said , ‘ I just got married , so I can ’ t come. ’
CEB	Luke	14	21	When he returned , the servant reported these excuses to his master . The master of the house became angry and said to his servant , ‘ Go quickly to the city ’ s streets , the busy ones and the side streets , and bring the poor , crippled , blind , and lame. ’
CEB	Luke	14	22	The servant said , ‘ Master , your instructions have been followed and there is still room. ’
CEB	Luke	14	23	The master said to the servant , ‘ Go to the highways and back alleys and urge people to come in so that my house will be filled .
CEB	Luke	14	24	I tell you , not one of those who were invited will taste my dinner. ’ ” Discipleship ’ s demands
CEB	Luke	14	25	Large crowds were traveling with Jesus . Turning to them , he said ,
CEB	Luke	14	26	“ Whoever comes to me and doesn ’ t hate father and mother , spouse and children , and brothers and sisters—yes , even one ’ s own life— can not be my disciple .
CEB	Luke	14	27	Whoever doesn ’ t carry their own cross and follow me can not be my disciple .
CEB	Luke	14	28	“ If one of you wanted to build a tower , wouldn ’ t you first sit down and calculate the cost , to determine whether you have enough money to complete it ?
CEB	Luke	14	29	Otherwise , when you have laid the foundation but couldn ’ t finish the tower , all who see it will begin to belittle you .
CEB	Luke	14	30	They will say , ‘ Here ’ s the person who began construction and couldn ’ t complete it ! ’
CEB	Luke	14	31	Or what king would go to war against another king without first sitting down to consider whether his ten thousand soldiers could go up against the twenty thousand coming against him ?
CEB	Luke	14	32	And if he didn ’ t think he could win , he would send a representative to discuss terms of peace while his enemy was still a long way off .
CEB	Luke	14	33	In the same way , none of you who are unwilling to give up all of your possessions can be my disciple .
CEB	Luke	14	34	“ Salt is good . But if salt loses its flavor , how will it become salty again ?
CEB	Luke	14	35	It has no value , neither for the soil nor for the manure pile . People throw it away . Whoever has ears to hear should pay attention . ”
CEB	Luke	15	15	He hired himself out to one of the citizens of that country , who sent him into his fields to feed pigs .
CEB	Luke	15	2	The Pharisees and legal experts were grumbling , saying , “ This man welcomes sinners and eats with them. ”
CEB	Luke	15	3	Jesus told them this parable :
CEB	Luke	15	4	“ Suppose someone among you had one hundred sheep and lost one of them . Wouldn ’ t he leave the other ninety-nine in the pasture and search for the lost one until he finds it ?
CEB	Luke	15	5	And when he finds it , he is thrilled and places it on his shoulders .
CEB	Luke	15	6	When he arrives home , he calls together his friends and neighbors , saying to them , ‘ Celebrate with me because I ’ ve found my lost sheep. ’
CEB	Luke	15	7	In the same way , I tell you , there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who changes both heart and life than over ninety-nine righteous people who have no need to change their hearts and lives .
CEB	Luke	15	8	“ Or what woman , if she owns ten silver coins and loses one of them , won ’ t light a lamp and sweep the house , searching her home carefully until she finds it ?
CEB	Luke	15	9	When she finds it , she calls together her friends and neighbors , saying , ‘ Celebrate with me because I ’ ve found my lost coin. ’
CEB	Luke	15	10	In the same way , I tell you , joy breaks out in the presence of God ’ s angels over one sinner who changes both heart and life. ”
CEB	Luke	15	11	Jesus said , “ A certain man had two sons .
CEB	Luke	15	12	The younger son said to his father , ‘ Father , give me my share of the inheritance. ’ Then the father divided his estate between them .
CEB	Luke	15	13	Soon afterward , the younger son gathered everything together and took a trip to a land far away . There , he wasted his wealth through extravagant living .
CEB	Luke	15	14	“ When he had used up his resources , a severe food shortage arose in that country and he began to be in need .
CEB	Luke	15	16	He longed to eat his fill from what the pigs ate , but no one gave him anything .
CEB	Luke	15	17	When he came to his senses , he said , ‘ How many of my father ’ s hired hands have more than enough food , but I ’ m starving to death !
CEB	Luke	15	18	I will get up and go to my father , and say to him , “ Father , I have sinned against heaven and against you .
CEB	Luke	15	19	I no longer deserve to be called your son . Take me on as one of your hired hands. ” ’
CEB	Luke	15	20	So he got up and went to his father . “ While he was still a long way off , his father saw him and was moved with compassion . His father ran to him , hugged him , and kissed him .
CEB	Luke	15	21	Then his son said , ‘ Father , I have sinned against heaven and against you . I no longer deserve to be called your son. ’
CEB	Luke	15	22	But the father said to his servants , ‘ Quickly , bring out the best robe and put it on him ! Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet !
CEB	Luke	15	23	Fetch the fattened calf and slaughter it . We must celebrate with feasting
CEB	Luke	15	24	because this son of mine was dead and has come back to life ! He was lost and is found ! ’ And they began to celebrate .
CEB	Luke	15	25	“ Now his older son was in the field . Coming in from the field , he approached the house and heard music and dancing .
CEB	Luke	15	26	He called one of the servants and asked what was going on .
CEB	Luke	15	27	The servant replied , ‘ Your brother has arrived , and your father has slaughtered the fattened calf because he received his son back safe and sound. ’
CEB	Luke	15	28	Then the older son was furious and didn ’ t want to enter in , but his father came out and begged him .
CEB	Luke	15	29	He answered his father , ‘ Look , I ’ ve served you all these years , and I never disobeyed your instruction . Yet you ’ ve never given me as much as a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends .
CEB	Luke	15	30	But when this son of yours returned , after gobbling up your estate on prostitutes , you slaughtered the fattened calf for him. ’
CEB	Luke	15	31	Then his father said , ‘ Son , you are always with me , and everything I have is yours .
CEB	Luke	15	32	But we had to celebrate and be glad because this brother of yours was dead and is alive . He was lost and is found . ’ ”
CEB	Luke	16	16	Until John , there was only the Law and the Prophets . Since then , the good news of God ’ s kingdom is preached , and everyone is urged to enter it .
CEB	Luke	16	2	He called the manager in and said to him , ‘ What is this I hear about you ? Give me a report of your administration because you can no longer serve as my manager. ’
CEB	Luke	16	3	“ The household manager said to himself , What will I do now that my master is firing me as his manager ? I ’ m not strong enough to dig and too proud to beg .
CEB	Luke	16	4	I know what I ’ ll do so that , when I am removed from my management position , people will welcome me into their houses .
CEB	Luke	16	5	“ One by one , the manager sent for each person who owed his master money . He said to the first , ‘ How much do you owe my master ? ’
CEB	Luke	16	6	He said , ‘ Nine hundred gallons of olive oil. ’ [ a ] The manager said to him , ‘ Take your contract , sit down quickly , and write four hundred fifty gallons. ’
CEB	Luke	16	7	Then the manager said to another , ‘ How much do you owe ? ’ He said , ‘ One thousand bushels of wheat. ’ [ b ] He said , ‘ Take your contract and write eight hundred. ’
CEB	Luke	16	8	“ The master commended the dishonest manager because he acted cleverly . People who belong to this world are more clever in dealing with their peers than are people who belong to the light .
CEB	Luke	16	9	I tell you , use worldly wealth to make friends for yourselves so that when it ’ s gone , you will be welcomed into the eternal homes .
CEB	Luke	16	10	“ Whoever is faithful with little is also faithful with much , and the one who is dishonest with little is also dishonest with much .
CEB	Luke	16	11	If you haven ’ t been faithful with worldly wealth , who will trust you with true riches ?
CEB	Luke	16	12	If you haven ’ t been faithful with someone else ’ s property , who will give you your own ?
CEB	Luke	16	13	No household servant can serve two masters . Either you will hate the one and love the other , or you will be loyal to the one and have contempt for the other . You can not serve God and wealth. ” Jesus responds to Pharisees
CEB	Luke	16	14	The Pharisees , who were money-lovers , heard all this and sneered at Jesus .
CEB	Luke	16	15	He said to them , “ You are the ones who justify yourselves before other people , but God knows your hearts . What is highly valued by people is deeply offensive to God .
CEB	Luke	16	17	It ’ s easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for the smallest stroke of a pen in the Law to drop out .
CEB	Luke	16	18	Any man who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery , and a man who marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery .
CEB	Luke	16	19	“ There was a certain rich man who clothed himself in purple and fine linen , and who feasted luxuriously every day .
CEB	Luke	16	20	At his gate lay a certain poor man named Lazarus who was covered with sores .
CEB	Luke	16	21	Lazarus longed to eat the crumbs that fell from the rich man ’ s table . Instead , dogs would come and lick his sores .
CEB	Luke	16	22	“ The poor man died and was carried by angels to Abraham ’ s side . The rich man also died and was buried .
CEB	Luke	16	23	While being tormented in the place of the dead , he looked up and saw Abraham at a distance with Lazarus at his side .
CEB	Luke	16	24	He shouted , ‘ Father Abraham , have mercy on me . Send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue , because I ’ m suffering in this flame. ’
CEB	Luke	16	25	But Abraham said , ‘ Child , remember that during your lifetime you received good things , whereas Lazarus received terrible things . Now Lazarus is being comforted and you are in great pain .
CEB	Luke	16	26	Moreover , a great crevasse has been fixed between us and you . Those who wish to cross over from here to you can not . Neither can anyone cross from there to us. ’
CEB	Luke	16	27	“ The rich man said , ‘ Then I beg you , Father , send Lazarus to my father ’ s house .
CEB	Luke	16	28	I have five brothers . He needs to warn them so that they don ’ t come to this place of agony. ’
CEB	Luke	16	29	Abraham replied , ‘ They have Moses and the Prophets . They must listen to them. ’
CEB	Luke	16	30	The rich man said , ‘ No , Father Abraham ! But if someone from the dead goes to them , they will change their hearts and lives. ’
CEB	Luke	16	31	Abraham said , ‘ If they don ’ t listen to Moses and the Prophets , then neither will they be persuaded if someone rises from the dead . ’ ”
CEB	Luke	17	17	Jesus replied , “ Weren ’ t ten cleansed ? Where are the other nine ?
CEB	Luke	17	2	It would be better for them to be thrown into a lake with a large stone hung around their neck than to cause one of these little ones to trip and fall into sin .
CEB	Luke	17	3	Watch yourselves ! If your brother or sister sins , warn them to stop . If they change their hearts and lives , forgive them .
CEB	Luke	17	4	Even if someone sins against you seven times in one day and returns to you seven times and says , ‘ I am changing my ways , ’ you must forgive that person. ”
CEB	Luke	17	5	The apostles said to the Lord , “ Increase our faith ! ”
CEB	Luke	17	6	The Lord replied , “ If you had faith the size of a mustard seed , you could say to this mulberry tree , ‘ Be uprooted and planted in the sea , ’ and it would obey you .
CEB	Luke	17	7	“ Would any of you say to your servant , who had just come in from the field after plowing or tending sheep , ‘ Come ! Sit down for dinner ’ ?
CEB	Luke	17	8	Wouldn ’ t you say instead , ‘ Fix my dinner . Put on the clothes of a table servant and wait on me while I eat and drink . After that , you can eat and drink ’ ?
CEB	Luke	17	9	You won ’ t thank the servant because the servant did what you asked , will you ?
CEB	Luke	17	10	In the same way , when you have done everything required of you , you should say , ‘ We servants deserve no special praise . We have only done our duty. ’ ” Jesus heals a Samaritan
CEB	Luke	17	11	On the way to Jerusalem , Jesus traveled along the border between Samaria and Galilee .
CEB	Luke	17	12	As he entered a village , ten men with skin diseases approached him . Keeping their distance from him ,
CEB	Luke	17	13	they raised their voices and said , “ Jesus , Master , show us mercy ! ”
CEB	Luke	17	14	When Jesus saw them , he said , “ Go , show yourselves to the priests. ” As they left , they were cleansed .
CEB	Luke	17	15	One of them , when he saw that he had been healed , returned and praised God with a loud voice .
CEB	Luke	17	16	He fell on his face at Jesus ’ feet and thanked him . He was a Samaritan .
CEB	Luke	17	18	No one returned to praise God except this foreigner ? ”
CEB	Luke	17	19	Then Jesus said to him , “ Get up and go . Your faith has healed you. ” The kingdom is coming
CEB	Luke	17	20	Pharisees asked Jesus when God ’ s kingdom was coming . He replied , “ God ’ s kingdom isn ’ t coming with signs that are easily noticed .
CEB	Luke	17	21	Nor will people say , ‘ Look , here it is ! ’ or ‘ There it is ! ’ Don ’ t you see ? God ’ s kingdom is already among you. ”
CEB	Luke	17	22	Then Jesus said to the disciples , “ The time will come when you will long to see one of the days of the Human One , [ a ] and you won ’ t see it .
CEB	Luke	17	23	People will say to you , ‘ Look there ! ’ or ‘ Look here ! ’ Don ’ t leave or go chasing after them .
CEB	Luke	17	24	The Human One [ b ] will appear on his day in the same way that a flash of lightning lights up the sky from one end to the other .
CEB	Luke	17	25	However , first he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation .
CEB	Luke	17	26	“ As it was in the days of Noah , so it will be during the days of the Human One . [ c ]
CEB	Luke	17	27	People were eating , drinking , marrying , and being given in marriage until the day Noah entered the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all .
CEB	Luke	17	28	Likewise in the days of Lot , people were eating , drinking , buying , selling , planting , and building .
CEB	Luke	17	29	But on the day Lot left Sodom , fire and sulfur rained down from heaven and destroyed them all .
CEB	Luke	17	30	That ’ s the way it will be on the day the Human One [ d ] is revealed .
CEB	Luke	17	31	On that day , those on the roof , whose possessions are in the house , shouldn ’ t come down to grab them . Likewise , those in the field shouldn ’ t turn back .
CEB	Luke	17	32	Remember Lot ’ s wife !
CEB	Luke	17	33	Whoever tries to preserve their life will lose it , but whoever loses their life will preserve it .
CEB	Luke	17	34	I tell you , on that night two people will be in the same bed : one will be taken and the other left .
CEB	Luke	17	35	Two women will be grinding grain together : one will be taken and the other left. ” [ e ]
CEB	Luke	17	37	The disciples asked , “ Where , Lord ? ” Jesus said , “ The vultures gather wherever there ’ s a dead body. ” Footnotes - Luke 17:22 Or Son of Man - Luke 17:24 Or Son of Man - Luke 17:26 Or Son of Man - Luke 17:30 Or Son of Man - Luke 17:35 Critical editions of the Gk New Testament do not include 17:36 Two will be in a field : one will be taken and the other left .
CEB	Luke	18	18	A certain ruler asked Jesus , “ Good Teacher , what must I do to obtain eternal life ? ”
CEB	Luke	18	2	He said , “ In a certain city there was a judge who neither feared God nor respected people .
CEB	Luke	18	3	In that city there was a widow who kept coming to him , asking , ‘ Give me justice in this case against my adversary. ’
CEB	Luke	18	4	For a while he refused but finally said to himself , I don ’ t fear God or respect people ,
CEB	Luke	18	5	but I will give this widow justice because she keeps bothering me . Otherwise , there will be no end to her coming here and embarrassing me. ”
CEB	Luke	18	6	The Lord said , “ Listen to what the unjust judge says .
CEB	Luke	18	7	Won ’ t God provide justice to his chosen people who cry out to him day and night ? Will he be slow to help them ?
CEB	Luke	18	8	I tell you , he will give them justice quickly . But when the Human One [ a ] comes , will he find faithfulness on earth ? ” The Pharisee and the tax collector
CEB	Luke	18	9	Jesus told this parable to certain people who had convinced themselves that they were righteous and who looked on everyone else with disgust :
CEB	Luke	18	10	“ Two people went up to the temple to pray . One was a Pharisee and the other a tax collector .
CEB	Luke	18	11	The Pharisee stood and prayed about himself with these words , ‘ God , I thank you that I ’ m not like everyone else—crooks , evildoers , adulterers—or even like this tax collector .
CEB	Luke	18	12	I fast twice a week . I give a tenth of everything I receive. ’
CEB	Luke	18	13	But the tax collector stood at a distance . He wouldn ’ t even lift his eyes to look toward heaven . Rather , he struck his chest and said , ‘ God , show mercy to me , a sinner. ’
CEB	Luke	18	14	I tell you , this person went down to his home justified rather than the Pharisee . All who lift themselves up will be brought low , and those who make themselves low will be lifted up. ” Jesus blesses children
CEB	Luke	18	15	People were bringing babies to Jesus so that he would bless them . When the disciples saw this , they scolded them .
CEB	Luke	18	16	Then Jesus called them to him and said , “ Allow the children to come to me . Don ’ t forbid them , because God ’ s kingdom belongs to people like these children .
CEB	Luke	18	17	I assure you that whoever doesn ’ t welcome God ’ s kingdom like a child will never enter it. ” A rich man ’ s question
CEB	Luke	18	19	Jesus replied , “ Why do you call me good ? No one is good except the one God .
CEB	Luke	18	20	You know the commandments : Don ’ t commit adultery . Don ’ t murder . Don ’ t steal . Don ’ t give false testimony . Honor your father and mother. ” [ b ]
CEB	Luke	18	21	Then the ruler said , “ I ’ ve kept all of these things since I was a boy. ”
CEB	Luke	18	22	When Jesus heard this , he said , “ There ’ s one more thing . Sell everything you own and distribute the money to the poor . Then you will have treasure in heaven . And come , follow me. ”
CEB	Luke	18	23	When he heard these words , the man became sad because he was extremely rich .
CEB	Luke	18	24	When Jesus saw this , he said , “ It ’ s very hard for the wealthy to enter God ’ s kingdom !
CEB	Luke	18	25	It ’ s easier for a camel to squeeze through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter God ’ s kingdom. ”
CEB	Luke	18	26	Those who heard this said , “ Then who can be saved ? ”
CEB	Luke	18	27	Jesus replied , “ What is impossible for humans is possible for God. ”
CEB	Luke	18	28	Peter said , “ Look , we left everything we own and followed you. ”
CEB	Luke	18	29	Jesus said to them , “ I assure you that anyone who has left house , husband , wife , brothers , sisters , parents , or children because of God ’ s kingdom
CEB	Luke	18	30	will receive many times more in this age and eternal life in the coming age. ” Jesus predicts his death and resurrection
CEB	Luke	18	31	Jesus took the Twelve aside and said , “ Look , we ’ re going up to Jerusalem , and everything written about the Human One [ c ] by the prophets will be accomplished .
CEB	Luke	18	32	He will be handed over to the Gentiles . He will be ridiculed , mistreated , and spit on .
CEB	Luke	18	33	After torturing him , they will kill him . On the third day , he will rise up. ”
CEB	Luke	18	34	But the Twelve understood none of these words . The meaning of this message was hidden from them and they didn ’ t grasp what he was saying . A blind man is healed
CEB	Luke	18	35	As Jesus came to Jericho , a certain blind man was sitting beside the road begging .
CEB	Luke	18	36	When the man heard the crowd passing by , he asked what was happening .
CEB	Luke	18	37	They told him , “ Jesus the Nazarene is passing by. ”
CEB	Luke	18	38	The blind man shouted , “ Jesus , Son of David , show me mercy. ”
CEB	Luke	18	39	Those leading the procession scolded him , telling him to be quiet , but he shouted even louder , “ Son of David , show me mercy. ”
CEB	Luke	18	40	Jesus stopped and called for the man to be brought to him . When he was present Jesus asked ,
CEB	Luke	18	41	“ What do you want me to do for you ? ” He said , “ Lord , I want to see. ”
CEB	Luke	18	42	Jesus said to him , “ Receive your sight ! Your faith has healed you. ”
CEB	Luke	18	43	At once he was able to see , and he began to follow Jesus , praising God . When all the people saw it , they praised God too . Footnotes - Luke 18:8 Or Son of Man - Luke 18:20 Deut 5:16-20 ; Exod 20:12-16 - Luke 18:31 Or Son of Man
CEB	Luke	19	19	To this one , the king said , ‘ You will have authority over five cities. ’
CEB	Luke	19	2	A man there named Zacchaeus , a ruler among tax collectors , was rich .
CEB	Luke	19	3	He was trying to see who Jesus was , but , being a short man , he couldn ’ t because of the crowd .
CEB	Luke	19	4	So he ran ahead and climbed up a sycamore tree so he could see Jesus , who was about to pass that way .
CEB	Luke	19	5	When Jesus came to that spot , he looked up and said , “ Zacchaeus , come down at once . I must stay in your home today. ”
CEB	Luke	19	6	So Zacchaeus came down at once , happy to welcome Jesus .
CEB	Luke	19	7	Everyone who saw this grumbled , saying , “ He has gone to be the guest of a sinner. ”
CEB	Luke	19	8	Zacchaeus stopped and said to the Lord , “ Look , Lord , I give half of my possessions to the poor . And if I have cheated anyone , I repay them four times as much. ”
CEB	Luke	19	9	Jesus said to him , “ Today , salvation has come to this household because he too is a son of Abraham .
CEB	Luke	19	10	The Human One [ a ] came to seek and save the lost. ” Faithful service
CEB	Luke	19	11	As they listened to this , Jesus told them another parable because he was near Jerusalem and they thought God ’ s kingdom would appear right away .
CEB	Luke	19	12	He said , “ A certain man who was born into royalty went to a distant land to receive his kingdom and then return .
CEB	Luke	19	13	He called together ten servants and gave each of them money worth four months ’ wages . [ b ] He said , ‘ Do business with this until I return. ’
CEB	Luke	19	14	His citizens hated him , so they sent a representative after him who said , ‘ We don ’ t want this man to be our king. ’
CEB	Luke	19	15	After receiving his kingdom , he returned and called the servants to whom he had given the money to find out how much they had earned .
CEB	Luke	19	16	The first servant came forward and said , ‘ Your money has earned a return of one thousand percent. ’
CEB	Luke	19	17	The king replied , ‘ Excellent ! You are a good servant . Because you have been faithful in a small matter , you will have authority over ten cities. ’
CEB	Luke	19	18	“ The second servant came and said , ‘ Master , your money has made a return of five hundred percent. ’
CEB	Luke	19	20	“ Another servant came and said , ‘ Master , here is your money . I wrapped it up in a scarf for safekeeping .
CEB	Luke	19	21	I was afraid of you because you are a stern man . You withdraw what you haven ’ t deposited and you harvest what you haven ’ t planted. ’
CEB	Luke	19	22	The king replied , ‘ I will judge you by the words of your own mouth , you worthless servant ! You knew , did you , that I ’ m a stern man , withdrawing what I didn ’ t deposit , and harvesting what I didn ’ t plant ?
CEB	Luke	19	23	Why then didn ’ t you put my money in the bank ? Then when I arrived , at least I could have gotten it back with interest. ’
CEB	Luke	19	24	“ He said to his attendants , ‘ Take his money and give it to the one who has ten times as much. ’
CEB	Luke	19	25	‘ But Master , ’ they said , ‘ he already has ten times as much ! ’
CEB	Luke	19	26	He replied , ‘ I say to you that everyone who has will be given more , but from those who have nothing , even what they have will be taken away .
CEB	Luke	19	27	As for my enemies who don ’ t want me as their king , bring them here and slaughter them before me. ’ ”
CEB	Luke	19	28	After Jesus said this , he continued on ahead , going up to Jerusalem . Procession into Jerusalem
CEB	Luke	19	29	As Jesus came to Bethphage and Bethany on the Mount of Olives , he gave two disciples a task .
CEB	Luke	19	30	He said , “ Go into the village over there . When you enter it , you will find tied up there a colt that no one has ever ridden . Untie it and bring it here .
CEB	Luke	19	31	If anyone asks , ‘ Why are you untying it ? ’ just say , ‘ Its master needs it. ’ ”
CEB	Luke	19	32	Those who had been sent found it exactly as he had said .
CEB	Luke	19	33	As they were untying the colt , its owners said to them , “ Why are you untying the colt ? ”
CEB	Luke	19	34	They replied , “ Its master needs it. ”
CEB	Luke	19	35	They brought it to Jesus , threw their clothes on the colt , and lifted Jesus onto it .
CEB	Luke	19	36	As Jesus rode along , they spread their clothes on the road .
CEB	Luke	19	37	As Jesus approached the road leading down from the Mount of Olives , the whole throng of his disciples began rejoicing . They praised God with a loud voice because of all the mighty things they had seen .
CEB	Luke	19	38	They said , “ Blessings on the king who comes in the name of the Lord . Peace in heaven and glory in the highest heavens. ”
CEB	Luke	19	39	Some of the Pharisees from the crowd said to Jesus , “ Teacher , scold your disciples ! Tell them to stop ! ”
CEB	Luke	19	40	He answered , “ I tell you , if they were silent , the stones would shout. ” Jesus predicts Jerusalem ’ s destruction
CEB	Luke	19	41	As Jesus came to the city and observed it , he wept over it .
CEB	Luke	19	42	He said , “ If only you knew on this of all days the things that lead to peace . But now they are hidden from your eyes .
CEB	Luke	19	43	The time will come when your enemies will build fortifications around you , encircle you , and attack you from all sides .
CEB	Luke	19	44	They will crush you completely , you and the people within you . They won ’ t leave one stone on top of another within you , because you didn ’ t recognize the time of your gracious visit from God. ” Jesus clears the temple
CEB	Luke	19	45	When Jesus entered the temple , he threw out those who were selling things there .
CEB	Luke	19	46	He said to them , “ It ’ s written , My house will be a house of prayer , but you have made it a hideout for crooks. ” [ c ]
CEB	Luke	19	47	Jesus was teaching daily in the temple . The chief priests , the legal experts , and the foremost leaders among the people were seeking to kill him .
CEB	Luke	19	48	However , they couldn ’ t find a way to do it because all the people were enthralled with what they heard . Footnotes - Luke 19:10 Or Son of Man - Luke 19:13 Or he divided ten minas among them - Luke 19:46 Isa 56:7 ; Jer 7:11
CEB	Luke	20	20	The legal experts and chief priests were watching Jesus closely and sent spies who pretended to be sincere . They wanted to trap him in his words so they could hand him over to the jurisdiction and authority of the governor .
CEB	Luke	20	2	They said , “ Tell us : What kind of authority do you have for doing these things ? Who gave you this authority ? ”
CEB	Luke	20	3	He replied , “ I have a question for you . Tell me :
CEB	Luke	20	4	Was John ’ s baptism of heavenly or of human origin ? ”
CEB	Luke	20	5	They discussed among themselves , “ If we say , ‘ It ’ s of heavenly origin , ’ he ’ ll say , ‘ Why didn ’ t you believe him ? ’
CEB	Luke	20	6	But if we say , ‘ It ’ s of human origin , ’ all the people will stone us to death because they are convinced that John was a prophet. ”
CEB	Luke	20	7	They answered that they didn ’ t know where it came from .
CEB	Luke	20	8	Then Jesus replied , “ Neither will I tell you what kind of authority I have to do these things. ” Parable of the tenant farmers
CEB	Luke	20	9	Jesus told the people this parable : “ A certain man planted a vineyard , rented it to tenant farmers , and went on a trip for a long time .
CEB	Luke	20	10	When it was time , he sent a servant to collect from the tenants his share of the fruit of the vineyard . But the tenants sent him away , beaten and empty-handed .
CEB	Luke	20	11	The man sent another servant . But they beat him , treated him disgracefully , and sent him away empty-handed as well .
CEB	Luke	20	12	He sent a third servant . They wounded this servant and threw him out .
CEB	Luke	20	13	The owner of the vineyard said , ‘ What should I do ? I ’ ll send my son , whom I love dearly . Perhaps they will respect him. ’
CEB	Luke	20	14	But when they saw him , they said to each other , ‘ This is the heir . Let ’ s kill him so the inheritance will be ours. ’
CEB	Luke	20	15	They threw him out of the vineyard and killed him . What will the owner of the vineyard do to them ?
CEB	Luke	20	16	He will come and destroy those tenants and give the vineyard to others. ” When the people heard this , they said , “ May this never happen ! ”
CEB	Luke	20	17	Staring at them , Jesus said , “ Then what is the meaning of this text of scripture : The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone ? [ a ]
CEB	Luke	20	18	Everyone who falls on that stone will be crushed . And the stone will crush the person it falls on. ”
CEB	Luke	20	19	The legal experts and chief priests wanted to arrest him right then because they knew he had told this parable against them . But they feared the people . An attempt to trap Jesus
CEB	Luke	20	21	They asked him , “ Teacher , we know that you are correct in what you say and teach . You don ’ t show favoritism but teach God ’ s way as it really is .
CEB	Luke	20	22	Does the Law allow people to pay taxes to Caesar or not ? ”
CEB	Luke	20	23	Since Jesus recognized their deception , he said to them ,
CEB	Luke	20	24	“ Show me a coin . [ b ] Whose image and inscription does it have on it ? ” “ Caesar ’ s , ” they replied .
CEB	Luke	20	25	He said to them , “ Give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar and to God what belongs to God. ”
CEB	Luke	20	26	They couldn ’ t trap him in his words in front of the people . Astonished by his answer , they were speechless . Question about the resurrection
CEB	Luke	20	27	Some Sadducees , who deny that there ’ s a resurrection , came to Jesus and asked ,
CEB	Luke	20	28	“ Teacher , Moses wrote for us that if a man ’ s brother dies leaving a widow but no children , the brother must marry the widow and raise up children for his brother . [ c ]
CEB	Luke	20	29	Now there were seven brothers . The first man married a woman and then died childless .
CEB	Luke	20	30	The second
CEB	Luke	20	31	and then the third brother married her . Eventually all seven married her , and they all died without leaving any children .
CEB	Luke	20	32	Finally , the woman died too .
CEB	Luke	20	33	In the resurrection , whose wife will she be ? All seven were married to her. ”
CEB	Luke	20	34	Jesus said to them , “ People who belong to this age marry and are given in marriage .
CEB	Luke	20	35	But those who are considered worthy to participate in that age , that is , in the age of the resurrection from the dead , won ’ t marry nor will they be given in marriage .
CEB	Luke	20	36	They can no longer die , because they are like angels and are God ’ s children since they share in the resurrection .
CEB	Luke	20	37	Even Moses demonstrated that the dead are raised—in the passage about the burning bush , when he speaks of the Lord as the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob . [ d ]
CEB	Luke	20	38	He isn ’ t the God of the dead but of the living . To him they are all alive. ”
CEB	Luke	20	39	Some of the legal experts responded , “ Teacher , you have answered well. ”
CEB	Luke	20	40	No one dared to ask him anything else .
CEB	Luke	20	41	Jesus said to them , “ Why do they say that the Christ is David ’ s son ?
CEB	Luke	20	42	David himself says in the scroll of Psalms , The Lord said to my lord , ‘ Sit at my right side
CEB	Luke	20	43	until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet. ’ [ e ]
CEB	Luke	20	44	Since David calls him ‘ Lord , ’ how can he be David ’ s son ? ” Jesus condemns the legal experts
CEB	Luke	20	45	In the presence of all the people , Jesus said to his disciples ,
CEB	Luke	20	46	“ Watch out for the legal experts . They like to walk around in long robes . They love being greeted with honor in the markets . They long for the places of honor in the synagogues and at banquets .
CEB	Luke	20	47	They are the ones who cheat widows out of their homes , and to show off they say long prayers . They will be judged most harshly . ”
CEB	Luke	21	21	At that time , those in Judea must flee to the mountains , those in the city must escape , and those in the countryside must not enter the city .
CEB	Luke	21	2	He also saw a poor widow throw in two small copper coins worth a penny . [ a ]
CEB	Luke	21	3	He said , “ I assure you that this poor widow has put in more than them all .
CEB	Luke	21	4	All of them are giving out of their spare change . But she from her hopeless poverty has given everything she had to live on. ” The temple ’ s fate
CEB	Luke	21	5	Some people were talking about the temple , how it was decorated with beautiful stones and ornaments dedicated to God . Jesus said ,
CEB	Luke	21	6	“ As for the things you are admiring , the time is coming when not even one stone will be left upon another . All will be demolished. ”
CEB	Luke	21	7	They asked him , “ Teacher , when will these things happen ? What sign will show that these things are about to happen ? ”
CEB	Luke	21	8	Jesus said , “ Watch out that you aren ’ t deceived . Many will come in my name , saying , ‘ I ’ m the one ! ’ and ‘ It ’ s time ! ’ Don ’ t follow them .
CEB	Luke	21	9	When you hear of wars and rebellions , don ’ t be alarmed . These things must happen first , but the end won ’ t happen immediately. ”
CEB	Luke	21	10	Then Jesus said to them , “ Nations and kingdoms will fight against each other .

CEB	Luke	22	3	Then Satan entered Judas , called Iscariot , who was one of the Twelve .

CEB	Luke	22	9	They said to him , “ Where do you want us to prepare it ? ”
CEB	Luke	22	10	Jesus replied , “ When you go into the city , a man carrying a water jar will meet you . Follow him to the house he enters .

CEB	Luke	22	24	An argument broke out among the disciples over which one of them should be regarded as the greatest .
CEB	Luke	22	25	But Jesus said to them , “ The kings of the Gentiles rule over their subjects , and those in authority over them are called ‘ friends of the people. ’
CEB	Luke	22	26	But that ’ s not the way it will be with you . Instead , the greatest among you must become like a person of lower status and the leader like a servant .
CEB	Luke	22	27	So which one is greater , the one who is seated at the table or the one who serves at the table ? Isn ’ t it the one who is seated at the table ? But I am among you as one who serves .
CEB	Luke	22	28	“ You are the ones who have continued with me in my trials .

CEB	Luke	22	35	Jesus said to them , “ When I sent you out without a wallet , bag , or sandals , you didn ’ t lack anything , did you ? ” They said , “ Nothing. ”
CEB	Luke	22	36	Then he said to them , “ But now , whoever has a wallet must take it , and likewise a bag . And those who don ’ t own a sword must sell their clothes and buy one .
CEB	Luke	22	37	I tell you that this scripture must be fulfilled in relation to me : And he was counted among criminals . [ b ] Indeed , what ’ s written about me is nearing completion. ”
CEB	Luke	22	38	They said to him , “ Lord , look , here are two swords. ” He replied , “ Enough of that ! ” Jesus in prayer
CEB	Luke	22	39	Jesus left and made his way to the Mount of Olives , as was his custom , and the disciples followed him .
CEB	Luke	22	40	When he arrived , he said to them , “ Pray that you won ’ t give in to temptation. ”
CEB	Luke	22	41	He withdrew from them about a stone ’ s throw , knelt down , and prayed .
CEB	Luke	22	42	He said , “ Father , if it ’ s your will , take this cup of suffering away from me . However , not my will but your will must be done. ”
CEB	Luke	22	43	Then a heavenly angel appeared to him and strengthened him .
CEB	Luke	22	44	He was in anguish and prayed even more earnestly . His sweat became like drops of blood falling on the ground .
CEB	Luke	22	45	When he got up from praying , he went to the disciples . He found them asleep , overcome by grief .

CEB	Luke	22	47	While Jesus was still speaking , a crowd appeared , and the one called Judas , one of the Twelve , was leading them . He approached Jesus to kiss him .
CEB	Luke	22	48	Jesus said to him , “ Judas , would you betray the Human One [ c ] with a kiss ? ”
CEB	Luke	22	49	When those around him recognized what was about to happen , they said , “ Lord , should we fight with our swords ? ”
CEB	Luke	22	50	One of them struck the high priest ’ s servant , cutting off his right ear .
CEB	Luke	22	51	Jesus responded , “ Stop ! No more of this ! ” He touched the slave ’ s ear and healed him .
CEB	Luke	22	52	Then Jesus said to the chief priests , the officers of the temple guard , and the elders who had come to get him , “ Have you come with swords and clubs to arrest me , as though I were a thief ?
CEB	Luke	22	53	Day after day I was with you in the temple , but you didn ’ t arrest me . But this is your time , when darkness rules. ” Peter denies knowing Jesus
CEB	Luke	22	54	After they arrested Jesus , they led him away and brought him to the high priest ’ s house . Peter followed from a distance .
CEB	Luke	22	55	When they lit a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together , Peter sat among them .
CEB	Luke	22	56	Then a servant woman saw him sitting in the firelight . She stared at him and said , “ This man was with him too. ”
CEB	Luke	22	57	But Peter denied it , saying , “ Woman , I don ’ t know him ! ”
CEB	Luke	22	58	A little while later , someone else saw him and said , “ You are one of them too. ” But Peter said , “ Man , I ’ m not ! ”
CEB	Luke	22	59	An hour or so later , someone else insisted , “ This man must have been with him , because he is a Galilean too. ”
CEB	Luke	22	60	Peter responded , “ Man , I don ’ t know what you are talking about ! ” At that very moment , while he was still speaking , a rooster crowed .
CEB	Luke	22	61	The Lord turned and looked straight at Peter , and Peter remembered the Lord ’ s words : “ Before a rooster crows today , you will deny me three times. ”
CEB	Luke	22	62	And Peter went out and cried uncontrollably . Jesus taunted
CEB	Luke	22	63	The men who were holding Jesus in custody taunted him while they beat him .
CEB	Luke	22	64	They blindfolded him and asked him repeatedly , “ Prophesy ! Who hit you ? ”

CEB	Luke	22	66	As morning came , the elders of the people , both chief priests and legal experts , came together , and Jesus was brought before their council .

CEB	Luke	22	68	And if I ask you a question , you won ’ t answer .
CEB	Luke	22	69	But from now on , the Human One [ d ] will be seated on the right side of the power of God. ” [ e ]
CEB	Luke	22	70	They all said , “ Are you God ’ s Son , then ? ” He replied , “ You say that I am. ”

CEB	Luke	23	23	But they were adamant , shouting their demand that Jesus be crucified . Their voices won out .
CEB	Luke	23	2	began to accuse him . They said , “ We have found this man misleading our people , opposing the payment of taxes to Caesar , and claiming that he is the Christ , a king. ”
CEB	Luke	23	3	Pilate asked him , “ Are you the king of the Jews ? ” Jesus replied , “ That ’ s what you say. ”
CEB	Luke	23	4	Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds , “ I find no legal basis for action against this man. ”
CEB	Luke	23	5	But they objected strenuously , saying , “ He agitates the people with his teaching throughout Judea—starting from Galilee all the way here. ” Jesus before Herod
CEB	Luke	23	6	Hearing this , Pilate asked if the man was a Galilean .
CEB	Luke	23	7	When he learned that Jesus was from Herod ’ s district , Pilate sent him to Herod , who was also in Jerusalem at that time .
CEB	Luke	23	8	Herod was very glad to see Jesus , for he had heard about Jesus and had wanted to see him for quite some time . He was hoping to see Jesus perform some sign .
CEB	Luke	23	9	Herod questioned Jesus at length , but Jesus didn ’ t respond to him .
CEB	Luke	23	10	The chief priests and the legal experts were there , fiercely accusing Jesus .
CEB	Luke	23	11	Herod and his soldiers treated Jesus with contempt . Herod mocked him by dressing Jesus in elegant clothes and sent him back to Pilate .
CEB	Luke	23	12	Pilate and Herod became friends with each other that day . Before this , they had been enemies . Jesus and Barabbas
CEB	Luke	23	13	Then Pilate called together the chief priests , the rulers , and the people .
CEB	Luke	23	14	He said to them , “ You brought this man before me as one who was misleading the people . I have questioned him in your presence and found nothing in this man ’ s conduct that provides a legal basis for the charges you have brought against him .
CEB	Luke	23	15	Neither did Herod , because Herod returned him to us . He ’ s done nothing that deserves death .
CEB	Luke	23	16	Therefore , I ’ ll have him whipped , then let him go. ” [ a ]
CEB	Luke	23	18	But with one voice they shouted , “ Away with this man ! Release Barabbas to us. ” (
CEB	Luke	23	19	Barabbas had been thrown into prison because of a riot that had occurred in the city , and for murder . )
CEB	Luke	23	20	Pilate addressed them again because he wanted to release Jesus .
CEB	Luke	23	21	They kept shouting out , “ Crucify him ! Crucify him ! ”
CEB	Luke	23	22	For the third time , Pilate said to them , “ Why ? What wrong has he done ? I ’ ve found no legal basis for the death penalty in his case . Therefore , I will have him whipped , then let him go. ”
CEB	Luke	23	24	Pilate issued his decision to grant their request .
CEB	Luke	23	25	He released the one they asked for , who had been thrown into prison because of a riot and murder . But he handed Jesus over to their will . On the way to the cross
CEB	Luke	23	26	As they led Jesus away , they grabbed Simon , a man from Cyrene , who was coming in from the countryside . They put the cross on his back and made him carry it behind Jesus .
CEB	Luke	23	27	A huge crowd of people followed Jesus , including women , who were mourning and wailing for him .
CEB	Luke	23	28	Jesus turned to the women and said , “ Daughters of Jerusalem , don ’ t cry for me . Rather , cry for yourselves and your children .
CEB	Luke	23	29	The time will come when they will say , ‘ Happy are those who are unable to become pregnant , the wombs that never gave birth , and the breasts that never nursed a child. ’
CEB	Luke	23	30	Then they will say to the mountains , ‘ Fall on us , ’ and to the hills , ‘ Cover us. ’ [ b ]
CEB	Luke	23	31	If they do these things when the tree is green , what will happen when it is dry ? ” Jesus on the cross
CEB	Luke	23	32	They also led two other criminals to be executed with Jesus .
CEB	Luke	23	33	When they arrived at the place called The Skull , they crucified him , along with the criminals , one on his right and the other on his left .
CEB	Luke	23	34	Jesus said , “ Father , forgive them , for they don ’ t know what they ’ re doing. ” They drew lots as a way of dividing up his clothing .
CEB	Luke	23	35	The people were standing around watching , but the leaders sneered at him , saying , “ He saved others . Let him save himself if he really is the Christ sent from God , the chosen one. ”
CEB	Luke	23	36	The soldiers also mocked him . They came up to him , offering him sour wine
CEB	Luke	23	37	and saying , “ If you really are the king of the Jews , save yourself. ”
CEB	Luke	23	38	Above his head was a notice of the formal charge against him . It read “ This is the king of the Jews. ”
CEB	Luke	23	39	One of the criminals hanging next to Jesus insulted him : “ Aren ’ t you the Christ ? Save yourself and us ! ”
CEB	Luke	23	40	Responding , the other criminal spoke harshly to him , “ Don ’ t you fear God , seeing that you ’ ve also been sentenced to die ?
CEB	Luke	23	41	We are rightly condemned , for we are receiving the appropriate sentence for what we did . But this man has done nothing wrong. ”
CEB	Luke	23	42	Then he said , “ Jesus , remember me when you come into your kingdom. ”
CEB	Luke	23	43	Jesus replied , “ I assure you that today you will be with me in paradise. ” Jesus ’ death

CEB	Luke	23	45	while the sun stopped shining . Then the curtain in the sanctuary tore down the middle .
CEB	Luke	23	46	Crying out in a loud voice , Jesus said , “ Father , into your hands I entrust my life. ” [ c ] After he said this , he breathed for the last time .
CEB	Luke	23	47	When the centurion saw what happened , he praised God , saying , “ It ’ s really true : this man was righteous. ”
CEB	Luke	23	48	All the crowds who had come together to see this event returned to their homes beating their chests after seeing what had happened .
CEB	Luke	23	49	And everyone who knew him , including the women who had followed him from Galilee , stood at a distance observing these things . Jesus ’ burial
CEB	Luke	23	50	Now there was a man named Joseph who was a member of the council . He was a good and righteous man .
CEB	Luke	23	51	He hadn ’ t agreed with the plan and actions of the council . He was from the Jewish city of Arimathea and eagerly anticipated God ’ s kingdom .
CEB	Luke	23	52	This man went to Pilate and asked for Jesus ’ body .
CEB	Luke	23	53	Taking it down , he wrapped it in a linen cloth and laid it in a tomb carved out of the rock , in which no one had ever been buried .
CEB	Luke	23	54	It was the Preparation Day for the Sabbath , and the Sabbath was quickly approaching .
CEB	Luke	23	55	The women who had come with Jesus from Galilee followed Joseph . They saw the tomb and how Jesus ’ body was laid in it ,
CEB	Luke	23	56	then they went away and prepared fragrant spices and perfumed oils . They rested on the Sabbath , in keeping with the commandment .

CEB	Luke	24	24	Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found things just as the women said . They didn ’ t see him. ”
CEB	Luke	24	2	They found the stone rolled away from the tomb ,
CEB	Luke	24	3	but when they went in , they didn ’ t find the body of the Lord Jesus .
CEB	Luke	24	4	They didn ’ t know what to make of this . Suddenly , two men were standing beside them in gleaming bright clothing .
CEB	Luke	24	5	The women were frightened and bowed their faces toward the ground , but the men said to them , “ Why do you look for the living among the dead ?
CEB	Luke	24	6	He isn ’ t here , but has been raised . Remember what he told you while he was still in Galilee ,
CEB	Luke	24	7	that the Human One [ a ] must be handed over to sinners , be crucified , and on the third day rise again. ”
CEB	Luke	24	8	Then they remembered his words .
CEB	Luke	24	9	When they returned from the tomb , they reported all these things to the eleven and all the others .
CEB	Luke	24	10	It was Mary Magdalene , Joanna , Mary the mother of James , and the other women with them who told these things to the apostles .
CEB	Luke	24	11	Their words struck the apostles as nonsense , and they didn ’ t believe the women .
CEB	Luke	24	12	But Peter ran to the tomb . When he bent over to look inside , he saw only the linen cloth . Then he returned home , wondering what had happened . Encounter on the Emmaus road
CEB	Luke	24	13	On that same day , two disciples were traveling to a village called Emmaus , about seven miles from Jerusalem .
CEB	Luke	24	14	They were talking to each other about everything that had happened .
CEB	Luke	24	15	While they were discussing these things , Jesus himself arrived and joined them on their journey .
CEB	Luke	24	16	They were prevented from recognizing him .
CEB	Luke	24	17	He said to them , “ What are you talking about as you walk along ? ” They stopped , their faces downcast .
CEB	Luke	24	18	The one named Cleopas replied , “ Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who is unaware of the things that have taken place there over the last few days ? ”
CEB	Luke	24	19	He said to them , “ What things ? ” They said to him , “ The things about Jesus of Nazareth . Because of his powerful deeds and words , he was recognized by God and all the people as a prophet .
CEB	Luke	24	20	But our chief priests and our leaders handed him over to be sentenced to death , and they crucified him .
CEB	Luke	24	21	We had hoped he was the one who would redeem Israel . All these things happened three days ago .
CEB	Luke	24	22	But there ’ s more : Some women from our group have left us stunned . They went to the tomb early this morning
CEB	Luke	24	23	and didn ’ t find his body . They came to us saying that they had even seen a vision of angels who told them he is alive .
CEB	Luke	24	25	Then Jesus said to them , “ You foolish people ! Your dull minds keep you from believing all that the prophets talked about .
CEB	Luke	24	26	Wasn ’ t it necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and then enter into his glory ? ”
CEB	Luke	24	27	Then he interpreted for them the things written about himself in all the scriptures , starting with Moses and going through all the Prophets .
CEB	Luke	24	28	When they came to Emmaus , he acted as if he was going on ahead .
CEB	Luke	24	29	But they urged him , saying , “ Stay with us . It ’ s nearly evening , and the day is almost over. ” So he went in to stay with them .
CEB	Luke	24	30	After he took his seat at the table with them , he took the bread , blessed and broke it , and gave it to them .
CEB	Luke	24	31	Their eyes were opened and they recognized him , but he disappeared from their sight .
CEB	Luke	24	32	They said to each other , “ Weren ’ t our hearts on fire when he spoke to us along the road and when he explained the scriptures for us ? ”
CEB	Luke	24	33	They got up right then and returned to Jerusalem . They found the eleven and their companions gathered together .
CEB	Luke	24	34	They were saying to each other , “ The Lord really has risen ! He appeared to Simon ! ”
CEB	Luke	24	35	Then the two disciples described what had happened along the road and how Jesus was made known to them as he broke the bread . Jesus appears to the disciples
CEB	Luke	24	36	While they were saying these things , Jesus himself stood among them and said , “ Peace be with you ! ”
CEB	Luke	24	37	They were terrified and afraid . They thought they were seeing a ghost .
CEB	Luke	24	38	He said to them , “ Why are you startled ? Why are doubts arising in your hearts ?
CEB	Luke	24	39	Look at my hands and my feet . It ’ s really me ! Touch me and see , for a ghost doesn ’ t have flesh and bones like you see I have. ”
CEB	Luke	24	40	As he said this , he showed them his hands and feet .
CEB	Luke	24	41	Because they were wondering and questioning in the midst of their happiness , he said to them , “ Do you have anything to eat ? ”
CEB	Luke	24	42	They gave him a piece of baked fish .
CEB	Luke	24	43	Taking it , he ate it in front of them .
CEB	Luke	24	44	Jesus said to them , “ These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you—that everything written about me in the Law from Moses , the Prophets , and the Psalms must be fulfilled. ”
CEB	Luke	24	45	Then he opened their minds to understand the scriptures .
CEB	Luke	24	46	He said to them , “ This is what is written : the Christ will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day ,
CEB	Luke	24	47	and a change of heart and life for the forgiveness of sins must be preached in his name to all nations , beginning from Jerusalem .
CEB	Luke	24	48	You are witnesses of these things .
CEB	Luke	24	49	Look , I ’ m sending to you what my Father promised , but you are to stay in the city until you have been furnished with heavenly power. ” Ascension of Jesus
CEB	Luke	24	50	He led them out as far as Bethany , where he lifted his hands and blessed them .
CEB	Luke	24	51	As he blessed them , he left them and was taken up to heaven .
CEB	Luke	24	52	They worshipped him and returned to Jerusalem overwhelmed with joy .

CEB	John	1	17	as the Law was given through Moses , so grace and truth came into being through Jesus Christ .
CEB	John	1	18	No one has ever seen God . God the only Son , who is at the Father ’ s side , has made God known . John ’ s witness
CEB	John	1	19	This is John ’ s testimony when the Jewish leaders in Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him , “ Who are you ? ”
CEB	John	1	20	John confessed ( he didn ’ t deny but confessed ) , “ I ’ m not the Christ. ”
CEB	John	1	21	They asked him , “ Then who are you ? Are you Elijah ? ” John said , “ I ’ m not. ” “ Are you the prophet ? ” John answered , “ No. ”
CEB	John	1	22	They asked , “ Who are you ? We need to give an answer to those who sent us . What do you say about yourself ? ”
CEB	John	1	23	John replied , “ I am a voice crying out in the wilderness , Make the Lord ’ s path straight , [ b ] just as the prophet Isaiah said. ”
CEB	John	1	24	Those sent by the Pharisees
CEB	John	1	25	asked , “ Why do you baptize if you aren ’ t the Christ , nor Elijah , nor the prophet ? ”
CEB	John	1	26	John answered , “ I baptize with water . Someone greater stands among you , whom you don ’ t recognize .
CEB	John	1	27	He comes after me , but I ’ m not worthy to untie his sandal straps. ”
CEB	John	1	28	This encounter took place across the Jordan in Bethany where John was baptizing .
CEB	John	1	29	The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said , “ Look ! The Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world !
CEB	John	1	30	This is the one about whom I said , ‘ He who comes after me is really greater than me because he existed before me. ’
CEB	John	1	31	Even I didn ’ t recognize him , but I came baptizing with water so that he might be made known to Israel. ”
CEB	John	1	32	John testified , “ I saw the Spirit coming down from heaven like a dove , and it rested on him .
CEB	John	1	33	Even I didn ’ t recognize him , but the one who sent me to baptize with water said to me , ‘ The one on whom you see the Spirit coming down and resting is the one who baptizes with the Holy Spirit. ’
CEB	John	1	34	I have seen and testified that this one is God ’ s Son. ” Jesus calls disciples
CEB	John	1	35	The next day John was standing again with two of his disciples .
CEB	John	1	36	When he saw Jesus walking along he said , “ Look ! The Lamb of God ! ”
CEB	John	1	37	The two disciples heard what he said , and they followed Jesus .
CEB	John	1	38	When Jesus turned and saw them following , he asked , “ What are you looking for ? ” They said , “ Rabbi ( which is translated Teacher ) , where are you staying ? ”
CEB	John	1	39	He replied , “ Come and see. ” So they went and saw where he was staying , and they remained with him that day . It was about four o ’ clock in the afternoon .
CEB	John	1	40	One of the two disciples who heard what John said and followed Jesus was Andrew , the brother of Simon Peter .
CEB	John	1	41	He first found his own brother Simon and said to him , “ We have found the Messiah ” ( which is translated Christ [ c ] ) .
CEB	John	1	42	He led him to Jesus . Jesus looked at him and said , “ You are Simon , son of John . You will be called Cephas ” ( which is translated Peter ) .
CEB	John	1	43	The next day Jesus wanted to go into Galilee , and he found Philip . Jesus said to him , “ Follow me. ”
CEB	John	1	44	Philip was from Bethsaida , the hometown of Andrew and Peter .
CEB	John	1	45	Philip found Nathanael and said to him , “ We have found the one Moses wrote about in the Law and the Prophets : Jesus , Joseph ’ s son , from Nazareth. ”
CEB	John	1	46	Nathanael responded , “ Can anything from Nazareth be good ? ” Philip said , “ Come and see. ”
CEB	John	1	47	Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and said about him , “ Here is a genuine Israelite in whom there is no deceit. ”
CEB	John	1	48	Nathanael asked him , “ How do you know me ? ” Jesus answered , “ Before Philip called you , I saw you under the fig tree. ”
CEB	John	1	49	Nathanael replied , “ Rabbi , you are God ’ s Son . You are the king of Israel. ”
CEB	John	1	50	Jesus answered , “ Do you believe because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree ? You will see greater things than these !
CEB	John	1	51	I assure you that you will see heaven open and God ’ s angels going up to heaven and down to earth on the Human One. ” [ d ]
CEB	John	2	2	Jesus and his disciples were also invited to the celebration .
CEB	John	2	3	When the wine ran out , Jesus ’ mother said to him , “ They don ’ t have any wine. ”
CEB	John	2	4	Jesus replied , “ Woman , what does that have to do with me ? My time hasn ’ t come yet. ”
CEB	John	2	5	His mother told the servants , “ Do whatever he tells you. ”
CEB	John	2	6	Nearby were six stone water jars used for the Jewish cleansing ritual , each able to hold about twenty or thirty gallons .
CEB	John	2	7	Jesus said to the servants , “ Fill the jars with water , ” and they filled them to the brim .
CEB	John	2	8	Then he told them , “ Now draw some from them and take it to the headwaiter , ” and they did .
CEB	John	2	9	The headwaiter tasted the water that had become wine . He didn ’ t know where it came from , though the servants who had drawn the water knew . The headwaiter called the groom
CEB	John	2	10	and said , “ Everyone serves the good wine first . They bring out the second-rate wine only when the guests are drinking freely . You kept the good wine until now. ”
CEB	John	2	11	This was the first miraculous sign that Jesus did in Cana of Galilee . He revealed his glory , and his disciples believed in him .
CEB	John	2	12	After this , Jesus and his mother , his brothers , and his disciples went down to Capernaum and stayed there for a few days . Jesus in Jerusalem at Passover
CEB	John	2	13	It was nearly time for the Jewish Passover , and Jesus went up to Jerusalem .
CEB	John	2	14	He found in the temple those who were selling cattle , sheep , and doves , as well as those involved in exchanging currency sitting there .
CEB	John	2	15	He made a whip from ropes and chased them all out of the temple , including the cattle and the sheep . He scattered the coins and overturned the tables of those who exchanged currency .
CEB	John	2	16	He said to the dove sellers , “ Get these things out of here ! Don ’ t make my Father ’ s house a place of business. ”
CEB	John	2	17	His disciples remembered that it is written , Passion for your house consumes me . [ a ]
CEB	John	2	18	Then the Jewish leaders asked him , “ By what authority are you doing these things ? What miraculous sign will you show us ? ”
CEB	John	2	19	Jesus answered , “ Destroy this temple and in three days I ’ ll raise it up. ”
CEB	John	2	20	The Jewish leaders replied , “ It took forty-six years to build this temple , and you will raise it up in three days ? ”
CEB	John	2	21	But the temple Jesus was talking about was his body .
CEB	John	2	22	After he was raised from the dead , his disciples remembered what he had said , and they believed the scripture and the word that Jesus had spoken .
CEB	John	2	23	While Jesus was in Jerusalem for the Passover Festival , many believed in his name because they saw the miraculous signs that he did .
CEB	John	2	24	But Jesus didn ’ t trust himself to them because he knew all people .
CEB	John	2	25	He didn ’ t need anyone to tell him about human nature , for he knew what human nature was .
CEB	John	3	3	Jesus answered , “ I assure you , unless someone is born anew , [ a ] it ’ s not possible to see God ’ s kingdom. ”
CEB	John	3	2	He came to Jesus at night and said to him , “ Rabbi , we know that you are a teacher who has come from God , for no one could do these miraculous signs that you do unless God is with him. ”
CEB	John	3	4	Nicodemus asked , “ How is it possible for an adult to be born ? It ’ s impossible to enter the mother ’ s womb for a second time and be born , isn ’ t it ? ”
CEB	John	3	5	Jesus answered , “ I assure you , unless someone is born of water and the Spirit , it ’ s not possible to enter God ’ s kingdom .
CEB	John	3	6	Whatever is born of the flesh is flesh , and whatever is born of the Spirit is spirit .
CEB	John	3	7	Don ’ t be surprised that I said to you , ‘ You must be born anew. ’
CEB	John	3	8	God ’ s Spirit [ b ] blows wherever it wishes . You hear its sound , but you don ’ t know where it comes from or where it is going . It ’ s the same with everyone who is born of the Spirit. ”
CEB	John	3	9	Nicodemus said , “ How are these things possible ? ”
CEB	John	3	10	“ Jesus answered , “ You are a teacher of Israel and you don ’ t know these things ?
CEB	John	3	11	I assure you that we speak about what we know and testify about what we have seen , but you don ’ t receive our testimony .
CEB	John	3	12	If I have told you about earthly things and you don ’ t believe , how will you believe if I tell you about heavenly things ?
CEB	John	3	13	No one has gone up to heaven except the one who came down from heaven , the Human One . [ c ]
CEB	John	3	14	Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness , so must the Human One [ d ] be lifted up
CEB	John	3	15	so that everyone who believes in him will have eternal life .
CEB	John	3	16	God so loved the world that he gave his only Son , so that everyone who believes in him won ’ t perish but will have eternal life .
CEB	John	3	17	God didn ’ t send his Son into the world to judge the world , but that the world might be saved through him .
CEB	John	3	18	Whoever believes in him isn ’ t judged ; whoever doesn ’ t believe in him is already judged , because they don ’ t believe in the name of God ’ s only Son .
CEB	John	3	19	“ This is the basis for judgment : The light came into the world , and people loved darkness more than the light , for their actions are evil .
CEB	John	3	20	All who do wicked things hate the light and don ’ t come to the light for fear that their actions will be exposed to the light .
CEB	John	3	21	Whoever does the truth comes to the light so that it can be seen that their actions were done in God. ” John ’ s final witness
CEB	John	3	22	After this Jesus and his disciples went into Judea , where he spent some time with them and was baptizing .
CEB	John	3	23	John was baptizing at Aenon near Salem because there was a lot of water there , and people were coming to him and being baptized . (
CEB	John	3	24	John hadn ’ t yet been thrown into prison . )
CEB	John	3	25	A debate started between John ’ s disciples and a certain Jew about cleansing rituals .
CEB	John	3	26	They came to John and said , “ Rabbi , look ! The man who was with you across the Jordan , the one about whom you testified , is baptizing and everyone is flocking to him. ”
CEB	John	3	27	John replied , “ No one can receive anything unless it is given from heaven .
CEB	John	3	28	You yourselves can testify that I said that I ’ m not the Christ but that I ’ m the one sent before him .
CEB	John	3	29	The groom is the one who is getting married . The friend of the groom stands close by and , when he hears him , is overjoyed at the groom ’ s voice . Therefore , my joy is now complete .
CEB	John	3	30	He must increase and I must decrease .
CEB	John	3	31	The one who comes from above is above all things . The one who is from the earth belongs to the earth and speaks as one from the earth . The one who comes from heaven is above all things .
CEB	John	3	32	He testifies to what he has seen and heard , but no one accepts his testimony .
CEB	John	3	33	Whoever accepts his testimony confirms that God is true .
CEB	John	3	34	The one whom God sent speaks God ’ s words because God gives the Spirit generously .
CEB	John	3	35	The Father loves the Son and gives everything into his hands .
CEB	John	3	36	Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life . Whoever doesn ’ t believe in the Son won ’ t see life , but the angry judgment of God remains on them . ”
CEB	John	4	4	Jesus had to go through Samaria .
CEB	John	4	2	although Jesus ’ disciples were baptizing , not Jesus himself ) .
CEB	John	4	3	Therefore , he left Judea and went back to Galilee . Jesus in Samaria
CEB	John	4	5	He came to a Samaritan city called Sychar , which was near the land Jacob had given to his son Joseph .
CEB	John	4	6	Jacob ’ s well was there . Jesus was tired from his journey , so he sat down at the well . It was about noon .
CEB	John	4	7	A Samaritan woman came to the well to draw water . Jesus said to her , “ Give me some water to drink. ”
CEB	John	4	8	His disciples had gone into the city to buy him some food .
CEB	John	4	9	The Samaritan woman asked , “ Why do you , a Jewish man , ask for something to drink from me , a Samaritan woman ? ” ( Jews and Samaritans didn ’ t associate with each other . )
CEB	John	4	10	Jesus responded , “ If you recognized God ’ s gift and who is saying to you , ‘ Give me some water to drink , ’ you would be asking him and he would give you living water. ”
CEB	John	4	11	The woman said to him , “ Sir , you don ’ t have a bucket and the well is deep . Where would you get this living water ?
CEB	John	4	12	You aren ’ t greater than our father Jacob , are you ? He gave this well to us , and he drank from it himself , as did his sons and his livestock. ”
CEB	John	4	13	Jesus answered , “ Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again ,
CEB	John	4	14	but whoever drinks from the water that I will give will never be thirsty again . The water that I give will become in those who drink it a spring of water that bubbles up into eternal life. ”
CEB	John	4	15	The woman said to him , “ Sir , give me this water , so that I will never be thirsty and will never need to come here to draw water ! ”
CEB	John	4	16	Jesus said to her , “ Go , get your husband , and come back here. ”
CEB	John	4	17	The woman replied , “ I don ’ t have a husband. ” “ You are right to say , ‘ I don ’ t have a husband , ’ ” Jesus answered .
CEB	John	4	18	“ You ’ ve had five husbands , and the man you are with now isn ’ t your husband . You ’ ve spoken the truth. ”
CEB	John	4	19	The woman said , “ Sir , I see that you are a prophet .
CEB	John	4	20	Our ancestors worshipped on this mountain , but you and your people say that it is necessary to worship in Jerusalem. ”
CEB	John	4	21	Jesus said to her , “ Believe me , woman , the time is coming when you and your people will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem .
CEB	John	4	22	You and your people worship what you don ’ t know ; we worship what we know because salvation is from the Jews .
CEB	John	4	23	But the time is coming—and is here ! —when true worshippers will worship in spirit and truth . The Father looks for those who worship him this way .
CEB	John	4	24	God is spirit , and it is necessary to worship God in spirit and truth. ”
CEB	John	4	25	The woman said , “ I know that the Messiah is coming , the one who is called the Christ . When he comes , he will teach everything to us. ”
CEB	John	4	26	Jesus said to her , “ I Am—the one who speaks with you. ” [ a ]
CEB	John	4	27	Just then , Jesus ’ disciples arrived and were shocked that he was talking with a woman . But no one asked , “ What do you want ? ” or “ Why are you talking with her ? ”
CEB	John	4	28	The woman put down her water jar and went into the city . She said to the people ,
CEB	John	4	29	“ Come and see a man who has told me everything I ’ ve done ! Could this man be the Christ ? ”
CEB	John	4	30	They left the city and were on their way to see Jesus .
CEB	John	4	31	In the meantime the disciples spoke to Jesus , saying , “ Rabbi , eat. ”
CEB	John	4	32	Jesus said to them , “ I have food to eat that you don ’ t know about. ”
CEB	John	4	33	The disciples asked each other , “ Has someone brought him food ? ”
CEB	John	4	34	Jesus said to them , “ I am fed by doing the will of the one who sent me and by completing his work .
CEB	John	4	35	Don ’ t you have a saying , ‘ Four more months and then it ’ s time for harvest ’ ? Look , I tell you : open your eyes and notice that the fields are already ripe for the harvest .
CEB	John	4	36	Those who harvest are receiving their pay and gathering fruit for eternal life so that those who sow and those who harvest can celebrate together .
CEB	John	4	37	This is a true saying , that one sows and another harvests .
CEB	John	4	38	I have sent you to harvest what you didn ’ t work hard for ; others worked hard , and you will share in their hard work. ”
CEB	John	4	39	Many Samaritans in that city believed in Jesus because of the woman ’ s word when she testified , “ He told me everything I ’ ve ever done. ”
CEB	John	4	40	So when the Samaritans came to Jesus , they asked him to stay with them , and he stayed there two days .
CEB	John	4	41	Many more believed because of his word ,
CEB	John	4	42	and they said to the woman , “ We no longer believe because of what you said , for we have heard for ourselves and know that this one is truly the savior of the world. ” Jesus arrives in Galilee
CEB	John	4	43	After two days Jesus left for Galilee . (
CEB	John	4	44	Jesus himself had testified that prophets have no honor in their own country . )
CEB	John	4	45	When he came to Galilee , the Galileans welcomed him because they had seen all the things he had done in Jerusalem during the festival , for they also had been at the festival . Jesus ’ second miraculous sign in Galilee
CEB	John	4	46	He returned to Cana in Galilee where he had turned the water into wine . In Capernaum there was a certain royal official whose son was sick .
CEB	John	4	47	When he heard that Jesus was coming from Judea to Galilee , he went out to meet him and asked Jesus if he would come and heal his son , for his son was about to die .
CEB	John	4	48	Jesus said to him , “ Unless you see miraculous signs and wonders , you won ’ t believe. ”
CEB	John	4	49	The royal official said to him , “ Lord , come before my son dies. ”
CEB	John	4	50	Jesus replied , “ Go home . Your son lives. ” The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and set out for his home .
CEB	John	4	51	While he was on his way , his servants were already coming to meet him . They said , “ Your son lives ! ”
CEB	John	4	52	So he asked them at what time his son had started to get better . And they said , “ The fever left him yesterday at about one o ’ clock in the afternoon. ”
CEB	John	4	53	Then the father realized that this was the hour when Jesus had said to him , “ Your son lives. ” And he and his entire household believed in Jesus .
CEB	John	4	54	This was the second miraculous sign Jesus did while going from Judea to Galilee . Footnotes - John 4:26 Or It is I , the one who speaks with you .
CEB	John	5	5	A certain man was there who had been sick for thirty-eight years .
CEB	John	5	2	In Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate in the north city wall is a pool with the Aramaic name Bethsaida . It had five covered porches ,
CEB	John	5	3	and a crowd of people who were sick , blind , lame , and paralyzed sat there . [ a ]
CEB	John	5	6	When Jesus saw him lying there , knowing that he had already been there a long time , he asked him , “ Do you want to get well ? ”
CEB	John	5	7	The sick man answered him , “ Sir , [ b ] I don ’ t have anyone who can put me in the water when it is stirred up . When I ’ m trying to get to it , someone else has gotten in ahead of me. ”
CEB	John	5	8	Jesus said to him , “ Get up ! Pick up your mat and walk. ”
CEB	John	5	9	Immediately the man was well , and he picked up his mat and walked . Now that day was the Sabbath .
CEB	John	5	10	The Jewish leaders said to the man who had been healed , “ It ’ s the Sabbath ; you aren ’ t allowed to carry your mat. ”
CEB	John	5	11	He answered , “ The man who made me well said to me , ‘ Pick up your mat and walk. ’ ”
CEB	John	5	12	They inquired , “ Who is this man who said to you , ‘ Pick it up and walk ’ ? ”
CEB	John	5	13	The man who had been cured didn ’ t know who it was , because Jesus had slipped away from the crowd gathered there .
CEB	John	5	14	Later Jesus found him in the temple and said , “ See ! You have been made well . Don ’ t sin anymore in case something worse happens to you. ”
CEB	John	5	15	The man went and proclaimed to the Jewish leaders that Jesus was the man who had made him well .
CEB	John	5	16	As a result , the Jewish leaders were harassing Jesus , since he had done these things on the Sabbath .
CEB	John	5	17	Jesus replied , “ My Father is still working , and I am working too. ”
CEB	John	5	18	For this reason the Jewish leaders wanted even more to kill him—not only because he was doing away with the Sabbath but also because he called God his own Father , thereby making himself equal with God . Work of the Father and the Son
CEB	John	5	19	Jesus responded to the Jewish leaders , “ I assure you that the Son can ’ t do anything by himself except what he sees the Father doing . Whatever the Father does , the Son does likewise .
CEB	John	5	20	The Father loves the Son and shows him everything that he does . He will show him greater works than these so that you will marvel .
CEB	John	5	21	As the Father raises the dead and gives life , so too does the Son give life to whomever he wishes .
CEB	John	5	22	The Father doesn ’ t judge anyone , but he has given all judgment to the Son
CEB	John	5	23	so that everyone will honor the Son just as they honor the Father . Whoever doesn ’ t honor the Son doesn ’ t honor the Father who sent him .
CEB	John	5	24	“ I assure you that whoever hears my word and believes in the one who sent me has eternal life and won ’ t come under judgment but has passed from death into life .
CEB	John	5	25	“ I assure you that the time is coming—and is here ! —when the dead will hear the voice of God ’ s Son , and those who hear it will live .
CEB	John	5	26	Just as the Father has life in himself , so he has granted the Son to have life in himself .
CEB	John	5	27	He gives the Son authority to judge , because he is the Human One . [ c ]
CEB	John	5	28	Don ’ t be surprised by this , because the time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice .
CEB	John	5	29	Those who did good things will come out into the resurrection of life , and those who did wicked things into the resurrection of judgment .
CEB	John	5	30	I can ’ t do anything by myself . Whatever I hear , I judge , and my judgment is just . I don ’ t seek my own will but the will of the one who sent me . Witnesses to Jesus
CEB	John	5	31	“ If I testify about myself , my testimony isn ’ t true .
CEB	John	5	32	There is someone else who testifies about me , and I know his testimony about me is true .
CEB	John	5	33	You sent a delegation to John , and he testified to the truth .
CEB	John	5	34	Although I don ’ t accept human testimony , I say these things so that you can be saved .
CEB	John	5	35	John was a burning and shining lamp , and , at least for a while , you were willing to celebrate in his light .
CEB	John	5	36	“ I have a witness greater than John ’ s testimony . The Father has given me works to do so that I might complete them . These works I do testify about me that the Father sent me .
CEB	John	5	37	And the Father who sent me testifies about me . You have never even heard his voice or seen his form ,
CEB	John	5	38	and you don ’ t have his word dwelling with you because you don ’ t believe the one whom he has sent .
CEB	John	5	39	Examine the scriptures , since you think that in them you have eternal life . They also testify about me ,
CEB	John	5	40	yet you don ’ t want to come to me so that you can have life .
CEB	John	5	41	“ I don ’ t accept praise from people ,
CEB	John	5	42	but I know you , that you don ’ t have God ’ s love in you .
CEB	John	5	43	I have come in my Father ’ s name , and you don ’ t receive me . If others come in their own name , you receive them .
CEB	John	5	44	How can you believe when you receive praise from each other but don ’ t seek the praise that comes from the only God ?
CEB	John	5	45	“ Don ’ t think that I will accuse you before the Father . Your accuser is Moses , the one in whom your hope rests .
CEB	John	5	46	If you believed Moses , you would believe me , because Moses wrote about me .
CEB	John	5	47	If you don ’ t believe the writings of Moses , how will you believe my words ? ” Footnotes - John 5:3 Critical editions of the Gk New Testament do not include the following addition waiting for the water to move .
CEB	John	5	4	Sometimes an angel would come down to the pool and stir up the water . Then the first one going into the water after it had been stirred up was cured of any sickness . - John 5:7 Or Lord - John 5:27 Or Son of Man
CEB	John	6	6	Jesus said this to test him , for he already knew what he was going to do .
CEB	John	6	2	A large crowd followed him , because they had seen the miraculous signs he had done among the sick .
CEB	John	6	3	Jesus went up a mountain and sat there with his disciples .
CEB	John	6	4	It was nearly time for Passover , the Jewish festival .
CEB	John	6	5	Jesus looked up and saw the large crowd coming toward him . He asked Philip , “ Where will we buy food to feed these people ? ”
CEB	John	6	7	Philip replied , “ More than a half year ’ s salary [ a ] worth of food wouldn ’ t be enough for each person to have even a little bit. ”
CEB	John	6	8	One of his disciples , Andrew , Simon Peter ’ s brother , said ,
CEB	John	6	9	“ A youth here has five barley loaves and two fish . But what good is that for a crowd like this ? ”
CEB	John	6	10	Jesus said , “ Have the people sit down. ” There was plenty of grass there . They sat down , about five thousand of them .
CEB	John	6	11	Then Jesus took the bread . When he had given thanks , he distributed it to those who were sitting there . He did the same with the fish , each getting as much as they wanted .
CEB	John	6	12	When they had plenty to eat , he said to his disciples , “ Gather up the leftover pieces , so that nothing will be wasted. ”
CEB	John	6	13	So they gathered them and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves that had been left over by those who had eaten .
CEB	John	6	14	When the people saw that he had done a miraculous sign , they said , “ This is truly the prophet who is coming into the world. ”
CEB	John	6	15	Jesus understood that they were about to come and force him to be their king , so he took refuge again , alone on a mountain . Jesus walks on water
CEB	John	6	16	When evening came , Jesus ’ disciples went down to the lake .
CEB	John	6	17	They got into a boat and were crossing the lake to Capernaum . It was already getting dark and Jesus hadn ’ t come to them yet .
CEB	John	6	18	The water was getting rough because a strong wind was blowing .
CEB	John	6	19	When the wind had driven them out for about three or four miles , they saw Jesus walking on the water . He was approaching the boat and they were afraid .
CEB	John	6	20	He said to them , “ I Am . [ b ] Don ’ t be afraid. ”
CEB	John	6	21	Then they wanted to take him into the boat , and just then the boat reached the land where they had been heading .
CEB	John	6	22	The next day the crowd that remained on the other side of the lake realized that only one boat had been there . They knew Jesus hadn ’ t gone with his disciples , but that the disciples had gone alone .
CEB	John	6	23	Some boats came from Tiberias , near the place where they had eaten the bread over which the Lord had given thanks .
CEB	John	6	24	When the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there , they got into the boats and came to Capernaum looking for Jesus .
CEB	John	6	25	When they found him on the other side of the lake , they asked him , “ Rabbi , when did you get here ? ” Bread of life
CEB	John	6	26	Jesus replied , “ I assure you that you are looking for me not because you saw miraculous signs but because you ate all the food you wanted .
CEB	John	6	27	Don ’ t work for the food that doesn ’ t last but for the food that endures for eternal life , which the Human One [ c ] will give you . God the Father has confirmed him as his agent to give life. ”
CEB	John	6	28	They asked , “ What must we do in order to accomplish what God requires ? ”
CEB	John	6	29	Jesus replied , “ This is what God requires , that you believe in him whom God sent. ”
CEB	John	6	30	They asked , “ What miraculous sign will you do , that we can see and believe you ? What will you do ?
CEB	John	6	31	Our ancestors ate manna in the wilderness , just as it is written , He gave them bread from heaven to eat. ” [ d ]
CEB	John	6	32	Jesus told them , “ I assure you , it wasn ’ t Moses who gave the bread from heaven to you , but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven .
CEB	John	6	33	The bread of God is the one who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world. ”
CEB	John	6	34	They said , “ Sir , [ e ] give us this bread all the time ! ”
CEB	John	6	35	Jesus replied , “ I am the bread of life . Whoever comes to me will never go hungry , and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty .
CEB	John	6	36	But I told you that you have seen me and still don ’ t believe .
CEB	John	6	37	Everyone whom the Father gives to me will come to me , and I won ’ t send away anyone who comes to me .
CEB	John	6	38	I have come down from heaven not to do my will , but the will of him who sent me .
CEB	John	6	39	This is the will of the one who sent me , that I won ’ t lose anything he has given me , but I will raise it up at the last day .
CEB	John	6	40	This is my Father ’ s will : that all who see the Son and believe in him will have eternal life , and I will raise them up at the last day. ”
CEB	John	6	41	The Jewish opposition grumbled about him because he said , “ I am the bread that came down from heaven. ”
CEB	John	6	42	They asked , “ Isn ’ t this Jesus , Joseph ’ s son , whose mother and father we know ? How can he now say , ‘ I have come down from heaven ’ ? ”
CEB	John	6	43	Jesus responded , “ Don ’ t grumble among yourselves .
CEB	John	6	44	No one can come to me unless they are drawn to me by the Father who sent me , and I will raise them up at the last day .
CEB	John	6	45	It is written in the Prophets , And they will all be taught by God . [ f ] Everyone who has listened to the Father and learned from him comes to me .
CEB	John	6	46	No one has seen the Father except the one who is from God . He has seen the Father .
CEB	John	6	47	I assure you , whoever believes has eternal life .
CEB	John	6	48	I am the bread of life .
CEB	John	6	49	Your ancestors ate manna in the wilderness and they died .
CEB	John	6	50	This is the bread that comes down from heaven so that whoever eats from it will never die .
CEB	John	6	51	I am the living bread that came down from heaven . Whoever eats this bread will live forever , and the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh. ”
CEB	John	6	52	Then the Jews debated among themselves , asking , “ How can this man give us his flesh to eat ? ”
CEB	John	6	53	Jesus said to them , “ I assure you , unless you eat the flesh of the Human One [ g ] and drink his blood , you have no life in you .
CEB	John	6	54	Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life , and I will raise them up at the last day .
CEB	John	6	55	My flesh is true food and my blood is true drink .
CEB	John	6	56	Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me and I in them .
CEB	John	6	57	As the living Father sent me , and I live because of the Father , so whoever eats me lives because of me .
CEB	John	6	58	This is the bread that came down from heaven . It isn ’ t like the bread your ancestors ate , and then they died . Whoever eats this bread will live forever. ”
CEB	John	6	59	Jesus said these things while he was teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum .
CEB	John	6	60	Many of his disciples who heard this said , “ This message is harsh . Who can hear it ? ”
CEB	John	6	61	Jesus knew that the disciples were grumbling about this and he said to them , “ Does this offend you ?
CEB	John	6	62	What if you were to see the Human One [ h ] going up where he was before ?
CEB	John	6	63	The Spirit is the one who gives life and the flesh doesn ’ t help at all . The words I have spoken to you are spirit and life .
CEB	John	6	64	Yet some of you don ’ t believe. ” Jesus knew from the beginning who wouldn ’ t believe and the one who would betray him .
CEB	John	6	65	He said , “ For this reason I said to you that none can come to me unless the Father enables them to do so. ”
CEB	John	6	66	At this , many of his disciples turned away and no longer accompanied him .
CEB	John	6	67	Jesus asked the Twelve , “ Do you also want to leave ? ”
CEB	John	6	68	Simon Peter answered , “ Lord , where would we go ? You have the words of eternal life .
CEB	John	6	69	We believe and know that you are God ’ s holy one. ”
CEB	John	6	70	Jesus replied , “ Didn ’ t I choose you twelve ? Yet one of you is a devil. ”
CEB	John	6	71	He was speaking of Judas , Simon Iscariot ’ s son , for he , one of the Twelve , was going to betray him .
CEB	John	7	7	The world can ’ t hate you . It hates me , though , because I testify that its works are evil .
CEB	John	7	2	When it was almost time for the Jewish Festival of Booths ,
CEB	John	7	3	Jesus ’ brothers said to him , “ Leave Galilee . Go to Judea so that your disciples can see the amazing works that you do .
CEB	John	7	4	Those who want to be known publicly don ’ t do things secretly . Since you can do these things , show yourself to the world. ”
CEB	John	7	5	His brothers said this because even they didn ’ t believe in him .
CEB	John	7	6	Jesus replied , “ For you , anytime is fine . But my time hasn ’ t come yet .
CEB	John	7	8	You go up to the festival . I ’ m not going to this one because my time hasn ’ t yet come. ”
CEB	John	7	9	Having said this , he stayed in Galilee .
CEB	John	7	10	However , after his brothers left for the festival , he went too—not openly but in secret .
CEB	John	7	11	The Jewish leaders were looking for Jesus at the festival . They kept asking , “ Where is he ? ”
CEB	John	7	12	The crowds were murmuring about him . “ He ’ s a good man , ” some said , but others were saying , “ No , he tricks the people. ”
CEB	John	7	13	No one spoke about him publicly , though , for fear of the Jewish authorities . Jesus teaches in the temple
CEB	John	7	14	Halfway through the festival , Jesus went up to the temple and started to teach .
CEB	John	7	15	Astonished , the Jewish leaders asked , “ He ’ s never been taught ! How has he mastered the Law ? ”
CEB	John	7	16	Jesus responded , “ My teaching isn ’ t mine but comes from the one who sent me .
CEB	John	7	17	Whoever wants to do God ’ s will can tell whether my teaching is from God or whether I speak on my own .
CEB	John	7	18	Those who speak on their own seek glory for themselves . Those who seek the glory of him who sent me are people of truth ; there ’ s no falsehood in them .
CEB	John	7	19	Didn ’ t Moses give you the Law ? Yet none of you keep the Law . Why do you want to kill me ? ”
CEB	John	7	20	The crowd answered , “ You have a demon . Who wants to kill you ? ”
CEB	John	7	21	Jesus replied , “ I did one work , and you were all astonished .
CEB	John	7	22	Because Moses gave you the commandment about circumcision ( although it wasn ’ t Moses but the patriarchs ) , you circumcise a man on the Sabbath .
CEB	John	7	23	If a man can be circumcised on the Sabbath without breaking Moses ’ Law , why are you angry with me because I made an entire man well on the Sabbath ?
CEB	John	7	24	Don ’ t judge according to appearances . Judge with right judgment. ”
CEB	John	7	25	Some people from Jerusalem said , “ Isn ’ t he the one they want to kill ?
CEB	John	7	26	Here he is , speaking in public , yet they aren ’ t saying anything to him . Could it be that our leaders actually think he is the Christ ?
CEB	John	7	27	We know where he is from , but when the Christ comes , no one will know where he is from. ”
CEB	John	7	28	While Jesus was teaching in the temple , he exclaimed , “ You know me and where I am from . I haven ’ t come on my own . The one who sent me is true , and you don ’ t know him .
CEB	John	7	29	I know him because I am from him and he sent me. ”
CEB	John	7	30	So they wanted to seize Jesus , but they couldn ’ t because his time hadn ’ t yet come .
CEB	John	7	31	Many from that crowd believed in Jesus . They said , “ When the Christ comes , will he do more miraculous signs than this man does ? ”
CEB	John	7	32	The Pharisees heard the crowd whispering such things about Jesus , and the chief priests and Pharisees sent guards to arrest him .
CEB	John	7	33	Therefore , Jesus said , “ I ’ m still with you for a little while before I go to the one who sent me .
CEB	John	7	34	You will look for me , but you won ’ t find me , and where I am you can ’ t come. ”
CEB	John	7	35	The Jewish opposition asked each other , “ Where does he intend to go that we can ’ t find him ? Surely he doesn ’ t intend to go where our people have been scattered and are living among the Greeks ! He isn ’ t going to teach the Greeks , is he ?
CEB	John	7	36	What does he mean when he says , ‘ You will look for me , but you won ’ t find me , and where I am you can ’ t come ’ ? ”
CEB	John	7	37	On the last and most important day of the festival , Jesus stood up and shouted , “ All who are thirsty should come to me !
CEB	John	7	38	All who believe in me should drink ! As the scriptures said concerning me , [ a ] Rivers of living water will flow out from within him. ”
CEB	John	7	39	Jesus said this concerning the Spirit . Those who believed in him would soon receive the Spirit , but they hadn ’ t experienced the Spirit yet since Jesus hadn ’ t yet been glorified .
CEB	John	7	40	When some in the crowd heard these words , they said , “ This man is truly the prophet. ”
CEB	John	7	41	Others said , “ He ’ s the Christ. ” But others said , “ The Christ can ’ t come from Galilee , can he ?
CEB	John	7	42	Didn ’ t the scripture say that the Christ comes from David ’ s family and from Bethlehem , David ’ s village ? ”
CEB	John	7	43	So the crowd was divided over Jesus .
CEB	John	7	44	Some wanted to arrest him , but no one grabbed him .
CEB	John	7	45	The guards returned to the chief priests and Pharisees , who asked , “ Why didn ’ t you bring him ? ”
CEB	John	7	46	The guards answered , “ No one has ever spoken the way he does. ”
CEB	John	7	47	The Pharisees replied , “ Have you too been deceived ?
CEB	John	7	48	Have any of the leaders believed in him ? Has any Pharisee ?
CEB	John	7	49	No , only this crowd , which doesn ’ t know the Law . And they are under God ’ s curse ! ”
CEB	John	7	50	Nicodemus , who was one of them and had come to Jesus earlier , said ,
CEB	John	7	51	“ Our Law doesn ’ t judge someone without first hearing him and learning what he is doing , does it ? ”
CEB	John	7	52	They answered him , “ You are not from Galilee too , are you ? Look it up and you will see that the prophet doesn ’ t come from Galilee. ” Pharisees test Jesus
CEB	John	7	53	They each went to their own homes , Footnotes - John 7:38 Or Whoever is thirsty should come to me and drink . Whoever believes in me , just as the scriptures said , rivers of living water will flow out from within them .
CEB	John	8	8	Bending down again , he wrote on the ground .
CEB	John	8	1	And Jesus went to the Mount of Olives .
CEB	John	8	2	Early in the morning he returned to the temple . All the people gathered around him , and he sat down and taught them .
CEB	John	8	3	The legal experts and Pharisees brought a woman caught in adultery . Placing her in the center of the group ,
CEB	John	8	4	they said to Jesus , “ Teacher , this woman was caught in the act of committing adultery .
CEB	John	8	5	In the Law , Moses commanded us to stone women like this . What do you say ? ”
CEB	John	8	6	They said this to test him , because they wanted a reason to bring an accusation against him . Jesus bent down and wrote on the ground with his finger .
CEB	John	8	7	They continued to question him , so he stood up and replied , “ Whoever hasn ’ t sinned should throw the first stone. ”
CEB	John	8	9	Those who heard him went away , one by one , beginning with the elders . Finally , only Jesus and the woman were left in the middle of the crowd .
CEB	John	8	10	Jesus stood up and said to her , “ Woman , where are they ? Is there no one to condemn you ? ”
CEB	John	8	11	She said , “ No one , sir. ” [ a ] Jesus said , “ Neither do I condemn you . Go , and from now on , don ’ t sin anymore. ” [ b ] Jesus continues to teach in the temple
CEB	John	8	12	Jesus spoke to the people again , saying , “ I am the light of the world . Whoever follows me won ’ t walk in darkness but will have the light of life. ”
CEB	John	8	13	Then the Pharisees said to him , “ Because you are testifying about yourself , your testimony isn ’ t valid. ”
CEB	John	8	14	Jesus replied , “ Even if I testify about myself , my testimony is true , since I know where I came from and where I ’ m going . You don ’ t know where I come from or where I ’ m going .
CEB	John	8	15	You judge according to human standards , but I judge no one .
CEB	John	8	16	Even if I do judge , my judgment is truthful , because I ’ m not alone . My judgments come from me and from the Father who sent me .
CEB	John	8	17	In your Law it is written that the witness of two people is true .
CEB	John	8	18	I am one witness concerning myself , and the Father who sent me is the other. ”
CEB	John	8	19	They asked him , “ Where is your Father ? ” Jesus answered , “ You don ’ t know me and you don ’ t know my Father . If you knew me , you would also know my Father. ”
CEB	John	8	20	He spoke these words while he was teaching in the temple area known as the treasury . No one arrested him , because his time hadn ’ t yet come .
CEB	John	8	21	Jesus continued , “ I ’ m going away . You will look for me , and you will die in your sin . Where I ’ m going , you can ’ t come. ”
CEB	John	8	22	The Jewish leaders said , “ He isn ’ t going to kill himself , is he ? Is that why he said , ‘ Where I ’ m going , you can ’ t come ’ ? ”
CEB	John	8	23	He said to them , “ You are from below ; I ’ m from above . You are from this world ; I ’ m not from this world .
CEB	John	8	24	This is why I told you that you would die in your sins . If you don ’ t believe that I Am , you will die in your sins. ”
CEB	John	8	25	“ Who are you ? ” they asked . Jesus replied , “ I ’ m exactly who I have claimed to be from the beginning .
CEB	John	8	26	I have many things to say in judgment concerning you . The one who sent me is true , and what I have heard from him I tell the world. ”
CEB	John	8	27	They didn ’ t know he was speaking about his Father .
CEB	John	8	28	So Jesus said to them , “ When the Human One [ c ] is lifted up , [ d ] then you will know that I Am . [ e ] Then you will know that I do nothing on my own , but I say just what the Father has taught me .
CEB	John	8	29	He who sent me is with me . He doesn ’ t leave me by myself , because I always do what makes him happy. ”
CEB	John	8	30	While Jesus was saying these things , many people came to believe in him . Children of Abraham
CEB	John	8	31	Jesus said to the Jews who believed in him , “ You are truly my disciples if you remain faithful to my teaching .
CEB	John	8	32	Then you will know the truth , and the truth will set you free. ”
CEB	John	8	33	They responded , “ We are Abraham ’ s children ; we ’ ve never been anyone ’ s slaves . How can you say that we will be set free ? ”
CEB	John	8	34	Jesus answered , “ I assure you that everyone who sins is a slave to sin .
CEB	John	8	35	A slave isn ’ t a permanent member of the household , but a son is .
CEB	John	8	36	Therefore , if the Son makes you free , you really will be free .
CEB	John	8	37	I know that you are Abraham ’ s children , yet you want to kill me because you don ’ t welcome my teaching .
CEB	John	8	38	I ’ m telling you what I ’ ve seen when I am with the Father , but you are doing what you ’ ve heard from your father. ”
CEB	John	8	39	They replied , “ Our father is Abraham. ” Jesus responded , “ If you were Abraham ’ s children , you would do Abraham ’ s works .
CEB	John	8	40	Instead , you want to kill me , though I am the one who has spoken the truth I heard from God . Abraham didn ’ t do this .
CEB	John	8	41	You are doing your father ’ s works. ” They said , “ Our ancestry isn ’ t in question ! The only Father we have is God ! ”
CEB	John	8	42	Jesus replied , “ If God were your Father , you would love me , for I came from God . Here I am . I haven ’ t come on my own . God sent me .
CEB	John	8	43	Why don ’ t you understand what I ’ m saying ? It ’ s because you can ’ t really hear my words .
CEB	John	8	44	Your father is the devil . You are his children , and you want to do what your father wants . He was a murderer from the beginning . He has never stood for the truth , because there ’ s no truth in him . Whenever that liar speaks , he speaks according to his own nature , because he ’ s a liar and the father of liars .
CEB	John	8	45	Because I speak the truth , you don ’ t believe me .
CEB	John	8	46	Who among you can show I ’ m guilty of sin ? Since I speak the truth , why don ’ t you believe me ?
CEB	John	8	47	God ’ s children listen to God ’ s words . You don ’ t listen to me because you aren ’ t God ’ s children. ”
CEB	John	8	48	The Jewish opposition answered , “ We were right to say that you are a Samaritan and have a demon , weren ’ t we ? ”
CEB	John	8	49	“ I don ’ t have a demon , ” Jesus replied . “ But I honor my Father and you dishonor me .
CEB	John	8	50	years old ! ” the Jewish opposition replied . “ How can you say that you have seen Abraham ? ”
CEB	John	8	51	I assure you that whoever keeps my word will never die. ” Abraham and Jesus
CEB	John	8	52	The Jewish opposition said to Jesus , “ Now we know that you have a demon . Abraham and the prophets died , yet you say , ‘ Whoever keeps my word will never die. ’
CEB	John	8	53	Are you greater than our father Abraham ? He died and the prophets died , so who do you make yourself out to be ? ”
CEB	John	8	54	Jesus answered , “ If I glorify myself , my glory is meaningless . My Father , who you say is your God , is the one who glorifies me .
CEB	John	8	55	You don ’ t know him , but I do . If I said I didn ’ t know him , I would be like you , a liar . But I do know him , and I keep his word .
CEB	John	8	56	Your father Abraham was overjoyed that he would see my day . He saw it and was happy. ”
CEB	John	8	57	“ You aren ’ t even
CEB	John	8	58	“ I assure you , ” Jesus replied , “ before Abraham was , I Am. ”
CEB	John	8	59	So they picked up stones to throw at him , but Jesus hid himself and left the temple .
CEB	John	9	9	Some said , “ It is , ” and others said , “ No , it ’ s someone who looks like him. ” But the man said , “ Yes , it ’ s me ! ”
CEB	John	9	2	Jesus ’ disciples asked , “ Rabbi , who sinned so that he was born blind , this man or his parents ? ”
CEB	John	9	3	Jesus answered , “ Neither he nor his parents . This happened so that God ’ s mighty works might be displayed in him .
CEB	John	9	4	While it ’ s daytime , we must do the works of him who sent me . Night is coming when no one can work .
CEB	John	9	5	While I am in the world , I am the light of the world. ”
CEB	John	9	6	After he said this , he spit on the ground , made mud with the saliva , and smeared the mud on the man ’ s eyes .
CEB	John	9	7	Jesus said to him , “ Go , wash in the pool of Siloam ” ( this word means sent ) . So the man went away and washed . When he returned , he could see . Disagreement about the healing
CEB	John	9	8	The man ’ s neighbors and those who used to see him when he was a beggar said , “ Isn ’ t this the man who used to sit and beg ? ”
CEB	John	9	10	So they asked him , “ How are you now able to see ? ”
CEB	John	9	11	He answered , “ The man they call Jesus made mud , smeared it on my eyes , and said , ‘ Go to the pool of Siloam and wash. ’ So I went and washed , and then I could see. ”
CEB	John	9	12	They asked , “ Where is this man ? ” He replied , “ I don ’ t know. ”
CEB	John	9	13	Then they led the man who had been born blind to the Pharisees .
CEB	John	9	14	Now Jesus made the mud and smeared it on the man ’ s eyes on a Sabbath day .
CEB	John	9	15	So Pharisees also asked him how he was able to see . The man told them , “ He put mud on my eyes , I washed , and now I see. ”
CEB	John	9	16	Some Pharisees said , “ This man isn ’ t from God , because he breaks the Sabbath law. ” Others said , “ How can a sinner do miraculous signs like these ? ” So they were divided .
CEB	John	9	17	Some of the Pharisees questioned the man who had been born blind again : “ What do you have to say about him , since he healed your eyes ? ” He replied , “ He ’ s a prophet. ” Conflict over the healing
CEB	John	9	18	The Jewish leaders didn ’ t believe the man had been blind and received his sight until they called for his parents .
CEB	John	9	19	The Jewish leaders asked them , “ Is this your son ? Are you saying he was born blind ? How can he now see ? ”
CEB	John	9	20	His parents answered , “ We know he is our son . We know he was born blind .
CEB	John	9	21	But we don ’ t know how he now sees , and we don ’ t know who healed his eyes . Ask him . He ’ s old enough to speak for himself. ”
CEB	John	9	22	His parents said this because they feared the Jewish authorities . This is because the Jewish authorities had already decided that whoever confessed Jesus to be the Christ would be expelled from the synagogue .
CEB	John	9	23	That ’ s why his parents said , “ He ’ s old enough . Ask him. ”
CEB	John	9	24	Therefore , they called a second time for the man who had been born blind and said to him , “ Give glory to God . We know this man is a sinner. ”
CEB	John	9	25	The man answered , “ I don ’ t know whether he ’ s a sinner . Here ’ s what I do know : I was blind and now I see. ”
CEB	John	9	26	They questioned him : “ What did he do to you ? How did he heal your eyes ? ”
CEB	John	9	27	He replied , “ I already told you , and you didn ’ t listen . Why do you want to hear it again ? Do you want to become his disciples too ? ”
CEB	John	9	28	They insulted him : “ You are his disciple , but we are Moses ’ disciples .
CEB	John	9	29	We know that God spoke to Moses , but we don ’ t know where this man is from. ”
CEB	John	9	30	The man answered , “ This is incredible ! You don ’ t know where he is from , yet he healed my eyes !
CEB	John	9	31	We know that God doesn ’ t listen to sinners . God listens to anyone who is devout and does God ’ s will .
CEB	John	9	32	No one has ever heard of a healing of the eyes of someone born blind .
CEB	John	9	33	If this man wasn ’ t from God , he couldn ’ t do this. ”
CEB	John	9	34	They responded , “ You were born completely in sin ! How is it that you dare to teach us ? ” Then they expelled him . Jesus finds the man born blind
CEB	John	9	35	Jesus heard they had expelled the man born blind . Finding him , Jesus said , “ Do you believe in the Human One ? ” [ a ]
CEB	John	9	36	He answered , “ Who is he , sir ? [ b ] I want to believe in him. ”
CEB	John	9	37	Jesus said , “ You have seen him . In fact , he is the one speaking with you. ”
CEB	John	9	38	The man said , “ Lord , [ c ] I believe. ” And he worshipped Jesus . Jesus teaches the Pharisees
CEB	John	9	39	Jesus said , “ I have come into the world to exercise judgment so that those who don ’ t see can see and those who see will become blind. ”
CEB	John	9	40	Some Pharisees who were with him heard what he said and asked , “ Surely we aren ’ t blind , are we ? ”
CEB	John	9	41	Jesus said to them , “ If you were blind , you wouldn ’ t have any sin , but now that you say , ‘ We see , ’ your sin remains .
CEB	John	10	10	The thief enters only to steal , kill , and destroy . I came so that they could have life—indeed , so that they could live life to the fullest . I am the good shepherd
CEB	John	10	1	I assure you that whoever doesn ’ t enter into the sheep pen through the gate but climbs over the wall is a thief and an outlaw .
CEB	John	10	2	The one who enters through the gate is the shepherd of the sheep .
CEB	John	10	3	The guard at the gate opens the gate for him , and the sheep listen to his voice . He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out .
CEB	John	10	4	Whenever he has gathered all of his sheep , he goes before them and they follow him , because they know his voice .
CEB	John	10	5	They won ’ t follow a stranger but will run away because they don ’ t know the stranger ’ s voice. ”
CEB	John	10	6	Those who heard Jesus use this analogy didn ’ t understand what he was saying . I am the gate
CEB	John	10	7	So Jesus spoke again , “ I assure you that I am the gate of the sheep .
CEB	John	10	8	All who came before me were thieves and outlaws , but the sheep didn ’ t listen to them .
CEB	John	10	9	I am the gate . Whoever enters through me will be saved . They will come in and go out and find pasture .
CEB	John	10	11	“ I am the good shepherd . The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep .
CEB	John	10	12	When the hired hand sees the wolf coming , he leaves the sheep and runs away . That ’ s because he isn ’ t the shepherd ; the sheep aren ’ t really his . So the wolf attacks the sheep and scatters them .
CEB	John	10	13	He ’ s only a hired hand and the sheep don ’ t matter to him .
CEB	John	10	14	“ I am the good shepherd . I know my own sheep and they know me ,
CEB	John	10	15	just as the Father knows me and I know the Father . I give up my life for the sheep .
CEB	John	10	16	I have other sheep that don ’ t belong to this sheep pen . I must lead them too . They will listen to my voice and there will be one flock , with one shepherd .
CEB	John	10	17	“ This is why the Father loves me : I give up my life so that I can take it up again .
CEB	John	10	18	No one takes it from me , but I give it up because I want to . I have the right to give it up , and I have the right to take it up again . I received this commandment from my Father. ”
CEB	John	10	19	There was another division among the Jews because of Jesus ’ words .
CEB	John	10	20	Many of them said , “ He has a demon and has lost his mind . Why listen to him ? ”
CEB	John	10	21	Others said , “ These aren ’ t the words of someone who has a demon . Can a demon heal the eyes of people who are blind ? ” Jesus at the Festival of Dedication
CEB	John	10	22	The time came for the Festival of Dedication [ a ] in Jerusalem . It was winter ,
CEB	John	10	23	and Jesus was in the temple , walking in the covered porch named for Solomon .
CEB	John	10	24	The Jewish opposition circled around him and asked , “ How long will you test our patience ? If you are the Christ , tell us plainly. ”
CEB	John	10	25	Jesus answered , “ I have told you , but you don ’ t believe . The works I do in my Father ’ s name testify about me ,
CEB	John	10	26	but you don ’ t believe because you don ’ t belong to my sheep .
CEB	John	10	27	My sheep listen to my voice . I know them and they follow me .
CEB	John	10	28	I give them eternal life . They will never die , and no one will snatch them from my hand .
CEB	John	10	29	My Father , who has given them to me , is greater than all , and no one is able to snatch them from my Father ’ s hand .
CEB	John	10	30	I and the Father are one. ”
CEB	John	10	31	Again the Jewish opposition picked up stones in order to stone him .
CEB	John	10	32	Jesus responded , “ I have shown you many good works from the Father . For which of those works do you stone me ? ”
CEB	John	10	33	The Jewish opposition answered , “ We don ’ t stone you for a good work but for insulting God . You are human , yet you make yourself out to be God. ”
CEB	John	10	34	Jesus replied , “ Isn ’ t it written in your Law , I have said , you are gods ? [ b ]
CEB	John	10	35	Scripture calls those to whom God ’ s word came gods , and scripture can ’ t be abolished .
CEB	John	10	36	So how can you say that the one whom the Father has made holy and sent into the world insults God because he said , ‘ I am God ’ s Son ’ ?
CEB	John	10	37	If I don ’ t do the works of my Father , don ’ t believe me .
CEB	John	10	38	But if I do them , and you don ’ t believe me , believe the works so that you can know and recognize that the Father is in me and I am in the Father. ”
CEB	John	10	39	Again , they wanted to arrest him , but he escaped from them . Jesus at the Jordan
CEB	John	10	40	Jesus went back across the Jordan to the place where John had baptized at first , and he stayed there .
CEB	John	10	41	Many people came to him . “ John didn ’ t do any miraculous signs , ” they said , “ but everything John said about this man was true. ”
CEB	John	10	42	Many believed in Jesus there . Footnotes - John 10:22 Hanukkah - John 10:34 Ps 82:6
CEB	John	11	11	He continued , “ Our friend Lazarus is sleeping , but I am going in order to wake him up. ”
CEB	John	11	2	This was the Mary who anointed the Lord with fragrant oil and wiped his feet with her hair . Her brother Lazarus was ill. )
CEB	John	11	3	So the sisters sent word to Jesus , saying , “ Lord , the one whom you love is ill. ”
CEB	John	11	4	When he heard this , Jesus said , “ This illness isn ’ t fatal . It ’ s for the glory of God so that God ’ s Son can be glorified through it. ”
CEB	John	11	5	Jesus loved Martha , her sister , and Lazarus .
CEB	John	11	6	When he heard that Lazarus was ill , he stayed where he was . After two days ,
CEB	John	11	7	he said to his disciples , “ Let ’ s return to Judea again. ”
CEB	John	11	8	The disciples replied , “ Rabbi , the Jewish opposition wants to stone you , but you want to go back ? ”
CEB	John	11	9	Jesus answered , “ Aren ’ t there twelve hours in the day ? Whoever walks in the day doesn ’ t stumble because they see the light of the world .
CEB	John	11	10	But whoever walks in the night does stumble because the light isn ’ t in them. ”
CEB	John	11	12	The disciples said , “ Lord , if he ’ s sleeping , he will get well. ”
CEB	John	11	13	They thought Jesus meant that Lazarus was in a deep sleep , but Jesus had spoken about Lazarus ’ death .
CEB	John	11	14	Jesus told them plainly , “ Lazarus has died .
CEB	John	11	15	For your sakes , I ’ m glad I wasn ’ t there so that you can believe . Let ’ s go to him. ”
CEB	John	11	16	Then Thomas ( the one called Didymus ) said to the other disciples , “ Let us go too so that we may die with Jesus. ” Jesus with Martha and Mary
CEB	John	11	17	When Jesus arrived , he found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb for four days .
CEB	John	11	18	Bethany was a little less than two miles from Jerusalem .
CEB	John	11	19	Many Jews had come to comfort Martha and Mary after their brother ’ s death .
CEB	John	11	20	When Martha heard that Jesus was coming , she went to meet him , while Mary remained in the house .
CEB	John	11	21	Martha said to Jesus , “ Lord , if you had been here , my brother wouldn ’ t have died .
CEB	John	11	22	Even now I know that whatever you ask God , God will give you. ”
CEB	John	11	23	Jesus told her , “ Your brother will rise again. ”
CEB	John	11	24	Martha replied , “ I know that he will rise in the resurrection on the last day. ”
CEB	John	11	25	Jesus said to her , “ I am the resurrection and the life . Whoever believes in me will live , even though they die .
CEB	John	11	26	Everyone who lives and believes in me will never die . Do you believe this ? ”
CEB	John	11	27	She replied , “ Yes , Lord , I believe that you are the Christ , God ’ s Son , the one who is coming into the world. ”
CEB	John	11	28	After she said this , she went and spoke privately to her sister Mary , “ The teacher is here and he ’ s calling for you. ”
CEB	John	11	29	When Mary heard this , she got up quickly and went to Jesus .
CEB	John	11	30	He hadn ’ t entered the village but was still in the place where Martha had met him .
CEB	John	11	31	When the Jews who were comforting Mary in the house saw her get up quickly and leave , they followed her . They assumed she was going to mourn at the tomb .
CEB	John	11	32	When Mary arrived where Jesus was and saw him , she fell at his feet and said , “ Lord , if you had been here , my brother wouldn ’ t have died. ”
CEB	John	11	33	When Jesus saw her crying and the Jews who had come with her crying also , he was deeply disturbed and troubled .
CEB	John	11	34	He asked , “ Where have you laid him ? ” They replied , “ Lord , come and see. ”
CEB	John	11	35	Jesus began to cry .
CEB	John	11	36	The Jews said , “ See how much he loved him ! ”
CEB	John	11	37	But some of them said , “ He healed the eyes of the man born blind . Couldn ’ t he have kept Lazarus from dying ? ” Jesus at Lazarus ’ tomb
CEB	John	11	38	Jesus was deeply disturbed again when he came to the tomb . It was a cave , and a stone covered the entrance .
CEB	John	11	39	Jesus said , “ Remove the stone. ” Martha , the sister of the dead man , said , “ Lord , the smell will be awful ! He ’ s been dead four days. ”
CEB	John	11	40	Jesus replied , “ Didn ’ t I tell you that if you believe , you will see God ’ s glory ? ”
CEB	John	11	41	So they removed the stone . Jesus looked up and said , “ Father , thank you for hearing me .
CEB	John	11	42	I know you always hear me . I say this for the benefit of the crowd standing here so that they will believe that you sent me. ”
CEB	John	11	43	Having said this , Jesus shouted with a loud voice , “ Lazarus , come out ! ”
CEB	John	11	44	The dead man came out , his feet bound and his hands tied , and his face covered with a cloth . Jesus said to them , “ Untie him and let him go. ”
CEB	John	11	45	Therefore , many of the Jews who came with Mary and saw what Jesus did believed in him .
CEB	John	11	46	But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done . Caiaphas prophesies
CEB	John	11	47	Then the chief priests and Pharisees called together the council [ a ] and said , “ What are we going to do ? This man is doing many miraculous signs !
CEB	John	11	48	If we let him go on like this , everyone will believe in him . Then the Romans will come and take away both our temple and our people. ”
CEB	John	11	49	One of them , Caiaphas , who was high priest that year , told them , “ You don ’ t know anything !
CEB	John	11	50	You don ’ t see that it is better for you that one man die for the people rather than the whole nation be destroyed. ”
CEB	John	11	51	He didn ’ t say this on his own . As high priest that year , he prophesied that Jesus would soon die for the nation—
CEB	John	11	52	and not only for the nation . Jesus would also die so that God ’ s children scattered everywhere would be gathered together as one .
CEB	John	11	53	From that day on they plotted to kill him . The Passover draws near
CEB	John	11	54	Therefore , Jesus was no longer active in public ministry among the Jewish leaders . Instead , he left Jerusalem and went to a place near the wilderness , to a city called Ephraim , where he stayed with his disciples .
CEB	John	11	55	It was almost time for the Jewish Passover , and many people went from the countryside up to Jerusalem to purify themselves through ritual washing before the Passover .
CEB	John	11	56	They were looking for Jesus . As they spoke to each other in the temple , they said , “ What do you think ? He won ’ t come to the festival , will he ? ”
CEB	John	11	57	The chief priests and Pharisees had given orders that anyone who knew where he was should report it , so they could arrest him . Footnotes - John 11:47 Or Sanhedrin
CEB	John	12	12	The next day the great crowd that had come for the festival heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem .
CEB	John	12	2	Lazarus and his sisters hosted a dinner for him . Martha served and Lazarus was among those who joined him at the table .
CEB	John	12	3	Then Mary took an extraordinary amount , almost three-quarters of a pound , [ a ] of very expensive perfume made of pure nard . She anointed Jesus ’ feet with it , then wiped his feet dry with her hair . The house was filled with the aroma of the perfume .
CEB	John	12	4	Judas Iscariot , one of his disciples ( the one who was about to betray him ) , complained ,
CEB	John	12	5	“ This perfume was worth a year ’ s wages ! [ b ] Why wasn ’ t it sold and the money given to the poor ? ” (
CEB	John	12	6	He said this not because he cared about the poor but because he was a thief . He carried the money bag and would take what was in it . )
CEB	John	12	7	Then Jesus said , “ Leave her alone . This perfume was to be used in preparation for my burial , and this is how she has used it .
CEB	John	12	8	You will always have the poor among you , but you won ’ t always have me. ”
CEB	John	12	9	Many Jews learned that he was there . They came not only because of Jesus but also to see Lazarus , whom he had raised from the dead .
CEB	John	12	10	The chief priests decided that they would kill Lazarus too .
CEB	John	12	11	It was because of Lazarus that many of the Jews had deserted them and come to believe in Jesus . Jesus enters Jerusalem
CEB	John	12	13	They took palm branches and went out to meet him . They shouted , “ Hosanna ! Blessings on the one who comes in the name of the Lord ! [ c ] Blessings on the king of Israel ! ”
CEB	John	12	14	Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it , just as it is written ,
CEB	John	12	15	Don ’ t be afraid , Daughter Zion . Look ! Your king is coming , sitting on a donkey ’ s colt . [ d ]
CEB	John	12	16	His disciples didn ’ t understand these things at first . After he was glorified , they remembered that these things had been written about him and that they had done these things to him .
CEB	John	12	17	The crowd who had been with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead were testifying about him .
CEB	John	12	18	That ’ s why the crowd came to meet him , because they had heard about this miraculous sign that he had done .
CEB	John	12	19	Therefore , the Pharisees said to each other , “ See ! You ’ ve accomplished nothing ! Look ! The whole world is following him ! ” Jesus teaches about his death
CEB	John	12	20	Some Greeks were among those who had come up to worship at the festival .
CEB	John	12	21	They came to Philip , who was from Bethsaida in Galilee , and made a request : “ Sir , we want to see Jesus. ”
CEB	John	12	22	Philip told Andrew , and Andrew and Philip told Jesus .
CEB	John	12	23	Jesus replied , “ The time has come for the Human One [ e ] to be glorified .
CEB	John	12	24	I assure you that unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies , it can only be a single seed . But if it dies , it bears much fruit .
CEB	John	12	25	Those who love their lives will lose them , and those who hate their lives in this world will keep them forever .
CEB	John	12	26	Whoever serves me must follow me . Wherever I am , there my servant will also be . My Father will honor whoever serves me .
CEB	John	12	27	“ Now I am deeply troubled . [ f ] What should I say ? ‘ Father , save me from this time ’ ? No , for this is the reason I have come to this time .
CEB	John	12	28	Father , glorify your name ! ” Then a voice came from heaven , “ I have glorified it , and I will glorify it again. ”
CEB	John	12	29	The crowd standing there heard and said , “ It ’ s thunder. ” Others said , “ An angel spoke to him. ”
CEB	John	12	30	Jesus replied , “ This voice wasn ’ t for my benefit but for yours .
CEB	John	12	31	Now is the time for judgment of this world . Now this world ’ s ruler will be thrown out .
CEB	John	12	32	When I am lifted up [ g ] from the earth , I will draw everyone to me. ” (
CEB	John	12	33	He said this to show how he was going to die . )
CEB	John	12	34	The crowd responded , “ We have heard from the Law that the Christ remains forever . How can you say that the Human One [ h ] must be lifted up ? Who is this Human One ? ” [ i ]
CEB	John	12	35	Jesus replied , “ The light is with you for only a little while . Walk while you have the light so that darkness doesn ’ t overtake you . Those who walk in the darkness don ’ t know where they are going .
CEB	John	12	36	As long as you have the light , believe in the light so that you might become people whose lives are determined by the light. ” After Jesus said these things , he went away and hid from them . Fulfillment of prophecy
CEB	John	12	37	Jesus had done many miraculous signs before the people , but they didn ’ t believe in him .
CEB	John	12	38	This was to fulfill the word of the prophet Isaiah : Lord , who has believed through our message ? To whom is the arm of the Lord fully revealed ? [ j ]
CEB	John	12	39	Isaiah explains why they couldn ’ t believe :
CEB	John	12	40	He made their eyes blind and closed their minds so that they might not see with their eyes , understand with their minds , and turn their lives around— and I would heal them . [ k ]
CEB	John	12	41	Isaiah said these things because he saw Jesus ’ glory ; he spoke about Jesus .
CEB	John	12	42	Even so , many leaders believed in him , but they wouldn ’ t acknowledge their faith because they feared that the Pharisees would expel them from the synagogue .
CEB	John	12	43	They believed , but they loved human praise more than God ’ s glory . Summary of Jesus ’ teaching
CEB	John	12	44	Jesus shouted , “ Whoever believes in me doesn ’ t believe in me but in the one who sent me .
CEB	John	12	45	Whoever sees me sees the one who sent me .
CEB	John	12	46	I have come as a light into the world so that everyone who believes in me won ’ t live in darkness .
CEB	John	12	47	If people hear my words and don ’ t keep them , I don ’ t judge them . I didn ’ t come to judge the world but to save it .
CEB	John	12	48	Whoever rejects me and doesn ’ t receive my words will be judged at the last day by the word I have spoken .
CEB	John	12	49	I don ’ t speak on my own , but the Father who sent me commanded me regarding what I should speak and say .
CEB	John	12	50	I know that his commandment is eternal life . Therefore , whatever I say is just as the Father has said to me. ” Footnotes - John 12:3 Or a litra , a Roman pound , approximately twelve ounces - John 12:5 Or three hundred denaria - John 12:13 Ps 118:26 - John 12:15 Zech 9:9 - John 12:23 Or Son of Man - John 12:27 Ps 6:2 - John 12:32 Or exalted - John 12:34 Or Son of Man - John 12:34 Or Son of Man - John 12:38 Isa 53:1 - John 12:40 Isa 6:10
CEB	John	13	13	You call me ‘ Teacher ’ and ‘ Lord , ’ and you speak correctly , because I am .
CEB	John	13	2	Jesus and his disciples were sharing the evening meal . The devil had already provoked Judas , Simon Iscariot ’ s son , to betray Jesus .
CEB	John	13	3	Jesus knew the Father had given everything into his hands and that he had come from God and was returning to God .
CEB	John	13	4	So he got up from the table and took off his robes . Picking up a linen towel , he tied it around his waist .
CEB	John	13	5	Then he poured water into a washbasin and began to wash the disciples ’ feet , drying them with the towel he was wearing .
CEB	John	13	6	When Jesus came to Simon Peter , Peter said to him , “ Lord , are you going to wash my feet ? ”
CEB	John	13	7	Jesus replied , “ You don ’ t understand what I ’ m doing now , but you will understand later. ”
CEB	John	13	8	“ No ! ” Peter said . “ You will never wash my feet ! ” Jesus replied , “ Unless I wash you , you won ’ t have a place with me. ”
CEB	John	13	9	Simon Peter said , “ Lord , not only my feet but also my hands and my head ! ”
CEB	John	13	10	Jesus responded , “ Those who have bathed need only to have their feet washed , because they are completely clean . You disciples are clean , but not every one of you. ”
CEB	John	13	11	He knew who would betray him . That ’ s why he said , “ Not every one of you is clean. ”
CEB	John	13	12	After he washed the disciples ’ feet , he put on his robes and returned to his place at the table . He said to them , “ Do you know what I ’ ve done for you ?
CEB	John	13	14	If I , your Lord and teacher , have washed your feet , you too must wash each other ’ s feet .
CEB	John	13	15	I have given you an example : Just as I have done , you also must do .
CEB	John	13	16	I assure you , servants aren ’ t greater than their master , nor are those who are sent greater than the one who sent them .
CEB	John	13	17	Since you know these things , you will be happy if you do them .
CEB	John	13	18	I ’ m not speaking about all of you . I know those whom I ’ ve chosen . But this is to fulfill the scripture , The one who eats my bread has turned against me . [ a ]
CEB	John	13	19	“ I ’ m telling you this now , before it happens , so that when it does happen you will believe that I Am .
CEB	John	13	20	I assure you that whoever receives someone I send receives me , and whoever receives me receives the one who sent me. ” Announcement of the betrayal
CEB	John	13	21	After he said these things , Jesus was deeply disturbed and testified , “ I assure you , one of you will betray me. ”
CEB	John	13	22	His disciples looked at each other , confused about which of them he was talking about .
CEB	John	13	23	One of the disciples , the one whom Jesus loved , was at Jesus ’ side .
CEB	John	13	24	Simon Peter nodded at him to get him to ask Jesus who he was talking about .
CEB	John	13	25	Leaning back toward Jesus , this disciple asked , “ Lord , who is it ? ”
CEB	John	13	26	Jesus answered , “ It ’ s the one to whom I will give this piece of bread once I have dipped into the bowl. ” Then he dipped the piece of bread and gave it to Judas , Simon Iscariot ’ s son .
CEB	John	13	27	After Judas took the bread , Satan entered into him . Jesus told him , “ What you are about to do , do quickly. ”
CEB	John	13	28	No one sitting at the table understood why Jesus said this to him .
CEB	John	13	29	Some thought that , since Judas kept the money bag , Jesus told him , “ Go , buy what we need for the feast , ” or that he should give something to the poor .
CEB	John	13	30	So when Judas took the bread , he left immediately . And it was night . Love commandment
CEB	John	13	31	When Judas was gone , Jesus said , “ Now the Human One [ b ] has been glorified , and God has been glorified in him .
CEB	John	13	32	If God has been glorified in him , God will also glorify the Human One [ c ] in himself and will glorify him immediately .
CEB	John	13	33	Little children , I ’ m with you for a little while longer . You will look for me—but , just as I told the Jewish leaders , I also tell you now— ‘ Where I ’ m going , you can ’ t come. ’
CEB	John	13	34	“ I give you a new commandment : Love each other . Just as I have loved you , so you also must love each other .
CEB	John	13	35	This is how everyone will know that you are my disciples , when you love each other. ” Announcement of Peter ’ s denial
CEB	John	13	36	Simon Peter said to Jesus , “ Lord , where are you going ? ” Jesus answered , “ Where I am going , you can ’ t follow me now , but you will follow later. ”
CEB	John	13	37	Peter asked , “ Lord , why can ’ t I follow you now ? I ’ ll give up my life for you. ”
CEB	John	13	38	Jesus replied , “ Will you give up your life for me ? I assure you that you will deny me three times before the rooster crows . Footnotes - John 13:18 Ps 41:9 - John 13:31 Or Son of Man - John 13:32 Or Son of Man
CEB	John	14	14	When you ask me for anything in my name , I will do it . I won ’ t leave you as orphans
CEB	John	14	2	My Father ’ s house has room to spare . If that weren ’ t the case , would I have told you that I ’ m going to prepare a place for you ?
CEB	John	14	3	When I go to prepare a place for you , I will return and take you to be with me so that where I am you will be too .
CEB	John	14	4	You know the way to the place I ’ m going. ”
CEB	John	14	5	Thomas asked , “ Lord , we don ’ t know where you are going . How can we know the way ? ”
CEB	John	14	6	Jesus answered , “ I am the way , the truth , and the life . No one comes to the Father except through me .
CEB	John	14	7	If you have really known me , you will also know the Father . From now on you know him and have seen him. ”
CEB	John	14	8	Philip said , “ Lord , show us the Father ; that will be enough for us. ”
CEB	John	14	9	Jesus replied , “ Don ’ t you know me , Philip , even after I have been with you all this time ? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father . How can you say , ‘ Show us the Father ’ ?
CEB	John	14	10	Don ’ t you believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me ? The words I have spoken to you I don ’ t speak on my own . The Father who dwells in me does his works .
CEB	John	14	11	Trust me when I say that I am in the Father and the Father is in me , or at least believe on account of the works themselves .
CEB	John	14	12	I assure you that whoever believes in me will do the works that I do . They will do even greater works than these because I am going to the Father .
CEB	John	14	13	I will do whatever you ask for in my name , so that the Father can be glorified in the Son .
CEB	John	14	15	“ If you love me , you will keep my commandments .
CEB	John	14	16	I will ask the Father , and he will send another Companion , [ a ] who will be with you forever .
CEB	John	14	17	This Companion is the Spirit of Truth , whom the world can ’ t receive because it neither sees him nor recognizes him . You know him , because he lives with you and will be with you .
CEB	John	14	18	“ I won ’ t leave you as orphans . I will come to you .
CEB	John	14	19	Soon the world will no longer see me , but you will see me . Because I live , you will live too .
CEB	John	14	20	On that day you will know that I am in my Father , you are in me , and I am in you .
CEB	John	14	21	Whoever has my commandments and keeps them loves me . Whoever loves me will be loved by my Father , and I will love them and reveal myself to them. ”
CEB	John	14	22	Judas ( not Judas Iscariot ) asked , “ Lord , why are you about to reveal yourself to us and not to the world ? ”
CEB	John	14	23	Jesus answered , “ Whoever loves me will keep my word . My Father will love them , and we will come to them and make our home with them .
CEB	John	14	24	Whoever doesn ’ t love me doesn ’ t keep my words . The word that you hear isn ’ t mine . It is the word of the Father who sent me .
CEB	John	14	25	“ I have spoken these things to you while I am with you .
CEB	John	14	26	The Companion , [ b ] the Holy Spirit , whom the Father will send in my name , will teach you everything and will remind you of everything I told you .
CEB	John	14	27	“ Peace I leave with you . My peace I give you . I give to you not as the world gives . Don ’ t be troubled or afraid .
CEB	John	14	28	You have heard me tell you , ‘ I ’ m going away and returning to you. ’ If you loved me , you would be happy that I am going to the Father , because the Father is greater than me .
CEB	John	14	29	I have told you before it happens so that when it happens you will believe .
CEB	John	14	30	I won ’ t say much more to you because this world ’ s ruler is coming . He has nothing on me .
CEB	John	14	31	Rather , he comes so that the world will know that I love the Father and do just as the Father has commanded me . Get up . We ’ re leaving this place . Footnotes - John 14:16 Or Advocate - John 14:26 Or Advocate
CEB	John	15	15	I don ’ t call you servants any longer , because servants don ’ t know what their master is doing . Instead , I call you friends , because everything I heard from my Father I have made known to you .
CEB	John	15	2	He removes any of my branches that don ’ t produce fruit , and he trims any branch that produces fruit so that it will produce even more fruit .
CEB	John	15	3	You are already trimmed because of the word I have spoken to you .
CEB	John	15	4	Remain in me , and I will remain in you . A branch can ’ t produce fruit by itself , but must remain in the vine . Likewise , you can ’ t produce fruit unless you remain in me .
CEB	John	15	5	I am the vine ; you are the branches . If you remain in me and I in you , then you will produce much fruit . Without me , you can ’ t do anything .
CEB	John	15	6	If you don ’ t remain in me , you will be like a branch that is thrown out and dries up . Those branches are gathered up , thrown into a fire , and burned .
CEB	John	15	7	If you remain in me and my words remain in you , ask for whatever you want and it will be done for you .
CEB	John	15	8	My Father is glorified when you produce much fruit and in this way prove that you are my disciples . Love each other
CEB	John	15	9	“ As the Father loved me , I too have loved you . Remain in my love .
CEB	John	15	10	If you keep my commandments , you will remain in my love , just as I kept my Father ’ s commandments and remain in his love .
CEB	John	15	11	I have said these things to you so that my joy will be in you and your joy will be complete .
CEB	John	15	12	This is my commandment : love each other just as I have loved you .
CEB	John	15	13	No one has greater love than to give up one ’ s life for one ’ s friends .
CEB	John	15	14	You are my friends if you do what I command you .
CEB	John	15	16	You didn ’ t choose me , but I chose you and appointed you so that you could go and produce fruit and so that your fruit could last . As a result , whatever you ask the Father in my name , he will give you .
CEB	John	15	17	I give you these commandments so that you can love each other . If the world hates you
CEB	John	15	18	“ If the world hates you , know that it hated me first .
CEB	John	15	19	If you belonged to the world , the world would love you as its own . However , I have chosen you out of the world , and you don ’ t belong to the world . This is why the world hates you .
CEB	John	15	20	Remember what I told you , ‘ Servants aren ’ t greater than their master. ’ If the world harassed me , it will harass you too . If it kept my word , it will also keep yours .
CEB	John	15	21	The world will do all these things to you on account of my name , because it doesn ’ t know the one who sent me .
CEB	John	15	22	“ If I hadn ’ t come and spoken to the people of this world , they wouldn ’ t be sinners . But now they have no excuse for their sin .
CEB	John	15	23	Whoever hates me also hates the Father .
CEB	John	15	24	If I hadn ’ t done works among them that no one else had done , they wouldn ’ t be sinners . But now they have seen and hated both me and my Father .
CEB	John	15	25	This fulfills the word written in their Law , They hated me without a reason . [ a ]
CEB	John	15	26	“ When the Companion [ b ] comes , whom I will send from the Father—the Spirit of Truth who proceeds from the Father—he will testify about me .
CEB	John	15	27	You will testify too , because you have been with me from the beginning . Footnotes - John 15:25 Pss 35:19 ; 69:4 - John 15:26 Or Advocate
CEB	John	16	16	Soon you won ’ t be able to see me ; soon after that , you will see me. ” I will see you again
CEB	John	16	1	I have said these things to you so that you won ’ t fall away .
CEB	John	16	2	They will expel you from the synagogue . The time is coming when those who kill you will think that they are doing a service to God .
CEB	John	16	3	They will do these things because they don ’ t know the Father or me .
CEB	John	16	4	But I have said these things to you so that when their time comes , you will remember that I told you about them . I go away “ I didn ’ t say these things to you from the beginning , because I was with you .
CEB	John	16	5	But now I go away to the one who sent me . None of you ask me , ‘ Where are you going ? ’
CEB	John	16	6	Yet because I have said these things to you , you are filled with sorrow .
CEB	John	16	7	I assure you that it is better for you that I go away . If I don ’ t go away , the Companion [ a ] won ’ t come to you . But if I go , I will send him to you .
CEB	John	16	8	When he comes , he will show the world it was wrong about sin , righteousness , and judgment .
CEB	John	16	9	He will show the world it was wrong about sin because they don ’ t believe in me .
CEB	John	16	10	He will show the world it was wrong about righteousness because I ’ m going to the Father and you won ’ t see me anymore .
CEB	John	16	11	He will show the world it was wrong about judgment because this world ’ s ruler stands condemned . I still have many things to say
CEB	John	16	12	“ I have much more to say to you , but you can ’ t handle it now .
CEB	John	16	13	However , when the Spirit of Truth comes , he will guide you in all truth . He won ’ t speak on his own , but will say whatever he hears and will proclaim to you what is to come .
CEB	John	16	14	He will glorify me , because he will take what is mine and proclaim it to you .
CEB	John	16	15	Everything that the Father has is mine . That ’ s why I said that the Spirit takes what is mine and will proclaim it to you .
CEB	John	16	17	Some of Jesus ’ disciples said to each other , “ What does he mean : ‘ Soon you won ’ t see me , and soon after that you will see me ’ and ‘ Because I ’ m going to the Father ’ ?
CEB	John	16	18	What does he mean by ‘ soon ’ ? We don ’ t understand what he ’ s talking about. ”
CEB	John	16	19	Jesus knew they wanted to ask him , so he said , “ Are you trying to find out from each other what I meant when I said , ‘ Soon you won ’ t see me , and soon after that you will see me ’ ?
CEB	John	16	20	I assure you that you will cry and lament , and the world will be happy . You will be sorrowful , but your sorrow will turn into joy .
CEB	John	16	21	When a woman gives birth , she has pain because her time has come . But when the child is born , she no longer remembers her distress because of her joy that a child has been born into the world .
CEB	John	16	22	In the same way , you have sorrow now ; but I will see you again , and you will be overjoyed . No one takes away your joy .
CEB	John	16	23	In that day , you won ’ t ask me anything . I assure you that the Father will give you whatever you ask in my name .
CEB	John	16	24	Up to now , you have asked nothing in my name . Ask and you will receive so that your joy will be complete . I have conquered the world
CEB	John	16	25	“ I ’ ve been using figures of speech with you . The time is coming when I will no longer speak to you in such analogies . Instead , I will tell you plainly about the Father .
CEB	John	16	26	In that day you will ask in my name . I ’ m not saying that I will ask the Father on your behalf .
CEB	John	16	27	The Father himself loves you , because you have loved me and believed that I came from God .
CEB	John	16	28	I left the Father and came into the world . I tell you again : I am leaving the world and returning to the Father. ”
CEB	John	16	29	His disciples said , “ See ! Now you speak plainly ; you aren ’ t using figures of speech .
CEB	John	16	30	Now we know that you know everything and you don ’ t need anyone to ask you . Because of this we believe you have come from God. ”
CEB	John	16	31	Jesus replied , “ Now you believe ?
CEB	John	16	32	Look ! A time is coming—and is here ! —when each of you will be scattered to your own homes and you will leave me alone . I ’ m not really alone , for the Father is with me .
CEB	John	16	33	I ’ ve said these things to you so that you will have peace in me . In the world you have distress . But be encouraged ! I have conquered the world. ” Footnotes - John 16:7 Or Advocate
CEB	John	17	17	Make them holy in the truth ; your word is truth .
CEB	John	17	2	You gave him authority over everyone so that he could give eternal life to everyone you gave him .
CEB	John	17	3	This is eternal life : to know you , the only true God , and Jesus Christ whom you sent .
CEB	John	17	4	I have glorified you on earth by finishing the work you gave me to do .
CEB	John	17	5	Now , Father , glorify me in your presence with the glory I shared with you before the world was created .
CEB	John	17	6	“ I have revealed your name to the people you gave me from this world . They were yours and you gave them to me , and they have kept your word .
CEB	John	17	7	Now they know that everything you have given me comes from you .
CEB	John	17	8	This is because I gave them the words that you gave me , and they received them . They truly understood that I came from you , and they believed that you sent me .
CEB	John	17	9	“ I ’ m praying for them . I ’ m not praying for the world but for those you gave me , because they are yours .
CEB	John	17	10	Everything that is mine is yours and everything that is yours is mine ; I have been glorified in them .
CEB	John	17	11	I ’ m no longer in the world , but they are in the world , even as I ’ m coming to you . Holy Father , watch over them in your name , the name you gave me , that they will be one just as we are one .
CEB	John	17	12	When I was with them , I watched over them in your name , the name you gave to me , and I kept them safe . None of them were lost , except the one who was destined for destruction , so that scripture would be fulfilled .
CEB	John	17	13	Now I ’ m coming to you and I say these things while I ’ m in the world so that they can share completely in my joy .
CEB	John	17	14	I gave your word to them and the world hated them , because they don ’ t belong to this world , just as I don ’ t belong to this world .
CEB	John	17	15	I ’ m not asking that you take them out of this world but that you keep them safe from the evil one .
CEB	John	17	16	They don ’ t belong to this world , just as I don ’ t belong to this world .
CEB	John	17	18	As you sent me into the world , so I have sent them into the world .
CEB	John	17	19	I made myself holy on their behalf so that they also would be made holy in the truth .
CEB	John	17	20	“ I ’ m not praying only for them but also for those who believe in me because of their word .
CEB	John	17	21	I pray they will be one , Father , just as you are in me and I am in you . I pray that they also will be in us , so that the world will believe that you sent me .
CEB	John	17	22	I ’ ve given them the glory that you gave me so that they can be one just as we are one .
CEB	John	17	23	I ’ m in them and you are in me so that they will be made perfectly one . Then the world will know that you sent me and that you have loved them just as you loved me .
CEB	John	17	24	“ Father , I want those you gave me to be with me where I am . Then they can see my glory , which you gave me because you loved me before the creation of the world .
CEB	John	17	25	“ Righteous Father , even the world didn ’ t know you , but I ’ ve known you , and these believers know that you sent me .
CEB	John	17	26	I ’ ve made your name known to them and will continue to make it known so that your love for me will be in them , and I myself will be in them . ”
CEB	John	18	18	The servants and the guards had made a fire because it was cold . They were standing around it , warming themselves . Peter joined them there , standing by the fire and warming himself . Jesus testifies
CEB	John	18	2	Judas , his betrayer , also knew the place because Jesus often gathered there with his disciples .
CEB	John	18	3	Judas brought a company of soldiers [ a ] and some guards from the chief priests and Pharisees . They came there carrying lanterns , torches , and weapons .
CEB	John	18	4	Jesus knew everything that was to happen to him , so he went out and asked , “ Who are you looking for ? ”
CEB	John	18	5	They answered , “ Jesus the Nazarene. ” He said to them , “ I Am. ” [ b ] ( Judas , his betrayer , was standing with them . )
CEB	John	18	6	When he said , “ I Am , ” they shrank back and fell to the ground .
CEB	John	18	7	He asked them again , “ Who are you looking for ? ” They said , “ Jesus the Nazarene. ”
CEB	John	18	8	Jesus answered , “ I told you , ‘ I Am. ’ [ c ] If you are looking for me , then let these people go. ”
CEB	John	18	9	This was so that the word he had spoken might be fulfilled : “ I didn ’ t lose anyone of those whom you gave me. ”
CEB	John	18	10	Then Simon Peter , who had a sword , drew it and struck the high priest ’ s servant , cutting off his right ear . ( The servant ’ s name was Malchus . )
CEB	John	18	11	Jesus told Peter , “ Put your sword away ! Am I not to drink the cup the Father has given me ? ”
CEB	John	18	12	Then the company of soldiers , the commander , and the guards from the Jewish leaders took Jesus into custody . They bound him
CEB	John	18	13	and led him first to Annas . He was the father-in-law of Caiaphas , the high priest that year . (
CEB	John	18	14	Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jewish leaders that it was better for one person to die for the people . ) Peter denies Jesus
CEB	John	18	15	Simon Peter and another disciple followed Jesus . Because this other disciple was known to the high priest , he went with Jesus into the high priest ’ s courtyard .
CEB	John	18	16	However , Peter stood outside near the gate . Then the other disciple ( the one known to the high priest ) came out and spoke to the woman stationed at the gate , and she brought Peter in .
CEB	John	18	17	The servant woman stationed at the gate asked Peter , “ Aren ’ t you one of this man ’ s disciples ? ” “ I ’ m not , ” he replied .
CEB	John	18	19	Meanwhile , the chief priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching .
CEB	John	18	20	Jesus answered , “ I ’ ve spoken openly to the world . I ’ ve always taught in synagogues and in the temple , where all the Jews gather . I ’ ve said nothing in private .
CEB	John	18	21	Why ask me ? Ask those who heard what I told them . They know what I said. ”
CEB	John	18	22	After Jesus spoke , one of the guards standing there slapped Jesus in the face . “ Is that how you would answer the high priest ? ” he asked .
CEB	John	18	23	Jesus replied , “ If I speak wrongly , testify about what was wrong . But if I speak correctly , why do you strike me ? ”
CEB	John	18	24	Then Annas sent him , bound , to Caiaphas the high priest . Peter denies Jesus again
CEB	John	18	25	Meanwhile , Simon Peter was still standing with the guards , warming himself . They asked , “ Aren ’ t you one of his disciples ? ” Peter denied it , saying , “ I ’ m not. ”
CEB	John	18	26	A servant of the high priest , a relative of the one whose ear Peter had cut off , said to him , “ Didn ’ t I see you in the garden with him ? ”
CEB	John	18	27	Peter denied it again , and immediately a rooster crowed . Trial before Pilate
CEB	John	18	28	The Jewish leaders led Jesus from Caiaphas to the Roman governor ’ s palace . [ d ] It was early in the morning . So that they could eat the Passover , the Jewish leaders wouldn ’ t enter the palace ; entering the palace would have made them ritually impure .
CEB	John	18	29	So Pilate went out to them and asked , “ What charge do you bring against this man ? ”
CEB	John	18	30	They answered , “ If he had done nothing wrong , we wouldn ’ t have handed him over to you. ”
CEB	John	18	31	Pilate responded , “ Take him yourselves and judge him according to your Law. ” The Jewish leaders replied , “ The Law doesn ’ t allow us to kill anyone. ” (
CEB	John	18	32	This was so that Jesus ’ word might be fulfilled when he indicated how he was going to die . ) Pilate questions Jesus
CEB	John	18	33	Pilate went back into the palace . He summoned Jesus and asked , “ Are you the king of the Jews ? ”
CEB	John	18	34	Jesus answered , “ Do you say this on your own or have others spoken to you about me ? ”
CEB	John	18	35	Pilate responded , “ I ’ m not a Jew , am I ? Your nation and its chief priests handed you over to me . What have you done ? ”
CEB	John	18	36	Jesus replied , “ My kingdom doesn ’ t originate from this world . If it did , my guards would fight so that I wouldn ’ t have been arrested by the Jewish leaders . My kingdom isn ’ t from here. ”
CEB	John	18	37	“ So you are a king ? ” Pilate said . Jesus answered , “ You say that I am a king . I was born and came into the world for this reason : to testify to the truth . Whoever accepts the truth listens to my voice. ”
CEB	John	18	38	“ What is truth ? ” Pilate asked . Release of Barabbas After Pilate said this , he returned to the Jewish leaders and said , “ I find no grounds for any charge against him .
CEB	John	18	39	You have a custom that I release one prisoner for you at Passover . Do you want me to release for you the king of the Jews ? ”
CEB	John	18	40	They shouted , “ Not this man ! Give us Barabbas ! ” ( Barabbas was an outlaw . ) Footnotes - John 18:3 Or cohort ( approximately six hundred soldiers ) - John 18:5 Or It is I - John 18:8 Or It is I - John 18:28 Or praetorium
CEB	John	19	19	Pilate had a public notice written and posted on the cross . It read “ Jesus the Nazarene , the king of the Jews. ”
CEB	John	19	2	The soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head , and dressed him in a purple robe .
CEB	John	19	3	Over and over they went up to him and said , “ Greetings , king of the Jews ! ” And they slapped him in the face .
CEB	John	19	4	Pilate came out of the palace again and said to the Jewish leaders , “ Look ! I ’ m bringing him out to you to let you know that I find no grounds for a charge against him. ”
CEB	John	19	5	When Jesus came out , wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe , Pilate said to them , “ Here ’ s the man. ”
CEB	John	19	6	When the chief priests and their deputies saw him , they shouted out , “ Crucify , crucify ! ” Pilate told them , “ You take him and crucify him . I don ’ t find any grounds for a charge against him. ”
CEB	John	19	7	The Jewish leaders replied , “ We have a Law , and according to this Law he ought to die because he made himself out to be God ’ s Son. ” Pilate questions Jesus again
CEB	John	19	8	When Pilate heard this word , he was even more afraid .
CEB	John	19	9	He went back into the residence and spoke to Jesus , “ Where are you from ? ” Jesus didn ’ t answer .
CEB	John	19	10	So Pilate said , “ You won ’ t speak to me ? Don ’ t you know that I have authority to release you and also to crucify you ? ”
CEB	John	19	11	Jesus replied , “ You would have no authority over me if it had not been given to you from above . That ’ s why the one who handed me over to you has the greater sin. ”
CEB	John	19	12	From that moment on , Pilate wanted to release Jesus . However , the Jewish leaders cried out , saying , “ If you release this man , you aren ’ t a friend of the emperor ! Anyone who makes himself out to be a king opposes the emperor ! ”
CEB	John	19	13	When Pilate heard these words , he led Jesus out and seated him on the judge ’ s bench at the place called Stone Pavement ( in Aramaic , Gabbatha ) .
CEB	John	19	14	It was about noon on the Preparation Day for the Passover . Pilate said to the Jewish leaders , “ Here ’ s your king. ”
CEB	John	19	15	The Jewish leaders cried out , “ Take him away ! Take him away ! Crucify him ! ” Pilate responded , “ What ? Do you want me to crucify your king ? ” “ We have no king except the emperor , ” the chief priests answered .
CEB	John	19	16	Then Pilate handed Jesus over to be crucified . Crucifixion The soldiers took Jesus prisoner .
CEB	John	19	17	Carrying his cross by himself , he went out to a place called Skull Place ( in Aramaic , Golgotha ) .
CEB	John	19	18	That ’ s where they crucified him—and two others with him , one on each side and Jesus in the middle .
CEB	John	19	20	Many of the Jews read this sign , for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city and it was written in Aramaic , Latin , and Greek .
CEB	John	19	21	Therefore , the Jewish chief priests complained to Pilate , “ Don ’ t write , ‘ The king of the Jews ’ but ‘ This man said , “ I am the king of the Jews. ” ’ ”
CEB	John	19	22	Pilate answered , “ What I ’ ve written , I ’ ve written. ”
CEB	John	19	23	When the soldiers crucified Jesus , they took his clothes and his sandals , and divided them into four shares , one for each soldier . His shirt was seamless , woven as one piece from the top to the bottom .
CEB	John	19	24	They said to each other , “ Let ’ s not tear it . Let ’ s cast lots to see who will get it. ” This was to fulfill the scripture , They divided my clothes among themselves , and they cast lots for my clothing . [ a ] That ’ s what the soldiers did .
CEB	John	19	25	Jesus ’ mother and his mother ’ s sister , Mary the wife of Clopas , and Mary Magdalene stood near the cross .
CEB	John	19	26	When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby , he said to his mother , “ Woman , here is your son. ”
CEB	John	19	27	Then he said to the disciple , “ Here is your mother. ” And from that time on , this disciple took her into his home .
CEB	John	19	28	After this , knowing that everything was already completed , in order to fulfill the scripture , Jesus said , “ I am thirsty. ”
CEB	John	19	29	A jar full of sour wine was nearby , so the soldiers soaked a sponge in it , placed it on a hyssop branch , and held it up to his lips .
CEB	John	19	30	When he had received the sour wine , Jesus said , “ It is completed. ” Bowing his head , he gave up his life . Witness at the cross
CEB	John	19	31	It was the Preparation Day and the Jewish leaders didn ’ t want the bodies to remain on the cross on the Sabbath , especially since that Sabbath was an important day . So they asked Pilate to have the legs of those crucified broken and the bodies taken down .
CEB	John	19	32	Therefore , the soldiers came and broke the legs of the two men who were crucified with Jesus .
CEB	John	19	33	When they came to Jesus , they saw that he was already dead so they didn ’ t break his legs .
CEB	John	19	34	However , one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear , and immediately blood and water came out .
CEB	John	19	35	The one who saw this has testified , and his testimony is true . He knows that he speaks the truth , and he has testified so that you also can believe .
CEB	John	19	36	These things happened to fulfill the scripture , They won ’ t break any of his bones . [ b ]
CEB	John	19	37	And another scripture says , They will look at him whom they have pierced . [ c ] Jesus ’ body is buried
CEB	John	19	38	After this Joseph of Arimathea asked Pilate if he could take away the body of Jesus . Joseph was a disciple of Jesus , but a secret one because he feared the Jewish authorities . Pilate gave him permission , so he came and took the body away .
CEB	John	19	39	Nicodemus , the one who at first had come to Jesus at night , was there too . He brought a mixture of myrrh and aloe , nearly seventy-five pounds in all . [ d ]
CEB	John	19	40	Following Jewish burial customs , they took Jesus ’ body and wrapped it , with the spices , in linen cloths .
CEB	John	19	41	There was a garden in the place where Jesus was crucified , and in the garden was a new tomb in which no one had ever been laid .
CEB	John	19	42	Because it was the Jewish Preparation Day and the tomb was nearby , they laid Jesus in it . Footnotes - John 19:24 Ps 22:18 - John 19:36 Exod 12:46 - John 19:37 Zech 12:10 - John 19:39 Or one hundred litra ; that is , one hundred Roman pounds
CEB	John	20	20	After he said this , he showed them his hands and his side . When the disciples saw the Lord , they were filled with joy .
CEB	John	20	2	She ran to Simon Peter and the other disciple , the one whom Jesus loved , and said , “ They have taken the Lord from the tomb , and we don ’ t know where they ’ ve put him. ”
CEB	John	20	3	Peter and the other disciple left to go to the tomb .
CEB	John	20	4	They were running together , but the other disciple ran faster than Peter and was the first to arrive at the tomb .
CEB	John	20	5	Bending down to take a look , he saw the linen cloths lying there , but he didn ’ t go in .
CEB	John	20	6	Following him , Simon Peter entered the tomb and saw the linen cloths lying there .
CEB	John	20	7	He also saw the face cloth that had been on Jesus ’ head . It wasn ’ t with the other clothes but was folded up in its own place .
CEB	John	20	8	Then the other disciple , the one who arrived at the tomb first , also went inside . He saw and believed .
CEB	John	20	9	They didn ’ t yet understand the scripture that Jesus must rise from the dead .
CEB	John	20	10	Then the disciples returned to the place where they were staying . Jesus appears to Mary
CEB	John	20	11	Mary stood outside near the tomb , crying . As she cried , she bent down to look into the tomb .
CEB	John	20	12	She saw two angels dressed in white , seated where the body of Jesus had been , one at the head and one at the foot .
CEB	John	20	13	The angels asked her , “ Woman , why are you crying ? ” She replied , “ They have taken away my Lord , and I don ’ t know where they ’ ve put him. ”
CEB	John	20	14	As soon as she had said this , she turned around and saw Jesus standing there , but she didn ’ t know it was Jesus .
CEB	John	20	15	Jesus said to her , “ Woman , why are you crying ? Who are you looking for ? ” Thinking he was the gardener , she replied , “ Sir , if you have carried him away , tell me where you have put him and I will get him. ”
CEB	John	20	16	Jesus said to her , “ Mary. ” She turned and said to him in Aramaic , “ Rabbouni ” ( which means Teacher ) .
CEB	John	20	17	Jesus said to her , “ Don ’ t hold on to me , for I haven ’ t yet gone up to my Father . Go to my brothers and sisters and tell them , ‘ I ’ m going up to my Father and your Father , to my God and your God. ’ ”
CEB	John	20	18	Mary Magdalene left and announced to the disciples , “ I ’ ve seen the Lord. ” Then she told them what he said to her . Jesus appears to the disciples
CEB	John	20	19	It was still the first day of the week . That evening , while the disciples were behind closed doors because they were afraid of the Jewish authorities , Jesus came and stood among them . He said , “ Peace be with you. ”
CEB	John	20	21	Jesus said to them again , “ Peace be with you . As the Father sent me , so I am sending you. ”
CEB	John	20	22	Then he breathed on them and said , “ Receive the Holy Spirit .
CEB	John	20	23	If you forgive anyone ’ s sins , they are forgiven ; if you don ’ t forgive them , they aren ’ t forgiven. ” Jesus appears to Thomas and the disciples
CEB	John	20	24	Thomas , the one called Didymus , [ a ] one of the Twelve , wasn ’ t with the disciples when Jesus came .
CEB	John	20	25	The other disciples told him , “ We ’ ve seen the Lord ! ” But he replied , “ Unless I see the nail marks in his hands , put my finger in the wounds left by the nails , and put my hand into his side , I won ’ t believe. ”
CEB	John	20	26	After eight days his disciples were again in a house and Thomas was with them . Even though the doors were locked , Jesus entered and stood among them . He said , “ Peace be with you. ”
CEB	John	20	27	Then he said to Thomas , “ Put your finger here . Look at my hands . Put your hand into my side . No more disbelief . Believe ! ”
CEB	John	20	28	Thomas responded to Jesus , “ My Lord and my God ! ”
CEB	John	20	29	Jesus replied , “ Do you believe because you see me ? Happy are those who don ’ t see and yet believe. ”
CEB	John	20	30	Then Jesus did many other miraculous signs in his disciples ’ presence , signs that aren ’ t recorded in this scroll .
CEB	John	20	31	But these things are written so that you will believe that Jesus is the Christ , God ’ s Son , and that believing , you will have life in his name . Footnotes - John 20:24 Or the twin
CEB	John	21	21	When Peter saw this disciple , he said to Jesus , “ Lord , what about him ? ”
CEB	John	21	2	Simon Peter , Thomas ( called Didymus [ a ] ) , Nathanael from Cana in Galilee , Zebedee ’ s sons , and two other disciples were together .
CEB	John	21	3	Simon Peter told them , “ I ’ m going fishing. ” They said , “ We ’ ll go with you. ” They set out in a boat , but throughout the night they caught nothing .
CEB	John	21	4	Early in the morning , Jesus stood on the shore , but the disciples didn ’ t realize it was Jesus .
CEB	John	21	5	Jesus called to them , “ Children , have you caught anything to eat ? ” They answered him , “ No. ”
CEB	John	21	6	He said , “ Cast your net on the right side of the boat and you will find some. ” So they did , and there were so many fish that they couldn ’ t haul in the net .
CEB	John	21	7	Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter , “ It ’ s the Lord ! ” When Simon Peter heard it was the Lord , he wrapped his coat around himself ( for he was naked ) and jumped into the water .
CEB	John	21	8	The other disciples followed in the boat , dragging the net full of fish , for they weren ’ t far from shore , only about one hundred yards .
CEB	John	21	9	When they landed , they saw a fire there , with fish on it , and some bread .
CEB	John	21	10	Jesus said to them , “ Bring some of the fish that you ’ ve just caught. ”
CEB	John	21	11	Simon Peter got up and pulled the net to shore . It was full of large fish , one hundred fifty-three of them . Yet the net hadn ’ t torn , even with so many fish .
CEB	John	21	12	Jesus said to them , “ Come and have breakfast. ” None of the disciples could bring themselves to ask him , “ Who are you ? ” They knew it was the Lord .
CEB	John	21	13	Jesus came , took the bread , and gave it to them . He did the same with the fish .
CEB	John	21	14	This was now the third time Jesus appeared to his disciples after he was raised from the dead . Jesus and Peter
CEB	John	21	15	When they finished eating , Jesus asked Simon Peter , “ Simon son of John , do you love me more than these ? ” Simon replied , “ Yes , Lord , you know I love you. ” Jesus said to him , “ Feed my lambs. ”
CEB	John	21	16	Jesus asked a second time , “ Simon son of John , do you love me ? ” Simon replied , “ Yes , Lord , you know I love you. ” Jesus said to him , “ Take care of my sheep. ”
CEB	John	21	17	He asked a third time , “ Simon son of John , do you love me ? ” Peter was sad that Jesus asked him a third time , “ Do you love me ? ” He replied , “ Lord , you know everything ; you know I love you. ” Jesus said to him , “ Feed my sheep .
CEB	John	21	18	I assure you that when you were younger you tied your own belt and walked around wherever you wanted . When you grow old , you will stretch out your hands and another will tie your belt and lead you where you don ’ t want to go. ”
CEB	John	21	19	He said this to show the kind of death by which Peter would glorify God . After saying this , Jesus said to Peter , “ Follow me. ” Jesus and the disciple whom he loved
CEB	John	21	20	Peter turned around and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them . This was the one who had leaned against Jesus at the meal and asked him , “ Lord , who is going to betray you ? ”
CEB	John	21	22	Jesus replied , “ If I want him to remain until I come , what difference does that make to you ? You must follow me. ”
CEB	John	21	23	Therefore , the word spread among the brothers and sisters that this disciple wouldn ’ t die . However , Jesus didn ’ t say he wouldn ’ t die , but only , “ If I want him to remain until I come , what difference does that make to you ? ”
CEB	John	21	24	This is the disciple who testifies concerning these things and who wrote them down . We know that his testimony is true .
CEB	John	21	25	Jesus did many other things as well . If all of them were recorded , I imagine the world itself wouldn ’ t have enough room for the scrolls that would be written . Footnotes - John 21:2 Or the twin
CEB	Romans	1	1	From Paul , a slave of Christ Jesus , called to be an apostle and set apart for God ’ s good news . 2-3 God promised this good news about his Son ahead of time through his prophets in the holy scriptures . His Son was descended from David .
CEB	Romans	1	4	He was publicly identified as God ’ s Son with power through his resurrection from the dead , which was based on the Spirit of holiness . This Son is Jesus Christ our Lord .
CEB	Romans	1	5	Through him we have received God ’ s grace and our appointment to be apostles . This was to bring all Gentiles to faithful obedience for his name ’ s sake .
CEB	Romans	1	6	You who are called by Jesus Christ are also included among these Gentiles .
CEB	Romans	1	7	To those in Rome who are dearly loved by God and called to be God ’ s people . Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ . Thanksgiving and Paul ’ s plans to visit
CEB	Romans	1	8	First of all , I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you , because the news about your faithfulness is being spread throughout the whole world .
CEB	Romans	1	9	I serve God in my spirit by preaching the good news about God ’ s Son , and God is my witness that I continually mention you
CEB	Romans	1	10	in all my prayers . I ’ m always asking that somehow , by God ’ s will , I might succeed in visiting you at last .
CEB	Romans	1	11	I really want to see you to pass along some spiritual gift to you so that you can be strengthened .
CEB	Romans	1	12	What I mean is that we can mutually encourage each other while I am with you . We can be encouraged by the faithfulness we find in each other , both your faithfulness and mine .
CEB	Romans	1	13	I want you to know , brothers and sisters , that I planned to visit you many times , although I have been prevented from coming until now . I want to harvest some fruit among you , just as I have done among the other Gentiles .
CEB	Romans	1	14	I have a responsibility both to Greeks and to those who don ’ t speak Greek , both to the wise and to the foolish . God ’ s righteousness is revealed
CEB	Romans	1	15	That ’ s why I ’ m ready to preach the gospel also to you who are in Rome .
CEB	Romans	1	16	I ’ m not ashamed of the gospel : it is God ’ s own power for salvation to all who have faith in God , to the Jew first and also to the Greek .
CEB	Romans	1	17	God ’ s righteousness is being revealed in the gospel , from faithfulness [ a ] for faith , [ b ] as it is written , The righteous person will live by faith . [ c ] Gentiles are without excuse
CEB	Romans	1	18	God ’ s wrath is being revealed from heaven against all the ungodly behavior and the injustice of human beings who silence the truth with injustice .
CEB	Romans	1	19	This is because what is known about God should be plain to them because God made it plain to them .
CEB	Romans	1	20	Ever since the creation of the world , God ’ s invisible qualities—God ’ s eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen , because they are understood through the things God has made . So humans are without excuse .
CEB	Romans	1	21	Although they knew God , they didn ’ t honor God as God or thank him . Instead , their reasoning became pointless , and their foolish hearts were darkened .
CEB	Romans	1	22	While they were claiming to be wise , they made fools of themselves .
CEB	Romans	1	23	They exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images that look like mortal humans : birds , animals , and reptiles .
CEB	Romans	1	24	So God abandoned them to their hearts ’ desires , which led to the moral corruption of degrading their own bodies with each other .
CEB	Romans	1	25	They traded God ’ s truth for a lie , and they worshipped and served the creation instead of the creator , who is blessed forever . Amen .
CEB	Romans	1	26	That ’ s why God abandoned them to degrading lust . Their females traded natural sexual relations for unnatural sexual relations .
CEB	Romans	1	27	Also , in the same way , the males traded natural sexual relations with females , and burned with lust for each other . Males performed shameful actions with males , and they were paid back with the penalty they deserved for their mistake in their own bodies .
CEB	Romans	1	28	Since they didn ’ t think it was worthwhile to acknowledge God , God abandoned them to a defective mind to do inappropriate things .
CEB	Romans	1	29	So they were filled with all injustice , wicked behavior , greed , and evil behavior . They are full of jealousy , murder , fighting , deception , and malice . They are gossips ,
CEB	Romans	1	30	they slander people , and they hate God . They are rude and proud , and they brag . They invent ways to be evil , and they are disobedient to their parents .
CEB	Romans	1	31	They are without understanding , disloyal , without affection , and without mercy .
CEB	Romans	1	32	Though they know God ’ s decision that those who persist in such practices deserve death , they not only keep doing these things but also approve others who practice them . Footnotes - Romans 1:17 Or faith - Romans 1:17 Or faithfulness - Romans 1:17 Hab 2:4
CEB	Romans	2	2	We know that God ’ s judgment agrees with the truth , and his judgment is against those who do these kinds of things .
CEB	Romans	2	3	If you judge those who do these kinds of things while you do the same things yourself , think about this : Do you believe that you will escape God ’ s judgment ?
CEB	Romans	2	4	Or do you have contempt for the riches of God ’ s generosity , tolerance , and patience ? Don ’ t you realize that God ’ s kindness is supposed to lead you to change your heart and life ?
CEB	Romans	2	5	You are storing up wrath for yourself because of your stubbornness and your heart that refuses to change . God ’ s just judgment will be revealed on the day of wrath .
CEB	Romans	2	6	God will repay everyone based on their works . [ a ]
CEB	Romans	2	7	On the one hand , he will give eternal life to those who look for glory , honor , and immortality based on their patient good work .
CEB	Romans	2	8	But on the other hand , there will be wrath and anger for those who obey wickedness instead of the truth because they are acting out of selfishness and disobedience .
CEB	Romans	2	9	There will be trouble and distress for every human being who does evil , for the Jew first and also for the Greek .
CEB	Romans	2	10	But there will be glory , honor , and peace for everyone who does what is good , for the Jew first and also for the Greek .
CEB	Romans	2	11	God does not have favorites .
CEB	Romans	2	12	Those who have sinned outside the Law will also die outside the Law , and those who have sinned under the Law will be judged by the Law .
CEB	Romans	2	13	It isn ’ t the ones who hear the Law who are righteous in God ’ s eyes . It is the ones who do what the Law says who will be treated as righteous .
CEB	Romans	2	14	Gentiles don ’ t have the Law . But when they instinctively do what the Law requires they are a Law in themselves , though they don ’ t have the Law .
CEB	Romans	2	15	They show the proof of the Law written on their hearts , and their consciences affirm it . Their conflicting thoughts will accuse them , or even make a defense for them ,
CEB	Romans	2	16	on the day when , according to my gospel , God will judge the hidden truth about human beings through Christ Jesus . Jews will be judged as well
CEB	Romans	2	17	But , if you call yourself a Jew ; if you rely on the Law ; if you brag about your relationship to God ;
CEB	Romans	2	18	if you know the will of God ; if you are taught by the Law so that you can figure out the things that really matter ;
CEB	Romans	2	19	if you have persuaded yourself that you are : a guide for the blind ; a light to those who are in darkness ;
CEB	Romans	2	20	an educator of the foolish ; a teacher of infants ( since you have the full content of knowledge and truth in the Law ) ;
CEB	Romans	2	21	then why don ’ t you who are teaching others teach yourself ? If you preach , “ No stealing , ” do you steal ?
CEB	Romans	2	22	If you say , “ No adultery , ” do you commit adultery ? If you hate idols , do you rob temples ?
CEB	Romans	2	23	If you brag about the Law , do you shame God by breaking the Law ?
CEB	Romans	2	24	As it is written : The name of God is discredited by the Gentiles because of you . [ b ]
CEB	Romans	2	25	Circumcision is an advantage if you do what the Law says . But if you are a person who breaks the Law , your status of being circumcised has changed into not being circumcised .
CEB	Romans	2	26	So if the person who isn ’ t circumcised keeps the Law , won ’ t his status of not being circumcised be counted as if he were circumcised ?
CEB	Romans	2	27	The one who isn ’ t physically circumcised but keeps the Law will judge you . You became a lawbreaker after you had the written Law and circumcision .
CEB	Romans	2	28	It isn ’ t the Jew who maintains outward appearances who will receive praise from God , and it isn ’ t people who are outwardly circumcised on their bodies .
CEB	Romans	2	29	Instead , it is the person who is a Jew inside , who is circumcised in spirit , not literally . That person ’ s praise doesn ’ t come from people but from God .
CEB	Romans	3	3	What does it matter , then , if some weren ’ t faithful ? Their lack of faith won ’ t cancel God ’ s faithfulness , will it ?
CEB	Romans	3	2	Plenty in every way . First of all , the Jews were trusted with God ’ s revelations .
CEB	Romans	3	4	Absolutely not ! God must be true , even if every human being is a liar , as it is written : So that it can show that you are right in your words ; and you will triumph when you are judged . [ a ]
CEB	Romans	3	5	But if our lack of righteousness confirms God ’ s justice , what will we say ? That God , who brings wrath upon us , isn ’ t just ( I ’ m speaking rhetorically ) ?
CEB	Romans	3	6	Absolutely not ! If God weren ’ t just , how could he judge the world ?
CEB	Romans	3	7	But if God ’ s truth is demonstrated by my lie and it increases his glory , why am I still judged as a sinner ?
CEB	Romans	3	8	Why not say , “ Let ’ s do evil things so that good things will come out of it ” ? ( Some people who slander us accuse us of saying that , but these people deserve criticism . ) All are under the power of sin
CEB	Romans	3	9	So what are we saying ? Are we better off ? Not at all . We have already stated the charge : both Jews and Greeks are all under the power of sin .
CEB	Romans	3	10	As it is written , There is no righteous person , not even one .
CEB	Romans	3	11	There is no one who understands . There is no one who looks for God .
CEB	Romans	3	12	They all turned away . They have become worthless together . There is no one who shows kindness . There is not even one . [ b ]
CEB	Romans	3	13	Their throat is a grave that has been opened . They are deceitful with their tongues , and the poison of vipers is under their lips . [ c ]
CEB	Romans	3	14	Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness . [ d ]
CEB	Romans	3	15	Their feet are quick to shed blood ;
CEB	Romans	3	16	destruction and misery are in their ways ;
CEB	Romans	3	17	and they don ’ t know the way of peace . [ e ]
CEB	Romans	3	18	There is no fear of God in their view of the world . [ f ]
CEB	Romans	3	19	Now we know that whatever the Law says , it speaks to those who are under the Law , in order to shut every mouth and make it so the whole world has to answer to God .
CEB	Romans	3	20	It follows that no human being will be treated as righteous in his presence by doing what the Law says , because the knowledge of sin comes through the Law . God ’ s righteousness through faithfulness of Christ
CEB	Romans	3	21	But now God ’ s righteousness has been revealed apart from the Law , which is confirmed by the Law and the Prophets .
CEB	Romans	3	22	God ’ s righteousness comes through the faithfulness of Jesus Christ for all who have faith in him . There ’ s no distinction .
CEB	Romans	3	23	All have sinned and fall short of God ’ s glory ,
CEB	Romans	3	24	but all are treated as righteous freely by his grace because of a ransom that was paid by Christ Jesus .
CEB	Romans	3	25	Through his faithfulness , God displayed Jesus as the place of sacrifice where mercy is found by means of his blood . He did this to demonstrate his righteousness in passing over sins that happened before ,
CEB	Romans	3	26	during the time of God ’ s patient tolerance . He also did this to demonstrate that he is righteous in the present time , and to treat the one who has faith in Jesus as righteous .
CEB	Romans	3	27	What happens to our bragging ? It ’ s thrown out . With which law ? With what we have accomplished under the Law ?
CEB	Romans	3	28	No , not at all , but through the law of faith . We consider that a person is treated as righteous by faith , apart from what is accomplished under the Law .
CEB	Romans	3	29	Or is God the God of Jews only ? Isn ’ t God the God of Gentiles also ? Yes , God is also the God of Gentiles .
CEB	Romans	3	30	Since God is one , then the one who makes the circumcised righteous by faith will also make the one who isn ’ t circumcised righteous through faith .
CEB	Romans	3	31	Do we then cancel the Law through this faith ? Absolutely not ! Instead , we confirm the Law .
CEB	Romans	4	4	Workers ’ salaries aren ’ t credited to them on the basis of an employer ’ s grace but rather on the basis of what they deserve .
CEB	Romans	4	2	Because if Abraham was made righteous because of his actions , he would have had a reason to brag , but not in front of God .
CEB	Romans	4	3	What does the scripture say ? Abraham had faith in God , and it was credited to him as righteousness . [ a ]
CEB	Romans	4	5	But faith is credited as righteousness to those who don ’ t work , because they have faith in God who makes the ungodly righteous .
CEB	Romans	4	6	In the same way , David also pronounces a blessing on the person to whom God credits righteousness apart from actions :
CEB	Romans	4	7	Happy are those whose actions outside the Law are forgiven , and whose sins are covered .
CEB	Romans	4	8	Happy are those whose sin isn ’ t counted against them by the Lord . [ b ]
CEB	Romans	4	9	Is this state of happiness only for the circumcised or is it also for those who aren ’ t circumcised ? We say , “ Faith was credited to Abraham as righteousness. ”
CEB	Romans	4	10	So how was it credited ? When he was circumcised , or when he wasn ’ t circumcised ? In fact , it was credited while he still wasn ’ t circumcised , not after he was circumcised .
CEB	Romans	4	11	He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that comes from the faith he had while he still wasn ’ t circumcised . It happened this way so that Abraham could be the ancestor of all those people who aren ’ t circumcised , who have faith in God , and so are counted as righteous .
CEB	Romans	4	12	He could also be the ancestor of those circumcised people , who aren ’ t only circumcised but who also walk in the path of faith , like our ancestor Abraham did while he wasn ’ t circumcised . Abraham ’ s promise is received through faith
CEB	Romans	4	13	The promise to Abraham and to his descendants , that he would inherit the world , didn ’ t come through the Law but through the righteousness that comes from faith .
CEB	Romans	4	14	If they inherit because of the Law , then faith has no effect and the promise has been canceled .
CEB	Romans	4	15	The Law brings about wrath . But when there isn ’ t any law , there isn ’ t any violation of the law .
CEB	Romans	4	16	That ’ s why the inheritance comes through faith , so that it will be on the basis of God ’ s grace . In that way , the promise is secure for all of Abraham ’ s descendants , not just for those who are related by Law but also for those who are related by the faith of Abraham , who is the father of all of us .
CEB	Romans	4	17	As it is written : I have appointed you to be the father of many nations . [ c ] So Abraham is our father in the eyes of God in whom he had faith , the God who gives life to the dead and calls things that don ’ t exist into existence .
CEB	Romans	4	18	When it was beyond hope , he had faith in the hope that he would become the father of many nations , in keeping with the promise God spoke to him : That ’ s how many descendants you will have . [ d ]
CEB	Romans	4	19	Without losing faith , Abraham , who was nearly
CEB	Romans	4	100	years old , took into account his own body , which was as good as dead , and Sarah ’ s womb , which was dead .
CEB	Romans	4	20	He didn ’ t hesitate with a lack of faith in God ’ s promise , but he grew strong in faith and gave glory to God .
CEB	Romans	4	21	He was fully convinced that God was able to do what he promised .
CEB	Romans	4	22	Therefore , it was credited to him as righteousness .
CEB	Romans	4	23	But the scripture that says it was credited to him [ e ] wasn ’ t written only for Abraham ’ s sake .
CEB	Romans	4	24	It was written also for our sake , because it is going to be credited to us too . It will be credited to those of us who have faith in the one who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead .
CEB	Romans	4	25	He was handed over because of our mistakes , and he was raised to meet the requirements of righteousness for us .
CEB	Romans	5	5	This hope doesn ’ t put us to shame , because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit , who has been given to us .
CEB	Romans	5	2	We have access by faith into this grace in which we stand through him , and we boast in the hope of God ’ s glory .
CEB	Romans	5	3	But not only that ! We even take pride in our problems , because we know that trouble produces endurance ,
CEB	Romans	5	4	endurance produces character , and character produces hope .
CEB	Romans	5	6	While we were still weak , at the right moment , Christ died for ungodly people .
CEB	Romans	5	7	It isn ’ t often that someone will die for a righteous person , though maybe someone might dare to die for a good person .
CEB	Romans	5	8	But God shows his love for us , because while we were still sinners Christ died for us .
CEB	Romans	5	9	So , now that we have been made righteous by his blood , we can be even more certain that we will be saved from God ’ s wrath through him .
CEB	Romans	5	10	If we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son while we were still enemies , now that we have been reconciled , how much more certain is it that we will be saved by his life ?
CEB	Romans	5	11	And not only that : we even take pride in God through our Lord Jesus Christ , the one through whom we now have a restored relationship with God . Grace now rules
CEB	Romans	5	12	Just as through one human being sin came into the world , and death came through sin , so death has come to everyone , since everyone has sinned .
CEB	Romans	5	13	Although sin was in the world , since there was no Law , it wasn ’ t taken into account until the Law came .
CEB	Romans	5	14	But death ruled from Adam until Moses , even over those who didn ’ t sin in the same way Adam did—Adam was a type of the one who was coming .
CEB	Romans	5	15	But the free gift of Christ isn ’ t like Adam ’ s failure . If many people died through what one person did wrong , God ’ s grace is multiplied even more for many people with the gift—of the one person Jesus Christ—that comes through grace .
CEB	Romans	5	16	The gift isn ’ t like the consequences of one person ’ s sin . The judgment that came from one person ’ s sin led to punishment , but the free gift that came out of many failures led to the verdict of acquittal .
CEB	Romans	5	17	If death ruled because of one person ’ s failure , those who receive the multiplied grace and the gift of righteousness will even more certainly rule in life through the one person Jesus Christ .
CEB	Romans	5	18	So now the righteous requirements necessary for life are met for everyone through the righteous act of one person , just as judgment fell on everyone through the failure of one person .
CEB	Romans	5	19	Many people were made righteous through the obedience of one person , just as many people were made sinners through the disobedience of one person .
CEB	Romans	5	20	The Law stepped in to amplify the failure , but where sin increased , grace multiplied even more .
CEB	Romans	5	21	The result is that grace will rule through God ’ s righteousness , leading to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord , just as sin ruled in death . Footnotes - Romans 5:1 Or faith
CEB	Romans	6	6	This is what we know : the person that we used to be was crucified with him in order to get rid of the corpse that had been controlled by sin . That way we wouldn ’ t be slaves to sin anymore ,
CEB	Romans	6	2	Absolutely not ! All of us died to sin . How can we still live in it ?
CEB	Romans	6	3	Or don ’ t you know that all who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death ?
CEB	Romans	6	4	Therefore , we were buried together with him through baptism into his death , so that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father , we too can walk in newness of life .
CEB	Romans	6	5	If we were united together in a death like his , we will also be united together in a resurrection like his .
CEB	Romans	6	7	because a person who has died has been freed from sin ’ s power .
CEB	Romans	6	8	But if we died with Christ , we have faith that we will also live with him .
CEB	Romans	6	9	We know that Christ has been raised from the dead and he will never die again . Death no longer has power over him .
CEB	Romans	6	10	He died to sin once and for all with his death , but he lives for God with his life .
CEB	Romans	6	11	In the same way , you also should consider yourselves dead to sin but alive for God in Christ Jesus .
CEB	Romans	6	12	So then , don ’ t let sin rule your body , so that you do what it wants .
CEB	Romans	6	13	Don ’ t offer parts of your body to sin , to be used as weapons to do wrong . Instead , present yourselves to God as people who have been brought back to life from the dead , and offer all the parts of your body to God to be used as weapons to do right .
CEB	Romans	6	14	Sin will have no power over you , because you aren ’ t under Law but under grace . Freedom from sin
CEB	Romans	6	15	So what ? Should we sin because we aren ’ t under Law but under grace ? Absolutely not !
CEB	Romans	6	16	Don ’ t you know that if you offer yourselves to someone as obedient slaves , that you are slaves of the one whom you obey ? That ’ s true whether you serve as slaves of sin , which leads to death , or as slaves of the kind of obedience that leads to righteousness .
CEB	Romans	6	17	But thank God that although you used to be slaves of sin , you gave wholehearted obedience to the teaching that was handed down to you , which provides a pattern .
CEB	Romans	6	18	Now that you have been set free from sin , you have become slaves of righteousness .
CEB	Romans	6	19	( I ’ m speaking with ordinary metaphors because of your limitations . ) Once , you offered the parts of your body to be used as slaves to impurity and to lawless behavior that leads to still more lawless behavior . Now , you should present the parts of your body as slaves to righteousness , which makes your lives holy .
CEB	Romans	6	20	When you were slaves of sin , you were free from the control of righteousness .
CEB	Romans	6	21	What consequences did you get from doing things that you are now ashamed of ? The outcome of those things is death .
CEB	Romans	6	22	But now that you have been set free from sin and become slaves to God , you have the consequence of a holy life , and the outcome is eternal life .
CEB	Romans	6	23	The wages that sin pays are death , but God ’ s gift is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord .
CEB	Romans	7	7	So what are we going to say ? That the Law is sin ? Absolutely not ! But I wouldn ’ t have known sin except through the Law . I wouldn ’ t have known the desire for what others have if the Law had not said , Don ’ t desire to take what others have . [ a ]
CEB	Romans	7	2	A married woman is united with her husband under the Law while he is alive . But if her husband dies , she is released from the Law concerning her husband .
CEB	Romans	7	3	So then , if she lives with another man while her husband is alive , she ’ s committing adultery . But if her husband dies , she ’ s free from the Law , so she won ’ t be committing adultery if she marries someone else .
CEB	Romans	7	4	Therefore , my brothers and sisters , you also died with respect to the Law through the body of Christ , so that you could be united with someone else . You are united with the one who was raised from the dead so that we can bear fruit for God .
CEB	Romans	7	5	When we were self-centered , the sinful passions aroused through the Law were at work in all the parts of our body , so that we bore fruit for death .
CEB	Romans	7	6	But now we have been released from the Law . We have died with respect to the thing that controlled us , so that we can be slaves in the new life under the Spirit , not in the old life under the written Law . The function of the Law
CEB	Romans	7	8	But sin seized the opportunity and used this commandment to produce all kinds of desires in me . Sin is dead without the Law .
CEB	Romans	7	9	I used to be alive without the Law , but when the commandment came , sin sprang to life ,
CEB	Romans	7	10	and I died . So the commandment that was intended to give life brought death .
CEB	Romans	7	11	Sin seized the opportunity through the commandment , deceived me , and killed me .
CEB	Romans	7	12	So the Law itself is holy , and the commandment is holy , righteous , and good . Living under the Law
CEB	Romans	7	13	So did something good bring death to me ? Absolutely not ! But sin caused my death through something good so that sin would be exposed as sin . That way sin would become even more thoroughly sinful through the commandment .
CEB	Romans	7	14	We know that the Law is spiritual , but I ’ m made of flesh and blood , and I ’ m sold as a slave to sin .
CEB	Romans	7	15	I don ’ t know what I ’ m doing , because I don ’ t do what I want to do . Instead , I do the thing that I hate .
CEB	Romans	7	16	But if I ’ m doing the thing that I don ’ t want to do , I ’ m agreeing that the Law is right .
CEB	Romans	7	17	But now I ’ m not the one doing it anymore . Instead , it ’ s sin that lives in me .
CEB	Romans	7	18	I know that good doesn ’ t live in me—that is , in my body . The desire to do good is inside of me , but I can ’ t do it .
CEB	Romans	7	19	I don ’ t do the good that I want to do , but I do the evil that I don ’ t want to do .
CEB	Romans	7	20	But if I do the very thing that I don ’ t want to do , then I ’ m not the one doing it anymore . Instead , it is sin that lives in me that is doing it .
CEB	Romans	7	21	So I find that , as a rule , when I want to do what is good , evil is right there with me .
CEB	Romans	7	22	I gladly agree with the Law on the inside ,
CEB	Romans	7	23	but I see a different law at work in my body . It wages a war against the law of my mind and takes me prisoner with the law of sin that is in my body .
CEB	Romans	7	24	I ’ m a miserable human being . Who will deliver me from this dead corpse ?
CEB	Romans	7	25	Thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord ! So then I ’ m a slave to God ’ s Law in my mind , but I ’ m a slave to sin ’ s law in my body .
CEB	Romans	8	8	People who are self-centered aren ’ t able to please God .
CEB	Romans	8	2	The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and death .
CEB	Romans	8	3	God has done what was impossible for the Law , since it was weak because of selfishness . God condemned sin in the body by sending his own Son to deal with sin in the same body as humans , who are controlled by sin .
CEB	Romans	8	4	He did this so that the righteous requirement of the Law might be fulfilled in us . Now the way we live is based on the Spirit , not based on selfishness .
CEB	Romans	8	5	People whose lives are based on selfishness think about selfish things , but people whose lives are based on the Spirit think about things that are related to the Spirit .
CEB	Romans	8	6	The attitude that comes from selfishness leads to death , but the attitude that comes from the Spirit leads to life and peace .
CEB	Romans	8	7	So the attitude that comes from selfishness is hostile to God . It doesn ’ t submit to God ’ s Law , because it can ’ t .
CEB	Romans	8	9	But you aren ’ t self-centered . Instead you are in the Spirit , if in fact God ’ s Spirit lives in you . If anyone doesn ’ t have the Spirit of Christ , they don ’ t belong to him .
CEB	Romans	8	10	If Christ is in you , the Spirit is your life because of God ’ s righteousness , but the body is dead because of sin .
CEB	Romans	8	11	If the Spirit of the one who raised Jesus from the dead lives in you , the one who raised Christ from the dead will give life to your human bodies also , through his Spirit that lives in you .
CEB	Romans	8	12	So then , brothers and sisters , we have an obligation , but it isn ’ t an obligation to ourselves to live our lives on the basis of selfishness .
CEB	Romans	8	13	If you live on the basis of selfishness , you are going to die . But if by the Spirit you put to death the actions of the body , you will live .
CEB	Romans	8	14	All who are led by God ’ s Spirit are God ’ s sons and daughters .
CEB	Romans	8	15	You didn ’ t receive a spirit of slavery to lead you back again into fear , but you received a Spirit that shows you are adopted as his children . With this Spirit , we cry , “ Abba , Father. ”
CEB	Romans	8	16	The same Spirit agrees with our spirit , that we are God ’ s children .
CEB	Romans	8	17	But if we are children , we are also heirs . We are God ’ s heirs and fellow heirs with Christ , if we really suffer with him so that we can also be glorified with him . Our suffering and our hope
CEB	Romans	8	18	I believe that the present suffering is nothing compared to the coming glory that is going to be revealed to us .
CEB	Romans	8	19	The whole creation waits breathless with anticipation for the revelation of God ’ s sons and daughters .
CEB	Romans	8	20	Creation was subjected to frustration , not by its own choice—it was the choice of the one who subjected it—but in the hope
CEB	Romans	8	21	that the creation itself will be set free from slavery to decay and brought into the glorious freedom of God ’ s children .
CEB	Romans	8	22	We know that the whole creation is groaning together and suffering labor pains up until now .
CEB	Romans	8	23	And it ’ s not only the creation . We ourselves who have the Spirit as the first crop of the harvest also groan inside as we wait to be adopted and for our bodies to be set free .
CEB	Romans	8	24	We were saved in hope . If we see what we hope for , that isn ’ t hope . Who hopes for what they already see ?
CEB	Romans	8	25	But if we hope for what we don ’ t see , we wait for it with patience .
CEB	Romans	8	26	In the same way , the Spirit comes to help our weakness . We don ’ t know what we should pray , but the Spirit himself pleads our case with unexpressed groans .
CEB	Romans	8	27	The one who searches hearts knows how the Spirit thinks , because he pleads for the saints , consistent with God ’ s will .
CEB	Romans	8	28	We know that God works all things together for good for the ones who love God , for those who are called according to his purpose .
CEB	Romans	8	29	We know this because God knew them in advance , and he decided in advance that they would be conformed to the image of his Son . That way his Son would be the first of many brothers and sisters .
CEB	Romans	8	30	Those who God decided in advance would be conformed to his Son , he also called . Those whom he called , he also made righteous . Those whom he made righteous , he also glorified .
CEB	Romans	8	31	So what are we going to say about these things ? If God is for us , who is against us ?
CEB	Romans	8	32	He didn ’ t spare his own Son but gave him up for us all . Won ’ t he also freely give us all things with him ?
CEB	Romans	8	33	Who will bring a charge against God ’ s elect people ? It is God who acquits them .
CEB	Romans	8	34	Who is going to convict them ? It is Christ Jesus who died , even more , who was raised , and who also is at God ’ s right side . It is Christ Jesus who also pleads our case for us .
CEB	Romans	8	35	Who will separate us from Christ ’ s love ? Will we be separated by trouble , or distress , or harassment , or famine , or nakedness , or danger , or sword ?
CEB	Romans	8	36	As it is written , We are being put to death all day long for your sake . We are treated like sheep for slaughter . [ a ]
CEB	Romans	8	37	But in all these things we win a sweeping victory through the one who loved us .
CEB	Romans	8	38	I ’ m convinced that nothing can separate us from God ’ s love in Christ Jesus our Lord : not death or life , not angels or rulers , not present things or future things , not powers
CEB	Romans	8	39	or height or depth , or any other thing that is created .
CEB	Romans	9	9	The words in the promise were : A year from now I will return , and Sarah will have a son . [ b ]
CEB	Romans	9	2	I have great sadness and constant pain in my heart .
CEB	Romans	9	3	I wish I could be cursed , cut off from Christ if it helped my brothers and sisters , who are my flesh-and-blood relatives .
CEB	Romans	9	4	They are Israelites . The adoption as God ’ s children , the glory , the covenants , the giving of the Law , the worship , and the promises belong to them .
CEB	Romans	9	5	The Jewish ancestors are theirs , and the Christ descended from those ancestors . He is the one who rules over all things , who is God , and who is blessed forever . Amen . Israel and God ’ s choice
CEB	Romans	9	6	But it ’ s not as though God ’ s word has failed . Not all who are descended from Israel are part of Israel .
CEB	Romans	9	7	Not all of Abraham ’ s children are called Abraham ’ s descendants , but instead your descendants will be named through Isaac . [ a ]
CEB	Romans	9	8	That means it isn ’ t the natural children who are God ’ s children , but it is the children from the promise who are counted as descendants .
CEB	Romans	9	10	Not only that , but also Rebecca conceived children with one man , our ancestor Isaac .
CEB	Romans	9	11	When they hadn ’ t been born yet and when they hadn ’ t yet done anything good or bad , it was shown that God ’ s purpose would continue because it was based on his choice .
CEB	Romans	9	12	It wasn ’ t because of what was done but because of God ’ s call . This was said to her : The older child will be a slave to the younger one . [ c ]
CEB	Romans	9	13	As it is written , I loved Jacob , but I hated Esau . [ d ]
CEB	Romans	9	14	So what are we going to say ? Isn ’ t this unfair on God ’ s part ? Absolutely not !
CEB	Romans	9	15	He says to Moses , I ’ ll have mercy on whomever I choose to have mercy , and I ’ ll show compassion to whomever I choose to show compassion . [ e ]
CEB	Romans	9	16	So then , it doesn ’ t depend on a person ’ s desire or effort . It depends entirely on God , who shows mercy .
CEB	Romans	9	17	Scripture says to Pharaoh , I have put you in this position for this very thing : so I can show my power in you and so that my name can be spread through the entire earth . [ f ]
CEB	Romans	9	18	So then , God has mercy on whomever he wants to , but he makes resistant whomever he wants to .
CEB	Romans	9	19	So you are going to say to me , “ Then why does he still blame people ? Who has ever resisted his will ? ”
CEB	Romans	9	20	You are only a human being . Who do you think you are to talk back to God ? Does the clay say to the potter , “ Why did you make me like this ? ” [ g ]
CEB	Romans	9	21	Doesn ’ t the potter have the power over the clay to make one pot for special purposes and another for garbage from the same lump of clay ?
CEB	Romans	9	22	What if God very patiently puts up with pots made for wrath that were designed for destruction , because he wanted to show his wrath and to make his power known ?
CEB	Romans	9	23	What if he did this to make the wealth of his glory known toward pots made for mercy , which he prepared in advance for glory ?
CEB	Romans	9	24	We are the ones God has called . We don ’ t come only from the Jews but we also come from the Gentiles .
CEB	Romans	9	25	As it says also in Hosea , I will call “ my people ” those who aren ’ t my people , and the one who isn ’ t well loved , I will call “ loved one. ” [ h ]
CEB	Romans	9	26	And in the place where it was said to them , “ You aren ’ t my people , ” there they will be called “ the living God ’ s children. ” [ i ]
CEB	Romans	9	27	But Isaiah cries out for Israel , Though the number of Israel ’ s children will be like the sand of the sea , only a remaining part will be saved ,
CEB	Romans	9	28	because the Lord does what he says completely and quickly . [ j ]
CEB	Romans	9	29	As Isaiah prophesied , If the Lord of the heavenly forces had not left descendants for us , we would have been like Sodom , and we would have become like Gomorrah . [ k ] Israel and God ’ s righteousness
CEB	Romans	9	30	So what are we going to say ? Gentiles who weren ’ t striving for righteousness achieved righteousness , the righteousness that comes from faith .
CEB	Romans	9	31	But though Israel was striving for a Law of righteousness , they didn ’ t arrive .
CEB	Romans	9	32	Why ? It ’ s because they didn ’ t go for it by faith but they went for it as if it could be reached by doing something . They have tripped over a stumbling block .
CEB	Romans	9	33	As it is written : Look ! I ’ m putting a stumbling block in Zion , which is a rock that offends people . And the one who has faith in him will not be put to shame . [ l ]
CEB	Romans	10	10	Trusting with the heart leads to righteousness , and confessing with the mouth leads to salvation .
CEB	Romans	10	2	I can vouch for them : they are enthusiastic about God . However , it isn ’ t informed by knowledge .
CEB	Romans	10	3	They don ’ t submit to God ’ s righteousness because they don ’ t understand his righteousness , and they try to establish their own righteousness .
CEB	Romans	10	4	Christ is the goal of the Law , which leads to righteousness for all who have faith in God .
CEB	Romans	10	5	Moses writes about the righteousness that comes from the Law : The person who does these things will live by them . [ a ]
CEB	Romans	10	6	But the righteousness that comes from faith talks like this : Don ’ t say in your heart , “ Who will go up into heaven ? ” [ b ] ( that is , to bring Christ down )
CEB	Romans	10	7	or “ Who will go down into the region below ? ” [ c ] ( that is , to bring Christ up from the dead ) .
CEB	Romans	10	8	But what does it say ? The word is near you , in your mouth and in your heart [ d ] ( that is , the message of faith that we preach ) .
CEB	Romans	10	9	Because if you confess with your mouth “ Jesus is Lord ” and in your heart you have faith that God raised him from the dead , you will be saved .
CEB	Romans	10	11	The scripture says , All who have faith in him won ’ t be put to shame . [ e ]
CEB	Romans	10	12	There is no distinction between Jew and Greek , because the same Lord is Lord of all , who gives richly to all who call on him .
CEB	Romans	10	13	All who call on the Lord ’ s name will be saved . [ f ]
CEB	Romans	10	14	So how can they call on someone they don ’ t have faith in ? And how can they have faith in someone they haven ’ t heard of ? And how can they hear without a preacher ?
CEB	Romans	10	15	And how can they preach unless they are sent ? As it is written , How beautiful are the feet of those who announce the good news . [ g ]
CEB	Romans	10	16	But everyone hasn ’ t obeyed the good news . As Isaiah says , Lord , who has had faith in our message ? [ h ]
CEB	Romans	10	17	So , faith comes from listening , but it ’ s listening by means of Christ ’ s message .
CEB	Romans	10	18	But I ask you , didn ’ t they hear it ? Definitely ! Their voice has gone out into the entire earth , and their message has gone out to the corners of the inhabited world . [ i ]
CEB	Romans	10	19	But I ask you again , didn ’ t Israel understand ? First , Moses says , I will make you jealous of those who aren ’ t a people , of a people without understanding . [ j ]
CEB	Romans	10	20	And Isaiah even dares to say , I was found by those who didn ’ t look for me ; I revealed myself to those who didn ’ t ask for me . [ k ]
CEB	Romans	10	21	But he says about Israel , All day long I stretched out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people . [ l ]
CEB	Romans	11	11	So I ’ m asking you : They haven ’ t stumbled so that they ’ ve fallen permanently , have they ? Absolutely not ! But salvation has come to the Gentiles by their failure , in order to make Israel jealous .
CEB	Romans	11	2	God hasn ’ t rejected his people , whom he knew in advance . Or don ’ t you know what the scripture says in the case of Elijah , when he pleads with God against Israel ?
CEB	Romans	11	3	Lord , they have killed your prophets , and they have torn down your altars . I ’ m the only one left , and they are trying to take my life . [ a ]
CEB	Romans	11	4	But what is God ’ s reply to him ? I have kept for myself seven thousand people who haven ’ t bowed their knees to Baal . [ b ]
CEB	Romans	11	5	So also in the present time there is a remaining group by the choice of God ’ s grace .
CEB	Romans	11	6	But if it is by grace , it isn ’ t by what ’ s done anymore . If it were , God ’ s grace wouldn ’ t be grace .
CEB	Romans	11	7	So what ? Israel didn ’ t find what it was looking for . Those who were chosen found it , but the others were resistant .
CEB	Romans	11	8	As it is written , God gave them a dull spirit , so that their eyes would not see and their ears not hear , right up until the present day . [ c ]
CEB	Romans	11	9	And David says , Their table should become a pitfall and a trap , a stumbling block and payback to them for what they have done .
CEB	Romans	11	10	Their eyes should be darkened so they can ’ t see , and their backs always bent . [ d ]
CEB	Romans	11	12	But if their failure brings riches to the world , and their defeat brings riches to the Gentiles , how much more will come from the completion of their number !
CEB	Romans	11	13	I ’ m speaking to you Gentiles . Considering that I ’ m an apostle to the Gentiles , I publicize my own ministry
CEB	Romans	11	14	in the hope that somehow I might make my own people jealous and save some of them .
CEB	Romans	11	15	If their rejection has brought about a close relationship between God and the world , how can their acceptance mean anything less than life from the dead ?
CEB	Romans	11	16	But if part of a batch of dough is offered to God as holy , the whole batch of dough is holy too . If a root is holy , the branches will be holy too .
CEB	Romans	11	17	If some of the branches were broken off , and you were a wild olive branch , and you were grafted in among the other branches and shared the root that produces the rich oil of the olive tree ,
CEB	Romans	11	18	then don ’ t brag like you ’ re better than the other branches . If you do brag , be careful : it ’ s not you that sustains the root , but it ’ s the root that sustains you .
CEB	Romans	11	19	You will say then , “ Branches were broken off so that I could be grafted in. ”
CEB	Romans	11	20	Fine . They were broken off because they weren ’ t faithful , but you stand only by your faithfulness . [ e ] So don ’ t think in a proud way ; instead be afraid .
CEB	Romans	11	21	If God didn ’ t spare the natural branches , he won ’ t spare you either .
CEB	Romans	11	22	So look at God ’ s kindness and harshness . It ’ s harshness toward those who fell , but it ’ s God ’ s kindness for you , provided you continue in his kindness ; otherwise , you could be cut off too .
CEB	Romans	11	23	And even those who were cut off will be grafted back in if they don ’ t continue to be unfaithful , because God is able to graft them in again .
CEB	Romans	11	24	If you were naturally part of a wild olive tree and you were cut off from it , and then , contrary to nature , you were grafted into the cultivated olive tree , won ’ t these natural branches stand an even better chance of being grafted back onto their own olive tree ? All Israel will be saved
CEB	Romans	11	25	I don ’ t want you to be unaware of this secret , [ f ] brothers and sisters . That way you won ’ t think too highly of yourselves . A part of Israel has become resistant until the full number of the Gentiles comes in .
CEB	Romans	11	26	In this way , all Israel will be saved , as it is written : The deliverer will come from Zion . He will remove ungodly behavior from Jacob .
CEB	Romans	11	27	This is my covenant with them , when I take away their sins . [ g ]
CEB	Romans	11	28	According to the gospel , they are enemies for your sake , but according to God ’ s choice , they are loved for the sake of their ancestors .
CEB	Romans	11	29	God ’ s gifts and calling can ’ t be taken back .
CEB	Romans	11	30	Once you were disobedient to God , but now you have mercy because they were disobedient .
CEB	Romans	11	31	In the same way , they have also been disobedient because of the mercy that you received , so now they can receive mercy too .
CEB	Romans	11	32	God has locked up all people in disobedience , in order to have mercy on all of them .
CEB	Romans	11	33	God ’ s riches , wisdom , and knowledge are so deep ! They are as mysterious as his judgments , and they are as hard to track as his paths !
CEB	Romans	11	34	Who has known the Lord ’ s mind ? Or who has been his mentor ? [ h ]
CEB	Romans	11	35	Or who has given him a gift and has been paid back by him ? [ i ]
CEB	Romans	11	36	All things are from him and through him and for him . May the glory be to him forever . Amen .
CEB	Romans	12	12	Be happy in your hope , stand your ground when you ’ re in trouble , and devote yourselves to prayer .
CEB	Romans	12	2	Don ’ t be conformed to the patterns of this world , but be transformed by the renewing of your minds so that you can figure out what God ’ s will is—what is good and pleasing and mature . Transformed relationships
CEB	Romans	12	3	Because of the grace that God gave me , I can say to each one of you : don ’ t think of yourself more highly than you ought to think . Instead , be reasonable since God has measured out a portion of faith to each one of you .
CEB	Romans	12	4	We have many parts in one body , but the parts don ’ t all have the same function .
CEB	Romans	12	5	In the same way , though there are many of us , we are one body in Christ , and individually we belong to each other .
CEB	Romans	12	6	We have different gifts that are consistent with God ’ s grace that has been given to us . If your gift is prophecy , you should prophesy in proportion to your faith .
CEB	Romans	12	7	If your gift is service , devote yourself to serving . If your gift is teaching , devote yourself to teaching .
CEB	Romans	12	8	If your gift is encouragement , devote yourself to encouraging . The one giving should do it with no strings attached . The leader should lead with passion . The one showing mercy should be cheerful .
CEB	Romans	12	9	Love should be shown without pretending . Hate evil , and hold on to what is good .
CEB	Romans	12	10	Love each other like the members of your family . Be the best at showing honor to each other .
CEB	Romans	12	11	Don ’ t hesitate to be enthusiastic—be on fire in the Spirit as you serve the Lord !
CEB	Romans	12	13	Contribute to the needs of God ’ s people , and welcome strangers into your home .
CEB	Romans	12	14	Bless people who harass you—bless and don ’ t curse them .
CEB	Romans	12	15	Be happy with those who are happy , and cry with those who are crying .
CEB	Romans	12	16	Consider everyone as equal , and don ’ t think that you ’ re better than anyone else . Instead , associate with people who have no status . Don ’ t think that you ’ re so smart .
CEB	Romans	12	17	Don ’ t pay back anyone for their evil actions with evil actions , but show respect for what everyone else believes is good .
CEB	Romans	12	18	If possible , to the best of your ability , live at peace with all people .
CEB	Romans	12	19	Don ’ t try to get revenge for yourselves , my dear friends , but leave room for God ’ s wrath . It is written , Revenge belongs to me ; I will pay it back , says the Lord . [ a ]
CEB	Romans	12	20	Instead , If your enemy is hungry , feed him ; if he is thirsty , give him a drink . By doing this , you will pile burning coals of fire upon his head . [ b ]
CEB	Romans	12	21	Don ’ t be defeated by evil , but defeat evil with good .
CEB	Romans	13	13	Let ’ s behave appropriately as people who live in the day , not in partying and getting drunk , not in sleeping around and obscene behavior , not in fighting and obsession .
CEB	Romans	13	2	So anyone who opposes the authority is standing against what God has established . People who take this kind of stand will get punished .
CEB	Romans	13	3	The authorities don ’ t frighten people who are doing the right thing . Rather , they frighten people who are doing wrong . Would you rather not be afraid of authority ? Do what ’ s right , and you will receive its approval .
CEB	Romans	13	4	It is God ’ s servant given for your benefit . But if you do what ’ s wrong , be afraid because it doesn ’ t have weapons to enforce the law for nothing . It is God ’ s servant put in place to carry out his punishment on those who do what is wrong .
CEB	Romans	13	5	That is why it is necessary to place yourself under the government ’ s authority , not only to avoid God ’ s punishment but also for the sake of your conscience .
CEB	Romans	13	6	You should also pay taxes for the same reason , because the authorities are God ’ s assistants , concerned with this very thing .
CEB	Romans	13	7	So pay everyone what you owe them . Pay the taxes you owe , pay the duties you are charged , give respect to those you should respect , and honor those you should honor .
CEB	Romans	13	8	Don ’ t be in debt to anyone , except for the obligation to love each other . Whoever loves another person has fulfilled the Law .
CEB	Romans	13	9	The commandments , Don ’ t commit adultery , don ’ t murder , don ’ t steal , don ’ t desire what others have , [ a ] and any other commandments , are all summed up in one word : You must love your neighbor as yourself . [ b ]
CEB	Romans	13	10	Love doesn ’ t do anything wrong to a neighbor ; therefore , love is what fulfills the Law . The day is near
CEB	Romans	13	11	As you do all this , you know what time it is . The hour has already come for you to wake up from your sleep . Now our salvation is nearer than when we first had faith .
CEB	Romans	13	12	The night is almost over , and the day is near . So let ’ s get rid of the actions that belong to the darkness and put on the weapons of light .
CEB	Romans	13	14	Instead , dress yourself with the Lord Jesus Christ , and don ’ t plan to indulge your selfish desires .
CEB	Romans	14	14	I know and I ’ m convinced in the Lord Jesus that nothing is wrong to eat in itself . But if someone thinks something is wrong to eat , it becomes wrong for that person .
CEB	Romans	14	2	One person believes in eating everything , while the weak person eats only vegetables .
CEB	Romans	14	3	Those who eat must not look down on the ones who don ’ t , and the ones who don ’ t eat must not judge the ones who do , because God has accepted them .
CEB	Romans	14	4	Who are you to judge someone else ’ s servants ? They stand or fall before their own Lord ( and they will stand , because the Lord has the power to make them stand ) .
CEB	Romans	14	5	One person considers some days to be more sacred than others , while another person considers all days to be the same . Each person must have their own convictions .
CEB	Romans	14	6	Someone who thinks that a day is sacred , thinks that way for the Lord . Those who eat , eat for the Lord , because they thank God . And those who don ’ t eat , don ’ t eat for the Lord , and they thank the Lord too .
CEB	Romans	14	7	We don ’ t live for ourselves and we don ’ t die for ourselves .
CEB	Romans	14	8	If we live , we live for the Lord , and if we die , we die for the Lord . Therefore , whether we live or die , we belong to God .
CEB	Romans	14	9	This is why Christ died and lived : so that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living .
CEB	Romans	14	10	But why do you judge your brother or sister ? Or why do you look down on your brother or sister ? We all will stand in front of the judgment seat of God .
CEB	Romans	14	11	Because it is written , As I live , says the Lord , every knee will bow to me , and every tongue will give praise to God . [ a ]
CEB	Romans	14	12	So then , each of us will give an account of ourselves to God .
CEB	Romans	14	13	So stop judging each other . Instead , this is what you should decide : never put a stumbling block or obstacle in the way of your brother or sister .
CEB	Romans	14	15	If your brother or sister is upset by your food , you are no longer walking in love . Don ’ t let your food destroy someone for whom Christ died .
CEB	Romans	14	16	And don ’ t let something you consider to be good be criticized as wrong .
CEB	Romans	14	17	God ’ s kingdom isn ’ t about eating food and drinking but about righteousness , peace , and joy in the Holy Spirit .
CEB	Romans	14	18	Whoever serves Christ this way pleases God and gets human approval .
CEB	Romans	14	19	So let ’ s strive for the things that bring peace and the things that build each other up .
CEB	Romans	14	20	Don ’ t destroy what God has done because of food . All food is acceptable , but it ’ s a bad thing if it trips someone else .
CEB	Romans	14	21	It ’ s a good thing not to eat meat or drink wine or to do anything that trips your brother or sister .
CEB	Romans	14	22	Keep the belief that you have to yourself—it ’ s between you and God . People are blessed who don ’ t convict themselves by the things they approve .
CEB	Romans	14	23	But those who have doubts are convicted if they go ahead and eat , because they aren ’ t acting on the basis of faith . Everything that isn ’ t based on faith is sin .
CEB	Romans	15	15	But I ’ ve written to you in a sort of daring way , partly to remind you of what you already know . I ’ m writing to you in this way because of the grace that was given to me by God .
CEB	Romans	15	2	Each of us should please our neighbors for their good in order to build them up .
CEB	Romans	15	3	Christ didn ’ t please himself , but , as it is written , The insults of those who insulted you fell on me . [ a ]
CEB	Romans	15	4	Whatever was written in the past was written for our instruction so that we could have hope through endurance and through the encouragement of the scriptures .
CEB	Romans	15	5	May the God of endurance and encouragement give you the same attitude toward each other , similar to Christ Jesus ’ attitude .
CEB	Romans	15	6	That way you can glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ together with one voice .
CEB	Romans	15	7	So welcome each other , in the same way that Christ also welcomed you , for God ’ s glory .
CEB	Romans	15	8	I ’ m saying that Christ became a servant of those who are circumcised for the sake of God ’ s truth , in order to confirm the promises given to the ancestors ,
CEB	Romans	15	9	and so that the Gentiles could glorify God for his mercy . As it is written , Because of this I will confess you among the Gentiles , and I will sing praises to your name . [ b ]
CEB	Romans	15	10	And again , it says , Rejoice , Gentiles , with his people . [ c ]
CEB	Romans	15	11	And again , Praise the Lord , all you Gentiles , and all the people should sing his praises . [ d ]
CEB	Romans	15	12	And again , Isaiah says , There will be a root of Jesse , who will also rise to rule the Gentiles . The Gentiles will place their hope in him . [ e ]
CEB	Romans	15	13	May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in faith so that you overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit . Paul ’ s ministry to the Gentiles
CEB	Romans	15	14	My brothers and sisters , I myself am convinced that you yourselves are full of goodness , filled with all knowledge , and are able to teach each other .
CEB	Romans	15	16	It helps me to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles . I ’ m working as a priest of God ’ s gospel so that the offering of the Gentiles can be acceptable and made holy by the Holy Spirit .
CEB	Romans	15	17	So in Christ Jesus I brag about things that have to do with God .
CEB	Romans	15	18	I don ’ t dare speak about anything except what Christ has done through me to bring about the obedience of the Gentiles . He did it by what I ’ ve said and what I ’ ve done ,
CEB	Romans	15	19	by the power of signs and wonders , and by the power of God ’ s Spirit . So I ’ ve completed the circuit of preaching Christ ’ s gospel from Jerusalem all the way around to Illyricum .
CEB	Romans	15	20	In this way , I have a goal to preach the gospel where they haven ’ t heard of Christ yet , so that I won ’ t be building on someone else ’ s foundation .
CEB	Romans	15	21	Instead , as it ’ s written , Those who hadn ’ t been told about him will see , and those who hadn ’ t heard will understand . [ f ] Travel plans to visit Rome
CEB	Romans	15	22	That ’ s why I ’ ve been stopped so many times from coming to see you .
CEB	Romans	15	23	But now , since I don ’ t have any place to work in these regions anymore , and since I ’ ve wanted to come to see you for many years ,
CEB	Romans	15	24	I ’ ll visit you when I go to Spain . I hope to see you while I ’ m passing through . And I hope you will send me on my way there , after I have first been reenergized by some time in your company .
CEB	Romans	15	25	But now I ’ m going to Jerusalem , to serve God ’ s people .
CEB	Romans	15	26	Macedonia and Achaia have been happy to make a contribution for the poor among God ’ s people in Jerusalem .
CEB	Romans	15	27	They were happy to do this , and they are actually in debt to God ’ s people in Jerusalem . If the Gentiles got a share of the Jewish people ’ s spiritual resources , they ought to minister to them with material resources .
CEB	Romans	15	28	So then after I have finished this job and have safely delivered the final amount of the Gentiles ’ offering to them , I will leave for Spain , visiting you on the way .
CEB	Romans	15	29	And I know that when I come to you I will come with the fullest blessing of Christ .
CEB	Romans	15	30	Brothers and sisters , I urge you , through our Lord Jesus Christ and through the love of the Spirit , to join me in my struggles in your prayers to God for me .
CEB	Romans	15	31	Pray that I will be rescued from the people in Judea who don ’ t believe . Also , pray that my service for Jerusalem will be acceptable to God ’ s people there
CEB	Romans	15	32	so that I can come to you with joy by God ’ s will and be reenergized with your company .
CEB	Romans	15	33	May the God of peace be with you all . Amen .
CEB	Romans	16	16	Say hello to each other with a holy kiss . All the churches of Christ say hello to you . Warning against divisions
CEB	Romans	16	2	Welcome her in the Lord in a way that is worthy of God ’ s people , and give her whatever she needs from you , because she herself has been a sponsor of many people , myself included . Greetings to Roman Christians
CEB	Romans	16	3	Say hello to Prisca and Aquila , my coworkers in Christ Jesus ,
CEB	Romans	16	4	who risked their own necks for my life . I ’ m not the only one who thanks God for them , but all the churches of the Gentiles do the same .
CEB	Romans	16	5	Also say hello to the church that meets in their house . Say hello to Epaenetus , my dear friend , who was the first convert [ b ] in Asia for Christ .
CEB	Romans	16	6	Say hello to Mary , who has worked very hard for you .
CEB	Romans	16	7	Say hello to Andronicus and Junia , my relatives and my fellow prisoners . They are prominent among the apostles , and they were in Christ before me .
CEB	Romans	16	8	Say hello to Ampliatus , my dear friend in the Lord .
CEB	Romans	16	9	Say hello to Urbanus , our coworker in Christ , and my dear friend Stachys .
CEB	Romans	16	10	Say hello to Apelles , who is tried and true in Christ . Say hello to the members of the household of Aristobulus .
CEB	Romans	16	11	Say hello to my relative Herodion . Say hello to the members of the household of Narcissus who are in the Lord .
CEB	Romans	16	12	Say hello to Tryphaena and Tryphosa , who are workers for the Lord . Say hello to my dear friend Persis , who has worked hard in the Lord .
CEB	Romans	16	13	Say hello to Rufus , who is an outstanding believer , along with his mother and mine .
CEB	Romans	16	14	Say hello to Asyncritus , Phlegon , Hermes , Patrobas , Hermas , and the brothers and sisters who are with them .
CEB	Romans	16	15	Say hello to Philologus and Julia , Nereus and his sister , and Olympas , and all the saints who are with them .
CEB	Romans	16	17	Brothers and sisters , I urge you to watch out for people who create divisions and problems against the teaching that you learned . Keep away from them .
CEB	Romans	16	18	People like that aren ’ t serving the Lord . They are serving their own feelings . They deceive the hearts of innocent people with smooth talk and flattery .
CEB	Romans	16	19	The news of your obedience has reached everybody , so I ’ m happy for you . But I want you to be wise about what ’ s good , and innocent about what ’ s evil .
CEB	Romans	16	20	The God of peace will soon crush Satan [ c ] under your feet . The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you . Greetings from Paul ’ s coworkers
CEB	Romans	16	21	Timothy my coworker says hello to you , and Lucius , Jason , and Sosipater , my relatives .
CEB	Romans	16	22	I ’ m Tertius , and I ’ m writing this letter to you in the Lord—hello !
CEB	Romans	16	23	Gaius , who is host to me and to the whole church , says hello to you . Erastus the city treasurer says hello to you , along with our brother Quartus . [ d ] Final prayer
CEB	Romans	16	25	May the glory be to God who can strengthen you with my good news and the message that I preach about Jesus Christ . He can strengthen you with the announcement of the secret [ e ] that was kept quiet for a long time .
CEB	Romans	16	26	Now that secret is revealed through what the prophets wrote . It is made known to the Gentiles [ f ] in order to lead to their faithful obedience based on the command of the eternal God .
CEB	Romans	16	27	May the glory be to God , who alone is wise ! May the glory be to him through Jesus Christ forever ! Amen .

CEB	1%20Corinthians	1	1	From Paul , called by God ’ s will to be an apostle of Jesus Christ , and from Sosthenes our brother .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	1	2	To God ’ s church that is in Corinth : To those who have been made holy to God in Christ Jesus , who are called to be God ’ s people . Together with all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place—he ’ s their Lord and ours !
CEB	1%20Corinthians	1	3	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ . Thanksgiving for the Corinthians
CEB	1%20Corinthians	1	4	I thank my God always for you , because of God ’ s grace that was given to you in Christ Jesus .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	1	5	That is , you were made rich through him in everything : in all your communication and every kind of knowledge ,
CEB	1%20Corinthians	1	6	in the same way that the testimony about Christ was confirmed with you .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	1	7	The result is that you aren ’ t missing any spiritual gift while you wait for our Lord Jesus Christ to be revealed .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	1	8	He will also confirm your testimony about Christ until the end so that you will be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	1	9	God is faithful , and you were called by him to partnership with his Son , Jesus Christ our Lord . Rival groups in Corinth
CEB	1%20Corinthians	1	10	Now I encourage you , brothers and sisters , in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ : Agree with each other and don ’ t be divided into rival groups . Instead , be restored with the same mind and the same purpose .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	1	11	My brothers and sisters , Chloe ’ s people gave me some information about you , that you ’ re fighting with each other .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	1	12	What I mean is this : that each one of you says , “ I belong to Paul , ” “ I belong to Apollos , ” “ I belong to Cephas , ” “ I belong to Christ. ”
CEB	1%20Corinthians	1	13	Has Christ been divided ? Was Paul crucified for you , or were you baptized in Paul ’ s name ?
CEB	1%20Corinthians	1	14	Thank God that I didn ’ t baptize any of you , except Crispus and Gaius ,
CEB	1%20Corinthians	1	15	so that nobody can say that you were baptized in my name !
CEB	1%20Corinthians	1	16	Oh , I baptized the house of Stephanas too . Otherwise , I don ’ t know if I baptized anyone else .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	1	17	Christ didn ’ t send me to baptize but to preach the good news . And Christ didn ’ t send me to preach the good news with clever words so that Christ ’ s cross won ’ t be emptied of its meaning . Human wisdom versus the cross
CEB	1%20Corinthians	1	18	The message of the cross is foolishness to those who are being destroyed . But it is the power of God for those of us who are being saved .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	1	19	It is written in scripture : I will destroy the wisdom of the wise , and I will reject the intelligence of the intelligent . [ a ]
CEB	1%20Corinthians	1	20	Where are the wise ? Where are the legal experts ? Where are today ’ s debaters ? Hasn ’ t God made the wisdom of the world foolish ?
CEB	1%20Corinthians	1	21	In God ’ s wisdom , he determined that the world wouldn ’ t come to know him through its wisdom . Instead , God was pleased to save those who believe through the foolishness of preaching .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	1	22	Jews ask for signs , and Greeks look for wisdom ,
CEB	1%20Corinthians	1	23	but we preach Christ crucified , which is a scandal to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	1	24	But to those who are called—both Jews and Greeks—Christ is God ’ s power and God ’ s wisdom .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	1	25	This is because the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom , and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	1	26	Look at your situation when you were called , brothers and sisters ! By ordinary human standards not many were wise , not many were powerful , not many were from the upper class .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	1	27	But God chose what the world considers foolish to shame the wise . God chose what the world considers weak to shame the strong .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	1	28	And God chose what the world considers low-class and low-life—what is considered to be nothing—to reduce what is considered to be something to nothing .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	1	29	So no human being can brag in God ’ s presence .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	1	30	It is because of God that you are in Christ Jesus . He became wisdom from God for us . This means that he made us righteous and holy , and he delivered us .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	1	31	This is consistent with what was written : The one who brags should brag in the Lord ! [ b ]
CEB	1%20Corinthians	2	1	Corinthians
CEB	1%20Corinthians	2	2	I had made up my mind not to think about anything while I was with you except Jesus Christ , and to preach him as crucified .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	2	3	I stood in front of you with weakness , fear , and a lot of shaking .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	2	4	My message and my preaching weren ’ t presented with convincing wise words but with a demonstration of the Spirit and of power .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	2	5	I did this so that your faith might not depend on the wisdom of people but on the power of God . Definition of wisdom
CEB	1%20Corinthians	2	6	What we say is wisdom to people who are mature . It isn ’ t a wisdom that comes from the present day or from today ’ s leaders who are being reduced to nothing .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	2	7	We talk about God ’ s wisdom , which has been hidden as a secret . God determined this wisdom in advance , before time began , for our glory .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	2	8	It is a wisdom that none of the present-day rulers have understood , because if they did understand it , they would never have crucified the Lord of glory !
CEB	1%20Corinthians	2	9	But this is precisely what is written : God has prepared things for those who love him that no eye has seen , or ear has heard , or that haven ’ t crossed the mind of any human being . [ a ]
CEB	1%20Corinthians	2	10	God has revealed these things to us through the Spirit . The Spirit searches everything , including the depths of God .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	2	11	Who knows a person ’ s depths except their own spirit that lives in them ? In the same way , no one has known the depths of God except God ’ s Spirit .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	2	12	We haven ’ t received the world ’ s spirit but God ’ s Spirit so that we can know the things given to us by God .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	2	13	These are the things we are talking about—not with words taught by human wisdom but with words taught by the Spirit—we are interpreting spiritual things to spiritual people .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	2	14	But people who are unspiritual don ’ t accept the things from God ’ s Spirit . They are foolishness to them and can ’ t be understood , because they can only be comprehended in a spiritual way .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	2	15	Spiritual people comprehend everything , but they themselves aren ’ t understood by anyone .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	2	16	Who has known the mind of the Lord , who will advise him ? [ b ] But we have the mind of Christ .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	3	1	Corinthians
CEB	1%20Corinthians	3	3	Now you are still not up to it because you are still unspiritual . When jealousy and fighting exist between you , aren ’ t you unspiritual and living by human standards ?
CEB	1%20Corinthians	3	2	I gave you milk to drink instead of solid food , because you weren ’ t up to it yet .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	3	4	When someone says , “ I belong to Paul , ” and someone else says , “ I belong to Apollos , ” aren ’ t you acting like people without the Spirit ?
CEB	1%20Corinthians	3	5	After all , what is Apollos ? What is Paul ? They are servants who helped you to believe . Each one had a role given to them by the Lord :
CEB	1%20Corinthians	3	6	I planted , Apollos watered , but God made it grow .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	3	7	Because of this , neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything , but the only one who is anything is God who makes it grow .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	3	8	The one who plants and the one who waters work together , but each one will receive their own reward for their own labor .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	3	9	We are God ’ s coworkers , and you are God ’ s field , God ’ s building .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	3	10	I laid a foundation like a wise master builder according to God ’ s grace that was given to me , but someone else is building on top of it . Each person needs to pay attention to the way they build on it .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	3	11	No one can lay any other foundation besides the one that is already laid , which is Jesus Christ .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	3	12	So , whether someone builds on top of the foundation with gold , silver , precious stones , wood , grass , or hay ,
CEB	1%20Corinthians	3	13	each one ’ s work will be clearly shown . The day will make it clear , because it will be revealed with fire—the fire will test the quality of each one ’ s work .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	3	14	If anyone ’ s work survives , they ’ ll get a reward .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	3	15	But if anyone ’ s work goes up in flames , they ’ ll lose it . However , they themselves will be saved as if they had gone through a fire .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	3	16	Don ’ t you know that you are God ’ s temple and God ’ s Spirit lives in you ?
CEB	1%20Corinthians	3	17	If someone destroys God ’ s temple , God will destroy that person , because God ’ s temple is holy , which is what you are .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	3	18	Don ’ t fool yourself . If some of you think they are worldly-wise , then they should become foolish so that they can become wise .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	3	19	This world ’ s wisdom is foolishness to God . As it ’ s written , He catches the wise in their cleverness . [ a ]
CEB	1%20Corinthians	3	20	And also , The Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are silly . [ b ]
CEB	1%20Corinthians	3	21	So then , no one should brag about human beings . Everything belongs to you—
CEB	1%20Corinthians	3	22	Paul , Apollos , Cephas , the world , life , death , things in the present , things in the future—everything belongs to you ,
CEB	1%20Corinthians	3	23	but you belong to Christ , and Christ belongs to God .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	4	1	Corinthians
CEB	1%20Corinthians	4	4	I ’ m not aware of anything against me , but that doesn ’ t make me innocent , because the Lord is the one who judges me .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	4	2	In this kind of situation , what is expected of a manager is that they prove to be faithful .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	4	3	I couldn ’ t care less if I ’ m judged by you or by any human court ; I don ’ t even judge myself .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	4	5	So don ’ t judge anything before the right time—wait until the Lord comes . He will bring things that are hidden in the dark to light , and he will make people ’ s motivations public . Then there will be recognition for each person from God .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	4	6	Brothers and sisters , I have applied these things to myself and Apollos for your benefit . I ’ ve done this so that you can learn what it means not to go beyond what has been written and so none of you will become arrogant by supporting one of us against the other .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	4	7	Who says that you are better than anyone else ? What do you have that you didn ’ t receive ? And if you received it , then why are you bragging as if you didn ’ t receive it ?
CEB	1%20Corinthians	4	8	You ’ ve been filled already ! You ’ ve become rich already ! You rule like kings without us ! I wish you did rule so that we could be kings with you !
CEB	1%20Corinthians	4	9	I suppose that God has shown that we apostles are at the end of the line . We are like prisoners sentenced to death , because we have become a spectacle in the world , both to angels and to humans .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	4	10	We are fools for Christ , but you are wise through Christ ! We are weak , but you are strong ! You are honored , but we are dishonored !
CEB	1%20Corinthians	4	11	Up to this very moment we are hungry , thirsty , wearing rags , abused , and homeless .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	4	12	We work hard with our own hands . When we are insulted , we respond with a blessing ; when we are harassed , we put up with it ;
CEB	1%20Corinthians	4	13	when our reputation is attacked , we are encouraging . We have become the scum of the earth , the waste that runs off everything , up to the present time .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	4	14	I ’ m not writing these things to make you ashamed but to warn you , since you are my loved children .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	4	15	You may have ten thousand mentors in Christ , but you don ’ t have many fathers . I gave birth to you in Christ Jesus through the gospel ,
CEB	1%20Corinthians	4	16	so I encourage you to follow my example .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	4	17	This is why I ’ ve sent Timothy to you ; he ’ s my loved and trusted child in the Lord ; he ’ ll remind you about my way of life in Christ Jesus . He ’ ll teach the same way as I teach everywhere in every church .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	4	18	Some have become arrogant as if I ’ m not coming to see you .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	4	19	But , if the Lord is willing , I ’ ll come to you soon . Then I won ’ t focus on what these arrogant people say , but I ’ ll find out what power they possess .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	4	20	God ’ s kingdom isn ’ t about words but about power .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	4	21	Which do you want ? Should I come to you with a big stick to punish you , or with love and a gentle spirit ?
CEB	1%20Corinthians	5	1	Corinthians
CEB	1%20Corinthians	5	5	At that time we need to hand this man over to Satan to destroy his human weakness so that his spirit might be saved on the day of the Lord .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	5	2	And you ’ re proud of yourselves instead of being so upset that the one who did this thing is expelled from your community .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	5	3	Though I ’ m absent physically , I ’ m present in the spirit and I ’ ve already judged the man who did this as if I were present .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	5	4	When you meet together in the name of our Lord Jesus , I ’ ll be present in spirit with the power of our Lord Jesus .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	5	6	Your bragging isn ’ t good ! Don ’ t you know that a tiny grain of yeast makes a whole batch of dough rise ?
CEB	1%20Corinthians	5	7	Clean out the old yeast so you can be a new batch of dough , given that you ’ re supposed to be unleavened bread . Christ our Passover lamb has been sacrificed ,
CEB	1%20Corinthians	5	8	so let ’ s celebrate the feast with the unleavened bread of honesty and truth , not with old yeast or with the yeast of evil and wickedness .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	5	9	I wrote to you in my earlier letter not to associate with sexually immoral people .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	5	10	But I wasn ’ t talking about the sexually immoral people in the outside world by any means—or the greedy , or the swindlers , or people who worship false gods—otherwise , you would have to leave the world entirely !
CEB	1%20Corinthians	5	11	But now I ’ m writing to you not to associate with anyone who calls themselves “ brother ” or “ sister ” who is sexually immoral , greedy , someone who worships false gods , an abusive person , a drunk , or a swindler . Don ’ t even eat with anyone like this .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	5	12	What do I care about judging outsiders ? Isn ’ t it your job to judge insiders ?
CEB	1%20Corinthians	5	13	God will judge outsiders . Expel the evil one from among you ! [ a ]
CEB	1%20Corinthians	6	1	Corinthians 6:16 Gen 2:24
CEB	1%20Corinthians	6	6	But instead , does a brother or sister have a lawsuit against another brother or sister , and do they do this in front of unbelievers ?
CEB	1%20Corinthians	6	2	Or don ’ t you know that God ’ s people will judge the world ? If the world is to be judged by you , are you incompetent to judge trivial cases ?
CEB	1%20Corinthians	6	3	Don ’ t you know that we will judge angels ? Why not ordinary things ?
CEB	1%20Corinthians	6	4	So then if you have ordinary lawsuits , do you appoint people as judges who aren ’ t respected by the church ?
CEB	1%20Corinthians	6	5	I ’ m saying this because you should be ashamed of yourselves ! Isn ’ t there one person among you who is wise enough to pass judgment between believers ?
CEB	1%20Corinthians	6	7	The fact that you have lawsuits against each other means that you ’ ve already lost your case . Why not be wronged instead ? Why not be cheated ?
CEB	1%20Corinthians	6	8	But instead you are doing wrong and cheating—and you ’ re doing it to your own brothers and sisters .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	6	9	Don ’ t you know that people who are unjust won ’ t inherit God ’ s kingdom ? Don ’ t be deceived . Those who are sexually immoral , those who worship false gods , adulterers , both participants in same-sex intercourse , [ a ]
CEB	1%20Corinthians	6	10	thieves , the greedy , drunks , abusive people , and swindlers won ’ t inherit God ’ s kingdom .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	6	11	That is what some of you used to be ! But you were washed clean , you were made holy to God , and you were made right with God in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God . Avoid sexual immorality
CEB	1%20Corinthians	6	12	I have the freedom to do anything , but not everything is helpful . I have the freedom to do anything , but I won ’ t be controlled by anything .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	6	13	Food is for the stomach and the stomach is for food , and yet God will do away with both . The body isn ’ t for sexual immorality but for the Lord , and the Lord is for the body .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	6	14	God has raised the Lord and will raise us through his power .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	6	15	Don ’ t you know that your bodies are parts of Christ ? So then , should I take parts of Christ and make them a part of someone who is sleeping around ? [ b ] No way !
CEB	1%20Corinthians	6	16	Don ’ t you know that anyone who is joined to someone who is sleeping around is one body with that person ? The scripture says , The two will become one flesh . [ c ]
CEB	1%20Corinthians	6	17	The one who is joined to the Lord is one spirit with him .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	6	18	Avoid sexual immorality ! Every sin that a person can do is committed outside the body , except those who engage in sexual immorality commit sin against their own bodies .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	6	19	Or don ’ t you know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you ? Don ’ t you know that you have the Holy Spirit from God , and you don ’ t belong to yourselves ?
CEB	1%20Corinthians	6	20	You have been bought and paid for , so honor God with your body . Footnotes -
CEB	1%20Corinthians	7	1	Corinthians 7:25 Or virgins
CEB	1%20Corinthians	7	7	I wish all people were like me , but each has a particular gift from God : one has this gift , and another has that one .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	7	2	Each man should have his own wife , and each woman should have her own husband because of sexual immorality .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	7	3	The husband should meet his wife ’ s sexual needs , and the wife should do the same for her husband .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	7	4	The wife doesn ’ t have authority over her own body , but the husband does . Likewise , the husband doesn ’ t have authority over his own body , but the wife does .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	7	5	Don ’ t refuse to meet each other ’ s needs unless you both agree for a short period of time to devote yourselves to prayer . Then come back together again so that Satan might not tempt you because of your lack of self-control .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	7	6	I ’ m saying this to give you permission ; it ’ s not a command .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	7	8	I ’ m telling those who are single and widows that it ’ s good for them to stay single like me .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	7	9	But if they can ’ t control themselves , they should get married , because it ’ s better to marry than to burn with passion .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	7	10	I ’ m passing on the Lord ’ s command to those who are married : A wife shouldn ’ t leave her husband ,
CEB	1%20Corinthians	7	11	but if she does leave him , then she should stay single or be reconciled to her husband . And a man shouldn ’ t divorce his wife .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	7	12	I ’ m telling everyone else ( the Lord didn ’ t say this specifically ) : If a believer has a wife who doesn ’ t believe , and she agrees to live with him , then he shouldn ’ t divorce her .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	7	13	If a woman has a husband who doesn ’ t believe and he agrees to live with her , then she shouldn ’ t divorce him .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	7	14	The husband who doesn ’ t believe belongs to God because of his wife , and the wife who doesn ’ t believe belongs to God because of her husband . Otherwise , your children would be contaminated by the world , but now they are spiritually set apart .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	7	15	But if a spouse who doesn ’ t believe chooses to leave , then let them leave . The brother or sister isn ’ t tied down in these circumstances . God has called you to peace .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	7	16	How do you know as a wife if you will save your husband ? Or how do you know as a husband if you will save your wife ?
CEB	1%20Corinthians	7	17	Nevertheless , each person should live the kind of life that the Lord assigned when he called each one . This is what I teach in all the churches .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	7	18	If someone was circumcised when called , he shouldn ’ t try to reverse it . If someone wasn ’ t circumcised when he was called , he shouldn ’ t be circumcised .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	7	19	Circumcision is nothing ; not being circumcised is nothing . What matters is keeping God ’ s commandments .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	7	20	Each person should stay in the situation they were in when they were called .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	7	21	If you were a slave when you were called , don ’ t let it bother you . But if you are actually able to be free , take advantage of the opportunity .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	7	22	Anyone who was a slave when they were called by the Lord has the status of being the Lord ’ s free person . In the same way , anyone who was a free person when they were called is Christ ’ s slave .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	7	23	You were bought and paid for . Don ’ t become slaves of people .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	7	24	So then , brothers and sisters , each of you should stay with God in the situation you were in when you were called .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	7	25	I don ’ t have a command from the Lord about people who have never been married , [ a ] but I ’ ll give you my opinion as someone you can trust because of the Lord ’ s mercy .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	7	26	So I think this advice is good because of the present crisis : Stay as you are .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	7	27	If you are married , don ’ t get a divorce . If you are divorced , don ’ t try to find a spouse .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	7	28	But if you do marry , you haven ’ t sinned ; and if someone who hasn ’ t been married gets married , they haven ’ t sinned . But married people will have a hard time , and I ’ m trying to spare you that .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	7	29	This is what I ’ m saying , brothers and sisters : The time has drawn short . From now on , those who have wives should be like people who don ’ t have them .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	7	30	Those who are sad should be like people who aren ’ t crying . Those who are happy should be like people who aren ’ t happy . Those who buy something should be like people who don ’ t have possessions .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	7	31	Those who use the world should be like people who aren ’ t preoccupied with it , because this world in its present form is passing away .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	7	32	I want you to be free from concerns . A man who isn ’ t married is concerned about the Lord ’ s concerns—how he can please the Lord .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	7	33	But a married man is concerned about the world ’ s concerns—how he can please his wife .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	7	34	His attention is divided . A woman who isn ’ t married or who is a virgin is concerned about the Lord ’ s concerns so that she can be dedicated to God in both body and spirit . But a married woman is concerned about the world ’ s concerns—how she can please her husband .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	7	35	I ’ m saying this for your own advantage . It ’ s not to restrict you but rather to promote effective and consistent service to the Lord without distraction .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	7	36	If someone thinks he is acting inappropriately toward an unmarried woman whom he knows , and if he has strong feelings and it seems like the right thing to do , he should do what he wants—he ’ s not sinning—they should get married .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	7	37	But if a man stands firm in his decision , and doesn ’ t feel the pressure , but has his own will under control , he does right if he decides in his own heart not to marry the woman .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	7	38	Therefore , the one who marries the unmarried woman does right , and the one who doesn ’ t get married will do even better .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	7	39	A woman is obligated to stay in her marriage as long as her husband is alive . But if her husband dies , she is free to marry whomever she wants , only it should be a believer in the Lord .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	7	40	But in my opinion , she will be happier if she stays the way she is . And I think that I have God ’ s Spirit too . Footnotes -
CEB	1%20Corinthians	8	1	Corinthians
CEB	1%20Corinthians	8	8	Food won ’ t bring us close to God . We ’ re not missing out if we don ’ t eat , and we don ’ t have any advantage if we do eat .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	8	2	If anyone thinks they know something , they don ’ t yet know as much as they should know .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	8	3	But if someone loves God , then they are known by God .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	8	4	So concerning the actual food involved in these sacrifices to false gods , we know that a false god isn ’ t anything in this world , and that there is no God except for the one God .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	8	5	Granted , there are so-called “ gods , ” in heaven and on the earth , as there are many gods and many lords .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	8	6	However , for us believers , There is one God the Father . All things come from him , and we belong to him . And there is one Lord Jesus Christ . All things exist through him , and we live through him .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	8	7	But not everybody knows this . Some are eating this food as though it really is food sacrificed to a real idol , because they were used to idol worship until now . Their conscience is weak because it has been damaged .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	8	9	But watch out or else this freedom of yours might be a problem for those who are weak .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	8	10	Suppose someone sees you ( the person who has knowledge ) eating in an idol ’ s temple . Won ’ t the person with a weak conscience be encouraged to eat the meat sacrificed to false gods ?
CEB	1%20Corinthians	8	11	The weak brother or sister for whom Christ died is destroyed by your knowledge .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	8	12	You sin against Christ if you sin against your brothers and sisters and hurt their weak consciences this way .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	8	13	This is why , if food causes the downfall of my brother or sister , I won ’ t eat meat ever again , or else I may cause my brother or sister to fall .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	9	1	Corinthians
CEB	1%20Corinthians	9	9	In Moses ’ Law it ’ s written : You will not muzzle the ox when it is threshing . [ a ] Is God worried about oxen ,
CEB	1%20Corinthians	9	2	If I ’ m not an apostle to others , at least I am to you ! You are the seal that shows I ’ m an apostle .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	9	3	This is my defense against those who criticize me .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	9	4	Don ’ t we have the right to eat and drink ?
CEB	1%20Corinthians	9	5	Don ’ t we have the right to travel with a wife who believes like the rest of the apostles , the Lord ’ s brothers , and Cephas ?
CEB	1%20Corinthians	9	6	Or is it only I and Barnabas who don ’ t have the right to not work for our living ?
CEB	1%20Corinthians	9	7	Who joins the army and pays their own way ? Who plants a vineyard and doesn ’ t eat its fruit ? Who shepherds a flock and doesn ’ t drink its milk ?
CEB	1%20Corinthians	9	8	I ’ m not saying these things just based on common sense , am I ? Doesn ’ t the Law itself say these things ?
CEB	1%20Corinthians	9	10	or did he say this entirely for our sake ? It was written for our sake because the one who plows and the one who threshes should each do so with the hope of sharing the produce .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	9	11	If we sowed spiritual things in you , is it so much to ask to harvest some material things from you ?
CEB	1%20Corinthians	9	12	If others have these rights over you , don ’ t we deserve them all the more ? However , we haven ’ t made use of this right , but we put up with everything so we don ’ t put any obstacle in the way of the gospel of Christ .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	9	13	Don ’ t you know that those who serve in the temple get to eat food from the temple , and those who serve at the altar share part of what is sacrificed on the altar ?
CEB	1%20Corinthians	9	14	In the same way , the Lord commanded that those who preach the gospel should get their living from the gospel .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	9	15	But I haven ’ t taken advantage of this . And I ’ m not writing this so that it will be done for me . It ’ s better for me to die than to lose my right to brag about this !
CEB	1%20Corinthians	9	16	If I preach the gospel , I have no reason to brag , since I ’ m obligated to do it . I ’ m in trouble if I don ’ t preach the gospel .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	9	17	If I do this voluntarily , I get rewarded for it . But if I ’ m forced to do it , then I ’ ve been charged with a responsibility .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	9	18	What reward do I get ? That when I preach , I offer the good news free of charge . That ’ s why I don ’ t use the rights to which I ’ m entitled through the gospel .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	9	19	Although I ’ m free from all people , I make myself a slave to all people , to recruit more of them .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	9	20	I act like a Jew to the Jews , so I can recruit Jews . I act like I ’ m under the Law to those under the Law , so I can recruit those who are under the Law ( though I myself am not under the Law ) .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	9	21	I act like I ’ m outside the Law to those who are outside the Law , so I can recruit those outside the Law ( though I ’ m not outside the law of God but rather under the law of Christ ) .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	9	22	I act weak to the weak , so I can recruit the weak . I have become all things to all people , so I could save some by all possible means .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	9	23	All the things I do are for the sake of the gospel , so I can be a partner with it .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	9	24	Don ’ t you know that all the runners in the stadium run , but only one gets the prize ? So run to win .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	9	25	Everyone who competes practices self-discipline in everything . The runners do this to get a crown of leaves that shrivel up and die , but we do it to receive a crown that never dies .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	9	26	So now this is how I run—not without a clear goal in sight . I fight like a boxer in the ring , not like someone who is shadowboxing .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	9	27	Rather , I ’ m landing punches on my own body and subduing it like a slave . I do this to be sure that I myself won ’ t be disqualified after preaching to others .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	10	1	Corinthians
CEB	1%20Corinthians	10	10	Let ’ s not grumble , like some of them did , and were killed by the destroyer .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	10	2	All were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	10	3	All ate the same spiritual food ,
CEB	1%20Corinthians	10	4	and all drank the same spiritual drink . They drank from a spiritual rock that followed them , and the rock was Christ .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	10	5	However , God was unhappy with most of them , and they were struck down in the wilderness .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	10	6	These things were examples for us , so we won ’ t crave evil things like they did .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	10	7	Don ’ t worship false gods like some of them did , as it is written , The people sat down to eat and drink and they got up to play . [ a ]
CEB	1%20Corinthians	10	8	Let ’ s not practice sexual immorality , like some of them did , and twenty-three thousand died in one day .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	10	9	Let ’ s not test Christ , like some of them did , and were killed by the snakes .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	10	11	These things happened to them as an example and were written as a warning for us to whom the end of time has come .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	10	12	So those who think they are standing need to watch out or else they may fall .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	10	13	No temptation has seized you that isn ’ t common for people . But God is faithful . He won ’ t allow you to be tempted beyond your abilities . Instead , with the temptation , God will also supply a way out so that you will be able to endure it . Avoid false gods to glorify God
CEB	1%20Corinthians	10	14	So then , my dear friends , run away from the worship of false gods !
CEB	1%20Corinthians	10	15	I ’ m talking to you like you are sensible people . Think about what I ’ m saying .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	10	16	Isn ’ t the cup of blessing that we bless a sharing in the blood of Christ ? Isn ’ t the loaf of bread that we break a sharing in the body of Christ ?
CEB	1%20Corinthians	10	17	Since there is one loaf of bread , we who are many are one body , because we all share the one loaf of bread .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	10	18	Look at the people of Israel . Don ’ t those who eat the sacrifices share from the altar ?
CEB	1%20Corinthians	10	19	What am I saying then ? That food sacrificed to a false god is anything , or that a false god is anything ?
CEB	1%20Corinthians	10	20	No , but this kind of sacrifice is sacrificed to demons and not to God . I don ’ t want you to be sharing in demons .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	10	21	You can ’ t drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons ; you can ’ t participate in the table of the Lord and the table of demons .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	10	22	Or should we make the Lord jealous ? We aren ’ t stronger than he is , are we ?
CEB	1%20Corinthians	10	23	Everything is permitted , but everything isn ’ t beneficial . Everything is permitted , but everything doesn ’ t build others up .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	10	24	No one should look out for their own advantage , but they should look out for each other .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	10	25	Eat everything that is sold in the marketplace , without asking questions about it because of your conscience .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	10	26	The earth and all that is in it belong to the Lord . [ b ]
CEB	1%20Corinthians	10	27	If an unbeliever invites you to eat with them and you want to go , eat whatever is served , without asking questions because of your conscience .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	10	28	But if someone says to you , “ This meat was sacrificed in a temple , ” then don ’ t eat it for the sake of the one who told you and for the sake of conscience .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	10	29	Now when I say “ conscience ” I don ’ t mean yours but the other person ’ s . Why should my freedom be judged by someone else ’ s conscience ?
CEB	1%20Corinthians	10	30	If I participate with gratitude , why should I be blamed for food I thank God for ?
CEB	1%20Corinthians	10	31	So , whether you eat or drink or whatever you do , you should do it all for God ’ s glory .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	10	32	Don ’ t offend either Jews or Greeks , or God ’ s church .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	10	33	This is the same thing that I do . I please everyone in everything I do . I don ’ t look out for my own advantage , but I look out for many people so that they can be saved .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	11	1	Follow my example , just like I follow Christ ’ s . Appropriate dress in worship
CEB	1%20Corinthians	11	11	However , woman isn ’ t independent from man , and man isn ’ t independent from woman in the Lord .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	11	2	I praise you because you remember all my instructions , and you hold on to the traditions exactly as I handed them on to you .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	11	3	Now I want you to know that the head of every man is Christ , and the head of the woman is the man , and the head of Christ is God .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	11	4	Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered shames his head .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	11	5	Every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered disgraces her head . It is the same thing as having her head shaved .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	11	6	If a woman doesn ’ t cover her head , then she should have her hair cut off . If it is disgraceful for a woman to have short hair or to be shaved , then she should keep her head covered .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	11	7	A man shouldn ’ t have his head covered , because he is the image and glory of God ; but the woman is man ’ s glory .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	11	8	Man didn ’ t have his origin from woman , but woman from man ;
CEB	1%20Corinthians	11	9	and man wasn ’ t created for the sake of the woman , but the woman for the sake of the man .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	11	10	Because of this a woman should have authority over her head , because of the angels .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	11	12	As woman came from man so also man comes from woman . But everything comes from God .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	11	13	Judge for yourselves : Is it appropriate for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered ?
CEB	1%20Corinthians	11	14	Doesn ’ t nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair , it is a disgrace to him ;
CEB	1%20Corinthians	11	15	but if a woman has long hair , it is her glory ? This is because her long hair is given to her for a covering .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	11	16	But if someone wants to argue about this , we don ’ t have such a custom , nor do God ’ s churches . The community meal
CEB	1%20Corinthians	11	17	Now I don ’ t praise you as I give the following instruction because when you meet together , it does more harm than good .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	11	18	First of all , when you meet together as a church , I hear that there are divisions among you , and I partly believe it .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	11	19	It ’ s necessary that there are groups among you , to make it clear who is genuine .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	11	20	So when you get together in one place , it isn ’ t to eat the Lord ’ s meal .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	11	21	Each of you goes ahead and eats a private meal . One person goes hungry while another is drunk .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	11	22	Don ’ t you have houses to eat and drink in ? Or do you look down on God ’ s churches and humiliate those who have nothing ? What can I say to you ? Will I praise you ? No , I don ’ t praise you in this .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	11	23	I received a tradition from the Lord , which I also handed on to you : on the night on which he was betrayed , the Lord Jesus took bread .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	11	24	After giving thanks , he broke it and said , “ This is my body , which is for you ; do this to remember me. ”
CEB	1%20Corinthians	11	25	He did the same thing with the cup , after they had eaten , saying , “ This cup is the new covenant in my blood . Every time you drink it , do this to remember me. ”
CEB	1%20Corinthians	11	26	Every time you eat this bread and drink this cup , you broadcast the death of the Lord until he comes .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	11	27	This is why those who eat the bread or drink the cup of the Lord inappropriately will be guilty of the Lord ’ s body and blood .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	11	28	Each individual should test himself or herself , and eat from the bread and drink from the cup in that way .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	11	29	Those who eat and drink without correctly understanding the body are eating and drinking their own judgment .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	11	30	Because of this , many of you are weak and sick , and quite a few have died .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	11	31	But if we had judged ourselves , we wouldn ’ t be judged .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	11	32	However , we are disciplined by the Lord when we are judged so that we won ’ t be judged and condemned along with the whole world .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	11	33	For these reasons , my brothers and sisters , when you get together to eat , wait for each other .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	11	34	If some of you are hungry , they should eat at home so that getting together doesn ’ t lead to judgment . I will give directions about the other things when I come .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	12	1	Corinthians 12:10 Or ecstatic speech or languages could be used for tongues or tongue throughout chaps 12–14 .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	12	12	Christ is just like the human body—a body is a unit and has many parts ; and all the parts of the body are one body , even though there are many .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	12	2	You know that when you were Gentiles you were often misled by false gods that can ’ t even speak .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	12	3	So I want to make it clear to you that no one says , “ Jesus is cursed ! ” when speaking by God ’ s Spirit , and no one can say , “ Jesus is Lord , ” except by the Holy Spirit .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	12	4	There are different spiritual gifts but the same Spirit ;
CEB	1%20Corinthians	12	5	and there are different ministries and the same Lord ;
CEB	1%20Corinthians	12	6	and there are different activities but the same God who produces all of them in everyone .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	12	7	A demonstration of the Spirit is given to each person for the common good .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	12	8	A word of wisdom is given by the Spirit to one person , a word of knowledge to another according to the same Spirit ,
CEB	1%20Corinthians	12	9	faith to still another by the same Spirit , gifts of healing to another in the one Spirit ,
CEB	1%20Corinthians	12	10	performance of miracles to another , prophecy to another , the ability to tell spirits apart to another , different kinds of tongues [ a ] to another , and the interpretation of the tongues to another .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	12	11	All these things are produced by the one and same Spirit who gives what he wants to each person .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	12	13	We were all baptized by one Spirit into one body , whether Jew or Greek , or slave or free , and we all were given one Spirit to drink .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	12	14	Certainly the body isn ’ t one part but many .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	12	15	If the foot says , “ I ’ m not part of the body because I ’ m not a hand , ” does that mean it ’ s not part of the body ?
CEB	1%20Corinthians	12	16	If the ear says , “ I ’ m not part of the body because I ’ m not an eye , ” does that mean it ’ s not part of the body ?
CEB	1%20Corinthians	12	17	If the whole body were an eye , what would happen to the hearing ? And if the whole body were an ear , what would happen to the sense of smell ?
CEB	1%20Corinthians	12	18	But as it is , God has placed each one of the parts in the body just like he wanted .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	12	19	If all were one and the same body part , what would happen to the body ?
CEB	1%20Corinthians	12	20	But as it is , there are many parts but one body .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	12	21	So the eye can ’ t say to the hand , “ I don ’ t need you , ” or in turn , the head can ’ t say to the feet , “ I don ’ t need you. ”
CEB	1%20Corinthians	12	22	Instead , the parts of the body that people think are the weakest are the most necessary .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	12	23	The parts of the body that we think are less honorable are the ones we honor the most . The private parts of our body that aren ’ t presentable are the ones that are given the most dignity .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	12	24	The parts of our body that are presentable don ’ t need this . But God has put the body together , giving greater honor to the part with less honor
CEB	1%20Corinthians	12	25	so that there won ’ t be division in the body and so the parts might have mutual concern for each other .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	12	26	If one part suffers , all the parts suffer with it ; if one part gets the glory , all the parts celebrate with it .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	12	27	You are the body of Christ and parts of each other .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	12	28	In the church , God has appointed first apostles , second prophets , third teachers , then miracles , then gifts of healing , the ability to help others , leadership skills , different kinds of tongues .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	12	29	All aren ’ t apostles , are they ? All aren ’ t prophets , are they ? All aren ’ t teachers , are they ? All don ’ t perform miracles , do they ?
CEB	1%20Corinthians	12	30	All don ’ t have gifts of healing , do they ? All don ’ t speak in different tongues , do they ? All don ’ t interpret , do they ?
CEB	1%20Corinthians	12	31	Use your ambition to try to get the greater gifts . And I ’ m going to show you an even better way . Footnotes -

CEB	1%20Corinthians	13	13	Now faith , hope , and love remain—these three things—and the greatest of these is love .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	13	2	If I have the gift of prophecy and I know all the mysteries and everything else , and if I have such complete faith that I can move mountains but I don ’ t have love , I ’ m nothing .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	13	3	If I give away everything that I have and hand over my own body to feel good about what I ’ ve done but I don ’ t have love , I receive no benefit whatsoever .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	13	4	Love is patient , love is kind , it isn ’ t jealous , it doesn ’ t brag , it isn ’ t arrogant ,
CEB	1%20Corinthians	13	5	it isn ’ t rude , it doesn ’ t seek its own advantage , it isn ’ t irritable , it doesn ’ t keep a record of complaints ,

CEB	1%20Corinthians	13	11	When I was a child , I used to speak like a child , reason like a child , think like a child . But now that I have become a man , I ’ ve put an end to childish things .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	13	12	Now we see a reflection in a mirror ; then we will see face-to-face . Now I know partially , but then I will know completely in the same way that I have been completely known .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	14	1	Corinthians
CEB	1%20Corinthians	14	14	If I pray in a tongue , my spirit prays but my mind isn ’ t productive .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	14	2	This is because those who speak in a tongue don ’ t speak to people but to God ; no one understands it—they speak mysteries by the Spirit .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	14	3	Those who prophesy speak to people , building them up , and giving them encouragement and comfort .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	14	4	People who speak in a tongue build up themselves ; those who prophesy build up the church .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	14	5	I wish that all of you spoke in tongues , but I ’ d rather you could prophesy . Those who prophesy are more important than those who speak in tongues , unless they are able to interpret them so that the church might be built up .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	14	6	After all , brothers and sisters , if I come to you speaking in tongues , how will I help you unless I speak to you with a revelation , some knowledge , a prophecy , or a teaching ?
CEB	1%20Corinthians	14	7	Likewise , things that aren ’ t alive like a harp or a lyre can make a sound , but if there aren ’ t different notes in the sounds they make , how will the tune from the harp or the lyre be recognized ?
CEB	1%20Corinthians	14	8	And if a trumpet call is unrecognizable , then who will prepare for battle ?
CEB	1%20Corinthians	14	9	It ’ s the same way with you : If you don ’ t use language that is easy to understand when you speak in a tongue , then how will anyone understand what is said ?
CEB	1%20Corinthians	14	10	It will be as if you are speaking into the air ! There are probably many language families in the world , and none of them are without meaning .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	14	11	So if I don ’ t know the meaning of the language , then I will be like a foreigner to those who speak it , and they will be like foreigners to me .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	14	12	The same holds true for you : since you are ambitious for spiritual gifts , use your ambition to try to work toward being the best at building up the church .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	14	13	Therefore , those who speak in a tongue should pray to be able to interpret .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	14	15	What should I do ? I ’ ll pray in the Spirit , but I ’ ll pray with my mind too ; I ’ ll sing a psalm in the Spirit , but I ’ ll sing the psalm with my mind too .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	14	16	After all , if you praise God in the Spirit , how will the people who aren ’ t trained in that language say “ Amen ! ” to your thanksgiving , when they don ’ t know what you are saying ?
CEB	1%20Corinthians	14	17	You may offer a beautiful prayer of thanksgiving , but the other person is not being built up .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	14	18	I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	14	19	But in the church I ’ d rather speak five words in my right mind than speak thousands of words in a tongue so that I can teach others .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	14	20	Brothers and sisters , don ’ t be like children in the way you think . Well , be babies when it comes to evil , but be adults in your thinking .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	14	21	In the Law it is written : I will speak to this people with foreign languages and foreigners ’ lips , but they will not even listen to me this way , [ a ] says the Lord .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	14	22	So then , tongues are a sign for those who don ’ t believe , not for those who believe . But prophecy is a sign for believers , not for those who don ’ t believe .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	14	23	So suppose that the whole church is meeting and everyone is speaking in tongues . If people come in who are outsiders or unbelievers , won ’ t they say that you are out of your minds ?
CEB	1%20Corinthians	14	24	But if everyone is prophesying when an unbeliever or outsider comes in , they are tested by all and called to account by all .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	14	25	The secrets of their hearts are brought to light . When that happens , they will fall on their faces and worship God , proclaiming out loud that truly God is among you !
CEB	1%20Corinthians	14	26	What is the outcome of this , brothers and sisters ? When you meet together , each one has a psalm , a teaching , a revelation , a tongue , or an interpretation . All these things must be done to build up the church .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	14	27	If some speak in a tongue , then let two or at most three speak , one at a time , and someone must interpret .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	14	28	However , if there is no interpreter , then they should keep quiet in the meeting . They should speak privately to themselves and to God .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	14	29	In the case of prophets , let two or three speak and have the rest evaluate what is said .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	14	30	And if some revelation comes to someone else who is sitting down , the first one should be quiet .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	14	31	You can all prophesy one at a time so that everyone can learn and be encouraged .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	14	32	The spirits of prophets are under the control of the prophets .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	14	33	God isn ’ t a God of disorder but of peace . Like in all the churches of God ’ s people ,
CEB	1%20Corinthians	14	34	the women should be quiet during the meeting . They are not allowed to talk . Instead , they need to get under control , just as the Law says .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	14	35	If they want to learn something , they should ask their husbands at home . It is disgraceful for a woman to talk during the meeting .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	14	36	Did the word of God originate with you ? Has it come only to you ?
CEB	1%20Corinthians	14	37	If anyone thinks that they are prophets or “ spiritual people , ” then let them recognize that what I ’ m writing to you is the Lord ’ s command .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	14	38	If someone doesn ’ t recognize this , they aren ’ t recognized .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	14	39	So then , brothers and sisters , use your ambition to try to get the gift of prophecy , but don ’ t prevent speaking in tongues .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	14	40	Everything should be done with dignity and in proper order .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	15	1	Corinthians 15:55 Hos 13:14
CEB	1%20Corinthians	15	15	We are found to be false witnesses about God , because we testified against God that he raised Christ , when he didn ’ t raise him if it ’ s the case that the dead aren ’ t raised .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	15	2	You are being saved through it if you hold on to the message I preached to you , unless somehow you believed it for nothing .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	15	3	I passed on to you as most important what I also received : Christ died for our sins in line with the scriptures ,
CEB	1%20Corinthians	15	4	he was buried , and he rose on the third day in line with the scriptures .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	15	5	He appeared to Cephas , then to the Twelve ,
CEB	1%20Corinthians	15	6	and then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers and sisters at once—most of them are still alive to this day , though some have died .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	15	7	Then he appeared to James , then to all the apostles ,
CEB	1%20Corinthians	15	8	and last of all he appeared to me , as if I were born at the wrong time .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	15	9	I ’ m the least important of the apostles . I don ’ t deserve to be called an apostle , because I harassed God ’ s church .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	15	10	I am what I am by God ’ s grace , and God ’ s grace hasn ’ t been for nothing . In fact , I have worked harder than all the others—that is , it wasn ’ t me but the grace of God that is with me .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	15	11	So then , whether you heard the message from me or them , this is what we preach and this is what you have believed .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	15	12	So if the message that is preached says that Christ has been raised from the dead , then how can some of you say , “ There ’ s no resurrection of the dead ” ?
CEB	1%20Corinthians	15	13	If there ’ s no resurrection of the dead , then Christ hasn ’ t been raised either .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	15	14	If Christ hasn ’ t been raised , then our preaching is useless and your faith is useless .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	15	16	If the dead aren ’ t raised , then Christ hasn ’ t been raised either .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	15	17	If Christ hasn ’ t been raised , then your faith is worthless ; you are still in your sins ,
CEB	1%20Corinthians	15	18	and what ’ s more , those who have died in Christ are gone forever .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	15	19	If we have a hope in Christ only in this life , then we deserve to be pitied more than anyone else .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	15	20	But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead . He ’ s the first crop of the harvest [ a ] of those who have died .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	15	21	Since death came through a human being , the resurrection of the dead came through one too .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	15	22	In the same way that everyone dies in Adam , so also everyone will be given life in Christ .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	15	23	Each event will happen in the right order : Christ , the first crop of the harvest , [ b ] then those who belong to Christ at his coming ,
CEB	1%20Corinthians	15	24	and then the end , when Christ hands over the kingdom to God the Father , when he brings every form of rule , every authority and power to an end .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	15	25	It is necessary for him to rule until he puts all enemies under his feet . [ c ]
CEB	1%20Corinthians	15	26	Death is the last enemy to be brought to an end ,
CEB	1%20Corinthians	15	27	since he has brought everything under control under his feet . When it says that everything has been brought under his control , this clearly means everything except for the one who placed everything under his control .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	15	28	But when all things have been brought under his control , then the Son himself will also be under the control of the one who gave him control over everything so that God may be all in all .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	15	29	Otherwise , what are those who are getting baptized for the dead doing ? If the dead aren ’ t raised , then why are they being baptized for them ?
CEB	1%20Corinthians	15	30	And what about us ? Why are we in danger all day every day ?
CEB	1%20Corinthians	15	31	Brothers and sisters , I swear by the pride I have in you in Christ Jesus our Lord , I ’ m facing death every day .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	15	32	From a human point of view , what good does it do me if I fought wild animals in Ephesus ? If the dead aren ’ t raised , let ’ s eat and drink because tomorrow we ’ ll die . [ d ]
CEB	1%20Corinthians	15	33	Don ’ t be deceived , bad company corrupts good character .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	15	34	Sober up by acting like you should and don ’ t sin . Some of you are ignorant about God—I say this because you should be ashamed of yourselves !
CEB	1%20Corinthians	15	35	But someone will say , “ How are the dead raised ? What kind of body will they have when they come back ? ”
CEB	1%20Corinthians	15	36	Look , fool ! When you put a seed into the ground , it doesn ’ t come back to life unless it dies .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	15	37	What you put in the ground doesn ’ t have the shape that it will have , but it ’ s a bare grain of wheat or some other seed .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	15	38	God gives it the sort of shape that he chooses , and he gives each of the seeds its own shape .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	15	39	All flesh isn ’ t alike . Humans have one kind of flesh , animals have another kind of flesh , birds have another kind of flesh , and fish have another kind .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	15	40	There are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies . The heavenly bodies have one kind of glory , and the earthly bodies have another kind of glory .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	15	41	The sun has one kind of glory , the moon has another kind of glory , and the stars have another kind of glory ( but one star is different from another star in its glory ) .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	15	42	It ’ s the same with the resurrection of the dead : a rotting body is put into the ground , but what is raised won ’ t ever decay .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	15	43	It ’ s degraded when it ’ s put into the ground , but it ’ s raised in glory . It ’ s weak when it ’ s put into the ground , but it ’ s raised in power .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	15	44	It ’ s a physical body when it ’ s put into the ground , but it ’ s raised as a spiritual body . If there ’ s a physical body , there ’ s also a spiritual body .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	15	45	So it is also written , The first human , Adam , became a living person , [ e ] and the last Adam became a spirit that gives life .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	15	46	But the physical body comes first , not the spiritual one—the spiritual body comes afterward .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	15	47	The first human was from the earth made from dust ; the second human is from heaven .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	15	48	The nature of the person made of dust is shared by people who are made of dust , and the nature of the heavenly person is shared by heavenly people .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	15	49	We will look like [ f ] the heavenly person in the same way as we have looked like the person made from dust .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	15	50	This is what I ’ m saying , brothers and sisters : Flesh and blood can ’ t inherit God ’ s kingdom . Something that rots can ’ t inherit something that doesn ’ t decay .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	15	51	Listen , I ’ m telling you a secret : All of us won ’ t die , but we will all be changed—
CEB	1%20Corinthians	15	52	in an instant , in the blink of an eye , at the final trumpet . The trumpet will blast , and the dead will be raised with bodies that won ’ t decay , and we will be changed .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	15	53	It ’ s necessary for this rotting body to be clothed with what can ’ t decay , and for the body that is dying to be clothed in what can ’ t die .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	15	54	And when the rotting body has been clothed in what can ’ t decay , and the dying body has been clothed in what can ’ t die , then this statement in scripture will happen : Death has been swallowed up by a victory . [ g ]
CEB	1%20Corinthians	15	55	Where is your victory , Death ? Where is your sting , Death ? [ h ] (
CEB	1%20Corinthians	15	56	Death ’ s sting is sin , and the power of sin is the Law . )
CEB	1%20Corinthians	15	57	Thanks be to God , who gives us this victory through our Lord Jesus Christ !
CEB	1%20Corinthians	15	58	As a result of all this , my loved brothers and sisters , you must stand firm , unshakable , excelling in the work of the Lord as always , because you know that your labor isn ’ t going to be for nothing in the Lord . Footnotes -
CEB	1%20Corinthians	16	1	Corinthians
CEB	1%20Corinthians	16	16	So accept the authority of people like them and of anyone who cooperates and works hard .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	16	2	On the first day of the week , each of you should set aside whatever you can afford from what you earn so that the collection won ’ t be delayed until I come .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	16	3	Then when I get there , I ’ ll send whomever you approve to Jerusalem with letters of recommendation to bring your gift .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	16	4	If it seems right for me to go too , they ’ ll travel with me . Plans to visit
CEB	1%20Corinthians	16	5	I ’ ll come to you after I go through Macedonia , and because I ’ m going through Macedonia ,
CEB	1%20Corinthians	16	6	I may stay with you or even spend the winter there in Corinth so that you can send me on my way to wherever I ’ m off to next .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	16	7	I don ’ t want to make a quick visit to you , since I hope to spend some time with you if the Lord lets it happen .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	16	8	I ’ ll stay here in Ephesus until the Festival of Pentecost .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	16	9	In spite of the fact that there are many opponents , a big and productive opportunity has opened up for my mission here .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	16	10	If Timothy comes to you , be sure that he has no reason to be afraid while he ’ s with you , because he does the work of the Lord just like I do .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	16	11	So don ’ t let anyone disrespect him , but send him on in peace so he can join me . I ’ m waiting for him along with the brothers and sisters .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	16	12	Concerning Apollos our brother : I strongly encouraged him to visit you with the brothers and sisters , but he didn ’ t want to go now . He ’ ll come when he has an opportunity . Final greeting
CEB	1%20Corinthians	16	13	Stay awake , stand firm in your faith , be brave , be strong .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	16	14	Everything should be done in love .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	16	15	Brothers and sisters , I encourage you to do something else . You know that the people in Stephanas ’ household were the first crop of the harvest to come from the mission to Achaia . They have dedicated themselves to the service of God ’ s people .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	16	17	I ’ m so happy that Stephanas , Fortunatus , and Achaicus have arrived ; they ’ ve made up for my missing you .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	16	18	Indeed they ’ ve provided my spirit and yours with a much-needed rest . Therefore , give them proper recognition .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	16	19	The churches in the province of Asia greet you . Aquila and Prisca greet you warmly in the Lord , together with the church that meets in their house .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	16	20	All the brothers and sisters greet you . You in turn should greet each other with a holy kiss .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	16	21	Here is my greeting in my own handwriting—Paul .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	16	22	A curse on anyone who doesn ’ t love the Lord . Come , Lord !
CEB	1%20Corinthians	16	23	The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you .
CEB	1%20Corinthians	16	24	My love is with all of you in Christ Jesus .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	1	2	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and from our Lord Jesus Christ . God ’ s comfort in trouble
CEB	2%20Corinthians	1	1	From Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus by God ’ s will , and Timothy our brother . To God ’ s church that is in Corinth , along with all of God ’ s people throughout Achaia .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	1	3	May the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ be blessed ! He is the compassionate Father and God of all comfort .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	1	4	He ’ s the one who comforts us in all our trouble so that we can comfort other people who are in every kind of trouble . We offer the same comfort that we ourselves received from God .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	1	5	That is because we receive so much comfort through Christ in the same way that we share so many of Christ ’ s sufferings .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	1	6	So if we have trouble , it is to bring you comfort and salvation . If we are comforted , it is to bring you comfort from the experience of endurance while you go through the same sufferings that we also suffer .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	1	7	Our hope for you is certain , because we know that as you are partners in suffering , so also you are partners in comfort .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	1	8	Brothers and sisters , we don ’ t want you to be unaware of the troubles that we went through in Asia . We were weighed down with a load of suffering that was so far beyond our strength that we were afraid we might not survive .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	1	9	It certainly seemed to us as if we had gotten the death penalty . This was so that we would have confidence in God , who raises the dead , instead of ourselves .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	1	10	God rescued us from a terrible death , and he will rescue us . We have set our hope on him that he will rescue us again ,
CEB	2%20Corinthians	1	11	since you are helping with your prayer for us . Then many people can thank God on our behalf for the gift that was given to us through the prayers of many people . Paul explains his change of plans
CEB	2%20Corinthians	1	12	We have conducted ourselves with godly sincerity and pure motives in the world , and especially toward you . This is why we are confident , and our conscience confirms this . We didn ’ t act with human wisdom but we relied on the grace of God .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	1	13	We don ’ t write anything to you except what you can read and also understand . I hope that you will understand totally
CEB	2%20Corinthians	1	14	since you have already understood us partly . Understand that in the day of our Lord Jesus , we will make you proud as you will also make us proud .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	1	15	Because I was sure of this , I wanted to visit you first so that you could have a second opportunity to see me .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	1	16	I wanted to visit you on my way to Macedonia , and then come to you again on my way back from Macedonia , at which point I was hoping you would help me on my way to Judea .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	1	17	So I wasn ’ t unreliable when I planned to do this , was I ? Or do I make decisions with a substandard human process so that I say “ Yes , yes ” and “ No , no ” at the same time ?
CEB	2%20Corinthians	1	18	But as God is faithful , our message to you isn ’ t both yes and no .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	1	19	God ’ s Son , Jesus Christ , is the one who was preached among you by us—through me , Silvanus , and Timothy—he wasn ’ t yes and no . In him it is always yes .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	1	20	All of God ’ s promises have their yes in him . That is why we say Amen through him to the glory of God .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	1	21	God is the one who establishes us with you in Christ and who anointed us .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	1	22	God also sealed us and gave the Spirit as a down payment in our hearts .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	1	23	I call on God as my witness—I didn ’ t come again to Corinth because I wanted to spare you .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	1	24	It isn ’ t that we are trying to control your faith , but we are working with you for your happiness , because you stand firm in your faith .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	2	2	If I make you sad , who will be there to make me glad when you are sad because of me ? Paul ’ s former letter
CEB	2%20Corinthians	2	1	So I decided that , for my own sake , I wouldn ’ t visit you again while I was upset .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	2	3	That ’ s why I wrote this very thing to you , so that when I came I wouldn ’ t be made sad by the ones who ought to make me happy . I have confidence in you , that my happiness means your happiness .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	2	4	I wrote to you in tears , with a very troubled and anxious heart . I didn ’ t write to make you sad but so you would know the overwhelming love that I have for you .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	2	5	But if someone has made anyone sad , that person hasn ’ t hurt me but all of you to some degree ( not to exaggerate ) .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	2	6	The punishment handed out by the majority is enough for this person .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	2	7	This is why you should try your best to forgive and to comfort this person now instead , so that this person isn ’ t overwhelmed by too much sorrow .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	2	8	So I encourage you to show your love for this person .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	2	9	This is another reason why I wrote you . I wanted to test you and see if you are obedient in everything .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	2	10	If you forgive anyone for anything , I do too . And whatever I ’ ve forgiven ( if I ’ ve forgiven anything ) , I did it for you in the presence of Christ .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	2	11	This is so that we won ’ t be taken advantage of by Satan , because we are well aware of his schemes . Paul ’ s ministry
CEB	2%20Corinthians	2	12	When I came to Troas to preach Christ ’ s gospel , the Lord gave me an opportunity to preach .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	2	13	But I was worried because I couldn ’ t find my brother Titus there . So I said good-bye to them and went on to Macedonia .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	2	14	But thank God , who is always leading us around through Christ as if we were in a parade . He releases the fragrance of the knowledge of him everywhere through us .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	2	15	We smell like the aroma of Christ ’ s offering to God , both to those who are being saved and to those who are on the road to destruction .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	2	16	We smell like a contagious dead person to those who are dying , but we smell like the fountain of life to those who are being saved . Who is qualified for this kind of ministry ?
CEB	2%20Corinthians	2	17	We aren ’ t like so many people who hustle the word of God to make a profit . We are speaking through Christ in the presence of God , as those who are sincere and as those who are sent from God .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	3	2	You are our letter , written on our hearts , known and read by everyone .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	3	3	You show that you are Christ ’ s letter , delivered by us . You weren ’ t written with ink but with the Spirit of the living God . You weren ’ t written on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	3	4	This is the confidence that we have through Christ in the presence of God .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	3	5	It isn ’ t that we ourselves are qualified to claim that anything came from us . No , our qualification is from God .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	3	6	He has qualified us as ministers of a new covenant , not based on what is written but on the Spirit , because what is written kills , but the Spirit gives life . Ministers of the new covenant
CEB	2%20Corinthians	3	7	The ministry that brought death was carved in letters on stone tablets . It came with such glory that the Israelites couldn ’ t look for long at Moses ’ face because his face was shining with glory , even though it was a fading glory .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	3	8	Won ’ t the ministry of the Spirit be much more glorious ?
CEB	2%20Corinthians	3	9	If the ministry that brought condemnation has glory , how much more glorious is the ministry that brings righteousness ?
CEB	2%20Corinthians	3	10	In fact , what was glorious isn ’ t glorious now , because of the glory that is brighter .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	3	11	If the glory that fades away was glorious , how much more glorious is the one that lasts !
CEB	2%20Corinthians	3	12	So , since we have such a hope , we act with great confidence .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	3	13	We aren ’ t like Moses , who used to put a veil over his face so that the Israelites couldn ’ t watch the end of what was fading away .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	3	14	But their minds were closed . Right up to the present day the same veil remains when the old covenant is read . The veil is not removed because it is taken away by Christ .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	3	15	Even today , whenever Moses is read , a veil lies over their hearts .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	3	16	But whenever someone turns back to the Lord , the veil is removed .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	3	17	The Lord is the Spirit , and where the Lord ’ s Spirit is , there is freedom .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	3	18	All of us are looking with unveiled faces at the glory of the Lord as if we were looking in a mirror . We are being transformed into that same image from one degree of glory to the next degree of glory . This comes from the Lord , who is the Spirit .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	4	2	Corinthians 4:13 Ps 116:10 ( 115:1 LXX )
CEB	2%20Corinthians	4	4	The god of this age has blinded the minds of those who don ’ t have faith so they couldn ’ t see the light of the gospel that reveals Christ ’ s glory . Christ is the image of God .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	4	3	And even if our gospel is veiled , it is veiled to those who are on the road to destruction .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	4	5	We don ’ t preach about ourselves . Instead , we preach about Jesus Christ as Lord , and we describe ourselves as your slaves for Jesus ’ sake .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	4	6	God said that light should shine out of the darkness . He is the same one who shone in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of God ’ s glory in the face of Jesus Christ . Physical bodies and eternal glory
CEB	2%20Corinthians	4	7	But we have this treasure in clay pots so that the awesome power belongs to God and doesn ’ t come from us .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	4	8	We are experiencing all kinds of trouble , but we aren ’ t crushed . We are confused , but we aren ’ t depressed .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	4	9	We are harassed , but we aren ’ t abandoned . We are knocked down , but we aren ’ t knocked out .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	4	10	We always carry Jesus ’ death around in our bodies so that Jesus ’ life can also be seen in our bodies .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	4	11	We who are alive are always being handed over to death for Jesus ’ sake so that Jesus ’ life can also be seen in our bodies that are dying .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	4	12	So death is at work in us , but life is at work in you .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	4	13	We have the same faithful spirit as what is written in scripture : I had faith , and so I spoke . [ a ] We also have faith , and so we also speak .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	4	14	We do this because we know that the one who raised the Lord Jesus will also raise us with Jesus , and he will bring us into his presence along with you .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	4	15	All these things are for your benefit . As grace increases to benefit more and more people , it will cause gratitude to increase , which results in God ’ s glory .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	4	16	So we aren ’ t depressed . But even if our bodies are breaking down on the outside , the person that we are on the inside is being renewed every day .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	4	17	Our temporary minor problems are producing an eternal stockpile of glory for us that is beyond all comparison .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	4	18	We don ’ t focus on the things that can be seen but on the things that can ’ t be seen . The things that can be seen don ’ t last , but the things that can ’ t be seen are eternal . Footnotes -
CEB	2%20Corinthians	5	2	We groan while we live in this residence . We really want to dress ourselves with our building from heaven—
CEB	2%20Corinthians	5	5	Now the one who prepared us for this very thing is God , and God gave us the Spirit as a down payment for our home .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	5	3	since we assume that when we take off this tent , we won ’ t find out that we are naked .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	5	4	Yes , while we are in this tent we groan , because we are weighed down . We want to be dressed not undressed , so that what is dying can be swallowed up by life .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	5	6	So we are always confident , because we know that while we are living in the body , we are away from our home with the Lord .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	5	7	We live by faith and not by sight .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	5	8	We are confident , and we would prefer to leave the body and to be at home with the Lord .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	5	9	So our goal is to be acceptable to him , whether we are at home or away from home .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	5	10	We all must appear before Christ in court so that each person can be paid back for the things that were done while in the body , whether they were good or bad . Ministry of reconciliation
CEB	2%20Corinthians	5	11	So we try to persuade people , since we know what it means to fear the Lord . We are well known by God , and I hope that in your heart we are well known by you as well .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	5	12	We aren ’ t trying to commend ourselves to you again . Instead , we are giving you an opportunity to be proud of us so that you could answer those who take pride in superficial appearance , and not in what is in the heart .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	5	13	If we are crazy , it ’ s for God ’ s sake . If we are rational , it ’ s for your sake .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	5	14	The love of Christ controls us , because we have concluded this : one died for the sake of all ; therefore , all died .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	5	15	He died for the sake of all so that those who are alive should live not for themselves but for the one who died for them and was raised .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	5	16	So then , from this point on we won ’ t recognize people by human standards . Even though we used to know Christ by human standards , that isn ’ t how we know him now .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	5	17	So then , if anyone is in Christ , that person is part of the new creation . The old things have gone away , and look , new things have arrived !
CEB	2%20Corinthians	5	18	All of these new things are from God , who reconciled us to himself through Christ and who gave us the ministry of reconciliation .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	5	19	In other words , God was reconciling the world to himself through Christ , by not counting people ’ s sins against them . He has trusted us with this message of reconciliation .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	5	20	So we are ambassadors who represent Christ . God is negotiating with you through us . We beg you as Christ ’ s representatives , “ Be reconciled to God ! ”
CEB	2%20Corinthians	5	21	God caused the one who didn ’ t know sin to be sin for our sake so that through him we could become the righteousness of God .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	6	2	He says , I listened to you at the right time , and I helped you on the day of salvation . [ a ] Look , now is the right time ! Look , now is the day of salvation !
CEB	2%20Corinthians	6	6	We displayed purity , knowledge , patience , and generosity . We served with the Holy Spirit , genuine love ,
CEB	2%20Corinthians	6	1	Since we work together with him , we are also begging you not to receive the grace of God in vain .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	6	3	We don ’ t give anyone any reason to be offended about anything so that our ministry won ’ t be criticized .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	6	4	Instead , we commend ourselves as ministers of God in every way . We did this with our great endurance through problems , disasters , and stressful situations .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	6	5	We went through beatings , imprisonments , and riots . We experienced hard work , sleepless nights , and hunger .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	6	7	telling the truth , and God ’ s power . We carried the weapons of righteousness in our right hand and our left hand .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	6	8	We were treated with honor and dishonor and with verbal abuse and good evaluation . We were seen as both fake and real ,
CEB	2%20Corinthians	6	9	as unknown and well known , as dying—and look , we are alive ! We were seen as punished but not killed ,
CEB	2%20Corinthians	6	10	as going through pain but always happy , as poor but making many rich , and as having nothing but owning everything . Call to relationship and holiness
CEB	2%20Corinthians	6	11	Corinthians , we have spoken openly to you , and our hearts are wide open .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	6	12	There are no limits to the affection that we feel for you . You are the ones who placed boundaries on your affection for us .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	6	13	But as a fair trade—I ’ m talking to you like you are children—open your hearts wide too .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	6	14	Don ’ t be tied up as equal partners with people who don ’ t believe . What does righteousness share with that which is outside the Law ? What relationship does light have with darkness ?
CEB	2%20Corinthians	6	15	What harmony does Christ have with Satan ? [ b ] What does a believer have in common with someone who doesn ’ t believe ?
CEB	2%20Corinthians	6	16	What agreement can there be between God ’ s temple and idols ? Because we are the temple of the living God . Just as God said , I live with them , and I will move among them . I will be their God , and they will be my people . [ c ]
CEB	2%20Corinthians	6	17	Therefore , come out from among them and be separated , says the Lord . Don ’ t touch what is unclean . Then I will welcome you . [ d ]
CEB	2%20Corinthians	6	18	I will be a father to you , and you will be my sons and daughters , says the Lord Almighty . [ e ]
CEB	2%20Corinthians	7	2	Make room in your hearts for us . We didn ’ t do anything wrong to anyone . We didn ’ t ruin anyone . We didn ’ t take advantage of anyone .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	7	7	We weren ’ t comforted only by his arrival but also by the comfort he had received from you . He told us about your desire to see me , how you were sorry , and about your concern for me , so that I was even happier .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	7	1	My dear friends , since we have these promises , let ’ s cleanse ourselves from anything that contaminates our body or spirit so that we make our holiness complete in the fear of God .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	7	3	I ’ m not saying this to make you feel guilty . I ’ ve already said that you are in our hearts so that we die and live together with you .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	7	4	I have every confidence in you . I ’ m terribly proud of you . I ’ m filled with encouragement . I ’ m overwhelmed with happiness while in the middle of our problems . Titus ’ good report
CEB	2%20Corinthians	7	5	Even after we arrived in Macedonia , we couldn ’ t rest physically . We were surrounded by problems . There was external conflict , and there were internal fears .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	7	6	However , God comforts people who are discouraged , and he comforted us by Titus ’ arrival .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	7	8	Even though my letter hurt you , I don ’ t regret it . Well—I did regret it just a bit because I see that that letter made you sad , though only for a short time .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	7	9	Now I ’ m glad—not because you were sad but because you were made sad enough to change your hearts and lives . You felt godly sadness so that no one was harmed by us in any way .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	7	10	Godly sadness produces a changed heart and life that leads to salvation and leaves no regrets , but sorrow under the influence of the world produces death .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	7	11	Look at what this very experience of godly sadness has produced in you : such enthusiasm , what a desire to clear yourselves of blame , such indignation , what fear , what purpose , such concern , what justice ! In everything you have shown yourselves to be innocent in the matter .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	7	12	So although I wrote to you , it wasn ’ t for the sake of the one who did wrong , or for the sake of the one who was wronged , but to show you your own enthusiasm for us in the sight of God .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	7	13	Because of this we have been encouraged . And in addition to our own encouragement , we were even more pleased at how happy Titus was . His mind has been put at rest by all of you .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	7	14	If I ’ ve bragged about you to him in any way , I haven ’ t been embarrassed . Instead , our bragging to Titus has also been proven to be true , just like everything we said to you was true .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	7	15	His devotion to you is growing even more as he remembers how all of you were obedient when you welcomed him with fear and trembling .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	7	16	I ’ m happy , because I can completely depend on you .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	8	2	While they were being tested by many problems , their extra amount of happiness and their extreme poverty resulted in a surplus of rich generosity .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	8	8	I ’ m not giving an order , but by mentioning the commitment of others , I ’ m trying to prove the authenticity of your love also .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	8	3	I assure you that they gave what they could afford and even more than they could afford , and they did it voluntarily .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	8	4	They urgently begged us for the privilege [ a ] of sharing in this service for the saints .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	8	5	They even exceeded our expectations , because they gave themselves to the Lord first and to us , consistent with God ’ s will .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	8	6	As a result , we challenged Titus to finish this work of grace with you the way he had started it .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	8	7	Be the best in this work of grace in the same way that you are the best in everything , such as faith , speech , knowledge , total commitment , and the love we inspired in you .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	8	9	You know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ . Although he was rich , he became poor for your sakes , so that you could become rich through his poverty .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	8	10	I ’ m giving you my opinion about this . It ’ s to your advantage to do this , since you not only started to do it last year but you wanted to do it too .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	8	11	Now finish the job as well so that you finish it with as much enthusiasm as you started , given what you can afford .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	8	12	A gift is appreciated because of what a person can afford , not because of what that person can ’ t afford , if it ’ s apparent that it ’ s done willingly .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	8	13	It isn ’ t that we want others to have financial ease and you financial difficulties , but it ’ s a matter of equality .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	8	14	At the present moment , your surplus can fill their deficit so that in the future their surplus can fill your deficit . In this way there is equality .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	8	15	As it is written , The one who gathered more didn ’ t have too much , and the one who gathered less didn ’ t have too little . [ b ] Plans for the Collection
CEB	2%20Corinthians	8	16	But thank God , who put the same commitment that I have for you in Titus ’ heart .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	8	17	Not only has he accepted our challenge but he ’ s on his way to see you voluntarily , and he ’ s excited .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	8	18	We are sending the brother who is famous in all the churches because of his work for the gospel along with him .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	8	19	In addition to this , he is chosen by the churches to be our traveling companion in this work of grace , which we are taking care of for the sake of the glory of the Lord himself , and to show our desire to help .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	8	20	We are trying to avoid being blamed by anyone for the way we take care of this large amount of money .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	8	21	We care about doing the right thing , not only in the Lord ’ s eyes but also in the eyes of other people .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	8	22	We are sending our brother with them . We have tested his commitment in many ways and many times . Now he ’ s even more committed , because he has so much confidence in you .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	8	23	If there is any question about Titus , he is my partner and coworker among you . If there is any question about our brothers , they are the churches ’ apostles and an honor to Christ .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	8	24	So show them the proof of your love and the reason we are so proud of you , in such a way that the churches can see it .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	9	2	I know about your willingness to help . I brag about you to the Macedonians , saying , “ Greece has been ready since last year , ” and your enthusiasm has motivated most of them .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	9	9	As it is written , He scattered everywhere ; he gave to the needy ; his righteousness remains forever . [ a ]
CEB	2%20Corinthians	9	3	But I ’ m sending the brothers so that our bragging about you in this case won ’ t be empty words , and so that you can be prepared , just as I keep telling them you will be .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	9	4	If some Macedonians should come with me and find out that you aren ’ t ready , we ( not to mention you ) would be embarrassed as far as this project goes .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	9	5	This is why I thought it was necessary to encourage the brothers to go to you ahead of time and arrange in advance the generous gift you have already promised . I want it to be a real gift from you . I don ’ t want you to feel like you are being forced to give anything .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	9	6	What I mean is this : the one who sows a small number of seeds will also reap a small crop , and the one who sows a generous amount of seeds will also reap a generous crop .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	9	7	Everyone should give whatever they have decided in their heart . They shouldn ’ t give with hesitation or because of pressure . God loves a cheerful giver .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	9	8	God has the power to provide you with more than enough of every kind of grace . That way , you will have everything you need always and in everything to provide more than enough for every kind of good work .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	9	10	The one who supplies seed for planting and bread for eating will supply and multiply your seed and will increase your crop , which is righteousness .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	9	11	You will be made rich in every way so that you can be generous in every way . Such generosity produces thanksgiving to God through us .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	9	12	Your ministry of this service to God ’ s people isn ’ t only fully meeting their needs but it is also multiplying in many expressions of thanksgiving to God .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	9	13	They will give honor to God for your obedience to your confession of Christ ’ s gospel . They will do this because this service provides evidence of your obedience , and because of your generosity in sharing with them and with everyone .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	9	14	They will also pray for you , and they will care deeply for you because of the outstanding grace that God has given to you .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	9	15	Thank God for his gift that words can ’ t describe !
CEB	2%20Corinthians	10	2	I beg you that when I ’ m with you in person , I won ’ t have to boss you around . I ’ m afraid that I may have to use that kind of behavior with those people who think we live by human standards .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	10	10	I know what some people are saying : “ His letters are severe and powerful , but in person he is weak and his speech is worth nothing. ”
CEB	2%20Corinthians	10	3	Although we live in the world , we don ’ t fight our battles with human methods .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	10	4	Our weapons that we fight with aren ’ t human , but instead they are powered by God for the destruction of fortresses . They destroy arguments ,
CEB	2%20Corinthians	10	5	and every defense that is raised up to oppose the knowledge of God . They capture every thought to make it obedient to Christ .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	10	6	Once your obedience is complete , we are ready to punish any disobedience .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	10	7	Look at what is right in front of you ! If anyone is sure about belonging to Christ , that person should think again . We belong to Christ just like that person .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	10	8	Even if I went on to brag about our authority , I wouldn ’ t be ashamed of it . The Lord gave us that authority to build you up and not to destroy you .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	10	9	I don ’ t want it to seem like I ’ m trying to intimidate you with my letters .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	10	11	These people need to think about this—that when we are with you , our actions will show that we are the same as the words we wrote when we were away from you .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	10	12	We won ’ t dare to place ourselves in the same league or to compare ourselves with some of those who are promoting themselves . When they measure themselves by themselves , and compare themselves with themselves , they have no understanding .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	10	13	We won ’ t take pride in anything more than what is appropriate . Let ’ s look at the boundaries of our work area that God has assigned to us . It ’ s an area that includes you .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	10	14	We aren ’ t going out of bounds , as if our work area doesn ’ t extend as far as you . We were the first ones to travel as far as Corinth with the gospel of Christ .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	10	15	We don ’ t take pride in what other people do outside of our boundaries . We hope that our work will be extended even more by you as your faith grows , until it expands fully ( within the boundaries , of course ) .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	10	16	We hope that our work grows even to the point of the gospel being preached in places beyond Corinth , without bragging about what has already been done in another person ’ s work area .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	10	17	But , the one who brags should brag in the Lord . [ a ]
CEB	2%20Corinthians	10	18	It isn ’ t the person who promotes himself or herself who is approved but the person whom the Lord commends .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	11	2	I ’ m deeply concerned about you with the same concern that God has . As your father , I promised you in marriage to one husband . I promised to present you as an innocent virgin to Christ himself .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	11	11	Why ? Is it because I don ’ t love you ? God knows that I do !
CEB	2%20Corinthians	11	3	But I ’ m afraid that your minds might be seduced in the same way as the snake deceived Eve with his devious tricks . You might be unable to focus completely on a genuine and innocent commitment to Christ .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	11	4	If a person comes and preaches some other Jesus than the one we preached , or if you receive a different Spirit than the one you had received , or a different gospel than the one you embraced , you put up with it so easily !
CEB	2%20Corinthians	11	5	I don ’ t consider myself as second-rate in any way compared to the “ super-apostles. ”
CEB	2%20Corinthians	11	6	But even if I ’ m uneducated in public speaking , I ’ m not uneducated in knowledge . We have shown this to you in every way and in everything we have done .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	11	7	Did I commit a sin by humbling myself to give you an advantage because I preached the gospel of God to you free of charge ?
CEB	2%20Corinthians	11	8	I robbed other churches by taking a salary from them in order to serve you !
CEB	2%20Corinthians	11	9	While I was with you , I didn ’ t burden any of you even though I needed things . The believers who came from Macedonia gave me everything I needed . I kept myself from being a financial drain on you in any way , and I will continue to keep myself from being a burden .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	11	10	Since Christ ’ s truth is in me , I won ’ t stop telling the entire area of Greece that I ’ m proud of what I did .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	11	12	But I ’ m going to continue to do what I ’ m doing . I want to contradict the claims of the people who want to be treated like they are the same as us because of what they brag about .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	11	13	Such people are false apostles and dishonest workers who disguise themselves as apostles of Christ .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	11	14	And no wonder ! Even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	11	15	It is no great surprise then that his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness . Their end will be what their actions deserve . Paul defends himself
CEB	2%20Corinthians	11	16	I repeat , no one should take me for a fool . But if you do , then allow me to be a fool so that I can brag like a fool for a bit .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	11	17	I ’ m not saying what I ’ m saying because the Lord tells me to . I ’ m saying it like I ’ m a fool . I ’ m putting my confidence in this business of bragging .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	11	18	Since so many people are bragging based on human standards , that is how I ’ m going to brag too .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	11	19	Because you , who are so wise , are happy to put up with fools .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	11	20	You put up with it if someone enslaves you , if someone exploits you , if someone takes advantage of you , if someone places themselves over you , or if someone hits you in the face .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	11	21	I ’ m ashamed to say that we have been weak in comparison ! But in whatever they challenge me , I challenge them ( I ’ m speaking foolishly ) .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	11	22	Are they Hebrews ? So am I . Are they Israelites ? So am I . Are they descendants of Abraham ? So am I .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	11	23	Are they ministers of Christ ? I ’ m speaking like a crazy person . What I ’ ve done goes well beyond what they ’ ve done . I ’ ve worked much harder . I ’ ve been imprisoned much more often . I ’ ve been beaten more times than I can count . I ’ ve faced death many times .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	11	24	I received the “ forty lashes minus one ” from the Jews five times .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	11	25	I was beaten with rods three times . I was stoned once . I was shipwrecked three times . I spent a day and a night on the open sea .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	11	26	I ’ ve been on many journeys . I faced dangers from rivers , robbers , my people , and Gentiles . I faced dangers in the city , in the desert , on the sea , and from false brothers and sisters .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	11	27	I faced these dangers with hard work and heavy labor , many sleepless nights , hunger and thirst , often without food , and in the cold without enough clothes .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	11	28	Besides all the other things I could mention , there ’ s my daily stress because I ’ m concerned about all the churches .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	11	29	Who is weak without me being weak ? Who is led astray without me being furious about it ?
CEB	2%20Corinthians	11	30	If it ’ s necessary to brag , I ’ ll brag about my weaknesses .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	11	31	The God and Father of the Lord Jesus , the one who is blessed forever , knows that I ’ m not lying .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	11	32	At Damascus the governor under King Aretas was guarding the city of Damascus in order to capture me ,
CEB	2%20Corinthians	11	33	but I got away from him by being lowered in a basket through a window in the city wall .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	12	2	I know a man in Christ who was caught up into the third heaven fourteen years ago . I don ’ t know whether it was in the body or out of the body . God knows . 3-4 I know that this man was caught up into paradise and that he heard unspeakable words that were things no one is allowed to repeat . I don ’ t know whether it was in the body or apart from the body . God knows .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	12	12	The signs of an apostle were performed among you with continuous endurance through signs , wonders , and miracles .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	12	5	I ’ ll brag about this man , but I won ’ t brag about myself , except to brag about my weaknesses .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	12	6	If I did want to brag , I wouldn ’ t make a fool of myself because I ’ d tell the truth . I ’ m holding back from bragging so that no one will give me any more credit than what anyone sees or hears about me .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	12	7	I was given a thorn in my body because of the outstanding revelations I ’ ve received so that I wouldn ’ t be conceited . It ’ s a messenger from Satan sent to torment me so that I wouldn ’ t be conceited .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	12	8	I pleaded with the Lord three times for it to leave me alone .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	12	9	He said to me , “ My grace is enough for you , because power is made perfect in weakness. ” So I ’ ll gladly spend my time bragging about my weaknesses so that Christ ’ s power can rest on me .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	12	10	Therefore , I ’ m all right with weaknesses , insults , disasters , harassments , and stressful situations for the sake of Christ , because when I ’ m weak , then I ’ m strong .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	12	11	I ’ ve become a fool ! You made me do it . Actually , I should have been commended by you . I ’ m not inferior to the super-apostles in any way , even though I ’ m a nonentity .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	12	13	How were you treated worse than the other churches , except that I myself wasn ’ t a financial burden on you ? Forgive me for this wrong ! Paul ’ s plans to visit and a warning
CEB	2%20Corinthians	12	14	Look , I ’ m ready to visit you a third time , and I won ’ t be a burden on you . I don ’ t want your things ; I want you . It isn ’ t the children ’ s responsibility to save up for their parents but parents for children .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	12	15	I will very gladly spend and be spent for your sake . If I love you more , will you love me less ?
CEB	2%20Corinthians	12	16	We all know that I didn ’ t place a burden on you , but in spite of that you think I ’ m a con artist who fooled you with a trick .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	12	17	I haven ’ t taken advantage of you through any of the people I sent to you , have I ?
CEB	2%20Corinthians	12	18	I strongly encouraged Titus to go to you and sent the brother with him . Titus didn ’ t take advantage of you , did he ? Didn ’ t we live by the same Spirit ? Didn ’ t we walk in the same footsteps ?
CEB	2%20Corinthians	12	19	Have you been thinking up to now that we are defending ourselves to you ? Actually , we are speaking in the sight of God and in Christ . Dear friends , everything is meant to build you up .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	12	20	I ’ m afraid that maybe when I come you will be different from the way I want you to be , and that I ’ ll be different from the way you want me to be . I ’ m afraid that there might be fighting , obsession , losing your temper , competitive opposition , backstabbing , gossip , conceit , and disorderly conduct .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	12	21	I ’ m afraid that when I come again , my God may embarrass me in front of you . I might have to go into mourning over all the people who have sinned before and haven ’ t changed their hearts and lives from what they used to practice : moral corruption , sexual immorality , and doing whatever feels good .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	13	2	Cor 13:12-13 is in some versions equivalent to 13:12-14 .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	13	13	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ , the love of God , and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all . Footnotes -
CEB	2%20Corinthians	13	3	Since you are demanding proof that Christ speaks through me , Christ isn ’ t weak in dealing with you but shows his power among you .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	13	4	Certainly he was crucified because of weakness , but he lives by the power of God . Certainly we also are weak in him , but we will live together with him , because of God ’ s power that is directed toward you .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	13	5	Examine yourselves to see if you are in the faith . Test yourselves . Don ’ t you understand that Jesus Christ is in you ? Unless , of course , you fail the test .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	13	6	But I hope that you will realize that we don ’ t fail the test .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	13	7	We pray to God that you don ’ t do anything wrong , not because we want to appear to pass the test but so that you might do the right thing , even if we appear to fail .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	13	8	We can ’ t do anything against the truth but only to help the truth .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	13	9	We are happy when we are weak but you are strong . We pray for this : that you will be made complete .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	13	10	This is why I ’ m writing these things while I ’ m away . I ’ m writing so that I won ’ t need to act harshly when I ’ m with you by using the authority that the Lord gave me . He gave it to me so that I could build you up , not tear you down . Final greeting
CEB	2%20Corinthians	13	11	Finally , brothers and sisters , good-bye . Put things in order , respond to my encouragement , be in harmony with each other , and live in peace—and the God of love and peace will be with you .
CEB	2%20Corinthians	13	12	Say hello to each other with a holy kiss . [ a ] All of God ’ s people say hello to you .
CEB	Galatians	1	1	From Paul , an apostle who is not sent from human authority or commissioned through human agency , but sent through Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised him from the dead ;
CEB	Galatians	1	2	and from all the brothers and sisters with me . To the churches in Galatia .
CEB	Galatians	1	3	Grace and peace to you from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
CEB	Galatians	1	4	He gave himself for our sins , so he could deliver us from this present evil age , according to the will of our God and Father .
CEB	Galatians	1	5	To God be the glory forever and always ! Amen . The gospel challenged in Galatia
CEB	Galatians	1	6	I ’ m amazed that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you by the grace of Christ to follow another gospel .
CEB	Galatians	1	7	It ’ s not really another gospel , but certain people are confusing you and they want to change the gospel of Christ .
CEB	Galatians	1	8	However , even if we ourselves or a heavenly angel should ever preach anything different from what we preached to you , they should be under a curse .
CEB	Galatians	1	9	I ’ m repeating what we ’ ve said before : if anyone preaches something different from what you received , they should be under a curse ! Paul ’ s leadership
CEB	Galatians	1	10	Am I trying to win over human beings or God ? Or am I trying to please people ? If I were still trying to please people , I wouldn ’ t be Christ ’ s slave .
CEB	Galatians	1	11	Brothers and sisters , I want you to know that the gospel I preached isn ’ t human in origin .
CEB	Galatians	1	12	I didn ’ t receive it or learn it from a human . It came through a revelation from Jesus Christ .
CEB	Galatians	1	13	You heard about my previous life in Judaism , how severely I harassed God ’ s church and tried to destroy it .
CEB	Galatians	1	14	I advanced in Judaism beyond many of my peers , because I was much more militant about the traditions of my ancestors .
CEB	Galatians	1	15	But God had set me apart from birth and called me through his grace . He was pleased
CEB	Galatians	1	16	to reveal his Son to me , so that I might preach about him to the Gentiles . I didn ’ t immediately consult with any human being .
CEB	Galatians	1	17	I didn ’ t go up to Jerusalem to see the men who were apostles before me either , but I went away into Arabia and I returned again to Damascus .
CEB	Galatians	1	18	Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas and stayed with him fifteen days .
CEB	Galatians	1	19	But I didn ’ t see any other of the apostles except James the brother of the Lord .
CEB	Galatians	1	20	Before God , I ’ m not lying about the things that I ’ m writing to you !
CEB	Galatians	1	21	Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia ,
CEB	Galatians	1	22	but I wasn ’ t known personally by the Christian churches in Judea .
CEB	Galatians	1	23	They only heard a report about me : “ The man who used to harass us now preaches the faith that he once tried to destroy. ”
CEB	Galatians	1	24	So they were glorifying God because of me .
CEB	Galatians	2	2	I went there because of a revelation , and I laid out the gospel that I preach to the Gentiles for them . But I did it privately with the influential leaders to make sure that I wouldn ’ t be working or that I hadn ’ t worked for nothing .
CEB	Galatians	2	3	However , not even Titus , who was with me and who was a Greek , was required to be circumcised .
CEB	Galatians	2	4	But false brothers and sisters , who were brought in secretly , slipped in to spy on our freedom , which we have in Christ Jesus , and to make us slaves .
CEB	Galatians	2	5	We didn ’ t give in and submit to them for a single moment , so that the truth of the gospel would continue to be with you .
CEB	Galatians	2	6	The influential leaders didn ’ t add anything to what I was preaching—and whatever they were makes no difference to me , because God doesn ’ t show favoritism .
CEB	Galatians	2	7	But on the contrary , they saw that I had been given the responsibility to preach the gospel to the people who aren ’ t circumcised , just as Peter had been to the circumcised .
CEB	Galatians	2	8	The one who empowered Peter to become an apostle to the circumcised empowered me also to be one to the Gentiles .
CEB	Galatians	2	9	James , Cephas , and John , who are considered to be key leaders , shook hands with me and Barnabas as equals when they recognized the grace that was given to me . So it was agreed that we would go to the Gentiles , while they continue to go to the people who were circumcised .
CEB	Galatians	2	10	They asked only that we would remember the poor , which was certainly something I was willing to do . The Jewish-Gentile controversy
CEB	Galatians	2	11	But when Cephas came to Antioch , I opposed him to his face , because he was wrong .
CEB	Galatians	2	12	He had been eating with the Gentiles before certain people came from James . But when they came , he began to back out and separate himself , because he was afraid of the people who promoted circumcision .
CEB	Galatians	2	13	And the rest of the Jews also joined him in this hypocrisy so that even Barnabas got carried away with them in their hypocrisy .
CEB	Galatians	2	14	But when I saw that they weren ’ t acting consistently with the truth of the gospel , I said to Cephas in front of everyone , “ If you , though you ’ re a Jew , live like a Gentile and not like a Jew , how can you require the Gentiles to live like Jews ? ”
CEB	Galatians	2	15	We are born Jews—we ’ re not Gentile sinners .
CEB	Galatians	2	16	However , we know that a person isn ’ t made righteous by the works of the Law but rather through the faithfulness of Jesus Christ . We ourselves believed in Christ Jesus so that we could be made righteous by the faithfulness of Christ and not by the works of the Law—because no one will be made righteous by the works of the Law .
CEB	Galatians	2	17	But if it is discovered that we ourselves are sinners while we are trying to be made righteous in Christ , then is Christ a servant of sin ? Absolutely not !
CEB	Galatians	2	18	If I rebuild the very things that I tore down , I show that I myself am breaking the Law .
CEB	Galatians	2	19	I died to the Law through the Law , so that I could live for God .
CEB	Galatians	2	20	I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live , but Christ lives in me . And the life that I now live in my body , I live by faith , indeed , by the faithfulness of God ’ s Son , who loved me and gave himself for me .
CEB	Galatians	2	21	I don ’ t ignore the grace of God , because if we become righteous through the Law , then Christ died for no purpose .
CEB	Galatians	3	3	Are you so irrational ? After you started with the Spirit , are you now finishing up with your own human effort ?
CEB	Galatians	3	2	I just want to know this from you : Did you receive the Spirit by doing the works of the Law or by believing what you heard ?
CEB	Galatians	3	4	Did you experience so much for nothing ? I wonder if it really was for nothing .
CEB	Galatians	3	5	So does the one providing you with the Spirit and working miracles among you do this by you doing the works of the Law or by you believing what you heard ? Abraham : an example of righteousness
CEB	Galatians	3	6	Understand that in the same way that Abraham believed God and it was credited to him as righteousness , [ a ]
CEB	Galatians	3	7	those who believe are the children of Abraham .
CEB	Galatians	3	8	But when it saw ahead of time that God would make the Gentiles righteous on the basis of faith , scripture preached the gospel in advance to Abraham : All the Gentiles will be blessed in you . [ b ]
CEB	Galatians	3	9	Therefore , those who believe are blessed together with Abraham who believed .
CEB	Galatians	3	10	All those who rely on the works of the Law are under a curse , because it is written , Everyone is cursed who does not keep on doing all the things that have been written in the Law scroll . [ c ]
CEB	Galatians	3	11	But since no one is made righteous by the Law as far as God is concerned , it is clear that the righteous one will live on the basis of faith . [ d ]
CEB	Galatians	3	12	The Law isn ’ t based on faith ; rather , the one doing these things will live by them . [ e ]
CEB	Galatians	3	13	Christ redeemed us from the curse of the Law by becoming a curse for us—because it is written , Everyone who is hung on a tree is cursed . [ f ]
CEB	Galatians	3	14	He redeemed us so that the blessing of Abraham would come to the Gentiles through Christ Jesus , and that we would receive the promise of the Spirit through faith .
CEB	Galatians	3	15	Brothers and sisters , I ’ ll use an example from human experience . No one ignores or makes additions to a validated will .
CEB	Galatians	3	16	The promises were made to Abraham and to his descendant . It doesn ’ t say , “ and to the descendants , ” as if referring to many rather than just one . It says , “ and to your descendant , ” who is Christ .
CEB	Galatians	3	17	I ’ m saying this : the Law , which came four hundred thirty years later , doesn ’ t invalidate the agreement that was previously validated by God so that it cancels the promise .
CEB	Galatians	3	18	If the inheritance were based upon the Law , it would no longer be from the promise . But God has given it graciously to Abraham through a promise . The Law ’ s origin and purpose
CEB	Galatians	3	19	So why was the Law given ? It was added because of offenses , until the descendant would come to whom the promise had been made . It was put in place through angels by the hand of a mediator .
CEB	Galatians	3	20	Now the mediator does not take one side ; but God is one .
CEB	Galatians	3	21	So , is the Law against the promises of God ? Absolutely not ! If a Law had been given that was able to give life , then righteousness would in fact have come from the Law .
CEB	Galatians	3	22	But scripture locked up all things under sin , so that the promise based on the faithfulness of Jesus Christ might be given to those who have faith .
CEB	Galatians	3	23	Before faith came , we were guarded under the Law , locked up until faith that was coming would be revealed ,
CEB	Galatians	3	24	so that the Law became our custodian until Christ so that we might be made righteous by faith . God ’ s children are heirs in Christ
CEB	Galatians	3	25	But now that faith has come , we are no longer under a custodian .
CEB	Galatians	3	26	You are all God ’ s children through faith in Christ Jesus .
CEB	Galatians	3	27	All of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ .
CEB	Galatians	3	28	There is neither Jew nor Greek ; there is neither slave nor free ; nor is there male and female , for you are all one in Christ Jesus .
CEB	Galatians	3	29	Now if you belong to Christ , then indeed you are Abraham ’ s descendants , heirs according to the promise .
CEB	Galatians	4	4	But when the fulfillment of the time came , God sent his Son , born through a woman , and born under the Law .
CEB	Galatians	4	2	However , they are placed under trustees and guardians until the date set by the parents .
CEB	Galatians	4	3	In the same way , when we were minors , we were also enslaved by this world ’ s system .
CEB	Galatians	4	5	This was so he could redeem those under the Law so that we could be adopted .
CEB	Galatians	4	6	Because you are sons and daughters , God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts , crying , “ Abba , Father ! ”
CEB	Galatians	4	7	Therefore , you are no longer a slave but a son or daughter , and if you are his child , then you are also an heir through God . Paul ’ s concern for the Galatians
CEB	Galatians	4	8	At the time , when you didn ’ t know God , you were enslaved by things that aren ’ t gods by nature .
CEB	Galatians	4	9	But now , after knowing God ( or rather , being known by God ) , how can you turn back again to the weak and worthless world system ? Do you want to be slaves to it again ?
CEB	Galatians	4	10	You observe religious days and months and seasons and years .
CEB	Galatians	4	11	I ’ m afraid for you ! Perhaps my hard work for you has been for nothing .
CEB	Galatians	4	12	I beg you to be like me , brothers and sisters , because I have become like you ! You haven ’ t wronged me .
CEB	Galatians	4	13	You know that I first preached the gospel to you because of an illness .
CEB	Galatians	4	14	Though my poor health burdened you , you didn ’ t look down on me or reject me , but you welcomed me as if I were an angel from God , or as if I were Christ Jesus !
CEB	Galatians	4	15	Where then is the great attitude that you had ? I swear that , if possible , you would have dug out your eyes and given them to me .
CEB	Galatians	4	16	So then , have I become your enemy by telling you the truth ?
CEB	Galatians	4	17	They are so concerned about you , though not with good intentions . Rather , they want to shut you out so that you would run after them .
CEB	Galatians	4	18	However , it ’ s always good to have people concerned about you with good intentions , and not just when I ’ m there with you .
CEB	Galatians	4	19	My little children , I ’ m going through labor pains again until Christ is formed in you .
CEB	Galatians	4	20	But I wish I could be with you now and change how I sound , because I ’ m at a loss about you . Slave versus free
CEB	Galatians	4	21	Tell me—those of you who want to be under the Law—don ’ t you listen to the Law ?
CEB	Galatians	4	22	It ’ s written that Abraham had two sons , one by the slave woman and one by the free woman .
CEB	Galatians	4	23	The son by the slave woman was conceived the normal way , but the son by the free woman was conceived through a promise .
CEB	Galatians	4	24	These things are an allegory : the women are two covenants . One is from Mount Sinai , which gives birth to slave children ; this is Hagar .
CEB	Galatians	4	25	Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia , and she corresponds to the present-day Jerusalem , because the city is in slavery with her children .
CEB	Galatians	4	26	But the Jerusalem that is above is free , and she is our mother .
CEB	Galatians	4	27	It ’ s written : Rejoice , barren woman , you who have not given birth . Break out with a shout , you who have not suffered labor pains ; because the woman who has been deserted will have many more children than the woman who has a husband . [ a ]
CEB	Galatians	4	28	Brothers and sisters , you are children of the promise like Isaac .
CEB	Galatians	4	29	But just as it was then , so it is now also : the one who was conceived the normal way harassed the one who was conceived by the Spirit .
CEB	Galatians	4	30	But what does the scripture say ? Throw out the slave woman and her son , because the slave woman ’ s son won ’ t share the inheritance with the free woman ’ s son . [ b ]
CEB	Galatians	4	31	Therefore , brothers and sisters , we aren ’ t the slave woman ’ s children , but we are the free woman ’ s children .
CEB	Galatians	5	5	We eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness through the Spirit by faith .
CEB	Galatians	5	1	Christ has set us free for freedom . Therefore , stand firm and don ’ t submit to the bondage of slavery again . Arguments against being circumcised
CEB	Galatians	5	2	Look , I , Paul , am telling you that if you have yourselves circumcised , having Christ won ’ t help you .
CEB	Galatians	5	3	Again I swear to every man who has himself circumcised that he is required to do the whole Law .
CEB	Galatians	5	4	You people who are trying to be made righteous by the Law have been estranged from Christ . You have fallen away from grace !
CEB	Galatians	5	6	Being circumcised or not being circumcised doesn ’ t matter in Christ Jesus , but faith working through love does matter .
CEB	Galatians	5	7	You were running well—who stopped you from obeying the truth ?
CEB	Galatians	5	8	This line of reasoning doesn ’ t come from the one who calls you .
CEB	Galatians	5	9	A little yeast works through the whole lump of dough .
CEB	Galatians	5	10	I ’ m convinced about you in the Lord that you won ’ t think any other way . But the one who is confusing you will pay the penalty , whoever that may be .
CEB	Galatians	5	11	Brothers and sisters , if I ’ m still preaching circumcision , why am I still being harassed ? In that case , the offense of the cross would be canceled .
CEB	Galatians	5	12	I wish that the ones who are upsetting you would castrate themselves !
CEB	Galatians	5	13	You were called to freedom , brothers and sisters ; only don ’ t let this freedom be an opportunity to indulge your selfish impulses , but serve each other through love .
CEB	Galatians	5	14	All the Law has been fulfilled in a single statement : Love your neighbor as yourself . [ a ]
CEB	Galatians	5	15	But if you bite and devour each other , be careful that you don ’ t get eaten up by each other ! Two different ways of living
CEB	Galatians	5	16	I say be guided by the Spirit and you won ’ t carry out your selfish desires .
CEB	Galatians	5	17	A person ’ s selfish desires are set against the Spirit , and the Spirit is set against one ’ s selfish desires . They are opposed to each other , so you shouldn ’ t do whatever you want to do .
CEB	Galatians	5	18	But if you are being led by the Spirit , you aren ’ t under the Law .
CEB	Galatians	5	19	The actions that are produced by selfish motives are obvious , since they include sexual immorality , moral corruption , doing whatever feels good ,
CEB	Galatians	5	20	idolatry , drug use and casting spells , hate , fighting , obsession , losing your temper , competitive opposition , conflict , selfishness , group rivalry ,
CEB	Galatians	5	21	jealousy , drunkenness , partying , and other things like that . I warn you as I have already warned you , that those who do these kinds of things won ’ t inherit God ’ s kingdom .
CEB	Galatians	5	22	But the fruit of the Spirit is love , joy , peace , patience , kindness , goodness , faithfulness ,
CEB	Galatians	5	23	gentleness , and self-control . There is no law against things like this .
CEB	Galatians	5	24	Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the self with its passions and its desires .
CEB	Galatians	5	25	If we live by the Spirit , let ’ s follow the Spirit .
CEB	Galatians	5	26	Let ’ s not become arrogant , make each other angry , or be jealous of each other .
CEB	Galatians	6	6	Those who are taught the word should share all good things with their teacher .
CEB	Galatians	6	2	Carry each other ’ s burdens and so you will fulfill the law of Christ .
CEB	Galatians	6	3	If anyone thinks they are important when they aren ’ t , they ’ re fooling themselves .
CEB	Galatians	6	4	Each person should test their own work and be happy with doing a good job and not compare themselves with others .
CEB	Galatians	6	5	Each person will have to carry their own load .
CEB	Galatians	6	7	Make no mistake , God is not mocked . A person will harvest what they plant .
CEB	Galatians	6	8	Those who plant only for their own benefit will harvest devastation from their selfishness , but those who plant for the benefit of the Spirit will harvest eternal life from the Spirit .
CEB	Galatians	6	9	Let ’ s not get tired of doing good , because in time we ’ ll have a harvest if we don ’ t give up .
CEB	Galatians	6	10	So then , let ’ s work for the good of all whenever we have an opportunity , and especially for those in the household of faith . Final greeting
CEB	Galatians	6	11	Look at the large letters I ’ m making with my own handwriting !
CEB	Galatians	6	12	contain nine close occurrences of the same word in Gk , but it is rendered as selfish in regard to impulses , desires , motives , or benefit , and human standards in 6:12 .
CEB	Galatians	6	13	Those who are circumcised don ’ t observe the Law themselves , but they want you to be circumcised , so they can boast about your physical body . [ a ]
CEB	Galatians	6	14	But as for me , God forbid that I should boast about anything except for the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ . The world has been crucified to me through him , and I have been crucified to the world .
CEB	Galatians	6	15	Being circumcised or not being circumcised doesn ’ t mean anything . What matters is a new creation .
CEB	Galatians	6	16	May peace and mercy be on whoever follows this rule and on God ’ s Israel .
CEB	Galatians	6	17	From now on , no one should bother me because I bear the marks of Jesus on my body .
CEB	Galatians	6	18	Brothers and sisters , may the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit . Amen . Footnotes - Galatians 6:13 In Gk the word traditionally rendered as flesh is rendered here as physical body , but it has a wide range of meaning . Gal 5:13-25 ; 6:8 ,
CEB	Ephesians	1	1	From Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus by God ’ s will . To the holy and faithful people in Christ Jesus in Ephesus . [ a ]
CEB	Ephesians	1	2	Grace and peace to you from God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ . The believers ’ blessings
CEB	Ephesians	1	3	Bless the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ ! He has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing that comes from heaven .
CEB	Ephesians	1	4	God chose us in Christ to be holy and blameless in God ’ s presence before the creation of the world .
CEB	Ephesians	1	5	God destined us to be his adopted children through Jesus Christ because of his love . This was according to his goodwill and plan
CEB	Ephesians	1	6	and to honor his glorious grace that he has given to us freely through the Son whom he loves .
CEB	Ephesians	1	7	We have been ransomed through his Son ’ s blood , and we have forgiveness for our failures based on his overflowing grace ,
CEB	Ephesians	1	8	which he poured over us with wisdom and understanding .
CEB	Ephesians	1	9	God revealed his hidden design [ b ] to us , which is according to his goodwill and the plan that he intended to accomplish through his Son .
CEB	Ephesians	1	10	This is what God planned for the climax of all times : [ c ] to bring all things together in Christ , the things in heaven along with the things on earth .
CEB	Ephesians	1	11	We have also received an inheritance in Christ . We were destined by the plan of God , who accomplishes everything according to his design .
CEB	Ephesians	1	12	We are called to be an honor to God ’ s glory because we were the first to hope in Christ .
CEB	Ephesians	1	13	You too heard the word of truth in Christ , which is the good news of your salvation . You were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit because you believed in Christ .
CEB	Ephesians	1	14	The Holy Spirit is the down payment on our inheritance , which is applied toward our redemption as God ’ s own people , resulting in the honor of God ’ s glory . Paul ’ s prayer for the Ephesians
CEB	Ephesians	1	15	Since I heard about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all God ’ s people , this is the reason that
CEB	Ephesians	1	16	I don ’ t stop giving thanks to God for you when I remember you in my prayers .
CEB	Ephesians	1	17	I pray that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of glory , will give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation that makes God known to you .
CEB	Ephesians	1	18	I pray that the eyes of your heart will have enough light to see what is the hope of God ’ s call , what is the richness of God ’ s glorious inheritance among believers ,
CEB	Ephesians	1	19	and what is the overwhelming greatness of God ’ s power that is working among us believers . This power is conferred by the energy of God ’ s powerful strength .
CEB	Ephesians	1	20	God ’ s power was at work in Christ when God raised him from the dead and sat him at God ’ s right side in the heavens ,
CEB	Ephesians	1	21	far above every ruler and authority and power and angelic power , any power that might be named not only now but in the future .
CEB	Ephesians	1	22	God put everything under Christ ’ s feet and made him head of everything in the church ,
CEB	Ephesians	1	23	which is his body . His body , the church , is the fullness of Christ , who fills everything in every way . Footnotes - Ephesians 1:1 The location of Ephesus was added in some later manuscripts , probably to make the opening of this letter similar to the others in the collection of Paul ’ s letters . - Ephesians 1:9 Or mystery - Ephesians 1:10 Or the fullness of times
CEB	Ephesians	2	2	You used to live like people of this world . You followed the rule of a destructive spiritual power . This is the spirit of disobedience to God ’ s will that is now at work in persons whose lives are characterized by disobedience .
CEB	Ephesians	2	3	At one time you were like those persons . All of you used to do whatever felt good and whatever you thought you wanted so that you were children headed for punishment just like everyone else . 4-5 However , God is rich in mercy . He brought us to life with Christ while we were dead as a result of those things that we did wrong . He did this because of the great love that he has for us . You are saved by God ’ s grace !
CEB	Ephesians	2	6	And God raised us up and seated us in the heavens with Christ Jesus .
CEB	Ephesians	2	7	God did this to show future generations the greatness of his grace by the goodness that God has shown us in Christ Jesus .
CEB	Ephesians	2	8	You are saved by God ’ s grace because of your faith . [ a ] This salvation is God ’ s gift . It ’ s not something you possessed .
CEB	Ephesians	2	9	It ’ s not something you did that you can be proud of .
CEB	Ephesians	2	10	Instead , we are God ’ s accomplishment , created in Christ Jesus to do good things . God planned for these good things to be the way that we live our lives . The reconciliation of God ’ s people
CEB	Ephesians	2	11	So remember that once you were Gentiles by physical descent , who were called “ uncircumcised ” by Jews who are physically circumcised .
CEB	Ephesians	2	12	At that time you were without Christ . You were aliens rather than citizens of Israel , and strangers to the covenants of God ’ s promise . In this world you had no hope and no God .
CEB	Ephesians	2	13	But now , thanks to Christ Jesus , you who once were so far away have been brought near by the blood of Christ .
CEB	Ephesians	2	14	Christ is our peace . He made both Jews and Gentiles into one group . With his body , he broke down the barrier of hatred that divided us .
CEB	Ephesians	2	15	He canceled the detailed rules of the Law so that he could create one new person out of the two groups , making peace .
CEB	Ephesians	2	16	He reconciled them both as one body to God by the cross , which ended the hostility to God .
CEB	Ephesians	2	17	When he came , he announced the good news of peace to you who were far away from God and to those who were near .
CEB	Ephesians	2	18	We both have access to the Father through Christ by the one Spirit .
CEB	Ephesians	2	19	So now you are no longer strangers and aliens . Rather , you are fellow citizens with God ’ s people , and you belong to God ’ s household .
CEB	Ephesians	2	20	As God ’ s household , you are built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets with Christ Jesus himself as the cornerstone .
CEB	Ephesians	2	21	The whole building is joined together in him , and it grows up into a temple that is dedicated to the Lord .
CEB	Ephesians	2	22	Christ is building you into a place where God lives through the Spirit . Footnotes - Ephesians 2:8 Or through his faithfulness
CEB	Ephesians	3	3	God showed me his secret plan [ a ] in a revelation , as I mentioned briefly before (
CEB	Ephesians	3	2	You ’ ve heard , of course , about the responsibility to distribute God ’ s grace , which God gave to me for you , right ?
CEB	Ephesians	3	4	when you read this , you ’ ll understand my insight into the secret plan [ b ] about Christ ) .
CEB	Ephesians	3	5	Earlier generations didn ’ t know this hidden plan that God has now revealed to his holy apostles and prophets through the Spirit .
CEB	Ephesians	3	6	This plan is that the Gentiles would be coheirs and parts of the same body , and that they would share with the Jews in the promises of God in Christ Jesus through the gospel .
CEB	Ephesians	3	7	I became a servant of the gospel because of the grace that God showed me through the exercise of his power .
CEB	Ephesians	3	8	God gave his grace to me , the least of all God ’ s people , to preach the good news about the immeasurable riches of Christ to the Gentiles .
CEB	Ephesians	3	9	God sent me to reveal the secret plan [ c ] that had been hidden since the beginning of time by God , who created everything .
CEB	Ephesians	3	10	God ’ s purpose is now to show the rulers and powers in the heavens the many different varieties of his wisdom through the church .
CEB	Ephesians	3	11	This was consistent with the plan he had from the beginning of time that he accomplished through Christ Jesus our Lord .
CEB	Ephesians	3	12	In Christ we have bold and confident access to God through faith in him . [ d ]
CEB	Ephesians	3	13	So then , I ask you not to become discouraged by what I ’ m suffering for you , which is your glory . Paul ’ s prayer for the Ephesians
CEB	Ephesians	3	14	This is why I kneel before the Father .
CEB	Ephesians	3	15	Every ethnic group in heaven or on earth is recognized by him .
CEB	Ephesians	3	16	I ask that he will strengthen you in your inner selves from the riches of his glory through the Spirit .
CEB	Ephesians	3	17	I ask that Christ will live in your hearts through faith . As a result of having strong roots in love ,
CEB	Ephesians	3	18	I ask that you ’ ll have the power to grasp love ’ s width and length , height and depth , together with all believers .
CEB	Ephesians	3	19	I ask that you ’ ll know the love of Christ that is beyond knowledge so that you will be filled entirely with the fullness of God .
CEB	Ephesians	3	20	Glory to God , who is able to do far beyond all that we could ask or imagine by his power at work within us ;
CEB	Ephesians	3	21	glory to him in the church and in Christ Jesus for all generations , forever and always . Amen . Footnotes - Ephesians 3:3 Or mystery - Ephesians 3:4 Or mystery - Ephesians 3:9 Or mystery - Ephesians 3:12 Or through his faithfulness
CEB	Ephesians	4	4	You are one body and one spirit , just as God also called you in one hope .
CEB	Ephesians	4	2	Conduct yourselves with all humility , gentleness , and patience . Accept each other with love ,
CEB	Ephesians	4	3	and make an effort to preserve the unity of the Spirit with the peace that ties you together .
CEB	Ephesians	4	5	There is one Lord , one faith , one baptism ,
CEB	Ephesians	4	6	and one God and Father of all , who is over all , through all , and in all .
CEB	Ephesians	4	7	God has given his grace to each one of us measured out by the gift that is given by Christ .
CEB	Ephesians	4	8	That ’ s why scripture says , When he climbed up to the heights , he captured prisoners , and he gave gifts to people . [ a ]
CEB	Ephesians	4	9	What does the phrase “ he climbed up ” mean if it doesn ’ t mean that he had first gone down into the lower regions , the earth ?
CEB	Ephesians	4	10	The one who went down is the same one who climbed up above all the heavens so that he might fill everything .
CEB	Ephesians	4	11	He gave some apostles , some prophets , some evangelists , and some pastors and teachers .
CEB	Ephesians	4	12	His purpose was to equip God ’ s people for the work of serving and building up the body of Christ
CEB	Ephesians	4	13	until we all reach the unity of faith and knowledge of God ’ s Son . God ’ s goal is for us to become mature adults—to be fully grown , measured by the standard of the fullness of Christ .
CEB	Ephesians	4	14	As a result , we aren ’ t supposed to be infants any longer who can be tossed and blown around by every wind that comes from teaching with deceitful scheming and the tricks people play to deliberately mislead others .
CEB	Ephesians	4	15	Instead , by speaking the truth with love , let ’ s grow in every way into Christ ,
CEB	Ephesians	4	16	who is the head . The whole body grows from him , as it is joined and held together by all the supporting ligaments . The body makes itself grow in that it builds itself up with love as each one does its part . The old and new life
CEB	Ephesians	4	17	So I ’ m telling you this , and I insist on it in the Lord : you shouldn ’ t live your life like the Gentiles anymore . They base their lives on pointless thinking ,
CEB	Ephesians	4	18	and they are in the dark in their reasoning . They are disconnected from God ’ s life because of their ignorance and their closed hearts .
CEB	Ephesians	4	19	They are people who lack all sense of right and wrong , and who have turned themselves over to doing whatever feels good and to practicing every sort of corruption along with greed .
CEB	Ephesians	4	20	But you didn ’ t learn that sort of thing from Christ .
CEB	Ephesians	4	21	Since you really listened to him and you were taught how the truth is in Jesus ,
CEB	Ephesians	4	22	change the former way of life that was part of the person you once were , corrupted by deceitful desires .
CEB	Ephesians	4	23	Instead , renew the thinking in your mind by the Spirit
CEB	Ephesians	4	24	and clothe yourself with the new person created according to God ’ s image in justice and true holiness .
CEB	Ephesians	4	25	Therefore , after you have gotten rid of lying , Each of you must tell the truth to your neighbor [ b ] because we are parts of each other in the same body .
CEB	Ephesians	4	26	Be angry without sinning . [ c ] Don ’ t let the sun set on your anger .
CEB	Ephesians	4	27	Don ’ t provide an opportunity for the devil .
CEB	Ephesians	4	28	Thieves should no longer steal . Instead , they should go to work , using their hands to do good so that they will have something to share with whoever is in need .
CEB	Ephesians	4	29	Don ’ t let any foul words come out of your mouth . Only say what is helpful when it is needed for building up the community so that it benefits those who hear what you say .
CEB	Ephesians	4	30	Don ’ t make the Holy Spirit of God unhappy—you were sealed by him for the day of redemption .
CEB	Ephesians	4	31	Put aside all bitterness , losing your temper , anger , shouting , and slander , along with every other evil .
CEB	Ephesians	4	32	Be kind , compassionate , and forgiving to each other , in the same way God forgave you in Christ .
CEB	Ephesians	5	5	Because you know for sure that persons who are sexually immoral , impure , or greedy—which happens when things become gods—those persons won ’ t inherit the kingdom of Christ and God . Be children of light
CEB	Ephesians	5	2	Live your life with love , following the example of Christ , who loved us and gave himself for us . He was a sacrificial offering that smelled sweet to God .
CEB	Ephesians	5	3	Sexual immorality , and any kind of impurity or greed , shouldn ’ t even be mentioned among you , which is right for holy persons .
CEB	Ephesians	5	4	Obscene language , silly talk , or vulgar jokes aren ’ t acceptable for believers . Instead , there should be thanksgiving .
CEB	Ephesians	5	6	Nobody should deceive you with stupid ideas . God ’ s anger comes down on those who are disobedient because of this kind of thing .
CEB	Ephesians	5	7	So you shouldn ’ t have anything to do with them .
CEB	Ephesians	5	8	You were once darkness , but now you are light in the Lord , so live your life as children of light .
CEB	Ephesians	5	9	Light produces fruit that consists of every sort of goodness , justice , and truth .
CEB	Ephesians	5	10	Therefore , test everything to see what ’ s pleasing to the Lord ,
CEB	Ephesians	5	11	and don ’ t participate in the unfruitful actions of darkness . Instead , you should reveal the truth about them .
CEB	Ephesians	5	12	It ’ s embarrassing to even talk about what certain persons do in secret .
CEB	Ephesians	5	13	But everything exposed to the light is revealed by the light .
CEB	Ephesians	5	14	Everything that is revealed by the light is light . Therefore , it says , Wake up , sleeper ! [ a ] Get up from the dead , [ b ] and Christ will shine on you . [ c ] Be filled with the Spirit
CEB	Ephesians	5	15	So be careful to live your life wisely , not foolishly .
CEB	Ephesians	5	16	Take advantage of every opportunity because these are evil times .
CEB	Ephesians	5	17	Because of this , don ’ t be ignorant , but understand the Lord ’ s will .
CEB	Ephesians	5	18	Don ’ t get drunk on wine , which produces depravity . Instead , be filled with the Spirit in the following ways :
CEB	Ephesians	5	19	speak to each other with psalms , hymns , and spiritual songs ; sing and make music to the Lord in your hearts ;
CEB	Ephesians	5	20	always give thanks to God the Father for everything in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ ;
CEB	Ephesians	5	21	and submit to each other out of respect for Christ .
CEB	Ephesians	5	22	For example , wives should submit to their husbands as if to the Lord .
CEB	Ephesians	5	23	A husband is the head of his wife like Christ is head of the church , that is , the savior of the body .
CEB	Ephesians	5	24	So wives submit to their husbands in everything like the church submits to Christ .
CEB	Ephesians	5	25	As for husbands , love your wives just like Christ loved the church and gave himself for her .
CEB	Ephesians	5	26	He did this to make her holy by washing her in a bath of water with the word .
CEB	Ephesians	5	27	He did this to present himself with a splendid church , one without any sort of stain or wrinkle on her clothes , but rather one that is holy and blameless .
CEB	Ephesians	5	28	That ’ s how husbands ought to love their wives—in the same way as they do their own bodies . Anyone who loves his wife loves himself .
CEB	Ephesians	5	29	No one ever hates his own body , but feeds it and takes care of it just like Christ does for the church
CEB	Ephesians	5	30	because we are parts of his body .
CEB	Ephesians	5	31	This is why a man will leave his father and mother and be united with his wife , and the two of them will be one body . [ d ]
CEB	Ephesians	5	32	Marriage is a significant allegory , [ e ] and I ’ m applying it to Christ and the church .
CEB	Ephesians	5	33	In any case , as for you individually , each one of you should love his wife as himself , and wives should respect [ f ] their husbands . Footnotes - Ephesians 5:14 Isa 26:19 ; 51:17 ; 52:1 ; 60:1 - Ephesians 5:14 Isa 26:19 - Ephesians 5:14 Isa 60:1 - Ephesians 5:31 Gen 2:24 - Ephesians 5:32 Or mystery - Ephesians 5:33 Or fear
CEB	Ephesians	6	6	Don ’ t work to make yourself look good and try to flatter people , but act like slaves of Christ carrying out God ’ s will from the heart .
CEB	Ephesians	6	2	The commandment Honor your father and mother is the first one with a promise attached :
CEB	Ephesians	6	3	so that things will go well for you , and you will live for a long time in the land . [ a ]
CEB	Ephesians	6	4	As for parents , don ’ t provoke your children to anger , but raise them with discipline and instruction about the Lord .
CEB	Ephesians	6	5	As for slaves , obey your human masters with fear and trembling and with sincere devotion to Christ .
CEB	Ephesians	6	7	Serve your owners enthusiastically , as though you were serving the Lord and not human beings .
CEB	Ephesians	6	8	You know that the Lord will reward every person who does what is right , whether that person is a slave or a free person .
CEB	Ephesians	6	9	As for masters , treat your slaves in the same way . Stop threatening them , because you know that both you and your slaves have a master in heaven . He doesn ’ t distinguish between people on the basis of status . Put on the armor of God
CEB	Ephesians	6	10	Finally , be strengthened by the Lord and his powerful strength .
CEB	Ephesians	6	11	Put on God ’ s armor so that you can make a stand against the tricks of the devil .
CEB	Ephesians	6	12	We aren ’ t fighting against human enemies but against rulers , authorities , forces of cosmic darkness , and spiritual powers of evil in the heavens .
CEB	Ephesians	6	13	Therefore , pick up the full armor of God so that you can stand your ground on the evil day and after you have done everything possible to still stand .
CEB	Ephesians	6	14	So stand with the belt of truth around your waist , justice as your breastplate ,
CEB	Ephesians	6	15	and put shoes on your feet so that you are ready to spread the good news of peace .
CEB	Ephesians	6	16	Above all , carry the shield of faith so that you can extinguish the flaming arrows of the evil one .
CEB	Ephesians	6	17	Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit , which is God ’ s word .
CEB	Ephesians	6	18	Offer prayers and petitions in the Spirit all the time . Stay alert by hanging in there and praying for all believers .
CEB	Ephesians	6	19	As for me , pray that when I open my mouth , I ’ ll get a message that confidently makes this secret plan [ b ] of the gospel known .
CEB	Ephesians	6	20	I ’ m an ambassador in chains for the sake of the gospel . Pray so that the Lord will give me the confidence to say what I have to say . Final greeting
CEB	Ephesians	6	21	Tychicus , my loved brother and faithful servant of the Lord , can inform you about my situation and what I ’ m doing .
CEB	Ephesians	6	22	I ’ ve sent him for this reason—so that you will know about us . He can reassure you .
CEB	Ephesians	6	23	May there be peace with the brothers and sisters as well as love with the faith that comes from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
CEB	Ephesians	6	24	May grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ forever . Footnotes - Ephesians 6:3 Exod 20:12 ; Deut 5:16 - Ephesians 6:19 Or mystery
CEB	Philippians	1	1	From Paul and Timothy , slaves of Christ Jesus . To all those in Philippi who are God ’ s people in Christ Jesus , along with your supervisors [ a ] and servants . [ b ]
CEB	Philippians	1	2	May the grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ be with you . Thanksgiving and prayer
CEB	Philippians	1	3	I thank my God every time I mention you in my prayers .
CEB	Philippians	1	4	I ’ m thankful for all of you every time I pray , and it ’ s always a prayer full of joy .
CEB	Philippians	1	5	I ’ m glad because of the way you have been my partners in the ministry of the gospel from the time you first believed it until now .
CEB	Philippians	1	6	I ’ m sure about this : the one who started a good work in you will stay with you to complete the job by the day of Christ Jesus .
CEB	Philippians	1	7	I have good reason to think this way about all of you because I keep you in my heart . You are all my partners in God ’ s grace , both during my time in prison and in the defense and support of the gospel .
CEB	Philippians	1	8	God is my witness that I feel affection for all of you with the compassion of Christ Jesus .
CEB	Philippians	1	9	This is my prayer : that your love might become even more and more rich with knowledge and all kinds of insight .
CEB	Philippians	1	10	I pray this so that you will be able to decide what really matters and so you will be sincere and blameless on the day of Christ .
CEB	Philippians	1	11	I pray that you will then be filled with the fruit of righteousness , which comes from Jesus Christ , in order to give glory and praise to God . Priority of the gospel
CEB	Philippians	1	12	Brothers and sisters , I want you to know that the things that have happened to me have actually advanced the gospel .
CEB	Philippians	1	13	The whole Praetorian Guard and everyone else knows that I ’ m in prison for Christ .
CEB	Philippians	1	14	Most of the brothers and sisters have had more confidence through the Lord to speak the word boldly and bravely because of my jail time .
CEB	Philippians	1	15	Some certainly preach Christ with jealous and competitive motives , but others preach with good motives .
CEB	Philippians	1	16	They are motivated by love , because they know that I ’ m put here to give a defense of the gospel ;
CEB	Philippians	1	17	the others preach Christ because of their selfish ambition . They are insincere , hoping to cause me more pain while I ’ m in prison .
CEB	Philippians	1	18	What do I think about this ? Just this : since Christ is proclaimed in every possible way , whether from dishonest or true motives , I ’ m glad and I ’ ll continue to be glad .
CEB	Philippians	1	19	I ’ m glad because I know that this will result in my release through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ .
CEB	Philippians	1	20	It is my expectation and hope that I won ’ t be put to shame in anything . Rather , I hope with daring courage that Christ ’ s greatness will be seen in my body , now as always , whether I live or die .
CEB	Philippians	1	21	Because for me , living serves Christ and dying is even better .
CEB	Philippians	1	22	If I continue to live in this world , I get results from my work .
CEB	Philippians	1	23	But I don ’ t know what I prefer . I ’ m torn between the two because I want to leave this life and be with Christ , which is far better .
CEB	Philippians	1	24	However , it ’ s more important for me to stay in this world for your sake .
CEB	Philippians	1	25	I ’ m sure of this : I will stay alive and remain with all of you to help your progress and the joy of your faith ,
CEB	Philippians	1	26	and to increase your pride in Christ Jesus through my presence when I visit you again . Live worthy of the gospel
CEB	Philippians	1	27	Most important , live together in a manner worthy of Christ ’ s gospel . Do this , whether I come and see you or I ’ m absent and hear about you . Do this so that you stand firm , united in one spirit and mind as you struggle together to remain faithful to the gospel .
CEB	Philippians	1	28	That way , you won ’ t be afraid of anything your enemies do . Your faithfulness and courage are a sign of their coming destruction and your salvation , which is from God .
CEB	Philippians	1	29	God has generously granted you the privilege , not only of believing in Christ but also of suffering for Christ ’ s sake .
CEB	Philippians	1	30	You are having the same struggle that you saw me face and now hear that I ’ m still facing . Footnotes - Philippians 1:1 Or overseers , bishops - Philippians 1:1 Or deacons
CEB	Philippians	2	2	complete my joy by thinking the same way , having the same love , being united , and agreeing with each other .
CEB	Philippians	2	3	Don ’ t do anything for selfish purposes , but with humility think of others as better than yourselves .
CEB	Philippians	2	4	Instead of each person watching out for their own good , watch out for what is better for others .
CEB	Philippians	2	5	Adopt the attitude that was in Christ Jesus :
CEB	Philippians	2	6	Though he was in the form of God , he did not consider being equal with God something to exploit .
CEB	Philippians	2	7	But he emptied himself by taking the form of a slave and by becoming like human beings . When he found himself in the form of a human ,
CEB	Philippians	2	8	he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death , even death on a cross .
CEB	Philippians	2	9	Therefore , God highly honored him and gave him a name above all names ,
CEB	Philippians	2	10	so that at the name of Jesus everyone in heaven , on earth , and under the earth might bow
CEB	Philippians	2	11	and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord , to the glory of God the Father . Carry out your salvation
CEB	Philippians	2	12	Therefore , my loved ones , just as you always obey me , not just when I am present but now even more while I am away , carry out your own salvation with fear and trembling .
CEB	Philippians	2	13	God is the one who enables you both to want and to actually live out his good purposes .
CEB	Philippians	2	14	Do everything without grumbling and arguing
CEB	Philippians	2	15	so that you may be blameless and pure , innocent children of God surrounded by people who are crooked and corrupt . Among these people you shine like stars in the world
CEB	Philippians	2	16	because you hold on to the word of life . This will allow me to say on the day of Christ that I haven ’ t run for nothing or worked for nothing .
CEB	Philippians	2	17	But even if I am poured out like a drink offering upon the altar of service for your faith , I am glad . I ’ m glad with all of you .
CEB	Philippians	2	18	You should be glad about this in the same way . Be glad with me ! Sending Timothy and Epaphroditus
CEB	Philippians	2	19	I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to see you soon so that I may be encouraged by hearing about you .
CEB	Philippians	2	20	I have no one like him . He is a person who genuinely cares about your well-being .
CEB	Philippians	2	21	All the others put their own business ahead of Jesus Christ ’ s business .
CEB	Philippians	2	22	You know his character , how he labors with me for the gospel like a son works with his father .
CEB	Philippians	2	23	So he is the one that I hope to send as soon as I find out how things turn out here for me .
CEB	Philippians	2	24	I trust in the Lord that I also will visit you soon .
CEB	Philippians	2	25	I think it is also necessary to send Epaphroditus to you . He is my brother , coworker , and fellow soldier ; and he is your representative who serves my needs .
CEB	Philippians	2	26	He misses you all , and he was upset because you heard he was sick .
CEB	Philippians	2	27	In fact , he was so sick that he nearly died . But God had mercy on him—and not just on him but also on me , because his death would have caused me great sorrow .
CEB	Philippians	2	28	Therefore , I am sending him immediately so that when you see him again you can be glad and I won ’ t worry .
CEB	Philippians	2	29	So welcome him in the Lord with great joy and show great respect for people like him .
CEB	Philippians	2	30	He risked his life and almost died for the work of Christ , and he did this to make up for the help you couldn ’ t give me .
CEB	Philippians	3	3	We are the circumcision . We are the ones who serve by God ’ s Spirit and who boast in Christ Jesus . We don ’ t put our confidence in rituals performed on the body ,
CEB	Philippians	3	2	Watch out for the “ dogs. ” Watch out for people who do evil things . Watch out for those who insist on circumcision , which is really mutilation .
CEB	Philippians	3	4	though I have good reason to have this kind of confidence . If anyone else has reason to put their confidence in physical advantages , I have even more :
CEB	Philippians	3	5	I was circumcised on the eighth day . I am from the people of Israel and the tribe of Benjamin . I am a Hebrew of the Hebrews . With respect to observing the Law , I ’ m a Pharisee .
CEB	Philippians	3	6	With respect to devotion to the faith , I harassed the church . With respect to righteousness under the Law , I ’ m blameless .
CEB	Philippians	3	7	These things were my assets , but I wrote them off as a loss for the sake of Christ .
CEB	Philippians	3	8	But even beyond that , I consider everything a loss in comparison with the superior value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord . I have lost everything for him , but what I lost I think of as sewer trash , so that I might gain Christ
CEB	Philippians	3	9	and be found in him . In Christ I have a righteousness that is not my own and that does not come from the Law but rather from the faithfulness of Christ . It is the righteousness of God that is based on faith .
CEB	Philippians	3	10	The righteousness that I have comes from knowing Christ , the power of his resurrection , and the participation in his sufferings . It includes being conformed to his death
CEB	Philippians	3	11	so that I may perhaps reach the goal of the resurrection of the dead .
CEB	Philippians	3	12	It ’ s not that I have already reached this goal or have already been perfected , but I pursue it , so that I may grab hold of it because Christ grabbed hold of me for just this purpose .
CEB	Philippians	3	13	Brothers and sisters , I myself don ’ t think I ’ ve reached it , but I do this one thing : I forget about the things behind me and reach out for the things ahead of me .
CEB	Philippians	3	14	The goal I pursue is the prize of God ’ s upward call in Christ Jesus .
CEB	Philippians	3	15	So all of us who are spiritually mature should think this way , and if anyone thinks differently , God will reveal it to him or her .
CEB	Philippians	3	16	Only let ’ s live in a way that is consistent with whatever level we have reached . Imitate Paul
CEB	Philippians	3	17	Brothers and sisters , become imitators of me and watch those who live this way—you can use us as models .
CEB	Philippians	3	18	As I have told you many times and now say with deep sadness , many people live as enemies of the cross .
CEB	Philippians	3	19	Their lives end with destruction . Their god is their stomach , and they take pride in their disgrace because their thoughts focus on earthly things .
CEB	Philippians	3	20	Our citizenship is in heaven . We look forward to a savior that comes from there—the Lord Jesus Christ .
CEB	Philippians	3	21	He will transform our humble bodies so that they are like his glorious body , by the power that also makes him able to subject all things to himself .
CEB	Philippians	4	4	Be glad in the Lord always ! Again I say , be glad !
CEB	Philippians	4	2	I urge Euodia and I urge Syntyche to come to an agreement in the Lord .
CEB	Philippians	4	3	Yes , and I ’ m also asking you , loyal friend , to help these women who have struggled together with me in the ministry of the gospel , along with Clement and the rest of my coworkers whose names are in the scroll of life .
CEB	Philippians	4	5	Let your gentleness show in your treatment of all people . The Lord is near .
CEB	Philippians	4	6	Don ’ t be anxious about anything ; rather , bring up all of your requests to God in your prayers and petitions , along with giving thanks .
CEB	Philippians	4	7	Then the peace of God that exceeds all understanding will keep your hearts and minds safe in Christ Jesus .
CEB	Philippians	4	8	From now on , brothers and sisters , if anything is excellent and if anything is admirable , focus your thoughts on these things : all that is true , all that is holy , all that is just , all that is pure , all that is lovely , and all that is worthy of praise .
CEB	Philippians	4	9	Practice these things : whatever you learned , received , heard , or saw in us . The God of peace will be with you . Paul ’ s thanks for gifts
CEB	Philippians	4	10	I was very glad in the Lord because now at last you have shown concern for me again . ( Of course you were always concerned but had no way to show it . )
CEB	Philippians	4	11	I ’ m not saying this because I need anything , for I have learned how to be content in any circumstance .
CEB	Philippians	4	12	I know the experience of being in need and of having more than enough ; I have learned the secret to being content in any and every circumstance , whether full or hungry or whether having plenty or being poor .
CEB	Philippians	4	13	I can endure all these things through the power of the one who gives me strength .
CEB	Philippians	4	14	Still , you have done well to share my distress .
CEB	Philippians	4	15	You Philippians know from the time of my first mission work in Macedonia how no church shared in supporting my ministry except you .
CEB	Philippians	4	16	You sent contributions repeatedly to take care of my needs even while I was in Thessalonica .
CEB	Philippians	4	17	I ’ m not hoping for a gift , but I am hoping for a profit that accumulates in your account .
CEB	Philippians	4	18	I now have plenty and it is more than enough . I am full to overflowing because I received the gifts that you sent from Epaphroditus . Those gifts give off a fragrant aroma , an acceptable sacrifice that pleases God .
CEB	Philippians	4	19	My God will meet your every need out of his riches in the glory that is found in Christ Jesus .
CEB	Philippians	4	20	Let glory be given to God our Father forever and always . Amen . Final greeting
CEB	Philippians	4	21	Greet all God ’ s people in Christ Jesus . The brothers and sisters with me send you their greeting .
CEB	Philippians	4	22	All God ’ s people here , especially those in Caesar ’ s household , send you their greeting .
CEB	Philippians	4	23	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirits .
CEB	Colossians	1	1	From Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus by God ’ s will , and Timothy our brother .
CEB	Colossians	1	2	To the holy and faithful brothers and sisters in Christ in Colossae . Grace and peace to you from God our Father . Thanksgiving and prayer for the Colossians
CEB	Colossians	1	3	We always give thanks to God , the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , when we pray for you .
CEB	Colossians	1	4	We ’ ve done this since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and your love for all God ’ s people .
CEB	Colossians	1	5	You have this faith and love because of the hope reserved for you in heaven . You previously heard about this hope through the true message , the good news ,
CEB	Colossians	1	6	which has come to you . This message has been bearing fruit and growing among you since the day you heard and truly understood God ’ s grace , in the same way that it is bearing fruit and growing in the whole world .
CEB	Colossians	1	7	You learned it from Epaphras , who is the fellow slave we love and Christ ’ s faithful minister for your sake .
CEB	Colossians	1	8	He informed us of your love in the Spirit .
CEB	Colossians	1	9	Because of this , since the day we heard about you , we haven ’ t stopped praying for you and asking for you to be filled with the knowledge of God ’ s will , with all wisdom and spiritual understanding .
CEB	Colossians	1	10	We ’ re praying this so that you can live lives that are worthy of the Lord and pleasing to him in every way : by producing fruit in every good work and growing in the knowledge of God ;
CEB	Colossians	1	11	by being strengthened through his glorious might so that you endure everything and have patience ;
CEB	Colossians	1	12	and by giving thanks with joy to the Father . He made it so you could take part in the inheritance , in light granted to God ’ s holy people .
CEB	Colossians	1	13	He rescued us from the control of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son he loves .
CEB	Colossians	1	14	He set us free through the Son and forgave our sins . Hymn about Christ ’ s work
CEB	Colossians	1	15	The Son is the image of the invisible God , the one who is first over all creation , [ a ]
CEB	Colossians	1	16	Because all things were created by him : both in the heavens and on the earth , the things that are visible and the things that are invisible . Whether they are thrones or powers , or rulers or authorities , all things were created through him and for him .
CEB	Colossians	1	17	He existed before all things , and all things are held together in him .
CEB	Colossians	1	18	He is the head of the body , the church , who is the beginning , the one who is firstborn from among the dead [ b ] so that he might occupy the first place in everything .
CEB	Colossians	1	19	Because all the fullness of God was pleased to live in him ,
CEB	Colossians	1	20	and he reconciled all things to himself through him— whether things on earth or in the heavens . He brought peace through the blood of his cross .
CEB	Colossians	1	21	Once you were alienated from God and you were enemies with him in your minds , which was shown by your evil actions .
CEB	Colossians	1	22	But now he has reconciled you by his physical body through death , to present you before God as a people who are holy , faultless , and without blame .
CEB	Colossians	1	23	But you need to remain well established and rooted in faith and not shift away from the hope given in the good news that you heard . This message has been preached throughout all creation under heaven . And I , Paul , became a servant of this good news . Paul ’ s service for the church
CEB	Colossians	1	24	Now I ’ m happy to be suffering for you . I ’ m completing what is missing from Christ ’ s sufferings with my own body . I ’ m doing this for the sake of his body , which is the church .
CEB	Colossians	1	25	I became a servant of the church by God ’ s commission , which was given to me for you , in order to complete God ’ s word .
CEB	Colossians	1	26	I ’ m completing it with a secret plan [ c ] that has been hidden for ages and generations but which has now been revealed to his holy people .
CEB	Colossians	1	27	God wanted to make the glorious riches of this secret plan [ d ] known among the Gentiles , which is Christ living in you , the hope of glory .
CEB	Colossians	1	28	This is what we preach as we warn and teach every person with all wisdom so that we might present each one mature in Christ .
CEB	Colossians	1	29	I work hard and struggle for this goal with his energy , which works in me powerfully . Footnotes - Colossians 1:15 Or firstborn of all creation - Colossians 1:18 Or first over the dead - Colossians 1:26 Or mystery - Colossians 1:27 Or mystery
CEB	Colossians	2	2	My goal is that their hearts would be encouraged and united together in love so that they might have all the riches of assurance that come with understanding , so that they might have the knowledge of the secret plan [ a ] of God , namely Christ .
CEB	Colossians	2	3	All the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden in him .
CEB	Colossians	2	4	I ’ m telling you this so that no one deceives you with convincing arguments ,
CEB	Colossians	2	5	because even though I am absent physically , I ’ m with you in spirit . I ’ m happy to see the discipline and stability of your faith in Christ . Error threatening the church
CEB	Colossians	2	6	So live in Christ Jesus the Lord in the same way as you received him .
CEB	Colossians	2	7	Be rooted and built up in him , be established in faith , and overflow with thanksgiving just as you were taught .
CEB	Colossians	2	8	See to it that nobody enslaves you with philosophy and foolish deception , which conform to human traditions and the way the world thinks and acts rather than Christ .
CEB	Colossians	2	9	All the fullness of deity lives in Christ ’ s body .
CEB	Colossians	2	10	And you have been filled by him , who is the head of every ruler and authority .
CEB	Colossians	2	11	In him you were also circumcised with a circumcision not administered by human hands . The circumcision of Christ is realized in the stripping away of the whole self dominated by sin .
CEB	Colossians	2	12	You were buried with him through baptism and raised with him through faith in the power of God , who raised him from the dead .
CEB	Colossians	2	13	When you were dead because of the things you had done wrong and because your body wasn ’ t circumcised , God made you alive with Christ and forgave all the things you had done wrong .
CEB	Colossians	2	14	He destroyed the record of the debt we owed , with its requirements that worked against us . He canceled it by nailing it to the cross .
CEB	Colossians	2	15	When he disarmed the rulers and authorities , he exposed them to public disgrace by leading them in a triumphal parade .
CEB	Colossians	2	16	So don ’ t let anyone judge you about eating or drinking or about a festival , a new moon observance , or sabbaths .
CEB	Colossians	2	17	These religious practices are only a shadow of what was coming—the body that cast the shadow is Christ .
CEB	Colossians	2	18	Don ’ t let anyone who wants to practice harsh self-denial and worship angels rob you of the prize . They go into detail about what they have seen in visions and have become unjustifiably arrogant by their selfish way of thinking .
CEB	Colossians	2	19	They don ’ t stay connected to the head . The head nourishes and supports the whole body through the joints and ligaments , so the body grows with a growth that is from God .
CEB	Colossians	2	20	If you died with Christ to the way the world thinks and acts , why do you submit to rules and regulations as though you were living in the world ?
CEB	Colossians	2	21	“ Don ’ t handle ! ” “ Don ’ t taste ! ” “ Don ’ t touch ! ”
CEB	Colossians	2	22	All these things cease to exist when they are used . Such rules are human commandments and teachings .
CEB	Colossians	2	23	They look like they are wise with this self-made religion and their self-denial by the harsh treatment of the body , but they are no help against indulging in selfish immoral behavior . Footnotes - Colossians 2:2 Or mystery
CEB	Colossians	3	3	You died , and your life is hidden with Christ in God .
CEB	Colossians	3	2	Think about the things above and not things on earth .
CEB	Colossians	3	4	When Christ , who is your life , is revealed , then you also will be revealed with him in glory .
CEB	Colossians	3	5	So put to death the parts of your life that belong to the earth , such as sexual immorality , moral corruption , lust , evil desire , and greed ( which is idolatry ) .
CEB	Colossians	3	6	The wrath of God is coming upon disobedient people because of these things .
CEB	Colossians	3	7	You used to live this way , when you were alive to these things .
CEB	Colossians	3	8	But now set aside these things , such as anger , rage , malice , slander , and obscene language .
CEB	Colossians	3	9	Don ’ t lie to each other . Take off the old human nature with its practices
CEB	Colossians	3	10	and put on the new nature , which is renewed in knowledge by conforming to the image of the one who created it .
CEB	Colossians	3	11	In this image there is neither Greek nor Jew , circumcised nor uncircumcised , barbarian , Scythian , slave nor free , but Christ is all things and in all people .
CEB	Colossians	3	12	Therefore , as God ’ s choice , holy and loved , put on compassion , kindness , humility , gentleness , and patience .
CEB	Colossians	3	13	Be tolerant with each other and , if someone has a complaint against anyone , forgive each other . As the Lord forgave you , so also forgive each other .
CEB	Colossians	3	14	And over all these things put on love , which is the perfect bond of unity .
CEB	Colossians	3	15	The peace of Christ must control your hearts—a peace into which you were called in one body . And be thankful people .
CEB	Colossians	3	16	The word of Christ must live in you richly . Teach and warn each other with all wisdom by singing psalms , hymns , and spiritual songs . Sing to God with gratitude in your hearts .
CEB	Colossians	3	17	Whatever you do , whether in speech or action , do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus and give thanks to God the Father through him .
CEB	Colossians	3	18	Wives , submit to your husbands in a way that is appropriate in the Lord .
CEB	Colossians	3	19	Husbands , love your wives and don ’ t be harsh with them .
CEB	Colossians	3	20	Children , obey your parents in everything , because this pleases the Lord .
CEB	Colossians	3	21	Parents , don ’ t provoke your children in a way that ends up discouraging them .
CEB	Colossians	3	22	Slaves , obey your masters on earth in everything . Don ’ t just obey like people pleasers when they are watching . Instead , obey with the single motivation of fearing the Lord .
CEB	Colossians	3	23	Whatever you do , do it from the heart for the Lord and not for people .
CEB	Colossians	3	24	You know that you will receive an inheritance as a reward . You serve the Lord Christ .
CEB	Colossians	3	25	But evildoers will receive their reward for their evil actions . There is no discrimination .
CEB	Colossians	4	4	Pray that I might be able to make it as clear as I ought to when I preach .
CEB	Colossians	4	2	Keep on praying and guard your prayers with thanksgiving .
CEB	Colossians	4	3	At the same time , pray for us also . Pray that God would open a door for the word so we can preach the secret plan [ a ] of Christ—which is why I ’ m in chains .
CEB	Colossians	4	5	Act wisely toward outsiders , making the most of the opportunity .
CEB	Colossians	4	6	Your speech should always be gracious and sprinkled with insight so that you may know how to respond to every person . Final greeting
CEB	Colossians	4	7	Tychicus , our dearly loved brother , faithful minister , and fellow slave in the Lord , will inform you about everything that has happened to me .
CEB	Colossians	4	8	This is why I sent him to you , so that you ’ ll know all about us and so he can encourage your hearts .
CEB	Colossians	4	9	I sent him with Onesimus , our faithful and dearly loved brother , who is one of you . They will let you know about everything here .
CEB	Colossians	4	10	Aristarchus , my fellow prisoner , says hello to you . So does Mark , Barnabas ’ cousin ( you received instructions about him ; if he comes to you , welcome him ) .
CEB	Colossians	4	11	Jesus , called Justus , also says hello . These are my only fellow workers for God ’ s kingdom who are Jewish converts . They have been an encouragement to me .
CEB	Colossians	4	12	Epaphras , who is one of you , says hello . He ’ s a slave of Christ Jesus who always wrestles for you in prayers so that you will stand firm and be fully mature and complete in the entire will of God .
CEB	Colossians	4	13	I can vouch for him that he has worked hard for you and for those in Laodicea and Hierapolis .
CEB	Colossians	4	14	Luke , the dearly loved physician , and Demas say hello .
CEB	Colossians	4	15	Say hello to the brothers and sisters in Laodicea , along with Nympha and the church that meets in her house .
CEB	Colossians	4	16	After this letter has been read to you publicly , make sure that the church in Laodicea reads it and that you read the one from Laodicea .
CEB	Colossians	4	17	And tell Archippus , “ See to it that you complete the ministry that you received in the Lord. ”

CEB	1%20Thessalonians	1	4	Brothers and sisters , you are loved by God , and we know that he has chosen you .
CEB	1%20Thessalonians	1	5	We know this because our good news didn ’ t come to you just in speech but also with power and the Holy Spirit and with deep conviction . You know as well as we do what kind of people we were when we were with you , which was for your sake .
CEB	1%20Thessalonians	1	6	You became imitators of us and of the Lord when you accepted the message that came from the Holy Spirit with joy in spite of great suffering .
CEB	1%20Thessalonians	1	7	As a result you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia .
CEB	1%20Thessalonians	1	8	The message about the Lord rang out from you , not only in Macedonia and Achaia but in every place . The news about your faithfulness to God has spread so that we don ’ t even need to mention it .
CEB	1%20Thessalonians	1	9	People tell us about what sort of welcome we had from you and how you turned to God from idols . As a result , you are serving [ b ] the living and true God ,

CEB	1%20Thessalonians	2	2	On the contrary , we had the courage through God to speak God ’ s good news in spite of a lot of opposition , although we had already suffered and were publicly insulted in Philippi , as you know .
CEB	1%20Thessalonians	2	3	Our appeal isn ’ t based on false information , the wrong motives , or deception .
CEB	1%20Thessalonians	2	4	Rather , we have been examined and approved by God to be trusted with the good news , and that ’ s exactly how we speak . We aren ’ t trying to please people , but we are trying to please God , who continues to examine our hearts .
CEB	1%20Thessalonians	2	5	As you know , we never used flattery , and God is our witness that we didn ’ t have greedy motives .
CEB	1%20Thessalonians	2	6	We didn ’ t ask for special treatment from people—not from you or from others—
CEB	1%20Thessalonians	2	7	although we could have thrown our weight around as Christ ’ s apostles . Instead , we were gentle with you like a nursing mother caring for her own children .
CEB	1%20Thessalonians	2	8	We were glad to share not only God ’ s good news with you but also our very lives because we cared for you so much .
CEB	1%20Thessalonians	2	9	You remember , brothers and sisters , our efforts and hard work . We preached God ’ s good news to you , while we worked night and day so we wouldn ’ t be a burden on any of you .
CEB	1%20Thessalonians	2	10	You and God are witnesses of how holy , just , and blameless we were toward you believers .
CEB	1%20Thessalonians	2	11	Likewise , you know how we treated each of you like a father treats his own children .
CEB	1%20Thessalonians	2	12	We appealed to you , encouraged you , and pleaded with you to live lives worthy of the God who is calling you into his own kingdom and glory . How the Thessalonians received God ’ s message
CEB	1%20Thessalonians	2	13	We also thank God constantly for this : when you accepted God ’ s word that you heard from us , you welcomed it for what it truly is . Instead of accepting it as a human message , you accepted it as God ’ s message , and it continues to work in you who are believers .
CEB	1%20Thessalonians	2	14	Brothers and sisters , you became imitators of the churches of God in Judea , which are in Christ Jesus . This was because you also suffered the same things from your own people as they did from the Jews .

CEB	2%20Thessalonians	1	8	He will give justice with blazing fire to those who don ’ t recognize God and don ’ t obey the good news of our Lord Jesus .
CEB	2%20Thessalonians	1	9	They will pay the penalty of eternal destruction away from the Lord ’ s presence and away from his mighty glory .
CEB	2%20Thessalonians	1	10	This will happen when he comes on that day to receive honor from his holy people and to be admired by everyone who has believed—and our testimony to you was believed .
CEB	2%20Thessalonians	1	11	We are constantly praying for you for this : that our God will make you worthy of his calling and accomplish every good desire and faithful work by his power .
CEB	2%20Thessalonians	1	12	Then the name of our Lord Jesus will be honored by you , and you will be honored by him , consistent with the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ .
CEB	2%20Thessalonians	2	2	We don ’ t want you to be easily confused in your mind or upset if you hear that the day of the Lord is already here , whether you hear it through some spirit , a message , or a letter supposedly from us .
CEB	2%20Thessalonians	2	3	Don ’ t let anyone deceive you in any way . That day won ’ t come unless the rebellion comes first and the person who is lawless is revealed , who is headed for destruction .
CEB	2%20Thessalonians	2	4	He is the opponent of every so-called god or object of worship and promotes himself over them . So he sits in God ’ s temple , displaying himself to show that he is God .
CEB	2%20Thessalonians	2	5	You remember that I used to tell you these things while I was with you , don ’ t you ?
CEB	2%20Thessalonians	2	6	Now you know what holds him back so that he can be revealed when his time comes .
CEB	2%20Thessalonians	2	7	The hidden plan to live without any law is at work now , but it will be secret only until the one who is holding it back is out of the way .
CEB	2%20Thessalonians	2	8	Then the person who is lawless will be revealed . The Lord Jesus will destroy him with the breath from his mouth . When the Lord comes , his appearance will put an end to him .
CEB	2%20Thessalonians	2	9	When the person who is lawless comes , it will happen through Satan ’ s effort , with all kinds of fake power , signs , and wonders .
CEB	2%20Thessalonians	2	10	It will happen with every sort of wicked deception of those who are heading toward destruction because they have refused to love the truth that would allow them to be saved .
CEB	2%20Thessalonians	2	11	This is why God will send them an influence that will mislead them so that they will believe the lie .
CEB	2%20Thessalonians	2	12	The result will be that everyone will be judged who is not convinced by the truth but is happy with injustice . Prayer of thanks and encouragement
CEB	2%20Thessalonians	2	13	But we always must thank God for you , brothers and sisters who are loved by God . This is because he chose you from the beginning to be the first crop of the harvest . This brought salvation , through your dedication to God by the Spirit and through your belief in the truth .
CEB	2%20Thessalonians	2	14	God called all of you through our good news so you could possess the honor of our Lord Jesus Christ .
CEB	2%20Thessalonians	2	15	So then , brothers and sisters , stand firm and hold on to the traditions we taught you , whether we taught you in person or through our letter .
CEB	2%20Thessalonians	2	16	Our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father loved us and through grace gave us eternal comfort and a good hope .
CEB	2%20Thessalonians	2	17	May he encourage your hearts and give you strength in every good thing you do or say .
CEB	2%20Thessalonians	3	2	Pray too that we will be rescued from inappropriate and evil people since everyone that we meet won ’ t respond with faith .
CEB	2%20Thessalonians	3	3	But the Lord is faithful and will give you strength and protect you from the evil one .
CEB	2%20Thessalonians	3	4	We are confident about you in the Lord—that you are doing and will keep doing what we tell you to do .
CEB	2%20Thessalonians	3	5	May the Lord lead your hearts to express God ’ s love and Christ ’ s endurance . Discipline for the undisciplined
CEB	2%20Thessalonians	3	6	Brothers and sisters , we command you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to stay away from every brother or sister who lives an undisciplined life that is not in line with the traditions that you received from us .
CEB	2%20Thessalonians	3	7	You yourselves know how you need to imitate us because we were not undisciplined when we were with you .
CEB	2%20Thessalonians	3	8	We didn ’ t eat anyone ’ s food without paying for it . Instead , we worked night and day with effort and hard work so that we would not impose on you .
CEB	2%20Thessalonians	3	9	We did this to give you an example to imitate , not because we didn ’ t have a right to insist on financial support .
CEB	2%20Thessalonians	3	10	Even when we were with you we were giving you this command : “ If anyone doesn ’ t want to work , they shouldn ’ t eat. ”
CEB	2%20Thessalonians	3	11	We hear that some of you are living an undisciplined life . They aren ’ t working , but they are meddling in other people ’ s business .
CEB	2%20Thessalonians	3	12	By the Lord Jesus Christ , we command and encourage such people to work quietly and put their own food on the table .
CEB	2%20Thessalonians	3	13	Brothers and sisters , don ’ t get discouraged in doing what is right .
CEB	2%20Thessalonians	3	14	Take note of anyone who doesn ’ t obey what we have said in this letter . Don ’ t associate with them so they will be ashamed of themselves .
CEB	2%20Thessalonians	3	15	Don ’ t treat them like enemies , but warn them like you would do for a brother or sister . Final greeting
CEB	2%20Thessalonians	3	16	May the Lord of peace himself give you peace always in every way . The Lord be with all of you .
CEB	2%20Thessalonians	3	17	I , Paul , am writing this greeting with my own hand . This verifies that the letter is from me , as in every letter of mine . This is how I write .
CEB	2%20Thessalonians	3	18	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with all of you .
CEB	1%20Timothy	1	1	Timothy 1:10 Or slave dealers
CEB	1%20Timothy	1	2	To Timothy , my true child in the faith . Grace , mercy , and peace from God the Father and from Christ Jesus our Lord . Timothy ’ s purpose in Ephesus
CEB	1%20Timothy	1	3	When I left for Macedonia , I asked you to stay behind in Ephesus so that you could instruct certain individuals not to spread wrong teaching .
CEB	1%20Timothy	1	4	They shouldn ’ t pay attention to myths and endless genealogies . Their teaching only causes useless guessing games instead of faithfulness to God ’ s way of doing things .
CEB	1%20Timothy	1	5	The goal of instruction is love from a pure heart , a good conscience , and a sincere faith .
CEB	1%20Timothy	1	6	Because they missed this goal , some people have been distracted by talk that doesn ’ t mean anything .
CEB	1%20Timothy	1	7	They want to be teachers of Law without understanding either what they are saying or what they are talking about with such confidence .
CEB	1%20Timothy	1	8	Now we know that the Law is good if used appropriately .
CEB	1%20Timothy	1	9	We understand this : the Law isn ’ t established for a righteous person but for people who live without laws and without obeying any authority . They are the ungodly and the sinners . They are people who are not spiritual , and nothing is sacred to them . They kill their fathers and mothers , and murder others .
CEB	1%20Timothy	1	10	They are people who are sexually unfaithful , and people who have intercourse with the same sex . They are kidnappers , [ a ] liars , individuals who give false testimonies in court , and those who do anything else that is opposed to sound teaching .
CEB	1%20Timothy	1	11	Sound teaching agrees with the glorious gospel of the blessed God that has been trusted to me . Thanksgiving
CEB	1%20Timothy	1	12	I thank Christ Jesus our Lord , who has given me strength because he considered me faithful . So he appointed me to ministry
CEB	1%20Timothy	1	13	even though I used to speak against him , attack his people , and I was proud . But I was shown mercy because I acted in ignorance and without faith .
CEB	1%20Timothy	1	14	Our Lord ’ s favor poured all over me along with the faithfulness and love that are in Christ Jesus .
CEB	1%20Timothy	1	15	This saying is reliable and deserves full acceptance : “ Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners ” —and I ’ m the biggest sinner of all .
CEB	1%20Timothy	1	16	But this is why I was shown mercy , so that Christ Jesus could show his endless patience to me first of all . So I ’ m an example for those who are going to believe in him for eternal life .
CEB	1%20Timothy	1	17	Now to the king of the ages , to the immortal , invisible , and only God , may honor and glory be given to him forever and always ! Amen . Importance of faith and a good conscience
CEB	1%20Timothy	1	18	Timothy , my child , I ’ m giving you these instructions based on the prophecies that were once made about you . So if you follow them , you can wage a good war
CEB	1%20Timothy	1	19	because you have faith and a good conscience . Some people have ruined their faith because they refused to listen to their conscience ,
CEB	1%20Timothy	1	20	such as Hymenaeus and Alexander . I ’ ve handed them over to Satan so that they can be taught not to speak against God . Footnotes -
CEB	1%20Timothy	2	1	Timothy 2:15 Or saved through childbearing
CEB	1%20Timothy	2	2	Pray for kings and everyone who is in authority so that we can live a quiet and peaceful life in complete godliness and dignity .
CEB	1%20Timothy	2	3	This is right and it pleases God our savior ,
CEB	1%20Timothy	2	4	who wants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth .
CEB	1%20Timothy	2	5	There is one God and one mediator between God and humanity , the human Christ Jesus ,
CEB	1%20Timothy	2	6	who gave himself as a payment to set all people free . This was a testimony that was given at the right time .
CEB	1%20Timothy	2	7	I was appointed to be a preacher and apostle of this testimony—I ’ m telling the truth and I ’ m not lying ! I ’ m a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth . Instructions for men and women
CEB	1%20Timothy	2	8	Therefore , I want men to pray everywhere by lifting up hands that are holy , without anger or argument .
CEB	1%20Timothy	2	9	In the same way , I want women to enhance their appearance with clothing that is modest and sensible , not with elaborate hairstyles , gold , pearls , or expensive clothes .
CEB	1%20Timothy	2	10	They should make themselves attractive by doing good , which is appropriate for women who claim to honor God .
CEB	1%20Timothy	2	11	A wife [ a ] should learn quietly with complete submission .
CEB	1%20Timothy	2	12	I don ’ t allow a wife [ b ] to teach or to control her husband . [ c ] Instead , she should be a quiet listener .
CEB	1%20Timothy	2	13	Adam was formed first , and then Eve .
CEB	1%20Timothy	2	14	Adam wasn ’ t deceived , but rather his wife [ d ] became the one who stepped over the line because she was completely deceived .
CEB	1%20Timothy	2	15	But a wife [ e ] will be brought safely through childbirth , [ f ] if they both continue in faith , love , and holiness , together with self-control . Footnotes -
CEB	1%20Timothy	3	1	Timothy 3:12 Or deacons
CEB	1%20Timothy	3	3	They shouldn ’ t be addicted to alcohol or be a bully . Instead , they should be gentle , peaceable , and not greedy .
CEB	1%20Timothy	3	2	So the church ’ s supervisor must be without fault . They should be faithful to their spouse , sober , modest , and honest . They should show hospitality and be skilled at teaching .
CEB	1%20Timothy	3	4	They should manage their own household well—they should see that their children are obedient with complete respect ,
CEB	1%20Timothy	3	5	because if they don ’ t know how to manage their own household , how can they take care of God ’ s church ?
CEB	1%20Timothy	3	6	They shouldn ’ t be new believers so that they won ’ t become proud and fall under the devil ’ s spell .
CEB	1%20Timothy	3	7	They should also have a good reputation with those outside the church so that they won ’ t be embarrassed and fall into the devil ’ s trap . Servants in God ’ s household
CEB	1%20Timothy	3	8	In the same way , servants [ b ] in the church should be dignified , not two-faced , heavy drinkers , or greedy for money .
CEB	1%20Timothy	3	9	They should hold on to the faith that has been revealed with a clear conscience .
CEB	1%20Timothy	3	10	They should also be tested and then serve if they are without fault .
CEB	1%20Timothy	3	11	In the same way , women who are servants [ c ] in the church should be dignified and not gossip . They should be sober and faithful in everything they do .
CEB	1%20Timothy	3	12	Servants [ d ] must be faithful to their spouse and manage their children and their own households well .
CEB	1%20Timothy	3	13	Those who have served well gain a good standing and considerable confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus . Leading God ’ s household
CEB	1%20Timothy	3	14	I hope to come to you quickly . But I ’ m writing these things to you so that
CEB	1%20Timothy	3	15	if I ’ m delayed , you ’ ll know how you should behave in God ’ s household . It is the church of the living God and the backbone and support of the truth .
CEB	1%20Timothy	3	16	Without question , the mystery of godliness is great : he was revealed as a human , declared righteous by the Spirit , seen by angels , preached throughout the nations , believed in around the world , and taken up in glory . Footnotes -
CEB	1%20Timothy	4	1	Timothy
CEB	1%20Timothy	4	4	Everything that has been created by God is good , and nothing that is received with thanksgiving should be rejected .
CEB	1%20Timothy	4	2	They will be controlled by the pretense of lying , and their own consciences will be seared .
CEB	1%20Timothy	4	3	They will prohibit marriage and eating foods that God created—and he intended them to be accepted with thanksgiving by those who are faithful and have come to know the truth .
CEB	1%20Timothy	4	5	These things are made holy by God ’ s word and prayer .
CEB	1%20Timothy	4	6	If you point these things out to the believers , you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus who has been trained by the words of faith and the good teaching that you ’ ve carefully followed .
CEB	1%20Timothy	4	7	But stay away from the godless myths that are passed down from the older women . Practices of spiritual leadership Train yourself for a holy life !
CEB	1%20Timothy	4	8	While physical training has some value , training in holy living is useful for everything . It has promise for this life now and the life to come .
CEB	1%20Timothy	4	9	This saying is reliable and deserves complete acceptance .
CEB	1%20Timothy	4	10	We work and struggle for this : “ Our hope is set on the living God , who is the savior of all people , especially those who believe. ”
CEB	1%20Timothy	4	11	Command these things . Teach them .
CEB	1%20Timothy	4	12	Don ’ t let anyone look down on you because you are young . Instead , set an example for the believers through your speech , behavior , love , faith , and by being sexually pure .
CEB	1%20Timothy	4	13	Until I arrive , pay attention to public reading , preaching , and teaching .
CEB	1%20Timothy	4	14	Don ’ t neglect the spiritual gift in you that was given through prophecy when the elders laid hands on you .
CEB	1%20Timothy	4	15	Practice these things , and live by them so that your progress will be visible to all .
CEB	1%20Timothy	4	16	Focus on working on your own development and on what you teach . If you do this , you will save yourself and those who hear you .
CEB	1%20Timothy	5	1	Timothy
CEB	1%20Timothy	5	5	A widow who is truly needy and all alone puts her hope in God and keeps on going with requests and prayers , night and day .
CEB	1%20Timothy	5	2	treat older women like your mother , and treat younger women like your sisters with appropriate respect .
CEB	1%20Timothy	5	3	Take care of widows who are truly needy .
CEB	1%20Timothy	5	4	But if a particular widow has children or grandchildren , they should first learn to respect their own family and repay their parents , because this pleases God .
CEB	1%20Timothy	5	6	But a widow who tries to live a life of luxury is dead even while she is alive .
CEB	1%20Timothy	5	7	Teach these things so that the families [ a ] will be without fault .
CEB	1%20Timothy	5	8	But if someone doesn ’ t provide for their own family , and especially for a member of their household , they have denied the faith . They are worse than those who have no faith .
CEB	1%20Timothy	5	9	Put a widow on the list who is older than
CEB	1%20Timothy	5	60	years old and who was faithful to her husband .
CEB	1%20Timothy	5	10	She should have a reputation for doing good : raising children , providing hospitality to strangers , washing the feet of the saints , helping those in distress , and dedicating herself to every kind of good thing .
CEB	1%20Timothy	5	11	But don ’ t accept younger widows for the list . When their physical desires distract them from Christ , they will want to get married .
CEB	1%20Timothy	5	12	Then they will be judged for setting aside their earlier commitment .
CEB	1%20Timothy	5	13	Also , they learn to be lazy by going from house to house . They are not only lazy , but they also become gossips and busybodies , talking about things they shouldn ’ t .
CEB	1%20Timothy	5	14	So I want younger widows to marry , have children , and manage their homes so that they won ’ t give the enemy any reason to slander us . (
CEB	1%20Timothy	5	15	Some have already turned away to follow Satan . )
CEB	1%20Timothy	5	16	If any woman who is a believer has widows in her family , she should take care of them and not burden the church , so that it can help other widows who are truly needy . Instructions for elders
CEB	1%20Timothy	5	17	Elders who lead well should be paid double , especially those who work with public speaking and teaching .
CEB	1%20Timothy	5	18	The scripture says , Don ’ t put a muzzle on an ox while it treads grain , [ b ] and Workers deserve their pay . [ c ]
CEB	1%20Timothy	5	19	Don ’ t accept an accusation made against an elder unless it is confirmed by two or three witnesses .
CEB	1%20Timothy	5	20	Discipline those who are sinning in front of everyone so that all the others will be afraid .
CEB	1%20Timothy	5	21	I charge you before God and Christ Jesus and the elect angels to follow these practices without bias , and without playing favorites .
CEB	1%20Timothy	5	22	Don ’ t rush to commission anyone to leadership , and don ’ t participate in the sins of others . Keep yourself morally pure .
CEB	1%20Timothy	5	23	Don ’ t drink water anymore , but use a little wine because of your stomach problems and your frequent illnesses .
CEB	1%20Timothy	5	24	The sins of some people are obvious , and the sins are judged before the people must face judgment , but the sins of other people show up later .
CEB	1%20Timothy	5	25	In the same way , the good that people do is also obvious and can ’ t be hidden .
CEB	1%20Timothy	6	1	Timothy
CEB	1%20Timothy	6	6	Actually , godliness is a great source of profit when it is combined with being happy with what you already have .
CEB	1%20Timothy	6	2	And those who have masters who are believers shouldn ’ t look down on them because they are brothers . Instead , they should serve them more faithfully , because the people who benefit from your good service are believers who are loved . Teach and encourage these things . Warning about false teachers
CEB	1%20Timothy	6	3	If anyone teaches anything different and doesn ’ t agree with sound teaching about our Lord Jesus Christ and teaching that is consistent with godliness ,
CEB	1%20Timothy	6	4	that person is conceited . They don ’ t understand anything but have a sick obsession with debates and arguments . This creates jealousy , conflict , verbal abuse , and evil suspicions .
CEB	1%20Timothy	6	5	There is constant bickering between people whose minds are ruined and who have been robbed of the truth . They think that godliness is a way to make money !
CEB	1%20Timothy	6	7	We didn ’ t bring anything into the world and so we can ’ t take anything out of it :
CEB	1%20Timothy	6	8	we ’ ll be happy with food and clothing .
CEB	1%20Timothy	6	9	But people who are trying to get rich fall into temptation . They are trapped by many stupid and harmful passions that plunge people into ruin and destruction .
CEB	1%20Timothy	6	10	The love of money is the root of all kinds of evil . Some have wandered away from the faith and have impaled themselves with a lot of pain because they made money their goal .
CEB	1%20Timothy	6	11	But as for you , man of God , run away from all these things . Instead , pursue righteousness , holy living , faithfulness , love , endurance , and gentleness .
CEB	1%20Timothy	6	12	Compete in the good fight of faith . Grab hold of eternal life—you were called to it , and you made a good confession of it in the presence of many witnesses .
CEB	1%20Timothy	6	13	I command you in the presence of God , who gives life to all things , and Christ Jesus , who made the good confession when testifying before Pontius Pilate .
CEB	1%20Timothy	6	14	Obey this order without fault or failure until the appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ .
CEB	1%20Timothy	6	15	The timing of this appearance is revealed by God alone , who is the blessed and only master , the King of kings and Lord of lords .
CEB	1%20Timothy	6	16	He alone has immortality and lives in light that no one can come near . No human being has ever seen or is able to see him . Honor and eternal power belong to him . Amen . Wealth of good works
CEB	1%20Timothy	6	17	Tell people who are rich at this time not to become egotistical and not to place their hope on their finances , which are uncertain . Instead , they need to hope in God , who richly provides everything for our enjoyment .
CEB	1%20Timothy	6	18	Tell them to do good , to be rich in the good things they do , to be generous , and to share with others .
CEB	1%20Timothy	6	19	When they do these things , they will save a treasure for themselves that is a good foundation for the future . That way they can take hold of what is truly life . Protect the tradition
CEB	1%20Timothy	6	20	Timothy , protect what has been given to you in trust . Avoid godless and pointless discussions and the contradictory claims of so-called “ knowledge. ”
CEB	1%20Timothy	6	21	When some people adopted this false knowledge , they missed the goal of faith . May grace be with you all .
CEB	2%20Timothy	1	2	To Timothy , my dear child . Grace , mercy , and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord . Thanksgiving and prayer
CEB	2%20Timothy	1	1	From Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus by God ’ s will , to promote the promise of life that is in Christ Jesus .
CEB	2%20Timothy	1	3	I ’ m grateful to God , whom I serve with a good conscience as my ancestors did . I constantly remember you in my prayers day and night .
CEB	2%20Timothy	1	4	When I remember your tears , I long to see you so that I can be filled with happiness .
CEB	2%20Timothy	1	5	I ’ m reminded of your authentic faith , which first lived in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice . I ’ m sure that this faith is also inside you .
CEB	2%20Timothy	1	6	Because of this , I ’ m reminding you to revive God ’ s gift that is in you through the laying on of my hands .
CEB	2%20Timothy	1	7	God didn ’ t give us a spirit that is timid but one that is powerful , loving , and self-controlled . Don ’ t be ashamed of the testimony
CEB	2%20Timothy	1	8	So don ’ t be ashamed of the testimony about the Lord or of me , his prisoner . Instead , share the suffering for the good news , depending on God ’ s power .
CEB	2%20Timothy	1	9	God is the one who saved and called us with a holy calling . This wasn ’ t based on what we have done , but it was based on his own purpose and grace that he gave us in Christ Jesus before time began .
CEB	2%20Timothy	1	10	Now his grace is revealed through the appearance of our savior , Christ Jesus . He destroyed death and brought life and immortality into clear focus through the good news .
CEB	2%20Timothy	1	11	I was appointed a messenger , apostle , and teacher of this good news .
CEB	2%20Timothy	1	12	This is also why I ’ m suffering the way I do , but I ’ m not ashamed . I know the one in whom I ’ ve placed my trust . I ’ m convinced that God is powerful enough to protect what he has placed in my trust until that day .
CEB	2%20Timothy	1	13	Hold on to the pattern of sound teaching that you heard from me with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus .
CEB	2%20Timothy	1	14	Protect this good thing that has been placed in your trust through the Holy Spirit who lives in us .
CEB	2%20Timothy	1	15	You know that everyone in Asia has turned away from me , including Phygelus and Hermogenes .
CEB	2%20Timothy	1	16	May the Lord show mercy to Onesiphorus ’ household , because he supported me many times and he wasn ’ t ashamed of my imprisonment .
CEB	2%20Timothy	1	17	After I arrived in Rome , he quickly looked for me and found me .
CEB	2%20Timothy	1	18	May the Lord allow him to find his mercy on that day ( and you know very well how much he served me in Ephesus ) .
CEB	2%20Timothy	2	2	Timothy 2:20 Or dishonorable purposes
CEB	2%20Timothy	2	3	Accept your share of suffering like a good soldier of Christ Jesus .
CEB	2%20Timothy	2	4	Nobody who serves in the military gets tied up with civilian matters , so that they can please the one who recruited them .
CEB	2%20Timothy	2	5	Also in the same way , athletes don ’ t win unless they follow the rules .
CEB	2%20Timothy	2	6	A hardworking farmer should get the first share of the crop .
CEB	2%20Timothy	2	7	Think about what I ’ m saying ; the Lord will give you understanding about everything .
CEB	2%20Timothy	2	8	Remember Jesus Christ , who was raised from the dead and descended from David . This is my good news .
CEB	2%20Timothy	2	9	This is the reason I ’ m suffering to the point that I ’ m in prison like a common criminal . But God ’ s word can not be imprisoned .
CEB	2%20Timothy	2	10	This is why I endure everything for the sake of those who are chosen by God so that they too may experience salvation in Christ Jesus with eternal glory .
CEB	2%20Timothy	2	11	This saying is reliable : “ If we have died together , we will also live together .
CEB	2%20Timothy	2	12	If we endure , we will also rule together . If we deny him , he will also deny us .
CEB	2%20Timothy	2	13	If we are disloyal , he stays faithful ” because he can ’ t be anything else than what he is . Speak , instruct , and act correctly
CEB	2%20Timothy	2	14	Remind them of these things and warn them in the sight of God not to engage in battles over words that aren ’ t helpful and only destroy those who hear them .
CEB	2%20Timothy	2	15	Make an effort to present yourself to God as a tried-and-true worker , who doesn ’ t need to be ashamed but is one who interprets the message of truth correctly .
CEB	2%20Timothy	2	16	Avoid their godless discussions , because they will lead many people into ungodly behavior ,
CEB	2%20Timothy	2	17	and their ideas will spread like an infection . This includes Hymenaeus and Philetus ,
CEB	2%20Timothy	2	18	who have deviated from the truth by claiming that the resurrection has already happened . This has undermined some people ’ s faith .
CEB	2%20Timothy	2	19	God ’ s solid foundation is still standing with this sign : The Lord knows the people who belong to him , [ a ] and Everyone who confesses the Lord ’ s name must avoid wickedness . [ b ]
CEB	2%20Timothy	2	20	In a mansion , there aren ’ t just gold and silver bowls but also some bowls that are made of wood and clay . Some are meant for special uses , some for garbage . [ c ]
CEB	2%20Timothy	2	21	So if anyone washes filth off themselves , they will be set apart as a “ special bowl. ” They will be useful to the owner of the mansion for every sort of good work . Avoid conflict with opponents

CEB	2%20Timothy	2	23	Avoid foolish and thoughtless discussions , since you know that they produce conflicts .
CEB	2%20Timothy	2	24	God ’ s slave shouldn ’ t be argumentative but should be kind toward all people , able to teach , patient ,
CEB	2%20Timothy	2	25	and should correct opponents with gentleness . Perhaps God will change their mind and give them a knowledge of the truth .

CEB	2%20Timothy	3	9	But they won ’ t get very far . Their foolishness will become obvious to everyone like those others . Take Paul as your model

CEB	Titus	1	1	From Paul , a slave of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ . I ’ m sent to bring about the faith of God ’ s chosen people and a knowledge of the truth that agrees with godliness .
CEB	Titus	1	2	Their faith and this knowledge are based on the hope of eternal life that God , who doesn ’ t lie , promised before time began .
CEB	Titus	1	3	God revealed his message at the appropriate time through preaching , and I was trusted with preaching this message by the command of God our savior .
CEB	Titus	1	4	To Titus , my true child in a common faith . Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our savior . Appointing elders
CEB	Titus	1	5	The reason I left you behind in Crete was to organize whatever needs to be done and to appoint elders in each city , as I told you .
CEB	Titus	1	6	Elders should be without fault . They should be faithful to their spouse , [ a ] and have faithful children who can ’ t be accused of self-indulgence or rebelliousness .
CEB	Titus	1	7	This is because supervisors [ b ] should be without fault as God ’ s managers : they shouldn ’ t be stubborn , irritable , addicted to alcohol , a bully , or greedy .
CEB	Titus	1	8	Instead , they should show hospitality , love what is good , and be reasonable , ethical , godly , and self-controlled .
CEB	Titus	1	9	They must pay attention to the reliable message as it has been taught to them so that they can encourage people with healthy instruction and refute those who speak against it . Correcting rebellious people
CEB	Titus	1	10	In fact , there are many who are rebellious people , loudmouths , and deceivers , especially some of those who are Jewish believers . [ c ]
CEB	Titus	1	11	They must be silenced because they upset entire households . They teach what they shouldn ’ t to make money dishonestly .
CEB	Titus	1	12	Someone who is one of their own prophets said , “ People from Crete are always liars , wild animals , and lazy gluttons. ”
CEB	Titus	1	13	This statement is true . Because of this , correct them firmly , so that they can be healthy in their faith .
CEB	Titus	1	14	They shouldn ’ t pay attention to Jewish myths and commands from people who reject the truth .
CEB	Titus	1	15	Everything is clean to those who are clean , but nothing is clean to those who are corrupt and without faith . Instead , their mind and conscience are corrupted .
CEB	Titus	1	16	They claim to know God , but they deny God by the things that they do . They are detestable , disobedient , and disqualified to do anything good . Footnotes - Titus 1:6 Or they should be a one-woman man . - Titus 1:7 Or overseers , bishops - Titus 1:10 Or from the circumcision
CEB	Titus	2	2	Tell the older men to be sober , dignified , sensible , and healthy in respect to their faith , love , and patience .
CEB	Titus	2	3	Likewise , tell the older women to be reverent in their behavior , teaching what is good , rather than being gossips or addicted to heavy drinking .
CEB	Titus	2	4	That way they can mentor young women to love their husbands and children ,
CEB	Titus	2	5	and to be sensible , morally pure , working at home , kind and submissive to their own husbands , so that God ’ s word won ’ t be ridiculed .
CEB	Titus	2	6	Likewise , encourage the younger men to be sensible
CEB	Titus	2	7	in every way . Offer yourself as a role model of good actions . Show integrity , seriousness ,
CEB	Titus	2	8	and a sound message that is above criticism when you teach , so that any opponent will be ashamed because they won ’ t find anything bad to say about us .
CEB	Titus	2	9	Tell slaves to submit to their own masters and please them in everything they do . They shouldn ’ t talk back
CEB	Titus	2	10	or steal . Instead , they should show that they are completely reliable in everything so that they might make the teaching about God our savior attractive in every way .
CEB	Titus	2	11	The grace of God has appeared , bringing salvation to all people .
CEB	Titus	2	12	It educates us so that we can live sensible , ethical , and godly lives right now by rejecting ungodly lives and the desires of this world .
CEB	Titus	2	13	At the same time we wait for the blessed hope and the glorious appearance of our great God and savior Jesus Christ .
CEB	Titus	2	14	He gave himself for us in order to rescue us from every kind of lawless behavior , and cleanse a special people for himself who are eager to do good actions .
CEB	Titus	2	15	Talk about these things . Encourage and correct with complete authority . Don ’ t let anyone disrespect you .
CEB	Titus	3	3	We were once foolish , disobedient , deceived , and slaves to our desires and various pleasures too . We were spending our lives in evil behavior and jealousy . We were disgusting , and we hated other people .
CEB	Titus	3	1	Remind them to submit to rulers and authorities . They should be obedient and ready to do every good thing .
CEB	Titus	3	2	They shouldn ’ t speak disrespectfully about anyone , but they should be peaceful , kind , and show complete courtesy toward everyone .
CEB	Titus	3	4	But “ when God our savior ’ s kindness and love appeared ,
CEB	Titus	3	5	he saved us because of his mercy , not because of righteous things we had done . He did it through the washing of new birth and the renewing by the Holy Spirit ,
CEB	Titus	3	6	which God poured out upon us generously through Jesus Christ our savior .
CEB	Titus	3	7	So , since we have been made righteous by his grace , we can inherit the hope for eternal life. ”
CEB	Titus	3	8	This saying is reliable . And I want you to insist on these things , so that those who have come to believe in God might give careful attention to doing good . These things are good and useful for everyone . Final instructions and greetings
CEB	Titus	3	9	Avoid stupid controversies , genealogies , and fights about the Law , because they are useless and worthless .
CEB	Titus	3	10	After a first and second warning , have nothing more to do with a person who causes conflict ,
CEB	Titus	3	11	because you know that someone like this is twisted and sinful—so they condemn themselves .
CEB	Titus	3	12	When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you , try to come to me in Nicopolis , because I ’ ve decided to spend the winter there .
CEB	Titus	3	13	Help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey with enthusiasm so that they won ’ t need anything .
CEB	Titus	3	14	But our people should also learn to devote themselves to doing good in order to meet pressing needs so they aren ’ t unproductive .
CEB	Titus	3	15	Everyone with me greets you ; greet those who love us faithfully . Grace be with all of you .
CEB	Philemon	1	1	From Paul , who is a prisoner for the cause of Christ Jesus , and our brother Timothy . To Philemon our dearly loved coworker ,
CEB	Philemon	1	2	Apphia our sister , Archippus our fellow soldier , and the church that meets in your house .
CEB	Philemon	1	3	May the grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ be with you . Paul ’ s prayer for Philemon
CEB	Philemon	1	4	Philemon , I thank my God every time I mention you in my prayers
CEB	Philemon	1	5	because I ’ ve heard of your love and faithfulness , which you have both for the Lord Jesus and for all God ’ s people .
CEB	Philemon	1	6	I pray that your partnership in the faith might become effective by an understanding of all that is good among us in Christ .
CEB	Philemon	1	7	I have great joy and encouragement because of your love , since the hearts of God ’ s people are refreshed by your actions , my brother . Paul ’ s appeal for Onesimus
CEB	Philemon	1	8	Therefore , though I have enough confidence in Christ to command you to do the right thing ,
CEB	Philemon	1	9	I would rather appeal to you through love . I , Paul—an old man , and now also a prisoner for Christ Jesus—
CEB	Philemon	1	10	appeal to you for my child Onesimus . I became his father in the faith during my time in prison .
CEB	Philemon	1	11	He was useless to you before , but now he is useful to both of us .
CEB	Philemon	1	12	I ’ m sending him back to you , which is like sending you my own heart .
CEB	Philemon	1	13	I considered keeping him with me so that he might serve me in your place during my time in prison because of the gospel .
CEB	Philemon	1	14	However , I didn ’ t want to do anything without your consent so that your act of kindness would occur willingly and not under pressure .
CEB	Philemon	1	15	Maybe this is the reason that Onesimus was separated from you for a while so that you might have him back forever—
CEB	Philemon	1	16	no longer as a slave but more than a slave—that is , as a dearly loved brother . He is especially a dearly loved brother to me . How much more can he become a brother to you , personally and spiritually in the Lord !
CEB	Philemon	1	17	So , if you really consider me a partner , welcome Onesimus as if you were welcoming me .
CEB	Philemon	1	18	If he has harmed you in any way or owes you money , charge it to my account .
CEB	Philemon	1	19	I , Paul , will pay it back to you ( I ’ m writing this with my own hand ) . Of course , I won ’ t mention that you owe me your life .
CEB	Philemon	1	20	Yes , brother , I want this favor from you in the Lord ! Refresh my heart in Christ .
CEB	Philemon	1	21	I ’ m writing to you , confident of your obedience and knowing that you will do more than what I ask .
CEB	Philemon	1	22	Also , one more thing—prepare a guest room for me . I hope that I will be released from prison to be with you because of your prayers . Final greeting
CEB	Philemon	1	23	Epaphras , who is in prison with me for the cause of Christ Jesus , greets you ,
CEB	Philemon	1	24	as well as my coworkers Mark , Aristarchus , Demas , and Luke .
CEB	Philemon	1	25	May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit .
CEB	Hebrews	1	1	In the past , God spoke through the prophets to our ancestors in many times and many ways .
CEB	Hebrews	1	2	In these final days , though , he spoke to us through a Son . God made his Son the heir of everything and created the world through him .
CEB	Hebrews	1	3	The Son is the light of God ’ s glory and the imprint of God ’ s being . He maintains everything with his powerful message . After he carried out the cleansing of people from their sins , he sat down at the right side of the highest majesty .
CEB	Hebrews	1	4	And the Son became so much greater than the other messengers , such as angels , that he received a more important title than theirs . Speaking to the Son and angels
CEB	Hebrews	1	5	After all , when did God ever say to any of the angels : You are my Son . Today I have become your Father ? [ a ] Or , even , I will be his Father , and he will be my Son ? [ b ]
CEB	Hebrews	1	6	But then , when he brought his firstborn into the world , he said , All of God ’ s angels must worship him . [ c ]
CEB	Hebrews	1	7	He talks about the angels : He ’ s the one who uses the spirits for his messengers and who uses flames of fire as ministers . [ d ]
CEB	Hebrews	1	8	But he says to his Son , God , your throne is forever and your kingdom ’ s scepter is a rod of justice .
CEB	Hebrews	1	9	You loved righteousness and hated lawless behavior . That is why God , your God , has anointed you more than your companions with the oil of joy . [ e ]
CEB	Hebrews	1	10	And he says , You , Lord , laid the earth ’ s foundations in the beginning , and the heavens are made by your hands .
CEB	Hebrews	1	11	They will pass away , but you remain . They will all wear out like old clothes .
CEB	Hebrews	1	12	You will fold them up like a coat . They will be changed like a person changes clothes , but you stay the same , and the years of your life won ’ t come to an end . [ f ]
CEB	Hebrews	1	13	When has he ever said to any of the angels , Sit at my right side until I put your enemies under your feet like a footstool ? [ g ]
CEB	Hebrews	1	14	Aren ’ t all the angels ministering spirits who are sent to serve those who are going to inherit salvation ?
CEB	Hebrews	2	2	If the message that was spoken by angels was reliable , and every offense and act of disobedience received an appropriate consequence ,
CEB	Hebrews	2	3	how will we escape if we ignore such a great salvation ? It was first announced through the Lord , and then it was confirmed by those who heard him .
CEB	Hebrews	2	4	God also vouched for their message with signs , amazing things , various miracles , and gifts from the Holy Spirit , which were handed out the way he wanted . Jesus is the enthroned human being
CEB	Hebrews	2	5	God didn ’ t put the world that is coming ( the world we are talking about ) under the angels ’ control .
CEB	Hebrews	2	6	Instead , someone declared somewhere , What is humanity that you think about them ? Or what are the human beings that you care about them ?
CEB	Hebrews	2	7	For a while you made them lower than angels . You crowned the human beings with glory and honor .
CEB	Hebrews	2	8	You put everything under their control . [ a ] When he puts everything under their control , he doesn ’ t leave anything out of control . But right now , we don ’ t see everything under their control yet .
CEB	Hebrews	2	9	However , we do see the one who was made lower in order than the angels for a little while—it ’ s Jesus ! He ’ s the one who is now crowned with glory and honor because of the suffering of his death . He suffered death so that he could taste death for everyone through God ’ s grace . Qualified to be a high priest
CEB	Hebrews	2	10	It was appropriate for God , for whom and through whom everything exists , to use experiences of suffering to make perfect the pioneer of salvation . This salvation belongs to many sons and daughters whom he ’ s leading to glory .
CEB	Hebrews	2	11	This is because the one who makes people holy and the people who are being made holy all come from one source . That is why Jesus isn ’ t ashamed to call them brothers and sisters when he says ,
CEB	Hebrews	2	12	I will publicly announce your name to my brothers and sisters . I will praise you in the middle of the assembly . [ b ]
CEB	Hebrews	2	13	He also says , I will rely on him . [ c ] And also , Here I am with the children whom God has given to me . [ d ]
CEB	Hebrews	2	14	Therefore , since the children share in flesh and blood , he also shared the same things in the same way . He did this to destroy the one who holds the power over death—the devil—by dying .
CEB	Hebrews	2	15	He set free those who were held in slavery their entire lives by their fear of death .
CEB	Hebrews	2	16	Of course , he isn ’ t trying to help angels , but rather he ’ s helping Abraham ’ s descendants .
CEB	Hebrews	2	17	Therefore , he had to be made like his brothers and sisters in every way . This was so that he could become a merciful and faithful high priest in things relating to God , in order to wipe away the sins of the people .
CEB	Hebrews	2	18	He ’ s able to help those who are being tempted , since he himself experienced suffering when he was tempted .
CEB	Hebrews	3	3	But he deserves greater glory than Moses in the same way that the builder of the house deserves more honor than the house itself .
CEB	Hebrews	3	2	Jesus was faithful to the one who appointed him just like Moses was faithful in God ’ s house .
CEB	Hebrews	3	4	Every house is built by someone , but God is the builder of everything .
CEB	Hebrews	3	5	Moses was faithful in all God ’ s house as a servant in order to affirm the things that would be spoken later .
CEB	Hebrews	3	6	But Jesus was faithful over God ’ s house as a Son . We are his house if we hold on to the confidence and the pride that our hope gives us . Respond to Jesus ’ voice now
CEB	Hebrews	3	7	So , as the Holy Spirit says , Today , if you hear his voice ,
CEB	Hebrews	3	8	don ’ t have stubborn hearts as they did in the rebellion , on the day when they tested me in the desert .
CEB	Hebrews	3	9	That is where your ancestors challenged and tested me , though they had seen my work for forty years .
CEB	Hebrews	3	10	So I was angry with them . I said , “ Their hearts always go off course , and they don ’ t know my ways. ”
CEB	Hebrews	3	11	Because of my anger I swore : “ They will never enter my rest ! ” [ a ]
CEB	Hebrews	3	12	Watch out , brothers and sisters , so that none of you have an evil , unfaithful heart that abandons the living God .
CEB	Hebrews	3	13	Instead , encourage each other every day , as long as it ’ s called “ today , ” so that none of you become insensitive to God because of sin ’ s deception .
CEB	Hebrews	3	14	We are partners with Christ , but only if we hold on to the confidence we had in the beginning until the end .
CEB	Hebrews	3	15	When it says , Today , if you hear his voice , don ’ t have stubborn hearts as they did in the rebellion . [ b ]
CEB	Hebrews	3	16	Who was it who rebelled when they heard his voice ? Wasn ’ t it all of those who were brought out of Egypt by Moses ?
CEB	Hebrews	3	17	And with whom was God angry for forty years ? Wasn ’ t it with the ones who sinned , whose bodies fell in the desert ?
CEB	Hebrews	3	18	And against whom did he swear that they would never enter his rest , if not against the ones who were disobedient ?
CEB	Hebrews	3	19	We see that they couldn ’ t enter because of their lack of faith .
CEB	Hebrews	4	4	Then somewhere he said this about the seventh day of creation : God rested on the seventh day from all his works . [ b ]
CEB	Hebrews	4	2	We also had the good news preached to us , just as the Israelites did . However , the message they heard didn ’ t help them because they weren ’ t united in faith with the ones who listened to it .
CEB	Hebrews	4	3	We who have faith are entering the rest . As God said , And because of my anger I swore : “ They will never enter into my rest ! ” [ a ] And yet God ’ s works were completed at the foundation of the world .
CEB	Hebrews	4	5	But again , in the passage above , God said , They will never enter my rest ! [ c ]
CEB	Hebrews	4	6	Therefore , it ’ s left open for some to enter it , and the ones who had the good news preached to them before didn ’ t enter because of disobedience .
CEB	Hebrews	4	7	Just as it says in the passage above , God designates a certain day as “ today , ” when he says through David much later , Today , if you hear his voice , don ’ t have stubborn hearts . [ d ]
CEB	Hebrews	4	8	If Joshua gave the Israelites rest , God wouldn ’ t have spoken about another day later on .
CEB	Hebrews	4	9	So you see that a sabbath rest is left open for God ’ s people .
CEB	Hebrews	4	10	The one who entered God ’ s rest also rested from his works , just as God rested from his own . First summary of the message
CEB	Hebrews	4	11	Therefore , let ’ s make every effort to enter that rest so that no one will fall by following the same example of disobedience ,
CEB	Hebrews	4	12	because God ’ s word is living , active , and sharper than any two-edged sword . It penetrates to the point that it separates the soul from the spirit and the joints from the marrow . It ’ s able to judge the heart ’ s thoughts and intentions .
CEB	Hebrews	4	13	No creature is hidden from it , but rather everything is naked and exposed to the eyes of the one to whom we have to give an answer .
CEB	Hebrews	4	14	Also , let ’ s hold on to the confession since we have a great high priest who passed through the heavens , who is Jesus , God ’ s Son ;
CEB	Hebrews	4	15	because we don ’ t have a high priest who can ’ t sympathize with our weaknesses but instead one who was tempted in every way that we are , except without sin .
CEB	Hebrews	4	16	Finally , let ’ s draw near to the throne of favor with confidence so that we can receive mercy and find grace when we need help .
CEB	Hebrews	5	5	In the same way Christ also didn ’ t promote himself to become high priest . Instead , it was the one who said to him , You are my Son . Today I have become your Father ,
CEB	Hebrews	5	2	The high priest is able to deal gently with the ignorant and those who are misled since he himself is prone to weakness .
CEB	Hebrews	5	3	Because of his weakness , he must offer sacrifices for his own sins as well as for the people .
CEB	Hebrews	5	4	No one takes this honor for themselves but takes it only when they are called by God , just like Aaron .
CEB	Hebrews	5	6	as he also says in another place , You are a priest forever , according to the order of Melchizedek . [ a ]
CEB	Hebrews	5	7	During his days on earth , Christ offered prayers and requests with loud cries and tears as his sacrifices to the one who was able to save him from death . He was heard because of his godly devotion .
CEB	Hebrews	5	8	Although he was a Son , he learned obedience from what he suffered .
CEB	Hebrews	5	9	After he had been made perfect , he became the source of eternal salvation for everyone who obeys him .
CEB	Hebrews	5	10	He was appointed by God to be a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek .
CEB	Hebrews	5	11	We have a lot to say about this topic , and it ’ s difficult to explain , because you have been lazy and you haven ’ t been listening .
CEB	Hebrews	5	12	Although you should have been teachers by now , you need someone to teach you an introduction to the basics about God ’ s message . You have come to the place where you need milk instead of solid food .
CEB	Hebrews	5	13	Everyone who lives on milk is not used to the word of righteousness , because they are babies .
CEB	Hebrews	5	14	But solid food is for the mature , whose senses are trained by practice to distinguish between good and evil .
CEB	Hebrews	6	6	They are crucifying God ’ s Son all over again and exposing him to public shame .
CEB	Hebrews	6	2	of teaching about ritual ways to wash with water , laying on of hands , the resurrection from the dead , and eternal judgment—all over again .
CEB	Hebrews	6	3	We ’ re going to press on , if God allows it .
CEB	Hebrews	6	4	Because it ’ s impossible to restore people to changed hearts and lives who turn away once they have seen the light , tasted the heavenly gift , become partners with the Holy Spirit ,
CEB	Hebrews	6	5	and tasted God ’ s good word and the powers of the coming age .
CEB	Hebrews	6	7	The ground receives a blessing from God when it drinks up the rain that regularly comes and falls on it and yields a useful crop for those people for whom it is being farmed .
CEB	Hebrews	6	8	But if it produces thorns and thistles , it ’ s useless and close to being cursed . It ends up being burned . Make your hope sure
CEB	Hebrews	6	9	But we are convinced of better things in your case , brothers and sisters , even though we are talking this way—things that go together with salvation .
CEB	Hebrews	6	10	God isn ’ t unjust so that he forgets your efforts and the love you have shown for his name ’ s sake when you served and continue to serve God ’ s holy people .
CEB	Hebrews	6	11	But we desperately want each of you to show the same effort to make your hope sure until the end .
CEB	Hebrews	6	12	This is so you won ’ t be lazy but follow the example of the ones who inherit the promises through faith and patience . Our hope in Jesus ’ priesthood
CEB	Hebrews	6	13	When God gave Abraham his promise , he swore by himself since he couldn ’ t swear by anyone greater .
CEB	Hebrews	6	14	He said , I will certainly bless you and multiply your descendants . [ a ]
CEB	Hebrews	6	15	So Abraham obtained the promise by showing patience .
CEB	Hebrews	6	16	People pledge by something greater than themselves . A solemn pledge guarantees what they say and shuts down any argument .
CEB	Hebrews	6	17	When God wanted to further demonstrate to the heirs of the promise that his purpose doesn ’ t change , he guaranteed it with a solemn pledge .
CEB	Hebrews	6	18	So these are two things that don ’ t change , because it ’ s impossible for God to lie . He did this so that we , who have taken refuge in him , can be encouraged to grasp the hope that is lying in front of us .
CEB	Hebrews	6	19	This hope , which is a safe and secure anchor for our whole being , enters the sanctuary behind the curtain .
CEB	Hebrews	6	20	That ’ s where Jesus went in advance and entered for us , since he became a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek .
CEB	Hebrews	7	7	Without question , the less important person is blessed by the more important person .
CEB	Hebrews	7	1	This Melchizedek , who was king of Salem and priest of the Most High God , met Abraham as he returned from the defeat of the kings , and Melchizedek blessed him .
CEB	Hebrews	7	2	Abraham gave a tenth of everything to him . His name means first “ king of righteousness , ” and then “ king of Salem , ” that is , “ king of peace. ”
CEB	Hebrews	7	3	He is without father or mother or any family . He has no beginning or end of life , but he ’ s like God ’ s Son and remains a priest for all time . A priest like Melchizedek
CEB	Hebrews	7	4	See how great Melchizedek was ! Abraham , the father of the people , gave him a tenth of everything he captured .
CEB	Hebrews	7	5	The descendants of Levi who receive the office of priest have a commandment under the Law to collect a tenth of everything from the people who are their brothers and sisters , though they also are descended from Abraham .
CEB	Hebrews	7	6	But Melchizedek , who isn ’ t related to them , received a tenth of everything from Abraham and blessed the one who had received the promises .
CEB	Hebrews	7	8	In addition , in one case a tenth is received by people who die , and in the other case , the tenth is received by someone who continues to live , according to the record .
CEB	Hebrews	7	9	It could be said that Levi , who received a tenth , paid a tenth through Abraham
CEB	Hebrews	7	10	because he was still in his ancestor ’ s body when Abraham paid the tenth to Melchizedek .
CEB	Hebrews	7	11	So if perfection came through the levitical office of priest ( for the people received the Law under the priests ) , why was there still a need to speak about raising up another priest according to the order of Melchizedek rather than one according to the order of Aaron ?
CEB	Hebrews	7	12	When the order of the priest changes , there has to be a change in the Law as well .
CEB	Hebrews	7	13	The person we are talking about belongs to another tribe , and no one ever served at the altar from that tribe .
CEB	Hebrews	7	14	It ’ s clear that our Lord came from the tribe of Judah , but Moses never said anything about priests from that tribe .
CEB	Hebrews	7	15	And it ’ s even clearer if another priest appears who is like Melchizedek .
CEB	Hebrews	7	16	He has become a priest by the power of a life that can ’ t be destroyed , rather than a legal requirement about physical descent .
CEB	Hebrews	7	17	This is confirmed : You are a priest forever , according to the order of Melchizedek . [ a ] Able to save completely
CEB	Hebrews	7	18	On the one hand , an earlier command is set aside because it was weak and useless
CEB	Hebrews	7	19	( because the Law made nothing perfect ) . On the other hand , a better hope is introduced , through which we draw near to God .
CEB	Hebrews	7	20	And this was not done without a solemn pledge ! The others have become priests without a solemn pledge ,
CEB	Hebrews	7	21	but this priest was affirmed with a solemn pledge by the one who said , The Lord has made a solemn pledge and will not change his mind : You are a priest forever . [ b ]
CEB	Hebrews	7	22	As a result , Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant .
CEB	Hebrews	7	23	The others who became priests are numerous because death prevented them from continuing to serve .
CEB	Hebrews	7	24	In contrast , he holds the office of priest permanently because he continues to serve forever .
CEB	Hebrews	7	25	This is why he can completely save those who are approaching God through him , because he always lives to speak with God for them .
CEB	Hebrews	7	26	It ’ s appropriate for us to have this kind of high priest : holy , innocent , incorrupt , separate from sinners , and raised high above the heavens .
CEB	Hebrews	7	27	He doesn ’ t need to offer sacrifices every day like the other high priests , first for their own sins and then for the sins of the people . He did this once for all when he offered himself .
CEB	Hebrews	7	28	The Law appoints people who are prone to weakness as high priests , but the content of the solemn pledge , which came after the Law , appointed a Son who has been made perfect forever .
CEB	Hebrews	8	8	But God did find fault with them , since he says , Look , the days are coming , says the Lord , when I will make a covenant with the house of Israel , and I will make a new covenant with the house of Judah .
CEB	Hebrews	8	2	He ’ s serving as a priest in the holy place , which is the true meeting tent that God , not any human being , set up .
CEB	Hebrews	8	3	Every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices . So it ’ s necessary for this high priest also to have something to offer .
CEB	Hebrews	8	4	If he was located on earth , he wouldn ’ t be a priest because there are already others who offer gifts based on the Law .
CEB	Hebrews	8	5	They serve in a place that is a copy and shadow of the heavenly meeting tent . This is indicated when Moses was warned by God when he was about to set up the meeting tent : See that you follow the pattern that I showed you on the mountain in every detail . [ a ]
CEB	Hebrews	8	6	But now , Jesus has received a superior priestly service just as he arranged a better covenant that is enacted with better promises .
CEB	Hebrews	8	7	If the first covenant had been without fault , it wouldn ’ t have made sense to expect a second .
CEB	Hebrews	8	9	It will not be like the covenant that I made with their ancestors on the day I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt , because they did not continue to keep my covenant , and I lost interest in them , says the Lord .
CEB	Hebrews	8	10	This is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days , says the Lord . I will place my laws in their minds , and write them on their hearts . I will be their God , and they will be my people .
CEB	Hebrews	8	11	And each person won ’ t ever teach a neighbor or their brother or sister , saying , “ Know the Lord , ” because they will all know me , from the least important of them to the most important ;
CEB	Hebrews	8	12	because I will be lenient toward their unjust actions , and I won ’ t remember their sins anymore . [ b ]
CEB	Hebrews	8	13	When it says new , it makes the first obsolete . And if something is old and outdated , it ’ s close to disappearing .
CEB	Hebrews	9	9	This is a symbol for the present time . It shows that the gifts and sacrifices that are being offered can ’ t perfect the conscience of the one who is serving .
CEB	Hebrews	9	2	They pitched the first tent called the holy place . It contained the lampstand , the table , and the loaves of bread presented to God .
CEB	Hebrews	9	3	There was a tent behind the second curtain called the holy of holies .
CEB	Hebrews	9	4	It had the gold altar for incense and the chest containing the covenant , which was covered with gold on all sides . In the chest there was a gold jar containing manna , Aaron ’ s rod that budded , and the stone tablets of the covenant .
CEB	Hebrews	9	5	Above the chest there were magnificent winged creatures [ a ] casting their shadow over the seat of the chest , where sin is taken care of . Right now we can ’ t talk about these things in detail .
CEB	Hebrews	9	6	When these things have been prepared in this way , priests enter the first tent all the time as they perform their service .
CEB	Hebrews	9	7	But only the high priest enters the second tent once a year . He never does this without blood , which he offers for himself and for the sins the people committed in ignorance .
CEB	Hebrews	9	8	With this , the Holy Spirit is showing that the way into the holy place hadn ’ t been revealed yet while the first tent was standing .
CEB	Hebrews	9	10	These are superficial regulations that are only about food , drink , and various ritual ways to wash with water . They are regulations that have been imposed until the time of the new order .
CEB	Hebrews	9	11	But Christ has appeared as the high priest of the good things that have happened . He passed through the greater and more perfect meeting tent , which isn ’ t made by human hands ( that is , it ’ s not a part of this world ) .
CEB	Hebrews	9	12	He entered the holy of holies once for all by his own blood , not by the blood of goats or calves , securing our deliverance for all time .
CEB	Hebrews	9	13	If the blood of goats and bulls and the sprinkled ashes of cows made spiritually contaminated people holy and clean ,
CEB	Hebrews	9	14	how much more will the blood of Jesus wash our consciences clean from dead works in order to serve the living God ? He offered himself to God through the eternal Spirit as a sacrifice without any flaw . Christ ’ s death and the new covenant
CEB	Hebrews	9	15	This is why he ’ s the mediator of a new covenant ( which is a will ) : so that those who are called might receive the promise of the eternal inheritance on the basis of his death . His death occurred to set them free from the offenses committed under the first covenant .
CEB	Hebrews	9	16	When there is a will , you need to confirm the death of the one who made the will .
CEB	Hebrews	9	17	This is because a will takes effect only after a death , since it ’ s not in force while the one who made the will is alive .
CEB	Hebrews	9	18	So not even the first covenant was put into effect without blood .
CEB	Hebrews	9	19	Moses took the blood of calves and goats , along with water , scarlet wool , and hyssop , and sprinkled both the Law scroll itself and all the people after he had proclaimed every command of the Law to all the people .
CEB	Hebrews	9	20	While he did it , he said , This is the blood of the covenant that God established for you . [ b ]
CEB	Hebrews	9	21	And in the same way he sprinkled the meeting tent and also all the equipment that would be used in the priests ’ service with blood .
CEB	Hebrews	9	22	Almost everything is cleansed by blood , according to the Law ’ s regulations , and there is no forgiveness without blood being shed .
CEB	Hebrews	9	23	So it was necessary for the copies of the heavenly things to be cleansed with these sacrifices , but the heavenly things had to be cleansed with better sacrifices than these .
CEB	Hebrews	9	24	Christ didn ’ t enter the holy place ( which is a copy of the true holy place ) made by human hands , but into heaven itself , so that he now appears in God ’ s presence for us .
CEB	Hebrews	9	25	He didn ’ t enter to offer himself over and over again , like the high priest enters the earthly holy place every year with blood that isn ’ t his .
CEB	Hebrews	9	26	If that were so , then Jesus would have to suffer many times since the foundation of the world . Instead , he has now appeared once at the end of the ages to get rid of sin by sacrificing himself .
CEB	Hebrews	9	27	People are destined to die once and then face judgment .
CEB	Hebrews	9	28	In the same way , Christ was also offered once to take on himself the sins of many people . He will appear a second time , not to take away sin but to save those who are eagerly waiting for him . Footnotes - Hebrews 9:5 Heb cherubim - Hebrews 9:20 Exod 24:8
CEB	Hebrews	10	10	We have been made holy by God ’ s will through the offering of Jesus Christ ’ s body once for all .
CEB	Hebrews	10	2	Otherwise , wouldn ’ t they have stopped being offered ? If the people carrying out their religious duties had been completely cleansed once , no one would have been aware of sin anymore .
CEB	Hebrews	10	3	Instead , these sacrifices are a reminder of sin every year ,
CEB	Hebrews	10	4	because it ’ s impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins .
CEB	Hebrews	10	5	Therefore , when he comes into the world he says , You didn ’ t want a sacrifice or an offering , but you prepared a body for me ;
CEB	Hebrews	10	6	you weren ’ t pleased with entirely burned offerings or a sin offering .
CEB	Hebrews	10	7	So then I said , “ Look , I ’ ve come to do your will , God . This has been written about me in the scroll. ” [ a ]
CEB	Hebrews	10	8	He says above , You didn ’ t want and you weren ’ t pleased with a sacrifice or an offering or with entirely burned offerings or a purification offering , [ b ] which are offered because the Law requires them .
CEB	Hebrews	10	9	Then he said , Look , I ’ ve come to do your will . [ c ] He puts an end to the first to establish the second .
CEB	Hebrews	10	11	Every priest stands every day serving and offering the same sacrifices over and over , sacrifices that can never take away sins .
CEB	Hebrews	10	12	But when this priest offered one sacrifice for sins for all time , he sat down at the right side of God .
CEB	Hebrews	10	13	Since then , he ’ s waiting until his enemies are made into a footstool for his feet ,
CEB	Hebrews	10	14	because he perfected the people who are being made holy with one offering for all time .
CEB	Hebrews	10	15	The Holy Spirit affirms this when saying ,
CEB	Hebrews	10	16	This is the covenant that I will make with them . After these days , says the Lord , I will place my laws in their hearts and write them on their minds .
CEB	Hebrews	10	17	And I won ’ t remember their sins and their lawless behavior anymore . [ d ]
CEB	Hebrews	10	18	When there is forgiveness for these things , there is no longer an offering for sin . Second summary of the message
CEB	Hebrews	10	19	Brothers and sisters , we have confidence that we can enter the holy of holies by means of Jesus ’ blood ,
CEB	Hebrews	10	20	through a new and living way that he opened up for us through the curtain , which is his body ,
CEB	Hebrews	10	21	and we have a great high priest over God ’ s house .
CEB	Hebrews	10	22	Therefore , let ’ s draw near with a genuine heart with the certainty that our faith gives us , since our hearts are sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies are washed with pure water .
CEB	Hebrews	10	23	Let ’ s hold on to the confession of our hope without wavering , because the one who made the promises is reliable .
CEB	Hebrews	10	24	And let us consider each other carefully for the purpose of sparking love and good deeds .
CEB	Hebrews	10	25	Don ’ t stop meeting together with other believers , which some people have gotten into the habit of doing . Instead , encourage each other , especially as you see the day drawing near . Judgment for intentional sin
CEB	Hebrews	10	26	If we make the decision to sin after we receive the knowledge of the truth , there isn ’ t a sacrifice for sins left any longer .
CEB	Hebrews	10	27	There ’ s only a scary expectation of judgment and of a burning fire that ’ s going to devour God ’ s opponents .
CEB	Hebrews	10	28	When someone rejected the Law from Moses , they were put to death without mercy on the basis of the testimony of two or three witnesses .
CEB	Hebrews	10	29	How much worse punishment do you think is deserved by the person who walks all over God ’ s Son , who acts as if the blood of the covenant that made us holy is just ordinary blood , and who insults the Spirit of grace ?
CEB	Hebrews	10	30	We know the one who said , Judgment is mine ; I will pay people back . [ e ] And he also said , The Lord will judge his people . [ f ]
CEB	Hebrews	10	31	It ’ s scary to fall into the hands of the living God ! Confidence and faith to endure
CEB	Hebrews	10	32	But remember the earlier days , after you saw the light . You stood your ground while you were suffering from an enormous amount of pressure .
CEB	Hebrews	10	33	Sometimes you were exposed to insults and abuse in public . Other times you became partners with those who were treated that way .
CEB	Hebrews	10	34	You even showed sympathy toward people in prison and accepted the confiscation of your possessions with joy , since you knew that you had better and lasting possessions .
CEB	Hebrews	10	35	So don ’ t throw away your confidence—it brings a great reward .
CEB	Hebrews	10	36	You need to endure so that you can receive the promises after you do God ’ s will .
CEB	Hebrews	10	37	In a little while longer , the one who is coming will come and won ’ t delay ;
CEB	Hebrews	10	38	but my righteous one will live by faith , and my whole being won ’ t be pleased with anyone who shrinks back . [ g ]
CEB	Hebrews	10	39	But we aren ’ t the sort of people who timidly draw back and end up being destroyed . We ’ re the sort of people who have faith so that our whole beings are preserved .
CEB	Hebrews	11	11	By faith even Sarah received the ability to have a child , though she herself was barren and past the age for having children , because she believed that the one who promised was faithful .
CEB	Hebrews	11	2	The elders in the past were approved because they showed faith . Acts of faith by God ’ s people
CEB	Hebrews	11	3	By faith we understand that the universe has been created by a word from God so that the visible came into existence from the invisible .
CEB	Hebrews	11	4	By faith Abel offered a better sacrifice to God than Cain , which showed that he was righteous , since God gave approval to him for his gift . Though he died , he ’ s still speaking through faith .
CEB	Hebrews	11	5	By faith Enoch was taken up so that he didn ’ t see death , and he wasn ’ t found because God took him up . [ a ] He was given approval for having pleased God before he was taken up .
CEB	Hebrews	11	6	It ’ s impossible to please God without faith because the one who draws near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards people who try to find him .
CEB	Hebrews	11	7	By faith Noah responded with godly fear when he was warned about events he hadn ’ t seen yet . He built an ark to deliver his household . With his faith , he criticized the world and became an heir of the righteousness that comes from faith .
CEB	Hebrews	11	8	By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place that he was going to receive as an inheritance . He went out without knowing where he was going .
CEB	Hebrews	11	9	By faith he lived in the land he had been promised as a stranger . He lived in tents along with Isaac and Jacob , who were coheirs of the same promise .
CEB	Hebrews	11	10	He was looking forward to a city that has foundations , whose architect and builder is God .
CEB	Hebrews	11	12	So descendants were born from one man ( and he was as good as dead ) . They were as many as the number of the stars in the sky and as countless as the grains of sand on the seashore .
CEB	Hebrews	11	13	All these people died in faith without receiving the promises , but they saw the promises from a distance and welcomed them . They confessed that they were strangers and immigrants on earth .
CEB	Hebrews	11	14	People who say this kind of thing make it clear that they are looking for a homeland .
CEB	Hebrews	11	15	If they had been thinking about the country that they had left , they would have had the opportunity to return to it .
CEB	Hebrews	11	16	But at this point in time , they are longing for a better country , that is , a heavenly one . Therefore , God isn ’ t ashamed to be called their God—he has prepared a city for them .
CEB	Hebrews	11	17	By faith Abraham offered Isaac when he was tested . The one who received the promises was offering his only son .
CEB	Hebrews	11	18	He had been told concerning him , Your legitimate descendants will come from Isaac . [ b ]
CEB	Hebrews	11	19	He figured that God could even raise him from the dead . So in a way he did receive him back from the dead .
CEB	Hebrews	11	20	By faith Isaac also blessed Jacob and Esau concerning their future .
CEB	Hebrews	11	21	By faith Jacob blessed each of Joseph ’ s sons as he was dying and bowed in worship over the head of his staff . [ c ]
CEB	Hebrews	11	22	By faith Joseph recalled the exodus of the Israelites at the end of his life , and gave instructions about burying his bones .
CEB	Hebrews	11	23	By faith Moses was hidden by his parents for three months when he was born , because they saw that the child was beautiful and they weren ’ t afraid of the king ’ s orders .
CEB	Hebrews	11	24	By faith Moses refused to be called the son of Pharaoh ’ s daughter when he was grown up .
CEB	Hebrews	11	25	He chose to be mistreated with God ’ s people instead of having the temporary pleasures of sin .
CEB	Hebrews	11	26	He thought that the abuses he suffered for Christ were more valuable than the treasures of Egypt , since he was looking forward to the reward .
CEB	Hebrews	11	27	By faith he left Egypt without being afraid of the king ’ s anger . He kept on going as if he could see what is invisible .
CEB	Hebrews	11	28	By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of blood , in order that the destroyer could not touch their firstborn children .
CEB	Hebrews	11	29	By faith they crossed the Red Sea as if they were on dry land , but when the Egyptians tried it , they were drowned .
CEB	Hebrews	11	30	By faith Jericho ’ s walls fell after the people marched around them for seven days .
CEB	Hebrews	11	31	By faith Rahab the prostitute wasn ’ t killed with the disobedient because she welcomed the spies in peace .
CEB	Hebrews	11	32	What more can I say ? I would run out of time if I told you about Gideon , Barak , Samson , Jephthah , David , Samuel , and the prophets .
CEB	Hebrews	11	33	Through faith they conquered kingdoms , brought about justice , realized promises , shut the mouths of lions ,
CEB	Hebrews	11	34	put out raging fires , escaped from the edge of the sword , found strength in weakness , were mighty in war , and routed foreign armies .
CEB	Hebrews	11	35	Women received back their dead by resurrection . Others were tortured and refused to be released so they could gain a better resurrection .
CEB	Hebrews	11	36	But others experienced public shame by being taunted and whipped ; they were even put in chains and in prison .
CEB	Hebrews	11	37	They were stoned to death , they were cut in two , and they died by being murdered with swords . They went around wearing the skins of sheep and goats , needy , oppressed , and mistreated .
CEB	Hebrews	11	38	The world didn ’ t deserve them . They wandered around in deserts , mountains , caves , and holes in the ground .
CEB	Hebrews	11	39	All these people didn ’ t receive what was promised , though they were given approval for their faith .
CEB	Hebrews	11	40	God provided something better for us so they wouldn ’ t be made perfect without us .
CEB	Hebrews	12	12	So strengthen your drooping hands and weak knees !
CEB	Hebrews	12	2	and fix our eyes on Jesus , faith ’ s pioneer and perfecter . He endured the cross , ignoring the shame , for the sake of the joy that was laid out in front of him , and sat down at the right side of God ’ s throne . Run the race with discipline
CEB	Hebrews	12	3	Think about the one who endured such opposition from sinners so that you won ’ t be discouraged and you won ’ t give up .
CEB	Hebrews	12	4	In your struggle against sin , you haven ’ t resisted yet to the point of shedding blood ,
CEB	Hebrews	12	5	and you have forgotten the encouragement that addresses you as sons and daughters : My child , don ’ t make light of the Lord ’ s discipline or give up when you are corrected by him ,
CEB	Hebrews	12	6	because the Lord disciplines whomever he loves , and he punishes every son or daughter whom he accepts . [ a ]
CEB	Hebrews	12	7	Bear hardship for the sake of discipline . God is treating you like sons and daughters ! What child isn ’ t disciplined by his or her father ?
CEB	Hebrews	12	8	But if you don ’ t experience discipline , which happens to all children , then you are illegitimate and not real sons and daughters .
CEB	Hebrews	12	9	What ’ s more , we had human parents who disciplined us , and we respected them for it . How much more should we submit to the Father of spirits and live ?
CEB	Hebrews	12	10	Our human parents disciplined us for a little while , as it seemed best to them , but God does it for our benefit so that we can share his holiness .
CEB	Hebrews	12	11	No discipline is fun while it lasts , but it seems painful at the time . Later , however , it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness for those who have been trained by it .
CEB	Hebrews	12	13	Make straight paths for your feet so that if any part is lame , it will be healed rather than injured more seriously .
CEB	Hebrews	12	14	Pursue the goal of peace along with everyone—and holiness as well , because no one will see the Lord without it .
CEB	Hebrews	12	15	Make sure that no one misses out on God ’ s grace . Make sure that no root of bitterness grows up that might cause trouble and pollute many people .
CEB	Hebrews	12	16	Make sure that no one becomes sexually immoral or ungodly like Esau . He sold his inheritance as the oldest son for one meal .
CEB	Hebrews	12	17	You know that afterward , when he wanted to inherit the blessing , he was rejected because he couldn ’ t find a way to change his heart and life , though he looked for it with tears . Priestly service in heavenly Jerusalem
CEB	Hebrews	12	18	You haven ’ t drawn near to something that can be touched : a burning fire , darkness , shadow , a whirlwind ,
CEB	Hebrews	12	19	a blast of a trumpet , and a sound of words that made the ones who heard it beg that there wouldn ’ t be one more word .
CEB	Hebrews	12	20	They couldn ’ t stand the command , If even a wild animal touches the mountain , it must be stoned . [ b ]
CEB	Hebrews	12	21	The sight was so frightening that Moses said , “ I ’ m terrified and shaking ! ”
CEB	Hebrews	12	22	But you have drawn near to Mount Zion , the city of the living God , heavenly Jerusalem , to countless angels in a festival gathering ,
CEB	Hebrews	12	23	to the assembly of God ’ s firstborn children who are registered in heaven , to God the judge of all , to the spirits of the righteous who have been made perfect ,
CEB	Hebrews	12	24	to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant , and to the sprinkled blood that speaks better than Abel ’ s blood .
CEB	Hebrews	12	25	See to it that you don ’ t resist the one who is speaking . If the people didn ’ t escape when they refused to listen to the one who warned them on earth , how will we escape if we reject the one who is warning from heaven ?
CEB	Hebrews	12	26	His voice shook the earth then , but now he has made a promise : Still once more I will shake not only the earth but heaven also . [ c ]
CEB	Hebrews	12	27	The words “ still once more ” reveal the removal of what is shaken—the things that are part of this creation—so that what isn ’ t shaken will remain .
CEB	Hebrews	12	28	Therefore , since we are receiving a kingdom that can ’ t be shaken , let ’ s continue to express our gratitude . [ d ] With this gratitude , let ’ s serve [ e ] in a way that is pleasing to God with respect and awe ,
CEB	Hebrews	12	29	because our God really is a consuming fire . Footnotes - Hebrews 12:6 Prov 3:11-12 - Hebrews 12:20 Exod 19:12-13 - Hebrews 12:26 Exod 19:18 - Hebrews 12:28 Or hold on to grace - Hebrews 12:28 Or offer priestly service
CEB	Hebrews	13	13	So now , let ’ s go to him outside the camp , bearing his shame .
CEB	Hebrews	13	2	Don ’ t neglect to open up your homes to guests , because by doing this some have been hosts to angels without knowing it .
CEB	Hebrews	13	3	Remember prisoners as if you were in prison with them , and people who are mistreated as if you were in their place .
CEB	Hebrews	13	4	Marriage must be honored in every respect , with no cheating on the relationship , because God will judge the sexually immoral person and the person who commits adultery .
CEB	Hebrews	13	5	Your way of life should be free from the love of money , and you should be content with what you have . After all , he has said , I will never leave you or abandon you . [ a ]
CEB	Hebrews	13	6	This is why we can confidently say , The Lord is my helper , and I won ’ t be afraid . What can people do to me ? [ b ]
CEB	Hebrews	13	7	Remember your leaders who spoke God ’ s word to you . Imitate their faith as you consider the way their lives turned out .
CEB	Hebrews	13	8	Jesus Christ is the same yesterday , today , and forever !
CEB	Hebrews	13	9	Don ’ t be misled by the many strange teachings out there . It ’ s a good thing for the heart to be strengthened by grace rather than by food . Food doesn ’ t help those who live in this context .
CEB	Hebrews	13	10	We have an altar , and those who serve as priests in the meeting tent don ’ t have the right to eat from it .
CEB	Hebrews	13	11	The blood of the animals is carried into the holy of holies by the high priest as an offering for sin , and their bodies are burned outside the camp .
CEB	Hebrews	13	12	And so Jesus also suffered outside the city gate to make the people holy with his own blood .
CEB	Hebrews	13	14	We don ’ t have a permanent city here , but rather we are looking for the city that is still to come .
CEB	Hebrews	13	15	So let ’ s continually offer up a sacrifice of praise through him , which is the fruit from our lips that confess his name .
CEB	Hebrews	13	16	Don ’ t forget to do good and to share what you have because God is pleased with these kinds of sacrifices . Closing greeting and blessing
CEB	Hebrews	13	17	Rely on your leaders and defer to them , because they watch over your whole being as people who are going to be held responsible for you . They need to be able to do this with pleasure and not with complaints about you , because that wouldn ’ t help you .
CEB	Hebrews	13	18	Pray for us . We ’ re sure that we have a good conscience , and we want to do the right thing in every way .
CEB	Hebrews	13	19	I ’ m particularly asking you to do this so that I can be returned to you quickly .
CEB	Hebrews	13	20	May the God of peace , who brought back the great shepherd of the sheep , our Lord Jesus , from the dead by the blood of the eternal covenant ,
CEB	Hebrews	13	21	equip you with every good thing to do his will , by developing in us what pleases him through Jesus Christ . To him be the glory forever and always . Amen .
CEB	Hebrews	13	22	I urge you , brothers and sisters , to put up with this message of encouragement , since I ’ ve only written a short letter to you !
CEB	Hebrews	13	23	You should know that our brother Timothy has been set free . If he comes soon , we will travel together to see you .
CEB	Hebrews	13	24	Greet your leaders and all of God ’ s holy people . The group from Italy greets you .
CEB	Hebrews	13	25	May grace be with all of you .
CEB	James	1	1	From James , a slave of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ . To the twelve tribes who are scattered outside the land of Israel . Greetings ! Stand firm
CEB	James	1	2	My brothers and sisters , think of the various tests you encounter as occasions for joy .
CEB	James	1	3	After all , you know that the testing of your faith produces endurance .
CEB	James	1	4	Let this endurance complete its work so that you may be fully mature , complete , and lacking in nothing .
CEB	James	1	5	But anyone who needs wisdom should ask God , whose very nature is to give to everyone without a second thought , without keeping score . Wisdom will certainly be given to those who ask .
CEB	James	1	6	Whoever asks shouldn ’ t hesitate . They should ask in faith , without doubting . Whoever doubts is like the surf of the sea , tossed and turned by the wind .
CEB	James	1	7	People like that should never imagine that they will receive anything from the Lord .
CEB	James	1	8	They are double-minded , unstable in all their ways .
CEB	James	1	9	Brothers and sisters who are poor should find satisfaction in their high status .
CEB	James	1	10	Those who are wealthy should find satisfaction in their low status , because they will die off like wildflowers .
CEB	James	1	11	The sun rises with its scorching heat and dries up the grass so that its flowers fall and its beauty is lost . Just like that , in the midst of their daily lives , the wealthy will waste away .
CEB	James	1	12	Those who stand firm during testing are blessed . They are tried and true . They will receive the life God has promised to those who love him as their reward . Our cravings versus God ’ s gifts
CEB	James	1	13	No one who is tested should say , “ God is tempting me ! ” This is because God is not tempted by any form of evil , nor does he tempt anyone .
CEB	James	1	14	Everyone is tempted by their own cravings ; they are lured away and enticed by them .
CEB	James	1	15	Once those cravings conceive , they give birth to sin ; and when sin grows up , it gives birth to death .
CEB	James	1	16	Don ’ t be misled , my dear brothers and sisters .
CEB	James	1	17	Every good gift , every perfect gift , comes from above . These gifts come down from the Father , the creator of the heavenly lights , in whose character there is no change at all .
CEB	James	1	18	He chose to give us birth by his true word , and here is the result : we are like the first crop from the harvest of everything he created . Welcoming and doing the word
CEB	James	1	19	Know this , my dear brothers and sisters : everyone should be quick to listen , slow to speak , and slow to grow angry .
CEB	James	1	20	This is because an angry person doesn ’ t produce God ’ s righteousness .
CEB	James	1	21	Therefore , with humility , set aside all moral filth and the growth of wickedness , and welcome the word planted deep inside you—the very word that is able to save you .
CEB	James	1	22	You must be doers of the word and not only hearers who mislead themselves .
CEB	James	1	23	Those who hear but don ’ t do the word are like those who look at their faces in a mirror .
CEB	James	1	24	They look at themselves , walk away , and immediately forget what they were like .
CEB	James	1	25	But there are those who study the perfect law , the law of freedom , and continue to do it . They don ’ t listen and then forget , but they put it into practice in their lives . They will be blessed in whatever they do .
CEB	James	1	26	If those who claim devotion to God don ’ t control what they say , they mislead themselves . Their devotion is worthless .
CEB	James	1	27	True devotion , the kind that is pure and faultless before God the Father , is this : to care for orphans and widows in their difficulties and to keep the world from contaminating us .
CEB	James	2	2	Imagine two people coming into your meeting . One has a gold ring and fine clothes , while the other is poor , dressed in filthy rags .
CEB	James	2	3	Then suppose that you were to take special notice of the one wearing fine clothes , saying , “ Here ’ s an excellent place . Sit here. ” But to the poor person you say , “ Stand over there ” ; or , “ Here , sit at my feet. ”
CEB	James	2	4	Wouldn ’ t you have shown favoritism among yourselves and become evil-minded judges ?
CEB	James	2	5	My dear brothers and sisters , listen ! Hasn ’ t God chosen those who are poor by worldly standards to be rich in terms of faith ? Hasn ’ t God chosen the poor as heirs of the kingdom he has promised to those who love him ?
CEB	James	2	6	But you have dishonored the poor . Don ’ t the wealthy make life difficult for you ? Aren ’ t they the ones who drag you into court ?
CEB	James	2	7	Aren ’ t they the ones who insult the good name spoken over you at your baptism ?
CEB	James	2	8	You do well when you really fulfill the royal law found in scripture , Love your neighbor as yourself . [ a ]
CEB	James	2	9	But when you show favoritism , you are committing a sin , and by that same law you are exposed as a lawbreaker .
CEB	James	2	10	Anyone who tries to keep all of the Law but fails at one point is guilty of failing to keep all of it .
CEB	James	2	11	The one who said , Don ’ t commit adultery , also said , Don ’ t commit murder . [ b ] So if you don ’ t commit adultery but do commit murder , you are a lawbreaker .
CEB	James	2	12	In every way , then , speak and act as people who will be judged by the law of freedom .
CEB	James	2	13	There will be no mercy in judgment for anyone who hasn ’ t shown mercy . Mercy overrules judgment . Showing faith
CEB	James	2	14	My brothers and sisters , what good is it if people say they have faith but do nothing to show it ? Claiming to have faith can ’ t save anyone , can it ?
CEB	James	2	15	LXX ( English : 20:13-14 ) ; Deut 5:17–18 - James 2:23 Gen 15:6
CEB	James	2	16	What if one of you said , “ Go in peace ! Stay warm ! Have a nice meal ! ” ? What good is it if you don ’ t actually give them what their body needs ?
CEB	James	2	17	In the same way , faith is dead when it doesn ’ t result in faithful activity .
CEB	James	2	18	Someone might claim , “ You have faith and I have action. ” But how can I see your faith apart from your actions ? Instead , I ’ ll show you my faith by putting it into practice in faithful action .
CEB	James	2	19	It ’ s good that you believe that God is one . Ha ! Even the demons believe this , and they tremble with fear .
CEB	James	2	20	Are you so slow ? Do you need to be shown that faith without actions has no value at all ?
CEB	James	2	21	What about Abraham , our father ? Wasn ’ t he shown to be righteous through his actions when he offered his son Isaac on the altar ?
CEB	James	2	22	See , his faith was at work along with his actions . In fact , his faith was made complete by his faithful actions .
CEB	James	2	23	So the scripture was fulfilled that says , Abraham believed God , and God regarded him as righteous . [ c ] What is more , Abraham was called God ’ s friend .
CEB	James	2	24	So you see that a person is shown to be righteous through faithful actions and not through faith alone .
CEB	James	2	25	In the same way , wasn ’ t Rahab the prostitute shown to be righteous when she received the messengers as her guests and then sent them on by another road ?
CEB	James	2	26	As the lifeless body is dead , so faith without actions is dead . Footnotes - James 2:8 Lev 19:18 - James 2:11 Exod 20:13 ,
CEB	James	3	3	When we bridle horses and put bits in their mouths to lead them wherever we want , we can control their whole bodies .
CEB	James	3	2	We all make mistakes often , but those who don ’ t make mistakes with their words have reached full maturity . Like a bridled horse , they can control themselves entirely .
CEB	James	3	4	Consider ships : They are so large that strong winds are needed to drive them . But pilots direct their ships wherever they want with a little rudder .
CEB	James	3	5	In the same way , even though the tongue is a small part of the body , it boasts wildly . Think about this : A small flame can set a whole forest on fire .
CEB	James	3	6	The tongue is a small flame of fire , a world of evil at work in us . It contaminates our entire lives . Because of it , the circle of life is set on fire . The tongue itself is set on fire by the flames of hell .
CEB	James	3	7	People can tame and already have tamed every kind of animal , bird , reptile , and fish .
CEB	James	3	8	No one can tame the tongue , though . It is a restless evil , full of deadly poison .
CEB	James	3	9	With it we both bless the Lord and Father and curse human beings made in God ’ s likeness .
CEB	James	3	10	Blessing and cursing come from the same mouth . My brothers and sisters , it just shouldn ’ t be this way !
CEB	James	3	11	Both fresh water and salt water don ’ t come from the same spring , do they ?
CEB	James	3	12	My brothers and sisters , can a fig tree produce olives ? Can a grapevine produce figs ? Of course not , and fresh water doesn ’ t flow from a saltwater spring either . Wisdom from above
CEB	James	3	13	Are any of you wise and understanding ? Show that your actions are good with a humble lifestyle that comes from wisdom .
CEB	James	3	14	However , if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart , then stop bragging and living in ways that deny the truth .
CEB	James	3	15	This is not the wisdom that comes down from above . Instead , it is from the earth , natural and demonic .
CEB	James	3	16	Wherever there is jealousy and selfish ambition , there is disorder and everything that is evil .
CEB	James	3	17	What of the wisdom from above ? First , it is pure , and then peaceful , gentle , obedient , filled with mercy and good actions , fair , and genuine .
CEB	James	3	18	Those who make peace sow the seeds of justice by their peaceful acts .
CEB	James	4	4	You unfaithful people ! Don ’ t you know that friendship with the world means hostility toward God ? So whoever wants to be the world 's friend becomes God 's enemy .
CEB	James	4	2	You long for something you don ’ t have , so you commit murder . You are jealous for something you can ’ t get , so you struggle and fight . You don ’ t have because you don ’ t ask .
CEB	James	4	3	You ask and don ’ t have because you ask with evil intentions , to waste it on your own cravings .
CEB	James	4	5	Or do you suppose that scripture is meaningless ? Doesn ’ t God long for our faithfulness in [ a ] the life he has given to us ? [ b ]
CEB	James	4	6	But he gives us more grace . This is why it says , God stands against the proud , but favors the humble . [ c ]
CEB	James	4	7	Therefore , submit to God . Resist the devil , and he will run away from you .
CEB	James	4	8	Come near to God , and he will come near to you . Wash your hands , you sinners . Purify your hearts , you double-minded .
CEB	James	4	9	Cry out in sorrow , mourn , and weep ! Let your laughter become mourning and your joy become sadness .
CEB	James	4	10	Humble yourselves before the Lord , and he will lift you up .
CEB	James	4	11	Brothers and sisters , don ’ t say evil things about each other . Whoever insults or criticizes a brother or sister insults and criticizes the Law . If you find fault with the Law , you are not a doer of the Law but a judge over it .
CEB	James	4	12	There is only one lawgiver and judge , and he is able to save and to destroy . But you who judge your neighbor , who are you ? Warning the proud and wealthy
CEB	James	4	13	Pay attention , you who say , “ Today or tomorrow we will go to such-and-such a town . We will stay there a year , buying and selling , and making a profit. ”
CEB	James	4	14	You don ’ t really know about tomorrow . What is your life ? You are a mist that appears for only a short while before it vanishes .
CEB	James	4	15	Here ’ s what you ought to say : “ If the Lord wills , we will live and do this or that. ”
CEB	James	4	16	But now you boast and brag , and all such boasting is evil .
CEB	James	4	17	It is a sin when someone knows the right thing to do and doesn ’ t do it .
CEB	James	5	5	You have lived a self-satisfying life on this earth , a life of luxury . You have stuffed your hearts in preparation for the day of slaughter .
CEB	James	5	2	Your riches have rotted . Moths have destroyed your clothes .
CEB	James	5	3	Your gold and silver have rusted , and their rust will be evidence against you . It will eat your flesh like fire . Consider the treasure you have hoarded in the last days .
CEB	James	5	4	Listen ! Hear the cries of the wages of your field hands . These are the wages you stole from those who harvested your fields . The cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord of heavenly forces .
CEB	James	5	6	You have condemned and murdered the righteous one , who doesn ’ t oppose you . Courageous patience
CEB	James	5	7	Therefore , brothers and sisters , you must be patient as you wait for the coming of the Lord . Consider the farmer who waits patiently for the coming of rain in the fall and spring , looking forward to the precious fruit of the earth .
CEB	James	5	8	You also must wait patiently , strengthening your resolve , because the coming of the Lord is near .
CEB	James	5	9	Don ’ t complain about each other , brothers and sisters , so that you won ’ t be judged . Look ! The judge is standing at the door !
CEB	James	5	10	Brothers and sisters , take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord as an example of patient resolve and steadfastness .
CEB	James	5	11	Look at how we honor those who have practiced endurance . You have heard of the endurance of Job . And you have seen what the Lord has accomplished , for the Lord is full of compassion and mercy . Final instructions
CEB	James	5	12	Most important , my brothers and sisters , never make a solemn pledge—neither by heaven nor earth , nor by anything else . Instead , speak with a simple “ Yes ” or “ No , ” or else you may fall under judgment .
CEB	James	5	13	If any of you are suffering , they should pray . If any of you are happy , they should sing .
CEB	James	5	14	If any of you are sick , they should call for the elders of the church , and the elders should pray over them , anointing them with oil in the name of the Lord .
CEB	James	5	15	Prayer that comes from faith will heal the sick , for the Lord will restore them to health . And if they have sinned , they will be forgiven .
CEB	James	5	16	For this reason , confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed . The prayer of the righteous person is powerful in what it can achieve .
CEB	James	5	17	Elijah was a person just like us . When he earnestly prayed that it wouldn ’ t rain , no rain fell for three and a half years .
CEB	James	5	18	He prayed again , God sent rain , and the earth produced its fruit .
CEB	James	5	19	My brothers and sisters , if any of you wander from the truth and someone turns back the wanderer ,
CEB	James	5	20	recognize that whoever brings a sinner back from the wrong path will save them from death and will bring about the forgiveness of many sins .
CEB	1%20Peter	1	1	Peter , an apostle of Jesus Christ , To God ’ s chosen strangers in the world of the diaspora , who live in Pontus , Galatia , Cappadocia , Asia , and Bithynia .
CEB	1%20Peter	1	2	God the Father chose you because of what he knew beforehand . He chose you through the Holy Spirit ’ s work of making you holy and because of the faithful obedience and sacrifice of Jesus Christ . May God ’ s grace and peace be multiplied to you . Thanksgiving
CEB	1%20Peter	1	3	May the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ be blessed ! On account of his vast mercy , he has given us new birth . You have been born anew into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead .
CEB	1%20Peter	1	4	You have a pure and enduring inheritance that can not perish—an inheritance that is presently kept safe in heaven for you .
CEB	1%20Peter	1	5	Through his faithfulness , you are guarded by God ’ s power so that you can receive the salvation he is ready to reveal in the last time .
CEB	1%20Peter	1	6	You now rejoice in this hope , even if it ’ s necessary for you to be distressed for a short time by various trials .
CEB	1%20Peter	1	7	This is necessary so that your faith may be found genuine . ( Your faith is more valuable than gold , which will be destroyed even though it is itself tested by fire . ) Your genuine faith will result in praise , glory , and honor for you when Jesus Christ is revealed .
CEB	1%20Peter	1	8	Although you ’ ve never seen him , you love him . Even though you don ’ t see him now , you trust him and so rejoice with a glorious joy that is too much for words .
CEB	1%20Peter	1	9	You are receiving the goal of your faith : your salvation .
CEB	1%20Peter	1	10	The prophets , who long ago foretold the grace that you ’ ve received , searched and explored , inquiring carefully about this salvation .
CEB	1%20Peter	1	11	They wondered what the Spirit of Christ within them was saying when he bore witness beforehand about the suffering that would happen to Christ and the glory that would follow . They wondered what sort of person or what sort of time they were speaking about .
CEB	1%20Peter	1	12	It was revealed to them that in their search they were not serving themselves but you . These things , which even angels long to examine , have now been proclaimed to you by those who brought you the good news . They did this in the power of the Holy Spirit , who was sent from heaven . Response of obedience
CEB	1%20Peter	1	13	Therefore , once you have your minds ready for action and you are thinking clearly , place your hope completely on the grace that will be brought to you when Jesus Christ is revealed .
CEB	1%20Peter	1	14	Don ’ t be conformed to your former desires , those that shaped you when you were ignorant . But , as obedient children ,
CEB	1%20Peter	1	15	you must be holy in every aspect of your lives , just as the one who called you is holy .
CEB	1%20Peter	1	16	It is written , You will be holy , because I am holy . [ a ]
CEB	1%20Peter	1	17	Since you call upon a Father who judges all people according to their actions without favoritism , you should conduct yourselves with reverence during the time of your dwelling in a strange land .
CEB	1%20Peter	1	18	Live in this way , knowing that you were not liberated by perishable things like silver or gold from the empty lifestyle you inherited from your ancestors .
CEB	1%20Peter	1	19	Instead , you were liberated by the precious blood of Christ , like that of a flawless , spotless lamb .
CEB	1%20Peter	1	20	Christ was chosen before the creation of the world , but was only revealed at the end of time . This was done for you ,
CEB	1%20Peter	1	21	who through Christ are faithful to the God who raised him from the dead and gave him glory . So now , your faith and hope should rest in God .
CEB	1%20Peter	1	22	As you set yourselves apart by your obedience to the truth so that you might have genuine affection for your fellow believers , love each other deeply and earnestly .
CEB	1%20Peter	1	23	Do this because you have been given new birth—not from the type of seed that decays but from seed that doesn ’ t . This seed is God ’ s life-giving and enduring word .
CEB	1%20Peter	1	24	Thus , All human life on the earth is like grass , and all human glory is like a flower in a field . The grass dries up and its flower falls off ,
CEB	1%20Peter	1	25	but the Lord ’ s word endures forever . [ b ] This is the word that was proclaimed to you as good news .
CEB	1%20Peter	2	1	Peter
CEB	1%20Peter	2	2	Instead , like a newborn baby , desire the pure milk of the word . Nourished by it , you will grow into salvation ,
CEB	1%20Peter	2	3	since you have tasted that the Lord is good .
CEB	1%20Peter	2	4	Now you are coming to him as to a living stone . Even though this stone was rejected by humans , from God ’ s perspective it is chosen , valuable .
CEB	1%20Peter	2	5	You yourselves are being built like living stones into a spiritual temple . You are being made into a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices that are acceptable to God through Jesus Christ .
CEB	1%20Peter	2	6	Thus it is written in scripture , Look ! I am laying a cornerstone in Zion , chosen , valuable . The person who believes in him will never be shamed . [ a ]
CEB	1%20Peter	2	7	So God honors you who believe . For those who refuse to believe , though , the stone the builders tossed aside has become the capstone .
CEB	1%20Peter	2	8	This is a stone that makes people stumble and a rock that makes them fall . Because they refuse to believe in the word , they stumble . Indeed , this is the end to which they were appointed .
CEB	1%20Peter	2	9	But you are a chosen race , a royal priesthood , a holy nation , a people who are God ’ s own possession . You have become this people so that you may speak of the wonderful acts of the one who called you out of darkness into his amazing light .
CEB	1%20Peter	2	10	Once you weren ’ t a people , but now you are God ’ s people . Once you hadn ’ t received mercy , but now you have received mercy . Life as strangers in the world
CEB	1%20Peter	2	11	Dear friends , since you are immigrants and strangers in the world , I urge that you avoid worldly desires that wage war against your lives .
CEB	1%20Peter	2	12	Live honorably among the unbelievers . Today , they defame you , as if you were doing evil . But in the day when God visits to judge they will glorify him , because they have observed your honorable deeds .
CEB	1%20Peter	2	13	For the sake of the Lord submit to every human institution . Do this whether it means submitting to the emperor as supreme ruler ,
CEB	1%20Peter	2	14	or to governors as those sent by the emperor . They are sent to punish those doing evil and to praise those doing good .
CEB	1%20Peter	2	15	Submit to them because it ’ s God ’ s will that by doing good you will silence the ignorant talk of foolish people .
CEB	1%20Peter	2	16	Do this as God ’ s slaves , and yet also as free people , not using your freedom as a cover-up for evil .
CEB	1%20Peter	2	17	Honor everyone . Love the family of believers . Have respectful fear of God . Honor the emperor .
CEB	1%20Peter	2	18	Household slaves , submit by accepting the authority of your masters with all respect . Do this not only to good and kind masters but also to those who are harsh .
CEB	1%20Peter	2	19	Now , it is commendable if , because of one ’ s understanding of God , someone should endure pain through suffering unjustly .
CEB	1%20Peter	2	20	But what praise comes from enduring patiently when you have sinned and are beaten for it ? But if you endure steadfastly when you ’ ve done good and suffer for it , this is commendable before God .
CEB	1%20Peter	2	21	You were called to this kind of endurance , because Christ suffered on your behalf . He left you an example so that you might follow in his footsteps .
CEB	1%20Peter	2	22	He committed no sin , nor did he ever speak in ways meant to deceive .
CEB	1%20Peter	2	23	When he was insulted , he did not reply with insults . When he suffered , he did not threaten revenge . Instead , he entrusted himself to the one who judges justly .
CEB	1%20Peter	2	24	He carried in his own body on the cross the sins we committed . He did this so that we might live in righteousness , having nothing to do with sin . By his wounds you were healed .
CEB	1%20Peter	2	25	Though you were like straying sheep , you have now returned to the shepherd and guardian of your lives .
CEB	1%20Peter	3	1	Peter
CEB	1%20Peter	3	3	Don ’ t try to make yourselves beautiful on the outside , with stylish hair or by wearing gold jewelry or fine clothes .
CEB	1%20Peter	3	2	After all , they will have observed the reverent and holy manner of your lives .
CEB	1%20Peter	3	4	Instead , make yourselves beautiful on the inside , in your hearts , with the enduring quality of a gentle , peaceful spirit . This type of beauty is very precious in God ’ s eyes .
CEB	1%20Peter	3	5	For it was in this way that holy women who trusted in God used to make themselves beautiful , accepting the authority of their own husbands .
CEB	1%20Peter	3	6	For example , Sarah accepted Abraham ’ s authority when she called him master . You have become her children when you do good and don ’ t respond to threats with fear .
CEB	1%20Peter	3	7	Husbands , likewise , submit by living with your wife in ways that honor her , knowing that she is the weaker partner . Honor her all the more , as she is also a coheir of the gracious care of life . Do this so that your prayers won ’ t be hindered .
CEB	1%20Peter	3	8	Finally , all of you be of one mind , sympathetic , lovers of your fellow believers , compassionate , and modest in your opinion of yourselves .
CEB	1%20Peter	3	9	Don ’ t pay back evil for evil or insult for insult . Instead , give blessing in return . You were called to do this so that you might inherit a blessing .
CEB	1%20Peter	3	10	For those who want to love life and see good days should keep their tongue from evil speaking and their lips from speaking lies .
CEB	1%20Peter	3	11	They should shun evil and do good ; seek peace and chase after it .
CEB	1%20Peter	3	12	The Lord ’ s eyes are on the righteous and his ears are open to their prayers . But the Lord can not tolerate those who do evil . [ a ]
CEB	1%20Peter	3	13	Who will harm you if you are zealous for good ?
CEB	1%20Peter	3	14	But happy are you , even if you suffer because of righteousness ! Don ’ t be terrified or upset by them .
CEB	1%20Peter	3	15	Instead , regard Christ the Lord as holy in your hearts . Whenever anyone asks you to speak of your hope , be ready to defend it .
CEB	1%20Peter	3	16	Yet do this with respectful humility , maintaining a good conscience . Act in this way so that those who malign your good lifestyle in Christ may be ashamed when they slander you .
CEB	1%20Peter	3	17	It is better to suffer for doing good ( if this could possibly be God ’ s will ) than for doing evil .
CEB	1%20Peter	3	18	Christ himself suffered on account of sins , once for all , the righteous one on behalf of the unrighteous . He did this in order to bring you into the presence of God . Christ was put to death as a human , but made alive by the Spirit .
CEB	1%20Peter	3	19	And it was by the Spirit that he went to preach to the spirits in prison .
CEB	1%20Peter	3	20	In the past , these spirits were disobedient—when God patiently waited during the time of Noah . Noah built an ark in which a few ( that is , eight ) lives were rescued through water .
CEB	1%20Peter	3	21	Baptism is like that . It saves you now—not because it removes dirt from your body but because it is the mark of a good conscience toward God . Your salvation comes through the resurrection of Jesus Christ ,
CEB	1%20Peter	3	22	who is at God ’ s right side . Now that he has gone into heaven , he rules over all angels , authorities , and powers .
CEB	1%20Peter	4	1	Peter
CEB	1%20Peter	4	4	They think it ’ s strange that you don ’ t join in these activities with the same flood of unrestrained wickedness . So they slander you .
CEB	1%20Peter	4	2	As a result , they don ’ t live the rest of their human lives in ways determined by human desires but in ways determined by God ’ s will .
CEB	1%20Peter	4	3	You have wasted enough time doing what unbelievers desire—living in their unrestrained immorality and lust , their drunkenness and excessive feasting and wild parties , and their forbidden worship of idols .
CEB	1%20Peter	4	5	They will have to reckon with the one who is ready to judge the living and the dead .
CEB	1%20Peter	4	6	Indeed , this is the reason the good news was also preached to the dead . This happened so that , although they were judged as humans according to human standards , they could live by the Spirit according to divine standards .
CEB	1%20Peter	4	7	The end of everything has come . Therefore , be self-controlled and clearheaded so you can pray .
CEB	1%20Peter	4	8	Above all , show sincere love to each other , because love brings about the forgiveness of many sins .
CEB	1%20Peter	4	9	Open your homes to each other without complaining .
CEB	1%20Peter	4	10	And serve each other according to the gift each person has received , as good managers of God ’ s diverse gifts .
CEB	1%20Peter	4	11	Whoever speaks should do so as those who speak God ’ s word . Whoever serves should do so from the strength that God furnishes . Do this so that in everything God may be honored through Jesus Christ . To him be honor and power forever and always . Amen . Stand firm in the last times
CEB	1%20Peter	4	12	Dear friends , don ’ t be surprised about the fiery trials that have come among you to test you . These are not strange happenings .
CEB	1%20Peter	4	13	Instead , rejoice as you share Christ ’ s suffering . You share his suffering now so that you may also have overwhelming joy when his glory is revealed .
CEB	1%20Peter	4	14	If you are mocked because of Christ ’ s name , you are blessed , for the Spirit of glory—indeed , the Spirit of God—rests on you .
CEB	1%20Peter	4	15	Now none of you should suffer as a murderer or thief or evildoer or rebel .
CEB	1%20Peter	4	16	But don ’ t be ashamed if you suffer as one who belongs to Christ . Rather , honor God as you bear Christ ’ s name . Give honor to God ,
CEB	1%20Peter	4	17	because it ’ s time for judgment to begin with God ’ s own household . But if judgment starts with us , what will happen to those who refuse to believe God ’ s good news ?
CEB	1%20Peter	4	18	If the righteous are barely rescued , what will happen to the godless and sinful ?
CEB	1%20Peter	4	19	So then , those who suffer because they follow God ’ s will should commit their lives to a trustworthy creator by doing what is right .
CEB	1%20Peter	5	1	Peter
CEB	1%20Peter	5	5	In the same way , I urge you who are younger : accept the authority of the elders . And everyone , clothe yourselves with humility toward each other . God stands against the proud , but he gives favor to the humble .
CEB	1%20Peter	5	2	Like shepherds , tend the flock of God among you . Watch over it . Don ’ t shepherd because you must , but do it voluntarily for God . Don ’ t shepherd greedily , but do it eagerly .
CEB	1%20Peter	5	3	Don ’ t shepherd by ruling over those entrusted to your care , but become examples to the flock .
CEB	1%20Peter	5	4	And when the chief shepherd appears , you will receive an unfading crown of glory .
CEB	1%20Peter	5	6	Therefore , humble yourselves under God ’ s power so that he may raise you up in the last day .
CEB	1%20Peter	5	7	Throw all your anxiety onto him , because he cares about you .
CEB	1%20Peter	5	8	Be clearheaded . Keep alert . Your accuser , the devil , is on the prowl like a roaring lion , seeking someone to devour .
CEB	1%20Peter	5	9	Resist him , standing firm in the faith . Do so in the knowledge that your fellow believers are enduring the same suffering throughout the world .
CEB	1%20Peter	5	10	After you have suffered for a little while , the God of all grace , the one who called you into his eternal glory in Christ Jesus , will himself restore , empower , strengthen , and establish you .
CEB	1%20Peter	5	11	To him be power forever and always . Amen . Final greeting
CEB	1%20Peter	5	12	I have written and sent these few lines to you by Silvanus . I consider him to be a faithful brother . In these lines I have urged and affirmed that this is the genuine grace of God . Stand firm in it .
CEB	1%20Peter	5	13	The fellow-elect church in Babylon greets you , and so does my son Mark .
CEB	1%20Peter	5	14	Greet each other with the kiss of love . Peace to you all who are in Christ .
CEB	2%20Peter	1	2	May you have more and more grace and peace through the knowledge of God and Jesus our Lord . Christian life in outline
CEB	2%20Peter	1	1	From Simon Peter , a slave and apostle of Jesus Christ . To those who received a faith equal to ours through the justice of our God and savior Jesus Christ .
CEB	2%20Peter	1	3	By his divine power the Lord has given us everything we need for life and godliness through the knowledge of the one who called us by his own honor and glory .
CEB	2%20Peter	1	4	Through his honor and glory he has given us his precious and wonderful promises , that you may share the divine nature and escape from the world ’ s immorality that sinful craving produces .
CEB	2%20Peter	1	5	This is why you must make every effort to add moral excellence to your faith ; and to moral excellence , knowledge ;
CEB	2%20Peter	1	6	and to knowledge , self-control ; and to self-control , endurance ; and to endurance , godliness ;
CEB	2%20Peter	1	7	and to godliness , affection for others ; and to affection for others , love .
CEB	2%20Peter	1	8	If all these are yours and they are growing in you , they ’ ll keep you from becoming inactive and unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ .
CEB	2%20Peter	1	9	Whoever lacks these things is shortsighted and blind , forgetting that they were cleansed from their past sins .
CEB	2%20Peter	1	10	Therefore , brothers and sisters , be eager to confirm your call and election . Do this and you will never ever be lost .
CEB	2%20Peter	1	11	In this way you will receive a rich welcome into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and savior Jesus Christ . Reminder of the Christian life
CEB	2%20Peter	1	12	So I ’ ll keep reminding you about these things , although you already know them and stand secure in the truth you have .
CEB	2%20Peter	1	13	I think it ’ s right that I keep stirring up your memory , as long as I ’ m alive .
CEB	2%20Peter	1	14	After all , our Lord Jesus Christ has shown me that I am about to depart from this life .
CEB	2%20Peter	1	15	I ’ m eager for you always to remember these things after my death . Christ ’ s return is true
CEB	2%20Peter	1	16	We didn ’ t repeat crafty myths when we told you about the powerful coming of our Lord Jesus Christ . Quite the contrary , we witnessed his majesty with our own eyes .
CEB	2%20Peter	1	17	He received honor and glory from God the Father when a voice came to him from the magnificent glory , saying , “ This is my dearly loved Son , with whom I am well-pleased. ”
CEB	2%20Peter	1	18	We ourselves heard this voice from heaven while we were with him on the holy mountain .
CEB	2%20Peter	1	19	In addition , we have a most reliable prophetic word , and you would do well to pay attention to it , just as you would to a lamp shining in a dark place , until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts .
CEB	2%20Peter	1	20	Most important , you must know that no prophecy of scripture represents the prophet ’ s own understanding of things ,
CEB	2%20Peter	1	21	because no prophecy ever came by human will . Instead , men and women led by the Holy Spirit spoke from God .
CEB	2%20Peter	2	2	Many will follow them in their unrestrained immorality , and because of these false teachers the way of truth will be slandered .
CEB	2%20Peter	2	3	In their greed they will take advantage of you with lies . The judgment pronounced against them long ago hasn ’ t fallen idle , nor is their destruction sleeping . Active judgment of God
CEB	2%20Peter	2	4	God didn ’ t spare the angels when they sinned but cast them into the lowest level of the underworld and committed them to chains of darkness , keeping them there until the judgment .
CEB	2%20Peter	2	5	And he didn ’ t spare the ancient world when he brought a flood on the world of ungodly people , even though he protected Noah , a preacher of righteousness , along with seven others .
CEB	2%20Peter	2	6	God condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to total destruction , reducing them to ashes as a warning to ungodly people .
CEB	2%20Peter	2	7	And he rescued righteous Lot , who was made miserable by the unrestrained immorality of unruly people . (
CEB	2%20Peter	2	8	While that righteous man lived among them he felt deep distress every day on account of the immoral actions he saw and heard . )
CEB	2%20Peter	2	9	These things show that the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from their trials , and how to keep the unrighteous for punishment on the Judgment Day .
CEB	2%20Peter	2	10	This is especially true for those who follow after the corrupt cravings of the sinful nature and defy the Lord ’ s authority . Evil character of the false teachers These reckless , brash people aren ’ t afraid to insult the glorious ones ,
CEB	2%20Peter	2	11	yet angels , who are stronger and more powerful , don ’ t use insults when pronouncing the Lord ’ s judgment on them .
CEB	2%20Peter	2	12	These false teachers are like irrational animals , mere creatures of instinct , born to be captured and destroyed . They slander what they don ’ t understand and , like animals , they will be destroyed .
CEB	2%20Peter	2	13	In this way , they will receive payment for their wrongdoing . They even enjoy unruly parties in broad daylight . They are blots and blemishes , taking delight in their seductive pleasures while feasting with you .
CEB	2%20Peter	2	14	They are always looking for someone with whom to commit adultery . They are always on the lookout for opportunities to sin . They ensnare people whose faith is weak . They have hearts trained in greed . They are under God ’ s curse .
CEB	2%20Peter	2	15	Leaving the straight path , they have gone off course , following the way of Balaam son of Bosor , who loved the payment of doing wrong .
CEB	2%20Peter	2	16	But Balaam was rebuked for his wrongdoing . A donkey , which has no voice , spoke with a human voice and put a stop to the prophet ’ s madness .
CEB	2%20Peter	2	17	These false teachers are springs without water , mists driven by the wind . The underworld has been reserved for them .
CEB	2%20Peter	2	18	With empty , self-important speech , they use sinful cravings and unrestrained immorality to ensnare people who have only just escaped life with those who have wandered from the truth .
CEB	2%20Peter	2	19	These false teachers promise freedom , but they themselves are slaves of immorality ; whatever overpowers you , enslaves you .
CEB	2%20Peter	2	20	If people escape the moral filth of this world through the knowledge of our Lord and savior Jesus Christ , then get tangled up in it again and are overcome by it , they are worse off than they were before .
CEB	2%20Peter	2	21	It would be better for them never to have known the way of righteousness than , having come to know it , to turn back from the holy commandment entrusted to them .
CEB	2%20Peter	2	22	They demonstrate the truth of the proverb : “ A dog returns to its own vomit , and a washed sow wallows in the mud . ”
CEB	2%20Peter	3	2	I want you to recall what the holy prophets foretold as well as what the Lord and savior commanded through your apostles .
CEB	2%20Peter	3	3	Most important , know this : in the last days scoffers will come , jeering , living by their own cravings ,
CEB	2%20Peter	3	4	and saying , “ Where is the promise of his coming ? After all , nothing has changed—not since the beginning of creation , nor even since the ancestors died. ”
CEB	2%20Peter	3	5	But they fail to notice that , by God ’ s word , heaven and earth were formed long ago out of water and by means of water .
CEB	2%20Peter	3	6	And it was through these that the world of that time was flooded and destroyed .
CEB	2%20Peter	3	7	But by the same word , heaven and earth are now held in reserve for fire , kept for the Judgment Day and destruction of ungodly people .
CEB	2%20Peter	3	8	Don ’ t let it escape your notice , dear friends , that with the Lord a single day is like a thousand years and a thousand years are like a single day .
CEB	2%20Peter	3	9	The Lord isn ’ t slow to keep his promise , as some think of slowness , but he is patient toward you , not wanting anyone to perish but all to change their hearts and lives .
CEB	2%20Peter	3	10	But the day of the Lord will come like a thief . On that day the heavens will pass away with a dreadful noise , the elements will be consumed by fire , and the earth and all the works done on it will be exposed .
CEB	2%20Peter	3	11	Since everything will be destroyed in this way , what sort of people ought you to be ? You must live holy and godly lives ,
CEB	2%20Peter	3	12	waiting for and hastening the coming day of God . Because of that day , the heavens will be destroyed by fire and the elements will melt away in the flames .
CEB	2%20Peter	3	13	But according to his promise we are waiting for a new heaven and a new earth , where righteousness is at home . Preparing for Christ ’ s coming in judgment
CEB	2%20Peter	3	14	Therefore , dear friends , while you are waiting for these things to happen , make every effort to be found by him in peace—pure and faultless .
CEB	2%20Peter	3	15	Consider the patience of our Lord to be salvation , just as our dear friend and brother Paul wrote to you according to the wisdom given to him ,
CEB	2%20Peter	3	16	speaking of these things in all his letters . Some of his remarks are hard to understand , and people who are ignorant and whose faith is weak twist them to their own destruction , just as they do the other scriptures . Final instruction
CEB	2%20Peter	3	17	Therefore , dear friends , since you have been warned in advance , be on guard so that you aren ’ t led off course into the error of sinful people , and lose your own safe position .
CEB	2%20Peter	3	18	Instead , grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and savior Jesus Christ . To him belongs glory now and forever . Amen .
CEB	1%20John	1	1	We announce to you what existed from the beginning , what we have heard , what we have seen with our eyes , what we have seen and our hands handled , about the word of life .
CEB	1%20John	1	2	The life was revealed , and we have seen , and we testify and announce to you the eternal life that was with the Father and was revealed to us .
CEB	1%20John	1	3	What we have seen and heard , we also announce it to you so that you can have fellowship with us . Our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son , Jesus Christ .
CEB	1%20John	1	4	We are writing these things so that our joy can be complete . The message : God is light
CEB	1%20John	1	5	This is the message that we have heard from him and announce to you : “ God is light and there is no darkness in him at all. ”
CEB	1%20John	1	6	If we claim , “ We have fellowship with him , ” and live in the darkness , we are lying and do not act truthfully .
CEB	1%20John	1	7	But if we live in the light in the same way as he is in the light , we have fellowship with each other , and the blood of Jesus , his Son , cleanses us from every sin .
CEB	1%20John	1	8	If we claim , “ We don ’ t have any sin , ” we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us .
CEB	1%20John	1	9	But if we confess our sins , he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from everything we ’ ve done wrong .
CEB	1%20John	1	10	If we claim , “ We have never sinned , ” we make him a liar and his word is not in us .
CEB	1%20John	2	1	John
CEB	1%20John	2	2	He is God ’ s way of dealing with our sins , not only ours but the sins of the whole world .
CEB	1%20John	2	3	This is how we know that we know him : if we keep his commandments .
CEB	1%20John	2	4	The one who claims , “ I know him , ” while not keeping his commandments , is a liar , and the truth is not in this person .
CEB	1%20John	2	5	But the love of God is truly perfected in whoever keeps his word . This is how we know we are in him .
CEB	1%20John	2	6	The one who claims to remain in him ought to live in the same way as he lived .
CEB	1%20John	2	7	Dear friends , I ’ m not writing a new commandment to you , but an old commandment that you had from the beginning . The old commandment is the message you heard .
CEB	1%20John	2	8	On the other hand , I am writing a new commandment to you , which is true in him and in you , because the darkness is passing away and the true light already shines .
CEB	1%20John	2	9	The one who claims to be in the light while hating a brother or sister is in the darkness even now .
CEB	1%20John	2	10	The person loving a brother and sister stays in the light , and there is nothing in the light that causes a person to stumble .
CEB	1%20John	2	11	But the person who hates a brother or sister is in the darkness and lives in the darkness , and doesn ’ t know where to go because the darkness blinds the eyes . Motivations for writing
CEB	1%20John	2	12	Little children , I ’ m writing to you because your sins have been forgiven through Jesus ’ name .
CEB	1%20John	2	13	Parents , I ’ m writing to you because you have known the one who has existed from the beginning . Young people , I ’ m writing to you because you have conquered the evil one .
CEB	1%20John	2	14	Little children , I write to you because you know the Father . Parents , I write to you because you have known the one who has existed from the beginning . Young people , I write to you because you are strong , the word of God remains in you , and you have conquered the evil one . Warning about the world
CEB	1%20John	2	15	Don ’ t love the world or the things in the world . If anyone loves the world , the love of the Father is not in them .
CEB	1%20John	2	16	Everything that is in the world—the craving for whatever the body feels , the craving for whatever the eyes see and the arrogant pride in one ’ s possessions—is not of the Father but is of the world .
CEB	1%20John	2	17	And the world and its cravings are passing away , but the person who does the will of God remains forever . Remaining in the truth
CEB	1%20John	2	18	Little children , it is the last hour . Just as you have heard that the antichrist is coming , so now many antichrists have appeared . This is how we know it is the last hour .
CEB	1%20John	2	19	They went out from us , but they were not really part of us . If they had been part of us , they would have stayed with us . But by going out from us , they showed they all are not part of us .
CEB	1%20John	2	20	But you have an anointing from the holy one , and all of you know the truth .
CEB	1%20John	2	21	I don ’ t write to you because you don ’ t know the truth but because you know it . You know that no lie comes from the truth .
CEB	1%20John	2	22	Who is the liar ? Isn ’ t it the person who denies that Jesus is the Christ ? This person is the antichrist : the one who denies the Father and the Son .
CEB	1%20John	2	23	Everyone who denies the Son does not have the Father , but the one who confesses the Son has the Father also .
CEB	1%20John	2	24	As for you , what you heard from the beginning must remain in you . If what you heard from the beginning remains in you , you will also remain in relationship to the Son and in the Father .
CEB	1%20John	2	25	This is the promise that he himself gave us : eternal life .
CEB	1%20John	2	26	I write these things to you about those who are attempting to deceive you .
CEB	1%20John	2	27	As for you , the anointing that you received from him remains on you , and you don ’ t need anyone to teach you the truth . But since his anointing teaches you about all things ( it ’ s true and not a lie ) , remain in relationship to him just as he taught you . Remaining until Jesus appears
CEB	1%20John	2	28	And now , little children , remain in relationship to Jesus , so that when he appears we can have confidence and not be ashamed in front of him when he comes .
CEB	1%20John	2	29	If you know that he is righteous , you also know that every person who practices righteousness is born from him .
CEB	1%20John	3	1	John 3:9 Or genetic character
CEB	1%20John	3	3	And all who have this hope in him purify themselves even as he is pure .
CEB	1%20John	3	2	Dear friends , now we are God ’ s children , and it hasn ’ t yet appeared what we will be . We know that when he appears we will be like him because we ’ ll see him as he is .
CEB	1%20John	3	4	Every person who practices sin commits an act of rebellion , and sin is rebellion .
CEB	1%20John	3	5	You know that he appeared to take away sins , and there is no sin in him .
CEB	1%20John	3	6	Every person who remains in relationship to him does not sin . Any person who sins has not seen him or known him . Practicing sin or righteousness
CEB	1%20John	3	7	Little children , make sure no one deceives you . The person who practices righteousness is righteous , in the same way that Jesus is righteous .
CEB	1%20John	3	8	The person who practices sin belongs to the devil , because the devil has been sinning since the beginning . God ’ s Son appeared for this purpose : to destroy the works of the devil .
CEB	1%20John	3	9	Those born from God don ’ t practice sin because God ’ s DNA [ a ] remains in them . They can ’ t sin because they are born from God .
CEB	1%20John	3	10	This is how God ’ s children and the devil ’ s children are apparent : everyone who doesn ’ t practice righteousness is not from God , including the person who doesn ’ t love a brother or sister .
CEB	1%20John	3	11	This is the message that you heard from the beginning : love each other .
CEB	1%20John	3	12	Don ’ t behave like Cain , who belonged to the evil one and murdered his brother . And why did he kill him ? He killed him because his own works were evil , but the works of his brother were righteous . Loving each other
CEB	1%20John	3	13	Don ’ t be surprised , brothers and sisters , if the world hates you .
CEB	1%20John	3	14	We know that we have transferred from death to life , because we love the brothers and sisters . The person who does not love remains in death .
CEB	1%20John	3	15	Everyone who hates a brother or sister is a murderer , and you know that murderers don ’ t have eternal life residing in them .
CEB	1%20John	3	16	This is how we know love : Jesus laid down his life for us , and we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters .
CEB	1%20John	3	17	But if someone has material possessions and sees a brother or sister in need but refuses to help—how can the love of God dwell in a person like that ?
CEB	1%20John	3	18	Little children , let ’ s not love with words or speech but with action and truth .
CEB	1%20John	3	19	This is how we will know that we belong to the truth and reassure our hearts in God ’ s presence .
CEB	1%20John	3	20	Even if our hearts condemn us , God is greater than our hearts and knows all things .
CEB	1%20John	3	21	Dear friends , if our hearts don ’ t condemn us , we have confidence in relationship to God .
CEB	1%20John	3	22	We receive whatever we ask from him because we keep his commandments and do what pleases him .
CEB	1%20John	3	23	This is his commandment , that we believe in the name of his Son , Jesus Christ , and love each other as he commanded us .
CEB	1%20John	3	24	Those who keep his commandments dwell in God and God dwells in them . This is how we know that he dwells in us , because of the Spirit he has given us . Footnotes -
CEB	1%20John	4	1	John 4:2 Or come in the flesh
CEB	1%20John	4	4	You are from God , little children , and you have defeated these people because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world .
CEB	1%20John	4	2	This is how you know if a spirit comes from God : every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come as a human [ a ] is from God ,
CEB	1%20John	4	3	and every spirit that doesn ’ t confess Jesus is not from God . This is the spirit of the antichrist , which you have heard is coming and is now already in the world .
CEB	1%20John	4	5	They are from the world . So they speak from the world ’ s point of view and the world listens to them .
CEB	1%20John	4	6	We are from God . The person who knows God listens to us . Whoever is not from God doesn ’ t listen to us . This is how we recognize the Spirit of truth and the spirit of error . Love and God
CEB	1%20John	4	7	Dear friends , let ’ s love each other , because love is from God , and everyone who loves is born from God and knows God .
CEB	1%20John	4	8	The person who doesn ’ t love does not know God , because God is love .
CEB	1%20John	4	9	This is how the love of God is revealed to us : God has sent his only Son into the world so that we can live through him .
CEB	1%20John	4	10	This is love : it is not that we loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son as the sacrifice that deals with our sins .
CEB	1%20John	4	11	Dear friends , if God loved us this way , we also ought to love each other .
CEB	1%20John	4	12	No one has ever seen God . If we love each other , God remains in us and his love is made perfect in us .
CEB	1%20John	4	13	This is how we know we remain in him and he remains in us , because he has given us a measure of his Spirit .
CEB	1%20John	4	14	We have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son to be the savior of the world .
CEB	1%20John	4	15	If any of us confess that Jesus is God ’ s Son , God remains in us and we remain in God .
CEB	1%20John	4	16	We have known and have believed the love that God has for us . God is love , and those who remain in love remain in God and God remains in them .
CEB	1%20John	4	17	This is how love has been perfected in us , so that we can have confidence on the Judgment Day , because we are exactly the same as God is in this world .
CEB	1%20John	4	18	There is no fear in love , but perfect love drives out fear , because fear expects punishment . The person who is afraid has not been made perfect in love .
CEB	1%20John	4	19	We love because God first loved us .
CEB	1%20John	4	20	Those who say , “ I love God ” and hate their brothers or sisters are liars . After all , those who don ’ t love their brothers or sisters whom they have seen can hardly love God whom they have not seen !
CEB	1%20John	4	21	This commandment we have from him : Those who claim to love God ought to love their brother and sister also . Footnotes -
CEB	1%20John	5	1	John 5:18 Or but the one who is born from God guards him from sin
CEB	1%20John	5	5	Who defeats the world ? Isn ’ t it the one who believes that Jesus is God ’ s Son ? Testimony about Jesus
CEB	1%20John	5	2	This is how we know that we love the children of God : when we love God and keep God ’ s commandments .
CEB	1%20John	5	3	This is the love of God : we keep God ’ s commandments . God ’ s commandments are not difficult ,
CEB	1%20John	5	4	because everyone who is born from God defeats the world . And this is the victory that has defeated the world : our faith .
CEB	1%20John	5	6	This is the one who came by water and blood : Jesus Christ . Not by water only but by water and blood . And the Spirit is the one who testifies , because the Spirit is the truth .
CEB	1%20John	5	7	The three are testifying—
CEB	1%20John	5	8	the Spirit , the water , and the blood—and the three are united in agreement .
CEB	1%20John	5	9	If we receive human testimony , God ’ s testimony is greater , because this is what God testified : he has testified about his Son .
CEB	1%20John	5	10	The one who believes in God ’ s Son has the testimony within ; the one who doesn ’ t believe God has made God a liar , because that one has not believed the testimony that God gave about his Son .
CEB	1%20John	5	11	And this is the testimony : God gave eternal life to us , and this life is in his Son .
CEB	1%20John	5	12	The one who has the Son has life . The one who doesn ’ t have God ’ s Son does not have life . Confidence in prayer
CEB	1%20John	5	13	I write these things to you who believe in the name of God ’ s Son so that you can know that you have eternal life .
CEB	1%20John	5	14	This is the confidence that we have in our relationship with God : If we ask for anything in agreement with his will , he listens to us .
CEB	1%20John	5	15	If we know that he listens to whatever we ask , we know that we have received what we asked from him .
CEB	1%20John	5	16	If anyone sees a brother or sister committing a sin that does not result in death , they should pray , and God will give life to them—that is , to those who commit sins that don ’ t result in death . There is a sin that results in death—I ’ m not saying that you should pray about that .
CEB	1%20John	5	17	Every unrighteous action is sin , but there is a sin that does not result in death . Be on guard
CEB	1%20John	5	18	We know that everyone born from God does not sin , but the ones born from God guard themselves , [ a ] and the evil one can not touch them .
CEB	1%20John	5	19	We know we are from God , and the whole world lies in the power of the evil one .
CEB	1%20John	5	20	We know that God ’ s Son has come and has given us understanding to know the one who is true . We are in the one who is true by being in his Son , Jesus Christ . This is the true God and eternal life .
CEB	1%20John	5	21	Little children , guard yourselves from idols ! Footnotes -
CEB	2%20John	1	2	because of the truth that remains with us and will be with us forever .
CEB	2%20John	1	1	From the elder . To the chosen gentlewoman and her children , whom I truly love ( and I am not the only one , but also all who know the truth ) ,
CEB	2%20John	1	3	Grace , mercy , and peace from God the Father and from Jesus Christ , the Son of the Father , will be ours who live in truth and love . Love each other
CEB	2%20John	1	4	I was overjoyed to find some of your children living in the truth , just as we had been commanded by the Father .
CEB	2%20John	1	5	Now , dear friends , I am requesting that we love each other . It ’ s not as though I ’ m writing a new command to you , but it ’ s one we have had from the beginning .
CEB	2%20John	1	6	This is love : that we live according to his commands . This is the command that you heard from the beginning : live in love . Reject false teachers
CEB	2%20John	1	7	Many deceivers have gone into the world who do not confess that Jesus Christ came as a human being . This kind of person is the deceiver and the antichrist .
CEB	2%20John	1	8	Watch yourselves so that you don ’ t lose what we ’ ve worked for but instead receive a full reward .
CEB	2%20John	1	9	Anyone who goes too far and does not continue in the teaching about Christ does not have God . Whoever continues in this teaching has both the Father and the Son .
CEB	2%20John	1	10	Whoever comes to you who does not affirm this teaching should neither be received nor welcomed into your home ,
CEB	2%20John	1	11	because welcoming people like that is the same thing as sharing in their evil actions . Plans to visit
CEB	2%20John	1	12	I have a lot to tell you . I don ’ t want to use paper and ink , but I hope to visit you and talk with you face-to-face , so that our joy can be complete . Final greeting
CEB	2%20John	1	13	Your chosen sister ’ s children greet you .
CEB	3%20John	1	3	I was overjoyed when the brothers and sisters arrived and spoke highly of your faithfulness to the truth , shown by how you live according to the truth .
CEB	3%20John	1	1	From the elder . To my dear friend Gaius , whom I truly love .
CEB	3%20John	1	2	Dear friend , I ’ m praying that all is well with you and that you enjoy good health in the same way that you prosper spiritually . Encouragement for Gaius
CEB	3%20John	1	4	I have no greater joy than this : to hear that my children are living according to the truth .
CEB	3%20John	1	5	Dear friend , you act faithfully in whatever you do for our brothers and sisters , even though they are strangers .
CEB	3%20John	1	6	They spoke highly of your love in front of the church . You all would do well to provide for their journey in a way that honors God ,
CEB	3%20John	1	7	because they left on their journey for the sake of Jesus Christ without accepting any support from the Gentiles .
CEB	3%20John	1	8	Therefore , we ought to help people like this so that we can be coworkers with the truth . Criticism of Diotrephes
CEB	3%20John	1	9	I wrote something to the church , but Diotrephes , who likes to put himself first , doesn ’ t welcome us .
CEB	3%20John	1	10	Because of this , if I come , I will bring up what he has done—making unjustified and wicked accusations against us . And as if that were not enough , he not only refuses to welcome the brothers and sisters but stops those who want to do so and even throws them out of the church !
CEB	3%20John	1	11	Dear friend , don ’ t imitate what is bad but what is good . Whoever practices what is good belongs to God . Whoever practices what is bad has not seen God . Approval of Demetrius
CEB	3%20John	1	12	Everyone speaks highly of Demetrius , even the truth itself . We also speak highly of him , and you know that what we say is true . Final greeting
CEB	3%20John	1	13	I have a lot to say to you , but I don ’ t want to use pen and ink .
CEB	3%20John	1	14	I hope to see you soon , and we will speak face-to-face .
CEB	3%20John	1	15	Peace be with you . Your friends here greet you . Greet our friends there by name .
CEB	Jude	1	1	Jude , a slave of Jesus Christ and brother of James . To those who are called , loved by God the Father and kept safe by Jesus Christ .
CEB	Jude	1	2	May you have more and more mercy , peace , and love . Certain judgment of the false teachers
CEB	Jude	1	3	Dear friends , I wanted very much to write to you concerning the salvation we share . Instead , I must write to urge you to fight for the faith delivered once and for all to God ’ s holy people .
CEB	Jude	1	4	Godless people have slipped in among you . They turn the grace of our God into unrestrained immorality and deny our only master and Lord , Jesus Christ . Judgment was passed against them a long time ago .
CEB	Jude	1	5	I want to remind you of something you already know very well . The Lord , who once saved a people out of Egypt , later destroyed those who didn ’ t maintain their faith .
CEB	Jude	1	6	I remind you too of the angels who didn ’ t keep their position of authority but deserted their own home . The Lord has kept them in eternal chains in the underworld until the judgment of the great day .
CEB	Jude	1	7	In the same way , Sodom and Gomorrah and neighboring towns practiced immoral sexual relations and pursued other sexual urges . By undergoing the punishment of eternal fire , they serve as a warning .
CEB	Jude	1	8	Yet , even knowing this , these dreamers in the same way pollute themselves , reject authority , and slander the angels .
CEB	Jude	1	9	The archangel Michael , when he argued with the devil about Moses ’ body , did not dare charge him with slander . Instead , he said , “ The Lord rebuke you ! ”
CEB	Jude	1	10	But these people slander whatever they don ’ t understand . They are destroyed by what they know instinctively , as though they were irrational animals . Prophecies about the false teachers
CEB	Jude	1	11	They are damned , for they follow in the footsteps of Cain . For profit they give themselves over to Balaam ’ s error . They are destroyed in the uprising of Korah .
CEB	Jude	1	12	These people are like jagged rocks just below the surface of the water waiting to snag you when they join your love feasts . They feast with you without reverence . They care only for themselves . They are waterless clouds carried along by the winds ; fruitless autumn trees , twice dead , uprooted ;
CEB	Jude	1	13	wild waves of the sea foaming up their own shame ; wandering stars for whom the darkness of the underworld is reserved forever .
CEB	Jude	1	14	Enoch , who lived seven generations after Adam , prophesied about these people when he said , “ See , the Lord comes with his countless holy ones ,
CEB	Jude	1	15	to execute judgment on everyone and to convict everyone about every ungodly deed they have committed in their ungodliness as well as all the harsh things that sinful ungodly people have said against him. ”
CEB	Jude	1	16	These are faultfinding grumblers , living according to their own desires . They speak arrogant words and they show partiality to people when they want a favor in return .
CEB	Jude	1	17	But you , dear friends , remember the words spoken beforehand by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ .
CEB	Jude	1	18	They said to you , “ In the end time scoffers will come living according to their own ungodly desires. ”
CEB	Jude	1	19	These people create divisions . Since they don ’ t have the Spirit , they are worldly . A strategy for the faithful
CEB	Jude	1	20	But you , dear friends : build each other up on the foundation of your most holy faith , pray in the Holy Spirit ,
CEB	Jude	1	21	keep each other in the love of God , wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ , who will give you eternal life .
CEB	Jude	1	22	Have mercy on those who doubt .
CEB	Jude	1	23	Save some by snatching them from the fire . Fearing God , have mercy on some , hating even the clothing contaminated by their sinful urges . Blessing
CEB	Jude	1	24	To the one who is able to protect you from falling , and to present you blameless and rejoicing before his glorious presence ,
CEB	Jude	1	25	to the only God our savior , through Jesus Christ our Lord , belong glory , majesty , power , and authority , before all time , now and forever . Amen .
CEB	Revelation	1	1	A revelation of Jesus Christ , which God gave him to show his servants what must soon take place . Christ made it known by sending it through his angel to his servant John ,
CEB	Revelation	1	2	who bore witness to the word of God and to the witness of Jesus Christ , including all that John saw .
CEB	Revelation	1	3	Favored is the one who reads the words of this prophecy out loud , and favored are those who listen to it being read , and keep what is written in it , for the time is near .
CEB	Revelation	1	4	John , to the seven churches that are in Asia : Grace and peace to you from the one who is and was and is coming , and from the seven spirits that are before God ’ s throne ,
CEB	Revelation	1	5	and from Jesus Christ—the faithful witness , the firstborn from among the dead , and the ruler of the kings of the earth . To the one who loves us and freed us from our sins by his blood ,
CEB	Revelation	1	6	who made us a kingdom , priests to his God and Father—to him be glory and power forever and always . Amen .
CEB	Revelation	1	7	Look , he is coming with the clouds ! Every eye will see him , including those who pierced him , and all the tribes of the earth will mourn because of him . This is so . Amen .
CEB	Revelation	1	8	“ I am the Alpha and the Omega , ” says the Lord God , “ the one who is and was and is coming , the Almighty. ” Christ appears to John
CEB	Revelation	1	9	I , John , your brother who shares with you in the hardship , kingdom , and endurance that we have in Jesus , was on the island called Patmos because of the word of God and my witness about Jesus .
CEB	Revelation	1	10	I was in a Spirit-inspired trance on the Lord ’ s day , and I heard behind me a loud voice that sounded like a trumpet .
CEB	Revelation	1	11	It said , “ Write down on a scroll whatever you see , and send it to the seven churches : to Ephesus , Smyrna , Pergamum , Thyatira , Sardis , Philadelphia , and Laodicea. ”
CEB	Revelation	1	12	I turned to see who was speaking to me , and when I turned , I saw seven oil lamps burning on top of seven gold stands .
CEB	Revelation	1	13	In the middle of the lampstands I saw someone who looked like the Human One . [ a ] He wore a robe that stretched down to his feet , and he had a gold sash around his chest .
CEB	Revelation	1	14	His head and hair were white as white wool—like snow—and his eyes were like a fiery flame .
CEB	Revelation	1	15	His feet were like fine brass that has been purified in a furnace , and his voice sounded like rushing water .
CEB	Revelation	1	16	He held seven stars in his right hand , and from his mouth came a sharp , two-edged sword . His appearance was like the sun shining with all its power .
CEB	Revelation	1	17	When I saw him , I fell at his feet like a dead man . But he put his right hand on me and said , “ Don ’ t be afraid . I ’ m the first and the last ,
CEB	Revelation	1	18	and the living one . I was dead , but look ! Now I ’ m alive forever and always . I have the keys of Death and the Grave .
CEB	Revelation	1	19	So write down what you have seen , both the scene now before you and the things that are about to unfold after this .
CEB	Revelation	1	20	As for the mystery of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand and the seven gold lampstands , here is what they mean : the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches , and the seven lampstands are the seven churches . Footnotes - Revelation 1:13 Or Son of Man
CEB	Revelation	2	2	I know your works , your labor , and your endurance . I also know that you don ’ t put up with those who are evil . You have tested those who say they are apostles but are not , and you have found them to be liars .
CEB	Revelation	2	3	You have shown endurance and put up with a lot for my name ’ s sake , and you haven ’ t gotten tired .
CEB	Revelation	2	4	But I have this against you : you have let go of the love you had at first .
CEB	Revelation	2	5	So remember the high point from which you have fallen . Change your hearts and lives and do the things you did at first . If you don ’ t , I ’ m coming to you . I will move your lampstand from its place if you don ’ t change your hearts and lives .
CEB	Revelation	2	6	But you have this in your favor : you hate what the Nicolaitans are doing , which I also hate .
CEB	Revelation	2	7	If you can hear , listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches . I will allow those who emerge victorious to eat from the tree of life , which is in God ’ s paradise . Message to Smyrna
CEB	Revelation	2	8	“ Write this to the angel of the church in Smyrna : These are the words of the one who is the first and the last , who died and came back to life :
CEB	Revelation	2	9	I know your hardship and poverty ( though you are actually rich ) . I also know the hurtful things that have been spoken about you by those who say they are Jews ( though they are not , but are really Satan ’ s synagogue ) .
CEB	Revelation	2	10	Don ’ t be afraid of what you are going to suffer . Look ! The devil is going to throw some of you into prison in order to test you . You will suffer hardship for ten days . Be faithful even to the point of death , and I will give you the crown of life .
CEB	Revelation	2	11	If you can hear , listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches . Those who emerge victorious won ’ t be hurt by the second death . Message to Pergamum
CEB	Revelation	2	12	“ Write this to the angel of the church in Pergamum : These are the words of the one who has the sharp , two-edged sword :
CEB	Revelation	2	13	I know that you are living right where Satan ’ s throne is . You are holding on to my name , and you didn ’ t break faith with me even at the time that Antipas , my faithful witness , was killed among you , where Satan lives .
CEB	Revelation	2	14	But I have a few things against you , because you have some there who follow Balaam ’ s teaching . Balaam had taught Balak to trip up the Israelites so that they would eat food sacrificed to idols and commit sexual immorality .
CEB	Revelation	2	15	In the same way , you have some who follow the Nicolaitans ’ teaching .
CEB	Revelation	2	16	So change your hearts and lives . If you don ’ t , I am coming to you soon , and I will make war on them with the sword that comes from my mouth .
CEB	Revelation	2	17	If you can hear , listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches . I will give those who emerge victorious some of the hidden manna to eat . I will also give to each of them a white stone with a new name written on it , which no one knows except the one who receives it . Message to Thyatira
CEB	Revelation	2	18	“ Write this to the angel of the church in Thyatira : These are the words of God ’ s Son , whose eyes are like a fiery flame , and whose feet are like fine brass .
CEB	Revelation	2	19	I know your works , your love and faithfulness , your service and endurance . I also know that the works you have done most recently are even greater than those you did at first .
CEB	Revelation	2	20	But I have this against you : you put up with that woman , Jezebel , who calls herself a prophet . You allow her to teach and to mislead my servants into committing sexual immorality and eating food sacrificed to idols .
CEB	Revelation	2	21	I gave her time to change her heart and life , but she refuses to change her life of prostitution .
CEB	Revelation	2	22	Look ! I ’ m throwing her onto a sickbed . I am casting those who have committed adultery with her into terrible hardship—if they don ’ t change their hearts from following her practices—
CEB	Revelation	2	23	and I will even put her children to death with disease . Then all the churches will know that I ’ m the one who examines minds and hearts , and that I will give to each of you what your actions deserve .
CEB	Revelation	2	24	As for the rest of you in Thyatira—those of you who don ’ t follow this teaching and haven ’ t learned the so-called “ deep secrets ” of Satan—I won ’ t burden you with anything else .
CEB	Revelation	2	25	Just hold on to what you have until I come .
CEB	Revelation	2	26	To those who emerge victorious , keeping my practices until the end , I will give authority over the nations—
CEB	Revelation	2	27	to rule the nations with an iron rod and smash them like pottery—
CEB	Revelation	2	28	just as I received authority from my Father . I will also give them the morning star .
CEB	Revelation	2	29	If you can hear , listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches .
CEB	Revelation	3	3	So remember what you received and heard . Hold on to it and change your hearts and lives . If you don ’ t wake up , I will come like a thief , and you won ’ t know what time I will come upon you .
CEB	Revelation	3	2	Wake up and strengthen whatever you have left , teetering on the brink of death , for I ’ ve found that your works are far from complete in the eyes of my God .
CEB	Revelation	3	4	But you do have a few people in Sardis who haven ’ t stained their clothing . They will walk with me clothed in white because they are worthy .
CEB	Revelation	3	5	Those who emerge victorious will wear white clothing like this . I won ’ t scratch out their names from the scroll of life , but will declare their names in the presence of my Father and his angels .
CEB	Revelation	3	6	If you can hear , listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches . Message to Philadelphia
CEB	Revelation	3	7	“ Write this to the angel of the church in Philadelphia : These are the words of the one who is holy and true , who has the key of David . Whatever he opens , no one will shut ; and whatever he shuts , no one opens .
CEB	Revelation	3	8	I know your works . Look ! I have set in front of you an open door that no one can shut . You have so little power , and yet you have kept my word and haven ’ t denied my name .
CEB	Revelation	3	9	Because of this I will make the people from Satan ’ s synagogue ( who say they are Jews and really aren ’ t , but are lying ) —I will make them come and bow down at your feet and realize that I have loved you .
CEB	Revelation	3	10	Because you kept my command to endure , I will keep you safe through the time of testing that is about to come over the whole world , to test those who live on earth .
CEB	Revelation	3	11	I ’ m coming soon . Hold on to what you have so that no one takes your crown .
CEB	Revelation	3	12	As for those who emerge victorious , I will make them pillars in the temple of my God , and they will never leave it . I will write on them the name of my God and the name of the city of my God , the New Jerusalem that comes down out of heaven from my God . I will also write on them my own new name .
CEB	Revelation	3	13	If you can hear , listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches . Message to Laodicea
CEB	Revelation	3	14	“ Write this to the angel of the church in Laodicea : These are the words of the Amen , the faithful and true witness , the ruler [ a ] of God ’ s creation .
CEB	Revelation	3	15	I know your works . You are neither cold nor hot . I wish that you were either cold or hot .
CEB	Revelation	3	16	So because you are lukewarm , and neither hot nor cold , I ’ m about to spit you out of my mouth .
CEB	Revelation	3	17	After all , you say , ‘ I ’ m rich , and I ’ ve grown wealthy , and I don ’ t need a thing. ’ You don ’ t realize that you are miserable , pathetic , poor , blind , and naked .
CEB	Revelation	3	18	My advice is that you buy gold from me that has been purified by fire so that you may be rich , and white clothing to wear so that your nakedness won ’ t be shamefully exposed , and ointment to put on your eyes so that you may see .
CEB	Revelation	3	19	I correct and discipline those whom I love . So be earnest and change your hearts and lives .
CEB	Revelation	3	20	Look ! I ’ m standing at the door and knocking . If any hear my voice and open the door , I will come in to be with them , and will have dinner with them , and they will have dinner with me .
CEB	Revelation	3	21	As for those who emerge victorious , I will allow them to sit with me on my throne , just as I emerged victorious and sat down with my Father on his throne .
CEB	Revelation	3	22	If you can hear , listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches. ” Footnotes - Revelation 3:14 Or beginning
CEB	Revelation	4	4	Twenty-four thrones , with twenty-four elders seated upon them , surrounded the throne . The elders were dressed in white clothing and had gold crowns on their heads .
CEB	Revelation	4	2	At once I was in a Spirit-inspired trance and I saw a throne in heaven , and someone was seated on the throne .
CEB	Revelation	4	3	The one seated there looked like jasper and carnelian , and surrounding the throne was a rainbow that looked like an emerald .
CEB	Revelation	4	5	From the throne came lightning , voices , and thunder . In front of the throne were seven flaming torches , which are the seven spirits of God .
CEB	Revelation	4	6	Something like a glass sea , like crystal , was in front of the throne . In the center , by the throne , were four living creatures encircling the throne . These creatures were covered with eyes on the front and on the back .
CEB	Revelation	4	7	The first living creature was like a lion . The second living creature was like an ox . The third living creature had a face like a human being . And the fourth living creature was like an eagle in flight .
CEB	Revelation	4	8	Each of the four living creatures had six wings , and each was covered all around and on the inside with eyes . They never rest day or night , but keep on saying , “ Holy , holy , holy is the Lord God Almighty , who was and is and is coming. ”
CEB	Revelation	4	9	Whenever the living creatures give glory , honor , and thanks to the one seated on the throne , who lives forever and always ,
CEB	Revelation	4	10	the twenty-four elders fall before the one seated on the throne . They worship the one who lives forever and always . They throw down their crowns before the throne and say ,
CEB	Revelation	4	11	“ You are worthy , our Lord and God , to receive glory and honor and power , because you created all things . It is by your will that they existed and were created . ”
CEB	Revelation	5	5	Then one of the elders said to me , “ Don ’ t weep . Look ! The Lion of the tribe of Judah , the Root of David , has emerged victorious so that he can open the scroll and its seven seals. ”
CEB	Revelation	5	2	I saw a powerful angel , who proclaimed in a loud voice , “ Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals ? ”
CEB	Revelation	5	3	But no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth could open the scroll or look inside it .
CEB	Revelation	5	4	So I began to weep and weep , because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look inside it .
CEB	Revelation	5	6	Then , in between the throne and the four living creatures and among the elders , I saw a Lamb , standing as if it had been slain . It had seven horns and seven eyes , which are God ’ s seven spirits , sent out into the whole earth .
CEB	Revelation	5	7	He came forward and took the scroll from the right hand of the one seated on the throne .
CEB	Revelation	5	8	When he took the scroll , the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb . Each held a harp and gold bowls full of incense , which are the prayers of the saints .
CEB	Revelation	5	9	They took up a new song , saying , “ You are worthy to take the scroll and open its seals , because you were slain , and by your blood you purchased for God persons from every tribe , language , people , and nation .
CEB	Revelation	5	10	You made them a kingdom and priests to our God , and they will rule on earth. ”
CEB	Revelation	5	11	Then I looked , and I heard the sound of many angels surrounding the throne , the living creatures , and the elders . They numbered in the millions—thousands upon thousands .
CEB	Revelation	5	12	They said in a loud voice , “ Worthy is the slaughtered Lamb to receive power , wealth , wisdom , and might , and honor , glory , and blessing. ”
CEB	Revelation	5	13	And I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea—I heard everything everywhere say , “ Blessing , honor , glory , and power belong to the one seated on the throne and to the Lamb forever and always. ”
CEB	Revelation	5	14	Then the four living creatures said , “ Amen , ” and the elders fell down and worshipped .
CEB	Revelation	6	6	I heard what sounded like a voice from among the four living creatures . It said , “ A quart of wheat for a denarion , [ a ] and three quarts of barley for a denarion , but don ’ t damage the olive oil and the wine. ”
CEB	Revelation	6	2	So I looked , and there was a white horse . Its rider held a bow and was given a crown . And he went forth from victory to victory .
CEB	Revelation	6	3	When the Lamb opened the second seal , I heard the second living creature say , “ Come ! ”
CEB	Revelation	6	4	Out came another horse , fiery red . Its rider was allowed to take peace from the earth so that people would kill each other . He was given a large sword .
CEB	Revelation	6	5	When he opened the third seal , I heard the third living creature say , “ Come ! ” So I looked , and there was a black horse . Its rider held a balance for weighing in his hand .
CEB	Revelation	6	7	When he opened the fourth seal , I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say , “ Come ! ”
CEB	Revelation	6	8	So I looked , and there was a pale green horse . Its rider ’ s name was Death , and the Grave was following right behind . They were given authority over a fourth of the earth , to kill by sword , famine , disease , and the wild animals of the earth .
CEB	Revelation	6	9	When he opened the fifth seal , I saw under the altar those who had been slaughtered on account of the word of God and the witness they had given .
CEB	Revelation	6	10	They cried out with a loud voice , “ Holy and true Master , how long will you wait before you pass judgment ? How long before you require justice for our blood , which was shed by those who live on earth ? ”
CEB	Revelation	6	11	Each of them was given a white robe , and they were told to rest a little longer , until their fellow servants and brothers and sisters—who were about to be killed as they were—were finished .
CEB	Revelation	6	12	I looked on as he opened the sixth seal , and there was a great earthquake . The sun became black as funeral clothing , and the entire moon turned red as blood .
CEB	Revelation	6	13	The stars of the sky fell to the earth as a fig tree drops its fruit when shaken by a strong wind .
CEB	Revelation	6	14	The sky disappeared like a scroll being rolled up , and every mountain and island was moved from its place .
CEB	Revelation	6	15	Then the kings of the earth , the officials and the generals , the rich and the powerful , and everyone , slave and free , hid themselves in caves and in the rocks of the mountains .
CEB	Revelation	6	16	They called to the mountains and the rocks , “ Fall on us and hide us from the face of the one seated on the throne and from the Lamb ’ s wrath !
CEB	Revelation	6	17	The great day of their wrath has come , and who is able to stand ? ” Footnotes - Revelation 6:6 A denarion was a day ’ s pay for a laborer .
CEB	Revelation	7	7	from the tribe of Simeon , twelve thousand ; from the tribe of Levi , twelve thousand ; from the tribe of Issachar , twelve thousand ;
CEB	Revelation	7	2	I saw another angel coming up from the east , holding the seal of the living God . He cried out with a loud voice to the four angels who had been given the power to damage the earth and sea .
CEB	Revelation	7	3	He said , “ Don ’ t damage the earth , the sea , or the trees until we have put a seal on the foreheads of those who serve our God. ”
CEB	Revelation	7	4	Then I heard the number of those who were sealed : one hundred forty-four thousand , sealed from every tribe of the Israelites :
CEB	Revelation	7	5	From the tribe of Judah , twelve thousand were sealed ; from the tribe of Reuben , twelve thousand ; from the tribe of Gad , twelve thousand ;
CEB	Revelation	7	6	from the tribe of Asher , twelve thousand ; from the tribe of Naphtali , twelve thousand ; from the tribe of Manasseh , twelve thousand ;
CEB	Revelation	7	8	from the tribe of Zebulun , twelve thousand ; from the tribe of Joseph , twelve thousand ; from the tribe of Benjamin , twelve thousand were sealed . The great crowd and seventh seal
CEB	Revelation	7	9	After this I looked , and there was a great crowd that no one could number . They were from every nation , tribe , people , and language . They were standing before the throne and before the Lamb . They wore white robes and held palm branches in their hands .
CEB	Revelation	7	10	They cried out with a loud voice : “ Victory belongs to our God who sits on the throne , and to the Lamb. ”
CEB	Revelation	7	11	All the angels stood in a circle around the throne , and around the elders and the four living creatures . They fell facedown before the throne and worshipped God ,
CEB	Revelation	7	12	saying , “ Amen ! Blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and might be to our God forever and always . Amen. ”
CEB	Revelation	7	13	Then one of the elders said to me , “ Who are these people wearing white robes , and where did they come from ? ”
CEB	Revelation	7	14	I said to him , “ Sir , you know. ” Then he said to me , “ These people have come out of great hardship . They have washed their robes and made them white in the Lamb ’ s blood .
CEB	Revelation	7	15	This is the reason they are before God ’ s throne . They worship him day and night in his temple , and the one seated on the throne will shelter them .
CEB	Revelation	7	16	They won ’ t hunger or thirst anymore . No sun or scorching heat will beat down on them ,
CEB	Revelation	7	17	because the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne will shepherd them . He will lead them to the springs of life-giving water , [ a ] and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes. ” Footnotes - Revelation 7:17 Or the water of life
CEB	Revelation	8	8	Then the second angel blew his trumpet , and something like a huge mountain burning with fire was thrown down into the sea . A third of the sea became blood ,
CEB	Revelation	8	1	Then , when the Lamb opened the seventh seal , there was silence in heaven for about half an hour . The first four trumpet plagues
CEB	Revelation	8	2	Then I saw the seven angels who stand before God , and seven trumpets were given to them .
CEB	Revelation	8	3	Another angel came and stood at the altar , and he held a gold bowl for burning incense . He was given a large amount of incense , in order to offer it on behalf of the prayers of all the saints on the gold altar in front of the throne .
CEB	Revelation	8	4	The smoke of the incense offered for the prayers of the saints rose up before God from the angel ’ s hand .
CEB	Revelation	8	5	Then the angel took the incense container and filled it with fire from the altar . He threw it down to the earth , and there were thunder , voices , lightning , and an earthquake .
CEB	Revelation	8	6	Then the seven angels who held the seven trumpets got ready to blow them .
CEB	Revelation	8	7	The first angel blew his trumpet , and hail and fire mixed with blood appeared , and was thrown down to the earth . A third of the earth was burned up . A third of the trees were burned up . All the green grass was burned up .
CEB	Revelation	8	9	a third of the creatures living in the sea died , and a third of the ships were destroyed .
CEB	Revelation	8	10	Then the third angel blew his trumpet , and a great star , burning like a torch , fell from heaven . It fell on a third of the rivers and springs of water .
CEB	Revelation	8	11	The star ’ s name is Wormwood , and a third of the waters became wormwood , and many people died from the water , because it became so bitter .
CEB	Revelation	8	12	Then the fourth angel blew his trumpet , and a third of the sun was struck , and a third of the moon , and a third of the stars so that a third of them became dark . The day lost a third of its light , and the night lost a third of its light too .
CEB	Revelation	8	13	Then I looked and I heard an eagle flying high overhead . It said with a loud voice , “ Horror , horror , oh ! The horror for those who live on earth because of the blasts of the remaining trumpets that the three angels are about to blow ! ”
CEB	Revelation	9	9	In front they had what seemed to be iron armor upon their chests , and the sound of their wings was like the sound of many chariots and horses racing into battle .
CEB	Revelation	9	2	He opened the shaft of the abyss ; and smoke rose up from the shaft , like smoke from a huge furnace . The sun and air were darkened by the smoke from the shaft .
CEB	Revelation	9	3	Then locusts came forth from the smoke and onto the earth . They were given power like the power that scorpions have on the earth .
CEB	Revelation	9	4	They were told not to hurt the grass of the earth or any green plant or any tree . They could only hurt the people who didn ’ t have the seal of God on their foreheads .
CEB	Revelation	9	5	The locusts weren ’ t allowed to kill them , but only to make them suffer for five months—and the suffering they inflict is like that of a scorpion when it strikes a person .
CEB	Revelation	9	6	In those days people will seek death , but they won ’ t find it . They will want to die , but death will run away from them .
CEB	Revelation	9	7	The locusts looked like horses ready for battle . On their heads were what seemed to be gold crowns . Their faces were like human faces ,
CEB	Revelation	9	8	their hair was like women ’ s hair , and their teeth were like lions ’ teeth .
CEB	Revelation	9	10	They also have tails with stingers , just like scorpions ; and in their tails is their power to hurt people for five months .
CEB	Revelation	9	11	Their king is an angel from the abyss , whose Hebrew name is Abaddon , [ a ] and whose Greek name is Apollyon . [ b ]
CEB	Revelation	9	12	The first horror has passed . Look ! Two horrors are still coming after this .
CEB	Revelation	9	13	Then the sixth angel blew his trumpet , and I heard a voice from the four horns of the gold altar that is before God .
CEB	Revelation	9	14	It said to the sixth angel , who had the trumpet , “ Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates. ”
CEB	Revelation	9	15	Then the four angels who had been made ready for that hour , day , month , and year were released to kill a third of humankind .
CEB	Revelation	9	16	The number of cavalry troops was two hundred million . I heard their number .
CEB	Revelation	9	17	And this is the way I saw the horses and their riders in the vision : they had breastplates that were fiery red , dark blue , and yellow as sulfur . The horses ’ heads were like lions ’ heads , and out of their mouths came fire , smoke , and sulfur .
CEB	Revelation	9	18	By these three plagues a third of humankind was killed : by the fire , smoke , and sulfur coming out of their mouths .
CEB	Revelation	9	19	The horses ’ power is in their mouths and their tails , for their tails are like snakes with heads that inflict injuries .
CEB	Revelation	9	20	The rest of humankind , who weren ’ t killed by these plagues , didn ’ t change their hearts and lives and turn from their handiwork . They didn ’ t stop worshipping demons and idols made of gold , silver , bronze , stone , and wood—idols that can ’ t see or hear or walk .
CEB	Revelation	9	21	They didn ’ t turn away from their murders , their spells and drugs , their sexual immorality , or their stealing . Footnotes - Revelation 9:11 Destruction - Revelation 9:11 Destroyer
CEB	Revelation	10	10	So I took the scroll from the angel ’ s hand and ate it . And it was sweet as honey in my mouth , but when I swallowed it , it made my stomach churn .
CEB	Revelation	10	2	He held an open scroll in his hand . He put his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land .
CEB	Revelation	10	3	He called out with a loud voice like a lion roaring , and when he called out , the seven thunders raised their voices .
CEB	Revelation	10	4	When the seven thunders spoke , I was about to write , but I heard a voice from heaven say , “ Seal up what the seven thunders have said , and don ’ t write it down. ”
CEB	Revelation	10	5	Then the angel I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand to heaven .
CEB	Revelation	10	6	He swore by the one who lives forever and always , who created heaven and what is in it , the earth and what is in it , and the sea and what is in it , and said , “ The time is up .
CEB	Revelation	10	7	In the days when the seventh angel blows his trumpet , God ’ s mysterious purpose will be accomplished , fulfilling the good news he gave to his servants the prophets. ”
CEB	Revelation	10	8	Then the voice I heard from heaven spoke to me again and said , “ Go , take the opened scroll from the hand of the angel who stands on the sea and on the land. ”
CEB	Revelation	10	9	So I went to the angel and told him to give me the scroll . He said to me , “ Take it and eat it . It will make you sick to your stomach , but sweet as honey in your mouth. ”
CEB	Revelation	10	11	I was told , “ You must prophesy again about many peoples , nations , languages , and kings . ”
CEB	Revelation	11	11	“ But after three and a half days , the breath of life from God entered them , and they stood on their feet . Great fear came over those who saw them .
CEB	Revelation	11	2	But don ’ t measure the court outside the temple . Leave that out , because it has been given to the nations , and they will trample the holy city underfoot for forty-two months .
CEB	Revelation	11	3	“ And I will allow my two witnesses to prophesy for one thousand two hundred sixty days , wearing mourning clothes .
CEB	Revelation	11	4	These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth .
CEB	Revelation	11	5	If anyone wants to hurt them , fire comes out of their mouth and burns up their enemies . So if anyone wants to hurt them , they have to be killed in this way .
CEB	Revelation	11	6	They have the power to close up the sky so that no rain will fall for as long as they prophesy . They also have power over the waters , to turn them into blood , and to strike the earth with any plague , as often as they wish .
CEB	Revelation	11	7	“ When they have finished their witnessing , the beast that comes up from the abyss will make war on them , gain victory over them , and kill them .
CEB	Revelation	11	8	Their dead bodies will lie on the street of the great city that is spiritually called Sodom and Egypt , where also their Lord was crucified .
CEB	Revelation	11	9	And for three and a half days , members of the peoples , tribes , languages , and nations will look at their dead bodies , but they won ’ t let their dead bodies be put in a tomb .
CEB	Revelation	11	10	Those who live on earth will rejoice over them . They will celebrate and give each other gifts , because these two prophets had brought such pain to those who live on earth .
CEB	Revelation	11	12	Then they heard a loud voice from heaven say to them , ‘ Come up here. ’ And they went up to heaven in a cloud , while their enemies watched them .
CEB	Revelation	11	13	At that hour there was a great earthquake , and a tenth of the city fell . Seven thousand people were killed by the earthquake , and the rest were afraid and gave glory to the God of heaven. ”
CEB	Revelation	11	14	The second horror is over . The third horror is coming soon . Seventh trumpet
CEB	Revelation	11	15	Then the seventh angel blew his trumpet , and there were loud voices in heaven saying , “ The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and his Christ , and he will rule forever and always. ”
CEB	Revelation	11	16	Then the twenty-four elders , who were seated on their thrones before God , fell on their faces and worshipped God .
CEB	Revelation	11	17	They said , “ We give thanks to you , Lord God Almighty , who is and was , for you have taken your great power and enforced your rule .
CEB	Revelation	11	18	The nations were enraged , but your wrath came . The time came for the dead to be judged . The time came to reward your servants , the prophets and saints , and those who fear your name , both small and great , and to destroy those who destroy the earth. ”
CEB	Revelation	11	19	Then God ’ s temple in heaven was opened , and the chest containing his covenant appeared in his temple . There were lightning , voices , thunder , an earthquake , and large hail .
CEB	Revelation	12	12	Therefore , rejoice , you heavens and you who dwell in them . But oh ! The horror for the earth and sea ! The devil has come down to you with great rage , for he knows that he only has a short time. ” The dragon pursues the woman
CEB	Revelation	12	2	She was pregnant , and she cried out because she was in labor , in pain from giving birth .
CEB	Revelation	12	3	Then another sign appeared in heaven : it was a great fiery red dragon , with seven heads and ten horns , and seven royal crowns on his heads .
CEB	Revelation	12	4	His tail swept down a third of heaven ’ s stars and threw them to the earth . The dragon stood in front of the woman who was about to give birth so that when she gave birth , he might devour her child .
CEB	Revelation	12	5	She gave birth to a son , a male child who is to rule all the nations with an iron rod . Her child was snatched up to God and his throne .
CEB	Revelation	12	6	Then the woman fled into the desert , where God has prepared a place for her . There she will be taken care of for one thousand two hundred sixty days . Michael and the dragon
CEB	Revelation	12	7	Then there was war in heaven : Michael and his angels fought the dragon . The dragon and his angels fought back ,
CEB	Revelation	12	8	but they did not prevail , and there was no longer any place for them in heaven .
CEB	Revelation	12	9	So the great dragon was thrown down . The old snake , who is called the devil and Satan , the deceiver of the whole world , was thrown down to the earth ; and his angels were thrown down with him .
CEB	Revelation	12	10	Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say , “ Now the salvation and power and kingdom of our God , and the authority of his Christ have come . The accuser of our brothers and sisters , who accuses them day and night before our God , has been thrown down .
CEB	Revelation	12	11	They gained the victory over him on account of the blood of the Lamb and the word of their witness . Love for their own lives didn ’ t make them afraid to die .
CEB	Revelation	12	13	When the dragon saw that he had been thrown down to the earth , he chased the woman who had given birth to the male child .
CEB	Revelation	12	14	But the woman was given the two wings of the great eagle so that she could fly to her place in the desert . There she would be taken care of—out of the snake ’ s reach—for a time and times and half a time .
CEB	Revelation	12	15	Then from his mouth the snake poured a river of water after the woman so that the river would sweep her away .
CEB	Revelation	12	16	But the earth helped the woman . The earth opened its mouth and swallowed the river that the dragon poured out of his mouth .
CEB	Revelation	12	17	So the dragon was furious with the woman , and he went off to make war on the rest of her children , on those who keep God ’ s commandments and hold firmly to the witness of Jesus . The beast from the sea
CEB	Revelation	12	18	Then the dragon stood on the seashore ,
CEB	Revelation	13	13	It does great signs so that it even makes fire come down from heaven to earth in the presence of the people .
CEB	Revelation	13	1	and I saw a beast coming up out of the sea . It had ten horns and seven heads . Each of its horns was decorated with a royal crown , and on its heads were blasphemous names .
CEB	Revelation	13	2	The beast I saw was like a leopard . Its feet were like a bear ’ s , and its mouth was like a lion ’ s mouth . The dragon gave it his power , throne , and great authority .
CEB	Revelation	13	3	One of its heads appeared to have been slain and killed , but its deadly wound was healed . So the whole earth was amazed and followed the beast .
CEB	Revelation	13	4	They worshipped the dragon because it had given the beast its authority . They worshipped the beast and said , “ Who is like the beast , and who can fight against it ? ”
CEB	Revelation	13	5	The beast was given a mouth that spoke boastful and blasphemous things , and it was given authority to act for forty-two months .
CEB	Revelation	13	6	It opened its mouth to speak blasphemies against God . It blasphemed God ’ s name and his dwelling place ( that is , those who dwell in heaven ) .
CEB	Revelation	13	7	It was also allowed to make war on the saints and to gain victory over them . It was given authority over every tribe , people , language , and nation .
CEB	Revelation	13	8	All who live on earth worshipped it , all whose names hadn ’ t been written—from the time the earth was made—in the scroll of life of the Lamb who was slain .
CEB	Revelation	13	9	Whoever has ears must listen :
CEB	Revelation	13	10	If any are to be taken captive , then into captivity they will go . If any are to be killed by the sword , then by the sword they will be killed . This calls for endurance and faithfulness on the part of the saints . The beast from the land
CEB	Revelation	13	11	Then I saw another beast coming up from the earth . It had two horns like a lamb , but it was speaking like a dragon .
CEB	Revelation	13	12	It exercises all the authority of the first beast in its presence . It also makes the earth and those who live in it worship the first beast , whose fatal wound was healed .
CEB	Revelation	13	14	It deceives those who live on earth by the signs that it was allowed to do in the presence of the beast . It told those who live on earth to make an image for the beast who had been wounded by the sword and yet came to life again .
CEB	Revelation	13	15	It was allowed to give breath to the beast ’ s image so that the beast ’ s image would even speak and cause anyone who didn ’ t worship the beast ’ s image to be put to death .
CEB	Revelation	13	16	It forces everyone—the small and great , the rich and poor , the free and slaves—to have a mark put on their right hand or on their forehead .
CEB	Revelation	13	17	It will not allow anyone to make a purchase or sell anything unless the person has the mark with the beast ’ s name or the number of its name .
CEB	Revelation	13	18	This calls for wisdom . Let the one who understands calculate the beast ’ s number , for it ’ s a human being ’ s number . Its number is six hundred sixty-six .
CEB	Revelation	14	14	Then I looked , and there was a white cloud . On the cloud was seated someone who looked like the Human One . [ a ] He had a gold crown on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand .
CEB	Revelation	14	2	I heard a sound from heaven that was like the sound of rushing water and loud thunder . The sound I heard was like that of harpists playing their harps .
CEB	Revelation	14	3	They sing a new song in front of the throne , the four living creatures , and the elders . And no one could learn the song except the one hundred forty-four thousand who had been purchased from the earth .
CEB	Revelation	14	4	They weren ’ t defiled with women , for these people who follow the Lamb wherever he goes are virgins . They were purchased from among humankind as early produce for God and the Lamb .
CEB	Revelation	14	5	No lie came from their mouths ; they are blameless . Messages of three angels
CEB	Revelation	14	6	Then I saw another angel flying high overhead with eternal good news to proclaim to those who live on earth , and to every nation , tribe , language , and people .
CEB	Revelation	14	7	He said in a loud voice , “ Fear God and give him glory , for the hour of his judgment has come . Worship the one who made heaven and earth , the sea and springs of water. ”
CEB	Revelation	14	8	Another angel , a second one , followed and said , “ Fallen , fallen is Babylon the great ! She made all the nations drink the wine of her lustful passion. ”
CEB	Revelation	14	9	Then another angel , a third one , followed them and said in a loud voice , “ If any worship the beast and its image , and receive a mark on their foreheads or their hands ,
CEB	Revelation	14	10	they themselves will also drink the wine of God ’ s passionate anger , poured full strength into the cup of his wrath . They will suffer the pain of fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and the Lamb .
CEB	Revelation	14	11	The smoke of their painful suffering goes up forever and always . There is no rest day or night for those who worship the beast and its image , and those who receive the mark of its name. ”
CEB	Revelation	14	12	This calls for the endurance of the saints , who keep God ’ s commandments and keep faith with Jesus .
CEB	Revelation	14	13	And I heard a voice from heaven say , “ Write this : Favored are the dead who die in the Lord from now on. ” “ Yes , ” says the Spirit , “ so they can rest from their labors , because their deeds follow them. ” Two harvests of the earth
CEB	Revelation	14	15	Another angel came out of the temple , calling in a loud voice to the one seated on the cloud : “ Use your sickle to reap the harvest , for the time to harvest has come , and the harvest of the earth is ripe. ”
CEB	Revelation	14	16	So the one seated on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth , and the earth was harvested .
CEB	Revelation	14	17	Then another angel came out of the temple in heaven , and he also had a sharp sickle .
CEB	Revelation	14	18	Still another angel , who has power over fire , came out from the altar . He said in a loud voice to the one who had the sharp sickle , “ Use your sharp sickle to cut the clusters in the vineyard of the earth , because its grapes are ripe. ”
CEB	Revelation	14	19	So the angel swung his sickle into the earth , and cut the vineyard of the earth , and he put what he reaped into the great winepress of God ’ s passionate anger .
CEB	Revelation	14	20	Then the winepress was trampled outside the city , and the blood came out of the winepress as high as the horses ’ bridles for almost two hundred miles . [ b ] Footnotes - Revelation 14:14 Or Son of Man - Revelation 14:20 Or one thousand six hundred stades
CEB	Revelation	15	15	Then I saw another great and awe-inspiring sign in heaven . There were seven angels with seven plagues—and these are the last , for with them God ’ s anger is brought to an end .
CEB	Revelation	15	2	Then I saw what appeared to be a sea of glass mixed with fire . Those who gained victory over the beast , its image , and the number of its name were standing by the glass sea , holding harps from God .
CEB	Revelation	15	3	They sing the song of Moses , God ’ s servant , and the song of the Lamb , saying , “ Great and awe-inspiring are your works , Lord God Almighty . Just and true are your ways , king of the nations .
CEB	Revelation	15	4	Who won ’ t fear you , Lord , and glorify your name ? You alone are holy . All nations will come and fall down in worship before you , for your acts of justice have been revealed. ” Seven bowl plagues
CEB	Revelation	15	5	After this I looked , and the temple in heaven—that is , the tent of witness—was opened .
CEB	Revelation	15	6	The seven angels , who have the seven plagues , came out of the temple . They were clothed in pure bright linen and had gold sashes around their waists .
CEB	Revelation	15	7	Then one of the four living creatures gave the seven angels seven gold bowls full of the anger of the God who lives forever and always .
CEB	Revelation	15	8	The temple was filled with smoke from God ’ s glory and power , and no one could go into the temple until the seven plagues of the seven last angels were brought to an end .
CEB	Revelation	16	16	The spirits gathered them at the place that is called in Hebrew , Harmagedon . [ a ]
CEB	Revelation	16	2	So the first angel poured his bowl on the earth , and a nasty and terrible sore appeared on the people who had the beast ’ s mark and worshipped its image .
CEB	Revelation	16	3	The second angel poured his bowl into the sea , and the sea turned into blood , like the blood of a corpse , and every living thing in the sea died .
CEB	Revelation	16	4	The third angel poured his bowl into the rivers and springs of water , and they turned into blood .
CEB	Revelation	16	5	Then I heard the angel of the waters say , “ You are just , holy one , who is and was , because you have given these judgments .
CEB	Revelation	16	6	They poured out the blood of saints and prophets , and you have given them blood to drink . They deserve it ! ”
CEB	Revelation	16	7	And I heard the altar say , “ Yes , Lord God Almighty , your judgments are true and just. ”
CEB	Revelation	16	8	The fourth angel poured his bowl on the sun , and it was allowed to burn people with fire .
CEB	Revelation	16	9	The people were burned by intense heat , and they cursed the name of the God who had power over these plagues . But they didn ’ t change their hearts and lives and give him glory .
CEB	Revelation	16	10	The fifth angel poured his bowl over the beast ’ s throne , and darkness covered its kingdom . People bit their tongues because of their pain ,
CEB	Revelation	16	11	and they cursed the God of heaven because of their pains and sores ; but they didn ’ t turn away from what they had done .
CEB	Revelation	16	12	Then the sixth angel poured his bowl on the great river Euphrates . Its water was dried up so that the way was ready for the kings from the east .
CEB	Revelation	16	13	Then I saw three unclean spirits , like frogs , come from the dragon ’ s mouth , the beast ’ s mouth , and the mouth of the false prophet .
CEB	Revelation	16	14	These are demonic spirits that do signs . They go out to the kings of the whole world , to gather them for battle on the great day of God the Almighty . (
CEB	Revelation	16	15	Look ! I ’ m coming like a thief ! Favored are those who stay awake and clothed so that they don ’ t go around naked and exposed to shame . )
CEB	Revelation	16	17	Then the seventh angel poured his bowl into the air , and a loud voice came out from the temple , from the throne , saying , “ It is done ! ”
CEB	Revelation	16	18	There were lightning strikes , voices , and thunder , and a great earthquake occurred . The earthquake was greater than any that have occurred since there have been people on earth .
CEB	Revelation	16	19	The great city split into three parts , and the cities of the nations fell . God remembered Babylon the great so that he gave her the wine cup of his furious anger .
CEB	Revelation	16	20	Every island fled , and the mountains disappeared .
CEB	Revelation	16	21	Huge hailstones weighing about one hundred pounds came down from heaven on the people . They cursed God for the plague of hail , because the plague was so terrible . Footnotes - Revelation 16:16 Or Armageddon
CEB	Revelation	17	17	because God moved them to carry out his purposes . That is why they will be of one mind and give their royal power to the beast , until God ’ s words have been accomplished .
CEB	Revelation	17	2	The kings of the earth have committed sexual immorality with her , and those who live on earth have become drunk with the wine of her whoring. ”
CEB	Revelation	17	3	Then he brought me in a Spirit-inspired trance to a desert . There I saw a woman seated on a scarlet beast that was covered with blasphemous names . It had seven heads and ten horns .
CEB	Revelation	17	4	The woman wore purple and scarlet clothing , and she glittered with gold and jewels and pearls . In her hand she held a gold cup full of the vile and impure things that came from her activity as a prostitute .
CEB	Revelation	17	5	A name—a mystery—was written on her forehead : “ Babylon the great , the mother of prostitutes and the vile things of the earth. ”
CEB	Revelation	17	6	I saw that the woman was drunk on the blood of the saints and the blood of Jesus ’ witnesses . I was completely stunned when I saw her .
CEB	Revelation	17	7	Then the angel said to me , “ Why are you amazed ? I will tell you the mystery of the woman and the seven-headed , ten-horned beast that carries her .
CEB	Revelation	17	8	The beast that you saw was and is not , and is about to come up out of the abyss and go to destruction . Those who live on earth , whose names haven ’ t been written in the scroll of life from the time the earth was made , will be amazed when they see the beast , because it was and is not and will again be present .
CEB	Revelation	17	9	This calls for an understanding mind . The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated . They are also seven kings .
CEB	Revelation	17	10	Five kings have fallen , the one is , and the other hasn ’ t yet come . When that king comes , he must remain for only a short time .
CEB	Revelation	17	11	As for the beast that was and is not , it is itself an eighth king that belongs to the seven , and it is going to destruction .
CEB	Revelation	17	12	The ten horns that you saw are ten kings , who haven ’ t yet received royal power . But they will receive royal authority for an hour , along with the beast .
CEB	Revelation	17	13	These kings will be of one mind , and they will give their power and authority to the beast .
CEB	Revelation	17	14	They will make war on the Lamb , but the Lamb will emerge victorious , for he is Lord of lords and King of kings . Those with him are called , chosen , and faithful. ”
CEB	Revelation	17	15	Then he said to me , “ The waters that you saw , where the prostitute is seated , are peoples , crowds , nations , and languages .
CEB	Revelation	17	16	As for the ten horns that you saw , they and the beast will hate the prostitute . They will destroy her and strip her bare . They will devour her flesh and burn her with fire
CEB	Revelation	17	18	The woman whom you saw is the great city that rules over the kings of the earth . ”
CEB	Revelation	18	18	They cried out as they saw the smoke from her burning and said , ‘ What city was ever like the great city ? ’
CEB	Revelation	18	2	He called out with a loud voice , saying , “ Fallen , fallen is Babylon the great ! She has become a home for demons and a lair for every unclean spirit . She is a lair for every unclean bird , and a lair for every unclean and disgusting beast
CEB	Revelation	18	3	because all the nations have fallen [ a ] due to the wine of her lustful passion . The kings of the earth committed sexual immorality with her , and the merchants of the earth became rich from the power of her loose and extravagant ways. ”
CEB	Revelation	18	4	Then I heard another voice from heaven say , “ Come out of her , my people , so that you don ’ t take part in her sins and don ’ t receive any of her plagues .
CEB	Revelation	18	5	Her sins have piled up as high as heaven , and God remembered her unjust acts .
CEB	Revelation	18	6	Give her what she has given to others . Give her back twice as much for what she has done . In the cup that she has poured , pour her twice as much .
CEB	Revelation	18	7	To the extent that she glorified herself and indulged her loose and extravagant ways , give her pain and grief . In her heart she says , ‘ I sit like a queen ! I ’ m not a widow . I ’ ll never see grief. ’
CEB	Revelation	18	8	This is why her plagues will come in a single day—deadly disease , grief , and hunger . She will be consumed by fire because the Lord God who judges her is powerful .
CEB	Revelation	18	9	“ The kings of the earth , who committed sexual immorality with her and shared her loose and extravagant ways , will weep and mourn over her when they see the smoke from her burning .
CEB	Revelation	18	10	They will stand a long way off because they are afraid of the pain she suffers , and they will say , ‘ Oh , the horror ! Babylon , you great city , you powerful city ! In a single hour your judgment has come. ’
CEB	Revelation	18	11	“ The merchants of the earth will weep and mourn over her , for no one buys their cargoes anymore—
CEB	Revelation	18	12	cargoes of gold , silver , jewels , and pearls ; fine linen , purple , silk , and scarlet ; all those things made of scented wood , ivory , fine wood , bronze , iron , and marble ;
